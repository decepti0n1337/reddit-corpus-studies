... apprentice rarely comes in handy, tbh.  The list just doesn't have that "miracle" engine as you mentioned. Thalnos would be nice.
---
---
---
As annoying evolve is to play against, it's pretty funny that he was just 1 missing combo piece away from you creating a check-mate boardstate yourself on turn 5
---
Just stop playing the game entirely. You know how they're supporting China it's all messed up
---
Another 'cheap' old school option would be to run an 'Enrage' minion like Amani berserker, Temple Berserker or just run Sunreaver.
---
amalgam isn't broken, it's just a very important card in the balance of the game. He enables different strategies and is really important in allowing you to change strategies throughout the game. Like, yeah, he's a really good card, but there's really nothing you can do about it. He enables menagerie, otherwise a bunch of cards go out the window.
---
None! Save money for standard packs
---
Get as many golden minions as you can. Spend them when you hit 4 stars. Get golden lightfang enforcer. Get menagerie board then afk and let +8/+8 every turn win you the game.
---
Lol, reading the comments...
---

---
Junkbot and Cobalt would overrun battlegrounds and be more annoying than they are already. Mechs every game would be a worse meta than having fatboys that are vulnerable to poison.
---
If Lightfang is winning every game you're playing against slow players because the lightfang strategy can easily get aggro'd out.
---
Lol I meant that

You’re playing a relatively powerful deck at what I would assume are the lowest ranks if you’ve been gone for a year and a half. Not too unusual.

---
Like I said before I’m pretty noob at it. I don’t put much thought into it I’m quite happy being a filthy casual hahaha
---
Afk could end turn too.
---
This is the only bug I've encountered so far.
---
Yo dawg
---
Thank you. Some of these along with the gameplay cycle make the game almost unplayable on mobile devices. Drag to hand to buy, then open hand, drag to field to play, then close hand because you can't buy with hand open... these kind of things make steps take much longer, so some shortcuts would definitely improve things and give more setup time.
---
almost every one of these designs are bad. Focus on quality, not quantity
---
Poison animation shouldn't trigger if the enemy is killed outright.
---
Instead of doing the poison symbol flashing animation, just make the poisoned minion flash with a green cloud as it dies. If it dies from poison only.
---
Don't feel bad. Bob has a 100% win rate. He literally can't lose a game, but he can win them
---
Hey ! It happened to me too !
---
Two left: enemy was Akazamzarak and I was Patchwerk.
---
He was at 13 hp, I won, saw the animation, and the game continued exactly as you explained...The enemy recruited better minions,  I won a second time, he recruited even better minions,  lowed his health to 3, again same thing and then I finally lost after the third encounter....
---
I'm glad (or scared ?) that someone experienced the same bug/exploit.
---
The beast buff roar animation is slow, but it could in theory continue if it didn't block other animations from going off. The poison one blocking is also the problem, but it kinda had to block because of the nature of the animation. Needs a new animation.
---
Last boss is a pain, but its not as bad as most of the heroics
---
My original idea was that some of Dr. Boom's hero powers can be used to mimic existing hero powers, and then I got lazy making them. 
---
But yeah gain 7 armor or something might be ok.
---
There is no comeback at all if you dont make sense.
---
&gt; ı almost forgot how Standart feels like lol.
---
Still the same old Hare + Mogu + Evolve.
---
It doesn't work if you have the Zerus in hand and they have transformed, it's weird. You need to buy all 3 Zerus in the same turn or have them on board, they only combine when it's actually Zerus, otherwise they combine with the card they are masking as.
---
Insults make you look like the bad, sir.  Stick to the argument, junior.  
---
Amalgam isn’t broken, you don’t NEED him to win and he’s in there to provide synergy that would be sorely missed otherwise.
---
Add a zul'jin and hagatha to it as well, don't know how it is going to work but it would be nice to see.
---
At least it’s not SS tier. 
---
But seriously this is the second or maybe even third best minion in the game.  I say nightmare amalgam has it beat easily and possibly cobalt guardian too.
---
I did this and immediately got rewarded with golden brann from zerus. 10/10 would do it again.
---
&gt;I think this is fair
---
-person who bought in.
---
Nice try, Zola.
---
They do you just have to play it.
---
I have it bugged
---
Well when you purchase it, its not.. shortly there after it transforms into a demi-god of hatred. Amalgam final boss of Diablo 4 imo
---
but it's still an advantage blizzard are pretending is achievable without paying cash. some heroes are better than others if they suit your playstyle better so you have a better chance to get your best heroes.
---
I believe so, but unfortunately you'd have to play it from hand. I'd sell the Sneed's to make space, since there's a chance you'll probably get one from the Egg triple anyway.
---
Also keep rolling for the Junkbot triple, in case that wasn't obvious.
---
What a shit hero power. No one would ever pick that.
---
I’m having success with similar “shoot pass taunt wall” or “Zephyrs into silence” decks. N’zoth is forcing hard control/heal out of the meta, benefitting face decks as mentioned in my original reply. Good luck!
---
You need the sound on it doesn't say it with text
---
Menagerie means a bunch of different tribes. Amalgams are key parts of menagerie strategies
---
And tempo generally trumps value in arena.
---
As Deryl, stay on Tavern 2 or 3 and dance on every Divine Shield minion you see. Nobody else wants them so you can combine them (and more importantly, their hats) easily. Late game, look for Bolvar and Phalanx Commander.
---
The flavor text for heroes that depend on certain minions should read &lt;75% less chance to see minions of that type in the recruiting phase&gt;
---
Here's a trick: if you close the Hearthstone client when there's around 20 seconds left in the recruit phase, you'll skip the combat phase entirely, giving you more time for the next recruit phase.
---
Your specific timing may vary depending on how fast/slow your computer is, but this helps me when I'm playing AFK, giving me another ~20 seconds for the big turn three. I haven't tested it yet, but I assume it would also help in the later game, when the combat phase tends to last a while.
---
It does this on desktop too
---
Sorry. I was asking. Is it cross play or separate matchmaking?
---
I *do* like watching the combat phase, but some animations could definitely be sped up, e.g., when a poison minion attacks into another poison minion.
---
Quit flexing your knowledge on flexing
---
Tier up. Re roll. 4 tier ones. Thanks Bob
---
Just echoing that I was 1-0 when the previous brawl stopped working, and now the chest is open but I never received a pack.
---
Thank you now i know
---
This also works with Khadgar, if you play him before the token generator you can spawn two and end up with two goldens, from the tokens and the original minions. This saved me when my board was WEAK.

---
Honestly though, there's not *too* much RNG in this game mode. Minion positioning and warband composition is are the major factors, both of which you can control, and attacks are made from left to right.
---
That is, except for the minions you see, what you can discover, variable deathrattles, and what your minions actually attack (barring taunts)... But seriously, I never feel *too* screwed by RNG, *most* of the time.
---
Sorry to hear. But to make you feel better i never go into a game with less than 12 percent battery
---
Desktop is more responsive with actions/animations, and has less timer lag.
---
It shouldn’t even trigger. Poison is clear to see, and you’ll know what happens if you’re paying attention. If not, it doesn’t matter cus the game is auto playing at that time.
---
Usually takes 9 to 11 percent  of my battery
---
Yeah, I'm not 100% sure on how other autobattlers work, but isn't there a lot of RNG in how your dudes attack your opponents' dudes in other games too?
---
That's really the main source of RNG in this game mode, other than, ya know, the minions you actually see in the shop. That's gonna be inherent to all autobattlers though.
---
My idea: cutting Amalgams from Battlegrounds.
---
whats everyones rating right now? im at 6200
---
A sneed or foe reaper would have been nicer than the vanilla 4/3
---
I agree that amalgam requires a heavy handed nerf - I'm just saying that a nerf from tier 2 to tier 3 is in fact quite heavy handed.
---
Wait, if someone else buys a minion, it takes it out of your pool?
---
Please fix it for base Hearthstone too! It needs some love too!
---
Even if blizzard went bankrupt it wouldn't help HK for shit. So just play :).  Battlegrounds is really fun.
---
Giving each bot a deathrattle to summon a micro bot would make your junkbots out of control. Its ok for the murloc king to do it because no one cares when murlocs eat it.
---
He's shifting between modes!
---
I always buy em when I see em. Fits any buff or magnetize or even knowing there is one less in the pool for the curator to get sounds good.
---
Wow, that's a lot of text.  I think what's most boring to me is just that there are really only ever 3-4 valid decks at any given time.   Call it the "meta" if you want to, but that isn't very much variety in a game where you basically just do the same thing over and over again.  In fact, my current deck is so stale that I don't even really have to pay attention to what I'm doing.  I know what my first five cards are going to be every single time, assuming I get them, of course.
---
I think the game is busted if there's a possibility you can even lose by turn 3, but the fact that it now happens regularly is laughable.  I don't really have an answer for you except this is where Hearthstone has been for awhile now and you either play it just to play it or you move on.  I don't know too many people who are like "OMG HEARTHSTONE FUELS MY UTMOST GAMING PASSIONS!! 😍😍" these days.
---
The power is awful
---
That's what I thought!
---
Why would you do that lol
---
I wish there was any actual point in making posts like this. You’re obviously correct, but nothing will ever come of it.
---
This isn't the first time a meta has been like this. Midrange shaman, pirate warrior, jade druid and cubelock have all been in the same position as the current iteration of shaman. Blizzard is just bad at balancing .
---
yep

Rope every turn players are a minority, and I’d disagree that everyone wants to take their turn as slow as possible, especially in a ranked setting. Usually players that want to climb ranks try to not rope for no reason since they want to climb fast, and the only time they take turns slow is when they actually have a hard decision or their deck type naturally has longer turns (think miracle rogue, grim patron, old school control warrior). The way the system is right is fine because everyone knows the turn time and it’s the same for an aggro player or a combo player, or a control player. With what you are proposing I think some play styles will be hugely advantaged like aggro, since their turns are usually very short, and other play styles like combo, control, or any reactive kind of deck that tries to adapt to the pace of the game rather then set it would be at a disadvantage. When the fast player would have to make a hard, time-consuming decision they’d have way more time from the bonus seconds while the reactive decks will have way less in the same situation
---
The counterpoint often provided is that too many nerfs scares away casual F2P players. It's a valid argument, which is why I tend to not get too upset when obvious nerf targets are left untouched for a long time (shoutout to Carnivorous Cube).
---
Yet in this example Evolve is a card that they gave to everyone for free. It powers a deck that would still be strong without it and the only collateral damage would be the 80 dust that people spent on Desert Hares. I've yet to see a good reason why they shouldn't admit their mistake and replace Evolve with Devolve.
---
I wish i could mute Bob, he talks way too much.
---
please dm it to me if you found it :&gt;
---
Where are you basing your stats on if it is just the free mode of hsreplay you're getting in accurate data. I just checked vicious syndicate as their sample size has gotten smaller since the doom in the tomb event. Pretty sure highlander paladin and hunter are only decent outside of legend maybe not even in rank 5 to legend. We're complaining about shaman as it makes pp upwards to 30% of the ladder and there is no "should have played around it". the winrate of shaman increases as it goes higher and you forget to note that since there are so many shaman's on the ladder it maintains a respectable winrate with all the mirror matches.
---
You should look at the stats from rank 5 to legend and at legend.
---
r/TheHearth
---
&gt; The buffs made the game a lot worse
---
While one of the buffs did elevate a deck to a maybe too powerful spot, and one was reverted as a preventitive measure alongside the other nerf, the majority of the buffs were good and enabled a ton of fun decks.  They were definitely a net improvement to the game.
---
Overall it was a good experiment, and there were plenty of other problem cards aside from one buff.
---
Though the current bringing back wild cards...  There are some interesting decks that have come of it, but notably less so than with the buffs.  And overall it took us from a really good meta to one that's one of the poorer ones.  
---
Why they made the event as long as it is I have no idea, I'd love the pre-DitT meta back, it would be SO much better.  One month has been more than long enough for wild cards to be back, even three weeks would've been nice, but another month of this has me logging on once every few days to burn through quests for some gold for the expansion and nothing else.
---
Either Amalgam or Toxfin needs to be the target of removal. Both cannot exist together.
---
“You’re gonna do great!”

I know that’s lie Bob. I’m in last place with no unit synergy being sent my way, but damnit if I don’t appreciate your positivity!

I had pretty big Boi myself but I think it's right not to put tount on it so it can stay alive longer until poison creatures are dead. Otherwise yeh that bi mf
---
and this is how it feels to play wild :)
---
thanks lol, guy takes whining to a new level with these novels.
---
If you already have a golden Minion, you can get three more basic ones to get a second gold one. Tree gold ones won't combine however.
---
You can combine Tokens, however they have to be all summoned. So you can't get two gold cards with three Tidehunters, since they will combine before you can summon the third Token. A fourth Tidehunter however, can give you another Token, making it possible.

I played HS for 4 years. Between this meta, especially hearing that the devs planned it and are ok with it, and the gwent iOS app release, I just moved on.
---
When you try another game, it becomes very apparent just how bad the HS balance team is and how little fun playing HS is.
---
&gt;Just accept that you have to pick up an amalgam sooner or later
---
If everyone has to pick the same card, that's a problem.
---
I know, asking for fringe strategies. ;)
---
How was your Thursday before this last Thursday?
---
I disagree. If I play a new game, see my minion attacking an enemy minion and survive with 5 HP, just to die anyways, I'm actually going to be confused. 
---
It can probably be shortened, but the trigger animation shouldn't go away. 
---
Now if the minion dies anyway, poison or not, it probably shouldn't play. just as lifesteal really shouldn't play when you are at full health
---
Hence their decision, but that's how Arena works and virtually nobody pays cash for those runs.
---
Bad strategy.  Looking for triples can be a trap.
---
Tell me when was the last time you saw a card that was buffed but not broken see play?
---
The 4 cards that were buffed that saw/see play are Luna's, Extra Arms, Thunderhead and Crystology. 2 were reverted, and 2 are still in the game.
---
Rise of Mech, including Snip-Snap was one big fucking mistake, but leaving Evolve in the rotation for so long is just moronic on a whole another level.
---
maybe. elise is still way better tempo wise if both minions were understatted id agree more
---
And Buffs is something they should be doing alot more aswell.
---
For wild and standard.
---
Heck can even combine wild cards to standard adn buffs. Like they Push some beast expansion,buff some old cards (like for beast druid) and rotate those in standard for while .
---
The Wild meta is absolute trash right now, I have no idea on what planet it isn't, but on this one it is Secret Mage and Snip-Lock for days.
---
How can you be so sure? Maybe you should read it again but slower.
---
Same problem man I sent in a support ticket

Thanks for the great reply. Is the new battleground mode out, or is it in beta?
---
Wow! This is amazing :o
---
i have my mobile games always muted so i never thought he was that talkative. good thing there are no subtitles lol
---
Yes.
---
Honestly, pick the one you like best and just Practice it. I'd argue that Quest Shaman is the strongest with the evolve Combo, but all 3 decks are fine.
---
lightfang only exists in battlegrounds.
---
Open beta started this week. Then again, what does a beta even mean nowadays: the mode is right there in the main client and available for everyone. So it's basically released.
---
Spawn, Crowd Favorite, Scavenger and Argus are great. There's currently no Dragons that would work in BG.
---
why would you concede just because your lineup isn't interesting? just make a boring but really good lineup lol
---
Rank is not a direct signifier of a player's skill. It's usually a function of player skill and time invested.
---
Control warrior , easy
---
What? Why does Amalgam matter in this context? The point is that Amalgam kind of makes tribe synergies a lot less important - if it didn't exist, poisonous would be relegated to Murlocs and Maexxna, making them a solid counter to the high health Mechs and Demons. As it stands, Mech builds can just lean into Amalgams for all their health troubles, because Amalgam can get poisonous too.
---
Also to note: Junkbots just straight up aren't always available. The better Battlegrounds players tend to do well with whatever they're given, with a little variance. Junkbots are good but can be sniped and poisoned (relatively moreso than some of the other snowbally minions).
---
They literally don’t care. Look at Iksar’s tweets, he’s so condescending to players who aren’t happy. They even told Firebat at Blizzcon that they *knew* it would be this way with evolve. It’s intentional.
---
No it’s gender. Read the comments
---
Idk man i havent bought DOD and ive won 20 times now
---
Like what?
---
Murloc midgame is what makes them bad. 
---
Seer is the only hope murloc have of making it to the late game and they get eaten up by everyone trying to buff Amalgam. 
---
Warleaders are also popular pickups for buffing Amalgam early game. 
---
Everyone will pick up Megasaurs late game for the Amalgam buffs or just to screw over any possible murlocs that haven't died off (there's only 6 copies to get).
---
From a technical sense, Echo's naturally die out. Each time the echo comes back it's a little quieter until it's gone. So the Echo mechanic could totally cap at 5-8 for a single card and it shouldn't be the biggest problem. 
---
But don't take my word for anything, I'm a pleb that never dabbles in wild and have yet to be above rank 15.
---
It’s tavern brawl
---
Today i remembered that spreading plague was nerfed lolol. Should have been nerfed twice.
---
you try to get a big board against shaman , they either get a biggier board with desert bares+mogus+evolces or throw in there an MC tech stealing 1 to 2 of your minions and evolving that into a bigger board leaving you pretty behind. if you try to play around mc tech, the shaman will just puke too many minions+rush to clear the very few of yours and add an evolve in the end to seal the deal.legit cancer of a deck to play against with most of the decks.
---
One fucking class out of nine being played at 50%+ rates is asinine and yet it's pretty much the norm in Hearthstone
---
Lightfang is busted and should be nerfed in some way. Putting him at t6 might break him, but he at least shouldn't be able to buff more than 3 minions. Or maybe make the buff +2/+1 or +1/+2.
---
Without being allowed to play two copies of Legendary cards, hard combo disruption would just give you free wins and make combo unplayable as an archetype.
---
I feel like with each expansion, this comes up. One or two deck is really broken and overused whilst other decks can’t compete with them.
---
no the battlecry isn't triggered. It's not even a particularly strong 4 mana minion to trop from the sky golem. But the problem is that it's a 6 star minion wich means it add 6 damage to what you take to your hero when you loose. The sky golem is suposed to spawn a weaker minion just like piloted shredder and mounted raptor. But they are balanced around mana costs. The problem is that in terms of tavern tier/stars they can spawn a stroger minion. sky golem (4) -&gt;megasaur (6). mounted raptor (2) -&gt; toxfin (4)
---
I get the idea, but it seems like it's just a worse version of Lich King's hero power. Way more RNG heavy, costs twice as much, and all you get is the element of suprise &amp; a little extra health on the minion.
---
I wonder if it would be busted as a passive that says "Ressurect your last minion that dies", when it's your last minion that usually means you're gonna lose anyway, and the ressurected minion wouldn't retain any buffs. And you lose control of what gets ressurected.
---
Bold to assume any of us have more than 1 friend.
---
Seriously though, from what I’ve seen and played it’s only possible with one friend through a direct challenge.
---
Quality can be lots of things. While I do agree that the balance isn't very good, a lot of the hero powers seem pretty creative. You can always balance them afterwards.
---
"Standard *is* Hearthstone"
---
Lol ok then. Guess these other modes I'm playing must not be Hearthstone, just some other weird game made by Blizzard based mostly on their main IP.
---
This and Junkbot to T5
---
Good thing they haven't revealed any good one drops in DoD so far... oh.
---
Definitely needed a TLDR version, which I agree is summarized well with:
---
Evolve should go back to Wild; HS leaders are silly for intentionally reimplementing and leaving Evolve in Standard when they already knew it would be and have tons more data now to prove that it is OP. 
---
I have two possible explanations:
---
1) HS leadership want newer players to experience Evolve. You can take that as you will, either experience playing it and the RNGfiesta non-interactive experience is, or understand how OP it is so that they “appreciate” when this card goes back to Wild. 
---
2) HS leadership is intentionally sabotaging Standard so that more people play other game modes - Wild, Solo, Arena &amp; Battlegrounds. This is certainly borderline conspiracy theorist, but I can just about guarantee that more people are playing Battlegrounds because Standard is so bad right now. 
---
We (as the HS player community) cannot fix any of these problems and talking about it on Reddit will likely have minimal impact honestly, since they already know it’s broken, but don’t seem motivated enough to fix it. IMO, we have two general courses of action: 
---
1) Don’t play Standard or even play HS at all.
---
2) Play a Standard deck that counters this Evolve Shaman meta, or is just as strong: you have 3 good options here: Secret Highlander Paladin, Secret Highlander Hunter or Murloc Shaman.
---
Yeah Sniplock and secret mage needs heavy nerfs
---
I’ve been saying Blizzard can’t design well for 20 years. It took them becoming openly communist for people to notice.
---
Nicely articulated. I'm now playing eternal until the new set comes out and see if the meta change for the better.
---
I just can't play with this broken shaman meta. Even Vicious Syndicate stop updating because of this.
---
This is why they need to remove evolve mechanics from the game and never make them again. They keep making these really weird cards that only have the benefit of abusing evolve. 
---
Take Hesert Hare for example. Three Mana triple 1/1 actually sounds good for token decks. Why do the 1/1s need to literally be Desert Hare though? It would be just as powerful in most cases if the tokens were generic 1/1 beasts. They cost three Mana on board, which let's evolve roll them all the way up to 4 Mana.
---
Here is how unbelievably bad the design is. Imagine a neutral card that is 4 Mana summon 4 random 4 cost minions. That would be in every single deck and many games would come down to who drew it.
---
How long have you been saving or are you just that good of an arena player?
---
I do agree with the general idea but you don't need to act like Undertaker Hunter or Spirit Claws Shaman were more okay to make your point.
---
What a fking rant... it was always a deck that topped others...do i need to remind ppl about razakus, pirate warrior, secret paladin, hadronax ...
---
I think they did this on purpose so people would basically be forced to play Battlegrounds.
---
This isn't a valid argument. If it was, then literally no card in hearthstone would have been nerfed. Because 'everyone' has access to X, via crafting.
---
At least Hearthstone's standard isn't a 3/3 elk right now
---
Oh fucking please.
---
Resident sleeper control warrior beat smorc decks by a mile. And it wasn't even close.

Wratiprst#2868 EU 80g.
---
It actually is valid for the very reason that in Battlegrounds you have access to the same card pool as every else (RNG considerations ofcorse). In constructed on those who have invested considerable money have access to better decks.
---
I rather it get removed because its literally so strong, that you HAVE to take it if you see it early. And its not even an uncommon thing either, its probably one of the most common cards that appears.  
---
And there isn't anything wrong with Curator being the only one access to it. Nef is really good because of his hero power. The soldier character (I forget his name, but his hero power is to give a divine shields) is good because of his hero power and etc.  
---
Having a card being all tribes is just too strong to have in the pool for drafting, in this mode. Its literally everywhere  in this mode because its braindead broken, you pick without ANY thought, because it literally works with damn near every single buff card in the mode. Give it taunt and it literally does work with everything. Its just too damn powerful for battlegrounds.

No, it is not. " Its okay for something to be ludicrously broken, because everyone has access to it" is a very bad argument. Its literally everywhere in the mode because its so broken that you MUST take it when you see it. Its making the mode boring because everyone has one and you're practically always going against it. It needs to be removed, in order for the mode to not stagnate so quickly.
---
Well it's a kind of a casino thing, which is prrtty much a Hearthstone thing.
---
WHat does golden brann do ?
---
Your battlecries trigger 3 times ?
---
Thank you very much! :)
---
&gt; cool things I like like zephrys, elise, quest druid/shaman, highlander archetypes in general
---
How much do you spend on this game? Because only the rich (or those who have accumulated years of playing time and have a decent dust inventory) can afford to tastes those fun new toys. 
---
You need to understand not everyone has access to enjoy the game the way you do, with your stacked collection of toys to play with and experiment with.
---
The majority of folks are casuals that can make maybe 1-3 good decks per expansion, and that's if their lucky with their pack openings on the standard pre expansion bundle. 
---
Beyond that - this development team is proven to be lazy and lethargic when it comes to balancing, QoL updates and features, communications etc etc.
---
Team 5 is a joke. Anyone defending them is white knighting pretty hard. There's a logical reason why a good amount of people have left that team starting with brode and company. Because their leadership is horrendous. Donais and Ayala are extremely overrated.
---
Thanks!
---
Some of precedent and analogies you're grabbing for are a real stretch. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\&gt; like Undertaker Hunter and Spirit-Claws-Era Shaman - those were at least games of Hearthstone 
---
Those decks were targeted because they snowballed so early that it was uninteractive. Undertaker especially is a complete roll of the dice whether or not you have your cheap class removal in your opening hand. But by turn 4 decks have a few more options.
---
\&gt; Remember when Leeroy was nerfed for "not being fun or interactive"? How about when Patron got nerfed for the same reasons: because charge damage was deemed "not fun"? 
---
Do you not see the difference between charge minions and big boards? Big boards you can interact with...don't pretend like you cant, wtf. 
---
\&gt;  In case you don't remember, the buff patch that made Luna's Pocket Galaxy cost 5 turned games into completely silly affairs where resources didn't matter and you'd just lose 
---
Honestly wasn't that bad. Just kind of annoying high roll, kind of like the old prince 2 drop. It was a pretty diverse healthy meta. 
---
\&gt; Desert Hare/Evolve instantly drops more stats on the board than most anything can deal with by that point (and they're random minions too, making plans even harder to secure) 
---
Evolve Shaman is the most popular Shaman deck, but it's winrate isn't much higher than decks without that combo. Like Murloc Shaman. Really Shaman's just all around strong and the new cards introduced had nothing to do with it other than generate hype.
---
Remember. The meta isn't determined by what's good. The Meta is determined by what people THINK is good.
---
Intresting, could push a 6 minion build so that your minions always get double value, could also let some counter play of oppenents removing weak minions like bran to avoid playing into you
---
&gt;  it lost like 80% of its playerbase.
---
I dont know if thats true though. It may be the case for twitch viewership, but also because the first day stuff is new and everybody plays it. After a week is when you will actually get good data on if the game is played and has a decent sized playerbase. And TFT has maintained its playerbase pretty decently to be honest, nowhere close to 80%.
---
Also, for battlegrounds, they already explained they will do more patches, add more heros (appart from rebalancing them) and adding new cards (and in the future, remove other cards too, just like in TFT). With the next expansion in less than a month they will add a ton of dragon synergies for dragon strategies, and in a week or less they will add 4 new heroes.
---
I don't generally feel comfortable recommending this game to a new player just because of how much of a money trap it can become. If you have the type of personality that can really got hooked and want to collect cards from older card sets, it would be hundreds of dollars to go all in.
---
The game is more expensive that it used to be. They print strong cards with narrow uses, more class legendaries, and fewer neutral legs. There aren't as many "core" neutral cards, so forget about crafting a set of jack-of-all-trades cards to slot into tons of different decks.
---
It is absolutely possible to climb to the highest ranks as a free-to-play account, but that involves investing all your resources into one or two decks and playing those exclusively. The game is not strictly pay-to-win, but it is absolutely pay-to-have-fun with multiple decks and experimental deckbuilding. (So it can _feel_ pay-to-win in practice.)
---
I just saved from Uldum release as I knew the year end expansion is always overpowered
---
I agree, but this one couldn’t have worked out better. If certain minions were attacked before others I would’ve been donezo
---
Yeah I figured. I was always wondering how/if positioning played a role in TFT/Underlords—I could never quite understand what was going on in videos I watched—but I assumed it mattered to some degree. 
---
But seriously, one reason why I latched onto Battlegrounds so quickly was that it just made sense to me at a glance. The other games never did, even though I played Mobas before.
---
Doing that, you’re bound to lose your next three games, plus you’ll be taking a ton of damage to buff that board.
---
You’d need one hell of a comeback to pull it off.
---
Stop pre ordering every new expansion they release and they might care about making the game at least enjoyable.
---
Regardless of whether those decks are toxic, it would still be a consequence of targeting SN1p by nerfing a different card.
---
One thing that I say, over and over again, is that no matter how much people complain about RNG (and, my god, do they), it's usually more fun than something that's deterministic. Chess might be deeper, but more people play poker for fun.
---
I was obsessed with it for like 2 days. Haven't touched it since. Got to 5k and the formula is pretty solved already.
---
Exactly! I always feel that the hatred of RNG that some people have is misplaced.
---
No, we were talking about why you defended someone insulting players for simply playing snip snap, and insulting the developers for allowing people to freely "use exploits and cheatcodes" in the game, which is not tolerable.
---
SnipSnap being top tier in wild has nothing to do with our discussion in a post of someone raging over the **tavern brawl** of this week.
---
Sure, they have some big slow legendaries. But you got them down to 9 it looks like, before they stabilized. Totally normal for a hunter vs priest match. You're just a little bit of burn or silence away from having won.
---
This isn't Hearthstone, it's Battlegrounds.
---
Honestly just give up on this game. It’s entirely driven by investors and will probably only get worse with time.
---
&gt;Uldum launching with Dr Boom at 7...      
---
OK that has to be an all time negative record for me, I didn't know what you were talking about, I searched on Google and apparently I didn't even remember the name of the last expansion.   
---
Anyway I remember the last time the ladder was in such a miserable state that streamers were leaving left and right and Blizzard literally made a post saying that they were happy about the meta and they would have skipped the balance patch, they're almost comically out of touch.
---
"very strong" lol no she's worse than jaraxus
---
This is the best advice of all. I've done well in a lot of games where I had to go with a beta strategy while seeing other people lose by stubbornly trying to max out their hero synergy.
---
Indeed. Magnetic is an extremly toxic keyword in wild where you get hit for 15+ dmg in the face on turn 4 because the paladin magnetized 3 mechs on his windfury bullshit.
---
If I wanted a tier 4 minion that would be the perfect play, but I was looking for Pack leader so later on I'd sinergize him with the Rat pack and he is a tier 3 minion so I made a little different play. And also the little taunt helps protecting the Hyenas for a while.
---
[Your post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dx98ql/what_made_me_quit_hearthstone_this_right_here/) called both players and developers toxic over the **tavern brawl** of this week. I think thats why it didnt got upvoted.
---
This post talks about the wild format and actually provides arguments instead of a simple screenshot and some insults, and thats probably why it did got more upvotes.
---
I think all these issues stem from the fact that the card is magnetic. Board space would balance this card on its own but currently you can just stack this card on top of another mech or itself until you can kill your opponent.
---
Thinking Khadgar + Ghastcoiler with Taunt and Reborn (Lich King) is a viable late game strategy (spoiler: it wasn't). Reborn Ghastcoiler is really strong as a refill. But Khadgar is a really shit wizard even in this format.
---
Thing is, being a magnetic/echo is the entire point of the card. Remove that, and we have another [[warsong commander]] on our hands.
---
on paper it's a beta :)
---
Mech/Handbuff Paladin deserves a nerf in its own right anyways, so that's actually perfect.
---
How about changing out lens for time out? Maybe that's better.

how come the people who are always quick to tell a team 5 member how much they love the communication they always say, 'we,' as if they're speaking for everyone on the sub?

i don't care if team 5 communicates with the players or not - it's their discretion haha.  you don't speak for me, ThinkFree!!

Also, stop acting like this is the first time you've seen this: team 5 regularly hits up the player base on things they feel is important (note i said things TEAM 5 thinks is important, not this sub!).

Probably because the rank I’m playing atm.. this was my first day/first win so I imagine 3900 isn’t very high

4/5/4 | Battlecry: Give your Demons +1/+1.  
---
It is even a tip that shows up while in queue for BG
---
I agree with everything you've said and yesterday was my first encounter with the animation delay. Played the brawl and my opponent started snip snapping, roped, and continued laying snaps for another 5 minutes or so. I just turned the game off and haven't played again. It was such a turn off to see their turn seemingly continue indefinitely and unnecessarily on like turn 4.
---
I’d like to see more support for murlocs especially. Kindof annoying that playing them gets you only so far and then it’s just praying you live long enough for a megasaur to give poison.
---
Shed a tear for Wild please.
---
Wow, that explains so much. I've been blaming my own luck every time I reroll 20 times without seeing the card I'm looking for.
---
The problem with him being that high, is that he gets value even later on, and is oftentimes the one minion that remains at the end of the fight (due to his HP increase during it), so buffing his Damage by getting him to 6 star is probably a bad idea. especially as the 6 pool is so small, that you can reliably discover him off a golden card drop. it wont help the problem at all.
---
Exactly. Warsong Commander could've just been changed to say "play" instead of "summon". That would have removed the Grim Patron problem. Baking "can't be reduced below (1)" into the Echo mechanic would solve the problem of Sn1p-Sn4p and every other Echo card combined with cost reduction, including Glinda.
---
That seems silly as it could very easily backfire. 
---
Hearthstone on ladder is nothing like the wanna be autochess that is Battlegrounds. It feels more likely to me that if someone didn't enjoy Hearthstone, they would just play something else entirely, not just switch modes.
---
Just like in the past if Standard sucks, people don't switch to Arena or Wild.
---
I'm pretty sure the animation was removed either because it didn't work or was too performance demanding for mobile. It has always been extremely laggy.
---
You have to imagine that dragons will be added to battlegrounds when descent of dragons releases.
---
I can predict exactly what will happen during my games against shaman: 
---
Turn 1: shaman does nothing
---
Turn 2: shaman hero powers
---
Turn 3: shaman plays spirit 
---
Turn 4: evolve shenanigans, involving AT LEAST four 4-drops 
---
I can't play around it. 
---
 
---
If I play a minion before turn 4, I now have to deal with (AT LEAST) an additional 8-drop as well. 
---
If I don't play a minion, they can still play the 1 mana spell that generates two 1/1s and summon an 8-drop regardless 
---
Also, if I don't play a minion, then I'm just behind on tempo and screwed anyway
---
A recent hated memory is a turn 4 shaman that some how had four 4-drops, two 8-drops, and one 1-drop on turn 4 using coin and the minion generating spell and he had 2 mogus in his hand. All because I made the mistake of playing a minion before turn 4 (gasp!)
---
At this point I’m 100% sure that this was all calculated as a way to encourage people to play battlegrounds
---
Wow, what are the odds?
---
BTW, you should probably post this to /r/HSPulls instead; I'm pretty sure it's against the rules to post pulls here.
---
I was pretty disappointed when I found out 3 golds don't combine too.  I just expected it to like in team fight tactics on league of legends.
---
Agree that Arena is a great mode of you want to focus on the basics
---
Are you sure? Neither team 5 nor the player base seems to think so, since "it is not the strongest deck etc" 
---
 The failing from the dev teams to patch or balance this speaks volume. Haven't played wild for a month and not buying the next expansion. Will not endorse bad game design.
---
This is actually a super important point.
---
Without Amalgam and Lightfang, non-tribal strategies are obsolete.
---
Yeah, and I remember reading that "Wild will be dominated by secret paladin until the end of time", "highlander decks will just become unbeatable later because of powercreep", or same stuff with big priest, odd paladin, quest mage...
---
Id rather not get the 3rd that quickly, giving me a chance to buff the amalgams 2x instead of 1x a few times until the board is fuller.
---
It's in the battle.net shop too. -&gt; Hearthstone -&gt; Wild Only -&gt; Claim Free
---
Do the same analysis by tier. Demons and murlocs are a Tier 1/2 strategy, whereas beasts is a Tier 2/3 strategy. Mechs is Tier 3/4. 
---
(lightfang and zoobot not counted in synergies; amalgam is counted in each category)
---
By tier:
---
||Murlocs/Synergies|Demons/Synergies|Mechs/Synergies|Beasts/Synergies|Total|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Tier 1|3|2/1|2|2|12|
---
|Tier 2|3|2|7|5|16|
---
|Tier 3|3|1/2|5|1/2|17|
---
|Tier 4|1/1|1|5|2/2|14|
---
|Tier 5|1/1|2|1|4|13|
---
|Tier 6|0/1|1|2/1|4|9|
---
minion count at each tier: 
---
 Tier 6 - 6
---
Tier 5 - 9
---
Tier 4 - 11
---
Tier 3 - 13
---
Tier 2 - 15
---
Tier 1- 18
---
Total number of each in the pool when you are at a given tier
---
|Tier 1|**54**|**54**|36|36|216|
---
|Tier 2|99|84|**141**|**111**|456|
---
|Tier 3|138|123|**206**|150|677|
---
|Tier 4|160|134|**261**|199|831|
---
|Tier 5|178|152|**270**|**235**|948|
---
|Tier 6|184|158|**288**|**259**|984|
---
Tangentially, if you're looking for a particular minion, you have 3 board spaces at tier 1, 4 at tier 2 and 3, 5 at tier 4 and 5, and 6 at tier 6. 
---
If you're trying to find a particular minion, your chance goes up as total minions/board spaces goes down:
---
||Total # minions|\# minions to choose from|ratio|
---
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Tier 1|216|3|72|
---
|Tier 2|456|4|114|
---
|Tier 3|677|4|169|
---
|Tier 4|831|5|166|
---
|Tier 5|948|5|190|
---
|Tier 6|984|6|164|
---
So if you're looking for triples, you have the best chance in order: T1,T2, T6, T4, T3, T5.
---
I love battlegrounds ... I have played since Whispers and I am so tired of ladder . I’m just hoping they don’t monetize this
---
[According to this chart](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvgdyx/battlegrounds_cheat_sheet/), there are a total of 831 minions available, 154 of which are tier four minions. Disregarding minions already picked by you or your opponents, that means that there is a ~18.5% (*roughly* 1 in 5) chance of any of the five minions being a tier four minion. The chances of each minion being tier four would be approximately 1 in 5^5 or a 1 in 3,250 (0.03%) probability. So not *as* insane as I'd thought, but still pretty rare.
---
The approximate chances of this happening with six tier **six** minions would be more like 1 in 20^6 or 1 in 64 million. The actual chances are probably going to be a bit higher (or lower) due people having other minions—but still—*very* rare. I'm sure we'll see a screenshot of it tomorrow.
---
And what will WE get, who already have it?
---
Pardon my arrogance sir. I will just shut up and play against genuine SN1Plock players in high legend or against the ones which are using 3rd party programs therefore cheating. I sure do hope to qualify to the Wild Blizzard official tournaments with my legend points because there are so many of them. And I will stop complaining about balance nerfs since Blizzard had them in Wild so consistently and explained they reasoning quite well.
---
Dont worry, team 5 also arent professionals when it comes to cardgame balancing...
---
I think the best play here is Amalgam, level up, freeze.
---
Next turn tavern up (for 7 gold), freeze.
---
Nex turn buy, Hyena, Hyena, play upgrade, discover 5 drop, if Lightfang dont upgrade Amalgam, if not Lightfang hopefully find something else that's good, like Brann, Battlemaster or Goldrin, the Great Wolf, and try to find Lightfang via Amalgam upgrade (or one of the other good things). Then just play around what you find.
---
Maybe I'm too value centric though :D
---
Realistically your board is only REALLY weak (by comparison to everyone else) for like a turn so you're paying 10ish damage to discover a win condition and you've only taken 2 damage so far, so I'd be okay to even take up to 15 damage.
---
Looks like hero card is in the deck? [I drew it next turn.](https://i.imgur.com/UJqbrK5.png)
---
Shifter Zerus.
---
Bob going through a existential crisis lately for not getting enough love
---
Shifter Zerus from their 3-tier discover card.
---
Well Echo disappears after the turn it's first used, Twinspell can be used at later turns.
---
Thats magenta man smh
---
It's a beta so its okay if everything not perfect yet and if changes happen later
---
Twinspell doesn't expire at end of turn
---
Here's an easy fix: let summoning portal override mechwarper, even if you play mechwarper after summoning portal. This way, the only way to complete the combo is with glinda + mechwarper.
---
The combo would become much less consistent and would require 9 mana instead of 5. With a thaurissan tick it could be done with  6 or 7 mana (depending on the number of mechwarpers in hand), but some stars would have to align for it to be done as early as turn 6 or 7. You would have to have glinda, 1 or both warpers in hand, and sn1p-sn4p.
---
Alternatively you could nerf mechwarper with the classic "but not less than 1" add on.
---
It summons a 4 mana minion that exist in BG, it can be any tier (eg Gentle Megasaur (6), Infested Wolf (3)).
---
I don't disagree with your primary point, and I'd say that I agree with some of your secondary points with various caveats (Shaman, my favorite class, is often given toys that become too hard to beat.)
---
However, I disagree with a tertiary point you made... &gt;!that being that Standard mode \*is\* Hearthstone. I think it's fair to say that Standard is Hearthstone's "first foot forward", especially for new players, but Wild players have a pretty strong claim to the game as well. Heck, from a sheer numbers standpoint, as of the next rotation if you don't play Wild then you're missing out on over half of the game since Wild-exclusive cards will outnumber Standard cards.  !&lt;But that's all beside the primary point you're making, don't wanna digress too much.
---
Sounds exciting!
---
Sorry bud.
---
Yeah I hardly play her perfectly. I believe she's very high tier but I play other heroes much better.
---
It would still be insane. Because any and all tribe synergy works with it. You don't have to do any critical thinking or planning. Just pick a "Give X +2/+2" and take it, to buff the Nightmare.   
---
All Tribe is too strong for Battlegrounds.
---
I say standard is the game because that's what Blizzard designs for, balances around, and supports competitively. Standard just sells more packs than Wild
---
I summons a 4-cost minion **from battlegrounds pool**. Also notice it doesn't say summon tavern-tier-4  minion.
---
Another example: Mounted Raptor, tavern-tier-2; 3-cost minion 
---
&gt;Deathrattle: Summon a 1-cost minion.
---
It summons a Shifter Zerus, tavern-tier-3; 1-cost minion
---
I tried that but kept running into rogue with  20 nzoths shuffled in
---
Initial hype and the twitch drops for early access.
---
It's no jealousy it's boredom with people that apparently can't see that there's literally a megathread for these exact posts but the mods don't care I guess, or people are stupid enough to not report it
---
[removed]
---
You haven't unlocked Wild, but your old cards have rotated to wild.
---
Level up your heroes in order to unlock wild.
---
If you can't beat em join em 😂
---
Oh I never noticed that, thanks for the tip!
---
I disagree honestly, just a major flaw with the expansion is that too many of the cards either supported doomed archetypes/ones about to rotate out like Quest Warlock, Odd Mage, Quest Hunter, Spell Hunter.
---
Maybe you should read the stickied post?
