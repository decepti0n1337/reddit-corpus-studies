Wouldn't adding another set each year make the problem worse?

Psychic scream bug, restart to fix

It is, but since it's a discover effect and discover doesn't allow duplicates, if you only have 3 dire frenzied beasts in your deck it will only draw 1.

The thing that sucks about Vas'no is that he's in the adventurer pool of bosses which means he can come in and screw you over on any chapter. At least you only encounter Gallywix during Chapter 1.

Just go second every time and coin out pocket galaxy on turn 4, 12 games in a row. EZ
---
Based on this screenshot, it doesn't look like the second (hidden) enemy minion attacked that turn in the history bar, so it would've immediately unfrozen. The only actions shown are the Zilliax being played and a Book of Specters being played. There is no action for an attack in the history bar. 
---
There's more evidence for that because you played a Taunt two turns prior, and it has only taken 2 damage (1 from the Missile Launcher each turn). If their minion had attacked, it would've had to damage the taunt an additional time, putting it below 3 health.
---
But what card are you hoping to get with Mind Vision?!
---
"Oh good a 2-drop, now I have a turn 2 play!"
---
You need a full golden deck. Using golden whizbang works too
---
Golden Mind Vision.
---
In this specific case, the priest played a golden [[Mind Vision]] which automatically converts the copied card to golden.
---
You can actually start the game with a golden coin though.  If your 30-card deck contains all golden cards, then your coin will also be golden.

---
Just for some context, you got out right around the time the game's powerlevel took a big step downward, with two exceptions: [[Baku, the Mooneater]] and [[Genn Greymane]] dominated the game pretty much all year last year. Cards in The Witchwood, The Boomsday Project, and Rastakhan's Rumble just didn't see much play while they were overshadowed by Year of the Mammoth cards and the Even/Odd decks that Baku and Genn enabled.
---
So at the beginning of this year, the superpowered expansions Journey to Un'goro, Knights of the Frozen Throne, and Kobolds &amp; Catacombs moved to wild, and Blizzard took emergency action against the odd &amp; even decks by putting Baku and Genn on an express train to wild as well, despite the fact that they should have been in standard for another year. They've also been nerfing cards left and right, and they even buffed 18 cards from The Boomsday Project. Despite all this, Rise of Shadows seems overall still better than most expansions from last year, but you should still get at least ten packs of each for a guaranteed legendary. If you get tired of opening Rise of Shadows, Boomsday is a good second expansion thanks to the strength of magnetic decks, particularly in the immediate aftermath of new expansions being released.
---
If your entire deck is golden, the coin added to your hand (If you go second) will automatically be golden.
---
For this player's case, I think it's because he used a golden Mind Vision. Golden cards that generate cards will always generate a golden copy (Golden Ysera generate golden Dream Card, golden Lich King generate golden DK cards, etcetc)

Hiya Reddit and my favorite sub, r/hearthstone! My boys, who got me into HS, wanted me to post this. I've hit 25K wins! They tell me not too many have done that!
---
I've played from day one, and am very proud of my OG Pandaria card back from month one of HS, April 2014. Hit legend three times, but for last year have just enjoyed building my own decks. Try to hit Rank 5 every month and then tweak decks to have optimal fun. I hit 25K with a custom control Shaman. Beat a control warrior for 25K. Tried to friend, but of course didn't accept. Ah well- almost famous!
---
Bonus for this milestone was that I am at Firefly Music Festival. Was in the campground this morning playing HS with my 18 year old. Our neighbors heard us, turns out they play as well. So shout out to Chris, who took a pic of my stats when I was at 24,999! Cheers bro!
---
I hit the magical 25K while chilling with some new friends at Post Malone. Good stuff.

Uhmmm, that's kinda true, a new set could just make things worse and the idea of a core set in hs clash with the nature of classic sets.  
---
Then adding things there like blizzard was thinking of might be the best way to handle this.
---
I have only faced Haro in Heroic mode, but I didn't have that much trouble defeating him, with a mostly Silver Hand Recruit themed deck no less (including some Silver Swords). I played on mobile and thus unfortunately I don't have a replay and don't remember how, but he milled himself a lot during the game, at least twice because of \[\[Army of the Dead\]\], mostly drawing spells, and maybe \[\[Doom Pact\]\] or some card draw effect, I don't remember.
---
Now the next boss on the other hand, Nozari, completely tore me a new one.

Ye, the coin toss is yust there but its fun, my favoritt to play in wild is the  shuffle 60 deck of wonders cards in to the deck... Do i usaly lose? yepp. But damn the win is tasty.
---
Iirc it will literally do nothing as long as you never play a creature. So you can weapon or burn him down or wait until you have a major power play, depending on your class.

---
It's fun to sin
---
I dont adress your points because you are telling a montly wild AND standard legend player that he doesnt play much in this meta. I probably play in this past months more than what you have played in your entire life.
---
People run ciclone in standard becausw its fun. Ciclone mage in standard is bad. Ciclone in wild is powerfull, because of quest and flamewaker. Mage is weak in standard. Ciclone is a bad card in standard right now. You get it now?
---
I opened a golden Azalina. 
---
Golden Frostmourne lets goo.
---
Time to get that 12 wins in arena!
---
I played buff warrior. It sounds weird, but it was a very good and fun deck. Final score: 7-0.
---
Great point on the hero powers
---
Gul'dan felt really unfair imo because he deals 3 damage with lifesteal. Yeah, it's a 10 cost card and it needs to be impactful but you basically got a really powerful 2 mana warlock card every turn, many warlock decks would run deal 3 gain 3 life, if they went a bit more control like.
---
Uther felt balanced but the OTK was what made the hero power good....
---
Having a 2/2 each turn is fine with the weapon alone...
---
Garrosh and Thrall both had fine hero powers, not necessarily a huge upgrade on the original but their starting effects were balanced
---
Jaina had a great hero power and a great battlecry, Rexxar was basically everything Hunter needed for slower matches, although I think more cards like him would be great to have, just not as powerful, Valeera was sort of a value based Rogue and I really love how the hero power appears then leaves, idk just it's pretty cool how it mimics the hero power as a passive. Malfurion was good, just the hero power was half of warlocks, in fact perhaps even weaker than half. Still, pretty far above then normal hero power and it was a staple in any slower Druid deck(most were slow when it was around), and finally Anduin. Amazing battlecry and great hero power(mainly with Raza)
---
I wonder which button this guy believes is the "Report" button.
---
I hate to break the news, but Ysera didn't wake up at all
---
Cards costing 5 or less shouldn't be the right description, prep was commonly used in those decks and you could play 6 or 7 cost cards twice as a result
---
However, this isn't a problem with Valeera and she's a great hero card imo.
---
He must have been intimidated by your card back
---
You drop a full hour on the elliptical each day? In the morning or what? That‚Äòs major impressive. How pong have you been doing this and how has it effected your fitness?
---
This would be great for aggressive warriors and I guess slower hunters. Many decks are limited by their hero powers
---
This is a great design concept that reminds me of Duelyst...
---
Well done! I'm a 43 year old dad that has played Hearthstone on and off since launch. My estimation of games played sits around 12,000 with a win count of 5,897. 25,000 wins is exceptional.

---
Well he has 25,000 wins. But to know how much he's played the game we need to know total matches played. At a 40% winrate, he would have played an extra 37,500 matches whereas at 60% he'd have played 16,666 extra matches to reach the milestone. Just wondering how much he has actually played!
---

---
Using the Xmas card back in June
---
keep in mind that this is my opinion.
---
I'm like that towards most player expect warriors. I get flash backs to playing my budget midrange hunter vs odd control warrior. 2 mana gain 4 life every turn, felt like the worst.
---
Probably should spend more of that time with your kids.. just saiyannnn
---
I play Odd Paladin, so I try to finish the game really quick. I know they don't have an answer until 5th turn usually, so I try to win with that.
---
If you dont follow the wild meta why talk about the wild meta?
---
Because thats basically proving what I said, that you talked without knowledge of the topic you were talking about.
---
Yes, and only if I stop playing, lol.
---
Wild typically runs a bit more high roll than standard imo, but there isn't that much difference.  
---
For example, this morning I got 2 games in before work.  Playing Jade druid, I got absolutely curb stomped by Quest Mana Cyclone mage, and then ground the soul out of an Odd paladin.  
---
Priest is typically sited as the big offender of the bunch, as Barnes and Vargoth can really push them into some insane boards, but it is one hell of a fun deck to play.
---
It does have a certain choosingbeggars-y NEXT!-nest about it
---
Thanks!  Love it!

AGGRO token druid never ever ran dk and never would its way to slow for that.
---
In that case I bet they were trying to imply that you didn‚Äôt play well enough to have earned the card back on your own.

---
Thanks!
---
Midrange hunter is an evergreen deck. It will still be around 50% win rate no matter what the expansion is.
---
Personally I like the fact that boards are quite sticky this expansion. Back in K&amp;C your board always got defiled, swiped, spellstoned, naturalized and worst of all...spreading plagued.
---
I play handlock with 2 shrieks (yes...), 2 hellfires, 2 nethers and a godfrey and I almost never die because of wide boards. I die because warlock is just bad. :-D
---
Thanks!  Onward to 50K.  Assuming HS will be around for another five years of course!

Thank you.

What happened to the coldara drake?
---
I think so.  Have gotten to 10 twice.  I arena very infrequently.  Did it a lot more earlier on.
---
Sounds good! Also congrats that's some serious dedication :)
---
Not exactly ‚Äúnew‚Äù but haven‚Äôt played in a year or so.  I used to run Jade Druid, still have most of the deck, with Bronn and Fandral.  Is it still good to run in Wild?  Was debating trying to gild it for sentimental reasons, but don‚Äôt want to waste a ton on an inherently bad deck if it‚Äôs been nerfed beyond being good.
---
Hey, congratulations. Happy to hear your run ended so successfully. Rat Trap is KnC iirc so I don't think it's in arena atm.
---
I think this arena meta is definitely better. It's certainly the best I've been doing. The bucket system means that most decks are similar power levels. So less autolosses from inferior picks
---
Here's a link of a really good video about how much cost hearthstone, I think it will help you a lot cause of it's really precise.
---
https://youtu.be/aZHma6JkJtI
---
Or bought account. Or Secret Pala/Pirate Warrior/Aggro Shaman/Hunter legend. Or just used a bot.
---
This is another reason a rotating standard set like Magic's could be interesting. Defile is such a fun card and I wish it came back in Standard from time to time. If the problem is just cost, maybe they could only rotate commons and rares
---
Can confirm. Me and multiple people on my friend list got legend with pirate warrior or aggro shaman during the gadgetzan meta once and didnt bother to do the grind again
---
Just upvoted so that this has one like.

Supposed to be five
---
Welcome!  I know when I first started out adding one or two cards to my decks made them way more powerful.  A few things to remember about climbing ranked ladder with your OWN deck. (especially at higher ranks 10-25)
---
1.  No one has your exact decklist or knows what your strategy is on turn 0.  Find ways to tech cards in to give you an edge that they won't expect.
---
2. Win streak!  Ride those streaks!  I wanted to play my own deck, which was fun but not optimal.  But with having a closed decklist and win streaks available, you can still climb with a less-than-optimal deck and a 45% WR!
---
My thoughts too.
---
Would also make sense with the release of Walking fountain. Walking fountain is substantially stronger than Al'Akir and thatswhy I think they are going to release a new Al'Akir this expansion. We will see tho.
---
Yes.
---
I play while watching Netflix about an hour or 1.5 hr.
---
It helps I am now scoring a lot using token druid and casual something like 20 wins out of 30
---
Control warrior isn't a problem for you, just hunter decks? I think you might be bad. I know you say you are at rank 5 but that could easily be a product of winning enough games in a row and playing enough games overall to account for your sub 50 winrate, plus once you lucked yourself into that rank, you can't drop rank anymore, so that explains why you aren't at 4. Yea i think we figured it out. You're bad and salty about it. You in that case you might try simply getting better.
---
I played a tempo heal priest with auchenai effects.  Was a lot better than cthun.  And auchenai + hozen healer is a hard removal no one expects.
---
If anything this brawl kinda showed that the evergreen set of basic /classic cards can be moved on from as long as there are replacements.  It was refreshing to not see those cards, though certain classes had huge gaps in their tookset. 
---
BGH alone would have made this brawl more stable feeling.
---
that's what happens when u use the yugioh cardback
---
&gt;*(...) because honestly Shadow Visions on 2 is a horrible play 90% of the time (...)*
---
Yeah but if you don't have Barnes nor Shadow Essence, it is the best card to fish for Shadow Essence with so that you actually have something to play on turn 6 and start Big Priesting. It's even worse if you have no AoE clears prior to turn 6 but hey, even that does happen sometimes.
---
Playing without the classic set was pretty interesting but it did make all the classes feel really samey. Would love to see a more refined version.
---
Actually i peaked at 4 this season and Legend overall 
---
Fuck hunters and their 80 iq players
---
Man... imagine being this mad playing the old TCGs (Magic, Pokemon, WWE, Yu Gi Oh).
---
There are some decks that might change 1-2 cards per expansion.  If you like that deck you could invest in one deck and add a card here or there over time.  I had the nasty T1 kingsbane rogue with crafting maybe one or two rares before the balance patch just by keeping cards that rotated for a few expansions.
---
Currently I am dabbling with Even Twig Druid in wild.  This was a strong deck before RoS came out but with the addition of poison seeds and a few other cards it's strong enough for me to climb to rank 5 in Wild.
---
Now if you want to play reno mage or something that is a different story.
---
One at a time is fine!
---
Tough to start nowadays, but good luck and have fun!!

Tortollan's are famous for their goldfish impressions.
---
Not only got 2 Gromm's but had the 0 mana Zap also... LOL that has to be a 1 in a million win condition.
---
This needs to become a meme.
---
Sure you did bud. That's quite an achievement for such a "high IQ" person. It's great that they encourage those with developmental disabilities, but don't be ableist. Just because you can't figure out hunter decks doesn't make those players dumb. They are the ones that *can* figure it out silly.
---
You notice how none of the pros are complaining about mech hunter? Be like them. Stop getting salty because you lost. It's pathetic.
---
You're not wrong, or an asshole, but the error is in thinking you need to buy sets in order to play Wild.
---
After you hit Play, it gives you another choice between Ladder/Casual mode.
---
played at launch for 2 weeks....stopped because I was trash at the game. 
---
picked it back up around late April to Early May and it's pretty much been the only game which can keep my attention span...I think I recently crossed over 100 wins
---
feels great
---
Also two seperate patches of nerfs then buffs spaced apart was really awesome. It made standard feel a little fresher by the end.
---
That sucks lol. He was probably just using it to draw a card.
---
I concede every warrior matchup before I see my cards, and I play big shaman, which isn't that unfavored vs warrior.  I despise everything about warrior matches, they are boring as fuck to play, and take 10 times longer than I'm willing to invest in a game.  
---
I'm also not crying about warriors...I made a snarky joke about ops post, which you interpreted as crying.  Idgaf what warriors are doing because I'm not playing them.  For the record, I feel the same way about any deck who's win condition is fatigue.  I hate fatigue as a win condition, its shit design imo.
---
Lucentbark is all I know he‚Äôs good in rn
---
Blizzard discounts cool
---
I was kinda including that as 'new content' even though its technically not, because like... it changes the way the game is played and keeps things fresh.
---
So yeah, definitely agree with you!
---
Looking forward to the rest (:
---
You got issues, bro.
---
Everything you've described for cards can be and already is done within the five-hundred-or-so cards created each year for expansion sets. \[\[Regenerate\]\] from Rastakhan's Rumble is a clear example of the sort of card you'd want to be added.
---
While it may not always be legal in Standard, it can definitely be argued no card should always legal in Standard.
---
As far as the level cap increase, I really don't care as long as these new Basic cards aren't attached to leveling up beyond sixty.
---
1000 dust is not that much, better spend it now

Awesome!  Welcome back.  The latest expansion is very good imho, and the mech buffs have kept it interesting!
---
I play lots of combo
---
Concede Priest
---
i faced it like twice total since snipsnap came out, lost once but mly hand was pretty  bad at time and dont really do anything till turn 3 and then i dint have good follow up either. And other  i coulve killed mech i believe but i dint cause i thaught i had lethal but either dint have enough and miscounted or attacked wrong through a taunt or so.
---
Sick of big priest. Always Barnes turn 4. I don't even play the format anymore purely because of this deck. It's a big problem and it would be nice for it to have balance changes so i can play my favourite format again and actually have fun

1 innervate is the latest edition and working well.  I need a replacement for beetle which is sometimes good but obviously pretty low impact.  I used to run one doomsayer as a get out of trouble card against the onslought of odd paladin, but I don't think you need it with the meta now.  
---
This deck plays like a combo often using almost all 30 cards to gain your edge.  This is a decent replay to give you an example of how it plays:

Jade Druid is the most commonly play Druid in Wild, with the highest winrate at that.
---
And Big Priest is Big Priest. Your gameplan is to play and replay big minions. It doesn't matter which ones. It doesn't matter if you have something like Infiltrator in it. It's just a speedbump for your opponent.
---
Let's see whether or not i can build one right here and now:
---
Yshaarj, Ragnaros, Lichking, Obsidian Statue. Thats the core. Now we want to replay those as much as possible, starting as soon as possible. Barnes, Shadow Essence, Ressurrect, Spellstone/Mass Ress.That's the gameplan. Replay those fuckers.
---
And now, we just fill the rest of the deck with as many control tools as we can find. There's craptons of those, because the core set of Priest has NO good boardclear, which means they've got several reaaally good ones over the course of the game. Scream, Lightbomb, Mass Confusion, Excavated Evil, Spiritlash and don't forget the good old Shadow Words. You pick some of those, according to the meta needs, then you put in Shadowvisions to either ress more fuckers or find some control tools when you need them. The rest is up to you. Meeting lot's of other big stuff? Sylvanas might do the trick. Want to stop some early giants? Infiltrator. Mechs everywhere? Some silence ! 
---
Boom, Big Priest.
---
If you have a Velen/Malygos/Mindblast OTK ,you're not playing Big Priest but Mindblast OTK.
---
One lifepoint matters
---
No.
---
Not many, and I think the decks he is good in are not necessarily "good".
---
His most recent archetype is the heal druid, with lucentbark. But that's really slow and kinda awful.
---
He isn't a bad legendary, it's just that druid at the moment isn't combo or control, and really floop is a combo/control card due to his stats being pretty terrible.
---
Floopy's not great in Token Druid (whose best minions tend to be generated through spells), which is the only Druid deck with a decent global win rate right now.  The good news is he's been good in other Druid decks in the past, and chances are decent that there will be a good deck that finds a spot for him before he rotates out.
---
They didn't give everyone two copies of each of the Classic set additions from about a year ago. Plus, the reasoning behind giving away a copy of SN1P-SN4P is partially because the card is only going to be Standard legal for about then months.
---
The replacement legendary cards by comparison will always be Standard legal, and if those four aforementioned cards are anything to go by, getting your hopes up for them might be misguided.
---
That requires netural cardds to work hahahah lol
---
blizzard unable to deal with female skin like the puritans they are
---
Northshire, Power Words, and the OTKs.
---
I'm not sure what you're whining about,
---
THIGHMANES COMIN' BOYS! HOOO WEEE
---
We removed rogue's unique playstyle that players loved and decided that she will now be played like any other class which is aggro. We believe that this is what rogue was meant to be.
---
You were given the dust when those cards rotated to HOF.
---
Sure the point is they can have those effects.
---
Agreed it is a lot of fun to have these restrictions, but not super fun just beating up on a bunch of folks just trying to get a pack ( I would just considering if I could tell the other player was not really trying)
---
Be nice if they did a longer form tavern brawl maybe monthly. And built in a mini ranking system for stuff like this.
---
It would have been pretty cool for them to add in a priest card with a nod to Zetalot for first player to hit 30k with a class. This is more like a kick in the balls
---
Yes that's exactly the point.  Basic cards are supposed to be upgraded by expansion cards.  They are not for competitive play, they are for new players to have something to use until they actually open packs.
---
This is working as intended.
---
I mean compared to Mage, Rogue, and Warrior Shaman is pretty weak at card generation so technically it's a true statement.
---
If they won't be played they might as well be non existent. We managed to live with few cards missing from the basic set.
---
Really want another hero card
---
What bullshit.  I loved playing OTK priest with Velen, Maly, and Mind Blast.  All we‚Äôre missing is a way to reduce the spell costs and it would be semi playable again.  
---
Vanish has also been a staple forever as a way to not instantly die to more aggressive decks if they manage to flood the board.  Is rogue supposed to just concede now when we go against mages playing a Kadgar deck?
---
Most people talking about board clears.
---
Me on the other hand is looking if they have lethal
---
Priest new basic card 1 mana heal 5
---
What is this flaming pile of garbage? Did Blizzard just plug their ears screaming ‚ÄúLA LA LA WE CAN‚ÄôT HEAR YOU LA LA LA!‚Äù while literally every priest player in existence moaned about the abysmal classic set.
---
8 mana anyfin can happen. It isn't even worth considering.
---
I'd concede to them.
---
Same
---
Limitations arent things the class cant do like weakness, they are things the class does, but not often. Dr. Boom is one set that will rotate out so it is inline.
---
As for Naturalize, I only realized after I wrote that, that Blizz was referring to Standard only. I still think it should be changed though.
---
Card draw was listed as a limitation not a weakness. Hunter doesn't have any lifesteal minions.
---
Try changing beetle for the spell that summons 2 dryads. Removes the low roll of oaken summons plus has more total stats and slightly better with moss giant
---
Their understanding of all the classes baffles me.
---
&gt; Shaman: Weak at card generation.
---
Also shaman (with hagatha and underbelly angler): my hAnD iS TOo fUll
---
&gt; Mage Limitations:¬†Minion swarms
---
LMAO WHAT? Khadgar called.
---
then play wild
---
&gt; Ew. Look at all those new cards to a classic "evergreen" set that isn't supposed to change
---
You got refunds when they were HOF'ed. New cards are garbage you won't need to craft them anyway so I fail to see why you are whining.
---
Oh for fooks sake. Everywhere I go, I get reminded.... Give me something for the pain and let me die before I piss MESELF......
---
In no way is that true, this would be a terrible standard meta and rotating in old sets would be a great way to piss off your new base.
---
I stopped playing with the rogue nerfs and when I saw this I was hoping for some interesting cards that might make me wanna come back but all I got was reprints and few laughs.
---
I started playing right after they released Whispers of the Old Gods. 
---
I've played a lot of CThun priest at first, but started playing Rogue after I opened a Malygos.
---
But I do play other classes, I have most of them golden, the only ones missing being Hunter and Paladin.
---
&gt; I'm not playing this game anymore
---
I'm glad too.
---
Well , mage cant really swarm outside of conjurers, and Kadgar (counting Kadgar since the other summon spells are not really that smarmy with out duplicating it) and the power level of the other summoning are rather weak compared. Also if you look at their definition 
---
&gt;Limitations:¬†These are aspects that might show up a few times in a class, but they are very limited in power level and the number of cards.
---
It pretty much fits , again the problem with most mage swarm deck is just conjurers giant.
---
i thought this was murlock , not dragon for some reason xD
---
Am i the only one disappointed? This is the most generic legendary they could come up with.
---
Yeah, but not in those amounts. Shaman has hand size issues with Hagatha, infinite Murlocs with Angler, Spirit of the Frog, Kragwa, and that's just the cards played in playable decks. It's not like it's Hunter or Rogue and their 0 healing.
---
That priest replacement card is so garbage holy crap. Can anyone help me out with identifying how this card would actually be any good?
---
Yep, I think the first time I caught on wasn't in Warlords of Draenor where he first owned the role but when I read a YouTube comment for Khadgar's Harbinger episode pointing it out.
---
Felt a bit guilty about that one.
---
All I know from this announcement is I'm insta-crafting Golden Brightwing, goddamn that art is so cute!!
---
Agreed, god damn they are so fucking lazy.
---
Haha classic card will still go hall of fame if they want to use the card design on new cards. Don't put too much on hope on using it forever. I will still use kel thuzad in wild so no point to craft the same card again.
---
Pretty boring card. How many add a legendary or transform to legendary cards are we gonna get.
---
Source? Last i checked (4 days ago) all the top pogo rogue decklists ran 2 copies of vanish
---
No it does not , it fits the definition of
---
And also the card with out giant is not that big of a deal
---
Yeah that's a good point, rogue is pretty littered with extra 1/1 lackeys just sitting around right now waiting to get poisonous, so giving 1 poison and developing a 3/3 isn't bad. 
---
The real question is if rogue needs that when they already have sap and vendetta. There might be a world though where he can steal hench-clan's spot for tempo over value/adaptability+vendetta.
---
Holy Shit.
---
I feel bad for Zetalot. He's the only person who's still using Mind Blast....
---
Just to address some common comments I'm seeing in this thread:
---
1. I'm pretty sure that while elements of these class identities may have been in the back of the devs minds for a while, it was only more recently that the devs sat down and fully fleshed them out. Part of the journey they've taken to get to this point has been printing cards outside of these restrictions and realizing that it was a mistake. So yes, you can probably point to a couple cards in each class that don't fit within the identity for that class- that's what prompted the devs to make this post. They've seen how warped the metagame becomes when one class excels in too many areas (Shamanstone, Druidstone, etc.) and want to avoid doing that in the future.
---
2. The new cards are supposed to be fairly weak. They're trying to make cards that can be in standard indefinitely without causing balance issues/stale metagames. If the cards were really strong, they'd show up in a lot of decks and would possibly have to be rotated to Hall of Fame, which defeats the whole point of adding them in the first place. That said, the new SI is very playable. Secret hate is something that was missing from the classic set, so this is a welcome addition.
---
And just to address some specific things- My understanding is that the word "limitation" in this context means "they can do it, but in small amounts". So yes Northshire Cleric is a good draw card for Priest, and PW: Shield is a good cantrip, but you'll notice there aren't really any other Priest cards that draw cards, and we're unlikely to see many more. It's possible they eventually decide to HoF Cleric because it can be an insane draw engine as it is in the Nomi deck, but they're probably hesitant because 1. It's a card that reward you for healing, which is very much in keeping with Priest's identity. 2. It's another basic card they'd have to replace.
---
To quote myself from above:
---
&gt;(Priest) didn't even get an OP Twinspell like the other classes did, because FLAVOR is more important than game design in Hearthstone.
---
So, the fact that the design team felt like it made more sense for Lazul to be a Priest meant that the Priest class was DENIED access to a powerful spell mechanic, despite powerful spells supposedly being one of the strengths of the class. Because **flavor** was more important than balancing the classes or sticking to class identity.
---
You're trying to undermine my complaint with exactly the thing I'm complaining about happening. The priority should be giving classes the tools they need to succeed. Priest has always been the dumping ground for cards from the expansion gimmick, and the decks have never been good and rarely seen more support. 
---
It took from BRD to MSG to make Dragon Priest a thing. C'thun Priest was never more than a bad version of C'thun Warrior. In Un'goro it got a few elementals and never saw more support. And here, the spell-based class with no tempo and limited class minions gets excluded from the Twinspell mechanic just because Lazul didn't look more like one of the other remaining classes.
---
I mean hunters have card generation as their weakness as well but they have a plethora of 1 mana card generating beasts.
---
The only point I see similar is that hunter cards can only generate spells/secrets and beasts. Shaman cards can only generate murlocs/totems/elementals and spells. I'd say that's more of a limitation than a weakness tho...
---
How has noone mentioned kelthuzad
---
More importantly, they just buffed pogo. Seems odd to do that if they hate it
---
Every couple of weeks I try to make a barista deck with all the dragon matters battlecries.  Add it to the pile!
---
we get it ur thirsty
---
Thank you, vanish was a horrible card to see discovered when you finally stabilize against Aggro rogue
---
Maybe we just don't see the big picture, like they do  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I mean, they went through the trouble of differentiating between "limitations" and "weaknesses", so they certainly could have just put that under limitations if that's what they meant. I'm also not sure it being conditional makes it a weakness. If shadowform turned all healing effects in the game into direct damage effects and all of them said "any hero" instead of "your hero", it'd be tough to argue that face damage is a weakness for priest, even if it's situational or takes work to function. The fact is that two of the best (and currently two of the only) infinite value generators in the game are in shaman. Not to mention the fact that shaman is definitely top half of classes, if not top 3 or so, at card draw. That's not to say that shaman is any sort of an issue currently, obviously, but their description of shaman class identity is hilariously at odds with both classic and current card design for shaman.
---
*look how they massacred my boy*
---
I honestly never used Mind Blast as I've always favored a control priest archetype, but I only wish the new card was heal a friendly character and not just a hero
---
All I saw was there's a cool new brightwing card.
---
I'm so happy to have another card that deals what my hero power already does smiley face
---
The ability to choose the best of 3 cards with Messenger Raven makes it better by far than Brightwing at reacting to boardstates.
---
Why is dad in quotes? Your kids die or something?
---
Nah, ever since that one rainbow haired androgynous human joined Team 5, they are extremely cautious to not trigger fat girls.
---
Hint: OG Whitemane triggers fat girls.
---
it cant get a twinspell. twinspells where for the classes defending dalaran.
---
To be fair, I posted it first, so it wasn't really a "repost".
---
I the rule of thumb is: if it‚Äôs you who plays it, it‚Äôs a chicken, if it‚Äôs your opponent, it‚Äôs king crush.
---
the point is exactly that they are bit on the weak side, so that they dont become staples in decks forever. Also that they don't limit design space in the future.
---
This specific set of set sure but roating in old sets would be great shake up meta ad in legacy support maybe just make this a third type of play mode then If standard new players would be hurt
---
Tbf, holy light can heal friendly minions, so it wouldn't be a direct power creep.
---
So Shadow Priest isn‚Äôt an aspect of Priest that they want to reflect... that‚Äôs kinda bullshit.
---
Yeah but here's the thing. Brightwing is a legendary minion that generates legendary minions. In 99% of decks its just straight up better to run the legendary you want instead of Brightwing. It costs the same to craft, you can only run 1 Brightwing anyway and it's more consistent. With raven discover gave it more flexibility and only choosing from mage minions meant you'd more than likely get something playable from it. Brightwing is full random and chooses from all legendary minions (most of which are pretty underwhelming). Like if you got Nat or cho or even malygos in a deck with few spells. Brightwing is pretty much just pack filler. Which would be fine if it wasn't a legendary minion.
---
this will only hurt until you die :)
---
ur whining.
---
(smash cut to my deck with a card back drawn on them in crayon)
---
Come on, man! This is the real deal!
---
That druid one seems at least as bad.
---
Will also be a huge card for arena.
---
Priest is the best class at drawing cards in the game atm in practice, and it was definitely top 3 at it in classic. You can only say that card draw is a limitation of priest if you don't actually read what cards priest has.
---
Yeah I don't know what they were thinking lol
---
Defile and Psychic Scream, our valiant heroes against the token decks :/
---
NotForBan#2322 EU
---
Looking for a 80g Quest trade
---
gotta give incentive for people to buy only the latest expansion, we cant be having good cards in classic.
---
Priest's class identity is having a garbage-tier evergreen set.
---
Its a strange thing, im normally all for this kind of thing, sexuality doesnt have to be the only thing selling a product, and exploiting the fact that most players are men BY exploiting womens sexuality is gross.  But lately I've been feeling uncomfortable with the removal of it too.  It feels like less of a "lets make women not just objects" and more of a "women arnt allowed to be sexy in games anymore" kinda deal.  Its such a small thing, it really doesn't matter, but its been tickling the back of my brain lately.
---
People are going to riot over other people getting nice things though.
---
Yes, that will definitely cause someone to win the game
---
If it was better stated you would see it in most decks.  They really don't want another Rag or Sylvanas.
---
That particular claim is far less ridiculous than others they made about class identity. Mage decks do not usually have the ability to fill their boards with minions in the same way than Paladin, Shaman or Druid.
---
Malchezaar was the only reason my friend stayed. He was a newbie at the time, and didn't have anything, so I bought him ONiK - and he fell in love with all the fun and cool cards Malchezaar got him, sharing some really absurd stories with a smile on his face. He later stated that he was on the verge of quitting, but this one card allowed him to see the game for the light-hearted fun that it is.
---
Random leggies are exciting for new players. While I as a vet with a huge wild collection am really tired of the stuff, I can't stress enough just how healthy they are for the playerbase. Brightwing is stupid good: he's not strong enough to be a meta card, but he's an actually viable fringe choice newbies will surely enjoy while discovering the game and all the cool and exciting card texts there are.
---
Screw the new priest, druid and possibly pala cards, tho. I get it that basic cards should be weaker, but not totally useless, come on.
---
Yea idk why people are playing it off. Comparable to Bronze Herald except it's neutral. Priest no longer has secret agent coming through and warrior doesn't have any card generating dragons. Seems really good
---
The idea is that it gives a way for people to play with legendaries that they otherwise wouldn't be able to
---
Yes please, reverse the nerf to Clemency and High Inquisitor. Wait wrong sub.
---
&gt; Northshire cleric and mass healing word/circle of healing that accomplishes this, but still
---
Wow, classic cards that are a strong card draw engine. Sure sounds like a limitation to me!
---
prep exists. 4m for a complete board clear is too good (as judged by blizzard). We saw something similar with the equality nerf. pally had a good way to reset the board for 4m and it got bumped up to 6. 
---
We have also seen vanish be a problematic card in the past. Particularly in quest rogue, it was very disheartening to be playing anything but a face deck against them in large part because vanish just blew away any incremental advantage you might have gained. (while letting them replay several 4/4's. many with charge.)
---
You're probably right... nerfing "damage" in priest is stupid, specially when the GOAL OF THE GAME is to deal damage... and to be honest... priest can't heal as well as paladin, can't do damage, doesn't have amazing spells like mage, doesn't have early game, relies on silence because some idiot tought that made sense when actually giving crappy minions a bad effect just to make priest usable is something that should not exist.
---
The point is, there are many Basic cards that are played way more often than Mind Blast or Vanish. Literally every single Hunter deck since Hearthstone released uses Animal Companion, for example.
---
I think your guarantee is bullshit, because that's not even what Blizzard states as their motivation. They said these two are not "in flavor" for Priest and Rogue.
---
an easy way to promote sales and advertise legendaries
---
You could put it at 8 and it might not see play.
---
Its always been pretty crap. That's the issue. When you draw well and stick a minion its not a fun deck to play against, but the rest of the time its not a fun deck to play cause you're just holding your dick hoping you draw what you need.
---
Its meta warping because it limits the draw options and minion options they can add to priest too. a cheap spell tutor card would make the deck oppressive, but a cheap spell tutor card would be amazing in priest otherwise.
---
It is, but feeling no emotion is somehow even worse.
---
Some advantages over KT:
---
1. Better for Rush/Charge minions.
---
2. 1 Mana Cheaper.
---
3. Cannot be counteracted by some Secrets, like Potion of Polymorph or empowered Explosive Runes.
---
Is it straight up better? Not at all. But being 1 Mana cheaper when you don't expect KT to survive longer than a turn anyway makes me think this card has some real feasibility. So long as it is correctly facilitated, of course.
---
It seems like they want rogue's strategy to be "concede the instant you're even a tiny bit behind on tempo"
---
Are you me?
---
Legendaries and randomness is the most possible entertainment achievable. What do you not find boring then? You want to play with vanilla Boulderfist Ogres, play braindead aggro curvestone or broken minion that deals 10 damage post turn ten and has rush (might as well be 100 damage). Or you would be pleased with 3 mana 3/3 Battlecry: add an Elven Archer to your hand? How is this mechanic boring???
---
&gt; Priest always are slow at getting on board and have a hard time finishing.
---
Sounds like a review from Blizzard employees' wives.
---
Hey buddy, what did your mother and I tell you about using potty words on the internet? I know you feel really strongly about this and it's really important to you, but I think you need a time out to take a breath and calm down.
---
Rediance can avoid spellbender OMG
---
Cards in expansions get much more wiggle room when compensating for their class' weaknesses as their presence in Standard is, on the whole, fleeting. Spreading Plague as just one example was fine specifically because it was an expansion card rather than an evergreen one.
---
Strong evergreen cards will always see play, and it's best for them to be middling in power so they are added to supplement current standard decks more so than to be the base of them. Having classic and basic be the base of all decks in Standard is the quickest way to make the game stale. It's just a ploy to sell packs.
---
It being 7 compared to 8 is pretty huge. There are way more high impact 6 costs than 7 costs and it can possibly dodge stuff like Twisting Nether for a turn.
---
Big 6 drops that come to mind that are really good to res a turn earlier are like Mechanical Whelp, Damaged Stegadon, Highmane, Scribe. Probably more
---
THIS! Priest gets overnerfed in the classic set to compensate a third expansion, then that expansion rotates out and we're left with overcosted cards. Literally warrior has a better heal mechanic for heroes in armor and priest basically has dead cards that would be effective if this was other game or something.
---
Now you can pay 2 more mana for +1/+1!
---
There aren't many good combos. But while there are not many pure OTK decks outside of Holy Wrath Pally, there's a lot of smaller combos. Mountain Giant + CC, Pogos, Divine Spirit + Inner Fire, Nomi decks. These are kinda the new type of combo decks Blizzard is pushing. You just need to view what defines a combo deck differently.
---
The way they've been going about "rebalancing" the base sets, it seems like they want all classes to be like Priest has been: praying for good expansion cards so the class can actually show up on ladder past rank 15.
---
Why would you rotate it now? If they want priest to be a slow, grindy, control class, why would you not wait to rotate the cards that contradict that until you, you know, printed some slow, grindy, control cards for priest?
---
nice writeup
---
Look at those cards again and check to see if any of them are Classic or Basic.
---
And having a weakness in a particular aspect doesn't mean a class cannot get any, especially when most of those are generally weak cards.
---
They have repeatedly nerfed Leeroy, and right now he basically only sees play in Tempo Rogue, so he seems like he's in an alright place. I don't think Pogo Rogue even plays him either even though it has bounce effects, so I'd say that's probably a good metric to say he's fine for now.
---
We are only the ninth class in terms of best decks, maybe they are hinting about killing anduin once and for all to make space for a better class?
---
Compared to Furious Ettin, the card isn't that bad at all. -1 Health for a lacklustre effect, but also very notably it is a Demon. In Standard, that tag doesn't mean too much for a big Demon (you certainly aren't looking to combo this with Impferno), but if there are any new big-Demon beneficial effects in the future like Skull of the Man'ari or Possessed Lackey, you can bet this card is a reasonable consideration.
---
Also worth noting that Bane of Doom gets a high-roll buff with the addition of this card. I mean, you'd want Doomguard instead, but this is still a solid Bane of Doom outcome.
---
It sounds like a more recent decision. TBH I never even heard of "generation" as a thing for Hearthstone classes until they decided Shaman was supposed to be bad at it a couple of months ago.
---
In that case, what does class identity mean? If expansions are allowed to print cards that give classes stuff that goes against their class identity, why even bother having the concept?
---
Devourer broken AF mana-cheated
---
Oh Im 100% with you there, however it could be a fun deck, which i suppose is what i am most often after i like trying to make stuff work, might also be why i am just in rank 15-6 but yeah its way too slow in the more competitive ranks 5-legend, the new cards aren‚Äôt that good overall but Hey since they are coming we might as well try to use some of them somehow, My thougt was mostly that it is a 5 mana +18/+18 buff when you pull it off which just feels good, but yeah it is very conditional in its usage and too slow in the competitive scene
---
That guy who got 30 000 Priest wins is insane, how did he do it with such a bad class...which Blizzard are somehow making even worse. Great job!
---
They were doing fantastic things this year but this update is abysmal IMO.
---
&gt; enabled too many broken combos. 
---
Most revolves around mind blast (gone) or divine spirit/inner fire (which he specifically asked to be gone). I don‚Äôt see the problem.
---
He can't do that! Shoot him or something
---
The new cards are pretty fucking dumb and won‚Äôt see play over same cost options. No more mill rogue and mind blast priest. I play wild so who really gives a fuck what cards they HOF. The new cards do look stupid as fuck though.
---
As exhibited by the disproportional shoulder to chest ratio and exagerrated Levator Scapulae and Trapezius, this is not a male form that can be achieved without extensive use of anabolic steroids and years of exercise.
---
Promoting this unhealthy, unrealistic and unreasonable image of the male form in a game largely played by adolescent males creates a detrimental internal body image that could push players to seek to emulate this form, therefore resulting in steroid usage and extensive time spent at the gym.
---
This is not appropriate for a video game, especially one as widespread and popular as Hearhstone.
---
I am sure I speak for many when I kindly ask that a shirt be drawn on Malfurion. Or at the very least put some functional armor on him to cover his extremely detailed nipples and rippling abs.
---
And maybe that other dragon will also generate more dragons!
---
Pairing Inner Rage with Hellscream is a pretty effective use.
---
While I agree on your point on variance, there are countless other possibilities different from random legendaries.
---
You forgot Far Sight
---
That is not a staple in big priest. He's way worse than Muerte
---
Don't they do this already?  What's the difference?
---
Yo dawg I  heard you like dragons
---
&gt; game-winning amounts of healing
---
You seem confused about how the game works
---
Nailed it
---
Control deck doesn't mean "100% reactive deck" also Priest sucks at control because they don't have sustainability.  Look at Warrior for example, without the "all mechs gain rush" effect that Dr. Boom provides, control warrior would be garbage. Try playing the control warrior deck with all of its removal and armor gain minus the rush minions and see how horribly it loses (aka look at any control warrior game where they don't draw Dr. Boom).  Then compare it to Priest, a class with no rush minions and no armor/healing above 30HP.
---
This card is a worse \[\[Iron Hide\]\]

You're getting triggered by lack of pants though, which is just as bad.

I love druid as a class but straight up believe that spreading plague doesnt belong in the game.If you enjoy playing spreading plague ,solitaire is probably a better option for you than hearthstone.
---
I'm definitely not though. Where did I say I gave a shit whether or not the card art is scantily clad?
---
I think you‚Äôre focusing too much on the word powerful. I think the keyword in that description is baseline.
---
400 dust.
---
&gt;At least we still have HotS Whitemane.
---
HotS Whitemane is perfection.
---
Is healing really enough of a weakness for hunters? Most other classes have ‚Äúhealing‚Äù as weakness but they also have 2 or 3 OTHER weaknesses...
---
Why can‚Äôt AOE removal be a weakness for hunters? Remove Explosive Trap from standard so they can keep Frozen trap, Hunters Mark, Deadly Shot. And perhaps nurf Release the Hounds so it works more like Spreading Plague did. Something like ‚Äúsummon a 1/1 hound with Charge, If your opponent has more minions cast this again.‚Äù This would at least make beats nuff synergies with other cards less powerful if your opponent floods the board. Same could be said for Multi-Shot but it‚Äôs mana cost makes it weak for early board control.
---
You are exactly the person I made this post for :)
---
Kel'Thuzad is still one of the strongest printed cards in the game. It basically wins adventures and dungeon runs by itself. Kel'Thuzad lacked because every deck during that period was *VERY* fast. and utilized things that got hall-of-famed and fixed faster, such as Grim Patrons and Force of Nature/Savage Roar or undertakers leper gnome. This doesn't reflect poorly on Kel'Thuzad himself, it's just that decks with Sludge Belcher and Kel'Thuzad were much less efficient than just going face with cards like power overwhelming and arcane golem.
---
The fact that you are taking that side of the argument in the first place. Regardless, you've now hit the 5 downvote limit, so to the ignore list with you!
---
I'm just glad they don't have to reprint it every two years anymore (Kezan Mystic, Eater of Secrets, Chief Inspector...)
---
Are you talking about *[Drive to Work](https://pca.st/dZ163A)* or another one?  Definitely a good listen if you're into *Magic: The Gathering*.
---
Trump doing the licky-licky eh boy
---
That is a good point. The class structure of Hearthstone somewhat limits their design when they make a class-specific mechanic (like Bombs).
---
I dont think you really get what "powerful" means.
---
Save your breath. You're talking to the company that bans the Okay hand signal because a few jokers on the Internet made a hoax about it being a white supremacist symbol. If a few SJWs tweet at them that women should cover up, they'll immediately hire artists to put every woman in a burka.
---
This card existing is a nerf to Druid.
---
The thing I‚Äôve learned about Onyxia is that most of the time the board will be wiped, in the games where it doesn‚Äôt get wiped, pretty much any big minion probably would‚Äôve done a better job than her.
---
I‚Äôm probably a bit biased with Deathwing, since I love his animation, but the worst thing about him is usually just that he takes up a spot in your hand. How bad that is really just depends on the deck, in a meta with really heavy control decks I‚Äôd argue he‚Äôd be playable.
---
Caverns of time maybe? That is also in a desert.
---
Don't you think this card requires little buff?  
---
My first opinion; could be it's ability changed to the Discover. You could think it'll be powerful but, it's actually like Madame Lazul.   
---
Second is the make it's health to 3. At least it'll be OK 3 mana body.  
---
Why i'm saying that, this card is has a place on Tempo Dragon decks. They haven't any 3-mana dragon drop. This can fill that gap and worth the playing that deck. Remember, we all played Priest because of Drakonid Operative. We all played Dragon Warrior because of the Alexstrazsa's Champion etc. This must be the card like them, i'm playing this deck because of the Brightwing.
---
I'm questioning your comment more than anything

Oh wow, I'm stupid. Sorry

wow.. thats not cool... reported!

Fucking idiots as usual who don't even play the game or watch gameplay I'm sure. In before we get patches to fix whatever this breaks as well.
---
Cry for your pixel thighs more
---
I started playing actively around December when Rastakhan released, mainly a low budget Elemental Shaman deck, and cards like Earthen Might really helped me enjoy that deck because I could use it on a Firefly or a Menacing Nimbus and suddenly I received an Electra Stormsurge for example. It's really, really good for new players.
---
God. The new priest card is worse than [[Binding Heal]] AND [[Flash Heal]], and both of them were mediocre at best. 
---
I wish they had put Shadow Visions into the set instead. It was super interesting, it is one of the most 'priest' cards I can think of, it helps address their major weaknesses from the classic set, and it isn't busted with radiant, psychic scream and mind blast all being in wild now.
---
At least the legendaries and the neutral secret tech look good. But the rest... the rest is trash
---
Yeah but then we'd have to play HotS lmao.

---
There's plenty of shadowy cards in priest. Hell mind blast is an actual spell in the game hearthstone is based off of. It doesn't make any sense to me to remove a card from a class that is not doing good right now.
---
hmm okay, probably dust my non-goldens. Can't argue with a bit of free dust.
---
I disagree entirely. WoW priests have normal cleric style gameplay and shadow/evil-cleric style gameplay. Mind blast was very much in line with priests identity.
---
It gets even better with Luna's Galaxy.
---
Not a druid ability in WoW
---
I might be wrong about this, but I think Paletress was supposed to represent Chastity while Sally represented Lust. Which is why she didn't get pants. Yes, Paletress already has art but make no mistake, they can change it.
---
Is isn‚Äôt too powerful, but blizz hates priest apparently
---
We've been playing around Brawl in the same way for 5 years, it's getting tiresome. How you play around Mass Hysteria or Dragonfire Potion is different and I think it's a positive that we have to think about things differently each year rather than playing the same game.
---
Honestly, if you want to be established Murloc or Minion Swarm decks.
---
you cannot help but create minion generation card or something.
---
I cannot believe you guys put minion swarm as a weakness for warrior when In fact they‚Äôre one of the strongest class if not the strongest with dealing with it. How the hell are you guys going to remove mind blast when Priest is barely even in the game right now but you don‚Äôt nerf or hanger warrior a bit. They have warpath Brawl Super collider Dr Boom buffs the mechs that already are good at removing minions with the one treat deals 5 damage separately to non mechs and omega devastator for big mechs. I don‚Äôt even want to get started on shamans weakness not actually being their weakness either.
---
5 cards creating 7 minions. Such a swarm class.

---
Discover isn't a keyword in classic or basic sets though
---
It does what Mindblast does. Mindblast is being replaced by Radiance in the Basic set. It's a joke.
---
She's a lot better than KT. But then again KT was absolute trash. I think this will see play in Warrior because of the rush, but not much more.
---
Yeah you're right, I guess faerie dragons are just a little derpy
---
Yeah sure and just ignore the first part of what he said. Also, I guess hunter is good at card draw since starving buzzard is a strong card draw engine.
---
Sadly :[
---
I really just wish it could be something original or unique, but maybe basic/classic cards shouldn‚Äôt be that.
---
When the newspost came out I kept reading "died this turn" as "died this game" on this card and was so confused why people weren't freaking out. This makes a lot more sense.
---
Problem is choose one is Druid only
---
This is revisionist history
---
Let's be real Mind Blast was only ever run in unfun to play against combo decks that rely on constantly resummoning velen and maly until you run out of answers and then double MBing your face for 40+
---
Jaraxxus is fine, as are most of the DKs (Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Shaman, Druid, Priest, and Rogue)
---
Healing is a weak mechanic in all card games without proper tools to benefit from it. A win at 1 hp and a win at 30 make no difference.
---
they already tried that with shadowreaper anduin
---
Being against something doesn't mean I have personal feelings about it. You're trying to find something where there isn't.
---
Oh don't worry, I was a victim. Awful times those were.
---
Taunt is the push there I think. You get value equal to Mark of the Wild (Better, as it costs 1 card over 4) with 4 minions, and that can delay face damage. Will work fine in Treant druid I imagine, possibly as a niche pick for midrangey token druids.
---
She's actually playable in Hots.
---
Do you find the pixels in the orginal post "hyper-sexualized"?

yeah she i literaly famous only for her sexy look, they just butchered her, other character could have been a better option
---
If your board clear is situational, you don't have a board clear at all. You people should've learned that after years of FoUr MaNa FlAmEsTrIkE.
---
shadowreaper had nothing to do with shadowform really and was just a straight up better version of it in voidform he had.
---
I wouldnt call anduin shadowform support whne only intreaction he has with it is making his hero power worse
---
My comment was specifically referring to interaction with Ysera...so I don't know why you felt the need to say that.
---

---
I see...
---
I saw this and knew I'm probably not returning to Standard at all. Holy shit I expected a bad card for priest but not that bad.
---
the audiences has nothing to do with it, both are constantly updating TCGs that from time to time update their archetypes as the game evolves
---
Sinister strike has seen play in maly rogue decks and war song commander was initially strong enough to warrant a nerf

People like you are the reason I have to sit through twenty minute games where an opponent gets 90% through the rope ***every, single, turn***, because you're *literally not paying attention.*
