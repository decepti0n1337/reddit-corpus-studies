hearthstone isn't a skill based game... it used to be a fun game if that helps?
---
Not trying to change your opinion but a while ago he did say in a video that he’s not actually cocky, just really sarcastic which comes off as cocky as he says cocky things in his monotone voice. It’s a type of personality you either like or don’t but no one is actually as conceited as toast pretends he is.
---
Essentially, cards you set aside as a part of your deck but not in it, and when you begin a game - before drawing - you can swap some of those cards with the ones in your active deck

I'm just not going to play card games? I think i'll live

It still is fun, your opinion can be different and that’s fine. But don’t waste your time on the HEARTHSTONE Sub if you’re just gonna bash it
---
Gwent arena pre-Gwent 2.0 was the best experience I've ever had in a card game. Unfortunately new Gwent just lacks the depth of gameplay that old Gwent did, and the minimalist visual style got too cluttered for my taste.
---
This or they will reduce the impact of omega cards maybe. If anything Omega Devastator might be increased in cost so you can only play one a turn, which I agree with. It should be a 6-7 mana card. It's so swingy otherwise. Especially when you give it rush.
---
*Astounding!*
---
That's what it seems, I'm wondering if they just say "x legandary" and really arent. I'm not ranked in this xpac yet, but I  know there is no way the decks posted are breaking the top 10k.
---
I mean it’s certainly part of his persona in HS. He basically has a 0 strike policy. Bans people randomly. And tbh chat is wrong 99.99% of the time when they try to correct him. But i admit I’ve seen him misplay like single digit times the entire time I’ve been watching him (when he had the mask on still). 
---
I’m not here to convince you to like toast lol, just my POV.
---
I get a feeling that guys like Toast really don't enjoy Hearthstone at all anymore but simply can't walk away because, well, look at the numbers he gets on these videos which no more effort than just streaming Hearthstone. They're making serious money but you can only fake your interest level in something so much. I even get that vibe from Mr Positive Energy Kibler a little bit, of all people. I think they're all burned out.
---
why? most of the design team go on this sub, how are they going to know they're assholes if i don't mention it?
---
no, you should craft a budget deck with a proven positive winrate

How are they assholes? For not fixing a format that they said they wouldn’t fix?
---
The fact one of his arms is broken is kind of weird
---
I made a post about this (it went unnoticed). Goblin Lackey rush buff doesn't stay on copy effects. Same thing happens if you faceless manipulator a minion buffed by Goblin Lackey.
---
Exactly, this isnt "spagetti code" or an inconsistency. It may be unintuitive or not how you think it should work but trying to argue that this is laziness or incompetence on Blizzard's part is not accurate or helpful criticism in the slightest.
---
The math checks out.
---
Well, I mean you can't say a man who got famous for wearing a bread mask while playing card games doesn't know how to do clickbait.
---
I loved seeing him play meme decks at tournaments and win! Stuff like Aviana Kun in tournaments where it was just unheard of! Now he's just kind of raging every other game. He fits in a few memes but it has a less unique feel to it all, even before the rotation.

See, it's like the [specialist format](https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6426-hearthstone-specialist-the-new-competitive-format) but instead of having three decks, you have the main deck and a side board.
---
After the first game of the match, you can add cards from sideboard, or replace cards with cards from sideboard.
---
Well OP deck doesn't seem better..
---

Fair, then ofc there are no 100% winrate decks. Although having a 60 sample size is problematic in its own, as a high winrate brings you better opponents, significantly better. Like a 80% winrate deck can get you from 25 to 5+ in 60 games. Does the initial wins count then? What about rank 20k legend vs rank 20?
---
Yeah but they have done cast when drawn a decent amount before. And they could have simply done it so that the bomb goes off, draws another card like normal, and then switches ysera and new cards cost. Not saying your point is wrong but it’s not like the mechanic is new and this specific interaction makes no sense either way since drawing an extra card on cast when drawn is the norm, so both cards should be able to work together without making the bomb or the draw card useless.
---
Toast himself has mentioned before that he no longer likes playing hearthstone all that much anymore iirc.
---
By playing a minimum of 320 games without getting your opponents so salty that they refuse to GG out of spite.
---
I never trusted him after he had a deck go 5-2 or something and then say “those were against aggro decks so those are basically wins” and then proceeded to use 100% win rate in the title, thumbnail, and highlights. But he left the deck tracker’s score on screen and everyone could see he lost 2 games.
---
But cast when drawn cards normally draw another card so couldn’t it just switch ysera and the drawn card’s costs?
---
I really doubt they released this one card to destroy all of wild as you are suggesting.
---
There are future expansions that will have major synergy potential with cards such as this that aren’t seeing much play. 
---
Just gotta wait.
---
no, for designing a card to disrupt a format. Darkest Hour is played in no current standard decks, it was designed solely to disrupt wild.
---
the card will never see play without bloodbloom support. they could have easily reworded it "summon a random minion of the same cost" and it would see the same amount of play in standard.
---
Oooh that would be so cool. I main Hunter and Stitched Tracker gave us the possibility to put some tech card (like Harrison Jones / Zihi) without suffering too much, i miss that card.
---
[removed]
---
oh synergy? with a card that has synergy with every non battlecry minion in the game? great.
---
you have to use 3 actually. :)
---
 `¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯`= ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It's why I'll never play Zeus in Dota 2 ever again. I'm 3-0, clearly pro Zeus.
---
Solely to disrupt? What evidence do you have for that?
---
If you're lucky, this fringe case is tested once every four iterations when it's assigned as a tier 3 test case, and that assumes your QA is smart enough to have a test case built for it.
---
&gt;There's no reason why it couldn't draw the card, blow up and still remember and swap the costs.
---
IMO that's a fallacious way of going about "swapping costs." It isn't really swapping if it memorizes them at a given time. It should swap them based on what they have at the time of the swap, otherwise some different interaction would end up janky. 
---
Think about something like you have Dollmaster Dorian and Knife Juggler on the field, and you draw Corridor Creeper as the minion. The drawing summons a minion, which in turn triggers a knife juggler, which deals 1 damage to an enemy minion and kills it. This should, in turn, reduce the Creeper's cost BEFORE the swap occurs, given Hearthstone resolves triggers top-down, meaning that if a trigger causes something else to occur, that something else (and its triggers) will finish resolving before the higher level trigger resolves. If it were to memorize the cost, it would instead set the card's cost to 7, despite the other card not having costed 7 before the swap.
---
Could someone with Dorian test this?
---
&gt;, that it would draw the cards and simultaneously swap their costs and not draw them, resolve their text, and then try to swap if they still exist.
---
Putting triggers on hold for one card is exactly the kind of decision making that makes these inconsistencies happen. There isn't anything special done to resolve card text. Again, because of top down triggering, the resolving of the bomb still happens within the draw phase - nothing outside of that draw phase can occur until everything in it finishes. The period is actually a really big indicator IMO that they are two seperate actions.
---
imo his ego grew as fast as the quality of his content dropped.
---
You still missed the point, dummy
---
Sometimes people just accidentally pick up habits.  I hated people who said "like".  I started saying it to bug my sister.  Only a bit.  Didn't really think anything of it.  I've now been saying it for, like, 15 years now.
---
You know, thinking this out loud, kind of made me realize that it's probably worth the effort to fix.  Time to figure out how to break a 15 year habit of sounding annoying.
---
It’s almost defintely satire, half of the things that come out of toasts mouth are so ridiculous that he must be joking. Right?
---
he does it for the memes.
---
Bomb Warriors don't usually run [[Supercollider]] and [[Sweeping Strikes]].
---
There are actually quite a few decks for the medium budget.
---
Token Druid, Tempo Rogue, Midrange Hunter, Zoo Warlock, Murloc Shaman, Bomb Hunter, and probably a few more decks I'm forgettin about now can be built at relatively low budget. Some of the full deck lists from those archetypes cost 8-10k dust, but many of the more expensive cards can be cut. 
---
It would also help if you had some of the more popular Legends like Leeroy or Zilliax - those are played in LOTS of different decks, meaning that you can cut 1.6k dust form many decks' cost if you own them.
---
While I can't account for the nerfs, I'm nearly sure that both Token Druid and Tempo Rogue will stay in the meta (Zoo Warlock too probably, but I don't think it will be as mainstream as the other two). 
---
Which means that you have quite a lot of choices. If I were you, I'd test some of those decks in budget versions and pick the one I like playing most, then craft the full list.
---
U are asking for way too much blizzard isn’t ready for this major change
---
I don’t really like the incentives this creates.
---
If you want to climb the ladder and have a 50% winrate with all decks, you are encouraged to play the slowest stalliest deck, because your wins are +2 and your losses are -1.  You can climb to legend with a 40% winrate.
---
You could make your losses on long games -2 to combat this, but then this really encourages the player who thinks they’re not going to win at the very end to concede early before the -2 penalty kicks in.

That's a good point!

If they're never going to fix anything that's broken, yeah actually.

thank you, to me he is clearly just making memes. toast doesnt tale heartstone seriously. in my opinion he is just trying to make as much money off of heartstone as he can before he gets burnt out from playing.
---
Because why would you ?
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
All they have to do is change the number of cards it discovers/shuffles. There’s got to be a balance between “too many” and “not enough”

How many packs have you opened from each of the sets in Standard (roughly)?
---
Open enough from TBP and RKR to get your guaranteed Legendary within the first 10 packs (after you get the Legendary you can stop).
---
After that, if you haven't bought I would say at least 50 ROS packs, go for those.
---
After that, you need to decide what decks you want to make.  Look at what COMMONS and RARES you are missing, and open packs from those expansions.  You aren't likely to get the epics and legends, so only look at the commons and rares.
---
There's also the PvE content coming out in a few weeks that will cost 2800 gold, so be aware of that.  It grants ~1500 gold in rewards, so you should only buy it if you want the PvE content or the Zayle card (which is basically the new Whizbang, just locked behind a 2800 gold wall).

---
When did they threaten his livelihood by removing his videos from platform holders? I can't imagine Blizzard has any kind of sway with Twitch or Youtube to get someone banned just because they don't like them.
---
There was a time when he put up a video showing off a bug in the game that would force your opponent to lose and he got a temporary ban from Blizzard and couldn't play Hearthstone, but that was completely understandable. He was intentionally teaching people have to reproduce the bug in the name of making money on youtube, he literally said it in the video. Of course Blizzard is going to take action against that but in the end it was symbolic more than anything, a one day ban is barely a slap on the wrist.
---
Ohhhh. That's his fist and he's holding his arm straight out. I thought his hand broke off half way.

Yo my dude, I'm hijacking this comment section to tell you that adding the person you just played has been in the game since well before the mobile port was even a glimmer in blizzard's collective eye, you're just dumb.
---
I would not normally respond as rudely as this, but as you went from "this is strange" to "shut the fuck up" when somebody was helping you I have no faith in your communication skills, and am just following your lead.
---
I would say that it isn't his persona, it's literally who he is.
---
Nope. That's 'Stop Recording'...'Start Recording'. 0/0, 100% WIN RATE!!
---
That's all of Toast's stream nowadays. He used to be funny with his dry humor, but now he tries way too hard to be edgy and act arrogant so its just cringe.
---
Well to be fair... that can be annoying. Imagine if you were a streamer, you missed lethal in front of 10,000 prying eyes. And then one guy just wouldn't let it go and kept typing it. 
---
I mean I wouldn't care, but Toast has been streaming for how long? How many times do you think he's missed lethal? Not really defending, just people have their days. And I have seen people banned for much less lol
---
I might be completely fucking wrong so do forgive me if I am but isn't there a video titled "100% WINRATE" where he loses the first game in the video?
---
He just can't handle criticism.
---
And what would you base that on?
---
Very well put.
---
I mean Dog is a nice friendly person that everyone won’t mind being friends with. Toast has a more eccentric personality that won’t be accepted by everyone.
---
I mean he said he was done with HS for a while. Lasted a whole week.
---
There are already not that many players playing wild, splitting the community further would only hurt it
---
Seems like a bad strategy. Even if he dislikes HS, it is his job. Eventually Hearthstone won't provide as steady an income anymore. Regardless of how much he makes now or how much he has banked, it seems foolish to discard an audience and game he's worked at for years. He can't be unaware of how volatile his industry is.
---
I used to watch him a lot too. He tries to play off him being arrogant as a joke for stream, but he just comes off as a cringey asshole nowadays
---
Petition to make them the OFFICIAL saints of Hearthstone.
---
That's actually pretty funny though.  I laughed when I read what you wrote.
---
Nah, his ego just took over. Was always an asshole.
---
You really think Bloodlust is more powerful because it does one more damage per minion? You're blowing my mind here.
---
The only HS YouTube content creators I can watch now are Dane, Hysteria, Hearthstone mathematics and kinky gaming. Everything else just irritates me at this point.
---
Why would he self reflect on pretending to be a douche? It's like criticizing Robert Downey for insulting people. I think you are taking him way too seriously.
---
This happened to me this week when I was one win away from legend (for the first time!). I was about to win the match, and then the game decided to do that thing where the rope simply never comes on your opponents turn. I restarted the app on my iPhone, and was immediately met with “You lost your last game due to a disconnect” screen. I about goddamn died. I lost three matches in a row after that, and haven’t even been back on since it happened.
---
Maybe.
---
Poor C'thun. Always getting buffed while he's trying to take a shit.
---

---
Dude your like a kid. Solution is simple, it suppose to be the only minion in your deck!
---
This gon b gud
---
And yet next turn the exact same board is back again.
---
yes and people still don't understand it's a joke
---
Hmm yah but Kripp says that about all the streamers and non-streamers for that matter. He's said for YEARS that constructed is boring since the decks get figured out so quickly, and how he doesn't get how a # of these guys/gals grind the same ol' boring constructed decks months on end. Either they're doing it for stream views/MONEY, or they just get flat out burnt out (like Reynad did). He's taken the stance for years and heavily critiqued Blizzard that Constructed is incredibly boring and doesn't understand how anyone finds it fun beyond a new meta running the same tier 1 meta decks over and over... Arena is the only reason Kripp still plays the game because it's consistently dynamic.
---
And I do in part have to agree with him. Do these streamers really find it fun to play the same deck over and over again to achieve legendary that they already have accomplished? Hey maybe some do... great. But I'm willing to bet a # are in it for the cash grab and faking it. Course that's just an opinion, but I'll stand by it.
---
If that's really what Toast is upset about, does he think this is the first time Kripp has called this out? He's brought this up for YEARS (before Toast was even a thing). If Toast's stream (don't watch it much) is all about "hyping constructed and constructed is SO COOL" great. Do I find it hard to believe that most people will share the same opinion playing Baku Pally for over a year? Nope.
---
Cenarius, Lucentbark, and a Druid of the Claw whenever my opponent plays it.
---
I play against 4 warriors then one Druid then 3 Warriors one Mage then you guessed it warrior.  Hearthstone should just change their name to Bomb Warrior The Card Game.
---
Work on your reading comprehension and stop hanging onto what Toast is saying. Dude.
---
If I had to guess why, it's because Toast does come across to me as disingenuous to a certain point.  He seems to put on an act, and he also went from very humble in his beginnings to quite arrogant when he ended up on top.  (The main boom of his views also conspicuous as he claimed to have been threatened with blackmail by some mystery source.)  
---
For whatever you feel about Kripp, Kripp is Kripp, warts and all, and always has been since Day 1.
---
So the next time Kripp roast toast is it consider drama on your part?
---
Op looks like he's playing big warrior or control warrior
---
Toast released a video on his income. Dudes rolling in it without disclosing his sponsorship income which he said makes a lot more in. He most definitely can retire on it if can ignore/decline 10k 2 hour sponsorship games
---
He did do variety for 2-3 months. He averaged 3-5k viewers which is still pretty good. But he always maintained he would be back after new expansion because the HS meta at the time was dogshit.
---
I got a golden Nozhisker on launch day, but I'm not going to craft Pogo Hopper.
---
Yeah, I agree with all you've said. I'm really not sure what Toast is talking about, as this is the only thing I remember that could even possibly be it during the St. Patty's stream, and it pretty clearly isn't aimed at Toast
---
How long can this go on ⛏️
---
Yea you missed the circlejerk twist. Liking Toast is actually the counter-circlejerk now for I would say at least 6 months.
---
The fundamental premise of this is entirely silly!
---
I don't really care about what they do. I hate the hypocrisy of audiences who hang on these sorts of peer to peer quibbles like they've never fought with someone else. Imagine how they felt if thousands discussed their actions online and every time something happens they are expected to act *perfectly* lest their every quote or clip gets taken and analyzed. This stuff is never the focus of their streams. It was a thing for 4 minutes of a 10 hour stream. Goes to show how obsessed people are when it comes to drama that they'd focus so hard on it. 
---
I also tend to illustrate my opinion in depth, which leads to these walls of text. If I had something better to do, I wouldn't be here lol.
---
Guh, downvote since this behavior should not be encouraged
---
do you think the same thing about pewdiepie's titles?
---
If it’s a “waste of time” to you to face other people playing the same or a similar deck how is anyone supposed to sympathize with your, by your own definition, willfully wasting everyone else’s time by playing your deck.  If you enjoy the playstyle that’s one thing, and more power to those players who do purely enjoy it, but to complain that your winrate is flat in the mirror because you chose a deck that does nothing the entire game is extremely tone deaf.
---
It's pretty nice that people call a turn 8-9 lethal deck "aggro"
---
yeah, that’s the joke.
---
I love that card, I sometimes try to jam it in errant decks just like I do Shifter Zerus. I wish my casino Reno mage deck had more minions to benefit from cauldron. One day there will be enough of them to generate spells to do it.
---
Point 1 is completely true.  
---
Just watch out for those people that try to argue "all card games have RNG because of card draw".  
---
smh
---

I don't count NSW because it was after they broke her and turned her from a fun if challenging to use card into the degenerative trash she was made into.
---
Look at the picture. It says “currently we are in year of the Raven”, but we are actually in year of the dragon. Blizzard didn’t update the text
---
Seems more disappointed than upset.
---
I'll take your dumb bait one last time. You can't read or think. 
---
&gt; It's called little Drama and now we will see if it will further escalate. 
---
From you. It highlights your inability to comprehend what I am saying. People like you are riding high off the fun of watching drama. But it would literally disappear if you didn't care. It doesn't "escalate" on its own, and people like you aren't just spectating it. You have to actively perpetuate it. Which you are. Why do you care what Kripp said or Toast said? Stop obsessing over online personalities. It's literally none of your business.
---
And no I don't think nor have I said or suggested any of the asinine things you said I said. And I can prove that with my posts above, which I don't revise like you do.
---
Epic would be +1200, rare would be plus 700, and common would be +360 based on current non gold and gold crafting values
---
Are you for real?
---
People can't say Kripp has a boring experience because it's odd others have a different opinion? What? We do only popular opinions here?
---
Oh my god. Is this drama or not?
---
No shit. It's also been reposted literally every single hour since launch. The amount of reposts are in the hundreds at this point, i've never seen a post more reposted, and that's by reddit's standards.
---
Yes, the only way to win for him since he was at 4 health. What's the reason for downvotes on something like this?
---
Back then, Kripp only mentioned what Twitch told him, and the twitch employee apologized on twitter for giving wrong info. It was Toast that provoked the whole drama, as he is trying to do now.
---
Confirmation bias.
---
Either way, random means exactly that *random*. You can low roll 50 times in a row and it still doesn't prove anything. You'd need a ridiculous number of outcomes to even consider looking at the average.
---
I hard disagree with your argument. There is nothing more unfun than losing because RNG spat on your face.

Or Warrior's brawling killing your 5 minions while his 1 minion survives.  
---
Mage's Glyph discovering another fireball/blizzard/flamestrike when needed.  
---
Losing to RNG is the WORST experience in this entire game. There is nothing you can do, to stop RNG from just deciding that the opponent should win and that you should lose.
---
Did I stutter? Where did I say people *can't* do anything? Or suggested the hyperbolic opposite of "We do only popular opinions here?"
---
I too hate when youtubers use successful proven methods to boost viewer engagement like its their jobs or something
---
I miss peak Hearthstone drama.
---
The only way to make wild balanced is to either nerf the everloving fuck out of wild cards, release absolute trash in standard, or drastically increase the cost of the game by hiring a metric fuck ton of play testers and balancers. Which option are you voting for?
---
Once is too many so...me too.
---
What can you do to prepare for a Turn 2, Frost Lich Jaina from Burgle Rogue? Riddle me that.  
---
Stop acting like people who are complaining aren't making valid complaints.
---
It also doesn't kill any minions that get drawn *at* the end of your turn. Say via a Vargoth spell or similar.
---
I like how it is currently with Academic Espionage because a lot of class cards have synergy with each other. A card like Sense Demons is pretty good when you have Warlock cards in your deck, but will almost always whiff if you have random class cards.
---
Don't worry token druids have a 3rd wind, and 4th wind.
---
I don't understand people like you. EVeryone complaining about RNG, are NOT complaining about the INNATE RNG native to card games via card draw.  
---
People complaining about RNG are complaining about things like Rogue going Turn 1: Prep + Academic Espionage into Turn 2: Frost Lich Jaina.  
---
That is a GIGANTIC difference.
---
Dude, same. I know it's just bad luck, but damn. 8 mana 6/8,summon a northshire cleric at the end of your turn. Lol
---
I would prefer to keep sadrificial pact because it's very good for whenever my enemy uses a demon, and because I'm contemplating getting the warlock card that gives both players a demon in their hand, so I can abuse it.
---
I've been looking to get the direwolf alpha and Knife Juggler, they really have been annoying to play against.
---
Anyways, thanks.
---
Sounds like I'm going to be a minority in this thread, but I like watching Toast. He's entertaining and his 'arrogance' is just him being showboaty in a cheeky way. He's not all about the wins, in fact, he specialises in meme decks and tries new unconventional decks, which is great because you see the same net decks over and over again.
---
I don't see a difference to sports players when they celebrate a goal or a win. They just repping their brand and that's why people watch them as pros.

I feel like it's just him being a goofy and playing hearthstone, he admits to it being clickbait and he is entertaining imo. And don't really remember many of his videos where he calls out people for stream sniping.
---
I once tapped first while I had lethal in hand and 5 hp. The lethal involved hellfire.
---
Yeah both him and Kibler they're all about being funny and entertaining. Toast is silly, while playing decks that are either crazy op or crazy memes.
---
C'thun Priest was fun. Stuff in the C'thun cards, some heal synergy, maybe some steal cards, and definitely entomb. That way you can have 2+ Cthuns, plus the ones you get after it dies. Oh and Mind Control. C'thun Priest vs C'thun Priest was fun because you'd both be trying to swap Cthuns back and forth.
---
They're not
---
Probably is but still makes me just think they are pieces of shit. I been playing this game so long that I don’t really give anyone the “benefit of the doubt” - roping ? emoting? Friend request after match? All trolls that should die in a fire.
---
I played against 3 kingsbane rogues so far, and 2 of them had the prep raidingparty buccaneer opener
---
You have to add someone in order to talk to them; it's a limitation of the game.  And I'm not sure what you mean by not being "responsible" for someone's time... the other person literally can't do anything but wait if you refuse to make a move.  They are dependent on your decisions.  No, you won't be banned for being unnecessarily slow - but there's just a level of respect and decency it would be nice to show an opponent.  And blocking you is the only way to make sure I don't have to put up with that nonsense again.
---

Well I'm ive only played bomb warrior on ladder from rank 20 to 3 atm. I have taking a few months off amd only kinda played here and there last year.
---
I enjoy bomb warrior and the randomness of my opponents possibly dying to a bomb. Also there are decks that counter it and have ways to remove bombs. My 60 ish games is a small sample size and I have tried different versions. 
---
The most recent deck list I run no omega devastators but I run Grommash and 1 owl with no weapon removal. My late game and draw can suffer a bit, but I've seemed do well with the current list. Warrior is strong atm and it does have some predictable turns but that happens to most decks. Consistent decks are normally the best ones.
---
So much Hearthstone drama. Honestly, I just stick to Dane and Kibler / Omnislash for info.
---
Pretending to be a douche is a douche thing
---
Are you me?  
---
Litterally did the same thing first time I got to 11 wins, took a screenshot, entered que (big mistake I realized) and went to send it.
---
Came back to this message :(
---
As much as I also dislike the deck. It's important to have predictable control decks in the format. This is so other decks know what to tech against them to create counterplay. I guarantee you once the other control decks in the meta figure out a plan against bomb warrior it'll lose viability.
---
To be fair Toast does knowingly take the piss out of his own clickbait titles more than any other streamer.
---
Surprised that someone doesn't understand that clickbait is how YouTube works now... oh wait you're a tool.
---
Packs are ~100 dust on average, 50 gold is ~50 dust on average. But if you want to play arena maybe gold makes more sense.
---
How long can this go on?
---
P.S I don't really play the deck but it falls to mid-range decks that don't play too hard into brawl. Or at least that's what I've felt.
---
Perfect answer after perfect answer into perfect answer. 3 "random" mech my arse dude. Give me a fucking break dude.
---
Well, priest has the worst basic+classic set afterall. Inner fire decks withou shadow visions need to run cleric, pyro and circle just to able to draw combo since no card draw cards are printed. We rely on overpowered class cards to compensate for crappy core set. Blizzard should just cut most of the core priest set and replace it with dragons from tgt or something along those lines
---
Wild would be way more appealing to me if after seeing an opponents class i could ban a couple of cards. Then decks would have to be well built with multiple synergies instead of stupid Tricks like Darkest Hour.
---
I do agree on one point, that priest seems to be way too much focused on divine spirit inner fire right now.  I tested out some different priest decks, that looked initially like very different archetypes, some not running mass ressurection at all, some running Lady in White.  But the bottom line was that several games in a row I would just get a 14/14 on turn 4, and my opponent would concede.  Tech choices of Lady in White vs Mass resurrection or Batterhead...really didn't feel like they mattered.
---
If Silence Priest is a deck that ends up being good, it's probably going to be a divine spirit inner fire deck too.
---
Pretty sure playing a bunch of meme decks for entertainment value doesn't exactly rank you up to Legend fast.
---
Doesnt hold a candle to Thijs 500% win rates.
---
That is mostly due to Blizzard offering zero support for wild, not even allowing you to buy packs with gold while keeping the crafting cost the same. This gives such a huge barrier of entry for new players that the only influx wild has are old players who returned and can't build any standard decks. Then these people leave again after being stomped by kingsbane rogue, even shaman and big priest. And so, in the end, very few players play wild.
---
This feels like a card that could be nerfed. 
---
2 mana would be more fair
---
Zalae is one of the best streamers.  Plus the streams with him and Firebat and especially Purple are great.  Any tag-team with Purple is usually pretty good, whether it's Zalae or Firebat.
---
Omega Devastator is more likely
---

There are quite a few cards that rely on the digital medium, and the schemes are a new form of that.

---
|100|% winrate
---
Sure, there are, but so much more could be done, they've done the bare minimum when it comes to taking advantage of their market edge.
---
Even Schemes, are hardly a "new form of that", they're just the Spellstones v2.0.
---
Same thing with Discover, it was not a new way of taking the advantage of the digital medium, it was them grabing what they already had: "Add random card", and adding a new thin layer over it.
---
It's piloted shredder all over again
---
The best of 5 idea is terrible. The game is one big shit RNG fest now just do 3 months average ladder finish. Fuck arena finish that program basically build the deck for you
---
Ah well if you watch solarhs's play on their climb to legend. They use a budget midrange hunter and it did fairly well. It can help give an idea of play styles.
---
I once thought a deck with keleseth needed [[acidic swamp ooze]]. Next game i played keleseth and have never been so confused

Thanks, after these words, i think will definitely craft my bomb warrior deck :)
---
Ty.
---
as other said due to weak classic and bassic sets of priest we are forced to wait for next expansions BUT in the meantime there are quite a few T2 decks out there to try each beeing different from the other and fun. There is new wall ress priest for RoS which has nice win rate, silence priest, nomi priest, steal priest and yestarday there was a cool post on CompetitiveHS about Lady in White priest which is fun too. Link https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/bdrtd9/rank_4_to_legend_with_lady_in_white_priest/?sort=new  The problem is that priest is now underplayed and not much people talk about it as they are concentrated on the classes that have best classic/basic sets or have clear archetypes pushed by blizz like treant druid, mech/spell/beast hunter, murlock shaman, bomb warrior and the everlasting zoo lock. The same as for priest can be said for mage and pally...
---
I think the new Mild format would see more players that usually play Standard. Maybe I'm wrong but I think degenerate things like Odd Paladin or Big Priest keep a lot of players from Wild (me, for example). And YES, even if these decks aren't that widespread or don't have an amazing win rate. I just never want to see them again.
---
That's because Class cards have 4x discover rate compared to neutrals... Why do you think Paladins always got Tirion/Tarim from Stonehill Defender? 
---
P.s. I'd much rather pick the Wand from Togwaggle than this....
---

Yeah, he slowly became more cynical and self absorbed once he took the mask off. 
---
I used to watch him for funny meme decks, and an uplifting stream. 
---
He so looks like he hates what he's doing. 
---
Only HS streamer I can still watch is Thijs. The guy is always upbeat and having a great time.
---
I don't think Kripp is the kind of guy that would subject himself to a month of ladder just to try to prove something
---
Making fun of autist people is never okey even if the rest of the comment was true. They are just calling you out on that specific remark you did.
---
Please refrain from calling fans of other streamers you dont like "autists".
---
Considering point 2 you are spot on! Win points should be weighted by the amount of time you play. You would still acumulate more gold over time with aggro decks tho(3 wins=10gold).
---
no, it single handedly keeps other OP decks in place
---
They generally don't without drawing well.
---
you mean with big elementals?
---
I just say that clickbaits have an opposite effect for some people, instead of clicking on video they would never watch it instead. Joke or not, clickbait is still clickbait, youtube would be much better without them
---
Haven't you tried new unicorn priest?
---
Considering how often professional players update their decks to add in different tech cards in an attempt to counter the meta as well as running different packages or playing different decks all together, it is unlikely that Toast or any streamer will play the exact same decklist for the rest of the expansion. Because of this, I think it's fair to say that when you win 100% of the games you play with a deck, you have a 100% winrate with it. Stop hating on Toast, at least he creates actual content that people can enjoy and has a personality aside from talking about the game, unlike everyone's favorite Kripparian
---
At the first hint of extra garbage when he has obvious lethal i squelch, concede, and move on. Why stress about it?
---
You can do infinitely many, if there wasn't a turn limit. The idea is that you get Oblivitron and Sneed's from Sneed's (using Baron Rivendare), Oblivitron summons a Piloted Shredder from hand, and before you kill the shredder you seance it with Lorewalker Cho on board. And then the opponent puts the seances back into your hand through Cho.  
---
The following combo I would use:
---
- Opponent has a Cho, a  huge poisonous/7+ attack (buffed with divine spirit or something like that) minion Houndmaster Shaw, two Radiant Elementals and Wisp and played Millhouse last turn.
---
- You have Baron Rivendare, Houndmaster Shaw, Sneed's Old Shredder, Raid Leader and Piloted Shredder on board, and a hand full of Seances.
---
Your turn:  
---
- You Seance shredder 10x (your opponent played Millhouse)  
---
- You attack with Piloted Shredder into Millhouse, summoning two Doomsayers, attacking into the huge minion (they have 1 attack)
---
- You attack with Oblivitron into the the poisonous minion, summoning two Shredders which attack into the poisonous minion, summoning four doomsayers, which attack into the poisonous minion. (attack with the doomsayers before attacking with the second shredder)
---
- You attack with Sneed's into the poisonous minion, summoning a Sneed's and another Oblivitron, which does once again the step above.
---
Opponent's turn: 
---
- Seance and play Millhouse 
---
- Seance and play 9 Wisps, rushing them into the Shredder and the Sneed's without killing them.
---
This way you get 20 doomsayers each turn, giving you easily more then you. You can really optimize this, and whilst this may take 15 turns to setup, that's at least around 600 doomsayers thanks to the turn limit.
---
Don't spend dust just yet, the meta is far from settled and there's no telling which will be the best decks. I personally think that Bomb Warrior will be around T2-3, so not that worth crafting if you want to grind ranked.
---
Toasts content fell off a cliff when he moved into the streamer house
---
Razakus didn't even last a full expansion before it was nerfed. Which I find pretty funny. "oh, priest finally has a tier one deck? Better Nerf it!"
---
There are 8 other classes to build decks for.
---
Big Paladin? Interesting what is it?
---
His editor knows for sure, how to bait the kids to clicking his videos.
---
Honestly when wall priest with Mexican kelthuzad peeks it’s head out of the meta this expac it’s going to be crazy. I wouldn’t be surprised if it tops out charts just like Dekkster’s version
---
Tinkmaster is really good against Mech Paladin or Lucentbark Druid, which some people are playing right now, but otherwise I haven’t found it to be particularly useful in the current meta. Not really a build-around card, more of a tech card used to eliminate single target minions with very high stats, important deathrattles, etc.
---
So, what’s the point of this post then?
---
Dragon Priest was the best deck I've ever played and the most fun I hqd with Priest.
---
Not too abusive, like the Raaza combo, but very interactive and funny.
---
Un'Goro focused Priest decks into Dragons, then next expansion changed to Silence Priest, then next one to Resurrect, now it's half resurrect half silence, not even consistent content to make a solid deck.
---
You take the good you take the bad and there you guy my friend you have the facts of life
---
Just stop and think: if you were to start streaming now, what's the benefit of acting like an asshole? There is none. All you need is *a* personality; not a negative one, not over the top, just something so people know what kind of person you are. There is no reason not to be yourself, unless you actively enjoy not being yourself: you don't gain revenue significantly by forcing yourself to act like someone you're not.

P4wnyhof and the global games saga has to be peak.
---
I dont trust him because I have never heard of him and 90% of his "advice" on what to craft is wrong, and based purely on personal choices.
---
I'd trust Trump, Kripp, Kibler, firebat, dane or Toast more as they actually play the game every day/other day, and are very knowledgeable about the game.
---
Also consider most of the meta defining decks people are currently playing stem from that gathering of same said streamers at BlizzHQ to play the new xpac early.
---
I always just take the wand. Three cards from your deck that cost 0 is always insane.
---
You knew the chances but got greedy
---
Wait is lucentbark Druid with juicy psychemelon actually good or is toast just good with anything
---
Hey there. I didn't play hearthstone from 2018, this game is comeback with this update or still bad? I saw many tournaments platforms are gone, upset about it.
---
How bad is he tho 😂😂
---
Although it was fine when there were other DKs in standard, it really feels like hero Dr Boom could use losing the passive rush. The ridiculous hero powers would be plenty to keep him viable in standard. It would suck that he gets nerfed in wild where it's not really a problem, but unless they go the route of HoFing him, it seems like the least intrusive change they can make (instead of letting only warrior have a busted hero card for an entire year, assuming no new ones are coming)
---
Guess khadgar wanted to commit suicide
---
&gt;Who are you again? Are you in some authoritative seat that allows you to pass judgment?
---
Heh. Kind of what I was thinking as I read your top post. A very superior attitude (so it seems from your language. Struck me as quite condescending). You criticise this guy for being judgmental mere moments after you label a swath of strangers as "immature and childish". Who are you again? But hey, we're all hypocrites after all. You might benefit from identifying this aspect in yourself though.
---
Precision
---
&gt;People do this in HS because there is a high barrier to talking to anyone.
---
MTGO had a fully implemented chat system and I can tell you, from experience, that it was almost invariably used as a way of insulting your opponent. The reason I don't want a chat is I already had nearly ten years of being called a lucksack, being told that I was playing cancer (regardless of the deck I was playing), and so on. This notion that the lack of chat is the problem doesn't line up with my actual experience.
---
Yes. Lorewise, Onyxia was killed quite some time ago. Anduin is the current ruler of Stormwind, after his father fell in the assault on the broken shore in Legion.
---
Hunter can magnetize a poisonous mech and missile launcher, it wasn’t uncommon in mech hunter decks
---
I'm running a mech paladin with great success, I haven't lost to a single warrior ever with it in 20+ times facing them.
---
Only thing I don't like is Iose to token druid 99% of the times. I will try techin against them in the future.
---
Might see how this works in my Control/Bomb Warrior,
---
I find that I can keep Token Druids at bay for 5-6 turns, it would be nice after that to just clear their board. Only problem is, at turn 10, they can make full boards of 3attack minions
---
How come?
---
CptSalame #1423 on NA
---
I show but you go first
---
True, he would cost 7 mana, but even if he was 5 he wouldn't have enough mana to play evis, which I'm pretty sure he had in his hand because of how quickly he checked for explosive and the card on the left was sitting in his hand for a while. Might've also topdecked it.
---
Needing classic set is always the worst design choice.
---
Everybody saw it but didn't feel it was nevessary to point out the obvious
---
&gt; That shows.
---
It doesn't have to; you can still enjoy doing your job. Everyone in this world is technically doing their job because they have to, but many people are still happy working.
---
Finally someone points out the 100 dust legendary...
---
I don't agree, but, regardless, you didn't answer the question. How much gold do you think that we should earn per game?
---
Thanks for the tip, content police! Hey, maybe people shouldn't be allowed to stream when they're in a bad mood because they might say something that someone else will totally misconstrue to make it about themselves! Yeah that seems banworthy to me. 
---
Ooh I know, don't let people swear on stream because that's a bad influence for *the children* and if you have to resort to swearing for content, you shouldn't even be on twitch. That'll teach em.
---
I really couldn't care less about some random insulting me, on top of that it's really rare. 
---
I've played DotA and CS for like 12 years now, both have chat and it's no stress at all.
---
If it affects you this much if some random insults you maybe you should work on your attitude.
---
What's your playstyle? I'd love some advice
---
Quadruple even
---
I can't even believe that you're complaining about one of the strongest late game classes in the game. It feels like every time I play against Priest, no matter what deck I'm playing, if I don't win by turn 8 then it's game over for me. Plus my wife has been playing resurrect Priest with Catrina and she loves it, I can't beat her with it, and it seems really fun to me too. Not gonna lie I can't agree with your opinion here, sorry.
---
Self-Loathing
---
Hey added you dude I have the quest too
---
Hunter's call does the same thing without the body right?
---
Can't people just accept the fact that Blizzard does not update keywords retroactively?
---
Who cares about random insults... it's also pretty rare.
---
I've played CS and DotA for 12 or so years no, both have chat and it never bothered me one bit.
---
Razakus was a thing since koft, and was arguably the best deck for the period between the innervate nerf and the raza nerf. Definitely more than an expansion.
---
I remember that and I also thought it was about thijs.
---
hmm rouge is bad vs warrior at least the control deck
---
Because they are evergreen
---
You have to play faster.
---
Git gud
---
It wasnt the calling out that was a hate thread. It was everyone else joining in the circle jerk and shitting on him. I don't think the op even meant it as shitting on him, but that's how everyone else interpreted it as .
---
Deck winrates from a single pilot are useless, since they do nothing to compensate on the skilldifference between players and opponent, and pilots skills versus the efficience of the deck.
---
So you need a lot of players playing against a lot of similiarly skilled players to say anything about any deck - that kind of has reference, while toast playing against rank 6 opponents doesn't have, nor does toast playing against high legend. Toast can't play against himself, which we would want for good data about the deck.
---
&gt; Both sides do stuff on board with their and the opponent's side.
---
I mean, he wants to play Doomsayers so he's probably not doing much with the board in the early game.
---
I ran a Jade deck in Arena once with 10 jade cards including the legendary (Can't remember her name off hand)

Got to 10 wins in a row and then lost 3 games in a row from terrible RNG. Was ready to quit out if pure rage.
---
token druid
---
He makes clickbait “100% win rate” videos with 4 game sample sizes, essentially lying to his audience and he expects to be liked? Weird
---
Clickbait is scam. It's not ridiculous to shit on scammers.
---
RemindMe! 6 hours
---
I don't understand the hate. His videos only last a few games long so it is a 100% winrate deck technically, but no one should assume that it will always be 100% winrate. His content is entertaining and he is probably in my top 3 HS players next to Trump and Kibler, I enjoy watching his content because he plays these wacky decks. Just like I enjoy kibler for his insane value and ridiculously fun decks, and then trump for his strong meta-decks so I can get an idea of what the meta is. Everyone likes different personalities and content styles, how is his worth hating more than anyone elses?
---
I have
---
So Toast fully appreciates...
---
1) That clickbaiting benefits him, and...
---
2) That viewers find it rude and deceptive.
---
He has no right to complain, then. Surely he reaps the benefits he bargained for by clickbaiting, so why can't he accept the backlash? I like Toast's content a lot, but thinking you're entitled to not experience negative publicity for open and continuous rude behavior is a totally misplaced expectation.
---
Wow, what a baby. He's actually bothered enough by a mundane Reddit post to cry about it on Twitter.
---
Toast, you're free to use clickbait to boost your views, and we're free to mock you for it.
---
When was he lying/cheating?
---
Havent watched toast in a long while.
---
I simply hate the character he portrays.
---
Hey does anyone know some hearthstone recording app? Not like that from decktracker, but actually recording, just like you're watching a youtube video. Thanks in advance :)

Calm down all the haters! He says it himself in one of these vids that he just tried a 70% win rate warlock deck and lost 5 in a row but when he tries a NomiMeme deck he wins 4 straight. Also it's his job and he also says in a vid that people tend to click more when it says 100% win rate. Who would deliberately chose not to get more views... If you say you have to much integrity to do this then you clearly only have 2 subs and it's not your life revenu.
---
It's a new player...
---
At least give helpful advice
---
Ofc, it has Pyromancer, Mass Dispell, Auchenai/ Circle of Healing and Hysteria. So don't tell me, it doesn't handle Token Druid "at all", that's bs. The list I saw had the two huge Taunts plus Seance for more Nomis (in case of Brawl) or big ass Taunts against Druid.
---
It's all about waiting for the right moment to play the board clears.
---
Bomb Warrior can be tricky, but against Control Warrior, you should do fine, if you keep both Seances for Nomi.
---
the thought process for me looks something like this:
---
“oh fuck a warrior again, fuck these guys. imma beat this mother fucker this.” *opponent proceeds to discover fourth omega devastator* “fuck this shit” *concedes*
---
Clickbait? You must be really retarded if you think that there is a deck with 100% win rate....
---
I recommend you to play solo adventure until it finished
---
There should be a dedicated YT chanel that just shits on youtbers and streamers for entertainment.
---
No David(dog) is.
---
hearthstone in a nutshell
---
&gt;the one where a player is playing a solo game
---
Hope you realize Token druid is exactly the opposite of playing a solo game
---
Well first things first in my opinion, time to get some cards. You’ll want to do daily quests each day and if theyre only 50 gold, try rerolling them and get something better before you complete it. Theres a lot of budget lists that can be made but I’m not sure how many there are out there due to the rotation. Level up each class to 20 i think to get all the free class cards and theres a hidden achievement tied to it as well. If you still can try and do the prologue of the frozen throne adventure as itll give you a card you can dust if you want. I would open mostly rise of shadow packs for a while to get a collection and open other packs just until you get the first legendary. Classic packs are also good
---
These clickbait vidoes really show you desperate HS creators are. Yikes.
---
Why does he care or anyone for that matter?
---
It's people like Toast and Redmercy I absolutely cannot stand anymore with their thumbnails. The content they produce is still good but the clickbait titles always put me off. It's not just them I dislike, it's everyone else who does it. 
---
I unsubscribed from him and now I never see any of his videos show up. I don't shit on him on threads but I just acknowledge that what he does is annoying. If he hates that people shit on him for his clickbait videos, I don't see why he's really upset. He chose to move to this style of YouTube, now he's getting the usual backlash from the community.
---
Clickbaiting has it pros and cons, it stupid from him to think people wouldn’t judge him for it
---
I don't know how the thread ultimately shook out, but when I was reading it live there was a huge amount of negativity in the thread.
---
I got handed dust for the cards I had (full refund), and I disenchanted the cards that I crafted just for the dust refund
---
You're just trying to spin his comment now... He never mentions the title, he's referring to comments of which a lot were shitting on him and saying that he's become an asshole.
---
How is summon 3 1/1 mechs for 2 mana useless?
---
You're definitely making sense, and I see where you're coming from, but it still comes down to preference of where the balance lies - which is what this is all essentially discussing.
---
A counter example - pre-nerf(s) quest rogue. It was arguably the most hated deck in HS, and definitely one of the top most hated. It had no card RNG, but widely considered horrible to lose to. The only reliable way to not lose to it was to play aggro, forcing the meta into rock-paper-scissors where most games were decided before a single card was played. In my opinion, those metas were really tedious. 
---
I agree that OP random cards are boring and bad for the game, but that's really because they're too powerful rather than the slight chance it could have gone badly for the person playing the card.
---
I actually think Knife Juggle is a great example of good RNG. It can be used to prevent matches where both players are playing aggro/board decks from being decided entirely on who drew better. In this case you can make decisions based on probabilities that may or may not pay off, I prefer this to just hoping I draw the right card, at least I have some options on the chances I'm going to take. Sure, sometimes you get hit in the face 6 times in the row for perfect lethal, but just as often they'll only need one to hit face and all 6 hit your 6 health minion. Removing Knife Juggler would prevent these rare situations, but also remove options for setting up your deck for facing decks with similar strategies.
---
Overall there needs to be a balance, and it comes down to personal preference on where you want the balance to sit. To me, removing RNG cards would have a net negative effect and I'd rather lose 1/50 games to a 1/50 chance than play in meta that outcomes are mostly determined by the match-up RNG and draw RNG.
---
No it doesn't? The post is about him, the videos arent about you
---
Good luck getting sympathy from this sub toast. 
---
it sure sucks when people have opinions. Cash in on the drama now while it’s hot
---
Why is it lying? Clickbait manipulates people into watching, sure, but it is primarily about withholding information to get people to watch. Clickbaiting is saying 'this deck has a 100% winrate' but making you watch to see which deck it is and why it is so good. It isn't necessarily a lie that the deck, for that stream, had a 100% winrate.
---
Steal priest with benedictus is fun. Beating your opponent with their own deck is hilarious.
---
Like he wasn't annoying enough
---
ah I haven't played the new patch so I wasn't aware, before then he was shown to fight with his sword (shamans can't use swords god damn it) and since he's Rezan's main man I thought he'd be more of a paladin
---
maybe he became more shaman-ish after his pact with Bwonsamdi but I guess hearthstone Rastakhan is pretty clearly post-Bwonsamdi Rastakhan
---
Unity^(7)
---
Oh noes free publicity! ..   
---
Honestly I believe such thread are a net-win for a streamer like him, even if they are filled with 75% toxicity.
---
He ought to just roll with it. And I think this is what he's doing by acknowledging it. And see what it got him. Another thread on this subreddit.
---
Yeah, happened to me once against shaman. Unfortunately he had that AOE spell in hand and ready for quite some time. Cleared the entire board with 11 damage to all minions.
---

---
Everyone clickbaits. I don’t care. Toast seems like a good dude, I find his video entertaining nonetheless, and I’ve learned a lot from watching his videos. Hating on someone who makes clickbait titles makes no sense. It’s his business. He needs to make a living. Let the man live his life. Don’t like clickbait? Don’t click it.
---
You. You are good!
---
He makes more money streaming from his house than going to events.
---
I'd like to know how spending 2 mana on a hero power to summon 3 1/1s is useless... Paladin had to build an entire deck around a single card in order to get a hero power that summoned 2 1/1s. Sure, it's inconsistent, in that you don't get the same power every turn, but none of them are useless. They all provide an extremely overtuned effect in comparison to other similar actions.
---
Blast Shield is more than 3x the effectiveness of the base warrior hero power. Zap Cannon is 3x the effectiveness of the mage hero power. KABOOOM is a unique effect that provides free aoe value and yet hits face as well anyway, because why not... Micro-squad is 3x the value of the base paladin hero power. Delivery Drone is an infinite value generator only slightly less effective than what DK Rexxar could accomplish, and yet now it has nothing to compare it against because Rexxar is out of standard.
---
Clearly:

Wow downvotes who the fuck would disagree on the difference between a win rate and win loss ratio
---
You should focus on buying packs from each expansion to get the 100% rate of a legendary card within 1st 10 packs/expansion.

&gt;essentially lying to his audience

I played her once, and won off of the free Cenarius on my next turn.

Although, to be honest, I was winning that game basically no matter what lol.
---
Only the warrior playing against you though. I was playing a mirror match (darn quests gave me win X games as Warrior so I went with it) and my Omega Assemblies gave me Boom Reavers, Mecharoos, and Upgradeable Framebots. Meanwhile the other guy was getting Zilliax, Omega Devastators, and Clockwork Goblins. I was....displeased.
---

What a drama queen.

And I don't care if he is just pretending or that's how he really feels.
---
"That's me, yeah, that's me"

Here is some support.
---
No no, I get what he's saying. The game is really unbalanced for new players
---
A lot of time compared to what? How long was jade druid a thing? Aggro palladin? Pirate warrior?
---
Those can all go on for a year or more being tier one, but raza priest we have to nerf after an expansion and a half.
---
Bitter and salty streamers also attract a large viewer base. For example I prefer Kripp and Toast to wholesome Thijs every time.
---
I play Assembly before 9 when I am fishing for something against Druid, Rogue or even Hunter and Paladin.

---
Does this include when Toast plays Boommaster Boom and chants, "Bomb. Bomb. Bombitty. Bomb Bomb"?
---
years of rngstone will do that to anyone lol
---
Yeah, just concede. Your tiny chance of winning is not worth the 40 minutes of absolute misery you're going to endure. It's pure, unfiltered, concentrated cancer and its not worth it.
---
You will get infinitely more enjoyment from playing 2-3 other games in the time you'd have spent fighting the warrior, whether you win or lose.

I’m skeptical as fuck, first of all. It has destroyed many of my relationships to be honest with you.

Second, I don’t think the onus of responsibility is on people to not be fooled by liars.
---
The onus of responsibility should be on the person lying NOT TO LIE.
---
Now, there will be liars, and being able to sniff them out is a great skill.
---
But making it the dumb victim’s fault isn’t productive.
---
Toast is a content creator, people trust his opinion and spend their hard earned money on high 100% winrate decks, while he rakes in actual big money on lies.
---
Just sayin.
---
I love you toast, and i don't care if you clickbait, your content is good to me.
---
There is still a difference he is probably complaining about the toxic comments directed at himself. Like how he is an arrogant asshole now etc. So saying he is complaining about the thread shitting on him because of clickbait titles is wrong.

* Become irrelevant

* Do dumbshit for people to point out on reddit
---
* Cash in on drama
---
Because he's the most prominent HS youtube to do so. So of course the HS subreddit is going to voice distaste about it. R/LeagueOfLegends calls out ProfessorAkali once every couple of months on his click-baiting ways, as well as other YouTubers. Toast is just the biggest HS YouTube to practice it, so he get's called out by the HS subreddit.
---
True, Though personally i don't see it fitting the flavour of rogue as their whole thing is thief. I preferred seeing cards that is just steal from your opponents class rather than from another class as how do you steal from people who arent there? 
---
But they shot themselves in the foot with tess that lifesteal weapon that people complained that its a bore against another rogue. 
---
Personally i would have just said cards that didnt start in your deck over being able to steal from thin air.
---
What is your point? My point is that if you're going to pull the "that's just capitalism" card then I'm going to do the same. The consumer base can turn against your whether you are right or wrong and they can blame you even if everyone else is doing it. In capitalism, you don't have the right to fair public perception or to have people's behavior justified. If they don't like you and want to bring you down, that's what they'll do.
---
oh crap that was easy, my bad, thanks :D
---
If we compare their twitch channels kibler has less 10k views on average compared to toast. The difference on youtube should be higher than it is.
---
I think there is very little hate on anyone in the thread. Unless mods cleaned it up recently I don't think he read it.
---
I like to play handbuff paladin. It's all about trying to pull off the greediest combos.
---
Context is important, we're on a subreddit, toast is on Youtube. World of difference.

I don't dislike Toast, he seems like a decent guy, but the fact he got this upset about it shows he feels he's doing something he's ashamed of.
---
&gt; I know people will say "it's just a game"
---
I mean, I wouldn't say that on account of games often being far more than just... well, a game. Games can be experiences, escapes, and for some people, even lifestyles or jobs.
---
However,
---
&gt; To me it's just comes off as classless the same way other YouTubers will have big red arrows and circles or something sexual just to entice viewers.
---
I don't see what the problem is with having big red arrows or circles. They're shapes, and they're red, because red is a visually drawing colour. It's just...
---
Simple? Straightforward? Obvious?
---
Sexually suggestive stuff is more... iffy, I suppose. It comes off as a self-deceiving way of "I come here *for the game,*" when that just doesn't seem to be the actual case.
---
&gt; not because they're chasing the bag, and these people usually don't sacrifice the quality of their content by clickbaiting.
---
How does having a clickbait title or thumbnail detract from the content itself, exactly?
---
It doesn't matter if it's Day[9] videos or DisguisedToast videos. I enjoy them both, if for different reasons. One of them is Clickbait and the other isn't, but what matters far more to me is the actual content of the video. Not the title or the thumbnail.
---
Because turn 4 Barnes cancer
---
It’s his line of works annoying shit that he had to deal with, every job has it’s annoying shit like “ I guess it’s free” when shit doesn’t scanz he mentions that if you say missed lethal, say step by step how. That’s a daily annoyance for him with trolls spamming missed lethal over and over- I don’t blame him for banning people.  It’s his stream, his chat, and he’s making and moderating it to the level he would want them to act. I know I wouldn’t want to be annoyed while trying to entertain thousands of people, I’m already done with someone annoying me serving 5 customers let alone his numbers lmfao
---
Man has a streaming persona that plays to the majority of demographic and people here acting like he’s got an ego and is fragile?? Lol I’m proud our boy found a comfortable persona he can do his work with and shame on y’all trying to hate on him for it :/
---
karma brooo
---
DAVID IS CRAZY!! btw david is dog, i can use his first name because we are tight like that. yeah i know top players but its whatever to me lol
---
lol personality? any time I turn him on he is incredibly boring. Not only is he condescending to chat, but he is slow to react/respond, with very little emotion in his voice. He just sits there staring blankly, then after 10 seconds of silence will give an "I'm better than you" comment. I seriously don't get what people see in him.
---
It’s like this: I’m saying not liking game of thrones is okay, that’s how free will works. Then you say well people don’t like game of thrones that’s how free will works. Lmao
---
Not nearly every comment was shitting on him and the post itself was a light hearted joke. Not sure why he’s so annoyed at one Reddit post.
---
I don't think that's gonna work.
---
[[Wickerflame Burnbristle]]
---
The clickbait is just straight up lying though and that’s why I don’t like it. He says 100% win rate even when he loses in the video or he makes up an excuse to play it off like it’s ok. It would not even be all that bad if he didn’t do the same thing for almost 2 years or something now.
---
I just want the old tournament misplays, educational, and tongue and cheek toast back. Not the variety streaming, egotistical self that he has become.
---
Something obviously triggers you about it though. For me, it doesn't bother me at all.
---
I've been on YouTube long enough to know that Toast's clickbait titles are pretty damn harmless in comparison to the worst clickbait out there. It's not like anyone's going to be physically hurt if a deck's winrate isn't 100%.
---
When is a tier one deck considered only a "good deck"?  I don't think you understand what a "good deck" is and what a "this deck destroys good decks" is.  
---
There are literally hundreds of decks you can play but you have to play those 5 that are the best of the best?  Grow a fucking pair bro.
---
that him clickbaiting literally has 0 negative impact on you, you’re not being scammed for money
---
Okay then fine. He has a right to title videos in a way that gets him the most views. Reddit has a right to be annoyed by that and make fun of him. He has a right to be annoyed. And that's the end of that. Nobody needs to change their opinion then.
---
Ah yes 18 is when you stop criticizing things and start sucking everybody's dick.
---
I agree with this post's main point, but everyone just spreading hate in the comments is worse. What's wrong with someone expressing themselves or their content in a way that suits them? You do not have to watch them. You people would rather talk shit about someone who is doing well than have anything constructive happen.
---
That card auto wins against Priest if it attaches to anything.

2. You get the views

3. Clickbait is also annoying

4. You get shitty feedback

What's not to understand.
---
These... are different people?
---
Uh no, the argument is clear: I agree with the OP that this level of outrage over "clickbait" is disingenuous/ manufactured / irrational. Becauae hipsterish kiddos like to hate on what is popular for no other reason than to define themselves, that could explain things.
---
I tried logging out. I'll try reinstalling tonight.

Can you elaborate on "Shitty Behavior"?
---
Had the same thing yesterday but lost... :(
---
I’ll point you to my anology one level above in this comment chain
---
Well yeah, early game dropping one assembly for tempo is reasonable. But if he's been saving 2 copies all game, and drops them both a turn before they are triple as effective? Kinda questionable
---
The only thing I can do is just concede. There, your quest is finished, move on.
---
Holy crap my eyes are being consecrated at how truly *BIG* this boy is
---
In all seriousness though don’t go to reddit to post about being above having an opinion
---
Eh, attacking how an entertainment personality markets said personality is pretty fair game. No one went into the thread saying Jeremy Wang is a piece of trash hack that doesn't deserve his job, they went in saying that clickbait is a bad practice, even if it is the most successful way to market, and Toast using it takes away from the quality of his name. Which is a fair take on the topic.
---
Relax dude it’s just clickbait! You might not like it, but it works.
---
But that’s how it works
---
I feel like that thread was moreemes than hate. Like clickbaity titles, I'm sure people know it's not a video of a deck that went 100-0, most people probably watch it for the memes
---
It’s a neat way to test for balancing over longer periods of time, or rather, with the whole player base.
---
Clickbait means people click on the title expecting it to be accurate.  Nobody watching Hearthstone highlights on YouTube believes somebody has a deck that never loses.  They click on the title because they recognize it’s intended as a humorous reference that the highlights are of a meme deck
---
I definitely got called a cunt yesterday from a recent opponent.
---
so having you as a CEO of a big company you would mischieve or trick people into buying your product to gain more income. its a moral question...its happening a lot, but dont try to defend this by saying it gives him more income so its okay.
---
Just another day on the internet. Nothing to see here.
---
We all know it's clickbait titles at this point, it's on you if the bait catches you
---
Everyone’s acting like the entire sub was ganging up on him. The post itself was light hearted joke.
---
Sounds like you're the lowest common denominator.
---
If he's just doing it "because it works" then he has to live with all the consequences of doing it, including everyone telling him how annoying it is, because that's also "how it works".
---
Whizbang??? O_O
---
Token Mage xD
---
I watch him because he is funny, i dont take serious those clickbaits. I mean, do you guys really think that theres a 100% winrate deck...
---
Are Kibler's thumbnails clickbait though? Taking out a funny/weird/strange face from a stream or a video and putting it on a video-related background makes his videos distinct from the others, but not clickbait. If he had stuff like shitty arrows pointing at random stuff and overuse of caps I would consider it clickbait
---
I mean, Toast's video the other day that said 100% Win Rate with Nomi Priest after he wins the first game he goes "Time for a click bait YouTube title saying 1-0 is 100% win rate." It's a joke most of the time, imo.
---
Lol someone hates their day job
---
The same thing is just going to happen in a couple months. Toast has to stop letting words offend him.
---
To quote Bruce Lee, "*You will continue to suffer if you have an emotional reaction to everything that is said to you. True power is sitting back and observing everything with logic. If words control you that means everyone else can control you. Breathe and allow things to pass.*"
---
Your actions, good and bad, have consequences. You have to take them as they come. Without getting upset when negative things are said about you.
---
The post vanished.

Sure- that's not the vibe I got from that thread though.
---
Priest in standard has this cards with **healing** synergy:
---
Northshire cleric, Quartz elemental, Auchenai soulpriest, Nightscale matriarch, and Auchenai phantasm. (not many, but more than just cleric)
---
This last year they have been more focused on **deathrattle** theme (quest, reckless experimenter...), **cloning** theme (vivid nightmare, shadow visions, zerek, mirage caller...), **ressurection** (spellstone, eternal servitude, mass ressurection...), **spell casting** (Lyra, dragons soul, shadow visions, Grave horror, sand drudge, radian elemental...), and recently in "**purifying** bad minions" to convert them into the light or whatever the lore is (Unsleeping soul, hench clan shadequill). Appart from that, they always had the **stat manipulation** synergies from classic buffed (they had inner fire and divine spirit, but they get stuff like topsy turvi, Lady in white, lazuls scheme...). Finnaly, they also have a **thief** mechanic, but that will mostly remain meme since it relies too much on rng and I doubt they start buffing it like they buffed thief rogue.
---
Priest HAS gotten more healing support, but they also get A LOT of other support for many other succesfull archetypes. Appart from that, they have some of the best removals printed often, so some spots for their cards are reserved for things like Mass hysteria, Psychic scream, or Forbidden words. Druid doesnt get any of this. They got some armor synergies in mammoth. Some ramp, treant and token synergies in raven (and the "feral druid" synergies that are similar to freeze shaman in succes, lol), and in this last year the class was basically the same 25 cards with the last 5 changed as the wincondition, and the last year was basically jade and some aggro stuff only in UNG carried by patches and other gadgetzan buff cards. They dont get removal like priest, most of their archetypes fail and the only succesfull synergies they have have been nerfed because of them being too strong. Let them try some healing synergies for once, let them keep printing some more "healing matter" cards for druid in future expansions so that they have something more to do other than treants  (thank god they keep printing treant cards, else it would be another failed archetype).
---
Priest has a lot of things and does/did a lot of them good. Dont bully druid, he is just finding a new archetype that doesnt feel "bullshit" and that they can rely on for the future :(
---
how does it matchup against bomb warrior?

Damn, so many cry babies in here. This community is trash.

Handlock yeah

Medivh goes where he pleases
---
When hearthstone queues multiple actions it locks them in and doesn't let new actions get added until it flushes the old ones.
---
So at end of turn the queue has: voodoo dies, mechc dies.
---
Voodoo says: HS kill reckless when you get a chance.
---
Mechc says: HS reckless is still on the board so I don't do anything.
---
Then the queue is empty and reckless's death is queued and processed.

It definitely doesn't do that. He's a full time streamer, and that's not a job which has a stable outcome. He can make some extra bucks with clickbait, fine by me. I just won't watch his videos.
---
I literally can't see what the fuss is all about.
---
You like him? Good! Go watch a content creator you enjoy!
---
You don't like him? Good! Go do something else you enjoy!
---
These things won't affect the next 5 years of your life, so it's not worth even wasting 5 minutes complaining about them.
---
Find I get goblin, missle launcher vs token/dyno vs aggro and a token meccathun
---
People should report his title and tell him to complain about it with Santa Claus instead of applauding/circlejerking around that kind of behavior.
---
im sure you were too upset about that lol
---
that's why they're tax exempt. just a struggling startup.
---
When it's your job, views = livelihood.
---
Also a clickbait title/thumbnail does not change the quality of the video.
---
That's why the art was changed back during Boomsday after all.
---
You can also be a small time streamer and make money. I'm not talking about DT's personality at all, I'm simply stating that streaming is a job. It can be a hobby, but it can also be a job.
---
Maybe i should've didnt realize the soyboys would come and downvote me
---
I think I lost only one match, where he highrolled two brawls. I had overall 5 losses between 5-legend. 1 warrior, 1 priest, and 3 rogues.
---
i wonder if it is because of the hs community starting to switch to other games?
---
click bait trash

That'd be [[Spell Slinger]]

3/3/4 | Battlecry: Add a random spell to each player's hand.  
---
hmm ill have to give it a look then, thanks!
---
I agree, I'm out of my depth here. 
---
The only point I wanted to make was that I don't think making clickbait titles can be justified by "But it generates more money" for someone who dabbles in what Disguised Toast does. That is all.
---
If you think it's okay then enjoy your clickbait.
---
Your example carries no weight. Everyone who loves Nic Cage, Johnny Depp, and Toast doesnt need to say it all the time, while the vocal minority will criticize and be loud and look large when really they're the smallest opinion group.
---
For the record I disagree with your points about acting, as a professional stage manager who works regionally with actors across the country, any successful actor who is acting as a profession is always doing more than local shows at regional theatres across the US. Local actors generally act as a side gig while they have a main job to pay rent. The only two cities where you can 100% just act and be local are Chicago and NYC
---
&gt; I could see getting between 1-4 APS for that turn.
---
Exactly! And you calling his 18-27 APM \*\*bad\*\* is wrong \*\*in the context of a Hearthstone match\*\*. In the context of all possible PC game matches you are right. Here lies the missunderstanding and the reason for the downvotes.
---
New keyword inc. Next expansion.
---
Apply cold hotfix to the burnt area.
---
what I hate most is the fact that they keep putting shit like this in the game
---
Toast's response to this thread was to rag on Kripp for a while, Kripp's response was to welcome Toast's fans into his chat and ask them to be civil .
---
Yeah, it should cost 2½ mana.  But, since they can't do that, it's 3 mana.  That means it's a bad card, but with all the random spell generation, some spells just need to be bad.
---
I would have to see what else he had but probably not
---
They are not unicorns. They either get banned swiftly or warp the world around them and ban people from playing the game. See Baku and Gen for reference.
---
I wonder how sales went for Blizzard this year. It would seem a lot of people just quit HS the last year. Including several big streamers abandoning the game.
---
To be fair you get rid of two of them
---
1. No I didn't come across it.
---
2. Are you talking about the twinspell treants? Because it seems like they wanted a new artwork for them.
---
3. Yes that's how I beat him the first time.
---
Actually you get a great variety rather than the same old decks every game. Honstky I can't believe people don't just go to wild it's awesome
---
It's not that funny of a joke though if you keep on making it over and over and over without changing anything about it.
---
The chart is:
---
&gt;Play a deck
---
&gt;Record
---
&gt;Create low quality thumbnail
---
&gt;Insert [100% winrate] "joke"
---
&gt;Profit
---
I mean, I get why he does it. I really do. And it's not because it's funny, it's because it works, and good on him! After all, that's his job.
---
Exactly. It works the same with \[\[Wargear\]\] too. The standard buff is 1/1 per mana. With Extra Arms, you sacrifice the +1/+1 for a rebate of getting the spell again. It's not the best, but it's completely in line with regular statlines. Same with \[\[Sound the Bells\]\] - where you sacrifice +1 attack for the Echo rebate.
---
Didn't know you could borrow, that's cool. My play style is usually preventing the enemy from having minions out if possible and I put damage on the hero quickly, any chance early on really. I guess this is aggro, maybe control? If I had a deck built for it, I'd be good with complex plays using lots of cards late game.
---
I like Lunara, even tho I don't really know much about her backstory. But the design is nice
---
He doesn't, but Toast *has* turned into a dick since the whole streamer house thing.

Hey lettyop, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it is directly or indirectly asking for upvotes. Do not upvote / don't upvote is intentionally removed, simple questions should be posted as just the question without any mention of upvoting or downvoting. If this is in error, please message the mods.
---
&gt; Is anyone going to Devastator after the rotation next year? Probably not.
---
After turn 9 it's conditionless **10 damage removal** with a decent body for **4 mana**, it's guaranteed to stay in warrior decks.
---
I mean, he has a point. Doesn't VS ignore mirror matches for creating winrate aggregate data? Because it only makes sense to do that.
---
Also, Misha makes no sense with Alleria
---
If not the worst...
---
How else would we counter those amp decks? Like apm priest, quest mage, and those other overly complicated and oppressive otk decks
---
Fair enough.
---
He seems very sensitive.
---
You were never able to dust them for full compensation.
---
Did you drop the game for while before the new standard year? Rexxar outvalued Boom in standard by a landslide for half a year.
---
&gt; Gaining infinite armor and stalling through your opponents entire deck shouldn't be a way to play hearthstone. 
---
Warrior has been doing this for like what? 5 years. A lot of people love it.
---
Even Druid did it for a while. So no, this style of playing is definitely a way to play Hearthstone.
---
Maybe you could learn to read before you complain. You do not get to dust them for a full refund, Blizzard just gives you the full dust refund  when you first log in, and you get to keep the card.
---
Well tier 3 doesnt mean losing every game i have a 58% winrate with it and i am actually not a good hs player
---
Nice screenshot of someone being an idiot. Congrats to you
---
If you had any of the Hall of Fame cards before the new expansion, you got full dust refunds for all the playable copies. It's not a disenchant refund like with nerfs.
---
Ok you played togwaggle. Grats I guess?
---
I would say you don't need force of nature or Loti, top token deck right now doesn't use either.
---
I didn't restart the game and just had the petals
---
Why I love kripp. Krip soyboy cuz of what he eats; toast actual soyboy.
---
He is neither of those things now.
---
Obviously never saw this interaction, but from experience: the 1/1 is a copy of the card, not the card itself, copies don't have any enchantments; if it's shuffled in your deck and you draw it, will it be a 1/1 or full card with full cost again? HS is sometimes pretty inconsistent, so I don't know, only Blizzard knows the way it's coded.
---
False. It’s clearly leokk.
---
Read before raging? You must be new to reddit!
---
Heh, is this a reference to something?
---
I dont know hat mech hunter your playing but it feels way different than the old deathrattle hunter (manly because of the absence of DK rexar)
---
ty :p
---
&gt; Gaining infinite armor and stalling through your opponents entire deck shouldn't be a way to play hearthstone.
---
Warrior has done this in the past, it's not the problem. The problem is being able to do it with 1 card.
---
[Here's the thread in question](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bdzkq1/shoutout_to_toast_for_not_losing_a_single_game_so/)
---
thanks man
---
Just your luck
---
Shoutout to OP for not understanding how jokes and humor work!
---
We said the same thing about Shudderwock, Big Priest, Barnes, and Jade Idol, but the devs think those are the best cards and mechanics they have ever created
---
It's blizzard's super secret system to discourage counterqueing trash.
---
 Lunara is Cenarius' daughter, not Malfurion's
---
You play DR minions, you resurrect them.   
---
Mech hunter gets it's shit pushed in by most of the meta decks. Noone is playing bomb warrior anymore so the point of playing hunter is lost.
---
Yeah, I don’t know what the developers’ intent was with Kalecgos, but to me it SEEMS like it’s inconsistent, but Hearthstone does have a lot of tricky wording and timing.
---
Ah well, thanks for at least checking wording with me.
---
It really ruins it when you do it by netdecking
---
What about maiev
---
What res effects did old deathrattle hunter have?
---
1. It's their class identity
---
2. Other classes  got more threats, Warrior was lacking removals.
---
3. Their 1 year worth of class sets in Year of the Mammoth was underwhelming.
---
Even now, Warrior is unable to consistently remove everything a Mech Hunter, Hand Mage, Token Druid, Ress Priest are bringing on table.
---
It feels like some people on this subreddit don't even play HS...
---
Have you tried Duel! and Prismatic Lens Paladin?
---
Paying 5 mana and having Ysera fight a random minion from their deck is pretty new.  Also runs lots of new cards like Big Bad Archmage.
---
(I would also argue that Magic Carpet Zoo plays pretty different from previous zoo decks, due to how different Magic Carpet is as a card, but I definitely see the argument that it’s still a zoo deck).
---
Mason Steel doesn't click bait. Great content too. I recommend.
---
The game peaked a long time ago.
---
People are sleeping on Rez Priest hard right now.  If you are stuck in a pocket meta of heal decks, you can't out heal a 48/48 Moshogg Enforcer.  Also, tempo Rogue right now is capable of crazy burst damage that's near impossible to out heal.
---
A bit havier Rogue maybe, with more card generation, Nomi, Edwin and Sap. 
---
Mech Hunter with Oblivitron + Mechanical Welp + Nine Lives works wonders too against control decks.
---
You are very much right, I got confused. But wasn't Malfurion married to Tyrande?
---
All those decks are nonviable vs the meta currently.
---

---
Honestly it feels like they forgot the entire reason keywords exist in card games in the first place.
---
Just saw his reply to this, such a beta response from a beta streamer lol.
---
Thoughts on whispering woods?
---
YOU WOULDN'T STEAL A CAR
---
They are but they have no kids because Malfurion is too busy sleeping/talking to animals/fucking Ysera
---
The original designers had programmed Hearthstone in the language they did(unity?), expecting it to just be a demo. Blizzard instead said nah, just release that.
---
I've done really well with Hunter.  That 2 face dmg a turn works well wonders.
---
I clicked on a Kripp video that said "Gepetto Skill shots." Two matches. He didn't even get Gepetto in the first match, and didn't play it in his second.
---
I won't make that mistake again.
---
What I experienced was rather like my opponent does his turn in a regular speed and then just waits until the end of the rope to pass the turn.
---
Maybe he was doing something while roping, but in my book that’s BM
---
You get full dust back anyways when something gets nerfed, so I don't see a problem.
---
It helps a lot that I used my "Wanted to disenchant golden Kangor's Army but I resisted and now it is in a viable, fun deck" card. 
---
I really am happy :)
---
Are you judging Boom purely on what it could last xpac? Did you miss the part of the card reveals that gave Warrior the value it needed in this xpac?
---
? What is this post even?
---
Dude poker has wayyyy more rng than hearthstone. There's a ton of variance in that game, you just play around it. Bad beats happen all the time. Good poker players just look at the big picture, like good hearthstone players.
---
Go second as a rogue or druid and you get to keep your Boom Bot.
---
I feel kind of dumb because I don't get it.
---
Haha, well, I'm being educated too it seems! Any who, I don't know that much about the lore and even I know this chart is inaccurate.
---
Mass resurrection or Catrina Muerte
---
I read that in Zilliax's voice.
---
Idk reading through the comments in this thread feels weird to me; maybe I am bias because I continue to watch him on and off for years- things like click baiting titles or his "rudeness" don't really bother me because at the end of the day I do genuinely like his character and personality; I don't have the right words, but I've always enjoyed his sense of humour and frankness for his motivation
---
Reading between the lines you can tell that he truly cares for his family and friends (and animals; any animal lover in my books has some good qualities about them)
---
Whenever I see him succeed at something I can't help but feel good for the guy- I've tried to reassess my overall opinion of him from reading this thread but I guess I'm just unable to hate the guy regardless of his supposed contradictions
---
I feel a little silly defending him- as my opinion will fade into obscurity over something that inherently doesn't really matter
---
welcome to the shadow realm
---
If people rope when there's no decision to be made, they're the ones so self-obsessed that they don't care about their opponent's time. Roping them back reminds them that, hey, there is another person here so be a bit more considerate. They usually get the message and then there's no more roping from either party.
---
Nobody is talking about people who rope during a tough turn. Stop assuming that. The problem is with people that wait 40 seconds to hero power on turn 2 or people that make their trades, spend their Mana and do nothing instead of ending their turn.
---
and you wouldn’t you put a 3 mana summon 2 legendary minions?
---
But skill DOES outweigh RNG. You're just not playing correctly if RNG outweighs skill. That's what I'm saying.
---
Omega Devastator is a new and that too a class card. It makes the card so much better. Also the other new bomb mech dude isn't bad either
---
It should have been a legendary, lowering its appearances. It shows up far too often from the discovers.
---
Undertaker
---
&gt; for half a year.
---
I mean that's really not THAT long. We've had classes go for over a year being oppressive. Priest was under 1% playrate the year before that (Purify LUL) if I remember correctly.  
---
Paladin (Odd, Even, Secret, Exodia), Druid (Jade, Spiteful, Malygos, Togwaggle), Hunter (Spell, Midrange), Rogue (Odd, Pirate), Warlock (Even, Cube, Zoo), and Warrior (Pirate, Quest, Odd) have all been played far more than Priest in the last 2 years. Mage and Shaman were played about as much as Priest because they've been in and out of viability..
---
His intro music is mighty. I love it.
---
Echo still exists, in the since that cards still say "Echo". But Witch's Brew; which is literally an Echo card, even in the games code, went back to the way unstable Evolution was worded. Pretty much making Echo an abandon keyword. In fact, during the Witch's Brew card reveal, Trump asked why it wasn't an Echo? The Blizzard developer said they don't want the game to be cluttered with keywords, so some will be limited to "their expansions", even when later cards with identical effects are released. To quote "avoid confusion".
---
Did I miss something? Is that actually a card in the game?
---
Sure can.
---
"Repeatable this turn" is slightly different than "Echo". The actual effect is the same, but e.g. the synergies are different. See [[Mistwraith]]. It's a detail ... but yeah.
---
Same story with the ability of Y'Shaarj, which is very similar to Recruit but actually works different in terms of minion positions.

From wicker boughs, hear my plea! These cursed spells I give to thee! Is also really great
---
Ah. I see
---
4 meta decks??? wow that's a lot.
---
Well Tempo Rogue is relatively cheap if you have been playing for a while. The core legendaries are classic. Honestly this is probably the bare minimum that you need to hit legend.
---
Midrange Hunter is decent and cheap. (only money card being Zuljin... I think off the top of my head). The deck is a good counter against Warrior but loses to Rogue.
---
Zoo Warlock has two legendaries and both are kinda optional but better to have (Rafaam and Soularium). its a great counter against Token Druid.
---
Token Druid is the best deck in the meta and runs only 1 legendary that is also optional. (Well 2 legendaries but everyone gets Vargoth for free)
---
The mandatory Legendaries for these 4 decks are Captain Greenskin, Leeroy, Zuljin, and Vargoth.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bdvpc6/rise_of_shadows_budget_decks_guides_for_all_9/

So I’m pretty new and didn’t understand the whole shifting meta and the concept of cards going into wild. I get like I had perfected my Elemental Shaman deck and was actually doing really well grinding up the ranks. Well half of those cards are wild now with rise of shadows and I just have no idea where to go from here. I feel like I dusted a lot of stuff to get that elemental shaman deck and it’s gone :/.
---
A warlock did this do me, so I froze his rafaam and played a doomsayer and burned his face.
---
He has nothing he can really do on reaction... so he passed
---
Next turn I burned his face and played another doomsayer.
---
He still had no answers.
---
Next turn I burned his face and brought him to 1 health.
---
He played out his hand with OP's combo and next turn lost.
---
**Tip for burn decks: save your doomsayer's in this matchup.** It bought me 3 turns of burn for 2 mana
---
Who is the best rogue player??
---
I would hope so lol
---
Bad priest.
---
I’m not repeating the trauma that machine gun priest was
---
Group C is brutal
---
Yes
---
Forgot to discuss epics. I'll assume that rares and commons are easy to get.
---
Waggle Pick and Masters call are mandatory. You can probably run Boar Control's initial version which doesn't run waggle but I don't know how that deck has aged since a week.
---
For Zoo you need magic carpet.
---
I really dislike aggro/zoo myself but its pretty cheap to create 4 aggressive decks. Zoolock, murloc shaman, token druid, tempo rogue.
---
Control decks are ofcourse always expensive.

When Hagatha hero is up, Minion Hagatha says another thing. When your enemy is Hagatha, she says another line.

That's really bothering me now.  The wiki doesn't have her entry line, and Hearthpwn doesn't have any lackeys.  She looks like she's punching, so maybe "Swing left".  This is going to drive me crazy now.

---
Yah, decks with secrets in it. Come on man.
---
A big factor still comes down to RNG. Good rng—you burn the bombs and get the cards you want. Bad RNG—you eat bombs to the face and never draw nomi.
---
Do you have a decklist?
---
Bunnyhoppor
---
Yah ok what?
---
I think the tweet is sarcastic.
---
Salty nerds lol
---
Because expansions have limited space. And they rotate. The Classes need a support base for the rotation system. If you put the support base in expansions you have to print "Priest Win Con" every year along with "Priest Boardclear"  and "Priest Big Heal". The expansions need the space to furfill their themes, not patch the game.
---
Again this is a focus problem,  not a power one. The new cards can and should be on the weaker side.
---
Not blaming any players, I play the deck too. It’s still busted.
---
Unity. Precision. Perfection.
---
It is fairly common for F2P players to dust all wild cards so they can keep up with standard rotations.
---
No. Despite the animation being similiar, milled cards are not discarded.
---
Lol at players who identify themselves with a hs class
---
I think (and I agree with everyone else here) that Discover was added as a new keyword that would be constantly in the game, as opposed to things like Echo or Twinspell, which they plan to rotate out.
---
It's not a mistake LOL. It's called card rotation. There were evolve cards before snowfury giant was a card oh my god.
---
Why is hench clan sneak in hunterace's mage deck?
---
why can't all legendaries be like nefarian and have multiple voicelines
---
May I get your decklist? Would be awesome!
---
But can magnetic onto so clearly better.
---
I mean any deck has a chance of getting bad starting hands, that does not mean that you have no way to play yourself out of a bad situation especially with the tools warrior has right now.

Is toast the villain of this subreddit now ?
---
But did you win?
---
He would've drawn the first next turn, drawn rhino afterwards and then drawn the second bomb on turn 2.
---
So in any scenario where he doesn't have lethal next turn, which he doesn't since he has an empty hand, then this description is completely accurate.
---
ABCDEGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
---
Yah cause Hearthpwn is a shit website run by curse.
---
"Livelihood" is a very poor choice of wording when you're talking about someone like Toast who makes upwards of 20k per month on Twitch alone. He's not struggling to pay his bills here.
---
EVIL Miscreant is just a busted card in general. It’s both tempo AND value, and the 5 health is usually sturdy enough to get a couple attacks in. Also enables their combos and gives them outs in otherwise hopeless games. And if you can’t kill it, it might get Shadowstepped for even more value! It is so, so strong.
---
As annoying as it is to deal with in Standard I can’t imagine how ridiculous it is in Arena where there are even fewer answers available. And it’s in 75% of rogue decks which is pretty absurd.
---
ive never played wild before, just been playing off and on for a year now.. whats wild like

I have the opposite problem, I keep fucking tapping first when I have a single Soulfire in my hand to topdeck the other soulfire, which wouldve been lethal :/

Then we'll have a society that knows what a 100% win rate is.

It just means they moved cards up/down buckets based on pick rates. I don't recall the exact percentages off the top of my head, but cards that get picked too much get moved up a bucket and cards that don't get picked much get moved down a bucket.
---
and then they did print the 11-drop to fill the gap, but now they left it as it is. Again, what I want to say is that there should be an 11-drop in the standard if they want to have an evolve mechanic too.
---
You can agree or disagree with my point of view and that's why I made the post, to see if others agree or not.
---
Haha glad you're enjoying yourself.
---
I pulled it off once and still lost feelsbadman.
---
Your mother is a murloc!
---
While Maiev most certainly is a way worse character in terms of WoW lore and all, she's cool in hearthstone
---
Cheezy#21504 80 GOLD QUEST
---
Whats that 30-30 card, never seen it b4 cuz im a noob
---
That's not how hearthstone between no it right now works. when you draw a card you draw a random card from your deck not the top card.
---
Where can I see which players are more lucky than others?
---
But you get Talanji from Rafam, so can you really count her as a seperate piece of the puzzle?
---
You're right, some keywords like Inspire rotated out and weren't used again but there isn't any reason they can't be.
---
Like, discover isn't explained anywhere specifically so echo could be brought back the same way discover has been.
---
These are all widely known things in this sub that have been posted multiple times. Just like your original post. Whoosh but also maybe browse a little more before posting something like this.
---
Heal all friendly characters for the amount of damage dealt.
---
Ah ty, mb for not knowing of the spreadsheet.
---
"RUIN. DESPAIR. DESTRUCTION." intensifies.
---
Not many good 3 drops available for Mage atm. 3/3 stealth is just decent for an aggressive deck.
---
YOuOOu uP tO NOe gOeeeeOD MEeeTU
---
I tried, but its impossible to keep up with some decks. As an example token Druid and murloc shaman eat that deck. You just don’t have the answers even if you run baron geddon, mossy horror, fan of knives, etc. You just can’t deal with those boards in time and just lose.
---
I don’t know if I should even mention how you can’t deal with handmage and tempo rogue. Lol.
---
He got unlucky and is salty

RAFAAAAAAM! THE SUPREME ARCH-THIEF!
---
Yah they printed the 11 drop. After a fucking year. LOL. Whole year of mistakes. 3 Sets without an 11 drop. They really dropped the ball on that one!
---
Zoos without Rafam, Tempo Rogues without a ton of legendaries... That makes my super low budget for this expansion happy.
---
control warrior is fine and will always be fine for any meta to keep aggro decks in check. the real problem is Elysiana being a neutral card giving every class the opportunity to have 10 extra cards. It makes the fatigue game all about rng, who gets better discovers and thats a big problem for me.
---
God damn it I hate that thing.
---
It doesn’t make sense for Blizzard to print cards at a certain mana cost because of one card that has one mechanic. And now that I think about it, I don’t think there are any new 12 drops either, so...
---
Cards drawn and discovered by tracking are completely random. There is no actual deck order to drawing, a random card is just selected from the cards you have left in your deck, unlike a physical card game.
---
Mages can highroll like no other class. It’s a lot like Big Priest where you can just instawin 10% of games regardless of what the opponent plays.
---
Ow boy here we go
---
Its still in classic
---
Messenger Raven is not a 3 drop. You'd be pretty sad to play it on 3. 
---
The list seems to be build to be more proactive. You want minions to support that, not more draw.
---
I'd say probably not. Blizzard didn't mention any new games modes this year (which is kind of ridiculous) but the fact they are rotating certain cards from past sets into arena is intriguing. It makes me wonder if they are playing with arena a bit to experiment before making any changes to standard (to see how the community responds). I wouldn't be surprised down the line if they come up with some sort of 'Tier' format (maybe similar to MTG?) that allows for certain past cards to be played. 
---
MTG had quite a few sets if I recall before a major tier system went into effect but when I played if I recall there was type 1, 1.5, 2 and extended (or something like that). Now it's apparently legacy (any set), vintage (back to 2003), modern and standard - with some cards banned entirely (since Blizzard can nerf live, don't think there's any reason to go there).
---
I would like to see something similar in HSTONE though. Wild which is essentially Legacy is pretty hard for new players to get into given the massive collection you need, but it'd be neat to see something that rotates every expansion and includes certain sets/cards as part of that 'standard' set. And maybe have different legendary card backs to entice play?
---
EVERYONE GET IN HERE
---
Wow I've never had even 2 legendaries in the same pack...
---
It is the highest Win Rate deck.
---
No you didn't, you said it was a mistake LOL
---
Ahh I see the issue here. For some reason, you think your feelings and opinions about a meta matter. They don't, the meta is the meta.
---
You can spend all day in fairyland saying this would be different in a different meta, but that's crap. We don't have a different meta.
---
Mech hunter has a 54% winrate, it is a viable deck regardless of what you think.
---
I've played that deck and warrior is actually one of it's worse matchups, they're one of the only classes that can deal with up to 3 Nomis and if they're the bomb variant they can easily kill you in fatigue by shuffling some bombs in your deck.
---
I love not having to make a deck. Hate randomized. Just comes down to who gets less shit useless cards.
---
perocu#1420 trade on ASIA
---
Oh.. i realised the focus was his 66k dust. Sorry about that.
---
Awww did someone get made fun of on the internet?
---
Not according to HSReplay. Not by a lot. 
---
Zoolock is the highest WR deck in Legend to 5. Then control Warrior, then Tempo Rogue.
---
This is not true. 
---
Classes in Arena are balanced two ways: Bucketting and Microadjustments. Basically Blizzard decided to rebucket cards for every class except for Rogue, but issued a microadjustment to Rogue.
---
This means, as stated in the original post, "overperforming Rogue cards will be seen less frequently."
---
Maybe you’ve collected all the Legendaries from the classic set?
---
I might play hearthstone again if that were to happen.
---
It happens if you have all the legendaries of that expansion
---
You can open duplicates if you have all legendaries from that expansion.  (Ex; all classic legendaries lets you open a duplicate classic legendary.)
---
Maybe they will revert the nerf to big game hunter to 3 mana again so you can tech the card, or will introduce a crab minion that target elemental in next 2 set.
---
For now you have to mulligan for specific card combo like warrior execute and someway to damage it or armor + shield slam, 
---
if you're running murloc deck ,use the toxfin combo.
---
Priest/Mage/Shaman and Rogue have access to cheap spell that can get rid of them. It's warrior,hunter ,paladin and druid that currently have trouble with their card because they need more turns.
---
not debating that token isnt broken but...
---
Keeper of the Grove, Ancient of Lore, Force of Nature, Innervate, Wild Growth, Nourish, Naturalize got all nerfed or hofed.
---
I think that's enough
---
Meta will slow down with time and OTK decks will start emerging again. But for now I don't see any usage of it.
---
Maybe you should be playing a fighting game then. The beauty of card games is maximizing the RNG, that's what makes a player better than another. You can't guarantee wins, but you can maximize your odds.
---
Mooooom, Alleria's taken Vereesa's Thori'dal and isn't giving it back! I have a tree to burn down in half an hour!
---
I will pick disguisedtoast. Oh wait...
---
Al'akir - Can attack immediately(including heroes), can attack twice in one turn, the first time this minion takes damage all damage is ignored, enemy minions cannot attack your hero while this minion is on the board.
---
I skipped Rasta entirely, so bring em on!
---
Go on HSreplay or VS DRlive and look at its individual winrates. Mech hunter loses to every aggro deck... bad. Once news gets out, it is going to have to change drastically or die.
---
It's viable *now*. I doubt that will last. Handbuff Hunter was viable week 1 of MSOG too. I know. I played it then. Then everyone discovered Pirates.
---
Circlejerk
---
Exactly
---
For how many weeks?
