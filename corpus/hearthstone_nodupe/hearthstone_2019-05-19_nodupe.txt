Many might not like these matches, but these are my favourites :)

It's as if you rerolled the boss.  You don't get a win or a loss, your run doesn't end, and you face another boss at the same position.
---
From a pure value sense? It could be worse since the legendary is cool and can be used like whizbang... alternatively 26 packs could shore up a good meta deck for you if you just bought packs
---
What about Whitemane??
---
I'd be fine with any amount of deck slots, as long as they fixed all the bugs.

---
The last time I built over nine decks, the first nine disappeared from the Play menu. I had to delete some of them to make the rest come back.
---
I was going to take that card on a run last night, but I wasn't sure completely how it worked. Does it change all your minions into a copy for the rest of your run? Or just for the match you're currently playing?

Should’ve played around it.

Good point.  Lyra and Stargazer Luna can as well, so that will probably happen more often than getting a board full of Darkness.  At least that way your hand is full, though, so you have a good chance to win anyway.

All you had to do was not play elder first.  Like Nova then togg
---
Effects that care about cost use the modified costs of cards, with the sole exception of [[Skulking Geist]]. If your minion doesn't cost 1 when you play it, it won't count toward the quest.

Back in Dungeon Run, people were talking about making players fight each other with their decks after they beat the 8th boss. At this point I don't think "broken" really even describes the shenanigans that defines Dalaran decks.
---
Confujen #2413 NA 80g trade, doesnt matter who goes first as long as we both show.
---
Mage feels broken, with the cost reduction hero power and especially if you get the double hero power treasure. The Burn deck with spell power synergy is fun. 
---
Hunter feels good if you get scavenging hyena shenagans or the stealth treasure.

Shaman took me forever to win with. Terrible starting decks and horrible card choices sometimes. Only won once.

I had all those cards because i loved big hunter before the rotation. I didnt get the reduce by 5. I had a very clogged hand the first few turns. His dragoncaller was only 1 dragon. He tried like 3 spells to get rid of gahzrilla but couldnt hence the 1 health. I was gonna be so mad if he killed it.

---
Did a lot of people in the proscene support this format before it was implemented? As a very occasional casual viewer, I find it much less entertaining because you see far fewer classes &amp; decks altogether. I even prefer the original format they used back in the very early days of ESGN Fight Night over this. I'm sure some people will disagree with me here and there are definitely good reasons for their choice to adopt this format though.
---
Tech in either a flight master or a mad summoner
---
You mean mage right? Because mage has an 80% winrate in the format as of now.
---
Be thankful almost all of them are bomb and not pure control
---
Just saw that. I don't think you've given other decks (mainly control shaman) a chance, you've basically just said "warrior is good for x and x reasons"
---
I played a decent bit of Destiny, mostly the first one. Haven’t come across this boss in the Heist yet though.
---
Based on the wording of the card, it's permanent. Specifically says all minions in your ADVENTURE deck, not just your deck
---
You’re in luck friend. I happen to know someone who JUST played mech hunter
---
Well when you have a billion people I would think a few might have a different opinion.
---
Meta deck bad
---
The truest comment that works for everything ever
---
If I remember correctly you choose one class and one deck. Then you get I think two or three more decks of the same class with almost all of the same cards but you can change a few of the cards which basically works like a sideboard in other card games. Then you play best of 3, after the first game you can "side in" one of your other decks to hopefully counteract your opponents strategy somewhat
---
If you're only considering Standard cards, you missed Shadowform in Priest.
---
It would be cool if you could collect them, but I feel like they shouldn't be as extravagant as the heroes which you have to pay for. I feel like if blizzard just made them all available just as a new skin with emotes but without a fancy entrance or hero power animation would still keep the novelty of the other skins that can't be acquired for free, and yet still be a good reward for playing the solo adventures.
---
don't think you understand the problem with what one card here has done as the board prior was more than enough to kill and the hero card has enabled opportunity to remove my lethal push with random generation

Shaw is unlikely considering he’s already a card. However, none of the Dalaran heroes nor Rikkar are cards.

Yeah, for warrior.

Not sure how you've got so many upvotes. Elysiana may add the problem, but Control Warrior has always been long. It's a matchup where you just dump the worst card from your hand every turn. 
---
The problem is really that we have a meta where two classes dominate. People should give Specialist a real chance for a more balanced  situation. Maybe Blizzard shouldn't have introduced it right after such an impactful rotation. Of course it doesn't work then.

Really appreciate your optimism OP. That's what we need in the game

When everyone brings Warrior there needs to be one guy to take them on!

Its like in a tryhard anime where the new guy joins the pro team \^\^

This technically makes sense.  If this happened in a game you wouldn't expect the copy in your deck to be buffed.

Yeah I tossed Bloodmage in all my control decks but haven’t played much besides warrior and otk pally the last week or so. Big shaman too.

I disagree. Your aversion to Rafaam speaks for itself. You've never actually played a deck with Rafaam in it, have you? I run it in my control Warlock for the fun factor. Using Rafaam in situations where it's your Hail Mary play, like some sort of Yogg, is but a fringe use for the card. Most of the time I'm very much in a healthy state and I have to weigh my options. Is my opponent spent enough? Do I keep my board clear spells and card I know will be useful to me or go for the tempo play and hope I have enough pressure with the legendaries to close out?
---
Shit, sometimes I just use it for the taunt. Cards like Rafaam will never be a problem, no matter how much you try to make them seem so. Yogg was an issue because he affected the state of the game immediately upon being played. Pre-nerf, you could absolutely count on him to clear the board for you and perhaps dish out some damage to the opponents face or summon minions. That's a complete power swing.
---
Right now, you play Rafaam and you most likely pass your turn. It's a 7 mana card so you have 3 mana left to do something other than playing a 7/8 taunt. It's telegraphed and gives your opponent plenty of time to react. And if you were losing the game at that point, Rafaam will do little to swing it back in your favor.

No the overload guy so just overpowered in general. Even in normal mode where his overload cards trigger twice he’s still nearly killed me every time I’ve encountered him. I’m working on 100% normal mode and 2/3 deaths were because of him.
---
But I will say from what little I’ve messed with heroic that it does seem to be scaled much more similarly to dungeon run with an appropriate challenge
---
Control archetypes are harder to play than aggro, but let's stop pretending it's fucking rocket science. You get a handle of how things are supposed to work with any given control deck after 15-20 games playing it. An additional 5-10 games and you already know what you want to mulligan and what you're hoping to draw. This hard to get into, hard to understand nonsense needs to stop.
---
Cant get my game to update either
---
I know that's why I have all the coins

Now that you mention it, I can't quite remember the last time I faced an aggro por midrange  deck and their hands dropped below 4 cards.

Not exactly, it's just I'm not that good at it. My 12 win deck was an insane Mage during KoTF with multiple Flamestrikes, Primordial Drakes, Blizzards e.t.c. Most of the time I go like 3-3 or 4-3 so I don't really like spending gold on it.

Good mini-essay, I'm pretty happy with a lot of the singleplayer rewards in the great heist but I really think the option for customization with hero skins is a key part of the game that feels somewhat underbaked. It's getting there, but more really couldn't help.
---
Idea sounds pretty awesome to be honest. I would be into that for sure! Definitely would suck when you occasionally went against that guy who gets the awesome steamroll combo while you get shafted. But hey, that happens in regular Hearthstone from time to time as well.
---
That's not how that works
---
You have to remember the deck playing it is zoo. You play this card when you've lost all steam and control of the board as a sort of "okay let me drop this and hope it bails me out" I personally like the card but let's not say there's a huge risk to playing it.
---
So I think that’s because there’s no delay between them (because of no animation) so two -2HP things appear on top of each other. Adding the animation should fix that.

By the way, I recently started playing HS again after quite a long break. Currently, I have bomb warrior and tempo rogue and I'm able to craft a 3rd one, what advice would you give me?  I was thinking, maybe a murloc shaman, or a control warrior, or a token druid, I just don't know which would work best for grinding. I know this isn't the best place to post this question but I'm sure you're an experienced player and would have an idea about this subject
---
They kinda have to switch up next time, this is the ultimate dungeon run type content. If they do something like this again, it'll just feel super bland and boring.
---
So the passive treasures can repeat themselves! I never knew this.
---
Addressing individual cards should never be done with a sweeping rule change, especially when that rule change is being done to address cards that will eventually rotate.
---
Sooo many other games offer tons of customization, with varying quality over other content. Not all alternate hero portraits need to be flashy. The primo ones can be purchasable with all the effects and interacts with other cards. I just want to be able to play as cool characters like Tess. Most of the time I don't like the preorder heroes, but I still collect them all lol. 
---
Bottom line, if Blizzard wants to sell them instead having to earn them, I would definitely pay like $5.99 per bundle of alternate heroes from each solo adventure.
---
I wasn't a fan of that format for Mtg, but it might work for HS.

A Prince's Ring should be rated at least Average, not bad. Yes, you don't get the passives of Death Knights but saying that Hero Powers offered by Prince's Ring are only '*marginally*' better than the starting ones is an exaggeration. Even if your Frost Lich Jaina's elementals won't have Lifesteal, you still summon a free 3/6 every single turn - how is that marginally better, really? It's far better than majority of the starting Hero Powers.
---
Also, god knows for what reason, but you've listed the Class list here in this post starting with Hunter, where it's only the third class from the left in the game, not the first one, so why not have the list here, on reddit, be sorted in an order representative to the one in the game (Mage first, Shaman second and Hunter third)?

---
That’s hilarious hahaha Blizzard has outdone themselves
---
maybe you should use that reddit feature where you get seperate accounts for different subreddits.
---
Things like nine lives and eternal servitude ARE still more likely to hit class minions than not. So your change would bring more rng to a mechanic that is suposed to combat it (while not being 100% consistent) instead of addresing the problem of really high and unstopable value generation in just one card. You will in fact gut most discover cards with this idea.
---
I may agree that gutting/rotating mad genius earlier is not the solution, but this discover change is not it either. I would expect more bad mechs to get printed for warrior soon in the next expansion, and between that, a bigger card pool and more avaiable strategies, that warrior wont be seen as a big problem.
---
I don’t remember toki being that difficult to beat win with tbh, I think I had the most difficult with shaw. None of them were that hard though (and the final challenge was easy as fuck). I’m enjoying dalaran but the final bosses are too easy on normal mode, every time I’ve lost a run it’s been on round 5 or 6, and once in round 4.

And then finally I had no choice but believe in RNHagatha and play her Horror - summoning Mechathun from my oppenents hand into Hagatha's Scheme to clear the board!
---
But the real reason for this whole post is that I wanted to thank my opponent for this thrilling match! I couldn't tell you ingame because you left very fast after but.... WELL PLAYED!
---
Blessed Hagatha - the only true Villain!

No way, [meta card] was played against [meta card]? That's insane
---
"I am literally unable to comprehend the value of buying singleplayer content" isn't that logical
---
Then you have people like me who never get to rank 10, or never play ranked. Maybe matches played?
---
As a huge slay the spire fan, no. The two are made with completely different ideas and set-ups in mind, and Slay the spire is more comparable to a deck full of burn cards - utilising the minions as an aspect as Hearthstone is wont to do sets the two apart. Both have their merits and flaws, too, and appeal to different people.
---
Mindbreaker perhaps?
---
or it just doesnt work because small indie company.

 EmpNer#1731 NA, 80g trade. I show, you go first.
---
You're thinking Kibler's Pomeranian.  I'm not sure what Allie's Shiba Inu is called, she calls it Doge a lot.
---
I have the same issue, but the tone of this adventure makes me happy whether or not i win. Probably because there are some things to unlock that dont require you to beat the whole run. I love it, and i am running it endlessly to unlock decks/powers.
---
Where's S1lverName?? ((
---
You right. But I'm really happy that somebody commented my 1-st post.=D
---
I noticed that she always happens to pull the lowest cost minions first. Must be a balance thing
---
he is a pretty tough boss even with bigger minions. I've only faced him once, and with all the huge shit he throws down, -2 attack hurts in the long run.
---
&gt;doesnt want faitgue to be a win-condition
---
&gt;print out mill cards
---
&gt;????????
---
How the fuck do people get Coldarra Drake in their buckets all the time?  I have never seen the damn thing.
---
Heroic is included already. 9 Heroes x 5 Levels x 2 Difficulties = 90 Wins :)
---
Also Happy Cake Day!

Nice combo man!
---
Thank you :)
---
Yeah same! Also I'll stay focused on only winning each chapter with each hero once for now and do the winning with all decks and HP's later
---
Say hello to Mass Hysteria

Murloc decks are what got me into Hearthstone and they've added new murlocs. I stopped playing for a while and dusted all my old legendaries when I got back and crafted all the murloc cards. I'm having the most fun I've had in Hearthstone in wild with it now than I've ever had.
---
Well the problem seems your hyper focus, less so the content given.

Imagine a tournament format where it is best of 5 and you can only bring one deck from each class, and if you win with that deck you can’t play that same deck again going forward.
---
Haha, yeah I know, sometimes it is just over the top. But I am still grateful for the mass of content we were given this time and I love it so far
---
Hi, I moderate multiple subreddits, hold down a full time job, and am married with a kid.  So, kind of ruins that theory, huh?
---
I was so amazed as well. Not so long ago I got the "play 50 murlocs quest" and decided to do it with Murloc Shaman in Wild. Got from 25 (since I didn't play wild in some time) to 5 in no time. The deck can really pull off some weird stuff with Angler, or Finja pulling Scargill into vomiting all your hand on board etc. 
---
Really enjoying the deck so far.
---
The guy who is most likely to win?  Secret hunter is a great matchup against rogue (especially if you run a weapon removal tech too), the best if you don't want to fall asleep playing warrior too.
---
I think we can settle on the middle ground. Make the skins unlockable with a lot of gold. Maybe 1000 or the same 700 for an act of an adventure. That is a lot of gold so in a way, the skins WILL be premium, but F2P players will still be able to get them with enough dedication.
---
Yet looking at the most recent vS report it's dropping in play and win rates, HSReplay support this also.  
---
It's pretty easy to tech against, if you are meeting a lot of rogues and struggling to beat them yet choose not to tech to beat them - that's on you.
---
No, Barnes really is not a problem, but the amount of value you get through chaining resurrects is really too much for many decks to contest. So you can't really count on beating them in long games, but rather only through aggro or combo.
---
The one true god of hearthstone
---
What's wrong with me then? I aced Shaw on first try and Toki like on third but it's been a year and I can't beat the run with Tess or Crowley at all.
---
Because people play Warrior. Look at high legend ladder. Every 2nd matchup was Warrior cause everyone was sick of losing to Rogue.
---
Obviously that will tank the play/winrate of Rogue but if you compare how each deck does *overall* against all other classes Rogue had far better matchups overall than Warrior
---
I know people always love to whine about Boom Hero and all that crap cause they play Rogue themselves cause games are simple an fast but Rogue was always the bigger problem than Warrior. Deal with it.
---
Sometimes always lucky.
---
Who dis
---
Yeah, the concept is good but it feels like it wasn't developed as deeply as i would have liked.
---
Clearly you wait a few minutes and try again
---

---
In this case the price in cash is lowered afaik.
---
Wait, forgot that I dont care about random streamers
---
I wish effects stacked for some crazy runs though. I used the +4/+4 on a minion, then added 3 copies of it to my deck. It looked like buffed copies were added, but it was just the standard card.
---
Those are combo disruption cards, you're not supposed to mill your opponent with them. The idea is you pull/trash your opponent's vital combo pieces to destroy their win condition.
---
the idea is getting them to fatique closer.
---
&gt;Because people play Warrior. Look at high legend ladder. Every 2nd matchup was Warrior cause everyone was sick of losing to Rogue.  
---
Sooo lots of people are playing warrior ...
---
&gt;but if you compare how each deck does overall against all other classes Rogue had far better matchups overall than Warrior  
---
But Warrior has a better overall winrate than rogue  
---
&gt;I know people always love to whine about Boom Hero and all that crap cause they play Rogue themselves cause games are simple an fast but Rogue was always the bigger problem than Warrior. Deal with it.  
---
People complain about Warrior because it's the most boring as fuck, plays itself deck there is.  
---
Don't see anyone complaining too much about hunter yet and that's the best class in game easily right now.
---
Replace? No. Adding anything to the game? Sure.
---
From my limited experience, heroic is on par with dungeon run difficulty
---
Oh cool! Thanks
---
Scar#2418, EU 80G q Trade, can go first!
---
that’s awesome haha
---
The difference is that zilliax will be a staple for a year and a half, whereas ragnaros would have been a staple for 5 years and running. Zilliax will eventually rotate naturally, but sylv and rag wouldn't, so they stepped in and did it manually.
---
Miskatonic#1372 on NA with the 80 gold quest.
---
Cast when drawn also draws another card to replace itself.
---
Provided you have a decent early game, you can win by just going coin 8/9 drop, fake coin fake coin, rinse repeat. On heroic his deck is basically a crappy version of tempo / thief rogue without any of the game finishers besides Tess, not to mention I don't think he has any form of removal. And if you are lucky enough to get lich king and Kel thuzard down you basically already won. Just watch out for eviscerate and vendetta on your Kel thuzard
---
I hope that in a few expansions times the Bartender is a boss that finally comes to collect his tab (because he’s always saying “I’ll put it on your tab!”).
---
I mean it’s the same between the first two wings right? Not that it’s certain there won’t be extra options, but you wouldn’t expect it
---
Sounds positib, tank yu.
---
Thanks! Makes way more sense than what I did - Malygos, Kalecgos, and then panic once I realized I could no longer time warp on the same turn anymore.
---
From there I played Thalnos and fireballed the Majordomo and passed. Boss didn't kill me, which let me kill with Rag/time warp.
---
I chose the random death knight hero power as a reward, and then set it up with the blackwald pixie
---
True but the first two wings were planned to release at the same time so if they were going to change something it would probably be in wing 3 or later
---
I instantly knew you did Toast's drawing too!
---
Yeah, wasn’t sure how an effect would stack and was bummed. Had the “Twinspell, Twinspell, Twinspell Deal 3 damage to all enemy minions” card and then reduced it’s cost by 3 for the rest of the run. Hoped the Twinspell copies would keep the cost reduction but they didn’t.
---
Was more referring to regular big priest. The wall variant doesn't look quite as good against control.
---
Steady on M8. 
---
Not all of us have your 200IQ level of genius with the game. We get our asses kicked a lot by galaxy brains like you. Don’t we deserve a place in HearthStone where we can kick some ass too?  Even if it is some stupid easy AI. 
---
Quit complaining and go beat the Lich King with Silverback Patriarchs and Goldshire Defenders or something that will challenge your considerable skillz; leave us idiots to have our fun.
---
not if you have robes + discount making them all 2 drops.
---
Although in fairness here two turns might’ve won the opponent the game depending on what cards are in his hand
---
Most games I am for free gameplay and only paying for cosmetic upgrades but I feel okay about paying for cards. I know that sounds bad but to me the game is still an alternative to MTG where you also have to buy  adds to win. You can actually play hearthstone F2P and many people do. 
---
I would never pay $10 for a skin. Or pay an extra $60 at the launch of an expansion just to get a skin. It doesn’t feel good.  I would rather have to play to unlock them if I really want them.
---
I’m not him, but for what it’s worth, Bomb hunter and Lackey rogue are high tier and faster than warrior and priest.
---
Neither did op yet you still complained about it
---
It hasnt happened because it isnt a problem. The only time bouncing elyssiana is a problem is when 2 people have decks built to do it. If your win con is "run your opponent out of stuff" then you are prepared for long games, and an hour and a half games is part of that territory. If your not planning to win in fatigue, then your deck should have a win con that beats a bounced elyssiana. If neither of these are true, you are playing a bad deck.
