Heal synergy is a big one - not needing to expend resources to respawn your 4/8 taunt guys is nice.
---
Genn and Baku in standard? Guess odd Paladin is back in the menue. No seriously. Its good that those two got HoFed. Their impact on the game altered many things to this day.
---
Paladin doesn't have a stake in this fight. Their big problem is that as a control deck they'll always have to expend two cards to clear the board, and they've never really got an infinite value engine. For midrange, they've had their moments, but are often outclassed. Then Aggro paladin (of various kinds usally centerd around 1-2 drops, or the hero power) is becoming more and more prevalent but dude Paladin was a meme for a while. As for combo it was considerd Tier 3-4 until very recently.

For the same reason, it makes sandstorm elemental into a one sided board clear.

---
# Twist 
---
**Plague of Death** \- Both players start with an 'Eternal Tomb'.
---
**Eternal Tomb -** A powerful deathrattle minion sits in a permanent token on the board, similar to Dalaran Heist's Violet Prison.
---
The difference here is that a counter starts equal to the mana cost of the minion, and each time a friendly minion dies, the counter goes down by 1. Once it hits zero, the minion in the tomb is summoned, *and a new minion appears in the tomb.* This means both you and the AI will keep getting minion after minion.
---
# Xatma, Plague Lord of Death
---
Xatma's deck is full of powerful deathrattle minions, further augmented by the twist of this wing. We're talking Sylvanas, Hakkar, Sneeds, Tirion, Obsidian Statue, Stalagg &amp; Feugen, etc.
---
**Hero Power 1:** Forboding Fate - 0-Mana "Trigger a friendly minion's deathrattle". As you can imagine, quite problematic when he's got big deathrattles not only in his deck, but popping out of the tomb every couple of turns.
---
**Hero Power 2:** Death's Embrace - Passive "The first minion for each player that dies in a turn gets **Reborn"**. Basically, he has a board full of big deathrattles, and each turn, the first one to die comes back with 1 health. And because this is from the hero power, **Silence** doesn't work. You get your first minion back too, but it's far more likely to be favouring the Plague Lord.
---
**Hero Power 3:** Death's Gaze - 1-Mana "Deal 1 damage to all minions. If any die, add an *Untimely Demise* to your hand."
---
Untimely Demise - 3-Mana Spell: "Deal 3 damage to all enemies." Same as Lich King's "Death and Decay" spell.
---
Where‚Äôs the preparation
---
I'd say not knowing how to take a screenshot but that's not actually unusual on this sub.
---
You haven't conceded?
---
Brann's the last one unlocked apparently
---
oh my god. i just realized you did heroic as well.
---
I've done this. My fingers hurt :( Elise's second deck has Radiant Elemental and Holy Smite, that speeds things a bit. Still needed about 50 cycles to kill him from ~250 HP.
---
I agree. I think you would pull a lot of old wild players out of not retirement if they knew there was a layman's tournament that anyone could enter in. The community is starting to realize hearthstone can be treated like a real card game, and they can host a tourney any time they damn please, and play by whatever rules they want. What's the point of making a community tournament in standard anyway? It's not like there's an absolute NEED to follow the format guidelines set by blizzard. I say let community stuff go wild, instead of being more of the same, and maybe blizzard will start caring about it again
---
Yeesh, that plague lord needs to be tuned down. Really just remove sylvanas from their deck. That's completey absurd.
---
Yea wtf is that treant?
---
Yeah, him getting Sylvanas is bullshit. And he shuffled several copies of her into his deck. I ended up getting 80ish damage off him with blood plagues. If I had one more board clear, I think the bloods would have gotten him.
---
Only Zuul
---
Spitting Camel is quite hilarious with this passive.
---
Omg, it‚Äôs almost as if a boss is supposed to be challenging!
---
Would be nice if they specified whether the "sweeping changes" were limited to the Priest basic/classic set or the entire basic/classic set
---
I know, I know--I should have taken the screenshot a turn ago, but I ended my turn 6, and then only thought it was kind of impressive.

I'd take Brightwing, I don't think your Zephrys is ever going to go off.  You need to be very deep into your deck on average for him to be activated with 4 sets.
---
That's exactly what I'm doing. Trying to milk his hand and board dry so I can kill him
---
Nah.   You've got to get into the game more.   YGO has those wacky wild epic summons and that's about it.
---
It could even be the first expansion of the year, and set the base theme of the story and lore, you could even put hero cards in and two class legendaries in.
---
Shush now, some of us wild memesters have some solid even rogue decks.
---
Now that I think about it, I haven't really read anything in recent memory that stands out. Build-from-scratch deckbuilding is one of the harder skills to acquire in Hearthstone. More often than not, you're taking apart tried and true decks to grab the best packages that synergize with what you're doing. Firebat does this a fair bit in his Deck Doctor series so you can see if that resonates with you.
---
I still consider myself an amateur, but I build decks that at least reach 5 and sometimes reach legend. If that's enough for you, my approach is usually:
---
1) Start with a win condition. Janky combos are easiest. These are the cards that you need to have no matter what.  
---
2) Synergistic packages. For combo decks, you want enough draw to get through your deck. Just the good stuff ideally, you don't want to compromise your deck too much. For aggressive decks you just want to throw in the most powerful stuff.  
---
3) Who are you targeting? I don't expect to win all the matchups, but succeeding with an off-meta deck usually means targeting something common. Control and combo decks should start filling out their deck so that they can answer each threat. Ideally you look at their decklist to find perfect answers instead of general answers. Aggro should look at where the opposing deck can make their swing and either win before then or find things that can make those turns awkward. Ask what are other decks doing against the deck you're targeting and how much of its strategy can you emulate in your own deck?  
---
4) Tech Cards: If by now you still need cards to fill up your deck then you can try tech cards. You don't exactly want to have tech cards though but sometimes a tech card or two can help fill out the gaps.

Sounds a lot like you're a collector (like me) to me. Start on the quest that wants you to have. 1 copy each of all classic cards. It's awesome to think one day you'll have ALL standard cards and all your gold/dust can go towards the newest set without remorse at all. Someone is playing hogger paladin? You don't have to craft hogger, you already have him, that type of thinking. I'm personally not going to craft the meme legendaries but certainly aiming to craft all the classic class cards
---
My Ice Block always fails to protect me on my own turns. Not too long ago it used to work :( \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^/s btw.
---
Haha funny you mention this, this is actually my plan to let my rank deteriorate past the "can't lose rank" checkpoints back to 20. My hope was that at the bottom of the ladder there were more newbs, noobs, and people just generally unwilling or unable to put together a netdeck (or ignorant of their existance altogether, as I once was).
---
That is an excellent plan.
---
Under druid just write wild growth and nourish. They already gutted the mana ramp class identity, but that was the core. Rogue you should write prep. Mage they killed mana wyrm and that was a staple
---
This is the worst ladder advice btw. You always want to craft decks and not cards but you said you don't play ladder so this is a direction to move towards. In about a year, you'll able to go fully F2P assuming they don't rotate out the entire classic set. You will however have a really shitty collection since most classic cards are underpowered vs expansions.
---
Anyone who has played any amount of ladder knows that priest is an issue now, not in 7 months.
---
Lol AGAIN, I levelled them from LEVEL 1, all the way to level 110. By killing things. And doing quests. And mounts and mountains of mob's corpses.
---
Theft is a priest theme and isn't going anywhere. You may not like it, and it may not be competitive at legendary, but new and low ranked players love how the same deck can give them wildly different cards and games every time.
---
They have said many, many, many, many, *many, many,* ***MANY*** times they **are not** going to add a good forever-playable aoe to the priest classic/basic set. They like having new ones every year so the control priest decks are always changing. What's that? You're saying Flamestrike, Blizzard, and Frost Nova/Doomsayer are all classic/basic? I'd say that's a good point but it's also not my call what they do with the game. It's theirs. And they have weighed in on this more than enough times. Please stop asking.
---
And priest is not getting any more high aggression cards. Healing may not be as good as armor *for the hero* but it is absurdly powerful for a mid range deck with higher health minions and if priest has good minions and/or aggressive options combined with the ability to heal their minions, especially if the core cards are basic/classic, that would not only be too strong but forever pigeonhole the class until it inevitably got nerfed.
---
Right now priest is broken. It's way too high roll and you can just auto lose against it. Even the pro players that love priest are complaining. You write about people not thinking about playing it, but give no examples of how to combat the crazy openers that deck has.
---
I beat this in my first run, as Elise. Treasures included spells summon minions, even cost cards refresh hero power to zero, zero cost zephrys treasure in opening hand, and with the Double Damage to all heroes modifier.
---
So every game I drop zephrys, choose sorc apprentice, and randomly pull a sylvanas, rag, tyrantus, etc. Then steam roll from there. Final boss wasn't even that hard, killed him with 25 life left and a full board. Easy peasy.
---
Oh wow I didn't know that, makes sense why she's so bad now if she gets buffed at the end
---
Just need to get the bombastick deck from Bob.
---
Killed the plaguelord at full health with it. Took like.. 15 turns maybe.
---
That deck is absurd.
---
Not always, they always look for the best option but maybe she wanted big boi and got confused with card
---
Is it because Barnes nerf? I'm only R15 (wild) and i never fight against one. I assume they are R5 or higher.
---
Quest Hunter is great. Managed the legend climb with it recently and it is indeed strong against control warrior.
---
It was PvE/.

---

---
Too many people quit the game and come back and drop 50$ on packs.  There's no incentive to come back if all the cards are gone every time.
---
If it was a 1 mana 1/2 weapon that you always drew at the start of the game, after mulligan, for sure it would very strong. The consistency alone would make it a great card, you could even opt out of running 1 drops because you would always have a turn 1 play available. It would also thin your deck out which is great for any deck that doesnt plan on fighting into fatigue as it improves all your future draws, you would essentially be playing with a 29 card deck, assuming this is a legendary card.
---
What evidence do you have that makes you say the sweeping changes have to apply to all classes?
---
That other stuff that has to go with it could be other priest stuff.
---
Fight fire with fire

well i don't have a problem with jojo style... i love jojo's style. if it could fit the idea - i would used it. And not form that matters - context matters, if you say that Miyazaki don't respect characters, especially females - you didn't watch Miyazaki movies. Or didn't understand them. And with same result we can say that Warcraft don't respect their characters - we still have strong, but beautiful and fit females in the game.

Moonfire only exists, because Malygos exists.

It's mostly because secret mages
---
I know the stats list it as "combo priest" but if the current priest isn't an agressive priest then I don't even know what is anymore.
---
This is hands down the most fun combo I have ever seen honestly. I saw Firebat pull Da Undatakah off with the lifesteal, tunnelblaster, abomination instead of the vanguard and prelate, which pushes face damage, clears the board and lifesteals at the same time. Might wanna try that too, lots of fun haha.
---
Bad bot
---
It'll never happen. The priest hero power is just too little/too expensive. I think the only time we really saw it properly impact priest early play was with cards like Zombie Chow and Death Lord, which were just insane.
---
That isn't actually what he said.
---
I hope to god they don‚Äôt HoF Leeroy or Malygos.
---
If you want to rank high, listen to the people who are telling you to focus on one class / one deck.  That‚Äôs how to do well.  You need to get so good with the deck that you know what strategy to employ based upon what your opponent is doing very early in the game.  
---
Speaking for myself, I play all the classes.  I like to experience different win conditions / unusual win conditions.  That is what makes the game fun for me.  The downside is that I will never reach legend rank playing this way.  You have to decide what makes the game fun for you and play that way.
---
I would start on either the Dalaran Heist (DH) or Tombs of Terror (ToT). However I would suggest you do ToT first if you plan on doing single-player content rather than multiplayer. 
---
Also, the first wing of both DH and ToT is free and gives you 3 free packs after completing the wing. 
---
The rest of the Dungeon Runs don‚Äôt provide any rewards other than a Card Back so I would do them later. However they are completely free.

Deathrattle Rogue with Anka has ‚Äòsynergy with Octo‚Äô. But it‚Äôs a really bad deck from what I have heard.

Guys, guys, Priest is all about healing, so it's identity is around minions with high health. Because of that I think we should design a high health minion that also gives other minions high health. I haven't thought about the details yet.

---
Every now and then this suggestion pops up and people ask for this, but meanwhile in other threads people complain about the cost of the game. A rotating core set would mean you need to collect more cards each rotation than the system we have now.
---
Plus players that take a break and come back to the game will be at an even bigger disadvantage than now because there's the potential for them to hold even less playable cards in their collection now. With the current system anyone taking a break from the game can come back and only has to worry about expansion cards, with your suggestion they would also have to worry about the current core set as well.
---
This makes the game more expensive overall and worse for returning players.
---
Nah it needs more ice on the beard
---
My experience was similar but to an ever bigger extent. I did not get ANY damage in until like 15 turns into the game. That's how long it took me to stabilize. Luckily after I stabilized I went through Phase 2 and 3 relatively easily. I won it because I got a lucky Jade Idol from Raven Idol, otherwise I would run out of resources and die to fatigue. In the end I was summoning 12/12's from a single Idol and the entire fight took me like an hour.

I would say that Van Cleef is the best Class Legendary.

Not to long ago I would have had Tirion as the best legendary by a good margin, but he just doesn't feel great to me right now. 
---
Antonidas is another good choice.

Bloodmage Thalnos doesn't have the wow factor, but is a very god card (though not used right now).

Alexstraza and Malygos will both always have their place, but shouldn't be your first choice.

For naxx bosses i used kingsbane before nerfs. They cant handle me dealing and healing 6+ every turn since turn 3 without a board. Now idk sniplock seems best still
---
If arena no. If anything else sure

I don't think it shows up if you haven't had the expansion available previously.
---
If you‚Äôre going to craft a legendary I would recommend crafting Ziliax. Yes he will eventually rotate but he‚Äôs just an amazing card for any non-aggro deck.

You don't need to remove a card from your deck in order to play the Rogue hero power. You also always have the Rogue hero power on T2 when it is most beneficial.

---
We don't do that here

Also noticed Loti didn't activate the odd-cost passive that discounts cards in your hand (even at 3 mana).
---
I'm using iPad air and it does the same suggest u sell it and get an android, they don't rly crash games
---
TFW you opened Golden Leeroy, Tirion and Alexstrazsa on your new account. FeelsGreatMan.
---
True, though you also can't talk about this without mentioning the tempo disadvantage. While you're healing your minions, your opponent dumps bigger (or just more) creatures on their side. And we all know how generally Priest minions (or netural ones) are - it's hard to make them stick or survive a turn without something like Power Word: Shield.
---
I for one would argue that, at least if Blizzard wants Priest to remain (or actually become, because it really hasn't been and isn't) this class that outvalues enemies by healing its minions, future class minions could really use a +1 or +2 health boost on top of whatever they initially intended for them to have. Or Priest's Hero Power could still heal 2 when used at the face but perhaps 3 when on a minion etc., because you rarely ever just play a minion, it lives and then just heal it and be "fine" - that, if ever, usually happens at turns 5+, at which point you've often failed to contest the early game, due to Priest not having decent 1-3 cost minions.
---
Any pick can do it, some will be little more consistent/easier than others. I did 100% all the heroic past content (for example in case of rumble run it was 27 possible combinations) excluding ros where 100% all checkmarks is bit to much of the same for me. Imho the balance is not bad this time. Bosses 1-6 usually little to easy, 7th depends, 8th little to hard.

Its pretty shitty advice to dust usable standard cards to be honest. Even bad ones if you plan to buy more packs of that expansion. I mean you do you but its so inefficient to create a collection this way as you always lose almost all your card value to the 5 to 1 disenchant value.
---
Secret mage is a much bigger problem than snip-lock from my experience. At rank 3+ my hsreplay stats show me that nearly 9/10 of my opponents are secret mage. The 1/10 is even shaman and everybody else. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also brann + dirty rat can straight up counter snip-lock when used properly. It takes some patience, but hand-tracking goes a long way.
---
Wow that Caravaggio guy was extraordinarily unlikable and ignorant, I'm surprised that someone as snarky as iksar managed to put up with him. Additionally I completely disagree that backlash against otk combo decks come primarily from uninformed newer players, if you're at rank 20 and only face like one Raza priest (because the deck was very costly at the time) and they kill you and you're left kinda dazed and confused, you might be a little miffed and move on, on the contrary, players who face the deck constantly with a variety of decks and know every single intricacy and interaction with the deck and still lose a large portion of the time (because often the backlash against these decks are when the decks are very good), that's when you start to see a fervent and dedicated hatred to an archetype. That's when you have streamers going on large rants that influence who is watching about how poorly designed they believe the current balance to be.

As a priest player, I hope Priest goes towards a more Tempo/Control game plan
---
And hopefully a decent Class Board Clear is implemented. So excited.
---
?
---
FTP here, many many times legend.
---
Your heart is in a good place but sadly there‚Äôs way too much toxicity in this game.
---
none
---
Reeee 
---
DIvine Shit
---
This brawl is a rng clown fiesta. You either highroll like crazy or get absolutely steamrolled with little chance of recovery. Not the most fun brawl I've played.
---
&gt; In RoS post nerf, NSC was there, Extra Arms was there, and yet there was no combo Priest around. Now it manages to have a synergistic deck full of good supporting cards and everyone loses their mind.
---
&gt; 
---
A bit off topic but its funny how combo priest has about 17-18 basic/classic cards, 9 uldum cards, and 2-3 other card set cards.
---
Divin3 Spirit is better to remove as it is the way it works.
---
Inner fire needs an enabler to be broken, and DS is that enabler.
---

---
Came here to recommend this. It's my absolute go to for teaching someone all the basic concepts even being so many years old.
---
What?
---
That's horrible.
---
I still think they got the priest and paladin quests swapped. Reborn and summoning copies of things? Totally priest. Buffing minions? Totally paladin.
---
&gt;As a reward for becoming the eternal Champion of Hearthstone, YUGI receives a bag containing 75 Gold, 25 Arcane Dust, and a Golden Argent Squire card.&gt;
---
I love this line
---
and also I know there is a sub  dedicated to this,but I don't remember how it's called so if any of you does know could you tell me thanks:)
---
Maybe Priest can go for a more tempo/Control game style instead or Ressurect (ugh) and DS. (Bigger ugh)
---
Thalnos hasn't been a good card for a long time.
---
Rogue has some of the best tools in the game for dealing with priest shenanigans. It‚Äôs probably the one thing keeping the class relevant right now.
---
Even then a 40% winrate for a ‚Äúbad‚Äù matchup is pretty nuts. It just feels like that deck has no true counter right now.
---
Hall of fame didnt changed a single card, nor affected any card having more than 0,1% of playrate at the time. It changed nothing.
---
It was also not a "second round of nerfs". Its not even comparable, their purpose was also completely the opposite or the normal rounds of nerfs.
---
No. He‚Äôs g*y
---
It's disappointing to me how terrible mill/fatigue has been in the past couple solo adventures.
---
Especially on these plague lords; I love building up the fatigue damage on them but their decks are SO POWERFUL even on normal and they just refill their decks when they hit each hp threshhold.
---
I like playing hyper-control/mill but it's just completely unviable.
---
He fits into very aggressive decks that could use the refill. So he sometimes gets run in aggro warrior or highlander variants of aggro warrior.
---
I'm playing both sides, so that I always come out on top!
---
ah okay, thats sad to hear about, glad i did it back then.  
---
i guess you also don't get c'thun for free anymore + 2 of them buff cards(each twice) which kinda makes sense cause its not standard anymore but would still be a nice "starting" dust for new players.
---
If you can, don't kill the reborn taunts and let him fill his res pool with weaker reborn minions like Murmy and Micro-mummy. The -1 attack treasure is amazing against him since it makes it much easier to trade against all his 1 and 2 attack minions.
---
Wow congratulations!! You made it!
---
I know shit about WOW lore, never played it, everything comes from a outside prospective, my main influence comes from some tumblr memes, so all I know is that the Wrynn dynasty are all anti union tyrants, the alliance put a 19 years old and Werewolf Donald Trump ("We will build a wall, and the odd cost cards are gona pay for it!") in power rather than a elected ruler or two literal prophet king/queen, and that Blizzard hates women in position of power since they'll either always be killed by a thrown rock or just go CRAZY for a reason or another, but honestly, between the Hot Revenant Lady and the Not Hot revenant lady? I go for Hot Revenant Lady.
---
Oh, yeah, also that cheating at those weird orc duel things with magic is a time honored tradition among Horde leaders apparently.
---
Introduction of external resources has become a vital section of the learning curve of online multiplayer games, ignoring this as a new player is actively shooting yourself in the foot. God forbid I try and share my experience of obtaining this resources. What the fuck was I thinking?
---
If you've "experienced" some of the brawls, especially the ones like the original easter brawl, you know that the devs won't/can't spend too much time and creativity making these, as they're most likely very busy developing the next set, fixing bugs, etc.   
---
I absolutely would love something intricate and fun, but I figured that'd just be the most realistic outcome.
---
Neat! Congratd
---
Congrats ! Any OP picks/combos ? :)
---
It makes total sense. Reincarnate summons a COPY of the minion, whereas Reborn brings the same minion back to life with 1 health. Reincarnate stacks because you can summon multiple copies of a minion, but Reborn doesn't since you are bringing back the same minion to life.
---
Sadly although I would miss our wholesome interaction this 48 hour cooldown period helps way more than it hurts given how toxic hearthstone's player base is.
---
Yea mate, I feel ya.
---
I played a lifesteal deck the first time around.
---
I would think the clickbait youtube thumbnails would be a good enough indication that you're not there to learn.
---
Ah, thanks.
---
The boss played stolen Tekkal and turned himself into 1HP 200+ armor. I came back second time for a Reno ping :)
---
Turn 1: Coin dagger
---
Turn 2: Deadly Poisons + Dread Corsairs
---
I did like 10 damage the first time and then the second time he just kept playing anubarak every single turn so it was pretty easy.
---
The difficulty though with how Blizzard's been handling it is that the game itself is unbalanced. 
---
So when you nerf classes, you need to also print cards to support that class. But the powerlevel is so strong nowadays that you need to print blatantly broken cards like Conjurer's calling to see play. 
---
All the basic/classic nerfs do is make classes inconsistent or one note.
---
It's not like adding on an additional deathrattle since a minion can have multiple deathrattles. Like how the other person said, perhaps it's treated like divine shield, a one instance effect that cannot stack like stealth/divine shield
---
Ohhh good point
---
I just won two games in a row, one on turn 5, one on turn 6.  None of my zombeasts had lifesteal.  One of my zombeasts had rush (killed a 1/1 then died to a spell immediately).
---
Some of my opponents did pick lifesteal rush (they lost).
---
So uhh...no, I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúskill‚Äù in this brawl is the number of lifesteal beasts you pick,
---
Just saying, Evolve Shaman ft. Thrall DK is a thing in Wild now
---
How does that work?
---
Nah, Rogues core set wasnt even better when Prep reduced spells by 3 mana, it sure as hell isnt now. Rogue uses 5 cards out of its core set. And even those fall in and out of favour, and outside of backstab and eviscerate, theyre not even particularly amazing (though Edwin does highroll sometimes). Warrior uses 12. Including several cards that are just the best of their kind. Cards that go into so many different archetypes.
---
Legend Even Loti Druid here I come!
---
Totally as expected all the deathrattle crap. 3x Sylvanas on board and stealing my good stuff back to back every time. No fun at all this boss. 
---
However I did learn something. Though the dumb rng obviously kept giving the boss Obsidian Statue's (FFS) the game remembered the lowest HP the boss has been. Even though I conceded while the boss was at 298 hp due to healing.
---
Spell damage is applied when you cast the spell, then the Plague Lord takes the same amount of damage at the start of their fight.
---
I win in my fist try, it took me a long match, I managed to burn all the corrupted blood on my deck always keeping my hand full, with the hero power of paladin that give u a minion with battlecry, but it was one of more excited games on my life. I spend like 30 minutes on this boss or more.
---
Saying it makes a card into a one-sided board clear is stupid because that's already what it is.
---
That's a pretty good turn 2 play, I think.
---
Ohh, I get it. I thought the spell did a flat 10 damage to the Plague Lord, but it adds damage each time you play it. Interesting!
---
Also the deckbuilding aspect! Almost no YouTube videos show a player tweaking their deck between games. In a livestream you can see directly what sorts of situations got the player to swap out their one Doomsayer for an MC Tech for example.
---
Originally used barkskin to give the Jr. Navigator more health to keep comboing moonfires but this works better
---
Jesus Christ.
---
You quoted it. If you ADD. Solitaire isn't adding a random element. Solitaire was created with this random element from the start.
---
When I wrote add, I literally meant add, as in, it is not there from the beginning, and you add it.
---
This is why I gave you the Shooter example to make it simpler, I stated that if for Hard mode, they add a random chance for the shot to fail, a new added element.
---
Not really. Every card game comes with a random element, the draw order. That is not an added element, that is from the start. I mean added elements.
---
You asked me to tell you what I meant with Artificially hard, all the examples and explaining I did were to explain that to you, you kept asking as if you weren't understanding it, now you say you agree, good.
---
Anyway, yes, there are a lot of bad designs in a lot of games, doesn't mean aren't popular. Bad design doesn't mean the game will be popular, it's like anything, you can have something that isn't good, that is still popular, specially in art. Justin Bieber doesn't make good music, that doesn't prevent him from being popular for example.
---
And Bad Design is for me defined as a design which focuses the challenge on other aspects other than the player's actions. Specially important for  Single Player because there is no positive to this.
---
As an example, in Hearthstone Multiplayer, there is a positive. One of the players, even if faced with a situation they cannot overcome, they still learn. They can use a different strategy at the very least, since that is completely under their control. And obviously, the loss is necessary because one will lose and the other win.
---
In the Single Player however, nothing is positive about a loss completely out of your control, it is purely a waste of time.
---
You start with a small control over what you can begin with, as you cannot decide the starting deck, only one of the presets. You are presented a sequence of random options to take, all of which are completely out of your control, you only pick out of those pre-selected bundles, what to take.
---
You reach the final boss with a best of what you were offered, where you don't decide what you get offered, and try to make the best of it, regardless of whether it is possible or not to complete it that way. No fail safe in case the game decided to offer you crap. And once you fail even if you did all you could with what the game randomly offered, you have to restart from scratch.
---
That, for me, is bad design. Given the amount of random variables that can screw up the runs, the lack of fail-safes is a problem.
---
What took it over the top for me in this case in question, was being faced with absurd random elements on top of the rest, the boss having the option to trigger free Deathrattles, as well as having and playing Sylvanas and the Thaddius guys by my turn 6. I'm used to this happening in Heroic, it is made to be unfair, but this is extremely unfair for Normal mode.
---
I do a lot of fun projects that require scanning card text so I can get behind this change. The amount of ad-hoc adds I need to do because there aren't consistent naming conventions or number expressions (sometimes the first number used is expressed as an integer, sometimes its spelled out, etc etc) add so many man hours onto projects.
---
Sometimes one has to learn how to learn. Media besides the game itself is easily the best way to do this.
---
With four Crocs you and a friend can go to the beach!
---
Dude didn‚Äôt equip a single weapon in my run last night. I almost felt bad
---
Doesn't really change anything. The match was always "who can play the charge/rush lifesteals and aoe poisons".
---
It blows my mind that a game designer came up with divine spirit and still works in game design.
---
Meme? It‚Äôs not really a meme if he‚Äôs still doing it but just with TFT. Just looking at the titles of his last ten vids, ‚ÄúREACHING THE #1 RANK‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHIS IS ILLEGAL!‚Äù, ‚Äú100% winrate‚Äù, ‚ÄúNEED A NERF!‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHE WORST TFT PLAYERS!?‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHIS IS BROKEN!‚Äù
---
More like ‚ÄúMISTAKE!‚Äù
---
That doesn't match my experience.   Sure, highlight videos like Trolden are for entertainment value.   However, streamers (like your title suggested) more often than not upload Youtube content where they explain their strategies and decisions.   To name a handful: Trump, Kripp, Brian Kibler, Thijs, and Strifecro.   
---
It's actually hard to think of an individual streamer that has a Youtube channel only containing fluff.   The only one that comes to mind is Disguised Toast before he quit the game.  Even then, his content is still useful for the players who want to pilot meme decks.
---
I can name multiple other times when priest has been good without the combo.
---
I'm also getting "update installed" notification every 5-6 hours
---
Pretty sure bounce effects undo silence so this should not happen, probably a bug.
---
that's odd
---
Oh god. Eariler I pulled a Right Hand Man and that card that lets me start with a spell in my hand. Toss in Khadgar's Gem and I had an OTK that took forever.
---
Used to really enjoy Trump for this, he'd be twiddling with it at the start of and in videos
---
Good point. It should show fake cards if the opponent has less than 3 cards.
---
There's also a deck that uses a lot of the exclusive cards from Medivh's deck in One Night in Kharazan. Additionally, it had Consult Brann (1 mana, draw 3 cards) and a card I don't remember the name of (gain 4 armor, draw 2 cards) and Sorcerer's Apprentice.
---
You got beat.  There was some sad post on r/kidsarefuckingstupid and this fellow said "that's sad.  Alexa play despacito"
---
I would like the other option: if I have a golden card (or two) I want to disenchant the regular versions since I don't need them. If there's an option for this, I must have missed it.
---
Yeah, I got a Rin so managed to delete the second phase deck and then put in one corrupted blood. By the time he got himself down to the last phase, there were too many bloods in the deck to survive. Easy win.
---
I have the deck and have run a handful of matches.
---
And boy let me tell you it is hard as hell to pilot. I did not enjoy playing the deck whatsoever and would not recommend it. It sort of plays out like quest shaman where you build little boards wave by wave but it feels weaker and has less reach.
---
It's harder when the power level of decks creeps up. It tends to hit points where it gets far harder to make weird decks.
---
For example, if a class has a good quest, you either have to come up with a deck good enough to compete with that quest or build your deck around that quest. That can be pretty limiting on what kind of decks you do.
---
Yep.  Doing that with any of the treasure minions can become powerful quite quickly.
---
I have to agree with this, they pushed what seemed to be a fun archetype (thief), it lost quite a few good cards (still a few decent steal cards around) but it seems like it's only half way there from a standard perspective, they then remove shadow priest and now only leave one real archetype of priest open in standard play, which is the most linear, boring pos deck to play.  
---
I have a golden priest with 1500+ ranked wins, but I literally dusted all my priest cards this expansion because they will not be seeing playing for quite some time.
---
He becomes cake with specific setups.
---
Just finished a heroic run where i had crook and cane + alchemist stone + the panda.
---
I discovered 1 mana journey below to always be in my starting hand so I was able to turn 1 summon mexxena to hold the board for 2-3 turns until I was able to fill my board with my big ass minions. Eventually I found 2 sorcerer's apprentices + tony and the rest is history doing 12 damage fireballs to his face forever.
---
I like jojo and all, but no.
---
Between 1 arms and 2 AoP, what made you decide with Arms post nerf AND have beaming sidekick AKA the arms replacement.
---
Unfortunately for everyone in this sub, this is the reason you do not work for blizzard
---
I mean, it doesnt matter if he doesn't like it... he still did it and it's fair criticism.
---
Yeah, watching Trump and Kripp are far more fun than actually playing the game.
---
If you get the treasure that makes your minions perma stealthed it's super OP. Only problem is some of the bosses still take forever to clear their unending board of kill a minion deathrattles/sylvs/reborn minions so a lot of the fights get stuck with 60 blood of hakkars in their deck.
---
But It sucks having to do that every turn.
---
I had plenty of time to add a few in.
---
I beat him with one deck because  of the rush minion that does 5 dmg after it dies and goes back into your deck. I duplicated it with the bosses 2nd passive about 15 times and out controlled the boss.
---
It took an hour and a half.
---
This boss is a great example of artificial difficulty.
---
Give the boss a shit ton of board clears and have the player lose repeatedly.
---
This isn't as convenient as text, but here's a picture of the decklist:
---
[Wombo Combo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFQqVVBXUAAijvy.png:large)
---
Thats pretty new
---
I got lucky got one of bobs decks otk in turn 4 cycling the mana refresh into free spells into spell power hand of rag.
---
If the AI was actually smart it would be really unfair. Too bad most of his cards suck ass if you have early game and he plays weapons like the combo blade without combo
---
He is definitely the toughest plague lord so far. At least on heroic.
---
