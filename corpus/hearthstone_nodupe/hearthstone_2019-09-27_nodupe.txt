This is an actually really great update, that seems to look positive for the future of Hearthstone!

---
---
It's called a desync. If you quit and reconnect, you will resync.
---

---
You and your opponent are connected to each other, but separately connected to the server, and the clients do not agree with what the server says. Reconnecting corrects the client state.
---
&gt;I don't see too many major changes to Druid personally because the only thing that might change is the support cards or choose ones but overall.
---
Make it harder to complete? With coin/innervate, it can complete on t4/5 quite often.
---
Wait how did you get him? I thought he wasn't in standard
---
She's flat as a board.
---
Just started and been doing the free Solo adventures,monster hunt, that are pretty fun as you get to play with all the unique cards.
---
Is there any reward for playing them though that helps gets more cards/gold or is it purely for enjoyment?
---
[deleted]
---
Hell yeah, 1568 on Druid, 1232 and 1185 on Shaman (although I haven't played any recently since I don't have either quest and Hunter is kinda dead). Time to grind some Zoo I guess, 904 for Warlock
---
Best quests give pack or 80g to two people. I only rolls those if I log in, realize I don't feel like playing or farming gold, so you're right in that it's not a problem for the average use case.
---
you can have battle cry on every minion but not every minion will get you another class card
---
As someone who draws for a living, I'm pretty sure it's because her old art looked dumb (giant heaving tits and all) and they wanted to redesign her to something that looked less like fetish art.
---
Honestly, the first change I can understand, fine. This honestly does look like even more of one, and honestly I dislike it just because of how inconsistent it is, the middle one looks fine, and not especially unrealistic or provocative or anything.
---
Any other classes available?
---
Looks gold to me.
---
How does that work? They say they are giving everyone free copies of the cards. How do you know they are copying my cards. Or how does it make sense I'm being given another copy? Surely I won't have 2 Nzoths. I know likely we will be able to use our own cards, sometimes golden in standard. But that isnt what they exactly said.
---
Wow I can't believe Chandra is coming into Hearthstone!
---
Limited time only then they will be removed from your account. Womp womp
---
Are you okay?
---
Maybe the new copies will have a "special event" icon on them, like the Hall of Fame icon
---
impact of cards (IMO)  
---
  
---
S+: thaurissan, nzoth  
---
S: rag, sylv, call of the wild, mysterious challenger  
---
A: swash, lightbomb, bloodhoof brave, flamewaker, avenge  
---
B: varian wrynn, babbling book, evolve, imp gang boss  
---
C: thing from below, shaku, kun, the curator  
---
D: vuljin, lock and load  
---
E: astral communion, renounce darkness
---
Now that Im used to the new portrait, the old portrait looks especially ridiculous

Ah man, it's ranked wins? Rip. I should have done more grinding when tempo mage was actually good
---
So I'm assuming I'll also get to keep my actual, original copies of Ragnaros and N'zoth. (Wouldn't want to waste the extra dust.)
---
EDIT: If I have golden Ragnaros or N'zoth will I get a golden event copy too?

Yeah, we need a new 'Oh shit, I'm gonna lose' signal.

*Things ill never achieve * for 500, Alex
---
They could've just nerfed Nourish's Ramp version to give empty Mana Crystals instead of full ones. The draw version was never OP.
---
This is awesome. I really hope they add these portraits for all the characters not just the base class portraits. I use Alleria on my hunter and would like to have a fancy portrait for her rather than Rexxar.
---
Took me more time than i would expect from myself to notice me
---
Can't wait to see the Thrall portrait
---
i think kazakus is a mage/priest/warlock isn't it?
---
I'm terrified of what Priest will become. Slap a few of these boys with N'Zoth and Convincing Infiltrator and we are in for a bad time. I am curious if Deathrattle Rogue will be a thing or not though.
---
I TASTE THE ESSENCE OF YOUR SOUL
---
Wait what, arena wins don't count retroactively?
---
As a ftp player with golden nzoth and rag, this really hurts.
---
You don't need death's bite to make bloodhoof good lol, it's already a super solid card.  
---
[here's the list that will probably pop up](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377182938896269312/626936959343788032/5c31eedfdb08a1ffdadd5b517c217ddb.png)
---
I don't see any Thrall tho?
---
Kazakus is only for Mage, Priest, and Warlock buddy
---
I would disagree on Azure Drake. The reason they took it out in the first place was because it‚Äôs just a standard really good card, and was an auto include in most decks. It was one of those cards that reduced deck diversity because of how ubiquitous it was. Still, it‚Äôs hard to say how well that would hold up in today‚Äôs game.
---
Same waist. Bigger yams.
---
Some incentive to come back after 2 years away perhaps... is mage any good atm?
---
Nah, the real 1000 win portrait is another massive nerf, this time they literally shrink.
---
Anyone notice the nerf to quest gold? You -always-get a quest worth less when you re-roll them now
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, my highest is warlock at 308 wins with my second highest being priest at 256 wins
---
Oh shit did you expand them lmao, I guess that skewed my...er...vision but yea that‚Äôs not the original art was what I was getting at
---
"Fantasy" tiddies at that
---
Eh, I find the game has improved leaps and bounds since what-his-face left.
---
Kazakus is only a Priest Mage and Warlock card.
---
It's simple!
---
1. Have Darklight Torch 
---
2. Cast Stolen Titan Secrets, to gain Jolene's Hero Power
---
3. Let Jolene steal Velen's Chosen from you
---
4. Steal Velen's Chosen back from her, so it costs 0, and play it
---
5. go to step 4.
---
"These cards will be considered "event" cards, which essentially means that they're temporary copies and not permanent additions to your collection."
---
I have like 1800 wins with mage and no more than 300 in any of the classes. Shit
---
1,500 wins = Pectus excavatum
---
Should‚Äôve spread them wins out more haha
---
ou fuck they do? i wasn‚Äôt planning on going back to play standard when i don‚Äôt have the new cards but i don‚Äôt mind just grinding it out in arena
---
The 1% on average spends a lot of money and time on the game. It rewards those players who play a lot  and have been playing the game the longest.
---
Her Proudmores will never get unnerfed...
---
How about Hadronox, to add few more?
---
Or at least cost him mana to cast, christ.
---
try (new) quest mage in wild. the amount of value is insane with the dune sculpter and the cyclone  
---
only problem with the deck is not enough sustain/health recovery
---
Sensitive Chinese people haHAA
---
As someone who hates wild (almost irrationally), I‚Äôm so hyped to be able to play N‚ÄôZoth decks again
---
I didn't i got killed then gained the armor 
---
I had the shuffle a bomb into your deck everytime a minnion dies then i cast the treasure that casts all spells in deck 
---
I got armor because i had one last board clear and minions on board
---
Waist not small enough
---
Everyone is already aware of Chinas influence on Hearthstone. From a business perspective you want your game to appeal to as wide of an audience as possible. It doesn't make sense losing the Chinese market over a few art changes here and there. I'm not saying I like it or you have to like it, but ultimately it has no effect on the gameplay and the vast majority of the art or noticable details.
---
\*\* sigh \*\* 
---
You are probably right
---
No, you‚Äôre just kinda lucky, also your first 10 packs are guaranteed a legendary and then you should get another at least every 20 from a set
---
While you may not have, a lot of people can‚Äôt be bothered to read before assuming stuff.
---
I like that. I‚Äôve never had anyone give that response lol
---
I've been saving her since rise of shadows, for this very moment
---
next century remind me
---
Overall the average is 1:20 after the first, but the pity timer is every 40 packs.
---
So what should I be crafting next?  Still new to all of this
---
My highest wins with a single class is around 350 with mage I think...I'm never gonna get these. Hopefully they have some achievements for us casual plebs.
---
you will get downvoted to death that's how reddit kids use their site

---
I think this is 100% accurate as they all push archetypes that Blizzard have been pushing during the year of the dragon. 
---
Mage has had a theme of generating lots of spells (mana cyclone, minion mana cyclone, quest, the frog that's a worse flamewaker), Rogue obviously has been pushing thief mechanics hard, Secret Paladin with Rhyssa, Shaman with cards like Mutate, Mogu and Desert Hare, Warrior with Taunt synergy from Uldum and Big synergy from RoS etc etc.

Damn dreadscale and the slug?

TBH this is kind of meh. The portraits are cool, but I also want to use my Arthas. Nemsy, Mrgl, Maive and Lunara skins!
---
They couldn't have made something brand new for a 100 wins? Like new hero power animation, alternate card art, or some kind of board effect?
---
But is it really goes into this deck? 50 is only relevant vs control. And you drop Emperor (while having 2 Bankers and 2 Wrath specifically) to be able to double Wrath in one turn, instead of going 25 in one turn and 25 in the subsequent instead.

Blizzur fucking conforming to the Chinese again, making everyone else suffer downgraded and subpar art in the process.

Got the treasure cards deck (D)...the synergy was dreadful tbh, am surprised i even made it to the end. Was hoping for the C deck (legendaries).
---
Yes.
---
Please remove the godawful undershirt.
---
The neutral cards are what makes me think this isn't real. Sykvanas, Rag, N'zoth, and Thaurissan in standard at the same time is gonna be so busted. Hunter would also be broken with Call of the Wild.
---
The money pile must be getting low for them to offer 23 cards for free, even for a limited time.
---
Makes no sense and shouldn't have worked, yeah.

Also, the tip OP promised is missing, because have luck drawing C'Thun is not a tip to be relied on.

Loatheb better come back!!

I think you stopped reading before the end. The PLAYER‚ÄôS health didn‚Äôt reset after the draw. So he loaded into the rematch at -17 health and lost on the first turn. 
---
That is most definitely a bug and NOT how draws work everywhere.
---
Boy I wish
---
Where is loatheb!?
---
*laughs in that one gnome boss that smorcs*
---
I hope they are wrong because I don't see loatheb. probably the #1 most asked for card to be put into the classic set
---
Gul‚Äôdan is actually [grey.](https://youtu.be/I3QJ8Pgjj3c)
---
Also why include cards people don't like (flamewaker and mysterious challenger) and don't include Loatheb (which people have wanted to be moved to the classic set for years)
---
Lol people complaining that the boss is BS lol
---
I mean I was super sick of the conjurers calling bullshit so I get why but I just think it's silly that even as a meme card the deck is more fun without it. All the fun things happen because of mana cyclone and dune sculptor.
---
Lightbomb and Vol'Jin, that's awesome!

I can't see this card anymore without thinking of farting in a car after that post.

It was a great move....for reasons you and me cant understand of course. This AI is performing Next Level Thinking.
---
Just divide the number of arena wins equally.
---
Once

---
n'zoth is going to be disgusting in the priest khartut deck
---
Thanks. Apparently it was an ISP issue seeing as other people with a similar service provider had the same problem
---
I really hope Blizzard let us use the old portrait since I find new Jaina‚Äôs ugly af
---
Yeah indeed, it was a combined charity promotion from Apple and WWF back in 2016.
---
Fairly strong yes, the 2 most popular lists manage 52.4% and 53.7% winrates from rank 5 to legend. However theres a clear upward trend as you climb in rank with a 52.3% and 55.7% in legend and 53.8% and 56.8% in top 1000.
---
Youthful bremaster of course duh
---
Is it? I can‚Äôt think of a deck outside of odd rogue and maybe tempo Reno mage that run Loatheb right now. It was everywhere in the RoS meta because of cyclone quest mage and big priest being super popular, but those decks don‚Äôt see much play right now.
---
I don't like it but I understand it.
---
What is that card that is super buffed ? How did it get so buffed ?
---
Does Blizzard still flag certain cards as undraftable?  I remember how certain specific high-end and low-end cards were set to never appear in Arena.
---
Desert Obelisk seems like it would be a very easy call to flag for undraftable in Arena.
---
I assume they‚Äôre a splinter of the black rock clan that formed after they moved to Azeroth? I have no idea just speculation and I‚Äôm too lazy to wowwiki it

---
Done
---
Can‚Äôt agree more
---
If you can pull off a combo to flood your board with them, keep in mind that they **each** do 5 damage.
---
It's a very silly type of combo deck.
---
eh, sometimes you high roll.
---
Assuming he is a quest shaman, not playing anything turn 2, 3 and 4 is very very weird. Most cards in all those lists are between those mana costs, so its impossible to draw THAT bad.
---
Probably he was playing his own homebrew, hope he learns to put some low cost cards in his decks.
---
Same, it would be interesting to peel away the talking points we see every day and just have a normal conversation with her. Humanizing. :)
---
I explained that in the comment you responded to.
---
Arena is a better indication of balance than Constructed is. Cards must stand on their own, as opposed to being hyper-synergized with other cards which creates very high power levels.
---
In other words only super strong cards/synergies ‚Äúsee play‚Äù in Constructed, and I am sure you understand why we can‚Äôt have every card in the game be super strong.
---
This is especially important for evergreen cards for obvious reasons. 
---
‚ÄúSeeing 0 play‚Äù is a much bigger problem for expansion cards, because if they‚Äôre not seeing play in their own expansion , what is their purpose? 
---
When a classic/basic card is ‚Äúseeing 0 play‚Äù, it‚Äôs actually fine because there might be an expansion right around the corner where it does see play, maybe even a lot. So buffing it now means it‚Äôs potentially OP later, or to avoid it being OP later, they limit design because of it. Best to keep it as is.
---
Sorry, but the AI does choose discover options randomly.
---
And later still Blizzard decided nobody ever dies unless killed in their own plane of existance, be it elementals in the elemental plane or demons in the twisting nether. So Mannoroth actually lived.
---
Also the burning legion exists as one entity in multiple
---
timelines because reasons.
---
It came from the mountain dew challenge.
---
Turns out Orcs have a keen allergy to it /S
---
A subreddit to surpass r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
They could attempt to make the AI more intelligent at Discover, but it might be a lot of work, so they made it choose at random.
---
Snip-Snap is a life saver to beat the lich king with most classes. For hunter and mage I won by cheating out Molten Giants, but for every other class, Snip-Snap got me easy wins
---
Which is bizarre, because they could always say "Oh that's a variation of orcs that have different color."
---
Why it would not work...? It works perfectly well on normal mode.
---
ToT twiest are interesting but badly implemented. I don't know why they choose the unfun path on these.
---
Seems good in priest. Tough to win if they can revive everything 3-4 times
---
Sure. Evidence number 1 is the current PEGI rating (not going to bother posting a link, google is is easy and quick)
---
Evidence number 2 is the information in a previous snapshot of the google play page, obtained through Wayback Machine (https://web.archive.org/web/20190204052748/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blizzard.wtcg.hearthstone&amp;hl=en). As a bonus, you can verify the most up-to-date version of that page to confirm the rating has changed.
---
Yeah, but earthquake sounds more fun
---
I mean it wouldn't work in the way of being an interesting boss fight. I don't remember what the difference between normal and heroic mode was on that front, if normal had less boxes or something. No clue, I really only played heroic primarily.
---
how?
---
Seconded. Snip snap made easy work of 7 classes in one session.
---
If her looks concern you then you are part of the problem
---
But if a SINGLE one is not what you said, then it's wrong.
---
Lei works exactly like I said, it says "you" and duplicate the spells of other things.
---
So no, card that says 'you' does not exactly means you.
---
It has everything to do with China, that's the joke :)
---
It's even in the movie right
---
Really? Cause that makes no sense. If the AI knows how to play cards it should know how to pick the best option. Blizzard can't be *that* small of an indie company.
---
Odd cost cards reduce the cost of cards in hand by 1 treasure?
---
Funny thing is, they're green in Warcraft II (just like the Blackrock Orcs). Only in WoW was established their dark grey skin color.
---
And no, Blackrock and Dragonmaw clans are not kin, AFAIR.
---
I did this combo as well. It‚Äôs the Khadgar‚Äôs Scrying Orb treasure and the Jr. Explorer Elise starting ‚Äúgear‚Äù that every time you target it with a spell it gives you two in your hand. Endless free iron scales
---
Yeah it honestly seems legit and thought out. Either someone put a *lot* of work into this to be fake, it's a "release Blizzard was thinking of" or it's a real leak.
---
Never really cared for him. His head is too small
---
Hot
---
The only way are taverns I believe
---
Theres a leak of possible cards but its almost impossible those being the thing, cuz sylavas is there, and the reason of sylvanas gettin HoF was 1) it was just annoying gameplay
---
2) Nzoth was coming in old gods expansion
---
Guess who is confirmed to come? Yeah...
---
But consistency was never blizzard forte so...
---
I had a run at the third wing last night where I was one draw away from having all of the pieces for another infinite combo, but then the final boss had that deathrattle minion that summons the lowest-cost minion from both players‚Äô hands spawn from the chapter twist, it pulled my Jr. Explorer, and then he cast Plague of Death.
---
Managed to successfully get the combo off the very next run, though even with all of the damage I had done, it still took forever to get the very last combo piece.
---
More SMOrc power.
---
Me go face
---
From what I can tell it picks different synergistic buckets and throws em all together
---
That belongs in the museum!
---
I hate charity, but I like Character Portraits
---
*Oh no. It's too late. These people have all been infected. They may look fine now, but it's a matter of time before they turn into the undead. This entire city must be purged.*
---
This was the exact moment Arthas stole my heart.
---
Newest meta report says the lackey zoo deck is the best of all warlock decks atm.
---
So if you enjoy zoolock  just cradt him
---
He's purple for me. Green Guldan can't harm me.
---
Giving stats to HS players is like giving a knife to a baby. Useful tools on their own, but a harmful combination.
---
Finally she has right proportions.
---
This is real right ? no joke.
---
That would make sense.  Mechathun in buckets would be odd and probably too common as a way to cheese things.
---
Absolute unit.
---
It defaults to Stone, but can be Chest in classes with buffs.
---
That single lock of her hair is also kind of reddish-colored, not blonde.
---
Because the combo is not overpowered.
---
It's short for Gul'Daniel
---
mech paladin maybe? he already uses kangor, and sometime quest to have multiple mech dino eggs.
---
I'm talking the three of them. I already knew N'zoth and Rag are coming out
---
It‚Äôs not a *good* change, it‚Äôs just a visual ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù I disagree with which I dislike at all. It is also an unlockable change, therefore it‚Äôs not an instantly change for everyone, but for those who have already 1000 wins or more will have to use whether they like it or not.
---
X22#2237 EU quest trade
---
Mage with 771 :)
---
To put it in simpler terms - Garrosh was orc hitler, Thrall challenged him to a 1v1 no magic weapons only, Garrosh beat his ass, Thrall killed him with elemental spells. The Elements got mad at Thrall and refused to aid him with their powers since.
---
This picture is a screenshot of the moment Garrosh died. He got suspended in a giant stone hand, hence his arm is flopping down like that. The joke here is that the new portraits are redesigns of the heroes later on in the story (Anduin is the king now and wears armor, Jaina got this sick new Braid, Gul'Dan is just Gul'Dan but he's also dead now) while Garrosh died with his current design
---
welp...i'm just after 2 years close to fuqin 500 and i don't know how i'm gonna make 1000 on uther \*derp\*
---
Mountebank#1205 NA trade
---
Red hair was giving me willies. This is much better. Thanks.
---
I hope Blizzard will fix this blunder too. I mean, if they claim the red of the fire shines on the hair, the braid is very close and have yellow of the same strand. Which doesn't make sense.
---
Hey man, it could be worse. This is the second time warlock has gotten the shaft on quests.
---
Considering how bad secret/tempo mage is in standard right now, I think it might make those decks playable.
---
I was hesitant trying that treasure card, was this the exception that proved the rule? Seems like it's only good with big discounts like amethyst stone or khadgars orb
---
I think what will happen (provided this goes well) is we will see the classic set updated to a rotating Core Set with the rotation next year, when they will bring back in some of the best performing cards from this experiment.
---
These are potentially gamebreaking which is actually what we need becouse it's definitely gonna shake up the meta.
---
Its not hard. Im not a game designer or professional player like him but you just need to watch at MTG and see the future. Dont forget that Hearthstone design space is a lot more narrow. Power creep is real.
---
The Lords of War ones were hit and miss, but the first one for Kargath is fantastic.
---
Swiggity Swooty, I really miss that booty.
---
This reminds me of people who fused the 8/8 hydra with lifesteal and people wouldn‚Äôt notice so they‚Äôd trade 1/1s in for extra damage only for the hunter to heal to full
---
Me too. I'm actually pissed.
---
sounds like a forest in england
---
r/notinteresting
---
Agreed. Either a free discounted spell each turn or a glyph for hero power would be great. RNG for two mana just doesn't cut it
---
I enjoy transform cards, and many others do, because every match is different. 
---
I think effects that allow you to cheat out large minions very consistently and at little cost, such as Resurrect or Galaxy at 5 mana, are much more unhealthy for the game than RNG-based effects, as they warp the meta more.
---
what about toggwagle, explore, skulking geist gimmicks
---
This boss has so far been the easiest for me. I got him to 20 hp on my first run with finley, the discover hero power, and that OP ass weapon with life steal. Haven't even beaten the other bosses yet.
---
this isn't how you use this meme at all
---
One Mana discover with no Mana reduction on the spell. I see this as a fairly balanced and consistent effect. The main issue is if mage gets infinite removal from it and becomes far too powerful at control. Also pretty problematic with burn. I don't think people want to see zombeast 2.0, so it might be best to leave it weaker
---
On the concept that opponents don't know the combo to play around it, last night I had a Paladin play a turn 4 Equality, fearing my board of Northshires and the 2/6 taunt. So on my 5th turn, I played Silence on the 2/1 to restore it to 6 health, 2x Divine Spirit, and a Topsy Turvy for lethal. So it's not that my opponent didn't know.
---
Thrall fell into a deep depression after killing Garrosh and couldn't speak to the elements because of his inner-conflict.
---
Hey, the warlock quest is amazing. It's not good, but it's amazing
---
Nice! Thanks for sharing an interesting game state instead of the boring final boss tally screen like every other "one-shot" post.
---
Plus guarentee is a stretch for flame imp ...more like 50% chance depending on who goes first....because last time I checked flame imp doesn't have charge or rush so turn 1 cleric going first means your imp ain't doing shit.
---
Yeah, they changed that name like... 2 decades ago?
---
In the context of the movie, yes. Gul'dan acted dishonorably and
---
Yeah. At least kangors can bring back a taunt.
---
I never read the book, so I believe you there.
---
When does she use fire in Warcraft 3? I only remember her teleporting, and having an ice spell, arcane intellect, water elemental and blizzard.
---
That all being said, for the most part she is best represented as a user of ice and arcane. She almost never used fire when she casts spells and using fire to represent her BFA version(Where she has the raid encounter i linked) just seems wrong. Only reason I can see they went with this decision is because the mage hero power is fire blast and hearthstone Jaina prefers to use fire.
---
The discover change really hurt the singleplayer content too, like the Discover a legendary etc in Bob's tavern. I think it was a pretty badly thought out change overall really, kinda made a whole mechanic less fun just to gimp warrior a little.
---
It could be possible everyone gets golden ones like how everyone got a golden snip snap
---
The mage quest, just like the warlock one, is not meant to be a good card, that would suck for the game if an effect like that was actually good. It's meant to be fun, build some meme decks and highroll a pyro or a box.
---
Why would it be a replacement? The alt portraits we have now don‚Äôt work like that
---
&gt; who says there can‚Äôt be many battlecries triggered second on the board? 
---
Cards like Shudderwock, N'Zoth, Yogg-Sarron, Tess Greymane, Blastmaster Bomb, Bloodsowrn Mercenary, Chef Nomi, Electra Stormsurge, and at least a handful of others to.
---
Plus, the double battlecry effects in the game already perform the same function and are better for the average battlecry minion.
---
I think the only thing actually supporting it is that Gul'dan being thrown into the nether somehow leads to him arriving on our Azeroth bringing about Legion. And the nether is timey wimey stuff where a year on azeroth can be a thousand in the nether... 
---
Honestly, I'm glad it was just a tweet that I loosely remembered without a significant amount of supporting lore. It's a bullshit concept and I assumed it was significant because Wow has been filled with bullshit since "the rule of cool" became dogma.
---
What?
---
canonically a mage with the strongest staff is not really the strongest mage.
---
most of her power comes from the power she imbued from the Thunder King into her staff in Pandaria
---
which is kinda infuriating, because as horde player I didn't kill the guy just to let some alliance coward racist mage to take his power.
---
strongest mage in warcraft universe, or strongest warrior, or strongest paladin etc. during/after legion is the player character.
---
Unless you have boobs that are giving you backaches in which case it can make you very happy.
---
Meh, just thought it would be fun to try.
---
A Fordring always pays his debts.
---
lol die mad about it
---
Haha. Yeah. My fastest combo was 5 Crannies on turn 5 for 1,400 damage. 1 minute plaguelord lol
---
Oh my bad then
---
How exactly am I supposed to get 1k wins with mage when mage keeps being trash
---
And yet there are streamers like APX who are hitting ultra high ranks of legend with nothing but mage decks.
---
Will he even? Zephrys only pulls from the Classic set and Rag/Nzoth are limited availability. They might just not ever show up.
---
GetMeowth played a version of this and put it on YouTube, had a hand full of Nzoths and lost
---
Turn 6 tho
---
You must be new to the game. I've seen countless rogues hp to go back and forth from 5 to -5 to +10 thanks to Leeching poison and Kingsbane
---
Secret Murloc King
---
Zephyrs prioritizes cards you can play with your current mana. You can shape the result by playing Zephyrs with your last 2 mana. In that case you can get something that you can play next turn.
---
Hopefully he starts offering Ragnaros. Or can he not since it will still technically be hall of fame which is a different set?
---
There's also a blue post saying she only killed those fighting the detainment, which seems to exonerate her of wanton murder.
---
It definitely shouldn‚Äôt be pickable in arena. But I could see a combo eventually appearing in standard that makes it playable
---
Yes you are.  I have no idea where this came from, but of the 5 on-screen mak'goras we've ever seen, 4 involve magic, and there were never any accusations of cheating.
---
The 5th was Cairne vs Garrosh, neither of whom are mages.
---
I ended up dusting my entire wild collection, so all of the guides for it are basically nullified, fun times!
---
I swear to god that movie ruined everything.
---
Krush and Ysera yes, but with Jaraxxus still being targeted by sac pac hes pretty much useless cause Zep seems to make that connection
---
Clearly he wants you to put your faith in the light
---
He used the Westerosi spelling opposed to the Azerothian one.
---
69 hp. Nice
---
Jarraxus has 6 bms, Elise and Onyxia don't have any.
---
The important part is him being sent into the nether in one timeline, yet emerging into another as if the Legion in WoD doesn't care about conquering the universe as long as the Legion in the main universe succeed. This kind of altruism doesn't make sense from demons, unless there only was one legion across all universes. 
---
But trying to defend blizzards time travel plots is a losing battle so fuck it. Archimond just decided to Yolo the war because he realized with infinite timelines his actions did not matter.
---
Everything about this post is ridiculous. Mage quest at 0 mana or a discover would be way too strong. Also warrior's quest reward is not weak whatsoever, it's the deck building requirements and the time for it to come online that sucks.
---
Yeah I don't really see it. I'll list off some of the tier one decks and try and analyze how much of that rng is there. You have combo priest who has no rng that I can think of beyond normal draws, you have quest shaman which have lackeys and technically shudderwock cause of the order of the battlecries. You have quest Druid which has the discover a choose one card. You have control warrior which is probably the biggest outlier here with the degenerate doctor boom discover a mech and Omega assembly. Also when it comes to non super meta.decks the worst ones I can think of is quest rogue and quest mage. Both of those are super random and annoying but not very good right now.
---
How do we know this is a one-shot and you're not just some kinda liar liar cleric northshire?
---
Garrosh did nothing wrong.
---
Thrall cheated!
---
You thought infinite Tess was bad? Hoo, boy!

No. iOS is not a free/open source OS like Android, and it uses a custom microkernel that won't have drivers to work well with traditional emulation methods. you can't just emulate it on any system. While there are methods to kind-of sort-of "emulate" iOS on PC, none of them (AFAIK) can run any App Store apps like Hearthstone.
---
Man, I'm pretty limited in my Reno Genn deck, but maybe I can make my Baku Quest deck work.
---
Yeah, i've just lost 3 matches in sequence, im going to try the shaman.
---
Ah, gotcha
---
How did you manage to put it in a position to consider it over Tirion besides mana?  I've been in a ton of spots where I've wanted value and didn't need a taunt and it never has given that to me.
---
Because it's ridiculously high value card
---
I never had Millhouse... but that's still manageable, at the end of the day you know something's coming out of that shredder when you pop it. I thought you meant that portal card where you get a random minion for 2 less, my bad. Doomsguard you just play him when he's your only card in your hand. These cards you're bringing up are what I think is manageable, it's a bit RNG but you can control the RNG and know the outcomes. With all this shuffling and randoming, you can never know what's coming next.
---
Who has draw 1 card? Oh, yeah but lose health and exhaust your deck and kill yourself... It's not that OP. Lose health whilst also not dealing with anything on the board.
---
In fact, I know "Discover" is a new(ish?) ability as it wasn't there in original and that is just PURE RNG so there, point proven. Also C'thulu which took over the game for about 2 years is pretty RNG, you either draw him early and hope his missiles land or draw him late and insta win, that was a boring 2 years.
---
The 17 more N'zoths rogue just shuffled into their deck say hello.
---
There is only one choice.
---
Lord Jaraxxus.
---
Ok sorry I can't decide the probability of a minion coming out of a selection of every minion in the game and track where each card might have randomly shuffled into my deck... Piss off.
---
you guys shouldnt say the last name of obama in vain
---
&gt; Hadranox
---
Might want to re-think that one.
---
Saying that shows you clearly dont understand statistics. Of course you can't predict a single event, but over many many games the better player always win. Similar to poker.
---
Not only shamen, but shawomen and shachildren too!
---
Is that really why? It makes sense since I would only have 8 mana left. 
---
Difficult enough finishing a mage quest in this meta.
---
Man I miss Even Paladin in standard. It's the most "fair yet broken" deck in the game.
---
As AgitagedBull noted above, [the time Day9 learned that interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7z11dm/day9_finds_and_loses_lethal/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_title) is a pretty good watch.
---
He can get it back at least with soulwarden
---
So that's definitely the room for attack spawn point A, Blizzard World from Overwatch as the backdrop. Has that ever been used? Like is it OC from OW?
---
To make you not die. It's the most impactful card out there, in terms of adjusting your board. Not dying is always good.
---
If Druid is flooping a Kun they usually already won, unless they highroll with some Nourishes etc.  Also, I wouldn't be surprised if Floop + Kun simply wouldn't occur to them; look at how snipsnap got that Priest card nerfed just because they didn't search "Deathrattle" in their card database.
---
&gt;MTg article written years ago.
---
... that is still relevant and common vocabulary amongst TCG players today; meaning that your correction of what was obviously a facetious statement is not only unnecessary, but arguably pretentious.
---
I'll definetly check him out tomorrow, but since I'm a european, it is now officialy sleepy time
---
Quest Priest can easily run out of steam, and Khartut is good in both decks, so I could see some evolution happening there.
---
That's a good point.
---
Unfair to expect AI to have deeper logic than this.
---
