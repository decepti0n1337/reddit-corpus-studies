No. Is that the problem? Too many nice legendaries that they aren't giving away for free?

They hated him because he told them the truth.
---
it legit is a bug cuz I wasn't disconnected.  my opponent was spamming emotes
---
Is he really my friend if he wastes my time with this analogy? 
---

---
Also he did not have to pay for it.
---
Yes, the expansion was dissapointing and I was having a miserable time. New decks are frustrating and boring. Four months of saving gold for virtually nothing to work on, dust wise (and I was very lucky with the number of legendaries opened).
---
So I decided it was time to acnowledge HS is not a good game. I nuked muy collection (no cards, no dust) and uninstalled. Good riddance.

Sorry, you are correct, I remember having CC in hand. I honestly don't recall what the 3rd card was. I just remember not seeing Silence and picking Flamestrike with Blizzard being next to it. Logic would say it was Twisting Nether based on the other two options but I don't believe it was because I had a minion on the board and Zephyrs generally won't give you Twisting Nether if you had a big minion on the board.

I mean, on the one hand I get what your saying. On the other hand......it has been 6 YEARS! Like, I get that things are probably harder to do then they first appear, but it's pretty obvious at this point the answer with a lot of things as to when will it get done is "Never". See the new card "bug" (which is apparently just a feature at this point), Tournament Mode that has been asked for since the game's release, or the "more deck slots" meme which has been asked for.....well been asked for since we got 18 deck slots basically.
---
That things are harder than they seem I get. That it's just impossible after literally years of "development" (and that is a generous term to use with regards to this game) is just crazy to me.
---
Point is they have no reason to work on 10 concepts to scrap some, it is pretty clear what needs to be done at this point. Also they shouldn't be an average small scale team.
---
Saying "FoN+savage roar druid" is like saying "druid druid", don't think that there was a single druid deck that wouldn't run at least one copy of the combo before the nerfs.
---
Quest Rogue with Tess also dominates Control Warrior.
---
Haha, you won't admit that it's okay for somebody to complain if they are unhappy with something they have paid for :)

Read. You're just complaining. Better cards to complain about like Mad Doc Boom that can single handedly change a game than whinging on bout highroll cards.

I don't understand how can every deck be measured by the standard of whether or not it can beat Control Warrior and still consider it not overpowered

My favorite deck this expansion.  I was heartbroken when my free quest was warrior and then I pulled a warlock quest. I decided to use all my dust to make the rogue quest and I've been having a blast since. I even specifically chose the cards myself and I'm happy with the result. I managed to go back to rank 7 after I didn't play that much this past expansion.
---
you know that blizzard could simply give more cards with the adventure right? It's not a law that they can only give you 1 card for battle or something like that.
---
Complaining about the speed in which you get free shit is the weakest.
---
&gt; just stop pumping out so many cards. Instead make 2 expansions a year and inbeetwen push out a bigger update that includes game changes such as new game modes, QoL improvements and so on
---
I agree totally, and I think that the variety of the old Adventure sets helped the game over a yearly cycle massively. They introduced a different way to play hearthstone to the other two expansions and they provided value for f2p and, like myself, almost f2p players. I also agree with Blizzard's decision not to make new adventures, because actually people had had enough of them after Karazan. But two years on, maybe it's now time for a new Adventure set, just to keep things fresh, one with card rewards unlike the KotFT, although that was still cool. I'd suggest that the community now feels the same way about dungeon runs as it used to feel about adventures.

played control warrior with a ysera to outvalue the mirror, went 7-3. 3 losses were to mech hunter which I expected, quest shaman which discovered storm bringer to turn a board of 1/1s into the best evolve board I've ever seen, and the 3rd game was against control mage where his kalecgos survived a 7 minion brawl. won every mirror, including a 'priest' who lazul'd dr boom and elysia only lost because of those two RNG swings. 
---
still fuming about RNG in a competitive card game so i guess i was definitely playing hearthstone
---
Do you only definine I win cards as literal Mechathun decks or other cards that instantly end the game that turn?
---
What I mean by this is any card that grants a ridiculous advantage that might as well be instantaneous victory. Barnes does not destroy the enemy hero when played, but he often grants such a large advantage that he basically won the game on his own unless your opponent is able to perform a sort of miracle - basically, any card that almost always wins the game, directly or indirectly.
---
I feel that the options I gave are fair examples. A board full of murlocs, especially when some have charge and all have massive attack boosts, can instantly close out an otherwise competitive, or even favored for the opponent game. Rexxar would quite often provide such stron beasts and lifesteal, and his boardclear make such an impact, that it was rare to take him out afterwards. Dr. Boom provides such insane value between his passive and hero power that it's virtually impossible to take the board or outvalue him afterwards. Barnes, similarly, provides such an early boost to your ressurect pool that it's very rare to make a successful comeback.
---
I don't think this is a loose definition at all. A card that singlehandedly almost always removes your opponent's chance of winning is an "I win" to me. It doesn't need to literally kill the opponent on turn 4 to have the same effect.

I don’t agree with him. He told me to give him more reasons why the game is getting increasingly expensive (at the end of a 2 page wall of text disagreeing with the sentiment) so I figured he’d appreciate me linking him to further rationale for why the game is getting more expensive.
---
Flair checks out. Kids, don't do drugs, and don't snipe Kripp. It's bad for his hairline.

Counterpoint: to enjoy Hearthstone, don’t play the game and only visit the subreddit.
---
If everyone F2P people get all the cards than they will not be at a disadvantage. Paying players enjoy beating F2P people with better cards because F2P players are the product for the rich players. Rich players are paying blizzard to have poor players who have shitty cards to play against. Shitty players don’t mind because they also get to play a game that they can very well refuse to play. This is how freemium works in this world, from Facebook and Instagram to Google. If you don’t pay you are the product. If you pay more you are less of a product, but you are never not a product to someone else. Don’t blame the system; it’s actually beautiful and make things work. All those people who got their personal data sold on Facebook did enjoy Facebook a lot that’s why they spent so much time posting and reading content. If they quantify the amount of joy they got from Facebook they would probably realize the data breach is a fair cost.
---
Thank you Blizz for being reasonable lol
---
&gt;People refuse to accept that Blizzard doesn't always have an incentive to cater to them
---
Sorry, you meant an *economic* incentive to cater to them.  That's a pretty big difference.  Hearthstone could easily be a much higher quality game while still turning a sizeable profit.  The profit might even be higher, long-term, if they invested more into the quality of the game experience.  But instead, we get this client that feels like it's still in early beta.
---
Literally every time I queue into a match, when I find the match, my computer freezes for a few seconds.  I've seen streamers having the same problem.  Is it a deal-breaker?  No, it's just another entry on a list that feels endless.
---
Good developers can't deliver everything, but they at least have a good record of trying to meet the playerbase's demands as closely as they can.  If an element of the game is unfun and there's outcry about it, you'll see a dev response about what they're doing to fix it.  Not vague "sometime" answers, but actual, credible, "we have a team on this exact issue, expect a change within this rough timeline" answers.
---
Lambo, always coming in at the opportune moment to farm the extra karma.
---
It doesn't encourage any of those things you mentioned, it's just fun. I do agree it is annoying to lose a game to a crazy highroll puzzle box.
---
People are always going to call the top decks cancer. A smaller portion will also label any counter to their favorite deck cancer. And arguably the most reasonable group will label any combo deck cancer, no matter how bad it is
---
yes, exactly
---
This card is way underrated. I run it in "Reno" Shirvalla OTK Paladin (Standard and Wild). "Heal" has good synergy in conjunction with High Priest Thekal, "Tank Up" can get you out of (lethal) range of other combo decks, "Dire Shapeshift", "Poisoned Daggers", and "Fireblast Rank 2" are all great versus aggro and midrange decks to help control the board. 
---
Also, sometimes you just need that little bit of extra chip damage to face to pull off the 25 damage OTK. 
---
Before Baku got put to hall of fame (and Justicar for you old-heads), I used to love playing "odd" decks. The upgraded hero power just seems like a fun mechanic that I think should see more play.
---
I mean... It's not like complaining more will change anything. Anyone who believes T5 aren't aware that Boom and CC are issues are so fucking dense they might as well have their own gravity.
---
Overall though, I'm fine with the consecutive criticism. When you look at the answer to Iskar's (?) tweet, you see all the pros being like "I love x/y/z deck, but I hate boom, CC and galaxy". Meanwhile, you look at Reddit threads and it's full of vitriol with people complaining that "nothing good or new happened in the last 3 years" and that "T5 are lazy asses just reselling Dungeon Run skins, going to further milk their cows until they're dry".
---
I do understand that the main difference is that verified accounts show up first on Twitter while there is no such filter here, but the Reddit ecosystem is still exhausting like hell.

I don't know if it's the best because it's the only one I ever used, but the aptly named "Hearthstone Deck Tracker" works fine for me!
---
Does all these things you listed (tracking your deck, tracking enemy cards, marks which turn your opponent got his cards), other than tracking the rez pool.
---
It also tracks stuff like C'thun, Jade Golems, Pogo Hoppers (the stats).
---
You want to run 2 quests?
---
Weird flex, but ok...
---
Are you planning to have more game-breaking bugs and inconsistent card text in future expansions?
---
Can't say I'm surprised, Team 5 has to be one of the laziest group of people. I can't help but laugh at how bad they are at community engagement and just general public relations stuff. They screw up more than what should be allowed for a group of "professionals".
---
When are you planning to have the next tavern brawl that isn't just a repeat?
---
Unpopular opinion but why do every one hate big priest? It's not even in the top 10 wr decks on wild and it loses hard to most decks yet everyone seem to hate it. Also it's the the oly priest deck that is actually playable to climb in wild to climb as dragon/thiev even inner fire preist cant compete with other decks past rank 10.
---
Pay him. Pay this man his money....
---
As soon as GvG was released, Hearthstone entered into this three sets a year cycle. Yes, there were Adventures, but those really were not any better than full expansion sets. Team 5 was right to drop them. They sucked for new and returning players, most evidently when three of them were standard legal at once. Imagine being a new player in that situation.
---
I also cannot blame Team 5, Blizzard, or any Free-to-play game developer when they try to push free-to-play players into paying something, really anything, for the game. If no one spends, the game dies.

I'm dumbass and thought it was infinite since i've only used 30 of them.

I mean, this was also after nerfs to 2 of the best odd decks, especially odd pally which was still tier 1 even after losing level up
---
I think for the most part they were fine by that point, but they were still meta defining cards
---
What were you planning on crafting?
---
Why tv do people downvote your comment
---
LOL I’d have to charge that iPad and man Hearthstone kinda has given up on optimization for that version it’s choppy as hell last time I played on it.
---
Almost enough for a meal.

I'd like to know who wins in a friendly duel..you or Pizza.  The cat has obviously studied the game and is serious player.

P.S. Dont let him watch Garfield...he might get some bad ideas.
---

---
Redirect their resources where? Your argument seems to fail to me because if they could take them eager resources of running a card game and make another game capable of earning 51 million they would have already done it.  
---
The only way a game like this actually closed is where it is no longer economical to run it.  it supports their warcraft IP also so there is basically free advertising to push people into that game to (or vice versa).  
---
They wouldn't decide to close the game simply because profit halved as thats still a massive profit.  
---
They would look to see what they could do to lift that profit back up and right now they need do nothing because of whales.  
---
If there were no whales for X reason then they would change their model for the better to attract your business (e.g. do something about epics you mention) back.
---
as you are happy to spend a fortune on a model that is bad for the playerbase they need do nothing and keep taking your money.  
---
The same goes for every single palyer who preorders and then feels they somehow didnt get their money worth or that the gamei s in a bad state.  
---
As long as they continue doing so then nothing will change.
---
oops.  I just played it and can't get its name right.  At least he's not Zephroovus
---
It's the same as the "on our radar" bullshit whenever Barnes comes up. Barnes has been absolutely broken since at least KFT so that's for a good two years now. If he's still just *on the radar*, said radar must be broken.
---
&gt; People complain that the game is too expensive
---
It is too expensive. our post doesnt change this fact it just shows that you are were willing to pay this too expensive amount.  each to their own.
---
How are you defining CCG? Because I think we may have a misunderstanding there.
---
Yeah, they even have a "bug report" on the Client, so you can just use it when a Bug appears, in HS they ask you to submit a ticket, it gets buried, and 2 months later they nerf the Rogue Quest because maybe that's it.
---
Right... Fun maths, but the truth is that Warrior vs Mage matchup is close to 50/50. And I actually find the matchup pretty interesting from the Mage's side. It's difficult to play correctly, which makes it more fun for me than let's say Murloc Paladin (where most of the games boil down to whether they can drop Tip the Scales on T4-T5 and whether you draw an answer).
---
Your research was flawed. There aren't any hacks in HS. What you appear to be seeing is a disconnect, which isn't done by your opponent.
---
I think you're probably right, but he would win points with the fan base if he let loose. I just wish we'd get some actual insider information rather than all of the speculation on this sub. HS has been like this for a long time and it'll continue to be the same until someone like him spells it out for everyone.
---
Combo Priest is one of the strongest decks on ladder currently.
---
What response and where???????
---
Firstly. I didn't make the post to say i didn't get everything I expected. I made the post to say. Hey. This is a problem. As it's way unrealistic to expect the average player to open 300 packs. Ergo a large portion of cards are locked behind paywalls which is something I personally don't like. 
---
Secondly it has to be blizzard because different companies have different approaches. Activision blizzard being the big company they are. Will not resort to an advertising free to play model. Because advertisements would mean They are endorsed by blizzard and will affect their reputation. 
---
Let's take blizzard out of the equation. Any big western gaming company using the advertisement model? Unheard of. 
---
Can't say the same for Chinese companies. Not too much exposure to them. 
---
But basically. When your company is so huge. Everything you do reflects on you. Say you start accepting advertisements. And some of the products end up being shitty. You get put under the spotlight for endorsing shitty products. It's bad pr for the big companies and that's why they avoid it. All the free to play games with an ad model are usually smaller companies that dont have much to lose. You're comparing multi million dollar companies next to multi billion dollar companies. There simply is no comparison. 
---
Blizzard is sufficiently big enough that they could run hearthstone at a loss for the next 20 years. They won't. As I've said. Profit maximising is their aim. That is my point. I'm not arguing the possibility of what you're saying. I'm arguing it's practicality.
---
not a "hack".
---
you have disconnected / timed out even though the game hasnt worked it out and told you yet.
---
check your network
---
If that was an implemented feature then I’d rather it be an option to show my hand rather than it automatically doing so. Maybe have an option where you can request to your opponent to reveal hands to eachother then the other person can deny or accept it, but that would be annoying to click through at the end of every game. Rather have devs work on something else than this anyways
---
Absolutely disgusting
---
Hsreplay.net is a good tool.  You can connect it to your blizzard account and it will show you decks and how much dust it costs to make them
---
How? What am I missing?

Eh Neon dude, great work as always!

I would be so happy if they nerfed Boom. 
---
I pulled a golden version from that set and have loved playing him. But if I get that sweet non-disenchant dust im up 2 legendaries! 
---
If they nerfed anything on him, I bet it would be the mech rush mechanic
---
Leeching changed from "gives your weapon lifesteal" to "gives your weapon lifesteal for this turn"

Most of the "game development" critiques are unfounded. Blizzard as absolutely been adding more features to the game, imo have been steadily improving the single-player content, and have also improved card design and the frequency of balance changes. We shouldn't be complaining about lack of features after we continually get new features, just not the ones people whine for.    
---
On the other hand, I believe most of the "monetary" critiques are totally valid. The game is WAY too fucking expensive for no reason. I watch Regis Killbin a lot and this expansion cycle he opened over 200 packs before jumping in to deck construction to find TONS of cards he still needed to craft, that shouldn't fucking happen. Blizzard needs to shift their monetization more heavily onto cosmetics (purchasable boards, heroes, card backs, emote packs, card styles) coming out on a consistent basis. It astounds me how rarely we see special cosmetics and at the same time how fucked we get on packs.
---
It depends on the projected growth in player base id imagine. If they were sure that people would flock back to the game in significant numbers, then id imagine the sub would be profitable but it would take a lot of players. Sub being 13$ or so, it would take roughly 4 and a half players subbing to make up for just the one person buying a 60$ bundle every month or so which is more than most people think im sure. I dont have the data to work with of course, but I can only imagine this would most likely cause loss of money for them unless they have some sleeper cell HS players hiding in the woodworks waiting for a sub model.
---
So technically, if you like playing against actual real players you'll have a bad time, that pretty much sums it up
---
Your cat looks like a pussy. I'll happily beat him

(Nervous laughter)
---
7/7, well done
---
They have a hard time removing your eggs
---
The page about halfway through with all the likert scale questions about gaming and lifestyle was too long, I quit there, sorry.  But I liked the survey up to that point.
---
Save first, watch later.
---
That's a lotta dust bro holy shit. 62 legendaries if you wanted lol
---
You can craft every single tier 1 tier 2 and most tier 3 decks once the meta realizes. Have a good time dude.
---
Remember to save some for next expansion to so your ready 👍
---
Jesus, No wonder everyone hates the HS Community
---
He Got a refund on packs he opened, so the put him into hearthstone debt.
---
I'd like to see casual mode ban the top 5 cards used for each class and neutral.
---
You will get the usual starting amount of packs, probably including a few legends
---
I'm so envy... Congratulations!
---
Idk how much dust but you could wait till next expansion and then dust everything
---
There's no such thing as "balanced" meta, it's impossible
---
the only way reddit could possibly be pleased is if everything was free.
---
&gt;  it detracts literally nothing from the game,
---
their argument is that it removes the social aspect of the game.
---
Literally nothing good has happened since he left
---
No need to nerf. I encourage you to keep playing further and you will notice your winrate drop hard. People will play a lot of mages which is a terrible matchup for you, people will play hunter decks much more aggresively pushing you into zeph lethal range way sooner than expected, sprinkle in the occasional quest paladin which is an auto-loss for the warrior and you are set. Now that I think about it, I actually need to switch quest paladin off, because how little control warriors I see rank 4.
---
It's bs
---
"intrinsic reward" is just another term for "sense of pride and accomplishment"
---
You can't really do much to fix hearthstone without altering the fundamentals of the game itself.
---
1. The coding environment. It's initial design is a huge limitation to what can be now added to the game.
---
2. Just the game rules themselves and how cards have to be designed to fit in a certain spectrum. IT  leads to the game being stale. There aren't an infinite possibility of hearthstone cards(that are interesting or worth while to play).
---
I was about to make a post about control Warrior and I see this. Most of you obviously don’t enjoy these games against them. The question to Blizzard is “how long can this go on “?
---
[From nothing - mocha!](https://i.imgur.com/DXUUGpw.jpg)
---
People want a game they once enjoyed to be enjoyable again? I mean it's not rocket science. People complain because they care about something or feel like they have a stake in it's improvement.
---
OK, let me just ask. What the fuck happened that started this? From what I've seen, there wasn't any major event that spiraled this game into despair recently. Just the same old thing.
---
Again, he will never offer you bounce cards.
---
If it's just about getting to 5 and then memeing, Mech Hunter still exists and works just fine. I understand that it's quite boring to still play that, but Warrior has to be nerfed eventually.
---
I feel attacked.
---
Standard corporate PR. Next time try some wild corporate pr ;)
---
That's called a pro greedy developer move, you don't have to change somthing if you don't acknowledge it.
---
Lol, you mad man. Now just don't die to fatigue.
---
Not really sure what your first sentence means, ("the only skill need for control warrior is in the mirror), but it sounds like you're agreeing with me. The mirror match normally comes down to skill, which makes it fun for me.

Let's not pretend you didn't squander money when you had the perfect opportunity to improve the game.
---
Remember when you were making the most money in Un'Goro and you abruptly decided to bring half the globe on expensive travels and hotels?
---
It does seem like the higher you climb the less salt you run into. I'm sitting around rank 5/4, but I remember when I ran Zoolock when Keleseth was still around and Spell hunter with pre-nerf Spellstone and I would get so much salt for playing "those bs meta decks" at like rank 15 last year.
---
Brann is good? That's news to me
---
best memory is when one of the burgle package gave me a counterspell.
---
I shadowstepped Tess twice this game. Control Warrior just couldn't keep up with the board refill for 6 mana.
---
Think you forgot one aspect beyond Team 5 and the community. The business and stakeholders. 
---
Fact of the matter any news that would affect profits, would affect funding, shares, backing etc. Announce something concrete too soon and people will bail while theyre set to make a profit. Now they might be able to implement ideas that maintain current profit margins but they need to be able to say why. Because of that a lot of members of the team would have their hands tied to not announce anything concrete as it can have a knock on with the business as a whole. 
---
It's kind of amazing that in gaming news we had P.I's round a youtuber's house and people sued for breaking an NDA but everyone just aspects that all information should be made available because they want it. Take Iskar's response , he probably needed the response approved to ensure it didn't offer any connection to profit effecting ideas but still offered some satisfaction to the players who are losing their heads.
---
give tournament mode, replays, player profiles with stats, achievements thnx
---
Best solution: stop buying anything from Blizzard (be it HS packs or any other content) and they'll start listening and responding.
---
There will always be people who wouldn't be agree with certain aspects of the game they're playing, that happen with every game, and each community should accept the existence of that minority, **BUT**, when a great part of the community disagree with the game, hearthstone's current state in this case, either the lack of new features, balance of certain cards, or a totally absence from the developers, you can't blame it on the community being salty, it's the community being tired.
---
How do they get so much armor??
---
&gt; the reason people are frustrated is not the cards themselves
---
No, it's pretty much the cards.
---
low-key the new Warrior mech is so much value when they have Boom, it's depressing.
---
It's the shame I feel. Bad context, my bad.
---
lol just play a boring Paladin deck everything's fine
---
Just don’t expect a completed meta deck from those packs, they are classic packs. If you are entirely f2p then you have to play with budget decks for some months before being able to craft a competitive deck.
---
No, it's Big on influence and a good reflect of the overall community
---
I just wish they'd stop considering their core base as actual babies... they have been a bit better recently, but the fact that we don't even have a "Stats" page with options such as: in-game time/most played cards/best match-ups/most used deck/most successful deck etc. 
---
My biggest UI issue is the fact that I have to go to the main 'page' every time to check on my daily quests...so everytime I forget what one is, or want to check progress (if I miss it update after a game) then you have to go all the way back
---
And also just allow all aesthetic items to be bought in some capacity ( I understand the gold card back and some of the tournament exclusive ones) but if I missed 2 months of card backs because I was working and now have 0 chance of ever getting them, is gone, sucks.
---
This is a \[noun phrase\]
---
You forgot Kil'Jaeden !
---
&gt; If Blizzard prints some good cheating cards for Secret Paladin, Highlander Secret Paladin could be a deck
---
Mysterious Challenger reprint confirmed
---
not sure why you're downvoted for this.. looks like the blizzard shills came out of their caves and went to the smaller posts instead.. how sad
---
Calm down.
---
Add people who emote hello at the start of game  and well played at the end of game.
---
The reply for the complaints hasn't yet been approved by the PR department.
---
well I heared they stoped it now and all counted now after birth
---
Apart from it skipping your entire turn to basically bait 1 removal spell and draw about 6 cards max? Its so bad, even doom! Is better. Skips your turn, overdraws cards, but also clears the entire board instead of just baiting a spell.
---
So we know we're getting another fucking dungeon run this expansion. That's bad news.
---
Blizzard is too busy selling those spicy lootboxes
---
It's a good reflection of the *engaged* community.
---
And what about Adrimal Proudmoore?
---
I suppose at the time of it's death the board is clear and the reborn happens after the deathrattle, so working as intended?
---
Was out of the loop for quite some time, any chance you can link the devs asking ? I'd like to read that after yesterday's PR copy paste response.
---
Sell it on Etsy
---
That wasn't my intention at all, I love trump and his content, it was a bit of a joke and that thumbnail is in the video when trump is upset, it's quite an iconic video ill link it for reference.
---
I literally came to this sub looking for help lol Im bad new player and this iis giving me the hardest time feels Soo broken but I'm really bad so maybe it's me
---
I think I'm done with standard as I realized everything has made me feel that I can't afford these decks. I've put a lot of time and effort into understanding the meta and yet I can't shake that feeling of I'd always will be stuck on having only 2 ladder worthy decks. The highlight of my hs career was introducing griftah to the standard ladder for a bit when I was able to bring griftah to legend in a gifting rouge I made. I might do arena now as from what feels like it has to do more with skill. If you're on na, I'd love to add you bud. If you're on eu, I might switch over since I moved to france and might start up arena in eu.
---
tracking the rez pool is tricky because sometimes you will have in that also minions summoned by your opponent.
---
https://youtu.be/opjt7yU7Ka4
---
Oh! I'm really sorry, I though it was another "Hate Developer Post", didn't payed much attention, I talked from ignorance, my bad.
---
About the in-game saltiness with the hateful friend request, yeah, I've been playing this game for like 3 years now and it has always been like that, but if you are mature enough, these things aren't an issue.
---
Anywhere you go you will find nice people, disgusting people, both are ok, your attitude towards anyone should be a graceful one, just the other day someone added me to shittalk about an arena encounter, and I decided to talk him about anything else but the game, about music, about recommend me a movie, some good talk, and wished him the best of luck with his games. Sometimes the people act impulsively without thinking, they aren't bad people, they are just mad for the moment or circumtances, if you can understand that, you will be a step closer to understand yourself.
---
Isn't it stupid that the only decks that succeed are the ones that are great against Warrior?
---
If that shouldn't tell something about the meta, I don't know what it could
---
The problem is there is all this complaining about lack of features and everything else but when the next expansion get released they are the first one to get the credit cards out to pre-order and then wonder why nothing changes.
---
But why...?
---
I wanted to make a clever joke but i'm still working on it.
---
 blood stinger is awesome but hecklebot can roll really low... since you want hunter arsenal i find the secret package amazing when facing warriors. Secrets + Subject 9 into lategame zuljin can be devastating for any warr.  
---
I've been winning with warriors with my hughlander hunter that uses the secrets + beasts and its a blast. aobut 8/1 winrate atm against warriors in ranks 15-&gt;8. Bloodstinger is amazing and underused i think. This deck is expensive tho 
---
For a less expensive one there is a fun mech quest hunter that is also quite capable of dealing with warriors.  
---
There is a top legend thread  [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cpg7jg/top\_legend\_saviors\_of\_uldum\_decks\_1\_standard\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cpg7jg/top_legend_saviors_of_uldum_decks_1_standard_and/)   
---
my decks are a bit different as im experimenting with what works for me but the most similar decks from the list in this thread would be :  
---
1.  [https://hearthstone-decks.net/highlander-hunter-333-legend-kirigirisusumu/](https://hearthstone-decks.net/highlander-hunter-333-legend-kirigirisusumu/)   
---
2.  [https://hearthstone-decks.net/mech-quest-hunter-50-legend-wirerhs/](https://hearthstone-decks.net/mech-quest-hunter-50-legend-wirerhs/)   
---
In the second deck the Oblivotron + mech whelps can be swapped for something else like the 4 mana spawn 2 bombs minion + some more bombs support but the Obli+whelps will be best against any kind of control warrior
---
Only one quest can be active at a time, so its not a good idea to go for 2x quests. You would be basically forced to mulligan away one of the quests because you would be effectively limiting your handsize by yet another dead card, so there is no guarantee you would be able to complete it at all.
---
Tess Rogue with Scheme? Yes
---
Reno Mage? LUL, no.
---
&gt;  I'm with you that they could implement a lot of other features; it's just not a priority for them.
---
And that is the root of the problem. 
---
There was a survey about what features we would like to get, but there wasn't one about:
---
* Rotation that causes the newly "printed" cards to become obsolete after 16--24 months.
---
* Increased amount of big card expansion sets with double class legendaries that make  much more expensive to keep up. 
---
* Price hike for everybody outside the US.
---
Contrary to your accusation of me trying to be smart, I was pointing out that no one criticised their ability to push out content, but their lack of willingness to hire a few coders and do some feature development. Hell maybe even engineer a better development process, because the reappearing bugs, the long existing disconnect problems, the inability to play on some mobile devices for a month, and so on leads us to think they are lacking the technical expertise.
---
&gt; Is hearthstone pricing itself out of the market? 
---
No. The biggest competitor is MtG:A and it's even more expensive than HS.
---
I could imagine a pretty nutty mage one
---
Honestly with all respect Iksar some people is not buying the "we can't show until it's ready" anymore, I'm sure alot of other people plays other blizzard games and seen this exact same answer.
---
The monetization in your game needs to be changed.. make new hero portraits and add it like medivh,magni and so on if you want to keep pre orders fine but stop trying to manipulate the players forcing them to spend mostly because they will miss the hero it's awful.
---
Quests rewards needs some updating too, disenchant system as well either give more dust for disenchanting or reduce the cost to craft cards you said team5 is "doing okay and can keep up" then it's time to start delivering as you can see players are not too happy with the game.
---
Myeah, you could call it "Race to constructed"!
---
The question is not why. The question is why not
---
I see. Thanks.
---
just let them work on, this is the first card like this, you gotta let them learn and fix it where they need to
---
It might be my lack of cards but I don't seem to be able to be aggro enough im still learning how to bit lose board and when to ht face
---
still a better excuse than "the players are wrong" but how is it supposed to make you feel better that any complains simply don't reach the devs because of management decisions?
---
Yes. But as always, it isn't explicit.
---
Then it should say 'Your opponent summons a minion from their hand'.
---
Bcz your looking at other classes
---
Don't get me wrong, I really like the card. I'm hoping for more cards like this one in the future but what I'm trying to say is that his effect is not as good as people think. It does not outweights the cost of playing a Highlander deck, not at least in standard.
---
I don't even play HS anymore. I just saw this photo on my frontpage. Cute photo, hope you win!
---
That's the point normally you cant look at other classes during deckbuilding
---
GREASE FIRE! GREASE FIRE!
---
Honestly with that many deathrattles or other dispellable effects it should just always offer mass dispel
---
Similarly in hearthstone, you can get cheap decks that are very competitive. Like token druid and mid-range Hunter.
---
Dota 2
---
The "X is killing the game" comment cycle is killing the game
---
Honestly that’s the main complaints. This game is really expensive and I kinda agree. If you want I think the best part is to maybe consider arena? If you can get good at that then it’s easier or the only option besides buying.
---
In Uldum set.
---
hit 7/8 with 8/8, finish it with bees. now you have 3/5, 8/1 and 3 bees. you decided to get 12 armor for 7 mana instead
---
Are you working on a new banner??
---
Just stop playing mate, no one is forcing you to it.
---
You're confusing the points. MOBAs require a lot of knowledge, that's a fact, but can and actually are played for free. 
---
You can have all the knowledge of Hearthstone meta and its intricacies but you can't do jackshit without the collection that either requires time or money.
---
How can you even know it's a joined decision? I worked at few different jobs and I can tell you that when boss tells you to do something, no matter how dumb and unproductive it is or how much it damages the company, you must do it. Developers can manage some things but their job is to extract the value from the game now and I doubt they are given much freedom for anything else
---
Am I missing something? Aren't you immune due to malganis?
---
It isn't. The point of this post is just to say that directing our complaints (and our anger) at the devs will achieve nothing positive.
---
"proves"
---
Do we already know if the new Solo player content from Uldum has wings again which have to be paid with gold, like the last time? Has there been any kind  of information about this at all so far, should I be saving my gold for this?
---
That's also confusing because your opponent is not the one summoning the minion, you're forcibly summoning the minion for him.  It's best to keep the wording simple. 
---
Also, by that logic, Knife Juggler should read, for example: "After a minion is summoned on your side of the board, deal 1 damage to a random enemy."
---
i always were 0-3 back then when i played arena regulary the last time. Guess i should watvh Kripps arena guide First and then get 5-3 at least xD
---
Stating that the game is to expensive to allow for multiple fun decks is a reasonable complaint.
---
The one most people tend to make around here is that they can't play good decks because the game is too expensive, that's nonsense, the game easily allows for you to create a single good deck.
---
Big priest is such a meme on here. It's fine. It only sucks when they get lucky with Barnes. Same way that cubelock is fine until they have 3 different ways to cheat out a void lord on turn 5.
---
Also I like zuljin &gt;~&gt;
---
This is also just an opinion but wouldn't feature like tournament indirectly increase revenue as it would make bored players and streamers come back, thus selling more packs?
---
In the end you might be right when saying their analysts concludes it is not worth it. It is just deceptive for a player like me that started during beta.
---
It has a ~20 rating
---
"responded"
---
you dropped something:  /s
---
Cleaning Commencing! - This is a scary place! - ARMOR UP! - Defend da gates! - Light the fuses! - Unity, precision, perfection! - I'm SUITING UP! - Save the best for last! - Warpath a little bit, brawl a little bit - That's it, I'm outta cards! - This story deserves a new ending! - Here comes the BOOM!
---
You forgot Illidan. ^^^^ /s
---
not much to brag about
---
Should I come back to the game after 2 years considering that I have 0 money to spend?
---
Ironic you have yogg flair...
---
I see nothing.
---
But good for his wallet.  Worth!
---
What is the backlash in response to? Sorry, I've been on vacation so I'm not quite up to date and am very puzzled by all this hate on the sub lately. What went wrong?
---
Sometimes they just cry for the sake of crying.
---
Vargoth too.
---
Idk who any of these characters are but Queen Azshara looks so bad ass! Love the design
---
Not only that but Zephyrs is so broken that he gets put into decks that aren't even singleton. That is how brokenly strong the card is.
---
Wait what do you all mean? Theres only 18 deck slots so only 18 decks total right?
---
I knew some small minded chucklefuck would fixate on this line. Except unlike Blizzard I've got players responding.
---
Given the constant talk of how no new UI changes can be made because of mobile limitations, I'd argue the market Hearthstone has is Mobile Digital Card Game (that just happens to have PC compatibility). In that light, it's impossible to price themselves out of the market - they're the only meaningful player in it.
---
I tried a lot of things, there is just no way to fix it, at least I didn't find one.
---
Yes, that cheeky bastard too
---
it would be soooo freaking nice if i could dust that thing...
---
Lol
---
&gt; the new 10 mana taunt divine shield 
---
Which card are you talking about exactly ? I looked all around the HS card collection and there is no minion that fits your description !
---
Take off rush from boom and nerf Luna’s and half of people’s complaints about the game will evaporate right there. It’s so simple
---
I also dont like Zephyrs. He is overly broken and the singleton restriction isn't even important as he is so broken that people put him in decks that aren't even singleton. He is like Yasuo in lol, fun to play but ultra cancer to play against
---
To be fair, you appear to be English-speaking, considering that you speak English...
---
You realize that as the pool of cards grow, wild is going to be slower and slower to change, right?
---
Look at legacy or vintage Magic, some of those decks have been around years.
---
How did you get the obelisk?
---
- About warrior ? yes
---
- About CC and Luna ? yes
---
- About packs pricing, duplicates and dust ? yes
---
Its more on the lines of saying the Army of Uganda could wipe out the United States military because they make the right moves and have a greater team spirit.
---
If you paired up two equally skilled players to verse each other.
---
One has 12000 enchantment dust to spend on a deck.
---
The other has 3000.
---
Who is more likely to win, someone who has the ability to create one of the many popular (meta decks) with all of the cards, or someone who can create another meta deck with only 3/4 of the cards.
---
I genuinly cannot remember the last time a meta deck like token druid was on the very top of winrate above the 20 other expensive decks.
---
More money means more cards and more enchanting dust.
---
More enchanting dust means more adaptation to the meta by being able to craft and collect more cards.
---
Having more variety and abbundance of cards will always be a better thing.
---
Im not sure what type of game you would call p2w, because as it stands there is no such thing in your argument.
---
I am genuinly enjoying this argument, nothing gets me more pumped having a 1 on 1 with a fellow keyboard warrior.
---
My opinion stands.
---
Thank you for your answer!
---
Redditors rise up!
---
It's anti synergy with spectral Cutlass lol
---
And Zephyrs is ultra brokenly strong and cancer to play against
---
At the moment Wild Secret Mage is perhaps one of the most played decks in the format and it usually only runs one Legendary, Aluneth, and one Epic, Ice Block so it costs around 3,5k dust and if you are on the cheap side, Arcane Intellects can fill the void of Aluneth while maintaining competitiveness of the deck. Sure, it won't be the strongest version out there, but getting a meta deck for 2k dust is preetty good. 
---
For Warrior you have Pirate Warrior that only really needs one Legendary to make it work: Patches. Leeroy is a must anyway so I would not even count that in its cost. Many lists use Sir Finley, and again, it is a leggo from an Adventure and not really necessary to make the deck work, so you could say a good Pirate warrior will cost around 5,4k dust and a decent budget version with only Patches (you can't leave that one out) is easily less than 4k dust.
---
Historically, Mage has often had a viable budget friendly option like Freeze or Tempo, while Warrior has almost always had it's strength in Epic cards. Perhaps Patron Warrior was a bit more budget friendly but the so-called wallet warrior used to cost around 12k-17k dust - which is less than the juiciest Highlander decks out there today.
---
Lmao "part of the problem" as if this sub is seeking righteous justice for the game they love. Players would rather play armchair developer and whine about how easy client updates are to implement. That's more of a problem to me. And it's harming my enjoyment of the sub.
---
Eh alright dude. Appreciate the effort. 
---
I will just manually copy paste until then. 
---
Thanks and keep it going!
---
Being f2p since 3 years. With the dust between the addons and the 50-70 decks I can buy , I can always play viable decks. Dunno what’s your problem.
---
Try gwent and you wont open hs app never more...it's totally free to play and muuuch more fun...
---
I only wish for control warrior to face many mirrors in the future. It is like watching 2 snails race towards a line  of salt.
---
It's not fixed since we don't have our gold back yet.
---
I kinda feel like the real reason why this expansion feels expensive is the sheer number of epics required to play a deck 
---
Look at tip the scales paly, that’s 4 epics alr, and I haven’t even counted Finley and nomi and leeroy 
---
Most decks used to run few to no epics (midrange hunter in ungoro and KoFT needed none), but suddenly all the good support cards now are mostly epics (zoolock now needs magic carpet)
---
Epics are pretty darn expensive (esp if you don’t get any) and it feels really bad to roll niche or bad ones that won’t see any play, then have to craft a bunch more just to play the deck you like 
---
This has brought the cost of deck experimentation up, since it’s much more risky to craft epics to complete a deck than to do the same for rares and commons
---
Honesty highlander decks have always been really expensive, for obvious reasons.
---
Haha yeah I get that, it's cool.. I never said the game wasn't overpriced, but ya know, f2p games weren't new five years ago - I knew what I was signing up for by getting invested in hearthstone, I think most others did too - they are treadmills to nowhere. Point is, after five years I expect my treadmill to come with more buttons, features and programs, and patience is running out.
---
For sure.
---
Lol then that you get the ol' naga sea witch argument. I don't have a solution. I just like pointing out it went from a buff to a potential nerf.
---
Quest Shaman is a serious Shudder deck, and it easily reaches that cap.  
---
  
---
https://youtu.be/hJzU7RhfR9s?t=1321  
---
In this clip, if Shudder had executed all of the battlecries in the pool, then the Lifedrinker battlecries would have been lethal on their own. However, not all of the Lifedrinker battlecries triggered because the other battlecries filled up the 20 slots first.
---
&gt; i dont get the BiG pRiEsT bRoKeN meme at all.
---
99% of complaints and memes about Big Priest are about Barnes. Resurrecting big minions for a low mana cost is fine, but not on turns 4/5 imo. 
---
I can't say much about Control Warrior in standard, but I know that Quest Paladin absolutely crushes it as well as other, more "greedy" lists. I don't deny that Control Warrior is problematic, but this strays from my original point, which was that we've had to deal with a single "problematic" deck for far longer than standard players.
---
You're doing something wrong if that's the case for you.
---
Can we finally get tournament mode?
---
Cool, let me know what your job is so I can also call you grossly incompetent when I vastly underestimate the time it takes you to do your job.
---
"They" works, and includes nonbinary folk.  But some people don't like the singular they, do as you please.
---
They also changed the daily quest payouts, moving it from 2 free packs every 5 days to 2 free packs every 4 days. That means that over the course of the expansions life (\~90 days), you can easily collect 45 free packs. That's enough to fill out every common.
---
Do I think the product is expensive? Yes. That's why I don't pay for it. Also griding out 100 gold from 30 wins each day does not sound fun. So I don't do it. You know what does sound fun? Logging in and playing a game or two each day to relax. Sometimes I build a new deck. Sometimes I pull out an old favorite. So I'll play less than 200 games on ladder between each expansion. And that makes the game fun for me.
---
Don't like the price? Don't pay it. But they're a business, and they get to set their prices based on what they think will be the most profitable. Are they gouging? Sure. But your best way to vote is with your wallet. If they can keep selling product at this price, you can bet that they will.
---
Gwent is discussing a mobile version?
---
If not for the community complaining when the game is in a bad state literally nothing would ever get fixed.  You can thank them all later when the ire gets results and you get a better game.
---
Don't underestimate wrapped golem. Unlike the egg and whelp it threatens 7 attack right away and creates a taunt to protect itself. I have yet to lose a mirror against a quest Paladin using the mech package
---
Developer, so i at least know something about a few of these things.
---
Just play MTG arena and you would answer the question. in MTG arena you can invest 100 dollars and never look back as a f2p player.
---
&gt; This is also just an opinion but wouldn't feature like tournament indirectly increase revenue as it would make bored players and streamers come back, thus selling more packs?
---
Its easy to just say 'tournament', but no one would have a good idea as to how exactly it would be organized.
---
Clash Royale had a tournament mode just a few months after launch and the fever immediately died out a few weeks later. After years of existance, the mode never made any revenue spike.
---
I bet Brawliseum is one of Blizzard's attempts to survey this mode's potential. If the Tavern Brawl itself is not repeated very often, i doubt it brings any positive result.
---
I definitely feel like it is. I've played Hearthstone since 2015, but picked up Magic Arena in 2018 and it's just so much cheaper. I drop 100$ an expansion in arena, and by the end of the season, I have a complete set of all the rares, and basically a full set of all the non-meme mythic cards. Hearthstone meanwhile, would usually only give me about half of the playable non-meme legendaries, and maybe like 60% of the playable epics for 100$. So I know where my money is going.
---
&gt; Has there ever been a time either of these classes were affordable to be competitive?
---
Aggro Warrior was once a ridiculously cheap, ridiculously OP deck.
---
80g Challenge a Friend Quest . I can show mine, we play yours first.  
---
\[NA\] rtert3#2917
---
How are you liking that Aggro Warrior deck? It looks fun as hell, but I thought it was going to be one of those decks that fall in the ranks significantly after other decks became less greedy.
---
Yeah I'm in this boat. I occasionally log in to play Reno casino mage in wild or something silly like that, but I'm probably done keeping up with standard at this point.
---
I'm ready to be down voted to hell, but around 200-250$ actually gets you the whole set (or at least this is my experience with 3 different expansions bought with Amazon coins)

Hey bskakwi, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
That escalated quickly
---
Not from me, I play a lot of Wild and I haven't seen a single Linecracker Druid.
---
how often do you play. An expansion comes out each month and I assume you at least buy the expansion bundle. It should not be to much to get enough dust every 3-4 months for 2-3 legendries and then get some from the packs
---
Devastators.
---
I’ve been using the “typical” version of it, roughly what is found from Thisj &amp; Zetalot. I reached Legend with it quite easily.
---
I think they need to decide if they want to ease up on the cost to make it easier to join as a new player, but then that could also lead to the most dedicated players (that already have good collections) not having to spend a dime.
---
The most dedicated players (say they average 50g in daily wins, maximize daily quests, and get an 80g friend challenge or two per week) can average 120+ gold per day. If we take 120 per day that's enough for 146 packs per expansion. 
---
But the current game is really tough to start as a fresh player and get to the point where you have the cards to try out multiple decks. 
---
My guess is the status quo wins out or maybe they make small incremental changes to slightly reduce cost.
---
Here is the comment
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/coz9ww/z/ewqgsk2
---
That shitpost is just as bad as the current state of the game
---
Wow a mana cheat mechanic into an instant win, this game is so exciting and fun!
---
This sub has a bit much of a hateboner right now, damn. At least fact-check your own silly thread.
---
Even if it was correct, it's much, much easier to respond to a light-hearted comment with a simple explanation than it is to respond to something regarding the core nature of the game and/or something they might want to wait for specific times to share.
---
Yeah I don't buy what they said about putting rewards behind a hard event would make people who don't enjoy it "grind it out".  If they don't care about getting the skin, they won't.  I can say personally I didn't care enough about the portrait to do the LK event, but I'm glad it's there for people who did.  
---
It really is just a paywall - the event itself is pretty much irrelevant, anyone who buys entry gets the "reward" (completing all wings on normal is very trivial to the point of feeling like a joke).  Having a "i did the thing" show-off cosmetic is a lot more satisfying than a "i bought the thing" version.  The only time it would be a problem is if the "I did the thing" version required you to pay2win, but as you noted that was not the case with LK.
---
Can't believe you forgot brann, who made highlander hunter viable by himself. Reno is not good enough ? Reno is amazing, he can clear wide boards or big threats, its versatility makes it great. Finley doesn't see play but is good, you're right. You're also right about Elise and Zephrys.
---
IMO, many legendaries are great in this expansion, the fact that they don't see play is probably because of control war or highlander mage, who dominate the meta and prevent greedy decks to see the light. 
---
However, I really don't understand your point, as you say it is expensive but not so many legendaries are great, it is kind of contradictory.
---
But are isolated rng, everyone starts on the same point every game, for a casual player the game he lost to bullshit rng could have been the game he won by bullshit rng, on hearthstone for a casual player the game he lost was bcs the other guy had a better deck, one he will only get if he spend money, on autochess the casual player just play again bcs he know the team comp that massacrated him can be achieved on that game, on hs he just looks the dust price of the opp deck and quits playing
---
as a priest main since years, i rly don’t care of these big boards since Mass Hysteria or Plague of Death or psychic scream or whatever 
---
 you just lose that understanding and respect for big boards over the years
---
this board isn’t rly that scary. Hello Conjure Mage or even priest with double mass resurrection + vargoth
---
but it’s funny when i’m watching streams and other classe struggle clear even the half of this board on the picture
---
Or you just play the online clients for free? And unlike Hearthstone, you can always opt out. Your cards have value and you can sell them again. Unlike Hearhtstone where your cards turn into literal dust :-).
---
Can you offer anything other than "no u"?
---
having Gruul will not open any realistic deckbuilding opportunities that you didn't have before. if you are trying to argue it will then you're purely arguing in bad faith
---
You guys will spin anything negatively, huh?
---
Thanks I’ll never be able to see it the same way again
---
I'm also on Andriod. No problems here. Try re-installing?
---
I feel the same way. Everything is so broken in wild that losing doesn't really feel that bad and winning with a meme deck feels much more satisfying.
---
Front page is on fire and you ignore us to comment on posts like these
---
Ya, witcher 3 isnt a card game, you cant play it on mobile. It's like saying it's not worth to spend $15 on a movie ticket because you can watch youtube for free. I played league for 8k hours and have spent less than $20. I got subnautica for free from epic game store and enjoyed it for 30 hrs. Does that mean I should never pay for any games? As a matter of fact, I got witcher 3 from humble bundle long time ago and I still havent played it because I want to finish the last 2 games first but my backlog is so huge and I cant commit a long section for a long single game any more. HS is expensive but comparing HS and witcher 3 is like comparing apples and oranges.
---
Lol no, cards on MTG only devalue like that on Standart, If you play eternal formats they only drop that hard when banned
---
We've known this since before the release.
---
This argument never makes any sense. There's this paradoxical circle jerk that Blizzard is extremely greedy while simultaneously refusing to give players what they want.
---
It never occurs to the people constantly complaining that they might be part of a vocal minority that simply isn't big enough to warrant Blizzard catering to their demands. If they were, they would do it no questions asked, probably years ago.
---
People want this game to be something it was never intended to be. That's why there's nothing wrong with telling people they should go play something else.
---
So how do you propose someone gets just the right cards they 'need'? I already have an idea but maybe yours is better.
---
I switched to F2P the last couple expansions and I’m sitting here with 4 shitty legendaries from this xpac and 6k dust, waiting for a Dr Boom nerf that probably won’t come before I use my dust.    
---
    
---
the ironic part is it’s not so different from when I was preordering, except I was less hesitant to use my dust from previous expansions. If $50  got you even half a set, guaranteed, I’d spend it.
---
Can I peep your list ?
---
 z1mbus #2622 EU - gold quest, as always you go first
---
There's a very simple and logical explanation.... It's not the devs it's the company they work for.
---
It's pretty fun, and decent, high tier 2 I'd say. What makes it the most fun is Bloodsworn Mercenary, this card is amazing, the possibilities are so great. When you copy a berserker that's already buffed, you get 2 5/1 with reborn on turn 3. 
---
I hated pirate warrior because it was too smorc for me, but I like the enrage mechanic and the shenanigans you can pull with bloodsworn
---
Yep most likely. For me it's interesting seeing a new player experience this as most of the time it is totally one sided with no hope of a comeback. I don't know how new players get in to the game to be honest.
---
It's all buzzwords when they need to promote a new expansion. I'm sure you can go 5 years back and find answers similar to the top one.
---
My bigger worry are people who believe this stock replies without a shred of substance. All PR buzzwords, nothing concrete.
---
It’s this kind of rational thought that’s unfortunately absent in a lot of posts.
---
'too' see, yes?
---
I don't need the math to know **it is**.
---
I definitely hit a Shudder with the bloodstinger day 1 of the expansion playing a highlander Hunter, and it felt really good.
---
No.
---
You can sell your hearthstone account lol... it's never worth nothing. I sold my first one for $250.
---
While this is not a situation concerning law, I am reminded of the saying 'The maxim of the law is that silence is consent'. You got nothing to say when you stand in the dock, you are deemed guilty.
---
How long can this go on? ⛏️⛏️
---
I mean, this is one approach. It would suck though if the two classes you chose to focus on when through a year or two of being mediocre or crap, which is certainly possible.
---
LINK TO LAST THREAD WAS PURPLE AND I LIKE "HM, I DON'T REMEMBER GOING TO RAGE THREADS FOR PAST TWO WEEKS", THEN I CLICKED IT. 10 MONTH SINCE LAST ONE.
---
JUST LIKE TEAM 5 WITH NEW QOL FEATURES.
---
First time getting past 10. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
not just that, his trades were terrible, use of his cards was terrible, took most of the time of his turn and came up with nothing and even on rope waited too much.
---
God that game was hard to watch..
---
&gt;There is no real leadership. Maybe you are referring to the managers.
---
It wouldn't sell preorders. In fact it would be pretty stupid to spend upwards of 100 dollars on a set that you have no idea about.
---
Yeah, was thinking about anything faster, but it looks like the only payoffs available can deal one random damage per proc at best.
---
What’s the purpose of this post?
---
I think Mike’s recent comment in hscirclejerk does a better job explaining how fucking abysmally stupid and entitled this subreddit is than I ever could, and sheds some valuable insight on how this subreddit is viewed by the devs:
---
&gt;[Replying to a parody of the recent ‘keyword’ posts]
---
&gt; I see you are trying to catch up with r/Hearthstone but you have a lot of work ahead of you!
---
prep coin concede
---
Idk about that. I personally don't play mtg but a friend of mine recently sold some old cards for around 200 euros. He probably paid something like 500 when he got them so it's not like it's not a big loss, but the flexibility of say buying cards for a deck and selling them back if you get bored of it can't be understated.
---
Like I said personally I don't play and probably never will outside of mtga or loaning a deck from a friend due to the prices. Hearthstone on the other hand is obviously easier to get into but is a lot more predatory with it's storefront. Just the fact that you can drop 80euros on the preorder and get like 20% of the expansion's legendaries is absurd. That's an AAA title and change or your pick of like half a dozen fully fledged indie games.
---
This is the best card ever and it feels fair to play against.
---
&gt;Here we decided that putting a reward of some object behind this incredibly hard task would probably cause people to grind it out even if they didn't enjoy it, just to get the reward. We prefer for tasks this hard to let people complete them because they enjoy the process (this is called an intrinsic reward).
---
...even though nobody has ever complained about card backs/hero skins being hard to obtain. You couldn't be bothered to add it in, nothing more. Stop lying to your playerbase all the time.
---
I puke never be implemented, blizzard doesn’t want to make the game seem anymore P2W then it already is.
---
It's a physical deck building card game.
---
yeah this shit takes longer than theoretically infinite snip snap and that one was already pretty much impossible
---
Honestly reddit is a pretty small community, especially when it comes to active contributers that still play the games they are subscribed to. Just look at the reading vs. subscribed ratio.
---
Blizzard has huge active forums, they have partnered content pages and they have their own news channels through the launcher, through their webpages and through their media outlets.
---
I keep seeing "nothing new ever" again and again... what about the huge single player content last expansion? Single player adventures is a mode they added. So is tavern brawl.             
---
I haven't been playing for months, so you don't need to convince me that the game is getting old, but you lot sound like a bunch of whiny kids with Alzheimer's.
---
&gt;are asking for is essentially Hearthstone 2.0 a complete hearthstone 
---
No. They are asking for cheaper game which can be regulated by bigger dust giveaways. They are asking for more deck slots. They are asking for tournament mode. This could be as little as 1000 dev hours or 1/3rd of a programmer.
---
Does anyone know how generous MTGA is comparatively? I know they do more expansions and have more cards so they can prob afford a few more free packs. Just unsure if they “rip” off as much as HS does?
---
#Leeboi 11440 NA, 80g quest
---
You should make more :)
---
fair enough, but I *want* the cards more then I want more dust. 
---
but I have boycotted expansions before and will again when blizz does things I dont like
---
I didnt buy packs during some bad metas, and some sets looked meh so I didnt buy as many or any. But blizz recently did some balance changes that I appreciated, where they *buffed bad cards* and then they showed me a set full of cards I want to play with, from mogu memes to new quests to new reno cards, my favourite shit. 
---
so Im buying stuff this expansion, and if blizz released crap or doesnt do anything to improve by next expansion, I simply dont buy that one. It is very deliberate, when they do bad I dont buy, when they do good (in my eyes) I buy. 
---
you can tell me that a full boycott of them would be more effective, and youd be right, but I do it my way because I still like the game, and enjoy it, and want cards. I only put my wallet away when stuff is really bad. Right now it isnt really bad imo, they *should* aim to keep f2ps active with more dust rewards, or changing it to 10 gold per win to keep everyone happy, instead of 10 every 3, but that has been a long time coming, so I dont expect it this second. if they get to the next set, and dont do balance changes, or give players better options, then Ill just skip it, play wild
---
also, for balance, I am ok with control warrior being the king, compared to all the cancer ive faced since beta, this isnt even close to bad enough to make me salty. 
---
I do hope you have a good day though, and you do have a point, sorry for ranting at you. ily (and if you want packs pm me ill add you, if you beat my reno wild hunter without new brann ill gift you packs)
---
Zephrys is just as bad as control warrior and you cant change my mind
---
The monthly subscription of an MMO let's you experience everything the game has to offer, and is peanuts compared to what a similar cost would be to do that in HS. If HS had a monthly subscription and I got all of the cards that would be way cheaper and easier to swallow than the current system.
---
I've spent money in online games on cosmetics, it was a game where you change the banner of another team for a few dollars to taunt them. Has no lasting effect, no effect on game play, but is cheap and funny. Spent probably over 100$ on such and similar features in that one game.
---
Meanwhile spending money on packs and even pre orders is just too expensive to be worth it. It's not like I don't have the money, but if I buy I feel bad, I feel like i was ripped off. 
---
I'd bet there are many people like that, who are willing and able to spend, but not under current atrocious model.
---
"IM SUTIN UP" "LIGHT THE FUSES" "NO TOMB CAN HOLD ME"
---
I think it's general good practice and industry standard to not respond when there's nothing to say regardless of policy.
---
What are they going to say anyways? Sorry? We're working on it? We're not working on it?
---
There is no win in responding here. You know the saying:  'it is better to remain silent and be **thought** a **fool than to talk** and remove all doubt '
---
It only gets easier after not buying your first expansion!
---
 
---
I recommend Wild and Arena to mix things up.
---
Did someone say free packs!?!? 
---
Jk, and I didn't try to sound rude, I was just left a bit confused by your first comment. Thanks for explaining though.
---
No I can't think of any either. With Arcane Giant or Grave Horror you can get sick tempo out on an early turn when you have the exact cards for the combo in hand, but HS has kind of moved past the point where an 8/8 early runs away with most games, especially in Wild.
---
I agree that threads should be either constructive or humorous so that the "rage" posts don't become the norm. So you have my upvote.
---
But using the word "dev" does not mean that the comment is directed at only the people who support the software.  It is meant for anybody who has a voice in presenting/endorsing ideas that will satisfy the customer base as well as profit the company.  These are all people that are "developing" the product.
---
Just as one example of where I would guess that software developers may be asked their opinion is if they are asked for input on "How can we make another version of the dungeon run but make it better".   Feedback on forums can give insight on what is liked/not liked and used as one factor in defining "better".
---
Not really. HS has been this way for years now. If you want to play a game with more frequent updates and a fairer pricing model etc, then it’s time to move onto something else.
---
Nice throwaway account to be so aggro with. You pussy. Why get angry over criticism of a game anyway is beyond me.
---
I am perfectly happy with the new expansion and all content, I am happy with price of packs, etc and certainly do not feel 'shafted' by the current release. You have no fucking clue and your assumptions are ridiculous.
---
OPENED 30 PACKS, 9 GENEROUS MUMMY. YES I WOULD LIKE ANOTHER ONE PLEASE.
---
If you compare this to Dr. Boom, DS Rexxar didn't even have to have mechs in the deck to shine. You could just slam it into the most mindless face deck and call it midrange.
---
fair enough :) and dont worry you didnt sound rude, at worst a bit of the "I gotcha!" that is common on the internet, all good. also im serious, im proud of my reno hunter :)
---
There's really nothing to gain from lying in an anonymous online poll regarding your spending habbits.
---
People are probably even underestimating how much they spent over the years.
---
Well, no.
---
Most companies hire a community manager or two, who will actually communicate with the community.
---
&gt;"is expecting from these replies"
---
Dear Community. We have heard your complaints and will be committing to the following courses of action:
---
1. Dr Boom and Conjurer's calling are oppressive. Some others cards are borderline. Nerfs to oppressive cards by the end of this week.
---
2. The cost has indeed gone up. We will be upping dust giveaways considerably. Commons will now dust for 10.
---
3. We will create a tournament mode within 3 months. We are going to run it through a seperate client and it will be non-mobile.
---
and so on.
---
It is not so hard but they are paralyzed by lack of leadership.
---
Honestly it’s 50/50 for me. I either add someone because they were playing something cool af and I want more info on if &amp; possibly the deckcode, or it’s a Control Warrior player who BMed me the whole game like it was such an accomplishment to beat my homemade highlander Paly deck with his Dr. Boomshit shenanigans. And even then it’s more about talking shit about the deck and their unwillingness to be fun than anything personal. 
---
For the most part my interactions with others are more positive than negative though lol.
---
I do like the idea of the old doom hammer version coming back but I’m worried it won’t be able to get the opponent low enough to burst down so maybe the doom hammer version with an extended Murloc package
---
I have not made any threads complaining (at least recently in this latest uproar) but I 100% believe people have every right to complain (whine) if they want.  To say "well nothing is going to get done so don't complain" is somewhat absurd (no offense meant to OP, I do agree it gets annoying all the negativity here), but the whole POINT of this sub is to give a voice to the community.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyway as I put in a prior thread the cycle of people complain of HS --&gt; people complain of complainers --&gt; people have a right to complain --&gt; well damn let's complain about that... is the natural cycle of reddit.  I personally think saying "don't complain" is kind of ridiculous however, people have that right, if YOU don't wanna read it, then you can stop coming to this forum or go to the wild or competitive subs which are much less negative.  How is that for 2 cents for ya.
---
And if they have nothing substantial to release or say at the moment? Are they supposed to make something up because the sub reddit is complaining? I mean, the complaints are valid, but expecting immediate replies is ridiculous. It's not entitled to provide feedback. That's normal. It's entitled as fuck to expect any company to reply any time you have any issue. I saw one dude bitching because a dev wasn't replying to his DM's. Wut.
---
Frowz#11497 on NA looking to trade 80g quest, I show you go first
---
Yeah there is probably alot more 😂 Zephrys have been letting me down as well a couple of times tbh
---
Spot on. It seems so difficult to convince people who nuke half their collection once a year and then complain about deck costs that it is a really bad idea.
---
How dare they give you the wrong free stuff. You were right to leave.
---
&gt;Can we really blame them for responding to one of the few positive things directed at them for once?
---
Yes, telling us they are just as frustrated and confused as we are would go a hell of a long way.
---
Save the best for last
---
Go back to one class legendary per set. Problem solved
---
He probably meant non lootbox buyers. Leveling gives 1 lootbox so.
---
Brode was a hype man who helped smoth over customer relations. Even if in meaningless ways atleast we felt heard.
---
I think Lightwarden graduating to obnoxious was sort of inevitable.
---
They’ve done a good job with limiting snowball 1 drops probably because of lessons learned from Undertaker.
---
Secretkeeper and Tidecaller are good examples of limiting early game snowball since you really can’t get too out of hand with summing murlocs or playing Secrets.
---
Healing in Priest is now much less limited in that sense because of the ol Pyro cycling cards.
---
It’s not even worth discussing Lightwardens balance given where things stand with Boom, CC, and also taking into account Priest in general.
---
But I think it’s a good example of how perfect storms can happen.
---
I love playing with my fiancée. I'd recommend sharing decks or making your own rules to balance out collections. It makes owning the right cards a bit superfluous.
---
Blizzard is making money from the game, you spend about $150 per expansion and that's not uncommon. They would still be making money if you only spent $100 per expansion, and that's the point. $450 a year is a lot to spend on a game to get the full content. 
---
There is ABSOLUTELY nothing wrong with spending money to support game you enjoy, that's not what's being argued here.
---
People aren't forgetting that Blizzard needs this to make money. People just don't believe the prices are justified. Pre-order is $80 and doesn't ensure that you get what you need to be competitive. For a third of a year's worth of content, $80 is insane.  
---
Only a small percentage of players will ever spend actual money. This is true. But that percentage would be higher if it was cheaper.  
---
It's not wrong to be willing to support a game you love, but the amount that they are asking for is out of many people's price range.
---
Someone played a lot of mtg Arena. But this sint mtg :)
---
I'VE OPENED OVER 30 PACKS NOW AFTER SAVING A TON OF GOLD FOR THIS EXPANSION AND IVE ONLY RECEIVED MY FIRST ONE FROM THE GUARANTEED LEGENDARY IN FIRST 10 PACKS AND THE GOD DAMN FREE QUEST I GOT WAS THE MAGE ONE YAYYYYYY SUCH A GOOD, CASUAL GAME
---
Yeah the nerf to Prep has REALLY hurt rogue, I still think it was unnecessary as most rogue decks suck now. 
---
But the rotation itself from RoS to Uldum was done well as there was enough content that I didn’t get bored until the last few days before Uldum came out
---
Literally this sub:
---
Dev's don't answer: complaints
---
Dev's answer: Complaints.
---
This single post is *literally* complaining BOTH about devs answering and not answering AT THE SAME TIME.
---
wow discard thief never though of it ! nice
---
Overwatch devs answer.
---
&gt;How dare they give you the wrong free stuff. 
---
Trust me honey, it wasn't free. Time is money.
---
well yes. u have mountain giant, conj calling, tortollan, puzzle box, kalecgos, astromancer, twilight drake, power of creation (which u can double with tortallan), siamat, Antonidas.....  
---
and then u have zeph + brewmaster + barista for a shitton ov value again, mostly more mountain giants or multiple renos.
---
u also have messenger raven for more antonidas, kalecgos, astromancer, reno and magic trick for more conj calling.
---
ive faced like 20 warriors and lost maybe 2 or 3 times to a billion devastators but normally u beat them easy with these many threats.
---
indeed, tons of cool cards and some spicy memes, and good flavour :) good stuff
---
Last time they took aggressive steps to make Warlock better, it was oppressive. These kinds of slumps are inevitable in a card game with nine factions.
---
Yea, I agree with that. For certain matchups, I prefer to scheme zilliax that way it’s much harder for other decks to just whittle my face down
---
The less people who play Hearthstone when people naturally lose interest in the game and as more players collections fall behind from expansion to expansion.
---
The more money Activision-Blizzard needs to make from the fewer active players to maintain the companies bottom line.
---
Firstly they scrapped the two expansions and one adventure cycle in favour of three full priced expansions as well as a standard rotation but with free dungeon run content...
---
...Then more recently we have moved to the most expensive of both worlds, giving players three full priced expansions and three real money adventures in the middle of each set.
---
Every decision that has been made, has been made with the aim to slowly increase the financial burden on fewer and fewer players who are actively willing to support Hearthstone.
---
Hearthstone's original design philosophy has always been to be a 'High Profitability' product, and my guess is that as fewer people are willing to pay to play, the development team simply don't get the resources to put back into the game they'd like or have time to develop something beyond proven content that makes money from 'whales'.
---
As the first person said, the way the last set of deck slot expansions were implemented (overwriting the basic deck slots rather than just adding more) shows that something is amiss there that we don't know about but that makes it much harder to do stuff like that. Why didn't they just add more/infinite slots instead of replacing some older and defunct ones no one used? It seems likely that the answer is because, for some reason, they can't.
---
Now why it was set up like that in the first place is an interesting question, but it doesn't change that the issue still exists as a result of some poor decisions very early in the game's development and that now we all have to deal with the consequences.
---
&gt; There's a reason their subreddit never catches on fire quite like this
---
It could also have something to do with the fact that the PoE subreddit has 1/4 the subs that this one has.  Quadrouple the number of people over there and watch the number of complaint threads go up.
---
&gt; For me it looks quite lively 
---
not to mention, WoW *keeps printing* subscription money for Blizzard every single month, in a field where most of its competitors use a "free to play, pay for perks" model
---
Sorry, I was actually a bit wrong. It wasn't Blizzard buying out from Activision, it was Activision-Blizzard trying to buyout from Vivendi. There was an injuction but that actually got lifted and it went through. Sorry, this was 6 years ago, memory is hazy.
---
I mean a number of actual magic players I know use this lie on their partner/themself to justify the absurd money they spend
---
Ok. So you're not addressing what I'm saying at all, and are just dancing around it. 
---
Let me be more direct: CCGS are designed in a predatory way to require extremely large amounts of money spent in order to get a full (or close to full) collection. 
---
Its nice that a "player's game identity is his collection" but no fucking player would choose to have a smaller collection for the sake of their identity. 
---
Moreover, CCGS are designed this way *from a monetary standpoint*, not a gameplay design. There is no balancing reasons or ect. for why people should have incomplete collections, its purely to incentivize more spending
---
You keep reiterating that its "designed this way designed this way" and not addressing my claim that its bad fucking design
---
So maybe slow down the pace of adding expansions, hell, go back to the old 2 expansion 1 adventure a year, then spend the extra time to add the missing features
---
Exactly. That was a feature they announced and then cancelled - and the response was (understandably) very negative. I'm positive they do not want to repeat that, so they are avoiding announcing things they're not dead sure about.
---
I don’t think it’s possible for this to post to scream “this is satire,” any louder.
---
read: i'm only happy if i'm actively being skinner boxed.
---
Its the reason i quit playing chess, there was no loot box reward after winning the game. they expect me to just play it because its fun? screw that.

Magic players invented EDH (Elder Drangon Highlander) later changed to Commander. I also don't know if that was the first occurrence.
---
HI QUICK QUESTION, WHY YOU ALWAYS LYING WHEN YOU SAY, "SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST" WHEN THERE ARE AT LEAST TEN MORE OMEGA DEVASTATORS SHOWING UP BEHIND YOU?
---
You'd think they'd just concede when you shuffle in 10 Tess's, but they apparently love to experience the whole soul-crushing defeat of slowly running out of removal while you drop a full board every turn.
---
Lol you crack me up
---
I see what you're saying and you're right but I believe people are in a sort of crisis state atm. It's no longer just... some guy that emailed brode in 2019 about hearthstone, it's a pretty public and united outcry. Because of this, and because the devs actually do lurk around here and reply to haha wacky funny/positive comments, the ones that desire feedback feel deliberately ignored. And they'd be right. And that sucks.
---
They don't have to have something planned. If nothing's on the menu just be transparent and tell us just that. Then the outcry would stop.
---
That justifies one shitty expansion, but not two in a row.
---
I tell u something lil kid, i got high rank with 1K budget dust deck, whats ur rank tell me plz
---
it says "This is literally just a graph proving people had to google your dumbass to figure out who you are"
---
then a Twitter link for someone named Jacob A. Wohl
---
To us, Skull is always high priority, yes.
---
To Zephyrs, it's a zero attack weapon with no guarantee to summon anything since he can't took at hands.
---
Cool
---
I'm sure they would never say this because it would be kind of callous and dismissive, but us being "frothy mad" isn't really relevant if we all still keep playing/paying.  I doubt many people are going to quit permanently exclusively because of a lack of extra deck slots or tournament mode, nor do I think that adding those features would draw many people who got bored with the game in general back.
---
Honestly it seems like nobody is going to be happy unless they practically hand over controls to us.  Let's say they did announce they are going to make tournament mode.  There would be countless threads arguing about how it should be done, and once they settle on a final form a lot of people are going to be disappointed.  Player input is important and they do acknowledge ours as mentioned in other comments, but it is and should remain only a small part of the overall decision making process.
---
Play wild. Play casual with friends. Play solo content. Play arena. Yeah there are expensive ways to play (wanting to own expensive standard meta decks on day 1) but there are also cheap ways.
---
WE CANT HEAR YOU
---
I'M WORKING ON A BOT FOR IT NOW, I'LL HIT YOU UP WHEN IT'S FINISHED.
---
No, I’m not saying you can’t complain, I’m saying that the way everyone is doing it is wrong. People keep saying that “we’ve seen nothing for years,” and it’s just not true. I’m okay with civilized discussion, but when people start spreading falsehoods and become toxic, that’s when I have a problem.
---
Or maybe the great majority of ppl didn't start complaining 5 years ago or growing a distaste for the game but actually only started to do so recently?
---
I have been a long time player, since pre-WotoG, and I have invested money in this game. Then, in the early Witchwood days I decided I don't enjoy the game enough to warrant playing it, and so I took a break. I recently came back to a game which is in, imo, an even worse state than when I left which made me sad. Because I want to enjoy this game.
---
How is this worse than not being able to play anything because the meta changed and invalidated your deck? This way you have a solid deck for climbing/winning games and you can start building more decks.
---
GOT THE WARLOCK QUEST AND OPENED THE HUNTER QUEST, TOO INSECURE TO CRAFT A DECK YET SO I PLAYED SOME ARENA BUT GOD DAMN I HATE FUCKING MAGES AND EVERYTIME THEY CAST A SECRET I JUST WANT TO CONCEDE AND RETIRE THE DECK
---
pay to have fun.
---
Imagine jumping on a bandwagon of hate because you think it will earn you internet points. Just imagine.
---
Imagine someone who sees hate, and then says, "I'll fake hate, because this sub is so gullible they'll upvote anything negative about Warrior!"
---
Imagine fueling hate because it's profitable. Not even real-life profitable. Fake points profitable.
---
Now go to Twitch and tell me how many top streamers in top legend ranks are playing Warrior.
---
Oh, it's none? It's all Highlander Mage/Hunter? 
---
"lmao"
---
dr boom still needs cards like assembly and elysiana to feel overpowering and able to fatigue everything.
---
Rexxar did quite literally everything by himself and was a large reason as to why dr boom was not a top tier deck while he and the other DKs were in standard.
---
SHAMAN HAS A LOT OF BOARD CLEARS, YOU ARE BAD FOR NOT RUNNING ONE, OR UNLUCKY FOR RUNNING ONE AND NOT DRAWING IT.
---
No I'm not tired of control warriors crushing me. What I AM tired of is running into you Hunters 70-80% of my games.
---
MtG is just on a qualitatively different timescale than most (all?) other relevant examples, predating google itself.  You can certainly pick 5-year periods within the MtG example that look a lot like the HS one (e.g. custom date range 1/1/2004 - 1/1/2009 also goes ~100 -&gt; ~25), so it's kind of navel-gazing to make some sort of sweeping prognosis about this type of thing unless you actually have genuine understanding about the causative elements behind this type of thing and not just reddit drama hot-takes.
---
Why? He's doing exactly what the shareholders want which is achieve as much short term gains as possible until the company is bled dry and the shareholders get out before that and move on to their next project to bleed dry.
---
Being a public company or having investors ruins the company because shareholders only car about short term gains because there's always another project they can move on to once the gains stop.
---
It would be kinda like a pauper or peasant queue. It would be fun but the meta would be found out eventually so I dont think the HS team would want to spend time balancing that format too. Probably would be a fun brawl tho
---
I wouldn't bring up Fortnite as a goal in terms of development speed, there's some seriously abusive things going on in the dev team over there.
---
THE DEVS ARE PEOPLE TOO I AGREE THE HATE IS JUSTIFIED BUT HATING ON THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST PASSIONATE ABOUT MAKING GAMES SUCKS. HATE ON THE GREEDY CORPORATE NOT THE PEOPLE TRYING THERE BEST TO MAKE A FUN GAME
---
&gt; Might as well scrap heroic mode
---
heaven forbid people simply play a mode simply because they have fun doing it! We have to make sure to skinner box all the things and make sure that we validate everything you do!
---
not enough people doing heroic? we need to stick a super epic reward behind it so that we can FORCE them to do it, otherwise investors might think it was a bad feature!
---
oh, wait, people are playing it even without a reward?  What are they crazy? DON'T THEY KNOW THERE ISN'T A REWARD?!?!?!?!
---
what if the devs are just poor workers and are just working for the paycheck? i find it hard to believe that its the big "evil" corporate company making the game bad and not the people who are actually working on the game.
---
*Paid* PvE. Still a big difference, but just saying.
---
Wait what? 
---
No when you dust it gives you 50% of the crafting cost back instead or the 25%
---
Big Priest doesn't need nerfs, it's a tier 2 deck.
---
Oh shit! I knew they seemed hella low. 
---
They’re almost pointless to dust commons

No one asked that question and it's not something that most people here are concerned about so your above point is moot.
---
[deleted]
---
To the last part of your message: it’s possible that in this sub you have people with different opinions. I think it’s possible that these popular opinions exist at the same time
---
For starters, reducing the amount of hyperbole and vitriol in the complaints. It doesn't do anyone any good when legitimate complaints are drowned out by people who are clearly exaggerating or being just plain abusive to devs.
---
Second, people need to stop spending money on a product they'll be dissatisfied with. Every single expansion, there are dozens of threads in this sub alone from old players and new complaining about how how "few" legendaries they got from their preorders. When told they got the average expected amount (or even slightly above average) they complain that the average isn't good enough even though the tiniest bit of research can reveal that information for them before they buy.
---
Finally, people need to just stop playing the game or at least engaging at all. Every expansion, there are people calling for a boycott for one reason or another, but they never work because no one wants to be left behind. Just like other card games, Blizzard accounts for the fact that people naturally end up taking breaks from card games, often multiple times while returning in between. They're likely aware of what Magic's lead designer Mark Rosewater has said for years about reactions to content, that it's better to get a split between low and high reactions than it is to get mostly above average reactions. Blizzard needs to see players simply not care anymore before they start trying to actively cater toward the specific demands of a vocal minority.
---
Instead, people come here every day to talk about Hearthstone. And it sounds like most of them are still playing the game and have passionate opinions about it. Yeah, that can blow up in their face if they *really* screw things up, but it's often far better to have a passionate fanbase with some negative opinions than it is to have a generally lukewarm fanbase.
---
So between calmly and accurately articulating legitimate problems with the game and practicing some discipline when it comes to spending time and money on a game you're unhappy with, I think players who are currently dissatisfied with the game have the tools they need to ultimately see some change. They're just doing a terrible job of using those tools.
---
True, magic really has very little resale value because by the time you don't want a card nobody else wants that card either. Nobody is selling their cards at the height of their popularity except people that are playing the trading game instead of the magic game.
---
Nothing will change even if you stop buying because that doesn't benefit the shareholders. Shareholders couldn't give two shits about the long term health of a company all they care about is short term gains. They just bleed a company dry and move on with all the money they made to a new project they can bleed dry.
---
I'll give it a shot. Sounds fun.
---
It's laughable to think devs even decide on the features. What makes the most money is usually what is implemented.
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/control-archaeology-warlock-saviors-of-uldum-regiskillbin/
---
This is the list. By no means am i saying its a metabreaker, just that it is a solid control deck that isnt seeing play because CW simply does everything this deck aims to do, better, and that in a world where CW gets knocked down a few pegs, this may have its time in the sun.
---
If he compensate people for this, they need to compensate for the people who missed out on 4 weeks of coins during SOE.
---
If you didn’t know most iPads and iPhone 6 and under (maybe 7 too) would crash on start up, Following the update from SOE, which didn’t get fixed until the launch of SOE. It left 100s if not 1000s of players unable to play the game to the lead up to the new expansion, meaning that players missed or on at least 1000-2000 packs. 
---
Not to mention the players could participate in tavern brawls, arenas, and all the things players typically do to save up for a new expansion. 
---
So my point is if they happen to compensate the 1000s of users effected by this daily quest glitch they NEED to compensate the people who were also effected during the SOE release update. 
---
P.s. this is extremely unlikely to happen.
---
Quest rouge had a &lt;50% winrate. A deck doesnt have to be tier 1 to be nerfed.
---
I have found with gamers this is often untrue.
---
Just rework the tokens. Still 2/1s but maybe they deathrattle flame jugglers battlecry? Or mini Thaurissan? Its not hard at all and would hit the meta.
---
Yeah fake numbers are usually more shocking.
---
I wonder why are the devs that should give a response. Wizards probably has a bunch of project managers, those are the guys that should issue response to critics.
---
If blizzard gives compensation that is less incentive for players to buy packs though so I doubt youll see anything!
---
But it was still tier 1... That's the point.  Big priest is simply not overpowered, and a lot of people play it because it's fun for the Timmys.
---
People are on their third? I never even got the second...
---
DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK DRAW 1 GAIN FIVE ARMOR AND DO FIVE OR MORE DAMAGE TO A MINION FOR FOUR MANA IS OK?!
---
https://i.imgur.com/c4jt321.png

THAT WAS ALSO THE FIRST DECK I DECIDED TO CRAFT AS WELL. IT'S BORING TO WAIT TWO WEEKS TO MAKE NEW DECKS. IT WAS REALLY GOOD THE FIRST DAY I CRAFTED IT, BUT IT'S BEEN MEDIOCRE SINCE.
---
WHAT PASSION? THE PASSION DIED WHEN THE BRODE LEFT. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE LEFT IS JUST CONTENT WITH PUMPING OUT NEW CARDS AND GIVING PR NONSTATEMENTS. IF THEY WERE PASSIONATE, THEY'D ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING ELSE. AT THIS POINT THEY'RE COMPLICIT IN ACTIVI$IONBLI$$ARD'S GREED.
---
“Everything’s fine” - rabid fanboys who drop 300 dollars an expansion, usually replying to someone who opened 16 of the same epic and got 3 trash tier legendaries and isn’t happy with the game.
---
This incentivizes people not to play wild even more, not to mention no one would dust anything before rotation which would feel really bad if you ever wanted dust pronto. But who are we kidding here, this is an implausible and useless suggestion because blizzard would lose money.
---
I know if I worked for a company I'd make sure to respond to every random person that asked negative questions in dedicated forums. I'd say things like, "Yeah, you're right we suck you should probably play a different game," or "Go spend your money elsewhere." Stuff like that. I'd scour the internet for people who were not happy and respond to them. I'm a man of the people though. Those blizzard employees aren't allowed to tell people off. It's horrible if you ask me.
---
Well maybe we should look at the cards that enable conj first like galaxy, giants befor rushing things because in my opinion conj might be strong with a board but when there is no stuff to cheat out there is no problem with conj. 
---
Everyone is complaining that mage can make two 7/8 taunts turn 5 but most of the time ppl forget that it requires 3 cards to do it and pass almost all 5 turns + if there is no minions to cheat out summoning two 2-3 mana minions turn 5 seems legit to me and even if u look at turn 10 for a full conj combo with khad, it would be 1 turn of 1x 2drop and 4x random 5drops which most classes by turn 10 can handle.
---
Linecracker druid has finally killed my desire to play in the Wild format. Barnes Priest got close, really really close, but this is the final straw finally pushes me away from Wild. 
---
RIP secret mage, I loved you so much.
---
What?? There are more than one quest? You just made me realize I'm affected by the bug. I had no idea. Ugh.
---
i remember someone saying it was because his fans kept posting the same clips multiple times.  its not really his fault but oh well?
---
Yeah but it's as slow as Shadowboxer except the animation is perhaps a little bit faster.
---
Zeyphers is a dumbass and likely didn’t count the oracles buff but you probably would of gotten dispel if  u did
---
The dusting system might suck, but that's no reason to devalue the entire Wild format.
---
But even when you search for mana ans you search among 3 drops.
---
There a shitton of 3 drops because Blizzard has a fetish for 3 drop. And because they're so easy to design 3 drops, they make even a shitton of bad 3 drops. Scrolling through all of them is too many pages and maybe you miss out the good ones because you're always distracted by the horrid ones.
---
Just like when there's a precious information on a article sandwiched among 2 annoying ads. Your first reaction is to look away, not to look more into it.
---
Blizzard's stance on reward structure is unimportant fluff?
---
That's what made me stop taking this game seriously and only quest logging, the game just became boring when you open 80-100 packs and get a fraction of the expansions cards meaning you could only play a few competitive decks. Just so many other better games you could play for the money/time investment.

ISN'T IT WONDERFUL THAT DEVS HAVE SUCH A STIFF HARD ON FOR MAGE AND HUNTER THAT THEY CAN THROW 30 RANDOM CARDS IN A DECK AND IT'LL BE GOOD, WHILE PRIEST HAS TO REHASH THE 357TH VARIATION OF DIVINE SPIRIT/INNER FIRE?

---
THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED
---
I don’t disagree with you, I actually made a post a while back about how everyone focuses on Boom and Eternium Rover goes unchecked.
---
Free hero powers on a premium stat 1 drop. Not even if it survives damage, but when it takes damage. And tribal synergy.
---
But first things first imo. 
---
My biggest point is that nerfing Boom would really d nothing in the way of refreshing the meta. 
---
Like you said, the class has enough support to do just fine w a nerfed Boom.
---
Without a HOF, CW still reigns as the best Warrior archetype and nothing really changes with Standard.
---
I started during TGT. The first Legendary I opened was Sky Cap'n Kragg, a huge downer. Do you know what a bigger downer is? Yeah, a second one like 20 packs later. The only two legendaries that I opened from that set.
---
I still have one of them.
---
Sounds like you made 2 hunter decks and didn't have enough dust to finish your Pharoas deck.
---
I've tried picking Pyroblast everytime it shows up, and it always hits face! (mine)
---
U = Blue
---
Play wild, much more f2p friendly :)
---
Rogue doesn't have good large scale removal, since the class isn't meant for control.
---
Still, if you absolutely want something against Nomi boards, your options are:
---
1. \[\[Deathwing\]\]
---
2. \[\[Malygos\]\] + \[\[preparation\]\] + \[\[fan of knives\]\]
---
3. Big weapon + \[\[Blade Flurry\]\]
---
You should note that all of these combinations are awful, and you probably don't want them in your deck. In reality, if you can't kill the opponent as rogue the turn they drop Nomi, you just lost.
---
What does prep mean?
---
Wtf is that bullshit supposed to mean. What if he does not have enough dust to craft a 10k deck. Why not craft a legendary and having fun playing it in whatever deck.
---
Being a person who does development work. It is honestly pretty rare talking to them is useful in a real sense. Everyone has their own silver bullet which normally can't be implemented for one reason or another. And devs should really be focused on whatever task they have at hand. It is the community managers and middle managers job to sort out public opinion and translate that into feature requests.
---
That being said I do share the communities frustration over the fact that we have not had tournament mode or any major update outside of new card since tavern brawl. I appreciate all the new events but it does feel a bit like they have been resting on there laurels for a while. IMO I think the biggest issue is there still has not been a game that really competes against Hearthstone, which I believe is causing Blizzard to have a real aversion to risk. What we really need is some healthy competition outside of MtgA.
---
THIS, SO MUCH

busby#1153, NA.  Trading 80g quest.  We show and you go first.

That's not a good combo though... it just added cards back to your hand that should have already been there and increased their cost by a substantial amount... You would much rather have drawn minions with BoS and just played a vanilla 6 mana 6/6.
---
see Larson343 above.
---
The problem was that since expansion, many people who carried 2 regular quests did not get a third regular quest.  This is not about not receiving legendary/chain quests.
---
The absolute mad lad

I got whatever that dumbass 8/8 that gives all your enemies reborn 4 times.  I only got 1 other epic.

That 50 pack pre purchase a joke lmao, here pay for a full price game and we'll give you 5% of the expansions cards to play with enjoy. I stopped spending on this game a long time ago when they were charging the same price for a triple A title to give you a few ~~lootboxes~~ cardpacks.
---
I'd be interested to know why the quest priest chose to not combo pyro with a heal or why he chose to not heal your minions.

Seems like they just played poorly so you won.

This is what i was waiting for

IVE GOTTEN AT LEAST  ONE FISHFLINGER IN EVERY PACK IVE OPENED, ALL  12 OF THEM.
---
I think we are done with the meta settling thing, balance changes are probably coming soon, then another exp. The times when they made balance changes twice a year are over.
---
It's a really easy deck to beat though, just tech in a skulking geist and boom, you win. I've not lost a game against linecracker since I teched in a geist. It's really useful against jade druid and cyclone mage too.
---
i opened 100 packs, and only got 4 leggos + the freebie. However, they were all playable. So that was a nice change. If they had been trash, I would have ragequit
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
Just ignore u/Sn1p-SN4p, he's very clearly a Blizzard troll who believes that the Hearthstone team can do nothing wrong. They're our gods and should only be revered, and he'll only bring out strawmen arguments to counter anyone's valid/realistic points.
---
[[Preparation]]
---
Sorry but they're completely right about the state of the game. Complaints won't be stopped until Blizzard fucking reacts the way it should have done ages ago
---
Yugioh uses archetypes when designing cards, meaning each set will feature 5-10 independent archetypes which all work with each other. So you could really combine them like that. 
---
They also ban cards in order to push new cards, which destroys the meta, and print absolutely broken cards each set in order to push new sets. And because they have no rotation, they have to incentivize people away from older cards. 
---
Don’t use Yugioh as an good example of how to handle a TCG. That game is losing players fast. Most people still playing it have played it for 10+ years, or have just started. It can’t keep new players attracted.
---
*weep*
---
Same.
---
I wish I could just “have fun” with decks. I used to, but I’ve simply played the game for too long. I’ve seen through the veil, so to speak. I can never just think “Oh, Big Octopus, that’s cool!!!” upon playing Octosari. I would just be very aware that it’s not efficient for the deck. It’s become much more a matter of numbers for me. Navigating the meta, turning off the game audio when I play so I don’t hear the wacky voiceover work. I get a very unnecessary and irrational need to reach Legend every single month, despite not really having a “reason” to. 
---
I suspect the mindset I have is likely shared among a good portion of the people on this Subreddit. I suspect it might have *something* to do with the influx of complaints. We’ve simply played too long. Seen behind the veil. We’re no longer charmed by the simple design of something that was never meant to be much more than a goofy smartphone game for when you’re on the toilet.

I wonder if I could ever relearn your rank 20 ideal of just using stuff because it’s “fun”, and realizing that there’s literally no point in laddering. Why focus on anything other than literally **just** the single game that’s currently happening?
---
I’ll probably never get there again.

I CANT WAIT FOR WARRIOR TO GET NERFED SO THE ENTIRE LADDER CAN BE MURLOC PALLY VS MIDRANGE HUNTER

WHO LIKES TO PLAY MORE THAN 6 TURNS RIGHT
---
wtf that was really well said.
---
No, cause then people would complain that there is no motivation to log in.
---
FUCK YOU TEAM 5 FOR PLAYING FAVORITES AND NOT MAKING 9 PLAYABLE CLASSES
---
Why not?  They make a lot of money, and the Hearthstone players who are still playing will basically take any sort of abuse and still play, so it would be dumb of them not to do something like this.
---
Now I'm pissed. Guess I missed it too. I didn't even know/ have a clue. Great job hearthstone team. What the hell is this shit? Shouldn't this have been dog food tested out before release?
---
Amen brother 🙏
---
Town crier is even crazier than rover, and warrior gets to run both, and then frightened flunky now. No boom doesn't change the fact that board based strategies cannot contest warrior with or without boom. Even with a HOF, CW remains the best archetype if nothing else is touched.
---
Nice try dev alt account
---
&gt;  (or in a winning position and don’t mind throwing the game for some fireworks) 
---
Did that, lost, no regrets. It was funny as hell.
---
Yes thousands of ideas and Blizzard incapable of developping a single one.
---
They can't please everyone but currently they're pleasing almost noone.
---
Ah yes, you prove my point... the needless jab (which by the way does nothing to address my comment) at Blizzard.  You feel the need, even though it isn't applicable, to attack blizzard.
---
AT LEAST BREAK OR USE UP THE ARMOR YOU ARE BASHING WITH
---
Haha, what are you even talking about. None of this makes any sense.
---
&gt; I can't even find actual content about this game the last 2 days.
---
Like there's any content to make about this game in its current state.
---
Unsubscribe.
---
Oh, for sure Jaina = U
---
This is why I only play 3 classes. 
---
Cabal FTW.
---
Ah, oofs on me then
---
That is correct. When i got the first Ra, i had 3 cards left (add 14-15 Mogu Cultis and 8-9 Ra).

They were ready to tell us about it but since players don't really want that mode they are going to go with permanent randomonium instead.
---
Said another way, if the customer imagines there is a problem then the company has a real problem.

why cant we have blitz mode? very easy to implement and lots of people would enjoy it.  Its no surprise HS is dying

LUNA'S POCKET GALAXY SHOULDN'T EXIST AT ANY MANA COST IT PROVIDES UNFAIR AND UNFUN GAMES FOR ANY SLOW/MIDRANGE DECKS
---
So what are the safe-to-craft legendaries for SoU?   I’m deciding between Shaman Quest, Druid Quest or Siamat in roughly that order of preference.
---
IDK, THIS MURLOC PALADIN IS THE ULTIMATE CANCER, WITH CLOSE SECOND BEING RANDOM MAGE AND BATTLECRY SHAMAN.
---
BUT YES, NO LOVE FOR MY BELOVED ANDUIN. GUESS DIVINE SPIRIT/INNER FIRE IT IS. :(
---
The only option I had there was to sign up for a new account. BUT, you're a real lifesaver, because for some reason creating an account from *that specific menu* worked (didn't load forever), whereas trying to do it from any of the other 14 places you can do it from didn't. So, thank you. I have it all sorted out now.
---
It's a complex card to say the least. I'm sure they'll keep updating it til it's working the best it can, as they've already done. Zephrys is a gift from the hearthstone dev team that I'll always be grateful for even if it doesn't give me the card I want.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk

Trojan horses are real.
---
You can use the same decks as constructed. But once you have a decent deck, you can go infinite way more consistently then arena.
---
0 mana with prep sounds nasty
---
RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.

I CLEARED HIS BOARD TWICE AFTER 2X TIP THE SCALES BEFORE HE COULD ATTACK ME. STILL LOST TO 10 FACE DMG OF JENKINS+TRUESILVER.

It's called PR. You represent a company if you speak as a dev, and as a normal dev you aren't qualified for such a task. Not that they aren't smart or don't know what they're talking about or anything like that, but decisions of how to represent the company, and update strategies, fuck ups, approach to missing features etc. are usually decided by multiple people after quite a long process of decision making and strategizing.
---
Just googled this. Thank you!
---
&gt; Especially when the decks in wild can cost crazy amounts.
---
Wild decks aren't super expensive. They remain pretty static from year to year with only a few new cards being introduced having a high enough power level and the correct synergy to replace old cards.
---
In standard if there's a rotation, BAM, whole decks worth of cards need to be replaced with new cards to work again.
---
[citation needed]?  I've played around 10 games against control warrior as quest paladin and haven't lost 1.
---
Imagine reaching turn 8 without already having cast Pocket Galaxy.
---
We don't hate it, that is why we are complaining. If we hated it we would have long ago moved to Fortnite or League or whatever. Now fix the problems please Blizzard.
---
Well, I cleared all my data on the phone to test it a bit. 
---
I have the login button in my menu at all times. However, when logging in, it asks if I want to check Google Drive if I have a save there, and accepting freezes the game in eternal load. However, just saying no and logging in works fine.
---
So, first off, have you given the app access to your google account? Does it ask for it when trying to sign in? If yes, try denying. If it doesn't ask for it anymore, I think you can remove the access from app settings.
---
Now, I know it sucks to lose progress, but you can plow through the tutorial in about an hour (I've done it several times). So you could just create an account on pc, clear the tutorial and then just login on your phone.
---
I think some of the decks aren't ridiculous in terms of dust, but holy hell is Warrior, Mage, and Hunter super expensive right now. It's really just any deck that's easily over 10k dust that is just stupidly over costed.
---
Until it pulls out colossus of the moon (rare but happens)
---
Only poor people can't afford the 22 000 dust for Reno Mage.

You can try changing the name server on your router.  Described [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Block-Ads-With-Your-Router-Using-Ad-blocking-DNS-S/)
---
Whatever the hell you did sounds BIZARRE. It never mentioned anything about Google to me, and I've never connected any kind of Google or Drive account to the app.
---
But also, thank you so much for taking time out of your day to help me. I just got it figured out, for some reason signing up/logging in through the settings cog (which someone else directed me to) works fine, even through every single one of the 14 other places you can sign up from just result in an eternal loading screen. So yeah, I have an account now. Thanks for being so generous. You seem like a good person.
---
I do sometimes. Mainly while I’m on break at work. It’s just something quick to kill some time.
---
&gt; Example of Daily Reward Structure:
---
&gt; &lt;details a structure that goes to 15 wins, still provides enough gold to buy 1 pack per day, front-loads most gold rewards, then alternates between random cards &amp; small amounts of gold&gt;
---
u/Perfectwall , you been playing lots of MTG Arena or what?  O:-)
---
Ok but saying the game is dead because it has less Twitch views is stupid
---
I MEAN MAGE SUFFERED A LOT FOR THIS META... BUT I UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE LOSING TO RANDOM EFFECTS SO MUCH... BRING BACK INTERACTIVE CONTROL DECKS...
---
Orrrr... now hear me out. How about Zephrys always gives [Conjurer’s Calling]
---
lol, constructive criticism isn't bad, but excessive negativity is pushing me away from the game more than anything.
---
You lost the game, but gained massive respect.
---
You’ll never remember a single win, but you’ll remember the 4 Puzzle Box turn forever.
---
The resource problem could be fixed with counter and discard. How they implement those would be key though.
---
3/2 for 2 : Each player discards their highest cost card.
---
2/3 for 2: If this is in your deck and your opponent plays a 10 mana card, counter it and give them this instead.
---
Yesterday I played against 6 (yep, 6) frightened flunky in a game. The guy coin 1 on first turn, dropped on 2. Later the game he dropped 4 on turn 8. And he got the armagedillo from it twice.
---
With 72 legendaries a year, we should get at least half the dust for disenchanting. 1/4 was ok before that legendary cards storm.
---
Agreed. I'm glad Kibler isn't on the design team. HoF Mountain Giants? Even though they're already not seeing as much play in favor of Big Mage and Highlander Mage? Lol. 
---
A slight nerf to Pocket Galaxy is probably all I'd do. Raising the cost to 6 sounds good enough to me considering no Mage deck is tier 1 ATM. 
---
Warrior is definitely the deck we need to bring the hammer down on, considering it is the undisputed strongest deck and is blocking entire archetypes from existing.
---
I hear you.  I guess I’m just extremely cynical in this case, and I have a decade in Product leadership experience (the folks that would build a roadmap, approve making it public).  It really sounds like they are just grinding all the money they can out of the existing base, so would never reveal their plans (or lack thereof).
---
I’m not always negative, just case by case.  I was also very down on Fallout 76, for example.  That was correct.  Hopefully this is incorrect, but as a priest+standard player I feel like they are just trolling at this point.
---
The Cabal Classes. 
---
Mage, Priest, Warlock.
---
You’re missing 26 epics?!! There’s around 27 epics, did you get the same epic all the time?
---
Yes please!
---
&gt;The balance here is horribly shifted in favor of players that have been playing for longer or can afford to spend more on packs.
---
So? No one's forcing them to enter.
---
Yes game, I DO want ANOTHER desert obilisk and not Anubisath Defender or Crystal Merchant. It's not like Obilisk is just a less fun version of Mogu Cultist!
---
control warrior players are not human
---
I've played tons of Spell Hunter during RoS using Maly and Jepetto together. It most definitely would go well!
---
Call him a toast then, they are basically the same kind of streamer
---
50% is the standard value in card games.
---
it surprised me to see that. but I think this is a situational deck with very polarized matchups. against murlocs or similar board flood strategies, sure it's decent. but against control warrior or midrange decks that intend to control the board with moderate plays, it can struggle. decks will adjust with silence and transform effects if necessary, but a good midrange strategy should beat it easily.
---
Nah the bigger downer is 5 consecutive Bolf Ramshields
---
I sometimes wonder how devs have so much patience. Just look at r/fortniteBR, devs are really active in terms of their responses but some of these people they answer to are complete man children, or maybe just children.
---
The same goes for the HS subreddit only that instead of actual children there are man children.
---
Welcome bundle is probably the best bundle out there you can buy. Good for starting players, cause they get a dragon legendary (Ysera or alexstraza if they are lucky) and a guaranteed legendary from first 10 packs.
---
Still, you can't argue that a lot of answers from them are really non-answers.
---
Agreed.  I have the taunt warrior deck but don’t play it because the mirrors are a waste of life.  Instead I’m playing combo priest meme deck because at least it’s a fun surprise to win.
---
if blizzard don't announce something substantial at blizzcon, like replays, tournament mode, literally anything other than an expansion and a dungeon i don't think i'll be playing. that's what i think.
---
Brawliseum needs to be a permanent mode. I stopped putting money into the game because it's not (serious)
---
I started playing MTG:A just before RoS was released. I discovered that it had a *permanent* Brawliseum mode and I was hooked. I'm primarily a Constructed player and I want to be able to compete for prizes outside of drafting. When RoS was relesed, I was incredibly disappointed to see Brawliseum only last a few days and I vowed to make MTG Arena my primary game after that.
---
Please, Blizzard, make it permanent. Us Constructed players need the equivalent of Arena. The ranked ladder is a waste of time and it's not fair that those of us who enjoy Constructed can only play Brawliseum once every 4 months.
---
Curious you chose novice to compare instead of similarly powered cards like mana worm or cleric or sludge slurper (two of which arent going to rotate out like rover will)
---
Yes
---
HI IM DRUID QUEST I HAVE 0 DOWNSIDE AND IM ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY COMPLETED FOLLOWED UP BY 2 5/5s WITH RUSH AND A SPELL THAT HEALS FOR 12 AND SUMMONS A 6/6 WITH TAUNT AND THEN A WHOLE LOT OF BM BECAUSE DRUID PLAYERS ARE UNIVERSALLY COCKS
