Dragonqueen Alexstrasza needs to be changed so it can't add itself to your hand. When you get that it's just endgame
---
Do it.
---
Well, I found the dumbest post in this thread already. You have no idea how zoo is supposed to be played but yet come to complain about it. Congrats
---
I literally put the justification in the original text.
---
You know I was exaggerating but while the T5 OTK was possible (double Project + Wild Growth is enough to get you to 10 mana by T5), T7 OTK's were common. I know Aligner wasn't the best deck at the time but it was the most polarizing bs in the meta, worse for control decks than Big Priest ever was.
---
I very much agree on your stance about Aviana, I miss playing combo druids. But with Psychmelons strength in drawing your entire wincon, Tog Druid would be overpowered even if Melon's mana cost were higher. That card is some awful design. 
---
Rat might also be bad, but it's the only real tech against combo that we got and while I hate running it in Reno decks I have a hard time hating the card itself.
---

---
The thing about deathrattle rogue and similar decks is that once more people realize it‚Äôs too rng and draw dependent it will be filtered out. It‚Äôs popular now because of the shiny promise of a high win rate, but when people see that that‚Äôs not consistent it‚Äôll dwindle, and i‚Äôd argue that that‚Äôs already begun.
---
You mean those decks people where whiny about and calling unbalanced when they were in the meta?
---
Decklist?
---
Highlander Mage is quite good and Cyclone Mage has seen success in the hands of better players
---
&gt; What the fuck are you on about?  
---
[Look here](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/310/quest-resurrect-priest#tab=matchups) maybe you need premium but maybe don't use anecdotal results to make conclusions.
---
Mage has done pretty well IMO. It's just higher skill cap
---
&gt;?
---
look again
---
the minion on the right
---
how can Raffam have it?
---
because Curator did  it.
---
Yeah, you pretty much suffer the really bad invoke package in this deck just so you can play Fateweaver to activate your combo.  It's sad how bad it feels to play these cards compared to every other Galakrond class, where even if your invoke isn't super sexy, it's at least reliably doing something. 
---
I'd say most gala priest games I play, the invoke does nothing to contribute to the win.  Hell, it's often even a negative when it's clogging my hand up with crap I'm never going to have time to play.  Feels like they really dropped the ball on this one.
---
This is the new official slogan
---
i havent heard anything sync perfectly :/
---
I'm trying to get warlock right now, I figure 5 ranked wins a day I should get 1000 wins in about 8 months........ :p
---
If you happen to be playing on mobile, restart the game, it sometimes duplicates all cards in your collection so it shows 2 golden cards when you actually only have 1. Happened to me like 2 weeks ago, was so frustrating!
---
‚ÄúIdk what u guys saying mage is bad ive been playing this homebrew garbage and im on a 11 game winstreak shitting on aggro warrior and face hunter lol‚Äù
---
It'd be nice if it would offer silence more reliably too.  If Rogue plays Apothecary on 4 and I play Zeph the turn after, that should be a counter, but it isn't because Zeph doesn't care about Apothecary at all. And if it would prioritize buffing lifesteal minions over giving raw healing I'd like that too.
---
whats your tag I love to see your decks
---
Deathwing is basically an emergency board clear. Can handle the two 8/8's from Shaman Galakrond, for instance.
---
Not alone! I do have to say I like figuring out what's to out aggro aggro decks. Mostly because of how short those games are. Long games that are annoying are annoying.
---
‚ÄúThijs took this list from Legend 2000 to Legend 1990, why can‚Äôt you?!‚Äù

He's trying to farm karma by making people go "OMG LOL XD THE EYES ARE COVERED I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE OP YOU ARE SO SMART. UPVOTED!!!"
---
I almost never send friend invites to others, but i always accept them. It's a win win, either i get flamed by the kind of person who unironicaly flames random people (aka waste of skin), and those kind of people are way to fun to mess with, or it's a normal human being who wants to chat a bit about the game.
---
Your game crashed. It‚Äôs known as a ghost or soft disconnect, restarting will fix it.
---
Question is, is there a gold version of Jeff Goldblum?
---
magic also doesn't limit the effect to a one-of in a reno deck. and instead of any i would definitely limit it to standard cards if you're in standard.
---
SoU quests and hero cards have inherent anti synergy.
---
What's that mid to see the ratings?
---
Really similar to mine, thanks! Just a quick question, why do you hav the MCtech in the defk?

Mine just stops responding and I have to force close then relaunch it.

&gt;But it was nice of you to read the post and be a stereotype anyway. 
---
 
---
&gt;I‚Äôm waiting for the pedants to show up and tell me that exactly one Mage list has a 51% win rate and therefore all of Mage is tier one.  
---
Woosh.  
---
You're far too serious for this children's game.
---
Blackrock, because you get access to some key legends like thaurissan, but also some duds
---
Should be easy then.  The cheapest is like 2K dust so you wouldn't really need a kill a deck to run it.
---
‚ÄúI approve of this insanity.‚Äù
---
Galakrond in general is rather poopy. I don‚Äôt bother with it any more
---
Ah. Shamanstone as its best.
---
In wild you can shuffle your invoked galakrond back into your deck with dead mans hand and it works the same way wgen you play dragonhoof
---
League first. Then when you're looking for your next wild adventure get naxx. Remember we're getting a 35 card adventure next month
---
When you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, everything looks the same.
---
Please be more greedy, I‚Äôm playing control warrior, the mages seem have every single late value card in the game.
---
I beat a salty mech pally with some dmh yogg warrior rank 6 easier. Definitely beatable.
---
Nice
---
Warriors have armor gain to outlast the aggro and face decks. Mages have none of that.
---
Good players adapt to the meta.
---
Born losers quit.
---
Understand the difference?
---
plenty of decks beat ress priest actually.. holy wrath paladin, token druid, OTK rogue, and pretty much every highlander deck is favored vs rez priest
---
Patchwerk on hard mode
---
Is the joke that deathwing is bad? Because he's not terrible in control warrior. And why change the effect to attack your hero?
---
üê≥
---
I think you're right
---
Any card in your collection would include all expansion cards. So yes. It would be fundamentally different and completely busted.
---
Obviously, you assume the part where it only includes basic/classic but instead of discover you get to pick.
---
Warning! Disturbing content
---

Both would be pretty busted though
---
I have a similar deck but with "Devoted Maniac". Do you think its good with this deck?
---
Highlander rogue is so strong 90% winrate right now from legend 350 to 160 rank 10-1 w/r
---
Being cheaper than magic does not mean it is one of the cheapest by a long shot, and it is probably the most expensive digital card game of the scene
---
TY2002#4961 Asia Looking for someone to spectate ("Watch &amp; Learn" Quest)
---
No, the card was nerfed recently.
---
Yeah it's not an "or" statement but an "and". Pretty nice though.
---
People complain. There's posts about people complaining about the free legendaries we get. All his post was is a complain not an argument. You get more out of every other game for the same price as you do in hearthstone. You ignored what I said and twisted it around. But once again you telling people their complaints are meaningless is in fact meaningless in itself. People as a species complain it's practically in our nature. Because you say it's meaningless won't stop anyone from doing it. So the fact that you're complaining about his complain is kind of ironic isn't it?
---
What adds to the joke tho is that the Hippo here is a hunter.
---
The souls keep attacking but he doesn't play any card after he equips the weapon and you steal it.
---
Once they are dead, you just have to use all your cards and kill him with mecha'thun. I just tried and it still works.
---
I‚Äôm starting to think you‚Äôre a troll.
---
You‚Äôre not forced to keep them. You do know that you can disenchant Wild Cards?
---
So I shoudn't keep the other ones frozen as to get a triple later on? Having in mind that tokens also generate triples.
---
:\^) i love triggering white knights of blizzard! everyone is so defensive of this company for some reason lmao. okay ill be on my way now love u all :)
---
He has to be a troll. Who complains about free stuff? I mean it's up to you whether or not you want to use the free cards. They aren't bad cardw
---
so toxic much imagination wow
---
More roots
---
Most people reviewed doctor boom to be a bad card then ended up being the strongest in gvg
---
Even the "simple" counters were under 60% win rate and not the greatest in the rest of the meta.
---
After the game, Kripp still doesn't know what AFK was playing.
---
That token board is always freeze cause double triple but tbh in my experience u lose long term cause afk better tier up early and build up your board with tier2-3 + your rewards. I buy all 3 cats and the reawrd is only tier 2, i like afkbut it seems slow at endgame
---
I've done every imaginable thing to get a Silence and I've seen the same from my opponents. You probably just got a Silence for another target.
---
Thank god it was control warrior
---
Well, well, well, how the turntables.
---
We won't because it will have stealth.
---
it did remove stealth from that 2/2 that grows from naxx
---
Randomly.
---
I fail to see anything remarkable about this
---
Dunno why people are complaining about this so much. It‚Äôs not game breaking, it‚Äôs not Roguestone, it‚Äôs a meme deck that when it works it‚Äôs very hot but can easily be countered with silence or aggro
---
Because of the spellblender secret,the overkill part no longer activate,so its 5 mana do nothing
---
OH
---
No no no! YOU should play Flik now and concede to leave opponent extremely confused.
---
IIRC, they updated to where echo minions cannot go below 1 cost.
---
Yeah we're just so braindead.
---
Nah it‚Äôs basically mini odd Paladin
---
Well that's ok if that's your thing lol
---
Dear hearthstone redditors, not  every little thing they do is to make you spend money, honestly have stupid do you have to be to actually not ne able to find the update article, but then think its because they dont want you to disenchant those cards despite EVERY SINGLE CARD CHANGE BEING LISTED WHEN LOADING THE GAME, please use your brain or stop posting here already
---
[[Holy Champion]] would‚Äôve been a great card if Priest ever got a proper tempo/beat down deck.

---
4/3/5 | Whenever a character is healed, gain +2 Attack.  
---
Good and aggressive stats for a 5 mana minion which suite the tempo neutral of Rouge class, with a dragon tag to booth. Very good anti control tool for Rogue. Auto win vs  any greedy control warrior that do not run silence. Ok not in this meta but maybe in the upcoming meta
---
Noggenfogger is my favorite minion. I've had some insane arena runs with him my decks. 
---
I wish there was some viable clown fiesta wild deck centered around him but at 9 mana I can't really figure out a way to play him without getting annihilated.
---
You definitely can, if you make it to Zul‚Äôjin he ends the game immediately.
---
Havent seen it ever really
---
I did this and would have died had I not drawn Deckhand on 6.
---
This but rank 5 instead if 5
---
Now are you saying that because Jaina is a fire mage or because she's attractive?
---
Also, VanCleef
---
100% yes. Emphatically so.
---
I believe its because of the hunt secret who change target of an attack
---
i reload the app several times this bug is there for months now!
---
I took a similar deck from 5 to 2. It's not bad, as long as you don't face too many Face Hunters. I switched away and climbed to 1 with Rogue, but I am facing so many Priests now, I may switch back.
---
i've been playing highlander dragon paladin, it's quite decent
---
The goal of the F2P is not for your average player to be able to spend nothing on the game and be able to play all or even most of the decks.
---
[...alright...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zXvR_jBD8o)
---
Gl bro, going from 2 to legend is much harder than 5 to 2.
---
Do so, it's so satisfying to see them running out of board clears
---
In Standard, or Wild? I‚Äôve been using Highlander Priest in Standard since Uldum, before it was slightly more in style. I‚Äôm a legend rank player (unless it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm burned out on ladder‚Äù month) who‚Äôs halfway competent at playing and deckbuilding. If you have any questions about doing Highlander Priest in Standard I can maybe help you out. 
---
I haven‚Äôt touched Wild since the month it first launched, however. So I don‚Äôt have anything for you in that regard.
---
I hate that card in arena.
---
its not fun to play against ):
---
It's more satisfying to seem them hover over the concede button when you Hex their "I win" card.
---
Even better if you steal it with Zeph
---
Blizzard has literally stated this fact numerous times. By ‚ÄúBlizzard‚Äù I mean multiple Hearthstone developers.
---
Siamats really good and hard to replace. For now just toss in another rush minion i guess
---
How I did it:
---
Druid - Jade idol and auctioneer  
---
Hunter - spell Hunter  
---
Mage - lots of big minions, stubborn gastropod, alarm-o-bot, og Reno, and ice block. On 2 play gastropod, on 3 play alarm-o-bot. Restart if you can't do that  
---
Paladin - immortal prelate  
---
Priest - just a control deck  
---
Rogue - bunnies  
---
Shaman - 2x unstable evolution, the rest 1 drops (no overload, no can't be targeted). Get as full of a board as you can. Around 4/5 play unstable on 1 drops. If you don't get sorcerer's apprentice or radiant elemental restart  
---
Warlock - just used a Reno deck  
---
Warrior - stubborn gastropod and alarm-o-bot. Play like mage, but you don't need Reno. Plate breaker will help
---

hope it helps ! (:

???
---
The 2 mana card that massively limits how you can build your deck... also nothing you say here is relevant to the overall point that this interaction makes no sense
---
Yeah, but the majority of games you will complete quest first.
---
[deleted]
---
ez clap
---
I played face hunter before it became meta and most decks couldnt react leading to quick wins. I went like 40-21 that day
---
We should not be at the whim of blizzard's code when playing zeph. Allow us to request a card from the classic set and for us to receive it. In the long run as the game changes and this card moves to wild, there will be much less upkeep and issues.
---
Still think this? It has the highest win rate right now lol
---
I've literally been having the SAME exact glitch happen to me with the purple stuff. On MULTIPLE occasions, too! Does anyone know why this happens?
---
More importantly, is Blizzard aware of the issue? It's not really a HUGE deal and usually goes away after a couple page changes or restarting, but is still obviously a problem. =\\
---
Thanks for the info. My favourite class is priest and I prefer slower midrange/control style decks. You're probably right highlander decks as a f2p player is a dream especially since I didn't get any of the good explorers.
---
Vindico#2377 EU, will show quest then you go first
---
Well, in wild we've been complaining about Big priest for literally the entire lifespan of the format, and i've seen people defend the deck.
---
Well now you get to experience his younger brother, rez priest.
---
Rez priest would have been fine in the early life of hearthstone, or when you have a consistent combo deck that can OTK it. But when you have only control and aggro with the only combo deck being unreliable, you get a very unfun situation against priest.
---
Now more than ever we need hand disruption or graveyard interaction cards because having to deal with the same 2/6 taunt with a premium deathrattle on it is not what most people would call fun.
---
Yes. Some people love RNG, it's why cards like yogg are still played in wild by memers. Mostly it can be annoying to me, but it definitely has its place with the potential fun it can produce. I can't really speak for the standard meta cus I've only been doing wild this xpac tho so take this with a grain of salt. The only RNG in my Singleton priest deck is Galakrond and some dragon generators.
---
See, thats the problem with mechathun, he loses.
---
Idk if I would put this in my face hunter deck after that nerf. 2 turns to kill seems too slow
---
Honestly I know it can be dealt with if you want to tech a mossy, but seeing it just makes me angry for some reason. Still can‚Äôt believe it cost 5 mana at one point...
---
I know you're probably joking, but just in case:
---
Please do not play Platebreaker just to counter a deck you'll see less than 1% of the time.
---
Uphill battle, fam. Most people don't really grok the concept of what does and does not make a card strictly better than another card.
---
Sounds like your list is quite a bit different than the one I‚Äôm running.  Your list sounds like more control and top end heavy.  Mine is more mid-range strategy with a decent amount of mechs for early board contest.

nice!
---
Why not take a break? You can pause the game by pressing +.
---
that‚Äôs 8 decks, not 10 :_(
---
I mean you can literally just move the first minion back to prevent that. Having the 3/22 first is only useful if the enemy had a divine shield on their taunt so you weren't going to waste a hit from a bigger minion. But if you know your opponent has Hydra or Taunt Divines you can play around it accordingly.
---
I don't necessarily think demons is the strongest but I think it's a lot better than people give it credit for.
---
This is a hill that I'm willing to die on. The RNG is not only *not* a defect; it's a feature. It's one of the things that distinguishes the game from it's primary competitor (that being MtG) and it adds a lot of fun into the game. As much as people bitch about losing to RNG, think of all the clips that make Trolden and how many of them are driven the Hearthstone's ability to create unexpected and funny interactions. 
---
RNG isn't for everyone, and there are plenty of games out that that minimize it (MtG, as mentioned, as well as Gwent), but that doesn't mean that RNG is bad or wrong. RNG can, in fact, be extremely fun when it allows you to pull yourself out of a losing situation or when it just does something that makes you laugh. There is a reason that Yogg was such a popular card and why people still lament the fact that it got nerfed.

The jade package is better than the dragon package so jade blossom is better. Classic cards aren‚Äôt supposed to be powerful they‚Äôre meant to show the style of the class. The devs then release afew cards better than the original as a replacement, the good card then rotates out and they print a new powerful version of the original. They don‚Äôt have to making it more powerful than the card that rotated because it‚Äôs gone and is not in competition with it.
---
Kekekekekekek
---
A dragon, dragon.
---
It's because you attacked with Leeroy beforing playing Zeph. It's dumb but he doesn't realize that a minion that has already attacked can attack again if given windfury.
---
&gt; Pit Crocolisk is also that, without the overload condition, and it didn‚Äôt see play in that deck.
---
It's also 8 mana instead of 5, let's be objective. It's a good card in Aggro Overload, but it's overshadowed because of better shaman decks.
---
Jokes about flamewreathed faceless are like 4 mana 7/7 always good.
---
the art of copy-pasting a meta deck
---
What a dumb curator lol.
---
It doesn't really matter if the card is stronger or not, but power creep is a wayy over used term and usually incorrectly, as OP just proved
---
&gt; Zeph doesn't distinguish one deathrattle from another, in their eyes, all deathrattles are equal.
---
God damn liberal minions /s
---
Try 0 mana with Overload (1). Need to be able to get it out early.
---
There is always a bigger fish.
---
Yes and what a beautiful meta we got instead... it‚Äôs even worse
---
That makes sense. Because the anubisath deathrattle buffs the hand so the value of that deathrattle depends on what is in hand. Zeph doesn‚Äôt care about your own hand so what about your opponents?
---
Mage 3k

---
Oh! His golden hero portrait, but as someone said, he'll need to *win* 52 games.
---
Didn‚Äôt he make a good play though? He used his mana properly so he could have the perfect spell to use to counter the minion/ deck he was up against?
---
Instructions unclear. Put this in my elemental deck.
---
I think it's just ok in any Galakrond deck.  I've played a version that does pogo hopper and lackey shenanigans and the game goes really long often, big value battle, often goes into fatigue.  While I don't run waxadred in it directly, in several games I discover it through the dragon lackey and keep it.  It's really great having it so I don't need to worry about fatigue necessarily.
---
Poor soul...
---
not nessecarily, if you go demons it's generally a lot better to discover a t3 minion since you'll get the chance at soul juggler, floating watcher &amp; imp gang boss. t4 has Siegebreaker which is pretty bad on its own and a bunch of garbage buff/magnetic cards which are bad if you don't have something worth buffing.
---
On the other hand, Mage is in a fantastic place in Wild right now.
---
You‚Äôd get any deathrattles as permanent buffs which might help. Could probably use it with the divine shield guy to give +2/+1 and divine shield to your board. Would probably be too much with all the token generators though
---
The number of rng cards put in a deck is very low. Just because there is tutoring doesn‚Äôt change the fact that 90% of all card draw is rng. You can try and make things more consistent but no matter what you do no matter how skilled you are a large amount of games you play the winner will be determined by the rng of card draw, more games than rng cards.
---
Ill say it one more time, that is not what power creep means
---
I can see this being easily manipulated though.
---
Damn, I still lack that one. Can't beat that one boss, forgotten which one tho
---
thanks sir! i'm not to keen to contact the support of the small indie company. who knows how long i'll have to wait for an answer when they're so busy to 'fix' their stuff..
---
This is why we can't have more than 18 deckslots.
---
Lemme know which one it was and i'll see if i can remember the deck i used
---
i am so proud of this community, every time i see people transforming random cards into four mana seven seven a tear drop from my eyes
---
Would you like to explain how to manipulate this?
---
They're starting to translate the hunter cards into "smorc", probably for convenience.
---
More like shallow throated, but throated nonetheless.
---
I always knew he was a stud
---
That‚Äôs true, fair enough
---
*has lethal* 
---
Jk(:
---
is there a specific setting to do that on iphone? i thought it'll do that automatically when uninstalling apps..
---
2 Dragon 3
---
Oh I did that too! But mine was with Graal the Shark. Spoiler: &gt;!The Deathrattle does nothing on Apothecary!&lt;
---
Wait wut, new cards on the New Adventure ? So like it'll have wings rewarding you with cards upon completion like in the past ?
---
Did you build this deck just for this
---
Nope, just got lucky with Rafaam warlock.
---
This seems almost like r/flamewanker material at this point!
---
That's pretty sick.
---
Purposely refusing to end games until you reach the arbitrary counter or conceding a game you're probably going to lose the turn before your opponent would earn two stars.
---
infinity war is the most ambitious crossover event ever
---
trump: ha
---
Slitherspear, OFC. I tried with inner Fire Priest a lot, and had lethal once but misclicked. After that I had to do something else to calm down and haven't played it since.
---
I've never been this confused my whole life
---
Not give but if you don‚Äôt remove them after awhile the salt fades and you‚Äôre the only one that stuck around on their friends list. I‚Äôve got a lot of gold this way.
---
I mean, she is a surprisingly good singer. 
---
But also, why is this a thing?
---
Sorry, of course, I could see folks playing around the fact that at a certain turn count you get an extra star. Delaying an already won game, the whole meta changing to midrange after the change. Idk. I would try to take advantage of it.
---
Is this just fantasy?
---
I mean... how could it not be?
---
There's more. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nai2IL8KOIE) Sasha Grey playing The Witcher 3.

---
I prefer facing a deathrattle rogue any day than a huntard, at least rogues can fail from time to time.
---
Token mech isnt half bad once you get some divine shields going. Need one minion that hits multiple minions at once to clear their shields.
---
They look great. Can I use tinyfin, magma rager and tirion as r/hearthstonecirclejerk flairs?
---
Not a native english speaker but I think that if I worded it " I had ever seen", then it would only imply seeing it. But I meant my luckiest run and the luckist run I had seen. Thus " I have ever had, and seen"  Probably should have added the comma ^^
---
Yeah and that RNG was Wild. Got the golden Wraith Wreaver on turn 3
---
Aw, I was hoping it was going to be together with Trumpsc :(.
---
there are very few meme decks at 1, up to 2 a lot of people don‚Äôt care but everyone at 1 is pushing
---
Yeah you¬¥re probably right :D but I somehow didn¬¥t manage to get a Voidlord thus I put in the Juggler hoping the Imp would trigger a few times ^^
---
Certainly
---
Yikes this comment section...
---
Face, face, face. What a destroyer.
---
It didn't gain pagel's health?
---
Will be 10 hunters in the next sample, guaranteed.
---
if you want to play the deck with the least autoloss matchups galakrond shaman is still favored against every deck in the game except holy wrath paladin and face hunter.  
---

---
pirate warrior has an almost as impressive matchup spread with galakrond shaman and hand warlock as it's only meta-relevant unfavorables
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/22/pirate-warrior#tab=matchups  
---
galakrond zoo warlock has a relatively balanced matchup spread too  
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/348/galakrond-zoo-warlock#tab=matchups
---
Number of beats.
---
Well, it's not too late, she hasn't finished the game yet. You know what to do, Trump.
---
We didn‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúguy she told you not to worry about‚Äù meme out of this
---
A faceless one.
---
Ahh ok makes sense, and yeah wasn't pointing it out as a lecture, just a note.  
---
I haven't played much  Battlegrounds but I've yet to get a good demon run.
---
Outjerked again.
---

---
I feel you man
---
Powerful rendition, even trumps the likes of Pavarotti and Celine Dion.
---
The chad tinyfin
---
Next level BM card.
---
Now all I‚Äôm wondering is if Trump lost his virginity at last
