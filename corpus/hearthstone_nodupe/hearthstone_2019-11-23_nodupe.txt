Tell me about it. That + combined bad rng luck on refreah so you dont get amything going for you
---
no. token druid generally tries to get their minions to stick a turn before they buff them.

---
[[the forest aid] saw play in token deck and this card is similar, not as good but still similar.

I never played an auto chess game before, so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the way HS does it or just because I don‚Äôt like the genre but I think I‚Äôve played...4 games of Battlegrounds. Ehh. Honestly it just makes me want to play real HS, even despite the bullshit going on in Wild (I rarely touch Standard anymore). 
---
I like the idea of using battlecries and other keywords to affect your pieces but compared to what I‚Äôve seen from my friends playing TFT, it‚Äôs just boring to play. At least in that one the pieces are fighting and dynamically moving. Not that I‚Äôd have HS do their version totally different from how the rest of the game is designed but...not a win for me. Not a win at all.
---
If other people like it, great. We always want more players, but I foresee myself queuing into a battleground about once a month.
---
It's not is as different as you'd expect. Combo is better, but so are the disruptive tools. Aggro decks are faster, but midrange/control decks also do more powerful things on earlier turns.
---
You know we half like 2/3 of an expansion worth of cards to get more dragons?

I think I remeber that he said he paid his editor 100$ per video, given his output that's something between 2 and 3k per month, just from that he must earn more than I do in my job

Much appreciated, your art is fantastic.

Most of the invoke cards add +1 atk so it could have aggro potential with 2 2/1s every time a card is played.
---
Are you complaining while Shaman is still there?
---
Oh, that's great :) I guess that I should have checked first before writing a long comment from mobile...

Nice

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frustrating to see other people get stuff while I get shafted‚Äù is what you said.

You are literally bitching.

I thought murlocs were weak as well, until bran was a hero. bran + (golden) Bran + murlocs is disgusting. You need to survive to the lategame tho and even then menagerie is probably even stronger (except for you hitting multiple megasaurs)

If you cant reach atleast 6k by accident youre making misplays
---
Yeah but if you have gonk you can also go face!
---
Until the release of new expansion, I may not play Standard...
---
Shaman is 30%. Evolve shaman is like 10%. It‚Äôs because people love mediocre decks that have big highroll potential. The combo of hare mogu evolve is amazing. The deck is not, unless you draw the combo before turn 5. It‚Äôs not really crushing competition. It‚Äôs just that everyone remembers all the times they were highrolled by hare evolve on turn 4, and people never seem to remember the times when they faced an evolve shaman that did hero power pass every turn because they didn‚Äôt draw hare evolve. The highroll games where you lose on turn 4 are way more memorable than those where the shaman just doesn‚Äôt have it and you win. You tend to forget those games.
---
This is absolutely excellent work! Completely within the stylings of modern Hearthstone artwork, with plenty of details surpassing it. Kudos to you and your talents!
---
You're still adding to the player count, making Hearthstone as a whole look better from a business/investor's standpoint.
---
And when playing regular Hearthstone is the only way to complete most of your daily quests, you just might find it more attractive than mindlessly grinding games away to make sure you've saved up enough gold to unlock that third hero pick.
---
That would be a wild amount of suffering btw

good.
---
For some reason I've been performing really well at BG. It is really fun to be able to play with my favorite streamers somewhat consistently! :)
---
What was the worse way you lost?
---
Kripp is such a douchenoodle. Always bragging about being the best player in the world (even though he had a massive advantage since he was BG playing since Alpha), and now his MMR is almost 1.5k lower than the actual best players. Watch him pretend he doesn't care about ranking anymore despite constantly talking about being at the top when the game launched.
---
does solo content complete the watch a friend quest? i did not know this one.
---
Sorry about that. Hopefully it should resolve with time somehow. Perhaps an alternate platform if available would be a workaround.
---
Hearthstone top decks is a terrible site from a competitive perspective. Only use vicious syn and hsreplay. Where‚Äôs the math for the draw chances? And you don‚Äôt even outright lose facing hare evolve. They have to not lowroll the evolve. So a lot of check boxes have to be ticked for evolve shaman to completely pop off whereas people are making it seem like it happens every game because they only remember those games when evolve shaman pops off.
---
They actually said that unstable ghouls is coming, it was retired since Prof. Putricide Hero power was "give a minion poisonous" but when his hero power was changed, ghould was already out. They are also updating Putricide hero power to "give the leftmost minion +20 atk btw.

Mike Donais said it, I'm not sure where, but 100% he said it in an interview or here.

Nope just a random minion but instead of costing 3 it cost 9 üòÖ
---
Both. It's a New Thing so we're not worn out by it yet despite the relative shallowness, and at the same time trying to play Standard is sometimes like pulling teeth when you can't even get thise five wins to get the chest because people throw meta-heavy Googled decks at you and you get ROFLstomped by turn seven.
---
I know I'm not good, but I'm not that not good. I even have three first places in BG =)
---
As a somewhat noob to Hearthstone, can you tell me why making your opponent's spells cost 0 would be beneficial? I feel like so many decks will just punish you if the can make big spell plays faster.
---
So... I made one without knowing, and I was very disappointed.
---
MY life is sad? Please buddy, you had the time to go through my post history, so I can't even begin to imagine how pathetic yours is.

Don‚Äôt worry, it only took about 3 seconds, because every other one of your comments is some toxic garbage.

This was much better than battlegrounds.

Divide 25 by 4
---
100%.
---
If taking a 2/2 Nightmare Amalgam means that you lose 4 Health once or twice compared to if you took a 3/4 Nightmare Amalgam, then that could be an entire life in the late-game that you don't have which means you need to scale faster.
---
Cthun cultists only buffed cthun, otherwise they are vanilla minions. Invoke triggers the hero power as well so the invoke cards are good on their own.
---
But Galakrond is not game winning like cthun.
---
You earned it!
---
[Tried to incorporate the sword and what appears to be magic coming from the glove](https://i.imgur.com/x9FOhGf.png)
---
Because the chances of Nightmare Amalgam scaling way out of control when you have less Health is far less significant.
---
It's really not a difficult concept.
---
This is exceptional.
---
She would be busted with any buffer
---
They should not show the card over and over again before the Deathrattle triggers. Quite annoying.
---
The tavern brawls were much better
---
Just buy a useless Dragon and keep it in your hand the whole game
---
Kripp left it there intentionally. I was watching the stream when it happened. He started playing on his alternate accounts instead.
---
*Deryl likes this*
---
This is the first time I saw scout offered by Bob
---
Because if he bought that... Omg.
---
This mechanic alone can add a new layer of complexity if it is added in classic HS as well.. Positioning will matter before attacking
---
What is this timeline. I thought Zilliax was teched in almost any deck before?
---
You have to Invoke to upgrade and it all depends how good those cards are.
---
Close enougth \^\^\^. I got a golden khadgar and a normal one -&gt; Every token generator got me 2 triples. Sadly animation time screwed me over and i had just a board full of 2/2 golden murlocs.
---
By the amount of Kharut defender I had to kill this expansion it safe to say I will not miss any reborn minion for a while
---
Really isn‚Äôt when late game you have demons that have 200+ health and other mechs with even more health. Even bigger minions can‚Äôt even value trade it because they just die.
---
I just finished this in heroic mode recently, occasionally picked it up...it has been years since I played Karazan adventure.

he's said multiple times that streaming was a long term career goal for him.  this is probably the opportunity he was waiting for to quit, a big payout.

Yeah same here and i sometimes try to reposition my minions aswell

Nope, got nothing.
---
There‚Äôs a post right below yours that explains everything
---
Yes It should have been implemented long time ago..
---
Yeah, it was cheap and not luck-based. But apparently Blizzard thought that there is more money to be made with loot boxes. Which is of course completely right and of course also at least morally very shady. But hey you have to keep up with the competition and if everybody does it and no law prevents it, how can it be bad?

What a timing! such a good service, thanks you ;)
---
Just my own opinion. I dont really like the visual. I thought it's a tier list for a few seconds. The background seems to have too much noise, each column should have a distinct background color, there should be a sharper contrast between two neighboring columns. The star can use a different color. Alternatively, you can highlight the strong units with a margin of a different color.
---
So you can farm them with quest mecha thun druid

That sounds an interesting ability, but is it Putricidal?

Oh, where can I find patchnotes

How the fuck downvotes this? Are people really like: "No, I want to see that animation a million times. Its really beautiful and informative"?!

This card is very good for control too, dont know what you mean.
---
The invoke ability greatly help CW control the early game , esp if they print 2 mana invoke cards
---
The hero battlecry just scream control. Hey we love big guy to finish the game too. You do not want to win with Elysiana every freaking control game.

Lastly, you can still play your belove Dr.Boom turn 9 as usual

That is fine  last card in his deck and he knew the card. I've taken a shirvalah to face from 21 cards in his deck once.

Yes, it is.

It has a lot of settings, and its easy to get lost. Here's how to block flairs:

RES adds a setting cog on reddit on the username bar, just to left of "logout". Click that to go to RES console settings.

Once there, type "flair" in the search bar at the top left.

That'll give a list of results, just click the top one, "flair".

Now you'll be where the magic happens. Under **Flair**, click the "add Filter" link, then under **keyword** enter Battlegrounds, then click "only on", and in the last box "hearthstone". You'll have something that looks like this:

I would say shadowstep should cost more than 2, it feels like a better than shudderwock in almost everyway.

Better player won, right?
---
Someone suggested to replace amalgam with a card that discovers a tribe or something and I‚Äôm all for it .
---
Yes but when it still dominates after 2 years (before WotoG) you know something is up
---
arena is very bad for getting gold, you mostly get cards and cardpacks, to grt more than 150g you need 11 wins
---
no, they are from a single player adventure in karazhan (and a tavern brawl)
---
They are Elven Archer and Druid minions as you suggested. It's also Tyrande, Illidan, Elise, Nightblade, Priestess of Elune of the top of my head. As a general rule of thumb, if it's an elf with purple-pink skin colour or is a hippie, it should be a night elf :)
---
Having high health and high attack with poison is still good.
---
I went against a nightmare with 10 more health than me and poison help a lot.
---
That's a great idea too actually, gives a lot of flexibility and fit the flavour super well.
---
elm0#2523 EU lf 80q Questtrade, ill show mine, you go 1st.
---
Yeah, compare to other passive powers with incidental value like say Sindragosa. She occasionally gives +1/+1 even without strategizing around her, which is way better than guaranteeing the first attack. Would be more interesting if was a passive that helped out summoned minions.
---
What how? Weaver easily gets up to 25 even non golden if you keep him since 2nd round
---
You do get to see it from people that went to blizzcon, since they got rewarded with the golden version of it. The rest of the players only have the normal version.
---
I didn't know every card was a quest
---
Wow i never knew that
---
Finally MC will be viable again!
---
Mind Control meta incoming :)
---
Yup. If it could be buffed then MAYBE it'd be picked now and then, but it doesnt even have a tribe tag. It gets countered by big taunts even if tripled. It is useless.
---
You know those modes were not there when MTG was 5 years old, right?
---
Vintage and Legacy are pretty much Wild and there is no reason to break it into two formats. Pauper with such a weak card pool will be solved in a blink and player base won't be interested in a format that gets zero synergy with new sets cause power level is that low.
---
Limited is Arena and there is no way you could implement it in a different way than it is today. Or you want to draft card pool of 130 cards of only new set? It would be horrendous.
---
Hearthstone will have to go a long way before we could see new constructed format and for limited‚Ä¶ well, it will always be arena only.
---
Never said they were?
---
You can occasionally win with the pogo strat, but minibot doesn't transition well
---
Not sure if trolling but grim patron warrior was literally the only deck till they nerfed warsong commander
---
Upgraded maexna is not very strong though. It would have been better if you had another amalgam with taunt/divine shield/poison instead of the second non-golden maexna there. I guess its fun for the memes but normally upgrading tier 6 to gold requires a looot of rerolls and its not worth it. Having a lightfang 3 rounds earlier in play would have been better.
---
I feel like shadowstep is way too good, murlocs getting to adapt the whole board every turn seems like a bit too much.
---
I 100% guarantee you that Nozdromu will not see any play because it gives your opponent 6 free mana.
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
The issue really isn't N'Zoth. It's more Toggwaggle's Scheme in conjuction with a reborn, taunt, deathrattle minion.
---
The last time N'Zoth was in Standard, it by itself never enabled that much degeneracy.
---
Doesn't matter against divine shields or useless minions due to smart positioning.
---
It only copy a spell in his deck, not in his hand.
---
Skelesaurus Hex though, probably the biggest roadblock of Heroic LoE for me.
---
Its 7+ wins for 150g and onwords.
---
Cool af wish I got something like this.
---
Yeah I hate them too, not very fun to play üòÖ best thing to do imo is to wait for the new expansion
---
Right. I just wrote this because people go blind on upgrading Bob on turn 2, but it‚Äôs not always the best option imo.
---
This really displays why demons are so unpopular and inconsistent. The amount of minions they have is ridiculously low compared to mechs and beasts, and quite a few of their minions are crucial to their strategy, making a good demon build way harder to find then most other playstyles.
---
The best buff to demons would be to get more demons.
---
That wouldn't be an issue for most bounce targets, plus it works with Brann where Shudder does not
---
Isn‚Äôt junkbot a four star?
---
Lucky for you they fucked up Underlords
---
LoE had Forgotten Torch which is still run in almost every mage deck in wild to this day. Fierce Monkey, Dark Peddler, Everyfin is Awesome, Tomb Pillager, Entomb, Excavated Evil, Anyfin Can Happen, Keeper of Uldaman, Raven Idol. Almost all of those were run in most decks for their class. Naxx also had Loatheb, Zombie Chow, Mad Scientist, Avenge, Haunted Creeper, Dark Cultist, Poison Seeds, Voidcaller, Deathlord, and Kel'Thuzad all of which saw tons of play.
---
Did you win?
---
Because OP doesn't understand how to play her.
---
Yes.
---
Is it?
---
I'd tier up to 4. Not like you'll likely get anything good before dying due to not having a board.
---
Right, it‚Äôs not necessarily powerful but it makes deathrattle mechs actually work...at least that‚Äôs how I took it! Thanks for clarifying.
---
Floating Watcher is coming, which is nice
---
Fierce Monkey/Everyfin is Awesome never really saw any play? Maybe in Arena I guess. In constructed I can't remember them anywhere. Forgotten Torch I also can't remember being too prevalent, though it is in wild now. The rest (of LoE cards you said) are all fair. 
---
I probably downplayed LoE/Naxx too much in my prior comment, but my point was that they weren't as impactful as most expansions. Contrast LoE or Naxx against Knights of the Frozen Throne, or Mean Streets of Gadgetzhan, or the dreaded Kobolds and Catacombs. IMO, they just didn't have the same level of "Shake up everything about the meta" that the average card expansion has had.
---
It's halfway the leaderboard.
---
poppaman#1294 80g quest trade
---
I agree that it's not great, but sometimes you just need a neutral tagged minion so that your lightfang enforcer doesn't buff a minion you don't want. Personally I think its the wrong choice, but I can see some people who might rationalize it that way.
---

Early game +1/+2 is huge. You can just pick up any random crap that fits what you rolled for hero power, then press the tavern button without fear of being overrun and losing to much hp going into the midgame
---
Nope!
---
No prob!
---
Desert hare's incoming once again.
---
I don't know, it feels like we are talking about 2 distinct games. Yes murloc early game is great but you need to get offered murlocs first and then you need to see megasaur. It'll work when it happens but I definitely prefer solid tempo every turn over the hope of highrolling. That's because losing in battlegrounds is not fun. But in constructed, I'm a hopeless memer.
---
I'd like to see bloodknight added, and you can just harvest your own divine shields
---
Arena is also quite weird at the moment, due to the current rotation. I find myself playing it a lot less anyway.
---
I just prepaid for 60 packs so I might just do that :)
---
I think the 2/4 magnetic might be the most underrated OP card. Makes it too easy to give divine shield to amalgam and mechs.
---
&gt;Given how some of the most powerful hero powers are Passive Hero Powers (i.e. doesn't cost any gold for strong benefits), it really goes to show just how deceptively powerful Yogg's hero power is despite randomness.
---
It has more to do with the most powerful hero powers being advantages that allow you to be more greedy in pressing the upgrade button early game without worrying about becoming behind on board.
---
Patches can tank the hp loss. Afk gets to coast off the power of her bonus minions while upgrading. Rat king can buy whatever and the +1/+2 will allow him to stay even while pushing for more upgrades. Brann functions in the same way and yogg allows you to sneak in a minion purchase while upgrading.
---
Thanks, I don't know how could a 1/1 be that useful on the battlefield but at least I got how to do that trick :)
---
You don't have to spend a cent, the wording is 'Obtain packs' which you will get plenty of free ones after release.
---
Thanks to all for your answers! :)
---
So you're saying the app could stand to be bigger?
---
Paladin has access to good high cost minions. Tirion is really good is a deck like this and also the 9/7 with divine shields plus zilliax will be revived with kangors.
---
Yeah, I got this comp 4 rounds before the game ends, and it‚Äôs pretty much auto wins afterwards
---
The main diff is that Shudder requires same target, this doesn't. So you could buff 1 demon vs 2 with this power, as an example. 
---
Is that op? Debatable. But it does have more flexibility between getting the ability to add board space and to buff 2 different minions instead of just one.
---
I take everything back. I just started playing MechaThun in Wild and my life has joy and colour again.
---
(It was my favourite deck and it‚Äôs possibly the best countermeta thing I‚Äôve seen. Hecking great.)
---
Feature, sometimes you don't want triples.
---
Yes it is. It‚Äôs your only win condition. Rest of the deck is just support cards. And guess what happens when you have a hand full of support cards and no win condition.
---
step 1 pick one of the other options
---
I mean there is no room for text there when the card is a quest.
---
Its also really good because it allows you to have 7 main units whilst still being able to buff in the late game. You can bring back your best amalgam (im assuming that it keeps the buffs, just like when triples combine) buy and sell 3 or 4 buff cards and replay it. Even if it doesnt keep the buffs, you can just use it on your lightforge enforcer or your maexna in the later stages.
---
Even more addition to mechs due to freeing space to latch magnetic minions.
---
At this time of Standard i only play casual mode. More funny decks there
---
There are more than enough minions that could work than could easily be balanced. They said more than 5 tribes won't work for example, so after adding dragons, a sixth tribe would have to replace on of the existing ones. [[Argent Protector]], [[Brazen Zealot]], [[Micromummy]], [[Glowstone Technician]] are all ones from current standard paladin that would be interesting. Start adding neutral and wild and you would have far to many cards that could work available for the pool as is.

5/3/4 | Battlecry: Give all minions in your hand +2/+2.  
---
That's very true. If it would keep the buffs the hero power would be super strong. A lot of the late game power spikes are dependent on deciding which minions you can commit to and which ones you sell to make board space to buff the board. Taking these decisions out would make the game easier for whoever plays with Edwin.
---
I'm mobile only now. I miss flavor texts.
---
I've love to see them on the card zoom during games too, during slow turns.
---
Nice but... We already knew that...
---
Actually I am surprised the percentage for standard is so high. Whenever I check my friendlist, almost everyone is playing battlegrounds(small sample size). Go to the hearthstone twitch page, it seems like 90% of the streamers are streaming battlegrounds.
---
I think Edwin looks completely overpowered while the others are kinda meh. Im assuming Shaw lets your first minion attack first and not literally all 7 get to attack before your opponent can get a hit off
---
Mechathun?
---
Sorry for lack of quality, i dont know how to use photoshop. I got this luckily by freezing two zerus and getting a third right after. I was unable to find any cool triples because i died to finley.
---
Awesome guide! Thanks for the effort
---
the cost and craft button pushed down, the description is above it
---
also make it optional
---
This is cleansed Ysera, she summons dragons with draws
---
Collect bounty seems to strong
---
Shadow step feels good but not overpowered 
---
Charge feels a little underpowered, maybe first minion always attacks first AND gets +2/+2?
---
Interesting that murloc is the only tribe lacking a battlegrounds original minion
---
I actually think you can't get past cost 10. Since there isn't a 11 cost card.
---
It's not true at all. Patchwork is still a top 5 hero in winning the number 1 place.
---
thats really lucky. Yesterday I spent 9 rounds at tier 6, rerolling 5-6 times a round, with a board full of murlocs an didnt see a single megasaur. I had such a huge lead that I wanted to meme and instead I raged.
---
You can‚Äôt target the deck with any card, so I‚Äôd assume the immunity would work differently.
---
The battleground mode is a card game....
---
Yes, opponent misplay was adding jaraxxus to his deck
---
Dang, what packs do you get that from? What kind of deck would you build around that??
---
Seriously this needs to be addressed 
---
Shocked that this post doesn't have 1000 upvotes
---
The 3/2 raptor is worse than minibot too IMO, scales worse into the late game and most 1-drops are 1/1s
---
Played badly, patchwork basically allows you to tank 1 to 2 addtional losses before you die. Played well, patchwork allows you to level up your tavern aggressively without worrying about falling behind too much.
---
He's unsuccessfully trying to be funny
---
You answered your own question
---
Purely anecdotal from an insignificant sample size, but in my derping around at rank 15 for a few days, I haven't seen a single evolve shaman, or any deck I would call toxic. Maybe at the end of the month all the asshole decks have ranked up past me?
---
I did see N'Zoth Rogue once and that was a fun standoff as a N'Zoth Quest Paladin, but I did end up losing to Togwaggle's Scheme before the turn counter ran out. Not even mummified Sylvanas could save me.
---
Goes all the way back to vanilla.  Look at zoo warlock cancer.  Maybe, just maybe, people actually are burnt out.  I know I got burnt out a year ago, way before this meta.  Jabberwock was way less interactive and fun to play against
---
Games will tie every single time :D
---
1700 people is not nearly a large enough sample size for this.
---
Because not everyone can afford warrior decks
---
It doesn't give you the discover of you magnetise it?
---
Deathrattle, silence an enemy minion would be interesting.
---
Why no star on the Taunt Divine shield card???

It lets you retain buff cards in your hand instead of selling them and allows you to free up board space for said buffers without selling your core powerhouses.
---
Tripling your buffers will also be noticeably easier.
---
It‚Äôs significantly stronger, but deceptively APM and macro-intensive.
---
You don't build around primalfin either...
---
The people who make Hearthstone are much more incompetent than this, just check the current state of both standard and wild and you will see.
---
This is a shitty way to do this card. 
---
Makes it MUCH worse than glimmer root now. 
---
Yes you can kind of guess what cards your opponent may have been likely to keep but for the most part that makes this card a 1/3 and it‚Äôs weak. 
---
I think it should have functioned similarly to glimmer root by showing cards from your opponents class or even cards that are in almost every deck (Ziliax lol) that would have allowed you to use meta knowledge to make a difference 
---
Disappointing. Was looking forward to this one
---
Everyfin has been used in every applicable iteration of murloc shaman since it was released. The deck wasn‚Äôt amazing between murloc tribal nerfs/Warleader nerf and Un‚ÄôGoro release though, which might be why you don‚Äôt remember it.
---
There are in fact a few cases where annihilian battlemaster would benefit from being shadowstepped.
---
Play him early for only 3/25, can‚Äôt find a triple, shadowstep him after losing a few times and finding Brann for a 3/75 or something
---
Noob tube, sonic boom, martydom.
---
The disrespect class.
---
lol. Paranoid much?
---
Get a life.

Because he has a lot of health, demon stats are reall good. Recently won a game with him, with sole reason being his health.

---
I mean, if I thought it was a well designed interesting common, sure. This is just a bad little minion that gives a bad expensive minion later. I don't see the flavor, if this card has one; the design is basically bad Flunky/Stonehill/Bronze Herald.
---
If Blizzard made this card, I'd ignore it as useless pack filler-but Blizzard has to make some pack fillers to pad out a set and help maintain balance. Why would a subreddit aimed at producing interesting cards upvote a low power level and derivatively designed common with no flavor?
---
&gt; (is there a balance update limit per expansion?) until the cards rotate back to wild 
---
It's harder to patch through multiple devices like the apple store and other stuff, you need to coordinate things, so the likely coordinated the patch to conincide with the DoD release date.
---
Doom in the tomb was a neat experiment, and while patching is tough... They really should've changed things back a LOT sooner...
---
It‚Äôs actually 7 or more wins to consistently play for free, anything over is profit. For a good arena player this is a fairly easy average to maintain.
---
And if there 3 particularly bad minions, just reroll before buying. At worst you get a 2/2, which isnt good but for other heroes a 2/2 might be the best option.
---
15 min of video of what can be said within 30 sec nvm thats the content youtube wants
---
This 100%. I've played a few games where I'm able to get ice block the turn after triggering ice block. Unless there's some sort of invisible limit in place, you could hypothetically RNG your way to first place by rolling back to back to back ice blocks
---
&gt;What I'm trying to say - blizzard - don't give up on trying to keep the game fresh. The fressher the better.
---
If all they can offer is breaking the game (Buff Patch AND Wild Event) without any hope of reverting those changed, no thanks. They can keep their events and not keep ruining things
---
‚ÄúI know, right? that‚Äôs a pretty fucked up ‚Äòooh la la‚Äô‚Äù
---
So hard to do gold quest right now, because I just rage concede when they hare mogu evolve on T4
---
So it really is a completely different card than glimmerroot.
---
Glimmerroot had a very high success rate because the two incorrect cards were usually very obvious, so it was more like a 3/3 "take a random card from your opponent's deck".
---
Since all three of Envoy's cards are part of the opponent's deck this makes the success rate of the card far less.  However, the trade-off is you are seeing three cards in your opponent's deck and getting a clearer picture of what it is.
---
Overall, I still see envoy being a weaker card than glimmerroot and far from an auto-include.  The main problem is knowing your opponent's deck doesn't matter if it's just a meta deck, which will almost always be the case a few weeks after launch.  As a result, the importance of gaining the extra card is valued higher than knowing what's in your opponent's deck - and it's much harder to guarantee the correct card with envoy.
---
Depends on the minion. Toxfin + Shudder is useless, Toxfin + Shadowstep is really strong. I‚Äòm pretty sure there are example for the other way too.
---
I mean do we call the other auto battlers card games as well then because there is a square that shows up with a level and a unit name on it?
---
I never played the normal mode so I didnt know that lol nais thanks a lot!
---
Taken from his YouTube viewers with the channel not having any arena gameplay. It's like surveying whether people prefer pasta or sushi in an Italian restaurant.
---
But even he focuses on battlegrounds now
---
Yeah because the game was real fast. And nost rounds had10 dmg at least.
---
you‚Äôre definitely right. i was just referring to the sample size
---
yea - what is it that you like about a card game? Well, quite simple: you like to have just a slight edge against your opponents - because experience, skill. Wait: Hearthsone: Naaaaaaaaahhhh.... :)
---
I agree, amalgam is pretty fuckn gay rn.
---
Guessing right is even stronger when it works this way.  If you're right, you get a card in your hand, know a card in their hand, AND you know 2 cards they do NOT have in their hand.  Guessing wrong still has benefit as you know 1 card they do NOT have in their hand AND you know they have 1 of 2 cards in their hand.  It will also tell give you enough information to determine what deck they are playing almost every time in metas where classes have more than 1 meta deck.
---
well i tried it and went 14-1 in a session. played it till i lost once. seems bonkers to me that a deck with little to none decision making can be so good.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong please. But in my experience ice block is never offered after the turn it was offered in the first time. So you would need at least one turn in between two ice block turns.
---
Was literally just trying to get answers as to why I gained no ranking but ok
---
It is for sure, in HSreplay you can scroll down and see the top 10 cards played in the last 5 minutes and how many were played. This gives you somewhat of a gauge on player numbers. Comparing wild to arena the numbers are way closer than 13:3
---
Christ, just forget about it and move on.
---
This card is insanely better than Glimmer Root.  You should re-evaluate why you think it's bad.
---
So, the hero power gave me two khadgars really early in the game and I bought every murloc tidehunter for fusioning three 1/1 and getting free cards. When I leveled the tabern at 5, it was just a free win because fusioning 6 costs gives you another 6 cost card. I oneshot the first player.
