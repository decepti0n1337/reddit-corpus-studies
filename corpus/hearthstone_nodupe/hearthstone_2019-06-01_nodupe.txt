We actually recorded both lines mentioned there, plus maybe a couple more, I forget. It was... hoo boy, it was hard to listen to (and I mean that as a huge compliment to the voice actor).  Gio initially asked a few of us to listen to it just to gauge people‚Äôs reactions, but it made so many people uncomfortable we just started springing it on people to fuck with them.^^

Another big problem in Hearthstone in my opnion is that if you stoped playing for a yer, will be almost impossible for you to comeback and play the game with good decks, unless you throw a shit ton of money into it.
---
Wait I‚Äôm very invested now, what‚Äôs your tinyfin‚Äôs name?&lt;3
---
You can outplay Gally easy tho, save the 2 twist coins because he takes those and your draft chaft to give him the worst trade deals in the history of azeroth
---
You recommend buying it. The anomalies and extra hero's add so much. It has been a blast to play. I have played each wing multiple times because of how fun it can be.
---
huh,will keep that in mind,thanks for the info. \^^
---
See edit on "strictly."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And if that's how the transform mechanic works it needs to be stated and/or tweaked because it wouldn't trigger Kazakus' battlecry
---
Yeah I pretty much did! Glad you liked it!
---
It would make it more playable, but I still think it‚Äôs probably too slow still.

Which was referring to deadly shot and it's memetic penchant for hitting the worst target in any given situation. So basically, half of this is trying to be an "aktschually" guy, with most of that being based on purposefully misinterpreting of what I've written.
---
lady in white? more like a strong 1 mana minion in an aggro deck. i love it when people always imagine cool stuff but in reality mostly the degenerate shit happens and that's why we can't have nice things.
---
This post is not welcome on /r/ThanksKhadgar \- there's no irony to it.

I'd recommend the /s. It's a good notation that I wish was more prevalent, especially outside of reddit.

the best twists are the ones that don't actually impact the game much. im never gonna play wing 3 or 4 again
---
Oh yeah the echo hound, I totally forgot. Ignore me.
---
Honestly fine with me, there‚Äôs a reason I didn‚Äôt want them lol
---
Well shit, I guess I buffed him via minions. My bad.
---
Excellent PSA. I've been wanting an excuse to dip into arena again. Thank you very much!
---
MODS MARK THIS AS SPOILER
---
HE KNOWS WHAT THE TWIST WILL BE!
---
Bc to unlock the others decks you have to play the starter??
---
And people say that this meta is cancerous.
---
He plays a bit like token druid. He cant go too wide on the board by virtue of being an early boss, but makes up for it by only having to burst down 15~20 HP.
---
One thing I have learned the hard way in this fight is that you HAVE to trump trade.
---
I've never disliked playing against a deck as much as this one is my point.
---
Which would be fine if they ran out of removal, boom seems to almost give them enough infinite resources that they almost can't over commit.
---
Yeah, I greatly dislike the execution of the story. So far we‚Äôve been saving the city from our own Lackeys what EVIL shit are we actually accomplishing?
---
Yeah the long game with that deck works well but it just feels so procedural against them and once boom kicks in ... wow does it start to drag on.  
---
The only surprise ends up being which mechs they get from discover or assembly, too many dyns and it's party over.
---
They have an explanation and welcome, [here](https://outof.cards/site-news/110-welcome-to-out-of-cards). Also, their https certificate appears to be valid now.
---
It's really hard for them to cast a 7 mana Iron Hide if you're constantly threatening them with 30+ burst damage if they leave a board up.
---
BEHOLD!
---
late but agreed, esp on pve content where it's so easy to slide the difficulty without anyone noticing. i've played a ton of heist on breaks at work almost exclusively, and i only knew changes happened at all because trump mentioned a togwaggle's dice buff. if he would have said the change in the video, i wouldn't have even googled it and found out other changes were made.
---
also i saw someone on blizz forums complain that they didn't test the adventure beforehand, which is such an obviously shit take. internal testing is incredibly different from releasing content to the whole world lmao
---
Burning Wit, Stargazing, and a couple Inspire packages = turn 3 win against Heroic Flark.

That doesn't sound that overpowered to me. It's basically 8 turn combo requiring you to use 2 mana each turn for no imminent effect, and the combo is countered by any weapon hate, multiple different traps or a simple taunt minion.

You need to go to the blizzard online store to "purchase" knights of the frozen throne adventure which costs northing to do. Then you can do the prologue mission to get a free death knight hero card and optionally complete the rest of it for a few free packs but the encounters are heroic level difficulty however.
---
Roguelites (and other types of game) with any endless mode tend to have the capacity for you to become laughably powerful, but that‚Äôs part of the fun of endless modes. You could balance it though so that whenever you loop back to the first boss (assuming that‚Äôs how it would work - in which case all bosses would need ‚Äúloop‚Äù versions of their decks I guess) they randomly gain a couple of passives and treasures.
---
The max deck size issue is a more interesting one. Maybe as soon as you get a card selection screen that would put you above the max deck size it could first trigger an event where you discover three cards from your deck three times and you have to choose one from each discover to remove from your deck. That would probably result in your deck just becoming increasingly refined and powerful, but then also the fewer bard cards you have in your deck, the more likely you will only discover good cards and so you will inevitably end up having to burn good cards. That‚Äôs how I would suggest trying to do an endless mode anyway.
---

They're saying they used [Soulreaper's Scythe](https://art.hearthstonejson.com/v1/render/latest/enUS/512x/DALA_719.png) to get a copy of [Underbelly Rat](https://art.hearthstonejson.com/v1/render/latest/enUS/512x/DALA_BOSS_30t.png) in their deck, and completed the run with it.
---
I'm guessing there's some sort of deathrattle jaraxxus that makes you a rat. OP killed it with the scythe.
---
The scythe's deathrattle summons everything it has killed during the run. Kinda like frostmourne, but the kills stack between bosses.
---
Op summoned the rat-jaraxxus against the final boss, became the rat and won.
---
I can't be too carefull when i'm trying to clean up wild

I mean yes there's that, but you can't blame people for wanting to play the best decks in a ranked setting. Casual mode is there for people to use goofy decks. Yeah, you'll see the best decks there too, but not as much. Plus, OP can just use a budget midrange hunter deck to hang in with the meta.
---
Casual is just as filled with net decks as ranked. Or just people ‚Äúnot playing‚Äù and just doing quests.
---
Alright! My bad
---
Holy crap, I didn't know this was possible!
---
Madam Goya was a legendary card in the same set as Kazakus.
---
Sexy times with *the wife*?
---
Are you talking about control murloc shudderwock shaman? Because that has about a 56% winrate on hsreplay right now.
---
You are far from a casual player my frienc
---
And why is a deck with only 1 single counter which beats every single other deck balanced?
---

---
Or just play a card and concede
---
Runescape &gt; WoW
---
Rogues have vanish, and they just needed to get it up to 8 attack and have a 2 card combo to bring you into OTK range. There was a single weapon hate card in the game back then.
---
Sorry, but I'll tsk Ben Brode's actual experience with it over your conjecture of it :-)
---
Healing minions. Is everyone forgetting about minions?
---
Considering warrior decks are nowhere near the best right now, I'd say it's balanced. The goal of the balancing of this game is to balance decks, not individual cards.
---
wack
---
In five years of playing Hearthstone, I‚Äôve learned that you should just use what you have. In the beginning you keep thinking, ‚ÄúOh, if only I had ***that*** card!‚Äù - but it‚Äôs not really like that. Use what you have, and do your best with it. You keep spiraling, going through stages of disenchanting &amp; enchanting cards over and over until you realize that you‚Äôve just been wasting your resources. If you just sit on what you have, you‚Äôll end up with *way* more options as time goes on. Craft decks when you‚Äôre able to. But don‚Äôt go too garnet out of your way to disenchant anything in order to craft something else. It‚Äôs simply inefficient. You‚Äôre going to burn up your collection.
---
5.
---
 That‚Äôs what I was kind of leaning toward too, I‚Äôm wondering if there will be a replacement to priest otk mechathun soon.
---
Still 2 clicks max, same as now with 18 deckslots
---
Mechathun is Boomsday Project which came out last year, Nomi was just released this year with Rise of Shadows.
---
Context?
---
You have to do that every single time you change a deck.
---
Let's just note how stupid the AI in Dalaran Heist is, they use Conjurer's calling like it's a removal for your minions.
---
Could just add ability to add decks to your favorites
---
Neither of those are in the top decks right now. But if you must craft one of those two, probably Nomi....
---
Hunter decks. You won't be "all other types of decks", but hunter is an easy class to play and some of the decks are fairly cheap to make.
---
the cards have rarity. some cards win games by themselves. some do virtually nothing. its a gambling simulator.
---
A deck can have a high ceiling to play and still be bad. Take Nomi Miracle Priest for example.
---
The mage deck did also seemed to be mediocre in the Grandmasters league. I'm more inclined to trust the aggregate data than feelings.
---
When you become the Rat King, your hero power summons more rats.
---
Wait, what? Adding ranks up to 50 for new players was a blessing. Majority of the time you face actually new players + you get a bunch of extra rewards for progressing.
---
Now new players can get lots of extra ranked experience before hitting Rank 20 (where you more commonly face good decks, or even good players who haven't been playing for a while and tanked down).

"The Innkeeper sends his regards"
---
I've been wondering for a while why no one talks about Rover. Having the ability to fight for early board is great for control decks, otherwise they're just twiddling their thumbs waiting for turn 5ish where they can play clears. Normally low cost minions are just too bad when drawn late or are simply too low value (only trading into a couple tokens). The armor gain massively mitigates this and even allows things like war path to generate armor.
---
The early game is way more important than the late game. I can tell a lot more from the quality of your 1-4 drops than from your 6+ cost cards.
---
I'm glad this time HS balance team was right not nerfing Conjurers.
---
Cyclone mage had an awesome win rate last month because it was one the few decks (add hunter decks) who could beat rogue. 
---
Now that meta is evolving around aggro decks (mech hunter, murloc sham, token druid) they are no longer in the nerf spot. 
---
I hope if mech hunter is still highrocketing as is doing right now they hit with the bat nerf on \[Venomizer\] or \[Spider Bomb\] which are really hard to remove rather than their identity of going face minions.
---
Wow
---
I could see a card like shadow visions or stitched tracker that starts in your hand. Increases consistency, but doesn‚Äôt guarantee every game being the same.
---
I couldn't understand what happened. What card did he draw?
---
As a casual, this would confuse my simple mind. I'm so glad Blizzard looks out for me.
---
Yeah pretty much. It literally SAYS "**Rush.**", it's part of the same buff. I don't think any wording or consistency thing matches this.
---

Love the burst on this deck.  Devastating.
---
I was wondering the same thing. Maybe some archaic type of grammar? Or maybe the word "Not" is being used a noun. Almost like the word "nothing" in a way.

Why not keep the regular one? If by any chance it gets nerfed, you get the full 1600 dust for it.

That's the thing I don't like about the interaction with Shirvallah and Holy Wrath: The cost reduction favors the Paladin both ways. If Holy Wrath deals 25 damage when Shirvallah is drawn, then it should cost 25 mana to play (which it doesn't). If Shirvallah costs 0 mana to play, then it should deal 0 damage when pulled from Holy Wrath.
---
Blizzard should at least reword the text on Shirvallah, because as its currently printed the cost reduction should always be active - therefore reducing the Holy Wrath damage as more spells are cast.
---
Uhh, im not lying? You can use it on some wild decks too, and you can find use for it in almost every meta. This is a very cool card, and you can get creative with decks featuring it. Nomi is boring as fuck
---
No we did not get a free ticket from the last rotation. I posted a bunch of stuff about it and never got replies back. It seems it may have been an unintentional bug that was patched.
---
Inspiring
---
If you think you cant create a good deck with mechthun, youre very close minded :v
---
Have you considered going purple?! It suits you.
---
But the warrior hero power is easily the worst in the game.
---
I'M A ETERNIUM FLAME BABY! *smash the table*

Not sure if anyone pointed out on this site yet but today just found using that orb that deals 20 damage on that highborne guy (usually 6 or 7th opponent) says something like "that orb will be my undoing".   Anyone out together a thread for all the possible heist interactions people have come across?
---
In regards to secret hunter, how do you feel about eaglehorn bow? It has been missing from any of your lists but is very prevalent in most lists. I'll admit it's the card I'm the most on the fence about. Secondly, misdirection I found to be the easiest secret for opponents to proc with minimal damage to them. What situations do you find it useful in? Lastly, do you feel Harrison is worth running? There seems to be a lot of good targets between pick, weapons project, truesilver, hatchet, etc.
---
Probably because it is marked as fluff
---
Whoa whoa easy there. You're not allowed to say positive things about the game in this subreddit!
---
That's a cost not a downside. The only downside is battle rage, molten giant, mortal strike synergy which aren't relevant cards.

Ironic comment
---
Midrange hunter or token druid (assuming you got the free vargoth) - both are well balanced decks that can reach legend and only have 1 legendary and relatively few epics.

Probably one of the first to hit Legend; there's not many aggro decks and this one also goes all-in on burst. Probably not the highest winrate Murloc Shaman in the long run, but the fastest. I like the decklist though, it has the right OP cards and tech that points in the same direction. Only thing that seems out of place for me personally is Earthen Might; if you want another 2 drop spell you might as well put in Rockbiter to combo with Doomhammer. Earthen might has terrible low rolls (especially when your game plan is burst) the health is rarely of consequence.

Oh this is just *dripping* with sass. wp op

in wild with possible dekcs you can/could quite easly have most or all deckslots used for 1class.

Maybe go to Wild if you were playing standard? I see that you started in WW so your card collection probably isn‚Äôt as extensive as someone who‚Äôs been playing since beta, but the meta is more diverse there. I played standard for years and years but got so burnt out of the same 4-5 decks that I said F it and went to wild at the end of RR and never looked back.
---
Ah, don't listen to him. The video was fine as it was! I thought it was enjoyable and a delight to watch. Keep up the good work, mate!
---
kudos ! fair deck with no bullshit annoying mechanics. I attribute the climb more to the player than the deck. well played mate
---
2 slow
---
Yeah, rewards are based on wins so this is correct, and a nice thing to do too.
---
Damn, interesting. I‚Äôve played a bit of wild but i‚Äôm not really 100% sure i‚Äôm gonna spend dust on legendaries/epics that are wild until i‚Äôm convinced wild is for me. I‚Äôll definitely take it into consideration though, wild does seem fun. &lt;3
---
They will need to print a card that‚Äôs like Skulking Geist except for 1 mana minions
---
My guess is more late-game board refill due to the minion generating battlecries. Murloc shaman requires a board to function so having one card generate an entirely new one seems like a pretty solid inclusion.
---
How is it mediocre in GM? It went 10-2 in week 1. Even in week 2 when everyone targeted it(rogues were running 2walk the plank, 1bgh in sideboard, warriors were running 2bgh, 2supercollider), it still went 18-16. Almost no one runs those tech cards in rogue on ladder.
---
Ladder winrates only tell you how good a deck is when it is piloted by AVERAGE players. Pre-nerf patron warrior didnt have a high winrate on ladder. Even when raza priest was considered the most op deck, it didnt have the highest winrate on ladder either.
---
Thanks so much! Glad you liked it :)
---
That is actually a pretty fair assessment.
---
i'd take apxvoid's #1 legend finish on NA as a more relevant testament to the power level of the deck in the current meta than VS' melodramatic editorialising but you do you bro.
---
It‚Äôs even worse. It has way too many Aggro mechanics
---
I agree. It has it's niche uses but I generally don't feel like spending 4 mana to play one minion when I play murloc shaman.
---
Good luck. if you're interested lmk I could give a hand. After you learned the basics starting with a budget meta deck might be the way to go. I recommend mech token druid. or the old guardian series.
---
What are even the real devil's advocate arguments for why they don't have more than 18 deck slots? Like the non-sarcastic, non-meme answer to that question? There are some things this sub complains about that I actually see Blizzard's point about, but this one just seems like an easy improvement to make.
---
Playing both minions in 1 Turn Should automatically result in a concede
---
Hah and he went to the age argument. I dunno how about this: your mom should have uninstalled your fetus from her uterus.
---
Good?

Do you like the whole ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù motif?

Bomb Hunter just creamed his pants.

Philosofy101 #1379. I'm on NA. I show, you go first.

Sorry this is a old post buy if I buy the whole expansion now and complete what's available how many packs can I get?
---
I like the uninstall joke. Uninstall your hatred for the joke and embrace it. Its the thing to do.
---
yeah its pretty good so far, definitely worth it
---
I did it by going on the website for accessibility customers (e.g. sensory imapairments) and it still let you upgrade for free. Not sure if this has closed now though.
---
If making a post is to casting a line out to sea...I somehow caught the biggest prick in the history of pricks in the world.
---
it means a lot more if you're trying to answer the question "what is the power level of this deck in the hands of an average player?". it means absolutely nothing if you're trying to answer the question "what is the power level of this deck when played optimally?".
---
I did this a month ago: https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-free-windows-10-upgrade/
---
Hunter's is very valuable to an aggro gameplan as it applies constant pressure and can close out some games by itself. I don't think the Warrior HP helps that much (hell, it was straight up useless back when Warrior had successful aggro and tempo decks).
---
Keep in mind that APXVoid's performance is still ~100 games and that when we're talking about ladder as a whole frost nova isn't always played which is complete and utter madness. That's your secondary win condition against anything that isn't warrior or mage.
---
But really the more important point is that this is what patron looked like 2 weeks in. Except more skepticism because it really did seem like a meme at first. It'll never be what your average joe on ladder should play, it is fiendishly difficult to play well
---
I wish they would have some sort of consistency, i just bumped a Lifeweaver into a Zombie Chow, i did not receive a random spell, but the Crystal Stag in my hand buffed itself.

Good God does the Void Singularity Brawl deck suck.  Its full of 5+ cost minions, so I always fucking die before I even get to do anything.
---
I hit rank 5 for the first time last night as well.  Congrats!
---
And repeating the new Hagatha and Horror battlecries is pretty good.
---
SHIEEEELLLLLDDDD SMASHHHHHHHHADU!!!!
---
&gt; I've been wondering for a while why no one talks about Rover. 
---
Because it's like...the 10th most played warrior card (gets cut decently often), isn't always a 2-of when it does get run.
---
And well...also in general it's not great gameplay if Warrior is a helpless kitten on turn 1, and an unstoppable killing machine on turn 10.  This leads to very polarized matchups.  I'd rather Warrior have a solid turn 1 and a solid turn 10, than Warrior have a pathetic turn 1, and an unbeatable turn 10.
---
Well Gallywix currently owns Gatzetan as the mayor (unless Blizzard decides to change it because f'ing up old lore with retcons and idiotic twists is their forte) and has been supplying the entire Horde before Garrosh 2.0 took over
---
Congrats my dude!
---
Midrange hunter is the best deck right now maybe Control Shaman might be the answer. I would have suggested rogue but they suck right now after the nerfs.
---
Not gonna lie it looks badass

Generally in Wild, if you want to win (without playing Big Priest yourself), you either need to play a very aggressive deck or a combo deck. Control doesn't really work anymore unless you're just trying to have fun. Most aggressive decks have at least a 50/50 shot vs Big Priest, and generally just hope to burst them down before a Statue hits the board. If you're looking for something cheap, aggro is probably your best option.
---
If you are specifically looking for a competitive deck that wins 95% of the time vs Big Priest, Exodia mage is your best option. It's not ideal against all of the aggro on the ladder,  but I'd say it's low tier 2 or high tier 3 right now. Pretty boring to play after a while, though.
---
Mage Priest and Druid are different
---
What has he ever done to you?
---
With token druid or in general?  If you're asking how to improve the token druid matchup you should know that in general that matchup is favorable for you.  Generally you want to try and make their unleash the hounds and scavenging hyena turn (turn 5) not good for them.  If they use dire frenzy on a life drinker then you're going to want to try and kill them as fast as possible.  This is one of the matchups where trying to keep 3 or 4 minions of average size is better than going wide with a bunch of low health minions or going all in on one minion.  If you want a deck that "counters" midrange hunter that isn't token druid then you could try rogue, but token is already one of the best decks against midrange hunter so it probably isn't necessary to change.
---
strange that you think any1 would care for your opinion. if he played only aggro than he doesn't have any skill.
---
It is difficult to play, you can't fully trust the data for a deck like that.
---
Not that it would have mattered since you had lethal without the free stuff...
---
Are you fucking kidding me?  Whats aggro about all your cards costing 5 mana or more?  I cant even do anything most matches until turn 5, and by then Im already dead.
---
Blizzard is incredibly reluctant to give Priests a good midrange archetype, it's sad.
