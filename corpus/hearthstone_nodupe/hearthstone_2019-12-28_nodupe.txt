I prefer facing a deathrattle rogue any day than a huntard, at least rogues can fail from time to time.
---
Token mech isnt half bad once you get some divine shields going. Need one minion that hits multiple minions at once to clear their shields.
---
They look great. Can I use tinyfin, magma rager and tirion as r/hearthstonecirclejerk flairs?
---
Not a native english speaker but I think that if I worded it " I had ever seen", then it would only imply seeing it. But I meant my luckiest run and the luckist run I had seen. Thus " I have ever had, and seen"  Probably should have added the comma ^^
---
Yeah and that RNG was Wild. Got the golden Wraith Wreaver on turn 3
---
Aw, I was hoping it was going to be together with Trumpsc :(.
---
there are very few meme decks at 1, up to 2 a lot of people don‚Äôt care but everyone at 1 is pushing
---
Yeah you¬¥re probably right :D but I somehow didn¬¥t manage to get a Voidlord thus I put in the Juggler hoping the Imp would trigger a few times ^^
---
Certainly
---
Yikes this comment section...

Face, face, face. What a destroyer.

Will be 10 hunters in the next sample, guaranteed.
---
if you want to play the deck with the least autoloss matchups galakrond shaman is still favored against every deck in the game except holy wrath paladin and face hunter.  
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/346/galakrond-shaman#tab=matchups

---
pirate warrior has an almost as impressive matchup spread with galakrond shaman and hand warlock as it's only meta-relevant unfavorables

galakrond zoo warlock has a relatively balanced matchup spread too

Well, it's not too late, she hasn't finished the game yet. You know what to do, Trump.

We didn‚Äôt even get a ‚Äúguy she told you not to worry about‚Äù meme out of this

Ahh ok makes sense, and yeah wasn't pointing it out as a lecture, just a note.

The chad tinyfin
---
Next level BM card.
---
Now all I‚Äôm wondering is if Trump lost his virginity at last
---
Can I ask why you don't include plague of death? I feel like that one card singlehandedly turns the game around for me, especially against the likes of rogue and paladin. No sandhoof as well?

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
It's a double Dragon though!
---
A previous version i had used Sandhoof, but i felt like i never had the taunt or proactive rush i needed to stabalize the board when ressed by Catrina or Phsycopomp
---
And plague of death is a card i simply don't own
---
It's actually an intentional nerf to Face Hunter. Blizzard decided to make it all purple so Face Hunter players will think their Hero Power is broken so they won't use it
---
No, that would be call of duty still, because you are putting an already known and named product as an option in hearthstone.
---
If Blizzard developed a shooter game as part of Hearthstone, than yes that fps mode would still be 'Hearthstone'
---
I mean, I know you're trolling and you win because I responded, but my God your comment was so unbelievably ignorant I simply couldn't help myself. Congrats.

Don't play face hunter. It might be tempting because its cheap and easy to pick up but its basically a cheese, so you wont get better at this game because all you do is hitting face.
---
dont worry the two of you are brainless :D
---
Today, I followed r/Hearthstone, watched Mia in her own video, Trump in another video, and them singing disney songs together on another. That's enough internet for 2019.
---
He offers cards on the same logic that he did before but you spent more mana so the conditions are different. It's really not hard to understand
---
Face hunter? The guy that deals 2 damage with his ability?
---
You‚Äôre doin‚Äô the lord‚Äôs
---
also hitting vargoth with mass ress is an amazing highroll sooooooo
---
Its pc, its happened to me quite often mostly with keywords, occasionally the full text.
---
Funny how no one asked who she is in the comment section. üòÖ
---
Hunter in general is fine, I am talking about a specific deck that does nothing but throwing damage spells at the opponent and hope he doesn't have any heals.
---
Seen this bug few times during playing Battlegrounds on IOS client.
---
Do people play like that ? Isn‚Äôt that just boring?
---
No. It confirms nothing.
---
Not the best turn for a shudderwock
---
Just needs a script update
---
I'm not the one having trouble speaking or forming a single thought.
---
That's one beefy battlelord.
---
Gotta get paid somehow
---
Don't tell the others but I'm rooting for you friend!
---
Same. I've seen it on the app quite a bit. Along with a lot of other glitches.
---
I... Actually had to look that up.
---
I guess you could put 1-2 as their own. 5-3 has a lot of people memeing, playing decks they aren‚Äôt used to, and experimenting. 1-2 is all try hard.
---
You're right of course. I guess I was looking more for a fun/effective Demon that could help, but the problems run deeper.

Try Pornhub lol
---
He's not telling you this to be helpful, he's saying it because he's angry about something (probably losing to Face Hunter). It's also an inaccurate description of the deck, he's just trying to make it look bad.
---
As Sn1p-SN4p said, it's actually a good beginner's deck, but don't think too far ahead right now. Do the tutorials, level up several if not all classes to at least Level 10, then start exploring Ranked Play. You start at Rank 50 and from Rank 50 to Rank 26 you only play against other new players, so it's a good way to get into the game.
---
Why would I go to a porn site to learn about who the streamer is?
---
So you are the one buying them all. I'm the guy with one in his hand waiting to see a second.
---
Link?
---
I gonna need to see a screenshot of your rank considering you‚Äôre claiming to be top 200, playing with kripp and before you just disregarded your rank.
---
I‚Äôm familiar with Unity (which this is built on) and the card text is more than likely being rendered via the TextMeshPro (TMP) component which converts text to a mesh which can be augmented by shaders. The bright pink you‚Äôre seeing is a shader code bug. 
---
Looks like some bad QA for sure. If it‚Äôs coming back now after having been gone for some time something must have changed with TMP that they haven‚Äôt factored for. 
---
Ugh.
---
*Flik* You are already dead.
---
*Mountain Giant* What?!
---
Fuck yes man, enjoy your moment!
---
This is the only issue regarding the meta.  We have some midrange and combo decks but only one control deck and a ton of aggro to hyper aggro.  If another control deck could take on Rez Priest then maybe the aggro would level off.
---
People aren't complaining about him as much as you think they should most likely because he's the sole reason why highlander as an archetype exists. Dragonqueen Alezstrazsa helps, but if it were just her, there'd be no viable reason to play say Highlander Mage or Hunter.
---
Even then, stats on the card suggest he's not as big of an "I win" button as you think he is.
---
Have you tried playing with the card or have you only ever been on the receiving end of his wishes?
---
games with face hunter end so fast, at least the suffering is over quick.
---
Get this to r/all for maximum chaos.
---
Oh I thought he was talking about someone more directly connected. Saw someone called rajj popped up a couple times here.
---
I PLAY BARNES
---
Watch out! Everyone is gunning for me!
---
You say that, but have you ever actually tried a card game without RNG or random card draws? I have, and it was the best TCG I ever played. It was called Mabinogi Duel.
---
All but mama bear and megasaur are tribe independent.
---
Those 2 are dependent on certain set up.
---
It is possible to create a card game without RNG. I've been building one myself for the past little while as a pet project. I'd be happy to DM you details if you're interested. My original question was meant to gather data on whether people were interested in the project potentially going to market.

Played that one awhile back and lost interest in it pretty quickly.

im pretty sure shes richer than trump, also "power" ? What the fuck power does a fuckin hearthstone streamer can have ? Maybe your redpill videos eroded your brain.

To be honest, she looks a lot prettier in trumps video than on her subreddit.

Hey hey. Ahhhhhhh. There there. At least it wasnt shaman invoke k that shit needs a fuckin nerf.

Cool stuff haha
---
What is portal?
---
It can have a 3 card combo in there: [[Spellzerker]] [[Rapid Fire]] [[Arcane Shot]]
---
So we could call it a six minute combo deck. /s
---
Seriously. There are ways to mess up your winrates with this deck. It's not the auto-play cointoss cheese that Murloc Paladin is. Or the OP auto-win pre-nerf Shaman crap. There are some decisions to be taken.
---
Just because there's one gameplan, and it's pretty obvious that you're always the beatdown, doesn't make it completely braindead. Not the hardest deck out there. Sure. But there's no need to be condescending about aggro.

as soon as 1 argument gets shot down another pops up. it's like playing whack-a-mole. "it's brainless". bonk. "it's uninteractive". bonk. now "it's linear". i'll drop the mallet rather than bother asking how exactly you'd like to define "linear".
---
 I have a theory. that she's using this opportunity as a sort of advertisement/marketing, to leverage on Trump's viewers, to advertise her youtube channel, so that more people will visit her youtube channel, and so she'll get more views etc
---
To be fair Breath of the Infinite is actually a huge part of Priest's viability right now. Previously Resurrect Priest beat midrange decks but got absolutely dumsptered by aggro because they basically did nothing until turn 4 if you have coin or turn 5 if you don't. Now with Breath of the Infinite you can clear the majority of the aggro player's board on 3 and buy yourself that precious time for you to hit 5 mana.
---
Without Breath of the Infinite Rez Priest would most definitely lose to Pirate Warrior and would most likely struggle more against Face Hunter.
---
Do you got legend?
---
Omae wa something shinderu
---
Linear decks are brainless and non-interactive. Their strategy is a straight line (linear), it rarely changes (brainless) regardless of your opponents deck or their plays (non-interactive). I‚Äôve made the same argument 3 times hoping one would make sense to you.
---
Basically
---
No they dont, face decks dont exist in most other card games, aggro yes, but face decks dont
---
This sucks, but it does make sense to me. 
---
In the case of a Snipe killing a minion, the secrets always trigger after the minion has finished doing its battlecry. So, if a minion that summons a minion gets sniped, the summoned minion stays. 
---
In the case of Shudderwock, it‚Äôs battlecry is comprised of multiple individual battle cries. It‚Äôs layered. Minions react to the layer of individual battle cries, secrets react to the top layer. 
---
So, essentially, to the other minions on the board, If SW has a battlecry that affects that minion in some way and they have a response (deathrattle, etc), their ‚Äòturn‚Äô to respond begins as soon as the affecting battlecry ends. For a secret to trigger, SW would have to finish his top layer battlecry.
---
Like I said, it really sucks. But (and this may be because I am a programmer and look at everything through the lens of logic) I can see how and why that mechanic plays out the way it does.
---
Time for a report! Did you get it?
---
I'm placing my vote on Scion of Ruin for the most OP card of the expansion. That card is just insane normally but if you pull it off Galakrond it's absolutely absurd. It'll definitely get worse once Town Crier rotates out but it's still a nuts card.
---
Yeah I get it, I know the arguments behind it. What I am saying is, "last year of the set" doesn't make any sense.
---
You cannot tolerate OP things by saying "meh it's OP but at least we'll see it less" the set is OP, horrible. It shouldn't be made this way. This is wrong for the future of Hearthstone. 
---
We don't need horribly OP sets because it'll result in a powercreep feedback. The 3rd set of next year will have to be more powerful than Dragons to achieve meta shake. This is a spiral into powercreep. The game shouldn't fall into this pit.
---
For this reason, this set is horrible and enables power creep in the next year. This set needs a tune down or two. Cards are interestingly designed, I cannot tell shit to it, but overall powerful. 
---
I'm not telling that nuke the set into Rastakhan power level. The power level of Uldum was fine.
---
Is pogo that good?
---
How many times do you need to try until you get this?
---
Now the question is, do you buy all of them or just 3?
---
But when does random become too much? What if deadly shot happened to destroy just the right minion that the opponent couldn‚Äôt get lethal, and then died to fatigue the next turn? Would that be worth complaining about? I haven‚Äôt heard anyone take issue with deadly shot. Yogg would decide a lot more games than other random cards, but RNG has always played a really big part in the game. The new Alexstrasza feels like a power crept version of Ragnaros. I can handle fate giving me the middle finger, it happens sometimes. GG, go next.
---
But when the game gives it to me when the opponent slams down Zephrys? Utterly frustrating. And let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, Zephrys doesn‚Äôt take any more thought than playing any other value generator, only he can provide any kind of value you need. I get what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs good to get as much value as possible, but common sense still rules here. You throw him down when you‚Äôre about to die, need a little push for lethal, or can swing the momentum in your favor. Never before has a legendary been able to accomplish all three. It‚Äôs almost never wrong to play Zephrys because you will always benefit. No other card has been this ludicrous in the game‚Äôs history, unless I‚Äôm missing something big.
---
The few face hunters that won against my Galakrond war had Leeroy.
---
*Who knew he could play piano well*
---
Trump is a pianist who happens to play Hearthstone!
---
But seriously he does a recital(?) on his channel every once in a while and it‚Äôs great!
---
No sometimes you get bad luck. I played secret mage and lost to the innkeeper once lol
---
Was explosive the one that deals 5 to the center? Well, in this scenario both work out the same.
---
Gratz
---
But there is no charge your f****** phone comment
---
You got it boss
---
I feel like barista and dragon breeder almost have to be an auto-include in any warrior deck that runs scion for exactly that reason. Helps stretch that scion value like crazy
---
It doesn't count as an extra pogo when you double the battlecry. It just doubles the stats gained on *that* pogo. So doubling nothing is pointless.
---
I feel like them hardcoding Zephrys to work in specific ways against certain cards goes against the spirit of the card.
---
I did it as I had no activator nor minions to buff in hand, my opponent assumed that I am an idiot and went all in which is why he lost on the end, so it is not that bad.
---
Bro üí™
---
I hit someone in the face with six Leeroys on turn seven this week. As Priest. That kind of highroll could be quite frustrating if you're on the other end.
---
Burst damage and OTK decks definitely have their place, and can be quite skill testing. But Leeroy is worth some discussion.
---
Yes officer this comment right here.
---
Always concede, it‚Äôs about sending a message.
---
Can someone please describe the interaction that OP is talking about. He didn‚Äôt explain how the +29 dmg is possible, and I‚Äôm a noob.
---
i actually play hearthstone vertically sometimes just so it looks like i‚Äôm not playing hearthstone lmao
---
You‚Äôre talking about two cards that were released 20 years apart, four times longer than Hearthstone has even existed. That‚Äôs a much shallower slope of power creep. The game also changed drastically over those 20 years (as any game would, over that span of time even the metas have metas), so it‚Äôs pretty tough to directly compare two cards released that far apart. Plus, it‚Äôs a super blue effect, of course blue can do it cheaper.
---
Lol ok pal. You keep complaining about people complaining and beat on them for it trying to disprove their complaint and failing.. telling people to stop complaining when they won't which in itself is a waste of your own time. So you're wasting more of your own time then anything. Do you see the irony? Theres no point in defending the argument. You have your mind set in stone that you're right and won't see things from a different perspective so why should I bother trying? It won't do anything. You're too big headed to see things from anyone's point of view but your own
---
So, combo decks should just outright not exist?
---
There‚Äôs always going to be something to be tired of in Standard. It‚Äôs like a carousel of FOTM netdecks at this point.
---
Changing Leeroy isn‚Äôt your solution. 
---
Just going to end up bitching about something else while one of the most iconic cards in the game rots in collections.
---
I don't know why i watched some of that but most it those guys are terribly obnoxious celt for Trump and the other pornstar
---
Because people refuse to adapt to the changes and play the exact same deck and way when they play shaman doesn't mean it's still not good
---
My wife figured out that when I‚Äôm holding my phone horizontally that I‚Äôm playing Hearthstone, so I taught myself to play in portrait mode.. üòÇ
---
It‚Äôs a 9 cost card it‚Äôs ok for it to be strong
---
I will post it for sure, but I don't know how much time it will take me.. I would love to speedrun it in a couple of months but it will take me longer because I don't have a lot of free time
---
yep that's me, you're probably wondering how i got into this situation
---
Challenge accepted !
---
And what's wrong with those? It'd be chess or go with personalization, deckbuilding, game knowledge, and additional strategy aspects, plus the skin of a card game.
---
No problem, congratz and nice job
---
Damn f2p players trying to enjoy the game how dare they have a competent deck
---
Murloc Shaman is my favorite deck to play in wild. Always fun to see how control decks react when I fill my board for the 7th time.
---
Gz so far
---
Play face hunter. The face is the place.
---
Well the thing is I already did. But you once again refuse to see things from a different angle then your own. So I won't be able to convince you of anything and I'm done trying. Also I'm not even gonna bother talking about the rest of it or this Convo anymore. You're too closed minded
---
THAT AIN'T PATRICK
---
Zoomers and their 24h stores.
---
Hol' up...
---
Warrior
---
That's also my monitor set up xD
---
It's a neat idea though. The main idea of most of these are to highlight ideas for new mechanics.
---
*Our home, our tombs.*
---
what deck do you play?
---
I mean almost every single class has a way to outright kill something so yes?
---
You'll win by playing more and complaining less.
---
I mean in wild, everything goes, but this is just turn 6 and want to add that, that new 1 mana 1/2 mech is pretty crazy with magnetic.
---
If your opponent has a way to remove it it‚Äôs legal, but if they don‚Äôt it‚Äôs illegal
---
RNG provides a means for worse players to beat better players, it provides suspense to the game, and ensures that each game plays out differently. It is an important factor of Hearthstone, MtG, or any other card game.
---
Sure, if your opponent topdecks the perfect card to defeat you then it feels bad - but in order to get to that situation in the first place, they must at least have worked to get there!
---
I was playing against pure paladin and this didn't had anything to deal with that mech beast.
---
Forgot to mention, it's not a single case. Don't concern yourself with this if it's a bother to you, other posts are available for your browsing needs
---
I bet she wants his Deck!
---
i've beaten secret mages a fair amount of times after they played aluneth so it's not realy an i win card.
---
Leeroy himself is fine. He's the only real good neutral aggro finisher option left in Standard. One needs to exist as the Classic set should provide at least a little bit of support to all deck archtypes so new/returning players have something to work off of. The combo you described is far from consistent and the deck is currently setting at 5th on HSReplay for all ranks. He shows up in the #1 deck (Pirate Warrior) but he doesn't get buffed in it and as you said in this topic you're fine when he's not buffed up in a crazy combo. He also occasionally shows up in the 3rd best deck (Galakrond Zoo) but not in the most popular version of the deck.
---
He won't get HoF'd. And even if he *did* unfairly get HoF'd... they'd just use Reckless Rocketeer in a lot of the situations where Leeroy was used for combos. There will be times where it doesn't work because of the 1 extra mana yes, but not every Leeroy combo needed a full 10 mana and you can stuff two of them in your deck for better consistency. 
---
You should instead be complaining about things that cheat mana either directly or indirectly (like by making a copy of a buffed minion). That's what's enabling the combo you're complaining about, as well as frankly the majority of out of hand combo issues we've had throughout Hearthstone's history.
---
Maly is a more likely candidate for HoFing. He's not doing much in this expansion, but he's repeatedly popped up as an issue because they refuse to stop mana cheating and Druid always finds a way to abuse him to heights well above 30 HP. I wouldn't be shocked if after this year ends Druid uses Highlander Maly to abuse him once more. He restricts design space significantly more than Leeroy ever has.
---
My guess is it pairs you against other groups and has no concern for ranking, rather it puts you in a ranked tier.
---
Back in 90's ?
---
Reinstall
---
If you say "mage sucks" enough it becomes plausible to print a 10 mana minion with Battlecry: Win the game.
---
Just won a game with murlocs without hitting brann. But i did get amalgam with rafaams ability. That helped a lot
---
You seem like you have pretty descent spelling ;)
---
I'm having the same issue right now
---
Why is this a big thing? It is just a Hearthstone player singing with a girl that has a ton of different jobs, teacher, doctor, dancer, tenist player (one of my favorites), etc.
---
A rotating set would push the cost of an already expensive game up by a lot (and would severely complicate pack buying decisions), which is why it would be unacceptable to most of the game's base once they realise what it actually means.

Blizzard seems to understand this. As flawed as the basic/classic set is, they are sensibly reluctant to do away with the model.

First, Do you personally own and crafted ragnaros?
---
If you answered no previously, to answer it, rag as well as several other wild exclucisve cards were re-introduced into standard for a limited time (and was given for free to use, a special non disenchantable, non craftable versions), up until the descend of dragons expansion launch.
---
Another reason why rag is classified as "uncollectable" is most likely because you cant pull him from regular pack openings. And only can craft him.

Never play another game again Kappa

I really like the idea of giving your hero divine shield. I also like giving priest shadowform cards. I don't like Twilight Mistress because the requirement is just unfun, but adding shadowform to hand is neat.

How‚Äôs that? Guy is tormented by Charge. The counters to charge are taunt, armour, and heal. Those are his solutions.
---
What OP is mad about is that his preferred deck can‚Äôt deal with Charge. It doesn‚Äôt include enough taunt, armour, or heal. And if he can‚Äôt adapt that deck - that is to say if he does not know how to replace parts of his deck or all of his deck with cards that address Charge - then he‚Äôs not a good player. Alternatively he isn‚Äôt willing to do those things. In that case, he‚Äôs a bad player by choice.

Well done! I was a bit annoyed a while ago when I couldn't do the same, had to start from 5 and did not get to legend in time to try for a 66 or 666:  https://imgur.com/a/MfLcioh

And a few moments later... I MISSED IT! http://imgur.com/a/9MlhimL

Thanks! I use Adobe Photoshop

Leeroy is a classic card so it will never be rotated unless it goes to the hall of fame.
---
I would keep it, personally, it is a very good card when weapons are popular in the meta (right now). Zilliax isn't worth the craft IMO since it rotates soon, Leeroy is always good.
