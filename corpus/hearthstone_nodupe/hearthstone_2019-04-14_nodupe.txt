he is insane

---
---
I personally find the regular bomb warrior to be much more enjoyable. The control deck might be slightly better in some matchups, but it's sooo boring. You end up doing the same thing every long matchup, making the same plays and hoping for RNG to favor you in the same way.

That was beautiful
---
Same happens if you burn 1 card (don't ask me how I know that, it was for sience).
---
Aggro decks are cancer, control decks are cancer, then whats legit for ya?
---
I am always the warrior in this scenario. Hahahaha
---
No, fuck them, talk how you want. Just remember your Humor Kata :)

Have a good day too!

Charge, so broken. Thanks Blizzard

?

---
 I mean maybe you can compare bombs to the old anyfin deck, but bomb warrior isn't combo at all. And I dont have (much of) a problem with the control warrior shell, but you can't really interact with bombs in your deck aside from that one new legendary.  I guess you could specifically not draw cards, but is that really an interaction?
---
I don't mind aggro decks, it's over fast. Nothing fun about a long grindy game that was decided at the queue.
---
Surprised to see her after they put her in the game as one of DK Uther's tokens.
---
Rogue has a lock on decks that are largely played simply to piss people off: Quest Rogue, Mill Rogue and the pre-nerf Kingsbane deck. None of these decks were ever especially dominant except in certain matchups, and I've even seen them described as 'griefer' decks on here.
---
a Shitwizard doesn't fall far from the shit tree Randy
---
You get a pity timer of 10 for the first legend of a given set. The normal pity timer is 40 packs, which means one average one legendary per 20 packs.
---
Im having trouble understanding your response. If you put aya into your deck did it work? Did getting aya and jade spirit from espionage or blink fox also work?
---
Added as a friend and GM confirmed.
---
Come watch my stream @ Shaaakr
---
I dust everything wild. No regrets.
---
Mist wraith but he is in rogue and the "echo" card in question is shaman
---
As a Priest main I honestly don't even mind at all, it was so broken.
---
Olny dust the shitty ones or the ones you don't like playing. I dusted my mage quest because I always hated that deck and my King Mosh because he was too slow for standard and imagine how shitty it will be in wild. But keep the guys you love. Whenever I get bored with standard I play a control warlock on wild or a Jade Idol miracle druid with Yogg to have fun with the game again. Don't do anything you will regret.
---
This tilted me just watching it

My mech hunter hasn’t lost to bomb warrior yet

Not a Standard valid deck anymore, but this

Hearthstone is far more pay for variety than pay to win.  If you're willing to dust bad cards you can make good decks.  Just don't dust good cards ever.

I see you’ve never played against happy lock
---
the cutlass is bullshit tho
---
as a mech hunter i havent lost to bomb warrior yet
---
[removed]
---
What's the tracker overlay you're using?
---
Mana Wyrm and Mana Addict want to know your location.
---
Wait....You mean we weren't supposed to play into Psychic Scream? No wonder I'm forever level 18
---
It depends on each of us, maybe some preffer to play just 2 games a day with a control deck, others 8 games with an aggro deck. I put myself in the first category and thats just a personal thing/opinon. If everyone played aggro decks to end games asap then...what would hs be?
---
Hehe..."Your opponent has left!"
---
Yeah. Both worked before. This makes it so that putting a tri-class card into your deck alone isn’t enough to trigger Fence. What Blizzard did was make it so that tri-class cards never count for mechanics that care about burgled cards, just because of this card in Arena.
---
Right, and another word for "Reconsidering the interaction" is a nerf.
---
People here need to either play casual, get to legend *once* for the cardback &amp; then just hover around ranks 20-10, or simply finally admit that maybe they just don’t like card games. 
---
Because *obviously* there will literally always be a distinctly frustrating or annoying aspect to any meta. Even just having to conform to the meta is in and of itself something that adds a sort of existential stress to the whole thing, and I suspect is what’s mostly responsible (in a subtle way) for the complaints people always have. You naturally want to use a wide variety of cards in a collectible card game and generally “have fun” in the process, but a competitive mindset will naturally lead you to only being able to use the best two or three decks.
---
Only 3 meta decks woot great expansion blizz
---
Deathwing can be killed by 12 suicidal chickens.
---
Yeah that's what I meant. I think my wording was off. I think both Druid (token) and Shaman (control and murloc) are both good meta decks. I don't know what Mage or Paladin decks people are running that are better than what Rogue and Warrior can do respectively.
---
Brawl is such a bs card (to play against)
---
Run weapon removal.
---
And beside. Its not like two Oozes as tech card could remove a major tool from that Archetype.
---
Seems like you at least know how to play this deck. Most of the murloc shamans slams Underbelly on turn 2 or 4 to draw one card, I clear it and they run out of stuff.
---
Ricarad#1630, NA, 80g trade, you go first I can show
---
huh, maybe not. Recognize the battle tag Green?

But also a different voice actor.
---
And personally I prefer [Master Bra'tac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kOjZ2kWI3A)/[Wizard of Bud Light.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m3LuKlpqy4)
---
If you have a lot of pre-witchwood cards and wild decks it might help to focus on those, some decks have fallen out of the meta or been nerfed to the ground (like rise and fall of [[Star Aligner]] druid) but you could probably put tegether a decent wild deck or 2 with your collection and dust. [[Zilliax]] is probably the biggest "must craft" card right now especially for standard.
---
Why write when you can less words
---
Angler (2) &gt; Scargil (6) &gt; Bluegill (7) &gt; Rockpool Hunter x2 (8)

I swear omega devestator needs to be excluded from discovers. It's such good control and with omega protocol and dr booms discovere FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
---
Remember when Wickerflame Burnbristle used to read "damage dealt by this minion also heals your hero" and was then changed to read "Lifesteal" when the mechanic was introduced?
---
Isn't that the point of Keywords? In that every card that is printed will now read "Lifesteal" instead of "damage dealt by this minion also heals your hero?"
---
What's the point of creating Keywords if you aren't going to use them after their initial inception?
---
Started from scratch. Since Im bad at making decks, decided to use Auto Complete. It made this. Seems pretty solid. But just curious why is has secret synergy cards in there when there is no secrets.
---
At first I figured maybe the 2 mana weapon is there simply to have an early game weapon, so figured ok w/e. But I dont understand why the 2 mana 2/3 would be there, when there are a ton of a 2 mana 2/3s to choose from.
---
bomb warrior 15%, tempo rogue 14.4%, token druid 8.3% according to hsreplay btw.
---
That’s not what they changed for lynessa?
---
They changed the order that her buffs went on to happen in a random order.
---
Obviously she wouldn’t work if she was removed from the field - you can’t buff yourself if you’re not there.
---
Like ??????
---
Are you actually 12 or just one of those socially crippled homeschoolers that will be that way until their coronary at 30?
---
I had a Lethal fairly similar doing Electra &gt; Mind Blast &gt; Shadowstep &gt; Electra again &gt; Evicerate
---
Felt like I broke the game doing that
---
I beat bomb warrior as asshole thief priest. Sure I felt dirty afterwards, but killing him via his own bombs was satisfying.
---
Depends on the rank, I guess.
---
I used Defile when the enemy Warrior had 2 Grimm Patrons. Everytime one of those minions takes damage and does not die, another Patron is summoned. 
---
Because Defile killed a minion, it was casted again, thus damaging the the Grimm Patrons, thus summoning another one.
---
Because Defile killed a minion...
---
Etc.
---
Wait...how many shards do I need again?
---
Just found out about that after I lost the game. :’c
---
Seems like boards are often going wide instead of playing big minions, could be a reason. Rogue, Warrior, Druid and Shaman (if you don't count Big Shaman) don't run any big minions (and Polymorph isn't that useful vs Blastmaster Boom anyway).
---
Couldn't agree more.  I think at some point they are going to have to do something.
---
Bittersweet experience
---
depends on millions of games vs 17 games i guess.
---
Well... a 2/3 vanilla is pretty okay for a Paladin. The 2/3 Crocodile is a beast. Which means if you play against a mage that mage could play Toki. And from Toki he would get Hemment Nessingwary. Which could kill the Crocodile. Therefore the 2/3 secret guy is better than the croc...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yea. I guess?
---
I’d say I get a solid 5 seconds of satisfaction out of it tops before I also move on with my life.
---
That's interesting. I guess its because cards like this have hidden text: "After this card takes effect, draw a card." So the storm chaser draws a 5 mana card (the bomb), and the bomb draws another card of any cost.
---
[Yea. I know how it feels. :3](https://i.imgur.com/DMCnDx7.png)
---
Oh, I love that fuse thing...
---
Dang thats some next level keikaku doori thinking right there. Autocomplete is a good guy after all
---
Op only had mana
---
Where in the collection do you find tri class card? I'll give you a hint, its in the neutrals.
---
It's made for the absolute most bombs, guess I could.try.to barista a facelessed seaforium, or that kobold that retrieves your weapons.
---
It's not a nerf, it a a bug fix.
---
I lost boys ☹️ I made a crucial mistake that cost me the 12th
---
Very few cards interact with cost on the board, though, and the ones that do are generally pretty specific mechanics, so I don't think it'd be an exceedingly harmful chance in that regard.  In addition, you can see how much is spent for the minion when they're played, so I still wouldn't say it'd be too confusing overall.
---
I'd also say that that isn't the entire point of Conjurer's Calling, that it could still be an interesting card to use for 'healing,' for understatted minions, or in combination with Khadgar.
---
I don't really see a problem with that, it's kind of what I was going for.
---
I would say that, sure, no mechanic change is ever /necessary/.  But I do think that this would be better for the health of the game, as it's a very troublesomely swingy interaction which isn't fun to play against.
---
To all the people saying "just play the game" has it occurred to you that maybe this post is how I like to play the game? Finding stupid niche useless combos and sharing them? Did this somehow hurt your experience because you felt bad for the inkeeper? I didn't say "The BEST way to complete the quest" I said easy in quotes because it was easy, I literally only played one card over and over again for ten minutes. You guys need to figure your shit out because commenting "just play the game" is a bigger waste of time than the whole video.
---
7/10 I would trade the secrets and arkmage "package" for a mech package of the poison and 1 to all mechs. I feel you wont get anuf value out of the secrets.
---
Btw I’m running Murloc Shaman.
---
But they were nerfed out of usability in the deck. Thus, if you crafted it like he did, then you wasted your dust without compensation.
---
Yeah, it's wild
---
Can you even burgle a lotus card? They're neutrals
---
did you just say zuljin is well designed? it’s literally the worst hero card design to date. sure, he might be balanced, but hes basically a spell that casts all your other spells + shadowform. the whole point of a hero card should be doing something unique long term, not just an instant effect (bloodreaver guldan also kinda fits with this)
---
So sad this is; Despacito, Play Alexa.
---
Definitely did
---
&gt; Whizbang Priest decks are always shit AND unfun to play.
---
That's sure right. Why does Blizzard always insist on making gimped decks for Priest that lack key combo pieces?
---
It feels like they don't want a wombo combo to go face for 15+ damage (for similar reasons to why they don't print Charge minions anymore)... yet they keep giving Priests decks that are designed to do just that... without the key combo pieces...
---
A worse jade system is still a system that is being compared to jades. That power level was Insane.
---
 Seems like it could be a decent idea
---
You sound like some sort of weird ideologue. I don’t even have an argument against you. The tone is just... *weird*. I mean, okay? There’s nothing that can be said if your reply is going to be something meaningless &amp; vague like, “You’re not even playing the game when you use these cards to play the game!”
---
No, I understand the combo and that it can be completed by turn four, but aggression is still going to be the best way to play against it. 
---
Even with Life Tap and Plot Twist, completing the combo in a timely matter is not guaranteed especially when you have to prioritize reacting to the opponent's board with removal over digging for combo pieces, and it does take until turn six guarantee both the set-up and pay off of the combo can be played in the same turn. 
---
Granted, I did agree both on that the combo is a little much and one of the cards involved in the combo ought to be changed if the data on the combo does ultimately show it to be too much even for Wild.
---
If it makes you happier, imagine I used "relatively" instead of "rather" in my original comment.
---
Do y'all have strict practice schedules? Does it interfere with school?
---
So that's why my first 5 games were with priest and druid.
---

---
And what is written under the tri class card when you open it (it says what class it is)? 
---
I'll give you a hint, it says shamab, druid, rogue.
---
Tri class cards always worked as if they were for all 3 classes at once, for quests, burgle effects etc.
---
The position those cards in the the collection is to avoid confusion and so people wont see the same card twice in their collection under different classes
---
You didn’t waste your dust. It’s like saying that because the saronite nerf happened you deserve dust for shudderwock. Those cards are still good even outside the archetype.
---
Plus it’s not like those cards are now worthless in that deck, they also serve a purpose. 
---
If those cards were objectively nerf as I said then you deserve a dust refund but if it was “fixed” or was slightly weakened in an archetype then you just shouldn’t get any.
---
If this is a serious question, post it to the forum.
---
Savage roar is a closer. A lot of classes have that kind of finisher..ie bloodlust... That spell on its own is absolutely worthless without minions sticking to the board. 
---
It's a strong card yes.every single class has strong , busted cards
---
Ahh thank you, didnt know this was the case
---
On one hand you beat bomb warrior but on the other hand you played murloc shaman.
---
&gt; Neutral Legendary
---
&gt;    Brightwing and High Inquisitor Whitemane: Two legendaries have rotated to the Hof: Rag and Sylvannas. Two new legendaries here, possibly to replace them. These cards got me thinking all the cards here were spitballed cards to replace HoF cards.
---
Whizbang is 100% replacing one of the neutral legendaries in another year, it literally wouldn't work as a wild only card. So that adds another reason to be skeptical of your conclusion here imo.
---
What free legendary?
---
Now that's what I call a decisive victory. 
---
It's not the only way I can win, it's just the best.
---
Yeah I will only play it if my board gets wiped or I can get a good clear on my opponent's board.
---
I think greenskin is the more consistent effect so it's better in my opinion, though togwaggle may be more fun
---
Would someone mind giving me a brief rundown on the thing with Khadgar being a bad wizard?  What'd he screw up or whatnot?
---
3 maop
---
Control paladin with prince liam to delete blood from your deck.
---
Meta still adjusting.
---
What bug? That interaction has been around since cutlass released, so about exactly a year now. They new how that worked, and they knew how jade cards worked with Tess. There was no bug. Just that they printed a couple new cards that were overpowered with the interaction in Arena and decided to fuck Wild while balancing it, all the while calling it a "correction". That really raises my ire when they can't even admit making nerfs. If this was "corrected" last spring it would've been fine, now it's just total bullshit.
---
Angler into an angler into an angler and then cube your collective pelagic bounty. Classic fishmonger business secret.
---
He was 25-9. I would say 34 games is a decent sample size to decide if a deck has potential, and at 75% win rate I would say it does.
---
I just went and tested this for myself, and this is incorrect. Blizzard stayed the deck that is auto-completed has the highest winrate according to their internal data, and it is definitely updated for current cards. Usually when looking at what decks are really great, you need to look at the stats for rank 5 or higher.
---
Greenskin is in a ton of decks currently, and heistbaron isn't really in the top tempo decks.
---
For some reason I feel like it’d be kinda fun to play on that small of a screen. Cool clip my dude.
---
It's because Priest has no other identity with healing going to other classes
---
Oh wow. Thanks for the advice. Sounds like I'll craft a budget token druid deck and see how far I can get with it. Hopefully legend for the first time. How does it do against decks like bomb warrior?
---
You apparently have no clue what you're talking about. I had a cutlass deck with a comfortable 60% winrate above R5. So yeah, this hurt serious decks.
---
I say not working with tri class cards is how they intended it to work. They are already considered rogue cards, so cards that gain affects from nonrogue cards should not work with triclass stuff
---
This is the answer I came for, thank you.
---
And I hate the other games that push achievements. Either it's realistic to get them all, or they are dead to me. And I hate arena so having incomplete lists would just annoy me.
---
It is generally pretty fair, if a very strong fair card, but it really feels sucky when a big thing gets sapped and the rogue gets 5+ mana worth of tempo.
---
Bomb warrior it does great, control warrior is 50/50. Insta conncede against zoo. It’s a 30% win rate v zoo, but zoo is so rare, with that being said zoo is also good consideration for the deck
---
I’m waiting until Vs posts their first meta report on Thursday to do any crafting. I would urge you to do the same. hsreplay doesn’t seem accurate depending on what ranks you’re looking at. I can’t see anything on their site other than overall, and anything above rank ten is garbage that skews all the numbers.
---
IT’S SIMPLE
---
True, but a randomly drawn Reno Jackson is far more demoralizing, don't you agree? Also, the next turn's play was insanely satisfying.
---
Yeah, I've seen the "Shuffle a million Togwaggles into your deck and out value any Control deck" list, but I may hold on it since it's kinda expensive for me.
---
Not long enough since shudder was most prevalent then that
---
Also your 106 games is basically a minnow in the oceon of actual games
---
But that made the card strictly worse. You couldn’t throw it and maybe win. 
---
And it wasn’t a stealth nerf. The community got outraged by reading the patch notes.
---
Your opponent was probably getting annoyed with you roping little did he know
---
So what happened when you hit yes and started a game?
---
&gt; hose cards simply generate far too many resources for the cost of a single card, with the exception of Gul'dan
---
I'd argue that Guldan generates a bit too much value when played, as in immediate value.  Getting back some hundred points or more of stats for ten mana is pretty insane.  N'Zoth was strong, but not that strong.
---
Wait at least a week
---
i've already known about this but my friend he has 130 packs  but only six legendary cards
---
There's not really a reason Whizbang can't go to wild. It'll be much less playable but so are most cards in wild.
---
Looks like someone lost a game!
---
also not terribly far off from norm?
---
Just paste the deck code, if you copy from HearthStone it's the long line of gibberish that doesn't start with #
---
About what you should have received
---
Became aware of an interaction that has existed for a year and was very well known? There were no bugs. Just lazy and hasty decisions when they broke Arena.
---
Do you think I should be happy because my favorite deck for past few months was gutted? And no, I don't care for a few hundred extra dust one bit, I want my Wild deck back and working.
---
Fatigue is just the most extreme iteration of control and personally it’s my favorite way to play. It takes a lot of skill and strategy to understand what tools to use against what decks and exactly how to counter your opponent. If you’re playing against a good player it can feel like everything you play is getting answered and you’re left handcuffed and I understand how that can feel frustrating. However I would contend it offers most opponents a very fair opportunity at a win as control decks don’t really have a high roll outside of board clears at the right time.
---
Yeah, this would have made sense had they done it in April 2018. Not anymore. Now it's just fucking with us.
---
Fatigue as an archetype is really just control with the win condition being the fatigue damage.
---
The rush from lackey is bugged. You also can't copy it with faceless manipulator
---
Yes because they belong to each of the classes too
---

You can discover tri-class cards through thief mechanics. I literally lost an arena game to Kazakus this week. This isn't about consistency.

I used to argue that wild should be balanced to cancel turn 5 combos like this, but... honestly, by this point, I don't even see why bother. If psychmelon and darkest hour can break wild, and "fixed" wild still includes barnes, every other expansion an innocent, inconspicuous card will find a way to break the format.
---
Now I just think Blizzard should release a rotating sets format (like arena is now). Wild will always find a way to be a dumpster fire.
---
2p
---
You can take a 5 day break but to uninstall the game your opponent has to play a Millhouse Manastorm which you can't do nothing about next turn.
---
Nothing I said lent towards that, but with you using terms like "Bugfix" and "Oversight" so badly, I'm not questioning that you could misunderstand what I've said that much.
---
Portal is probably the worst card in the deck. Hsreplay stats seem to agree too.
---
Buy packs with gold until you open a legendary and decide. Last night I opened a Toggwaggle so I will play Tempo Rogue. If I opened a Keeper Stalladris or Khadgar I would craft their decks. I may still craft them but not now.
---
Ah I see I did get my 500th warrior win as rag I’ll have a look to see if I can find the photo.
---
I see what your trying to say, but most of the meta decks like the OP has specified have plenty of card generation with stuff like [[Omega Assembly]].
---
So the whole resource management game is a little out of whack at the moment compared to the past. Even typically hyper aggro decks like Murloc Shaman and Token Druid don't run out of resources very easily with how easily they can generate new cards with [[Crystalsong Portal]] and [[Underbelly Angler]].
---
As for the OPs criticism of just playing one card on curve. That's seems to be to be a really heavy Control vs Control problem issue, which I kind of agree, it sucks to play a 45min resident sleeper game, only to have it decided at the end by how many [[Drone Deliveries]] you RNGed.

Jesus y'all too stupid for real. What do you expect the game to replace it with? Hagatha in a warrior deck? Game looks at your card collection and seeks what can help you better, if you cannot have the infinite value generator then it lets you choose between the tempo with the 1 drop or the usual cardraw with Thalnos, overall just good plays in any match. Seriously this one is getting old.
---
&gt; Playstyles themselves can be used to counter the mechanic.
---
That's what you said and I'm saying it's not enough. Not everyone wants to play aggro or tempo decks just so they can beat Bomb Warrior.
---
even my decks that revolved around a 1 mana mana wyrm?
---
Well, this title takes the cake for worst title this month.
---
Funnily enough, I packed her today as well from the quest pack. Secret pally seems bad rn but I'll keep her until she rotates out.
---
How can you do this ? This is outrageous. It's unfair, how can it keep any enchantments but not rush ?
---
&gt; That's what you said and I'm saying it's not enough. 
---
Yes, less than a week after expansion release. Well done.
---
&gt; Not everyone wants to play aggro or tempo decks just so they can beat Bomb Warrior.
---
There's also playing Bomb Warrior, playing Archivist Elysiana, and not playing at all. I'm sure there are also other decks here and there that aren't Aggro or Tempo that also do reasonably well vs Bomb Warrior.
---
All of which are better options than crying on Reddit.
---
Thanks for the emotional roller-coaster
---
Why do you see your opponents cards? Looks fun.
---
Wait a few weeks for the meta to settle
---
Against Burgle Rogues two Oozes really help you big time.
---
But against Lackey Rogues... there is not much one can do about them.
---
Ah, I see. You are a man of culture as well.
---
DID SOMEBODY ORDER A BOMB
---
This is pretty much my experience. If you are going to run rafaam I’d recommend Hakkar too because it’s actually a pretty sweet combo. Throw in the fact that with a little luck you can get a free copy of hakkar with rush that dies at the end of turn and it’s a pretty good play overall.
---
So which decks are you talking about? Because that's not true
---
This game is so damn stupid
---
1. Have you actually looked at the post? It did keep the +1 attack.
---
2. Buffs given by minions are considered enchantments and are kept. That's the entire basis of the combo with taunt and the Undatakah.
---
Do... do you not remember pirate warrior and patches?! Or maybe shamanstone with the spell weapon?!
---
No, I was being serious, this deck crushes aggro and bomb warrior , it's a nice deck in ranked
---
Everyone with a gram of brain does
---
Ok man i just shared my deck and i just said that it was good against bomb warrior, i didn't say it was good against control warrior.
---
Also I'm a casual and i didn't net deck this deck so it was a pretty surprising thing for me to do so good with this deck
---
No, he definitely is not a mush craft. It remains to be seen how good he really is. You can try one of the first two decklists I provide above that do not include them and have so far been the most successive anyway.
---
WOAAAAAH! GOLDEN common.
---
Sometimes there's great banter to be had about the game and some people just want to talk about the fun/random/awesome interactions we experienced. 
---
I'd rather not lose all the positive aspects just because there might be negatives.
---
I think the first list from the above, the most aggressive one, is pretty strong against Warriors, give it a go!
---
My first though as a Dota player.
---
It does. You can even do it in puzzle labs by playing a bunch of cards and then resetting the puzzle.
---
Its called having fun, burgle rogue is THE deck for those things
---
My friend got 12 wins and I got 2 with him. Rng fest
---
So then accept the negative consequences that come along with it. What do you expect people on reddit to tell you or do about your issue? You say you’re fine with the bad that comes with it, whole writing 4 paragraphs about how you’re not. Like. I don’t get it. If it bothers you enough to write an essay about it, do the simple things to avoid it. Or don’t complain about it, especially not to people that, in general, have nothing to do with what you’re complaint about, and most likely don’t care.
---
True, in the case that i bother attacking with them
---
Regardless, playing either card on curve makes the opposing player feel hopeless unless they have it as well or are about to close the game.
---
Midrange Hunter only uses Zul'jin. Many Token Druid players, myself included, use zero legendaries.
---
Rogue is another class that doesn't use many. It's pretty much only Leeroy and sometimes Myra's spell. Some people use Toggwaggle, but he's far from necessary and most games will be over before he's played.
---
Handlock and Zoolock don't require too many legendaries either. Jaraxxus and maybe Rafaam for Handlock. Solarium for Zoo?
---
I'd say wait one more week, but all the decks I've mentioned are currently viable.
---
&gt; The text might aswell lie, Fel Lord Betrug says the summoned minions are destroyed at the end of turn, while in reality they are always destroyed at the end of your turn.
---
What's the difference?
---
Its a replay i think. You can see in the right corner some options to speed or stop.
---
That was a bug fix not a nerf
---
Which 2/1 deathrattle..? Only got one copy of the 3 mana 2 treants though
---
We fucking get it.
---
How is that possible? I see bloodbloom but no idea what else is going on.
---
Good, this suggestion is horrible.
---
The best solution should be something like standard brawliseum where they can change sets every month, and bam new game mode with minimun effort and where everyone can join and not just a little elite.
---
Not really the same thing. Electra can combo with bloodlust, and AOE healing stuff to keep your board alive before attacking. Vargoth is better for spells that summon things or deal damage to enemies specifically.
---
Summoner mage totally broken play that
---
"i don't like cheap rush decks"
---
plays Aggro Rogue and Token Druid
---
:genius:
---
This is amazing. Like. I’m incredibly happy for you. Not just because of the luck but because Elysiana is basically the LK of the Year of the Dragon. Value city.
---
Finally outjerked!
---

---
Gotta believe in the heart of the cards, easy.
---
Ok read the title and thought I'm in charge now.

---

---
Ahahahahaha dude ı just made this decks  with what ı opened before from the packs ı got these cards and crafted decks that ı have opened..now ı want to craft a fun , not rush smart deck with my own dust..
---
How does it work? If I visit your site, it’d give u revenue? 
---
If yes I’ll routinely go to your site then!
---
It's the tavern brawl
---
It took me a year of playing F2P to get good enough both in skill and in collection size to ladder.
---
And then suddenly I went from never getting above 17 to hitting 2 in the span of a couple seasons.
---
You’ll get there.
---
Your definitely right with that, but it is a meme, so... I think I'm okay with that
---
That's more of an inherent problem with heropowers and various other mistakes, such as Bakku/Genn.
---
But does it play Skyrim?
---
I don't wanna be "that" guy. But you're getting a lot of value against a tempo-based deck, which isn't that great. And with the board state, you are very close to death. +You didn't hit the 1-1 with weapon at the end, which I'm pretty sure was a misplay.
---
*smolwizard*
---
4984 would be inadequate, and 4986 would be absurd
---
You sometimes get 25,35,45 etc gold as rewards from arena runs
---
Been playing it a lot... can confirm. The deck is very good.
---
In control games, he can just finish it. Solid card, for a solid deck. I think big mage will become a high tier deck, there are so many different builds right now and all are having good success.
---
Fair point.
---
When I look at Wild there are just too many things I rather not deal with. Big Priest, the whole Naga fiesta that has been solved but ran too long, Cubelock but now we found something worse and the most bitter thing is that Blizzards solution for Genn and Baku was to just dump it to wild.
---
I really enjoy RNG shenanigans, so I’d suggest playing around with control decks that feature Elysiana.
---
Another fun one I haven’t seen yet is a new mill Druid. Draw your entire deck with auctioneer, then [[Chef Nomi]]. Next turn, [[Flobidinous Floop]].

---
4/3/4 | While in your hand, this is a 3/4 copy of the last minion you played.  
---
Another huge difference is that electra will copy targets too, so if you shoot your opponent in the face, it will to. Vargoth may shoot anything.
---
He probably picked Raza, since he could play it on curve for next turn.
---
Short answer is no.
---
But you might consider creating a new account and rank it up to gather cards for the other classes.
---
I fear you'll regret dusting your cards, which is not a good thing at all.
---
Maybe dust the cards from Year of the Raven? Make yourself wait until next year?
---
I think instead you should craft a golden Boom Scheme, to atone for your sins XD
---
But come on. Outside of fringe cases like this, I still think the card is ... bad
---
Anything rotated was dusted. I’m not a fan of wild.
---
Yeah I play control warrior and I always keep a brawl no matter what because of a possible Nomi shenanigan lol.
---
Agree with this fully. Investment comes in many forms. You can invest time - over time you will gain skills and some decent cards to form few decent decks.
---
Oh I died like that the other day, in my case it was two bombs, but to be fair book of scepters does trigger scroll of wonders when drawn, so it’s consistent (?)

I would say power of creation is  not necessary. I run a single copy and honestly never really need it except in heavy control matches, and even then. You would always prioritize Conjuring... it's just a way more powerful card.
---
Maybe wait a bit longer if you can hold out... But I personally think it would be a good investment. Remember, these cards will be "in" standard for a full 2 years.

Wait, you don't need to do that in "Play" mode? D'oh!
---
You're right Blizzard would *never* nerf any of their cards line that.
---
If one class has once and other has twice, 10 fatigue means 55 damage. That would be unfair to the player who can't refill twice. Draw is better result than predetermined loss.
---
Wow you are stupid
---
Bombs should be 4 damage. Imo. Thanksss
---
Bad player gets punished making bad play. Deserved.
---
Interesting! If the bomb is the second card for example, you will then draw 2 more cards. If they are both spells, which is discarded by book of specters effect?
---
It’s a nice move in mill rogue, where you want your sludge belcher to die and/or you need to make your hand smaller
---
aggro isn't beating that draw lol
---
Yeah i know, it's also not a touchscreen
---
Copy-pasting my comment from OP's link:
---
They actually did everything to hide this by updating a previous post two days later. Makes me even more pissed than I already am.
---
The change itself doesn't bother me that much personally but what really pisses me off are stealth-patches like these, especially when they come out of nowhere like this did.
---
They could've just changed the cardtext or Underbelly Fence or Vendetta if they felt like it's over the top with tri-class cards, for example by making it read *if you have a card from a different class that didn't start in your deck*.
---
If you discard it with tracking it won’t go off.

Nice.

Hello there
---
I've had a lot of success with mechhunter variants. Deathrattles for stickiness and nine lives for value helps. Plus it makes their dynomatics next to useless as a 5 mana 3/4 do nothing.
---
Every goblin bomb of his did it. Maybe he got extra from combos, I wish I was recording it so I could double check. I just remember a couple 0/2 doing it too.

Zul'jin is a fine craft overall, you can use it in just about any Hunter archetype: Midrange, Mech, Spell, Secret, and any Control memes you may want to try.

Midrange Hunter is always at least a mid-tier archetype. You can play it without Zul'jin too, though, but Zul'jin is a great card for any matchups where you need a bit more punch to finish the job.

---
If Elysiana were a class card and that class gets a control deck then it could be unfair for the other classes not having a chance to delay fatigue for the next 10 turns. The problem with Elysiana is...that they released her in a meta that seems it will be a control one
---
at least she's "playable" now
---
He is obviously not playing token druid.
---
Thanks, I see some prople have upvoted my post back up a bit =). I was just very curious on the doenvote reason because I wasn't being a doche or anything plus this was my first time ever getting downvotes in my 2 plus years if Reddit usage
---
Its gta RP
---
Downvoted for being an emote troll
---
changed it for harrison beacuse there was alot of weapons in the new meta and my hand got clunky with to copies of Unleash. its taking to many turns if you have to get rid of two copies  of them (4 x 6 cost cards)  when you want to copy tou beasts in hand. its also make you hand even clunki'er when playing Zuljin :)
---
Congratulations.

Mech Paladin and Mech Hunter are the best picks against it
---
To be fair, the game has changed WILDLY from it's vanilla state.
---
The logic with "casts when drawn"-spells is all over the place.
---
For example \[\[Counterspell\]\] doesn't counter \[\[Felhound Portal\]\] although the wording is pretty clear on this one.
---
The only loophole I can see here is if you argue that Felhound Portal isn't cast by your opponent but "it casts itself" or some bs.

Sure, some of this cards aren’t as good as they were before but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a purpose, you can still play them in that deck and if you don’t like them you have a bunch of options are your disposal.
---
You could run ooze instead for cheaper weapon removal
---
Obvious troll is obvious 2/10
---
Given how two of the top three best selling card games pretty much of all time implement it, a Standard rotation is likely something to consider adding to a Trading Card Game Best Practices if one were to ever exist.
---
Blastmaster Boom
---
Except rogue. When I drop a giant early they go something like vendetta, vendetta, prep, draw pirates, edwin.

The other guy is wrong. Ninetails is a reference to a type of whip called a [Cat o' Ninetails](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_o'_nine_tails)
---
Dmh shuffles the basic scheme so I assume that it would play the basic version, I’m not entirely sure though.

Nope, it's a reference to a type of whip

**Cat o' nine tails**
---
The cat o' nine tails, commonly shortened to the cat, is a type of multi-tailed whip that originated as an implement for severe physical punishment, notably in the Royal Navy and Army of the United Kingdom, and also as a judicial punishment in Britain and some other countries.

&gt; Twig is easily countered by weapon removal
---
problem with Twig is if you ooze it, you gave them free ramp, and if you dont, they will have a 20mana (or 30 with that one card i forgot the name of) turn
---
oh man i cant wait till they rotate out all these infinite value dks.
---
oh wait blizzard reprinted elise but its worse in every way
---
Ahh thank you
---
Have you seen what hunters are doing lately with Thorindal?  Or all the ways they've added to.cheat out Malygos or 5 maylgoses.  Not to mention Mindblast was a classic card, but I couldn't very well gave six of them before.
---
If you're not playing two copies of conjurer's calling with mountain giants, you're doing it wrong. 1/42
---
I’ve been having the most success with wall priest. Play taunts and kill spells (including [[Auchenai Soulpriest]] + [[Circle of Healing]] combo), play [[Mass Resurrection]] or [[Catrina Muerte]].
---
 I also add the [[Spirit of the Dead]]+[[Bwonsamdi]] package even though it probably makes the deck worse just because it can create such an overwhelming advantage if you manage to shuffle in some taunt minions and draw Bwonsamdi.
---
Deathrattle is hard. I tried [[Undertakah]], but the package just doesn’t have enough value. All the good Deathrattle bar [[Dead Ringer]] end up being 5 or more mana and the lack of taunt beyond Infiltrator means you really get rushed easily.

Trading 80G EU

O O F
---
I have in fact not. I’ve heard of a malygos hunter deck - are you referring to that? It quite frankly seems to be rather close to meme tier. Thorindal can certainly be countered by weapon removal so I don’t see that being a bigger offender than leeroy
---
Also blizzard: Deal 2 damage to and freeze all enemy minions
---
The only one crying is you
---
Xice#1138 NA - Trading 80g quest - I will show - You go first.
---
Its such a cool card, its just a little sad how its made the control meta "run this card or lose to control" and if it gets hecklebotted lose anyways. I dont really think this card is the problem, i think the problem is how insanely strong control warrior is with Brawl, Warpath, Dr Boom, Omega Assembly and Supercollider.
---
That didn't bother me as much because of [[Eater of Secrets]]
---
How much do you think it will cost?
---
I was counting only the ones from Jepetto, since he costs 8 mana and you can use the 1 mana versions on the same turn.
---
Think zoolock is worth burning the dust?
---
I don’t feel bad for people conceding the turn before one can go lethal; it’s true it might mean the winner loses a couple of cards played for his/her daily quest, but for me it doesn’t amount so BM.
---
Roping on the other hand is unacceptable..!
---
Just fuck me up now
---
So what? Blizzard doesn't nerf cards because they're slow.
---
My bad, i was using coin at the beginning and it didnt take me to 11 mana for some reason
---
Really?
---
Don’t you just cube (5), play dead oncube (5+1), hunters mark on cube (5+1+2 = 8), arcane shot on cube(8+1), coin, hero power?

---
tbf no one has so
---
There's no such thing as 11 mana, the maximum is 10.
---
can still hero power
---
those cards do fundamentally different things.
---
After turn 8 it's ridiculous because of that twinspell. If you don't have 4 board clears you lose.
---
I’ve been toying with a Darkest Hour deck in standard and I’m realizing that Darkest Hour *really* wants Bloodbloom. Way too slow otherwise.
---
Because you can't go to 11 mana
---
Unless I’m missing something it’s very hard to get mountain giant before turn 4 with this deck too. Early draw is all classic cards like novice engineer or loot hoarder.
---
700 for each wing just like before, probably the same amount of wings as the others (4-5)
---
Weird Shaman.  It all comes down to when they get their dr. Boom if I can win or not.
---
Here's a question for you.
---
How many games have you played that Zilliax swung in the same way as a Corridor Creeper or Bonemare? 
---
The answer should be unless you're playing a Mech deck, very few if any.
---
I'm pretty sure i've had 11 mana before maybe im stupid
---
Oh yeh same turn your right. Still could be a clutch win :p
---
I feel like I saw something about this back when book of specters first came out but now I don't remember
---
Uh huh. All cards should still be playable in any standard. It's an online game, seriously. Patch it, fix the problems. Heck even Yu-Gi-Oh reprints cards, has a ban list, etc. It's not rocket science.
---
No problem. You can never go to 11 mana. 10 is max with all mana adding effects (coin, innervate)
---
I gave the deck a few runs earlier but it seems like it cant really last long enough to reach the start comboing off point. I was against minion mage and mech hunter
---
What deck are you using exactly?
---
They really are a bunch of fucking incompetents
---
Didn’t really backfire because you would have lost anyway
---
&gt;Execute if you have a method of dealing damage. Spider bomb requires set up.
---
It's way more likely that a Warrior has some way of dealing damage or a Hunter has a Mech on the board to magnetize to than the Mage manages to draw the full combo by turn 3 (especially given that Book of Specters will discard Conjurer's Calling.
---
Of all the ridiculous ways to kill people in the game right now, this deck is pretty low on the list.    It has [very unfavorable matchups](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/292/khadgar-dragon-mage#tab=matchups) against Token Druid, Mech Hunter, Tempo Rogue, Murloc Shaman, and Zoo Warlock.
---
Can we stop complaining about every deck that does something that feels a little unfair?  Having some sort of unfair combo has *always* been a prerequesite to a deck being remotely viable in this game.
---
Yeah, would need to go against another really slow deck (example: my Jan'Alai Baku deck... I still need to work on my deckbuilding, but I don't want to netdeck forever either)
---
Who cares about streamers. Most of the matches are not mirror and even if they are it’s like the old tank up mirror, it happens here and there but it is not every match.
---
think the first one is free, while the rest (4) is 700 gold or 20 bucks in total
---
I think the main reason this particular version of the deck is good right now is warrior. Otherwise I think freeze mage with more burn and Alex is better overall, has way more tools against agro and wide boards, which most dragon handmage lists can't deal with unless they get lucky firetree discovers.
---
Can we just have 1 expansion where zoo isn’t a meta deck
---
You’re playing aggro. You deserve all cancer types, at the very minimum skill bone cancer.
---
Bro... Remember Handlock? 
---
Even if the Mage draws perfect and goes all out you still have answers (brawl, prep+vanish, freeze+doomsayer, etc).
---
I don't care about dust man, and thief rogue is my second most played deck type in wild.  If it was a bug they have known about it for ages, it has always worked this way. This "bug" was not needing a fix, as it has never been a problem. Burgle rogue has never been good in wild. 
---
Sure it doesn't ruin the deck, but it does impact it on occasion which is enough of a reason not to do it. I just think it wasn't a needed change.
---
I see where you are coming from but I was comparing last meta to this meta. Dying from savage roar feels worse than delaying the game for me with Psychic Scream
---
Of course, but we can go all day saying follow-ups. They can just drop Scorchmaw soon after, etc.
---
Point is that it's not a free game if they have to spend their whole board and a Roar to deal with 1 giant to prevent instantly losing to a Conjurer's.
---
Indeed. Have been getting quite a number of disconnects on my Ipad. I noticed it tends to happen when I switch app/leave the screen idle for too long.
---
I tried a deck like this one but there seems to be a lot of decks that heal right now. I didn't have giants, so maybe that helps against those decks.
---
I understand that responding to this does nothing, but i have to.
---
You are using homosexual as an insult. Just stop it. You are pretty regularly known for making outrageous polarizing (to put it gently) statements, likely for the lols, and thats whatever. But seriously, even as a joke, using homosexual as an insult is not cool.
---
Hearthstone is a premium game and you need to buy more to even out bad pulls, blizzard rng looks like it has a tendency to group legendaries together and repeat numbers
---
Yup. Usually restarting the app fixes it but the disconnect isn’t always apparent until the turn is almost over.
---
Yeah because it is so game breaking it needs to be hotfixed asap
---
zoo warlock *is* a good deck right now. go for it!
---
100% agree with the second part of the title. i crafted a golden whizzbang since release. no regrets
---
I'm gonna have nightmares
---
Lol dont listen to this guy. Token druid is one of the best at the moment but meta isnt settled yet.
---
Once they change the text in game is my guess.
---
Are they hinting at old gods for next expansion? Many tentacle bois in this expansion
---
No golden card is worth crafting, except maybe whizbang.
---
Yeah it should be half the cost which would be 800
---
Yeah I wouldnt mind if you added me
---
He might be using the one that shows the meta rank 5 and under. I'm thinking that's the case because I know Zoo Warlock had the highest winrate at rank 5 and lower
---
Play deck with actual wincon - problem solved
---
Turn seven starving buzzard + hyena + unleash the hounds was fun.
---
It does show a sad bit of laziness on their part tbh
---
Ideally, but the stats still show that token druid has a slight edge on control warrior with a 53.65% win rate. Its only bad matchup is against zoo warlock.
---
Zilliax
---
where do you find these low tier non constructed decks? because even at rank 20 eu i get netdecked into oblivion.
---
Not quite.  There are possibly dozens of other more important matters where resources need to be put in first.
---
&gt;Reckless Fury
---
omegaLUL
---
&gt; If you have most of the cards,  
---
ah
---
Even lock can drop turn 3 giant, if you have coin you start with 5 cards
---
Yeah but... yeah. I just hate zoo with a passion
---
I crafted a golden Rafaam is just makes him all the more badass when you play him
---
Would also be cool if we could buy *class packs" with only the cards from a certain class and neutral minions. Would be pretty beneficial if you wanted the best decks without paying 100$
---
And that's why Token Druid is like 5% above everything else in popularity and winrate...kk
---
To be fair to blizzard, they've got it right this time.
---
It clearly says DRAW 3 cards. Then it discards if they're a spell, but at that point bomb has already gone kablooey
---
It's a fucking text change dude.  It would take 1 person 20 seconds to change that text.
---
You have to do this in Paladin for it to work, with Prelate.  Or in Wild with Spirit Tiger or whatever that one is that shuffles itself into your deck.
---
This is perhaps the dumbest thing I've read on this Reddit in a long time.  Well done
---
Puff/Icies in melee. Teemo in league
---
Bombs shuffled by Warrior ?
---
You simply could NOT play minions against Hunter, you never wanted more than 1 or 2 on the board at a time. If you played more, they would just Buzzard + Unleash, do more face damage and draw like 6 cards.
---
So I've been sitting here for 15 min wondering how the hell you got all those life drinkers on the board on the same turn?
---
&gt; - It should be.
---
&gt; - Why?
---
&gt; - Because it's more fair.
---
Convincing.
---
Depends on the server. The one the big streamers are playing on is super exclusive and isn't taking applications at the moment
---
His weird janky control druid wins this?
---
Yeah I edit the post reflect my main concern which is about tournament times if your playing or watching.  But for ladder your right, of course you could just not play it.
---
Same baller
---
Boy I love games were the game is effectively over when we fail to kill 1 minion. I stopped playing for a year because because of those style decks and interactive combos, and it looks like this year isn't going to be any different. It's not like the game is flooded with cheap removal so getting punished so hard for failing to kill 1 minion in Mech hunter, Zoo, Token Druid, Regular Druid, Rogue, probably more, feels like ass.
---
Ehhhh you really need something like Brawl or Equality Pyro for this.  Removing one giant still leaves 3 on the board.
---
Or on turn 8 lol
---
Do you realize then they would need to deploy a hotfix for the change to actually be live? It's just not a question of just doing a text change but deploying the change and scheduling a maintenance. They will surely fix it with the next planned patch/hotfix. But there is 0 reason to have another hotfix out of the regular schedule only because of this.
---
As a Bomb Warrior, you really want something to fill up your early curve but there is no really great option. So a 2-mana cycle is okay-ish.
---
Turns out whizzbang is pretty good when you get one of the 5 good decks out of 18.
---
It's not too late, you're just a dumbass
---
We were THIS close to ~~greatness~~ PERFECTION.
---
Nothing reshuffles your deck unless it's stated in text, afaik cards just go into a random spot in your deck. So OP was booned either way.
---
He's a really bad tempo play for 10 mana, requires your opponent to draw their deck to work, and is easily countered with cards like rafaam and Archivist Elysiana. I made a paladin deck that uses the hakkar-prince Liam combo, but I've never actually won through the bloods, only by them not being able to remove my threats.
---
It makes me sad that Togwaggle isn’t in the top tempo rogue decklist..,
---
He is playing stonetusk boars and made a pun. That's all
---
Golden legendary pity tracker is actually on a separate timer. You can see the rarity of every card opened in the screenshot however.  A Golden legendary is noted as a gold star. None were opened during that period. 
---
(Also they are hard to miss! Haha)
---
You could never disenchant new Hall of Fame inductions for its full dust value. It was always just the full refund.
---
Hello Trollden
---
How about 12 mana, so at least you have to earn it with some extreme mana shenanigans.
---
I'm pretty sure you could
---
Ayyyy someone else who turns on "Show touch" in the Developer Options for moments like this
---
It makes broadcasting a phone to a TV and playing as a group so much better.
---
I’m running same list except for Argent Squires I have one Ooze and one Fan of Knives (rank 3). 
---
Ooze is a difference maker against other rogues as well as helps against bomb warrior.
---
Fan of Knives on the first Whispering woods always wins me the game agains Token druid.
---
People want to be able to play wild and standard with w/e deck they want at no costs to them. It’s insane.
---
The moment the card was revealed it was obvious it’s most vital use would be preventing fatigue. Removing bombs or corrupted bloods from your deck was something to consider but it was clearly primarily an anti fatigue card.
---
Having the entire neutral card pool to discover from just means your deck quality is gonna be really shitty afterwards (besides getting an answer like this is suuuuper slow) so there gotta be a really good reason you want a new deck - and there just a limited amount of those.
---
Im guessing its the easiest win in your life with that starting hand.
---
Somebody set up us the bomb.
---
Token Druid, Tempo Rogue, and Bomb Warrior.
---
Thanks, that's cool to share the paywalled options with us broke Bois !
---
She makes games go 40 minutes and end it a draw. That is a new one
---
Anyfin Paladin in standard.
---
That would go against what was written in the [Year of the Mammoth announcement article](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/20475356/), where the last thing Team 5 wanted players to feel was the need to disenchant Hall of Fame inductees. Offering a full dust disenchantment would pressure players to do as much.
---
What you got there?
---
I’ve accidentally silenced my own minion before... no copy either... just silenced
---
He clicked the boars and dragged them to the warrior across the board from him. Anyway the boars have dire frenzy.
---
As had been pointed out tracking discards the cards you don't pick. The deck you are playing uses master's call to discover Jepetto
---
No the problem is we lost all good taunt minions the 3 mana drops are so empty now wich is so bad.
---
which means he can just hit up [hsreplay.net](https://hsreplay.net) and find out what every auto complete would be by looking at the best winrate deck for each class.  We can't provide that as it is constantly updating.
---
It definitely is. I was playing mostly BSM when token druid was good a while ago. In literally every logical way imaginable, that should be an absurdly easy win for BSM, but Soul of the Forest meant a deck literally built to survive aggro by wiping wide boards over and over got absolutely dominated by a deck designed to build wide boards over and over.
---
Well that's why standard exists.
---
Yes they don’t want players accidentally thinking they are usable in standard, but that is easily fixable by putting them in the “black markets section that makes it very clear these cards don’t work in standard and requires you take one extra step to get there so people don’t buy them on accident like they think is a fear.
---
From my understanding the first ten packs of any given set which you have not previously opened packs for should contain a legendary. And no, the only effect crafting a legendary has on pack opening is that you can no longer open legendaries which you already have.
---
just stolen steel yourselves a pair of sulthrazes and get those bad boys up to a hundred
---
WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS
---
Yup
---
So the one single counter to bomb warrior is banned because games go long.  Maybe she needs a slight change, like cant discover herself and cant be targeted by spells so she cant go infinite.
---
Or maybe aggro players should grow up, most timed rounds in other tcgs get a minimum of an hour per round already.
---
Zoo is extremely dependent on your opening mulligan, and keeping up pressure. Trading minions in efficiently to kill theirs so you can keep your other minions alive is also important, as is having an idea of what your opponent is playing so you can play around certain things (like keeping stuff to refill the board in case they brawl).
---
As for playing multiple decks, get Whizbang if you can. He can give you any of the 18 pre-made deck recipes, which includes Bomb Warrior, and I think it has Murloc Shaman. Not the most meta decks, but let you play multiple different decks for 1 legendary.
---
Are you using Walking Fountain? I once lost against a Shaman who summoned 6 Walking Fountains, 2 with Eureka from deck, 2 with Eureka from Hagatha and 2 from hand without spells. I just couldn't bring the ass down to 0 hp. Then I got hit with a bunch of overload damage spells and lost 24 hp in one turn.
---
They should remove the rush or windfury from Walking Fountain imho. 8 heal and 8 damage pretty much guaranteed unless there's a big taunt minion with at least 8 damage in the way.
---
How magic carpet is an actual real card is beyond me
---
Warsong Commander got nerfed because of [[Grim Patron]]. I miss it lol. Grim Patron worked exactly like it did in the Grim Guzzler section of Blackrock in WoW. If you fucked up and aggroed one, the entire room attacked you.

5/3/3 | After this minion survives damage, summon another Grim Patron.  
---
Speaking from my experience, you might be trading poorly. I know that when I first started out playing zoo/aggro decks. I traded too Much/ for too long. 
---
With decks likes that, you’re meant to trade minions and build a board until maybe turn 5 at the latest. After that you’re looking to end the game as soon as possible. 
---
It would be impossible to say without seeing you play. But try being more aggressive if you think that that might be the problem.
---
This is a bug that happens when you get your new quest during your match(So you play a match at 00:00)
