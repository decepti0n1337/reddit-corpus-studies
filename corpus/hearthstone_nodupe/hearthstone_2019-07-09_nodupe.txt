Just because a good draw on a single game can sometimes make the deck feel oppressive (what you described was the perfect opening hand?) doesn‚Äôt make it broken. 
---

---
It has plenty of counters from a myriad of decks available in ladder. And it‚Äôs by no means dominating the meta (its indeed very popular in legend, but still maintains a healthy win % overall)
---
But I get you, turn 4 MG sucks for sure, specially followed by CC on 5. But it is what it is.
---
---
---
Control Warrior is literally play the most obvious card in your hand each turn.  
---
I'd say it's one of the least skilled based decks in the game right now.    
---
The "knowing what your opponent is going to do" doesn't change for any class, it's just far less important for Warrior because they just have far too many answers and throw infinite generator like boom into the mix and large hand renewal like omega assembly and you end up with a deck that completely forgives misplays.  
---
There is a reason it's got the highest win rate and being a hard to pilot or skill testing deck is the opposite reason of why this is.  It's because it's incredibly simple and forgives misplays that lifts it's winrate so high.
---
2 mana, discard 3 cards? Finally, the support quest warlock needed!
---
Ah, just before Amazon Prime Day (15th/16th)
---
It is if you concede every warrior match.  
---
I find my enjoyment has gone up immensely once I stopped caring about Warrior.  
---
nothing feels worse than Dr. Boom turn 7 drop ... /r/fuckwarrior
---
Thanks for the Deck! I‚Äôve been playing a modified Resurrection Priest deck from March but I really like yours. I‚Äôll give it a shot! Yeah, warrior is a real bitch right now.
---
&gt; You will earn one Rise of Shadows pack for watching 3 hours of the broadcast
---
So like, half of 1 match?
---
^(Sorry, I'll show myself out)
---
Fun and interactive
---
What's the matter buddy? Feeling a little triggered still are you?    
---
All that you have left is personal attacks that you aren't even mature enough to direct at me personally.  
---
You sir, are the definition of pathetic. ;)
---
Like Boom, Hagatha and Zuljin?  
---
Sure thing, that would improve the game quite a bit actually.
---
No he got haro'd because he didn't
---
Then I got no clue. Weird ass play
---
7 cards really - coin, book, AI then 4 conjurer's callings if you count twinspell.
---
Now I totally want to try this Violet Illusionist, Auchenai _whatever_, and every possible "add a random dragon/legendary to your hand" in the hopes of getting Nozari.
---
_Thanks for wasting my entire evening._
---

---
Just do what I do and support all of them
---
Totally disagree with the 1st, 2nd, and 4th thing. As for the 3rd.. it‚Äôs not the same for any deck. If your opponent is playing Murloc Shaman or Giant Mage for instance you can know what they‚Äôre gonna do but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Those decks just kinda throw stuff at you and you either answer it or die, that‚Äôs it. At least for the control warrior, like I laid out, there are decisions to make. As a control warrior you do have have a lot of value, that‚Äôs one of the decks strengths right now, but in the mirror that‚Äôs not so relevant. Again the more relevant thing is figuring out your opponents deck type and playing accordingly.

gnomeboi#11917 NA 80g trade :D pls show I will too
---
Wow, you've sold me. Do you have a list I can use? I really want to get past rank 15 this month!
---
To clarify what's going on, I'm getting kicked out of matches on my phone each time
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
a) I switch to another app, even if just to read or send a text for mere seconds
---
b) I swipe from the top of the screen to access the Notification Center or swipe from the top right to access the Control Center.
---
c) I receive a phone call, even if I choose to ignore the call.
---
I am kicked from the game and sometimes offered the ability to rejoin the game seconds later. Usually though no offer is given and I eventually lose the match due to being disconnected from it for too long. If I close out the app and attempt to restart, sometimes I am given the chance to rejoin but other times the app crashes attempting to do so.
---
If the gif wasn't obvious, I'm playing on iPhone. It's an iPhone X with a latest software iOS update using the latest updated Hearthstone patch.
---
Rush is good because of the hero power. It makes the microbots good and makes discover a mech stupid good. Without the hero power rush is much worse. It only lets them value trade because the hero power gives them infinite value.  You cant trade cards you don't have.
---
You can't blame someone who's commited to a class for only play 1/9 of the game, for a F2P player it's nearly impossible with the current format to sustain 2 or more classes at the same time, not everyone will play 4 hours a day to maybe reach 30 wins and get the ceiling of 100 gold, by the time they be able to craft a 2nd decent tier 1 deck  the meta would have changed with a new expansion, playing with one class allows you to stand against a settled meta.
---
It was supposed to have been fixed in the most recent patch (for me anyway and many others).  
---
I suggest going to the forums and logging a bug thread saying you are still getting it.
---
r/thankskhadgar wait
---
I feel similar but I'm prob just going to leave my PC streaming it all weekend while I'm doing other stuff. I'll probably just turn off the monitor while I sleep or while I'm out
---
I'll be sure to do that, thank you!
---
I've always wondered if you could make a ton of accounts and make them all maybe for a couple classes so you're always up to date with the meta. A lot of work, but if you're f2p I would imagine it's actually nice?
---
Git gud
---
I realized pretty soon that the only way it was at all possible to keep up was to just stick with one region.

---
I saw someone else post something about this... and I‚Äôm having the same issue on iOS. I think I read somewhere that it was fixed on Android recently, hopefully that means an iOS fix is coming.
---
I mean OTK pally is the nuts against mage and that includes double of the "laughingly bad"?? Shrink Ray.... which is actually insane once you use it after they've conjured calling.
---
Immunity is literally just can't be targeted and can't take damage combined.
---
They changed that like 3 months ago
---
You can't target immune enemy characters, but you could destroy the enemy hero with Mecha'thun or heal them with Tree of Life, for example.
---
I think any Warrior players eliminated from tournament can only be good for the enjoyment of actually watching the matches.
---
I was about to concede but then I didn‚Äôt and that was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made in my life
---
Yeah. That‚Äôs basically what I ended up doing. Would you mind checking out the new version? I posted a link on another comment.
---
They don‚Äôt. Cyclone mage has a bunch or spells
---
I was excited until you said it has to have a display. I just want to talk to Google assistant about hs cards via Google home. 
---
'what's the name of the 4/3 silence minion?' etc.
---
So Zalae is doing a charity stream where donators can get cards included in the deck. Naturally the deck is absolute hot garbage. 
---
The turn before was Millhouse Manastorm into Shadowflame to clear the Rogue's board. https://www.twitch.tv/videos/450107789?t=03h06m28s
---
how did you get two copies? do warlocks have access to copy cards i am not aware of?
---
Always happy to see Frodan
---
See you have [[conjurer's calling]] but no big minions to use it on. The real strength of that deck lies in dropping an early [[mountain giant]] or [[sea giant]] or [[rabble bouncer]] and then conjurer's calling that for value.
---
So if you want the deck to focus on minion value, you want minions that have a high mana cost but which can be played earlier. (Honourable mention: [[former champ]])
---
Now if you do not want to focus on minion value, but want to burn the opponent down with spell value, the deck cannot work without [[mana cyclone]], since without that card, you run out of steam pretty quickly.
---
As someone said above, [[mana wyrm]] has become more or less unusable now, so no point in running that. [[Sorcerer's apprentice]] is good so you want another one in your deck. And finally [[arcane explosion]] mostly deals 1 damage to 3 minions. It is extremely rare for it to be used on more than 3 minions. So might as well run [[shooting star]] instead.
---
Unimportant, but it's stealth+no damage taken because it overrides taunt

I am f2p and I have 5 strong classes and a 6th meme class at all times. I sacrifice the cards from druid mage and warrior to craft the best decks I can for my 6 classes.  I save 5000 gold between each expansion and I've never had trouble crafting good decks or hitting Dad legend
---
They fixed it?? THANK GOD.
---
Its almost a Jaraxxus, actually it would be a bit OP
---
This is the wrong way to look at it though. The coin isn‚Äôt really a full card, and the cards that were discarded could just as well have been on the bottom of his deck. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it still sucks, but not nearly as much as your comment would suggest.
---
Sounds amazing, fuck Haro

So, looks like Australian residents aren't eligible which might've also been true for the last Twitch Drops event because I didn't get any rewards.
---
I did get them for the original World Championships event though... anyone have any insight into the inconsistency?
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm kinda new. How do you make a deck code?
---
best RNG on ladder for me was opponent went khadgar and conjurer's calling on a 7 drop to give himself 2 baron geddons and 2 worgen abominations. they cleared his own board lol
---
Same principle, different method:
---
Using the second starting deck for Hunter (secrets/spells), take the 1-cost hero power. Reduce the cost of your hero power and cards as often as possible from your loot, then take buckets with secrets and draw. 
---
I beat the triple-cast shaman guy with no issues for the first time. It was crazy.

You can't compare cards between classes like that. I get it, you probably hate Conjurer's, but that kind of attitude that everything is pointless when it exists is not useful.
---
I'm surprised they didnt change the demon tag.
---
If anyone is wondering. I had double battlecry anomaly. Googles and elixir of vial (the one that lets you draw 3 each turn). I had pogo and lab recruiter as right hand men so they always started in my hand so I could start shuffeling turn 1. With few more recruiters and shadowsteps/pick I got poggos to 20+ by turn 4-5. It was super easy and fun run:)
---
Hello, I am still unranked (rank 39). I am enjoying aggro/mid-range gameplay even though I'm still exploring the game. I am currently using a non-complete version of Classic Warrior. Even though I want to get to level 25 to get all the free Classic packs I was wondering if any of the following legendaries are worth something or can be disenchanted freely towards getting a solid Classic collection:
---
\- Shudderwock (seems fun but I know the deck for it is expensive)
---
\- Millhouse Manastorm 
---
\- H'reek the Bat 
---
\- Whizbang the Wonderful
---
But the Chinese don't care about smut, their games and websites are filled with it.
---
They changed her flavor text, too.
---
OP is specifically referring to the cards that received new art, such as Secretkeeper, Succubus (now Felstalker), and Queen of Pain. As Abusive Sergeant didn't receive new art, his sounds haven't been changed.
---
Oh damn man
---
I don't know if you've looked at Chinese games but they got tits almost hanging out. Chinese gaming websites have essentially pornography ads running down both sides.
---
Done with Brko01 thanks
---
he should have played around it!
---
The first deck that took me up the ranks was murloc shaman.. I don't know how effective it is now, but at the lower ranks it really out in work for me
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
Tis a cruel mistress
---
Completely wrong. You need to draw the cards so your giants are cheaper to cast. Burning 3 cards cripples the deck.
---
I haven't catched pilfer in gm but I'd guess it was teched for mirror matches.
---
Try this and change as you see fit, there are lot of variations of deck and all are good.

Nice calculation. Thanks.
---
That's what you call an ACE you were holding up your sleeve to take it out in THE MOST suitable time. Congrats!
---
That's probably why. You never had a chance, the game was rigged from the start.
---
Its never too late.
---
Now if you repost it 18 more times someone might finally care about it...
---
It depends how many cards you have. If you're new enough that you haven't bought 10 packs from each current expansion (since in the first ten packs of each expansion you're guaranteed a legendary) then do that.
---
After that, I'd personally save my gold for the next expansion, and spend it all at once on new packs.
---
First we'd need devs replying to posts.
---
Blame Blizzard writing (out of the game) and Sylvanas (in game). Players are once again hostages of Blizzard story
---
Made legend last month with murloc shaman. It works at all ranks
---
I could agree about what you said for the coin, but I don‚Äôt see how things can get much worse than discarding both cards that the whole deck is based upon on turn one. Hence the instant concede. If they had been on the bottom of the deck, 2 things would‚Äôve been different, he‚Äôd have more cards left in his hand to play with, and, in the event of a longer game, could have eventualy gotten to draw them and play them.
---
Man, this pic got me in the nostalgia. Popping out of 1K into this desert, going on an explore, screaming like a little girl and running when you aggro'd the trolls near the dungeon, dying to silithid because your stupid ass got curious. Good times.
---
Yup. They need to hire new writers and start killing off older characters, especially some on the horde side (gallywix was responsible for bringing up the possibility of weaponisation of azerite to sylvanas)
---
You earn 1 pack for watching 3 hours someone play. It's not much of a problem, but i'd rather complete 2 daily quests and buy a pack, 1 pack for 3 hours seems greedy
---
The play was 5 times better before you said that. It's still a funny play, but most people just assumed that you knew he had a Dire Frenzy'd minion in his deck and complimented you on remembering that. Sometimes it's better to not say anything and just let people see for themselves, all for the sake of non-monetary internet points.
---
I just pulled mecha'thun from a pack. Are people still playing it in standard?
---
I bet his next move will be to open the Dark Portal... again
---
Wait...a character who has been hanging out with the Bronzebeards and has defeated several Old Gods already doesn't know about them?  If I made a list of times Old Gods are openly referenced, seen, explained, or otherwise openly involved in major events in WoW I'd hit the character limit.
---
New goblin main city, give the gnomes gnomeregan back too

thats higher than i expected honestly!
---
As long as they don't randomly decide to shut down the servers what whatever reason, there will still be players in Hearthstone.
---
if the murder hobos are offered any kind of tiny reward, be it mount or armour, they will kill any voidborn god horror you point them at
---
*plenty* extra ?
---
How is that illogical when it is literally happening in the real world right now? Just swap shiny rocks for oil and old gods for global warming.
---
But everyone knows that
---
Kind of a weird timing tbh. When the new expansion is announced I become very wary of crafting. These new classics did not really entice anything so I don‚Äôt think a lot of people are trying them.
---
No, next rotation will happen around April 2020. Witchwood, Boomsday and Rastakhans Rumble will leave standard then.
---
I mean, since we've already fought three of them and Magni has been VERY clear about Azeroth dying, I'm pretty sure they know both of those things.
---
Relax, it's just shorthand for hero cards, since it's much faster to type. It's hardly a confusing term.
---
You don't get bulk discounts with gold, only if you buy packs with money. So it doesn't matter.
---
You can either spend your time farming gold in arena.
---
Or spend real money and spend your time playing whatever deck you want instead.
---
If you do happen to enjoy playing arena then all the better for you.
---
No I think the crystal ball is something you can just buy it at the dalaran grocery store and he means "Bought" in a literal sense.
---
Guess Plague Bringer made it because of all the people who ignored the change and forgot they used to play Vanish.
---
Kadghar never opened the dark portal, medivh/sargaras did

---
I mean, it's literally the only possible winning play regardless of what he did or did not remember about his opponent's deck. I'm not sure why he was getting props for it. What different choice would anyone have ever made? The other two choices are very obviously 100% losses. Whether he knew there were 8/8s in the deck or not, it was super obvious and insanely lucky.
---
*Up to 10. You get them one by one until you hit a legendary, then you start with different packs.

Just do the same tak deck as all the other rogues
---
I don't want all my information from twitch or Blizzard sharded with each other.
---
Do OTKs like Mechathun and Paladin DK still work though? Since they're not targeted? I've never actually seen that tried.
---
&lt;----- this long ----&gt;   
---
Time is relative, friend :)
---
i think the SI:7 infiltrator is a nice card. it has vanilla stats and a somewhat decent battlecry. the problem is, there are almost no important secrets that need to be countered. secret hunter has a very low playrate, which makes teching against it kinda stupid. mage decks dont need secrets to win and pala secrets never were strong enough waste card slots to counter them.
---
whitemane could be used in a combo. maybe with something like flark? dunno.. at least she has some potential.
---
but all other cards will pretty much vanish into non-existance.
---
When burgle rogue works, shit gets out of control and your opponent gets yeeted out the tavern window.
---
The other 97.5% of the time it's good for a laugh and practicing your sprocket -&gt; concede APM.
---
How about instead of just fucking over the horde every expansion we just stop turning their leaders into corpses it fucking villains every expansion?  
---
This alliance dick stroking the story has become is obnoxious.
---
This is my problem. I haven't been doing any quests because I'm having fun with the single player. Going to hurt when the next expansion arrives and my gold supply bottoms out.
---
Alright thanks, any tips other tips for a beginner?
---
Would you have a decklist for that Control Warrior build? I am trying to put that deck together but elysiana is one card I dont have
---
I don't really understand how that's possible. Don't you run through your outs? You know you have nothing to do but hero power. When you hero power, you know two of the options always lose. So you just always chose the card that does something just in case. This seems completely unmissable to me unless you just concede without even bothering to hero power, which is blatantly wrong since Zilliax is a super obvious extra turn.
---
Bummer. I thought about that. I am saving up gold for the last wing of the heist and hoping my gold pack includes something.
---
This is it, this is the post where i finally realized i have stopped playing hearthstone long enough to be completely out of the loop üò≠
---
and its something youre only really gonna play when youre winning anyway if you do use it most of time
---
And the fact that Big Priest's winrate is so low gives indication of how fast the format is. Either you figure out a way to end the game by turn 8 or sooner, or you straight-up lose in that format.
---
G'huun isn't a real old god.  The titans made him to run experiments on.
---
Well the city apparently has no where for anyone to live. None of the cities in WoW had adequate housing. They simply make enough buildings to suit their needs.

You seem to be aggressively missing the point. Enjoy the gimmick deck until Calling gets nerfed.

I guarantee half of Radiance's 0.2% is from people who forgot to swap it out after it auto-replaced Mind Blast in their decks.
---
RIP Secretkeeper
---
Maybe the true crime city is....beneath?
---
Huh?
---
Part of what makes delivery drone so good is the mech you discover is removal no matter what because of rush and then with chards like the 1 mana get 3 mechs, you have more than enough removal to deal with every threat in the opponent‚Äôs deck to the point it‚Äôs near impossible for them to stick anything. Rush for all your mechs needs to go and Mad Genius would lose a lot of what makes it OP.

cool still wont watch it though.

If they ever update the zone I imagine they will. [Bilgewater Harbor](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/f/f8/Azshara_070910_133311_-_Bilgewater_Harbor_-_Kirkburn_12319.jpg) is a wow town that looks more like the hearthstone version of Gadgetzan, and it's ten years old now.
---
Based on the given list, I‚Äôd say run luna over one of the secrets, probably entity. Also squeeze in ice block if you can, it provides a ton of reach.
---
You have 2 omega assembly and a deck full of mechs. Rush is absolutely what makes the card OP. Delivery drone is just icing on the OP cake.
---
Honestly I was just hoping for a ziliax, but when I saw the choices I'm just "fuck... wait, no fuck..... WAIT!"
---
It started off as an elemental shaman and then I decided to add a dragon package with Firetree, Scaleworm, Twilight Drake, Crowd Roaster and Primordial Drake.  And my hare-brained idea was that since Scaleworm was a beast, and I was already running Nightmare Amalgam and wanted to run Krag'wa because of Shudderwock and Unstable Evolution, I squeezed in Corridor Creeper and to be even greedier, Untamed Beastmaster.  Sometimes Mountain Giant was in it since the deck often played with a large hand since lots of the battlecries added minions + Hagatha + UE.  It was lots of fun, lots of decisions to make and the win rate was ok.

Yeah. I posted an updated deck list with giants on a different comment thread.
---
Some people play it with wild pyromancer
---
What about wild? Do you think these new cards will be impactful in wild? Again and again and again we are playing against Big Priest, Odd Paladin, Odd Rogue or Cycle Mage.
---
I used to only run it because I hate playing warrior mirrors and this used to be an autowin in the mirror, but ever since they started running bombs even in control warrior it got a lot worse, you're better off with Elysiana. I'm just stubborn and I like Mecha'Thun.

Glad you're having fun! 
---
DON'T BUY PACKS IT'S A TRAP!!!

Yeah lots of people are responding with bosses that are *hard* but carousel isn't hard- it's *annoying.*
---
Still loses to Dr. BOOM
---
Playing Book in a Cyclone deck is bad period
---
Animations suck if your OS sucks and my OS sucks more than most.
---
The worst thing is when you have your turn planned out, step by step, but you can't get it done because you are waiting for animations to resolve.
---
They bumped the level of the booty bay guards for a little bit... at least for BC they did. I remember because I was farming the guards for bloodsail rep... logged in after the pre-patch to some... unpleasantness.
---
They did it before
---
Remember Ragnaros the Lightlord?   
---
They've said a couple times now that Hearthstone is a hub of "*what ifs*" and "*alternate history*", and that expansion is one example of that. In Mean Streets that town has grown and expanded by a lot compared to the one in WoW.
---
Clear your quest logs boys. It begins tomorrow.
---
I don't like it when people put ads for their channel in this subreddit...

I play mostly constructed and not so much arena and hit legend a couple of times. The rng factor is huge in this game its not like you dont need skill but you need luck and skill in this game. Not even progamer can have 10+ arena wins every run sometimes you just get screwd its all about grinding. As a skilled player you can always make a profit with +4 wins or higher but you can win consistently over 8 wins. So as a skilled Player youll always profit in the long run but you can be just unlucky thats how the game works. Its a card game where every card you draw is pure rng you can make the best out of it (which is skill) but its not like you can win just by skill even the most Effects of cards are pure rng and thats how the game works so i dont think the coin is an issue at all. You may start first but you didnt get a 1 drop you may start second but you got a 1 drop.
---
isn't donatello + shredder just slash?
---
God. "Play Tavern Brawl Event to get Card Reveals!"
---
Spoiler alert: The dates for these Card Reveals have already been decided. And the "progress" bar showcasing our progress is a load of complete bunk.
---
Just give us a card release calendar, please.
---
Here's the short movie: https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/1148638539195834368
---
You! You are good.
---
I would prefer golden Ragnaros+Ragnaros Lightlord+Warrior Quest instead of a cardback.
---
Are there any cool, fun or interesting mechanics that didn‚Äôt quite make it into this set?
---
Like, any card abilities that were just too powerful or didn‚Äôt quite fit the theme. Would love to know.
---
Would you consider making playable heroes as rewards for beating single player content in Savior's of Uldum? Similar to how Arthas was a Heroic reward?
---
Total bullshit this game is dead
---
huzzah!
---
Are all the cards being revealed from the Fire-Festival community challenge common cards?
---
Same time they make announcements
---
What was your favourite Quest to design?
---
I think there will be a lot of diversity as most people just try to play for one win. Then if you queue up your top tier warrior deck and play some rank 25 ogre deck then you have to play with that the next game. So it would take a lot of people losing with s popular deck for it to take over.
---
Any chance for possibility of obtaining currently unavailable cosmetics - cardbacks and heroes - in the future? I know that  Fest-Evil brawl has Ragnaros cardback and this is an amazing first step, thanks for that.
---
Counter has to be a keyword so it can have mouseover text afaik
---
Did you read anything about 2x gold in the announcement?
---
TLDW:
---
Event starts July 10th at 10am PT and ends July 31st at 9am PT.
---
Finally the  true award for beating people with my jank theif priest deck shall be had, you all shall have to play it!
---
It was said in announment video. He plans to unleash all the plagues and destroy the whole world.
---
I bet we'll see them revealed in a Developer Insights video
---
No, I must have missed it.  What did it say?
---
There are plenty of others that cost money, excuse you
---
I'm not sure those are coming back or not.  [Didn't see it listed on the announcement page.](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23051710/join-us-for-the-fire-fest-e-v-i-l)
---
That's what I was thinking for that entire time
---
How did your designers at HS create Reborn? Where there previous key-word ideas?
---
Do you guys intend to continue the dual tiered pre-order packages?
---
I know its not for everybody, but I really like guaranteed golden legends.
---
Put another way, can we expect uniformity in pre-order deals in the future?
---
Why did you decide to go with an established team for the heroes instead of a crossover team (like the villains)?
---
I do, but tell that to all the people who don't know this is coming tomorrow who are going to lose their quests. Even HotS - the game everyone memes on for being a completely dead game - has an extra slot for event quests. How does Hearthstone still not have this?
---
Entrance animations, hero power animations, emotes, board corners, music, alternate card art, etc. Those are just off the top of my head.
---
Okay, I get why the secret keeper art was changed. It was too much, and I love the new art. The problem I have is with the change of Deadly Shot art. The card art for Deadly Shot was perfect. It captured the essence of the card, and what it does perfectly. An arrow through the heart, deadly Shot.
---
Why change it?? The new art for Deadly Shot is just bland, and it does not showcase what the card does like the older version did...
---
Have you guys ever looked back at doing multiclass cards again like MSoG? If you did, were there any that were such a problem that you just said "NOPE, EFF THAT!"?
---
I am expecting the shaman one will be devolve effect for  for all minions
---
Are there going to be more mechs?
---
actually it's possible just type "artist:" then the name
---
Not Uldum specific, but what are some engineering nightmares that stuck out while developing the cards?
---
When can we expect New modes and features??
---
If I could award you for this comment I would. From 11 year old me to now that was pretty much it.
---
QUEST, INSECT!
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Imma not bother trying to explain cause and effect.
---
Priest got another Board Clear spell, and it's necessary for the class because historically priest has been always combo/control oriented, the lack of these control tools and win conditions cards on the evergreen set always affect the performance of the class post rotation (now more than ever with mind blast Hall of Famed), for this has been necessary for the upcoming expansions to print Board Clears and some other strong card to fill that gap, making of Priest almost a problem by the end of years, not to mention wild.
---
In WotOG It was in 8-9th place in popularity terms with only one tier 4 deck with 45% WR (Control Dragon), 
---
In Ungoro It was in 6-7th place with one tier 2 deck with 50% WR (Silence),
---
In WW It was in 8-9th place with one tier 2 deck with 51% WR (Control),
---
In RoS It is in 8-9th place with one tier 3 deck with 47% WR (Mech),
---
The pattern seems to repeat with every rotation, with no strong minions, Priest has need to rely on these spells to stall the game until the combo is achieved, Is there any plan in the future about buffing/fixing Priest's Basic/classic set, or add a Board Clear like other combo/control classes have?
---
Wait why is it an old cardback for such a cool event?? I already have it...
---
I'm glad to see another round of Quests being attempted as I think there is still potential in that design space for interesting cards.  Prior pain points for quests was the loss of a turn one play/card for tempo or board decks, as well as the large cost of the Reward in mid game after being behind on tempo meant the Rewards really needed a comeback swing to be useful. I see the Quest Rewards no longer have a cost and instantly activate which is a neat change to alleviate that, and the new 2 drop neutral helps replace the missing card in opening hand. The only other fear with successful quest decks is when metas become solidified, the games with Quest decks naturally feel pretty same-y because of always playing the same handful of taunt minions early or bouncing the same minions to hand.
---
**Can you speak more about some of the lessons learned from the first round of Quests in Un'Goro and what other design measures will be introduced this time?**
---
It seems a lot more polished than year‚Äôs in the past. Hopefully this means we won‚Äôt get any more awful ‚Äú2/3 Ragnaros Hops around the board and murders you‚Äù brawls.
---
Is Reborn only a mechanic that undead/mummy minions have access too?
---
The golden cards can basically be counted as 2 free packs.
---
I remember when the original Fire Festival (which added special effects to the main menu!!) was a pretty big deal all within itself, despite simply being a few new quests and a Tavern Brawl. I'm glad to see that Hearthstone finally appears to be building on its foundations (gradually)
---
No friends play hearthstone anymore, need to buff up the friends list because my spectate a friend and challenge a friend quests have been sitting in my inventory for awhile.
---
Roobadoo#1778
---
To be fair, everything is scaled waaaaaay the fuck down in WoW or any MMO for that matter.
---
Could just be a pet on the side of the board that you choose. Magic just added it to Arena and the whole subreddit is throwing a fit about how stupid they are and how they dislike the cat. Personally I'm indifferent to it/find them cute but that's the general perception right now. Which makes a comment about more cosmetics kind of amusing here.
---
I like that the co-op(?) fireside brawl boss counts as 500 boss kills so a group of lads can feel like they've really made a difference together! :D
---
Thanks Guardian!
---
I‚Äôm having fun with silence priest and will take a look at your midrange hunter
---
I've been playing since the Rainbow cardback, and while I'm ok with their doing this, I do wish there was a way to distinguish the original 'monthly play' cardbacks from cardbacks that were re-issued, even if it was just a slight cosmetic change, or a year in the corner, or something you saw if you clicked your opponent's name. Not a big deal, but I know some of the original players will be annoyed by it.
---
When you send [[Vanish]] to Hall of Fame, you said that board clear is Rogue's weakness and Vanish "negates one of their intended weaknesses, reduces our ability to design towards their strengths, and makes it much harder for players to strategize against a Rogue".
---
But only a week later, you announced there're new board clear Plague card for Rogue.
---
Is there any reason you break so-you-called "class identity" or "consistency"?
---
Arena wins couting towards golden heroes was a good update, are you planning on giving cardback(or other) rewards for hitting 12 wins, hitting 12 wins with all classes, making the leaderboard, getting 12-0 with all classes also, would be a nice feature.

---
I‚Äôm colorblind and it‚Äôs hard to read the red health value even when I‚Äôm playing in the computer and when I‚Äôm watching the grandmasters game on my tv it‚Äôs nearly impossible
---
Using this image as an example

---
I can easily see the attack of all minions and weapons and also the Elven Minstrel health. 
---
However all other health it‚Äôs basically impossible to read, heroes health, minions health and weapon durability.
---
Is there any way to change for a different border color for these cases to improve readability? It would help a lot
---
Whenever I watch a GM game on my tv, I can only feel how much health each player has if I sit right in front of the tv :/
---
Aren't those time sensitive anyway?

Gratz!

Deck building on the mobile app is a huge pain, it truly is. You have to drag every single card and sometimes instead of dragging  you swipe a page etc. Is there any chance you will look into streamlining the process a bit more? What about building decks on a light weight browser web page and having it built in game when you log on?
---
Sparky uberthruster
---
4 months after the RoS AMA, do you have any updates for us longtime players about the improved game progression system?
---
Congrats!  Now the true challenge awaits you!
---
I FINALLY took down all Chapters as Heroic.  Best of luck to ya if ya venture to clear that challenge out.
---
Read some guides (see the sidebar) and learn the concept of who's got the beatdown. Get to know the opponents decks so that when they play a couple of cards you know what deck they're playing. Watch streamers who talk through their plays.
---
So that we can get a sense of how long it will take to kill 25 million Blackrock bosses for the upcoming Fire Fest-EVIL, how many total bosses have been killed in the Dalaran Heist since its launch?
---
Radiance win rates so low, can you imagine thinking mindblast is in deck as wincon and nope lol gg
---
Hey there, thanks for doing that AMA. I liked it last time when you did this so here‚Äôs my question.
---
Could you tease us by describing your favorite card of the set in a way that won‚Äôt make sense to us today but will for sure the day we get our hands on it?
---
Or you could not be on r/hearthstone all the time and not have played for two days.
---
&gt; 1) Does Reno‚Äôs magical crystal gun have a name?
---
Infinity Gatling
---
Seems like an idea that could be done in a snap. Might cause some blips in the game though.
---
I know this sounds salty and in the grand scheme of things it affects no one but myself, I'm not really pretending this has a greater meaning, but opposite to you, this is the moment I quit playing and supporting Hearthstone and its content. The continued decisions to impoverish the classic set that players like me with limited disposable income rely on to even *participate* realistically in standard has finally driven me away from the game.
---
In particular, their treatment of Priest, my favorite, "go to" class, has convinced me that Blizzard does not and has never had the interest of players like me on their mind. An already weak baseline set has been slashed using baffling logic, setting the scenario for an arms race (win conditions are only found in expansions, and if they ever fail to print any, the class is doomed to be unviable for months) that I can't lend myself to. I simply don't agree with the direction they're taking, and whatever improvements we have seen as of late don't make up for the fact that I feel disenfranchised.
---
Double gold would have been nice, but this amount of content is much better I must say
---
This is not a normal game. This is the Dalaran Heist solo campaign. Your get treasures like that card at some points during your run.
---
I second this, i'm just gonna spend 5000 thousand gold and that's it, no more support for Blizzard until they do something  new/special/whatever
---
No, no, you got this all confused, it's not about showing them to others, it's about seeing your own tummy and toes at the same time.
---
Don‚Äôt forget about the second Traveler book. It describes it as a massive city with several buildings
---
No. Just few days ago someone on this sub had "Play 40 KFT cards" quest yet undone.
---
people are allowed to be excited
---
Wait, is this card back a previously released one?
---
Hey guys !
---
I wonder if you internally have an "ideal lenght" for the average HS game, both in competitive formats like tournaments or regular games?
---
Also, if that's the case, how do you balance around that if the meta starts shifting too much away from it?
---
That card back is back!
---
Ah ty
---
Do you think the design space on giants with variable cost is exhausted? Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the last giant that a variable cost changing mechanic was clockwork giant.
---
All recent giants would eventually go down to 0 mana and then stay there
---
Heroes in a Hearthstone...
---
Is there a way to purchase coins if you're region isn't eligible for it?
---
How does one end with 5 gold left over? Same thing happened to me
---
I mean the event they just announced seems pretty new/special/whatever
---
Make a complete trash deck and then concede so other people have to play with it
---
Firesidegatherings.com
---
Some quests used to give odd gold rewards I believe. I've had that extra 5 gold for a while.

Reckless Experimenter was changed after Chakki found an "undesirable" combo using Spirit of the Dead. Before release, Experimenter used to kill minions immediately instead of waiting until the end of the turn. Using Experimenter + Spirit of the Dead + Knife Juggler + Dead Ringer meant you created a draw engine that dealt one damage and drew the copy of Dead Ringer that had just shuffled into the deck after it died to create an OTK. So we went back and changed Experimenter to destroy the minion at the end of the turn.

I totally get that and have no problem with people wanting old cardbacks. But it seems like this is punishing older players by not offering an alternative
---
It's okay. They censored it at the start with horrible art quality. I play his for 2 years and still have no idea what I'm looking at
---
We wanted the League of Explorers to fill in the remaining four classes after assigning the first five to the League of E.V.I.L. "CitizenDane" below is pretty close with their answer:   
---
**Elise** \-  Made a natural Druid with her early studies of Un'goro Crater  
---
**Brann** \- The giant blunderbuss he carries (not to mention super sweet Dino Mount) made him an instant Hunter  
---
**SirFinley** \-  Having apparently been "knighted" at some point became the Paladin  
---
**Reno** \- Well... that left mage.. this in turn led us to the "Gatling Wand" he carries, and he seemed to take to the using of magic in this form like a duck to water!
---
All good points. Nevertheless, 80 okay dollars for NOT a complete game every 3 months is not for me. I know people will just say "that's how card games work", but that is a logical fallacy. Just because people have been ripped off since inception does not make it okay.
---
While you're here can we get a small QOL change? Can we please see how much progress we have with a class to 500 now that it counts in arena without having to have 9 class decks in regular mode?
---
Hello, I would like to know if the team reads the theories about the next expansions. Has any been discovered before being announced?
---
Thanks!
---
   
---
Will there be a nerf missile launcher + venomizer?
---
Ha! That's awesome, thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; Also, tokens should be resummoned as tokens.
---
This is the kind of change that is extremely jarring to deal with. One that I don't agree with, either.
---
The "remove from graveyard" effect makes plenty of sense. I can get on board with that, and it seems like a very clean way of doing things. But this kind of effect wouldn't affect only resurrect effects. It would also affect returning cards to hand or to the deck. If you Psychic Scream a Shrink Rayed Zilliax that lost Divine Shield, should it be a 1/1 without Divine Shield when you draw it?
---
No, that seems unintuitive to me because they've already defined how these stat changes work.
---
If you make it exclusive to the graveyard then you're making a weird inconsistency, and that doesn't help either.
---
Damn that's an astute observation.
---
Will this single player campaign be free? Or will it be purchased with money / gold?
---
Personally, I thought many of the old Adventure scenarios were more fun and memorable than any of the random roguelike bosses. I prefer crafting my deck to beat a specific challenge to high rolling drafts to make a deck that‚Äôs even more broken than my opponent. If they insist on doing the roguelikes, then they could at least let us accumulate a single-player card collection with them that we could use for deck construction. 
---
   I would also like to be given a map that could be explored for different encounters and rewards, and with some encounters not even having bosses but being more like Temple Escape or Mine Cart Rush from LoE. They should also try to make it more of a story, with actual scenes in between levels and interesting non-combat choices to be made that are actually thematically appropriate to what‚Äôs going on, instead of breaking periodically to go to the bar.
---
  Also, they could allow playing these to help us grind gold. How about levels of a sufficient difficulty contributing to our 3 wins/10 gold?
---
We've continued to keep an eye Zilliax since its release and we're comfortable with its place in the current meta. It's used in a variety of decks, but plays different roles in each. We intended for Zilliax to be a card that showcased the **Magnetic** mechanic and are happy that it's been able to do so. We'll continue to monitor its power and place in the meta, but are pleased with it overall.
---
Also unintentional. I'm not familiar with him or his standup though I did see it suggested I think on Netflix. Any good?
---
Hell no thats the exact opposite of what needs to happen and it would upset a majority of horde players.  Just kill self-insert Nathanos Blightcaller, stop with the stupid ass "Morally grey" Sylvanas bullshit and make her a good character again and everything will be better.  If she actually has a redemption where she doesn't get cut or stays behind or some dumb shit like Illidan and actually remains as an NPC for future expansions it'll be fine but I'm tired of this god awful writing.
---
This. I've been asking myself if I like this new cohesive story, and a part of me loves it  while the other just wants to explore different stand-alone stories like the other exps
---
VPNs I‚Äôd imagine
---
I killed him for that sweet Cutting Edge achievement.
---
So, to me it sounds like this led to Spirit of the Dead being unplayable. Damn you Knife Juggler.
---
I thought she was only a novelist to flesh out the story line for what has already happened. So she's potentially responsible for what happened with Syvlanas and such?
---
Just curious, does anyone have any idea where you might be able to listen to the background music, if it's even available for public listening? It's really nice.
---
I'm not sure about Mac but on pc and tablets you need to double click the "1 pack @ 100 gold" button.
---
Arena can pay off at times. It takes a bit to get good but once you are at it each run will get you more bang for your buck. I usually oscillate around 3-4 wins which doesn't waste any of the gold, but at some times I go to 5-6 which usually gets me enough money for extra pack. Imo it's best way to get cards in Hearthstone
---
i feel like brightwing is just a card that would be good in almost anything. great filler card
---
Will we see any Transgender or Non-Binary characters added to Hearthstone? It'll be so cool to be able to play as an LGBTQ+ character that's solidified in more than just my headcannon.
---
I quit playing arena after I rounded up the number.
---
Yup and Yes ;)
---
Reno has recently taken an interest in magical items. The more powerful they are, the more he likes them! The Gatling Wand might be his favorite, though.
---
Yea but you could've put your time elsewhere instead of watching a stream for 3-6 hours.
---
Absorbing* arcane stuff
---
Until someone AFKs and the deck disappears, only to be replaced with a terrible random deck
---
Mind if I ask why?
---
[[Quel'Delar]] (see bot reply below) -- although I don't think it's a collectible :(
---
hmmm... not this one...
---
Any particular reason Reno is a mage?

Hey!

What originally went into the decision to print quests again? Some mechanics have been completely abandoned after their initial expansion- And Although I personally love quests and am excited for their return (As a wild player) I wonder what is the reasoning behind it. Was it a thematic one, or wanting to shake up gameplay moreso?
---
Quests were also initially not exactly the most successful. Some were quite underwhelming, such as [[Lakkari Sacrifice]] , whilst [[The caverns from below]] ended up begin a major headache until it was rotated, with its polarizing nature and general un-interactivity. What makes you guys feel different this time around? Is it new support cards like [[Questing Adventurer]] , or the changes to the format itself (Instant hero power reward?)
---
Since Sn1p-Sn4p got echo and is technically part of the Boomsday expansion not witchwood, why not make Witch's Brew and Unstable Evolution have echo, since echo is not witchwood exclusive?
---
I think it would only be fair to prioritize the ones that see play the most. That way, even the artists would be glad that more people get to enjoy and appreciate their work. So going by HSReplay popularity of inclusion in decks, sorted from most to least:
---
1. Leeroy Jenkins
---
2. Harrison Jones
---
3. Edwin VanCleef
---
4. Archmage Antonidas
---
5. Alexstrasza
---
6. Ysera
---
7. Captain Greenskin
---
8. Tirion Fordring
---
9. Malygos
---
The others do not really see much significant play.

3/2/2 | Whenever you play a card, gain +1/+1.  
---
1. The minion that returns will still have the keyword **Reborn** on it. You can think of it like a **Divine Shield** minion that has its **Divine Shield** popped. It's still a **Divine Shield** minion, but no longer has **Divine Shield**. 
---
2. They do not. 
---
3. Yes, they count as summons.
---
4. Yes, the **Reborn** gets refreshed if it gets bounced and played again.
---
Reborn and Deathrattle together sounds prettyyyyyy scary!
---
With Card Art changes being confirmed for the future, will we finally see Malygos and Stampeding Kodo get correct art? What about updating really out of style art like Kill Command?
---
I understand how eternal formats work. I'm not one of those people who complains about it being unbalanced. I'm more concerned with getting to a point where they're making functional reprints rather than just actual reprints because the latter are often really fun and interesting in other card games for how iconic they are or by they give old cards a new context to explore.
---
Thalnos already his animation updated once though. That magic puff he gives off after death and before the card draw was not there before.
---
Yes.
---
I know this is a late response to this topic, but my 18 month old phone is now struggling to run Hearthstone. I have NEVER had problems before this. The longer I play, the choppier and harder it gets to select cards and target. It's brutal. I don't have a PC to install this game on, so if I can't play on mobile, I can't play at all.
---
Hopefully this won‚Äôt **bomb** like that *other* Fyre Festival!
---
Jokes aside, this looks really fun, especially that ‚Äúmeta‚Äù brawl.
---
Since this seems to be a point of confusion, are more Lackey's getting added or just more cards using the Lackey keyword?
---
As a wise man once said, "If i dont know what the hell im doing then theres no way my opponent will know either"
---
Yes. ü§´
---
Righteo.
---
In that case, yes I would rather just actual reprints. I wouldn't mind seeing the return of Sludge Belcher in Standard, for instance. 
---
I think this will happen *inevitably* with Hearthstone. But I do not think they will be doing this any time soon -- and I think the card game design is broad enough that they can afford not to for quite a while.
---
Hey, lemme check your sanity real quick...
---
Yes doctor, this one right here :)
---
Just prep vanish their board. 
---
^(kappa)
---
We call that shit cards.
---
That really doesn't make sense.  
---
Historically the classes with strong aoes, warlock, mage, and warrior have at least one in standard, but they're never enough for a control archetype. Big spell mage wouldn't of existed without dragon's fury. Odd warrior would of been much weaker without reckless flurry. Control warlock needed defile. Classes having board clears in standard set doesn't make them feel the same. Control as an archetype will always feel similar. Priest historically with the many AOEs we've had has still always felt the same. Its because board clears, regardless of functionally, fulfill the same purpose.  
---
I think not giving priest an AOE in their class set is what severely cripples them. The other classes that you call "boring" because of their evergreen board clears aren't boring because they have the same ones. They are just more consistent and have the functional tools to survive. Board clears are the dynamic part of control that will make them exciting, and I feel as if your justification doesn't work.
---
Replays plz
---
Statistically speaking, Barnes is kept in the mulligan 100% of the time and has a very high winrate when played on curve. I don‚Äôt think this creates a very interactive experience, hearthstone should be about decision making and having a card with such absurd stats exists is ridiculous. People ‚Äúlove playing Barnes‚Äù because often not they know they‚Äôre going to win, it‚Äôs not rewarding and it‚Äôs certainly not engaging. The deck is still playable without Barnes and I don‚Äôt see people shying away from the deck through a nerf. The deck will still do powerful stuff, yet it would lack such a problematic highroll as is Barnes.
---
I'm comparing win conditions, not cards.
---
Welcome to the game/community! There are 3 expansions per year and at the end of each year there is a ‚Äúset rotation‚Äù that gets rid of the cards from 2 years ago if that makes sense? So there‚Äôs set 1 2 3 in year A then set 4 5 6 in year B and at the end of year B all the sets from year A are rotated to wild. Then set 7 8 9 in year C and at the end of that all the sets from year B are rotated. I hope that makes sense..
---
It's a battery hog on my iPhone 6s but that's about the worst I can throw at it. OP might have it bad and be super unlucky, but OP also needs to get a grip with that "gamers rise up" stuff yeesh.
---
Lmao, I'm not seeing any streets
---
‚ÄúBuT tOaSt diD iT‚Äù is not a reason to push homophobic slurs.
---
maybe increase the number of playable cards or build around cards?
---
Witchwood, Boomsday And Rastakhan‚Äôs rumble will be the next 3 sets to rotate in April of next year. Rise of shadows, uldum, and the following set will rotate April of 2021. 
---
You came in at a good time. Rise of shadows is the first set of the year of the dragon, meaning it will stay in rotation longer than any other set during the year of the dragon. 
---
Unlike Rastakhan‚Äôs rumble which was the last set of the year of the raven and will only be in standard for about a year. 
---
Rotation rules are kind of weird to understand because of the wording. But you‚Äôll get the hang of it soon. All you need to know for now is that you won‚Äôt see any of your cards rotate for such a long time that you‚Äôll have a strong grasp of rotations by the time it happens.
---
only time i agree with you but+1 good written comment you got my frustrations very well worded out
---
Reno.
---
Murloc shaman (and murloc decks in general) usually depend on sticking some early minions that then get buffed by other murlocs so that they consistently have the board early and win through early pressure. They have some reload with cards like angler but are heavily dependent on getting the board early.
---
Token druid's main strength is it's repeated ability to flood the board, and then once they have a wide board capitalize with buffs. They can get early board tempo with stuff like acorn bearer and dreamway guardians but can still win without sticking early by flooding with cards like whispering woods.
---
Spell hunter has a lot more single target removal / early board control than it has aoe board clears that are more relevant against token druids.
---
Is this a sneak peek into the third expansion of 2019?
---
Gay and Trans characters existing isn't forcing it down people's throats. As a transgender/pansexual girl, I'm a human that exists that deserves to be represented in media as much as straight and cis people do.
---
When they did offer a 20$ preorder, it was only 17 packs (and of course no legendary or anything).  Barely better value than a normal pack deal, which are designed to be overpriced so that their sales look cheaper.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really sound like you love discourse tbh
---
ALso, considering the Niche Murloc mage has been rising in popularity over the past, like, 4 expansions at this point, will it maybe get a card or two of support? It's a fun way to play an aggressive burn mage deck without the OP 1 mana wyrm, and considering one of the Heroes is a murloc this time around, it seems like you could slip a mage-loc in without much trouble, flavor wise.
---
But that gave us Mecha'thun priest.
---
you put my impressions into words better than i ever could
---
Jump ship to MTG?
---
That's not how it works. You'd have to beat them with the trash deck in order to force them to play it.
---
I feel like murlocs are pretty fun
---
I think this would be brilliant! Probably a little weird at first, but could definitely keep the game lively during the off season. Would also allow the team to visit smaller locations and themes (like some of the adventures), exploring things like Mechagon or Uldir.
---
When the fuck did you have to think during Classic?  Value druid, handlock, and murloc warlock didn't have to think for shit lol
---
Nice try, Blizzard employee. You're not getting my sheckels so easily this time!
---
Trust me as a wild player I‚Äôm tired of big priest too.
---
The rotation to Wild only happens with the first set of the Hearthstone year: the set that releases in April.
---
Rise of Shadows was that card set, so the rotation this year has already happened.
---
The next set rotation will be in 2020 with the release of that year's first card set, which will probably be in April again. When that happens, all cards released in 2018 (the cards from Witchwood, Boomsday, and Rastakhan's Rumble) will rotate to Wild.
---
There is no compensation for cards from Standard card sets rotating out to Wild; you still own the cards and you can still play them in Wild. 
---
If however they choose to rotate cards from the Classic Set, which are supposed to be permanent, then they give you full dust refunds on the cards, and you don't even have to disenchant them (i.e. they give you a refund *and* let you keep the card).
---
Note: dust refunds only work for as many copies you have of the card that are allowed in a deck. If you have 10 of the same Common card, you will only be refunded for 2 of them because you can only put 2 in a deck. You will only be refunded for 1 copy of a Legendary. If you have both Golden and non-Golden copies, they will prioritise refunding you the more valuable Golden copies.
---
Does this answer all of your questions?
---
[removed]
---
Did you message the mods?  I wish your post hadn't gotten taken down, it sounds like it was much higher quality than most gripe posts (and there are tons of gripe posts, so idk why yours got taken down?).
---
I think complaining about not having fun when you could just not play, or play arena/solo content is more pitiful than people having fun on the ladder, personally. 
---
Take a break, metas get stale before a new expansion. If the constant whine posts towards the end of each expansion has taught me anything, its that complaining on reddit about not enjoying a game is much less productive than doing something else you enjoy.
---
