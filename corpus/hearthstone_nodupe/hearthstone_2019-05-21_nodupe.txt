Rogue has always been resilient to nerfs.  I predict there will just be a new meta.  When they nerfed Kingsbane (well, lifesteal), it barely fazed Rogue players.   They kept nerfing Auctioneer and it didn't matter.  Everyone thought a 6 mana 4/4 was unplayable.  And after all of these nerfs, Van Cleef is still the same?  Rogues will be fine.
---
If you were a returning player, wouldn't Zayle be an absolutely awesome reward?  Get a taste of the meta without investing any other dust.
---
Patience! Let the other decks brawl it out first, we've got a lot "year of the dragon" left
---
Rogue Nerf = Warrior Nerf
---
Warrior was the only class that kills Rogue. With Rogue gone, Hunter and Mage will destroy Warrior. It's not rocket science, it's literally explained in the official Blizzard blog post.
---
Control Shaman can play it twice essentially with Shudderwock
---
[[The Darkness]]
---
All of rogues spells are balanced around a 3 cost discount possibility. All of rogues spells are over-cost one now. ALL OF THEM. This is the worst change you could possibly make. Blizzard is trying hard to sell more cards by nerfing the ones you already have. It's ruining the game I might stop playing.
---
classic sets death by a thousand cuts :)
---
Prep has always been a problem card, look at how they've had to design cards with costs based around it. It had to be nerfed sooner or later, and it looks like they've decided to just take the pain now and open up design space in the future.

I hope so. Way too many people are playing Rogue right now it’s it’s feeling really stale.

Haha this won't effect me. I'll just play 2 preps before my spells now.

Prep is/was one of the strongest cards in the game.,.

That seems like a terrible idea that leads to seeing the same decks, strategies and cards ad infinitum.  I'm with Kibler on this one.

&gt;all demon buff cards for field say they "-to a **minion**, if it's a demon."
---
Mal'Ganis doesn't, off the top of my head.
---
And if the core set is too weak The moment a class fails to receive something as good as other classes in an expansion, which will roughly be 100% of the time, the class instantly falls into obscurity until they get something new and better
---
They nerfed Elysiana but not Boom LUL? Excuse me what the fuck
---
Yeah meme decks that still rely on prep for control and card draw the problem is prep was a design limiting card that were limiting good rogue spells at "fair" cost with prep everything felt smoother... I dont play tempo rouge and i also think that the other nerfed cards were the problem and definitely not prep yeah its powerful but only with good spells like for example raiding party which is nearly a sprint for 3 mana... With targeted draw... like wtf? And this into a 4 Attack rogue weapon... Idk what they thought about this
---
*shivers*
---
But let’s not nerf omega devastator 4 mana 4/5 kill almost anything.
---
shoulda specified jaraxxus hero. As in interactions with jaraxxus when hes already been played. Your interaction still works
---
Although you seem to be on my side, callbacks aren't reprints.
---
I remember the shaman boss on heroic who killed me with double crackle on turn 5
---
Lucky dog didn’t roll less than a 5 in 6 attempts but what surprises me the most is he realized his best play was a bs attempt for lethal
---
Same Brian Kibler that said Standard in HS wouldn't work because of the lack of cards? Because removing classic totally fixes that...
---
Looks like not even all the Brian Kiblers agree with each other /s
---
(They would have to release more sets to increase the standard cardpool if they removed classic, which would increase the costs and make more people flee.)
---
So what. The match-up against warrior is great, it can easily stand to get a little worse.
---
That thing kinda died when they said there wouldn't be a lot of nerfs after the game entered in open beta and changed their minds a couple of years after release.
---
The Darkness
---
That prep nerf makes me feel sick. I get what they’re saying about sap and eviscerate they’re right those interactions won’t change. But what about sprint and literally every single other rogue spell...
---
That's because it's not a nerf to make warrior weaker, but a nerf to make warrior mirrors more standable. Rogue's strength was a large reason why warrior was so strong, and with hunter/murloc shaman/mage on the rise after rogue's nerf warrior will inevitably get weaker. It also gives people an incentive to play control shaman, which is nice.
---
Yeah I'm glad I held onto my golden Preparation for almost a year. I knew eventually it was gonna be nerfed.
---
A standard with more cards is less predictable/doesn't get solved in a weekend-ish, which means more room for deck teching, countering the anti-meta decks that pop up after week 2, etc.
---
So what you're saying is that Rogue isn't actually all that dominant in the current meta. Looking at then tier ranking and see how healthy a mix of classes there are in the top two tiers right now. Only Paladin and Priest aren't too hot right now. This is one of the best metas we've had in a while.
---
He is right tho
---
Honestly, the sac pac interaction is fucking stupid too
---
Can't they make changes without fucking with more classic cards.  Prep being 3 less was not the issue.
---
If you buy them, and then sell it what happens?
---
Mountain Giant costs 3. Conjurer's Call costs 3. Where are you getting the extra mana from?
---
I’m just imagining a triple boom off of omega assembly into boom delivery drone. Can you discover the same mech on one assembly? I’ve never actually had the time to play warrior
---
A class’s relevance on a tier list has no impact on changing core cards that are integral to how the class functions. Odd Rogue was a tier 1 deck that didn’t run Prep. Spiteful Druid was a T1/2 deck that didn’t run ramp cards. That doesn’t mean that it’s healthy to destroy a class’s base set identity.
---
Player going second already has a lower win-rate.
---
Elemental evocation reduces giant by (1) mana.
---
It can't be from playing in another state. I've played several Blizzard games in several different states and have never had any issues with any of them.
---
Rip prep raiding turn 1
---
If you don’t get anywhere in like 5-7 days, file a complaint via better business bureau, and someone from Blizzard will contact you.

CrushBones#2723
---
So regarding dust. We don’t get given anything right? But we can disenchant for full dust?
---
&gt;A while now
---
You mean just this thread. Someone early said it, then the parrots started squaking to sound smart.
---
Or there’s just two people who are wrong
---
Just like nerfing Blade Flurry gave them a chance to deisgn cards without being forced to consider if they'd be too broken because of Blade Flurry. And what did that give us? 2-3 good weapons in 3 years? While other classes had more good weapons in a single year? Yeah, this is the problem.
---
Not to mention a bunch of classic rogue cards are now worse, with some being straight up unplayable.
---
I'm so glad I hung onto my golden Elysiana, had a strong feeling this nerf was coming. I mostly play aggro and midrange decks so now I'm wondering whether I should be greedy and get two other legendaries or rather just craft a regular Elysiana and one other legendary...
---
This TENDS to be the case in these “i got unfairly banned” posts, but im willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
And the best thing is: Shudderwock Control Shami is the only deck now that can do double Elysianna consistent :) except if warrior saves coin till turn 10 but i doubt they play banker or brewmaster now.
---
How has Zillax escaped nerfs again?
---
,
---
i do find it funny that clearly the opinion in this thread is that this is a joke and uncalled for, but the same opinions of that of those that support this company almost blindly.
---
Oh duh my bad forgot about that. Didn't realize that might be Khadgar in the ball. I just assumed somehow OP knew his name was Bob.
---
Thats the problem though. There wont be impactful spells printed. You may get 1 good 4+ cost spell printed in 1-2 years, and thats it, if you even get that. Its the same nonsense as blade flurry. While the spells that became a lot worse are not going to be buffed either. Sprint will stay unplayable, Vanish very situational and Fan of Knives relegated to a token meta.
---
Because I got significantly less invested in the game shortly after that and havent been able to keep up with building a meta deck ever since. Thats on me tho, not sure why you asked.
---
I think the worst thing is the lack of Warrior nerfs. The dev team was happy to see the death knights go, yet Dr. Boom is still insanely powerful and they still have tons of survivability. This is the same thing that made Druid so hated a while ago. Warrior just feels unkillable at times and that just isn't fun.
---
In what world was Preparation the single card that dictated rogue’s entire identity?
---
Sap, Backstab, Edwin, Eviscerate,  SI:7 all still exist. Rogue is still sneaky and tempo oriented.
---
No you don't lmfao if you had 3 elysiana's it would mean you would have every RoS legendary and then opened 60-120 packs extra and somehow got three elysiana's on top. Better chance of winning the lottery. 
---
If you had all of RoS and then overkill, you would also have the dust for MSoG in full
---
So you can’t prep raiding party turn one
---
Well, as Illidan once said, I am not prepared. And I never will again.
---
I have a similar thing going on. I'm deployed and I have yet to have any issues playing from another country and then from time to time forgetting to disable my VPN before logging into bliz servers.
---
Prepped sprint is now 5 mana draw sprint. Ew pre nerf Nourish
---
Nothing sadly. But Hearthstone almost crashed when I loaded into the next match.
---
I believe old-fashioned face Hunter still holds that record, something like half of the original deck has seen balance changes, with knife juggler, leper gnome, abusive servant, uth, buzzard, leeroy, undertaker, ect. All getting nerfed.
---
Midrange force-savage druid also has a high number, although only technically, because a lot of the cards in it that have been nerfed were nerfed retroactively.
---
It's not that they won't, it's just that they'll take their sweet time doing it. It is weird how there was such a long gap between the Flurry nerf and the "reasons" for it, so to speak, but it did happen. Can you imagine Kingsbane existing in the same world as original Blade Flurry? Or even Waggle Pick now? They took forever nerfing Prep thay're gonna take forever making cheap Rogue spells but it's gonna happen, and I'd rather they change things slowly then let the problem persist forever. And Prep isn't unplayably mad now by any means, I think.
---
So yes, I agree this should have happened earlier, but I'd rather it happen now than never. Rogue's classic set has caused issues overall by being so much better than most classes (Probably all other classes now that Wild Growth is dead) so it had to be knocked down eventually. This has the added bonus of making it harder to cheese games with massive turn 3 Edwins, too.
---
Man that fucking blows. I've played in different countries on different devices with no authenticator etc and never had an issue. Is it possible someone else has your account details and did something you're not aware of? I would definitely recommend calling them on the phone if you can, because it might be better if you talk to an actual person rather than use a text-based ticket on the website. With any luck, if this post stays at the top maybe a community manager or someone from Blizz will see it and help out. Good luck bro

ive seen it happen before. dont know enough about this to say either way

Is there something special I need to do, or just wait?
---
Uh, I'm pretty sure BGH is five mana. There is a reason he isn't played much even with Edwins and giants running amok now. He answers a giant one turn too late. They at least get one hit, probably conjurer's calling it as well. At that point you lose. For rogues, that Edwin is the least of your issues if you just played a 4/2 on turn five. You are not looking to slot in a dead card for potential payoff, when the payoff is not even really relevant as they have the second copy of CC in hand. You play this, kill one, they trade 8/8 (7/8) into 4/2, CC two more. Sapping slows you down too much. You cannot develop anything substantial while sapping a giant back that they will just play again next turn. Nevermind a Khadgar combo.
---
Lmao they're butchering Miracle Rogue through no fault of the deck. Just another classic Hearthstone deck getting the axe because of tempo.
---
Remember guys, there is no legal actions that you can take. This has been covered lengthy on many other types of games with the same polices and agreements that players accept before playing.  Just do a quick google search and do some reading.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
To the OP, I feel for you bro and hope your get your account back.
---
I’m literally 20 wins away from Golden Rogue. Gotta grind games quickly before the nerf!
---
I really don't care if they remove classic. Just give me a dynamic card slot for every card removed that gives me a free equivalent card for all future rotations.
---
But that would rob blizzard of money right, so it'll never happen. Thus, classic needs to stay.
---
I think they just didn't want people to be able to Brewmaster it same turn.
---
Warriors are teching 2 BGH. It does work, just... not all the time. It helps though.
---
&gt;Twice the amount of fun most accounts get
---
2x0=0 though
---
Oh if we're talking not top 3, Rogue isn't "good" most of the time. There is only one class that was almost always top 3, and that's Warrior in various incarnations.
---
Outside of the Molten Giant change revert, there hasn't been any cards buffed since the game's Beta.
---
The reason for this is simple: lowering the power level of cards will always have the desired effect while raising the power level of cards could just as easily break the game, necessitating a nerf, as it could do nothing, making the exercise pointless.
---
Inducting cards into the Hall of Fame is much more analogous to a Standard banning than a nerf as the card itself isn't changed, just removed from Standard.
---
&gt;What cards should be buffed in this expansion? 
---
Honestly, none of them. As I wrote above, increasing the power level of a card could do nothing, exactly what is intended, or break the game. The chances of a buff doing nothing or breaking the game is too high.
---
Prep has honestly been such a plague on Rogue. Every single powerful spell has been his with the prep tax and made more expensive. Hopefully future cards won’t be affected as much by it.
---
Yeah you might be right. I've only been banned by Blizzard once, and I totally fucking deserved it. I was a kid, like middle school, &amp; me and my friends were total cunts. We scammed people on WoW for thousands of gold by pretending to be selling codes for spectral tiger. We had a complex process for laundering the items and gold and would tag team our marks. It was pretty fucking sick and evil, but that is when I learned the true power of social engineering over the internet. 
---
Every other experience I've had with Blizz support has been positive. When I myself was scammed of items (by a former IRL friend no less) Blizz resolved the issue extremely quickly. 
---
Now I rarely ever play videogames at all, but when I do I have played hearthstone in different countries within the same week and had no issues like what the OP is describing. I won't be quite as quick to say he is lying here because I'm sure out of thousands of cases some things do slip through the cracks or the service rep is having a shitty day, but I agree that there must be something we aren't hearing about.
---
Your rebuttal a little too late
---
blizzard customer service good BTW
---
Its a 2 card, **0 mana** combo that tutors 3 cards that synergize with themselves. This part is important.
---
Besides the part about it being the only draw just being factually incorrect (Myra's), I dont see how it is relevant at all here.
---
Only took them 2 years to print one, and even then only Kingsbane and Waggle pick were actually good. Shadowboxes was just not worth playing, and Medium Blade was only a thing in Deathrattle Rogue for a bit, and that deck was as briefly a think as it was aggressively mediocre.
---
He literally puts "say hit to reddit."  Like, who the fuck is he saying hi to? Do you really expect a stupid online post to make a difference?  That line just reeks of pettiness and makes me roll my eyes.
---
&gt;  isnt it just common courtesy to so? 
---
blizzard tells the person they are banning why they are being banned.  however if OP is guilty, then it would be in his best interest to hide that message.  we as bystanders have no way to know if OP is lying.  is it possible that blizzard is lying? of course. is it more likely OP is lying? i'd say so.
---
Maybe OP did something wrong and maybe not. We can't know. Regardless, this is an unacceptably opaque explanation for an action taken against what could well be a paying customer. I'm sure Blizzard feels it must closely guard how it conducts investigations to prevent exploiters from adapting to their detection methods, but there has to be a way to provide more information when terminating accounts. Without it, none of us have any recourse whatsoever if we were to find ourselves caught up in that net for whatever reason.
---
Unity
---
Fan of Knives seems unplayable now.  It was always kind of a fallback plan in case you either didn't draw your 3-drop or didn't draw a better Prep spell.  Prep Fan does not seem like something I want to do anymore, now that it costs 1 mana.
---
blizzard isnt lying, they just havent said anything, again cause its all AUTOMATED, no one has yet to physically look at it. again never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.
---
This is an awful situation. I’m upvoting for visibility hopefully it gets resolved.
---
3-4 states? I’ve played in multiple countries within a few days of each other. Something fucky is going on.
---
Either of the shaman or priest card is on the field. 
---
You have a spell in your hand.
---
The spell gains twinspell.
---
You cast the spell.
---
It returns to your hand without twinspell.
---
The shaman or priest card then gives the non twinspell version, twinspell.
---
Repeat
---
Warrior right now is what is killing my drive to climb ladder, I felt like I had to build control warrior just to have a chance in winning any games. My friends borrowed to see what the issue was and he conceded our game because he said that it doesn't give a fuck what your opponent plays since it has basically all the answer.
---
My point was more that, there's no litmus test for this. Wouldn't the conversation go something like:
---
Blizzard: Our system detected these logins from these IPs in these locations, and that closely corresponds to someone trying to do X illicit activity. 
---
OP/Reddit: That's not proof, your pattern can be wrong.
---
And there's no amount of iptraces that Blizzard can show to op to say that no matter what they say, there's no proof they can provide that moves them outside of a category that apparently clearly labels them someone who abused the system. And there's nothing You, me, or OP can say to convince Blizzard that their system encountered a false positive, OP was just unfortunate enough to pop a red flag by playing at an unfortunate pattern that lined up with other behavior. 
---
This possibly is a false flag, it also is possibly a person pissed that their account was banned justifiably.
---
What do you expect from a small indie company?
---
So the prep change seems like an artifact of raiding party and has not been a problem before. Now this will also heavily affect sprint, academic espionage, walk the plank and fan of knives just to name a few. I feel like this was an unnecessary change that will make playing creative rogue decks much more restricted in the future.
---
How is it not obvious that he wants to get unbanned using biased information
---
The second part of your message is exactly what a canned response is.  It's pretty common practice for customer service to create a consistent or professional image in their messages.
---
Doesn't matter, still multiplied by 2.
---
But how in the world are you going to go up against your other account on the ladder? That’s like 1 in a million chance.
---
If you haven't seen them already, there are some very entertaining ones from Lyte, the one I mentioned that are easy to find, and they usually don't require any game knowledge to follow.
---
This is absolutely amazing, what a great job!
---
&gt; why Blizzard should feel the need to prove themselves to someone they've deemed a cheater.
---
Other than they literally do this on the WoW subreddit. There's even a specific GM that people call, much like Lyte from League. I believe his tag is Araxom iirc.
---
USA states is equivalent of EU countries
---
Me too but I only opened 3 ):
---
im ok with this
---
&gt; OP was just unfortunate enough to pop a red flag by playing at an unfortunate pattern that lined up with other behavior.
---
So then its appropriate to just stick with the bans? How often does a false positive occur? Is it worth it to ban someone who's innocent. And sure, when WE see the logs we migt not be able to deduce it was wrong but an actual human trained at blizz might be able to, and in the end is that what at least some of these people deserve? A once over by an actual human to see if this activity is improper.
---
He's the one that copies the first card you play each turn and gives you a coin.
---
So you either have to fill your hand with coins and burn cards, or spend half of your turn playing a coin.
---
It's incredibly hard to win
---
/r/quityourbullshit has quite a few of them pulled from other places.  People who were hacking but claimed otherwise, or said they said "gg ez" but were really telling their teammates to kill themselves.
---
You're welcome to do some research.  Or just wait a few weeks, they come up quite often.
---
I wish I could give you more upvotes for this. Wait... hang on... uh, OP?  How do I give this guy more than one upvote? Do I log in from my phone and tablet using a VPN all at the same time, or how does that work?
---
^((I didn't do it please don't ban me))
---
I had a good time drawing that, was so upset about mana wyrm's nerf, still hurts :(
---
No, I only ever play against my wife some times
---
Not necessarily, I can’t tab out of my phone for more than a few seconds without it timing me out or at least going through the “reconnecting to game” process. Not everyone plays on a PC.
---
Yeah I watched that toast video. Starting handed a 3 cost Baron Geddon and then drew a 2 cost Geddon. I don't get it.
---
A preponderance of evidence
---
Which... makes sense? Classic/basic are the first cards created an unsurprisingly, a lot of them ended up restricting design space, whether literally like prep and cheap rogue spells or just by being so powerful, new cards need to be absurd to see play over classic/basic cards. And without new cards seeing play, metas stagnate and people leave the game. (Oh, and Blizzard loses out on money twice, from people leaving and from the remaining players not feeling compelled to buy new expansions.) And because classic/basic cards are evergreen, the issues they cause don't go away. Like, if you look at MtG, yes they have more formats and their rotating core sets help solve some of these issues, but so many of the original/near original cards have never been recreated or rotated in because it just turns out they were too powerful due to a lack of balancing experience.
---
why is omegabalanced not nerfed lol? It's literally broken
---
I think the prep nerf is actually a decent nerf to a classic card for once. Now we just wait for Wolfrider and Stonetusk Boar to lose charge
---
Why isn't blizzard adding good cards to the classic set after taking so many good cards out of it? Of course the answer is greed. They don't want powerful cards that are evergreen in standard so we have to always buy more.
---
But preperation was a card which was played in almost every rogue deck, so i think in a longterm view this nerfs makes it easier for rogue to go for other decktypes then tempo, pirate or miracle.
---
And i think you still can play prep so...

---
Yeah why would you post a common scummy warrior video that we haven't seen 100 times before in the game.  
---
It's bad enough we have to play against Warrior let alone having the fuckers post shitty matches like this on the sub.
---
It's weird, it probably has to do with how auras affect discounting your deck, but i don't particularly know about that mechanic enough to make a more precise on my guess, and i feel that it's a headache of a topic to get into at 2am.
---
Yeah needed a nerf but not without changing basicly all Rogue spells balance around it
---
Yea, I had a similar thing happen for me. A secret played via shifting scroll.
---
Some kind of rank boosting service would be my guess.
---
yeah, and no hero whatsoever to begin a fifth one
---
Thanks for the info! The mechanics behind it are still confusing to me, but I guess the devs just made it to be generous to the player.
---
I had the 2 mana Hagatha spell that transforms all your minions into random legendaries and has repeatable this turn. Then during one of the barman sequences I made it cost 3 less.  So basically when I drew it if I had at least 1 minion on board and the ai didn't have a taunt I could just play it forever until I got enough king krush, leeroy, grom, al'akir etc to kill them. I beat the last boss evolving a full board to deal 70 damage total. It felt awesome.
---
Considering that [[Hungry Crab]] doesnt work on Morgl the Oracle... I highly doubt that this card would let you destroy a Goblin, just because that Goblin is in a mech suit.
---
I'm Australian, and I've played Hearthstone on my phone all over the world. Location isn't something they ban you for; I've played in the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, England, New Zealand, Japan, etc. There has to be something else going on here, some massive error on Blizzard's part.

So if I craft golden versions of these cards they get refunded and I get to keep the cards?
---
God fuck that guy
---
Yeah, I quit after Lich King, didn't play at ALL during Cataclysm, missed that entire expansion. Came back for Mysts to have some fun again, and found out my account was hacked. I got the account back myself, but I logged on and all my shit was gone, character naked, etc. Blizz gave me a bunch of stuff back. Wasn't really useful anymore, but getting the gold back was definitely nice.
---
The moment I thought "yeah this ban is probably deserved".
---
It's mobile tho. Should it still be there?
---
The mod is still fuming over fallout76
---
Blizzard admin is going to post and 🔚 this guy's entire career
---
Burgle Rogue is pretty good versus control warriors since warrior has so many health gain cards where you don’t need the weapon as much as well.
---
I didn't actually mean to type 3, I meant to type gold. was probably writing about prep but changed the comment half way through. will edit.
---
TL;DR?
---
Well, you better not get too attached to your cutlass against warrior because you're about to have 8 weapons in your hand.
---
I guess it's just karmic, given that I just received a Sylvanas from Toki...
---
Blizzard is screwing up with cards big time.
---
Well i JUST got my gold rogue and i don't generally play classes i have gold on ladder...so for as much overkill as nerfing prep and party is, i would've felt it a lot more last month. Rip wild rogue :/
---
Another example that Blizzard doesn't care about wild. I AM FURIOUS.

---
Dear Blizz,
---
I hereby give you permission to release the actual reason this guy got banned, 
---
Sincerely,
---
Everyone
---
Rogue following druid's path lol
---
Two less rogues I have to deal with!!
---
Why is this obvious bullshit my hearthstone listing on my Reddit fp?  Damn it, r/hs, get your shit together.
---
I have played Hearthstone on different CONTINENTS with no problem so yeah I really doubt that going to another state is really what did OP in.
---
You can grief in some 1v1 games tho, like refusing to gg in Starcraft for example when you clearly have lost.
---
No Dr Boom nerf. Seriously? Wowwwwwwwwww
---
I‘m a rogue main too, it‘s my first and only class to this date to have 500 wins on but this kills the class pretty much..
---
That's called bm, not grief.
---
Nope, sadly you can‘t dust him
---
EU 80g trade HugoOdaX#2647
---
The way I presume it works is that it halves the cost only when you draw it, but can do that first if that was you your first treasure, the scepter sets to 5 even in deck. That explains the Toast situation, but I don't know if it holds up against jousts and the like.
---
For the sake of variety on my YouTube channel, If you watched the video you’ll notice the deck list is different from the typical deck list. Hunter is also a tough matchup so I thought it was a worthy post.
---
It's impossible to know where you draw the line if you include indirectly nerfed cards. This one guy might have teches a black knight into his rogue deck  to deal with 7/8-taunts that he plays in no other deck, then there is this guy who plays wagglepick in a way other rogue deck without any of the nerfed cards would he also get a discount?
---
Isn't griefing considered bm though?
---
Did they remove BGH from the game or what?
---
The old 4/3 shredder was also a goblin inside a mech
---
List?
---
I thought when the email said  “exploitive play” it meant that they saw it as him sharing his account with someone in that state (aka someone getting to use his account for free)
---
I beat him yesterday in the most hilarious/tedious way. We both ran out of cards – I only had [[Elder Taggawag]] left, and he had one too (copied from my deck). 
---
So now we're stuck without fatigue, endlessly trading AoEs, I'm Mage, and he's got 45 health left. So I had to sit through 45 turns of pinging him by 1HP and then sitting there watching the Taggawags get shuffled into our decks.
---
So actually just the legendary weapon. which got nerfed.
---
I play Hearthstone on my Pc at home (with and without vpn).  
---
I play hearthstone at university with an Laptop/Tablet with vpn because its blocked otherwise.  
---
I play Hearthstone on my Phone on public wifi and mobile data.
---
So i am pretty sure that its not the switching or using vpn that caused this.
---
[removed]
---
Technically all natural cards could be affected by a class card nerf too. Where do we draw the line it we start refunding not only nerf cards, but those impacted too. I would take this as learning experience. As for me I oy complete decks I have most cards for, I wont invest more than one legendary to complete a deck maybe two epics.
---
If the Priest deck does not even appear on HSreplay, it's safe to assume few of these games are actually from playing Zayle. I don't think you can make any calls about it yet.
---
I've lost many times to 1st boss Linzi. She's really hard to beat unless you get a good mulligan. With the random decks its almost impossible to beat her.
---
That's worth thinking about. Do you run Brewmaster so you can replay something like a Devastator again? And about half the time you get to replay Elysiana. You would have to hold the coin though, and warrior has hand size issues.
---
This is flat-out untrue. Raiding party was insane as at 3 mana, regardless of prep. Same for evis, backstab, SI7, edWIN, shadowstep, etc.
---
Many of the lesser played rogue cards aren't even bad, they're just too 'okay' to see consistent play in rogue. (see: Sprint)
---
Hell, people stopped playing hench-clan thug because a 3-mana 4/4 just wasn't good enough. That's how insane rogues options are.
---
True i would not look over it again
---
This might get buried since I'm late, but here goes.    
---
  
---
YES YES SO much YES!!!  
---
I'm super happy when Blizzard decided to make changes and this was something I was hoping they would change going into the new year.  
---
I've done my fair share of hating on Blizzard when they make big mistakes, but I will be here to give them praise when they do things right. I would rather them make not so good balance changes to no balance changes at all (as long as they learn from the "not so good").  
---
Good job Blizzard!
---
Weird, I got the reduction on [[Witch's Brew]] and it didn't work on the echoed copies
---
Do I upvote for visibility? Do I downvote as OP is capping and being an asshole to Blizz CS? Hard to choose.

2/-/- | Restore 4 Health. Repeatable this turn.

Which is not easy. She's one of the hardest bosses in the run if she's the 1st one.

---
Mage, right now, has weaknesses, namely aggression, and this round of card changes is big enough as it is. Plus, Summoner Mage is falling out of favor next to Spell/Miracle Mage, which doesn't play Conjurer's Calling.
---
I can agree that maybe the Mountain Giant combo should be dealt with in some way (preferably without touching Conjurer's Calling), but outside of that particular use, the card is extremely fair. Conjurer's Calling being dropped on a Astromancer played on turn ten isn't breaking the game.
---
I see your Linzi and raise you the overload shaman.

---
Sure, it was only really crazy in combination, but the ramp existed first so it seems fair to say the new card was the problem.
---
As second boss she's much more manageable. As 1st boss you just need to get a good mulligan. All comes down to luck.
---
If scrolls of wonders is the only card in HS then it's also the only spell that it can cast.
---
Infinity loop time baby.
---
nah. control warrior is always answer to other decks. in this case, rogue.
---
Ave#2806 EU. Looking to trade 80g quests.
---
He'd still be super powerful with his +7 armor (LMAO) and 2 mana discover but not OP.
---
its heroic for a reason, it's meant to be really difficult. robes of gaudiness is pretty OP as well but nobody really cares much when they're on the winning end
---
I’d argue the reason is because either you’re facing a Rogue who will straight up Waggle pick/eviscerate your 4/4, leaving you behind on tempo, or you’re against a warrior who can play the 5/5 rush or shield slam straight into it. It’s pretty much dead later on when you want to Myras into lethal as well.
---
Too bad i dusted my gold miscreant
---
Ooooh, the 🅱️ANCIENT ONES!
---
Be a man and get those wins with Mill rogue or another janky deck like Deathrattle Reno rogue.
---
This means if she plays a Fungalmancer, it should buff the two minions for two times +2/+2… right? But it is happening 3 times. 
---
Obviously, there has to be a turn limit, cuz it says "an additional time" meaning only 1 extra time
---
Thing is, there is a difference between difficult and impossible.
---
That game there was literally nothing i could have done. He had me dead on turn 4 no matter what. No matter what mulligan i did, no matter what cards i played, as soon as the game gave him those 4 spells with that passive i was dead.
---
That;s not difficult, thats impossible. Objectively so.
---
I know this is long dead but... I’ve been playing Hearthstone for 6/7 months. I live in Ohio.
---
I’m currently in Scotland at Uni.
---
I’m not banned.
---
This is bullshit.
---
Also all pandas and bankers and Zola too.. plz blizzard
---
Cause zilliax is fine lol? What deck does zil specifically enable that's causing problems? Or do just dislike zil as a defensive tech card?
---
If you want to hit, let's say... Warrior, then zil isn't even remotely the issue. Dr boom, devastator, etc would be the best targets. If you want to hit their classic cards, then maybe we should talk about rotating brawl. If 45m games are the issue then maybe elyssiana is in need of a complete redesign.
---
Are you serious? How can you take issue with Prep FINALLY getting a nerf? Prep has been completely insane and limiting design space ever since it was first made.  
---
Its a card that shouldn't have been made to begin with.
---
9+Evil Miscreant, 3 Preps, 5 Raiding Partys, and Archivist Elysiana feels golod
---
So op is a boot?
---
Why would you ever not dust them? I mean you already have 15k dust, but still.
---
Sounds like you used a cheat (bot), got caught, made up this bullshit story and when it didn't work to get you unbanned, came here to buy false empathy and support (:
---
GGWP
---
In some other cases such as Brann Bronzebeard his text reads "your battlecries trigger twice". This means that you will only ever get two battlecries per minion. In this case if she hero powers and doesn't play a minion with a battlecry, then hero powers next turn and plays a minion the "additional time" is now 2 additional times.
---
mods, ban this shifty individual...
---
I understood that referrence!
---
Will mirror warrior matchup be decided by the one with the coin and using it turn 10 with Elysiana + Panda?
---
Rogue nerfs!! YES!! I have hated that class ever since I played my first game against it, and the unfun-ness of playing against that class in pretty much ANY meta is why I quit the game altogether when Quest Rogue was a thing. 
---
I might actually start playing again (casually) just because I'm so glad this absurdly unfun and overpowered class finally sees a nerf. Sap to 3 mana next, please!
---
Forgive my ignorance, but why do they give you dust when they nerf a card? Or have I misunderstood? I have all 3 of the rogue cards, will I receive dust for them or is that only if you have a golden copy?
---
Why RIP? Prep is still amazing.
---
Ill go ahead and throw myself under the bus here to describe how badly you’re lying through your teeth.
---
I live in NA and have purchased a EU account on two separate occasions. I have never been banned, not once.
---
If you got banned, you were probably exploiting as they said.
---
No they 100% would and do
---
Or just do it in wild. About rank 3 and onwards, every second opponent is the same guy
---
I doubt that
---
Maybe because rogue spells are high Mana cost? Not being able to use espionage/Sprint/Myra's early ruin all types of rogue not just the one that uses wagglepick
---
Agreed. Just came back from the Middle East and I had no problems with my account.
---
Can you give a list ? I just hit legend with rogue for the first time but with these nerfs i think i will have to come back to hunter (probably my most played hero, im 20 wins of gold hero)
---
Just quit playing blizzard games they are killing their own games anyways.
---
They have no right to brag though. In fact paying someone else to achieve something for you is *worse* than not being able to do it yourself. Sad sad people.
---
How? Its still a 0 mana spell. It reduces the cost of a spell by TWO mana.  
---
How does this hurt? How is this an 'ouch'? The card is still amazing. Are you just one of those netdecking playing that netdecks without  realizing why X is good in the deck?
---
*laughs even harder*
---
Will zayle decks get updated? I don't see why new players should craft Zayle over whizbang if Zayle never gets updated. Granted that Zayle stays in standard for one more year, but imagine playing these decks for 2 years.
---
Now I’m a bit worried that when I change move to another place that I get my account banned or if I log in on a PC instead of on a Tablet. How do they check if it’s the same person, because it seems risky to switch platforms this way?
---
Zilliax's problem is he is so good that you can find him in over half of all the current decks being played.
---
No it's not one of the best anymore. For years Rogue spells had tendency to be bit overcosted because of sinergy with prep (not all but majority), and it sucks that card from classic set is being nerfed. It's a overkill
---
I agree, but they just want to make it look like they have actually earned their bragging rights. Pretty sad not being able to get the gratification they desire from real life.
---
If you're an actual rogue main and been playing for 5 years, then you should realize that you're over exaggerating on this nerf.  
---
Prep is still great. Its a 0 mana spell that reduces the cost of a spell by 2. Its still going to get ran.
---
prep-&gt;coin is still not nerfed
---
They’re the kind of people who can achieve nothing, but feel something close to achievement by paying for it.
---
Tempo will be fine I guess the real loss will be felt by decks utilizing necrium vial/vanish/sprint cause those spells actually might not hit the board fast enough or create too much of a tempoloss (sprint).
---
A lot of ppl in this friend have debunked this. I myself have played hearthstone on different continents, let alone different countries, with no issue. So don’t worry :)
---
I'm not though, I don't watch her streams.
---
Just goes to show that Prep should have been HoF'd LONG ago.
---
I'm not allowed to have my own cell phone so my dad forced me to use his  phone number.  My dad has a steam too and uses the same number. today  my brother used my dads account and cheated and now my main account is  VAC banned. It's true and here is proof, my father will now write too:
---
Hello I'm the father and what my son says is true, he did not cheat, it was his brother on my account. Please unban him valve
---
sincerely the father
---
Pls unban
---
Well thats not true. Value = 9:)

40 X (at least 9) + 2 X 400= ????
---
Blizzard has the best customer support of any gaming company I've encountered. They literally refunded me 3 months of WoW subscriptions because I was having issues cancelling (they didn't have to, but did it anyway). This story doesn't make any sense. It also says in that ticket that he was banned for "using a different game account to take part in exploitative play", not "This player was playing out of state".
---
I don't know, there's probably nothing similar on mobile because of how overlays work. You could use a static tierlist if it's not too tedious for you to type in the card names manually:

Yeti#21265 EU Looking for people to practice/chat/spectate quest
---
Thanks for clarifying :)
---
Then you face controll warrior and cry in the corner HAHA
---
You're correct, assuming she only hero powers once. What you are missing is the fact that her hero power can stack with itself, because the "next battlecry" can be played several turns later than the hero power was.
---
Yes that's fine .. It's a bad idea sharing passwords ..
---
So is Archivist Elysiana
---
If they make him a mech, then he can be Discovered.. this way they can get multiple

---
What would qualify as boosting? If I do the five wins per month thingy for the chest, so she can get the card back, would that be not allowed?
---
Turn 6 instead of turn 4 is a huge difference, no?
---
hey still need to do this? if so, add me on HS - Nighthawks#21920 - i'll be on for the next hour or so.
---
It's because all Rouge spells are made with a possible 3 mana cost reduction in mind. 
---
While I'm looking forward to the design space it opens up it's going to take a while. Remember how before the rotation everything was stale because they intentionally reduced the power-level of expansions? It's probably going to be a while before the spell gap is filled in Rouge. 
---
Kind of similar to how priest struggles until it gets more AOE at the end of the year. 
---
Spells aren't the be-all and end-all but Prep was a large part of the Rouge kit that made it competitive. It's also restricted the class. Will be interesting to see what we get in new expansions.
---
If you are at vacation somewhere you can login there no problem. And i assume Hearthstone doesn't exactly start your Webcam...
---
We've been years together, I don't think anything bad will happen with that 😷
---
While technically bannable, Blizzard generally won't ban people for this. If anything, your girlfriend's account would get banned, since she is the one sharing her account.
---
Lol didnt know you could get higher than 70 FeelsBadMan
---
I've played Hearthstone in: MA, PA, DC, CA, CO, TX, MD, NY, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, France, Germany, Switzerland, Croatia, Slovenia and on an iPhone, Google phone, iPad and four different PCs.  I've never had my account banned.  
---
You're lying OP.
---
Prep hope for opponent to concede out of respect.
---
Getting to legend from rank 5 is not about how well you play, but about how many games you crank out until you get there ;)
---
That's what stair exists for.
---
That's ridiculous, have you ever played a Warrior mirror or tried Mechathun Warrior? There aren't very many games where you are low on armour turn 20. And you can save up your Weapon's Project and such already, running a completely dead card just to try and push a combo to work *slightly* more often. You might as well just run the Undertakah and Devastate or something to try and push it faster and guarantee it, or not gimp your deck for the combo and run more survival/tech cards instead.
---
No, like getting her legend or something and even if u do that it is near impossible for them to figure that out, i wouldnt worry man, been playing since Naxx and have used many of my friends accounts nothing has happened.
---
People only run the bouncer because other people are running it. It's not something anyone wants to put in their deck. People will run either fatigue warrior without the bouncer, or else they'll run Bomb Warrior. Fatigue Warrior with a bouncer will be worse than other of those.
---
I doubt it will even come into play much in tournaments. If you're teching warrior to beat another control deck, there are ways to do it that doesn't require a coin flip on whether you're going first or second.
---
Thank you, since this post hit the front page I was starting to get a lot more negative people who want to assume that I'm lying about this whole situation. I assumed they were just the vocal minority, so thank you for being so kind, I'll post an update if anything more happens
---
Boosting would be you using either account to "give" wins to the other account .. Just avoid too many games where your playing your id against hers and you will be fine ..
---
Which card did you get the reduction from?
---
As a player who doesn't give a shit about rogue and didn't even bother to craft prep so far, i agree with you. I'm entirely F2P and i don't like the direction blizz is taking with the classic sets at all. I get that it's boring to see the same cards over and over again, but then again, that's kind of what you'd expect from something you call "classic", isn't it? Have cards for each class that they can always fall back on as a core. If you don't want recurring cards, don't create a set that is per se designed to keep seeing play. 
---
And if you want to get rid of it then just do it, don't tell people "don't worry guys everything will be replaced", then proceed to print shit like icicle as an epic.
---
yeah i think the deck can still perform without shaw and if the meta goes full aggro as i expect shaw is useless. i agree in the 9 lives thing tho
---
I find that this often depends on your playstyle: I really often disagree with Heartharena's drafting when I pick hunter, but I barely disagree with anything with mage; it wants to draft aggro hunter, which I hate playing because it's coinflippy, but it drafts towards attrition mage, which I enjoy much more.
---
Jade but communism
---
Oh yeah!!!!!! Show us even more.....
---
Now that you mention it.. 
---
Kinda makes sense again to craft two additional copies of Prep and one of Elysiana, right?
---
You got banned for using exploits brah.. that's probably not a good idea
---
Glad to hear that, but still there's a chance where devices could get hacked and things become messy (I know sounds like a bad movie plot)
---
This was a smart decision...in 2013 now its pointless as blizz rarely nerfs cards,and I can assure you that shifter zerus will never be nerfed
---
demand your money back if you spent any? like dispute it with paypal or whatever.
---
I hate this idea that if a deck isn't T1 or 2 it's dead and not worth playing. Some of us play for fun. I have a 40% winrate with 400+ wins with espionage. That's good enough to still enjoy the deck. When a deck goes sub 30% it's no longer fun even with a highroll game mixed in here and there. I've grinded hundreds of wins with similar decks (astral druid, renounce warlock, etc)
---
TL;DR some of us don't just go to HSreplay and sort by winrate and playe the #1 deck. Nerfs shouldn't ruin fun decks people like me enjoy.
---
Its not like they even have a replacement for prep lined up, essentially they weren’t happy with how cheap Rogues main deck is to craft assuming you have the staples so this is them lashing out trying to force people to make more decks.
---
I'm really not lol. I don't know why this happened, this is the only guess I have, it's likely wrong, but I don't know why my account got flagged and banned when I haven't done anything
---
Here's basically how it works:
---
Echo cards add a copy of the original card into your hand. So if you play a 0 mana card that was originally 2 mana, you'll get the 2 mana back.
---
Bob's buffs does not actually buff your cards. It removes said copy from your deck, then adds a copy that has it's stats changed. That's why even though the cost is 0, the numbers are still white, not green.
---
Once you get an echo card to 0 mana, you can play a infinite amount of them (excluding certain cards) since it adds the original card back to your hand, which is a 0 mana version of the card. 
---
Twin Spells doesn't work because it doesn't actually give you the copy of the card. It gives you back a similar copy of the card but without the Twin Spell text.
---
Oh sure it's better, but people are still having to burn a 4 damage spell for a third of the card, it'll still be a crazy strong 3 drop.
---
This guy gets it.
---
What about Archivist, I don’t see it being too impactful having it go up to 9
---
HOW LONG ⛏ CAN ⛏ THIS ⛏ GO ON
---
The way Hearthstone was intended to be played.
---
I agree, I got a lot of dust when blizzard nerfed the Warlock's dread steed when he was in Wild.
---
My issue with this is that we are making permanent nerfs to a non permanent meta. The prep nerf hurts much more because it's a classic card, and the cards you listed being a problem are not classic cards. The fix should be towards myra's and raiding party, not prep. Such shortsightedness leads to more issues, not fewer.
---
Nothing happened, i just drew the card
---
Yeah I’m done with this game after this. Literally all they want is rogue players that are casually surviving playing this game without spending ££££ to start having to spend ££££ to stay competitive. 
---
What a joke.
---
[Thief Rogue](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=ROGUE&amp;archetypes=276) is what you're looking for. The deck is literally all about generating random cards.
---
Why is it a problem that it can transform into Elysiana? Please help. I don't understand.
---
This is pleasing to see, you have my respect kind sir
---
Dusting is so bad, i remember as a new player i dusted cards just because i had spare copies and a few months later they got nerfed (like 2 copies of 4 mana Leeory)  
---
Unless you REALLY need the dust don't dust any card you can never know what blizzard gonna do in the future.
---
And [[chameleos]] pls
---
As you can see, I used Rakanishu’s Hero Power although there is a Mind Breaker on the board. This makes no sense.

1/1/1 Beast | Each turn this is in your hand, transform it into a card your opponent is holding.

I honestly am not 100% sure either, but from my understanding boots are low ranking American soldiers, who always get married really fast because that apparently let's them move out of the barracks? Something along those lines at least.
---
r/JustBootThings is for mocking boots, so posting there kind of suggests that he's not.
---
Okay, okay, everyone knows that already.
---
My issue with this is that prep hasn't ever been an issue until this current meta. I have never seen calls to nerf prep until this single meta where rogue is especially strong. It is illogical to nerf the *class* for all time going forward because of a singular strong meta.
---
this shitty card will never be nurfed
---
I missed the sarcasm then, my bad
---
It doesn’t cost any more money unless you buy more packs because of it
---
You could say it breaks his mind
---
Nice. I literally crafted all tempo rogue cards 2 days ago. I crafted Van Cleef, Wagglepick, Prep, Greenskin almost all of the cards required to play tempo rogue.

Sounds like you're either lying or got your account compromised.

I agree with this 100%. Dude was running a multi account bot farming gold through friend-list matches.
---
...Sucks you got caught dude, but just man up and call it a learning experience, don't ever risk what you aren't willing to lose.
---
Holy shit and i thought i had bad luck, well atleast you opened goldens
---
The enemy “hero” isn’t considered to be a “hero”. Same thing happened to me when I used restore both hero’s to full health and only I got the health.
---
Tempo rogue is tier 2 currently, so it can't "still be tier 1".
---
The only tier 1 decks are secret hunter and token druid (if using win rates and number of games played to determine tiers).
---
Lol I work at CS for a big corporate and this is the exact behaviour that will make me think "fuck me if I am helping out this pri**" and I am always going the extra mile for everyone, just sayin
---
I'm pretty sure Blizzard is pretty open about being OK with account sharing as long as money is not involved. People very frequently share WoW and Hearthstone accounts with other people casually and it never gets you banned.
---
Basically guaranteed to happen.
---
Some day he will be op and u will get your 480p dust
---
Yeah at least that was a few free legendaries
---
How long have you been playing?
---
Just remove classic and basic from standard and create a rotating classic set already. Nerfing those cards one at a time sucks. Just rebalance it all at the same time or not at all.
---
Oh, that's absolutely right. Mill rogue is actually a problem in wild, and the prep nerf will help fix that. The problem is, value and mill and control rogues all lack big removal and healing. So they're not practical, they just dominate matchups.
---
Touché
---
I’ve got the mech egg as well as kangor’s endless. 
---
Warrior is a good matchup for me also, Shaman for me is basically an auto lose if they play it correctly.
---
Ye share away, I’ll compare to what I’ve got :).

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I mean that would be a scam. 
---
Put it like this:
---
2 mana training but you dont get too choose a card.
---
I've had some pretty piss poor experience with blizzard support too. Had some trouble with Overwatch suddenly flickering and stuttering out of nowhere. Was told to update my drivers (which I had, and had said in my original message), then was asked for my specs, I resent them (they were also in my original message) and they told me Overwatch didn't support "steam machines" and Overwatch would not be able to run on my computer.
---
I built it myself, it was running on windows 10. I have no fucking clue why they thought it was a steam machine. 
---
They asked me to run a DxDiag. I resent the one I'd run (also in the original message), and then started copying and pasting shit at random calling them "driver issues", claiming that things like, the razor program that runs the lights in my overpriced keyboard, were the real issue. The things they were copying and pasting were not drivers. I stopped replying at that point.
---
I ended up working out the issue myself after a bunch of trial and error, and it turned out my power supply had mildly shit itself and it was affecting my framerate only in Overwatch for some reason, but the person I was talking to, didn't know shit and paid attention to exactly nothing in the original support message I'd sent. It felt like they were just copy-pasting solutions instead of reading the original message.
---
Yes, you can always craft her back. Disenchanting her after the nerfs are live will give you access to that dust for whatever you actually want to play with.
---
Enjoy your last kingsbane rogue encounters
---
Lot of cards need molten giant treatment basicly all nerfed classic and basic
---
YAGE away, good buddy!
---
yes, dusting after nerf will give you full value instead of 1/4
---
no
---
While it's animated, it's not golden.
---
Juggy#11991
---
NA
---
Add me or I'll add you, don't really mind.
---
I wish you the best of luck, blizzard was always rude cold and money lovers
---
That hero power in the picture isn’t golden
---
Imagines you can hear: “Wow.”
---
Its the effect of the other portraits, for example liadrin has the visual effect of the golden Hero power but the border is normal collored so it wont summon any golden units.
---
mmm I'm not an expert but I would say rogue has been nerfed the most :p
---
Before people complain about control-look at the nonexistence of control decks in the top 2 tiers-control has always been the worst archetype so it should be supported more
---
Would still be better option kept it for wild the legacy format.  And not made evry single Rogue spell of last 5years worse and made multiple basicly unplayable
---
Chiming in with Washington, Gotham City, Quebec, Timbuktu, and Mordor. OP seeming real scummy right now.
---
Ah I understand, thanks.
---
There is a treasure that gives you a random death knight heropower
---
I actually got my account suspended because i moved to the other side of the world.
---
But because i tried to buy something the first week i moved, not just for playing.
---
And not only that, but as soon as i contacted blizzard they unlocked my account and gave me what i wanted to buy for free.
---
I said this in a post before. Omega Assembly is 1 Mana draw 3 that doesn't even put you closer to fatigue. As you said the only "downside" is turn 10+ and that isn't even a downside. Warlock has the same exact spell 1 Mana draw 3 but as a legendary and if they can't use those cards the same turn they get discarded.
---
I agree with you.
---
If you want Vim to do work, the moment you pick it you gotta change your bucket selection to always be whatever's lowest-cost. Even that's been pretty borderline, but it's paid off for me twice.
---
A Prince's Ring gives you a random Death Knight hero power at the start of the match.
---
Stargazer makes your hero power cost 1 and you can use it twice per turn.
---
Jade Druid is absolutely a Control deck imo, and you can make cases for Big Priest and Shudderwock Shaman (no longer has an OTK) to be classified as control.
---
I'm almost sure Sword of Justice also activates on the minion. The text says "After you summon a minion, give it +1/+1 and this loses 1 Durability". So I guess it is considered kinda of a summon?
---
But I guess the big factor is that one as a player would expect to be the effect to be consistent. Everything else gets silenced, and when one sees the big minion 'enter' the field it should do so as well. It's faulty wording if the interactions are not intuitive enough. But with Hearthstone, things can never be so simple huh?

Three card draw (2 pirates, 1 weapon) and fill your hand / empty your deck feels powerful.
---
So make raiding even more expensive. Don't touch prep.
---
Wed sooner se those made more expensive then ever gertting reduced
---
Many Rogue cards require combos to be effective. So are you saying we should continue with the combos but not give the player any refill?
---
I think we're talking about different things here. If the claim is that these spells are inherently bad (i.e. nobody runs them in the first place), then what difference does Prep make? The argument makes sense only if people do run those spells, but won't play them unless they can combo them with Prep.
---
He with boom are only that keep or so people bus boomsday at all for now. Of will be nerfed will be right before rotation
---
I’ve bought the expensive preorders for Rasta and Shadows, all of the previous adventures, the welcome bundle, the spring bundle, a couple of $50 classic pack bundles in order to hit the legendary pity timer a few times. I know I’ve spent more on this game than any other that I’ve played but I still barely can put together a competitive (high dust price) deck. I understand that cards != skill but to me, cards == fun. I have played budget lists and it’s satisfying to get wins but the legendary card combos are more fun to me
---
I'm looking forward to the reduction in Tempo Rogues allowing the various warrior counters into the meta so that awful boring deck will go away.
---
RemindMe! 2 weeks "Have Warrior counters like Conjurer's Calling Mage and Bomb Hunter exploded in popularity?"
---
Yes, that's sure to paint a realistic picture.
---
Well, atleast it didn't just remove all minions from the deck like it did to me lol
---
500 ranked wins in the future, maybe
---
They should make your mechs have rush one of the hero power things that change every turn but be a passive no cost
---
That's registered accounts, not actively playing all at the same time, or am I missing something?
---
I don't really like disenchanting non-duplicates. Also I like to keep track of when I opened golden legendaries. If I was desperate for dust I might, but I have a decent amount of dust in duplicates still.
---
Makes me happy inside. But I'm sad no boom nerf
---
Hey thethe joke was waiting to be made
---
&gt; There's NOTHING that counters a Turn 4 Giant with Conjurer's Calling in hand 
---
...
---
1. One card answers
---
   1. Walk the Plank
---
   2. Shadow Word: Death
---
   3. Deadly Shot
---
   4. Polymorph
---
   5. Hex
---
2. Conditional one card answers
---
   1. Shield Slam
---
   2. Hunter's Mark
---
   3. Demonbolt
---
   4. Execute
---
3. Two card answers
---
   1. Preparation + Assassinate or Unidentified Contract
---
   2. Spider Bomb + Mech on board/Fireworks Tech
---
   3. Ray of Frost + Snap Freeze
---
   4. Any mech that can attack + Venomizer
---
   5. Kill Command + Minion(s) with three or more attack
---
   6. Double Evisorate
---
   7. Double Vendetta
---
4. Others
---
   1. Having minions with a combined total of eight attack on the board
---
      1. Zoo Warlock, Token Druid, and Murloc Shaman can do this
---
   2. Sap can give the opposing player another turn to respond to the combo
---
Not all of those may be competitive, but saying there's nothing that can respond to a turn three or four Mountain Giant is disingenuous.
---
Also, did you post this exact same thing a few hours ago?
---
Aren't the odds pretty low?  It might seem higher because people post videos and pics when it happens.
---
try looking at the number of games next to each archetype. tempo rogue accounts for more games than the entire shaman, priest and paladin classes combined.
---
\- you can make budget decks that work well on ladder, but most people will agree that spending money is the best way to get to legend
---
\- you can win games with an off meta deck but not as many
---
\- yes you can play ranked right away
---
\- your collection works on pc and mobile, same collection tied to your battle net account
---
&gt; 22th
---
How is that an argument for what i am saying? They needed to touch elysiana because of tournaments, otherwise they would never touch it. Rogue case is different because they had several choices to nerf and went for raiding
---
I've been playing for like 4 years and only hit the limit once (with a card stealing priest vs a similar deck).
---
What if it is was all mechs gain rush, mech pally would be insane in the match up.
---
&gt; Years and years worth of cards have been balanced around "is this fair with Prep"
---
Except they were not.
---
Now; to be fair it's hard to judge the value of some cards; such as Vanish. However; here's some cards that clearly were not designed around Prep:
---
Eviscerate: Standard '2 mana 3 damage' spell; in that it deals 2 normally and 4 with Combo. Worse without a setup; better with one. Also Frostbolt is 3+Freeze.
---
Fan of Knives: Arcane Explosion is 2 mana. Draw 1 card is 1 mana.
---
Sprint: As just mentioned; Draw 1 is 1 mana; Draw 2 is 3 mana. Draw 3 was 5 mana but got nerfed to 6 because of Choose One. Draw 4 is *rightfully* 7 mana. 
---
Shiv: 1 damage is 1 mana, draw a card is 1 mana.
---
Seriously. Give some actual examples of 'spells designed to be used with Prep' because 90% of Rouge's spells currently in Standard are fairly priced on their own accord, or are a unique design and thus rather difficult to judge their value.
---
The main outlier being Wanted! which is just a bad card [4 mana 3 damage; but gives a coin if it kills... but it's still 3 mana in effect]
---
Play aggro decks and win against priest.
---
If there is, it is longer then what is being used in ranked mode. But I think that there is not a turn limit in solo adventures. 
---
Please correct me if I am wrong
---
Mind the order
---
Nerf on classic card because their newly printed cards are broken? Mark me surprised. Would rather move prep to hof.
---
Allow classic/basic stay in the standard rotation is a fxxking mistake.
---
It summoned another rotface that's a random legendary
---
cjm#1812 Looking for 80g quest trade. NA
---
I'd somewhat disagree with that, since after the addition of Vargoth your only play isnt "stall till Barnes and or Shadow essence anymore".
---
A good Vargoth works wonders vs aggro and can set up very threatening turns afterwards.
---
With shadow visions and mulligan you`re also pretty much guaranteed one or two of the cards you need.
---
Plus there is still Barnes.
---
I think the deck is definitely capable of lasting all the way to legend, though I agree, there are stronger decks out there as well.
---
Especially the fact that you dont even have a chance vs specific matchups weakens Big Priest.
---
It was Sincarl anyway, not even worth attempting honestly after RNG hoses you twice against lady Plague Rat.
---
Thank you for your answer, Can I play against PC player while playing on mobile?
---
Illadin would like to know your location.
---
It's hard unless he rushes out the fel reaver.
---
Always play a coin first, then play everything you can once the fel reaver is out.
---
The girl that is ALSO robbing the bak is much harder. She steals minions from your deck, and plays them, only giving them back when you kill them. She also has the weapon that saves the stats and shuffles back in the deck, and a ton of weapon buffs. Way more powerful than just giving you coins.

\&gt; Looks at Big Priest

\&gt; 18 removal spells.
---
Not control, awlright.
---
\&gt; Looks at Jade Druid
---
\&gt; Almost the entire deck is removal and armor gaining
---
Not control, awlright, awlright.
---
You have me convinced.
---
&gt;What if there was ONE day a whole year where everything dusted was for full value. 
---
There would be so much abuse of that system. It would encourage players with no interest in Wild to disenchant their Wild collections on whatever day they get full refunds for it. The number of people actually spending on the game would plummet.
---
Idk at this point I think control is the more hated warrior deck, but fair enough for using nomi instead of archivist
---
How is it even possible to have 4 Shifter Zerus?  I thought you couldn't open duplicate Legendaries.
---
HOW LONG ⛏ CAN THIS ⛏ GO ON ⛏
---
aes#21331 trade 80g quest EU.
---
Still need?
---
Yes, but decks won't carry you to legend by themselves.
---
:(
---
Now Prep is only 2/3s of a Black Lotus. Completely unusable!
---
Execute should be under two card answers.
---
Yeah i did :)
---
You realise Blizzard essnesially said they'll keep an eye on how Warrior fares when 50% of decks aren't a degenerate aggro deck that you autolose to if you don't build around it; giving Warrior free reign since not only could people not afford to build around it [else autolose to Rouge] but it also did fairly well into it?
---
 HOW LONG ⛏ CAN THIS ⛏ GO ON ⛏
---
Thank you so much! And yes, I’ve only been playing for a couple weeks now and am constantly shocked at how much there is to know. Other question, what exactly is a nerfed card?
---
What options are there to get the third Mechwarper in Hunter? Faceless Manip, Stitched Tracker?
---
Question is, can we dust any of them? Since they're improved not nerfed. I hope we can.
---
Maybe next they'll adjust the economy of the game.
---
Haha, who am I kidding, this is Activision.
---
Jokes on you, I always need the dust.
---
Say that to my odd/even decks kappa
---
I hope they make this a thing that they do for every expansion going forward. Wait 9 months to a year, identify the most underperforming cards and then buff them and create an associated event. 
---
I think one of the bigger problems in Hearthstone is the staleness in between expansions. Making this a regular thing could help lessen that feeling and they don't have to create any new cards to do it.
---
Wait!!

5/4/6 | Deathrattle minions you play cost (3) less, but die at the end of the turn.  
---
I think that’s always been their concern, that a buff becomes broken unintentionally, and everyone rages. 
---
I think they have moved on to the philosophy that most people just want to see the game change frequently enough the feel new most of the time, and they will accept the risk of a broken meta, knowing they can make it temporary.
---
Not budget at all but you could replace her with mechathune/boomship package
---
Tbh it's even more insane when discovered by Primordial Glyph
---
Wild 5 card OTK as early as turn 5
---
As Priest:
---
* Turn 4: Coppertail Imposter (mech with stealth)
---
* Turn 5: Mechwarper + Mechwarper + Seance the Mechwarper + 3rd Mechwarper
---
* 0 mana SN1P-SN4P (magnetize) on the Coppertail Imposter
---
credit to  [emon64](https://www.reddit.com/user/emon64/) for the idea in the Wild subreddit!
---
You can play crowd roaster on 7 and still get its affect, and crowd roaster does offer extra stats. 
---
The biggest part though is crowd roaster is neutral while omega is a class card. Class cards always have a higher power ceiling.
---
Ur very behind on the times, controlwarrior isnt that strong currently, it only really shuts down rogue and is very unfavored against decks such as mech hunter or giant mage. With the nerfs to rogue coming controlwarrior will find a good place against agroo/tempo decks but will suffer greatly against other controldecks/value/mechdecks.
---
Conjurers calling is based off the original mana cost not the reduced
---
They are different effects can't you read?
---
What the buff?!
---
Makes sense. They did just nerf being prepared after all.
---
Looks to me like Dane is going to have some fun.
---
Summoning Portal loves 3-cost echo creatures :) I think it'll love this one most of all. Slightly lower stats, but more stackable and a good deathrattle.
---
Wow Mech paladin may be really good.  Kangor's endless army!
---
[[Reckless Experimenter]]
---
Guess it would be nerfed before it goes into meta
---
Unfortunately, rogue has more than enough shuffle mechanics that have basically no downside.
---
U have the patience of a saint of he did that every turn and u still won
---
( Proceeds to upvote this comment)
---
I really hope so because blessing of Kings but buffed should not exist for any class.
---
Boom is the only reason cards like Nullifier and the Security bot saw play so I don't get the buffs either
---
*Science overwhelming!*
---
You run wagglepick pick because it's a 4 mana 4/2 weapon that makes your dread corsairs cost 0. The deathrattle is just bonus. If it were 3 attack, the deathrattle is not worth a full extra mana over necrium blade (not even considering necrium blade's deathrattle). Shadowblade saw play last meta and it was only because of raiding party.
---
While this is *awesome* and I'm delighted Blizzard are finally willing to explore buffs, I do wonder about some of these. Specifically, Crystology and Thunderhead. Both of these cards have seen genuine and effective play and, were this patch to never arrive, likely would find inclusion in at least some decks until rotation. It feels like buffs should be saved for cards that had really cool ideas or opened up new deck-building space or archetypes but that were hamstrung by conservative tuning, like Unexpected Results. But those two getting buffs feels... unnecessary?
---
Hey reddit! In celebration of the awesome PvE mode I wanted to show you guys some of the process for one of the bosses, although I have finished like 15 runs so far I have yet to encounter my own orc! Curses!
---
Warrior cards that got indirectly buffed- Dr. Boom, Mad Genius and Omega Assembly.
---
I’m missing boomship... what about galvanizer and mecha’thun? Then get 10 mana and shield slam?
---
I´m looking foreward to that.

Natural song in Turkey ❤️
---
Holt fucking shit. With this, the adventure and the (sorta) quick nerfs, Hearthstone is more alive than ever!
---
Amen.
---
Definitely the best possible way to follow up a shocking nerf. Shake the meta up and add some value where there was minimal.
---
They're losing a lot of players because their strategy for developing Hearthstone has been absolute garbage almost since the creation of the game.
---
People have been asking for Buffs since day 1 of the game and for some poorly thought out excuse they just decided: "nah"
---
And with **18** buffs.
---
That's insane.
---
It's also awesome that the buffs are about half "Hell yeah, that's awesome" and half "Meh, definitely better and interesting, but will never break the meta"
---
Bringing underpowered cards up to mediocre cards is just as important as the managing more meta-relevant cards.
---
Dude, i miss that card
---
people can do all of the things you asked, you probably won't be able to, at least right away, because you are new and therefore bad at the game. but if you keep playing, you will eventually be able to, yes.
---
You’re a coward for not having the balls to say this on your real account.
---
What kind of loser creates a throwaway account just to be toxic to someone else?
---
They dared to print a card not from Witchwood that says Echo?!
---
RIP "Repeatable this turn."
---
This is great, hope they continue this
---
This is the big advantage for me. Fishing out your first Pogo Hopper is a challenge.
---
This.Repeat.Every.Week.  ;)
---
But to be serious and maybe to **have a glimpse at the big picture:**
---
-
---
- like /u/Kibler said: silently nerfing all classic cards one by one seems the solution for Blizzard
---
- in addition they are now buffing expansion cards at a slow pace
---
This could result in finally dying the classic set very slowly over the next years - which can only be a very good thing, even for new players.
---
haha. They actually ARE though which makes it even sadder.
---
Baron can't trigger weapon deathrattles.
---
Mechwarper, Mechwarper, Zola, Mechwarper is only 6 mana. It's a bit of a high roll but there are some tutor cards you could use to draw them faster.
---
Yeah, extra arms was actually a decent card as is; just not a lot of decks to play it in...  I used it last expansion in a [[Zerek, Master Cloner]] deck and the deck was preeeetty good.
---
Its going to be resident sleeper with these buffs.
---
Holy crap, buffs? What the hell, this right after the nerfs tomorrow could really shake things up. Nicely done!
---
Free legendary is nice too
---
The bear was always a beast. They changed the art so it looked more like a beast instead of a ghost.
---
I have a question about the announcement about the next arena rotation. Is that when Blizzard ends your current run and pays you out your rewards and gives you a free ticket for another arena run or is that only when a new expansion is released?
---
Ie, should I start an arena run right now and get 2 losses and wait or is this not the same thing as the RoS rotation?
---
I don't think that would trigger Knife Juggler.
---
(until  June 3)

6/5/5 | Deathrattle: If you've cast any spells on this minion, resummon it.  
---
**Laughs at buffs in lackey rogue**
---
Does Deathstalker Rexxar count?
---
Reckless Experimenter + Sn1p-Sn4p. Magnetise infinitely to a mech for potentially turn 5 OTK
---
Honestly since Brode is replaced, changes overall come way faster than before and now we even get buffs.
---
An argument could be made that it appeared as though two or more people were sharing this account. That would produce an unfair advantage since a group of people could rotate their play time, and grind arena/ranked play to get more cards.
---
That said, he should still be allowed to make his case to Blizzard, and present any evidence that corroborates with his story. If Blizzard is going to sustain the ban, then they should atleast provide their own evidence to prove guilt in the matter.
---
Just kidding mate, that's what it was made for
---
Finally embracing Riot's strategy to keep the game fresh? That's a good step forward, just make these balance changes coming on a constant basis with a schedule now.

It's actually quite playable in the darkest hour / plot twist deck

Hmm will they give us dust refunds for all of these changes?
---
You gotta pay the dust to blizzard now though
---
It is now basically a pre-nerfed call to arms.
---
[[Reckless Experimentor]] is too OP.
---
Guess it would be nerfed before it goes into meta.
---
At least it's more OP than pre-nerf [[Shadowboxer]]+[[Ziliax]]
---
?? these are 2 very different cards lol, It's like comparing any shit card to a god tier card that was released with an expansion and saying one of them is "100 times better"
---
Obviously there's going to be a big gap between some cards, they can't release an expansion full of god tier cards
---
I was waiting to spend money on this game only when they started doing things that made me think they still care and maybe this is it.
---
So, when they inevitably nerf that RIDICULOUS crab, what happens?
---
Mechwarper sticks for a turn, then Molten Reflection + Molten Reflection + M+A+G+N+E+T+I+C+F+A+C+E+D+A+M+A+G+E

BUFFING CARDS? ONLY IN TRUMP’S AMERI... oh wait, what is happening??
---
Isn't it 3 now though?
---
holy shit
---
Does it legal?
---
And 2 deck slots
---
It's all about luck I guess. Faced him thrice, two wins, one with an OP deck and one with some garbage, one loss with relatively strong deck.
---
Fill the board so he has to clear it, he clears it and has huge overload thus skipping next turn, in which you fill the board again. Something like rain of toads and/or some huge combo with \[\[Lava shock\]\] at the end can be devastating tho.
---
9 lives combo at 10
---
Those work, but your best choice is doing it with warlock. Glinda -&gt; mechwarper -&gt; mechwarper -&gt; mechwarper -&gt; snipsnipsnipsnipsnipsnipsnipsnip
---
Can't wait to see trump revieving it
---
(uses old mechanic 1 one star)
---
&gt;I would like to know, how do you feel about those changes?
---
I will most likely get lots of flak for saying that but I think they should involve the community, at least the pro player community, more into the process of nerfing and buffing cards.
---
Half the minions from the buffs looked like they just wanted to meet a certain quota of buffed cards rather than actually hoping for those cards to see improve play and I think if you had asked the GM players that also would've buffed / adressed different cards.
---
I think Blizzard needs to create a better communication with the (pro) community so those changes, both in terms of buffs and nerfs, meet the problems and preferences of people rather than just saying "hey, we buffed 18 cards, now be happy dammit!"
---
And same goes for nerfs. There's healthier approaches to certain cards than the ones they've picked in the past (Hi Warsong Commander). 
---
I think the game can only profit off of the knowledge of the active players and the ppl that play the game x hours a day compared to ppl who are "only" working on it but don't have the deep insight than other players might have.
---
But that's just my 2 cents on the topic.
---
Oh god don't give them ideas.
---
My better one is for mage, play molten reflection for the copy. I believe its better as mage has better stall imo
---
win traded his alt for legend in wild. LOL

2/-/- | Deal 2 damage. Unlock your Overloaded Mana Crystals.  
---
I actually searched for this manually because I thought it was a fake site. That's how you do it blizz, keep that shit up.
---
Blizzard? Buffing cards? Is this the end of the world?
---
Honest question but which ones?
---
It gets you two 3-drops if you have spell damage, not three 2-drops. Also they're random instead of from your deck.
---
Still good but probably not as good as call to arms.
---
Here's hoping they get even more ambitious, like making new classic neutrals or moving Whizbang to classic
---
Nah they probably aren't gonna give you full dust value for buffs
---
But why does it start at 0?
---
[[Phantom Militia]]
---
I guess a bunch of big priests and reno deck are going to suffer then.
---
Yeah, because it happens that consistently...

Oh, ok I misunderstood. Yeah you're right, sorry.

3/2/4 | Echo Taunt  
---
Yeah, that says Echo, not "repeatable this turn"
---
That's literally my point.
---
You think you want that, but you don't
---
You only need to play 13 (maximum!) it won’t even come close to being a rate limiting step.
---
The order is wrong. Shouldn't you play the Coppertail Imposter first?
---
Dude pocket Galaxy down to 5 is insaane. I already liked it at 7!
---
Yeah, it went 4-&gt;2-&gt;3. So buffed by 2 mana and then nerfed by 1.
---
flare + 4 damage, brawl, a single taunt + hard removal, etc.
---
Blizzard has valued drawing a card at closer to 1.5 mana than 1 mana for almost all of hearthstone, compare Shiv, Novice Engineer, Arcane Intellect, etc. A 1-mana "draw a card" spell with no additional effects would be OP and see play in every deck of that class
---
My interpretation is that the team heard the feedback on echo, and they might change their philosophy going forward. Their justification was stupid.
---
A deck like Recurring Villain is gonna be that much more fun to play as well. Glad I created it!
---
You’re smart I like you
---
The same goes for handbuffs as well, I assume?
---
Time for mech priest turn 5 otks
---
Time to stalk Zetalot’s twitter for that sweet spell-buff/mech priest list.
---
Extra arms is gonna be rough
---
It still was overcosted. Being able to spread the effect isn't worth 2 mana.
---
Good joke.
---
10 cards by turn 4 with mulligan, and have you not seen how fast nomi priest can draw?
---
it was blizzard official statement when they nerfed grim patron
---
What treatment is that exactly?
---
The only other buff I can think of was Bane of Doom summoning more demons, which they did not give dust for, or some tribal additions when GvG came out, which they also did not give dust for.
---
Reckless+Sn1p is actually game breaking, and there’s already a great shell for it in nomi priest.

2/2/1 | Battlecry: Silence an enemy minion with Taunt.  
---
So... if you magnetize this, the minion doesnt die, right?  Infinite buff?
---
I like the buffs.
---
Also like the *concept* of adding additional legendaries between expansions. Snip-Snap though, I dunno man. One of the top tier decks right now is literally a Mech Deck. Did Mech really need such a flexible, high power level card? It's basically an auto-include for any Mech deck except for Kangor Mech Pally (which ironically enough is one of the Mech decks that needed the most love - I see Paladin having to pivot towards a different direction with 1 mana Crystology instead).
---
Holy fuck this is the best thing Hearthstone has ever done!  I am so happy they’re finally buffing cards!
---
Sure dude. This post got 2k upvotes in 1hr.
---
Nah i think cost reduction on echo cards is fine, but maybe limit it so they have a minimum cost of 1? Or just change reckless experimenter to not reduce cost to less than 1.
---
However, if you dont effect echo directly, you could do (in wild) mechwarper mechwarper faceless into infinite snip snaps as well.
---
Ty ty 🙃
---
While I agree Priest isn’t Tier 1, I don’t think it’s as bad as everyone thinks. Wall Priest is pretty solid and only really struggled against Rogue (which is getting nerfs) and Nomi Priest, while tough to drive, is pretty strong against most decks. No none of these are as powerful as some tier 1 decks, but I would argue they are more fun and in the case of Nomi, challenging to play along with not being expected on ladder.
---
I am bias however as I’m a Priest fan. :)
---
Unstable Evolution though
---
That dude that said that is probably going to be right for 80-90% of people. He just needed to be less of an asshole about it
---
0/10
---
Dies to Fireball.
---
[deleted]
---
Zuljin is barely a hero card, he's 99% about his battlecry. I think the only reason they didn't make him a spell is because DK Rexxar was still in standard and they thought being able to Zuljin and keep the Rexxar hero power was too strong.
---
Witch Doctor approves.
---
That’s not how echo works. I would say that would be a good change but defeats the flavor of the card as well
---
You mean Xur'ious Coins?
---
The Search Engine treatment
---
The real buff is that Echo is a Keyword again.
---
I'm still waiting on my Mechgineer Thermaplugg after the Leper Gnome nerf.
---
PLEASE BUFF ILLIDAN
---
Correct, T5 OTK
---
I dont really think so. And always isnt fair either. Warrior is alright. And if you think warrior is too overpowered, then rogue beating it a fair amount if the time should be telling of how strong rogue is, being that control warrior was practically remade and popularized in response to rogue being so strong
---
what, buffed cards? I though we already had April Fool's day.
---
It was the twinspell prototype though.
---
ah true.. idk the best way to deal with it, most people dont care about wild (blizz included) so the EZ pz fix is just nerf experimenter to discount cost by 2
---
Echo is still in standard and the card will be rotating out with boomsday when the echo keyword rotates out, so it makes sense from that standpoint, whether or not you agree with that line of thinking. Not including it on cards from this year's expansions is more thinking ahead rather than the immediate implications.
---
New legendary out not tied to an expansion?(yeah i know its technically boomsday but yknow what i mean) 
---
Buffs and not crippling nerfs, NOT when theyre about to rotate out? 
---
Guys I think somebody from reddit is holding team 5 hostage, quick look for a encrypted message in the post
---
LeoKing#21786 [EU] Looking to trade the 'Challenge a Friend!' quest :^)
---
Worse against effects that increase the cost of spells you play, or effects that punish you for playing multiple cards on your turn. Better 99 times out of a hundred, though, for sure.
---
Same year, inconsequential, they will rotate at the same time
---
It's fine, the earliest they can pull any shenanigans by using PG is at 6 mana with a very high roll, that's much better than turn 3 giant, turn 4 destroy an enemy minion and get double giant.
---
power up those portals in wild for the new mech
---
I'm a priest player too, almost exclusively. I took  Rez priest to legend this month, did a lot of tinkering with priest in April and May until I found the perfect list. The Rogue nerfs may push Rez priest into Tier 1-2, but I'm really struggling to see how Extra Arms helps any build in any way. Buff spells don't really have a place in Silence Priest, and there's not much else. I guess maybe for Nomi Priest?
---
The next expansion will come in August, exact date not revealed yet.
---
The next Standard rotation will be in April 2020, when Witchwood, The Boomsday Project, and Rastakhan's Rumble will rotate out of Standard format.
---
That's what happens when a fanbase dwindles, the developers finally start to listen to fan feedback. Too little too late if you ask me.
---
Or on Turn 4 you can play Coppertail Imposter and Turn 5 play Reckless Experimenter + SN1P-SN4P for an infinite damage combo.
---
Rakazus, big and dragon priest are all things
---
Hahahaha once there was a card on /r/customhearthstone with echo and magnetic and everybody complaint that it would violate hearthstone‘s card-rules 🙃 because of infinite interactions for example like this...
---
You can run 2 coppertails, 2 reckless experimenters, 2 witchwood pipers + japetto to tutor minions and buff spells like pws to make sure the copperrail lives. Also 2 seances so you have +2 coppertails. You pretty much have 4 MUST remove minions that you can easily get to 6+ hp with extra arms, pws, divine spirit etc. On the other hand you could just play a mech priest and the second a minion sticks you win the game. This will definitely see play
---
Are card buffs happening at the same time as card nerfs? Or are the puffs happening in a later patch?
---
They are losing players.
---
Why did the OP need mention Overwatch - could have just posted:  
---
&gt;Hearthstone digital revenue is down 37% year over year.    
---
Which is stated on the report.
---
That to me is HUGE. Putting the combined Overwatch data into the picture can just murky the statement somewhat as people assume "probably lead by old Overwatch".  
---
I don't believe this is due to competition in the CCG market, it's likely due to the model HS pursue not working and people are slowly but surely moving away from it to other games (possibly non CCG).   
---
I don't see this trend changing anytime soon.
---
LUNAS POCKET GALAXY!!!! 5!!!!! IM BUILDING A DECK RN!!!!!
---
Jeez I picked a bad time quit Hearthstone. Oh well
---
Check out /r/DragaliaLost for a lot of beginner guides. In my experience, keep in mind that the grind is a part of the game, so meter your expectations based on that. 
---
And don't ever pull for one 5* featured character. You will be disappointed, or you will be very, very lucky
---
Holy shit, they're pushing some decks hard!
---
Some of these were just trash cards turned into slightly-less-trash cards, but some will be quite competitive I think... I expect to see some decks rise off this, and lots of current decks replacing cards by these.
---
not unpopular. it's the blizzard-downers that are the loud minority. most people font even care, and most aren't even on Reddit.
---
That’s weird since my discounted witches brew also had 0 cost copies

---
Reading is fundamental.
---
Tutor snip snap. Drop any mech, preferably a sticky one. Reckless on 5 + magnetize infinite snips on that previous mech. TTK.
---
It absolutely matters, and surviving long enough is directly correlated to having pogos on the board. ie pogo pogo sunfury is now playable 2 mana earlier, which is definitely huge.
---
Listen, it wasn't showing up for me and for my friend, I even have a screenshot that it got hidden by a bot I reaploaded it just because of that but if your brain is too small to understand that then just reply once more and I will delete this post just because of your shit storm

---
And you can't play around it since It has stealth. Pretty broken
---
Ok
---
Always remember when it comes to cost changes things that summon a creature based off a number will subsequently be nerfed or buffed.  Astromancer and conjurer's calling will see some new and possibly interesting results and change the outs presented by those cards.
---
Well, they did that with zayle too, technically.
---
But...
---
... it's *really* good.
---
It's haunted creeper with three mech tags, magnetic, and echo.
---
What the fuck, Blizzard?
---
UE seems like it could fit in some sort of tempo mage shell pretty easily.
---
Hate me yet?
---
I agree with you assessment of Blizzard and am in NO WAY justifying their lack of ornery attitude towards player creative feedback, but do try to understand what you're asking of them with your second point. 3-4 cards a month would likely not have any effect on the meta and would complicate the rotation system. On the other hand, asking for 3-4 game changing cards a month forces them to choose between cool ideas and well balanced ones. If you think balance now is a nightmare, imagine having a meta shaken up every month. Nothing would be optimized in standard and balance would be hell. 
---
Edit: I lied about the quick part. I'd highly recommend watching Doublelift's "The Downsides to a Constantly Evolving Game" if you want to hear what I'm about to say but in a fun video form.
---
As one quick little note, the meta is a lot more complex than it seems, and almost nothing is objective. It can certainly seem like that at times, but the truth is that given time, new strategies come forth. There are two different theories for how to deal with certain metas: one is to force change a lot (think releasing a new patch every two weeks), and the other is to never force change at all. For the former, League of Legends is a great example. For the latter, Melee is great. Both are vehemently defended by their loyal fanbase, but often criticized by others. In my opinion, Hearthstone deals with this very well, allowing time not only for a meta to be formed, but a counter-meta as well.
---
Man just imagine, there is an alternate universe where blizzard only ever buffs cards or rotates them into the classic set and the community just looses it's shit because they nerf cards
---
Most recently, Blizzard has shown that if pressured by a 50% player loss, they will bite the bullet and do the impossibly difficult action of “BUFFING” a card. So maybe there is hope for our poor Druids and their soon to be Rogue friends.
---
If Snip-Snap isn't from Witchwood, is it allowed to have Echo?
---
How do you trigger reckless experimenters deathrattle? Or am I missing something?
---
&gt; Only blocks this combo. 
---
Still lethal with Inner Fire, and it blocks Glinda + Mechwarper + Zilliax in Wild, among other things.
---
Not at all
---
I mentioned that earlier, in general if it was a bot that was filling out the e-mail, and sent it, the fields left blank would be in brackets or something similar. Its definitely possible they have capital letters instead, but definitely seems like it'd be uncommon. That makes me think that this is either a copy+pasted response, or is already set up, but it is intended to be changed by a person. Meaning they could've easily just reviewed the case, and blanked on changing the response.
---
Now, its definitely possible that's all wrong, and even if its right it doesn't speak well to the quality of the reviewer, but my instinct is that a person did at least send back the response manually.

"Your deathrattle minions cost (3) less, but not less than (1). They die at the end of turn." is preferable IMO.

---
This is greatly an improvement for Heal Druid. The problem before was Gloop Sprayer costed the same as Lucent bark which hurt your chances of drawing it with Psychmelon. Now, it isn't an issue
---
But how though
---
Ok, but even if you can only magnetize 8 times say, that’s still kind of like a big Edwin Vancleef except it’s a 20/28 charge minion with deathrattle fill your board with 1/1s.
---
(I tested over lunch with replicating menace, and Reckless Experimenter doesn’t add the kill debuff when you magnetize).
---
Still seems strong in standard.
---
Yeah I understand that there are of logistics to allow a system of constant card introduction.
---
Rotation wise, I think you could just say: "Whatever cards we release monthly/bi-monthly/whatever, will technically belong to the most recent previous expansion, and rotate accordingly"
---
As for balance, yeah, I agree, most of these cards should probably just be memeish cards, a bit of fun cards and deck building challenges (cards like Renounce Darkness for instance), and only occasionally have cards to specifically address the meta if things start getting out of hand with a specific deck/set of decks
---
That is not a Boomsday Warrior card.
---
So this is why they started listening to the community.
---
true, I played hearthstone on my phone while waiting for my fiance to walk up the aisle at our wedding, she called it off. feelsbad
---
He made 2.6k (at least) karma thread points and easily a couple of thousand karma post points on top of that.
---
Some people would piss on their grandma to get as many points as they can.. as if it was like Digg or Something Awful forum.. where renown is a good thing and gives you extra benefits
---
You can tutor the Sn1p-Sn4p with [[Dead Ringer]], so you kinda need just [[Reckless Experimenter]] and another Mech. Priest can draw out a whole deck pretty fast so this might work actually
---
&gt;I hope this goes the way Blizzard expects.
---
They expect you to blow all your dust on cards that are going to be around for less than a year while bitching and moaning about the oppressive-as-fuck buffs so you never ask them to do it for the cards that actually should be buffed.
---
Blizzard hasn't done anything in their 5 history of this game to suggest that they would do this:
---
* Is Blizzard going to come back in 2 weeks and say "oops, we made Necromechanic too strong, we're nerfing it back"?
---
So, your entire argument is built upon a flawed premise. If that situation were to occur, then you would see a tremendous backlash. They know this.
---
Of all the buffs, I'm the most intrigued by the Crystology and Pogo-Hopper ones. Crystology was already a really good card, which is fine to me as a Holy Wrath Paladin player, but it's crazy now tbh. Pogo Hopper Rogue didn't do that well even after Blizz kinda pushed it to work, so I guess it makes some sense to buff it (like treant druid and mulchmuncher), but reducing the cost to 1 might be really extreme. One could argue the cost won't matter on the later turns, anyway, but I believe it'll make a big difference in how quickly you can actually ramp up. Also, a cost reduction on a card you'll play 7 times in a game is pretty heavy.
---
Since it's currently slave to play. That would actually be an amazing improvement.

2/2/1 Mech | Deathrattle: Draw a Deathrattle minion from your deck.  
---
when you spend a whole game building it and when you consider many kingsbane games used to end with a 17/4 or bigger kingsbane id say its small.
---
Not when you disconnect for the rest of the turn after playing the second one
---
Imagine if you could magnetize on ANY MECH.
---
I'm fine with the buffs by themselves, what makes me raise an eyebrow is the buffs AND the nerfs combined. Luna's Pocket Galaxy is a pretty significant buff, so much so that it might become an actually good deck (hard to say at this point). Who's to say they won't just nerf it once it becomes good? Even worse, who's to say they won't indirectly nerf it like they did with Kingsbane (still salty about that) so we can't even recoup our dust value? The buffs are nice and all, but I don't really own enough of them for it to matter and crafting anything at this point seems like a bad idea.
---
Glowstone Technician and Crystology at one less mana will be busted and will make Paladin Tier 1.
---
BUUUUFFFFSSSSS! I would love it if we could get one of these every set! Just slightly tune some of the cards that underperformed in the previous set.
---
WHAT!!?!
---
well for that comment, it was so downvoted that it would have been hidden from view. people awarded the comment to keep it visible and to keep the hate train going
---
Who made this happen and what have they done to blizzard?
---
I actually have found some of the decks to struggle this rogue
---
/r/hearthstone loves to call combos with setup, as OTK's. 
---
The funny part to me is that if you play Reckless Experimenter and SN1P-SN4P on the same turn, you get up to a 14 attack Coppertail Imposter. Oh my god, it's almost as much much burst as Rogue puts together with Leeroy and Waggle Pick!!
---
I love this. This is amazing.
---
...But this new mech seems pretty strong and they buffed 2 warrior mechs. These are indirect buffs to Dr. Boom
---
&gt;They must not have been happy with how the power level of Boomsday turned out
---
I think you mean sales.

Boomsday was strong. I genuinely think this is a money grab.
---
I've been getting that a lot playing on PC lately.
---
Friend of mine in 2017 had the chance to travel the world, and was set to play HS and wow on all 7 continents but got ill so couldnt travel to Antarctica... he even played a HS match while in the DMZ in North Korea, on an EU account registered to Denmark.
---
He got nothing from Blizzard about it.
---
You can pull it off in wild even with the echo animation of the mechwarpers and zilliax and the treachery onto the wrathguard, you can get 30 damage before you hit the rope.
---
Pogo is seriously so so much better at 1 mana.
---
Awesome, thank you
---
There's a reason why the rogue-like genre isn't popular, you know.  Some people would rather play through a good campaign once rather than a random unfocussed campaign 50x with slight variations. And on that note extra hero powers and more tick boxes are hardly substantial content. You are still fighting up to 8 bosses in succession, all of whom have no story interactions with the player beyond like 1 voiced line.
---
It's much more nuanced than that. 
---
MtG, the most popular card game, really doesn't suffer from notable power creep from set to set. At most, there's a set that is stronger than the rest in its block, but that spike in strength is then corrected in future ones. There are a few trends over the course of the twenty-five year history of the game, most notably that creatures have gotten significantly better than they used to be, but most given Standard sets will tend to be roughly equal to most others.
---
In the Yugioh TCG, power creep is unfortunately used as a selling point.
---
Granted, newer cards in card games could be better than older ones because the design team has learned to create better cards for their game or allow themselves to explore more design space than they could or would in the beginning.
---
Buffs? Im pleasantly surprised

10/8/8 Mech | Rush. Costs (1) less for each friendly Treant that died this game.

10/8/8 Demon | Costs (1) less whenever a friendly Demon dies while this is in your hand.  
---
He still docks points for mixing keywords I believe
---
1 mana draw 2 is the most efficient card draw spell we've seen in hearthstone, conditional or not. combo decks can run thalnos/2x novice and then just 2 other hits they're not unhappy running in the list -- previously stonehill could have filled this spot -- and then you have a hugely efficient way to draw through your deck
---
aggro decks run a nonzero number of one attack minions, and getting card advantage is always good, even if the minions aren't ideal. 1 mana draw 2 is absolutely, 100000% something to keep an eye on.
---
That‘s sad, I had a deck where I could tempo out a 5/5 with the Devilsaur Egg and that card, if they change it, I‘ll have to combo one turn later
---
The person you responded to said "no real new features".
---
People have been clamoring for a tournament mode or a new game mode in which to use our cards and instead we got......Dungeon Run. Then they're surprised sales slumped. It is like if in WoW people were clamoring for more PvP content and then they released a new Raid and said "See, you got new content!". 
---
More deck slots was a feature, deck codes were a feature, there have been some nice "features" added to Hearthstone in its 5+ years. There has not been new "content" in terms of a new way to play the game. Dungeon Run is fun, but it isn't HS, just some weird Slay the Spire esque game with worse AI.
---
Glowstone’s the handbuff 3/4
---
Lots of shitty cards "see play". Rivendare was never in any high tier meta decks.
---
Thank you! Really enjoyed doing that one!
---
Never dusting a bad legendary again
---
That's not exactly breaking news is it?
---
Yup, I wish more artists would post here too so we can all see it. :)
---
fuckyou9234#1563 NA (pardon the name quit hearthstone with a name change, am legit and willing to show/go first if you're also legit).
---
Yup, pretty much this. :)
---
&gt;it randomly makes you go first
---
Don't you always go first in the Heist?
---
But that’s the thing about it being a freaking digital card game.... if it doesn’t go quite how they wanted, just change the numbers back! 
---
Obviously they can’t be making big changes every week back and forth but they should have been taking risks buffing things a long time ago
---
Yes that's the joke
---
Probably not more than Silence, but... It helps deal with taunts.
---
Replicating Menace is probably more interesting. It gets in the way of the dead ringer tutor, so it's not ideal...
---
Basically, I'm expecting two Priest lists: combo/draw priest, and mech token priest with a combo finisher. I imagine the former will be stronger, but that the latter will still be very, very strong.
---
Hahaha, love-handles! Well, he is quite thicc.
---
[Buffing millhouse](https://i.imgur.com/VMM2FzP.jpg) didn't give the interaction for me, I've had the voiceline for a 2nd millhouse so I think you've got it with the 4 millhouses = win.

I was sorting by new. I think the world is gonna explode of pogo is going from tier 4 to tier 2
---
So, mister wiseguy, what do you think about that? Not only they announced nerfs, they announced buffs!
---
Synergizes with Zilliax; too OP pls nerf.
---
What the fuck is this post?
---
*Glances at the Obliviotron he just unpacked the other day* ...niiiice
---
You're right. If it's an ongoing aura it will affect every copy. If it was a buff like from Galvanizer, it wouldn't, only the first would be discounted.
---
I did the same thing
---
Or we could let Priest actually have a competitive deck...
---

---
This is basically the *worst* way they could have implemented buffs, though. Most of the cards didn't need buffs -- many already saw play, and many others are going to be oppressive now (or at least would be if not for the new Priest combo).
---
They also discourage dusting garbage cards, encourage crafting old cards, and encourage buying more packs, right at a time when the single player mode sucked an extra 2800 gold out of our wallets, and shortly before they come out with a new expansion.
---
Meanwhile, they ignored classic cards that got heavily power crept or otherwise were never any good to begin with. The most broken card in Hearthstone history is still completely useless because they didn't want to ruin its "soul," but this? Yeah, this is fine.
---
I’ll try Arms in Zoo priest, Wild has Radiant Elemental, its a 2 mana Kings, sounds pretty busted to me
---
lol might wanna hold off on crafting rogue cards
---
This is awesome, except Mech Hunter is probably about to take over the meta...
---
WOW, these arrogant, indolent, petulant, inane people finally buffed cards after years.  Amazing hearthstone must be dying or desperate for players at this point.  Gave no shits for years when this was necessary.  Slightly less shit of a company after this.
---
No, there most likely won't be any wild buffs. That really wouldn't be in line with anything blizzard has done, including the upcoming buffs.
---
You don't need to be a creator to criticize
