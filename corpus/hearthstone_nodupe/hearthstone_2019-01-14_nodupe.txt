The amazing part was Casie not playing around the secret just before that.
---
---
---
but the enemy doesn't die?
---
That's just wrong. Zoo does considerably worse on ladder and is barefly more popular. Evenlock would be the better example but still Cube is the highest winrate form of Warlock. I'd say it's a solid tier 2 deck and even if not Zoo certainly doesn't outperform it and they are pretty different decks anyway, it's not like one invalidates the other at all just because they're the same class.
---
&gt;barely bothering to communicate
---

---
Remember how they invented something called "first ever Hearthstone In The Works Update" just so that they could bury the tournament mode cancellation in the middle of a long article?
---
Yeah, that was totally a real feature, I've really enjoyed all the regularly scheduled In The Works updates we gotten since then.
---
&gt; 99+ deckslots. There's no excuse.
---
Playing wild &amp; standard in addition to building decks and not just netdecking is so annoyingw ithg the 18 slots.
---
I often come up with an interesting deck idea. Play it for 3-10 matches. Next day I need to delete one of my homebrews for a quest and often it's to tedious to save every deck in a wordfile, label it, retrieve it. I would just like to pick it again in the future and keep improving it. Currently I can barely have 1 standard and 1 wild deck per class. All kind of experimentation forces me to fr√©quently delete decks and often forget to recreate them.
---
Okay.
---
Almost like a win condition or something
---
That‚Äôs not gonna change my mind!
---
wohlfahrt#1778 NA 80g trade. Will show but you go first.
---
36 should be fine.
---
Nah 36 is not fine imho when you build your own decks and play wild and standard. Make it 9 per class and you wouldn't even need to change the ui. Just let us chose the class first and then give us the 3x3 rows aka 9 slots for each class.
---
Really?
---
Just wait till the next expansion and rotation, then all the decks will shuffle around.  That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Have you ever heard of Nexus of fate my friend?
---
DING DONG!
---
Yeah right now only botters and streamers get to the cap.
---
Gonk has a decent chance if you don't get stomped before turn 6.
---
We still have some hidden achievements that award gold, like 100 wins and 1000 wins.
---
But no menu to view them or check progress.
---
Replays
---
&gt; I just think that there is some unseen factors that prevent that from happening right now.
---
Activision?
---
Play a deck that counters them because winning = fun doesn't it?  
---
Ah yes, the classic noob mistake of not playing around 5 mind blasts when your opponent is 1 health away from death!
---
I have. It‚Äôs been a solid week since I‚Äôve logged on.
---
Well besides today, and nothing had changed.
---
Yep. I lost an arena game to this bug *four years ago*. I raised as much hell as I could at the time. It's not going anywhere. Learning the hard way that you need to play around this bug is just a part of the new player experience at this point.
---
It‚Äôs now a playoff for the Winter Championship, so instead of one winner they decided its more fair to have double elimination after Swiss.
---
Been this way the whole season.
---
Thank you for this ! 
---
Been playing it on ladder, if you have the cards the deck is an absolute blast to play
---
Every hunter out there deserves this
---
Yup, both Tempo Storm and HSReplay rank Cubelock at middle to low Tier 2 at the moment.
---
And Ice Block in the case of heros. 
---
Toki got a babbling book to replace mana wyrm i believe 
---
Well Mirror Entity doesn't say 'when', it says 'after', so you're just wrong
---
He should have got 1 in the first 10 of each set though. Somethings not right or he has already opened packs from these sets before.
---
Fix full-screen on 2018 iPad Pro.
---
I beat mage priest and warlock with the unique bucket, mostly on the back of reno with potion of vitality tho
---
Didn't know warlock hero power was "Pull soulfire instead of any other card in your deck" :O
---
Also it's "A hero power"
---
So basically Ice Block in the form of a spell that takes place immediately rather than being set up first?
---
Since Time Out! is three mana, it would only be worth two mana at most as an effect on its own. Commanding Shout actually does pretty much what you're talking about, and that is seeing no play as a Warrior card. Maybe it would in a Zoo Warlock or Midrange Hunter, but I doubt it as other cards that would be objectively better like Revenge of the Wild are also not seeing play.
---
A strictly worse Time Out! probably wouldn't see much play either. Immune generally doesn't see play because the cards its printed on only affect cards temporarily and doesn't see print because if it lasted any longer than a turn, then it would break the game.
---
"Four mana 7/7" is the worst Hearhstone meme right now.
---
I finished 3 of them in like 3 to 4 tries but houndmaster I cannot finish him no matter what
---
16 900 dust and matches take an hour.
---
Well, no toads on walnut for me I guess
---
I'm gonna go for it and say tournament system and auto squelch option
---
Shudderwock Rumble Shaman would be more descriptive
---
Guldan is a good start. Even a basic zoo deck with doomguards and guldan as a reset button. 
---
Leeroy and Greenskin make me think Baku is a good craft.  You could probably make odd rogue AND odd paladin. 
---
So 1600 (Baku) plus 2000-3000 for some epics you might be missing, and still a healthy bankroll for the new rotation. 
---
There are still 3 months left in this set, so get 2-3 decks you can really learn, and go for it. 
---
General tip - you MUST have a way to deal 3 damage to enemy minions, as Hunter is a big class right now and can summon 4 3/3 wolves on turn 5. Your deck needs an answer. 
---
TLDR: have fun, use your dust. 
---
Nice
---
Next time if you want to play solitaire ask Cortana
---
That seems like a pretty powerful hand, no? You have turn 5, 6, 7, and 8 plays to put about a billion stats on the board. The problem isn't the deck, its your skill level. Don't expect to get legend just because you crafted a high-tier meta deck.
---
Mine might be a little basic but i hope there are new quests released with the first set of the new year. I love the quest mechanic and think as the old ones rotate out, having new ones is fun
---

Its not bad. Your plays matter more than your cards for most of the ranked ladder. I can get to rank 5 with a shitty meme deck. Anything after that is hard, but better players than me can get to legend with worst decks than what you have. As you play more, replace your cards with better ones you. Its a game after all
---
This is classic playing to win vs playing to not lose. The warrior is favored so it should be playing not to lose, ie it has to be mindful of how lucky the priest would need to get to win. 5 Mind Blasts is well within the range of possibilities, and if the warrior had accounted for it, they, well, wouldn‚Äôt have lost.
---
As much as I enjoy the memes and the highlights on this subreddit it's nice to see some actual interesting content that isn't a big serious discussion about "the state of the game" or something like that. Just an interesting and cool deck.
---
Astonishing!
---
Just pick giants + staff of summoning + control tools, worked for me
---
(1) you‚Äôre being impatient. that‚Äôs a great hand 
---
(2) if you have to learn when you need to just tempo out minions because of what your opponent is trying to do. sometimes you just play as cube as a vanilla 5-mana 4/6 because that‚Äôs your line to winning the game

I don't agree with this. I like seeing my swag. 
---
It's an online game with tons of players where the active player has a lot of control over what happens.
---
Online. Tons of players. Active player has control. Obnoxious behavior is inevitable. Thankfully, you're not forced to really participate in it beyond emotes which you can turn off and the occasional roper.
---
Yes, this is a tournament deck. It'll perform worse on the ladder.
---
Peanut is more fun and distinct though, even if it doesn‚Äôt make any sense 
---
I think the pick is Myra‚Äôs Unstable Element if you don‚Äôt have it yet. The card alone bumps the winrate of the deck up when you draw it, to the point where some people keep it in their mulligan. Otherwise, 100 percent Leeroy.
---
Thanks for the advice. I will be holding out on crafting the deck until spell hunter rotates out. I just wanted to experiment with a different way to play, but I do realize the deck does have a  play style that‚Äôs easy to get tired of. 
---
 Ahhh good ol Leeroy. 
---
Mojomaster zihi is a good counter though
---
whoosh?
---
Two important cards are [[Ultimate Infestation]] and [[Branching Paths]] which are both epic cards, and both rotating soon as well, so I'm not sure they'd be a good investment if you don't own them already
---
In the grand tournament you win or you have bugs 
---
Should I retag? I'm not used to posting to this Reddit. The card wasn't really meant as a joke, but more of a attempt to provide a solution to "Druids can't have cheap  weapons" problem.

One of the last finals, don‚Äôt know the players anymore, but was even lock against hunter. Lock managing to avoid death by being around one hp and almost to stabilise.
---
Peanut shaman was also a blast to watch, not sure if we are going to see it on ladder. As they casters said. It is like someone typed legendary in the collection and clicked almost all legendary.
---
In the beginning it was also awesome to see Hunterace winning the priest mirror by using opponent cleric to overdraw.
---
It happens a LOT in wild, there's not a ton of people playing wild.
---
Well, it's basically a meme deck. It's more about doing a combo with Gonk than just getting past the Lich King. I suppose I should have said that up front.
---
I really wish that were the case, it's so much easier to get to R5 in wild than in standard.
---
I prefer this kind of matches than those where you know the winner before turn one.
---
15 gives MUCH Better rewards
---
Rania is dangerously good with those thumbnails.

No one mentions that Shadow Visions is the card that made Divine Spirit + Inner Fire combo viable.

SERIOUS ESPORT
---
I played about 20 games and I faced (and played) a lot of decks that weren't any of these (Burgle Rogue, Deathrattle Rogue, Shudderwock Shaman, Mech Paladin, Mech Warlock, Mech Mage, Combo Priest to name a few.). And I never faced the same deck twice apart for mech hunter and they weren't even running the same cards. 
---
Loved the idea, sucks for people who have no Wild Cards.  Ur it was a solid effort and would like for them to keep doing it with different sets every time.
---
It's funny because having 10 at 0 mana is worse that having 1 at 10 mana.
---
Is this like a personal challenge? Because im pretty sure the adventure will stay after koft rotates.

It works great against Hunter thanks to Psychic Scream. It works great against aggro if you manage to complete the quest. And it's insta-win against Control.

Tournament mode or a mode where you could play a combination of wild and standard sets like in last weeks brawl. Would bring some much needed variety to the game.

---
Is the going first vs going second balanced here?
---
That would be cool but you would need a massive improvement of the Innkeeper's AI for that.
---
For example the Innkeeper doesn't know what's the wincondition of the deck is. If you give him a one-turn-kill deck, he will just try to play it for the best value and inadvertadly get overpowered

---
Not literally at all, subjectively, especially because the size of your collection greatly skewed the power level of your deck, as someone with no cards from either wild expansions my deck got stomped repeatedly. Only after I found I could let the rest if my deck be filled in did I do a tiny bit better, and then only if the random cards I got were any good. 
---
Modes that make me feel as though I'm being punished for not having wild sets aren't as fun, I've been playing since Old Gods too, and while most brawls aren't amazing I've played better ones and I believe there is the opportunity for many better ones.
---
Achievements are fun. And if seemingly every shitty Steam game can have dozens or hundreds of Achievements, *surely* HS could have *thousands*. But it hardly has any at all. That seems pretty weird to me. I mean, it would even promote more spending, if a lot of the achievements required owning specific cards.
---
How has Blizzard suddenly got to be so shitty at making games fun? 
---
Rank 20 is the new rank 25. Haven't you heard?

Exclusivity adds a lot of value to hero skins.
---
Some of them were sold for real money and people paid for exclusivity.
---
I find them a lot funnier than most hunter and paladin decks. Thief rogue is also incredibly fun.
---
Thanks, thats a really good way indeed!
---
Sick! Glad to see someone else wanted to try an inspire even mage deck. I got real excited about all the spell damage cards I could add until I realized it would only effect flame cannon and unexpected results T-T. Nice work!
---
How multiplayer is HS actually?
---
While Rexxar specifically is one of the worst designed cards in the history of HS for reasons I won't delve into, I don't mind late game win conditions. These decks are designed around drawing and stalling and using it to achieve victory. They leave others plenty of time to adapt and react, while building their own game plan.
---
Reno is actually an excellent example of what I don't like. If you look at a Reno deck, you will see an absolute mess of a deck. It's not built around Reno, as mere healing doesn't win against any control deck. It's just satisfying a condition where drawing the card early will win any aggro matchup and not drawing it pretty much always loses. It's incredibly binary, luck-based gameplay.
---
It's not the cards that require 10 cards to make it valuable that I mind. It's the cards you draw early, play early and leave an incredible swing no deck can reasonably withstand that I mind.
---
They just don't realize that everyone will be running [[Reckless Rocketeer]] insteaf if they really moved him lul.

It's also good against hunters and sometimes rogues :)

The written reports were not popular enough and I was never able to sell the idea to any esports news site either, there just is no interest in HS esports from the media.

That said, I'm experimenting with some other formats, so perhaps these will be useful:

OP was trying to point out Artifact is a "Hearthstone killer" but in the clip, Noxious laughed at how Monopoly has high viewers in Twitch.
---
Yeah seriously.  If you search Leeroy in subreddit's search bar for the last month, **one guy** has demanded that Leeroy be HoF'ed.
---
A few people have suggested Leeroy could be HoF'ed based simply on the fact that Blizzard generally doesn't like Charge minions, but those fall more in the range of speculation rather than "demands".
---
I think this may be worth coming back to post rotation, but currently it won't out perform the existing deck. It's a good thought though. 
---
That's a great quote.
---
Concede then, don't give them the satisfaction. Wait until they're about to pull it off though, assert dominance. 
---
Haha, I thought of that when I was writing the title
---
And I did shaman with a murlock deck and Everyfin is awsome
---
What server ? 
---
You can't buy them in game, however.
---
Cannot agree more with this. What separates good from great though is becoming aware of this earlier in the game and pouncing then. Sometimes it isn't that easy but if you've noticed his plays aren't what you thought they would be, chances are he's drawing real shit. Always keep this in your mind when trying to ladder, always

Druid is hardly dead. Sure, it was a severe nerf, but mecha'thun and togwaggle druid are still good. I'm currently 21-9 with togwaggle druid at rank 2 (standard).
---
Well yes :( 
---
Why? It was literally one turn kill.
---
Well, well, well. How the turntables
---
What? Combo simply does not work without Naturalises. Without them you still have plenty of time to kill Druid before Mecha'thun eventually dies or you have opportunity to silence/transform it. And hakkar combo is based on Toggwaggle swap. If Druid can't naturalise at least once you just swap back and that s it, you win.
---
Can't beat combo. So auto loses to one archetype. If there was no combo, would be higher. Its very good control deck. 
---
Okay so you just made a statement about poker. In the hearthstone sub. No context at all. How's that better? 
---
Nah I get that hearthstone is multiplayer, after all it certainly isn't single player.

Leeroy is something you can play around though. Pro players do it all the time, trying their best to protect themselves from it if they‚Äôre in range of 6-10-14 health.

I'd say that was the right play. It is much more likely that they had Polymorph in hand then the possibility of that secret being Vaporize. It would have been 72 damage if you went radiant elemental into PWS into radiant elemental into PWS into Extra Arms into Extra Arms into DS into DS into Inner Fire, but who cares, it was still lethal. 
---
hof the start up screen
---
I can't count all the times I've stabilized against an aggro deck only for them to topdeck leeroy and finish me off. I'd be glad to have that card removed forever.
---
Hunter **is** strong, the DK single-handedly make decks like odd warrior obsolete. This is why it's in every hunter deck.
---
I invite you to read this [open letter to Blizzard from a player](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a7rrmy/a_letter_to_blizzard_entertainment/)
---
Both of those are basic cards. They have said that they don't want to rotate basic cards
---
1) Buy Amazon coins with gift card.
---
2) Use an Amazon device or emulator to download Hearthstone.
---
3) Use Amazon coins to buy Hearthstone Packs through the game.
---
NOTE: There are comprehensive guides on this process elsewhere. I would look for those first before you purchase the coins. You may be able to save money or buy more packs if you go about it another way.
---
Good old turn 4 yeti, those where the days.
---
You can play one of the many taunts the game has to offer.
---
Also, 10 dmg high burst? midrange decks can pull off more dmg (think of kathrena play dead combos), and combo decks can just kill you instead. You can play arround 10 dmg if you can play arround 30. He is far from being broken.
---
good luck in tel aviv :)
---
i made a leeroy recently and it hasn't done much except add a bit of burst damage or a surprise clear. The deck would have won 95%+ games without him.
---
Hi, [OP of that thread here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/af7xwr/d_e_f_e_n_d_g_i_l_n_e_a_s/) Well played. 
---
Is it actually a card game tho?
---
Never got Akali, sadly.
---
It can be done with double spellstone too but obviously geist takes care of that too.
---
There are like four different good hunter decks making up that bar, so I think it's totally fine and actually quite great. And after years of druid dominance I'm happy to have them sit under 5% for a while.
---
I feel uneasy now. Plese stop stalking me man
---
The goal is the same, kill or be killed ü§î
---
Zihi doesn't interact with the combo beyond delaying it, so the only neutral combo disrupter card is dirty rat, which I will concede DOES allow for hand interaction. However, we're not worried about that because those cards don't even necessarily always work against combo decks anyways. Your opponent having a minion on board for the express purpose of the combo and then you killing that minion will ALWAYS stop the combo, though. There's no out, there's no way for thelm to OTK you otherwise in this situation. That single turn of guaranteed interactability regardless of what deck you play or class makes it a TTK. It literally can never work in one turn.
---
&gt;ssively bad actor.
---
wait T1 in that video?
---
Hell, I'll miss a 50/50 4 straight turns. 
---
This brawl has really made me yearn for more unique formats in terms of sets that can be used
---
Oh okay so if it was 29 HP it's also not an OTK. Good to know. 
---
Trump played a control deck with no card above 5 mana and six 1-drops
---
\&gt; I understand that [r/hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone) is mostly populated by casuals/whales/non-ladder grinders and these kind of people prefer control and combo decks and hate aggressive and midrange strategies 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Congrats, this might be the dumbest, most prejudiced grandiose statement I've seen in this sub yet, and that's really saying something...
---
Never mind the fact you haven't got a single shred of evidence to support that theory, the whole premise of people being up in arms about leeroy isn't even true... people on this sub just love to talk shit about any card, really. I've seen as much hate for leeroy as I've seen for control cards like UI or SP, or combo cards like Maly, or literally any card that anyone has ever lost to. This sub is just /r/butthurtIlost, in a nutshell, but it's definitely not hating on anything that specific.
---
Also, the entire game is "mostly populated by casuals/whales/non-ladder grinders"... that definitely doesn't mean people like control better, as is quite obvious when you see the amount of curvestoning and proactive decks and how they're clearly more popular and always have been.
---
Idk, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs killed anything yet, it seems like a lot of people just play both still
---
My objective with any stretegy game is just to prove i‚Äôm smarter than the other guy. 
---
Yeah it does fill out a hypothetical list, which is why I said talks about. I personally don't agree either. Imo it isn't a problematic card, aggro decks arnt good because of leeroy
---
MTGA comes pretty close
---
I wonder if DK Warrior is important for the deck?Any suggestions about what to replace it with?Dr Boom or a tech?
---
As an orca, it is especially infuriating when people call us killer whales because we have to kill things to fucking EAT. We're also not whales, we're fucking DOLPHINS. 
---
Neither really fit the bill for what Hall of Fame is meant for.
---
Ice block is hall of famed
---
Hall of Fame don't work through requests and complaints (fortunately). It goes through data and analysis (allegedly and hopefully). Leeroy is just a 5 mana deal 6, and many decks do that or something close to that in a way or another. It would only be a problem if it was constantly featured in some sort of bizarre combo. To my knowledge, leeroy has been nerfed before and today it's hardly prominent in the gameplay scenario. And if you die to leeroy, you probably were already losing.
---
Have you ever noticed that EVERY TIME there is an article on a topic you are very knowledgeable about, it contains glaring errors?  This isn't just about gaming.

Now consider all the articles you've read on topics which you are not knowledgeable about.  Feeling confident in their accuracy?

There is a name for this law but I forget what it's called.  Anybody know offhand?

  *I have heard rank 5 is doable and what new players should aim for.* 
---
I always thought that rank 5 is quite an achievement, definitely not something new players should aim for. At least not in first few seasons. But I might be wrong..
---
I recall that before changes to rank seasons reset we got information about % of players at your rank... I wonder how many players reach ranks 15 - 10 - 5 - and legend. 
---
Sure you can!

If this minion is dormant, deal 5 damage to opponent and then awaken.

For anyone wondering, this is precisely what it feels like to play Yugioh.
---
Excactly. An "Oops" would be better to signify "Oops, you just lost the game buddy"
---
&gt;Now take all those and compare it to game made by most respected and experienced producers at this field.
---
Yeah Richard Garfield really is an amateur card game designer, that's why artifact is flourishing.
---
Those were all games this subreddit has parroted as killing Hearthstone at some point over the last three years. Especially Shadowverse, Gwent, and Artifact.
---
&gt;I don't know dude, potential is insane and IMO MTG:A is only game from all these above that could shake HS position on market.
---
Literally the same thing said about each of those games (except maybe the Runescape one but I threw it in because I found it enjoyable, plus memes)
---
At some point, I heard someone asking to HoF Fireball because it was too powerful, same with Frostbolt.
---
Deep inside, some people out there think the game would improve if every cards had the power level of River Crocolisk and every match went to fatigue.
---
Only spells allowed would need to be stuff like "pay 2X mana to do X damage to a creature" because god forbid anything hitting face, ever.
---
And this is why i will never take hearthstone seriously. A card game should not have this happen. I hated this game when i put money into it, but since i stopped, if these kinda bs happens, i just concede, shrug my shoulders, and say i didnt put any money into it.
---
Yes, some Chinese company funded them.
---
I see that repression effect took the wheel in this thread. I don't feel urge to convince everyone on my theories, I just explain my opinion on topic - does MTG:A have more potential than every other game mentioned above or not. 
---
Ubiquitous.
---
I have Genn. But I need LK too. Don't have giants either.
---
Take a screenshot 
---
I've never had all 3 pieces show up as options in all the runs I've done. Feels bad.

2 player battle royale game :)
---
I purposely left out journalistic ethics from my comment, since that's another discussion entirely. (And what would an audience gain from Hearthstone being a Battle Royale game, instead of a competitive card game?)
---
Certainly there is a light side and a dark side to this. The newsroom I worked in was one of those "get the facts right" ones. (it was even our slogan) We would not say a word, sometimes letting our competitors beat us to the punch, if we weren't absolutely sure about something, and our reputation preceded us in the community. That's not to say I didn't get calls from people calling us "fake news" because they heard differently from Fox News, Brietbart, etc.
---
Could we have made up stuff to cater more to our audience? Sure. Are there news outlets who do this? Absolutely. But that's not something we as a newsroom wanted to compromise on. There's still a huge audience who wants the well-researched truth, and that's who we catered to.
---
Chain concede games until you run into players with starter cards.

dirty rat boomship
---
Wait, which class has "fun" stall? Warlock, Shaman? Nope. It is just in general unpleasant to be grinded out of resources. 
---
Not sure why you're here then.
---
&gt;there's a very clear difference between something in hand and something on board
---
No there isn't. Nowhere in you comments have you specified or defined these difference or their importance. "It's totally clear dude" isn't how semantics work.
---
&gt;You can try to semantics me out of this argument
---
THIS ENTIRE ARGUMENT IS NOTHING BUT SEMANTICS, YOU DIMWIT. The argument is about whether something is or isn't an OTK. To do so you need to compare it to a definition. That definition needs a clear basis, arguments for it and no flaws or contradictions. That is pure semantics. The arguments can be based on what the general public thinks, but what the general public thinks is never a direct definition, because the general public is not a single entity that can define something.
---
An OTK is a one turn kill. That is the definition I give it. At the beginning of the turn, your opponent is at full health, at the end they're dead. *That* is a good definition of an OTK. It has nothing to do with interactability, and doesn't need any specifics added to it to make it work. A definition of an OTK deck is a deck that aims to win through a combo that results in an OTK: whether an OTK deck is good or not can depend on its interactability, as well as many other factors. That has nothing to do with whether or not the combo you're trying to pull off is an OTK or not. 
---
Devil's advocate but Hunter is really easy to target and beat.  They all play differently and have slightly different match-ups but they all lose pretty hard to Priest and Paladin.
---
I just checked, and overall I have 4605 wins. Didnt know I played that much. I had a pause of like a year and a half
---
Left it to youtube.

Half of me playing this game is against my friends so there‚Äôs that, and I use a meme level theif rogue that I have a 55% win ratio against hunters/otk/cloning priest. Yes it‚Äôs a little lucky but they‚Äôre still viable just gotta use the right memes. Half the time I get to shuffle 2 copy‚Äôs of academic espionage 
---
If Leeroy heads to HoF, Priest needs to lose both the 1 drop bitch and power word shield.
---
Mage is super fun, you have frozen minion every turns, you can't summon more since they'll die to AoE anyway, and you know they're getting frozen until they get cleared anyway.
---
What are you referring to here exactly. What did they turn to complete shit in the past? 
---
I have a legendary for every expansion except un'goro and that doesn't seem worth buying as it rotates out soonish. 
---
is there a way i can find guide / watch gameplay for a deck? i just crafted odd rouge as my first ‚Äúgood‚Äù deck and i‚Äôm clueless on how to play it
---
There‚Äôs actually a Marvel card game out already. It‚Äôs called Marvel Battle Lines, and it‚Äôs quite fun. 
---
Then it's actually not bad at all. Could compete with the one that reduces the cost of cards in hand.
---
as F2P always i'm a meta behind in standard, so i play wild when trying to rank up.
---
arena is very changed from back in the day so you may get a better average now,  3-4 wins is  like packs at a discount.  
---
Loatheb is a staple in many wild decks.  I'd keep it.      
---
Kel-Thuzad  goes well in deathrattle rouge with Silver Vanguard and Kobold Illusionist if you have the other big legionaries in that deck for them to hit.  
---
PS there are several budget standard decks for mid-ranks. ... like under 2k .  Check out [HSreply.net](https://HSreply.net)  and [hearthpwn.com](https://hearhpwn.com) for deck ideas

Im going to assume this isnt a troll, so Deathstalker Rexxar for sure

Since it's announcement Artifact was badly received by the public, after that there was little to none advertising for the game and it was almost forgotten until the end of 2018 when some rare footage was shown and the the streamers community started talking about it, hyping its much more modern interface, advanced draft mode, higher skill cap and other minor aspects. When finally the game was unveiled there was some controversy over its lack of any sort of progression, Valve designed Artifact to be free of any grind mechanics but apparently they forgot to make it fun to play, according to some people. The pay to play mechanic was really badly designed and it generated some controversy, you can find some videos on YT. To top it all it is extremely streaming unfriendly, high quality but dull graphics, game taking place on multiple boards that the viewer can't see, unlimited number of cards in hand that the player have to manually scroll and many other things. Since it's release Artifact was massively reworked to try to satisfy the customers but after not even 2 months the public interest declined so much that what used to be this huge multi million dollars project is now a meme.
---
I mean "that's much lamer than 5 gay mages, amiright" or something that doesn't play on idea that "gay=bad" would have been significantly better. That way you make the pun without implying that straight mages are somehow preferable to gay ones.   
---
Sure, OP was probably just focused on the pun...but there's value in refusing to perpetuate the still prevalent use of the word gay/worse terms as a slur. 
---
this aint exactly reddit worthy but aight
---
the last one to survive wins
---
he never said "thats much lamer than 5 gay mages", he responded to a guy saying "i faced 5 straight mages" with "better than 5 gay mages" as a way to mock **his gramaticall error** for saying straight mages instead of mages straight. He is not saying "haha gay = bad" not anything like that. In any case, he is being rude to the first comment for making a snarky remark on his grammar, but he is far from being a homophobic coment.
---
Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
---
Yeah but in Dungeon Run Ayas are a dime a dozen.
---
Rexxar is more important, but rotates in April
---
Tracker? 
---
^ this. Leeroy burst combos haven't even been that prevalent. If they were, every single class has a direct counter in taunt minions. There are plenty of combo decks that are essentially uncounterable, I'm not sure why Leroy would be the one to go.
---
GIANT GREEN MEN
---
Thanks. I'll definitely keep trying
---
Unless he play the armour boss cards/Spirit Lash or his taunt minion, No. Soo in the worst possible RNG way, I could lose (becaus I only had 3 minions with over 5 health, but sure, I had some bubble minions)
---
But I won anyway relatively easy. I played odd pally a bit and Smorced with recruits and few bubble shield minions. Played Sunkeeper and got him down to 50ish health. I cleared his chests with the sword that would then clear my side of board soo he would not be able to heal an insane amount of damage (flashbacks).
---
Played the crown (from chest) and got 2 Ragnaros Lightlords and pretty much won there.
---
Legend from f2p? I'm so jealous lol, congrats. What decks did u use? 
---
I'm honestly surprised it's as good as it is, the auto tap feature that is. It works perfectly 99% of the time, but that 1% of the time that it fucks you, and you weren't paying close enough attention, it feels real bad. MTGO is turds though, I agree.
---
Isn't Kor'Kron Elite good? I mean it's not meta by any means at the moment, but it's a pretty good card I think.
---
Seriously! If it's a pop culture science "truth" it's usually more like based on a true idea. Like the "If your mom's dad us bald you definitely will be bald." Yeah, you are probably more likely to be bald because there is a genetic component to baldness, but, it's not some 1:1 if maternal grandfather bald then you will definitely 100% of the time be bald. Then you get the "well since I know a guy that was true about, so, it must be true" confirmation bias that perpetuates the bad science.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with you, but ranked floors and legend are fun places to test out meme decks- at rank 5 there are quite a few mechathun decks, Murloc decks, quest decks, etc. it‚Äôs always satisfying when you can beat a tier 1 deck  with a goofy deck (and trust me, there are some shitty players at rank 5 so this happens quite often)
---
A party mode where 8 people can join in a group and share a group chat, while the table rotates between two people (and the rest automatically join as spectators on one of the players). That, alongside the new "share a deck" feature, is one of the things I want the most in Hearthstone. Allows for more casual play easily in a group of friends. Gives me something to do with my huge card collection that isn't Ranked &amp; Competitive. 
---
I could make a strong argument for a lot of my friends to come back to Hearthstone with more in-client social stuff like this.
---
HoF is not only about strength. Coldlight Oracle wasn't too strong, for example. It's also about the design restrictions that card creates.
---
Preparation is a great example of a card like that, actually. Rogue seems to not get any good spells lately, and the ones they do (e.g. Wanted) are overcosted, seemingly because devs try to tip-toe around Prep. If they make the spells too cheap, then they can become broken with Prep. But now that they make them so expensive, they're just too bad to play without Prep.
---
The only great Rogue spell printed this entire year was Raiding Party and guess what, it was really overpowered with Prep. For 0 mana and 2 cards you drew 3, so you got +1 card advantage for free, as well as you always drew the win condition of your deck (Kingsbane + probably some weapon buffers). And guess what, that strategy was nerfed very quickly. 
---
Innervate was nerfed and it only gave 2 mana. Prep gives 3 mana. Of course, Innervate is also much more flexible, because it lets you play minions too. But right now Innervate is playable at 1 mana, even though it's mostly used to get the spells out sooner, not minions... and Prep gives three times that.
---
I was advocating the Prep rotation since Hall of Fame was introduced. I think that would be healthy for Rogue in the long run, because it would allow them to print better Rogue spells without making them too potent with Prep.

Except [odd](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/223/odd-warrior#tab=matchups)/[odd quest](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/224/odd-quest-warrior#tab=matchups) warrior has positive winrate against every type of hunter that is not deathrattle-based.
---
No I rather they gave more new cards and made a better conversion rate for commons and rares. 
---
Defile is a board clear but it often feels bad to play against. Aside from amazing full-board calculated clears, those are cool.
---
Of course MtG:A won't kill HS but you can't really compare MtG to these other ccg's.
---
With a 26 year history it's the only really serious contender so far.
---
InfinityStone: Heroes of Marvel
---
So is starcraft 1v1 tournament standard not multiplayer? Are fighting games not multiplayer games?
---
If I remember correctly, someone from Team 5 (Brode I think?) said Stonetusk Boar was the most limiting card on their design space from the classic/basic set.
---
To expand on this, Pizza streams pretty much daily and plays mostly odd rogue during the streams, while the other streamers kind of use it as a secondary deck if they're playing it at all.
---
Does anyone have an open beta key? And is it FTP friendly?
---
It needs to be a new game mode not wild. Wild is there for people who want to use all their cards, no some on a rotational basis. A separate game mode with this would be great, but don't change wild to be anything except using all the cards.
---
As someone who has the Undatakah Taunt, I dreaded this.  I figured the shadow priest may be popular again with the new totems.  
---
this brawl was a treat for wild players. i had to make the weirdest face hunter to be able to get my pack. this is a good idea for the game as another ode that changes monthly/weekly/every 4 months etc but not a good idea for a tavern brawl.
---
You're supposed to make friends and play those meme decks against them.
---
How do you think MtG:Arena and Artifact players do it?
---
void ripper is pretty good ubless they play the second plague
---
Yep.  Pizza is my favorite streamer of all time, not sure if he is underrated or not, but he's very skilled and seems like a genuinely nice guy.  I wish he posted on youtube.

It's really important that you understand the deck you're playing against so that you can leverage your clears for the most value.  Remember that you can offset 4 damage every turn with only 2 mana.   As a control warrior you are almost never playing for tempo.  So dont get caught in that trap.  With efficient removal it can sometimes be tempting to play for tempo.  Then when you run out of removal you realize the mistake.   Dont do it.  Slow down and just let the game flow.

It's not even a tiny bar yet, that's barely low.

Yes, and the same can be said for cloning gallery, which did take some time to get figured out (thanks largely to Asmodai, but it was quite a while after Boomsday dropped I believe).
---
&gt; The difficulty is on par with previous single player content
---
So insanely hard and lengthly like dungeon run? 
---
I believe they did change mana wyrm but not sure if they will change this, prob if so they would've by now.

As it turns out, the card does the thing it says it does.

Sounds like someone has a little bias going on here.

Yup - A good android version of the popular PC etc. version and you might see Hearthstone numbers drop drastically.  
---
I truly think people don;'t realize how much of HS is tied into it being a really nicely constructed mobile game.  I would not play it if there wasn't an android version.
---
Thank you for help! I got one add request so far, #1330 it that you?
---
I don't see the problem here! it's Winter and i run HS on my phone as a rechargable handwarmer
---
When a card is HoF its moved into the Hall of Fame "Set" if you would. They are no longer able to be played in standard but in wild they are fair game. Think of HoF being an express train to rotation. You can still use the cards in wild and wild formats but in standard it is no longer able to be added to a deck. When they do this you get a full dust refund for any card they have HoF'd and get to retain copies of the card for use in wild.
---
With a cameo from Oney and Psychic Pebbles

I play standard ladder only to complete quests and screw around with janky builds while occasionally farming ranked wins so I don't ever go past rank 15 here. As you say, definitely not every deck here is a tier 1 deck or even a budget attempt at it. Besides, if your meme build can't ever win against tier 1/2 deck, especially with help ever present RNG, what's the point of it? I'm all for playing jank, but playing outright trash is just unfun.
---
Look at the card history.  I played the Mounted Raptors.  They played a Questing Adventurer.  They played the Mark of Y'Shaarj.  Guess card draw is king!
---
I'd love to see Leeroy HoF'd as much as I'd like to see a hard limit on how many legendaries you can have in your deck. That is to say, I'd like it very much.
---
It'll never happen, of course, since those sweet, sweet legendaries bring in enough money that having a more balanced game isn't quite the consideration that it might otherwise be.
---
It‚Äôs because his sub is full of emotional people prone to knee-jerk reaction and echo chambers, and they won‚Äôt stop until the game is truly destroyed.

You're playing a more aggressive deck. Those two secrets aren't aggressive, especially if you don't have a spellstone.

This will probably get buried. But i am having a ball and winning quite a few games with this 52%~ prcent wins. I know this dosent fix your problem but i just slam my head against the wall until i win for the last few expansions.

It works with various effects though. Sometimes it will throw your starter deck against tier 1/solid tier 2 deck, but I appreciate the attempt.
---
I play heal zoo priest every now and then. One spirit lash and one circle of healing  and u got a nice lightwarden otk.
---
&gt; Artifact players do it?
---
All dozen of them.
---
Ok i resent
---
I had 1 Deathwing in my deck. Dragon roar for the 2nd. War Master Voone for the 3rd and 4th. Another dragon roar for the 5th, and then another Voone for 6-10. They all cost zero because that rumble run shrine makes dragons in your hand cost 1 less whenever you summon a dragon.
---
Why would it be a bug?
---
Genn and Baku were bad ideas. "Build around" cards should be much more restrictive. Hearthstone has so many solid neutrals that you can have a strong core for either style of odd or even. 
---
Genn and Baku also highlight how the hero powers aren't even close to being balanced. Very unlikely the Odd or Even Priest ever sees play because the heal is so reactive.
---
As for OTK decks, this game desperately needs more disruption tools. And not just in Warlock. I love playing grindy slow resource management decks and the number of OTK decks in the game right now are so oppressive.  I was trying to play Viper's Shaman list and it was super fun, until you run in Uther Pally and Tog Druid.
---
I'm not sure Kibler's right about Hunter. Hunter is much more interactive than the Druid lists that were ruining the previous game because it's central strategy is board-centric. But Rexxar is easily one of Hearthstone's most powerful cards. Lots of times you will "interact" with the Hunter's early to midgame only to lose to Build-a-Beast. 
---
And the many "variations" we see in Hunter now are very much a product of players trying to get the edge in the mirror. 
---
I much preferred the Druid meta because I could tech in cards (Geist and Ooze) to beat them. What is the Hunter tech that will counteract the power levels of Rexxar or Zul'jin?
---
I honestly didn't notice that the post's argument was centered around Geist. In which case yes it would not work in a meta where most people run Geist. 
---
OMG, I was watching my buddy play this game.  When he got you to 1 and he was at 22 he says something like "he def has 4 mind blast for game but i'm going to get hit with 5 and end up on reddit". I can't wait to link him this lol.
---
They just uploaded a developer update on youtube today. Duplicate protection similar to HS, bo3 ladder. Damn, I might just give it a try again
---
Whoa dude, you alright?
---
Why all the hate for Kibler?
---
They banned mc tech from arena
---
I don't think you'll get any concrete answers because the hate-train against NetEase is strong and demanded to be the default mind-state.
---
FULL DISCLOSURE: I don't play any mobile games(outside of HS) so I am admittedly ignorant when it comes to NetEase titles. If they are just basically derivative stuff but weaved with mis-transactions, then we can see why people are against NetEase in general. 
---
Well but you gotta be good to pilot meme decks to rank 10-5. At least know why your meme deck is good against the popular decks and how to beat them (although using way suboptimal cards).
---
The idea of meme decks is a deck that is clearly not good, that uses a strategy that is basically a joke. You arent suposed to win most of your matchups against real decks, you are supposed to pop off a win every now and then, but not win more than half.
---
Think of gonk, yeah OP can gonk someone every 10 games, but dont complain that he cant play gonk in ladder because everyone wins him, because thats exactly what should happen if OP plays gonk XD
---
How about you come play against my cloning gallery?  you'll STFU about leeroy... :)
---
Wait for April to do anything drastic. The yearly rotation hits when the next expansion drops in april.
---
You might be able to cobble together an even shaman list. It's pretty economic.

---
I still haven't played it. Still haven't heard a good reason why I should.
---
From the draft, not from the game. 
---
Most cards won't ever see play in wild &gt;&gt; I would keep the staples and epics/ legendaries that have "potential" and dust the rest if you wanna craft something (although it's an akward time because of the upcoming rotation and the power discrepancy between the last 2 years)
---
Not everyone can do that
---
not letting me just choose my shrine is still a problem, not recording which ive won with is still a problem.  and honestly most of the stuff is pretty OK but a huge pet peeve of mine is the pirate power to steal your cards in a game mode about getting cool and powerful interesting cards is super badly designed.
---
but i agree once you get a shrine you want to play its pretty good gameplay wise now.  shame they just decided to shoot themselves in the face with the mode to start with when they released better already.
---
I've talked about this with a friend about how HS balancing team is abysmal.
---
From not learning from past mistakes, to their stances on buffing cards, their poor handling on nerfing, and how they just seem to add tech cards way to late.
---
I think about this one convo about the Evolve theme Shaman has and when it came out me and my friend were worry about it. Cheating out mana has always been strong but to have an aoe effect on it was insane. We then talked about how you would rein such a mechanic before it goes out of hand. Our conclusion was either increase the cost or just introduce bad cards into the cardpool. Sure enough Evolve Shaman popped out near the end of that WOTG and was basically carried by how strong it was. So now every expansion we get shitty cards in every card cost and this mechanic which should be OP is now bad because of it.
---
He was also the weakest of the four. 
---
jeweled macaw into jan'alai seems like a good template for the Level 1 Crook - Level 35 Mafia Boss meme
---
dungeon run
---
it‚Äôs not arena
---
Ah ye makes sense 
---
The honest reason some legends suck ? It‚Äôs because there is a pity timer. If they can shove a Millhouse, or a Bwonsamdi down your throat instead of the card you want, then you‚Äôll buy more packs.
---
Janky picks like when you get offered a Legendary but the choices are Lorewalker Cho, The Darkness, and Archmage Arugal.  (I picked Arugal.  Actually pretty decent when he doesn't die immediately.  Also turn 5 Arugal + Arcane Intellect usually works out well.)

For me when I stopped carrying about making my own decks and just looked for fun and functional decks, the game became more fun (and functional).  Deck crafting is only one aspect to the game and to do it right is always a long, grueling process of iteration.  I'd imagine that many don't' find it to be fun, but won't claim to know any percentages.
---
Cabal Shadow Priest has been around for a long time though?
---
That guy is a good card, he's seen constructed play and it isn't hard to make him good in arena 
---
It was probably just written by someone who doesn't give a shit to fill space on a page. Who gives a shit if its accurate? Its a nonsense top ten article about mobile games in a print newspaper...

Szczups#2465 EU quest trade. You go first but I can show you my quest
---
You won't find a deck you cannot identify, because the cardpool in hearthstone is small enough, and the playerbase is large enough, that almost every possible deck will have been created shortly after an expansion release.
---
What do you want people to do? Slamming cards that have no synergy with each other into a deck because it's unique?
---
Because I'm being a raucous asshole?
---
Point in case, once again.
---
No I just deleted the post. Discuss it with someone else. 
---
Or there are a lot of people trying to push it up so they can hear if there really is anyone saying this.  People upvote topics of discussion they want to have, not just things they agree with.
---
&gt;As soon as they made the Copy/Paste deck link feature the game went downhill.
---
I seriously doubt that has much of anything to do with the number of meta decks on the ladder. Deck codes only made it easier, but it's not like there were people before who couldn't be bothered to copy decks one card at a time before.
---
This isn't really a deck builder's game, but that's not really a problem either.
---
Did you know water is wet?
---
didn't get rafaam to play himself. I feel like that may do something.

I've always argued against any sort of OTK.  Stalling and cheating out cards is fine.  It only becomes a problem when you can stall and/or cheat your way to 30+ damage in a single turn.  Without that, the Druid stalls itself to defeat because it doesn't have enough threats, and cheating out a card is not a big deal if it's reasonably balanced.  Those stalling and cheating cards exist in arena but they are not high tier cards because they're not a problem without the OTK.
---
Or Sen'Jin. I never thought I'd miss Nax, but here I am.
---
Rock? Perfectly balanced. 
---
It's simply not possible to call a deck your "own" in a card game with a small cardpool and a playerbase of millions.
---
I tend to make my own decks, but I also don't play super competitively (you can find me anywhere from 20 to 10 at any given point.)
---
I feel ya though. Homebrew decks are hit and miss, in that the established meta decks are popular because the kinks have been worked out over thousands of players playing thousands of games, whereas a custom doesn't have that benefit. It can still perform wonderfully if you work at making a deck that you understand you have to pilot expertly to be competitive, and at the same time, sometimes you can be a little sloppy and ride the wave of the "unexpected" effect, where your opponent has no idea what to play against, where you do.
---
As to your original question, what percentage? I'd imagine it's a little higher than you'd think, in that while countless players use online resources, there are still a ton of players who don't. Two of my friends and my wife all play, and none of them care to dive into the meta or net deck, they just build and play, which makes me 1/4 of the people I know who play, who would even know how to netdeck. I can't say that number extends across everyone (it probably doesn't), but it's still a great question!

---
Casual has a hidden MMR that matches you with people of similar skill. I don't know how long you've played, but if you play and win long enough, your casual MMR will increase enough that you will get matched only with tryhards playing netdecks. For me there is barely any difference between casual and ranked.
---
So your hp stays at 1 even if it gets upgraded?
---
That was a really good article. Thanks for posting.
---
I remember finding synergy with Atog &amp; Disciple of the Vault while opening a booster box of Mirrodin I got for Christmas. Playing that deck and then seeing Ravager with almost the same deck list after the next set was really cool for 13yo me

Secret hunter is the gayest shit i've yet to see in HS.
