I know this is a shitpost, but describing these cards as "sexy" is weird.

Wait wtf
---
We may have reached peak circlejerk.
---
i don't see what this gets you in arena. at best it sets you up for a large removal turn 5 (starfall? blizzard with coin?) against aggro decks, which are a minority in arena play. and even if you're clearing the board, it's probably better to save the card resource and play a higher value minion that has a chance to survive if they choose not to trade.
---
Not sure how Dane is comparable to Toast or Thijs.
---
How is that op?
---
Oh, its deffo possible, just not who op thought it was.
---
Is this irony?
---
The thing I like about this is that you don't have to go all in on this, it could just slot into Tempo Rogue as a combo finisher.  Play aggressive, keep your opponent on the back foot.  Play Leeroy + Shadow of Death, attack for 6.  Next turn Myra's and attack for 12-18 and have 5 mana leftover for other shenanigans
---
id do set hp to 15 but not cap it probbaly.

---
I just got Merc 280 11 matches in a row.
---
its such a slap in the face for them to take away cards because they are off theme and make a whole fucking blog post about it and put out random off theme crap for paladin  and this
---
Also rush minions you put in your constructed deck will always be better than a random reborn card. That being said I think this card is still very strong.
---
Yeah, after I said that I went up against them, lost, and now I am seeing a lot more of them. (not that bad though)
---
When you Tess the wock and then the wock casts the Tess it's joyous.
---
Pilfer was changed because it is in the classic set. That is the style of "burgle" that will be used for future cards. 
---
Retrospectively changing the older cards would annoy a lot of people for little gain. Over time there will be a collection of cards using both types of effect so you will have the choice in wild as to which one you want to use.
---
I daresay we will see versions of these older cards created using the new mechanic in future expansions.
---
For some reason I actually read this whole thing. 
---
TLDR: Jar dealer is underrated. It will see a lot of play in zoo warlock and perhaps other zoo-like aggro decks. Zoo warlock might become a tier 1 deck (I personally disagree but that’s what he says).

---
radji#11799  NA Quest Trade, you go first, I can show
---
Class legendaries are usually more powerful within that class though because they are designed specifically for a class with synergies and mechanics of that class in mind though. Some of the legendaries released this time are rather lacking in that regard.
---
DR.7 of the set
---
Hinted at where? I love when devs hint at future cards but can never seem to find the interviews where that happens
---
I wouldn't say not better.
---
Not sure why everyone is going gaga over this, it's incredibly weak.
---
DS/Taunt is +1/+2 over a basic card for 1 mana that sees no play.  
---
DS/Windfury would be really good if it survives but at 7 Mana its way too late to just drop random value plays.  
---
DS/Rush is a 7 Mana taunt restricted fireball with a good upside but at +3 Mana, seems way too expensive to justify.  
---
Windfury/Taunt is clearly the worst and utterly pointless.  
---
Windfury/Rush is just about the only combo people will choose but it can't kill anything super large by itself and nearly anything you'd want to rush turn 7+ will have 3 or more attack so this is nearly guaranteed to die, and then it just becomes a really limited neutral sidegrade to Flamestrike.  
---
Rush/Taunt is literally just a sidegrade to War Bear.
---
To me this is just a really weak version of Al'Akir. This might find a home in some mid-range deck but is absolutely awful for aggro and not really useful for control either.
---
Really disappointed they gave such a mediocre reveal to the guy. The mage secret is going to have far more impact on the meta.
---
Seems good.  I hate it.
---
I'm pretty sure Dane is the only consistent wild streamer
---
As Whirt the All Knowing said, "*We're all Hunters in our own way."*
---
[2:15](https://youtu.be/oStJPmFz3Q0?t=135) is a filthy lie. 
---
Priests aren't allowed to hit face.
---
Thanos: I am inevitable
---
Anduin: Wow!
---
Though you'd obviously rather not take the damage, I think most of the time this is still better than explosive trap. The bump in damage from 2 to 3 AOE is significant and the fact that this can only be activated by a minion attack means this is much better against aggressive decks with weapons (and druid) since they can't just use their weapons/hero power to hit face with no minions on the board to bypass the board clear. So decks that want to go small and wide will have trouble playing around this effectively. 
---
Plus, mage already got 2 incredibly powerful secret synergy minions this set, so I can definitely see a secret mage deck forming and it's looking pretty good. Though since the new secret synergy stuff is a bit less aggressive than in the past, I'm thinking this new iteration of secret mage will be a bit closer to midrange than the pure tempo/burn secret decks of yore.
---
BEST. REVEAL. VIDEO. EVER!!!1!
---
Al'Akir's little brother who probably isn't as good but overcompensated by working out a *lot*.
---
Reminds me of zilliax but more balanced becsuse you have to choose between offensive and defensive keywords. I like that it's relevant at any point in the game; if you're behind you can potentially 2 for 1 with rush and another keyword and when you're ahead you can establish a hard to remove body that either protects your life total and lets you stabilize or threatens to push 12 damage the next turn.
---
The addition of rush being a choice is huge though.
---
Name something that removes it easily that isn't a card that just does that to anything - hex, poly
---
Or Rush Divine Shield.
---
This expansion Zilliax
---
Honestly, that's worse than what we have now.
---
Nah, it just gives it windfury twice, which is useless.
---
Shudderwock
---
Rush and windfury can be situationally amazing too, this card is pretty dope.
---
Yeah, this just seems independently good, and a handful of synergies will make it amazing. Reminds me of Zilliax in terms of general quality for a neutral legend.
---
*After*, so unlike explosive trap, the mage takes the damage? 
---
So even with this trap up, you could still kill him with Leeroy or something like that.
---
ALL minions.
---
Blizzard trying real hard to pretend this isn't a Choose Twice like Branching Paths so that it doesn't look like their infringing Druid's class identity.
---
This represents more than 5k invested, thx for financing first 2 wings of next adventure
---
Hes got well under half of the golden legendaries though...
---
It's like Witch's Brew and Echo all over again
---
Wow
---
WOW
---
The flexibility is what makes it so powerful. This card will be in a lot of decks
---
Chad Akir
---
Didn't they say there weren't going to be any other support cards for Highlander other than the 4 Explorer's League members?
---
?
---
New priest card: draw the rest of your deck and shoot them at random enemies.
---
Well that is one solid point.
---
Can see this card being used in heavy decks with pure power. Will have to see if I can get lucky and grab one myself.
---
It is inferior, it cannot go face!
---
Technically Echo does have at least one effect that differs thanks to the keyword, with Mistwraith, the Rogue card that gains+1/+1 whenever an echo card is played. That pisses me off because they could have easily printed an entirely different card and avoided the nonsensical interaction with Witch's Brew.
---
Screenshot
---
It's 9 mana for the second copy with random keywords from shudder
---
No, I totally get it. Getting high rolled by Big Priest or Dark Bargain Lock or older stuff like Naga Lock can be super tilting. I just play enough games at the rank 10/15 floors where it's not super serious and just move on to the next game to try and do my broken thing.
---
Control shaman too, brings a tear to my eye
---
100 gold? Am I blind? That's 360 gold.
---
7 mana makes this card nuts. I think 8 would be too much.
---
Rogue quest might also have to do with playing cards from another class, or minions that didn’t start in your deck. “Stolen goods”
---
P2w btw
---
This card could just say divine shield rush and it would be played in a ton of decks as a double power flanking strike on a fucking discount, the fact that you can play this on a naked board as a divine shield windfury to instantly create huge pressure or play it as divine shield taunt to protect yourself makes this one of the best cards ever printed.
---
Decklist?
---
Cause like...there isn't one on HS replay, and googling "wild fungalmancer face hunter" turns up a bunch of decks without fungalmancer, and this list:
---
https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1285489-odd-baku-face-hunter-wild
---
Which...looks terrible.  (Why is a face deck running Azalina Soulthief, Witch's Cauldron, and Explosive shot?)
---
So basically it's a powered up explosive trap for one more mana and one more damage but cannot go face. Useless! Face is the place! 
---
Naw but joking aside this seems pretty weak. Unless mage get some more secrets that trigger from hitting face, this is insanely easy to play around
---
Quality post
---
7 vs 8 mana is pretty important
---
This feels like a Zilliax type card that's gonna go in tons of decks.
---
I guess aggro dead until next Spring. Mage and Warrior festival.
---
Oh I'm not saying she isn't! I just don't typically play control decks, so it was a nice gift for me. :)
---
This is SO DAMN GOOD.
---
Everyone seems certain this will see play, so it's a shame but it looks like this card won't see play.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Yeah, cause the top wild decks run -1 greater heal -1 lightbomb, +1 archmage +psychic
---
Congrats! I just hit rank 4 (peak) with Midrange Hunter and Tempo Rogue. Been playing since January. Wish I started earlier I've been absolutely loving this game.
---
T
---
How do they keep affording these things?
---
If I have a 3 health minion attack a hero, will this trigger and kill the minion before the minion does damage?
---
Only the Warrior quest seams the least bit interesting to me. But honestly, it won't be played over bomb or control warrior. Why would you?
---
Whoa 137 golden legendaries and a tiny brain
---
Yes, it was big priest, but might be some budget deck or something as it had some unusual cards. Myself, I was playing some old Dog build with Mana Adicts that I found to be fun at that time
---
Was this done on location? Is that a real camel??
---
Blizzard, I hope you paid this man enough money to make Reno jealous.
---
Why is this genie only granting 2 wishes?
---
Lemme grab my code I’ll DM you.
---
No. The mage will take the damage and then the secret will trigger.
---
What's funny is, I've NEVER liked a game anything like this (I steer clear of card games) yet before, I've watched matches without knowing what was going on before and it was entertaining. 
---
I almost don't want to dive into deck strategy stuff. It's so fun right now that if I start doing things like builds and such, it might detract from the casualness of it. I really love building my own deck and going through trial and error.
---
And that’s pretty much the exact reason why nerving stuff isn’t something Blizz wants to do too often. There’s plenty of people that hate a deck, and plenty that love it.
---
They touch.

---
I think this card is going to be pretty good for a lot of decks. In control Shaman turn 7 is often a dead turn where you have no tempo plays. This can help bridge the gap into turn 8 when Shamans power cards start coming online (Hagatha, Fountain etc.)
---
Is the double usable?
---
Definitely take your time with the free solo content. IMO they're quite well done and do a good job at introducing the game and it's somewhat convoluted interactions. If you ever craft something like a strong legendary or epic, try and prioritize crafting neutrals, as they can be put in every deck, where as class cards can only be put in decks for that specific class. Do the tavern brawl every week, they're usually pretty good and get you a free pack. When looking at building a deck, aggro and midrange decks tend to be on the cheaper side to make, and somehow always find a spot in the meta. I would hold off on crafting anything though, as we're about to get a new expansion and things are going to be shaken up, so wait until the meta settles if you're going to craft anything. Last but not least, frequent this subreddit and join the discussion! Good luck!
---
Yeah you are right, maybe is just expansion fatigue, thx for the advise!
---
If you did go 'Taunt' then 'Taunt', would it count as 2 towards the Un Goro Taunt Warrior quest?
---
With tagwick the earliest you can get it is is turn 10 because tag +cultist+scheme is 9mana amd the next turn you can play 7 cultists or i guess at 9 if you add prep but that’s a big combo and if it doesn’t win you the game you pretty much lose
---
Al'Akir and Lyra are both pretty sweet golden legs. Lyra's especially nice bc all of the cards you get from her are golden.
---
I also dusted a few, including a golden Captain Greenskin like 4 years ago, back when pirates were considered a totally meme tribe with no competitive viability. Now I still don't have it and think about it whenever I try to build a pirate deck.
---
you'd think they would approve it cause they're all working together as one
---
It's definitely a bad idea. Go ahead.
---
Even the dead must obey Blizzard's Chinese Sharia Law.
---
Did the Rogue tried to cut Siamat's arm like Levi fucked up Beast Titan's arm in Attack on Titan?
---
&gt;1 - long games
---
All you had to say, for me at least.
---
This just doesn't compare to ~~tar creeper~~ Sludge Belcher lol. Compare this to ~~Sludge Belcher~~ Tar Creeper and just drop the ~~tar creeper~~ Sludge Creeper thought
---
I think it's flexibility can't be understated. It's going to be a must have in most mid-range decks.
---
This cards actually just insane. 7 Mana for a 6/6 with rush and windfury? Great!, 7 Mana for taunt and divine shield? Also great! It's super flexible in every midranged deck, what the hell
---
The trinity is now completed that each of the secret class will represent the similarly effect but different in power. Mage is strongest, Hunter is middle ground and Paladin weakest:
---
Mage has [[Flame Ward]]: 3 MANA secret: deals 3 DAMAGE to enemy MINIONS after being attacked 
---
Hunter has [[Explosive Trap]]: 2 MANA secret: deal 2 DAMAGE to enemy MINIONS and FACE when attacked.
---
Finally Paladin has [[Eye for an Eye]]: deal 1 DAMAGE to FACE when being attacked.
---
no u
---
I don’t recommend crafting cards early. Maybe an epic or two and some rates if you have the dust, but it’s best to wait at least a couple weeks to see how things start shaping up. The exception is if there is something you really want to try in the first week because you think it sounds fun. 
---
No one, and I mean absolutely no one, can completely predict the strength of every card in a new set and what the meta will look like. 
---
Even after a meta starts to solidify, changes can still happen. We just had nerfs,  buffs and a whole new legendary mech added this time. 
---
To be honest, it’s not really that wise to craft a lot of cards based off a streamer’s ratings video.
---
Don't do it. You will regret it.

Don't feel bad man. Try to estimate how much hours of playtime have you gotten during this entire 4 years and see how much you spent per hour, not how much you spent in your entire life.

It's a better way to see and compare this hobby to others.

---
I think they didn't want it to seem like a druid card
---
I feel like theres a very slight chance this doesn't happennon the level that Ziliax is, just because it cant pick Lifesteal as one of the options. Theres still a very good chance this is becomes a must craft card for any midrange/control strategy.
---
It's definitely viable, to answer your question.
---
Why do you hate it?
---
What is tar creepers "key component"?  The extra attack on enemy turn.  What's sludge belcher known for?  Summoning a smaller taunt that gets in the way.
---
It's got basically nothing to do with tar creeper aside from taunt and health.  
---
It's like saying mecharoo is a mix between possessed villager and upgradeable framebot.  There are VERY superficial comparisons to one, and a basic 1:1 with another.
---
Yay, another legendary that's in half the decks.
---
Yes, they started the nerf chain
---
It always gets killed off immediately and I don’t think that 5 damage for 6 mana is really that worth

---
It's not a mountain giant deck although some people were experimenting with that deck earlier in the season. Its 'Gifting Rogue', there's a post about it on CompHS at the moment and Dekkster did a video on it. It's just a tempo/curve deck that mills your opponent occasionally.
---
I think part of what makes this so good is gonna be the wind fury. Blizzard has always been very careful about printing good windfury cards, but this has pretty solid stats. It’s 3 stars above wind fury harpy and another keyword for just 1 more mana.
---
There's also the Wishes you get in the LoE when fighting a Djinn, all of which are pretty sweet.
---
It *is* clearly an End Game reference, I was just mentioning that it has also sprouted a hot new meme.
---
Obviously I don't believe it will be the solution to warrior, I even said it might take till rotation because of the state of current warrior.
---
The nice thing about it is that it just happens to be not dead against control like many other cards are while still being a primarily anti-aggro tool. Someone compared it to a frostnova and I think the comparison is pretty apt.

Could be true for a full collection. This person doesn't have a full golden collection though. They dont have full golden legendary either. There are 324~ legendaries in the game, so not quite half.
---
 It really depends on how long they have been playing, if they kept up with quests, played a bunch of arenas, and only crafted legendaries. Could be as low as a couple hundred or could be 5 grand.

You have to keep in mind Baku, genn, rag, and sylvannas were free crafts since the got hof, so you got your dust back. Snip snap was free and zalae you get free (gold to get the adventure) for beating heroic heist. I believe the last two expansions you got golden legendaries for free without having to pre order. Plus you got a golden one for preordering.
---
There are other things as well. If you never disenchanted cards until nerfs, you could get a ton of dust from disenchanted nerfed cards. All other nonlegendary hof cards gave a bunch of dust as well. It isn't likely, but very possible this person has been playing forever and grinded out these legendaries with minimal cash (only preorders).
---
I agree with you, but team5 can't figure out how to make that work with the Hearthstone engine, so they're changing it to be like OP describes.

This reminds me on an old South Park episode XD

To be more precise with the meaning (warning: spoilers)

&gt;!in Infinity War, Dr Strange checks a few hundred thousand possible outcomes, and finds they win in one of them. In Endgame, Stark asks Strange if that's the one, and Strange says telling him would change the result. Later, Strange does this symbol to Stark so he knows he should do what he thinks he should do.!&lt;

Quest? Play 5-8 cards that didn't start in your deck. Reward? 2 mana. Steal a card from your oppenents deck
---
I think it's overall. I played a deck that had 15 wins and the next win I got, it said my deck had 18 wins.
---
Not my boi silverback patriarch?
---
Well yeah, it's a fine card.
---
Nah, it just serves the role of generic epic music.

---
Not gonna be 10 mana. Probably 6-7 at worst.
---
Warlock has some pretty insane wild cards, i imagine the quest and the discard card will both be really strong in wild
---
Nice card. Opponent will need to play around it and it will be the kind of card that great players use well and weak players just try to get lucky with.
---
It could be a reference to the highlander mechanic where you should run only 1 copy of a card.
---
Anti-synergy with Waggle Pick. Good synergy with Necrium Blade and Necrium Vial... but Sap already costs less mana and doesn't require additional set-up.
---
Does shudderwock trigger the battlecry? I thought it just transforms, gets the innate keywords and end of turn effects? 
---
Same with bounce, it should lose its keywords once it's in your hand tbh.
---
Creepy show.
---
You know the quests were confirmed to be JUST hero powers right?
---
This card is better for a more proactive gameplan.
---
Works better with Khadgar
---
Posted for the Satire but.. I would argue that if there is nothing on the board for Siamat to rush into, Then Siamat will be held until there is.
---
Could actually be a fun keyword. Battelcy: gain Rush bubble.
---
Rush bubble: a divine shield that disappears at the end of your turn.
---
What about the tiger stripes says "not a cat person"?
---
In some rare cases you'd even just go for Divine shield taunt
---
Am i wrong or this card like reaaaaaly good?
---
Can It? I Think the biggest it can summon is a 9 mana minion. The hand limit is 10, that is including him.
---
No, this sumon a minion for each spell card you have with the cost of that spell
---
We know from experience these one turn power cards can work, but most only in druid which can ramp immensely, or in priest, which can mass rez after the inevitable board clear
---
They're obviously goat stripes!
---
I hope they don't do it again for the SoU adventure. Whoever came up with that idea needs to shut up.

It's a Chinese meme about rating an obviously powerful card as 1 star.
---
would be amazing, priest already looking good this expansion
---
It's "we", not "way", btw.
---
What’s the name of the card
---
I have a meme deck. Every single card with imp in it's name or art. Call it IMProvise
---
That’s because it looks at the cost of the spell you cast, same as Atiesh. But if you look at Geist, it destroys spells that originally costed 1, regardless of current cost. It’s possible that this is just an inconsistency, but I think it’s because it’s looking at the card in the hand, and not in play.
---
Whelp that’s a golden WHEEZY BOI.
---
The cards not revealed so far will be revealed tommorow on the Livestream.
---
Literally unplayable
---
I will slot this into my wild big spell mage day 1. Much better than dragoncaller Alanna for some mid-game OOMPH! Solid wincon for that deck imo.
---
2 taunt?!
---
This,this is genius
---
You misunderstand the card. You summon a minion for every spell with their costs equal to the respective spells.
---
Aggro Bomb Pirates = Bomb Ass Pirates
---
Pogo Mill Rouge = Pogo Go-Go
---
Mech Hunter = Rise of Mechs
---
Never gonna happen, due to its mana cost they basically can never print a 12 mana minion that isn't just a big stat stick with a mana cost modifier effect card text. A 12 mana minion is intrinsically unplayable
---
It summons a random minion for each spell in your hand, equal to the cost of each spell.
---
Pretty sure it means summon a minion of the same cost as a spell in your hand, do this for all spells in your hand.
---
N
---
I’m playing on a phone, so i’m not quite sure if it’s possible to share a code. But i’ll share my decklist in a bit
---
Put that on the bingo, boys!!
---
Cards from 1 class will have more synergy than cards from random classes so it would be a lot weaker
---
This seems like it will be underated by players the same way branching paths was initially. But once people see how flexible it is and how varied it can be, I strongly suspect this will be auto include in a lot of midramge to control decks. 
---
Combos include:
---
Windfury-rush. Remove two minions from the board.
---
Divine shield rush: deal 6 damage summon a 6 6 for 7 mana.
---
Rush-taunt: remove a minion, defend against potential charge minions like leeroy.
---
Divine shield: maximum defence to get you to your next turn.
---
I suspect rush will typically be involved but as this is basically 6 different cards, its almost going to be useful.
---
Looks pretty bad. Costing seems to be requiring a deck built around this card but it isn't strong enough to justify building a deck around it.
---
This summons multiple minions and doesnt require you to have a handsize this card is insane
---
Yeah idgi, if you want to represent the msog meta, keep kazakus, replace hancho with patches

It does reveal to your opponent that you have Brawl in hand, something to consider
---
Oh thanks but i dont speak ricefields
---
Pretty nice, 3/3 stats for 1 mana
---
Yes. Start a run and leave it alone at 2 losses. When the new set comes out, you will get a saviors pack and an arena ticket for free for a new run and another pack. 2 for the price of 1 basically.
---
Are you confused by it? No? Then it doesn't matter. Please spam this sub with something interesting.

I was thinking ranked and Arena. Thanks for the detailed answer!

Quest is you play 5 cards that didn't start in your deck and reward for 2 mana Add a random Wish to your hand from 4 available:
---
0 mana Discover a spell
---
0 mana Discover a minion
---
0 mana Discover a 4-cost card
---
0 mana Gain 2 more Wishes

Zoo Priest is starting to look filthy. If Reborn works the way I think it does and targeting the 1/1 token of a grandummy gives you a fresh 1/2 Reborn Grandmummy I think that deck has strong potential to be real.

So Mage is a board annihilator this expansion...
---
I'm telling you that the second to last card that will be revealed in 14 hours is the priest quest and the priest quest is about stealing cards from your opponent. That is why there is a togwaggle face on that card (you know, it likes to steal stuff)
---
Nice but 6 mana probably kills it outside of dedicated reborn decks.
---
OH RIGHT!  I remember this being discussed in the one for Warrior!  People memed about the card healing minions, and in a way I guess they were right?
---
Except the most successful aggro deck on the Ladder, Mech Hunter, is OK with having a bunch of goblin bombs activated. Other than that, indeed.
---
&gt;Thank you for replying! I'm not 100% sure what you mean: will they refund my arena run? or will it stay and i'll still get rewards when I lose the third time?

Probably better to just stick to Flamestrike, Blizxard and Power of Creation for big spells
---
“Am I sure glad he’s in there, and we’re out here...”

It happens after the attack, but you don't *need* to take damage. If you can prevent the damage the secret still triggers.

Where the fuck did this leap come from? You're telling me the difference between a 5/5 and Colossus isn't an extreme amount of variance that will decide games singlehandedly? How does that have anything to do with "all RNG from the game"? r/hearthstonecirclejerk is that way bud.
---
&gt;"I CAN BREAK THESE CUFFS!!"

&gt;"You cant break those cuffs."

It's the size of your Deck
---
And yet paladin got a quest for reborn cards while getting only one said card which isn't even that great. I really don't understand the way blizzard balance sometimes tbh, it's almost like they give horrible sets to some classes on purpose.
---
And Priest... we don't even talk about priest
---
They have Missile Launcher though..
---
I mean, it's kinda a bad argument for me to list ways to deal 1 damage, this card is okay and I think it will see play next rotation but if there's strong enough Reborn synergy or a deck for this card, it might see play over Applebaum.
---
Though, to be fair, this is one of the better anti-aggro tools out there and is potentially better than Safeguard, but at least that's better when looked at against Zilliax...
---
Still, this may still see play, and probably will at some point.
---
So it’s Reincarnate on a stick in a crossover episode?
---
Aww Man

I just realized I misspelled Harness and I missed a opportunity to make a Will Smith joke.

Exactly! If they get their high roll you giggle and appreciate they got it then play the next game and hope you pull yours off.

Was going to be my guess too. Though may be something even more interesting considering Mike is asking us to guess and that doesn't seem exciting enough

3 mana 0/3

Any idea what programme/software they use to make these incredible effects?

Not announced officially yet.
---
0-0 as well.
---
No, no there is not.
---
Sure. But that would rely on information that the player isn't able to see from the board-state, having instead to rely on memory (unless they implemented some jank way of hovering over the card to see how much it was played for).
---
Well with this card you could get resurrect started since you could make a trade with a minion, kill it to heal back to full, then play resurrect for a copy of it. Looks like a fun card all round.
---
China loves Wild and since Blizzard is cencoring card art for China it wouldn't surprise me that this expansion is more for Wild than it is for Standard.
---
I only play Wild so this expansion is great for me.

Spreading Plague was similar to Unleash but not the same too.

May I ask how much you had to spend to get to that point?

A character based on Hitler is, of course, not Hitler. There's nothing wrong with inspiration. But if Hitler, the actual person, was just chilling in Uldum without the slightest hint that he did not belong there, wouldn't you raise an eyebrow?

Harrison Jones is an explorer like the League, it's not out of place for an explorer to be visiting Uldum.

Have you played other heroic adventures? Why are you surprised?

This is a game ruining problem IMO.
---
The first weak of an expantion is by far the best part of hearthstone IMO.
---
Now its ruined, so much less of the crazy day1 brews, and trying to do it myself is olso runined by the imidiate higher level of decks on ladder day1.
---
It olso ecelirates net decking and the stabilazing of the meta, so it olso shortens the time after the first weak where their is still experimintation.
---
I hate this so much that its making me consider leaving hearthstone after playing since closed beta.

People hate high roll decks more than strong but consistent decks
---
Metafrank#1326 trading 80g quest on EU
---
maybe priest doesn't have the carper but i'd say amet is better for zoo. 7 health small minions are pretty good and removing that would be a nightmare for any control deck. And zoo is never trading up with your 7 health one drops.
---
It could have been: "Battlecry: gain your choice of 1,2,3, or 4 then choose again."
---
Sometimes I even consider Proud Defender better than Rotten Appelbaum
---
This is the perfect card for Plot Twist Warlock, along the new boardclear I think it´s a viable deck now :)
---
&gt; , "add cards to your hand that didnt start in your deck" can be the priest quest, this would make seance and spirit work for the quest.
---
And banana buffon and infested goblin, but it's ver y unlikely that's the wording on the quest.
---
The way I see it is that players, including myself, are sensitive to non-interactable burn from hand, and aluneth grants you that most of the time. 
---
Genn and Baku are mainly board decks with some burn in odd shaman which makes it powerfull.
---
That's because it destroys people who don't have a proper gameplan. Depending on your deck you have to either overrun or survive against and outvalue big priest. A lot of ppl, especially on lower ranks, just play horrible and aren't pushing for lethal with their aggro deck and aren't using their removal efficiently with their combo/control deck.
---
This paired with the fact that BP is relatively easy to play and you have a deck that is insane on lower ranks, plus it usually ends games with huge boards which just makes it seem op, especially for bad players.
---
It's a good thing Uldum isn't a purely Egyptian or Arabian fantasy then and instead it's own thing that simply borrows elements from those cultures as well as it's own warcraft elements to create its setting.
---
Yeah, I know...
---
I was just saying that they can ping it down, it's not a great counter
---
But in those you could build your own counter deck.
---
Here you need to hope for goor cards and goor rng the whole run - in old adventures you just reset and try it anew with the same deck.
---
leeroy + 1 mana reborn spell + this 3/3 is 18 damage I think =D
---
Ok, but I don't want to play constructed at all, I want to play arena and these rewards give me 260 gold + 3 useless things for that.
---
Not that I struggle with affording arena runs, but it feels really bad to get cards from your arena rewards in place of gold imo.
---
FYI song at the end is [Anduin's Theme]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oePQ8OnAWo) from Legion.
---
Nah the quests dead. Worst quest out of all 18 most likely, even though we ain't seen a few yet
---
...well now I have to craft Siamat
---
It saw a tons of Arena play.
---
Which does what for the combo?
---
Witchwood Grizzly, when rezzed, gives you a guy with lots of health that threatens to kill the opponent if he doesn't remove it. That's worth a lot -- it's the bear or the 2/14 that let you get lethal out of a hat.
---
Might replace a [[Convincing Infiltrator]] with this, though.

5/2/6 | Taunt Deathrattle: Destroy a random enemy minion.  
---
Sure, whatever
---
I think as it has rush it is never slow if needed. It doesn't get you ahead too much but its a very good control card to get back onto board.
---
WINDS, PLACE MY SUGGESTION UNDER ADVISEMENT!
---
Reny#11446 NA trading 80g
---
No, sometimes you need taunt/divine shield for a non-deathrattle tirion fordring.
---
I can understand that but personally it’s not like a consistent deck can’t high roll too, nothing is worse than facing an aggro decks that curves perfectly and has you dead by turn 5 or a control deck that has a perfect answer every turn
---
It’s not even like when priest highroll it’s unwinnable, personally CC mage in standard is probably just  as powerful if not more so than big priest
---
They got rid of mind blast so that you could just use this on a Reborn Leeroy instead.
---
1 less mana, 3 more attack, 1 more health.
---
Taunt was pointless in Al'Akir almost all of the time, so Siamat has only 1 less word than Al'Akir and Rush instead of charge.
---
So yeah, Siamat is clearly the Chad of these two.
---
Isn’t there that other deathrattle card that makes them cost 3 less? If you could combo both you get your deathrattle our for 3 less along with 1 proc.
---
How does silence affect minion health when removing a debuff? For example, say I have a 4/5 [[Ancient Watcher]] that has taken 2 damage to 4/3. My opponent plays [[Shrink Ray]], making it 1/1. When I [[Silence]] the Ancient Watcher, will its stats be 4/1, 4/3, or 4/5?
---
Listen up, ok? Shudderwock
---
Worst expansion in the history of the game. “Reborn” is such a lazy cop out and a sad sign that the developers have no creative ideas left. New legendaries and most of the cards revealed are just lame. This will be the end of my long run with this game, and the new expansion is the first I will not buy. Fortunately I’ve been more interested in the auto chess/battler genre lately. The creativity in Hearthstone is dead.
---
Wow priest got a really strong card. Zoo priest with a reborn theme is starting to look really good.

It was tier 2 in MSG iirc. I want to say it was around kft or knc when decks got nerfed twice but dragon priest was still only tier 2. I think control dragon priest was briefly tier 1 some time last year and then wall priest became one of the best decks.
---
Unpopular
---
Not a good reveal, features nerfed Jaina. 1 star out of 5
---
This will probably be played in the new quest Paladin, but it seems that it might be too expensive to actually use in any other decks.
---
BRM was the first iteration of dragon priest. It was very inconsistent (the dragon pool was nowhere near enough) and and TGT improved it a bit, but it was never tier 1, not when secret pally, combo druid and aggro shaman were around.
---
Unless the last card is a common "Activate all the deathrattles on your board" card, I'm going to maintain my position that it's too late for any real synergies within the class in this expansion.
---
&gt; Playing two classes all the time sounds so horribly boring
---
I hope you can recognize that this is opinion
---
Even if it's polluted it's still crazy value if you summon an average 10 drop in addition to King Pharos
---
The Priest Reborn cards allow who some really interesting interactions. Let see how it'll play out. It's definitely a lot better than forced trigger effects such as Overkill or recycled crap like Twinspell.
---
Absolutely busted in arena, not looking forward to queuing into the guy who drafts 5 of these.
---
Ah yes, a fine addition to my “Deathrattle Priest” in Wild
---
Destroying the Skull was pretty cool, especially when they played their Doomguard next turn and you know they would have had lethal.  
---
But killing the Twig at the exact right time was pretty fun too (though really rare because it wasn't that popular).  
---
I once oozed one T9 that was on its last durability before the big combo the following turn. That was a fun ragequit.
---
Witness the power of PURE WATER!!
---
Bordspace makes this a 31dmg combo. 6 leeroys+ 1 elekk, however if the opponent has a taunt minion you have the ability to clear.
---
Taunt and Heal, twice, that's double/double cheat!
---
&gt; Brokeback Mountain 
---
BlackRock Mountain? I am missing the joke..what is it?
---
Secret agent was msg and dragon priest was tier 2 then .Iirc in loe priest only really had control which was like tier 2. I'm tempted to say dragon priest was okay in tgt but bad in brm but I didnt play at that time so I'm likely wrong
---
It was solidly competitive, but I don’t think “tier 1” is accurate by any reasonable measure.
---
Cleanses silence as well.
---
stealing your enemies deck is not enough?! - maybe this is a quest designed for Wild?
---
As someone whos crafted all dks/hero cards golden i respect this.
---
yeah I just checked it. It got better after the nerf so I kinda forgot.

Assuming you're loaded or play a ton and can consistently have the relevant cards to produce good decks for multiple different classes.

A shame that it isn’t a 3/5 because if it was, it would actually be pretty alright. As a 3/4 I’m not so sure
---
Why pay an experienced copy editor, when Blizzard can just comb this subreddit and have us do the copy edit work for free?
---
Lol wtf is wrong with me i thought he had 5
---
That doesn't mean the class was shit when it didn't
---
Never buy on the phone, just use us shop on pc browser and pay 80$.
---
Of course changing the game is a valid critique.
---
A lot of the new mechanics we've gotten in the game is because they literally changed the game.
---
What fraction of reborn cards are class cards other than rogue? If this activates vendetta or underbelly fence, then it doesn't matter if the actual card generated is mediocre.
---
What, you mean Spiteful C'thun Druid isn't warping the wild meta? /s
---
Buy pre order on the NA shop, you'll pay in $. That's what I'm doing since I'm european and euro is stronger than dollar, save a few bucks.
---
Im Danish and immediately thought “damn that’s like $105 if the exchange rate is still close to what it was last time I went”. What a ripoff!
---
Priest has had tier 2 decks a lot of the time
---
Good lord he thicc
---
so, is (silence)priest going to be the meta? [[Mass Dispel]] can easily deal with this reborn mechanic(as its done with deathrattles)
---
Al'akir can go face. Check mate.
---
Yeah that's why I made sure to say "sounds" instead of "is".
---
Ghostlyboo#2432 NA want to trade 80g quest, ill show but you will have to go first
---
It can curve into a buffed Underbelly Fence on turn 2.

4/-/- | Silence all enemy minions. Draw a card.  
---
Good card.
---
Fits perfectly in a tempo pirate deck.
---
Good redundancy in a deathrattle deck with the mech that releases a poison rush minion, but still highlights the importance of drawing the deathrattle activating weapon by turn 3. If there isn't a new card that helps activate deathrattles early, that deck might continue to run into problems.
---
Lol common mistake dw
---
If you haven't seen it yet, it's 3 damage to all enemy minions when your hero is attacked.
---
What fraction of reborn cards are non-rogue class cards? If my gameplan is to activate vendetta and underbelly fence to survive the early game, I'm not sure I want to be rolling dice to do it. Then again, if my *other* options for surviving the early game are what rogue has right now... yeah gimme the 1/2.
---
Undertaker priest was by far the best deck in Naxx
---
I would love to see actual stats on this.
---
Yeah, sure, _that soooooo easy_.
---
You just need to draw Thekal. How difficult can it be?
---
Most of what I ran was a Jade Thief. 
---
Hallucinate, Swashburglar, Academic, and Tess and Valeera DK with the Jade Package. 
---
The jades provided a pretty good backbone for a curve. Sometimes you'd just get the nut draw and beat the board, but the majority of the fun comes from discovering cards from the other class.  
---
The Cutlass was ok, but you wind up pulling cards out from one win-con to support the weapon. Cutlass feels broken when it's not countered, it's a waste of mana and resources when destroyed.

This one is tech heavy (mojo, spell) but I've swapped in other cards like the 4/3 pirate to success.

Shirvallah, Ziliax, that 1/2 dude that double your healing... I feel like reliable healing isnpossible with paladin too.

Ok now give us an understated 12 drop :)

Control priest was also tier 1 in pre nerf witchwood, just because it was a strong counter to odd/even paly
---
You realised you're gay in 5th grade?
---
What's the new mage secret called?
---
CA is one of like 5 states that isn’t charged taxes. Most states have a tax added to the price.
---
This is really original and powerful compared to alot of the speculated mind vision-esque quest.
---
name 3 more
---
Damn
---
I don’t know where people saw this, but when others asked this question the answer people gave was that the developers said they can’t stack. They can only get Reborn once per minion. Like how double Taunt doesn’t do anything. Again, that’s unconfirmed from me but it’s whats beig said
---
Big Priest won't run this because it only struggles in the very early game, and losing a card in mulligan is too much of an issue.
---
Price in Coins is exactly the same as in USD - 7900 Coins for the bigger bundle (and 100 Coins = $1). But you can always buy Coins cheaper - usually at least 15% off. Plus sometimes you get Coin back deals, where you get let's say another 15% of Coins back after purchase (but those don't happen very often and usually have a short window).
---
The only bad thing is that updating HS on Amazon store is not a great experience, sometimes the updates are late, other times I can't install them even though they're already up etc. Of course, I could switch back to Play Store after pre-ordering but since I'm doing it regularly I really don't feel like reinstalling it all the time.
---
Oh, and I'm not even from the US, so that's not an issue either (although it's probably not 100% legal because I had to put a random US address lol).
---
This is where radiance comes in
---
League fucked now
---
It doesn’t stack. Functions like divine shield. Can’t double up.
---
People need to stop thinking this way cause if all effects fit only in the classes that they feel most appropriate and that could use them better, classes would feel really one dimensional and the effects would feel redundant and overplayed.
---
Some tempo versions of Dragon Priest circled around when Drakonid Op was in Standard. Spiteful Summoner Priest was also a decent deck in Kobolds (though anything that ran Pirates, Scalebane, Bonemare, and Corridor Creeper was good).
---
It’s not very consistent, even hitting 8 health healed for zandalari Templar is hard if you don’t hit Thekal
---
Basically, don't preorder. Not until they lower the price anyways.
---
HOLY FUCK TEMPO QUEST PRIEST TIER 1 CONFIRMED
---
Academic espionage rogue. 10 class cards that cost 1 mana each. Fuck that bullshit. Only good part about it is it is not a viable deck.
---
It's interesting to think the deck that wants to play this, one that's a sort of midrange Priest deck, might want to play Pyromancer-circle combos.
---
Source?
---
Yes, as long as you are doing the healing, it doesn't matter what it heals.
---
You didn't even mention anything about pocket galaxy lol
---
Maybe. I’m thinking of current aggro decks and I don’t see a fit, but if new aggro decks start popping up yeah I could see this fitting in somewhere.
---
Wow your unessacarily agressive here. 
---
I don't think you read my first comment and now your coming out swinging. Ooze was thought to be a required card when all weapons were annouced. Turns out, after the reveals people changed their mind. Thats my point. 
---
You can try and argue all you like. But only harrison saw a small up in play rate. Nothing compared to oozing pirate warrior weapons
---
I just don't want a neutral legendary that's only a lamp.
---
I don't think it's that easy to get a lot out of healing minions, especially not just yours. At that point you're probably already winning the board too.
---
I mean, there are a few ways. You can abuse your opponent going wide with Pyromancer + Circles, you can also get a few points out of Injured Blademasters and Divine Hymns. 
---
There is no Shadow Visions anymore though so those combos are way less reliable, if you don't draw 2 AoE heals in your top 10 or something like that you can sit on that Quest for a looong time with just Hero Powers.
---
Your opponent can also interact how much you can heal things by keeping the board clean and potentially skipping damage. That's not that bad though
---
Doesn't seem *as* hard to complete as I initially thought but I still think it takes ages to complete.
---
It's a love hate relationship with Nozdormu. I love it when he's on the board when I am on the PC or a laptop since I like to think and play fast with my games. I really hate it when he drops while I'm playing on mobile. At least give us the option to remove some animations when playing on mobile T\_T.
---
well yeah but playing reborn sounds like it fits priest better although it's probably easier for them too.
---
Meanwhile priest can cast circle of healing and heal all minions.
---
I’m guessing either one hour after tomorrows reveal stream starts, or one hour after it ends. I think it was an one hour wait with the RoS dump.
---
they really want tempo / midrange priest to be a thing , ok ...
---
I've seen complaints about some additional sales tax on top of the coins - is there?
---
I'm actually considering preordering so I might be tempted to buy it trough amazon instead of us blizz store.
---
Actually wild is more F2p friendly, and it has a very diverse meta, especially in lower ranks. I think many people who say it is not diverse don't play wild. Big priest receives alot of hate but I barely see them.
---
   Due to the availability of very good commons and rares a lot of decks are viable. (even budget control) where in standard you would always need some legendary. 
---
  The meta I see alot of different denks between Rank 5 - legend. Rank 1 maybe is the most boring but in legend it is diverse again. When I play standard I do feel I only see a couple of decks and that's it..... then the meta switches and again only a couple of decks..
---
  I would like to advise that you try wild, it is more fun than people think and more f2p friendly. However that's my opinion. I see alot of people hating wild and in that case go ahead dust everything, if you never will play it then it is safe to dust..
---
No. Reveal streams allow players to become familiar with cards before release. Trying to memorize 134 cards on day 1 would be too taxing. 
---
Also not every deck gets solved quickly. Look at cyclone mage. Additionally buff &amp; nerfs can't really be predicted making early speculation less meaningful in the long term.
---
For casual players having a big collection of Cards with every class is nor eazy, i dust everything But rogue, mage and warrior in Those 3 classes i have every card though. Even a full Golden Mill rogue
---
You don't have to play this quest on turn 1. Missing a card in your opener hurts, but you can plop this down on turn 3 or 4 when you have something to heal.
---
With the new cards, it'll auto lose to Shaman instead. I don't think Warrior is an auto lose currently, it feels almost even with my list.
---
You're still a card down though. Even in Wild,  Murloc Shaman doesn't play quest (for those trying to actually win) because it lowers your card quality early game. In any Zoo deck, you need a board, fast. One less card for greedy value makes that worse.
---
I think this quest is more midrange or even Control.
---
New Priest spell. 1 mana heal a minion for 4 health and give it Taunt.
---
2 mana 3/6 ???
---
If you used this on a wisp (because you must be, since you said 2 mana and any non-zero-cost card you'd have to count its cost in your statement), you'd end up with a 4/4 for 2 mana.
---
I live in Tennessee. I can confirm that I've had to pay taxes each time I've purchased card packs through my phone.
---
People were thinking the same about Lyra and Pyros

---
Was that the dungeon with the fucking crocodiles that would always kill people
---
IT DID?
---
People see these cards and think of the perfect moments, healing a double 7 minion board with Circle. In reality you're probably healing your (or their) face for a few turns with your Hero Power, then losing horribly.
---
flash of light, high priest thekal, lightforged blessing
---
I wouldn't call it new. It's very similar to Cubelock shenanigans. But instead of having no power moves until turn 6, it starts snowballing with an 8/8 on turn 4.
---
Wait this is so strong though, especially if the entire meta is gonna be bomb warrior still.
---
Tier 2 deck that warps the entire ladder around it.
---
I want to see a neutral cars that is playable in wild and cheap stats-wise (i.e. broken - like a 3 mana 4/6) that summons multiple garbage minions for opponent.
---
This archetype needs to die. Not get buffed every expansion.
---
I set the account up A LONG time ago, but IIRC you need to pick an US address from the state that has no sale tax on digital goods or something. I'm not really an expert, but you should be able to find some guide online.
---
Why did the bane of doom cost 2 Mana?
---
If you as a Big Priest get to a point where you have stabilized the board and heal up from Greater Healing Potions you've won the game, you have enough value to beat everything. This will never do anything unless you're playing a mirror match.
---
&gt; you don't need better lategame in Big Priest, especially not at the cost of giving up a card in your opening hand when the early game is your only concern.
---
Wild deathrattle quest.
---
Shoutouts to whoever made the prediction about Lazul working for the Old Gods, it's very likely she's the one depicted on the card's artwork
---
I guess the third expansion is indeed going to be about us fighting back against them, while the League of EVIL and LEague of Explorers unite against a stronger force
---
Lightforged Blessing, Flash of light, Truesilver, Nozari (in an extreme example).
---
My faith in the light is restored
---
They can just not play it on 1 but i do agree that losing 1 mulligan is already a pretty tough penalty. I do think priest has a ton of good t2 plays now that it may be able to get away with It (especially considering how powerful the payoff is) so maybe The quest is pretty balanced after all
---
WoW had (has?) a Plants vs Zombies mini game near the undead start zone.
---

Oh, absolutely. Classic is an albatross around their neck, and they decide to shoot it, which only weighs it down with more lead.

---
My casual ultra-greedy Quest Thief Talanji will turn into a double Quest Thief Talanji and make the worse minions, late game minions powerhouses (and my enemy's  minions also)!!!
---
I FORGOT ABOUT EXTRA ARMS! Oh god! :D
---
Cause your using divine spirit inner fire. But the deck is worse against all others. 
---
Plauge of murlocs does pose a significant threat though. I worry about it. But then again I could get lucky and get old murk eye and war cheif and just go face lol
---
I’m actually kind of happy the prices are so high; if it was under $50 I’d probably buy it but at $100 I can’t bring myself to do it.
---
you dont need a full on heal deck for this to work. I play deathrattle pally with the mechanical whelp and the robo egg with secrets with zileax and a copy of lifesteal twinspell. Plenty of times i slap a heal one one of my 7/7 or 8/8s.
---
In Wild, Reno fulfills the quest by himself
---
One good Cleric/Pyro/Circle turn could do that on its own. If you opponent doesn't have enough minions in play to make this true, then they are also not pressuring you and so you can afford to wait a few more turns.
---
True silver, flash of light, lay on hands, Guardian of kings, lifedrinker.... There are plenty of cards
---
\+ pally can turn his health into armor with Thekal and Crystaliser.
---
Truesilver, 2 mana heal and draw, 8 mana heal and draw spell.. Also new cards like the 2 mana 2/3 or any lifesteal minion.. I am not saying it will be easy or efficient..just naming the options
---
Yes
---
That doesn't work because you have to damage them first and doing damage isn't part of Priest's class identity.
---
Hey mate, stop reposting your whine thread. Thanks.
---
Many decks can shit on priest
---
You don't really need three more but flash of light, potion vendor, vicious scalehind (especially combined with call to adventure), truesilver champion, lay of hands, Nozari...
---
I bet this quest was made only to justify that new chicken shit priest classic card
---
Can have 2 in your deck. Include one or two other healing cards for consistency. Whamokablamo quest finished by turn 6. Enjoy +3/+3 on your neutral taunts until the end of time.
---
10/10 flavour text
---
STAR PLATINUM
---
&gt; That's where you are wrong. Fifteen health
---
If Druid can do it when they want to, Priest certainly can.
---
IT IS NOW
---
If I use circle of healing with a soul priest on board (healing does damage), does that still count as healing?
---
I hope they don't dump the format entirely. 
---
I would still like to see it as a format that they bring back from time to time for one-off events.
---
I just think Specialist (as they designed it) was bad for a weekly league. It seemed to encourage repetitive matchups.
---
Patzer#11703 EU - 80g trade
---
That was tried and quickly failed. Control Warlock didn’t have enough value or healing in Un’Goro to compete.
---
I think they were saying it makes it heal 10 health instead of 5. not that it heals damage to the minion.
---
Mill rogue, treachery warlock, darkest hour warlock, deathrattle hunter  are all fun and decently strong however if you are trying to climb just play odd paladin or big priest because they are really good and they kind of just play themselves.
---
I mean it is in Blizzards interest to generate hype for the new expansion and what better way to draw people towards your game than having someone who quit hearthstone reveal a card and hype his fanbase up for the new expansion? I'm not sure about Twitch and Riot putting him on a pedestal either though
---
A wild shot here. Legendary neutral spell
---
Okay. I saw that on an old list. It was missing from the update one, but there were a few others too.
---
I was hoping deck shielding meant the lists weren’t published to everyone that way people could be surprised by tech inclusions, like they do at physical card tournaments, there’s no real “rogue” deck concept with the way the rules are on both specialist and conquest.
---
yah basically.  Take your Chillwind Yeti, trade it into your opponent's 3/3 to kill it. You use Obelisk's Eye and for 2 mana, now you have a 7/8!  
---
It's super effective
---
Perhaps if you used \[\[treachery\]\] on *your* minion you destroy it too?  
---
...nope. just bliz consistency.
---
I think you are not considering the death rattle they are talking about that heals your opponent when it dies.
---
*laughing in healing potion*
---
See, I appreciate what you just wrote because it's tempered and offers legitimate ideas.
---
Whereas the rest of this sub thinks this card will somehow put priest back on the map and blasts anyone who thinks otherwise.
---
Previous quests flopped for a reason, and Dr Boom destroys all board centric strategies other than Mech Hunter.  So how exactly is this supposed to change things, with the crappy tools that priest has in their arsenal?  It's set up to fail day one.
---
A new acquisition.

3/-/- | Choose a friendly minion and give it to your opponent.  
---
Yeah.. PvZ2 actually added a bunch of new stuff to the game too, why did they have to make it so greedy.. There's a 3rd game coming, maybe when that flops we'll get another game like the first.
---
It's not the balance that was the problem. It's the class identities that killed sideboarding.

Once you say Class X can't do this and Class Y can't handle that, you have to print powerful tech cards or some classes straight up can't handle the field.

silvermoon guardian with heal 6 and +1 hp (and +2 mana). It's still worse than antique healbot by a lot.

Mercenary 14 is the same thing as 280, only difference being that 14 rules EU brawl and 280 US brawl

You answered your own question
---
I think he means the 4 drop works well with the 3 drop
---
Give kudos where they're earned and criticisms when earned. You're right with number 2, but they also did something incredibly stupid by even trying the Specialist format. It was so ridiculously unpopular with both players and spectators from the get go. So horribly executed. I wish they would have listened to the players before releasing specialist instead of just releasing it anyways. They ignored a lot of feedback to try it out. Sometimes trying new things isn't always a commendable when it's a bad idea from the start. You could make the argument "you never know until you try", but you'd never apply that logic to everything b/c it only applies in VERY specific scenarios. The Hearthstone competitive scene is just not one of them.

---
Is Doggo "The Dog" doggerson going to regret his withdrawal now? I hope he was informed of this change before he made his choice.
---
I dont think think this is better than Shadowreaper Andiun in Wild but i will definitely try a Double-Quest-Reno Priest. Amara should be able to complete the quest right and if not there is Reno.
---
It's already fun, it just doesn't outvalue Warriors or Shamans or Mech Paladins so why bother?
---
With all the reborn cards I would say it’s quite easy. But I have a feeling we have better decks this expansion.
---
Ah, I see your point
---
Of course, because the majority is always right despite the data saying directly the opposite. If you have a problem with a deck in hearthstone, you must play around it in order to solve it, if you keep the mentality of "I'm gonna to play ladder with whatever deck I want and if I don't win I'm gonna make a rant about it" you will spin around madness stucked at rank 10.
---
most big priests and quest mages are around 8~5 and 3~legend. People play them to break through rank floors so you can often farm them with something like token druid. 10-15 is mostly budget versions of odd paladin, odd rogue, even shaman and mech hunter.
---
Blizzard is really good at "revenge balance". Like how they keep bringing back Silence Priest as an archetype. Maybe someday they'll find a way to make it good.
---
This is crazy good because Dinomancy only worked with Beasts, this hero power works with *any* minion you desire
---
&gt;As a side note, how does this interact with Auchenai? If you heal a minion at 3 health, does it kill it or does it just give it +3 attack?
---
It will deal 3 damage and give the buff, since Auchenai makes all your healing effects inflict damage instead
---
if it was in standard today, it would definitely be used on magnatized mech enemies or edwin
---
TGT Dragon Priest and LoE Control Priest were Tier 2. They each had some good matchups, but they weren’t quite as good as other decks like Patron Warrior (either version), Combo Druid, Secret Paladin, or Zoolock.
---
Deathwing became the way he is due to corruption of the old gods.
---
I get that. I'm asking if it'll kill the minion before it gets the buff or if the buff will save it from dying.
---
You don't have to shield your strongest deck, you can shield the deck which defeats the strongest deck. Meaning you can make your opponent waste their shield because it gave you a free win. It provides mind games and lets things play out more interestingly.
---
Yeah I got a Egglock deck that just kills you Turn 4-5 if you do Nothing on turn 1 and 3
---
I really like the card game, actually. I thought it was a Hearthstone clone at first, but as I played I realized that their mechanics were different. It divides the game into five regions allowing for spatial significance that goes beyond Hearthstone's "adjacent minions" word usage, and then instead of having targeted minions your plants or zombies would instead automatically perform combat within their own zone (arguably similar to the Chess Game mode of Hearthstone, but without minion placement changing based on other minions' deaths.) Basically, the end result of this "flow chart combat" is that it's more strategic where Hearthstone is more tactical, and both play to their respective strengths nicely. It also goes a lot farther than Hearthstone with its use of tribes.
---
Having said that, you're right that the PvZ series has kind of overextended itself. In the first game the zombies were, well, zombies, and they were mostly finding creative ways to lay siege to you with whatever they could find lying around. Then in PvZ2 had time travel and the zombies were using things from their eras, and sure, that's nice. But nowadays it feels like the zombies can pretty much look like anything and try to hit you with whatever. A minor complaint, I feel, but definitely a change in the game's tone.
---
So it's basically a best of 3 with each winning deck being excluded in later matches. I like it. It removes the potential for a major swing b/c a player brings 1 bad deck like in previous formats where you had to win with each deck. This allows you to sort of bring some major counter decks without having to worry about it being a liability.
---
I've crafted one using the frame of chef Nomi priest in standard. It is not easy to get the balance between holding to draw and when you can pop the surrender. But I seemed interesting and this might give the deck more reach
---
/r/yourjokebutworse
---
Could this take the crown for MVhP -- Most Valuable (hero) Power? off the top of my head, the only other one that's close is taking Rag shots after completing Warrior Quest 1.0, and even that get foiled by just having a wide board
---
Anybody else think this will be run in literally every single priest deck in this next expansion? Maybe not Aggro priest, if that turns into a thing, but it's an upgrade to your hero power without a downside, and you don't have to build your deck around it.
---
TGT Dragon Priest was Tier 2. It stomped Tempo Mage and Face Hunter, but struggled against Handlock and Freeze Mage a lot.
---
Competitive viability and good design are two different things. As I said from the first comment, I'm not saying this will be a Tier 1 deck, but I think you're undervaluing both viability and design here for arbitrary reasons.
---
It’s honestly obscene and the quest condition isn’t even like terrible.
---
True, but he's still going to be front and center
---
What deck are you playing? I’ve been having difficulty climbing this month, stuck around rank 12-13
---
What trouble? You're already running healing cards, you're already using Circle to draw, Hymn to survive/draw and you're hero powering often enough anyways in your first few turns. Realistically you're not going to be using the hero power on a slew of minions anyways before the game is decided since you can only buff one a turn and running bad minions just to have targets for the Quest when you get there is just, well, bad.  It also transforms your draw engines into snowbally beefy threats later on and making your 0 mana 7/8s into 10/11s isn't the worst thing in the world. Nomi Priest is already a deck on the verge of playability and contains a synergistic package that works with the Quest so why not? I don't expect that it would be the best version of Quest Priest but hey, we don't know until people experiment.
---
This arena?
---
Surrender to Madness just isn’t really “for” playing early in a deck of low cost minions. Not that it’s really “good for” anything, but the concept works better as a late game play combined with stuff like Zihi.
---
everything that does 1 damage (i'm looking at you warrior) just got a lot better, for sure. from what's been revealed so far though, i don't really see reborn being meta defining.
---
It doesn't have to Deathwing specifically, does it? There's a few other evil dragons in the Warcraft lore
---
Better for druid.  The 1 card will awaken Lucentbark where Applebaum falls 1 heal short.
---
Looks like priest in back on the menu, boys.
---
Don't bring Standard into this. This is and will always be the problem with Wild. You squash one powerful, another will pop up.
---
Fuck, life steal works on this too doesnt it? Great quest.
---
i don't play much but tempo rogue still works for me
---
Also, they're having streamers play with the new cards like they did with RoS.
---
I was there for that legendary game.
---
HOW ⛏️ LONG ⛏️ CAN ⛏️ THIS ⛏️ GO ⛏️ ON
---
If you wretched reclaimer a reborn minion, you can heal the reborned minion that spawned off it, correct?
---
Ah ok, I’ve been playing midrange hunter and it’s sometimes hit or miss
---
Wasn't WOTOG, the expansion itself, only a what if scenario? Even if Lazul seemed like a sketchy character way back then
---
That's not the same deck.
---
Players running Ooze does not nullify a deck.  People ran Ooze all the damn time when Cubelock was T1, didn't stop anything.  One ooze will always be less consistent than a Warrior running 2 copies of 2 or 3 weapons.  
---
&gt; Well its not like preist has a hero power that restors health, has tens of spells that restore health to one or more targets, has minions that restore healrh including one that restores 5 and builds tempo.
---
And tell me which of these cards actually sees competitive play?  None.  Just because cards exist does not make them usable.  Circle of Healing is the only notable card, but it's effectiveness for quest completion is completely out of your control, and instead depends on your opponent's board state.  
---
How does Dr Boom have nothing to do with Priest?  It's the number one reason why Midrange decks are dead.  And guess what--this reward fits a Midrange Priest style.  Until Dr Boom gets nerfed, this deck will suck.
---
Literally only the first week. And even then it wasn't even close to the majority. 48 games a week. Week 1 had 12 warrior mirrors (most of which were in NA). Week 2: 0. Week 3: 5. Week 4: 5. Week 5: off (Las Vegas). Week 6: 3. Week 7: 6. Week 8: 3.
---
34 Warrior mirrors of 336 games.
---
It doesn't matter, these people will find fault with everything. It's basically their whole identity to be unhappy about stuff
---
I think there's a bot that autofills the decklist from the code - if not, they have that over at r/CompetitiveHS
---
Davis#11408 NA 80g trade with friend!
---
That's Incredible!
---
Sorry if I missed a post about it, but how would this work with N'zoth? Would playing one of these earlier and having it die twice (one reborn) resummon two 3/4s when N'zoth is played?
---
You answered it yourself in the last sentence.
---
OP I think 15 health is not hard at all and the hero power is crazy. Must have day 1 for me

4/6/3  
---
So as long as it’s a functioning deck, ranking decks seems useless since any of them can reach legend if you want it to
---
I'm looking at batterhead. Getting him to 6+ attack and he can pretty much full clear any board and hit face, plus he can be reloaded with 6 more hp every turn.
---
Wow for 3 whole expansions. I mean there are classes that dont see play for about a year is Hs  s 5.5 year history like priest, shaman, warrior, druid etc
---
Still no class deserves such destiny and i like warlock so i hope he sees play
---
He wasn't censoring himself be replaced the Z's with dollar signs on purpose
---
Your opponent isn’t just going to let your minions get damaged. It’s just like playing around Molten Giant or T1 Northshire.
---
This quest is better than what Preisd current has, but not that good overall imo.
---
Heal Priest? Maybe it will be time for Nightscale and Squashling, maybe time for the combo Brode himself spoke of
---
F
---
Lol so much better than Paladin's quest.
---
You might finish the quest off one Circle of Healing if done right
---
If you get it early against aggro, doesn't this mean large taunts that get effectively healed for 6 each turn?
---
Of matches played or stream time? I tuned in a couple of weeks and just instantly left when I saw a warrior mirror.
---
Play 2 secrets, reward summon 4 3/3 wolves /s
---
Shuffle x amount of cards in your deck
---
Reward:
---
Return a card to your hand. It costs 1 less
---
It hasn't been revealed yet but it's confirmed that it'll be released.
---
They're talking about the other card, the one that says your.  Am I missing something?
---
It was mocked horribly. There were definitely a lot of Blizzard fanboys similar to this thread going "OMG THIS IS THE BEST CHANGE." Basically praising them off any chance they get regardless if it's warranted. But the majority was definitely less than excited. 
---
Also Blizzard consults with their pro community on stuff like this. From the reports I saw, it was almost universally panned when discussed. Mostly for stifling creative deck building in different archetypes and forcing players to stick to a singular powerful archetype and making minimal changes to it without offering the a depth in counter-play. It wouldn't allow for the meta in the competitive scene to change all that much.
---
Lifesteal, windfury and divine shield aren't hunter keyword strengths.
---
You can do it with more than just Priest and Shaman. I think Rogue is the easiest, and Druid you can do it as well.
---
Unfortunately if bomb warrior is a thing, Elise Druid won't be able to do it.
---
Where does it say that it has anything to do with that lamp?
---
It's a best of 3 version of Conquest format, basically.
---
Cards like circle of healing make this bonkers.  add in things like Spirit Lash to do damage and you'll be set.
---
I don't think the variety will actually *be* different, but I certainly think it'll *feel* different, personally.
---
Basically: With every game, at least one player has to change their deck to an entirely different class. Which means that, from one game to the next within a single Bo3, you're guaranteed to have a different match up going on. Only time the matchup could be the same is going from one Bo3 to the other, but then you're dealing with different players, which might make its own difference.
---
So like, yeah, you're likely going to see the same 4 decks with minor variants played by each player, but at least similar match ups will be spaced out between each other due to the format, and I think that might count for a lot.
---
^(I mean, we'll likely all complain in Twitch Chat the instant a warrior mirror happens regardless, but still!)
---
quests are never related to general themes of the cards released
---
Prize money didn't go up so no.
---
They had to get rid of it. They were bleeding viewers like crazy.
---
It's not as bad as Hakkar. In standard I tried playing Spiteful around the end. Got Hakkar off spiteful, my opponent killed it. I played Archivist which cast the blood. Never again.
---
Need more than that. You need to actually draw the healing cards, 2 in 30 isn’t enough.
---
Not personally a fan. Also think people are really overrating the card.
---
This argument works when the deck filter options aren't absolute dogshit. I want to search like effects, and consistent card text is key.
---
This, but non-ironically. What a shitshow, the Wild meta.
---
49 cards not shown yet... I hate that they just dump them at the end.  They really should just release some of the common ones on Twitter or something.
---
You know there's Internet on planes now?  You just have to sign over your firstborn to get it.
---
(Seriously, it's like $16/day.)
---
The only 2 drops remotely strong enough to even compete for the 2 slot while keleseth was in totaation were Alpha, Juggler and Radiant. Keleseth basically didnt have s restriction.
---
Because the headline is different. I wish I could give you a better explanation than that
---
U want priest to get nerfed don't you?
---
Not if you can't target. Playing 6 or more Deathrattle minions as Hunter without putting yourself way behind is hard enough.
---
While I don’t like playing against big priest I would rather play against it rather than odd paladin. Both decks are fun to play against but I find aggro decks far more miserable than big decks.
---
Is it revenge if the archetype sucks though?
---
Is there supposed to be a /s at the end of that? TFT has brought them a ton of attention and focus; it's far from over.
---
I have no idea what you are talking about because I answered about Big priest and you decided to switch topics but ok.
---
Playing hearthstone you have 2 options, play casual (casual mode, Adventures, Arena, Tavern Brawl) or play Ranked (ladder), in one you bring your fun decks, in the other you bring the strongest decks despite if they are lame and boring, you play to climb and for privileges. 
---
In wild there are much more than 3 meta decks, Quest mage, tempo and mill rogue, odd paladin, murloc shaman, evenlock, and big priest (wich is a tier 2-3 deck but quite popular), in mostly of cards game the same mechanic exist, aggro/combo/control decks, one deck beats another. 
---
In standart you have Bomb/Control Warrior, CC mage, Murloc Shaman, Deathrattle and midrange hunter, and mech pal wich beats pretty easily the top meta warriors. You have been playing for 4 years? great, then you have realized that currently the game have more meta decks that years before where druid and hunters where the only deck out there. Again, if you see a deck being too popular, just play a counter, the most popular the deck, the easier it will be for you to climb ladder.
---
I don't have any idea who's purple but I guess is a professional streamer, how dare you to call him pathethic for understanding the game and playing with strongest deck out there? he's a streamer, he relies on viewers, as  any streamer he must charisma and talent, and talent can be measured on how frequent they win their games.
---
If you want to make a proper rant first of all don't say "THE MAJORITY SAYS", that's a stupid fundament, show us the data that says  what you are saying and then just there, we will began to discuss the theme seriously, maybe watchign the data you will learn some things in the proccess.
---
It also allows people that specialize in one deck to protect it. Thinking about certain players that are specialists with one deck, I could imagine banning a less powerful deck that I knew someone could play exceptionally well (thinking back, someone like Laughing with Freeze Mage or Zetalot with Priest). 
---
I think it will also have an effect on how line-ups are put together. Not being able to ban the strongest deck means you have to be prepared to beat it and it adds another layer to preparing a line-up. I have no idea if that's going to make for a better viewer experience, but it will be interesting to see how the players prepare.
---
The only time more classes would he brought if the meta was more polar and had a rock paper scissors feel. From a player perspective I'd rather there just be better decks.
---
Is there going to be a final reveal stream?
---
Yes it will, because any other priest deck is utter garbage at the moment
---
You could run  [bittertide Hydra] and [bomb squad] for self damage and [refreshment vendor] as well. Maybe this kind of deck is creature heavy with low amount of spell and high tempo with [happy ghoul]
---
I noticed Big Demons is starting to show up a bit in Americas, I'm playing it myself. I've been actively trying to combat mercenaries 280 most of the week.
---
You mean your first Golden 1 drop ;)
---
Laughs in divine hymn
---
Every tier 1-2 aggro deck in the Wild is capable of ending the game on turn 4-5.
---
Big Priest, Even Lock, Even Shaman, Secret Mage are all viable midrange decks that make huge swings around turn 4-5 to combat aggro, it's just the power level Wild is at.
---
All of the AI is server side, so you don't have to run it locally. That makes things run quicker and is way less demanding on your processor.
---
It's much better this way.
---
&gt; run pyro combo has lots of spells 
---
It previously did but doesn't have to now. Just put Northshire, Pyro, CoH and only the spells you require to survive. Northshire + Pyro can be good when you face aggro and want to get an edge, and skip it against control and get heals from other sources. I think this will be a very versatile deck, at least tier 2.
---
Or as I like to call it, “1600 dust”
---
I've got a similar deck, Iron and Steel 217 that does well. Double whirlwind, warpath, Dynomatic, Zilliax and Iron Juggernaut. Also has Garrosh DK and Dr Boom heroes. So far 5-0 vs Merc 280. PM me if you would like the deck.
---
I think the general theme of warrior is gaining armor and literally destroying minions.
---
I see that you haven't played a Smash game since Brawl, then. Online tournaments have had pretty regimented rulesets since Smash 4 (even if they were a little reductive, like For Glory)
---
Why are you showing a picture from Plague of Flames? Are you responding to somebody else? Because my comment was about why Darkest Hour is flawed, not Plague of Flames. Plague of Flames is as it should be, but Darkest Hour needlessly takes up space using "friendly" instead of "your" and unnecessarily using "random."
---
What SOU mean ?
---
Strong enough to be worth running for sure imo. I'm not sure what the deck is right now, but surely one will exist.
---
Hmm... 4 different classes... or 2 different classes??
---
Which one just on paper has a higher variety again???
---
2 &lt; 4
---
This is what tinyfred is referring to. Besides, how many classes actually saw play in specialist? 5? I bet it'll be the same number of classes represented, but now with variety in actual matches. Instead of always Mage vs Mage, it'll be Mage vs Mage, followed by something like Hunter vs Mage. In one match, we've already gotten more variety.
---
Saw a guy in the comments for the quest about using Surrender to Madness and throwing in a bunch of low cost minions. Unsure if it'll work, but it has me excited for sure. Even if that doesn't work out, there's a lot of potential in different zoo and midrange decks.
---
Easy to complete? You need to survive until it's complete, THEN survive until you can use it enough time that the payoff is worth it. How long do most games against priest last anyway? If it takes 10 turn for this to start being effective but you're dead by turn 8, what's the point?
---
3 more years of Discard!
---
I don't see why they don't allow you to bring one of each class. Class X might be trash tier but I may have a novel deck that specializes in the removal of a popular deck.
---
this better not be the epic slot
---
This is actually the best, because now you can have any legendary you want.
---
I pulled this a month ago and went straight away a dusted it then crafted Leeroy Jenkins. I needed some face time with my opponents.
---
Does overheal count? Like turn 2 heal enemy face when they're at 30?

---
Oh, I like a challenge! I'm quite surprised no one has mentioned this but in the video all allies are hurt but then get up to continue fighting.
---
So the lamp **restores health/fully heals all allies**. It already aligns with the adventure Wish card that heals your hero. Of course just a heal would be underwhelming for such a powerful lamp and we also see Anduin weilding it as a weapon so I'm pretty sure it has an effect to **destroy a minion(s)**
---
Just wait for the reveal, it'll be worse than anything here
---
Wild support means nothing unless they actually balance around it.  Format is trash
---
If you liked the music towards the end it's from the WoW Legion expansion soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylg9o5uqBKA it's pretty epic.
---
To be fair, if someone summons 37/37 in stats on turn 4 and you don’t have a way to deal with it the game was effectively ended on turn 4
---
Such a wholesome post, bless your soul
---
LMAO you really have no idea what you're talking about. first off THERE IS MORE TO ASIA THAN JUST CHINA. Secondly, do you have any idea how HUGE the Chinese market is to the entertainment industry?
---
Well we've just had new Rafaam in the previous expansion, so it's not likely.
---
"Restore 15 health". This is going to be almost impossible to achieve. "Restore" means overhealing doesn't count. So you are going to need your opponent to cooperate by damaging you - or by damaging your minions without killing them, or letting YOU damage your minions without killing them. 
---
This sounds good in theory but it's going to have the Lucentbark problem - inconsistent, not enough activators, and it's going to be far, far too easy to play around. This quest is going to be unplayable, unfortunately.
---
@Trolden
---
Is it possible to have two quests running at the same time?
---
It didn't used to be very relevant outside of first turn [[Mind Vision]] shenanigans, but soon it should be very possible to try that in Wild.
---
Tempo Storm lists are a joke but more to the point, a diverse meta doesn't mean one that changes completely every 4 months.  I'd keep going but it's pretty clear you don't want to have an intelligent conversation because it's just easier to be vaguely demeaning and pretend you're too above it to bring up any salient points.

1/-/- | Put a copy of a random card in your opponent's hand into your hand.  
---
It was bad early on and it differed a lot between regions. I skipped on a lot of NA matches, because those guys brought Warrior a lot compared to the other regions. At least, when I watched.
---
Lamp: 4 mana 0/3 Deathrattle: Swap Sides and gain Reborn, Battlecry: summon a 7/7 Genie which is controlled by whoever controls the lamp.
---
yea but why sell out and lose all integrity.
---
Seeing more different decks will be exciting, though I have to say that I didn't find specialist as boring as expected. It helped showcase how even "small" decisions and strategical adjustments could are so important.
---
This is so incredibly strong. New Zilliax.
---
The fuck?
---
"IT'S SELLING OUT IF THEY PANDER TO COUNTRIES THAT AREN'T MURICA"

Yeah, in wild this is insta completion with Reno, most of the time.

I mean pyromancer combos exist
---
C-can she come and play with my golden Gruul? He's just sitting in my collection feeling sad
---
That is true, and if that’s what you’re looking to do, maybe that game would be more up your ally
---
Hey priests back
---
Honestly the card game might've been one of the most interesting takes on a digital ccg that I've seen. Having asymmetrical gameplay as the basis of the entire game was really cool and they actually did a pretty good job balancing the 10/20 classes. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Shame it got ultra power creeped then abandoned because they didn't really advertise it/it wasn't profitable.
---
Hearthstone is an international game. They're not selling out by having more Eastern than Western reveals. It's just community involvement.
---
When you finally play 10/10 pyros and the triumphant music plays and you feel like a proud parent watching their kid at graduation
---
I think the lamp has to do with the quest for rogue since:
---
a) We know it's not the quest for Priest
---
b) It looks like rogue's quest will be revealed Wednesday
---
c) A lamp is like a treasure and King Togwaggle is all about Treasures
---
d) In the video the Priest thoughtstole it (probably from Valeera)
---
Judging by how it healed the characters in the video, maybe the Rogue quest has to do with healing (since Rogue doesn't have any right now?). Maybe, 'Whenever you play a card, heal by X amount?' or 'For the rest of the game your dagger has lifesteal'? Totally random guesses, but I'm pretty sure its the Rogue quest reward.
---
Dont worry, its not steal or anything, it just looks like you got heavily inspired by that desing.
---
[Its this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/6scjzv/survival_pack/), voted best custom hearthstone card in 2017, and even mike donais commented on it saying the card was inspiring. This expansion will bring a desing very similar to it with [Hunters pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cgcbxc/new_card_hunters_pack/).
---
This is great for you, as it makes it very easy to disenchant the card!
---
I opened a golden Jaraxxus some months ago and it is such a cool card, but unplayable in the current metas. So it would be the right thing to dust it, but I can't, as it feels so bad :P
---
Nice of you to make a guide for the community. Thank you!
---
That;s okay, only boy worth saving is George.
---
Poor sweet George :'(
---
That would be awesome :3!
---
Wow you really are an idiot aren't you? Stop talking.
---
it's just gross to see a company of sell out like this.
---
That was my first thought too.  After thinking that Priest players must be happy for that hero power.
---
Yeah, I think the prevalence of Control Warrior also really hurt it. Those mirrors are just unfun whatever the format.
---
The taunt is another "5 healing" and with something like paladin quest you are looking at 12 raw healing and the taunt
---
Welcome to capitalism, sunshine. It's a huge pile of shit.
---
Plot twist warlock will
---
It is. Any minion that you can stick on board will be a growing threat
---
How did they BM you? If it was through emotes, then you should know that you can squelch people by right-clicking their portrait.
---
Yeah man i've been fighting that boss for 3 hours now and if i don't go to the bathroom right now mom is gonna be sad later
---
Renouce lock was nuts !
---
You do not get to pick who lives.
---
Lol, I like your attitude, don't get me wrong.
---
But... let's be real. Warrior already has sooo much board clear. When boom is played they have rush. Good luck ever building a board to deal with 6/12 of stats XD
---
For sure control shaman will do well. Good deck. I think Shaman will be a very fun deck this expansion. Def one of my favourite classes.
---
If you break the meta with Shaman, let me know ;) share your list
---
Ah, I see. I understand the similarities, multiple effects warped into one, and the flavor is very similar.
---
....
---
I would like you to read that link.
---
Then compare it to what you said.
---
Then you can apologise.
---
The best bang for your buck is always the starter pack.
---
Maybe try spirit and bwonsamdi so can have as draw engine for late game? or just bwonsami?
---
Flesh fails, try crystal!

3/3/4 | At the end of your turn, give your C'Thun +1/+1 (wherever it is).  
---
I hear ya, but hopefully they're saving them all for the Bronze Dragonflight expansion.
---
**THE FEAST OF SOULS BEGINS NOW**
---
*COME, LITTLE ONES*
---
That's what I was thinking. The reward could be as simple as a Combo version of what Shaman got (double your Combo effects this turn), but I doubt they'd print something so similar in the same set.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cjd32x/is_this_really_the_year_of_the_dragon/
---
They've pretty much never played up the zodiac animals, but if that actually concerns you, they've printed more in this year than they have any of the others and we're only one set in.
---
But control warrior actually ran threats back then so mirror matches weren't always hour long grindfests.
---
This slots into any deck. It’s a 1-mana cycle.
---
No becouse when you reach rank 25 you will get pne pack of each standart expansion
---
No
---
Its pay to win but you pay with time, not money.
---
Literally give any pro with 1/4 of the total collection and a new player the entire set pro will beat them majority of the time when factoring rng.
---
cao ni ma
---
Yeah, they usually just gut them. I'm having trouble thinking of obvious examples right now, but purify was one of them.
---
No other HS tribe is on the zodiac calendar, what does that have to do with anything? And Mammoths and Ravens aren't tribal tags either.
---
Wild is more fun anyways.
---
Year of RAFAAM, THE SUPREME ARCHEOLOGIST!
---
I would love it but I think many many players would be very upset to have their cards stolen from hand. This is a disruption effect that I do not believe T5 have the guts to print outside of PvE
---
AYAYAYAYAAA Intensifies
---
I liked it until I realized I was going to see the same three decks for hours on end.  I tuned in the first three or four weeks though
---
You only needed one mirror for the match to reach multiple hours. 
---
Even if this was the minority of matches, it would be the one stuck on the broadcast.
---
I cant be the only one who laughed at the flavor text
---
They didn’t say nothin about Valeera tho!
---
Except the situation you're describing is literally just you getting high-rolled. He (apparently) ended up getting at least 4x useful 1-cost spells off of all his RNG and was able to use them all, not to mention the random Frost Bolt. The game would have gone slightly different had he instead hit, say, 1 Arcane Missiles, Book of Spectres, a Splitting Image, and Flamestrike. Or Meteor in there, or a Pyroblast, or any of the other 30-odd Mage spells that don't cost 0-1 mana. I'm not saying it doesn't suck to get highrolled (that's most people's main complaint about Big Priest), or that Quest Mage doesn't have a lot of highroll potential, but as someone who played a decent amount of the deck last week you also get some *shitty* Mana Cyclones sometimes that just clog your hand with nonsense. And that's not even counting what happens if your Sorcerer's Apprentices or Flamewakers are at the bottom of your deck and you find yourself gassing the hell out against aggro.
---
Oh right. How silly of me. Forgot about that totally broken quest. 
---
Right, get some schemes... and then hold them for 6 turns after getting them, sounds easy. I will be legend in no time ;p
---
Hey, that‘s pretty good. Free Legendary of your choice.
---
That's my point - CC is ok when its strong... but the games are decided once that mountain giant sticks to the board in the first few turns.
---
Theres the River Croc that draws you a card if you have a Quest!
---
95 wins?! Must be a good deck. Surprised we haven't heard of it yet.
---
Don’t act like you didn’t hear me you coward
---
Proffset#21477 80g quest eu, not going first
---
Hey, just thought I'd notify you one last time &lt;3
---
This is I think stupid OP with academic espionage
---
Why do you care who reveals a card?
---
It’s actually short for “The Fishing Tournament,” tuskarr jouster is the main legendary.
---
Nor would one a boogeymonster. Doesn't change it.
---
[[Earthquake]] is looking better and better
---
It works trust me ;pppp XD

I prefer the [Bob Ross](https://pics.onsizzle.com/mistakes-happ-positive-memes-we-miss-you-every-day-bob-ross-30981064.png) version.

7/-/- | Deal 5 damage to all minions, then deal 2 damage to all minions.  
---
Mammoths, ravens, and krakens fall under the Beast tag and have been printed before, often outside of their actual year.
---
Super broken Rogue quest idea:
---
Shuffle 15 cards into your deck.
---
Hero Power: Passive: When you play a card all copies of that card in your deck are played with random targets.

With the hand placement in the art, I can see why

Hey bud, Wild player here: I've played against three Big Priest decks this entire week. In fact, I've actually faced more *Combo* Priest decks in that time, as well as Odd Rogue, Even Shaman, Shudderwock Shaman, and Odd Paladin. It's almost like you don't actually know what the fuck you're talking about.
---
Polls are an incredibly low sample size.  122 and 130 respondents.
---
Its some weird mixture.  The daily quest system, while a good source of gold, encourages having multiple decks in order to complete those quests.  Sure, most you can complete with a round with your friends,  but say you're a player who loves playing priest, but keep getting druid quests and are capped at 3.  You either have to lose gold by not completing the quest/waiting for reset, or come up with a druid deck.  
---
The game has always had a pay to win element to it.  If you wanted to play anything but a aggressive deck in early Hearthstone, you had to have: Slyvannas, Ragnaros, and Cairne.  Tyrion was also a must if you played Paladin, Alex if mage.  There was just no way around it.  If you didn't have these cards, you just lost so much value late game.  I remember particular situations where I had 1-2 legendaries in my deck (spent $20 on cards) and was running up against people with the trifecta at rank 18.  With no dust for BGH and not wanting to destroy my own collection for a poor dust conversion weight, I just didn't stand a chance.  It just sucked the fun out of the game for me going from mostly players with their own decks to running into such huge power spikes.  Every expansion I'd come back and try to enjoy it, but I never could get back into it until I took a break in TGT (Freeze Mage and Wallet Warrior at its worst).
---
I don't see someone playing HS F2P casually (1-2 hours a week) and enjoying it.  There's such a huge initial hurtle to get over for forming your first viable deck.  Although I don't know how the new ranks 50-20 experience is now.
---
Oh, saw the ”kr” and thought of Swedish Kronor.
---
man, Reddit is seriously overrating this
---
Trump is awesome, but terrible at predicting cards (p=0.001).
---
I'm not saying Beasts can ONLY be printed in years named after beasts, but it'd be nice if we got at least one dragon per new expansion in their eponymous year. It's not looking like we're getting one this expansion at all.
---
Okay, none of those decks appeal to me either.
---
bUt wIlD iS sO mUcH fUn jUsT tRy iT
---
Can’t unsee that.
---
1 star. No deck that can use it; besides healing for 2 for 2 mana isn't how you kill opponents; to target a minion you need to have a minion first. If your game plan is killing with minions with +3/+3, then you don't put this card and a lot of healing spells in your 30 card deck.
---
Not really, they don't. They can present threats and stack enough damage to kill you in a turn or two. And priest really doesn't have strong board clears, so they can't do much about it.
---
I can see the resemblance,  except Ventura couldn't  do the kicks like Reno.
---
The average dust value of a pack is actually 100, so you'll be able to craft a bit more than that
---
Was thinking mage should be OP?
---
Yeah, I agree that it was an over the top reaction to say “Go through all that trouble” but I would rather play a more reliable card that won't clog my mulligan.
---
Yeah, I prefer this way, instead of requiring 2 legendary of a class in same expansion to make a archetype works
---
Not during League of Explorers. It had even less threats than before and games regularly ended in fatigue. Nowadays, there are at least some threats from Omega Assembly and Dr. Boom.
---
Its either Mech hunter or Mech warrior. That's about 90% of games.
---
California explicitly doesn't tax digital purchases. Probably because the tech giants are based there.
---
Lamp summons or puts Zinnar in your deck, and zinnar gives you wish cards at the end of your turn?
---
There are a lot of brick and mortar realtors who want Amazon to be forced to start collecting that tax saying it gives them an unfair advantage. It really is a screwy system.
---
But in the end Dr.Boom still won
---
Big true!
---
These comments are always so entertaining and exaggerated. You literally do not have to pay anything to play this game. It is a free game. If you pay money it is simply to get something faster. Saving up coins between xpacs gets you more packs than buying the preorders. Dust the cards you don’t need/duplicates and tada. You have enough shit to make atleast one top tier deck every xpac. For free. And you can play as much as you want. For free. 
---
People are so entitled today. You seeiously want more out of something ** are getting for free**.
---
She is usable in silence priest! yeehaw

F2P btw

Clincher#1499

NA
---
He's right though over the years theyve added so many cards that decide the game instantly based on rng, or draw rng if youre going there
---
I don’t see the issue here, this is beautiful.
---
*non-Tyrande people are triggered*
---
Maybe it wwas just me then I remember playing rag  syl and boom as top end.
---
So triggered

Captain Eudora is in Hearthstone.

Hour and 20 left. I'm so hyped

People really think that it means jackshit if you are f2p or not? Game is 5 years old and ppl still think it matters? Dear lord...
---
Yeah, before Elise, that was the case.
