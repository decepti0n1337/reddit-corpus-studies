Eh.  I dropped murloc paladin pretty fast myself.
---
In the Brawlsoleum I was able to get 6ish average wins with a deck I already had, tried a few runs of murloc paladin and went like...3-3 and 2-3.  Switched back to a more reliable deck.
---
Like...yeah, it can win sometimes?  But it also loses to itself sometimes.

I fail to understand the attempt of sarcasm, please elaborate

Mechathun has a deathrattle where if you have no cards in hand and deck you win when it dies. The skater bot on the left can fuse with the mechathun to let it attack a minion on board. The spell on the right will turn its attack and heath to 1.

Yeah basically there are two parts, piles of sand grant immune but any pile of sand being present still stops you from digging up Finley. Can see how that could be a little confusing.
---
gg dude, but you missed lethal about 4 times, and that highroll of a hero power has broken me as a person.  Luckily, I believe in karma and as such am looking forward to my reward for this event.  I wish you well in your future games, but my rage cannot be sated by man nor beast.

---
I see it now! Thanks
---
Double starting health, clear his board so he summons a bunch of imps. AI fucks up and you can slowly chip his health down, it's as fun as it sounds.
---
Okay my guess is this, each wing is one of their artifacts like renos gun and then the last is something huge to stop Dalaran.
---
Hold on, let's not be rash here. This might be the Finley you play *as*, not one of the Finleys you play. So he should have enough health to survive a couple high energy blasts to the face.
---
Yeah completed it was fun, had cards halfed then just put high minions out and he couldn‚Äôt deal with them.
---
No, that's not what it means.
---
You can get just the adventure (without the cardback and legendary) in a separate deal later, but only the bundle is available now.
---
Using Galvanizer would have tipped off the Mecha'thun deck and he would have killed OP much earlier.
---
...You don't have to buy both.
---
Yeah, we were indoctrinated during the game monetization class we took in third grade. No one likes the game, anyone who says otherwise is mind controlled by drones.
---
idiOt
---
Literally unplayable
---
Seems unnecessary...if you own a console you own a computer (hearthstone also doesn't require good specs).
---
The game requires like 5 apm and doesn't benefit at all from being on a console. Seems like work for no reward if I owned Blizzard.
---
Didn't you see the sign coming in? Please do not feed the Blizzard!
---
Nearly a year and the problem was still there,they just didn‚Äôt care!
---
It‚Äôs almost time for new iPad Pros (10th of September) and Hearthstone is still not updated for new resolutions!
---
Are they qualified?
---
My Don Han'Cho once buffed his own Shadow Reflection, which is also quite useless...

It really wasn't all that difficult, but it all comes down to picking the right buckets.

Well if even just talking about daily quest,it should sum up about 2k gold for 30days. Just do one quest per day and thats it.

this brawl si basically the preview of the upcomnig adventure so is it to be expected its limited

That's not bad manners.

I wish I took a screenshot now, but on the card collection screen when I scrolled over Finley, underneath the card it said "Created by Dinotamer Brann". Probably related to this.

he saw  a deathrattle minion, his priority is making sure said deathrattle doesnt go off.
---
This is why you don't BM kids
---
Horrible
---
Probably not that
---
Yep. Especially now that you have to pay for single player content *as well as* the expansion. It's a lot of money for not much variation.
---
I firmly believe in putting money where you spend your time, and supporting game devs, but things are starting to feel a bit greedy, and a bit stale.
---
Because they are helping you visualize it
---
Why should Blizzard care about your personal problems? They want to maximise profit not sort your life out.  
---
  
---
You have a gambling addiction? Stop playing Hearthstone and pay for rehab/a psychologist.
---
It'll revert two weeks after the nerf, and no, it's not worth it unless you actually want Boomsday packs for some other reason, or if you're only missing the two legendaries concerned. The probability of picking up exactly the nerfed cards is very low.
---
-welcome to the wild, poor Arthas.
---
-you are welcome.
---
It‚Äôs a sad state if this is what the maximum
---
creativity they can achieve in a digital card game.
---
He quit Hearthstone and opened a salt factory
---
Oof two weeks :((
---
But thanks man you've been great help!
---
I agree with everything but one part. Hearthstone had it's, essentially golden age in 2017. I think it'd be better to add 2016 to the comparisons.
---
Alex'ing in that final turn was the ultimate BM. You did a really good job of making him nervous earlier though.
---
These solo adventure brawls make me wonder why Blizzard doesn't allow you to complete quests in all the other solo content?
---
You mind controlled SAND???
---
Hearthstone, Classic but with all the QoL
---
I don't think it would be. It would reduce the differentiation of each of the classes and I don't think that's a good thing.
---
I'm all for more representation of strong women of color in games!

Mad scientist. 2 Mana draw a card from your deck and play it for free on a decently started neutral minion.

That's what I tell all my music students.  I'm like, "Dude, you can clearly play music- why don't you make something up on your instead of playing Twinkle Little Star?"  Then the kid usually cries because they're 5.
---
Oh wait, I don't do that because it's actually not a bad idea to copy what has been done before to hone your own skill.
---
I was talking about player/viewership wise.
---
What's the trick?
---
I wouldn't call it infinite, mostly of spells can break that combo since they don't trigger the lifesteal.
---
It does hurt replayability somewhat (for example, I now know the boom bots are an awful first choice, because Brann), but there's no reason we shouldn't have a mixture of both
---
Nice! What cards carried you the most through the run?
---
What does that do?
---
MY JAW THAT BITE MY CLAW THAT CATCH

They took a peek at what EA was doing with Apex and thought "daaaaayum. That be smart!"

He pretty much had only two stages: Buff murloc and chubby blob. I wish we would've kept the former.

He‚Äôs just replaying the battlecry
---
So what you‚Äôre suggesting is to change hearthstone from a collectible card game to just a card game... This might sound like evil propaganda to you, but without the need to collect cards, most people would lose interest in playing.  
---
I had friends who played magic the gathering that refused to buy cards to improve their decks and didn‚Äôt trade for cards unless they were pulled from a pack. To them, the draw of a collectible card game wasn‚Äôt just the game you played with the card, but actually building a collection was a huge draw for them. To the point that ‚Äúcheating‚Äù by throwing money at buying specific cards wasn‚Äôt actually earning them.  
---
Obviously a F2P hearthstone like you suggested would never truly happen because the current model is working too well to ever risk that kind of (bad) change that would ultimately ruin the game IMO. But what I would like to see is the price come down overall, or at least the amount of things earned through playing increased to be able to keep up a bit better.
---
Imagine indeed. That wasn't even the end of it. Proceed to tell me what cards I should be using and how un-optimised my deck was. For some reason they didn't appreciate it when I speculated about their skill level, losing to such a 'trash deck'.
---
Okay but what about the question part?
---
not at all, observational drawing is a skill too. Besides this helps people learn techniques and perspectives.
---
I got Colossus of the Moon, so yeah...
---
Octosari is great in alot of aggro plays,u can search for legit decks for it
---
In theory 50 is less than 60, so usually it's better to have quests that give you more gold. If you don't have time or patience or whatever it's different.
---
Apex? You know right that the bundles have existed for like 2 years? Also Apex has loot boxes and and a battle pass.
---
&gt; but without the need to collect cards, most people would lose interest in playing.
---
You could be right but I don't believe so for the majority of people.  
---
I would like to think people enjoy playing the game for playing the game as opposed to just getting a random collection of cards.  A full collection for everyone equates to more variety and thus more fun as I see it.
---
He probably fears counterspell
---
It doesn't cost 20 bucks.
---
I've no problem with a mana cheat card like mogu as it's situational - a possibly really cheap/free removal card that isn't really overpowered at all.  Rabble bouncer is similar.  
---
It's the evolve effects that ruin the concept by making stupidly big minions earlier than what should be intended.  
---
Imo it's in the game to promote easy play, much like Zephrys was created.
---
Multiple companies doing the same bad thing does not make the bad thing any less bad.
---

This happens when the board gets full as an end of turn effect. If the board is full BEFORE the end of turn thr boss minion does a clear and switches, if it gets full because of something like this it cannot do another clear after it's attack so it ends up killing itself, like when you mc tech on a full board. Btw, the deathrattle it might have procs for the opponent, not you, because it dies before getting on your control/side of the board.

What, like pirating TV shows and movies?
---
I‚Äôm so disappointed...
---
Wow
---
As long as you can average at least 3 wins in arena you‚Äôre probably better off doing arena instead of buying packs. Arena players are less affected by nerfs and ‚Äúmeta‚Äù strategies. I didn‚Äôt even feel the bomb warrior meta. And apparently that shit was/is rampant. Arena has always been all about tempo and that hasn‚Äôt changed.
---
... *This is our town, Scrub*  
---
Did I do well?
---
People like you make life insufferable
---
Yes, I started this climb end of last season before it became a t1 deck, but due to reset had to start again from rank 14. 62% winrate so far from 112 games.
---
Yeah, the quest seems a bit risky to craft since I dont think we are getting more reborn minions.. But Im also nowhere near getting any other meta decks so it might be the only chance to get some variety from zoo decks.
---
Close enough.
---
&gt;!The answer was *Secret Agent, coming through!*!&lt;
---
you can't have that much gold with f2p decks games, f2p scammer confirmed
---
Never got the 20/20 jade golem picture in game
---
Defile was still OP, probably the best board clear ever. And you can play around almost any AoE-effects.
---
1. Hearthstone has become too expensive and value of purchases has dropped
---
2. Devs don't care to make qol changes like increasing deck limit.
---
3. Balance changes are focused around stealing value from players like nerfing key common/rares to kill a legendary/epic.
---
4. Dusting system is and has been garbage
---
I'm on the verge of quitting, been playing since release. Mtga provides better value and games are way less rng heavy, actually feels like you're playing a real card game and not slots.
---
UI and Spreading Plague (yeah, been nerfed already, but wasn't enough), two of the worst mana cheats in HS history 
---
Cube at least needed other cards to combo with, those 2 instead worked perfectly fine even as stanalones
---
I never used jade deck strategy before, so I discovered, the card changes art and that was one more reason I decided to go on with this.
---
shame they don't attack each other
---
How do you reduce the cost of subdue? Lens..?
---
Edit: just saw its wild nvm
---
Because once it gets to it's turns where it can reasurrect minions it cheated out, there's no stopping it.
---
When Year of the Dragon ends it will go to Wild
---
People riot over them not getting stuff. It's dumb, but understandable from Blizz's perspective.
---
But you have to play a shitload of WoW then, right? 
---
I'm just curious...how much effort is needed to "produce" like 300+ Dollar per year with wowtokens? (I imagine you pay your subscription with tokens as well) 
---
Grinding, daily quests, auction house flipping? Are we talking about 2h or more like 10h per day?
---
Provided their code isn't completely spaghetti, it should be minimal work to incorporate game logic into the client: instead of sending data to the server, pipe that output to a local thread running the server logic, same goes for receiving data. It's not like they have no benefit for doing this, tbh I think the team is just lazy. Offloading the computer work of running AI to the client's computer would actually benefit Blizzard. I think the potential concerns they may have are kinda dumb. 
---
Size concerns: no. The size scale of code to handle server logic, in comparison to the size scale of textures, sounds, etc. is marginal. Not making server logic a part of the client due to size constraints is BS.
---
Security concerns... maybe, since it's _possible_ to decompile the unity game and reverse engineer the scripts... but what would be the point of hiding how the game worked? It's not like there's anything in the logic they don't want anyone to know, except maybe for how Zephrys worked. If Blizzard wanted to prevent people from exploiting the game, putting the server logic behind a curtain won't remove those exploits, only fixing the code itself will. Allowing the logic to be reverse engineered simply holds them to a higher standard. 
---
I feel like the only valid concern is that making server logic a available offline might enable people to play on LAN or 3rd party servers, which could give them access to all cards without needing to buy packs. However, if this is the case, Blizzard could easily threaten legal action instead, as they're not a small indie company. 
---
Hearthstone is the only title that I've heard of that runs game logic solely on their dedicated servers. Even Shadowverse, the Hearthstone clone, allows you to continue singleplayer games when disconnected from the network. We're taking things for granted that we really shouldn't. When I'm found without internet, perhaps in a remote area or on an airplane, shouldn't I still be allowed to play your card game?
---
psychic scream, it was the only reason priest was good at some points, that's why they probably never nerfed it, but it felt horrible to play against.
---
well that's kinda cheap isn't it just exact copying?
---
Thank you for pointing this out. We'll add it to our collection of thousand's of other posts covering this exact glitch.
---
Lol
---
Just go wild i feel. I found I stopped caring  about quests all that much and have like 10,000 dust backed up because I very rarely craft any decks
---
Oh woops yeah my bad. That is a good card admittedly.
---
Holy shit, same. Screw buying packs or whatever. These adventures are the only things that help me ignore how stale this game oftenly gets.
---
That's the way evolve has always worked.
---
Yes. Pretty neat.
---
I don't usually play Zephrys against hunter with secrets because I mostly play wild, so I don't know. Mirror Entity gets destroyed by Infiltrator. The actual reason is probably what you said tho.
---
and the simmetry...how majestic
---
It still feels abysmal to play against, it‚Äôs basically a deck with maybe 1 weakness, and that‚Äôs the early to mid game, even that is just based on draw
---
Lifedrinker
---
wtf
---
Friendly reminder that what you might deem not fun or worth the money is not the same as other people. I enjoy the single player content almost as much as constructed (and sometimes more). I like seeing the new twists on it ez h expansion. 
---
$20 is about 20-30min of work for me and I‚Äôm happy to buy it when I‚Äôm likely getting 15-20+ hours of entertainment out of it. I‚Äôm happy to pay less than a dollar per hour for entertainment value. It‚Äôs way cheaper than other stuff like going to a bar or a movie. 
---
No worries if you don‚Äôt feel the investment is worth it but don‚Äôt make blanket statements about how it isn‚Äôt worth it to anyone. It‚Äôs misleading, disingenuous and factually wrong.
---
A golden card that fit the theme would have been nice. Or a second pack for finishing the run, if Blizzard was feeling generous. Or even an old LoE pack, just for the flavor.
---
What is the trenchcoat treasure?
---
Thanks! Yep, it was just straight aggro paladin -- simple but effective. I'm a fairly new player, and just have a couple budget constructed decks: Murloc Shaman and Combo Priest). This played surprisingly similar to both, in that got going fast with early game buff combos, and then had a burst point for lethal mid-game (Stormwind Champion) functioning similar to Bloodlust or Divine Spirit + Inner Fire.
---
I used the Heartharena recommender to draft it, with a couple slight modifications aimed at countering mages (e.g. fewer one-health minions), as they seem to be running rampant in the reborn arena meta.
---
Hahahahhah
---
For sure, it came in handy pretty much every game. Light's Justice also felt totally broken when played turn one.
---
Rogue and Paladin
---
That's an odd choice IMO, it was the only way priest could deal with a board and it didn't even hit until 7.
---
I was coming to post about this now as well. I pressed on the message boxon the choose your loot screen to try get it to disappear and it chose a shadows bucket.
---
Good thks!
---
No it isnt giving players some free stuff is necesary if they keep bumping up the cost of the game. Also they dont have to give anything with value just something cosmetic.
---
I really hope Whizbang goes into the Classic set.  I doubt it will, but I hope. :'(
---
Hunter quest is #4 Uldum quest and has a positive winrate. It is not played to the extents druid/shaman/paladin are, but it's definitely not bad as quests go.
---
People complain about and refuse to play hunter quest because they think it's terrible, but it isn't.
---
Warrior quest might get support in the future, but right now yes, it is pretty bad. Its still better than mage/warlock ones tho.
---
Oh shit I played that guy yesterday and he said the same thing lol
---
Did he have a Bowel Movement and skipped his turn ?
---
The dream, I dont know how anyone can play pirate warrior still
---
r/hearthstone users love nothing more than telling other r/hearthstone users that they don't play HS anymore and moved on to MTGA
---
Oh shit, I just realized this happened to me, I didnt even think about it, guess assuming blizzard can code is a bad idea
---
Yes, it's empty.
---
All the Death Knights were OP. Rexxar was just good near the tail end of the era.
---
I don't consider Rexxar a better Death Knight than Jaina, Guldan, Anduin, or Malfurian. Thrall, Valeera, Garrosh, and Uther weren't unplayable either and popped up here and there. They were all OP.
---
T√≠pico de argentino: Seguir robando y no arreglar el problema.
---
I just use the random cardback option
---
Because blizzard only knows how to make mana and stats change and neither could be done on UI (no stats and cant be 11 mana)
---
It was an honor to witness the power of daddy kiblers BM power level. It was as invigorating as DR Disrespects mustache and honestly im enlightened.
---
Ooh, so close..
---
Yes but it didn't and still doesn't need nerfing.
---
it one thing to shit on the game another to not take criticism I am criticising the game for blizzard is not able t do shit if u have problem the u fuck off cuz u can't stop me can u now huh bitch??
---
Dr. Boom. Rotation wasn't a thing then, and it was consistently better than Ragnaros
---
by the way its ppl like you who are gonna kill the game with ur wishy washy fan boring criticisers like me is what the game needs ryt now so that the game doesn't die
---
Someone is triggered just like the secrets that he didnt play around
---
Blah blah blah
---
It felt so good. #kiblerismyfather
---
Works as planned then?
---
And you could use it to shuffle a lot of bad cards into the deck, making topdecks bad for aggro/control and massively delaying a combo. Absolutely insane card.
---
Ok, so criticize it? You literally didn't give one, you just said game shit developer bad
---
Your Wallet looks cool. Even if it is empty.

For someone looking to rejoin the game what is this
---
Interesting take, I'm running a Rogue with Octosari, Sahket Sapper, Necrium Blade, and Whelp as well, but I run the thief package for massive tempo and don't do highlander for consistency. Blade into Sapper is crazy good for tempo as I've discovered.
---
How does Anka work for you? I actually cut it from my list since I realized it didn't get out the first whelp earlier which I would have wanted, and often times I would rather have the bigger bodies.
---
You never heard secret mage on wild!? Stop complaining!
---
The decrease in playrate of Odd Warrior isn't the reason secret mage is so good, its winrate stayed virtually the same before and after the nerfs.
---
Do you keep opening it in hopes of finding a big note, and keep getting disappointed when you don't see an orange glow?
---
It's not a terrible deck. You can easily have a positive win rate with it if you are not playing against taunt-heavy or heal-heavy decks consistently. It's also a pretty mindless deck to play if you just want to smorc

Tombs of Terror for 15$ probably won't hit that same value proposition but I think it may still be good bang-for-buck. It's really up to you whether you have fun.
---
I just Naturalized it. Easiest win ever.
---
A board full of 3/3 wolves? That no longer exists in Standard, and has never been a problem in Wild. I don't understand which gamemode you could be talking about.
---
Finding Tip the Scales in your mulligan Turn 3 coin Prismatic Lens into Leeroy and Prismatic Lens then on Turn 5 right before you cast Prismatic Lens you draw the other Tip the Scales
---
Never played much wild. Climbed from rank 19 to 5 with 85% winrate (35-6).
---
Pretty good deck.
---
I still have PTSD
---
Exactly. Just hold them till you've drawn shirvallah or if you can guarantee the spell it'll hit is useless at that point in the match
---
Im not saying its the reason lol, but nerfing its hardest counter isnt helping anyone
---
Officer this redditor right here is a pedophile
---
How did you keep yours in such good condition? Mine is on it's last legs; Still intact, but starting to fade fast
---
Dinotamer Brann has been added to your deck.   
---
Every deck.
---
Actually Sn1pSn4p replaced Myra, and it really makes a difference.
---
Try a lot, I like the lowest mana combinations possible myself.
---
Bro Zephy gave me a Black Knight. Really wasn't that much of a fight lol
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's the best deck in wild (team rankstar, the most highly regarded tier list for most players, actually called it tier 0), even though people are teching against it
---
It is cheap to craft, relatively
---
It is arguably very easy to pilot (occasionally there is timing of when to play what secret such as counterspell, and when to trade vs go face with your minions, but it mostly plays as a very aggressive deck with a straight forward mulligan)
---
It beats most of the meta decks and just clowns on meme decks
---
As a mostly wild player I would really like to see it nerfed OR more support given to other decks
---
The problem is, right now wild is 1) secret mage or other less good aggro decks such as odd rogue, or 2) very greedy, often reno decks.
---
Think I might actually come back to standard for a bit.
---
It draws two cards. With the point of the deck being emptying your deck
---
If even the new highlander mage builds don't work... I guess it's rip mage until December, again.
---
It's the same thing as when people would foolishly try to use [[Aldor Peacekeeper]] on [[Lightspawn]].  
---
It just don't work that way.

That‚Äôs if they are able to fight deathwing in the next expansion
---
Theoretically, (values in Canadian dollars)
---
1 pack = 100 dust = $1.75 (40 pack bundle) -- $2.00 (2 pack bundle)
---
1 Legendary = 1600 dust = 16 packs
---
16 packs = $28 -- $32
---
Legendary odds 1/20 packs = $35 -- $40
---
So $5 for a free legendary seems like good Blizzard value.
---
Definitely use Google/Apple pay from your phone in dates
---
If he survives a turn you get 1 card, same as all the other card draw neutrals around his mana.
---
He'd still be considered worse than the other 2 drops. Some decks might swap the acolyte because he is 1 less man, but the acolyte would still be better. If he isn't drawn early then he'll just be a liability in the deck.
---
*Dinotamer Brann has been added to your collection
---
Till you put a duplicate in your deck
---
There were a lot of changes throughout the beta.  There were a few small nerfs beforehand (UtH and Eaglehorn bow, though UtH was a big nerf at the time), and there was some things like gadgetzan, leeroy, souldfire, etc.  
---
Took about six months for undertaker to get hit.
---
Well thats just not true, he was always played in rogue
---
The bosses have high enough APM to attack before the weapon actually breaks. Maybe they can coin mountain giant
---
Same but with dog chew marks
---
I'm pretty sure they can coin into Kalecgos and still play the discovered spell for free!
---
Hopefully the drop rate is better than blizzards!
---
"viable"

In case someone is wondering - King Krush is supposed to be green, so the new version (on Dinotamer Brann's artwork) is correct. [That's how King Krush looks in WoW.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B8zO1TgAXIE/TmEoLM9BzeI/AAAAAAAAAQQ/0nkvwr5psk8/s1600/King+Krush.jpg)

The art was taken from TCG and was supposed to depict another creature (I'm saying supposed, because the original WoW TCG art is also wrong, lol).

Yes
---
You are thinking of drawing in control decks, this in midrange/aggro is insane.

Yeah, I can only use one card back at a time and, as others have pointed out, you can barely see it. Time to diversify!

Underrated comment
---
A bunch of HSreplay data is skewed up. HSReplay players are better than average (55% or so), and their decks are identified more often (because it already knows all the cards). Some of their stats are gathered in a more symmetric (like overall class winrate) fashion and can be trusted for their value, rather than their relative value.

Maly Rogue I play has an 80% win rate against big priest (over 100 games played). Only losses are either a different version of priest, or T4 Barnes into Rag combined with bad draw
---
Edit: Not bad against other decks as well, sporting something around 60% win rate - played well over 300 games with the deck.
---
Can't he still attack face even if there is a minion with taunt? he never seems to hit my taunt minions :(
---
Mountain Giants have been dropped early by Warlocks with no issues whatsoever for years. Hand Paladin exists rn as a deck which can drop giant on 3 with the coin, but its very far from a metabreaker. Conjurers made giant broken, why should giant pay the price.
---
I think I will craft her I mainly play hearthstone for fun and everyone says burgle rogue is fun. I usually spend money on expansions so it's not exactly like 1200 dust will be the biggest loss at next rotation
---
Tess isn‚Äôt a good card.
---
Like...even in thief rogue decks, it tends to be the worst card in the deck.  I watched someone I know refine a wild Tess deck, and he ended up cutting Tess from the deck.
---
Tess is a fun card, but not a strong card.
---
What did you lose to?
---
The wild Reno Mage with taunt minions will buy a lot of time against Secret Mage.
---
I play for fun mostly. Not a control warrior main. Do you have that deck code so I can have a look?
---
Yeahh thats the important point :D
---
She's fun, but really only comes in crucially with control warriors.
---
Online
---
It costs alot more money to get legendaries any other way so 5 dollars jsnt a bad deal comparatively speaking. That being said, I don't want to spend 5 dollars on a legendary because personally it's not worth it.
---
So in terms of value compared to what options we currently have? ABSOLUTELY
---
In terms of "would I buy this?"? No because I'm pretty much f2p and spending money hurts my soul.
---
Don‚Äôt worry. Control warrior will be sitting back on top in a month or so.
---
? I don't get it
---
Ive played the quest deck alot and it is really fun if nothing else all the randomness makes it really enjoyable. Plus alot of decision making involved so its not a braindead deck which makes it more fun imo
---
Yeah Aldor is a lot better than pyro equality if you're playing midrange paladin that wants to control the board. LoE era paladin specifically did this a lot.
---
The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
---
This needs the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme attached to it.
---
that's what wild literally is for.
---
if your bored of playing with and vs meta then be the one differietiating
---
How would they ban decks? What's to stop someone from running the exact same list +/- a few tech cards. And if you are planning on banning the majority of the list, most classes become pretty much invalid after not very long; there's too many overlapping powerful cards that are staples in decks.
---
you can play in wild.
---
If you mean the cards, you can craft them or you can buy packs or old adventures on blizzard shop.
---

---
your mind, ugh
---
rank 1 an dnot legend? why stop?
---
Oh, right. I didn't get that at all, in two runs. But I remember it from one of the other dungeon run gamemodes, and yeah, it's incredibly strong.
---
I used shadowreaper anduin and mulch to kill him.
---
the Finale will give us another 3 packs... so add 300 gold
---
It may be what wild is for, but Wild certainly has a meta. I play mostly wild and run into the same decks over and over.
---
Huh, that is weird.
---
IMO Mage would've been fine if the had only hit Pocket Galaxy.  Pocket Galaxy was obviously broken but even during RoS Cyclone Mage never had an oppressive win-rate and, without the mana reduction from Pocket Galaxy, I think it would still be fair post-patch.
---
...oh.
---
all set.
---
Psychopomp with wisps and Treants. Dumb
---
Not that it mattered. That spell always pulled him from my deck anyway
---
That‚Äôs too big of a wallet for you to only hold 40 dust in it
---
When eater of secrets came out, I wanted it to be good soooooo bad. I put it in so many decks when I didn‚Äôt need to, and now it‚Äôs finally good. 
---
When I saw the saviors cards, I knew secret mage would be pretty nuts and decided to craft it. I had no idea it‚Äôd be Tier 0 nuts though and now one of my old favorite cards is the bane of my existence.  I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs good now, but I‚Äôm on the receiving end now lol. Kinda ironic and funny to me
---
wow.. you spent lots and didnt commit to daily play. make me wonder how much the average daily player spends on blizzard
---
I would think all you would need to do is ban certain staple cards for certain decks. For instance, Highlander Hunter is really popular right now. All you would need to do is ban the highlander cards.
---
It's literally hearthstone, spend money a lot !
---
That's not the game designer's fault at all then, just poor investment on your part. Don't buy packs for money, it really isn't worth it. If you have trouble with not spending it on Hearthstone, just unlink your credit card, makes it so much harder to impulse buy things. I speak from experience on this part :)
---
The amount of times you have changed goal pasts in a five minute conversation is staggering.
---
But what money are you going to put in it? The game costs so much you have none to put in it. 
---
Kidding. That's freakin sick and I really want one!
---
Haha man if you wanna point to a comment of mine that is inconsistent with "Secret mage was the most popular deck before and after the nerfs" please be my guest. You seem to want to argue over nothing, I'm genuinely not sure what point you are trying to make. Nobody mentioned anything about how popular secret mage was before the expansion besides you lol

Reminds me of Frightened Flunky. I played against a guy that played 6 Flunkies, both of which ended the chain in an Armegadillo. All before turn 9, because I got hit by some big boy Tomb Wardens on 9.
---
Whats with covering their eyes, theyre streamers lol
---
Huh - that's an interesting way to look at it that would never have occurred to me. Yeah, I can see how that could have value.
---
Im pretty sure theres no canceling the adventures ai hero power unless its an intended mechanic
---
So youd unban cards, then people would just use them again? Its literally a very expensive meta game circle
---
&gt;This game is impossible to start playing from the very beginning with a free to play ideology. Don't you think so? 
---
This question is worded in a very leading matter.
---
Granted, the statement is more than false given thousand dust decks have taken people to Legend before.
---
&gt;There is not a way to progress if you are new, or a returning player. For example, me, decided to craft murlocs to have a decent shaman build. It took 1400 Arcane Dusts, to create some rare murlocs. A couple of epics too, of course, but that was all i had in my hand for which I had not grinded. That was all I got from my transaction prior to the previous time I installed the game. And all I could climb to was 19. Guys with legendary combos ended my misery. 
---
How would you define "progress" exactly?
---
Are you sure part of your issue isn't you're own personal lack of skill with the game? I am likely playing a very similar Murloc Shaman around Rank 5, and it is doing alright.
---
Knowing what to play and building a competent deck is important, but a good deck alone will rarely win you games if you're not particularly good at the game.
---
&gt;Are there any people actually took the pill and made enormous transactions (like 10k $) in total in-game to collect cards? 
---
Yes. There are people willing to drop complete bank on Hearthstone. This is not an unusual thing for a card game.
---
However, doing so in Hearthstone is rather dumb given how far a smart budget can take you.
---
&gt; Why is arcane dust so hard to obtain? Any advices on collecting arcane dust? 
---
It really isn't that bad as long as you:
---
1. Aren't crafting new decks every time you open the game
---
2. keep up on your quests
---
3. build decks from your collection first then from dust
---
The best advice to collecting cards I can give is be conservative with your collection.
---
&gt;Why is wild regarded as a remedy for not having adequate cards or being a newbie? 
---
In part because a deck built in Wild is unlikely to even be completely useless. Three year old archetypes like Pirate Warrior and Jade Druid have remained more than playable there since those archetypes' inceptions.
---
&gt;Isnt wild a place of certain death for those who don't know how to play? 
---
Not necessarily, but you will find yourself constantly reading your opponent's cards if you aren't already aware of what is popular in the format.
---
&gt;Its not hard to guess that guys that hoarded OP cards of the past and there are so much variety of plays that can occur? 
---
There's no deck in Wild that's just a pile of the best cards Team 5 has produced in the last five years. Stuff like the original Dr. Boom, Ragnaros, and Sylvannas are rarely seen in the format outside of decks that seek to somehow abuse them.
---
Wild is a place where every card in your deck should, optimally, synergize with every other card in your deck. Wild Mech Hunter is a pretty good example of that as is Secret Mage. Ironically, these hyper synergistic decks do tend to be rather cheap to craft even from scratch.
---
Fusion 360 and rendered in keyshot
---
How would you even ban a deck?
---
I mean, no one thought that nerfing Dr. Boom by increasing the mana cost by two would do anything to allow other control decks to flourish. So, not really sure who you‚Äôre arguing against.
---
Haunting memories from Classic of Sunshine hunter vs Control Warrior. RIP 11 mana Ysera.
---
Have you tried playing wild? I would assume you have a noticeable wild collection by looking that you have played $500 and played since BETA. Or were you can idiot and disenchanted all your wild cards.
---
Not for long
---
Becouse of the in game reward system. Must achieve that legend rank!
---
On my first run, I had no idea what these things popped out. It took me a while to even realize that anything other than those fucking 8/8 worms or the 7/7 taunt thing could come out.
---
Considering this is like the second fight, I figured this shit was one of those fights you're just scripted to lose like the Lich King prologue.
---
The general problem with Hearthstone today is that Blizzard printed a low number of aggro tools, so greedy decks like these - that basically do nothing relevant in the first 4 turns - have became relevant. It doesn‚Äôt need a nerf - it‚Äôs not OP or unfair -, Blizzard just needs to print more aggressive cards for tempo rogue and zoolock in next expansions.
---
Mechathun, magnetize skaterbot onto it, Subdue mechathin into being 1/1 and rush it into something, win the videogame
---
I mean they lose to aggressive decks. In fact a lot of the slower decks lose to aggro. Play one of the many aggro decks and you shouldn't have an issue.
---
Regarding your quest issue, if you've got a friend or alt account, you can complete your quests this way. Or you can try to learn the arena format, (although this way is much more challenging, it gives the most profit BY FAR if you're good enough. 12 wins = around 350 gold and 1 pack profit, whereas in standard, you get 40 gold). Some people in this subreddit will tell you that arena is a no-skill format, but this is just false. 
---
Regarding your winrate, people will make assumptions that you're not a very good player since you're stuck at rank 20. The way to prove how good or bad you are at the game is to show replays. Maybe you'll learn a few things by watching your own replays or receiving others' perspectives.
---
&gt; But I think a game should not be begging for money this casually.
---
Unfortunately, with lack of competitors and the company being Blizzard, this is just the way it is. However, this doesn't mean that being f2p isn't a nonviable option; you just gotta invest time and effort instead of money. That's how it goes with any f2p game.
---
i also go to a small school. i haven't met to many people who also play hearthstone. it seems like the bulk of people are Overwatch players
---
Lol both times i've played he's gotten a cursed blade as his second weapon and it was easy win from there. The weapon pool is reasonably balanced though so I like his hero power.
---
Tortollan and puzzle box
---
Seaforium bomber or whatever the bomb creating minion is called might  help if they dont drop the lens early
---
The reasons you gave are exactly why Zilliax shouldn't be in the Classic set. Those are the criteria given for the first group of Hall of Fame cards - Neutral cards that were so good they were played in massive numbers of decks, even when there was no synergy. Zilliax should definitely rotate.
---
Go mass production, and sell me that fucking wallet. EPIC! if I had plat i'd give it.
---
Spreading plague: Choose one: Destroy an aggro opponent, or give yourself 3 more turns to finish your OTK combo.
---
At least you didn't get a normal Rogue Quest
---
No, no, it's alright!
