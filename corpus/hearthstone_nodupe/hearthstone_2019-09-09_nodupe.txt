Were you the kid in class who put your hand up to answer a question just to say "I don't know"?

Pro players rope way to much.  His own damn fault.
---
Fenomen0-6.
---
Grizzly was changed due to confusion over whether or not it was a beast.
---
Zayle wasn't really a golden legendary, it was just a funky deck option, you can't craft it down
---
Yeah, so priest wins like slightly more (58%) of the time. That doesn't change the fact that I spend 20 minutes a game watching some jackass play 4 lackeys a turn while having to stare at card backs while they discover infinite value solutions. My issue isn't whether or not the deck can lose, it's the prevalence of it combined with how boring it is to play against.
---
Did you just give me an n word pass
---
Hi! I made it with EVA foam, contact glue, hot silicone and acrylic paint!
---
It had the beast tag though.
---
I agree but I cant help but thinking, its just an azure drake no one is gonna freak about it
---
And anotha one
---
I got the mage quest :(
---
Still hyped for the single player, and the more card backs the better
---
Itll be strong with about 2-4 mana but past that itll be steaming hot buns especially after 7
---
But other ghostly creatures in the past weren't beasts.  So they made it not ghostly.  To date the only exception left is Arfus.
---
Leroy
---
It's interesting comparing the old quests to the new quests. Not only were the old quests significantly harder to complete, you also had to pay 5 mana to play it.
---

---
Compared to these new quests that are super easy to complete (Often done turn 5-7) and just constantly generate value.
---
Worthy Expedition? That's a Choose One card, and pretty tame in comparison to Omega Assembly and such, so it feels way less awful, especially since stuff like that has always existed up to a point
---
This was 100% on Feno he even said that himself in his tweet. You have no idea how absolutely wrong you are lol.

Depends on the matchup. Because you play dick all spells in Quest you sometimes really need to fish for them from Ethereal Lackey (healing against Rogue, AOE against Scales Paladin, silence/hex against Mech/Quest paladin)
---
I'm with you, the roping every turn gets old. I get that these are complicated turns and require some thought, but come on this has happened enough times now there is no excuse for it. It's a complete misplay.
---
3D printed Card back, painted to look like wood. This was a fun side project.
---
Huffer is RNG and therefore balanced. You have no argument from me on the other two
---
If you think winning 58% of the time in a MU is slightly more then you're impossible to please. Also, you're not playing for 20 minutes as Priest, you're winning in 5
---
Animations could be quicker, but that had zero impact on the outcome of this play.
---
Why are people downvoting this, this is great.
---
I mean. I am. For fun. Because heal-tank(taunt, but I named it heal-tank) Quest combo priest is memey. And apparently no one but warrior plays taunts?
---
It’s a cool concept but how would it be implemented? Would it be like a permanent nozdormu or like blitz chess games where the player has like a 30 second clock and a 5 second buffer. Both options just seem like a play aggro and pray type gamemode though.
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
When I play the Goblet I get 7 copies of Prep.
---
Maybe you’re right. I personally would call it alright, but that’s just arguing semantics
---
Because Feno is one of the best players in the world who took the correct line of play and then fucked it up in front of 40k people. There’s nothing wrong with feeling sorry for him even if it was 100% his own fault. Everyone makes mistakes, it’s gota be hard blowing a win on the big stage when he’s already had such a rough season in GM.
---
Edit: done with Techboss1000#1421
---
Deck code? :\^)
---
Risky click, literally just made me laugh so uh thanks?
---
He did take the correct line of play. He would not have screwed it up if he started his turn, you know, at the start of his turn.
---
I looked it up, but I couldn’t find it
---
&gt; This could be applied to any 1-drop tbh. No matter how insane a 1-drop is, don't forget it's still a tiny 1-drop.

---
As a 7 cost you could play warlock and tag it with a treachery then make your opponent draw 7 likely burning several even better if can kill it same turn.
---
&gt; If you look at all the druid decks in history they all just hero powering at turn 2 and 3 and not using all their mana unless they are a token deck. So no they not sacrificing anything.
---
Innervating out a threat in MR druid, jade idol, jade blossom, shade of naxramas, wrath, Darnassus aspirant, living roots, Feral rage, greedy sprite, sometime doomsayer got played, the various 2/3 mana cthun cards, keleseth, stonehill, tar creeper.  All cards played by late game druids.  And let's not forget wild growth.
---
And that’s ignoring the plethora of neutral cards spiteful druid ran, because while it’s not token druid, it falls into the early/midgame strategy, so I feel that's fair enough to exclude.
---
Now let's look at the actual druid deck in question, the quest druid.  You give up playing crystal merchant turn 2, you give up turn 1 worthy expedition, you can’t wrath on 2 to deal with a threat, or BEEEES!!!! On 3.  No power of the wild for early tempo, nor swipe on curve.
---
Would druid sometimes just hero power turn 2/3?  Yeah, against slow decks sometimes.  But you can bet they’d much rather play out cards if they would.
---
So you ARE sacrificing tempo by not dealing with the board efficiently and letting the enemy get ahead of you, by removing things a turn later you take damage, let them buff, build a board, let them answer your early plays more easily.  There definitely are losses of tempo, and there sure as hell are consequences when enemies get ahead and the board gets away from them.
---
Dalaran was nothing before the plague of NAXXRAMAS
---
Happy cake day!
---
Don’t want to disappoint you but they are mainly from Classic WoW.
---
I dominate wild with Pirate Warrior.
---
Oof
---
Sometimes you just play him early for a 6/6 or something, don't try to always goes too over the top with him as there is more of a chance your opponent will be able to clear him. Also when you learn the decks a little bit better you can try to bait those cards out of their deck and then use him. Otherwise go for the hail Mary and hope rnjesus is on your side! Good luck, it's a fun card and always has been!
---
So how many Pro players are taking Mage to competition right now? None?
---
Trumps a student poggers pepega
---
Loatheb
---
the new tavern brawl is stupid easy it's almost annoying tbh lol
---
I believe it's intentional
---
My reaction to looking at the deck list as I scrolled down:
---
 “I don’t get how did he win he’s got a bunch of thief cards for early game, a couple treasures, and ... ohhhhhhhhhhhh ... OHHHHHH!!!”
---
How many have brought Hunter the #1 class to GM, probably none, haven’t seen a single Hunter yday in the EU games. And tournament is another thing then ladder, if you don’t understand this then you know nothing about this game.
---
Thank you! Rngjsus hopefully will be on my side :D
---
Have a nice day!
---
It's spelled rogue. You're welcome
---
Depends on the deck.
---
In pretty much everything that doesn't care about the immediate murloc synergy, hogsteed is better because it's sticky.
---
In Murloc Paladin bluegill is better because it can get summoned off tip the scales and go face immediately.
---
In Murloc Shaman I think there's an argument for either being better and for including both or neither, but I'd probably have to give bluegill the edge just because it can go face immediately on a bloodlust turn and has angler synergy.

God dammit... out you go!
---
that's literally what he said.
---
I think enjoyment is a big factor. Statistically, the best decks to play are Murloc Shaman, Murloc Paladin, Highlander Hunter and Control Warrior. I don't own Brann and hate playing the other 3 so much that I can't bring myself to learn them. My win rate with Murloc Shaman is somewhere in the low 20-30% and that's considered a top tier deck. Meanwhile, Tempo Rogue, a deck considered Tier 3 right now at best is still a lot of fun to me and I currently have a 60+% win rate with it from the Rank 5 floor. 
---
Theoretically you can get to Legend with any deck you can pilot to a 51+% win rate. It's just a matter of time. I did it once, sat down and got to Legend from Rank 5 over a 12 hour period. *Never Again*. Took too long, and it's not like I get anything for it. I definitely don't want to spend time trying to get to Top 100 because I know for a fact I'm not that good.

Thankfully blizzard made sure to gun down the deck like a degenerates in the street, lowest winrate now
---
Warrior quest is 3 Mana reward to complete
---
best video ever
---
Abort mission, I repeat, abort mission!
---
There's still a lot of expansion cards over the course of standard rotation of that quest for it to work at 5 Mana. They cant make every deck "work" now. Then all youd ever get is power creep
---
The only way I was able to beat it was with Paladin and the Sound the Bells 0-cost cheese.
---
Never said invincible, it has holes.I just don't enjoy playing against a deck that feels like it can do everything.
---
Zpunk#2376 - EU - Trading 80g quest. You go first.

I tried that but only made it halfway...

holy fuck dude i was looking for that meme thanks a lot

By that logic, they shouldn't change it. You'll be able to watch them lose and learn from it however many times it takes until you complete the quest.
---
You want to ruin a potentially unlimited learning opportunity? Shame.

Hmm. I like it!
---
I upvote mixed set mode since beggining of HS
---
*how to slap someone across the internet*
---
They were pointing out the player name not what thunder king says at the start of the game
---
The player name has always said that though; it wasn’t added in a later update. You can even see it in the wiki history for the encounter’s Trivia.
---
So what list should we trust? I see a lot of people citing VS data as a better source.. So hey lets actually look at what they have to say! 
---
[VS data report](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-139/)
---
Oh whats that, mage has PLUMMETED in their rankings going from the strongest class post SOU pre nerf to the absolute WORST. 
---
Okay but maybe it has one deck thats good right? Okay it has ONE deck AT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM OF TIER 3.
---
What about match up win rates? 
---
oh in all ranks it only has THREE favored match ups. Vs Quest Rogue, Zoolock, and Resurrect priest, the SCOURGE of the meta. Everything else is either a bad match up or a coin flip. Its not even played enough from 4-legend to have enough data on the majority of match ups. 
---
Mage is by ANY metric straight fucking garbage right now.
---
Cool, do you find you're self climbing on the ladder?
---
The whole point of CCG's is having access to continuous updates. Competitive but simple strategy doesn't work if people can just figure everything out, after which the game's just going through the motions. Plus old HS wasn't all that compared to current standards, if you leave nostalgia out.
---
Plus powercreep isn't that bad atm. Old Freeze Mage and Handlock could probably hold their own in the meta.
---
Haven't played at that time but ever since I started I hated all those hero cards so much. It's OK for me if a control deck beats my aggro or midrange deck and grints me out, but what just feels extremely frustrating is that one single card is enough to do it and it just doesn't matter what else he has on his hand. I mean you try and use your resources to bate out his AOE, so you can play another strong card after that and when you finally baited out both brawls, the enemy control warrior drops boom and rushes everything down you actually kept to beat him after carefully play around your resources.
---
Nice addition, surprised it wasn’t included sooner
---
Turns out the best armor is made of mud.
---
Yes, that is what happens after charge backs. However, this is a different case - trump **refunded** his preorder after learning he will get a free one from Blizzard. He didn't need 2, but he already opened his packs - so he got negative gold in place of opened packs.
---
And before anyone says *streamer privilege*: negative gold is the standard procedure with refunds of opened packs.
---
Jeez, the world is looking at u

Leeroy. At least you’ll have chicken.
---
Someone always has to be last..
---
Seriously though, what's the point of this discussion?  No one is honestly calling for a return of Lunars Pocket Galaxy right?  If anything it maybe just shows that  Mage was ridiculously reliant on one very silly card.  Also conjuring was simply too good at 3 mana.
---
As for Warrior I'm not remotely surprised they're near the top still, that deck has busted cards throughout and Dr Boom nerf really just helped the Druid matchup and maybe Hunter.  Doesn't do anything for aggro as Warrior doesn't even need Boom to hold them at bay with the amount of removal it runs.
---
I don't think it has
---
The 'like' in that sentence is a parasite word and you can just ignore it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I was confused at first too, reading the 'like' as 'as if'.
---
&gt;so your argument is
---
Im not quoting that whole thing, my argument was blizzard lacks the foresight to have consistency most of the time
---
&gt;and decides to trick you
---
Why are you bitching that i want concrete proof? Its not much of an ask if you're actually right in an argument
---
&gt;he also had about 25 other people upvote him in order to make this appear true
---
I couldn't give less of a fuck who has more upvotes because using upvotes is a terrible metric for deciding if something is actually true or not, you're literally on the platform that upvotes wring stuff all the time, stop trying to use an inefficient and obviously bad metric for figuring out the truth
---
But you said yourself that you know that it is bad? You explicitly mention that you spent a lot of time on it. So you're basically telling people that you want to show something not because you think it's worth showing, but simply because you put a lot of time into it.
---
You're looking for praise, not for the result of your product, but for the amount of time you spent on it.
---
Dire Frenzy off a Marked Shot or Hunter's Pack maybe?
---
Make a list of all the cards you need to play around in each deck
---
So Quest shaman it might be Sandstorm, MCT...etc 
---
Then before you take a turn just check if you are playing into one of those cards/how bad is it to play into those cards
---
🎖
---
did you play dire frenzy, perhaps randomly generated or discovered from a card like shimmerfly, vupera scoundrel, marked shot?
---
&gt;  I'm the drizzling shits at Arena, though, so I'm probably blowing smoke up my own ass.
---
&gt; 
---
Are you saying you're a good arena player or a bad arena player?
---
yeah control decks just tend to be warrior, but there seems to be a small rise of control shaman coming up. I'm not sure how good that is, but it looks like there is potential.
---
What are the `modern control and combo concepts` have you found? I tend to play more aggro midrange cause f2p leans in that direction. (I don't think I'll ever be able to play control or combo as those decks cost quite a bit of money)
---
Is this Bojack reference!?
---
How do you go about finding the sleeper meta deck?

That is because it is the best video that has ever been made about Hearthstone. Some of the references are outdated unfortunately (i.e. Warlock being a non-existent class) but it is so well put together. The guy knows how to write comedy. The callbacks are fantastic. I can't think of any other video that even comes close to this level of quality in scripting.  
---
My second favourite video is Kripp vs Brode unicorn priest.
---
Fair enough on not quoting the argument I came up with, but not everything requires a perfect proof, just enough evidence to show the situation you think is true is beyond doubt to be the case. To me in this situation the evidence that’s been provided is more than enough to outweigh the likelihood of any other situation being the case; certainly the burden of proof would be on you to show that it hasn’t just always been this way rather than on the other guy to show that there isn’t a mini conspiracy from him and a bunch of other people going on

played about 150 matches to optimize the deck. I decided to cut the quest because it makes the deck too clunky and the card in general was a downside even when i mulligan it away. It’s a dead draw vs aggro and even midrange. 
---
i rarely won matches CAUSE i finished the quest - but i often loose matches cause i can’t finish it and so it was a dead card

I'm dead serious buddy

I respect your choice,it is just sad you need to comment to fell better il your life.Good day to you

Holy, why is everyone so angry in this video, I‘d love for something funny happening during my games
---
Why are you even playing games if you don‘t wana have fun
---
Well I sure wish there was an easy way!  Generally the “trending” decks on HSreplay are about a day or two behind when I want to play something new.  I subscribe to some Twitch players that are interested in the same thing and I try and keep and eye out for something new to try on Reddit, YouTube, Twitch, and all the obvious HS websites to jump into the trend early.  Right now I’m having some mediocre luck with that Anka/Octo Rogue list that was uploaded here last week.  Seeking something new!

---
I think this is what must have happened.  That's so unfortunate, he must have had about 5 cards left at that point.
---
Thanks for clearing that up though, the combo I had going was very good, but I just don't think it fitted against the boss I faced!
---
I prefer the one with [Fierce Monkey and Candy Shop](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4e2wna/fierce_monkey_reminds_me_of_a_candy_shop/)
---
I usually keep an eye out on competitvehs and dekkster as he seems to be the one of the only streamers doing competitve off meta.
---
The thing with off meta is there is a learning curve and may not be something that instantly feels good. It might be a sleeper to find a less popular deck that fell out of popularity. Like right now, I think regular token druid will do fine, but no one is testing it as it isn't new and can get rolled over by priest.
---
HA HA HA! FOOL!

I'm playing a special tavern brawl. I'll take 10.

But the same people are playing Warrior, Hunter and Paladin, and their win rates aren’t in the mid forties

When I first unpacked it from the season chest I wasn’t expecting anything great, but holy shit I was blown away it’s been my favorite for over a year now
---
How long before there is a circlejerk post?
---
The problem is that 95% of time people are just bringing known netdecks. So you could say that it's not ideal most of the time.
---
I mean, if you want to just go by what pros say, Firebat said in an interview yesterday that the best decks in the format are Warrior and Priest, (referring to control/bomb Warrior and combo Priest) so...yeah, warrior is obviously doing fine.
---
Though sure, not because of the winrate on this chart (where Priest is below 50).
---
This is fluff how is this gameplay
---
Having optional animation toggle means players that choose to leave them enabled are at disadvantage in some cases... and many casual players won't realize there is a difference or a toggle in the first place. Sadly there's always going to be a half-measure to me the middle road option for the majority of players.
---
Hilarious, i love when pros wait till the rope before doing ANYTHING and then miss actions.
---
On Android it shows up 3 Times
---
It’s not a tech card. A tech card is something like Dirty Rat or Hungry Crab. Something that plans on disrupting or increasing your odds of winning a specific matchup. 
---
Seeing how board control is basically the primary way of beating Quest Shaman, MCT is just a big cunt. It’s like, imagine if Jade Druid had a way of killing Geist before he got off and ate all the Jade Idols. Decks should have a weakness. Quest Shaman is just too overtuned atm.. It reminds me of Control Warrior tbh.
---
But it’s not a joke alright?
---
Bruh moment.
---
The thought appeals to me as well.

Some people seemingly play games purely to see their rank go up. Often these people are not actually good at the game, however, and become angry constantly when playing it. At least that's my impression from when I was trying to play ranked Smite.
---
Yes, they are professional players playing at the highest level, so they know every card. The average legend rank or rank 5 player will probably know any of the commonly played cards, decks and strategies, too. That shouldn't really get you intimidated though as you can play the game and learn about the cards while you widen your collection and slowly build up more and more efficient decks. You will probably play some suboptimal cards and decks for a while and your opponents will do so, too. And i'd say, that is part of the fun of the lower ranks. If you are interested in getting more competitive and climbing the ranks as far as possible, eventually everything will get more efficient, which means: the amount of strategies and cards to consider will narrow down a lot, as a lot of the cards will not be considered good enough anymore and you will face (and yourself play) the same cards and decks much more often, often copied from succesful tournament lists, streams, programers or deck-statistic websites. To me, it is also a lot of fun to maximize the potential of the decks, find and play the best version possible and play against opponents that also play the best that is available to them. That is the fun of the higher ranks, less experimental but more competitive. It's up to you how you want to play the game, you can have fun at every level and with each approach, so don't get intimidated by players that know every card by heart and take your time to get to that point (if you want to), as that will come naturally as you get used to the game and climb the ranks. Or else, don't bother with it and play it the way you want and probably not play at the higher ranks, but face more deck diversity.

Combo Priest is pretty cheap and effective. Also which free quest did you get? There are a few budget builds out there for some of them.
---
naxx is out?
---
It's literally unplayable.
---
Nah, in English most of terms make sense in context.  Death rattle is kind of an obscure one but it fits well.
---
Good thing Big Priest was nerved
---
Linecracker in standard, sulthraze, desert obelisk, Mogu cultist (I have a quest otk cultist but most of the time I don't get to play the combo), pinata. I only play standard so my main focus is on the current sets.
---
This place is jungle...
---
Why?
---
He played it on Twitch a couple times.
---
I got the worst of them the hunter quest which i have a rant about the hunter class in this expansion and the combo priest isnt consistent enough all the highlander and quest decks make it look like a joke in my experience
---
AND WHEN I BOUGHT TETRIS FOR FIVE DOLLARS AT WALMART
---
It wouldn't be too hard to make serviceable ones yourself by printing the designs on magnet paper
---
Nice.
---
I'm using sulthraze in my highlander warrior deck and it does some work for me. If I get that and [[Captain Greenskin]] it makes it super easy to clear off little taunts and close out the game.
---
Why ice fishing? Also I see you're not making c'thun copies. Any reason

It's not though. Murloc paladin/shaman is very strong. Priest is stronger without the quest. Warlock and Warrior are still being played. It's not uncommon to see both those classes at top 50 legend. Quest paladin is not seeing much play anymore since warrior isn't all over the place anymore.
---
Snipsnap on turn three is _always_ good!
---
Ursatron is not a late game card, it's just a solid three drop, normally played around turn 3 to draw cards and contest the board.
---
Highlander Warrior? Can you pass me the deckcode? Thx
---
Brightwing. Hand size synergies. Dragon synergies. Plus random legendaries are always good. 
---
Also been thinking of putting High Inquisitor Whitemane in a Quest Hunter deck.
---
Disclaimer: I own neither of these cards.
---
Dunno how long ago this deck was created, but someone did this against me a few weeks ago, and I did not concede because I had plenty of cards in my deck, and was in no danger of losing soon after he pulled this off.  So I just kept playing.  Eventually, the person using this trick conceded to me.  Not sure if it was the OP or someone else, but again, this was a few weeks ago.
---
They also murdered Equality. I miss Control Paladin so much.

Now that Baku is gone from standard, should it be changed to theee mana? Hard to say
---
Please don't let this be the new blink fox is my favorite meme
---
Shut up and take my money!!! No but seriously though. I will buy these for my fiancé right here right now.
---
Shimmering Courser. 
---
I kept thinking it'd be interesting to build a minion that you could buff but your opponent couldn't kill without minions/silence/AOE, but at 4 mana and only 3 health it's just far too underpowered compared to the other crazy shit you can do in Wild.
---
Huh wonder if it’s still viable with the meta stabilization and nerfs happening?
---
deck list please?
---
it's oger, f2p btw
---
https://youtu.be/GPAsYTzi-iI
---
Some men just want to watch the Wild burn.
---
Whirlkick Master.
---
It theoretically could do what Underbelly Angler does for Shaman, ie generate a lot of value very quickly in the mid to late game, and also be party to rogue bounce and shuffle effects.
---
So you should get turns like Wk M, Evis, Headcrack, Perdition's Blade, Shadowstep the Wk M.  And next turn start the value fiesta again leading off with a 0 cost Wk M this time and maybe sparing 2 mana for a Lab Recruiter so that a little later in the game you can draw into our little value generator again.
---
In practice burgle does better value generation with better tempo and less jank in your deck.
---
He bought the 80 pack preorder and right after blizzard gifted him 80 pack preorder.  He returned it but it was not instantly removed from his account and he decided to open all the packs from it.  The return then happened and he had no packs to take so they ended up taking 8000 gold from him.
---
Wild even mage.
---
Coldarra Drake lets you ping 10x per turn, and there’s the 3/2 that makes your pings deal more damage.  I’ve played it with some success in wild, but haven’t found the right balance of board clears and threats yet.
---
I think it might also work as a highlander deck cause all the highlander payoff cards (that matter) are even.  But that’s a big dust investment if I’m wrong.
---
Trade deficit with China.
---
Apparently. The bar is pretty low since no one here can come up with their own joke. They just parrot what people shout at them on YouTube.
---
What happened? (Briefly)
---
Honestly I think that's the greatest thing on reddit
---
Thank you for your service
---
Best cardback imo
---
Hey itsgiries, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.

Looking for NA, I’ll show quest and you go first please

Ibb#1172
---
Can you still get this adventure with gold?
---
Sea of goons
---
I feel like I rarely see quest shaman. I've been running into a lot of paladins the past few days.
---
craft it only if you wanna lose 100% of games to quest shaman and pretty much never win a game since ladder 99% shamans from rank 5 and above.
---
boooooo :)
---
A lot of people in here suggesting to run mossy over kodo, but in quest shaman that seems pretty bad, especially if shudder recasts it on all the little dudes you summon.  Most people trying to counter priest just run 1 or 2 earth shocks usually.  Some people even run a 1-of plague of murlocs.
---
It's not, but it's still in standard.
---
Thx bro u made my day
---
Much rather play against shaman than I would ” combo “ priest
---
Probably not, because Mind Blast would be more damage for less mana in every situation.
---
Warlocks dont run that though
---
When is a good time to use this card? Noob needs help.
---
Shaman is the new clown fiesta nrg deck now, replacing cyclone mage. Not as bad, but still clown fiesta with all random cards generation.
---
Thanks for posting this. I’m a big fan of wild and it’s nice to see it getting a little more love these days on the main sub. 
---
Format is in a great place and there are a huge amount of decks people can try out. Lots of very cheap options too.
---
Between the [Tommy, Johnny, and Spike](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2002-03-08) breakdown, I'm definitely a Johnny. I like winning in style, with borderline meme decks. Pushing for legend once was enough for me, now it's all about Flark's Boom-Zooka Hunter or Highlander Hooktusk Rogue.
---
You're asking the wrong person.  I would farm casual, the OP is the one implying veterans camp ranked for some unknown reason.
---
i havent been able to fill my board and hand with astral tiger
---
but gladly ive been able to fill my hand with 7-9 explorer hat one time in a brawl
---
Scrolling through the entire comment section, I wish I was as crafty as you. (This is where you say “im not really that crafty, this is easy stuff!” And further my disappointment in myself for not being able to do something like this, great work anyhow!)
---
i log in today and faced literally 5 shamans in a row and quit the game afterward.
---
or big priest
---
Well played.
---
I Mean...ok?
---
But, how do you really feel?
---
Just so we’re clear, I have this money if you have a payment method
---
Yeh I don't like the mirror.
---
weird dont see your request.. will check again later when I get home
---
No longer basic/classic.
---
Why get this salty over a tier 2 deck that gets destroyed just by playing one 6 drop? Lol
---
The fun for a lot of people (like myself 90% of the time) is playing seriously/getting better.
---
Nope
---
Does anyone know how the 'casual' matchmaking works? Is it based on your 'Ranked' level?
---
I have fun experimenting in casual but recently I reached my highest level ever in 'Ranked' (13), I then switched back to 'casual'... I got whooped 8 games in a row, I mean not even close games. Was is just a coincidence?
---
After that, it seemed to return to normal so I am baffled.
---
Seems like you missed your chance
---
no problem. i'm 100% sure hearthstone would just crash.
---
Wow they used another word that is semantically equivalent in context for once. How shocking, did you die from pure horror?
---
I know you’re trying to be sarcastic but having 4 12 attack minions on board on turn 4 isn’t very fun to play against. I don’t really understand who could disagree with that. I was hoping to have a conversation with you about this if you really do think that this is a healthy combo to have in the game.
---
imagine the pocket galaxy value. 1 mana: lose the game
---
I never knew just how much I wanted this until right now
---
[removed]
---
Amazing!  
---
Decklist?
---
Take a break from the game if you’re this upset about it. There’s no need to be a complete asshole.
---

---
Blocked for trolling
---
The meme of memes!
---
I made a deck with the mogu cultist problem is all the aggro decks and rogue hurting on mass removal. I've gotten to point I had it ready to go 5 times but the bastards won't let me play it they keep quitting after I get all the materials. Of course they tend to have 20 or less health by then to. It's mechathun all over again everyone quits before the meme kill.
---
My favorite card back. I love this.
---
The chances of drawing all 3 combo pieces by turn 4 is highly unlikely. Most times, Sniplock gets run over by true aggro decks before they get their combo.
---
Lol this must be a meme I am unaware of.
---
They had a backdrop requirement when they first started and have dropped it ironically enough.
---
Also your problem with it is absurd and very much a you and 0.0001% of viewers problem that's not worth pandering to.
---
It's likely some wierd phobia disorder honestly
---
Beddle berry
---
lol. So it couldn't attack or replace it's weapon?
---
biggatron#1602 NA, I'll show and you go first.
---
Academic espionage. Its the ultimate burgle card that just doesn't seem to work in burgle decks. It's always so close to being good, but never quite there.
---
Undatakah. All the classes that dont kill you to quickly have polymorph and hex / silence cards and then your screwed. The decks that use the card are far too inconsistent and draw order based.
---
So put it back the way it was for the highlander deck that maximized the benefit in the first place?  
---
No.
---
I play her in quest priest. Boy is it useful vs warrior to get extra damage off her.
---
Blame quests.  
---
If you're going to have quests that basically win the player the game by turn 4/5 then you need aggro to combat it.
---
