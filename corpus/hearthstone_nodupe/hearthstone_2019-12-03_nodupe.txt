Actually gold shifter transforms into golden versions of other minions so its quite op

This card just seems like a flavor fail all around. These hammers are synonymous with griffons, not dragons, and elemental weapons, especially hammers, are strongly linked to shamans, not hunters.
---
Are you really that stupid?
---
I think in the next round of new heroes he will be the first to go (not on the 5th) unless he somehow manages to become middle of the pack. He has proven far too hard to balance correctly (used to give poisonous, but was too OP), and idk how they could do it. Maybe he can start with a 1/2 ooze with poisonous or something.
---
I never claimed that it wasn't random. I know what I've found, because I've noted down what occurred, and I would never be so mind-numbingly stupid as to question the data that someone else has collected that you could not possibly know about (outside of stalking me, which I doubt you're doing).  
---

---
I'm 7.5k, what's your point? You know nothing about the situation at hand here and now you're trying to flex as if somehow you being good at a video game means you can extract the data from my Hearthstone history. Smart.

I wouldn't run this without taunt, no way. I think ppl are VASTLY underestimating how easy it is to play around a death rattle board clear
---
What you don’t seem to understand is that this, like all melee weapons, are in fact hunter loot.

You know mindflyers are from d&amp;d right?

Will other cards be updated to use the new terminology consistently?
---
The Discover a Dragon cards are for the 'good' classes.
---
I've heard about all of these except Lightfang.  I'm not really sure how much that's actually going to affect anything, since in battle they usually end up as Shield fodder.
---
divine shield + poison + windfury murlocs are the best comp you can have, it doesn't even matter what the stats are.
---
You can't lose the game if you die before they do

Are you saying Evolve Shaman is worse than Cubelock?

You sound like the kind of guy who thinks Mage is a good class.

Why is this not a warrior card?

The fact that there are people calling that card strong makes me laugh.

* Gryphon Riders from Warcraft III did, in fact, use Stormhammers. [[Source]](http://classic.battle.net/war3/human/units/gryphonrider.shtml)  
---
* In classic World of Warcraft, Shamans were only available to the Horde.  
---
* Dwarves could be Hunters, but not Shamans.  
---
* Hunters, however, cannot use Maces, which weapon group includes Hammers.
---
**Conclusion:** Warcraft lore has never been particularly consistent, so this inconsistency is actually highly consistent.
---
It's easy to generate value with.
---
Whether or not it actually fits into a deck is another question.
---
I thought it was a shaman weapon until I read the 50 comments saying wtf why is this hunter.
---
Lol don't worry, I won that one. I didn't keep triple the other dude and got eventually rid of him - would be too greedy. Ended the game with 17 health

Yeah u know the excitement dies alittle when u know they will nerf 5 plus cards next year but it’s like that every new expansion
---
+1 attack is the important stat for cleave minions and cobalt guardian. A lot of times when you have a hydra it’s worth it to take zoobot primarily for the buff on the hydra. Wagtoggle hero power would hit the more important stat on at least as many targets as zoobot for half as much gold. The main exception to my argument would be poison minions I suppose, where attack is irrelevant.
---
That said a rework sounds reasonable. I just think the difference in power level between the best heroes and worst heroes should be reduced, which can be done by removing or reworking the trash-tier heroes. Can also nerf the good heroes, but I find all of the good heroes pretty fun in their current forms personally.
---
What if you play that 7 mana minion that adds a copy of your opponents hand to your hand? Do you get a 12 card hand or does it stop at 10?

---
But animations are, in most cases, a pretty good reflection of how the game mechanics actually operate. Poison being a great example. Changing animations to things that look completely different from how things operate behind the scenes is even more liable to cause misunderstandings. I say “more” because if this comments section is any indicator most people clearly have zero idea about how any of this shit works and just like screaming “SPAGHETTI CODE” at everything Blizzard does.
---
I don't think it's much of a stretch at all. Fleshshaper + Mutate was already super powerful and they decided to add a much stronger version of it? I don't think it's a stretch at all to think that could be an issue.
---
As for Evolve during its Standard time, there are a few things:
---
1 - IIRC, this was the Mean Streets meta. Pirate Warrior and Reno + Kazakus was the bane of everyone's existence at the time. No one had the time to use Evolve to its potential and...
---
2 - The big Evolve target at the time was a 6 drop, not a 3 drop. That's a HUGE difference in power level. By T7 (or 6 on coin) you were usually dying to warriors or Kazakus could discover the answer.
---
I'm meaning initially. I realized the big mouth later but I kept seeing it as a helmet until I really examined it.

He has 2 hp against druid, and You can see in his hand he is holding another one. Druid definitely won.
---
There certainly is. But on the other hand, the way poison works mechanically right now is totally fine. And it being implemented in the way you’re suggesting it would be one of those “inconsistencies” people in this sub love screaming about.
---
Couldn't you put up the Discussion text without the picture? Or is that not how it works?
---
I think this is logically sound, though it was atriculated to seem like a tautology.  
---
  
---
Lets say that we are looking for "the least interesting number." Well, by being the least interesting number it is now very interesting-what makes it so boring? So another number must be the least interesting again. And thus the cycle continues!  
---
We are running into a problem where the silverback patriarch refuses to be ordered on the bottom, and likes to float up the ranks. So we need to pick a different quality to order the cards on.
---
I have to think that they initially planned to make this a Shaman card but found some balance issue very late in the process
---
Druid's is a 4/8
---
The only ones pulling shit out of their asses are you and the posters you’re referencing. 
---
Divine Shield is not a triggered effect; Poison is. They fundamentally operate very differently in this game. Poison works like Lifesteal, both being two phase triggered effects that occur after damage is dealt.
---
Whether it's a tempo deck or control deck, this Paladin deck is going to have some nice aggro survivability.
---
Oh damn, too bad you have to play them to get the discovery map or that’d OP OP lol thanks for the tip! Might try golding one

Turn 2 \[\[Faerie Dragon\]\]. Turn 3 kill a minion and hit 6 to the face in the following turns.
---
Blizzard doesn't want anybody going to turn 10 to play their dragons
---
Dragon Paladin really just needed additional support to be a deck after Bronze Herald and Dragonspeaker were released in RoS. 
---
Bronze Herald was a terrible card on curve because of the poor stats. I can definitely imagine a decent dragon Paladin deck that goes with Cathedral Gargoyle on 2 into Bronze Explorer on 3. Followed by either a Herald on 4 + a Sand Breath or even a Thekl to begin the life gain off of the lifesteal of the Bronze Explorer. 
---
This with Talritha and Amber Watcher could really push Dragon Paladin into a solid Tier 2 or 3 spot, depending on any neutral 1 drops or the remaining Paladin cards that haven't been revealed.
---
Merging the animations likely isn’t an issue. But a lot of the arguing in this comments section is coming from people suggesting that how Poison actually operates as a game mechanic be changed, while having zero understanding of the ramifications of that.
---
Wouldn't he not have a weapon? And wouldn't his hero power be "Give all friendly Demons +1/+1."
---
Time will tell I guess. The first two weeks are always the best as everyone puts their theories to test.
---
how exactly do you expect to pop this minion before the damage is minimized by the opponent? I highly doubt this card will see any play
---
Ya its *"chenvalla emote"* -tacular!
---
**ERROR non-existent sound file.**
---
Well, you forgot about dragon slayer, which deals 6 damage to a dragon and thus only can be activated when a dragon is on the board. If you meant FRIENDLY dragon you’d be.... wrong still. Zoobot and Menagerie Magician buffed dragons and would whiff that buff if there wasn’t a dragon on board.
---
My problem with this... your opponent could just play around it (i.e. switch every time...) sure mindgames ensue (did they or did they not use their hero power). I feel like spending X mana just for your opponent to be like "ha! " would actually make the hero power useless. It isn't like playing against Nefarian where you know your divine shields are going to pop. THere is still an impact. But just swapping minions, I think random is more fitting/not as broken, even if there isn't much play around. 
---
I actually prefer the random swap position personally.
---
Compared to cable rat it seems really good, but still doesn’t feel like warrior can really take advantage of the lackeys like rogue, shaman, and warlock can.
---
it'll only be awesome for one side..

It's like the cards that also give dragons stats, obviously they'll add dragons into the mix at some point, but right now they're just useless.

Would’ve been more epic if The Curator was below 12 health. As it is, the fact that Ragnaros got a 2nd place finish is impressive.

---
After careful consideration, and reading the comments in a lot of pages about this cards, I agree, this is a somewhat more flexible card. It's indeed good against aggro, and not really comparable to faceless as faceless pretends to copy a minion usually as part of a combo, not copy and take it out with something else as a tempo card. 
---
At the same time, people are thinking about this card in a really big perfect escenario where it copies something big and you basically kill it afterwards, whereas, this is not gonna happen often, and it depends too much on the opponent. So I think this is a flexible card, maybe a 3 out of 5. If you want to get a random card from your opponent board without a battlecry you're better putting a card you want in your deck, not wasting space on this hoping to get some sort of late-game value.
---
But in this context, it is broken, and Blizzard needs to fix it.
---
Not being one of the top 2 decks doesn't mean a class is trash. Even right now mage is pretty good in wild having success recently with cyclone/quest and secret builds at tier 1.
---
Wretched Reclaimer wouldn't be great with this, because the second time this dies, it wouldn't have the battlecry tag applied to it, which means the deathrattle does nothing, which means using Reclaimer on this just makes it a 3/3.
---
A 2 card, 6 mana combo to summon 2 3/3's and a copy of an enemy minion (without removing it) is... not great. Arena-tier levels of power.
---
Why is this stream and the Destiny 2 stream at the exact same time lol
---
You vs the duskbreaker she tells you not to worry about
---
I don’t think mocking others is okay too. There’s a fine difference between bring chill and joking/memeing/teasing and mocking. The former is cool but the latter is not cool lol. Ignore the chat and just enjoy the game/stream, what matters is yourself and not those others who make those comments haha
---
It’s not though. It’s a problem of the animation being too long. There are no issues with the mechanics of how the game handles minions/players dying and triggered effects like Poison.
---
In theory your charge minion would not always attack twice in a row, it just depends on play order. It would be the first minion to attack twice in a battle though... like how charge minions function in constructed. (non-charge minions only attack once in the first 2 turns of combat)
---
This is how I think it would work:
---
pre-game: Player A has 1 charge minion, player B has no charge minions.
---
step 1: All minions are given summoning sickness.
---
step 2: Game determines player A gets to attack first.
---
step 3: Player A's first leftmost charge minion attacks.
---
step 4: Player B has no charge minions so doesn't attack.
---
step 5: Player A's second leftmost charge minion attacks.
---
step 6: All charge minions have attacked so the first turn of combat has ended. The game has already determined that player A has the first attack, so player A's leftmost minion attacks. (If player A was second, player B would attack first)
---
step 7: player B's leftmost minion attacks. Game plays out as usual from here on.
---
Livewire Lance is a measly 3 mana 2/2 weapon, but sees play in Aggro Warrior because getting 2 lackeys is just that good, even if you have little synergy in your deck. This card for 1 more mana than Cable Rat gains +1/+2 in stats and gives you 3 armor in the form of battlecry which is something Warriors care about (Shield Slam). 
---
This card is just crazy good and could appear in basically any Warrior deck (could even replace Shield Block in Control).
---
And I'm just sitting here, being amazed that you got 87 seconds for your next turn after this one. I was betting you'd get, like, 30.
---
And gain 3 armor
---
Wow all of Shaman's 1 mana spells are pretty good.
---
I’m confused about whether it is summoned for you or your opponent.
---
Hit the preorder for the expansion as it's looking to be a decently powerful one. Aside from that, definitely prioritise getting classic packs if you don't have a decent collection there.
---
Given that we're towards the end of the year, I personally wouldn't go to hard in on this year's expansions as they'll only be around for a year. Better to save any money on future expansions so you can get the full value out of them.
---
good enough to see play in the highlander/aggro warrior decks. But no need for it to be played in the control/slower types
---
It was ok in wild Renolock/evenlock when even shaman was more popular.
---
In general the visuals should be sped up in battlegrounds.
---
It's the worst of the bunch for sure, likely because paladin has the most dragon support going into the expansion.
---
I'm not super surprised reviews missed it because 1) It was released in the card dump and 2) Many assumed it would work like previous cards with similar wording like [[Volcanic Drake]] because they didn't read it carefully.
---
Now, how *Blizzard* missed Corridor Creeper while testing, I'll never know.
---
Those Shredders only needed to spawn one tiny spider &gt;:3, I will admit I was hoping for this, just to see Khadgar win.

6/6/4 Dragon | Costs (1) less for each minion that died this turn.  
---
Which game mode is this?
---
So I get your argument for the card having bad art for a hunter and it struck me the same way.
---
However, there have been many times in Hearthstone where the lore has been thrown out the window. We had an expansion about gadgetzan being a metropolis even though it has about 5 buildings.  We had an expansion where all the heroes become undead. All the explorers are hearthstone only characters.
---
Isn't this just the latest in a huge line of them making up their own lore?
---
I can see this replacing livewire lance in aggro potentially
---
I like it
---
You cut too soon for the lightning bolt to own face closure this video needed. I don't play standard at the moment, so is this the natural counter to shamans currently? Or just an unfortunate opponent's draw and turns leading up to this
---
Skull or the OG lackey + dark pact meant you were always cheating out late game level minions and healing the damage you could have took from aggro. I remember starting the game out and dreading ranked because it was plagued with cubelocks.
---
Doomsayer is a meme board clear?

Wow, what a ride.

Most paladin spells you get will be secrets, which isn't great.

So by your logic, you agree that his card flavor is bad.  His card is that he steals from other minions (or the enemy hero).

That looks like my toilet last night.

This can't fetch quests right? I've never discovered or randomly generated a quest before.  What about side-quests?

Maybe they're waiting for the reveal livestream?

I feel like priest could make use of this card. Keep it alive for several turns to deny the opponent to build a board. Maybe. :)

This might be my favorite card revealed yet. So much to appreciate here

The artwork went full pokemon this expansion.

But you do?
---
Ah yes, finally a person here that sees Paladin Dragon the way I do. I'm trying to fit 'some' of the dragon cards into a highlander tempo shell, keeping the mechs and highlander stuff, cutting out the mid-range stuff for dragons. 
---
Based on that approach, I'm not running a lot of the new legendaries, except Dragon Rider. Contemplating replacing Siamat with Crowd Roaster as well, so 9 dragons + Rider at the core. Based on overall mana cost, its actually lower than the Shrivallah/Sarthrovarr Highlander variant assuming Shirvallah has a average cost of 5.
---
Battlegrounds has entered the chat*
---
I actually like this idea, sounds awesome, not practical but awesome. If only priest would get a good board clear for 7 lol.
---
I see two ways of getting such effect balanced - give a card deathrattle or give a card a strong condition - like you should be using highlander deck or at least hold a dragon. In addition I would make it legendary 6 mana 5-5. Btw I was thinking lately of legal ways to reduce armor to 0 and got something like "convert all of your opponents armor to his heath(up to 40)" so you should run Alex too and Thekal wouldn't crying looking on what we have now
---
I think this goes a lot harder than Mojomaster, but that's my opinion.  
---
I'm not saying that it'll break the game in any way. It's just a bit much.
---
I just never would of thought a niche tech card would be printed as a common.
---
Well there was already Skulking Geist, but now you have the Odd Counterpart to it

You’re right, OTK likes this. I was mainly thinking about the reign of Control Warrior.

A card that's over the top complicated for no reason when compared to the released and has been put on customhearthstone maybe a million times.  
---
Sure you
---
Oh really do you have a link?
---
You've got problems
---
Neutral common with a quite solid stat line as well
---
I see what you're trying for here but eater of secrets just does not come even close to comparing. It's stats are so awful for it's cost that it's a huge detriment if your opponent does not use secrets. This has decent stats for it's cost so even if it's just a vanilla 5/5 for 5 it's not complete tempo suicide.
---
He makes time for the big dragons to come and save the day
---
I thought milling/fatiguing was not considered drawing? Like, yes you’re drawing but you aren’t getting a card. That interaction breaks the chain.
---
God this is a mindfuck.

Indeed. This card just made my upcoming Maly priest a lot more interesting.

They made this card because they know thekal paladin and warrior are gonna be a thing in the meta :D

Playing on a tablet here.

Passed round 8-9 when most players have poison, just completing a battle round with the poison animations, i never have more than 34 seconds per buy round.
---
Passed rounds 11-12 im down to 14 seconds per purchase round, giving the ability to buy 1 unit and cant combine passed those rounds.
---
If i face opponents with deathrattle beasts, after pack leader/mamanear buff battles, ill have 15-5 seconds for my purchase rounds.
---
If i face a mech build with cobalts and more than 2 replicating menace magnetised, i compelety skip my purchase round in late game.
---
This also means i cant play beasts no mechs on tablet.
---
Im forced to play demons, murlocs or the menagerie..
---
Lots of things needed to be fixed.
---
I also cannot play dancing daryl on a tablet.
---
Playing a.f. kay is even difficult to discover 2 cards, buy a token maker, sell the token and level to tier 2 on round 3 and not run out of time
---
well, rip the existence of meta armor gain decks. only hope for armor now is the hope that nobody runs this.
---
that being said, you can still have plenty of fun playing decks that get run over by one mechanic. I have a wild paladin undertaker deck that results in a permanent taunt on the board, it completely folds to silence/transform/etc but often enough the opponent doesn't have any of that and it's still fun as hell. I would expect Linebacker Druid doesn't actually worry too much about this, for example, because there aren't really any good wild decks that stack armor, at least enough to where people would actually run this.
---
Yes like why does he need lifesteal. That makes it just stupid
---
Power creep does not mean what you think it means.  
---
If it were actual POWER CREEP, it would be a 2 cost, neutral minion with these same effects and tribe. It costs more, AND it's a class only card, which are ALWAYS historically and purposefully designed to be better than neutral cards. 
---
Powerful? Yes. Power creep? No.
---
Blizzard made a very big mistake on new armor-hate card (5/5/5 destroy all armors) : they literally remove control warrior from HS forever
---
You can punish a playstyle or a specific mechanic (secret, spell..) but you shouldn't never counter a whole class identity like this, it feeel like a lifetime ban. Also keep in mind the general problem with tech cards in HS is you cant draw it in right time but with that new card it only better by the time when opponent waste more resource for armor
---
Destroy 10 armors ? Good
---
Destroy 20 armors ? OP
---
Destroys 30+ armors ? Madness
---
Then they get killed by a 1 attack Minion.
---
It doesn't need to be run to change the game. It just has to exist.
---
Stormhammers are wielded by Wildhammer clan members, who are most recognized as hunters. Thats why in this expansion hunter got cards like Clear the Way, Diving Gryphon, Dragonbane, Dwarven Sharpshooter and this card.

The important word in my post is "directly". Refactoring is important, hell the software I'm working on is half spaghetti and I have the luxury of being able to work on refactoring if I get a greenlight. It's just the nature of the beast
---
Tfw you can counter Thekal (legendary) with a common.
---
they could if they were attached to a 5 mana 5/5
---
&gt;but hardly anyone plays that mode competitively.
---
Most of the players dont do it competitively. The competition scene is less than 0.1% of all HS players (much less, if I think about it). Using it as an argument is deplorable. Most players enjoy the game in a casual and fun way, not to climb to legend or grind for Grand Masters. Your argument makes absolutely no sense.
---
I try to see it that way. I don't pay for the content I'm purchasing. I'm paying for the game I've played those past months. If HS stop in january, I'm not feeling bad purchasing this expansion because, to me, I retribute the months I played before this expansion.

Actually a dumb investment. They know nothing about industry and they don't have cash to just hammer themselves to success.
---
YES YES YES YES
---
correct me if I'm wrong but couldn't they do what they did for naxx and hardcode some cards to just not work
---
i know kel thuzad instantly kills alex whenever you try and use her on loatheb, and the battlecry doesnt go off
---
Actually, yes. For most players that dont spend (that much) money on the game, the dust value IS a prime factor in deckbuilding. I cant believe someone has to state this for you.
---
As if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
---
Probably would be easier code-wise to just freeze the fuse during poison/lifesteal animation.
---
Well then you have a story to tell
---
Umm huh when I first saw the comment I didn't see a link ok thanks
---
Yeah.
---
Your first sentence is correct. Your 2nd sentence is not.
---
This card also completely breaks all the old solo adventure bosses
---
ah! I see you´re a man of culture as well
---
I believe the comment is not about the design, but how most people there only make OP cards.

Secret mage is one of the most broken decks right now in Wild despite all of the anti secret tech cards that we got over the years
---
It's exactly the kind of rock paper scissors design that has been criticized for years.
---
There are many possibilities for less binary designs (remove half of your opponents armor, remove X armor, remove any armor above 10).
---
This placement though
---
like I said, I doubt he recognized the reborn. That is why he considers it not worthy of silence and such. Did the multy shot clear everything, but the reborned minion?
---
Just like the new Ponyta design in the new Pokemon games.
---
It wouldn't be as bad if they just buffed the old sets a bit to be just below the power level of the new set. As much as I love this expansion, making most of the game feel obsolete is a problem.
---
I first saw this concept when Totalbiscuit and Trump were playing against each other with decks made up of only cards with beards in their art. Did it once or twice with a friend too.
---
Yeah everyone is freaking out but this is honestly a tournament only card that only gets popular if warrior is absolutely shitting on the meta. This cards fine.
---
That is definitely not true. Only scenario for that is against combo or ctrl, and once your armor is poofed and you’re at 10 HP combo is unmanageable and anything ctrl does is a threat.
---
Fun fact, they actually had [a card that flipped the board upside down](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Worldflipper_X-50) in the alpha
---
I'm so glad I no longer play this game lol.
---

Yeah i lv up and upgrade one then I wait for next turn to Lv up again and get 2 mama bears from the rest upgrades
---
This sucks. It probably kills control warrior.
---
Thank god for that!
---
This is the powerlevel an armor tech card needs to be run. Secrets and Weapons are in more classes than armor is, and countering them gives a big tempo. When you go after armor, what you're targeting is much more narrow. Even if your opponent is an armor class, then well he actually needs to have some armor. That doesn't happen if you've been playing aggressively all game. As an aggro deck, if your opponent still has a ton of armor turn 5, are you really going to win if you drop him down to regular health levels?  He obviously hasn't taken much damage to be at that much armor. Then as a control deck your goal is to out-value your opponent. Fatigue doesn't really happen anymore so it's not like it'll be used for that.  Aside from that, countering armor, doesn't effect the board state, or give you any new resources. 
---
As for a combo deck the card is interesting. But it can be countered. You need to put up enough armor that your opponent doesn't threaten lethal, but keep enough armor in hand to re-armor after your opponent uses this card. Though I think most combo decks these days tend to just summon something ridiculous, or skip around health altogether to do their combo more than they pursue burst. 
---
Don't misunderstand me. I'm not calling this card bad, or good design. What I'm saying is, "remove all armor" is really the power-level required to be on par with Ooze, or Secret Eater. 
---
Basically what I'm saying is, this is the power level required of an anti-armor card.
---
&gt; The decline in the player intrest suggests otherwise. 
---
Not really. The last few expansions were relatively low in power level.
---
And guess what people are saying now, “OmG hAnDlOcK iS bAcK gUyS”.
---
Your design is similar, and in my opinion, both are fine cards in the aspect of just increasing the hand size, because it means a lot in Hearthstone. I see a lot of people criticizing how it wouldn’t work on the mobile platform (fuck the mobile platform) but now since Team 5 managed to print that card, it has become a non-issue.
---
People make “underpowered” cards because there are legit critics who browse this sub, and those critics make fun of, and scrutinize these authors who make outlandish effects/started minions, justifiably so.
---
On the flip side of that, you have people (likely people who are so tired of a stale meta) who just love the IDEA of something new and refreshing that hasn’t been seen before, who upvote literal garbage.
---
So my point still stands, the average user on r/customhearthstone doesn’t know how to effectively critique cards as a whole. Shit I’ve played since Naxx but that doesn’t make me a connoisseur of EVERY card in the game and the balance needed to make a card fair AND playable.
---
People who really know what they’re talking about use r/customhearthstoneCJ to point out the utter ridiculousness that comes from this sub.
---
This card only happens by turn 5 if you dropped a thekal and one or two molten guys the opponent might just as well concede
---
I don't see anything in this expansion on the level of corridor creeper tbh. That card was ridiculous, probably the most broken card outside of beta.
---
New just means that it doesn't retain any buffs.
---
I once got this 6-6 that buffs beasts and the similar board. Got wrecked by this tier 6 shit 7-10 that attacks lowest attack minions 😠
---
Trading 80g questo on EU, YOU go first.   chupeee#2659
---
Same as the week you were officially done with HS?
---
balance shouldnt be a major concern on there. its about creative ideas. granted, destroying armor isnt that creative and has been suggested a lot but dismissing a card design because its too strong isnt really helpful
---
Yea the previous powerful tech cards of skulking Geist and dirty rat were epics. I’m glad this is a common. Like they REALLY, wanna kill infinite armor classes. Lol
---
Nothing like that friday feeling!! Oh wait.. its tuesday.
---
What a monster
---
At least then it could be played around, I would prefer almost anything to what it is now.
---
I feel like if it said “Deals double damage vs armor” or something would make it at least have to stick AND attack face. But I’m not sure what it would do vs 2 armor, if it would deal 10 damage or 7.
---
The decline of Hearthstone started in 2018 when they started printing expansions that outside of a few cards (Genn/Baku) did nothing to move the needle. That's when their quarterly reports started saying things like "year over year decline in revenue", "Boomsday performed worse than KFT", and "lower monthly active users"
---
People here said it was to curb the power level of Standard so that it'd be more playable.
---
2019 comes around, and in spite of Ungoro/KFT/K&amp;C rotating, revenue and monthly active users continues its decline. Rise of Shadows performs worse than the Witchwood, and SoU performs worse than Boomsday.
---
At some point in time, you’re just gonna have to accept that they don’t give a shit about wild.
---
LOL who are you to say what eveyone wants or to talk like you already know the meta? you see some strong cards and already say Blizzard BAAAAD? Set doesn't even look like an unbalanced meta or anything, all classes get goid stuff that's for their new archetypes mostly. Who said people saying cards are OP is people being negative? I see OP cards and will freaking WAIT to play the meta before I say stuff like "Blizz doesn't understand us!!!", please.
---
Anti armor tech was sorta needed,but this seems way over the top
---
[removed]
---
2/1/0 death rattle destroy your opponent IRL
---
Not really. Corridor Creeper was one of the neutrals found in pretty much every single deck, because mana cheating is just that strong. Even after the nerf it was still run in various flood-type and evolve decks.
---
could this be too slow for miracle setup?
---
Its a tried and true tactic. Most of the success can be chalked up to the affection people have towards 'feet' in general. So much so that its even been cataloged as one of the most common fetishes. If you study the interactions between a baby and its parents, you'll undoubtedly run into several instances of the feet being the focus.  
---
Is there any reason for the affection and attention towards them? No one really knows. We only know its actually a thing. God bless.
---
Yea they can print some mechanic like Pierce: Ignore opponent armour and divine shield and slap it on any minion.
---
What?
---
I thought so too, and for good reasons. This cards existence alone is awful for warrior. At least in Standard it’s only temporarily, but they killed armor stacking in Wild for literally ever with this.
---
The strenght of the effect fits to the powerlevel of this expansion, but isn’t healthy card design imo.
---
Even then skulking geist is laughing in distant as he was having a jade sandwich as dinner.

The revolution has begun

While all classes have at least 1 dragon, I get the feeling that only a few, like Mage or Paladin, will actually lean into Dragon Tribal.  This makes sense, as it keeps everything from becoming too same-y.  To your point, I think they will reveal more neutral Dragons with some more simple effects in the card dump tomorrow.
---
I would like to point out that Reborn is different from Deathrattle (mostly just synergies, but the biggest difference is probably ressurecting them)
---
Invoke is at least slightly different since it reacts differently based on your class. However most of the time that likely won't really matter, so pretty much just a Battlecry like you said.
---
RIP to every good Dane deck
---
It's only average in terms of raw stats, i.e. a 3/5 + two 1-mana spells for 5 mana. What makes it above average is the synergies it enables. 1-mana spells are a lot more useful in certain archetypes, such as cyclone mage, miracle rogue, et cetera.
---
And you can also run 2 of these beefy 5/5.......
---
If the top meta is a 3 way tie is this even that good? It means that you have 33% chance to meet the meta warrior deck, or a 66% for a dead card. And this doesn’t even guarantee instant win..
---
If it’s 50% meta warrior in ladder, sure, then it’s really good.
---
7+ wins is required to gain gold. 3+ wins is where Arena is a more gold efficient method of buying packs, but you're still spending gold. I can generally average around 5 wins, but 7+ isn't consistent.
---
and a 5/5 for 5 is a fuking joke
---
Maybe now tempo Rogue can have a chance at beating control warriors.... But maybe it's not good enough to include in tempo rogue just for that one matchup.
---
But instead of outright destroying the armor I wanted a weapon that ignored armor. So If you're a aggro/tempo deck and you did a good job reducing the warriors health before he can stabilise late game with armor gain you could still finish him of with reach from the weapon. Destroying all that armor is a bit over the top.
---
Two things on Reborn:  
---
1 - Reborn is "Deathrattle: Resummon this minion with one health remaining." I'm sure I'm not the only one who sees it this way, many people were drawing the comparison when SoU was announced.  
---
2 - Reborn is lazy, to me at least. It feels like one of those mechanics that the team made a LONG time ago and finally put it into the game because they had no better option at the time.
---
Invoke has a uniqueness I can appreciate, but again it's still just "Battlecry:..."
---
A tech card targets a specific strategy of a class. Like Secret Eater will be detrimental to Secret Mage but none Secret Mage can still roll with the game. Skulking Geist deals with Jade Druid but other forms such as Token can still be played.
---
This however kills every Control Warrior variant. Odd, Taunt Quest, Boom, DMH. It literally obliterates an entire archetype.
---
I had the same thought, though there are cases where the amount of damage is still important, such as if the source also has Lifesteal. I think it might help if there was some visual indicator that a minion was in the "to-be-destroyed" state after being hit by poison or another destroy effect. That state works the same as having 0 or less health, but isn't visible in-game. Maybe change the health value to a skull, or display the portrait as grey and cracked.
---
Seems like a nice pairing with Shadowy Figure &amp; Wretched Reclaimer or embalming ritual.
---
Choco#1508 Trading 80g quest on NA. I show, you go first.
---
Im not really a Warlock player, but the last few sets including DoD were horrible for the class, most of the warlock cards in recent sets felt like a mix of bad Aggro cards and meme cards (like Plot Twist)
---
Lol, if warrior isn't that popular why tech against it. It's like running secret eating to counter secret mage. You're only hurting your wr by playing that card. So you like a ton of value and A ton of stall ok. Yeah, those decks tend to play themselves, but to each their own. I prefer my games to last around 10 mins instead of 30. 
---
Anyways you still have control shaman now in this up coming set, make it as stall like as you want.
---
Just forfeit and. Keep playing
---
Odds are you won't run into another one too soon
---
It should be you remove their armor and take one damage for every 2 armor you remove, or something that counters the balance. Right now this makes the legendary that converts all health but 1 to armor utterly useless
---
Why are people complaining about the art? I've seen much uglier cards. Is it just the big head? Who cares?
---
How the hell did this battle cry make it onto a neutral common!? Poor Healadin...
---
This is so wrong. Have you actually played during KnC meta? Early iterations of Big Spell Mage used Spiteful Summoner. I played it myself, it was ok. And like every other deck, Mage used two Corridor Creepers. Since Patches was everywhere, it made sense to have two Creepers handy. Especially if you just played a board clear. Imagine playing Flamestrike or Dragon's Fury and playing a Creeper for free. That was the meta then.
---
And even though Mage did not have a class specific card that got nerfed, it was not a bad class back then. Big Spell Mage was a legit deck. With access to Arcane Artificers, Ice Blocks, and Frost Lich Jaina, it can control the board and grind out wins. And the aforementioned Dragon's Fury is was a very strong board clear. And then we have finishers like DK Jaina, Dragoncaller Alanna, and Spiteful Summoner.
---
And there was still the ever dependable Tempo Mage and Quest Mage which I shan't explain further here. Just remember that Mage was viable during the KnC meta, and more recently it was one of the most dominant classes during the Saviors of Uldum meta (and even the Rise of Shadows meta before it) thanks to the buffed Luna's Pocket Galaxy, and Conjurer's Calling. The deck (Conjurer Mage) was absolutely oppressive. That is why both LPG and CC were nerfed hard.
---
As fellow visitor of *really many* hearthstone subs, whats with all this hate/banter towards /r/customhearthstone ? Most of their posts are interesting and not overpowered, most of it's content are just cool ideas or surprise mechanics. What's wrong with all the people thinking that sub is full of OP cards? Have you ever been there?
---
Hearthen scales dinner
---
Wow, that is interesting, my fellow stoner. Well, battlegrounds are still in beta, i guess this is one of the things the devs are still working on
---
They should create this card to counter the 2k armor decks and send it straight to wild just to improve somewhat improve wild. Armor gain in there can get stupid
---
&gt; The cards are being added to the client in 3 days. They don't have time to change it and they won't change it after it's already in game.
---
I mean...how much time would changing the artwork and/or name possibly take? An hour or two tops? It's replacing a bunch of .png assets and several code lines
---
Five weeks was still an eternity for five mana Spreading Plague.
---
Honestly Armour is just fundamentally a broken design. It allows Warriors to cheat the most fundamental element of the game, that being that health has a max value. And unlike Priest Quest, they dont even have to put any effort into increasing the max value, and can exceed it by far more than 10 points. Personally, I wouldve preferred a rework of armour (make it only last 1 turn but be stronger) rather than this card, but the game certainly needed a tech card like this without said rework.
---
Card isn't even good against control warrior, control warrior decks have win conditions that dont revolve around JUST removing stuff and gaining armor. Seriously this card does not blow warrior out of the water if you draw it, nobody is putting this trash in their decks.
---
They gave legendary weapon drawing pirates for warrior, they want pirate warrior t 1 again
---
You do you OP. Dont let others gatekeep what you find cute.
---
Six mana Summoner is broken. Five mana Summoner would've been god tier.
---
 Clouter#11127  NA  , I show you go first
---
It will never invalidate more than 5 cards. It will never even invalidate 5 cards. It will invalidate the mana spent on hero powering at best, but the thing is that hero powering is effectively free for Control Warrior.
---
This effect was one of the most highly requested effects by players I don't think anyone would've predicted it would be on a neutral common with no requirement. 
---
The fact it's a dragon and there's so many dragon generation cards in the game right now is also a problem.
---
I mean... shit, man, you'd get your ass kicked for saying that around here
---
And you didn't address my argument that 3-drops should be compared to other 3-drops, not to other 2-drops, when you evaluate the power level of the card.
---
So I guess we're even, pal!
---
It WAS god tier anyway
---
The only solution is to release a Falstad Hunter hero portrait. Make it so!
---
Hot take - This guy might be good in secret paladin

They don’t understand, give them time
---
I always wondered if something like WoW's Cataclysm could ever happen in Hearthstone. Something so completely world-transforming that everyone has to react to it, whether they want to or not. 
---
I think this expansion is the closest thing we'll ever get to that kind of event.
---
with the way you pick heroes and how utterly boring some (a lot) of them are i throw most times i don't see a hero i like. the difficulty to win is more related to what you get in the shop than anything your opponents do anyway so who cares about the rank?
---
Big oof, this card will hurt
---
Outside of TBP and RR formats because of Druid and Odd Warrior, I don't think Platebreaker would be particularly useful. It really isn't right now.
---
I don't like how there's now a card that can read "**Battlecry**: Deal 10+ damage to the Enemy Hero" now, but with its limited utility and the fact it'll never kill your opponent by itself, it's at least worth trying out.
---
Good but not great.  Won't see play.
---
They gave option to Zephyrus insta kill Jaraxxus so i doubt they will do about this and Thekal.
---
No, you can't just replace a 2 mana card with a 3 mana card as if they fill the same role in a deck. They don't.
---
No but what I’m getting at is those cards are essentially “I win the game” cards (if it does what it’s intended to do) because of what you described exactly. It only really effectively works against OTK decks and if you managed to pull out a key card you’ve literally ruined their decks and all the time they put into it. Just like what this card does for Warrior.
---
Super new player here: 
---
What’s the best way to get gold? The arena is far and away the best mode yet it seems to come with an entry fee that only allows me to play it once every 2 days or so.

Molten Breath
---
To expand on this, the only Hall of Fame cards to break this rule have been [[Genn Greymane]] and [[Baku, The Mooneater]] (and their synergy cards), who were part of the Witchwood set. 
---
They were set to rotate out of standard along with Witchwood at the end of Q1 next year, but their effects were so strong and meta-warping that Blizzard pulled the trigger much sooner than anticipated. Most of the competitive decks at the time were odd or even decks, with very few "regular" decks able to compete alongside them. This is why the exception was made and unless something equally busted comes along it will remain the exception.
---
Yeah beat it
---
Ironic, giving a CW main an Anti-CW tech card.
---
so happy i quit this shit hole game. wish reddit would stop front paging this garbage.
---
I honestly don't think it's good enough to see much play.

I mean, I think the main issue is that it's winmore.
---
If a slow control deck running Doomsayer-esque cards completes the Activate the Obelisk quest, they've probably beaten their aggro opponent already, and don't need 9 more board clears.

(This would have been nice against Odd Paladin last year, though, where you did straight up need 9 board clears).

I wish I could give you an award.

The HS client is getting dated, and one of the reasons HS took off was because the client was leaps and bounds ahead of the competition of the time. If they added actual avatars for cards and attack and defense animations, they could do for HS2 what they did for OW2 and let us keep our collection.
---
That’s the equivalent to saying “most Warrior decks can still gain armor.”

Finally I can do lich king with Warrior :)

This shade is far to vivid to be chartreuse.
---
Doesn't Bad Luck Albatross being a neutral rare technically "kill" highlander effects, Skulking Giest "kill" stuff like Jade Idol, or the existence of Ooze effect "kill" legendary weapons in the same way?
---
Some cards, by accident or intention, hard counter each other. Even then, your Heal Paladin deck likely won't run into it often enough for it to be that much of an issue.
---
Yeah, I think that’s fine. As long as I get to keep my collection I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on.

Newbie here wondering exactly what cards will be phased out upon the release of the new set? Is it just the event legendaries that are in my collection, or do select standard cards get removed as well?

Also wondering about the viability of the 60 pack DoD pre purchase. Thats 300 cards, and guarenteed at least 60 rares,  but do 60 packs guarentee any legendaries or is that entirely RNG?

Where were you when Hearthstone was kill?

That is just half of board. Screenshot was made during ghost fight
---
Griftah into this + Thekal
---
Without knowing how things will really play out, the problem seems to be that they are printing so many cards that win the game if you draw it first.  Like the dragon discount card - if everyone is playing dragons, it might just come down to who can at on curve.
---
You may be missing the joke. If they have an empty board, they die as soon as they play this. They take damage when they play Zzerakbu, which summons a minion, so they take damage, which summons a minion, ... They'll fill their board and take 30 damage.
---
Oh yeah, the cyclone cheap-spell archetype needs help. Initially it was just a way to stall and increase hand size for broken Conjurer's Calling swings. And now it briefly has a cool but *super* inconsistent Flamewaker machine gun strategy.  
---
Not sure if cards like this and the sidequest can save it, but at least they're a step in the direction of using cheap spells while developing an honest board.
---
Hmm true I didnt think or that. Maybe i am just overthinking this one a little bit to much.
---
But it was more of a joke to insta nerf it anyway.
---
Just wanted to get some thoughts about that card.
---
I'm not saying that. What I am saying is you need a certain amount of dragons for that synergy to work. And you don't want the synergy to be too top heavy in your curve. So in the past, people have run Faerie Dragon as a fairly vanilla two drop to help the rest of their deck work. Having a really strong 3 drop dragon doesn't mean you replace Faerie Dragon for Bronze Explorer, but it means you can replace Faerie Dragon for a stronger non-dragon 2 drop because you have another synergy card that you would keep in your mulligan. It doesn't directly replace Faerie Dragon. It just allows you to replace it with something else because they have similar deck building roles.

&gt;	“Compared to cable rat it seems really good”
---
&gt;“Cablerat vs the guy she told you not to worry about”
---
Neither of these are “this is better than Cable Rat” and neither of these are in the comment thread we’re in. 
---
You are failing to grasp the basic concept of my argument. This card is not Cable Rat. It is not 1/1. 
---
When Mana Wyrm was nerfed to 2 mana, it didn’t get +1/2 to compensate for the 1 mana increase. This card **does have the +1/2 over Cable Rat to compensate for for mana cost _and_ it has 3 armor. That’s why we compare it.
---
Would a Cable Rat be good on turn 3? NO! And absolutely fucking no one thinks it would. Would a Cable Rat be good on turn 3 if it had +1/2 and gave 3 armor? Maybe! **And that’s why we’re comparing them!**
---
&gt; Really? No need to be condescending here, man.
---
You basically ignored what I wrote and restated what you had already said. Your comment did exude naivety, whether or not you are actually naive. If you were capable of considering the issue and answering right away, why not do it?
---
&gt; Anyways, you’re making this problem seem way more difficult than it actually is. Just have the server wait until all 8 clients have finished their battles before it starts the buy phase for anyone.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; And if Battlegrounds works anything like the rest of Hearthstone, then things like game logic and board state are handled server side anyways the instant the battle starts. All the client needs to do is say “I’ve finished playing these animations”.
---
And what about disconnects/reconnects and network issues? Do you wait for people to reconnect? If so, how long? What about people with bad machines? Do you let them delay the buy phase indefinitely? 
---
It's pleasant to just assume that everything works perfectly for everybody in all situations, but that's not the reality. I've worked on systems with coordination between servers and clients, it's not as simple as it seems to be.
---
idk if you were joking but it wouldnt work: 
---
you need to take dmg for the drake to summon, but with malganis you don't
---
It's not about making the matchups winnable - if it will be useful only in &lt;5% of the matchups, then it basically means that you're making 95% of your matchups worse by putting in a 5 mana 5/5 with no effect and no synergy with your deck.
---
You'd rather take a guaranteed loss against those decks than decrease your win rate against any other deck. You don't tech against stuff that you almost never face.
---
Free chocolate obviously has a defined cost, it's 0. It's also 0€/g, which is also a better way to calculate all of this. It would also be a better way to look at manacost per stats instead of the other way around. It's basically the whole reason why I brought the weird calculation of g/€ into play - it's a bad way to calculate things because when something is free, you get  a divison by 0. It's much better to look at €/g and then just looking at which is cheapest per g. In the same way, it's much better to look at mana/stats because vanilla stats are never 0. Then it get's much clearer why 0 mana cost minions are best, because you can never get below 0mana/stats. And within this context, you can easily argue that the stats/mana value for whisp is infinite.
---
&gt; It's not a bug, but it… goes against what the card says.
---
To me, the distinction is meaningless. I understand why this happens, because I can see Zapp hesitate before he swings. Still, if the card doesn't do what it says it does, I would classify that as bad programming, because ideally it should be programmed to do what it says. That is, just because you can explain why a bug occurs doesn't mean it's not a bug.
---
I see where you're coming from, though. Is there a term you would recommend I use besides "bug" that better describes when a card doesn't do what it says it does, despite it being technically consistent with its mechanical subtleties? (Honest question, not trying to be snarky)
---
But we have to keep a bit of the draconic origin, so maybe we change the name to something that dragons are known for; flames perhaps?
---
&gt; Yes, that you lack experience in stuff like this and think it's really that simple.
---
Except... it is. 
---
&gt; Oh, nice job ignoring the questions you don't want to acknowledge and not answering the ones you did acknowledge. You just said what is currently done, and that that is the issue! I asked how it should function, not what's wrong. It's easy to pretend things are simple when skip answering the questions that make it not so simple.
---
Dude. I didn't avoid any questions, I answered them. You asked what the game should do about disconections/bad connections. I told you that the game was already more than capable of handling those problems. Because it is. 
---
&gt; Or are you saying that people who disconnect and reconnect before others are finished should still go the store before other people? Then the problem would remain. If not you didn't answer anything.
---
I never suggested that. And I did answer your question. If somebody disconnects or times out on their connection, the automatically moves them to the buy phase. *There is no issue with disconnections or bad connections under my suggested system. The way the client handles those issues currently would work perfectly fine. No issues. None whatsoever. Get that through your thick skull.* 
---
&gt; If 7 clients have said "I'm ready" and one hasn't and is disconnected what then? Do you proceed or wait? If you wait, then how long?
---
You don't wait at all. That's what I've been saying. Disonnected clients automatically move to the buy phase, as they do currently. 
---
&gt; If 7 clients have said "I'm ready" and one hasn't and isn't disconnected do you propose to wait for it for whatever period of time it takes? Even if it takes minutes?
---
The game already has a method to handle timed out/slow connections. If the server isn't getting a response, then it moves all players to the buy phase. 
---
&gt; The proposed change introduces a novelty, the way the server would have to now coordinate with clients. The current methods aren't applicable to that new situation.
---
The server already communicates with clients in this way. 
---
Game goes "Hey, I've finished the animations." 
---
Server goes "Okay, enter buy phase." 
---
Just have the server not let players into the buy phase 
---
&gt; You can repeat yourself all you want, doesn't make it as simple as you're trying to make it out to be.
---
And it's not nearly as impossible or difficult as you're making it out to be.
---
Keleseth is crying
---
His Frostmourne is immune on his and your turns, so I doubt it.
---
Both crabs are vanilla stats and arguably better. A 1 mana 1/2 or 2 mana 2/3 that does nothing is acceptable. A 5 mana 5/5 that does nothing can really put you behind.
---
I like this card. Doubt it sees any play in constructed but it’s a really interesting card, will be fun to make meme decks with.
---
Might see some interesting interactions with corrupted bloods and bombs, both are too niche to justify putting it your deck but maybe as a discover or summon and bounce.

What's that one Priest card that's like this but 5 times worse?

Oh well,a great addition to quest druid.
---
This set is insane.

With Megasaur Tier 6 minion

How does this set stifle “a lot” of creative design? This is exactly the type of hyperbole OP is referring to.

Thinking this card will put token Druid over the top powerful

Sorry for you man, and thanks for all the great content !
---
Hey look, it's Surrender to Madness, except this time it might single-handedly create a new low-curve archetype.
---
Good strat if you are going to open lots of packs, but for those with limited packs it will be either get lucky, play shitty/boring decks or dust and craft for your deck of choice.
---
Dont cripple your launch experience by being too afraid to craft your favourite new cards.
---
what amazes me is how bad the doom cards they gave back to warlock were. yes imp gang boss is a good card, but when you look at some of the stuff the other classes got that put them on another level it's insane
---
I don't get it, is the set boring and creative or flashy ploy to win back players, pick one.
---
Super interesting card. I think it’s pretty good in dragon decks since you can run fizzle and still get the dragons discounted but with +2/2 also.
---
I didn’t even consider Malganis, so kudos. But I don’t think it’ll work. Zzeraku says when your hero takes damage. If you’re immune, you technically aren’t taking damage, so I don’t know if the interaction works.
---
Well if you deck is full of drake and you hit the new legendary that reduce their cost it's totally worth it
---
Up until this last expansion I had played Hearthstone **every single day** since the Beta released.
---
Since Brode left (not sure if it's related, but timeline-wise) this game has gone in the crapper.  There's no thoughtful design or balancing, it's just become a sort of joke game... Which I'm sure there is some kind of market for, but it sure ain't those of us who have been playing this game for years.
---
As of the last expac I committed myself to never spending another cent on Hearthstone, and it is looking like my instincts are correct.  I could be wrong, but between Battlegrounds eating away at any kind of competitive scene for the game and just IMO bad, sort of silly card design...  I think this game is nearing it's end as a legitimate eSport.
---
Not sure how to feel about this card...
---
This is the first overall expansion that will absolutely change everything. Insanity ahead
---
Only play 10 cost minions #loophole
---
Hmmmm 6 mana for 2 7/7's with rush.
---
[[Surrender to Madness]]
---
This card is fine because it's a tech card... just like weapon hate, it doesn't perform well against all classes and decks. Warrior and Druid can still gain more armor after you played this.
---
That said, the way this completely destroys Thekal is really dumb. I'm having fun with a tier 3 at best Thekal + Giant / Anyfin can Happen gimmicky deck in Wild and if this card sees play, the fun but really not that good or consistent Thekal combo just dies.
---
I still laugh that Surrender to Madness was one of the first card showcased in Rastakhan’s rumble and was even featured AGAIN during the reveal stream. 
---
Surrender to Madness was so bad on the livestream that it made the Hunter spirit look OP.

3/-/- | Destroy 3 of your Mana Crystals. Give all minions in your deck +2/+2.

Not really. In the early game the cost increase will matter and in the late game this does too little. It's definitely weaker then Keleseth, even if you play it on turn 1.
---
Bro, I've been waiting so long for this quest to be good, using a Leeroy version of it. My body is ready and Barnabus is coming!
---
THEY ACTUALLY DID IT. THE MAD MEN
---
Damn you guys are fast
---
I don't think this is very good in an aggro deck like Token Druid because it slows down the gameplan, it's better in a midrange deck.

you are quick

don't they need double the evokes for their boy or am i mixing things up?

Handbuff? No, too cool for that.

Yeah, but do they want to play a 5 mana 3/5 to get two spells when they can play a 2 mana 2/2 and get six?

The design is stifled not by the card's design but by the card's power level. Renounce Darkness is interesting, but Evolve is good. Guess which card saw play in the latest event?
---
sure is. But what it represents?

Today I was playing druid against a shaman, and I was winning, and by bad luck my WiFi went off and I immediately changed to data, and I lost 2 turns in total as the first turn was lost due to the disconnect and second was the rope, and then I got back he had taunts and shit, but still I won

&gt; This is 100% a different card game then it was 4 expansions ago. the game as a whole. 
---
Year of the Dragon, especially Saviors of Uldum and Descent of Dragons, have been more of a return to form for Hearthstone than anything. Year of the Raven and its sets are kind of the odd man out in terms of things like power level.
---
We have the embiggest minions, of anywhere, perhaps in the history of Azeroth!

Livewire Lance, EVIL Totem, Sludge Slurper, EVIL Miscreant, EVIL Genius

There's only EVIL cable rat and no other neutral generators so what's the "majority" that aren't better? Improve Morale?
---
sure it is, but what it represents?
---
Not because this card
---
Dude, this card just singlehandedly deleted any control variant of druid or warrior from wild. Forever. Fs in the chat for wild druids and warriors. Their revenge will be in the form of relentless aggro variants.
---
3 less mana and kinda like destroying 1 mana crystal instead of 3.
---
By releasing dragons and Galakrond cards that are super strong, you a set a bar really high for how strong a card has to be to see play. An interesting/creative card won't see play if it doesn't compete with the good cards.
---
people are just ignoring the "if your're holding a dragon" part
---
The problem is that it creates bad precedent.  Should Morgl, a purely aesthetic hero skin, be killed by Hungry Crab because it is a murloc?  The only reason why Jaraxxus is allowed is because he is technically a minion replacing the hero, and thus he keeps his tag.
---
make it so the tech card can't have started in your deck, or just make a minion with a battlecry that you choose from a pool of common tech battlecries (let's say it's a pool of 8 that shows 4), or it can act like zephyrs and just know which you'd want, although with that battlecry it'd be played in everything. 
---
as for the pool, I'm thinking an ooze effect, a secret killing effect, a healing effect, a skulking geist effect, etc.
---
Ah fair enough. I was thinking it would work for some reason but I didn’t think about that:/ dammit. Would’ve been cool. I wasn’t joking or anything though. I wanna try it out!
---
[[Surrender to Madness]] not only costs 3 the turn you play it, but it costs a minimum of 6 in reality (and a hell of a lot more if played before turn 10 — on turn 3 it costs you a whopping 18 mana!). This is, of course, factoring in all the lost mana from destroying your mana crystals.
---
This...doesn’t do that. This is a zero cost spell (!) that doesn’t destroy your mana crystals...because it increases the cost of the minions affected by 1?
---
Oh, and if a minion costs 10 mana this has no drawback.
---
I reeeeally wanna overreact to this card because this seems insane. But I'll force myself to actually wait and see how it turns out.
---
Dammit Blizz, you blew up the roof with that power level.
---
Token druid relies on token generators and this card will not affect them.
---
Yeah I realized:( I still wanna try it though it would be pretty cool!
---
My guts tell me not to pass judgement on a game I can't afford to play
---
Would this discount a molten giant's base cost to 10?
---
They like to come up with crazy swingy card designs.
---
From what I can see, it doesn’t exist
---
This, at least in part. 2 mana Wild growth being evergreen limits the ramp spells and payoffs they can print in an expansion. I don't think it is a coincidence that Breath of Dreams was designed when wild growth got nerfed.
---
Also, it is a dragon synergy card. So, it might not see play if dragon druid is just a worse quest druid.

True, but if you're running this in a Savage Roar type of deck, that's all you really need. Or you can rebuff it with the 2 mana spell or the Twinspell.

---
I thought the same, treants arent strong enough to challenge the board in the early/mid game and in the late game a +1/+1 is not that impactful. Doesnt seem competetive to me, especially not against the powerlevels of the other revealed cards.
---
And I still laugh that people still play this game. Laughter all around!
---
Exactly, much rather run the 14-14 6 mana oasis surge
---
Everyone's pointing out how to use this as a tech card, but here's another way to use it: The only neutrals you put in your deck are 1- and 2-drops that you mulligan for. Then, when you draw this, you get to reroll the cheap cards that didn't start in your opening hand into something bigger.
---
It's kind of like a much worse version of [[Prince Liam]], which already didn't really see play.
---
I like the price point and content of bundles like these.

Great catch up mechanic with a unique hero.

Yeah uncluding DoD would have been awesome but 6 packs won't make a big difference anyway. It'll be included in the next few bundles instead.

Nail on the head. Been following this sub since launch, and every expansion without fail, the prevailing opinions on this sub are on one extreme or the other. It's a very old example, but ever since the Trogg vs Boom predictions, I've been hesitant to give much credit to the predictions here.

WOW

FUNNY AND ORIGINAL OBSERVATION

HOLY FUCK THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY AND ORIGNAL HAHAHA

30 packs with 0 Descent of Dragons packs.. kinda wish a few were tossed in

---
At first we didnt have any for free, we had to pay 10$ and they didnt come with any packs.
---
And then they added some ways to get some for free, and others trough bundles and preorders.
---
I dont think having this hero behind a bundle is thaaaat bad.
---
Idk why people downvoted you for explaining why you thought that. But yeah it's just a visual bug
---
This guy is lying, you can remove one card from standard much quicker than that.
---
Yeah as someone who has played a lot of token Druid this card might be exactly what the archetype needed. Your current treants will get +1/+1 as well as any you get from soul of the forest deathrattles and the ones from Forest’s Aid on 8. Those deathrattles will also no longer die to Shaman’s earthquake if this comes down first. It might be a slow card but it prevents token Druid from always losing in the late game.
---
Change it to Storm Crossbow and we gucci

Is this the designated meme card of the set?

Take a look at the newly revealed treant support cards.

I tested it. Dream cards doesn't work with quest, weapon and Tess but Death knight cards work. I still don't know why they don't count.

The Grand Tournament is an example of quitting. Joust just needed more card support, and since that era greedy Big Card decks have consistently been viable... Guess who'd be able to utilize Joust?
---
"One shot, one kill"
---
It's a good idea in theory, but you'll more than likely just kill yourself with this if you arent at full health.
---
Why would you play such a minor card in Quest Druid? To have the option to play a 2/2 on turn 2? Having both effects combined feels super minor.
---
Other classes can get armour, albeit less reliably, but cards like crystalliser are neutral and thekal is for paladin.
---
MFW i'm the moon from Majora's Mask but i'm not angry anymore :-)
---
Nice, best I had was similar, Golden Voidlord, Gold Mal’Ganis, tiny bubbled poisonous amalgam, and some other things I can’t remember. Don’t remember what I placed, I think 5th but it was fun.
---
Adam Schiff face
---
That’s not a bad thought for sure. I actually kind of like the card for that purpose.
---
So far I've beaten every heroic wing with every explorer, some more than once (doing anomalies now). There are some tough bosses and there are some oppressively tough bosses (Lookin at you, Dust Devil lady).
---
This guy is not challenging in the least. He's just dumb. If you have the kind of deck that can't kill him before he finds his weapon, then tough luck, you've just added at least 20 minutes to your run waiting for him to fatigue out. Which is made even worse by the fact that he runs Academic Espionage.
---
This is how I play still. I haven’t kept up with the expansions so I just play on casual and keep to the decks I know. The classic Zoolock deck is one of my favorites and it still holds up pretty well against some of these new cards
---
Badum dum dumdum dumdum dum DA DA
---
dundundun dun da
---
Eveything you’re talking about assumes that 
---
1. The Warrior has full health under their armor. 
---
2. The game doesn’t go to fatigue. 
---
Control Warrior has always been about dragging the game out as long as possible into fatigue, in a deck with very few or in some cases no actual win condition other than that. Their strongest tool in the late game is their armor gain because of that. 
---
Mind you, I’m not even saying this card will be good. In fact I doubt it will ever even see legitimate play unless the Linecracker/Bees combo in Wild somehow becomes Tier S. 
---
But it doesn’t need to be powerful or see play to be a bad design that sets a bad precedent.
---
The biggest flex on ancient of war.
---
I wish they'd make the old Christmas lights Winter Veil cardback available for those who didn't play hearthstone then.
---
MFW I went through your whole panties drawer ;-)
---
Huh.  Well that won't have any affect with this card, except for edge cases, but that seems odd given their appearances.  It should be fixed.
---
I'll take "What r/hearthstone says will happen with every expansion" for $200, Alex
---
Exact reason I placed second, my Foe Reaper hit AFKay’s other divine shield taunt minion, and her amalgam just slapped my boi. If I hit the Amalgam, I would’ve won but second is okay.
---
They spelled that stupidly then. Its more of a casino mode than any others. Also minions only isn't exactly a good "substitute".
---
Keep in mind that token decks generally use if their board gets cleared by aoes and they run out of gas. This together with floop and elise allows you , in a few setup turns,to get 4 board fills woth 5/5s / 6/6s which is huge against slower control decks. Even without elise, later on in the game he plays on curve with your twin spell to make them 3/3s and because you use more spells to generate treants at this point floop has a very high chance togive you another +1/+1 later down the line. Does this sound OP? by all means no. But it is a combo that allows druid to have 4 Nomis before their deck is empty which is a good game finisher
---
But I'm not.
---
Trading 80g questo on EU, YOU go first. chupeee#2659
---
I'll pass on this one, thanks. The majority of the packs are for expansions that will rotate out soon. Uninteresting hero. I don't care about card backs. Not for me I guess.
---
I get your point, but in my country we earn something close to 220 usd at minimum wage, and in that position i would spend 5 bucks, but 25 it's too much.
---
Assuming your junkbots and barons  are buffed and maexxna isnt. Sure. And assuming your unbuffed maexxna doesn't get sniped by some other mid-life level minion.
---
Taurens and Forsaken both need love. HS team plays Alliance confirmed.
---
Just search google for this image and you'l see.
---
There might be future late game token support. Treant druid is at least tier 3 so its a legitimate deck. You can't have every legendary be crucial for every top tier deck because that makes it the game too expensive. And their won't ever be more then a handful of top tier decks. So i prefer they have a legendary for a top deck and another to try to buff lower tier decks, make new decks, or set up for future good decks.        
---
It could have been a lower cost  and there isn't much new support for treant druid, but there is a fine line between an aggro deck being ok or overpowered. Maybe 6 mana 4/8 would be more helpful. But then again i'd rather not risk an aggro deck with strong early game, repetitive board refills, and a constant looming threat of a finisher (savage roar) being overpowered because it will destroy every other deck.
---
As if High Priest Thekal was doing anything anyway.
---
Even then, as long as your Heal Paladin deck isn't as prolific Shaman is right now, people aren't going to be playing it.
---
Plus, Skulking Giest and Chief Inspector didn't do much to make Jade Druid and Secret Hunter unplayable. Murlocs are have an evergreen tech card, that's done nothing to stop Murloc decks from reaching tier one repeatedly.
---
A tech card has never outright killed the deck(s) or card(s) its useful against because they're all highly conditional and next to useless outside of match-ups they're applicable in.
---
KnC was similarly busted
---
People argue that it's a missable, and not in the holyday spirits, we regulars just get a pack like normal instead.
---
Yes, the points you are raising are absolutely correct, and I feel naive &amp; idiotic for taking this long to realize them. You’ve expressed the vague thoughts I’m sharing much more fully &amp; coherently. 
---
&gt;Second, you don't get to see what the other side looks like when it is in a mirror match-up, you only see what Aggro does to you the Control player.
---
I think that’s the big crucial factor. It was only through experiencing that range of gameplay for myself when it finally “clicked”.

In regards to the last passage in regards to the relative lack of skill needed for Hearthstone, you’re also of course dead on the money, haha. I don’t suspect it’s particularly “harsh” though. Surely nobody has big delusions of the skill required for Hearthstone being comparable to that of Starcraft, or even another card game like MTG.   
---
But I think it’s still meaningful to discuss the skill required on its own terms, in the context of Hearthstone in a vacuum. There is a reason, after all, why some long term players routinely reach high Legend, while other long term players have never gone beyond rank 5.
---
You guys can “make fun” of me all you want, but if you think increased power level of dragons in a dragon themed expansions stifles future design by “a lot” with the only excuse being “power levels”, you have a lot to learn about this game.
---
Bombs didn't invalidate Highlander decks.
---
Yeah that happens occasionally, it doesn't matter the outcome of that last fight though, you are guaranteed first place if you are the last surviving player.
---
It's all based on the ratings of your opponents, and given how little rank you lost, the system expected you to come in fourth.
---
$15..mayyybeeee..
---
$25.. nope
---
No

But [[Mecha'Thun]] or [[The Four Horsemen]] still destroys the enemy minion if they are immune...
---
Quest druid will still be one of the best late game decks. Instead of nomi they potentially run the new alex and ysera and a couple more dragons for emerald breath. Hard to say, but I think druid will be fine.

10/10/10 Mech | Deathrattle: If you have no cards in your deck, hand, and battlefield, destroy the enemy hero.  
---
How would this affect Mountain Giants and such? Will it be 13 Mana? Or reduced to 10 Mana cause "Up to 10"
---
Check out rank 25
---
Forever.
---
Fine but its weird to just come back to the previous meta. Why was decided they would be gone the 5th? Or is it because people wanted evolve and Nzoth removed?
---
Priest is by far my most played class. I understand how you feel. I also lament how it has turned into being centered around Resurrection mechanics. It’s just not a mechanic that’s meaningfully similar to what I first fell in love with about Priest.
---
I just feel bad for people that are gonna pull a legendary day one with a 4 month life span

Denied.
---
All this news about Tyrande is good and all but the only portrait I am missing is Khadgar and I really want it too but so far I am pretty sure only China got a second chance at him.
---
I'll always play Lunara as druid. "I appreciate your efforts" is the best druid BM by far.
---
(THEY’RE DENIED)
---
No quests? Special Tavern Brawls? Just a card back?
---
Also since I started playing I've seen 2 new druid heroes (outside of 1k wins ones) and 0 hunter, mage, or rogue, yet the game needs a third new druid hero when hunter has literally only 3 including the 1k, and rogue has 4?
---
I really hope the opportunity shows for you friend! :)
---
So what? From the reversed point of view: you still have to pay at least 10$ for a hero, except now you also pay more for the packs (although at very attractive price compared to regular one).
---
From the usual point of view: you get hero added for free if you spend 25$ on packs, but that doesn't change the fact that you can't spend less than 25$ (even if you get something of equal value alongside it).
---
Let's do a metaphor: You want to buy a carton for milk. I offer you to sell a carton of milk for 10$. "Well, that's ridiculous" you say. So I say in response "You know what? Cars are super useful. I'll sell you this car for 2000$ although it's worth 4000$! And if you buy it, you get this milk for free." You can't deny it's a good deal for the car, you can't deny that cars are useful but it's still a shitty deal if all you want is a carton of milk.
---
"Nah, we love the horde" *adds another orc*
---
Can you give at least a little information about snip snap warlock deck  in wild ?
---
I understand why your brain would forget Culumo-Maximus as a coping mechanism, but it's time to face the truth. That card exists.
---
I love him.
---
[[Dendrologist]] finally happy.
---
That is such a miniscule portion of the player base its not even worth actually saying.

2/2/3 | Battlecry: If you control a Treant, Discover a spell.  
---
Are you seriously saying that 30 packs and a hero for $25 is a bad deal?
---
That’s a dumb take, man. “It only took them years to get to it, but now it’s here so let’s forget that it took so fucking long”
---
shows how stupid the doom in the tomb was. Funny how emperor and rag were both fine but evolve and n'zoth broke the game
---
Skulking Geist completely ruined literally all 1-cost spells
---
lol
---
I’m crying because this card title feels like a meme, CustomHearthstone title.
---
Yup. It’s rare, but it happens.
---
&gt; If you’re feeling in the spirit of gift-giving, give us money!
---
OHH I know!
---
L-Teddy is my favorite fortnite streamer
---
I'm assuming it's because Ysera was made during a time when burgle mechanics weren't a thing in rogue yet and there weren't any cards requiring you to have cards from other classes (in case of Lich King they likely already had an effect like Tess' planned since they plan cards 3 expansions ahead of time)
---
&gt; No one is going to run that card for the .001% chance to ruin a Thekal Paladin's day.
---
You underestimate my pettiness.
---
Super weird devision to make everyone change their decks for 5 days. This should have been done 2 weeks ago or just wait 5 more days until the release of the expert.
---
Big oof. Top 200 is gonna be impossible...
---
Use my strat even tough its more time consuming.
---
Type Extra in the search bar, manually DE the cards that are not OP. I DE that way because i had extra copies of Conjuring call (the 3 coat at the time that aummon 2 copies of the same cost). And it has paid off more times than not. And its just time consumming the first time after an expac!
---
If he can't figure out how to beat something it goes on to his nerf list so that he is no longer the problem, it is the "OP Cards" that beat him which are the problem.
---
The great thing is, since it won't be nerfed since it isn't OP, he will never have to realize that he is the problem... ah who am I kidding even if it were nerfed he would non-ironically just start complaining about the next card down on his list and add another to the bottom.
---
Honestly, I had way more fun playing with the broken cards of Ungoro, Frozen Throne and K&amp;C cards because they were broken. The last expansions have never been so boring. Every deck is either cheap aggro or extremely expensive control/otk decks, and you can count them all on two hands
---
Any news on the glitch that crashes the game for iOS when trying to buy solo adventures?
---
 &gt; Yogg
---
Wait...
---
No, for people lacking cards it's an aggressively bad bundle. 18 of the packs are rotating out in ~3-5 months, and they are relatively weak expansions so the chance of opening the strong cards that see play is slim. So it's $25 for 12 packs (none of the recent, power creeped to hell expansion), a tree hero, and 18 packs of dust or disappointment.
---
People lacking cards would be better served just buying plain Dragon's Descent packs with their money.
---
/s...
---
Think about it, if everything is op, nothing is op
---
Emersome Bigguns?
---
Random old ass packs and some stupid skin when we used to EARN hero skins? YES.
---
I value cosmetics at nothing if you just buy them, there's nothing special, nothing to show off.
---
30 new packs is a good deal.  30 old packs is a hard pass.
---
Packs that will be out of rotation very soon and no of the new set packs? Yeah. I wouldn’t buy it. And I won’t lol.
---
Fucking finally.
---
Yo dog! I heard you like tech cards, so I got you a tech card for your tech cards so you can tech your tech cards while teching your cards.
---
Why? They're all the same exact minion with the same stats. They're different from actual tribes.
---
They can do a few cards or even bring back a set but only for a much shorter time.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dz9qb0/if_everything_is_broken_nothing_is_broken_is_wrong/
---
Cause the curator must have sold it and it then goes back into the pool of minions everyone is choosing from. Just my guess tho. Pretty sure it works that way.
---
1 mana 2/2 ?

1/2/2 Beast  
---
Maybe if Hearthstone actually had a sideboard, a lot of cool cards like these would see play.
---
makes me wonder if this works well with choose one.
---
Need I mention how many times I accidentally sold a minion when I was just trying to lose hand focus to buy more stuff...
---
I sort of agree here - magnetize with cheap mechs could be nasty... but it will definitely be a niche deck and probably not tier 1.
---
Goru seems like dogshit
---
I immediately think of the Simpsons.

Begone to the Shadow Realm, Insidious Indulgent
---
Feel free to point them out because I honestly can't think of 10 cards in the Year of the Raven that were close to as cool as what we got in other Standard cycles.
---
ITT people forget how tech cards work and severely overestimate the value of a 5 mana 5/5.
---
so, will this work with the mana treants or will this mechanic still be inconsistent?
---
dec 10th
---
Pfft. They'll add anything these days just to get a little bit of attention.
---
And a bad  hero skin! And packs that rotate in 3 months!
---
I get why they've never seen the light of day, it's because a constant effect is hard to balance. But maybe one day we'll see something of a similar effect.
---
It literally won against spellhunter full stop
---
Literally the unplayable
---
Ah yes! Because treats (based on trees) would never look alike, that would just make sense
---
Playing a 1 mana 1/2 at some point in the game will at most cost you a card. Playing a 6 mana 4/6 at any point could straight up lose you the game unless you were already winning, especially in Wild.
---
That's what we asked for for years - discount bundles on older packs.
---
Oh yeah you’re right
---
I rather call it Dynamax /s
---
That's because the Standard one are completely separate cards I noticed this because I have two Golden Evolves and a Golden N'noth, and I can't use either in standard. If you own the originals and go into your collection in wild you'll see you have two sets of each. One that's craftable/disenchantable and one that's not.
---
could we keep the cards tho ? pls pls pls
---
Then don't play it? Both cards cost a card in there non-ideal forms, gheist cause it sits in your hand, crab because it does nothing on the field.
---
Oh god pure RNG cancer card. No wonder we all playing battlegrounds.
---
lol thought about coming back after the HK fiasco but it looks like they're still shitting on this game
---
I had a big long post typed up on my phone but my wifi dropped out the instant I submitted it and I lost everything... so here I go on a computer this time. 
---
The Death Knights are probably the most influential and strong group of cards this game has ever had, with only Baku and Genn even coming close. The Death Knights straight up changed how people played the game for their duration in Standard, and continue to do so in Wild. Every single one saw legitimate competitive play except for Garrosh and Thrall, who were both core cards in popular tier 3/casual decks. 
---
Anduin was the main card that made Raza Priest work, which for months was the undisputed top deck in Standard *and Wild.* Even after its nerfs, it's still a decent tier 2 deck in Wild in a meta that should be really unfavorable for it. He was also core in Mind Blast Priest, which was a very popular meta choice for a while. 
---
Gul'dan will be played in every non-Zoo Warlock deck until this game's servers shut down. And maybe some aggro decks too, seeing as he was good enough that people were putting a 10 mana card into aggro decks. 
---
Malfurion was a core card in literally every non-aggro Druid deck except Taunt Druid for the duration of the time he was in Standard. Wild is the same deal, except he isn't used in Quest Druid for obvious reasons. 
---
Valeera was a core card in Quest Rogue's latter incarnations, Kingsbane Rogue, and continues to see play in Mill Rogue variants in Wild. 
---
Rexxar basically propped up the entire Hunter class during his time in Standard, to the point where players were legitimately worried about what the class would do after he was gone. 
---
Jaina is basically the ultimate control card that ends games when she comes down. She never made any huge splashes in Standard, but was a constant tier 2 contender and has more than made a home for herself in Wild. 
---
Ultimate Infestation and Spreading Plague were unbelievably powerful, and were run in non-Zoo Druid decks until their rotation. People are still to this day asking for nerfs to UI. 
---
Bonemare, had it not been nerfed, would likely have been run in basically every tempo/aggro deck until rotation. I shudder to think about what might have happened had that card stayed as is until Baku came around. 
---
Defile is a busted-ass card that has been run in almost every non-aggro Warlock deck since its release. It's a stupid card, and part of the reason Cubelock, and Giantlock were such powerful decks. 
---
Eternal Servitude, Shadow Essence, Spirit Lash, and Obsidian Statue elevated Big Priest from bad meme status to one of the most hated decks in the game. They still enabled dumb shit in the Resurrect Priest deck that became very popular after Boomsday. 
---
Hadronox is the card that basically made Taunt Druid a thing. That deck was everywhere for ages, and it wouldn't even exist without Hadronox. 
---
Keleseth was a busted highroll card that saw play in tons of tempo/aggro decks during his time in Standard, and even some other decks like Cube Hunter and Spiteful Druid. 
---
Saronite Chain Gang saw an incredible amount of play in literally every deck archetype in the game. Combo, Control, Aggro, and Tempo decks all ran it. 
---
Lich King is the Lich King.
---
Cool, but turn 7?
---
Yup, getting khadgar can lead to some hilarious golden token plays.
---
OTS official track sound
---
I had like 6 copies of Carnivorous Cube saved up because I was so sure it would get nerfed at some point.
---
Yeah, that never happened. Not salty about it or anything.
---
I mean yes, but money.
---
I'm not really seeing anywhere it being T2, it seems maybe it was T2 in the first week or two when things were being figured out but dropped off to T3 or just not played rather fast.
---
Don't get me wrong, if it has S tier emotes for BM I'm still buying it
---
GOT THIRD 
---
Fucking quality editing lol
---
Shaka, his eyes open.
---
Why is it when trees have arms it's always two.
---
I'd be so much more excited about alt heroes if they had alt hero power art. Tyrande is one of the worst when it comes to the hero power art and portrait art clashing.
---
Al'Akir has an upstairs comma because the wind blew it
---
The better question, why did you buy it? Lol jk
---
It is the difference between if you would refer to that entity as only the description. It becomes more obvious if an entity has multiple nicknames. 
---
So lets take a god from DnD with a lot of nicknames, Tharizdun. He might introduce himself in a few ways were he to contact you before murdering you in horrible ways.
---
He could say, "It is I Tharizdun the Dark God!" Dark God is just a description of what he is like Ragnaros the Firelord, even if you didn't know who that was you'd be like "oh no a dark god this can't be good!"
---
or he might say "I am Thrazidun, He of Eternal Darkness, the Undoer, the Black Sun, the Patient One" And you'd be like "It can't be!" because you have heard at least one of these nicknames before
---
What he would not say is "I am the Dark God!" because you would say, "which one bro there are like six dark gods."
---
In the case of Hakkar, he was know as the Soulflayer to his enemies and Hakkar to his worshippers. So soulflayer is specific enough.
---
You even have time until the expansion **IS** **live** on dec 10th (usually 7pm in eu)
---
bro 😎💪
---
&gt;Very conditional
---
theres... Not a condition. Not even having to play the card! No aggro deck would run like, a 5 mana unconditional board clear, that doesn't make it not OP as fuck in control decks.
---
Worth it over another brawl? Uhhh your still running both brawls, that wasn't a question. and the effect isn't 5 mana. The effect is zero mana, draw a card, it's start of game.
---
And if you happen to see this, well played. We traded victories down to 1-1 and my clutch extra divine shield flipped it that last time!
---
Randotron
---
Losing 3 crystals you still have 3 less mana Every turn though, No matter the amount of minions you Play. So you would have to play an insane amount of minions for it to be worse. Also surrender to madness had an upfront cost.
---
Blizzard also understands people love exclusively. For example, the preoder Widowmaker skin for Overwatch will never, ever be available again. They specifically said they want those who got it when they could to feel special.
---
OW also has a ton of skins though, so missing one isn't the end of the world. If HS pushed out more skins, then missing one wouldn't feel as bad but still feel exclusive for those who got it. I'd be fine if they never brought Khadgar back but gave us like 5 more mage skins.
---
why does this cost 0 mana?
---
Alex
---
No i didn't, I think you misunderstood

Hi
