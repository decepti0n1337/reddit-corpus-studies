I swear, I just started playing this game recently and seeing stuff like this confuses and concerns me
---

---
Mindbreakers effect is disabled in solo mode because bosses are mostly built around their hero powers
---
The only thing HoFing Leeroy would do is shift the anger from it to Reckless Rocketeer.
---
So I think I should make the question easier for you to answer, it was kinda hard.
---

---
You just asked if you could buy the website (with more private stuff of course) after the announcement that the website will be closed? If before, may I ask when? That's basicly the most interesting question imo.
---
If you only want to play in standard mode, which uses only recent collection cards, you can make dust cards from older collections that do not enter this mode.
---
I would love to see a Diablo-themed dungeon run that you can run one month out of the year with Diablo themed treasures and encounters. Toggwaggle misuses "shiny" and opens a portal to Greed's Domain. Play through an 8 boss run with passive treasures like Witchdoctor's Totem that adds a random "Frog" spell to your hand at the end of each turn and Barbarian's Fury that gives your hero +1 attack and Windfury on your turn, as well as powerful playable treasures like Azurewrath that casts Blizzard with every swing of the weapon.

A throwback would have been before tink was nerfed...and it wasn't random minions.

Amazing! Totally original, totally not a repost, well done! Great job!

I thought resurrect priest was super fun when hunter got boring.

Warlock with Arch-Villain rafaam is also fun because of the randomness Rafaam creates.

Thanks for your remarks! I chose Thalnos for some extra draw and a slight synergy with Holy Smite and Mind Blast, but actually both him and Cloning Device are there for lack of better options. Do you have any suggestions?

About Mind Blast, I often use it as a finisher with Vargoth for a huge burst, but I would gladly try something different!

---
No. Cheating out big minions early is very fun, just not for the opposing player.
---
The primary thing that making Summoner Mage as much of a pain to play against is the lack of efficient answers in relevant classes at the moment.
---
Granted, if the only reason why you don't like the deck and the cards it plays right now is that its strong against Control, the archetype currently able to stretch games out to forty minutes or more and make it so nothing an aggressive deck plays sticks, then that *is* the whole reason why we need a good counter to control.
---
Assuming this is somehow serious:
---
\- Midrange Hunter or Bomb Hunter?
---
\- Pogo or Shaman?

Cut all the cards, then let the game autofill. I don't think we can salvage this.

&gt;why would I want to destroy my own minions???

Only if you primarily play Wild. :)

---
üëç nice!
---
Fuck I keep microagressing
---
Sure, stats are dependent on those who submit them but that's the nature of statistics, they can have several contributing factors to them, however, I think this post draws the correct conclusions from them....
---
The mull winrate of Boom being higher than two really good one drops, for example, shows just how powerful Boom is, as the post says...
---
Similarly, Edwin is a conditional card, you can argue that SI is op, since you only have to play one card for the effect....
---
A 4/3/3 that deals 2 damage on play is better than a 4/4/4, compare phoenix to a 4/4, Fire Plume Phoenix would be better in most cases, as the fast 2 damage can be powerful tempo swing, and it's the same on turn 3, you can often kill a two drop or something like a Flame Imp. However, Edwin has a risk aspect, which is playing cards to activate the effect.  If Edwin dies immediately, you lose much of the value from the combo cards, which can often lose you games. Do you remember when Savjz dumped his whole hand for a quick Edwin? If the opponent played Naturalise, he would've been basically guaranteed to lose. That's the risk you run when playing big Edwins. And yes, you can argue that certain cards mitigate that risk, including the likes of Raiding Party and Evil Miscreant, which can easily combo into a big Edwin, however, those two cards were already overpowered without Edwin, and both were, and at least in the case of Evil Miscreant, still are very powerful cards, in terms of value and tempo. Rogue's ability to play many cards in a turn is what makes Edwin powerful, yet, his power comes at a cost, and you often can lose the game if he dies. A good way to think of Edwin is: 3 mana 2/2, Choose cards in your hand to discard, gain +2/+2 for each. Yes, the cards can have value, but they are often used in a less beneficial way than usual, to get those stats on Edwin, a risk players have to calculate. And players that play into, let's say, Backstab Edwin, made a poor judgement or took a risk themselves and got punished, similar to how Edwin may get punished by cards like Polymorph or Hex

but grave horror is a big reason why conjurer is so good , because you can  actually beat aggro matchups because of that taunt.

Yea, and i use it that way too but I was in a tough position there where i really needed to kill that 14/14 minion and bloodlust with 6 minions (4 of which were naturally 0 attack) would have done it. I had plenty of cards along with scargil and the echo 2/2 murloc so  killing that 14/14 was pivotal.

Yeah, my pirate deathrattle Rogue also does well on rank 25
---
That makes sense. I‚Äôll keep that in mind!
---
Or if doing some sort of indexing of cards/abilities, warrior could be the first class, HP being the first item of the first class, and null or error values get given a default value of 0.

Wow, that's something else.

itd be most accurate to call them "Board-Focused Combo Decks" but we're all obsessed with using terms that don't fit properly (HS has attackers advantage compared to MTGs Defenders advantage and it makes deck archetypes build and function very differently). And it often kills people who do nothing for 6 turns straight so it must be aggro.

I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs a bug or not, but if you just go afk, then the game will tell you ‚Äúoops, you‚Äôve been afk‚Äù, after- you restart your pc and only then open the game  and, the most important part, hs will try to reconnect you, but there‚Äôll be an exit button. You hit it. ‚ÄúUnable to reconnect to your game‚Äù. You‚Äôve got another try. Did that once, pretty sure that works okay
---
Those hero portraits are not part of the reward for beating the content. They are exclusive for the content itself. 
---
The only reward from beating heroic is the Aluneth Card Back.
---
They are R5 viable, yeah. Not great, but not terrible either.
---
Based on what you said, I'd say this is a bug 100%
---
I don't think that's how it works. Any card you play would just repeat 6 additional times (7 casts total).
---
Why would it be a factorial?
---
Again, this work is unreal. The amount of time and materials that must have went into this...
---
You are in pretty thick layers in the video there, BTW. Is this being filmed in a cold store?

I mean if you look at the *immediate* cost of playing OD, it does really seem unfair. 4 mana 4/5 that kills a minion and has rush(with Boom). Practically, it can kill any minion in the game with just 4 mana. Now, it would seem something is off. Why should a 4 mana *minion*(spell is a different story) has an ability to kill, say, Ragnaros with such ease?(This is a lore talk but I think it is relevant.) Because it is an Omega? Maybe however other Omegas are different in that they don‚Äôt have such an immediate effect on the board and some do need other cards to synergies with. But OD is self-contained and thus is more powerful than his peers‚Äî the other Omegas. So being an Omega might justify having big effect but what justify OD being more powerful than his peers demands an answer. And that let me conclude that the design of OD is bad. Overall in the meta, OD might be bad but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the card is not unfair. The card need more justification for its power or it should be nerfed down. Removing the Mech tag might help but that, I think, is more of a practical solution: it (supposedly) will help balance the meta but the card can remain unfair.
---
Side note: I agree with you a lot. However I‚Äôm generally skeptical of statistics. I know this post does not suppose to be conclusive. But I would want to know what can and cannot be inferred from the numbers before jumping to conclusions.
---
Side note 2:BGH of course can kill Rag with ease too but I‚Äôm talking about power-level and I think everyone would agree that OD is more powerful than BGH(bc of BGH‚Äôs conditions and stats)
---
Quest rogue was nerfed because it pushed slow decks out of the meta and polariced it, basically every deck had to be fast enough to beat it or have some boarclears that could clear 5/5s (brawl and pyro equality being the main options here).
---
The deck had sub50 winrate but most control decks were worse except taunt warrior (that also was great against all the other aggro decks like pirate warrior and token shaman, like odd warrior was before as the anti aggro deck) and maybe control palladin (but it wasnt that good and mainly got good after the rogue berfs, but things like pyro+equality and tarim helped it a lot).
---
It wasnt only nerfed because it felt bad. Thats just some circlejerk. It was nerfed because it was bad for the meta despite a, sub50 winrate due to the meta being forced to be mainly aggro because of quest rogue being a really really popular deck.
---
The second nerf also came for this exact same reason.

At least one does: [[Competitive Spirit]]

I mean, team5 nerfed cards that feel bad to play against in the past, so...
---
Hello !
---
I haven't played in a while, I quit just when they started retiring cards.
---
I came back because a friend told me all of my old "retired" cards would be re-imbursed as dust. 
---
Is that process automatic ?
---
Posting from the States myself, but I feel your pain; last time they did this, the only time slots were from, like, 9 PM to 6 AM my time, or something ludicrous like that. Needless to say, it wasn't fun (and a lot of that time was actually me sleeping...)  
---
Sadly, I can't come up with a solution that's simultaneously convenient for everyone in all time zones while also having the show be "live", apart from having the people competing play it once for real and then, while staying awake, replaying through every match with the same card draws and plays all the way through, multiple times.
---
Here's hoping it'll be a great time for your time zone the next time one of these deals swings around, though! I'm gonna enjoy the reprieve this time, personally, but I also kinda hate that it's an "It's inconvenient for everyone except the hosting region, and that's good enough for us at Blizzard!" scenario.
---
And also what do you want to draw as 1 attack creatures in it? They only play 2 Righteous and Patches. And no it's better to put pirate package then build around crystology in this type of deck.
---
That's not what odds means. Pity timer is not relevant.
---
Well it is true and adds to the discussion, so not really a reason to downvote this.
---
I'd imagine that will be part 3 though.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it dies, it‚Äôs a battlecry that state the next spell casts twice. It can be bounced, sniped, polymorphed or whatever, nothing except counterspell stops the next spell from casting 2 times.
---
Exact duplicate, this is 30 damage
---
She does not cast a copy of the upgraded one, so the copy is only going to do 1 dmg to all
---
Also extremely plausible.
---

I would've actually lost had he cast bells 5 more times.
---
Well yeah, but it specificaly states "at the start of your turn"
---
I like your idea.
---
I think I will TAKE it!
---
Yeah, it is, but it's really the only chance you have at winning bpriests with renolock. Sacrifice 1 cardslot to change 10% of your games from unwinnable to potentially winnable.
---
The walking memory of this sub! May this random, small comment serve as a token of appreciation for all the work you do for this community.
---
I always start saving about around the mid-point of each set. I have 2800 saved so far.
---
I've noticed this with Shrivallah, too. I was very disappointed that I couldn't cheat it out early.
---
I started play a year ago, only standard because of lack of collection, focusing in that I disenchanted all in rotation (cards rotated of courseüòÖ) and keeping lotting since far far time now hace more than 5k gold and silly amount of dust.
---
You have a point here, but you're forgetting a thing, right now, most of the decklists for the topnotch decks requires high-cost cards, a considerable part of the community is f2p, so it's pretty much frustrating to have open up a key card to a tier 1-2 deck that 2-3 weeks after will be pretty much nerffed through the nine circles of hell.

I think they were talking about The candles not The golden candle

Hey, that's my blog! I typed that stuff up a while back, but never got around to updating and editing it.

The Dalaran Heist has since thrown a curve ball in regards to how some players should spend their gold, but the strategy of saving gold between expansions is still definitely the way to go.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
When should i be minion trading?
---
I'll give an example for a situation that I always struggle with: Lets say opponent has 3/2 on board &amp; I have 5/5 and its my turn. I could trade their minion off while keeping mine alive, or I could hit face. Trading seems good because it guarentees atleast a 2 for 1 value. But if I hit face, they probably trade their minion into mine themselves which gives me an edge on face dmg. Or they clear my 5/5 with something and now control the board because I didn't trade.
---
Yeah, I and most people feel that un‚Äôgoro was one of the best expansions. I took it that un‚Äôgoro was the last time OP felt interested in the game.
---
It's likely a copy-paste meme
---
All is fun and games untill you remeber is still a dull aggro shitshow. But yeah I guess is better than the countless aggro shitshows we had before.
---
Idk a lot of really high ranked streamers are called OTP when they play only one champion
---
I hated it a lot. Maynly 'cause the caverns below and adapt. Also fire fly made my eyes rolling.
---
That isn't that often to be fair.  Remember when druid got slammed?  It's still competitive and token druid can be made with low dust costs.   Not tier 1-2 levels of consistency, but pretty close.
---
Congratulations, also finished it today.
---
Think of it this way:
---
* As an aggressive Hunter, you're almost never going to go through your whole deck. Either you win by turns 7-15, or you don't win at all. So, often  1/3  or 1/4 of your deck will always be buried/unplayable.
---
* So think of Tracking this way: One mana, you get to draw a specific card you want and then place the other 2 cards at the bottom of the deck.
---
It‚Äôs legit my favorite card back with the vivid red and blue and the gold just all blending together into one awesome cardback. Plus if you can give others the chance to use it, why the heck not!
---
Yesterday I was playing as priest against hunter.  He had lethal on board and 24 health against my lone 1/5 and he decided to taunt and rope me instead of just winning the game.  I dropped Power Word: Shield, 2x Divine Spirit and Inner Fire on the 1/5 for a 28/28 and beat him.
---
  
---
Anyway, the moral of this story is that Inner Fire priest can be super cool and fun.
---
Card advantage wins games. Being able to pick from 3 cards to potentially get what you need for 1 mana is hot shit. Imagine it‚Äôs worded this way instead:
---
‚Äú1 mana: Draw your choice of 1 of the top 3 cards in your deck.‚Äù
---
So you sacrificed the raw card count for exactly the card you need, at the price of only 1 mana. That‚Äôs a great card all day.

I didn‚Äôt mind the 4 extra bosses. You do still need luck with the treasures and buckets but i feel that‚Äôs always the case
---
Thanks! Same to you :D
---
I am sorry if i offended you personally in some way
---
I was hoping someone had a similar dilemma and would answer without me having to share my deck, knowing many probably won't.
---
I do appreciate your advise tho. Have a nice day.
---
what's the real counter for it? killing 4 12 cost minions for 6 mana is impossible for many decks
---
saying these things without examples really doesn't make your point valid.
---
And highroll decks are the worst to play against. Remember big priest. Also everything that deck does feels bs because of the all random stuff that's happening. 
---
But I really wanna hear your opinion.
---
Wonder how much that would actually cost?
---
What‚Äôs the far right?
---
even heavy control doesn't have the ability generally expect for warrior.
---
If you wanted to play control, chances are you hated Un'Goro.
---
Un'Goro was one of the best expansions because they finally managed to balance different iterations of aggro decks with one another; what's more is that you could counter said decks with midrange decks. Which were a thing and were a smart choice.
---
How do I know this? I made my first Legend by farming aggro decks with my Midrange Elemental Shaman deck. Beating aggro and Quest Warriors.
---
It was a satisfying expansion because finally you wouldn't lose anymore to one big button boardclear that were the stupid ones that dominated the previous meta.
---
It's this a fresh one?
---
there it is :)
---
It suddenly makes a lot of sense that my excursions into Moon Guard-US have been affecting what advertisements I see
---
I don't agree. Obviously mountain giant synergizes well with conjurer's calling, but conjurers calling is the card that makes the deck work. The games where you draw conjurers calling and the games you don't are night and day.
---
Peter "Carousel" Griffin
---
I'm surprised Iron Sensei didn't make the cut for rogue, is it too slow?
---
Also fuck warrior. People say priest is boring but how the fuck is warrior any better? Spend 10 minutes doing board clears just to armor up and fatigue? Fucking no class identity. Warrior is a joke.
---
Spoiler: &gt;!When you beat the Dalaran Heist on Normal difficulty, Rafaam notes that Dalaran is *his* and soon after corrects himself to say *"our"*. So it's actually alluded that Rafaam is the betrayer afterall and is playing everyone like a damn fiddle (how unexpected).!&lt;
---
Even more depressing when you think of how much ads you will be forced to watch in the 6 hour period
---
Hi it's me again, I don't know if you're familiar with Firebat's deck doctor series on youtube, but he just uploaded a new one where he works on an aggressive priest deck so maybe you could get some inspiration from that. It's on the Omnislash youtube channel. His advice is waaaay better than mine.
---
[removed]
---
There's a difference between casting a copy and double-casting. The current system makes sense.
---
Do you mean the Viagame House Cups?
---
No idea if they did something dodgy though
---
What else?
---
Out of curiousity, is there a percentage where a strong defensive neutral card would be considered a problem in terms of deck diversity (even if it's only a single card)?
---
On paper it's a good idea but it doesn't really work since you end up opening free packs later no matter what, so I'd advise to save from day 1 no matter where you're at on that pity timer after your big opening.
---
&gt; Galvanizer enables mechathun
---
Ehm.. Wut?
---
The screen randomly transitioned to black and white, except, the history bar like remembered that somehow, and cards I highlighted still were colored
---
What do you mean what it reduces the cost of mechathun and enables combos
---
I think Pogo is great. A control deck should do more than just removing and sitting it out to fatigue. In older HS and other card games it's very usual to either run enough threats or fulfill some other condition that a faster deck could never deal with. Pogo forces honest decks.
---
Problem with Jade was that Druid had immense options for defence, mitigating any weakness, and that it was truly infinite, meaning that if you didn't bypass the defence you were all but guarantueed to lose. Quest was too fast and abused the Charge mechanic. Pogo is gradual and in a class that has to play for tempo.
---
I hate this deck.  I don't mind losing since I pretty much suck, but pogo rogue isn't at all enjoyable to play against.  It's to the point where I want to quit before it's even started if I'm matched against a rogue.
---
Pogo rogue is the new jade Druid, change my mind
---
It‚Äôs not in standard.... for like a longgggg ass time
---
One thing is casting your next spell TWICE and another thing is casting it AGAIN.
---
Damn Zilliax, I don't think even Tar Creeper was in that many decks.
---
I expect that tar creeper and prenerf giggling inventor both beat boom too
---
So it s that a yes or a no to my question?
---
I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs not higher
---
What a boring thing to say, nice dude
---
I was thinking about it the other day. Dr.Boom was an op tempo drop, but it didnt do much more. Zilliax can have huge tempo swing, a must have in every control deck, and thanka to magnetic it can even have "charge". So he does everything.
---
pretty nice variety of decks here
---
Way back in vanilla, Harvest Golem was genuinely one of the staple cards people played if they wanted an okay 3-drop. But obviously cards were much weaker back then.
---
However, only a "slightly better" Harvest Golem sells it short, imo. Just considering the deathrattle, because it's across multiple bodies, it's generally a bit harder to clear (since without a followup AoE it will take two attacks) and receives wide buffs better. Then you consider the echo, which if you have 6+ mana lets you put down multiple sticky minions with a single card, or (using magnetise) a single big sticky minion.
---
At the very least this makes it considerably stronger in generic token decks, or the kind of buff deck that want you to have at least one minion able to attack but don't necessarily need it to be big. Especially if they want another way to potentially spend a lot of mana, but don't want another card that always costs 7+ mana to clog up hands in the early game.
---
I think if you run even a small handful of mechs naturally (like Zilliax+2-3 others), it should definitely make the cut unless you have significant anti-synergy like resurrect cards.
---
Thats only if you are mage
---
Galvanizer used to enable MThun, now it's just a great discount for mechs
---
Yeah legendaries often require build around to be good. Most of my runs with many legendaries were average.
---
Funny you should say that, since Nomi Priest was actually a competitive deck for quite some time, very far from a meme deck.

Well that's the wild rank 20 for you, the dankiest place in HS
---
Not a basic card but I thought ragnaros was CRAZY. First time I saw him I even tried to silence him...
---
Am I missing something here ? Even after that 15 aoe, there would still be a 17/2, 19/4 and 21/7 pogos up, no ?
---
Are you my Bruh?
---
You truly are the spiders georg of terrible mechathun decks.
---
Why would anyone run a 1/2? I'm pretty sure it's a meme card that ppl run as a joke
---
##I'M IN CHARGE NOW
---
Some people really need to read the title a second time. They said basic cards
---
Lucky you, mine was Nat Pagle.
---
Very boring brawl.
---
Midrange mostly, sometimes aggro
---
It still is
---
I'm not your Bruh, friend.

Shadow Word: Death. Granted, it is good, and other classes would love to have it, but the existence of it with Shadow Word: Pain convinced me that Priest was OP. Also, Bloodlust, but I also just liked the idea of filling my board with small minions and then getting a double Bloodlust finish.

I think he has 3 different quests he can give you, one of which is the turtle one.  I know I saw TrumpSC get the turtle one, but I can't remember which run it was in.
---
RIP Stonehill Defender. You will never be forgotten
---
Thanks for confirming
---
I never said you cared more about it. No need to be a douchebag. 
---
All I said is that shit is WAY more oppressive than this in some other games and that, unlike if you have to go to a MTG tourney, you can just say fuck it and start a new game.
---
Also, seeing as a large number of players are playing warrior, it seems that many people don't see it as a waste of time...as winning is fun.
---
If you're upset about losing to it, play a deck that beats it. Easy enough.
---
Azure drake was my first thought; if bliz is ok with a neutral 5-drop going in literally every non-aggro deck can we get drake back to help prop up the midrange archetype?  What people call midrange these days is really just slow aggro.

Guess I‚Äôll leave my tablet on then cause I work those hours.

For sure, same goes for bucket synergies. As a new game mode and not a replacement for arena it would be neat.
---
Why does mech hunter run missile launcher? Is the 1 face damage at end of turn that good?
---
Yeah, we all understand that. You said that the opponent can wreck you on board easily most of the time.
---
Thats not true if youre playing control.
---
I never said it is popular. I just pointed out that people have experimented with that combo.

You cant find mechathun warrior list with galvanizer on hsreplay if you look only at stat for [last patch](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=WARRIOR&amp;includedCards=48983). However if you switch to [last 30 days](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=WARRIOR&amp;includedCards=48983&amp;timeRange=LAST_30_DAYS), you can find lists with decent sample sizes. I personally also play this version since I hate playing the mirror with elysianna+banker. A lot of people have cut banker/brewmaster and more people are playing warrior counter decks so it is probably not worth running mechathun+galvanizer any more.
---
If your main complaint is that you have a full time job and your game time is precious, then just concede against every warrior and move on.
---
I actually managed to pull off a turn 1 lethal during my encounter with Khadgar on heroic with Elistra. Picked Untold Splendor, got the Goblin Army Knife, Duplatransmogrifier and Elistra the Immortal shuffled into my priest deck containing Inner Fire, Divine Spirit, Extra Arms and 3 Lyra the Sunshard during an encounter with P.O.G.O. Got Jepetto Joybuzz from him and pulled Elistra with his Battlecry, and played Elistra with Duplatransmogrifier and Goblin Army Knife and then the build had started. Lyra generated spells such as Power Word: Tentacles and Replicate. The last passive I got was Robes of Guadiness, which in my encounter with Khadgar made my Elistra a 1 mana 78/228 with Charge and Windfury that summoned 2 5/5 copies also with Charge and Windfury.. I generated 176 face damage turn 1.. That run was ridiculous.

Everyone else already answered this question in their own way, but I do think this might also be helpful: 
---
Nearly every turn you should be asking yourself, "Am I the beatdown, or am I the control?" If you're control (meaning you need to control the board until you draw your stuff that will win you the game) then you need to control the board. If you're the beatdown (meaning you have your stuff or you've already played your stuff) then you need to get the face damage in so that your stuff actually works. 
---
If you're playing a tempo deck vs a tempo deck then it's all about value. I have a 1/1, you have a 3/1, you better believe I'm trading. I have the 3/1, I'm hitting face! because you'll have to use your 1/1 to trade anyway so why bother. 
---
Many popular decks are far more polarized however. As noted in other commenters' posts, warrior is nearly always the "control" deck in the current meta (hit them in the face before they draw Dr. Boom and pray you're fast enough) while shaman, warlock, and many hunter decks seem to want to swarm you very quickly (keep them from developing a board and eventually your big cards will be bigger than their cards). 
---
That's actually the fundamental question for pretty much any CCG and it's the #1 basic fundamental for hearthstone so the fact that you're asking it means you're playing the game correctly. If you take your time and analyze your plays I guarantee you'll develop a better feel for it.
---
Would I redownload considering I'm on mobile
---
**PRECISION**
---
I played the same matchup and the only other mech I got as Warlock was Ziliax. Off of memory, the deck had Soularium, Dorian, Rafaam, Godfrey, Betrug, Thalnos, 2 Hellfires, 2 Mortal Coils, and of course the aforementioned Ziliax and 2 Safeguards. I also saw 1 copy of Spirit Bomb, Plot Twist, and Deranged Doctor - probably 2 of each but I Rafaam'd the rest of my deck.
---
Me, too and just to spite both of you, I am not going to use GOLD, your poor pesants!
---
Flamestrike.
---
I was really surprised when I started seeing mage decks that didn‚Äôt run flamestrike but did run other 7 mana cards.
---
That's why I started with the fact that they do majorly different things. That'd be one reason they have different play rates. If Boom was also removal, taunt, and healing it'd be one thing. If it's just a big threat when big threats are limited, well not every deck needs a big threat. Almost every deck does need removal and healing though.
---
Only because Blizzard doesn't seem to believe in reprinting cards like Magic does. I think it's weird, personally.
---
I mean, I probably have just as much time as you do, I just understand that people like to play that and it's a risk I take when playing.
---
Also, what deck takes a lot more thought than this one does lol. You're not talking about a game with interrupts and counters and blocking. It's literally, play cards and hope they don't clear your board/play something bigger than yours. 
---
It seems to me you think everyone should be catering to the "I've got 7 minutes to play so make it quick" crowd. Which ain't gonna happen. 
---
Maybe you should take some time off and rethink if you want to keep playing this.
---
Ya know what! You can play the innkeeper! You can even pick his deck for him!
---
Argent#11448  Trading 80g quest on Asia. Will trade for Asia (or NA if you have both).  If you have history, I can go first. Otherwise you go first (check my history).
---
Northshire Cleric seemed so busted at the time, as it blocked me from playing any of my 2 mana 2/3s, or Feral Spirit or anything. I hated it so much back in beta.
---
And it's not a basic card, but I still think Windfury Harpy should be good. I know it's not, but part of me looks at the stats and abilities for the price and thinks it's a great deal. I used to include it in every deck I could, hoping it would be as good as I felt it should be. It never was.
---
I'd much prefer this solution.
---
Mana Wyrm. That's why it was nerfed. It could deal 10 damages to your face by turn 4 and still sits a 6/3 on the board.
---
Not still really good......
---
The real throwback is Senjin in every deck that wasn't face hunter
---
Missed a chance to call this "Return of the Mech"
---
Maybe things would be different if those Omega effects required you to pay 10 mana for the effect. eh maybe not.
---
"i play minions, this minion buffs my other minions, then it fits this deck"
---
Stormwind champion
---
I also loved the classics, gnomish inventor and loot hoarder for free card draw; yeti, tazdingo, and ogre for all them stats; shattered sun and Dark iron dwarf for the same reason as stormwind; finally mtc and bgh for free effects for otherwise fine cards.
---
OMG i've always thought gurubashi was some kind of human-walrus hybrid, because his ear looked like an eye. I'll never see him the same way again
---
He can't be killed by dark pact

He got naturalized.

And polymorphed.
---
And a lot of other things

Since when does it take dedication to be rank 5. I get rank 5 in an hour every week and then just hang out there. The rank 6-7 players are horrendous on average and have all sorts of junk, meme and budget decks. It's trivial to get to rank 5 these days without resetting all the way back every month. There are terrible players, terrible decks and budget versions of good decks in all sorts of combinations at rank 5. There are definitely players there who don't understand how good Zilliax is, don't get why their deck should run him when it's not obviously on theme and just plain don't have him.
---
Because MTG has 20 more years worth of cards, more formats, and doesn't have an evergreen set in the same way HS does. Reprints just don't make sense in Hearthstone's current environment.
---
It was so much fun
---
The fucking oasis snapjaw cuz i had the kathazan card that switched attack and health and i thought a 7/2 was OP as h*ck
---
He still makes frequent appearances in the arena.
---
I can't believe they still haven't fixed this bug.
---
Flamewreathed faceless, shaman card
---
How long have you played? How big is your collection? The requirement is to be dedicated enough to be able to craft Zilliax
---
Or boy, i remember. Every time i netdecked, i always wondered why \[core hound\] wasnt played, so i always put 2x copies in it. 9 Damage for 7 mana? Thats insane! ...I thought at least
---
Also thought that booty bay bodyguard was insane for some reason, it was even understatted..
---
A ton of mechs are playable without Galv. What was meant is that you have to have Galv for M'Thun to be playable/viable.
---
Combo? No. Control, very rarely. Zilliax is a completely different from all these other examples. It's a survival tool and removal for control and combo decks and it's also used in plenty of aggro and midrange decks because they're almost always mech based this meta (unlike a few months ago, when it wasn't played quite this much). He's good for a purely offensive gameplan (if mechs are involved) and a fully defensive one.
---
Basically no other card in history has been both. I played tons of decks that didn't want to clog up its draws with Fire Fly or run pirates for Patches or have "just a taunt" in Sludge Belcher or play a 7 drop in Boom that didn't do anything defensive or board-impacting that turn. I can't remember the last time I played a deck that didn't want Zilliax besides midrange hunter.
---
i thought he was SO GOOD lol
---
Mech Paladin, cyclone mage,  and beast hunter are fun to play.
---
Fair, but my point still stands.
---
Honestly, if you don't already have a decent collection, 50 euros in card packs isn't going to help very much. I would do the best you can with the cards you have and preorder the next expansion, which will be released in about 2 months.

1/-/- | Deal 1 damage to a minion for each Armor you have.  
---
Even if a worse Savannah Highmane (which isn't even strong enough to avoid being cut from many beast-only midrange lists) was a good turn 6 play for all decks (which it isn't), a 6/9 that makes 6 1/1s when it dies is a horrendous 9 mana play in most situations. Not to mention that it's actively bad in many decks that care about ressing, recruiting or cheating out bigger or more impactful minions or don't want to do anything besides survive, draw and win with a combo.
---
Warrior wasn't a class in Arena during TGT though
---
Wargear is neutral blessing of kings, except better. Fuck that card, it needs to be nerfed.
---
isn't it 2800 to buy all the wings

He has High Priest Thekal in hand, which converts all health but 1 into armour, allowing the OP to use Shield Slam.

Unnerfed Mana Wyrm

It is fundamentally dishonest to write advice that is economically incorrect, especially when it is targeted towards F2P players who need the economic benefit most. I can understand that some people dislike Arena or Wild, but it is very cruel to deliberately steer F2P players away from the two things that can help them grow their collection the most. 
---
It is better to tell the truth about the best two ways to grow one's collection as an F2P player than to give mediocre advice that ends up hurting the player's collection, which is the fate the OP is hoping to have players avoid. Spending gold on just packs and forsaking Wild hurts the player's collection on a far greater scale than any advice like this could hope to compensate for.
---
The advice in the OP is only correct if you have already decided that the two best economic strategies for a F2P player (of playing Wild/only spending gold on Arena) are not worth pursuing. Any advice that assumes a F2P player should abandon the only two things that help them gain an edge is just wrong, both from an economic analysis and from the moral perspective of writing advice to actually help others.
---
Please uninstall and reinstall

old Mana Wyrm, Tunnel Trog and Cleric. noone of them played recently in the meta, one is already dead, but over the time these three dominated hearthstone so hard. 1/3 vanilla body for 1 mana, 2 of them incredible strong because of the snowball effect and the other one just a strong effect for minimal cost, can also snowball in another way as keeping the minions alive **and** draw cards, but not in every deck necessary.
---
Glowtron is more core to mech paladin's strategy than Eternium is to control warrior, sure. But that doesn't make it better IMO.
---
Void Terror, probably because it was my first golden card so i thought it was special
---
Zilliax
---
only 300‚Ç¨? are you guys poor or something
---
My hearthstone updated too, was wondering the same.
---
&gt; Same with zilliax
---
Ehhh it feels opressive to have a warrior to have a huge near guaranteed heal after all that armor :(
---
&gt;The fact that this legendary is basically a must have makes it harder for new players to get into the game and it sucks for anyone without it.
---
I disagree, having one standout legendary you can craft and be sure that you can get use from is fantastic for new players.
---
Midrange hunter obviously can't run it and that's probably the most popular midrange deck. Tempo rogue does more powerful things when the deck is working than anything this can do and this doesn't help it function any more smoothly. Mage has quite literally no use for it. Control decks mostly run Zilliax and don't want this at all.
---
Do misconceptions count?  Because I thought the spell power minions would buff my Mage hero power.  
---
FIREBLAST IS A SPELL DAMMIT.
---
There's a number of classic cards that would never be run now but would be played back in the day. The power level has risen like crazy.
---
Two times the number of infinite fireballs to my face
---
Corridor Creeper had to be #1 in that category. Even control HAD to run it just so they didn‚Äôt get blown out by aggro decks dropping two 5/5s for free on turn 3 or 4.
---
This is a Rafaam Warlock deck. I played Lorewalker Cho and my opponent played a shield slam the next turn, thus giving me a shield slam. I had no armor and nothing in my hand to give me armor to be able to use the shield slam. My next draw ends up being High Priest Thekal, which converts all your health except one into armor. That gave me the ability to use the shield slam and kill one of his minions with it.
---
Damn your stubbornness is embarassing. Saronite used to say copy. Electra doesn't say copy. That's the entire point. Without explicitly saying copy, there's exactly no reason for anyone with a brain to think it works differently than Vargoth. We all know what copy means in Hearthstone compared to similar wording that doesn't explicitly say copy. This situation has no precedent and isn't intuitive.
---
Dragonling mechanic and especially defias ringleader... i came from a tcg where swarm was pretty overpowered so anything that summoned 2 cards for 1 went into my first deck
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Doing some simple math, if the actual were 80%, 1/6 of players do not have enough dust for zilliax, which is obviously completely false for R5-L.
---
I can just tell there's a very sad and disappointing story behind this comment, and I'm sorry.
---
Why is mecharoo so popular? Seems like it would screw up your summon a death rattle that died this game and trigger it cards when you really want that for spider mines
---
hey I'm still using it in my mech paladin deck. Nothing satisfying like a Zilliax-magnetised-Demolisher that life leeches with explosive barrels. Bonus point when it snipes just the right enemy minion.
---
\[\[Goldshire Footman\]\] i read a couple of beginner guides to hearthstone and somewhat got a feel for what good stats are regarding mana costs and stuff. 1 mana 1/2 with taunt seemed so broken to me, and when i played games against others i was confused why i never saw him anywhere else. i pretty quickly outgrew him.

---
1/1/2 | Taunt  
---
Warrior is the only case where zilliax feels like a somewhat broken card. But let‚Äôs not forget that dr boom essentially makes **every mech almost zilliax for warriors**
---
I play a really stupid deck focused on building a minion that has taunt, lifesteal and is unkillable (It recruits itself when it dies). It's amaizing against aggro AND control since it can out-heal aggro and out value control with the immortal undatakah. Its only major weakness, and let me emphasize this. MAJOR WEAKNESS is silence. Against aggro that doesn't matter, but if the control warrior you're playing against silences your immortal taunt (Da Undatakah) you kind of.. Lose. Overall about 55% wr. Great fun, great memes. I can post the decklist if you want. It's a meme deck that's actually competitively viable.
---
No one would also listen to economic advice that ignores time as resource (and when you ignore it, it's easy to ignore fact that you get 10g per 3 wins on ladder, you and me just operate in different frame of reference) . Yes in theory it's all pretty clear cut and simple: it's better to spend 300 gold on two arena runs then on 3 packs if you avg over 3 wins. It gets more complicated in real life when you want to grind 7-8k gold trough arena over one expansion. You also forgot about small thing: how are you supposed to get dozens of packs trough arena at the beginning of expansion so you can play with new cards on ladder? Grind 60 runs in first week? Also when we start to consider more packs the worth of them keep going down because of duplicates - they are much closer to 105 dust per pack then the first one. So I would prefer to say that I don't gain about 4.5k dust by not doing 30 arena runs at 6win avg per expansion.  
---
The real life advice to anybody else reading it is both perspectives are valid because they are not about the same. And you have to balance between them depending on you skill, time and what you enjoy. If you like arena and are good at it, it's better way to spend you gold but I wouldn't treat not doing it as waste.

flesheating ghoul

He had mana to heal up and still PWS tho :p
---
OTKs are the most psychologically devastating when done over two turns.
---
...But, did you win?
---
What's a totem?
---
Remember when they tried to make totem shaman a thing and then never supported it again? I've dusted like 4 golden totem crunchers.
---
I read your thing properly. I understand it isn't truly infinite. But you could just bank some dust, and get about 2-3\* the regular amount of value out of it if you abuse it properly. It would be used well beyond the point of 'trying out'. It wouldn't serve any other purpose than to turn the dust economy on its head.
---
I really don't think it's a hyperbole. I'd never have to buy any cards ever again and I like to play a lot of decks.
---
Deathwing when the only hard removal in the game belonged to druid, rouge and mage

---
Weird one: Pint-Sized Summoner. Had a friend who would play this against me when I first started and I could never kill it. He would snowball his mana advantage every round and beat me. I didn‚Äôt even have any rare cares!
---
This is wayy too far down. Have an updoot.
---
Before the rotation I made sure to open some more TFT and Ungoro packs because I liked them more than any of the revealed cards
---
I forgot this card existed.  Blizzard never includes it in solo adventure buckets, boss decks, premade brawl decks, etc.
---
Before the nerf, it used to be 2x in every deck.
---
Every now and then depending on what cards are in standard, it is still op against priest.
---
And mech synergy for Zilliax, SnipSnap, etc.
---
Yeti everyday, 4mana slap him down for the huge stats he gives
---
&gt;Even with all the controls to prevent abuse, I imagine it would be too complex for Blizzard's comfort considering how much emphasis they put on maintaining casual simplicity in the game.   
---
I had thought this too but in an MMO I play I notice bind timers on my equipment in that I can refund it back to the vendor within 36 hours.  
---
I imagine the system for Blizzard would be less complex but then I'm not then I'm not one of their developers.  
---
&gt;Not to mention, if it doesn't help their bottom line, they'd probably never be interested and I doubt allowing players to test out cards before they commit would ultimately increase profits. But maybe there's some research that says otherwise?  
---
I imagine it would help a bit as it would just promote the game in a more friendly manner.  
---
You are right there is no immediate outright obvious monetary gain but the important part is there is no loss.  
---
They released free solo content for quite some time with no outright gain other than hoping to increase player participation and thus encouraging them to spend on multiplayer content so it could fit into that category.  
---
I personally would be more encouraged to buy some packs if I knew I had some time to experiment a bit with my precious resources that my purchase had funded.  
---
I had previously thought and posted about a new game mode that would effectively be a "free to use any cards" option with no quest progress or ranks etc. to encourage people to spend more moeny on crafting the decks if they like them and want to promote through ranked.  So in a way this is just another idea of trying to help people get some experimentation for freedom without impacting on the dust system Blizzard seemingly love (and probably drives  people away from the game over time).  
---
&gt;What about creating a new in-game currency that would be the equivalent of fun money? It would be collected and used similar to dust, but it would be clearly denoted that the cards crafted with would disappear after a set time. That way, you don't have to worry about complex controls for abuse. The cards could have some visual cue that makes it clear its temporary. Players instead just get a certain amount of otherwise worthless currency to test out cards and could maybe earn extra through quests or events. That might be a compromise Blizzard could actually get behind.  
---
Yup that's a good idea too.  I guess the question then is you could take these decks into ranked?  How long would they last and how hard is it to earn this currency?  
---
Maybe you get a set amount (equivalent to 20K dust for example) and it never disappears (i.e. 1:1 dust ratio when the deck expires ot you dust it) but you can only use the decks in casual and not ranked.  
---
In the end that ends up being a lot like my idea of a new game mode but at least they don't need to create a new game mode.  
---
If it were a currency you earned and it disappeared I wonder if the grind mentality would be still feel somewhat punitive like the dust system, still better than what we have now.

same here, i‚Äôve had to reinstall over 5 times this month and today it said my decks were missing cards.. such a shame
---
&gt; But you could just bank some dust, and get about 2-3* the regular amount of value out of it if you abuse it properly.  
---
How? Be specific as I'm not seeing how this could occur. Once you've pointed out a good example then perhaps I can think of a simple solution?

Assassinate...
---
Destroy a minion! So broken!
---
To make yeti better they should have a laser on it that deals 10 damage to any minion
---
Or instead they should make it a 7/7 with overload 2
---
It's not enough that it's a broken deck. 
---
\-The hero power makes applying early pressure impossible
---
\-building one massive minion is impossible because of "deathrattle destroy a minion", entomb, and psychic scream
---
\-He's at 80 health!!!
---
This boss is cancerous. If you build just to beat him, you'll lose to the other bosses
---
Any and every card with taunt, [[target dummy]] ftw

Cut me some slack. It was a brain fart.
---
I meant turn two kill.
---
It‚Äôs not power creep if there was no power to begin with lmao. Think of Ironbark as having never existed, it basically didn‚Äôt since no one used it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not power creep.
---
Off-topic but Gurubashi Berserker won me so many solo adventure encounters
---
Gruul and Avenging Wrath. Thought both of those were stupidly OP at first.
---
A card that keeps getting stronger each turn? Gains health so somewhat heals himself each turn? YES PLEASE! Followed by "I'VE GOT THE BEAST IN MY SIGHTS!"
---
As for Avenging Wrath, I felt that for 6 mana with a bit of luck I could kill a lot of things. Ofcourse I learned after a few games that the luck didn't exist and it never killed anything really. But maybe I just really liked the animation of just smiting all the plebs arround me with holy bolts.
---
Nice one m8!
---
&gt;You have 24 hours to do this at what point the timer expires and your card can no longer be exchanged and you're locked to it.  
---
So you had 400 dust, you crafted an epic, that 400 dust is gone.  
---
You have a trade window for other epics (or less but you aren't getting the dust difference back) or 24 hours at which time whatever card you have at that point is locked - no more exchange.    
---
After this point normal dust rules apply.  
---
So you see then you can't really exploit if you're never getting your dust back and there is a timer on the card that can be exchanged.  
---
I guess they key here is the topic I had said "dust refund" and I thought about the exploitation of dust as I wrote the post.  My original idea was "you cannot craft the same card again from that initial dust spend" but that gets too complex hence why a "exchange system" would be far more appropriate as you never get the dust back.
---
move the game folder into another place (same Drive, or another doesn't matter), open Battle app choose locate your game, navigate to the game folder you just moved, and its should be fixed(No more wasting time) ;).
---
I didn't really mean that opening 90 packs is fun, but doing it in a bulk is more fun than opening one every day. In those 90 packs, there are probably 4-7 legendaries and a bunch of epic. If I open them one by one, I get disappointed 19 out of 20 times.
---
Yes please to the open all button. Pushing space does do the trick now, but it still takes ages.
---
Low mana cost for spell damage, can enable some combos/wave clears, and draw you a card
---
Uproot or no balls.
---
Low mana cost means he can easily be played along with a spell to get the +damage, and most importantly the card draw means he doesn't cost a card and he can be played alone just to cycle a card.  Sometimes people play Kobold Geomancer for the cheap spell damage, sometimes people play Novice Engineer or Loot Hoarder for the card cycle.  Thanos is both of these in one.
---
CONGRATS, OP.
---
YOU MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE
---
If it makes you feel better, Kripp himself called Life Tap a terrible hero power when he first started.
---
You should take five seconds and use all of your reading comprehension and logical thought skills. What does doing something "twice" mean? It means to do something two times. One more time than once. What does "again" mean? It means one more time.  AKA: twice. The second time you do something, to re doing it twice and you're doing it again. They mean the exact same fucking thing. Neither card says who or what is casting the spell. It's just more lazy "streamlining" that makes things confusing, inconsistent or unintuitive. Which is a shame, because they just needed to use the word copy to make it clear. 
---
For someone so wrong, you sure are a cocky asshole about it.
---
From experience, I think Rogues perform better in Arena with a lot of 3 and 4 drops, and fewer 2. HP is a good enough 2 drop most games
---
Silence :/
---
Definitely Starving Buzzard when he was at 2 mana. Best boi in hunter
---
\*whale noises\*
---
Do you happen to know what was meant by matchmaking improvements in the last patch?
---
Scavenging hyena. I still think it‚Äôs op
---
It's a common bug. You can get more info from the other times this has been asked at least once a day for the past 6 or 7 days.
---
Murloc warleader for sure
---
Mana Wyrm. Coming from MTG it was the closest thing to Delver of Secrets. I was right, though.
---
almost allw warrior removals
---
Old starving buzzard (2 mana)
---
Chillwind yeti
---
8 mana mindcontrol
---
Everyone has a good game plan until you drop a 6/7 on the the board
---
I'm on a Warrior run with Melchezzar and lots of armor gain, and it's essentially a troll deck... With the extra cards, I've gone to fatigue and won that way three times in a 5-1 streak
---
It really wasn't seen that much after it was nerfed tbh, but yeah seeing play in 1 deck and not even a key card in it is not op
---
Why would it be a spoiler?
---
I thought mind control was so good i play only priest for my first months of hs
---
I'm curious how Zilliax stacks up in wild to and with Pioleted shredder.
