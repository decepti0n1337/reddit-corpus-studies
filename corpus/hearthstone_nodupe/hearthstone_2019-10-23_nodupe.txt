Nice!  What are you gonna craft with the dust from that golden quest?
---
---
---
Well you have to build a meme deck to play it
---
You realize that costs 6 mana and is also a 2 card combo so it literally has no advantage over evolve + desert hare or mogu which is going to come out 2 turns earlier.
---
Its the difference between 4 and 6 mana. At 4 mana maybe your opponent play a taunt or a rush. At 6 mana your opponent dragonfire potions you board
---
I think that with the removal of buckets that will change, decks won't be as consistent in quality. Aggro requires less quality than control to draft.
---
Sonya has broken enough things Shaku is way safer.
---
Maybe they were worried about Warrior being too strong.
---
Yeah exactly. I'm not opposed to the people who are supporting the movement. I'm in favor of the movement.
---

---
My comment was pointing out that people who were like "Okay fine give these whiners a few days" are probably now like "yeah I don't give a fuck about your human rights cause it's not going to go anywhere, your comments no longer deserve to be seen here".
---
So... Yeah, they literally are fed up with human rights. They never actually cared about the movement, they just wanted it to pass by. And now that a week has passed, anyone who tries to bring it up is going to be "overstaying their welcome" in the eyes of these people.
---
In my experience evolve has been the most frustrating to play against and there‚Äôs no playing around it or anything. All the other wild cards there‚Äôs at least some counter play most classes are capable of.
---
Was it made in China though because not going to lie that would be funny
---
I've been running a hand lock list and it's solid against shaman.  
---
  
---
Loses to pretty much everything else though.
---
I mean you can get turn 2 10/10 Edwins so it's not that big of a deal. I don't Sonya is too scary, although the devs might not want to think about working around her.
---
They‚Äôre probably gonna bust out the big guns so everyone will forget
---
Edwin has pretty consistently been on the list of "classic legendaries that might need a HoF replacement" given that he's shown up in every world champion's decks
---
Cool thanks for that info! I think I remember him saying something about Pogos easily becoming like 30/30s? That sounds awesome yet terrifying lol.
---
I think Archbishop could potentially warp metas. You have to consider it was in standard alongside the un'goro quests and death knight hero cards. It's a huge amount of resources. I love playing him in wild, but he doesn't always belong in standard.
---
As a temporary addition? could be cool!
---
It goes left-to-right. There's a patch where that got changed.
---
Well, if that was the case, I would say they missed the mark horribly as currently Warrior sits on the bottom of class representation, only ahead of Warlock which is a class that desperately needed some help in the patch but instead got Renounce Darkness because...reasons.
---
I just stopped harthstone when they annonced thorissan and nzoth. Then with the HK drama I decided to not go back
---
So true.
---
Honestly Blizzard have just fumbled their way through the last 6 years. It‚Äôs a miracle the game is still as popular as it is.
---
From the rumors it sounds like a totally different game, PvE oriented instead of PvP.
---
Been playing for about a week now and I really like using Mage Decks. Do y'all have suggestions for what deck recipes I should pursue? 
---
I was looking into the Archmages of Dalaran deck or a tempo deck recipe that I found (think the cards mostly come from Saviors of Uldum packs). Any thoughts or advice would be super helpful, thanks!
---
FYI for anyone reading this - Blizz have acknowledged that the Android client is currently fucked, they think they know what the problem is and they are working on fixing it.
---
You're not going crazy, but there isn't a solution just yet. Wait for the next hotfix patch.
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
Congrats! What were the rewards?
---
600 gold, a couple packs and a golden rare
---
Trump clearly isn't playing on the China server, though. And a well-known streamer obviously didn't bot his account on stream...
---
That's not what I said. 
---
If you're reading stocks on a weekly or monthly basis you're doing it wrong.

Bro...

Calm down.
---
I'm not saying HS is p2w nor RNG based.
---
Just saying that it seems that in competitive professional HS since the pro players always seem to take the most efficient play. The only thing that appears to decide who wins is who has a better draw. It might be my rank 2 knowledge speaking wrongly. Yes. I wrote this post to try and know how not to try and tell people it is indeed RNG based.

---
I know they are making better plays than me. This is not the point of the post. xD
---
What? xD
---
And that's what they are now, just another studio under the Activision-Blizzard umbrella, churning out titles to make some money before what's left of their past reputation completely dissipates.
---
Thanks! I am going to check it out! Hopefully will come back here with a different opinion.
---
I meant in context of playing a Resurrect Priest which uses Nzoth and if you use mass dispel facing off another Nzoth army then you will more than likely win.
---
That‚Äôs why secret mage is dominating the meta, haha. I can‚Äôt think of an efficient way to beat them, even adding tech cards such as eater of secrets doesn‚Äôt do that much
---
Agreed. I find the games super boring and have not played after the first few days.
---
It's a response to the backlash, they needed to add something the players will like quick to stop the stream of leavers, without thinking of the Meta..

Okay, but if Oasis Surger and Starfall are so good at handling aggression, why do the statistics show the deck loses to aggression generally, not just Murloc Shaman, at a rate roughly two to one?

What the hell did you cast?

---
Glad I saved all my old phones to multi bot Baal runs
---
I think I‚Äôm the only person on Earth who wants new Warcraft and Starcraft RTS entries.
---
Take evolve out of standard and give us Devolve for the rest of the event
---
It's not even the top deck.  Secret paladin, highlander paladin, murloc shaman, resurrect priest all have a higher win rate.
---
Powerful plays are fine if half the classes could run an answer in a good deck imo. I dont think that's true currently.
---
I don‚Äôt have issues on IPhone. Yet
---
In my opinion it's only second to Master Oakheart.
---
I think mogu is a fine card if evolve wasnt a thing. Its good at board recovery.
---
I opened up 2 Mogu Cultists. I like messing about with meme decks, should I craft Tak and the other core cards? I don't know what they are, so pls help with that too. I don't play too much rogue, but I like its' mechanics.

I was. However, I consider that period of Hearthstone's history as an extended beta period. The game was still ironing out it's basic and classic set and was where the game underwent the biggest batch of balance changes, the likes of which we haven't seen since. Hunter wasn't so much broken as the game itself was.
---
I wish they did this with all cards that generate tokens or other cards.
---
I feel like anyone making that comparison clearly doesn't truly remember what it was like to play against Undertaker Hunter. 
---
Not only was Undertaker just a ridiculous minion to play against, but Hunter also had UTH + Starving Buzzard to punish a player that tried to build a board. It also took a whopping six months before they nerfed Undertaker.
---
I recall them saying either it was one of the most played decks of all time or it had one of the highest winrates of all time. Either way, it was the worst experiences I've ever had on ladder and to this day it makes me dislike Hunter more than any other class.
---
the point is that the plays are often not obvious
---
Ummm I'm not pandering, I don't do that. I don't give a hoot about upvotes. I am actually agreeing with you right now. There is nothing wrong with constructive criticism IF its coming from a valid source with knowledge on the subject. I am a big advocate of believeing one is never perfect and should always strive to learn and to do better because if you don't you become stagnant.
---
It's the apex of rng.
---
&gt; That would kill shaman. 
---
Give me a break, Shaman was one of the best classes before this event started, and will continue to be one of the best classes after removing a single card that was only just added a week ago.
---
I don't like ["Created By" Meta](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cpyqof/a_look_back_at_the_created_by_meta/). Especially Evolve / Mutate are beyond awful. There is way too fuzzy RNG. I don't feel like 'card' from Hearthstone. Game becomes unreadable and decision making to matter less.
---
Conversely, I think If Team-5 removes these cards, It will be a fun game.
---
Out of curiosity, do you play Wild? Druid is down in the gutter, Big Priest gets rekt by Devolve and probably can't keep up with constant board pressure from Evolve Shammy, Reno Priest must tread carefully and draw well to be able to answer the boards which usually means Psychic Scream on T7 or lose. Aggro doesn't kill you by T4 unless you buff their minions yourself. Defile can't touch 4-drops. 
---
Wild Evolve Shaman is alive and well, very much thanks to Hare. The archetype is possibly a bit underplayed at the moment, going through refinement period. It likely belongs to high Tier 3 or low Tier 2, depending on where you are on the ladder, because it has a very good MU against Sn1plock. I got a friend [who took it #2 Legend](https://twitter.com/Hidden35987401/status/1182019339744141316) this season.
---
Yap. Like Theo wrote in the tweet, Shamans still have an absurd amount of cardgeneration specially when the quest is online. 
---
Most certainly without any evolve/mutate effects Shamans wouldn‚Äôt be like 50% of the Ladder, but they still be in an ok spot. And that‚Äôs why they should consider changing evolve/Mogu. ( Obviously there would be instant threads about how greedy Blizzard is because some F2P guys invested all their dust on Shaman...)

---
There are many assumptions being made in my calculations. For the cost of $420 I'm assuming you would need to pull \~16 legendaries and \~9 epics, this is because of dust conversions. This also doesn't account for commons and uncommons pulls in the packs or golden cards. My calculations also do not account for pity timer (guaranteed legendary every 40 packs which resets if you disenchant a legendary), which I'm sure is why the average disenchant value of a pack is higher. Most players are not going to be opening 50 packs at a time. I will add a disclaimer at the top of the post, thanks for informing me
---
I agree with you on the title, but it does get people to click...
---
When I made my post regarding the email I received from blizzard support, people all tried to link and make jokes about it being related to the China stuff.. Despite it having nothing at all to do with it

I agree with a new player shouldn't have a meta deck right out the gate. I'm not a new player (hasn't spent any money) have been playing since the beta and still only have 1/2 meta decks at a time (probably because I keep disenchanting cards). When I first played hearthstone I though I would make a great deck, trying different combos but I've realised that it not possible for a F2P player to do that. You craft a couple legendaries and if they don't work you're screwed. This is the area where I think Blizzard need to improve

I didn‚Äôt know that thanks !
---
That's what I said, except for the totally different with N'Zoth part.
---
Sadly, but it was bound to fail as with every Internet 'revolution'
---
Yes, for Hearthstone Masters. Qualifying was changed recently, actually, to make it more "players friendly". And while qualifying into Masters is not THAT hard for a great player (it's still a lot of grind, but that's to be expected), getting further is the biggest issue. But 250-300 players enter each Masters, and realistically only those finishing in one of the first places even have a SHOT at entering GMs (because it's based on total prize money ranking, and Masters are top-heavy when it comes to prizes). I don't know how it will be handled next year exactly (given that we've skipped first relegation last time), but it's still hundreds of players fighting for 6 spots in GMs. 
---
See, that would be a problem if not for one thing. Only GMs can realistically play HS competitively for living without other sources of income - regular players have to find sponsors (which is HARD if you aren't GM or already well known - even great new players have almost zero exposure so they aren't amazing pickups for sponsors) or start streaming (and it's nearly impossible to break through in HS at this point). That's why I think that the entire system needs to be re-thought. Maybe have another league, a much bigger one that's way easier to qualify, but also pays less per game etc. You don't even need to stream the entire thing, you could only do highlights, or stream the more important stuff like Playoffs. That League would have a lot of rotation on the bottom, so worst players would be weeded out and new would come in their place. But it wouldn't be the end of the world for someone who got relegated, because if he proves himself once again he will get back. And only a handful of players from it would get to GMs every season - worst GMs would get back to this League too so they don't just go from being a GM to being no-one.
---
But yeah.. I'm no an expert on those matters. I just have some ideas, but the thing is that they have a whole esports team! People they pay to think through stuff like that. And even regular players, let alone pros, see that the system is flawed in the current form.
---
I don't see the connection with HS
---
You ‚Äòexercise regularly‚Äô. Like I am supposed to believe that after you made hundred assumptions about the OP. 
---
You are making assumptions about OP but suddenly it‚Äôs bad when someone questions about you literally posting hundreds of posts on Path of Exile, a much harder and more demanding game.
---
Tess is not a meme, it‚Äôs a strong card.
---
Any sources on that bro?
---
The reason im playing standard casual intil the next update, i see litterally everything other than shaman and its great. Its like everyone who is sick of shaman has decided casual is the way
---
I made Nzoth rogue because I thought it'd be a fun meme and I had most of what I needed. But now I'm winning fairly consistently and feeling a bit guilty that maybe a deck that can go infinite if it reaches turn 10 isn't exactly fair.
---
Depends on your collection, but also learning and understanding the meta and the deck that you're playing. if you took a tier 1 deck, you'll be fine. If you're looking for a good warrior deck to climb with, off the top of my head, if you're seeing a lot of shamans, control warrior should be fine, if you're seeing a lot of reborn late game deck, you can try aggro warrior. Warrior isn't in the hottest spot in this current meta, if you want more details deck lists, you can check out vicious syndicate.
---
For now I'd say aim for rank 5 first as it seems that less then 3% of the player base makes it to rank 5 and less then .3% of the player base hits legend. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/baavvu/only_3_players_are_rank_5_to_legend_is_that_true/
---
Well the good thing is that highlander mage is in a good spot to beat a lot of shaman and maybe combo priest. In terms of late game decks, you will have a harder time as those decks have a ton of value. If you want a better answer checking out apxvoid's streams will help give you a selection of mage decks that might be better matched to the current pocket meta that you are facing.
---
Went from Rank 2 1 star to Rank 3 3 stars solely due to disconnects today. Infuriating and I'm going to give ranked a break for a bit now
---
so just one
---
&gt; Why 10? Sounds small tbh.
---
The pity timer is only 10 packs for the first legendary you open in a given set. After that it is 40 packs IIRC.
---
XD
---
&gt; But I don't know if they will ever do it again given what has happened as a result.
---
I hope they do keep trying stuff like this. Just like the buffs last expansion you won't hit on all of them but I still think it's an overall positive for the game.
---
It draws two cards from your deck and adds them to your hand.
---
Idk. For me it was better last year. I only play HS on iOS when I'm in uni lecture and I get more random disconnects, the game crashes every 1-2 days and collection is slow af.
---
Twitch and r/hearthstone memes. Sarcastically insinuates the situation could have been foreseen and planned around. 4head is the indication it's a joke.
---
I had magnetized Zilliax onto it, so it had both rush taunt and lifesteal, he got a ton of health off of it when he was low
---
MCT should be nerfed, but it's a totally play-around card. 
---
&gt;&gt;Play against shaman? Don't play more than 3 minions, unless the other player has already played MCT or the 4th minion (or extra) are similar to the others (a bunch of 1/1s)
---

---
I uninstalled hearthstone on my phone(Note 8) since it's so buggy and barely works. The game has been nearly unplayable for months for me and they haven't done anything to fix it
---
The thing is how am I supposed to not play more than 4 minions if I'm playing an aggro deck. It seems like an impossible task for aggro
---
Never seen someone suggest they should give up most of their profits because is holding the game back!

Plot Twist does shuffle back the Curse of Weakness echo copies.  Played with this interaction hundreds of times.
---
He doesn't care and evidently doesn't understand how how own game functions
---
Feature-wise the mobile client is definitely holding the PC client back.
---
I like Firebat, but I think he's wrong here. Affiliate links are a pretty new concept for HS. I'm pretty sure RoS was the first expansion that had them, which means this year Blizzard went out of their way to introduce a new system to benefit content creators. Then there's the fact that they've started inviting streamers to play expansions early and even hosted events for them to compete with new solo content. And for each expansion they partner with various streamers/players and get them to make youtube videos/guides which they host on the client so everyone sees them every time they log in to HS. Not to mention that having content creators reveal cards from new expansions has been the standard for every expansion for years now (since TGT I think). Do those sound like the actions of a company that isn't supporting its content creators?
---
As far as affiliate links are concerned, I'm pretty sure the intention from the beginning was to activate them for the pre-release period (and a short time after release) of the expansion to drive pre-order sales/initial pack sales, then deactivate towards the middle/late part of the expansion (which is probably slower for pack sales anyway) since that has happened for both RoS and SoU. You could argue that it's not enough and they should keep it active all the time, but you have to acknowledge that they are clearly making an effort to support content creators.
---
TL;DR- There are plenty of legitimate reasons to hate Activision/Blizzard, but this isn't one of them.
---
Too bad you can't do anything with those cards
---
That is actually a very good question. I just checked in game and Marin is uncraftable both ways, while Sn1p-Sn4p cannot be crafted golden.
---
The classic Blizzard consistency.
---
I honestly don't know i uninstalled all my blizzard games after you know what.
---
Nope. I lost the game shortly afterwards lol.
---
You don't get dust when cards rotate.
---
Good for you.
---
What? yes it has, its worked perfectly for years.
---
Any form of board clear? Hysteria, brawl, maybe even light bomb if 1/2 turn later. Evolve on turn 4 hits midrange decks the worst. Can't tell what PW refers to
---
No

I just realized it did as well. I thought, when I played it, that my card count went down (but I made a mistake by counting my hand size including the plot twist)
---
My turn to post this tomorrow ok?

Finished with cooby
---
Have tried but It‚Äôs still fcked for me
---
Call me crazy but maybe when they print these "mana" cheat cards they shouldn't have their cost be so far adjusted from their natural cost.
---
Or probably the easier solution, have cards retain their mana cost to play when they are on the board.
---
The only problem is that many of the cards are those you get when you start a new account
---
Have been like this for 4 days now on mobile
---
Not at all, I grind ladder all day so it's fun to play solo stuff
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a balance thing for me but i just plain don‚Äôt like the old sets. I think some of the most fun arena cards (in terms of balanced gameplay) have been printed in the sets currently in standard. 
---
I‚Äôm mostly talking about rush and lifesteal and very few snowball-type mechanics/minions but also some of the older sets just have such dumb cards. And inspire stiiiiiinks.
---
Gotta make my bread somehow now that I‚Äôm unemployed :/
---
Also, I think one of the big reasons they hired Cora (Songbird) was to act as a liaison between the design team and us (the unwashed masses).
---
So, considering her background, I would expect her to become more of "the face" of the HS dev team. So, maybe that will increase the communication. 
---
She just started working there this month.
---
I did not WATCH these streams but wasn't one of the MDonais + daughter streams Tombs of Terror, and thus not strictly expansion related?

#THE ZANCIENT ONE
---
The most idiotic and brutally unfun mechanic they insist on adding to every solo adventure is now in equally awful multiplayer form. Woohoo.
---
They key to getting better and ranking up is understanding the moves your opponent can make and is most likely to make on a given turn and the turns after. I‚Äôd recommend playing decks you often go up against to get a better understanding of how the deck operates. Then, when you face off Against the deck you can more readily predict what your opponent will do and what their goal is. Do they want early board control or are they conserving resources for a swing turn? Or, are they fighting for board control heavily? 
---
I‚Äôve been playing decks that are not tier 1 and I made it to rank 5 because I play around what my opponent is trying to do. Moreover, if you have a turn that isn‚Äôt all that good for you, try and think of a different play that disrupts what your opponent wants to do. 
---
For instance, Highlander hunter wants to drop Brann on 7. Putting a taunt up the turn before he can may throw him off that play causing him to make a suboptimal play to ensure the king krush goes face.
---
most people with portuguese as their primary language must know at least english (me included) as their secondary since its very hard to find usefull information, guides or anything in portuguese actually... 
---
Even the meetings in some companies are spoken in english in Brazil, there are some people who tries to use portuguese in the internet, but they know it will be a terrible experience
---
Agreed. 
---
3 mana ‚Äú25% chance to win the game‚Äù is just unfun

I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with it. Big youtubers do it with no issue, and his contents good so I don‚Äôt see the problem.

Good call; it shouldn't be something fun or interesting, that would never get added.

For 3 years I played nothing but casual and solo...now I wish I had my portraits.

Nobody expect the vilefin inquisition!
---
Nailed it !
---
OMG, is this actually better than the actual one ?
---
Honestly it feels like this game has been on maintenance mode since it was released. No progression on the technology or design side whatsoever, the last major update was actually the addition of tavern brawl. 
---
The only new content since years is just cards with completely exchangeable stats and flavour for 50 to 80$ every four months, with very very little balance changes here and there.
---
SO SO FRUSTRATING trying to keep my enemy from killing me so we can both get 100. I got to 44 and only went for his dreadsteeds emoting whoops everytime he hit my face.
---
Technically it wouldn't exactly be a revival, but waking them up. Except for Y'Shaarj, who got straightup ripped out of Azeroth and proclaimed as dead. 
---
If you look at the bossfights we had against old gods,  you'll immediately notice that that isn't all there is to it. 
---
We messed around in Yoggs brain for a bit, and poked C'thun in one of who knows how many eyes. 
---
When it comes to N'Zoth, we haven't even fought him yet. We hear him whisper here and there, but that's not much of an entrance yet.
---
I've played pvp a couple times (mostly for free pack quests), but I'm almost completely solo when I play now.  PVP just isn't fun.
---
I'll play tavern brawls, but even then, if it's a constructed deck week, I'll skip it.
---
It's an older meme, sir, but it checks out.
---
Same difference

Thing is, Blizzard invited politics in their other games (see Overwatch), yet when something important is actually going on in the world and Blizzard does nothing and basically kowtows, they deserve every single criticism. I could be MASSIVELY annoyed at how everything Blizzard touches now turns to crap - Diablo Immortal, the firing of 800 people despite record revenue, the Overwatch "Ellie" scandal, scrapping the Heroes of the Storm competitive season for an entire year, censoring card art to appease to censors, and now the fuckup with how they dealt with Blitzchung.
---
You SHOULD care about a company's politics, especially when those same politics affect your enjoyment of a game that you love. When the politics of a company seep into the enjoyment of their game, when they do such a massive fuckup that there is no way for you to enjoy the game, there should be reason for you to be concerned about if you should be supporting a company or not. 
---
You wonder why people are still allowed to post about the screwup that Blizzard did? Newsflash: the Hearthstone community is perhaps THE most vocal critics of Blizzard. And politics here are fair game because it affected someone who was involved in the Hearthstone community, and Blizzard grossly overstepped their boundaries. I think the mods won't even acknowledge your request because all of the Blizzard communities are pissed off at what Blizzard did.

I think it's about the lore. I don't know much about wow lore but from what i've heard Garrosh actually gets corrupted by the old gods. She might have joined some pirate's crew, i dunno.
---
It's a pretty unintuitive interaction tbh
---
wild quest warlock is pretty fun though it it's random and probably folds to aggro
---
but when you pull off the dream, it's insane, i think I had 3 Thaddeus, 2 Mal'ganis and 2 ragnoaros on the board at once one time
---
Yes. What you personally like or dislike, and what solutions to issues you would be happy with. Just like anything else, you can trust an individual to tell you how they feel but shouldn't necessarily trust someone to tell you how someone else feels. Answering questions on behalf of others requires tons of research, analysis, data, experience, etc. As a designer, I know how difficult and borderline unanswerable some questions about large populations can be, so being asked to change or not change something from a single individual based on the thoughts and opinions of a large population is hard for me to trust. At least not without a lot of analysis to back up those opinions.
---
Anyway, the point is, we just want to hear what you think and what your experience is like. I feel like many players don't like to give feedback this way because they don't want it to come off as if they think the game should be made just for them. While that is true, the game isn't made for any one particular person, having a ton of data points for how different people feel is ultimately how we make decisions.
---
&gt; Every card game maker does that outside of very specific occasions. People invest time and money into card games, and too many balance updates is an easy way to turn players off of your game. If every other week, the deck you built was slaughtered by card nerfs, how much long would you take it?
---
Ah I see what you're doing there buddy. You're painting a scenario where the alternative to the current situation is somehow slaughtering card power every other week.
---
Expansions are every 4 months. What actually needs to be done is to deal with cards that are very obviously problematic in the current meta (right now Evolve and N'Zoth) and deal with them. It really is that simple. Instead what is literally happening is a miserable ladder experience that will go on for literally months because they won't deal with it.
---
Stop making bullshit excuses for them.
---
&gt; Neither N'Zoth nor Evolve broke Standard (at least on their own) while they were initially legal, and given the discussion around the cards prior to the start of the event, it was not obvious to anyone that they'd be doing what they currently are.
---
Not obvious if all you do is play Arena, Tavern Brawl and play low ranked ladder sure. Claiming that nobody could have seen this shit show coming is total nonsense.
---
The gruffalo plays HS
---
The core of transform shaman is pretty cheap. If you have his quest, then quest transform is cheap. Both are based mostly on commons/rares
---
Dear mods, can we megathread Hong Kong shitstorm already?
---
What is this pendragon thing?
---
This killed about 120 with one defile then it just stopped for some reason even tho it SHOULD be infinite technically (glad it‚Äôs not)
---
But we are talking about what the 'legendary' rules is. In HS basically legendary are unique-named characters and items, like the legendary weapons.
---
All non-legendary weapons have generic names... except when they arbitrary name it "Dommhammer" and it's not a legendary.
---
It's the only cases where it break the rule.
---
It is but at this point the subreddit doesn't care about stupid things like "facts" it just wants to hate.
---
what?
---
Defile was the reason they changed dreadsteed. But this is the old unchanged dreadsteed.
---
You aren‚Äôt. In fact it‚Äôs rare you‚Äôre the only one. But for real though I actually liked the art but for 1k win portrait it‚Äôs disrespectful, would‚Äôve much rather had it as a Halloween skin bundle or something like Annoy-o-Tron.
---
And people will undoubtedly eat it up. Smh my head
---
Amazing how you wrote so much yet said so little
---
The point is even if I am an armchair activist I‚Äôm not shitting on blitzchung or this reddit for talking about it
---
I called you out because of your shitty ‚ÄúI just wanna look at memes and play a video game‚Äù comment
---
Garrosh has a thing for 80s shoulderpads
---
It just happened the same to me with Mage and a [[Scroll of Wonder]]
---
When I saw the scroll turning into Defile I knew it was going to be the end of the universe, but thankfully the pain didn't last that long and I completed the event quite fast at least... (something like 200ish kills in one game IIRC), RIP universe tho.
---
The rotation is consistent throughout one game, correct? So it's not good to play big things in the middle, but, depending on which rotation you get, you should play them to the right or left.
---

5/-/- | Casts When Drawn Cast a random spell.  
---
Its a bit of a problem card in a vacuum. For sure in arena, its one of the best cards in the game.
---
Te biggest problem with Sap is that it costs 2 mana so you can remove a threat and develop, or push for lethal.
---
Rogue isn't in a good spot at the moment so no one's looking. I think it will be a more serious problem someday.
---
I don't disagree with you. The portuguese translation is very bad, I find translations errors ALL the time, in every expansion.
---
I only use it because I find the dub funny and Hearthstone, for some reason, don't let you choose text and voices in separate options.
---
I disagree emphatically. Of course, this is all your opinion and is a subjective experience, so there‚Äôs not going to be any real resolution here. And that‚Äôs OK.
---
Firstly, I think it‚Äôs unfair handwaving to just go ‚Äúnew expansions were meh.‚Äù Zephyrs isn‚Äôt exciting to you at all? Swampqueen Hagatha? Mecha‚Äôthun? Once again, subjective, but you give Thaurissan as an example of a card that wows you yet it sees next to now play currently. 
---
Secondly, a lot of the ‚Äúwow‚Äù cards, particularly DKs, were just toxic to the game. The year of the kraken and especially mammoth were so overpowered and littered with oppressive strategies. DKs killed any notion of a late game strategy other than DKs. Quests gave us Quest Rogue. Cube decks? Sure, these were fun, but I think most people will think back on oppressive cards during the mammoth year with disdain rather than nostalgia. I think we are finally this year getting to enjoy a very properly balanced meta. (Evolve being a nasty exception.) 
---
Anyways, like I said, this is all subjective so I respect your opinion. I am actually *more* upset that the client has languished because the cards themselves are finally supporting an incredibly healthy and fun standard game. Between Blizzards HK debacle and the continued inability to add the most basic of features to the client, I do fear that a truly great *game* will disappear as flashier more well-supported competitors such as MTG:A and LoR gain traction.
---
With the Quest Shaman meta, Sap is dead card a lot of time.
---
The 50% revenue drop probably isn't that far off. There is a reason why Team 5 was granted 20% additional devs this year.
---
Most don't know, you are right.
---
They must know, but the majority don't know.
---
A hit expansion huh...People come back to expansions to see if the game has improved, and to play new content If your suggesting that legendaries in legion were at all balanced and goood for the whole of the game?-then your wrong Playing a Demon hunter in legion i Didn't Get Anger Of The Half-giant until my last legendary which didn't help my LOGS to further my expierence playing the game
---
i can also go into BFA having such a mindless rotation Everybody Just looks at their Weak Auras And DBM You just focus on when your cooldowns come up and how to rotate them in each fight
---
Also its like they make their money for the next expansion off of that  6 month subscription offer that gives you a mount. it just devaluing the concept of collecting mounts when you pay a subscription already I expect  my subscription money to go into them creating conent that anybody can obtain. is that not a fair thing to ask?
---
My point is A large portion of the player base is not happy with these short term advantages Or how blizzard conducts marketing Strategies as the player base debates on not coming back to the game
---
So do you plan to count all these players that got tricked into a 6month sub to only stop playing the game 2 months later when they are stuck at a wall when trying to gear out??
---
Its incredible that i even debate comming back to new expansions and I try really hard at wow too at launch of the expansion
---
i've put so much time into BLIZZARD in particular just to Hit a wall when gearing out,  into mythic raids its frustrating i hope people can see this
---
Blizzard only does well on a commercial standpoint, while the playerbase just hopes they improve
---
This brawl is so bad, the person rotating counter clockwise (to the right, as per Blizzard) has a MASSIVE advantage... and then they lock a pack behind 100 dreadsteed summons :(
---
People can‚Äôt protest everything and involve themselves with activism all the time. However when something happens at your workplace, or say with your hobby that sheds light to some sort of injustice, it‚Äôs normal to begin getting more involved with the politics involving that aspect of your life.
---
I don‚Äôt watch nba so I just sit at the sidelines when it comes to then, but when it comes to hearthstone which is My Hobby I feel compelled to protest, educate myself on the Hong Kong and I nvolve myself in general.
---
I‚Äôm not faking interest in the Hong Kong  situation, I just involve myself right now because I happened to stumble upon it threw my hobby, hearthstone.
---
30 webspinners and 30 raven idols might be worse. But this is certainly the least fun mechanic they‚Äôve ever introduced
---
So you called him out for wanting to do activities that this entire sub is about?
---
I really love when the game lets you win via funky mechanics no one anticipated. It feels like an old-school Nintendo cheat code.

It happened to me with godfrey..

Yes, same for me as well. Old special portraits do work, I just played one with Tyrande.
---
Are you trolling? Do you really not see the difference between what Zephyrs does and what pretty much every other Discover card does?
---
Is Hearthstone your first card game? I don‚Äôt think you understand how design space works, both in terms of making sure there‚Äôs enough and making sure to not squander it. Hearthstone‚Äôs card design should continue as its currently progressing and not focus on shallow design space and flash over substance like you seem to want.
---
And saying ‚Äúeveryone dislikes‚Äù the latest dungeon runs is ridiculous. People complained about it and then there were dozens of posts a day for a few weeks and still people posting about it every day.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre just burned out and want things that just seem fresh no matter how good or bad they actually are for the game so that the game can seem new again. But it‚Äôs not a new game.

Thanks! I'll check if I have these cards!

Honest question: if in a situation you have to concede to prevent harm to your kid, do you still feel anger about this concede afterwards? Just checking psychology here xD

How are people still supporting this game when the company is a piece of shit
