I feel like there's some value to it being a live stream. It adds some sort of authenticity to it and if it were pre-recorded and edited people would scream how fake it is and how it's tailored to make "shit" cards look cool. They obviously try to make them look cool now, too, but when the person playing sees the card supposedly for the first time and they talk about their decision to try to make the card shine, it's adds a certain layer to it that a recorded session would lack. 
---

---
Thay's not saying I don't see the benefits of a recorded reveal( especially since the chat on YouTube war disabled) , but I see the appeal as well.
---
---
---
And a good supply of weapons. 
---
I didn't watch, nor have I seen much of the drama, though I saw some complaints in another thread.
---
Just know, 99% of people likely didn't care. Only the loudest complain. Ignore the internet - it brings out the worst in people.
---
WoW isn’t in a very good place right now and it’s probably better for blizzard to keep the two games more or less separate 
---
\&gt; Expecting consistency from Blizzard.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1118
---
Plus it does nothing when you're at full health, which will happen pretty quicky if you're running a deck with enough healing to bother with the glass knight
---
&gt; quickly
---
Why do people always put this word into their backseat developer comments?
---
Creating a fully-stable fully-tested deployment doesn't take some trivial amount of time. It takes almost all of it.
---
Running a demo off of an older snapshot is likely to create more problems than it is to fix, as most of the changes since that snapshot are going to be bug fixes you'd like to include.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
you play this
---
2dmg + skill command 5 + arcane shot 4 + hero power 2
---
2dmg + 2dmg hero power
---
basically 5 cards for 30 damage 
---
I watched it just today with my friend. It was a little off but seriously the internet is blowing it way way wya off the rails. Good games. Nice 3/2! Also great job on thinking on your toes and randomly generating lackys via the admin prompt!
---
Is it just me, or does this look like a custom fan made card? The art just looks like a random picture they slapped on there.
---
All these people taking about potentially useful but bad legendaries when the game has amgam rager, savagery, the 7/6 ogre that can't attack properly for 6, way too imaginative.
---
Just start with renounce darkness.
---
oondasta + thor idal combo?
---
It wasn't and I got Leeory out of the Frozen Champion for lethal lmfao
---
This is what frustrates me. I didn't care for Cora's style, but thats just my taste. I don't much care for watching a number of popular content creators online. It doesn't make Cora bad for me to not care for it.
---
And the lashing out against Cora gets jumbled into the valid criticism of blizz's shit QA. Blizzard needs to make this style of apology post and squarely say: We failed to demonstrate an attractive product because our code was shit. 
---
I didn’t watch the stream, but seeing you out here, communicating with the people, I wish the HS team had even a quarter of your communication and outreach.
---
Good job!
---
Even as a casual deck you need to draw 3 different legendaries and 1 regular card. meaning that you are likely to have to draw all or almost all of your deck to get them.
---
here i thought that was a beefy nigga with a robe and not a giant fucking roach/beetle hybrid
---
Premiers are a thing on Twitch.
---
Neither is this game
---
Nah, they typically completely forget about these things in between expansions. Except discover. That's the only new concept that's still around.
---
It is fairly Intuitive, though. 
---
Oof then you are not gonna be happy to hear what I'm doing right now.
---
Wow, I am glad I am purely a Wild player.
---
This happens all the time in reveal season. People overreact to the early cards shown. Then become more measured as the cards keep rolling in.
---
I remember that one time when Ticking Abombination was one of the first cards shown and people LOST THEIR SHIT. You wouldn't believe the overreaction on this sub about that card. It was only because the timing of the release.
---
On turn two coining out a 1/5 and getting two good cards out of it that are instantly usable seems really nice.
---
Anyone else think it's odd that the buff effect gets to be called "Leader of the Pack" but the summon a panther effect is just "Summon a Panther"? 
---
I've been called a lot of things but eye candy isn't one of them. Thanks for the compliment!
---
Is this going to be any good without Zul'Jin?
---
Thanks for coming on the subreddit and typing this up.  Some of the criticism may have been hard to read, but I appreciate you tackling it head on.
---
my bad I meant season 8 that’s when they had all the surveys asking what people were playing 
---
Blavk guard is amazing in my healadin OTK tho
---
Idk how you handle these guys every day. They're rowdy.
---
&gt; You aren't the only audience.
---
I don't think anyone uninformed about Hearthstone would also want to watch (or even know about) a card reveal livestream. 
---
For what a random stranger's opinion is worth, I genuinely enjoyed you on the reveal stream. You were funny, insightful, charismatic, and made it a lot better than it should have been given all the technical difficulties. You're a great commentator and not at fault for any issues the stream had.
---
Alright I missed that but honestly, how often do you get to the point where the opponent has no silence, no divine shield, no mage ping and no spells? And even then you need to be wounded to have it work.
---
Literally every single Ragnaros voiceline that isn't the original card
---
I play wild exclusively and I love all these new combinations that come out, old cards interacting with new cards. Also I don't have to say goodbye to playing with a card just because a certain amount of time has passed, or Blizz deems it too OP and retires it.
---
As i said, they were cabable of insanely explosive openers that could end games at turn 6. But they also only played two copies of a one drop and of a two drop respectivley, and nothing else for early game. I would not call that a fast deck
---
 Insanebob#1173 Trading 80g quest in NA. You first 
---
Yeah my holy paladin deck just got a big buff.
---
Yeah, honestly that boomship Malygos warrior looks better 
---
&gt;  (in addition most nerfed cards that go to wild end up getting unnerfed)
---
God I wish they would do this. 
---
Gnomey
---
If you think thats bad just look at discard warlock
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not very often if at all.
---
Hi Cora thanks for taking the time to address people's concerns, it definitely took guts to write this.  
---
My only issues with the stream were the misplays and slow play, which you already addressed under point 1 so I have no other concerns.
---
I agree that there was certainly a select group that were making a lot of sexist comments but I greatly appreciate you taking the high road and not just using that as an excuse to invalidate and and all critiques. 
---
I watched one yesterday and it was nothing but excuses why he under or over rated cards. 
---
True. Not Her fault the stream wasnt interesting. Somehow tho you wouldnt have such A problem
---
The mad man!
---
I was going to break this down, and agree with you at the end, but... Going off that screenshot, it's less than a day ago. Which means you're overlooking the part where some people chose to make it about her gender first. In that light, she's acknowledging that people fault her purely on gender, while also trying to move away from the gender card by not actually saying it outright
---
Needs more upvotes than it got so far. Good work
---
With keeper, you can immediately summon two jade idols, and save the shuffle card in your hand for later use with auctioneer. Seems crazy good to me
---
I use the random deck completion now for casual to do quests but I have an almost 0 collection beyond whatever decks I run for my monthly rank 5.  Thus I end up with some rather strange decks but it's fun to try make them work.  
---
With the new auto complete tool though this probably leads to far more people ending up with top end decks in casual if they do something similar and have a good collection.  
---
surprised we have yet to see more complaints about meta decks in casual.  
---
You know what is the worst part of this? The flavor of equipping a bow and then smashing your face into a minion.  It might have been OP, but this should have a candleshot-like immunity, or even an animation of shooting a projectile
---
Always. 
---
Wait, people were seriously complaining you made some misplays? 
---
I don’t understand that mindset at all. What is even the point of getting upset about someone *else* making a mistake in a video game?
---
Hall of Frame it
---
? They played two Troggs and two spirit claws minimum, which is at least four one drops, alongside two Golems and Flametongues as well as Thalnos at the very minimum, which is five two drops by my reckoning.
---
This is inherently false.  
---
Hunter ONLY has rexxar on turn 6 when playing against hunter, when you play as hunter - you never get it on 6.  
---
Same goes for spellstone - you never get that and 2 x secrets by turn 6 if you play as hunter. Play against hunter - happens everytime (though how we fit Rexxar into there - not sure).  
---
Also when you play against hunter they ALWAYS have dire mole turn 1 and crackling razrormaw turn 2. This never of course happens when you play as hunter.  
---
See the trend here? Feels bad man.  
---
A couple of the later cards already have card art for both choices (Feral Rage definitely has them), but yea a lot of the classic cards will get new art. 
---
I plucked this from a Chinese site last night, here are all the [Choose One spells](https://i.imgur.com/8ObOWek.jpg).
---
Playing Khadgar the same turn as Medivh is a great way to get it killed before you get any value from it.
---
Maybe in your opinion, but it never was a T1 deck, and there are and were much more degenerate combos than mill. There’s a lot of decks that get wrecked by it also, which makes it completely fair. I thought it was fun to play against and even funnier to get killed out.
---
It's a fun deck. I like the Keleseth version, where you play him after you do the quest. Of course it doesn't really work well... But fun. 
---
I don't think odd is the right word i think lazy is the correct word. However give +1/+1 wild be an odd card name. But they could have made up some name for the panther. Even just calling it call panther would have been better than summon.
---
I watched it and didn’t think you were bad. But I also knew you from watching you commentate all of these years. I think a lot of people are just used to the high energy- my problem was with the third guy- it was just way too many people.
---
this is the most ignorant and /r/iamverysmart kind of comment in this thread. everything you said in this post is wrong. and you call thousands of people idiot on top of it.
---
&gt; Nothing anyone will ever do will satisfy online gaming communities, and apologizing just opens you up to new critiques.
---
yes it does. when they do something good, most people approve. and apologizing is not a weakness, it's a great virtue that everyone should try to do more.
---
&gt; Engaging with them only gives them the false idea that their opinion actually matters.
---
their opinion actually matters. i don't know why this is shocking for you but players' opinion matters.
---
&gt; They're going to consume the product either way because it's what creates their identity.
---
the people who consume the product no matter what don't even care what's going on about it and probably very small minority even at this sub and i am pretty sure almost none of them are aware of this discussion. just a few days ago there was a post about how revenues dropped, so i guess people will not buy the product no matter what. AND buying things is not even related to this topic at all.
---
Wait, it's possible to get Blood of TAO?
---
If nothing else, the game would be significantly more expensive
---
I don't think it will. If bombs become a thing, this makes it extremely punishing if you draw your deck.
---
Plus, naturalize is getting HoFed, they lose sooo much armor. Even the Warlock version will lose out on most of its healing. So... as of right now, I don't think there will be much for allowing it. Save for hunter... but good luck to Hunter drawing all of their deck XD
---
Hakar
---
I'm guessing it has to do with the way the text appears on the card. They're getting more cognizant of that.
---
What song? Another huffer??
---
Yeah imo the worst part of the stream was the beginning where that dude basically made blizzard look like a charity case. Then the bugs. Then kinda the misplays and over communicating with Peter if I’m being real nit picky but who cares. Blizzard shoulda thrown someone in there who knew how to lead a card reveal like that and direct the plays and talking points. You were fine, you’re interesting and honest you just needed better support. blizzard handled this very poorly that’s all it points to. 
---
Can anybody be used in the place of "nobody" in this context?
---
Sounds like a Tavern Brawl mode and an entirely different game.
---
So it does matter what the weapon costs?
---
Thekal -&gt; Zola?
---
Well I imagine this will make a nice addition to zoo. 
---
Honestly this community (like most gaming communities) just has a problem with women, try not to take it personally. 
---
Just a note, I noticed and appreciated the hovering!
---
Twitch chat is like a coked-up pile of overexcited children with the hive mind of a senile old man guiding them, throwing shit at the walls every five seconds, shouting unintelligibly, before finally collapsing in a big ball of piss and drool.
---
&gt; I'm assuming that the devs don't want to confuse people
---
That’s the most amazingly delicious part. Did the devs really think starting it off at a different number would be too confusing? This is a real mind-bender of a card.

The missing link for the unicorn mage
---
You speak Greek? I noticed your surname, but just assumed it was due to immigration background like &gt;98% of Americans.
---
I just want to note that playing six 6 mana cards over the course of a game (two from Zuljin) makes your cards that cost 4 or less more important in order to spend as much mana as possible.
---
Does anyone know if Multi-Shot is cast by Zuljin even if the opponent only has one minion? You can't cast it yourself unless they have at least two.
---
Mitch Hedberg was great.
---
Chef Nomi's effect doesn't change with Khadgar on the field, but I guess they would technically interact
---
Your cards that summon minions is pretty clear. Playing a minion from hand would be "play" and not summon.
---
Yep. You'd end up with 3 copies of your minion.
---
I think there was already a painting of Baku in that pose.
---
Maiev was never for sale. She was the free hero for Ungoro.
---
You're too afraid to make a mistake.  You're looking for consensus from the other people in the room before making a decision.  This slows the stream down so much.  Then you rope and panic and misplay.  
---
Next time, if there's no new cards that you just got, wait to talk until it is the opponent's turn.  
---
The jurassic park never fails to me laugh, i gotta say
---
I’d say it only works on things summoner by other cards, not the minions you play from hand. Also it sounds like the effect would multiply but really it’s a coin flip rn, plus it’s legendary so the odds are slim
---
I think you are overthinking this.  All summoned cards are played but not all played cards are summoned.  Played means you manually select it from hand, pay the cost if any, and play it on the board.  Summoned covers all other cases.
---
The ordering of double Kadgars is interesting because some cards like Brann Bronzebeard has set limits (twice) and this one is doubled.  In practicality it is an issue of 4 vs 5 minions (board space).  That would be an interesting Disguised Toast test.
---
Sorry, I am not finding myself confused about all this.
---
Khadgar is a simple concept. If you have a card that summons a minion, it triggers twice. So... if I have a card that says "Deathrattle: summon 3 spiderlings" it will become 
---
1st trigger - the deathrattle summons 3 spiderlings.
---
2nd trigger - khadgar triggers the effect again
---
- the deathrattle summons 3 spiderlings.
---
I now have khadgar and 6 spiderlings on the board.
---
Pretty sure we will se the animation pop twice :P
---
Khadgar is "summon twice as many" as well.
---
I always get happy when I get him early because that means I can't face him later on. 
---
Don't think it was ever confirmed, but the male singer in the Witchwood trailer sounded alot like Harry Partridge.
---
Got to look out for that 9 burst damage from skill command on turn ten now
---
Yes, Star's fury is legendary hunter weapon and Vereesa is a hunter I believe
---
would prolly have to a legion expansion and demon hunter hero cards instead of death Knights to match that.
---
One part of it is that aggro, by the nature of the archetype, doesn't need legendaries. Legendaries tend to be more mid to late game cards, because many of them are game winnng cards, or enable a potential for winning the game. The goal with aggro is to chip away at the opponent's health before they can make the best use of those cards.
---
In simple terms, aggro is meant to stop the other person before they can make best use of legendaries, which makes aggro legendaries often times superfluous, or overpowered
---
The argument applies to cards players have had the chance to play with and not cards yet unreleased. 
---
Reveal stream's purpose is specifically showcasing the new cards. You guys seemed to forget that during the stream. I think that's where it went wrong. The technical issues to top off that is just unfortunate.
---
Not a hater and i don't want to disrespect you. Your commentary was okay, but it felt short with the lack of charisma that kibler or day 9 had. 
---
Roping everyturn is okay, I mean, the whole point of the stream is to talk about the new cards. But it was like if you were trying so hard to overhype every single lesser card and you didn't had time to really make your plays and almost everytime they were bad. What's the point of the gameplay showcase if you are just going to talk about the cards but you are not going to really show them in action?
---
I would put a second cutlass and tinkers sharpsword oil... also counterfeit coin is good especially since u run auctioneer. You could also replace the firefly with something like swashburglar that has better synergy with ur deck 
---
And the voice of Rexxar, Aluneth, Nefarian, Chrom, Eder, Aloth, Joker (from Persona 5) and many, many more.
---
Also - Godlike DM.
---
Hey Cora!  It seems I'm late to the party and this isn't exactly an AMA but I'll pose my question anyway:
---
Do you think HS cannibalizes itself too much?  One of the most successful expansions ever was Knights of the Frozen Throne where they finally gave us the Lich King and the Death Knights.  Personally I think these were a negative step from a game design standpoint but they were a massive win as far as pulling casuals in.
---
You mentioned getting fired up for callback cards which is a sentiment I don't echo at all.  This game is 5 years old, nostalgia has no place here.  On top of that, we just revisited Dr. Boom 8 months ago! 
---
So, to you, and to those you know who work in design, do you think HS draws from its own well too often?
---
In a vacuum though this is a great combo. You gotta remember it has lifesteal. Destroys aggro, and always needs a spell (or mage) to remove. 6 mana for 4 trade-invincible-attack is pretty powerful too.
---
If the twinspell is playable otherwise I guarantee the knight will be added with it. Admittedly it seems very weak.
---
Make that into a card and post it for 12 karma
---
Love that card. I use it in my paladin deck, but there's quite a few variations online with other classes. Well done!
---
What is your point?
---
Play mid range hunter then most of the time you should be able to finish them off turn 5.
---
To me wild seems like "play big priest or some hyper aggro that's fast enough to beat big priest". I'd like  to be wrong though
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
I made a miracle tesspionage and spiders worked really well as an alternate win cond. With enougj of them, and the massive deck u get, ya cany be outvalued
---
I am glad they are having fun, they also should have thought about.. you know.. entertaining their viewers at least sometimes
---
It's not a double battlecry effect so the only thing that would probably happen is Khadar's effect trigger animation, unless it doesn't trigger with a full board
---
Hes lost some weight.
---
Massive fucking respect for standing up Cora. I thought the stream was a dumpster fire but my take on you personally Cora, as a caster and professional, has just improved. 
---
how dare he insulat your whaman
---
Losing 99% of the time is fun for you?
---
Again which is why it shouldn't be live. A live demo of anything has risks, but if it's not even the actual platform, it's going to be way buggier.
---
Do any of us care if what they show is a "Scripted" game? Where they tried a few games and showed us the one that had that great moment that showed off a new card? Why are they not doing that in the first place?
---
I thought the reveal stream was rather good. 
---
The technical problem with lackeys was bit annoying, but that wasn't in your control. Seeing the devs come up with a good workaround solution on the fly was exciting. But as others have said the live aspect seems unnecessary and could have just avoided the whole issue with prerecording.
---
It was rather long stream so moving bit faster with plays in future seems like decent suggestion. The stream really doesn't require co-op aspect and it's more fun watching the guest struggle a bit with all the new cards.
---
Having new people do some of the reveal streams is fun. I think Blizzard choosing you made perfect sense.
---
All and all, you did a great job. Don't be too harsh to yourself regardless what the Internet says. 
---
PS. At least you didn't burn Gul'dan.
---
If he played Gonk Druid the pattern of the lines would be upside down, no?
---
I was able to guess the card text by looking at the card, so thumbs up in terms of design. Other than that, not impressive, but it's decent
---
I did honestly think I was seeing things wrong when it said 4 mana.
---
Couldn't you argue heistbaron calls back to Marin the fox as well?
---
Could this work in conventional murloc decks? Or maybe Blizzard is aiming for some sort of Beast/Murloc hybrid under Hunter?
---
u/LilHoneyDips gave a very good advice, although the dust gain is even bigger. Disenchanting a golden Legendary gives you 1600 dust and a golden Epic gives 400 dust. So if you don't have Genn or Baku or the rotating Epics, craft them now and cash in after rotation, which happens 9th of April. 
---
First craft the Legendaries golden, since that has the best gain. You'll need a whopping 12 800 dust to craft all epics &amp; legendaries golden, but if you don't have that kind of amounts, just use all dust you can spare, normal copies are also just fine. You'll get the crafting cost back 1:1 and if you don't intend to use those cards in Wild, you'll make a profit for the regular dust value. 
---
Here is all the info regarding the rotation crafting/dusting. Do ask if there is something you don't understand or need clarified: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall\_of\_fame\_craftdust\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/)
---
And really, do not craft anything else right now. Nobody knows what will happen after rotation. 
---
This deck is from YouTube right? I played it too for some time
---
It's a solid arena card. Basically deal 2 damage for 2 mana and summon a 1/1 body. Will probably never see the light of constructed however.
---
Keep the custom cards in customhearthstone, especially during reveal season
---
The powerlevel isnt that much lower.. they just stopped printing endless value machines like rexxar etc.
---
So it still makes sense to compare those cards. They doo not ignore that those cards rotate out, its just a baseline for comparison.
---
Another cheap rush minion for Rexxar in wild
---
Why wouldn't it? Atiesh summons the minion, it should definitely summon twice as mine
---
surprising solid for the mana cost from a neutral common. Could even see some constructed play if the tags end up mattering. (masters call comes to mind) but it most likely not quite good enough.
---
Change the flair to news
---
I suspect a 3/3 is one and a half times as good as a 2/2, but don't quote me on this!
---
I don’t know how you make the correlation that this sub overblows things when you see the year over year hearthstone decline that was just released. Blizzard is killing this game fast.
---
Yeah, you are right.
---
The difference is, riot recognized it in time and did change a lot of things. (The game is literally a different one every season)
---
Blizzard has maybe (?) recognized it, but their solution is to put in more ranks :D for the casuals. Noone wanted this or cares about this.  Thats the only thing they implemented for years. Dont know what their thinking... Whats the motivation for the OG players in Hearthstone? There isnt much... They need to change things. After hitting Legend, the Laddersystem is just so boring i cant tell. Im just sad for Hearthstone, cause i loved this game
---
you must keep controlling a lackey tho
---
Done, thanks.
---
It won't work because it has both a keyword and a deathrattle effect, so it won't appear on the DK Rexxar pool 
---
Seems pretty decent. Murloc synergy with a decent stat line and rush? It’ll probably see play.
---
I have hope for boom warrior it seems a lot of fun too! just a bit sad about dr booms scheme 
---
I mean yeah not every card is going to be used but what’s the point of printing specifically garbage cards for the sake of garbage, besides diluting the pack opening pool. Of course it’s not easy to balance every card perfectly but then again just saying some cards don’t see play doesn’t really justify printing bad cards
---
I'm thinking about it and isn't this card actually pretty good relative to the current power level of the 2-Drops we have now?
---
It trades favorably into 3/2s and evenly against 2/3s. It gives class that lack early game removal some options that they didn't have before. For example Paladin should be able to make use out of this because it can remove early threats as well can place a sticky minion on board for buffs.
---
I think this card will be in a lot more decks than you would expect. 
---
That's legitimate paranoia. Kind of scary. 
---
That's the point isn't it? OP is complaining about reviews that compare new cards to card that are rotating out, and the guy I replied to is saying that's valid
---
Bluegill is crying in a corner.
---
Seriously though, bluegill was included in every aggro murloc deck, and this is a straight better card in any non-murloc deck, so I will be surprised I this sees no play in aggro.
---
Also, check the cute art in the bingo
---
Malygos is Goose. Plural is Geese. 
---
Just seemed easier to type than Malygoses
---
It's rotating out of standard at least though
---
Dont talk to me or my son ever again.
---
My point is you have to draw all of these components and more before you can myra’s and rogue typically doesn’t have good enough ways of stalling if some of these cards happen to be at the bottom of your deck
---
Uhhh, that's a retake on the weird Beast-Murloc synergy stuff we got some while ago. We had Menagerie in Karazhan and things like Sated Threshadon or more notably the Gentle Megasaur in Un'Goro. Unexpected theme to touch upon. It's also almost a reskinned Murloc Tidehunter, but slightly more proactive.
---
This guy is ok in powerlevel. He is kinda like that one Lackey that deals 2, but with two added tribal tags and collectible, which increase the mana a bit. We haven't seen that one in play, obviously, but this should be alright as removal for removal starved classes and provides some potential synergy in Hunter, because of the beast tag, or Murloc decks, because of the deathrattle. Not good, not great, probably not constructed worthy right now, but passable.
---
Ah, you are the reflect damage warlock and I'm 5 damage when hurt paladin... okay, I didn't want to play this run.  Honest.
---
Different games, different designs. 
---
Legends in MTG often have powerful passive effects that would be nuts if you could stack them and others are just strong creatures that are just a bit overstatted. 
---
In hearthstone you have a lot of legendaries that have strong ballecries so you could just trade them and play the second copies or ones like malygos that have incredibly strong, unique effects but are balanced because if you base your deck around them you need to draw the 1x card for the deck to go off.
---
Most of the time you will be using it as I stated. Call it 5% of the time you use it to kill a minion with 0 attack and 20% of the time you play it on an open board (not ideal, a 2/1 for 2 that summoned a 1/1 would see no play).
---
So call it 75% of the time you use it to deal 2 damage to an enemy minion and leave a 1/1 chilling.
---
Fun for battlecry party rogue, also good in a value shudderwock deck. 
---
... Or bombs. A lot of bombs.
---
Nope! But they do look similar. This bug’s a Qiraji repping C’thun like those found in the AQ raids from vanilla. The first boss of Azjol Nerub is a Nerubian which *were* independent until they were conquered by the Lich King and raised into undead. 
---
I feel like Nerubians may be associated with Yogg-Saron given they’re subterranean and the other two Old Gods we’ve actually seen had bug armies (Qiraji for C’thun and Mantid for Y’Shaarj) but I can’t remember if that’s laid out in-game
---
Play Brann first and you can shuffle 8 bombs.
---
As a woman who works in the games industry it feels so good seeing another woman with the courage to publically confront your mistakes (though I think you did great!) while also calmly standing up for yourself against bullshit accusations. More power to you!
---
Took you this long?
---
It’s just a shame it’s really inconsistent since you can get fucked by draws
---
Plus potential beast and murloc synergy+ summon synergy (knive juggler) + token killing synergy (new warloc/druid) + it can stay alive if it deals damage to a 0 health minion, or is played on an empty board + theoretical deathrattle synergy. 
---
youre favoured to lose if all your core cards are at the bottom of your deck lol, regardless of your ability to stall
---
rogue does have the ability to draw with cards that arent myra's unstable element
---
Face is the place
---
Heal zoo can do better turn 1's.
---
Spikeridged Hog
---
I mean, if that's the case (don't remember it to be honest), it IS sort of a proof, but a) it's old and b) things don't always work like the devs say they do. So I'd still say that it's safe to wait until making statements saying that the card will or won't be included in the pool, because we have no in-game proof.
---
He uploaded on Youtube first, there's no english version image. So I upload Korean one.
---
3~4 minutes later, he showed english version on Stream.
---
Korean reveals never showed english version before this, so it was very unexpected.
---
I know you want to show English version as possible, but I tried to find English one too until very last time to upload this.
---
So I understand why you're saying, but honestly, it's bit unpleasant for me.
---
I'm almost certain this won't see play in combo decks. It's stronger in decks with strong deathrattles/battlecry imo. 
---
And if you don't face against OTK decks, you face overpowered face/aggro decks. Wondrous.
---
There's a giant moon eating snake in Filipino myth called the bakunawa. 
---
Please give the card texts in these kind of posts. These are new cards and we don't have everything memorized yet.
---
I had to follow a second tab in order to read up on the cards.
---
Mecha'Thun does not work is this case, unless those cards were you two last, and you still have to kill Joybuzz &amp; the other minion (if it exists).
---
**Laughs in Mass Hysteria**
---
This! Obviously a powerlevel reset year will be no motivation for a monetary investment. 
---
Thanks fpr posting and also thanks to OP. 
---
We need some reason up in here. 
---
its kinda unfair to use the 'core cards at the bottom of the deck' scenario since most decks favoured to lose if their core cards are at the bottom of their deck anyway, stall or not
---
rogue does have plenty of draw power regardless
---
:D
---
60% of the time it works everytime.
---
Nah you just have to hold one in hand until you play Togwaggle.
---
There are 13 minion slots. 7 when there are an odd number of minions on the board and 6 different ones when there are an even number of minions on the board. 
---
I tested cathedral gargoyle during the witchwood meta and was amazing, the problem with this card wasn't exactly this card, last year were so few dragons and many of them barely playable that the gargoyle didn't have good enough activators, but that can change with the dragon support paladin is getting, hoping for nozdormu or anachronos as one of the paladin legendary minions. 
---
This was a legendary bow that dropped from Kil'Jaeden in the Sunwell in TBC. I don't know if Hunters were out of meta, or if it was more due to internal guild policies or over-adherence to DKP systems, but many guilds did actually give this weapon to Rogues. Even if they couldn't make use of the weapon damage, it did have great stats for them. This did cause a lot of drama back in the day and I'm pretty sure at least one guild disbanded over it. 
---
People weren't just skeptic, they were straight hating on blizzard for pushing the archetype and adding "useless" cards to hunter
---
He never attacked when he had an even number of minions? 
---
Yes it does, it says Hearthstone had a 300% increase in 2017. If you watch the video Kibler even states Hearthstone earned 1.4 billion itself.
---
Not with the cards revealed so far.
---
You were the kid that would always leave my n64 controllers covered in cheeto dust weren't you?
---
Isn’t that the wrong play order for the combo? Wouldn’t you want Brann &amp; Elekk on the board first?
---
Again , that was just my subjective opinion like his.
---
That's not what the screenshot says.
---
And tea you shall have
---
# ME GO FACE 
---
Just stats have seldom been great in anything above midrange (which this card is, as it's very slow)
---
Still it has potential along with the other just-in revealed dragon card and the 2/2 gargoyle from the witchwood. Especially that gargoyle is an extremely strong card. If you can consistently hit the dragon-requirement it is the strongest 2 drop that ever saw play (yes, stronger than Totem Golem).
---
There's some good neutral dragon synergy already in standard.
---
**Paladin Dragon Control?**
---
The biggest synergy between Paladins and Dragons isn't the synergy itself, but they way that Dragons and Paladin Control decks work together. The flexibility, value and sheer power of Paladin spells and expensive Paladin minions matches greatly with the power and value of Dragon cards. With this additional Dragon-tribal synergy an archetype of Paladin Dragon Control can become a serious contender for a top-tier control spot IF the meta allows control decks to exist.
---
I wouldn't call it lazy, I personally enjoy it when old characters that have rotated out reappear in a different form. 
---
I don't know much about lores but I played hearthstone since it's release with a small break in between so it's a nice nostalgic thing for me 
---
But this is from 3 expansions ago. Surely no one expected this to be anywhere near viable after 3 whole expansions of dormancy? 
---
I think they said that keyword exclusions wont happen anymore
---
r/subsithoughtwerefake
---
Boring
---
do we get dust refunds for them automatically or do we have to manually dust them? 
---
Most of the cards that enable mechathun combos are rotating or moving to hall of fame (naturalise, blood bloom, ticking abomination). Remains to be seen if any new mechathun combos will be viable.
---
&gt; Look what it did.
---
It was garbage. then blizzard nerfed stuff and it became playable.
---
Yeah gargoyle is really good when it activates. It's a better shielded mini bot. I tried out even dragon paladin but I was putting trash in like the 3/4 that makes a weapon cost 2 less. 
---
5 mana 3/5 isn't tempo. 3 mana 3/2 isn't tempo either.
---
&gt; (which, as a common, will not be that rare)
---
Again, rarity no longer affects the card appearance rate in ANY way. There's now multiple "buckets" the cards are put into, the stronger the card, the less the bucket it's in will appear. Not only that, but when it does appear, it will be offered alongisde 2 equally strong cards so you have a choice to make. For example, it wouldn't be rare for you to have to choose between this, Tirion and Sunkeeper Tarim, since they're all (assuming this will be) in the highest bucket.
---
I'd say you'll get this card maybe once every 3rd draft if not less. But yeah, there's very little synergy to HS' arena still, if you see this card you probably just pick it.
---
This is almost purely for combo. Don't need to think about it in other ways really. 
---
At first I thought it was a joke about feeling dirty.
---
So then why do some cards that only generate 1 random card still use the word random? Look at the second highest comment here. [[Arfus]]

Honestly if this gets dragon paladin a thing, I could see 2x  Faerie Dragon being a thing. They become 2 mana 6/5 that can't be targeted by spells or hero powers.

It uses HS revenue for 2016 (395 million) and says it increased by 300% to 1.4 billion.

The CCG Market did not increase by 300% between 2016 and 2017, it earned about 1.25 million in 2016 as a total if you look here.

5 matches with 5 different decks would be better, but this was a stream with few cards so they should either play 3 or only show cards. When is the last reveal stream of the expansion they can show all the cards and play more games
---
If only Voone was a paladin card. Imagine buffing up a Ysera in hand multiple times and then Voone not only doubles the Ysera but also it's buffs. (I think Voone keeps handbuffs but I could be wrong)
---
It is simple - you play jepetto, draw Blood of the ancient one two times, you summon Blood of the ancient one and at the end of your turn you get the 🅱️ANCIENT ONE.
---
He fucking strikes again 
---
You so that yourself? Thats impressive. Well then i guess a normal wallpapers must so. Thanks Rania
---
Rarity doesn't really mean a lot in Hearthstone, other than normally legendaries have a "unique" effect 
---
Fucc hand buff
---
Ah so THIS is what RegisKillbin meant by Infinit Fireball Priest!
---
If you summon a 🅱️ancient One but you don't lethal with the 🅱️ancient One, did you really summon the 🅱️ancient One? 🤔
---
It's going to be really inconsistent in decks that cant immediately shuffle malys back tho. If you draw maly before this you're going to need another game plan as well. 
---
This is the communication we always asked, good job an this (and worry only about the gameplay, the other things are there only to complain more)
---
No, nobody ever expects cards that suck to become viable. But they always can and often do and when they do there always a bunch of people being like "oh no I disenchanted that card".
---
It's every expansion the same and I'm tired arguing to people that they shouldn't disenchant certain cards because the gained dust is pathetic and they can always become playable. And then when they eventually become playable everyone acts like "Well who could have guess" well nobody could have guessed that's why you don't disenchant in the first place.
---
But whatever, it's not my collection. I'm very sorry you gambled and lost.
---
Khadgar obviously won't do anything with minions that you play from your hand (except ones with summoning battlecries like Saronite Chain Gang) because YOU summon the minion, not a card. Khadgar works with cards that say 'summon \[minion\]' somewhere in their text, such as Mirror Image, Mirror Entity, Jan'alai, Unexpected Results, any deathrattle summons.
---
The only inconsistency I can really think of is Oondasta which says 'summon' but essentially means 'put into the battlefield'.
---
Probably never unsubscribed to the subreddit. Also, lots of people I know who quit still like to keep up with the new cards. See if there’s anything worth coming back to.
---
Blizzard wants first and foremost make money. A good way to do that is with the prerelease bundles. And the card reveals should indeed built up some hype as well as coax some people to buy the bundles themsevles.
---
But fortunatley its not all that hard to avoid any spoilers.
---
If you pulled out a minion with this, and then shuffled it back into your deck, would it be the 1/1/1 version or the normal version?
---
That little fucker is OP.

---
BRM was fun, I had a neat midrange dragon paladin going. I wish each class got an archetype and they just build on it. So many possibilities
---
I have no idea what the fuck you're on about.
---
I'm not fine with it
---
I'm sick and fucking tired of dragons being in every single set, there's absolutely nothing special about them anymore
---
You might want to reconsider reading comments about yourself in the internet. While some may have merit (or not), getting anonymous feedback from people who bear no responsibility for it rarely leads to anything but frustration. You might not feel it right now, but this kind of vile spout you read tends to sit in the corner of your memory and start whispering just when you don't need it.
---
No argument there. I’m excited to see what they’ll drop. But a lot of us were remarking on the fact that each year blizzard prints one dragon card for the Paladin class and that’s it 
---
Since there's no way in standard for Shudderwock to duplicate himself on board mid-battlecry, each time you play a Shudderwock beyond the first you'd need to still have a Shudderwock on board.
---
This only goes infinite via Baleful Banker's potential to infinitely shuffle copies. If you could somehow reliably shuffle two Shudderwocks into your deck (Baleful Banker both landing on Shudderwock + draw order not being awful), and use this card's battlecry to make at least one of them cost 1, you could then guarantee double Shudderwock shuffles even if your opponent board clears. Even with that combo, that can only go on as long as at least 1 Baleful Banker battlecry goes off before Jepetto Joybuzz's battlecry, otherwise you'd have two 9 mana Shudderwocks that you'd need to draw into naturally and hope the first lasts a turn.
---
&gt;Moorabi
---
6 mana 4/4 that can easily draw 2 card if you plan your deck around it. Bad card, but not a waste of virtual cardboard.
---
&gt; Lakkari Sacrifice 
---
Hard to make it work, but a decent and very enjoyable card.
---
&gt; The Runespear 
---
It has the lowest lows, with discovering only targeted spells and getting RNG trolled, but at least it's still a 3/3 weapon. In an ideal world, this might be the worst card ever printed, I do think Dr Boom's Scheme is in a comparable basket.
---
&gt; Duskfallen Aviana 
---
This one definitely is in contention for worst card ever printed or thought of. Way worse than the Scheme, or Runespear, or Harbinger Celestia. Duskfallen's only real respectable use case is dropping her when your hand is fairly filled up and your opponent is top decking without good card draw. So basically, the only time when Duskfallen contributes to you winning is when pretty much every other cards does so too (if your opponent is top decking and you've got a good hand, Duskfallen is better than Jeeves!).
---
Yeah if this is a combo meta I’m going to take a break from hearthstone 
---
Fingers crossed for you buddy.
---
This seems to line up with the [third set of the year](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/) having to do with the Bronze dragonflight
---
Oh boy, I can't wait to run Warmaster Voone in this deck - oh, god damnit!
---
Seriously, it seems like Blizz will jus randomly move a card from one class to another that was clearly intended for synergy.  Can you imagine if Voone had originally been a pally card?  Everyone would be going apeshit.
---
Let's see if we even get 2 or 3 warrior dragon cards to couple with Voone.  
---
Staleness amplifies
---
I too would like to know
---
That’s rng baby

Priest is not getting any Twinspell, we're stuck with Lackeys instead.

---
Oh, let them have their hope 
---
I follow your math but I don't think you're following mine. If I remove 20% of my cards, the meta viable (or any kind of) decks doesn't go from 10 to 8, it actually goes from 10 to 5 or 3. As you increase the collection size, the number of possible decks grows exponentially (technically faster than that since it's factorial, but close enough). To think about it another way, I could remove 15% of my collection and invalidate 100% of the decks I want to play. There isn't a linear relationship between cards in collection and decks, which is an important and false assumption of your math on value.
---
All of the above.
---
thought the art looked very familiar THANKS
---
There are people who say that Lazul is a tempo loss, while she actively draws you a card. This is a 3 mana 3/2 with a deathrattle that puts understatted minions in your hand.
---
We are getting a replacement for all the armour lost.
---
It's called Dr. Boom's Scheme /s
---
Indeed. Maybe something in the 2-3 mana range that lets you discover the evolution and add a copy of it to your hand?
---
You’re welcome 
---
Tbh he even kind of looks like Dane
---
I'm not saying you generate the language dynamically. You just have a database where each card ability's effect parameters are stored and you add a sentence with a free parameter like "%s: summon %d random lackey%s" and then when you want to put it on the card you go sprintf(cardString, triggerString, numLackeys, pluralS). Every card with whatever ability would always be worded the same and if it was worded differently you would **know** it's because it corresponds to a similar but slightly different ability in the database and so it might behave differently. 
---
There's also the 2 mana 2/2 discover a spell.
---
&gt;Bolf, Flame Leviathan, (new) Warsong Commander
---
While they aren't crazy stats, they're still decent minions. You don't feel nearly as bad playing a 3 mana 2/3 as you do playing a 4 mana Iron Skin...
---
&gt; Millhouse
---
This one is definitely bad though, and does join Duskfallen Aviana as a strong contender for worst card ever.
---
&gt; Temporus 
---
Had it been neutral it could've actually been a decent card, the only issue is that priest lacks tools to survive those 2 turns. Otherwise, it's more of a fun card than a competitive one, it's super flavorful and has a clear use pattern (that's hard to meet).
---
&gt; Cho 
---
Cho's in a similar basket where he's not strong, but he's usually not detrimental. At the end of the day it's often a 2 mana 0/4 : Copy a single spell from your opponent. like... Lorewalker Cho is no Millhouse or Duskfallen Aviana, or Shatter.
---
&gt;They're dooming this game to a slow, painful, creeping death
---
You know they're making an absolute shit-ton of money off this game right?  Why would they change what they're doing when it's accomplishing exactly what they want it to?
---
This is a strong contender for the worst card ever, along with Duskfallen Aviana and Millhouse.
---
someone photoshop Brode's face onto surprised pikachu...
---
Funnily enough 1 drops are pretty meaningless compared to past arena metas.
---
Have you not seen the Kripp-Yu-Gi-Oh video or the other guy that does the crazy Anduin videos?
---
Thankfully cube is rotating so at least don't have to worry about it in standard
---
I am aware that Activi$ionBli$$ard is making a shitload of money with this.
---
I do not care for their profits, I care for good games.
---
The game needs token creatures now. Setting stats to 1 just leads to broken interactions pulling from the graveyard. It needs to be a pure 1 cost 1/1 copy, burning the original. 
---
This current kind of style leads to too many broken interactions. It's Barnes all over again. 
---
This is a card that would be amazing if Dragon Pally existed.
---
That Darkness... did your opponent somehow generate it? Or evolved into it?
---
Yeah im out , blizzard is mentally ill
---
I was under the impression that it's still significantly higher than it was two years ago. Basically, the release of the Frozen Throne seems to have made Blizzard a Scrooge McDuck like bin of money, and then things returned to the previously established growth line. 
---
It is ,thanks.
---
It boils down simply to this combo decks are good for cardgames in general as it's a different style of win condition. However HS as a game allows for no Counterplay outside secrets on your opponants turn.
---
 In yu-gi-oh there are cards called trap cards which allow you to activate them on your opponants turn and allow you to disrupt thier play HS does not have this. 
---
The alternative is card's that disrupt your opponants hand or deck play like [[Dirty Rat]] [[Deathlord]] or [[Gnomefaratu]] but Blizzard say they don't want to print too many of those type of cards. 
---
The New Bomb's and Hakkar have made drawing cards more risky but whether thats enough remains to be seen.
---
OTK and Mec'thun only feel bad in HS as your pretty much forced to sit and watch as opposed to other games where there are ways and means of disruption.
---
So to conclude OTK can be fun and intresting but people will always hate playing against them untill some sort of counters are offered.
---
I watched a streamer using premium HS Replay, but she only used the mulligan for a specific match feature. 
---
Continuously fucking over the player base will lead to this game dying. Many big name streamers have already left, im sure more will soon.
---
People are starting to realize what a scam this game actually is. Literally a scam, built on enticing new players to spend money only for them to realize you have to spend a ton more.
---
The last single player expansion showed that more than ever. An rng based character selection screen for single player?? The only reason to do that is to get more value out of what little effort they already put into it
---
Oh fuck off

Cora, i admire how you've taken this bull by the horns and faced it eye to eye but i don't think it was your bull to fight.

In a way?

Thats kinda cringe not gonna lie
---
https://dotesports.com/hearthstone/news/mass-resurrection-revealed-for-hearthstones-rise-of-shadows-expansion
---
English source, it is different minions
---
Not auchenai though you dont want him resurrecting. Also holy nova is you know holy nova. Very low chances of wiping your opponent board. 
---
So the paladin legendary is most probably going to be based around Dragons.
---
again weird flavor as this is the first set from one of the villians that show the heroes. 
---
Probably won't do anything in standard since so much of priest is rotating (who knows they might just give priest scream 2.0 at this point) then precede to break the game in two expansions.  
---
Also they get the teamates that synergize with their shirne, and the teamates are broken as can be, 2mana 2/5, 4mana 4/6 especially when they play them on curve starting with exrta mana
---
You forgot to add in Lore Walker Cho on turn 2, that's where you get a nice curve
---
And my money is back in my wallet , fuck blizzard
---
YES!!!
---
ResidentSleeper 
---
It's different from spellstone as you can resurrect the same minion multiple times. The word "different" on the spellstone actually makes a huge difference here.
---
The 5 attack doesn't do shit in that deck, so does the 1 health. The elemental synergy also isn't there because you'd have to play Jaina, then next turn magma rager, then it would have to survive another turn and THEN you get to heal for 5.
---
Yeah it's shit in that deck and yeah it's a shit card overall and yeah it will probably never see play. Doesn't mean it can't ever see play.
---
&gt;  I think this is worse than spellstone
---
It is actually better, I hope they reprint eternal servitude now
---
Yep. It's the same in any Internet Community. People love to bitch behind the comfort of their keyboards. 
---
It obviously depends on your collection and the cards already in the deck. 
---
Yes sometimes a bad mechacthun deck is better than none. 
---
Yes sometimss there is no data/good data for a certain archetype. 
---
Yes it is clearly not perfect.
---
But no, it actually takes your cards into account.
---
Even adding just one card **can** completely chabge the suggestion (and i am not talking about genn/baku here. 
---
Everyone is kinda freaking out about this, but this card isn’t going to bring back any of the current resurrect decks. Wall priest loses Oakheart, which pretty much kills the deck entirely, along with Eternal Servitude, so we don’t be seeing many 2/14 taunts any longer. Clone Priest can’t even use this, as Radiant and Shadow visions rotate, so you can’t even use this with multiple spells. Unless you want to do something like rez Auchenai, Malygos and Velen, then play like regenerate/regenerate/holy smite or something, which seems unlikely.
---
Don't forget the weapon swing for 10 more damage.
---
I did a little research and those dragons are probably based on bronze flight from Wow and the legendary will be Anachronos, heir of Nozdormu, as we can see in day 29. 
---
Cursed
---
Am I crazy or....could this fit in big priest? 
---
How dare you
---
I wouldn’t say it’s strictly worse in every other aspect. It can resurrect the same minions, spellstone is unique only. 
---
I’d actually say it’s better in some cases where you would want to limit yourself to only a few minions. Thinking Velen/Maly combined after you’ve hit them a few times with Shadow Essence or another resurrect for a combo play. 
---
9 mana is very steep though... 
---
I cannot even figure out how to utilize the mulligan feature. Was it an overlay or something in the application itself? Apparently it is supposed to instruct on what turn to play cards and such as well. However, the only overlay I get is just basic deck information.
---
r/iamverysmart 
---
Fuck this card.
---
yea if he had next turn leaper its probably over unless you draw hellfire
---
No, you’ve misunderstood.  He’s fucking the Lich Kong’s horse, Invincible
---
Beautiful
---
This is a solid 10/10 card, you will learn to hate it. 
---
I’m torn between hating infinite value and agreeing that sounds cool af
---
You know I kind of disliked Zul’jin when he was initially shown because it was such a departure from existing heroes but I guess it would be a good solution to the infinite value problem to just have heroes like that which are mostly tempo plays...
---
They can indeed be burned. You don't draw a card until it enters your hand. If there's no room in your hand, it gets burned. 
---
This is it. It's inconsistent with combos, but very strong with battlecry, deathrattle and similar effects. It's going to be bonkers in shudderwock. I'm going to try it in dragon pally -- strong battlecries, 4/4 for 1 as opposed to 11/11 for 9... it makes sense. It's good that they're only doing this now that cube is leaving -- that could have been a disaster.
---
Wasn’t saying these would be able to replace Psychic Scream or anything. Just saying that Priest has some AOE left (and more than most classes)
---
Meat wagon in wall priest? That is pretty cool if I'm honest...
---
I enjoy all play styles the same but I gotta say, the worst kind of players are the ones who think the way they play is meaningful, and the way the others play is not.
---
Do you really think a Midrange Hunter could not produce a handful of “meaningful” questions that they typically ponder on a given turn?
---
It's terrible because you have 3 drops with 3/4, 3/5, 4/4 stats
---
Yeah the weird thing to me is that they’re pushing dragon pally while they also tried their best to push dragon warrior in rumble. The dragon warrior also has like half a deck that’s kinda viable if it had a decent dragon to round out the curve, but they’re not getting that instead getting a whole new bomb archetype. 
---
Why can’t these archetypes be a thing for more than one xpac?
---
Is an overlay? She checked directly from the page, but as i said, that was only for mulligans. 
---
yeah it does. so the correct play is: attack with hero to 1/4-&gt;attack to 2/2 ghoul with redband wasp, 8 mana left, hero power, 6 mana, hero power 4 mana. then probably woodcutters axe + amani berserker.
---
Okay, sure, but that's misleading because last year had an absolutely bonkers level of revenue.
---
Compared to YotK, HS revenue is UP.  Sure it went down to half of what it made for YotM, but that's because that was probably HS's peak and it's absolute most popular year, especially with the frozen throne tie in and all, where HS more than doubled its revenue.  If we ignore the outlier year, HS is still growing.

The problem with Wall Priest is the divine spirit not the resurrection

Hey drewtsmith, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
Call Dane, he's crying!
---
I hope that it will res Barneses only...
---
It's in the flavor of the event rather than specifically to the villians themselves. Could they have made this an evil thing? Sure but it doesn't bother me really. The main special mechanics are villian themed so good enough imo. 
---
I've seen some people saying it can pull duplicate minions unlike spellstone which if true could be interesting and by interesting I mean frustrating when they pull multiple velens
---
I'm a beginer programmer but the top comment is probably right.
---
I love your vids by the way :)
---
As I said, any 3 cost 3 attack card will always be tempo loss against a 3/4. ANY card will be a tempo loss against Hyldnir Frostrider. Ornery Tortoise is not a good card, ireelevant.
---
Regenerate doesn’t gain spell damage, sorry buddy.
---
&gt;People are starting to realize what a scam this game actually is. Literally a scam, built on enticing new players to spend money only for them to realize you have to spend a ton more.
---
You mean like any mobile game?
---
Obsidian Statue is going to wild too. Really right now the card doesn't look too good because all of the completely busted stuff is rotating.
---
other people have mentioned my favorite new player resources, and the basics. One thing I want to add is this: *do you want to be able to play every class and or deck* 
---
If no, pick which classes interest you, you can then use a *whole* class worth of cards as dust to craft things you want, and if no to "any deck" you can disenchant many bad cards and use the dust to get better ones
---
HOWEVER, if you think, down the line, that you might EVER want to play all the classes and meme decks, dont start with disenchanting a few classes, dont do it, it waste time and money (like I did) I went from 9 to 5 to 7 to 9 classwise and wasted so much fucking dust and money. I payed for packs, so I caught up, but if you want to go f2p or only spend a little, you cant be wasting cards.
---
next, do you think you might play wild? I recommend it, as any old cards can be used, so when stuff rotates it is still playable, but if you focus only on standard, you have less decks to worry about, and also you can disenchant old cards to buffer your current collection, this imo, is a fair trade off, so while I love wild, it makes enough sense to justify destroying old cards (where as id recommend keeping all 9 classes) 
---
finally, pm, ill add you and gift you some cards based on your answers, like maybe ill gift you some wild and standard card packs, or if you are skipping wild then I wont gift em to you. 
---
also, even if people went over it, "trump teachings" "deck teachings" are 2 great series, the first one teaches you how to play, the second shows you example decks of what was good in the past, which will help you build decks that do good by seeing what matters, also 2 videos, one is a joke, but important to know for the future, and one, while mtg deckbuilding, has a very important idea that a lot of players dont get, and is especially important when starting out: 
---

---
good luck, and welcome to our inn :)
---
It's different minions, it's been confirmed. 
---
Anyone who looked at the card should have known it would be extremely strong with a bit of support, the idea that bliss would print decent dragons is not exactly way out there.
---
It gains. How can you assume smth w/o even testing?
---
Ah ok, maybe I just need to play a few more games before it starts giving me some deck information. Currently it is not telling me anything in the page itself on mulligan information.
---
Thanks for responding!
---
Also handbuff push for the fourth time
---
Obviously it does. The deck tried to aggro you down and then mulliganed into Jaina control if it failed. But it's unplayable there because it's unplayable everywhere. Because it's pure garbage. Like tons of other cards. 
---
Wild players: am i a joke to you?
---
Nope

Hey Aldunas, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Yup, but seeing that Blizz is rolling out cards very similar to those that are rotating out makes me anxious about this element, too
---
I thought this was fingers and a lightsaber. 
---
Added flair :( 
---
Because I run regenerate in my clone priest deck buddy... it only gains Velen buff, no spell dmg. 
---
I agree; in control vs combo matchups, it can feel like there’s no match going on at all. The control player spends 10 turns doing nothing because the combo player isn’t putting anything on the board to control. By the time the control deck can play its late game threats, the combo deck has already drawn through half of theirs.
---
To me, it doesn’t feel like I’m playing Hearthstone during these matchups because there’s very little board interaction. And the win doesn’t feel great for either player imo; if the combo player won it feels like an assured victory that wasn’t earned. If the control player won it feels like luck. Either way I don’t enjoy these matchups. 
---
Ornery tortoise IS a good arena card in general. There are just some situations and classes in which it is not ideal to pick or play. 
---
Use screenshots damnit. /s
---
So were trippling up on big priest being an abomonation in wild forever then ?
---
I think they were just saying you would be playing all of them on the same turn, not necessarily in that order
---
Nvm
---
I am just glad, I did not pre-order. Now, Not gonna do it at all.
---
A real Barnes raiser.
---
What are you rezzing then immediately hitting with inner fire? 
---
I think people are overreacting to this card. Wild doesn't need it , it has better tools, and in standard there aren't as many ridiculous combos you can Rez.
---
It'll make a nice juicy board if you build your deck for it, but I really don't think it'll be good. 
---
Why wouldn't it work? You play Jepetto at any point in the game in your low minion count Mecha'Thun deck of choice. He draws Mecha'Thun and any other minion with a powerful draw/defensive effect and both of them get turned into 1/1s for 1 mana. You play until your deck and hand is empty, except Mecha'Thun and any damaging spell, that doesn't leave some token behind and you got yourself an OTK. 
---
When C'Thun went down he had to find a new job, don't hate!
---
Why the fuck are they reprinting an unfun mechanic that has been plaguing standard for the past 2 years? 2 more years of bullshit combo priest I guess.
---
I completely agree I think everyone is overreacting to this card. Wild has better tools and without radiant in standard there won't be any super crazy combos. 
---
If you built your standard deck to take full advantage here with only big minions your deck will suck
---
hero cards dont have to be infinite value though but i think future heroes shoudl atleast have more interesting hero powers then zuljin.
---
Even that is busted as hell. If you think you're facing combo or control, keep it in the mull and you're guaranteed to win.
---
I'm using Even Dragon Pally since a few days ago, it's pretty ok and fun. 
---
If only shit in big priest would stay dead.
---
Except for the mana cost, the aggressively slanted stats, and an important keyword, sure. But hey, you knew there would be a minion that summoned a murloc when it died.
---
You hate "RNG fiesta", but love a card that forces you to build an inconsistent deck that is highly dependant on drawing your single copies of cards?
---
If you haven’t yet, definitely look up how to set up a mana curve, and it will help a lot in figuring out how to build strong decks with the cards you have.
---
I can also strongly recommend playing Mage in the beginning! Go with whatever class you enjoy, but when I started out I really loved Mage’s immediate access to “draw cards” effects and the spell [[Polymorph]], which helps deal with opponents who have that one lucky Legendary minion that would otherwise give them a cheap win.
---
wow I didn't know that :o 
---
Even though that is such an edge case scenario I'm surprised I hadn't noticed/encountered it until now. Ty for informing me 🙇‍♀️

4/-/- | Transform a minion into a 1/1 Sheep.  
---
What's wrong with arena on mobile? The buttons there and I can go into it and start a run, or am I missing something obvious?
---
This is so lame. HS designers should check out r/customhearthstone for some creative ideas.
---
I would cut lightbomb for a 1 of mass resurrection and see if its good enough to warrant something else to be cut for a second. 
---
I think this is really solid. Compare it to the 2/1 + 1/1 murloc, or the equivalent that summons a slime with taunt -- the latter saw *some* play, and rush is probably better. I think this could be good enough a 2 drop to just see play. Like plated beetle.
---
Lots of Esports channels do re-runs all the time. Those count as pre-recorded.
---
Until the end of the year when Priest has a bunch of tools again. Same thing happens every year. They just have an awful basic/classic set. 
---
Sigh, let me guess, the next priest card:
---
3 mana spell - Dark Hallucinations
---
Twinspell, discover a copy of a spell in your deck.
---
Idk does big priest even have space for this?
---
Big Priest in standard will be waaaay less consistent without Shadow Essence/Visions. I wonder if it will even see play. 
---
We were JUST done with the horseshit resurrect effect. Why? Why?
---
Un’Goro has a few good murlocs but most of the basic package is still in Classic packs.
---
I'll let someone else answer your first question. I'm sure there are some articles out there. Maybe look at Vs wild data reports for ideas. 
---
As for the 2nd question. Skull is a corner stone for many warlock control decks. 
---
I think Ebon Dragonsmith was more for rogue but the fact that it is a dragon is not important with it
---
It’s definitely a better spellstone. Having to use spells to upgrade the spellstone gives it high variance depending on when you draw it. You can mulligan Mass Resurrection without worrying that you’re sending it too deep into your deck. 
---
In standard you can't play big priest
---
1-mana Glinda Crowskin + 1-mana Malygos (Echo up to 8 times)+ Soulfire = 44dmg
---
I'm not really sure why the tavern brawl doesnt just give access to all the cards - it could be the demo version of the game for players, get them excited about cards they don't have and make them more likely to spend money to get them.
---
Guessing that [this picture](https://i.redd.it/yqzx02akxbn21.png) was going to be a minion with deathrattle: summon a 1/1 minion is equivilent to guessing that there's a 2 drop in a new expansion? 
---
Dude, I honestly hope you have a good day, sounds like you're in a bad spot if you're irrationally mad at someone because they think their small good experience was cool. 
---
AHAHAHAHHAHAHA
---
New card: explosive burrito
---
Please i love the bronze dragons
---
I played handbuff and dragon paladin. This card.... I might make something in wild for this.
---
this is such a lazy design spellstone rotate out so blizz reprint it basically like we haven't seen enough big priest in the last 2 years
---
If you want to play cards you don't have, Dungeon Run is still available. 
---
You don’t have to play it on turn 3 though, but you can. And I think this fact makes it a pretty solid or maybe even good arena card for certain decks.
---
Basically I wouldn’t draft this instead of all the 3/4s I need, but as a reasonable mid- late game card with the added benefit to slam it down turn 3 if no better play is available. 
---
Worst case would be having to play a 3/2 into a 4/4, but even that’s not necessarily a insta loss and actually in that case the card helped you tremendously because it means you had no other 4 drop to play on curve.
---
1 card per year is their limit
---
Spring rocket: *sad rocket noises*

---
If I would have enough karma, you would've received gold, my friend.
---
my roommate used to raid AQ on private servers... big nope from me
---
That's actually not that accurate, it's just been true for the last two years because of Radiant, Shadow Visions and the all of the res spells that are rotating. Inner Fire combo was only ever a meme deck before the last two years and I don't recall there ever being a res or MB OTK deck before two years ago. The first few years, priest was either value control or midrange.
---
It makes about as much sense as a card featuring Dr. Boom stooped next to a huge stack of explosives/dynamite giving you 1 armor.
---
Why does your HS look... different? Idk how to explain, looks a bit more nitid and saturated.
---
yeah the lack of board clear really hurts. i ended up just making elemental mage and hoping for the best.
---
The charge your phone comments are always hilariously dumb. They are especially dumb when the person is close 50% charge.
---
Good point its probably nowhere near the powerlevel of  stone hill defender that got away with its bad stat line due to taunt and discover but we will see.
---
All I see is three legendaries being discovered.
---
You run elvens, sprints, plenty of spells, ect
---
My only complaint is this wouldve been way better as an elemental but Im really excites that shaman got a solid 1 drop. Hopefully the rest of the set is good too so we arent a meme class that needs 20k dust to be good.
---
I just puked. 
---
To be fair, this is just Hearthstone in general. It's really disappointing, honestly. A lot of the fun flavor stuff in MtG is how well the card and the power/toughness fit together (usually) and some of the fun games they get to play with the power/toughness in relation to other cards (like, say something is flavorfully a hunter of something else and so its stats line up perfectly to just kill it and live).
---
Oh, Crystalsong, the vast zone of absolutely nothing because they decided to put Dalaran in there and had to scrap all their Crystalsong plans because of the massive Dalaran lag? I wonder why nobody knew about this character... lol
---
To be fair Dragon Consort did the trick iirc.
---
If the choice cards still cost 0 then the boy is a 4 mana 4/5 that gives minions +2/+2
---
Bah, I'm sick of shaman card design. 
---
"Ok we have a decent card here. Who are we giving it to? Oh, shaman? Better just slap in some overload, then!"
---
Shaman has been my absolute favourite class since Vanilla WoW and I hate watching how Bliz is treating it in HS.
---
Eating fries while you play?
---
&gt;what have I missed?
---
Nothing
---
Game is still stale af. That's the tl;dr version
---
it's not incorrect. if it is both a minion and a card, then it's still a card that summons a minion. the fact that it summons itself is irrelevant. it's a fact that playing a minion card results in a 'summon a minion' effect, as evidenced by countless things that trigger on minion summon, and it's also a fact that those are cards. so it's a card that summons a minion.
---
It's getting pretty bad indeed. It's not just limited to this site though, every place even remotely connected to Hearthstone seems filled with whining crybabies
---
Yeah when I hid the nicknames it also fd up the contrast and lighting a bit
---
I haven't played WoW either, but from what little lore I do know, that looks like the sewers of Dalaran, so it would make sense to have the lackeys and murlocs hanging out down in the sewers with sludge and the sorts
---
I’ve played through rumble around 20-30 times, and the only time I’ve won was by using the rogue shrine that steals cards from the opponent’s deck. At higher levels their decks are just nuts, and the only way I’ve beat em is by taking and using their best cards against them.
---
I mean, it’s not interesting. I just jammed the “good” cards into a deck. Grumble and Thrall aren’t necessary:

Until you look at other mages. Why is Antonidas 2.5 times stronger and 3.5 times tougher without his magic than Khadgar without his magic?
---
Exact leathal, I like
---
I never new pinochio's last name was joybuzz
---
I couldn’t  effort playing in wild competitively. That’s the point
---
I'd rather see a powerful epic Highlander Warlock card. It would be a cool class-specific callback card, and you could run two copies since once you draw the first, only one copy is in your deck. It's even disruptable thanks to Bomb Warrior.
---
Wow, odd pally is going to be super OP when this set launches... 
---
Oh... wait... Thank god.
---
So all of these cards are rotating out :)
---
A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh, a-weema-weh, a-weema-weh
---
It's a very common card to see in arena
---
Eh? Does spell damage affect heal effects now?
---
Paying 1 overload for 1 lackey is way different than getting a free generated card like Swashbuckler
---
Depending on when you quit, the Deathknights would have probably been recently released, and imo this is what has caused the game to become a battle between two players with near infinite value. Particularly Rexxar, Gul'dan, Valeera, and Jaina. Rexxar could make an insane minion every turn for 2, Gul'dan has a 2 Mana deal 3/heal 3, Rogue can arguably make the most use out of using an extra "free" card each turn, and Jaina would make healing water elementals for days. 
---
All this added up to where you could never generate enough threats on board without an insane combo, or your own infinite value generation. Things like "add a random card", discover a card, cards cost less, even tribal synergies just couldn't keep up. Even burn strategies fail, because when your opponent literally can make a new big threat every turn with Rexxar, you can't burn them out of threats. 
---
These insane DK cards are rotating out in a couple weeks, and HS will look *very* different over the coming months I believe. Some of the most oppressive and meta defining decks are losing the most key pieces to their strategy. Now's as good a time as any to try it out again.
---
The only taunt divine shield minion I can think of is [Wickerflame Burnbristle] and that's a 3 drop.
---
Also reminds me of baby monkey riding on a pig: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_sfnQDr1-o
---
Not for stats. Their flavor has been fine for mechanics, but definitely not for stats. There are countless examples of utterly nonsensical power/toughness stats or mana costs.
---
Amen, man. Wotog would've been the greatest time in Hearthstone if not for specifically entomb
---
Wild is going to be just as much of a shitshow as usual though.

3/2/2 | Divine Shield, Taunt, Lifesteal  
---
I'm EU and literally don't have a deck complete atm
---
Wow dude that was an epic Timon and Pumbaa reference
---
The best way to save yourself a similar experience two years down the road when you decide you want to play wild, is to not dust anything at all. 
---
Umm... ‘scuse me? Lackey is in the card and yet I see no EVIL in the name. What the inconsistency Blizzard?
---
Yeah...I have a pretty decent collection, and I still prefer pre-built deck brawls.
---
You don’t have to, because you can run both? This can tutor a Florist OR just get you the super discount on your main combo card on the spot. Druid is losing significant card draw this expansion, so I figure it won’t hurt for them to have a draw and discount card. 
---
I don’t think so, at least every time I see that my Shaman opponent plays the quest I expect a good chance to win. Regardless of what Deck I am playing btw.
---
This will fit perfectly in my Rogue C'thun deck. It's so rare that I get a good card for the deck and to see this makes me *very* excited.
---
You got it. Now if you'll excuse me I have your cards to play.
---
He loves Grape Sherbert
---
I'd normally go with Keleseth, but with those deathrattles you already have, Undatakah seems pretty solid.  Plus you'll invariably get a choice later on with 3 2 mana cards.
---
Got em
---
Right. I don’t know why even Control decks would cut this. Seems really powerful.
---
So what? every other class misses out even more.
---
Pirates are strong. But patches alone was what invalidated the whole hunter class essentially. Getting a free 1/1 or 2/2 charger to always gain early board against hunter meant hunter was low tier until patches rotated.
---
Don't think I've ever seen a nightelf female death knight who didn't  backpeddle, so to me it fits. 
---
As a non-Shaman player, this will be the rare I pull 6 of on launch day. Just like Screech!
---
I have been summoned and am aware. 
---
That's assuming that the Lackeys are all good turn 2 plays, but they aren't.
---
Faceless Lackey (summon a 2-drop) is the best, giving you a random 2-drop. But then consider that you just played a sucky 2/1 minion. So basically you played a bad 1 mana 2/1, a random 2-drop, and the only extra benefit you got was an extra 1/1. The extra 1/1 in the early game can be very good, but you could have also played a good 1-drop into a good 2-drop that you actually chose to be in your deck.
---
Kobold Lackey (deal 2 damage) is good too. It can possibly kill your opponent's early drop and protect the 2/1 murloc. But if you consider all the stats, it's like a 3 mana 3/2 battlecry deal 2 damage. That's good, but not incredible.
---
Ethereal Lackey (discover a spell) is ok. It's terrible tempo since it had no board presence, and shaman has a lot of crappy situational spells. It also has some great ones though, so it could be good value.
---
Witchy Lackey (evolve a minion) is useless on turn 2 if they kill your 2/1. Even if you evolve the 2/1, that means you can't use it to trade, and even when evolving into a 2-drop, it will get on average around 2 more stat points. Not that great.
---
Goblin Lackey (give +1 attack and rush) is the worst. If they kill the 2/1 it does nothing. But even if the 2/1 survives, you give it +1 attack and...the rush does nothing since it could attack anyway.
---
This card could be interesting, but I think it is too inconsistent and unreliable to be an auto include.
---
I've heard of that 0 times ever must have been a contender 
---
Over two turns.
---
RemindMe! 3 months
---
IMHO netdecking and not netdecking should lead to the same result if you're a good enough deck builder. All netdecking does is allows the deck building process to be a group effort and move faster instead of being an individual effort

He’s been the way he is for so long, there’s no way they’re gonna do anything to the card short of sticking him in the hall of fame.
---
True. I was talking in terms of standard but I didn’t realize kathrena wasn’t standard anyway. I think this guy is gonna be pretty scary in wild. 
---
Those aren’t in the Heal Zoo deck 
---
I have a Lot of fun with my Renowock nobody expect my double reno :D
---
Time to spend a few bucks or Move to Esl legends, where you can earn a ton of free decks.
---
Good flexible card, works great with the new legendary.
---
Doesn't work so well with Fandrall in wild, though
---
Its honestly taken longer than I thought it would, I had completely forgotten.
---
I didn't consider that he might only upgrade to goldens to use in these two weeks. Then it doesn't matter yes, but it's still misleading to say the upgrade to golden is frer
---
Warlock hero power helps A TON with that deck. Heal Druid likely won’t be a deck. At least not in the same way Heal Zoo is. Imagine top decking a voodoo doctor lmao. At least in Warlock you can tap for another card 
---
r/477
---
Honestly, I think stuff like this show why some resurrection card should be moved into the classic set. Otherwise they'll just keep printing more for Priest overtime.
---
It's the same problem for mass removal for Priest.
---
Fandral always tries to do it in the most beneficial order, so I'm going to assume it will damage first, meaning that this is 1 mana restore three health to a minion.
---
Yeah, seems that we're getting a Token Heal Druid
---
solis card really glad restores health instead of armour new druid legendary can take advantage and at 1 mana doesn't lose tempo and can be just use to be mana efficient if need be 3 stars
---
shadowverse just had a 'brawlisium' where they feature 13 different OP decks in the past in their completely unnerfed state and you get to choose 1 of those 13 decks to do your run with. 
---
Which ones are doing that? I mean, a few years ago someone got legend with a version without Barnes but the potential to just win the game on the spot seems to be worth the weaker res pool.
---
Blizzard is dropping a big lead ball on this reveal season.  Not only dont let the streamers preview the card to come up with their own cool reveal like in the past, but have the reveal filled almost entirely with awkward dead time as they intentionally have trouble getting the box open. 
---
Also Jesus this design was phoned in.  I dont think a condition card has ever had its condition included in such a ham fisted way.  It's like if Janalai was revealed alongside a card that lets your hero power deal 8 to a minion for a turn.  
---
well they tried to make heal paladin a thing, time for druid i guess.
---
Huh, I don't play WoW so I didn't know that, then it makes sense but I feel like Hearthstone isn't strict on it's interpretation of WoW's lore to say the least so I don't think it would hurt too badly to change it.
---
Fluffy tends to be a filler word in these translations for whatever reason
---
Cheap cost too for *easy* synergy with the legendary.
---
Love this card.
---
Also the new epic card. Seems like we are going to get a Token Heal Druid
---
They've had Battlecries for a while with Rumbling Elemental back in LoE. It's always been a subtheme that they have good Battlecries. Mages are not better with Elementals. Shaman has had stronger ones, Jaina is just OP and doesn't need to be in an Elemental deck.
---
If at first you don’t succeed...
---
Soon, millions of HS players will learn that Healing Touch is a card they own.
---
Kingsbane isn't a fast game tho. Best to be a total degenerate and play Pirate Warrior or Odd Pal.
---
But do you have enough value?
---
AH the Thijs deck I see
---
eh idk, twitch chat was angry throughout the entire thing
---
This seems so bad compared to other druid spells and so good compared to holy smite/flash heal
---
Thank you!
---
Reddit: Blizzard doesn't give their classes enough style and mechanics
---
Also Reddit: Stop giving Priest rez shit
---
My favorite card from the Rumble set - I currently have 5 different decks based around him.
---
Oh, sorry. I missed your point, because I wasn’t able to properly read.
---
I think this is a reason why Blizzard won’t do a wild-only brawl. However, if they do, they probably will hand out a pack regardless if you play or not, so new players don’t get too upset.
---
where are you getting his size from.  that mountains way off in the background
---
you must be the freak who i just played with gold border hunter still playing the game after thousands of matches
---
I legitimately thought I was on custom hearthstone... and was thinking oh great, someone is trying to make a weird archytype again
---
Zayle provides 5 decks and will come out with the Single Player adventure. Buying the adventure gets you a golden Zayle but you can craft a normal version.
---
None of what you said is specific to deck building brawls, deck recipe brawls can and have had the same problem, there is always a best deck, (or class if the deck is symmetrical). The difference being you have a lot less options to chose from and the meta is probably determined even quicker. In conclusion your argument doesn’t make sense, the problem you describe isn’t a problem with deck building it is a problem with the brawl design. So consider arguing that point instead.
---
If you want to make arguments about the collection requirement though go right ahead.

He may not clone things but he does have a history of summoning stuff. Notably his elemental servant which led you around Shatt and delivered some messages in WoD. Its far from the peak of his power, but it exists.
---
deal 2 damage and then heal it for 5 lol
---
I KNEW IT.. I knew keeping Splintergraft was my best life decision. Rank 1 legend?
---
&gt;  then (an unsuccessful) heal paladin 
---
Don't mean to burst your bubble, but Shirvallah OTK Paladin runs High Priest Thekal, Flash of Light, Crystalsmith Kangor, Truesilver Champions, Uther of the Ebon Blade. Sure, the deck isn't called "Heal Paladin", but it sure as hell utilizes most of the class' efficient healing mechanics to survive the long game until it can pull off the OTK, and that deck is actually pretty damn viable on ladder right now.
---
Whether or not it’s noob friendly depends on your goals. I haven’t spent a dime in HS and have reached top ends of legend multiple times.
---
So if you goal is to be competitive on ladder/tourny, and don’t want to spend excessively, then you can forget about getting a complete collection and instead focusing on accumulating crafts for the meta deck you want to play.
---
Start watching streams to see if you like a deck before putting your investments/disenchants in. Any card not part of the deck you want is a potential disenchant. Playing completed decks is more fun than playing patchy decks for the sake of having a potentially valuable card for collection. If you want to start learning about the game and get better as a player, then forget about constructed for the first 3-4 months. Go to arena and understand the fundamentals of card games. Watch arena streamers that go through their draft choices and use draft tools as a gauge. When you use draft tools ask yourself if there’s reason to go against recommendations. Watch them play in game and ask yourself how you’d play the turn before they make theirs, then compare decisions and try to understand why they make theirs. Eventually, you’ll be able to evaluate your decisions better and even come up with better lines than the players you’re watching. Get a deck tracker and start tracking your progress, and ask yourself what are you doing differently from top players if you see a halt in win rate. 
---
Save any rewards you get until you’ve decided on a deck you want to MASTER(not just play, because that gives you reason to keep playing the same deck and goals). No point in worry about what to disenchant/craft if you are not even sure which deck you want. If you have a deck in mind, disenchant away. Try to meet craft dust requirements by disenchanting your lowest rarity cards first(they will come in excess as you gain rewards by playing the game). Forget about your rank, wins, or collection, and focus on decisions, and gauge your decision making by your win rate over a period of time(1 month) vs deck’s expected WR(usually around 50-55%), or if you want a challenge, a top pro player level winrate(60%+). Once you reach your desired mastery/wr with a deck, look to find another deck you want to MASTER.
---
If you don’t care about improvement, start with single player content, then save gold/ invest in packs to play the decks you want to play. Don’t worry about getting big collection and work toward complete decklists.
---
If you want a full collection or want to build any wacky idea you have into a deck anytime you want, then apply the almighty credit card.
---

---
More like:
---
"Beast in the Box" 5 Mana 4/4
---
Anti-Rush. Battlecry: If you've been shaking the box 500 times this game, summon this minion.
---
But what if the opponent coins out a ping knowing that we got exactly Witchy Lackey and no other 1-drops because they stream-sniped us? Checkmate, unplayable card. 
---
it's a little bit irksome when a dragon synergy card isn't a dragon itself. means it has anti synergy with itself. one of the low key godly overlooked quality of drakonid operative was that he was a dragon himself.
---
They still have many super solid cards and one of the stronger classic sets. I think they'll be midtier if they don't get anything good this expac.
---
5 health this **game** and not this turn? Thats a very broad and easy requirement. Although not in current armor druid meta, It is possible to heal with previous basic set cards. But I think it might need slightly more support card to become a archetype.
---
Sorry, I know you were first, but I'm removing this in favor of a higher quality image.
---
.....try it in another class.
---
Dafuq is this monster 
---
Well Malfurion went through his phase of doing armor better than warrior so he needs a new fad
---
Not today, shill. 
---
Oh I definitely agree with what you're saying, just Blizzards ideal "Heal Paladin" package never ended up working out, with Zandalari Templar as the payoff. 
---
Worse holy smite tbh.
---
They probably didnt want another malygos druid
---
WHATS IN THE BOX???
---
Brode wasn't a designer for his later time in the game, that's why he said he left. He mentioned something about the last card he really got to get in the design process for was Blackhowl Gunspire.
---
it does seem like they're trying to make bronze dragons a paladin thing
---
Spoken like someone who's never played wow and gotten the shit kicked out of them by a gnome.

---
  
---
**Card text:** **Rush** **Battlecry:** If you restored 5 health this game, summon a copy of this.
---
If you want to do this right now you can play dragon warrior. The spell that adds 2 random dragons to your hand can add dragons from other classes.
---
When they Hall-of-Famed that Paladin draw card, I mistook the name and thought they meant Divine Spirit. I was like, "Yea, that makes sense. Card's too easily abused."
---
Then I realized it wasn't the right card, and... I guess the draw card needed it too, but man, Divine Spirit is going to get knocked off eventually. I'd fear spending Dust to make any deck that relies on it.
---
It's not as good as Spellstone, since it was fairly easy to upgrade it and the extra 2 mana for follow up helped. But i think this card will enable Wall Priest to possibly survive the rotation.
---
Holy crap. The flexible Holy Smite is solid on its own, but that Battlecry condition is incredibly easy to meet for 8 attack worth of removal plus two bodies worth 16/16 stats. 
---
Thing is, N'zoth's first mate removes turn 1 Undertaker, and even sets up to beat Undertaker coin Deathrattle.  Patches having Charge means you can easily claim the board early on.  It'll have to be a turn 3-4 undertaker or for the Warrior to not find any weapons or draw patches to reach a 4/5 statline.
---
I was missing a few cards and refused to craft anything that's about to rotate.. but my improvised version of this worked well too. I won 2 out of 2 games with it..

Fun fact: Anachronos is depicted in the card [[Dragon Consort]]. So if he’s in this expansion, both he and Kalecgos (who is actually the dragon in Malyos’s artwork) will be in two different cards as the main attraction.

Odd one for druid as it says summon a copy but druid is not a hand buff class however will be useful in to have as a tempo play to either finish wiping a board or to gain tempo after a board clear and it's not going ro be hard to get the two 4/4 Decent 3 stars
---
Love the DKs trapped in the snow globe. It's like the phantom zone because I never want to see them again.
---
Mecha’thun Warlock should be one of the best decks, on paper better than midrange and mech hunter. However if you like to play more proactive than maybe aggro paladins are a good bet.
---
That said, deck alone won’t take you to legend. Time to start looking at your play and study some matchups, macro-strategies, mulligans etc
---
Good luck! Hard work pays off
---
Regis got a hunter defenders of dalaran card in his box
---
If this expansion brings a new Millhouse this would be a great excuse to craft it golden
---
Neither of those things are tempo gains.
---
Oh I have one of those bought it in the Tokyo airport for like $10 not $70. 
---
Opponent is on the left for some reason on mobile
---
To be fair, a lot of people really hate Combo cards. 
---
I got Grand Archivist from mine recently in constructed. I had 6 minions on board and my opponent had none. He pulled Dragon's Fury which pulled Flamestrike and cleared my whole board.
---
Could be a pretty decent anti-aggro card in a vaccum. I haven't looked at what druid still has and what they're losing in terms of anti-aggro though. I originally wasn't crazy about these cards either but they might not be as bad as i originally thought.  Crystal power can help hold off early minions or bring you out of burn range later in the game for only 1 mana. Crystal stag still feels a little underwhelming to me but maybe that's because it doesn't seem stupidly broken. 
---
I'm expecting MalyDruid to be a thing. This with Florist as a backup mana discount
---
FRESH
---
Right, but maybe they got lucky there and already had something unused in the archives.
---
Dragadin may finally come upon us, brace yourselves
---
Through the power of funnel cakes and ice cream, respectively!
---
FIRST I PLAY JEPETTO. I DRAW BARNES AND BLOOD OF THE ANCIENT ONE. I PLAY BARNES WHO SUMMONS THE 🅱️ANCIENT ONE
---
I’m on NA. The decks are almost always midrangey, leaning more aggressive. They climb to 10 fairly easily, but I switch decks a lot and am never trying to climb. I’d honestly rather not climb.
---
How aggressive they are depends on the build and the class. Warlock can draw cards has a class Murloc that pushes you to build a lower curve than, say, Warrior, who mostly has Beasts and Dragons. But you generally need to kill a lot of classes before they can get up their taunt walls or find Reno.
---
As for late game, I generally don’t run any. Lately I’ve run lot of War Bears or Crowd Roasters, ocassionally Alexstrasza, rarely Oondasta. I’ve also been playing the new Beastmaster in conjunction with Coldlight Oracle to draw and buff beasts.
---
I try to use class cards as much as possible to keep it fun. Gral and Blink Fox in Rogue, for example. I also try to include Menagerie Magician, even though Fungalmancer is probably better 80% of the time.
---
Anyway, yeah. Winning with a deck you put together yourself (especially if it’s memey or utilizing bad cards) is probably the best feeling in the game for me. I just don’t find copy-pasting a tier 1/2 deck to be interesting at all. I want to win because of a decision I made in playing or deckbuilding, not because a deck is just stupidly overpowered.
---
I feel like people have amnesia of the days before Keleseth.
---
Like, Keleseth comes in the game, and now all 2 mana cards that were before it are weaker than a 2/1 rush deathrattle 1/1 mucloc... What?
---
Nah it's Big Chromie
---
Dont they only draw 4 tho? I think that's what he meant.
---
And the other one got disenchanted by illidan
---
Holy sh- it’s huge !

also procs damage effects like hydra or Gahz'rilla (wild) or gurubashi berserker (bad)

It’s getting mixed reviews,  but in my opinion, any time this activates on 5, its the strongest tempo play in the game on that turn.  It’s insane if it can be consistent.

if you use it on a minion beside a Snapjaw Shellfighter, the shellfighter would take the damage and the target would take the heal
---
Did they? Sucks that Moorabi doesn’t get to enjoy it in Standard.
---
1. I'm quite surprised. Death Knights should should up as a Legendary card.  It shows up for me, both capital and lower case.  Maybe you made a typo the first time? ("legendary")
---
2.  The Puzzles just reinforce game mechanics.  Like for Rogue, you need to play a card first in order to activate a combo card (Cold Blood) for more damage. It just reinforces solid game mechanics if you can figure them out.  You only unlock a card back so use it as a learning tool if nothing else.
---
3. The only card I can think of is [Sand Drudge](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/thumb/e/e4/Sand_Drudge%2890241%29.png/200px-Sand_Drudge%2890241%29.png?version=4d2c50c051c1ebddc3bb77db846235e6) or [Green Jelly](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/thumb/9/98/Green_Jelly%2877007%29.png/200px-Green_Jelly%2877007%29.png?version=f3f81db1243bbaf497a8d11529b8c375).  But those aren't strong cards.  And later in the game you'll find the best decks/cards do really unfair things (as will your own).
---
I don't know what cards you have but Hearthstone just updated their deck builder and will try and build the best deck for what you put in it.  (I'ts really good now). So....
---
* You were playing Shaman.  Create a Blank Shaman Deck, and you'll see a button under the deck name, click "Complete My Deck".
---
* You can do this for your other Legendary cards too (Hallazzi-Hunter, Valeera-Rogue)  Valeeera is leaving standard but playable in Wild.
---
This might help you refine your decks or use your Legendary cards.  Once you unlocked Casual (Rank 25) it will try to give you a 50% winrate against your opponents but some games you can still get blown out.
---
Well, that's only my opinion. I just think that the tempo you gain with the overload mechanic becomes obsolete 50% of the time if the effect is based solely on RNG. 
---
Haha that’s me and Battleborn.
---
i have hs deck tracker so i know if i got a leggo/epic the moment i click on the pack before i click on the card. it's this plugon called pack tracker, tracks your pity timers
---
Probably the easiest thing to do with a small card collection is something like zoolock. Just include as many high performing neutral minions as possible and you'll probably win sooner than later.
---
You know it'll be viable by the end of the year, no need to rush.
---
I've been doing pretty well with this big-spell-mage/elemental-mage hybrid, especially against all the warriors that seem to be populating the TB thus far:

AAECAf0EBpfBAsrBAtPFAsLOApvTAqPrAgyZwgKswgLrwgLCwwLKwwKWxwLHxwLIxwKW0wLb0wLX4QKW5AIA
---
I'll take a guess...
---
Tavern Brawl
---
Add 1 card to deck, Jaina.
---
Auto complete fills out rest of deck and adds second Jania.
---
For sure kinda of feels like a "Plan A" for combo decks with their original "Plan A" becoming "Plan B" It's also a card where you don't want a lot of cycle minions. 
---
That said in a battlecry heavy deck on turn 10 this is a 10 mana 6/6 + 2 really strong battlcries on 1/1 bodies. 
---
Proof?
---
Like I said. I don't think this is a bad card. But people are overrating the turn 1 turn 2 curve. That's all I was trying to say.
---
Kobold Librarian is 1 mana by the way. Sludge Slurper is 1 + 1 overload = paying 2 mana.
---
It's not the feature that automatically completes your deck. This one fills your deck even with cards you don't own, so people without year of the mammoth cards can still play the brawl.
---
I'm aboard the same vessel friend. I WILL make this card work (hopefully)
---
Pretty good, gave me a semi- boner.
---
It's about sending a message. 
---
Problem is, you need to draw without tracking. So basically run nothing but draw &amp; prob dk for survival until your opponent dies from build-a-beast before you ever get your combo off
---
I'm a little more lenient about this by treating it as an ordinal scale. On an ordinal scale we can say that a 5 attack minion is stronger than a 4 attack minion but we can't say by how much. Could be 20% stronger, could be 2000% stronger.
---
Seems like every other card this expansion completely misses in terms of fluff and flavor.
---
They used to be so good at this, wonder what changed.
---
I might consider spending the time learning if it felt like there was a payoff. There was at the start, but I've run into a brick wall (of cards).
---
But hey, it's a matter of preference, and this thread is helping me decide if this is the game for me. So it's been helpful.
---
.sdrawkcab s'tahT
---
2 4/4's != 1 8/8.
---
This is a 8/4 or 4/8 depending on the situation.
---
I'd rather have cool effects than better stats at a higher mana cost. But yeah, the art does lead you to judge their stats in the wrong way.
---
Fuck I want this but it has to be a Neutral.
---
He means for the hall of famed cards like Baku and Genn.
---
Well, the first reply isn’t wrong tbh. Something tells me that you don’t play wild with any control decks because let me tell you, having a fourth spell stone is often game winning. 
---
IS THIS FINALLY THE TIME FOR THE FABLED UNICORN BEAST DRUID?
---
Where we would be without the toxicity though?
---
NO TAKE CANDLE
---
Six if you're in wild.
---
You're dumb, it's the tavern brawl
---
One of the best warlock legends.
---
Cards like these work best on curve. Damaging your own characters for 5 AND healing back up before turn 5 is going to be a major hurdle. You're going to have to put in non OP cards like Crystallizer, Injured Blademaster and multiple healing spells and draw them in the right order.
---
I don't personally think the strength of the card is OP enough to warrant playing the weak-ish stuff you need to support it.
---
Nah you need to get at least 7 cards perfectly in your hand to do the combo which it is hard not a legend level combo.
---
You got a point
---
so not new and worse.
---
Havent played it yet but I dont think the number would be that fucked up. 
---
It’s just a clickbait idea, like this post, so people watch his lame stream lolz
---
What if they made thekal like a start of game turn your health into armor
---
9 Mana gain 5 armor, refresh your hero power.
---
There's also a single insect from the Spreading Plague card art.
---
Kinda , there is rexzar that can get silence i Believe 
---
Myracle Rogue, Rush Warrior, Tempo Rogue probably, possibly Midrange Hunter.
---
Yeah it's much worse
---
Let me guess, he disconnected?
---
I actually play alot of maly rogue and I like this. the problem is that it can never happen before turn 11, which is probably good enough for the opponent to kill you
---
This wouldv been so much better with [[Moonglade Portal]]
---

6/-/- | Restore 6 Health. Summon a random 6-Cost minion.  
---
Surprised people are high on this card, Overload 1 seems really bad for an early game card with such low tempo. 
---
/u/MotCots3009 fixed it
---
It worths noticing that by random, it means real random: we can get cards we don't even have in our collection!
---
That's how hearthstone usually is. Actually, now I think of it, that's how most games are. Some days are bad, some days are good. After the rotation, new opportunities open up, and maybe wall priest won't be as powerful. Cheer up. You will get better as well.
---
Yep I sorta dig beasts in pretty much any class. Mage, Aluneth and beastmaster is pretty fun.
---
I really hate fatigue decks, especially Warrior. I honestly think they should remove fatigue so Warrior needs at least value generation or something.
---
You're going to learn to like wild 
---
Activates likkim cheaply, generates a lackey in case there are shaman cards that require one
---
Odd. 
---
Sure things: Control warrior. Dragon warrior. Pirate rogue. Thief priest. Beast hunter. Some form of zoo and aggro Paladin. 
---
Possible decks: OTK Druid (gonk variant), control shaman, Mecha’thun Decks, Mech/Egg Paladin, fatigue/control/ heal Paladin (same thing different variants), treeant token Druid, Tess Rogue, some variant of secret hunter with zuljin
---
Right now I’m playing thief priest with Mountain giants, the big 7/8 taunt that goes down to zero mana late game, and talanji. With seance to ensure the big threats just keep coming. It feels incredibly strong right now. I’m beating current meta decks. It plays a lot like evenlock, it even has the late game derpy power turn with talanji. It’s gonna be super strong after rotation, but I’m not sure it’s gonna see any play. 
---
Because reality is, you’re all idiots. You play decks that streamers play. And if a streamer doesn’t play it, nobody will think to craft it. So who really knows. Streamers pretty much define the meta, which is so fucking stupid. 
---
noone want to watch on his fat fucking stomach, this is obviously.
---
You're right, totally just a game with people with different opinion and reasons for their opinions. 
---
Just saying, not enjoying this brawl the same way the last two brawls were fun. 
---
Let's say you play Flame Imp on turn 1 and then a random 2 drop on turn 2. That's the same amount of stats you get from Sludge Slurper and Faceless Lackey. Is that good? Yeah, its pretty good. It comes in one card though, which is great, but the problem is you only have a 20% chance of even getting Faceless Lackey, a 20% of getting a spell, and a 60% chance of getting a 1/1. 
---
and it's actually going to go down when they add new Lackeys next expansion. 
---
Yes, the card is good. But people are overrating it and only looking at the dream scenario where they curve perfectly and get Faceless Lackey, when more than half of the time, the Lackey they will get won't be good on curve.
---
Odd. With a hint of wall priest
---
But Togwaggle and Cobalt also have their health meshed up, and that seems really pointless to photoshop in.
---
Mm good point I'll delete
---
!remindme March 29 
---
Game on. 
---
3 turns because you have to Alleria, Thaurrisan, and then kill.
---
Summon a water elemental

Good thing you found your way to the Hearthstone Q and A thread

---
Lackeys are a mediocre one cost minion stapled to a one cost spell effectively making them worth around 2 mana, so no
---
Okay, so if you font like a reply because you feel attacked or whatever, you should just ignore it instead of being a little bitch and shoving a stupid meme of "HaHA ThIs WaSnT iT cHiEf". Stop trying to defend yourself, you're complete shit at communication and should not have been in the stream, end of story. Go on and design cards like "Dr. Boom's Scheme" and collect your fucking paycheck.

Is that really the power level judgement card we wanna use lmao
---
Because making a movie and making a cinematic are two completely different scales of work.
---
Just play Whizbang and enjoy the ride. 
---
Personaly I am waiting for choose one:
---
Deal 2 damage or deal 2 damage to a minion. 
---
I feel like everyone would just be playing the same tier 1 decks in tavern brawls then. I do see your point though. 
---
Its because the autofill gives you random cards and doesn't check for duplicate legendaries. The numbers are just the game.
---
Ooo probably the retire one
---
Yep, when I first saw this I didn't realize the weapon comes from a minion.
---
I know, i got 12 wins with it but there where decks even more incredible than this one.

---
thank you!
---
sorry about that, but... i think its all on you my man.  Since you've played in the past, you should have realized how close to rotation we were, and you should have done your research before spending any dust.
---
At least you will get free dust from your HoF baku, and at profit if you decide to dust her as well.
---
I have 2100 gold and already crafted both golden legends. Should I buy withchwood packs to try to get the rest and dust everything to craft the remaining Hall of Fame cards? My analysis says no as at most I'll only gain 25% dust
---
Nonono, 0 mana 5/5 minion "Echo. At the start of the game if you have cards in your deck, your hero power costs one and gets upgraded."

Uh, newbies round here with their SICKENING positivity
---
Inner Fire, Divine Spirit and Mindblast are all pretty terrible without Shadow Visions or other decent support cards.
---
It was a bad joke then. Regenerate doesn't deal damage, else it could be used entirely differently.
---
Priest's card draw is pretty dependent on minions as well.
---
I've been playing a rotation-safe dragon/beast paladin deck this last week that's been pretty sweet. Currently standard has some really sick dragons and it looks like even more are to arrive
---
Answer C is by far the best one, no question about it hahaha
---
I'll try plan B tomorrow, pretty sure it will work just fine, if not I can get away with plan A.
---
Thanks dude, you rock &lt;3
---
Right now it’s sitting permanently at 11 packs , I keep one unopened pack from each set , it’s a cool throwback to see that old GvG etc pack sitting there 
---
And resusing art saves money.
---
Yeah. I can see where someone might get mixed up though. I dont play Magic: The Gathering but from what I understand every card in it is a "spell" - even if you "play a creature" you are actually casting a spell that summons that creature. So playing a creature can be counterspelled, funny enough.
---
I can save gold easy but my thoughts when my packs are sitting there are
---
Thought: I have to open this pack it's got the **Legendary** I always wanted
---
Reality: I opened my pack and got the **Rare** I already had.
---
Packs alway give you that little moment of hope so why would'nt you open them I reckon you could not resist rither and bought 7 packs for the purpose of the post. lol
---
Unless it's good. Then they'll have to craft something else.
---
Yea sure,never saw cube hunter and big spell mage/s
---
Thanks! Oblivitron wasn't so easy to guess though :^)

2/0/3 | Stealth for 1 turn. Your Hero Power also targets adjacent minions.  
---
This is actully going to come up in arena with the new card rotation system. Gonna feel bad for the poor fool with a zombie chow lol.
---
TBF I would literally just ftplay that mode. Just kinda sucks that this whole tavern brawl is inaccessible to me since I'm not going to craft any cards I don't have to play them for the next couple weeks. 
---
Does Malygos even affect healing cards? even with Auchenai on board i don’t think this works. 
---
Well if you get the effects on turn two, it's really strong. Because it will often trade 2 for 1 and they have to trade to push damage.
---
Well yes it is new, because it features new cards. That's the very definition of new.
---
Im 99% sure you're joking, but millhouse on 2 in arena is usually fine. A lot of spells you would pick in arena are reactive so it's unlikely anyone would keep them in their opening hand. Sure you might get unlucky and get blown out, so I would pick the 4/4 for 4 here, but millhouse isn't as bad in arena as it is in constructed. 
---
It keeps forcing cube in my odd control warrior deck which I find odd. Cubing a 3/6 dino can be nice but it's not gonna make or break a game. It's pretty much a win more card.
---
But Holy Smite is only put in decks that plan on it going face. Maybe I should be more clear.
---
It took this long?
---
I wouldn't but I don't know all the details of your situation.  The odds you will get those specific cards are low from Witchwood.     Save your 2100 gold for the next set.
---
It would be awesome, don't get me wrong. But even if they did fork out James Cameron amounts of money for a movie like that, the whole movie can't be like a cinematic from a design perspective. There'd need to be pacing, which is a whole issue in itself when it comes to CGI.

It's a cool dream, but sort of a pipe dream.

---
If the meme is alive, its not longer a meme. The idea was to be a meme card, but ended up being strong. Same goes for mind control, "meme" idea with strong effect but pretty high cost, that actually was pretty good just for the 10 mana cost of it.

They didn't have artwork for Malygos and Chillmaw, so they used similar existing artwork for Kalecgos and Sindragosa instead.
---
They didn't want to commission additional artwork back then, because small indie company, etc. Now that they've laid off the plushy designer, they can finally afford bespoke artwork for the game.
---
There has always been a bit of a disconnect in peoples minds too about how priest got all the theft mechanics instead of rogue  
---
Blagh
---
I was nervous throwing my opinion about this on reddit. I am glad to see a lot of others tired of the same tool reprinted. Res ability for priest is so boring already. Just stop it bliz, please.
---
Well that was before they were forced into a corner by making priest minions expensive because they can be healed but then giving all the other classes overly efficient removal. Instead of resurrection I'd love to see a priest only keyword that is a spirit of redemption like effect, the minion on death becomes a spirit, so same class of effect as the imp portal but only until the end of the priests next turn, that provides a temporary benefit. 
---
yeah but they have to tag as re-run
---
Even Warlock to rank 3, even Shaman to rank 1, and Kingsbane Rogue to legend.
---
Congrats! Hopefully they'll have cool rewards in the near future for 1000+ wins too so you can shoot for that!
---
Its not a bug, spell damage affects healing effects if they become damage effects, because they are damage.
---
Or are you refering to the spell not indicating that it does X damage correctly? If thats the case, then yeah they should change that.
---
Guaranteed he'll watch and rewatch many Youtube tutorials on how to open that damned thing.
---
This won't ever happen as a Tavern Brawl because it won't be different ruleset for people who own all/most of the cards.
---
That being said I'm surprised there hasn't been a 'Free Weekend' kind of thing where all the cards are available.

Bronze Herald is a new 3/2 RoS dragon and they always said they wanted Dragon to feel big and strong so they were trying to avoid printing weak dragons. Not anymore. No time for flavor! 
---
How am I going to OTK someone without Maly though? I don't want another expansion with zero OTK decks even close to viability. 
---
0/10 value not infinite, needed to draw wisp to win
---
If maly rotated, I wouldn't be sad at all. However, I think priest classic cards are the actual problem.
---
haha of course. isn't that the definition of anything that is viable? 
---
It does work as OP is posting. You can test it yourself. Auchenai makes regenerate become a damage spell, and malygos does affect it, empowering it.
---
This has been known from beta, stop spreading missinformation.
---
I have not. Hold on.  
---

---

---
That seems pretty good. 4/7/7 even without Overload. This actually does make this card good!

I think that's the attack voice line.

---
*Remembering armor gain doesn’t equal health*
---
I don't think Lazul's theme is on necromancy, more likely it's divination as she is a fortune teller. From the looks of her card this translates to seeing cards in your opponent's card and getting copies of them. This style of play could possibly work with Priest's other rastakhan legendary, Princess Talanji. 
---
It does affect it if an auchenai-like effect is in place.
---
Good thinking.
---
There should be a weekend or something where certain expansion would be available. Like League of Legends, for example, that enables certain champions every week so you can have a taste of them. Very new-player friendly stuff.
---
Thank you! And that would be really cool to see actually. I hope they do something along those lines. Although 1000+ Ranked wins would definitely take awhile for me haha.
