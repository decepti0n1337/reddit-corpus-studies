An option would be alright I guess but definitely not an automatic thing. A lot of people like to think about what their next move is at the end of their turn (*cough, goddamn druids end your turn, cough*)

Also the opponent would automatically know if they have a zero mana card in hand or not, unless you click the button super quickly after the last action. 
---
At the very least it gives away information to your opponent about whether or not your leftover Mana could pay for any of the cards in your hand that you decided to hold on to.

How hard is making an extra button click anyway?

---
Is that the way Brits handle their rage?
---
I definitely am, this meta right now is probably one of the most boring I've played in.  
---
Just feels like there is no interaction and choices anymore and games just play themselves out.
---
That moment when you forget that having Keleseth means no other 2 drops.
---
&gt; I can't understand people who complain about hunter  
---
It's reddit - the majority of posts are fluff or complaints.  
---
Most of the hunter complaints are unfounded but occasionally you come across someone who puts forward well reasons complaints.
---
r/CustomHearthStone is thataway man
---
Divine favor or spreading plague. 
---
Yes but telling someone to stop complaining is not the same as silencing someone.
---
Don't usually find I miss it, I'm actually having a very high win rate (about 80%) with a tech tempo deck that on paper kinda looks shoddy, but i rarely have a hand that cant answer what's on the board. 
---

---
For once I'll grab a pitch fork. 
---
Bliz pls fix.
---
We‚Äôre just making posts about anything these days huh
---
Dude. I faced a turn 2 keleseth last night! Wonder if it was the same one, that's insanely rare in arena...
---
Yet they're not too strong and people are still picking them up.  
---
It's more to do with well performing cheap decks which both spell/secret ideally are. 
---
 
---
Odd Paladin popularity is on the rise again I see (#1 popularity for paladin decks again) and this will continue to grow with how cheap it is to run.  
---
Remember when the hearthstone subreddit grossly mischaracterizes things Blizzard says and wonder about lack of community interaction? Yeah.
---
I've had it happen to me several times and only right now find out that it's from "clicking too fast". 
---
Not manageable when you don't know what it is.
---
I agree. It shouldn't be in the game, it should've been fixed a long time ago, but it wasn't. From there you got two option, to be an idiot who only complains and feels entitled to some stupid shit or you can easily not trigger the bug. EASILY.
---
We know where OP stands, and unfortunately all those who upvoted this. It's a general problem with kids these days (or just immature people) that feel the need for instant gratification and the entitlement that everything they use/play with/hear, needs to be perfect. Guess what? Nothings perfect, and if there's a way for you to make things better you should do it. Something and simple as not being a compulsive fucker who can't wait THREE seconds to click on something.
---
But, to each their own! 
---
A turn one keleseth in Arena? I feel like that's pretty self explanatory why this sucks
---
Why does Too many cooks have league of legends art on it?
---
Jk, he double shaddowstepped it too. 
---
F
---
You haven‚Äôt had very experience with playing with people in real life then. Just because you haven‚Äôt experienced it yourself doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist.
---
You just need to get better at playing hunter, if youre losing to odd paladins just play 2x explosive/snake traps
---
User name checks out.
---
Please don't, HearthPwn sucks. If your collection is small, go to hsreplay.net/decks and sort by win rate, then start adding filters to remove from the search the cards that you don't own. If you want ideas to start working towards building a competitive deck, go to Hearthstonetopdecks in their "budget decks section". If you want to know what the very best decks in the game look like, read https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-116/
---
There‚Äôs a lot of different builds you can play with Hunter which are all effective in their own way. That is why you see so many of them. But it doesn‚Äôt mean Hunter, as a class, is overpowered or anything. It‚Äôs just nice to finally see Hunter at the top which hasn‚Äôt been the case since the old days of Face Hunter, circa 2015. So stop complaining and either roll out your own Hunter deck or build an anti-Hunter deck.
---
I'll go a different route and say the lifesteal mechanic was the more worst thought out design choice.  
---
It's interesting to see they nerf the shit out of lifesteal for kingbane type decks but something like dk jaina keeps unlimited lifesteal that you can't even silence.  
---
There is a lot of lifesteal that is becoming a large part of meta decks and really taking enjoyment out of matchups.
---
You weren't even healing each others faces, you inconsiderate bastards
---
Right, and it's really silly to me that some people are excusing it with "it's not a big deal" or whatever else. This is a dev team that goes to extreme lengths to make the game simple for new/casual players but then they let a confusing/frustrating bug exist forever and just let the players figure it out themselves. It makes no sense. 
---
Oh. Okay ill check that out as well! 
---
Like from WoW the game HS is based on?
---
THats interesting. Deck idea:
---
anduin, darkness, brann and every single card that steals cards from your your opponents deck. Assuming the same bug works with other "casts when drawn spells". Hakkar could also work 
---
As many as Nozdormu probably.
---
How do you know?
---
Nah that's just a clever and sneaky wolf
---
13k wins no goldens only 4 regular.

I mostly just stop playing until next season. I don't recommend this method, its just what happens. :-p

thanks for doing this. was actually thinking about doing it too. now i can be lazy af again

Idk maybe midrange secrets

---
naga sea witch was a 5 mana 5/5 before they just decided that because they made a retarded decision, they'd perform a second retarded one and make naga 8 mana.

Similar thing if you cube the anub'arak, play it again, opponent polymorphs anub'arak, the cube spawns 2x sheeps.

It was silenced by his [[Ironbeak Owl]].
---
I want to play competitive with more than 4 mythics in a deck.
---
In Eternal Legendarys and Stone used to craft cards are literally thrown at you, Even in Hearthstone you get more legendarys than magic.
---
Did he silence your bearshark, in the history bar , it show he play the owl card.  i think it's just a visual bug from the silence.

Hey, I hope you get to see this: I found an odd warrior tech choice that works really well vs OTK decks, and that I thought was really cool.
---
This was around rank 3, so it's not just some random inclusion IMO. 
---
The inclusion is using blackwald pixie in order to refresh your hero power. That makes it so that once you get to your quest, you can hit for 16 a turn with your hero power instead of just 8. That should help a lot vs control decks if you find yourself consistently just 1 or 2 hero powers away. 
---
Looks like they played the ironbeak owl and silenced the Bearshark first, the targeted it with the hero power.
---
cough brannalai
---
I did never experience this bug myself? How fast do you actually have to click?
---
If it's in your hand then it doesn't get buffed. So unless it's a firefly, dagger is probably still better on that turn.
---
Warlock has a traditionally bad match-up against hunter because life tap is bad against steady shot
---
If he targeted your unsilenced bearshark then you found a huge bug
---
back when I played hearthstone people like you really pissed me off for a different reason.
---
I only add people because I really liked our game, and by the time you add me, **you don't remember it anymore** so I'm wasting my time telling you about how cool your turn 6 play was, while you're trying to mine salt out of me. I just wanted to make friends but the trolls ruined it for me.
---
Of course, but there is a small chance of that happening. I believe MTG has less of the bullshit that HS has. 
---
[removed]
---
I don't use any deck tracker or Hearthpwn ..
---
What does rank have to do with anything? Deck suggestion was based on the fact you possibly lack Zuljin/ Rhok. Please don't go around crafting cards that are rotating out in April. 
---
2 Explosive Trap/ 2 Wandering/ 2 Freezing + 2 spellstone
---
2 Play Dead/ 2 Devilsaur Egg/ 2 Terrorscale Stalker/ 2 Stitched/ 2 Grizzly/ 1 Amani Warbear/ 1 Kathrena/ 1 King Krush/ 2 Cube/ DK Rexxar/ 2 Flanking/ 1 Gluttonous/ 1 Houndmaster Shaw/ 1 Spellbreaker/ 1 Flare
---
I don't play hunter's mark or candleshot because there aren't too many cubelocks/ evenlocks around and I found the secret package more effective vs aggro/ spell hunter same reason for not playing spider bombs. I was contemplating adding houndmaster (there are quite a lot of beasts) or even Void ripper (flipping cube'd grizzly's is fun). I don't like tracking as a card because sometimes the choices are too punishing.
---
I've played spell hunter w/o Zuljin (because I forgot to put him in the deck) and it's still good, rhok however is a value card which is pretty hit or miss (sometimes you get crap like play dead, stampede, etc or good stuff like an additional spellstone or multiple kill commands).
---
Most OTK decks require the use of one if not multiple legendary cards. Perhaps if you want a cheaper OTK you could take a look at a hunter deck making use of stonetusk boar + dire frenzy (+ emeriss) or perhaps the newer shirvallah + holy wrath combo. PM me if you need help with deck building or if you are left with more questions. 
---
You think someone so willing to spew their opinion in every hearthstone thread every day would bother to do their research on the game and card discussions from other pros and actual devs.
---
I think baku/genn get points for at least being interesting ideas even if they are extremely problematic
---
I hope Bwomsamdi will get some value in next expansions, as using spirits with good minions is just super awesome ( as I am sometimes able to shuffle amara for 1 mana in my "lets have a fun with quest priest" deck )
---
[[Spreading Aids]]
---
it's funny and not intrusive so I enjoy the peppers
---
I would probably agree with this. It's existence created an extremely uninteractive combo deck and also meant they can't print strong shaman or neutral battlecries for it.

6/-/- | Summon a 1/5 Scarab with Taunt. If your opponent has more minions, cast this again.  
---
Cool
---
Idk how many different cards there are and how many copies of each you play but that just seems like they will run out of codes quickly lol
---
why
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt realize. I‚Äôll look into alternative decks too then. Thanks!
---
Makes sense .. Hearthstone is like the fast food of games
---
The issue with trying to punish players for not using their available mana crystals while they're still gaining one a turn is they rarely if ever leave ones filled because they want to. 
---
For example, Midrange Hunters have really only ever had one good turn four play, Houndmaster, while they typically play between eight and twelve three cost cards. As such, they almost always have a hanging mana left on that turn, which a card with your proposed mechanic on it would then steal, leaving the Hunter two full mana behind.
---
That is a ramp advantage so early in the game almost no deck could actually keep up with, and in the late game, even with that five mana cap, you would be setting your opponent back to five mana while you get an additional five for a turn.
---
It is a mechanic that cannot be made to work within the framework of a generally fair game.
---
I'm 200 in and still haven't won
---
The devs didnt just decide that they wouldnt be adding any more beasts to rexxars pool for no good reason lmfao.
---
Don‚Äôt dust cards to make other cards, that‚Äôs a major reason why you‚Äôre asking how to make it easier to craft decks.  The bigger your collection the less stuff you need to craft to make your next deck because you already have it.
---
Wild is ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù in that when you craft a Tier 1 deck, unless it gets nerfed, it stays in the meta longer because there‚Äôs no rotations.  Save your dust and craft Even Shaman or Odd Rogue and you‚Äôll be able to play it perhaps indefinitely.  Even Shaman in particular is also much cheaper than its Standard equivalent, so might be exactly the deck you‚Äôre looking for.
---
No, it's because NetEase has a reputation among Chinese players for trashy p2w games (which, for a playerbase that's generally ok with p2w, that's saying something), and also because Diablo is a Blizzard franchise.  If Blizzard wants to retain the last vestiges of their reputation for quality, they shouldn't farm out their franchises to ill-regarded companies.
---
Its basically the left wing equivalent of r/the_donald
---
Yeah, Kibler in the thumbnails is often Kibler during the highlighted games.
---
I agree. It makes the jarring loss of three expansions of cards way less and keeps some archetypes in the game for longer. Frozen throne, K and C literally define decks and a lot of them will not even come close to existing when they rotate. DK reliant decks are gone, Kobold‚Äôs insane warlock class cards will be gone (as well as other classes), and the card pool will be the lowest at the start of every year. Even the surviving decks are mostly Baku reliant so they would just suffer the next time around. 
---
We won't know what's going on but HS esports has been very low for the past 1 year and a half. 
---
I used to have friends who would watch the same streams and HCT (back when Ostkaka won) but we don't care any more.

---
Hey it‚Äôs Hireek‚Äôs true mana cost
---
You can‚Äôt disenchant the basic core cards from each class, the game just wont let you. The only cards you can disenchant are from the sets. 
---
Automatically when you goto your collection and then click on ‚Äúcrafting‚Äù the game will let you know you have more then 2 of a card in the bottom right corner of the crafting menu, so when  you have more then 2 of a card you can disenchant the extras which gives you dust(which will also tell you how much dust you will get from disenchanting them) , there is no reason to have more then 2 cards because you can only have a maximum of 2 in a deck, (1 For legendary) 
---
The only other way to get dust is from the monthly chest which you get by winning 5 games in ranked play. 
---
The daily quests just give you gold. You dont get dust from them. 
---
You know what I think would have made Deathstalker Rexxar far less of a problem? Not tying the beast-making mechanic to the hero power. When it's tied to the hero power, it's essentially an infinite value generator that you can plug into any Hunter deck without concern. Make it tied to something else, and maybe that'd fix that issue at least to a point.
---
How about this for an idea, considering they pushed Spell Hunter in the very next expansion so they'd know what they were going for: "When you cast a spell, create a Zombeast."
---
It's still incredibly powerful, especially in Spell Hunter, don't get me wrong, but at the very least it's tied to something that might cause a few more issues. Most spells are more then 2 mana, after all, and they do require targets to use them on more often then not.
---
I remember when Savjz used to get this bug couple times.
---
He was an apm god. A legend, now a myth as he is no longer with us...
---
Two [[Sorcerer's Apprentice]] + [[Kobold Geomancer]] + [[Frostbolt]] + two Arcane Teachings is a six mana OTK if you played no more than one other spell beforehand, since you could discover a zero mana Frostbolt and a zero mana Arcane Teachings each time.

Okay maybe not "really fun" but it'd at least look like an outlier and actually be satirical.

I got my hopes up long enough for it to hurt when I saw the rest of the post

Anyone else‚Äôs deck gonna get gutted if it happens?

Haha yeah it's a good problem to have I suppose. I meant that either I was able to have a fully charged spellstone and the opponent had no answer or snowball some other way. I'm annoyed that I spent 1600 dust on a card I haven't been able to use yet haha

they just look at posts when someone reports it. so i guess that post had some complaints.

Why does OK Go always make the most amazing music videos ever?  Came here to hearthstone, ended up in an OK Go hole.  Thanks a lot man... thanks a lot.
---
I assume you don't have the skull??
---
Lol nope died before i drew it
---
Well, yeah.  Building a beast with multiple options is fun.  It wasn't about power level, it was about making the card make sense and be fun.  If they didn't update it it'd be like jeweled macaw only giving beasts from ungoro and previous, or arcane dynamo not giving you RR cards, or blazing invocation not working on anything past WW.
---
Didn't the anti taunt hog see a decent amount of arena play?
---
Crafted Chogal day one. I thought the effect was applied till your next cast not next turn
---
Well, yeah, no spells ever process death in the middle of Spell Text Phase, so there is plenty of time between minion being set pending destroy and actually being moved to the Graveyard. Setting a minion pending destroy does not prevent interacting with it before it is removed, and a minion which it transforms into was never a target of Naturalize in the first place.
---
This interaction is completely logical from Hearthstone rules perspective.
---
Point me any meta that people don't complain about.
---
Nothing different from evenlock though.
---
It probably would be. Still stung tho :(
---
Good job I only managed to clear 4 bosses so far.
---
I mistook it with the quest (the one I crafted because omg quest hunter will be so oppressive for sure)
---
Zuljin is fine i think... That DK guldan hero power though...
---
Noobs hating frost lich jaina and guldan or dk reddar i dindt see ppl complaining when frozen throne came out . They r balanced in the sense that they all have  in fin i t e  value  ofcourse guldan and zulzin are bit op becase of the impact they make wich can be game changing but frostlich jainabor dk rexxar are fine in that terms especially  jaina now that iceblock is gone 
---
Last meta that was stacked with expansions like now was worse. The Nzoth Guldan deathrattle warlocks were just way, way worse.
---
Good videos, but bad music. :/
---
Have you tried playing Casino Mage? I expect you have but it‚Äôs a really fun deck when your bored.
---
January 5th. Just wait till then.
---
What's awesome is that the bosses have a different response for each of your emotes. 
---
Ah-HA!
---
Whoops, forgot that. I also have a casino mage deck.
---
Careful... I listened to a website and dusted stuff like king krush which i totally regretted a few months later
---
I don't think Curator himself was ever that amazing.
---
No, it would confuse new players.
---
Have you tried Freeze Mage or normal OTK Mage with Thaurissan?
---
When the Chimera Ant Hero Rexxar rotates, the deck will loose it‚Äôs most consistent and valuable card. Lets hope they don‚Äôt release a Meruem Hunter card though
---
Myra. After playing a while I realized that Violet Haze has much bigger chance of giving you something good and you don't have to spend so much mana for a shitty body.
---
Myra is basically only good if you get Mechanized Whelp.
---
Jep, freeze mage is kinda fun but gets pretty boring after some consequtive matches and Thaurissan OTK I only play once in a while because I like a challenging match that feels fair for both players 
---
Thought Krag'wa would be better, it's great, don't get me  wrong, but I overestimated it for sure.
---
Have u tried even mage? Controltheboard made a cool and fun deck for wild
---
It's a joke. Blizzard uses this excuse to justify their changes or lack of changes. 
---
Well, I'm not losing to odd paladins... I am losing to decks like odd warrior, odd quest warrior, taunt druid...
---
It Is favoured, but not too much
---
I seriously doubt it. Are they even through a single arc since the end of the anime?
---
&gt; Comments you can hear
---
I wonder if Blizzard will actually take any action before the rotation.
---
Hunter is the highest winrate class, by a significant amount, while also being the most played class by a very large amount. This means Hunter/Hunter mirrors are dragging Hunter's winrate to 50%, so it's winrate v the other 8 classes is *even higher* than it's listed winrate.
---
Hunterstone is kinda absurd right now. While it's arguable if any deck is T0 right now, T1 is basically dominated by Hunter.
---
Golden Mechathun. I went 1-6 on mechathun druid on release. 
---
Why gonk isn't the largest?
---
I don't craft day 1, I don't craft week 1,  I barely even craft month 1. 
---
This expansion I had my first ever day 1 craft, Shirvallah, purely to play the OTK deck. He is certainly not bad at all, but I don't have the DK, so I don't play him much now.
---
The absolute worst card I have ever crafted is Vaalera, but I had so much fun with it so no regrets.
---
Just put him in deathrattle hunter for fun
---
You mean while Emerald Spellstone rotates.
---
Nah, I thought so at first too. I thought it was so long and slow, and had no emotional core (because I didn't really care about kite cause we just met him)
---
But everything past when they raid the palace, is the best part of the whole show. Meruem vs netero, Gon vs pitou, the climax with Meruem and komugi, all so good.
---
hof cards will be leeroy, lighting storm and savannah highmane.
---
all 3 are just way too relevant.
---
That‚Äôs not always the case, there are cards that could increase mana costs of spells, and especially in arena, it‚Äôs all about speed and board control. a 4/6 turn 2 can be amazing, waiting till turn 3 is slower.
---
There's not too much to talk about. Its a month or so into the expansion, post nerfs, and the meta has settled. Nothing is absurdly OP (talking post nerf cubelock, pirate warrior, etc) and there really isnt any major events or news. What are people supposed to discuss?
---
Quest Rogue
---
My laptop ran it poorly and it wouldn‚Äôt even start sometimes. I read a tip to ‚ÄúScan &amp; Repair‚Äù before you start the game and it actually made it a lot smoother and it didn‚Äôt drop frames every time I selected a card. See if that helps you out. 
---
Uh. It's like two taps for a giant. And the closer you get to 15 hp the closer you get to 7/7 with taunt.
---
Mechathun druid isn't too bad right now ! 
---
Be the change you want to see in the world 
---
The only Chimera i respect is called Nina
---
I'll take a stab at answering ya - from what I understand (and this is from what I read, personally never happened to me), if you click too fast right after playing a minion that can attack immediately (on the minion's portrait), then the minion becomes unclickable for the rest of the game unless you restart the client.
---
And from what I understand, yes you can reproduce it consistently, you just have to click fast for it to happen.
---
Because your other options were Lorewalker Cho and The Darkness

Priest mechathun is relatively consistent if you want to give it another go. Pretty good vs hunter and anything slow.
---
As we should. There had been no card that randomly generated stuff that was limited to one set and rexxar shouldn't have been an exception. Blizzard dropped the ball by making lots of cheap beasts with insane keywords like rush and rush/poisonous/lifesteal combos that made the card from a big dude factory that was hard for control decks to beat to a card that can singlehandedly turn games it has no business turning.
---
Then umm charge Is..........fak I always loose in arguments,first with me girlfriend now dis
---
Yeah, hard to keep track of interesting discussions and information in the midst of all these random screenshots of RNG plays, singleplayer rounds and arena plays..

I follow this subreddit since a few weeks back, havent seen much of interest yet. I‚Äôll give it another week or so before i unfollow again.

It's just that in general when people have valid things to say they don't have to resort to spewing insults and profanity. But hey, I'll bite. What's the context? I know that Kibler has criticized WotC in the past, but I've also seen him criticize Blizzard in the past.
---
I think hunter is one of the healthier classes to be top tier, its not as opresive as when control classes are top dogs, and deny you from playing the game.
---
Remember - the motto of agro is ‚Äúface is the place‚Äù
---
You must filter cards as wild. Also I suggest you to think twice if you are to build wild decks, as things are pretty wild in there.
---
Would you mind sharing a wild lakkari list that has a good winrate ? cheers 
---
Damn bro you are such a cool dude. Damn bro tell me how I can be cool like you pleaaaaase
---
And now it will be an eternal coding strain on the game as they go back to it and update it for all eternity while everyone bitches and moans about it.
---
The manga was turned into a light novel
---
1 mana discover an imp would be alrite in wild at least if imp gang boss is included
---
But he didn‚Äôt say Yorknew
---
Yes, please add that to Number 50123182312 on the list of things that Blizzard has to do
---
"GeT dOwN!"
---
looks like an all right deck but i only have 12 of the30 cards needed.
---
Won't get the chance - you Nightmare the zombeast and then rush your Mech'thun into it for lethal.
---
Hold on, are you telling me you don't like 7 videos a day of, "Disguised Toast Crazy Turn 5 Lethal!!" With 9 people posting a clip of a topdeck or vaguely interesting quote from a streamer? That shit was the worst. If I want to go amd watch streamers I'll go to their twitch or YouTube. There was a point where this sub could have been renamed r/twitchstone.
---
The "Please don't call me "The "The Room" Room" Room of The Room thumbnails.
---
Most gamers are babies, and devs have to work around that constantly. I've spoken to game devs who have said that they would love to be more communicative, share more details and game dev secrets etc. but when they behave well they only ever get punished for it. Easier to just place several layers between yourself and the players.
---
Game \*publishers\*, however, are usually pretty shitty. Important to distinguish the two.
---
I might as well have crafted a legendary. I crafted two Immortal Prelates and two A New Challengers. That deck didn‚Äôt work out.
---
One of them has 5 golden legendaries in it.
---
Because they are rexxar DK fanboys. Remember when they changed witchwood grizzly's art just to look like a beast instead of a spectral thing? They did it just to keep the beast tag but they never removed it from Arfus because they wanted it in the zombiests poll according to what they stated on social media. 
---
Yeah once I get home.
---
My fav arc
---
It is a fun card that does too much to cover Hunter's weaknesses. Whereas Jaina and Gul'dan are more synergistic and enable archetypes, Rexxar is great independent of the rest of your deck and can thus be put in without too much of an additional cost (especially at 6 mana, which is also when you'd want to transition game plan conveniently).
---
In wild the card is much more balanced because of the faster format, but the question is whether it stiffles other builds because it makes it unnecessary to commit (your deck) to the late game. 
---
I am not sure whether or not Rexxar should be nerfed. He is fun for the person playing it, but not for the opponent. If his mana cost is increased it would restrict which decks can play him, such as Reno hunter (yes I have played against it, and yes it won :/ ). Thus it becomes less of a plan B and more of an actual part of the deck that you build around. 
---
It should be noted that cubelock Gul'dan and Raza Shadowreaper have received similar amounts of hate. But they were both cards which derived a lot of strength through their synergy, and are now in line with where they ought to be. Rexxar however would require a direct nerf.
---
Hoping for naturalize, divine favor, flame imp and wild pyromancer
---
What value does this serve? XD
---
Sure, stay tuned for Hunter X Hunter 2035
---
This one is really cheap, you will have no issues building it after you reach that rank 25. But be cautious because many of these cards rotate in april (possibly may) so keep that in mind
---
&gt; For Kibler, it's his constant mousing around the board.
---
Man, I hate when people keep mousing over their cards.
---
There's often good discussions in r/wildhearthstone 
---
Try Chump's Halazzi Quest Hunter if you have the cards.
---
I‚Äôm still holding out for dollmaster. I think he has potential 
---
Me too! Hi5
---
Really, that seems like a profoundly niche request that would cover up an important piece of information in game or at the very least clutter the GUI with between two and four lines of information the vast, vast majority of players would not care about.
---
None on the Spot. Thrall Deathseer by now, as he sucks without Doppelgangsters in Standard and is too slow for Wild altogether. 
---
Does anyone else remember how butthurt this sub was when they said DK rexxar wouldn‚Äôt have access to beasts from new expansions? 
---
I'm only sad because I have been playing spell hunter for 3 seasons now. I used to be a snowflake now everyone thinks I am a bandwagoner.
---
Hireek was only released to annoy wild players, enjoy your suffering while it lasts.
---
Did you only just realize what it means for sets to rotate?
---
If you like it, try it in a spell hunter deck right now. Just take a normal spell hunter deck and replace Rok'delar, 2x To my side and one other card and add Halazzi, the Quest, Master's call and Stitched tracker.
---
It is worse then the normal Spell hunter, but you can easily climb with it. Obviously the plan is to get Halazzi and then get 7 Lynxes out of it to complete the quest with.
---
I'd say anything that doesn't show up on VS's reports is off-meta.
---
It's one of the four horsemen if anyone's wondering
---
They‚Äôve said it doesn‚Äôt. Blues have said the reason DK Rexxar didn‚Äôt work at first the way he does now is because they have to hard-code every build a beast.
---
Sounds like the hard way to do it, but like ya said spaghetti code. 
---
Your comment is more cringe then feminists
---
You've basically summed up all of (online) gaming.
---
cause they knew it was much worse than the other 2.
---
source: my ass
---
Seems blue to me
---
Even more high quality content - WE ARE BLESSED!!!
---
Blizzard is only going to lose money on wild nerfs when absolutely necessary.
---
You use sunfury protector, if undatakah already copies immortal prelate he will keep enchantments including taunt
---
Yeah I‚Äôm noticing that they don‚Äôt care to even try balancing wild. Probably because it makes them no money. Only giving changes for something too broken like the aviana combo
---
I crafted Patches because it was op. Played Jade Shaman with a pirate package, rolled on people, felt bad that I had to become the villain to succeed, dusted all legendaries, crafted Millhouse and a Golden Millhouse and uninstalled the game...eventually I came back but it was really through watching Asmodai do well playing fun/inexpensive decks.

wild has dirty rat. chain gang got changed so standard is good
---
Would kill for kali(and king krush tbh)
---
This has happened so often to me and I hate losing games just because I wasn't able to make a trade or finish off my opponent with a charge minion.
---
PS: My HS name is CoinPingFace.
---
This is what he is referring to in his rant.
---
Ive gotten  him with lucky draws from discouver a random elemental. And really wish i had him. Aswell as king krush tbh
---
Yup - I guess some people just don't have the plain simple exposure of playing with many different types of people, even for games as simple as say, Monopoly. 
---
When you deal with a crowd that makes up their own house rules, don't follow all the rules as per the official guide(I've never played with group that knew they could mortgage their property).
---
Or even played with say, a D&amp;D group where the GM chose not to award any experience for defeating monsters, but only for character development and discovering new territory.
---
There are people out there who purposefully make things harder and less enjoyable than they could be(and they're long-time friends and family). It's not a new and ground-breaking thing that suddenly sprung out of nowhere.
---
Infinite combos are generally fine when they're relegated to high power formats, are just too inconsistent to work reliably, or are at the very least are easily preyed upon by the aggressive decks. Shudderwock in Wild falls into the former and latter. Such combos, especially when made unintentionally by design as I feel Shudderwock was, can be quite interesting.
---
Doesn't seem that there's room for a Knife Juggler
---
I wish you could pick from all classes in rumble run would have been alot more fun to me
---
Applojuice#1851 NA 80G quest trade, you go first. I've done this many times.
---
I had an awesome one I wish I had recorded. Beat the last boss on turn 1. I was the warlock where if My hero took damage it was dealt to the enemy hero. He was the paladin where if he took damage it did 5 damage to the enemy hero. Turn 1 I get an imp that deals 3 damage to self. Was the most satisfying win I've had in rumble run.
---
Obviously. Still not broken 
---
The quest isn't particularly useful against Even Paladin either. As long as they have at least one mana left over, they'll be able to further reduce the chances of the eight random damage from hitting their hero. Plus, removing the Corpsetaker as soon as possible if dropped on four will more likely have a tangible effect on who wins the game over completing the quest.

Nice that still didn‚Äôt answer my question

would be even better if it actually helped you win in any way

Yes, validation of hypotheses is interesting, jesus christ no need to be contrarian.

Haha, fair enough
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/deck-library/mage-decks/
---
That's probably because it's an AOE spell that doesn't target anything, so it just uses its effect immediately. A more accurate way to write Naturalize would be "Target a minion. Your opponent draws two cards. The minion dies." Since drawing certain cards like Scroll of Wonders can interrupt the process, its effect plays out before Naturalize's ends. Whereas with Poison Seeds, there's no interruption. Minions just die.
---
Well don't play it then? 
---
Yea man same i have them all (i opened my gold one though) 
---
That is rng flanking strike, depending on your deck 3 1/1s should be deal with more eazily. I dont have ptsd of the card but its 1/3 bad 1/3 good and 1/3 very good (rng bonus). 
---
Well, it will probably become meta in Wild at some point, so... I wouldn't regret it.
---
Big Panda then?
---
Your response to his comment is unhelpful. You failed to address his very accurate point on how players behave at different ranks (the Spikes and Timmies). You aren‚Äôt listening. It would seem that you are here to pick fights not discuss. If this goes on, your post will fail to gain any traction. Your destiny is in your own hands.
---
Is that you Malfurion ? 
---
You look .. blue. 
---
how does this answer my question??
---
Some picks are just automatic .. Godfrey, Sunkeeper Tarim. Lich King if he‚Äôs not up against the aforementioned two. 
---
I wanted give the same response to a few comments here so I'll just make a comment and tag the users I am responding to (/u/triablos1, /u/Penedorio, /u/nowrongwrong, /u/Armorend, /u/StyleNine). Let me make it clear that this is just me responding as a redditor and not as a mod. Our stance as mods is to enforce the rules and we are defaulting on our jobs, if we are missing any posts that should be removed, but I am just trying to explain why it is so hard/frustrating.
---
The reason I became a mod was to help and be part the community I enjoyed participating in. I thought I had a thick skin but in the past few months I have gotten annoyed with the time I have to spend replying to people arguing that their post should not have been removed and reports calling us pieces of shit if they don't agree with the decision of approving something. 
---
It just feels like a thankless job where everyone hates you. If you look at my comment history it's mainly just downvoted removal comments (the frequency of which has dwindled as well) and I am particpating less and less as a user on the sub and in fact just lurking than commenting or posting on reddit. I've only been doing a couple hours of going through reports every day for the past few months and was only talking yesterday to other mods about how I am feeling a bit refreshed and will do more mod queue clearing and will also try and participate with the community like I used to before I was a mod. And I did comment on a few posts even.
---
Now let's take for example this post - https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ad1pkh/coming_or_leaving_soon_april_19/. I am not sure if it meets the criteria for 'restricted image', I have to ask someone else for their opinion then I either remove or approve it and I know I am probably going to have to spend a few mins of back and forth on modmail with some users messaging about the decision, as every time we remove a highly voted post or allow one memey one, someone gets mad why theirs was removed or why we are not doing our jobs. But I am going to do exactly that and ask for a second opinion and act on it and I know the reponse isn't going to positive for either decision, sigh.
---
I think it can easily become a very fun legendary in Wild in the future.
---
[Eh, still better than Wild lol](https://i.imgur.com/Pqa3HcC.jpg)
---
The two lists featured there are as optimized as it gets. You can get ideas for which cards to use. 
---
Found the incel

So all of your picks are OP as fuck. What a coincidence that all worst designed cards were OP (waygate is debatable but Iceblock were anyoing enoth to get the power up).

Because particular classes have never been popular before in the history of Hearthstone. It's quite okay. Take a deep breath.

---
Every few days I have the urge to make a post flaming the shit out of Blizzard for their handling of the game over the past 2 years.
---
And every few days I remember Blizzard doesn't give a shit so it won't matter if I get 10k upvotes or minus-987. The end result is the same.
---
There are other subs that support deckbuilding, theorycrafting and competitive discussion. This sub is just for screenshots and trying to casually enjoy an unenjoyable game.
---
Interesting, and it looks pretty close to what people were playing a while back with quest patron warrior. 
---
Why Keleseth? Skipping turns 1 and 2, can actually be deadly in wild and Keleseth himself has a pretty weak body that dies to almost any turn 2 play against aggro (Ship's Cannon, Murkspark, Upgraded Dagger strike, amongst other things). 
---
Countess Ashmore is a 7 mana do nothing on board, which seems a little slow. So is Dr Boom, although he is annoying as heck to clear properly.
---
Looks interesting, I'd recommend testing it out on wild ladder and see what happens.
---
Pride #1239 NA i show, you go first
---
Sorry about the negativity, don‚Äôt really know why I commented that
---
A good idea, bit expensive on the dust front though
---
I want to try a really strange off meta deck but does anyone know what happens if you play Mojomaster Zihi and then break Twig of the World Tree?
---
No they won't, blizz is too lazy
---
They already said that they would in early 2019. They are changing the bosses and buckets to reflect the nerfs, namely, leeching poison with rouge.
---
Lollll yes that's me I greet before killing 
---
Did you also find Bananas?
---
because this one used to be a lot better 
---
There's not much potential outside of shudderthun shaman, some fringe battle cry rogue, and cthun druid with aviana and kun but now its no longer possible since the nerf, so yeah... cthun decks are not cheap.... 
---
When did they say that?

How can you tell someone squelched you

Imagine filling a druid deck with 29 innervates, 29 coldlight oracles, 1 mecha'thun, and one neuralize. turn 5 otk if you chain it for as long as you can each turn.
---
Can you blame him for being tired of 1000 salt posts a day?
---
&gt; Hunter is not too powerful
---
if there are decks literally just doing well because of the amount of hunters, that's a problem. Blizzards actions are what caused this huge spike in popularity, not the players. There's way too many players for this to just be random action by the players. 
---
I didn't know that, thanks I'll test it sometime
---
How do you play this deck, do you hero power turn 3 with 1 drop or just play the 3 drop ... Im confused cant get a win :) on rank 5 :) 
---
&gt; there's no way this is going to change as balancing nine classes perfectly is probably never going to happen
---
from my kingsbane (pre-nerf data only, obviously): the most played class had 20% appearance. That's not perfectly balanced, but it does clearly show that the amount of hunter played now is just obscene 
---
Your mother and sister doesn't  count.
---
Yeah, after hours sticking like that. It must feels good, gz!
---
Find a buyer or give it away 
---
They should simply nerf Genn and Baku and Hunter and other stuff. Short and long term solution that's better done now 
---
My housemate has the same I guess "tick" when he plays. I always have to slap his wrist because it kills my thought process. I understand it's similar to "hey BATTA BATTA" in baseball but like...we are just playing for fun, why fuck with my decisions?

I can't wait for DKs to rotate out, they make the game boring as fuck. Every endgame versus a Mage or Hunter is the same and turns into a perpetual cycle of gameplay.

Yeah, looking back the evolution capabilities of the Chimera ants are really unique. No other anime comes to mind where the enemy is a species that is dangerous based solely on their ability to evolve over time, and in this case, become essentially just like humans.
---
Thanks for the writeup, would be interested in what you think of religion too. Nothing immediately comes to mind, except the 1 ruler for the country that the Chimera ants started in I guess
---
Or Chameleos shows you the same card 3 turns in a row.
---
I don't mind Hunter too much, but Secrets and especially DK Rexxar just make games take so much longer with more of the same thing. DK Rexxar isn't even really a problem card I think, but it's just so boring to play against.
---
‚ÄúKomugi, are you still there?‚Äù

How would you know he squelched you? You don‚Äôt get any indication they did. 
---
Isn't Paladin by far the highest winrate class? They have 3 tier 1 decks while Hunter has 1. There are a lot of Hunters but they aren't overpowered.
---
Chump. Best youtuber.
---
According to the latest Data Reaper, Paladin has three tier 1 decks (odd, even, exodia), while Hunter's only one is Cube.
---
I would like to see more content about off-meta decks, and I think it would even be good for the game for it to be so.  For many people, it is nearly impossible to find something non-meta *but decent* to play.  The popular deck sites either have little quality control (like hearthpwn); or they only show meta decks (hsreplay), and if a deck isn't a meta deck then it is renamed to be one due to recognition algorithms.
---
I can control if my own deck is interesting and novel, but I can't control if my opponent's is, so I kind of have to rely on the community for that.
---
I play double thun in wild, maybe try that
---
It was one of the first things I saw when I saw the card. I've tried it, and while you highroll your way to victory quite often now, the deck isn't really ever going to be above tier 2 at best.
---
Control, kripp, trump, and disguised toast.
---
r/Pathofexile is also really good and relatively high-traffic, it has more active users than r/hearthstone (twice as many at time of writing).  There are meme posts and they get upvoted, but there's also a good mix of balance discussion, clips/youtubes of high-level play, community issues or feature requests (it helps that GGG actually pays attention to those), streamer drama, new player help, praise for the game, mechanics posts, etc.  I think there's something for everyone on that subreddit.
---
I'm not sure what the secret sauce is, but I really enjoy that subreddit.
---
Doesn't make sense to nerf hunters, otherwise the business idea about getting Zuljin at every cost would be destroyed. They rather took down Shudderwock or Druid ( which was around a year  with the same 20 cards ) and Blizzard (Activision?) rather took risk to nerf those druid cards and have a hunter meta for 4 months. I guess after rotation hunter will drop rapidly because of loosing lots of good cards like flanking strike, DK, deathrattle cards, stone, etc.. 
---
If any of the cards you want are in an adventure (eg Curator in Karazhan) you should definitely get it - it‚Äôs a really good value.
---
I'm going to really dumb this down to grade school language so even you can understand.   
---
Say you borrow my pencil. If I come up to you and say, "Why don't I have my pencil" or even "Where's my pencil" do you think that's because I want to know it's status? Where it is? I think if you rub your two brain cells together you'll realize the implication there is that I want my pencil back.
