Jaina has a face? Hmm I just noticed. 
---
On a side note, Alex into Vargoth + double mind blast is a 2TK unless the enemy heals or armors up. Way better than the current iteration with Anduin DK, since you don't have the condition of playing the DK.
---
This is it. This is the post the made me leave r/hearthstone 
---
Cast Fireball. Play this guy. This guy Fireballs himself.
---
Babies don't go clang.
---
Right?
---
Like I've never been a big fan of her hearthstone portrait, but this is pretty cool.
---
Not unlimited but you could complete the quest, double leyline manipulator, play archmage vargoth later and cast the quest and molten reflection for a chance at getting 4 turns, with 3 full turns at 10 mana and the 1 mana left over from turn 1.  Or guarantee the combo with faceless manipulator instead of molten reflection. 
---
It's like watching ten fat guys rushing to the buffet for the last piece of cake.
---
One Piece, as naraq already commented before me
---
It should be roughly 67,920 dust to craft the whole set (or 56,800 all epics and legendaries). However, I absolutely would not recommend disenchanting your Wild collection for the sake of one set, especially since we have no clue what the Standard meta will look like post-rotation. 
---
Not keeping myras on mulligan phase... Nice players in the final.

Is MCT good in odd warrior? Doesn't seem too bad, it could let you delay a board clear in some situations, I'll have to try it
---
One interesting application might be running the quest in renomage. You can use your first extra turn to play antonidas and simulacrum, the latter of which is recast end of turn so now you got two extra apprentices. For the fourth apprentice you can then use either molten reflection or echo or probably something else I can't think about right now.

This is getting pretty ridiculous at this point. We're gonna get a full-on Hearthstone movie for these card reveals, hahaha

Wow rogue legendaries and the real deal this expansion.
---

This is the best video I‚Äôve ever seen for HS. This guy should be hired by Hollywood. 
---
Let's just do it and be legends.
---
In that particular match-up, the only thing you could've done is open with Devilsaur Egg, Play Dead, and Terrorscale Stalker. Otherwise, Deathrattle Hunter is too slow of a deck to reasonably pressure really any combo deck.
---
Topic right below yours:
---
&gt;I'm so sick of losing to OTK decks

Heh, most people hate OTK decks.  
---
GlacialSpark#1579 NA - 80g trade, you first 
---
my call is rng bomb warrior. just pirate warrior but with bombs.
---
Too slow. Sad!
---
That‚Äôs literally the point of this thread 
---
Blizzard should really consider hire him or his team.
---
Run Skulking Geist if you want to beat that particular deck easily. 
---
cutlass is witchwood. however it still gets oozed so heal rogue is still cock blocked from the meta (thank god).
---
WOW
---
Are Pirates that good in Warrior in Standard, though? Don't get me wrong, I love Southsea Deckhand, but without Patches the Pirate and Bloodsail Corsair I'm not convinced that Pirate Warrior is a thing in Standard right now.
---
If your opponent hand is full, one vanish to trigger deathrattle, one to kill deathrattles!
---
these guys know how to make awesome cards reveal. Kudos for them.
---

---
Are you drunk?
---
Having a shrine does not make a game of commander. We're not even playing against a single person much less a group. We're not building our own decks and we don't have only 1 of copies.
---
Any Reno deck is closed to commander.
---
Enjoy rumble run, sure. But it ain't commanded or even close. 
---
The meme potential with this card...
---
Ah. Nice. Glad OP didn't dust it. 
---
Wait, speaking of...you can togwaggles scheme a coldlight oracle with this new guy on board as long as you discount it...Im likin this :D
---
I was really happy this wasn't compatible with flamestrike until you said this.
---
Damn, now it's a big priest card.
---
Or token, if they want to make druid good again.
---
So healing synergy.
---
seen that exact thing in dane's video
---
And then you got wierdos trying to make aggro priest a thing. Or even better testsubject/Cho/togwaggle a thing.

---
So he gets the title Archmage but not Dadgar?
---
Yeah this is a trash definition. You essentially name power creep utterly impossible and this a useless phrase.
---
Any conceivable possible strictly better card is, for example, either worse in jousts or worse against things like mind control, death grip, etc. So we don't count those and move on to better usable definitions.
---
I'll be blunt and say I am not enjoying the Standard meta right now, but it'll probably perk up *a lot* once the rotation happens in like a week. But I will say that Wild is *super* fun right now and that if you want you can always try that out.
---
That's debatable.  
---
They both actually have a similar point where they could be of use.  
---
Basically both if they have almost no cards left they could be used.  Celestia is a nice body on it's own and if they can't remove Aviana and have nothing much to put down on their turn they are stuffed.  
---
You'd be hard pressed to prove one is worse than another.  
---
Does this mean we'll get Modera??? I'm ready to have some villages burned down!
---
Alright after some thought and taking into account the suggestions of DG and Garb here is the updated version that is probably a bit better.

wow, how is mass resurrection 9 mana for 3 minions when spell stone is 7 for 2 with upgrade capability to 4? What is their design team?
---
That was the best Hearthstone video ever made, cairne wrestling sindragosa is the best thing i've seen
---
4 health for +2/+2 and taunt?

In egg roll?

Egg Roll druid is an aggro deck, playing for tempo, but there's no deck in which that much health is more important than that much tempo.

Lol at this point I really wonder
---
Interesting in that it fills out whatever secrets you already have up, so it is always playable unless you have copies of every secret in play already. 2 mana play 2 secrets and only take up 1 deck slot sounds pretty good to me. Cant control the ordering though which is a small downside.

Absolutely genius! Sorry!

Thank you for this.  good hearty chuckle.

The fact that Songbird doesn't get a chance to play again after only 1 match loss and that Jia only has to win 1 match felt really off to me. Especially for $15k.

Ah, I think we are talking differently here. Yes, it never ( or at least I've never seen that) working with my spell damage, but rather my opponent's spell damage. If so, that if my opponent has spell damage on board he gets more damage from corrupted blood ( and I expect bombs). This is good.

Until another reveal comes close to topping his, LP should get a premium card each time.

What you're describing, your opponent getting extra damfe because of THEIR spelldamage minions, is what got "fixed".

That's pretty much all I play! I have a lot but my favorite so far is Luna's Pocket Galaxy Dragon Mage. Close seconds are a Young Dragonhawk OTK Hunter, Odd Priest, and Even Silverhand Recruits/ Giants Paladin.
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS LITERALLY WILL MAKE TESS ROGUE SO FUCKING VIABLE
---
I am so gonna try this. The chances of it working I think are low but it sounds like it's worth a try
---
7 cost so you dont just espionage right after
---
I'm pretty sure it just adds them to your hand as a 4 mana spell that summons a 4/4
---
IIRC that's how it works if you shadow visions a spooder, and that's probably how this card will work too. Spooders only get autosummoned if you draw them, not directly add them to your hand, I think.
---
It's just disappointing that the meta is that stale. 
---
Oh fuck off.
---
Funny how Big-Time Racketeer gets back in the arena rotation just as this card is released. 
---
I think hidden wisdom will be run now. No more divine favor, and a lot of the new cards encourage multiple cards played each turn (mage is the big example, obviously twinspell in general). And with all the synergy even if it doesn't get activated 1 mana : your opponent only plays 2 cards the rest of the game isn't too bad

Eh. Average. Really depends if you luck into a taunt that first eot

For Mages, besides the Odd Jan'alai deck, my fun deck is what I call a Legacy Control Mage. Pretty much tries to utilize all the wacky Mage cards with all the Mage legendaries (within reason) for just a fun time. From Ragnaros and Luna to Arugal and Toki, it involves a lot of messing around with value cards and cards that don't see a lot of play (such as the mage minion that gains +1/+1 everytime you draw a card). 
---
For Hunter, I go Dinopals (Quest Hunter) to make use of the dinosaur brawl components from Un'Goro + Rastakhan. For a more relevant Hunter deck, (basically one that won't rotate out in a week from now) I use a "Gladiator" Hunter which uses value cards to gain the adv (more than just DK Rexxar).
---
I have a very fun Elemental Shaman deck (similar to Legacy Mage) in that it uses a lot of the legendary (Shaman) cards from the expansions (Kalimos, Shaker, Electra, Shudderwock, Hagatha, Elise, Akar). 
---
Rogue: Tesspionage, esp. With the upcoming burgle support.
---
Priest: Also a little late to the party, but Dragon Priest works really well. Fun deck to play. (Would be even more fun if you have the priest weapon).
---
Warlock: I have a demon deck that is focused on value and stat sticks which just steamrolls like crazy. It's hard to describe tbh, but it reminds me of Kazakus Renolock.
---
How does this work with [[Fal'dorei Strider]]?
---
Do the "Ambush" cards sit in your hand as spells or do they cast?
---
I'm gonna say no, because it's already only an *ok* card, a random chance to do f- all would make it unreasonably bad for no reason

I wonder if 2 armor a turn would make it better. I think it would still probably be too weak to see any play. 
---
I would not play that hypothetical card. I'd rather play millhouse against a mage and hope they don't have that archmage in hand.
---
I believe [[Molten Reflection]] is a targeted spell, and Vargoth recasts are chosenly randomly. If your opponent has minions on board, the combo isn't certain?

I may be wrong.

Renounce Warlock. My deck is bad, but it's basically just 2x Renounce, and then 28 Warlocks cards with a focus on removal/stall/generating new cards. It's really fun when it works, although sometimes you get 10 Divine Shield synergy Paladin cards and have 0 Divine Shields in your entire deck.

What about Flame Imp coin Voodoo Doctor into double Ghouls?

It is kind of weird how rogue actually has basically the best late game in hearthstone out of all the classes but at the same time the class can not support it. I used to have a lot of fun back in the day though when slow control warrior was a meta staple I'd rip them up with just one card, Anub'Arak! They'd just run out of removal and lose. 
---
He born so strong he dont die so fast
---
And yeah, this shit works in every thread.
---
So uh, wheres the card?
---
Lol. That's my only problem with that card. 
---
I bet someone willl pull this off
---
Honestly I'm going to miss Shadowreaper Anduin. It was OP with Raza, but mostly it was just a really solid control card. Not game-warpingly powerful like Jaina or Rexxar, but it was just nice to have some reliable, consistent board control in a class that tends to be notoriously restricted in what they can and can't remove.
---
Damn right! Hope they keep giving them extremely promising cards, or extremely fun cards (or both!).
---
Happy CakeDay!

---
Thats super handy. I've been doing it manually for some time.
---
I‚Äôm not Chinese but I think he should get 20 new cards each expansion.
---
Honestly its really bad, compared to other control decks and compared to other control warrior decks. It doesnt really have any early game so you just get punished against aggro because all your dragons are above 5 mana and dragon's roar typically gives you big expensive minions. In comparison to dead man's hand and odd warrior, your armour generation is really bad since its just either hero power or emberscale drake. Against other control like control priest, they can easily out-value using hero card or archbishop benedictus so you cant win fatigue. OTK decks are just instant concede. I made a variation of this deck using alextrassa instead of ysera so that I can reduce opponent health to 15 and then hit face during end game.
---
I wonder if it would be easier to jam Maly first. Then play Vargoth and Mind Blast next turn.

The soul infusions are for hireek, can easily turn 2 and 3 tap into a turn 4 arena fanatic. Trick is to not worry about greeding arena fanatics for hireek neither the spirit of the bat. Get value from those on regular minios and if they align with Hir'eek, all the better.
---
Can easily fit in some hellfires and a zilliax in there. Swamp oozes, siphon soul, mortal coil and fiendish circle are all valid choices to fit the hellfires and zilliax in. 
---
Its basically healing, armoring, taunts and control mixed in with hand buffs.
---
Dropping a board of 5/5 to 11/11 Hir'eeks is always satisfying for some reason.
---
The pleasure is mine.

Prince Liam, aka Liam Greymane. He was killed by Sylvanas, hence Genn's lasting grudge against her. That's why he's a ghostly prince. 
---
The fact that they were long time CMs doesn't really mean much tho. They wanted to cut on the PR teams and hire more devs which they did and a large percentage of the firings were also the Destiny and HotS e-sports teams. Yeah, what happened to Ythisens was crappy and most likely a mistake but it's also one case and it doesn't mean all of the lay offs were long time employees.

damn, now I think less of this card and the new 8 mana mage spell

Underrated comment.clearly have to try weasel shuffle rogue in wild now
---
3 mana 4/4 and deck thinning? Sounds great!
---
It's a little slow compared to Witchwood Piper, but the fact that Immortal Prelate gets to keep the buff as well is pretty good.
---
I don't really know XD
---
To be fair aggro paladin is the kind of deck that would either kill the rogue on the Nomi turn, or just die to it.
---
yup it probably won't, so does this minion. Because running them alone feels bad and the possibility of comboing them with khadgar isn't enough to overcome how bad they're alone

Truly an Eternal Hunt.

Some of [these Sticky Thread and Guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/resources#wiki_sticky_threads) may help, and while some of them are outdated, [this new player guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6tbyp5/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_mammoth/) should still contain helpful information.
---
Some general tips for new players:
---
1) Play the Frozen Throne Prologue, and DON'T concede.
---
2) Prioritize opening classic packs first, they are still pretty essential.
---
3) There is a guaranteed legendary card within the first 10 packs of EACH expansion, so if you are planning to buy them, buy and open them pack by pack (up to 10) until you get the first legendary of each set.

You don't want to reveal a card that would be tag as a losing one so chances it happens are quite small

---
Its better than the pirate spongebob takeover last time.
---
Succubus and Silverware Golem?
---
Honestly not sure, but probably new, since sites like this default you to new unless you opt out and I never opted out. 
---
Depends if you want the stats on the drawn minion to use later or on the board now.
---
That only does 18 damage and doesnt go through taunt
---
wow, time to play shuffle rogue again, this is gonna be fun!
---
I can see it being useful on Tesspionage, but it‚Äôs not my favorite Legendary they released so far
---
[](#Brode) Elise is not gon' wait her scouts are amin' for haters [](#Brode)

But when everyone is playing hunter for example then the wait time to find a non-hunter opponent would be significantly longer. I guess that would be bad but I agree that tess rogue mirror are frustrating games

That may have been me

This is why each years sets should have at least 1 theme running through all of them. At the moment they're just grouped together arbitrarily by release year.
---
All it would take is 1-2 new keywords/ mechanics for the year, and suddenly there's something tying them all together.

Okay but umbra and weasels?

Plus lifesteal. Twin spell one onto the prelate, one onto the undataker.

I think the card is good if you think of it as a 2 mana ‚ÄúPut two secrets into play‚Äù; almost like a mini mysterious challenger (just minus the body and you don‚Äôt have to commit so many secrets into your main board).

it‚Äôs a similar design space to the various ‚Äú2 mana, draw 2‚Äù cards we have been seeing; but I think it is better than most of those

Well, there was also Evasion... which is also rotating.
---
Thnx for the info.. not familiar with WoW
---
agree with you. rogue isnt good at doing a lot of things. tempo decks fit the best. miracle rogue worked for the longest time, because it was kind of tempo combined with value. 
---
the only meta "nontempo"decks rogue had were inherently broken. kingsbane worked because it fixed the problem, that rogue had no healing...quest rogue kind of too. but anything else is really hard to pull off without dieing turn 5.
---
rogue has some of the coolest cards imo, but the cool decks rarely have a winrate close to 40% &lt;.&lt;

So, Im pretty sure everybody who tries to outclever someone else in this thread by pretending to be stupid as hell is going to make a fool of himselph instead of someone else.
---
You‚Äôd obviously just run both though right? The whole point is being able to draw the thing repeatedly. 
---
If they nerf prep, Rogue will completely die off.
---
Me either but here I am looking at your post :(
---
oh.. did not know that.. thnx
---
Shit so why they nerf Winaxe 
---
&gt; They're supposed to get figured out as the meta does. Just like any other card.
---
Which is why you see more and more decks teching in a non-standard secret. You would have a point here if tournaments didn't involve open deck lists, removing even the skill of anticipating your opponent's deck.
---
Forcing your opponent to play around a random secret is nearly identical to playing an off-meta secret. I suggest you find another hill to die on.
---
15600 (have one regular moth, +2 stag, the rest is golden)
---
Yeah? I got ancient one from a basic pack
---
You can still use [[Pilfer]], it's worse but it works
---
and with Rush you can trade straight away. I made Legend (Standard) with Rush Warrior in June 2018, before all the nice Rush stuff from RR. People really underestimate Rush.
---
coming to this subreddit after a year: isnt the new cards kinda repetitive this expansion?

The skill is playing around them in such a way that you're wrong in the least bad way.

Pilfer

thnx for the info

Wait 10 days btw new cards soon
---
Good thing I‚Äôve already opened them all. 
---
It's getting hilarious how misleading those thumbnails on the reveal schedule were. For this one it was zoomed in on the treasure, leading lots of people to think it was some kind of weapon (the treasure seems vaguely like some halberd)
---
Highest and lowest winrate?
---
Can't wait for everyone to play Rogue first week of the expansion and queue into nothing but other Rogues
---
It's worth noting that as amazing as this card is it's pretty hard to get another classes card in your hand on turn 2.
---
Still great tho! 
---
It discovers a card instead of drawing if you don't have 3 beasts.
---
He's joking that this one outdoes his other ones (which were already amazing)
---
this guy keeps summoning an even larger and larger trogg
---
Aye, that's what makes it faster. 
---
If you go second, the Trogg can pop a 1/1 and then you pop the Trogg, then the golem forces the other two to man up and trade with it.
---
If you go first, you rush down the trogg and have a 1/1 left after trading.
---
All with no overload. This is disgusting, and we're going to HATE THIS CARD at some point.
---
I like how you felt bad after 35 minutes and decided to clarify it.
---
There the new classic card
---
Maybe not for a control deck that finds a way to abuse them. No idea how but I'm sure someone will find a way.

Axe Beak. Has overkill +5 attack but starts as 1/1. Perfect storm for early game.

What is the win condition for heal Druid?

I've already got 3 of 4.

I still don't understand why they removed charge from Patches. At least let him have rush.

The fact that an april fools joke is what they should actually add into the game is sad.

Baby boar incoming!

I recommend you to wait until the next expansion, which comes on April 9.

And for more help i recommend you to search here in the sub, this topic was already discussed a lot of times here ;)
---
Nah, Thief Rogue has been sitting at Trash Tier since Burgle was introduced in August 2015. I think I nearly 4 year wait is reasonable for the archetype to finally become competitive.
---
Yep
---
But the HOF cards, you get their dust for free without having to disenchant them again
---
At least it looks pretty well-elaborated.
---
i love you
---
8:1 it is OTK.  And those are the actual odds per VS

I probably made a massive mistake I‚Äôm not including this in my original post, but I DONT think blizzard should remove mirror matchups. I was just trying to pose a hypothetical question

RNGfest is the only acceptable archtype

Face damage really wasn't the problem with Patches

And? I got Mysterious Challenger from a 6-pack

kids tv show and a childrens card game. seems to fit
---
Why wouldn't they? It's arguably the funnest deck you can play in Hearthstone these days and it loses tons of stuff with the rotation.
---
Right when Hallucination rotates of course. 
---
This is an arena nightmare
---
I zoomed in to double check but I don't see any nose whiskers? 
---
The vast majority of Druid decks are some kind of OTK decks, so yes.  Meta knowledge is a skill!
---
Wow, how entitled and stupid do you have to be to think a multi-billion dollar company does its hirings and firings specifically to piss off its community.  Thank you for proving my point so succinctly.
---
You never had the pleasure of playing vanilla/BC WoW.
---
Thank you so much for not going overboard this year. 
---
Dude not cool! I crafted all of these golden, because they were rotating to HOF, or so I thought. I was 100 dust away from crafting full renolock, and now I can‚Äôt!
---
JOKES ON YOU - I ALREADY HAVE 3 OF THEM!
---
...Have you ever seen the shrieking hivemind be reasonable like that? No. It'll be called a cheaper totem golem with Rush, we'll draw mustaches and genitalia on its face, and we'll scream for a nerf for years. All it needs is a tunnel trogg :P
---
Not upset here.  I finally made it to rank 10 this season.  All on the back of deathrattle hunter.
---
useless in a rogue v rogue tho, but looking at rogue archetypes. This maybe the only viable one.

If swashbucler was still a thing... 3/4 rush on turn 2 is disgusting, might be worth running pilfer just for this and the deal 4 card

Seriously, is there any use for milstorm???? Pulled him the other day

Oh, sure thus the "I'm not sure if t would have been enough".  But you always play to your winning line, no matter how unlikely it is.
---
In a vacuum, yes, but it does synergize with [[Shervallah, the Tiger]] and [[Immortal Prelate]] better. Also if there's a world where Paladin needs to have very specific minions in their deck/hand and [[Witchwood Piper]] interferes with that somehow for some sort of powerful strategy, it may be a thing.

Bitterblade#1451 NA, 80g quest. I'll show, you go first please.
---
I have come back I left around kobald and started around gnomes. I thought about the same thing just main one class. I picked priest because the light will burn you! I literally disenchanted all other class cards and got around 8k dust and made some key legendaries.  I crafted 1 HOF legendary because I see it as a 400 dust investment. I made epics and legendaries that can fit in other decks. I got to rank 25 to 8 over this weekend, while at work. Before I never got past 11. Aggro hunter is cheap and seen through the latter and I've never won against a kings bane rogue, jade druid is op late game but falls to aggro. You can climb high even with no legendary cards.  I've seen so many non golden players using hunter and druid
---
Once I Psychic Screamed my own minion into someone else's empty Mecha'Thun deck to force them to have to play it before doing the combo. The extra turn gave me the chance to kill them. Definitely the most clutch play I've ever made.

I'm not overrating anything. I'm simply stating the fact that the DK card is not 'at the bottom of the deck'. That's a nonsensical and false statement. Because if it was a true statement, then Tracking would be able to find it, which it never will find the card that Gnomeferatu burns. This goes for whatever card she burns. 
---
Atta girl! You support your man!
---
Card could absolutely win you the game in arena....... if the conditions are right
---
10 mana cards are tricky but if the board is relatively clear it's not a bad play, also assuming you didn't draw it early and have to carry the weight all game
---
I agree with your point, but Swashburglar saw tons of play in, like, every rogue deck, and hallucination saw some play in miracle rouge
---
I‚Äôd rather play that video game than HS
---
What really upsets me is I didn‚Äôt like any rogue other than thief, was short on dust so scrapped my entire rogue loadout, only to have them print out some seriously great rogue cards.

&gt;Yes, we do? It's Archmage Vargoth. It's a neutral 4 mana 2/6 that at the end of your turn, Vargoth casts a spell you‚Äôve cast previously in the turn with targets chosen randomly. IGN announced it yesterday.

Maybe things like crystallizer will actually see play now. Druid needs things like that or we'll have the heal paladin problem all over again, of not being able to heal at full.

Draw 2 cards for 0 with Auctioneer. I'd legit play this card. Plus you get to throw bad memes at your opponent. 
---
Yeah they make all the cards so they decide the archetypes and synergies 
---
With this, here's my crack at Heal Druid. It's kind of a tempo/midrange style.  
---
2x Pounce
---
2x Crystal Power
---
2x Crystallizer
---
2x Lightwarden
---
2x Dreamway Guardians
---
1x Keeper Stalladris
---
2x Power of the Wild
---
2x Wrath
---
1x Landscaping
---
2x Lifeweaver
---
2x Ornery Tortoise
---
1x Flobbidinous Floop
---
2x Lifedrinker
---
2x Travelling Healer
---
2x Crystal Stag
---
1x Zilliax
---
1x Ancient of Lore
---
1x Lucentbark
---
Multiple ways to ensure you take damage to have a heal target (Pounce, Crystallizer, &amp; Ornery Tortoise).  Somewhat low on draw but value generators in Stalladris and Lifeweaver to hopefully keep up in card advantage.  Flobbidinous Floop has a bunch of decent targets. And overall it seems like it curves pretty well that you could snowball some games.  Similar to how Zoo gets ahead on board and then uses its board control to snowball, this deck could do the same thing and either heal your face or heal up a minion after a value trade. Not saying it'll be a high tier deck, but might be something there.  
---
9/10 shitpost; Millhouse doesn't rotate out of Standard, making him slightly more likely to be playable in a format than the other three.
---
Yep. Works like sherazin
---
ah! i always like the step 3
---
I was thinling more along the lines of "Who know what secr- THE STARS ALIG- THE STARS ALIGN Ill put it on your tab THE STARS ALIGN (Loatheb sound)
---

---
This is no place for jojotards.
---
Good to know
---
Many schemes are considered underwhelming, so I expect Vargoth casts upgraded ones.
---
I actually run that exact quest druid deck... #feelsbadman
---
have fun :D
---
Gameplay wise, it's way more balanced than mass armor gain
---
This fucks with rogue curve. You gotta use a 1 mana spell thats meh and you get a 3/4 with rush. I‚Äôd rather argent, heropower, hench.
---
A shame Nozdormu didn't make the list.  Now there is a timeless (heh) classic!
---
I wish for this
---
&gt;Hope they do the change for the older cards though
---
They said they won't. 
---
Nothing more fun than brainless infinite value bullshit right? /s

Craft a golden one and a regular one.  Two is better than one.
---
SMORC them down!
---
This minion can summon itself back after a board clear. Heal druid wincondition is to outvalue the opponent, just like old common control decks. People were complaining that we lost the board aspect of the game, and now that they push it people complain about decks not having a way to OTK the opponent?
---
Moderately ironic 
---
Is this a mage?
---
Wild Duplicate Mage. Umbra + Cubing a Piloted Shredder fills your whole board right up. There's lots of fun combos though. It's just a gimmicky value deck, duping stuff like Pyros, Rotten Applebaum (nzoth value)...had a game the other day where between myself and my opponent, we played like 15 cubes (we kept getting them off Duplicate so we just kept Cubing our Cubes and getting more Cubes...dawg). I remember at one point there were like 6 or 7 on the board at one time.
---
This card had one of my favorite on-play lines in the game.  
---
   
---
"Say hello to my little friend!"  
---
  
---
"HELLLLOOOOOOOOO"
---
All three combo pieces cost 8, how is this consistent with Psychmelon. 
---
no its a neutral doggo boi
---
You legend. I looked at the picture for like 5 minutes and gave up trying to figure out where her legs are.

---
Elder Longneck feels so bad when you can't get Health
---
Well, I guess it depends on what you mean by "control rogue". Slower rogue decks have always existed, but they've always felt vastly different from "control decks" in any other class because of the very salient lack of heals/taunts/clears. They've always felt like variants of mill rogue. Now, you could argue that mill rogue is a straight up control deck, though I'd say it feels sufficiently different from playing stuff like Control Warrior, Control Priest, Control Warlock etc. for the label to not really apply.
---
Sweet shit! There‚Äôs so much going on for Wild Thief Rogue that it might just eclipse Odd Rogue in terms of sheer tempo thanks to our lord and savior Patches and Swashburglar. We have a baby 0 mana Assassinate, this card to keep up board presence, and silly value shenanigans everywhere in reveal season.
---
What card is this art for? 
---
Back then even if you made it to the late game, burn would still finish you off. 
---
That was the real kicker. D:
---
I'm now curious what would happen if they removed all beasts with more than one keyword from the pool.
---
Jesus, it is as good as this [](#Brode)
---
I plan on crafting a rush / dragon warrior post rotation. I think it'll be pretty good 
---
It doesnt have to be on turn 2. It is still a 2/3 for 2. And on an empty board or against a 2/2, a 2/3 is much better than dagger. 
---
I WAS enjoying even pirate rogue, but wouldn't advise crafting an even deck right now LOL
---
I think Pirate rogue could still be fun. The high point of Sharkfin fan on board -&gt; weapon hit -&gt; hooktusk -&gt; Prep -&gt; Cannon barrage is just SO good. I'm not saying this is a climbing deck, but shit is it fun nailing the lethal.
---
Bonus points if you can hold a wide pirate board for a turn then drop cannon barrage -&gt; prep -&gt; cannon barrage
---
OR
---
have 2 sharkfin fans out, Barrage -&gt; prep -&gt; barrage
---
again, bit of a one trick pony deck but it is fun and relatively cheap.
---
...Fair point, I'd be up for that.
---
Breaking news silence stock has shot up
---
But for real if theirs card is anywhere near how powerful I think it is a set of silence cards will be a must play
---
You guys are literally responding to a HS dev.
---
Tesspionage is my favorite deck too, actually. And I like the direction they're going with burgle rogue, i.e. printing more solid burgle minions and some single-target removals, etc. My only point was that I would hate for Rogue's class identity to be diluted by giving them typical clears/heals/taunts that almost every other class has.
---
Have you tried it since the Rank 50 change?  Because it's a far better solution than giving you a few tier 4 decks and a massive grind like MtGA does.
---
Imagine only having this, Preparation, and Academic Espionage in hand.
---
Do triclass cards count?
---
Infallible logic considering this is the only card that‚Äôs gotten changed like this which I know about, while there‚Äôs still plenty of other good looking girls on cards too but meh 
---
Baleful banker also foreshadowed in this pic. And the Jaina nerf
---
 Danimal#1510, NA, 80G Challenge Friend Quest, Will show then you go first. 
---
Druids have acces to gloop sprayer, floop (that after dying and going dormant, will ressumon as full 4/8 stats), and neutral cloning like faceless manipulator or Undatakah (since its a deathrattle).
---
_Laughs in double saps._
---
Its a plus sign lmao
---
Gloop sprayer only summons 1 copy of each adjacent minion similar to fungalmancer. You would need to play a gloop sprayer next to this to get 2 then a gloop sprayer in between the 2 to get 4 or between this and another minion to get 3. Which if you still hadn‚Äôt won and then all 3 died and you drew [[Crystal Power]] then you could summon 12/24 worth of stats... 
---
This seems kinda cool but I imagine Druid will have better things to try to pull off with so many high mana turns... they pretty much busted up all Druid ramp and 8 mana is a lot of mana to get to. Does not compute.
---
Yeah who wants to make decisions, just let me go face every turn like a bot.

It's only insane if your opponent has a one drop you're gobbling for free. Otherwise it's a two mana 3/4, which isn't game winning by any stretch of the word. It's not enough to justify running Pilfer. 
---
The majority of people on here are saying it's bad, so naturally we'll see it be played in tier s decks until blizzard nerfs it.
---

---
Except they're almost identical languages. It's more in line of reading a sentence in English, and saying "I took 1 year of Dutch" except Spanish and Portuguese are 10x more similar than English and Dutch.

---
On turn 7, or later if your hand isn't perfect. 
---
it was supposed to be something else. probably to do with bombs, given the artwork and the actual boom card.
---
maybe something like shuffle a bomb that deals 1 damage into your opponent's deck (improves each turn). then they had some balance issues with it where you could get into a fatigue situation and then hit them with like 2 clockwork goblins, swing with your weapon, and then shuffle the big bomb for however long you'd managed to hold it and suddenly burst for 20+ from hand which they felt was unfun.
---
then, last minute they decided to take the card out and made it armor instead.
---
(just a theory)
---
That's true, but it's still pretty silly to assume that because they're both Romance languages that you'll automatically be able to understand it. Funnily enough, I never see this being done with French, Italian or Romanian.
---
Nah. Condition is too hard to meet, there's not that many good thief cards. 
---
Why not non generics which don't lead to cancerous 2 years? 
---
Odd-paladin for sure tier 1.  But I never understand the love for KG-rogue.. Sure it can be really fast if you draw well, but it doesn't seem consistent and can run out of steam quite fast. I would put it tier 2 to be honest..
---
Six armor.
---
Has there ever been an even/odd Priest deck that wasn't absolute garbage tier? I don't think I've ever played against one. And I've played even/odd Druid at least once.
---
"Source" doesn't exist on default reddit. It's a RES feature.
---
I know, I'm brazilian. But I think I've seen "M√£e do enxame/ da ninhada / da prole" before.
---
Yeah good point about Rexxar and board control. I guess the deck is essentially losing three of it's most important cards. I'll be glad if this deck and the hunter meta takes a break. 
---
Mod abuse.
---
I like the design and this seems like a strong consideration for a control deck. It would ordinarily be a dead card against aggro until turn 6, except it's not totally dead because if you draw it you get a 0 cost flash heal sort of. Before turn 6 you have tools like Shriek and Hellfire which are strong against aggro. Hopefully you're in a good enough spot where this getting silenced on turn 6 doesn't spell out death.
---
Thought jokes were supposed to be funny.
---
This "DAE think Portuguese is Spanish??" crap has gotten old ages ago.
---
Roger that, operation commencing  
---
or you could upvote me instead
---
To be fair, Portuguese and Spanish are closely related and very similar. As far as I know, Japanese and Mandarin are not.
---
My native language is Spanish and I only failed to understand what "comprar" meant in this card.
---
sleep well pupper
---
Much prefer to armor druid. Healing needs constant upkeep and never lets you out of OTK range, whereas armor is fucking nonsense.
---
Have both in hand and use aug elek
---
they could start it at, say, 5 armor and it'd still be kind of weak.
---
maybe MAYBE in a specialist format, where you know your opponent is also a control warrior, you'd swap your shield blocks for this so you DON'T draw.
---
but it's just so weak it might not even work there.
---
It's worse after it's played but better before. Unlike Rotten Applebaum you don't *need* to play this to get value out of it.

 exstinctio#2818 trading 80 gold you go first for EU
---
Mage. Rhastakan stuff is almost useless with Odd rotating, Control is dead without Jaina/Dragon breath and no good 1 drop for tempo/aggro.
---
It all rely on the "miracle" archetype with cheap spell but those kind of deck only work with stuff like coin, fake coin or prep and 0 cost spell which mage doesn't have.
---
Considering I'm a native portuguese speaker and conversational in Spanish, I think I'd know how similar the languages are. While they have a lot of cognates (just like every Romance language), some of the most common words in the two languages are entirely different and there's a lot of false friends. 
---
So no, while that example was extreme it's more like reading a sentence in French and saying "I took 1 year of Spanish", which no one would do. Yet you hear time and time again people assuming Portuguese is just funny Spanish.
---
Skulking Geist rotates out too, so Yes Paladin is only going to exist in Wild anyways.
---
Yes. It says "cast a spell you have casted this turn". So it casts the spell. Not an exact copy, but the original spell. Same as when you resummon a previously killed 1/1 minion, it will not keep enchantments (unless stated otherwise) and will therefore be the original copy, with full stats. Vargoth takes the spell from your "graveyard" and plays it the same way, seeing only the base, original version of it.
---
uh, alex's champion was a huge reason to play that deck, and it was really good for like a whole year.
---

---
Yea it‚Äôs just frustrating going 0 wins. I feel like they def changed something for this to happen 
---
This combos are getting more and more ratchet by the day and I love it.

Still a solid 2 man stat line without the effect.  Absolutely fantastic vs 8 of the classes, good against 1.  
---
https://puu.sh/D8zev/ccdac82a4c.png
---
A 3/4 rush is overstated for even 3 cost though, playing it on turn 3 would be a good play and 4 wouldn‚Äôt be that bad 
---
&gt; is never used in this context
---
That's a lie. All my life I've heard "tirar" a card from your deck, never "comprar", and I've been playing card games for nearly two decades now. I'm from Portugal, btw.
---
It's a random friendly character, chances are it hits one of your minions, not your face. 
---
In Brazil, maybe.
---
Witchwood apple worked normally when I tested it 
---
Usually it's something like "vai buscar X cartas" or "tirar", meaning go get or take, respectively.
---
Could be different in Brazilian Portuguese, but I've never heard a Brazilian use the verb with the meaning of "draw" either.

Lol twitch Yogg Saron matches really as a viewer were fun to watch. I agree though, competition wise skill should be what matters, but you know for a card game, there's only so many ways to play a card game with no rng. And viable t1 decks with no variance whatsoever just get stale. That's why i like discover it's a good effect, it offers flexibility, but also game sense to also play around your opponent and pick up old cards. Esp when you can discover other class cards like getting a Antonidas in Priest or a Velen in Mage can make up for some crazy games. Unless you're the player having to face against a thoughtstolen frostlich Jaina with the heals and sustain and psychic screams of priest. Screw that S$!@
---
Well this is new- is it good probably not, has some synagy's with Plot twist but the fact that this triggers on draw is its main problem if you draw this early you might heal for 0 leaving you with a Vanilla 4/6 for 6 mana you only have to look at [[Chillwind Yeti]] to know paying 6 Mana for this stateline is bad. Granted it heals 4 health which could save you but in the late game that could be irrelevent. In the late game you need a card to swing the and sadly this is not it. 1.5 stars

the cards need to stay on screen just a second longer though
---
Ragnara
---
If you don't want to craft any older cards then Dragon Control Priest is pretty similar to its Standard equivalent.  However Cubelock, Mecha'thun Warlock, Secret/Tempo Mage, Even Shaman, Mech Hunter, Togwaggle Druid, and Odd Paladin are either easy to convert or cheap for their power level to begin with.  Odd Mage is also lower tier in Wild though relatively new so might or might not be worth converting.
---
This not really how it works in MtG. There are 5 *classes*  but you can play up to 5 classes on the same deck.
---
The notable downside being that the more colors you play, the less *stable* your deck is (due to mana generation problem). It's really oversimplified, but you get the idea.
---

I‚Äôve decided that i‚Äôm going to play Heal Druid. 
---
Could be. Considering no one has been able to use the card yet, maybe it'll turn out to be very viable for control warrior. Maybe it originally did something else, like summoning boom bots or a huge bomb, and then when they play tested that realized it was way overpowered and just did a quick change to armor instead of trying to rework it. Honestly, I doubt you could make a card that says something like "shuffle a bomb that deals 1 damage into your opponent's deck (upgrades each turn)" balanced even at 10 mana. Imagine a control warrior that on like turn 20 drops a bomb into your deck that could deal &gt;15 damage. There's just too much highroll potential in a control warrior deck for that.

I like these adventures so I will buy it with gold. F2p btw

Ahh, i see the old [[Tuskarr Totemic]] into a 3/4 totem golem is working again..

3/3/2 | Battlecry: Summon a random basic Totem.  
---
No it‚Äôs not, you choose the character...
---
Haven't previous final card reveal streams been 1 or 2 days before the release of the expansion? I guess I'm wrong. Expansion release is next week 9th April?
---
God forbid you give Rogue versatile cards that we can build original decks with. Nah, just give us cards that come out of a cereal box for decks that build themselves. Rogue lore. Thanks
---
Magic and Yu-gi-oh have done fine, actually. I'm not against all RNG. I just don't think an archetype fully revolving around it is what we want to queue into game after game.
---
You'd be surprised by how often I manage to Prep Espionage on T1.
---
[It almost was](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/92tmtf/tonights_card_reveal_what_we_expect_vs_what_we/e38q0w8/)
---
Why is this not allowed but other post like "mods asleep,upvote etc" allowed?
---
Aren't they the same thing joking about April Fools?
---
Adapt would have been neater if you had gotten 4 options, or removed/comboed ones like taunt + 2 health or rush/lifesteal on there. 
---
It‚Äôs the very philosophy and concept of the card I hate. In a game with no counters or graveyard and that promotes combo as an archetype, being able to go into your opponent‚Äôs hand &amp; deck is just... a dick move. 
---
Laboratory Jaceiac
---
I mean Technically? It‚Äôs Draw first, then check how many cards are left in the library so if Jace leaves the board and you can‚Äôt draw all 7, then it‚Äôs a loss. The way it is worded also means you can use it without Jace leaving the board and win without having to draw an extra card though.
---
XD!!!!1!!
---
Lucky me, I've already got Ozruk and Darfallen Aviana.
---
I'm sure I'll find Millhouse soon, too bad Moorabi it's rotating.
---
Excise me sir, but don't you dare bully my boy Ozruk!
---
You could also argue that Jace assaults your opponent mentally, making them harder to focus. You can find always find flavor explanation if you try, as long as ability is within color pie (and fucking with sorceries/instants in particular is in blue's, opposed to fucking with your opponent doing anything in white)
---
This card better counts torward to treant synergy.
---
Vanish, Vargoth
---
Same! LOL they fucking with us 
---
it seems we ll get Vargoth ! another legendary if u bought a preorder
---
No one ever expects the second jaraxxus 
---
10 mana 0/0. This sucks
---
Imagine getting so triggered over an opinion on a video game that you started insulting people.
---
Also, the card will be out for 2 years bud.  Even if the card isn‚Äôt good when it first comes out and there‚Äôs very few cards in standard, it doesn‚Äôt mean that it won‚Äôt be good as more synergies come out.
---
Baron Rovendare 2: Electric Boogaloo 
---
Tylerchott. I've seen a picture of him doing it somewhere. 
---
Because English is the language spoken by the most people in the world and the highest number of people will understand it. 
---
I'm not advocating for the removal of releases in other languages (the game is localized into many languages, after all), but make the release contain the English version of the card as well.
---
0/10 would never see play 2 overload is a way too big drawback
---
You are mistaken, this costs 0. However I would still say it sucks because if you are running 10s, especially for the clubs, there is already some competition with cards like [Unprepared](https://dtdb.co/en/card/01134), [Extortion](https://dtdb.co/en/card/01132) or even [Recruitment Drive](https://dtdb.co/en/card/01133) are all really good. Its hard to say that doc holidays catch-phrase can beat these cards. 
---
4 health plus 6 health of taunt compares pretty favorably, except against the pure face generation of leper gnomes. Keep in mind this one heals 4 for free, not 5 mana. The body is just adding value to something free. If this didn't have taunt I'd throw it in the trash but I do think there might be something here. 
---
We have trained him wrong.  As a joke! 
---
That was directly from a quote from the game designer... forget which website did the interview with him.
---
New card! /s
---
Pyros
---
I haven't had it happen recently, but it's absolutely one of Hearthstone's biggest issues on mobile. It's insane that after all this time it doesn't tell you when you disconnect sometimes, and you have to guess and relaunch the game just to be safe.
---
ABANDON SHIP
---
Did all those countries that don‚Äôt speak English make Hearthstone? The answer is no, an English speaking country produced the game. That‚Äôs not to say that other folks shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play, or have cards in their native language. It is a global game, but I‚Äôd guess that English speakers make up most of its player base. 
---
Posting a new card for a predominantly English speaking game, on a predominantly English speaking website, in Portuguese seems a little like a) laziness, b) trolling, c) inability to post in English, which is definitely forgivable or d) something I haven‚Äôt thought of but am open to explanations. 
---
Because Blizzard gives Priest restore/heal synergy cards?
---
Those only go to Paladin and Druid.
---
It's okay but I'm going to need a guy who plays 5 secret secrets to even adjust my old MC deck.
---
Getting a rotating card in your chest feelskindabadman
---
Got Corpsetaker....kind of a bummer.
---
Its still 1 o clock in America
---
sorry :/
---
"Bu...but new shuffle card!"
---
No reddit it's just bad.
---
I think this card might actually make [[Pilfer]] tolerable to run
---
It is today.
---
Scheme can be prepped out for 4 coldlights on turn 3, the first you can actually drop coldlight. Next turn you can start powering them out. If you think that's the same as doing coldlight recruiter on 5 or relying on shadowstep to do it on 3 and 4, I'd say you're in for a rude awakening. 
---
THE ZANCIENT ONE
---
Damn. I thought the meta was finally looking spicy and then I remembered the date 
---
:D
---
I didn't enjoy the video.  It felt cheesy and lame to me.  But I also don't like anime or whatever, so that makes sense.  
---
I just want to know what the new cards are, I have no interest in 3.5 minutes of play fighting or whatever you'd call that.
---
I want to make some arts after than this
---
I genuinely hope this guy is my free legendary, he looks like a blast to play.
---
Give him lifesteal with the paladin spell and +1 attack,if you can pull that off,you have a minion that can go dormant only because of spells
---
Does it happens too often?

     1/-/- | Add a random card to your hand (from your opponent's Rogue).
---
That's the cutest fucking thing i've ever seen in my entire life
---
There's not a day that goes by without this being reposted multiple times
---
...scramble? The game isnt out for a week
---
Kibler **is** great.
---
Definitely a better craft than shaman quest.
---
it‚Äôs whenever a card like Abomination kills both you and your opponent at the same time
---
I just want to know what happened... 
---
Yeah when maly quest druid was a thing and then they changed the way the quest worked with faceless I think and that killed the deck.
---
What do you mean, 'whoops'?! It's a whole one extra damage! It's like playing Odd Mage without the Odd Mage!!
---
Sure, having one specific 3 card combo on turn 4, one card of which had to be in your hand at mulligan is gonna suddenly make the deck's winrate skyrocket.
---
Like I said, I detest millrogue, but I think you might be panicking a bit too much here. The scheme will be played in those decks, but it will not drastically alter the winrate.
---
It feels odd that some cards that reference an opponent would require tooling to target opponent, plus the lack of instant-speed interaction really makes combo seem really good at first glance. Politics is also important - I love publicly announcing I have a card in my hand (whether I have it or not) or saying rhat anyone who touched me is getting aetherflux resorvoir‚Äôd for 50
---
Is secret paladin tier 1 in wild? Otherwise no idea what you‚Äôre on about mate 
---
Double battlecry shrine + elementals, thank me later
---
no, now OTK just have to account for disruption, which just means there an interactive part of cardstone now.
---
The game was a tie.
---
Still up for me, I just got here
---
And then they gave Shaman Spirit Claws...
---
Also wild
---
Not interactive with some builds. You can say the same thing about hyper aggro versus combo. Should we also kill hyper aggro? Or what about control versus aggro? Should we kill off control because it doesn't let aggro build a board and smash face? Where does that mentality stop?
---
When your enemy plays it, it's always Fireball and Polymorph and Pyroblast and actually good shit that really screws you over.
---
When you play it, it's Glacial Mysteries. Every time.
---
I had duel in mind tbh
---
Oh sorry i don't sort by new i wouldn't know
---
Wild control warrior mirror. 30+ minutes wasted, the guy was about to lose but played cold light Oracle with bran and we both died to fatigue 
---
That font size on the last line tho
---
I know that walk very well, we should have seen each other many times by now since we both take it often. Good luck tomorrow, let me know.
---
My God that‚Äôs sick. Love the art, idea, and name. Can‚Äôt wait for this set!
---
Cool-  a card that literally gets better as expansions are added!
---
If this is real, I love it. Seems really fun and balanced, though the cost is a bit prohibitive
---
mechathun reprint
---
Finally some good fucking food
---
wait is hearthstone available in danish?
---
You must be real fun at parties huh
---
Ah, the famous Mechathun Gonk Warrior. How could I forget?
---
Should be a 4/3/5 since you're not hitting a 0 cost minion.
---
My favorite deck to play. Wincon vs aggro is anduin, vs control is turn limit.
---
Ah yes, the infamous Tess 'Secretly a Hobbit with Infinite Rocks' Greymane combo.
---
that 'all spells have Echo' boss was the most stupidly long OTK I've seen in some time
---
It's 2019 and people are still misquoting this meme.
---
Do you have any suggestions for events to help everyone feel included? I was thinking of a raffle giveaway and round robin tournament using the new cards
---
It was a big rock.
---
They are going to reveal a few cards (20-30 in the last few prerelease streams) and dump the rest of the expansion's cards on Facebook after the end of the stream.
---
No, it's a hero card with two Hero Powers and a passive, you gain 4 armor
---
It‚Äôs kinda funny ngl
---
Warlockk87#1372 NA trading 80 g quest.
---
This reminds me of Eater of Secrets. It was supposed to kill secret decks, but quite logically it doesn‚Äôt do that since when no one plays secrets anymore no one will play the Tech card anymore as well, and then you‚Äôre good to play secrets again.
---
So I expect combo decks to survive this for sure.
---
OP: "cheating out minions in wild is too consistent, my opponent has almost 50 mana worth of minions on turn 4, this isn't very fun."
---
You, for some reason: "BuT yOU hAvE a NinE dROp"
---
Yep. Looking back, I also think disenchanting for a ‚Äúfirst deck‚Äù can sometimes be a mistake, because most new players don‚Äôt have the skills yet to take advantage of the deck anyway. They are better off subbing in cards they do have and learning both why those cards are not as good and the basics of the game.
---
Me: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Upgonk?‚Äù

The mid day end is bullshit it‚Äôs the entire day
---
Even better, you can Power Word Replicate him, to make 4 Vargoths, and if they are not removed next turn, 2 Mind blasts equals 30 damage.
---
10 from the casted mind blasts and 20 from 1 mind blast per Vargoth.
---
And because you are Multiplying Vargoths you have increased chances of a Vargoth showing up on Mass Ressurection, meaning you have a increased chance of 2 Mass Ressurections on the same turn. 
---
something like this: https://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder/priest#249:1;415:2;431:2;547:2;89870:2;90253:2;90548:2;90598:2;90615:1; 
---
now i am wondering what to do with the 14 remaining slots, maybe big wall package? 
---
fair cards rarely make it to the top
---
besides, the real game has plenty of cards that are insanely strong or overvalued 
---
Man this community is so damn bored waiting for the expansion...ffs
---
And what word would you pick for something that's annoying and awkward? Seems like a good choice to me
---
The card does read until the start of your next turn, you took 2 before his next. 
---
Golden Onyxia
---
&gt; TIL I can read Danish.
---
With danish beeing somewhere between english and german I guess a lot of people can understand a few words danish.
---
Hello ‚Äúhearthstonecirclejerk‚Äù
---
It starts at the exact time the expansion launches.
---
DIVISION! By zero...all accounts CLEAR THE LOBBY while we get the marketplace back under control...
---
But this is just infinite heal, not stall. You could, with like 5 card combo, add more cards to your deck infinitily, but this is nothing like dead mans hand.
---
DMN was an easy combo to gain infinite armour and never take fatique which was easy to transform into extra resources on the long run.
---
This is at best, hard combo to suffle (infinitely) more cards into your deck, that if not assembled, doesn't add any extra cards into your deck.
---
The key difference is that it is much harder to stall for even a while. And we already have mechchtun so avoiding fatique forever wouldn't even make sense. Warlock can already just win with easier set-up, in a cituation where such tactic would be beneficial.
---

Hearthstone has a built-in deck builder if you need help making decks üòÉ When you start creating a new deck, you can just put in some cards that look interesting to you, and then click the button to make the deck finish itself based on what cards you have. It won‚Äôt give you the most competitive decks, but it‚Äôs a start!
