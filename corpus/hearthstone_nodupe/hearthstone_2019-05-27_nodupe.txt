Thief Priest don't see that play. 
---
And the Classic Set from Priest is worst compare with the other Hereos. So i dont see a problem to reduce the card at 2 mana. 
---
What to you think about this?
---
For burgle I agree ti reduce the cost because its random .
---
But thoughsteal, I think it should stay as a 3 mana because it gives information about the opponent deck.
---
And the deathrattle
---
I think the real solution is to HoF giants. Having neutral cards with that kind of mana reduction has always lead to powerful strategies revolving around them. And while I have always loved the giant mechanics (Good old Ecco Giant mage/grinder mage were sweet), I think it is better for the overall health of the game to move them out. Neutral mana cheating is just hard to balance around.
---
What if you can win every game in every mode with 5 Millhouses? Secret exodia!
---
Very accurate. I also run 1.8 copies of raiding party
---
Give Mage back Ice Block, just don't let it be in the pool for random card generators like Magic Trick. I think there would've been a lot more experimentation with luna's pocket galaxy if ice block was still a thing.

Guaranteed he broke something in the house after and his mom yelled at him about it.
---
Had to look that meme up, dude got a geico add because of how much he says dog? lol
---
I dunno. Players up to rank 10ish are really bad. I can believe he didn’t drop a game until closer to maybe rank 7
---
Still obviously tier 1.
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
Do clips like this ever jsut not play for other people?

---
I mean this is kinda just a more aggressive variant of the midrange hunter built around master's call, which is in a great place. Hunter in general is doing well this expansion
---
Well 2800 gold for the expansion, out of 28 packs, you can reasonably get a legendary. Not garenteed though. However, a secured 1600 dust, 15 packs and a golden pack doesn't sound bad.

Is this a meme?
---
i chose swampqueen's call. the 'echo' of the spells cost 0 as well. i played it tons of times coz PVE doesnt have time limit. keep playing it till u get charge minion, hit opponent's face, play it again till u get charge again, do the same thing till u win
---
A lot of people on this subreddit have said they thought it was a snake. It's a common mistake.
---
this one went a bit overboard but honestly I like to see different lists and its good I know what I'm clicking.
---
I never add people afterwards. 99% of the time it’s gonna be this shit, why bother.
---
I had that before when big druid was running around. I was like you ramped up first. Wtf
---
Sometimes i wondered why they don't just ignore it and move on. Last night I played mage and know fuck all about how piloting the deck (i only played tesspionage but stop playing it after prep nerf), met a rogue and somehow winning. I emoted him "whoops" and honestly without ill intend to BM or anything. I mean i just like the way Jaina saying it.
---
He added me and asked me why I BM him, then start lecturing me why BMing is bad. I told him i didn't mean to and he won't stop the yapping so I asked him "you can move on and ignore it, play another game and in the end of the day you could even forget about this and yet here you are you chose to be offended and angry with a random stranger for one small interaction". He seems doesn't bother with what I just typed and continue his lecture about why BMing is bad, and started calling me  names. When i told him it was uncalled for he removed me.
---
I mean I only used the emote one time for that game, and not even roping or delaying an obvious play, smh.

I’ve played a nightmare amalgam vs him and he says the same thing

Slyssa got into rank 2 with murlock Shaman. I tried a murlock decks and it's kinda difficult against control warrior (well duh), but somewhat okay with bomb warrior. Playing against hunter kinda hurt though because their minion is really hurt and have more health than your murlocks, and they can rush or charge.

---
"This encounter is fated. It is... destiny."

"Haiiii."

You are absolutely correct, my bad.
---
Galvadon! The last Kaleidosaur!
---
There are 83 5-drops in the current arena rotation, so to get exactly Stalagg and Feugen would be (1/83)*(1/83), which comes out to about 0.0145%
---
The other 5 legendaries were a random choice of 2 legendaries from each new set. If you have been playing since Cthun era and are low on dust, what decks did you make with your rotated dust? Do you regret spending it? Or do you just want more decks on top of those initial decks.
---
194 seems awfully high, did you include sets that aren't in arena? That would make the math relevant only for wild.
---
2 millhouse doesnt make her concede. She has a saying for 2. On 3 and above she concedes to the sight of them. Just summoning them is all it takes, no attacks or anything so you are wrong
---
This is really helpful, thank you so much! I didn't realize wild growth was nerfed so heavily. I did know about the murloc builds, and I'm working to those for now as I'm gathering up some dust. I'll work on a cheap token build around bloodlust for now. Thanks again!!
---
Seems like skmething out of my last CS test...
---
Vicious syndicate user polls put this quest as one of the best 20 cards in the JUG expansion(pre release rankings).  I knew already... but that was when I lost all hope in the community to determine card power level. 
---
It’s sometimes extremely difficult (even for pros and devs) to know how good some cards are... but I swear it was way way too obvious this quest was unplayable.
---
Everybody knows that the face is the place
---
Yeah, anytime, watch bmkibler on youtube from about 2 weeks ago. He had a great murloc list that didn't have skargill
---
This is a post about luck and not this game mode sucks
---
Had it too, even with double battlecry, Games were easy af
---
Greetings, friend.
---
Eh, back then everyone cheered for the nerf. Virtually every big, high mana minion was completely unplayable unless it had a really strong immediate effect thanks to BGH, so most fun, big legendaries never saw play. Nerfing a card from 7 to 6 attack was generally seen as a straight buff.
---
It was good that BGH was nerfed, because it completely defined the meta.
---
I especially like the tip of your finger in the picture you took of the computer screen.
---
Shout out to Thaddius
---
I don't know exactly which element of it that triggered it, but I hit Valdera Highborne (3 damage per attack max) for what would have been exact lethal (I think he had 4 health and I hit him for 4, bringing him to 1) and he said something like, "Yeah, I planned it that way."
---
Then I smacked him again. &lt;grin&gt;
---
I hope you win.
---
krisofive#2974 EU, you first :)
---
Now time for golden Hunter.
---
Throwing pebbles was way slower tbh
---
This patch didn't check all the boxes for me either, but I'd still rather watch Mage vs Warrior instead of Warrior vs Warrior with Elysianas. They tried something new with those buffs, things will change soon enough. I bet there will be yet another round of changes before next expansion, which is more than you could expect previously from Blizzard. And there are decks that beat Mage and Warrior, can't blame those that chose safe decks because it was soon after nerfs.
---
No, they are playing from home so deck trackers (and even opponent-deck trackers) are fully allowed. There's no point in trying to ban them because people would use them anyway and you'd never know.
---
And this is why I love Hearthstone. People can hate me for it, but the RNG plays actually make the game exciting for me as anyone has the possibility to win. Of course with RNG, you can't always win and the last game in the HS World Championship with Hunterace and Viper showed that. I love Silvername's reaction as well. LOL
---
No. Ir's about specific interactions. Judging mechanics by themselves isn't a good way to look at balance.
---
One of the reasons why Deathstalker Rexxar was so powerful is because of lifesteal minions with rush.
---
Charge is fine by itself. It doesn't get repeated damage in unless the opponent drew badly or threw away removal. There's only two minions with charge that have stats that can be hard to remove Krush and the stormwind 2/5 guy which isn't played. You can add Argent Commander because of divine shield, but again that card is rarely played. Whereas there's a ton of rush minions with healthy stat lines and are annoying af like Mulch Muncher that is created through thin air by mages currently.
---

Played one game got my pack and left. Nothing wrong with the brawl, it's just not my favorite one.
---
The best shaman deck right now is Murloc Shaman (HS Replay gives is tier 1 but i would say 1.5), it's strategy is play murlocs and hit your opponent in the face with them. They like to go wide and do chip damage then when when one of those wide boards sticks for more than a turn. They try to make that small board bigger with cards like [[Coldlight Seer]], [[Bloodlust]], and [[Murloc Warleader]]. Previously murloc decks would run out of steam very fast after there initial push but right now they have the likes of [[Underbelly Angler]] and [[Hagatha the Witch]] (Hagatha is not really a must but it can give you the potential to go long in certain match-ups). [[Scargil]] is often run but not a must. I like to run it because i like the card and the synergy it has with underbally angler but most of the time he isn't amazing. Murloc decks are quiet budget, but there are some epics (like warleader) that are a must.
---
I once fought a boss in Witchwood that makes spells have echo. So I was Tess and used hero hero power b4 any spells wele used, got 0 mana "deal 1 damage" spell and repeated it 60ish times. Here you click thrice to reduce the cost of a fireball and then play it, so it's 4 clicks for 6 damage - about 1.5 times faster than I had (1 click for 1 damage).
---
They sould give Zilliax 0 Health and lower the cost to 3. This way you'll only put it in the deck when you're actually running Mechs, not just for heals.
---
Jepetto is a joke? He's responsible for shutting down a lot of my runs. So far the times I've beaten home I would have beaten anything and had board control from turn one. I would still rather have him as final boss that wog taggle though.
---
I don't hate chapter 3 but it definitely is harder if you don't draft a deck around the restriction. I find the challenge fun, I wouldn't like if every chapter was just some minor twist that does nothing or makes it even easier.

obetachiau#2492 trading 80g on EU. I can show my quest, you go first.
---
The boss cast Time Out then cast it again for no reason straight away. Guess it doesn't understand the card properly. Made me giggle anyway.
---
I can forgive the skulls. The dead are at peace. Worst case scenario the relatives of the deceased would be impacted by this breach of privacy. However, I think it unlikely.
---
But censoring Hagatha in the swampqueen’s call card art and then not censoring the exact same art in the history bar?? Leaving her identity out in the open for all to see!? No less than 6 times!?! 
---
For shame!
---
The card is insane, cannot believe how people say is balanced.
---
Yes.
---
&gt;can now OTK actually
---
Nitpick: Not an OTK.  You mean "have an infinite damage combo if a mech sticks".  There **are** some potential OTKs you could do with this in some classes. but that generally requires even more cards and mana.
---
&gt;and the cards do not damage your deck
---
*Not playing* them does though.  There might be some matchups where you're against some control deck with no taunts where holding out for the combo might be the best play, but I suspect in almost all cases this is a bad strategy even if you happen to run all the combo pieces anyway.  If you're a mech deck running mechwarpers and similar, you're generally best off playing your mechwarpers and vomiting your mechs onto the board.
---
&gt; The word is not familiar to me.
---
That's an obvious lie.
---
&gt; Also, name-calling is unfun.
---
See, you even used it correctly, even if ironically.
---
So yes, you are acting like a dolt for playing dumb when you clearly understand what the term simply means, and forcing your own interpretation on it when you even acknowledge that it's **an implication,** and not an explicit statement.
---
Do you know how many hours per month you play this game (on estimate)
---
Yep, the best way to abuse the dice is by running very midrange minions 5-7 since you’re more likely to get them to high roll very early on in the game. 
---
8-9-10 drops are nice but you rely heavily on rng to do something. Getting an early curve is good with the treasure if you’re going all in big.
---
&gt;uninteractiveness 
---
That's another subjective term masquerading as a fact. I'd say the problem is in considering minions on board as the only form of interaction.
---
You can disrupt combo decks, you can play around control decks. Eg. recently there was a post here about someone playing against Nomi priest. He left his opponent's Northshire Cleric and other minions on board. Then damaged and healed them on purpose to fatigue him.
---
Nope. Odd warrior can’t use elyssiana, is to slow and there aren’t enough greedy decks for it to be worth using her.
---
I did a thought steal in arena against a rogue and got 2 deadly poisons, my elemental also copied a deadly poison. I died a short while later holding 3 deadly poisons.
---
&gt;and the cards do not damage your deck all that much, so even without this combo you will be doing fine.
---
Yes. What I mean by this, is that playing a deck that runs this combo must not inherently mean your deck is useless if you do not play your combo or use the cards for a different purpose. E.x. I was playing a renolock deck which for the heck of it, had mechwarper, zilliax, Glinda included. If you were lucky, you could get to 9 mana and populate the board with a glinda and 6 "X/X" lifesteal, divine shield, rush, huge minions. If you didnt draw your combo, you still got plenty of usage out of zilliax, glinda, save for mechwarper. I expect the Sn1p-Sn4p thing to run a similar course. Even if you don't combo out, you won't be unhappy to play zola or sn1p if it suits you.
---
&gt;prep, coin, ~~concede~~ wait what!? I lost to prep, coin!?
---
Dictionaries and Scrabble don't decide what is or isn't a word. People who use words and respond to their meaning ultimately do.
---
There's nothing objective about the word "unfun." Anyone who knows what the word "fun" means should be able to understand that.
---
I had a sacrificial hunter to beat him on heroic, got the shifting chameleon hero power, rocket boots, and recycling (when a friendly minion dies gain 2 armor). Evenually won in fatigue.
---
Just keep trying mate, you'll figure out your perfect deck.
---
I pressed end turn after hero power
---
No don't.
---
F
---
“Watch. Your. Candles.”
---
Yeah, when I played my first game after choosing the Scepter I was confused at first, but it made sense up until when other cards were being discounted differently. I hope someone from blizzard sees this, though I'm sure there are more pressing matters.
---
you could've played super simian sphere to speed it all up. you can't target immune minions so he couldn't trade his crap while you could SMOrc
---
Then that still isn't a correct play.
---
 killing any chances of a midrange deck making ladder even worse
---
why?
---
I don't really get you reply, seems like you're saying it would get worse with that change. And I am looking at the bigger picture hence why buffing a priest card. And this is the way blizzard does things, you know changing cards?
---
You forgot murloc!
---
You generally want to stick a witchwood imp on 1 and then direwolf to trade up or evil genius on 2 to get a beefy 2 drop on the board.  That helps a lot with managing board control in the early turns and let's you do snowbally zoo things to close out by turn 7 or 8.
---
Work on setting up plays where you can pop an egg and grim rally one of the scarabs to fill a board with 2+ hp minions.  I wont grim rally an egg unless it's a desperation play.
---
Try to hold your solarium until turn 7ish so if you pull leeroy and soulfire, you can pop them both for 10 dmg.
---
The rest is just being smart about positioning with your direwolves, setting up good juggler turns and trying to stick your carpets so you can value trade to keep the board.
---
Because mage will still cheat out giants early with your proposed change so the alternative you have to win vs them is going full aggro or play warrior.
---
And a nerf to 4 mana does not kill the deck, only slows it which is the main complaint by almost everyone about the deck, mage is cheating out giants too soon atm. 1 turn later gives time to BGH and other answers to come online for example
---
Congrats! 
---
What did blizzard give you for reaching a 1000 wins /s
---
7 Mana 3/7 Taunt that guarantees a 3 damage to all. In Control decks, it may as well be a Flamestrike. Now, throw it in Control Hunter and lul
---
WHERES THE CONCEDE?
---
I may have to edit it. With the new Scargil, Quest, and underbelly murloc, that archetype got a huge boost!
---
Why would it get nerfed
---
small indie company...
---
Blizzard realized that they can milk more money out of players by forcing them to buy tons of card packs if they want all the cards
---
They overlooked this combo and now are nerfing a card that was perfectly fine so they can push out this OP card in the middle of an expansion. I see how shaking up the meta by introducing a new card can be cool but they totally bungled it.
---
There's a lot of kids who play Hearthstone, actually. It's very marketable.
---
They want it in every deck just like Zilliax apparently.
---
It's not THAT much weaker, and it's not like Reckless Experimenter was a first-and-foremost powerhouse of every 'strong' Priest deck. It's definitely good when it is, but having Deathrattle minions that would cost 3 now cost 1 isn't a huge hit. I get that it'll restrict the ability to play Reckless Experimenter and then immediate deathrattle minions like Loot Hoarder or Dead Ringer to get some draw, but to be honest, Priest isn't that stripped for draw, or generating cards for that matter.
---
It's unfortunate, yes, but there's still no reason to be an asshole and a crybaby. They nerfed the wrong thing, yes, but calling some random person you don't know an 'asshole' just makes me laugh.
---
Was more fun than I expected it to be. Got to Gonk a Bomb Warrior, that made me really happy. :D
---
*taunt roar noises*
---
Sir, the combo is prep coin concede, you did it wrong
---
I get that, but from this post I learned that you can get different minions apart from the regular ol' 1/2 annoy-o-tron
---
Warrior and Mage are both in really awkward positions... their only truly viable decks are over-the-top busted, but they sort of have to be to compensate for the consistent and powerful aggro decks like token druid and mech hunter.
---
Warrior has a few too many options that all fit together and combo with extremely powerful cards like Boom and Omega Assembly/Devastator.
---
Mage is a value generator with few drawbacks besides inconsistency... as long as you draw precisely the cards you need, few classes can really counter a board full of giants or summoned minions.
---
So strong?!?! And only 5 mana!?!?!
---
I think you just beat the game. Congrats. Now you can move on to something else.
---
These Feugen + Stalagg post are getting out of hands, that's for sure.
---
They’re sticking together! Frog power!
---
It wouldn’t, that’s what I’m saying. 
---
OP is asking if it’s a safe thing to craft so I was just saying it’s safe because even if, for some weird reason, the card got changed he would get his full dust value back anyway
---
Is it worth paying to unlock the new solo adventure?
---
Apologies for the quality... I only initially recorded this to send to a group of friends :/
---
If you want details on the deck, I just made a post a couple days ago here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/bsxm1v/legend\_with\_antiaggro\_dragon\_mage\_no\_khadgar\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/bsxm1v/legend_with_antiaggro_dragon_mage_no_khadgar_no/)
---
He’s asking if it’s useful enough to craft, not if it will get nerfed or not
---
So [[Unpowered Steambot]] basically hardcounters Jepetto with any source of healing... Interesting. Killing your own [[Safeguard]] works the same way, as well as [[Public Defender]] in Warrior (although getting reliable healing every turn in Warrior might be harder).

You need to "buy" them from the Blizzard store. "Buy" is in quotations because it costs nothing, but it's still necessary because it's Wild-only content.
---
Although I read something about new players not being able to "buy" it due to a mistake, but they're working on it, pretty sure.
---
I'm getting a headache just thinking about it
---
&gt; not just a graphic glitch
---
It actually had two Attack and one Health?
---
The thing is that every agro deck is more brainless, certain combos like shudderwock seem brainless, and then a deck like cubelock which required a skilled pilot is still one of the hated t1 decks ever. 
---
Control warrior throughout most of its history has also required skilled pilots in order to manage limited removal resources and I understand that warrior has near infinite removal at the moment, but it still loses to mage and hunter, and those decks can also beat agro so I think people are just complaining about a very beatable deck.
---
Wait.. This is illegal!
---
If you're asking for safe crafts, it probably means you're relatively short on dust, which means you shouldn't be crafting Golden.
---
There’s a lot of kids who play MTG to but I don’t think anyone would argue that the game is marketed to children.
---
I feel like the idea of the player being a caster/summoner has been done to death (magic the gathering and hearthstone both do it) so the idea of the player telling a story sounds way cooler, I'd love to see some cool narration about things happening in the story as I play a card.

Bomb toss, baited arrow. 2 rapid fire, baited arrow. 2 rapid fire, hatchet hit, hero power. If you can't lethal there was always zul'jin, but that happened rarely when I just couldn't lethal on 9.

Would have been really fun if it was Wild. Making Standard decks wasn't as much fun so I just played a couple games with a meta deck and stopped. For experimental brawls like this you really just need access to all the cards.
---

---
On the contrary, I think the fact that there are some bosses for which you have to build your deck in anticipation is a good thing. In dungeon run, building a deck that can beat both Candlebeard and Sturmi is actually challenging, while building a deck that is generally powerful enough to beat the other bosses is usually not.  
---
I think monster hunt would be much more fun to replay if there was another boss as tough as Azalina which required different strengths to beat.
---
In rumble run, you know exactly which bosses/shrines to prepare for, so the bosses should be stronger. A boss that can highroll to varying degrees means that the more powerful decks aren't guaranteed to win, so there are still meaningful decisions about how to prepare for worst case scenarios.
---
How though? It's a bit confusing to set it all up.
---
You okay there bud?
---
Hey, quick question. I’ve been playing for about 3 years on mobile. Are you telling me that I can get the Goblins and Gnomes or Noxramus adventures? I just have to ‘buy’ them?
---
Why is a good idea to have players play with one deck vs multiple decks? Gets stale real quick.
---
I agree they may be the strongest class despite not having the strongest deck (odd paladin).  Murloc is tier 1, even shaman tier 2, shudderwok tier 3, I don't think the burn archetype is viable though, definitely the freeze is not.  So while I disagree with a lot of your opinions on actual decks, as a class they may indeed be the strongest (though again, don't actually have the strongest deck).
---
But it's not a spell so that's really not an elegant solution, just from a flavor stand point alone. And Twinspell is from the Year of the Dragon and the new card will rotate with the Year of the Raven cards so that would just be a really awkward change.
---
On the contrary, I think the fact that there are very powerful bosses for which you have to build your deck in anticipation is important for replayability. Learning what strategies win those particular fights, and preparing for them early makes the runs interesting the whole way through.   
---

Agreed! I would love to be able to use the golden versions of the cards I have for the game mode (or toggle them all on).
---
At least you get the long turn!
---
Besides Dr.Boom, these all sound unnecessary

"This is the worst trade deal in Azeroth!"
---

---
Ooo myyy gooood!
---
Maybe because Doomguard was in every lock deck. Prep likely was in a lot, but the designed the entire class spells around Prep, so getting rid of it would have done more damage? Not really making an argument, just trying to think of their thought process.
---
Yes but then what about my cool title
---
I think it's as safe as it's ever going to be.
---
You have the standard murloc shaman variants that run it for late game.  However I think after the buffs, the overload version of this deck is going to turn out to be better.
---
You have control shaman in standard, which is I guess a tier 3? deck or so, but if we get more good shaman cards, could become a better deck before wok rotates out.
---
And of course any new archetypes that open up in the next year before he rotates out.
---
Then in wild you have the tempo evolve shudderwok (though you also need zola, jepetto and loatheb...) which is a tier 3 deck but super fun to play and some people have hit legend (even top 5 legend) with it.
---
If you want it then I say go for it now especially if you will use it in wild.
---
I'd say it's one of the most fun cards ever printed IMHO (and I did not enjoy the old standard combo version, I like it as a tempo card).  I personally never craft gold just seems like a waste but that's your call.
---
You missed the point, polarization is why people disliked Odd Warrior, same with Quest Rogue, Jade Druid etc. Not going to argue which decks take more skill to play like it's some kind of dick-measuring contest
---
 It true at all, Tempo Mage would be a solid deck.
---
It’s the same case as Control Warrior.
---
Both classes would have puzzled through different archetypes and achieved meta decks if everyone wasn’t just defaulting to the OP net decks.
---
I like the idea of Casters, reading spells.  The name strikes me as modern or niche. Which is not necessarily a bad thing.  My first connection with "casters" is with esport casters.  Could just be me.  If the name was Spellcasters -- it would carry the same traditional flavour as "Storytellers".  But "Casters" may be more "fun" or possibly "edgy"?

I thought it shouldn't work, because the worgen is not a Windfury minion, but Whirlwind Tempest targets "your minions WITH Windfury", and not "your Windfury minions". Worgen is damaged, so he has Windfury, so he should have Mega-Windfury. Definitely a bug.
---
Would be interresting how Kadghar work with [[A New Challenger...]]

Ja
---
Becase ironically Aggro Mech Hunter beats the shit out of Dr. Rushy Mechs.
---
You can get all the old adventures for $20-25 on the blizz store.  Unless you unlocked a wing back when they were released (years ago), there is no way to buy them with gold.
---
If you play wild some of them are "worth" the money (compared to buying packs), if not they actually are worth more dust than just buying packs (if you dust everything).  I don't have any but my friend bought almost all of them because he likes the solo modes so much.  They can be fun but once you beat them on standard and heroic and the mode where you get a random deck, they are not really worth playing again and again (like some people do w/ dungeon run).

---
All in all, you had the right idea for some of them, need to learn to run AoE for others, and are horrible at designing nerfs. Nice try though.
---
I mean those are partial counters, they're just also horrible decks.
---
Thanks for the info. I’ll have to research which cards are available in those adventures and decide if they’re worth my money. I don’t really play wild but I don’t disenchant anything I don’t have gold doubles for because I am all about collecting.
---
I thought big mage sucked but I thought renolock was like tier 2 in wild
---
What is Battlecry rogue?
---
Even Warlock could do this to play around naturalise. Arguable whether it’s the right play but it happened often.
---
The people demand Miniature Warfare.
---
I hope they make such an interaction somewhere
---
The animation is bugged. It should be showing 3 2/2 khadgars going into your deck.
---
Remember that card text has priority over animations.
---
I am a wild player. Your idea sounds good on paper, but running this many tech cards hurts your other matchups substantially. Not to say that you could still lose to barnes or shadow essence into vargoth high roll. Ultimately it’s just not worth it, and you are better off just accepting the loss. 
---
Although the treasury doomsayer combo is a viable tech in mechathun-lock or cubelock.
---
If you are short on dust you could wait til the post buff vicious syndicate report comes out.  I always do that before I craft anything but I am extremely stingy with my dust unless it goes into a wild deck I also like, since I play both modes.
---
He is definitely not a safe craft compared to cards like say ziliax, but if you really want him, he's not like a fringe card who may never see play either.  Anyway the report should come out on vicioussyndicate.com 6/8/19 and if you see him in a deck you like then I say go for it!
---
Yeah Renolock is decent, but it's not anymore when you're changing 5 cards to basically useless stuff just to give you a small extra chance against big priest.
---
Or play against Gallywix.
---
Tempo Rogue with sap and Quest Mage destroy big priests
---
Yeah there are some good cards in some of them if you like wild, namely brann, sir mirgly (the 1 cost murloc guy), loatheb (great card), few others.  You can always keep the good stuff and disenchant the others.  You can also youtube the adventures to see if it's something you enjoy or not.  If you like the lich king adventure mode that is similar to what they're like (but offer the cards and they have a lot more content).
---
Silvername and Thijs was very popular 😀
---
How's that million dollar tournament lookin?
---
You must be playing a different game. In my Hearthsone, various Hunter decks have been specifically countering Control Warrior for two months now. Bomb Hunter beats it. Deathrattle Hunter devastates it. Beast Hunter is the weakest of the pack, but it will keep the armor in check and OTK more often than not. Not sure about Secret Hunter, but it was mostly just a deck because Rogue was a class, and I'm confident that with some tech it would beat Warrior as well.
---
Tripply negated by the extra arms change. Plus, the experimenter's best support cards have rotated out.
---
I dont think its possible for them to summon two, because the firsts deathrattle would trigger without the other one dying yet. Or does it work differently?
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
I wish we got a regular zayle we could disenchant instead of a golden one we can't.  I'm not gonna complain about marin or c'thun since they were basically 100% free.
---
Wendy is not someone you want to mess with.
---
&gt;It just completely crippled my mech hunter deck
---
Oh, *cry* me a river.
---
Play zoolock as it counters the decks you dislike.  Hope your luck turns around.  Mech hunter is a top deck so maybe just try again tomorrow.
---

---
1v1 me and play one of those decks and we got a deal
---
Option 1.  It cant have twinspell removed because then it loses its double edge as a desperation removal tool, and if it is used as such it makes it absolutely gg if it doesnt have twinspell.
---
Thats if it gets nerfed.  they may target khadgar instead, raising his mana.  It feels like Khadgar is the GG card in the combo imo.
---
Awesome, thanks! I’ll try both of those. You rock.
---
You need a flair or this post will get deleted.
---
Anyway and don't take this the wrong way... but secrets are good against newer players who don't know them, and not near as good against better (more experienced) players.  You can download a deck tracker that helps you learn what secret it is.  Or what I did when I was new was look up a class's secrets for standard whenever I hit one.  If you can also look up what deck they are playing to help guess the secret.  
---
You can often "play around" the secret to your advantage.  For example if you have a bunch of 2 health minions and think it's the hunter secret that triggers when you hit the opponen't s face to deal 2 dmg to you and your minions, then instead use your minions to kill his minions til you have just 1 left and then go face to "waste" his secret.
---
If you are playing vs mage they have a lot of secrets that do something to their minion that dies, or the minion you play or attack with.  So just use your smallest minion to attack/play first (or kill their weakest minion).  If you think they have counterspell play a cheap spell (or better yet the coin) first.
---
So hang in there they are not that good once you learn them (though the hunter secrets still can be pretty good overall) but you do need to learn how to win against them.
---
So... Jeppeto is the new trap room?
---
You eventually learn what Secrets belong to which class and how to probe for them (or how to work around the commonly used ones). Plus, quite a few minions remove Secrets from the board. 
---
9 times out of ten, you're in for a surprise if you do one of these things:
---
- summon a minion
---
- cast a spell
---
- attack
---
So learn to do it with expendable cheap minions first. The Dungeon Run type solo campaigns are actually a good training for it as there are specific Secret-oriented bosses in every one of them.
---
My apologies, I was referring to beast hunter. You are absolutely right about bomb hunter, although I don't often see Zul'Jin in that deck because I am usually dead by T7/8. I have played against one secret hunter but once I played around the traps by playing 2 cards a turn/not going face, he ran out of steam and I just plowed on through.
---
How can someone judge the performance of a deck (let alone define it as meta killer) after 5 games is beyond me...
---
I got a minion from the opponents side of the board with the +1/+1 put all enemy minions in your deck, then duplicated it, in that order it actually worked.
---
One other thought if you really hate token druid (or other token based decks) you could tech in unleash the hounds to your mech hunter.  It's not as good in a lot of the other matchups but it definitely will wreck soul of the murloc or wisp and is also good against a wide board of 1-3 health minions in general.
---

Thanks!! I have kind of done that, like start my turn with smaller attacks and that but I still have a lot of learning to do
---
1 time seen myself, 4th time on reddit
---
How the hell did you get a 1 mana coin? OPOP
---
I have them actually! They definitely help but I feel like I’m always missing something as I still always lose to those decks, even after clear I gotta the soul of the Murloch and wisps :/
---
When I meet her on Heroic, she keeps rolling Totem Golems and Nightmare Amalgams. Does anyone know if they're using different probability tables between normal and heroic modes?

I was watching this live  (ok, playing HS on one screen and streaming this on another) and my mind was blown. The best part was the interview with Thijs.
---
Exactly. My poor Odd beast druid. PepeHands
---
You’re missing the “point”. You’re using an aggressive deck which has numerous positive matchups. Why are you surprised that your deck also is capable of having a *negative* matchup against other types of aggressive decks? 
---
Also how many matches have you played today? If you’ve played 20 matches &amp; lost all of them, you’re just bad at the game. If you’ve played 40 matches &amp; lost 20, then you’re likely just the typical end of the month Rank 5 player, and there’s not much to be dismayed about in regards to being among the top 10-5% (depending on what metrics you believe) of players. 
---
If you want to 1v1 “for fun”, I’m happy to oblige. I don’t have either of the decks you pointed out though. Battletah Aspirin#11300
---
hey I agree. these are definitely the best players but that doesn't mean rng isn't a huge part of the game. everybody playing hs has to deal with its randomness and those players are just the best at dealing with it.
---
yea i was searching the [battle.net](https://battle.net) store and couldnt find anything. Glad to know i will be able to play it after they fix it. Thanks for the info \^\^
---
Ya I think he could say, "Early on been having success with this deck, I think it's fun and can be good." Etc. Then again, pros say dumb shit all the time remember Meati saying Nomi priest was tier 0 because he played like 20 games as his "data"...
---
Try elder scrolls legends.  its familiar to hearthstone in mechanics and interface of cards, but rng is toned the hell down.  For instance, instead of a card that disscovers 2 cards give one to you and your opponent at random, legends has a varient that you get to pick what goes to your opponent.
---
There are far less hyper mandatory legendaries and epics (i honestly didmt feel that any were gg cards in and of themselves, altho some decks do require a certain core legendary), amd they are far more generous with legendaries and dust.
---
2 tother things i really like - decks can be from 30-75 cards (depending on how many "classes" of cards you choose to combine in the deck), so deckbuilding is far more interesting.  also, there is an anti snowball mechanic via the rune and prophecy system, wjere every 5 health you lose you draw a card and if its a prophecy card, it casts for free.  This again makes deckbuilding interesting and makes for very interesting decisions for attacking face vs clearing board, as most of the time going straight face  is a bad idea.  It wonderfully mitigates draw rng as well.
---
you also will have no need to buy packs w  money, but there are adventure expansions that unlock and give you new sets of cards for about 20 bucks each, like how hearthstone used to have.  There are 4 of them now, far less than how many hearthstone shits out, and by far not all are mandatory.
---
Finally if you like arena, you will love the solo arena mode option.  You draft deck, fight 7 ai arena opponents, and with practice can reliably win back what you put in - tho only about 50 gold surplus as opposed to the much higher reward human arena.  Still, its a great way to practice arena drafting and play that i rly wish hearthstone had! 
---
Sry for long post unrelated to hs, but i feel your frustration and know that legends is often overlooked as an alternative, but it was my favorite card game as someone who had only played hearthstone and took so much of the simplicity of UI and interactions for granted.
---
I've played it actually for a few weeks, but today I noticed it performs pretty well after the meta shifted.
---
Secrets aren’t particularly effective against an experienced player unless they’re generated randomly. At least, not effective in terms of “tricking” them. If you have familiarity with an opponents deck that actually contains non-random secrets, you’re going to be able to deduce which one they’re using &amp; why. At the very least you’ll know what the *possibilities* are, and from there act accordingly. “Act accordingly” means either playing in such a way as to maximally reduce harm to yourself - or having the cognizanze to “just go for it” if you’re in Dire Straights &amp; realize that being proactive is your only out in the event of a losing situation.

I am saving your list, and I am excited to try it. I've been running murloc shaman because the games are relatively faster and the winrate is 74% from ranks 7-4. Feels like I am in most games with the deck.

I'm offended. You should know that I'm perfectly able to go prep coin after 5 years of Heartstone.

It says summon it *with* Taunt and diving shield. Simian Sphere says summon it then give it Immune and Can't be Targeted.
---
What does the spell do?
---
I barely had any minions that could do anything against this boss but I managed to survive several turns. Then I finally had a play when I thought I had a chance, I had Mirror Entity and potion of Polymorph up and he threw a Y'Shaarj on the table. But guess what, not only his deck can ress 5 lich kings he also has a fucking mind control to snatch the one big minion I was able to keep through sheer luck. Fuck this boss.

Get soularium and carpet. Zoo without carpet is awful

I’ll play ya when I get home. I won about 10 today, and it’s just aggravating because I usually don’t lose this much. And I don’t feel too aggressive with my deck. I feel like I control until I get my combo

Honestly that should show how lame the tournaments are really when a solo streamer is more entertaining than a big tournament

2 things bother me about this:
---
Number 1 : You clickbait the fuck out of the clip by leaving out the info that he can't stream "DURING THE NORTH AMERICAN GM TOURNAMENT" which makes sense. They want everyone to watch the tournament.
---
Number 2 : That they don't allow him to stream AT ALL. So he can't stream autochess instead...which is a completely different game. That's bullshit.
---
Being done now

here is the secret at turn 8 play have a high health minion on the board magnetize Missile Launcher + Venomizer = GG

Wouldn’t say I’m bad. I’m still kinda new. Went from 20 to 10 in a week with mech hunter.

I'd have to be on their payroll to comply with that order.  If hes not then hes stupid.
---
Wouldn’t be surprised to see the big streamers quit grandmasters eventually if this is the case.
---
he didn't say "half of the week" and he wouldn't have accepted the contract to play in grandmasters if he didn't think it was increasing his income considering he doesn't even care enough about how he does to play a deck before he submits it.

1) He provided context in the title so that's fine in my book, that title is already very long already too. Can definitely see where you're coming from
---
2) For the actual clip, yep, that's super bullshit, why does he even need permission from blizzard to stream other games in the first place? That seems super especially considering how much that probably cost him

---
The purpose of Elysiana is to not take fatigue. 
---
Blizz (probably*) didn't forget about the coin, their goal was to stop the guaranteed hour long draw in the mirror. Only one person gets the coin so the other will take 10+ turns of fatigue = 55+ damage.

Well, that depends on the person. Obviously plenty of people watch a streamer because of their personality, not the game. I wouldn't watch dog if he wasn't playing HS during a tournament, but maybe if he was. I get it. 
---
What I don't understand is why he can't (or maybe he can) restream the tournaments and just host a viewing party for free $$$ like a lot of other game streamers do. Who cares if he does that?
---
We have fun in this meta by not only playing a top tier aggressive deck like mech hunter
---
I remember he talked about how he was very reluctant and on the fence about joining because it does cost him a lot of money in streaming time. Not sure what pushed him into deciding it was worth it.
---
I like how you're mad OP made it clickbait, but not clickbait enough. But technically he did say "to stream" not "to stream Hearthstone."
---
It can be interesting just to see how you change strategies from chapter to chapter. For example. as a mage you might like playing with open the waygate in the bank because the cache of cash can help complete it faster. But in the streets you might prefer a freeze heavy strategy for mage because it can cripple your opponent when they have less minion slots to work with.

There were no refunds when molten giant got buffed so I figure no. They also probably don't Want to encourage players to disenchant these cards as opposed to playing them.

Sorry, I don't agree with this at all. I can't imagine too many people rushing to buy packs for the small chance that they get a card that they can get more dust out of than usual. I'm always happy for more dust - but if I were blizzard it would be a no brainier to not refund dust for buffed cards.

According to [hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/2/control-warrior#tab=matchups), "Midrange Hunter" (which I suspect is mostly Beast Hunter) wins against Control Warrior 59.6% of the time, which is even better than Bomb Hunter's record. Secret Hunter is indeed the best Hunter matchup for Warrior, but the Hunter is still favored.

This is hilarious

And much of the lost money may just be temporary for a few reasons.  The obvious one is it's not competition for for competition's sake.  There's dollar prizes in it and if he places well it would be a net positive for it.  Even if he didn't, exposure is exposure.  Plenty of viewers for the official stream are not his usual audience and may watch him again later.  Finally, both the health of the game and his relationship to Blizzard are important things in his income.
---
It's not the same. The Tavern upgrades don't apply a buff to the card, they change the card's base status.
---
For instance, say you apply +2/+2 upgrade to a Firefly to make it 3/4, then play it in a game, and then it gets silenced. The Silence won't make it into a 1/2, it will still be a 3/4 even after it got silenced. Try it if you don't believe me.
---
As such, it's to be expected that if you put three copies of the card in your deck that it would have the upgrade in the other copies as well, because that's the card's base profile now.
---
There must be a reason for him to agree to it. He says it costs him a ton of money to not stream but I imagine he must be getting something out of the deal
---
just wait until you play  darknes...
---
warriors are bullshit and so are the people who play as them
---
I 'member 1 time.
---
Jepettoo played the summon 4 1/1 on turn 1.
---
keep passing 4dmg a turn 
---
he cannot play anything and the draw summon 1/1 does not work on full board
---
Wait til you are confidence your hand is good enough and flip the table
---
Strange. When I face her it's usually Vitality and Mana tide totems, just different luck I guess.
---
I guess the tournament wouldnt count those views as total
---
Dang son, u got GOT
---
I feel like there is a large gap in viewership behind the top 3-5 Hearthstone streamers. I can’t imagine it is as big of a deal for the rest of them.
---
If you go through all possible heroes, powers, and decks, you unlock the ability to name Ben Brodes next born.
---
I had no reddit coins to guild that comment above the silver it deserves, so I payed with karma
---
You just gave away that you hit maybe Rank 7 once, and are to this day still very proud of yourself.
---
If you'd be actually good at this game you wouldn't need to write such arrogant bullshit.
---
The imp doesn't because I tried plot twist before
---
How do you beat sturmi? She always steamrolls me so hard...
---
Unit 477 is on its way sir
---
I highly doubt people watching haven't heard of dog.
---
To be fair, I get the impression that it only really worked because OP managed to roll the Warlock DK hero power from that one treasure, which... Obviously isn’t all that reliable.
---
Though I can still see it working if you managed to get a deck assembled that can both consistently heal you and can plink him down without playing any minions that he can run his 1/1s into.
---
I immediately regret this decision.
---
I've gotten legend multiple times over the years. Got legend last month with Zoo when it wasn't even that good. Sorry kid.

---
And he can't even do that because of Crowded Streets.
---
I’m such an idiot. I name every single one of my decks. Explains why I’m hardstuck at the 15 floor
---
yeah, maybe if you're not looking at the situation objectively.
---
Yeah the hooktush package seems good

 CityLights#11889 NA Quest trade, i show then you go first.
---
No he's right
---
Keep in mind dog's roots. He became big because he was constantly top 50 legend with ramp druid and people liked him.
---
Though I wouldn't be surprised to see him not renew (assuming he doesn't get relegated). I think it's easy to underestimate how much prep work is involved in playing a high profile tournament every single week.
---
&gt; Why not allow him to stream non-HS games? Those viewers aren't necessarily choosing between HS-championship and dog.
---
Yes, a lot of them are. A vast majority of Dog's streamers are into competitive Hearthstone, but like Dog more than they like Hearthstone GM. Plus, Twitch streaming is, at the end of the day, an entertainment medium. So it doesn't matter what game is being played, what matters is if what they're watching is more entertaining than something else.
---
I just want a whole golden, no matter what is inside the deck. Im even okay with 30 copies of Millhouse Manastorm
---
Thanks for answering
---
His hero power reduces a mana of a card in his hand by one, and his cost’s 0
---
For me the packs and golden packs are the most valuable goodies ,  the golden legendary zayle cannot be disenhanted and it's like a scuffed version of whizbang i think as the current deck recipe for that card is pretty weak.
---
Fortunately the wings does have more feature compared to the previous expansion so the 700g is not that bad.  I just hope they can keep this up and the next one will be fun and a different one too since they are using the paid model now.
---
Cool insight into some of the processes behind the buffs. I will be more strict with dusting bad legendaries with the possibilty of more of them coming in the future.

Proverbs 30:5-6 KJVS

Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him. [6] Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.

Romans 10:13-17 KJVS
---
For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. [14] How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? [15] And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! [16] But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? [17] So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

I don't know what you were expecting, he is a pretty shit wizard after all.

That's it wrap it up folks nothing to see here MOVE IT ALONG

assert dominance, draw 5

[NA] Have quest. Add me. TheAcer#1931
---
You must go first. I'll show.
---
A guy climbed to legend using only commons and rares a couple weeks ago, so I wouldn't say it's pay to win.
---
Oh I got to ask, do you need to purchase all the wings at once to get zayle, or can I buy them one at a time with gold.
---
The deck lists may be weak, but they are more deck lists, which atm I'm strapped for beyond whizbang and my one bomb warrior list.
---
YOU GAVE JARAXXUS! YOU GAVE JARAXXUS! ERADAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION!
---
Hello darkness my old friend
---
I hecklebotted a mountain giant. Next turn it became two with his conjures calling
---
Just as well you cut it off as he started to edplain "...but...." gotta maximise outrage eh op? Wouldn't want understanding why he's doing it to get in the way.
---
Yeah okay Blizzard. I’m not going to be happy until Nat Pagle is an 8/8. /s
---
Zoo is aggro-control and more of a board control deck than a face deck. Zoo was tier 3 and got shit on by control warriors. Zoo is one of the more fair decks in the game as well, it's super interactive and trades with you constantly. I've gotten legend with Handlock and Freeze Mage before in the past, are those skill intensive enough for you?  
---
Also, I agree you don't necessarily need to be good to get to legend, I'm just countering this guy's claim that I've only gotten to maybe rank 7.
---
Hitting legend 6k isnt good, im legend 200 and don't consider myself good comapared to zalae or someone like that
---
Wise words
---
little bit of backstory, I was playing bomb warrior because I had warrior quest, and he was playing conjurer mage. I greeted him at the beginning, then did nothing for my first turn. next turn I coined augmented elekk, and played clockwork goblin on turn 3. he played the 2/7 taunt that costs 1 less per each enemy minion, and I killed it next turn with militia commander and clockwork goblin. He proceeded to play mountain giant next turn, which I left alive because I was 4 off lethal, and wanted to go face. next turn he plays khadgar+conjurer's calling on the giant, summoned 4 mountain giants and conceded.
---
I like to think he says "What fu**ing is this" lol
---
Spirit of the Shark, bunch of Lackeys, Togwaggle and sometimes his scheme. Check out Dog or Thijs if you want a deck list.
---
Squared circle and this sub go together like Ouphes and Owies.
---
Though mech warper was always a problem...
---
Yeah elixir sucks, you literally burn half your deck
---
I'm not saying that the current way is the intuitive way for the players, but the cost resetting upon draw isnt a bug. 
---
If Blizzard thinks this shouldnt work the way it currently does, they will have to hard code this interaction to work in a different way.
---
This has happened before aswell, and the interaction wasnt changed:
---
During the Taverns of Time arena, if you discovered an unidentified card from Timeway Wanderer (Battlecry: Discover a spell. Reduce it's cost by 5...) it would be reset to the original cost when drawn.
