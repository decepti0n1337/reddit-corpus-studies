There's  a thing known as a proxy which people use to represent cards they don't own. It can be text on a card or just a regular printed paper stuck onto a card. They are usually only used for testing decks with cards you don't own or in a friends playgroup

I was talking about Legacy or Modern and you can compare it to hearthstone wild if you want.
---
I actually completely respect this line of thinking lol
---
Usually the bugs are a different order of complexity. Random crashes can be very hard to diagnose if it's a race condition or something similar. This would be hard to pinpoint
---
Malygos is card that finds some kind of combo deck to call home almost EVERY expansion. The power level of these decks vary quite a bit, tho. If you like the idea of playing these kinds of decks, keeping Malygos and waiting for your collection to grow will pay off.
---
All chapters give 3 uldum packs
---
The very fact Doomgaurd has the drawback it does pretty much excludes it from being used in a straight control deck.
---

---
A control tool, as is a card that would see consistent play in control oriented decks without any help, is one that would be capable of at least trading one for one in card advantage. 
---
Doomgaurd has a floor of minus two since if you use it to kill an opposing minion, you'll have taken away one card from your opponent at the cost of it and two other cards.
---
any additional rewards like golden common cards etc?
---
If u complete everything you get a golden pack
---

The pros all literally play the same decks with, generally speaking, at most a couple tech choices. Very, very rarely does someone bring some random as homebrew deck.

malorne tree druid boiiii &lt;3

According to Liquipedia he's earned over $150k. 
---
You'd think someone who has experienced such success would show some sporting behaviour, especially in something like a qualifier event. Though in my experience, most of the "pros" you play in such events are more unsporting than average when they lose.
---
Kinda funny since I'm also turkish but can't speak a damn word of those moon runes, would kill to know what he was saying
---
Schuba#1702 NA, I show you go first

Beautiful...
---
They are phasing charge out. I’m pretty sure they explicitly stated this when rush was introduced, but there will be no more cards printed with charge. If they never made this clear, well ... that’s the plan.
---
i always though he said messy killing
---
I just realized they’re the exact same image :/
---
I agree that it was way more fun until ToomDoom happened. Big part of the issue? You can tell at a glance which classes won out and which didn't.

 I refuse to believe he says mercy. Messy just makes so much more sense, especially because he kills all minions on board.

Tournament and ladder are completely different metas. HW Paladin has a polarizing matchup spread, which is fine in tournaments bc you have bans.

It's a tier 4 deck.

That clip is perfect. His completely gobsmacked, slack jawed reaction is perfection. It ends at just the right time, no words necessary.

the big way to kill end game druid with my setup is to keep the kiuns alive, if I have no way to kill the kuns I cant play more and get more armor, stuff like khartut defender is good for thatc cause I havve to run kun into a defender 3 times to kill the Kun

Your argument:
---
&gt;So you cant deny or prohibit anyone from judging him especially when OP is right.
---
Argument #1:  "OP is right."
---
&gt;Still anyone who blamed blizzard or left official events are just pathetic people. You cant cancel that, I cant either. If you are in doubt just wait and check people opinions later
---
Argument #2: Admirable is "just a pathetic person."  You think that later, public opinion will support you, for... some reason.
---
Usually, an argument has some reasons behind it.  For instance, "Admirable is a pathetic person **because**..."
---
Here's an argument.  "It is good for people to act in support of their morals, because if they don't, then those morals can be ignored with no consequence".
---
Or here's another argument.  "Political action is not pointless, because it has yielded results in the past."
---
Now, if you want to rebut those arguments, then you need to rebut them with reasons, instead of saying "nah pathetic, demagogue".  Otherwise, you really are just talking to yourself.

numberwang#2315 EU quest trade. I show, you go first.

More power to you and all supporters, and more accountability from Blizzard.

Krishma#2297 EU, 80g quest trade. I'm willing to go first only if you have several successful past trades in your profile.
---
The karma, social justice slacktivism Reddit train has long passed, Mr. KarmaWhore.
---
This is definitely not it. They're easy to abuse with good synergy. For example Snowflipper Penguin was played in Aggro Druid during KFT/KnC
---
I dont think they really foresaw this encounter
---
Although the SN1P-SN4P issue is as idiotic as ever, on an unrelated note, it always makes me feel a little warm inside when an old card that nobody used is played again. Like here with Summoning Portal, or Voodoo Doctor with Heallock, or back in the days of Odd Paladin that ran Raid Leader or Stormwind Champion.
---
Come to wild with meca, you only need 10k dust for mechalock.
---
sniplock is tier 0 right now so yeah definitely worth it.
---
Yeah yeah, but not in this subreddit pls

Dude, if Lazul foresaw this encounter, I don't wanna know what she sees on a daily basis. She's gotta be on one hell of a trip if this is what her visions let her see

Not once did I mention my own beliefs, NOR did I defend Blizzard. I was critiquing how you chose to take this "holier than thou" approach to spouting your stance, then immediately reneged as soon as you were called out on it.
---
In other words, I was being hostile towards you, not defensive towards Blizzard. I can both agree with you on one thing AND disagree on another believe it or not. But thank you for choosing to point fingers in an attempt to completely deflect any criticism because "look guys he's a bad person!"

I’m interested to see the play numbers.

Both of which have seen play during the lifetime of the game. 
---
Magma Rager or that 8 Mana mage spell that puts 5 secrets into play both are worse
---
Congrats.
---
Blizzard is only the peak of the iceberg. It's quite naive thinking that you make a difference just by boycotting one company.  There is a plethora of companies and governments that have worse connections to China than blizzard.

Old Equality was nerfed for a reason and still sees play. 4 mana board clear combo in the swarm/buff class, while Mage regularly used a non-guarantueed 5 mana combo as the ultimate AoE class, wasn't exactly balanced.

I found giggling too slow, you already have enough evolve targets and board flooding without it. Piper is great for completing quest since it’ll get you your lackey generators or provide you with ample card advantage post quest.

I’ve found the double MC quite useful actually. There’s a lot of board flood going on esp with nzoth and making your opponent play around having 4 minions is good for you.
---
&gt;if they were doing that, it's unlikely I'd be supporting that restaurant anyway.

That's why it's a hypothetical.  You didn't respond to the example I set.

No dude you are the very first one in all of HS!!! Congrats!!!
---
What are u complaining about bro it could’ve cast like cataclysm or or any damage face or now even astral communion likes there’s so many worse outcomes.
---
Oh we didnt forget it's just old news
---
Internally, Shifting Scroll costs 0 and just can't be played. This can be seen with stuff like jousts, Prismatic Lens, etc. That's why Servant of Yogg can play it. However, you are right, it should be "null" cost, and therefore it shouldn't be less than (or more than) 5. And honestly, it shouldn't even be in the "play a random spell" pool since it is not a spell you should ever be able to cast.
---
Obviously, the picture is mirrored!
---
Vampire
---
First
---
Beggining is never easy, So gettimg into it is always hard, but belive me what I Say when you fell it, it Will Just click
---
Second
---
You had problem with mana system, Just... Well get used to it, all decks are build around it So the Games go how efficient you spend it, and this is why decks are calssified in 3 (Main) types of decks
---
Aagro-a lot of low mana cost to KILL oponent fast
---
Tempo-Trying to spend all mana every turn trying to be as efficient as possible
---
Controll-Leaving a lot of unused Mana and relying  on high Cost cards
---
When you know how to play with each Type you Will know how good mana system is (or you Can Just play druid and complitly ignore this system in Best case scenario)
---
Third
---
Play reguraly, if you want to be F2P, or Just know how to play, be consistent, learning this game is though nut to break So practice is a key, and find some stramer or YouTuber who makes some guides or Just watch him play (Or Watch Trollden, you Can actually learn a lot)
---
Tl:dr-1) Just play the game
---
2) Learn about mana system
---
3) Watch some YouTube and be consitent
---
Thats all from me i hope i helped
---
No
---
No, he’s just being a jackass
---
I don't necessarily think edge cases are obvious, but the Mel streak in me kinda loves them if they're consistent just unexpected.
---
Glenda crowskin + sea giant ftw
---
&gt;I feel as if no one talks about this really oppressive spell, which completly stops the entire enemy board in its tracks for an entire turn.
---
That's hardly bad. All the card's able to do is delay the inevitable, not actually put a stop to it.
---
&gt;A big aspect of why I find this OP is that there's very little counter play to it, other than hope you have a spell counter. 
---
# Sometimes counter play isn't reactive.
---
You would counter Frost Nova by only pressuring your opponent just enough that playing the card isn't worth it. Just because you can dump your hand doesn't mean you should. 
---
&gt;If you don't, ggwp ez win 
---
Hardly. Unless the Mage is dropping it the turn before they pull off some combo.
---
&gt;There's a high likelyhood they'll play it late game and proceed to mash your face in. 
---
Only if you weren't able to pressure them enough early on to force their hand. That's another way to counter it.
---
&gt;Its extremely unfun as you just sit there twiddling your thumbs. 
---
I can agree with that, but Control in *any* and *every* card game is all about saying "no" to your opponent.
---
[This shirt](https://mtgproshop.com/product/nope-t-shirt-mens/) exists for a reason.
---
What's worse?
---
Your opponent stopping you from attacking for a turn at the cost of three mana or clearing your board for five?
---
&gt;It feels like a big f you for playing well and having the upper hand. 
---
# What it means is you didn't actually have the upper hand in the first place and were efficiently outplayed.
---
&gt;And for 3 cost per turn. What other 3 card turn has this much effectiveness? 
---
Time Out, Ice Block, Elemental Destruction, Healing Rain, Lightning Storm, Savage Roar (Frost Nova's dark reflection), Reckless Flurry, Treachery targeting Doomsayer, and Witching Hour summoning Hadronox.
---
They should do a daily quest that's tied in to this where you have to summon 50 treants. 
---
But I like this. Generally I've been a believer that human reforestation efforts are pretty sustainable, but thanks to Bolsanaro, I think Brazil is trying to suffocate the rest of the world and yeah... probably can't hurt to plant as many trees as possible.
---
But for the record, I never play Druid because my main decks are both hunter and token druid is a pretty nasty hard counter to my builds.
---
Glenda Crowskin+Mogu Cultist is the new hotness
---
JavaScript. For example, == treats 3 and '3' the same, as well as all falsy values ('', 0, null, undefined, false, maybe i forgot something). === on the other hand also compares types, so 0 == null, but 0 !== null.
---
i get the blood
---
Dude you can’t even get Journey to Ungoro using gold anymore. It’s only in the wild format.
---
He actually says [mercy killing](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lord_Godfrey).     
---
It's not easy to discern, due to his accent, (or maybe his mouth scarf?) but it's definitely mercy.   
---
Here's some clearer [audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=393yGU7BPVE), without the music overlaying it.
---
Lmao I love this!
---
He actually **does** say [mercy killing](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Lord_Godfrey).     
---
This one shouldn't be it doesn't cost zero it has no cost.
---
So what? It's still a spell
---
Don't all spells say "spell" on the bottom the way minions do?
---
Weird. I play almost exclusively on mobile and I get maybe one drop in 10 these days.
---
Yeah that makes sense.

I had 28 health and a big board, and then he mehl mehl nyah nyahs into 2 of the 3 murk-eyes that died that game.
---
I think it’s on the same spectrum as getting the Darkness as a random legendary is always possible, and is an equivalent feels bad card.
---
Cast a random spell THAT COSTS FIVE OR LESS.... It isn't cast a random spell.
---
Tangentially related, but as anyone busted out Naxxramas in the current meta? 
---
It's like cutting through butter with a red hot poker. That meta was not prepared for the game as it is now. Pretty easy dust if you think 700 gold: ~450 dust is a good conversion rate.
