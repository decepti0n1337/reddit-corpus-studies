Oh okay. Yeah business care about money.
---
---
---
I think you need to read the issues. 5 demands not one less. None call for seperation from China. 
---

---
Liberate hong Kong revolution of our times is a slogan for the protestors that have the 5 demands. 
---
He was not calling for Hong Kong to be liberated in the sense you are referring. The demands are as follows:
---
Full withdrawal of the extradition bill
---
A commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality
---
Retracting the classification of protesters as “rioters”
---
Amnesty for arrested protesters
---
Dual universal suffrage, meaning for both the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive
---
Rubio is one of the most pro-HK US politicians out there. He was one of the sponsors for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in the senate.
---
I'm so close to agreeing with you, but I think the context is extremely important here.  The south is not being denied any human rights that the north has.  I think the only comparable situation would be someone saying "Black people need to fight back against cops murdering our brothers and sisters."  Do I think Blizzard would ban someone for saying something like this?  Maybe, but I still believe that a fine is all you would need for first time offenders.
---
I just faced this 3 games in a row, and came here to check if anyone else has been seeing this...
---
You mean like preventing US companies from selling things to Chinese companies? That's already going on with Huawei and with the export ban to companies involved in the Uyghur genocide like Hikvision.
---
Lol you act like a nob get called on it and then cry lolololololol i can tell youre female off that
---
Unlike Trump's letter they is written with proper grammar!
---
His central argument that isn’t concerned about power boils down to Druid quest is “auto complete” which  somehow equates to bad design. I disagreed already. Since OP complains about things like 5 mana double rush 5/5s and how “easy” it is for Druid to complete, he implicitly is also complaining about its power level. 
---
Also all his designs are outright nerfs
---
I know people's hearts are in the right place here, but it's like ever since the first ban was issued the ability to critically think just evaporated off the player base.
---
Blizzard has already allowed people to make political statements at official events long before Blitzchung. See this- https://preview.redd.it/7vtkmn8rh0s31.jpg?width=944&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=838a007f3f2c8bb4789023fc29580bb8f2fc3e06
---
&gt; Considering HK is a part of China 
---
I mean, the British just sort of gave Hong Kong to china. I imagine the people in Alaska wouldn't like being given to Russia all that much.
---
Part of the deal was that Hong Kong would have essentially complete administrative freedom from China, and (of course) China is trying to violate that.
---
Why not take a moment to remind yourself that Twitch is arbitrarily banned in China. So even the people espousing pro-China rhetoric on Twitch or Twitter 
---
Even the idea that people would choose something else over state-controlled media was too much for the government.
---
I understand Twitch wants to avoid spam and it's often a nuisance to see comments that are irrelevant or don't add anything new or nuanced to the discussion by boiling it down to the core idea, but I think that the HK protests are pretty relevant and it's really not everyone's best interests to ignore reality and demand politics be divorced from media.
---
Its literally the same thing. Is acknowledging your existence a political statement? Its a simple yes or no question.
---

---
Shoutout to Dane!.
---
Man you're really sticking it to those CS reps
---
fuck off
---
She might. But most other politicians would not. And I seriously doubt Blizzard would punish them with the same severity as the published Blitzchung.
---
Please educate yourself on the 5 demands. None talk about seperation from China. The slogan doesn't mean what you think it means. 
---
5 demands. Not one less.
---
&gt; Faux outrage over nothing and directed at the wrong party in any case. 
---
Uh blizzard **was** the party that punished this player and caster so idk the logic in saying they are the wrong party.
---
Not only that but if i had a dollar the amount of times people blindly call this or any uproar as "faux outrage" purely because they **personally disagree with it** i'd be a rich man.
---
&gt;Wanting to sell products internationally isn't "objectively greedy."
---
No but appeasing a harsh authoritarian government so you don't lose profits from them banning your game sure as fuck is. So that being said, are you ignoring that fact due to ignorance or because it undermines your argument? curious.
---
&gt;"Submitting to a dictatorship"... give me a fucking break. We're in America.
---
Uh, how does "us being in america" change the disturbing trend among american companies submitting to Chinese censorship? 
---
&gt;They had a rule against controversial speech in their esports events. Someone broke it, in a big fucking way, by literally calling for revolution.
---
Funny how **everyone** who doesn't know much about what happens comes to the same ignorant conclusions.
---
Yes a rule was broken and punishment was need but the extent blizzard punished the player AND the casters was clearly brought on due to fear of them getting banned in china which is the core reason for the outrage. Not only that but the rule was **very** open ended and the fact they took his prize money hardly breeds confidence in the game as an e-sport if that was there first reaction to the situation. 
---
&gt; Guess what, if someone said "liberate Catalan, revolt against Spain" in an esports broadcast that person would probably get banned as well.
---
actual argument &gt; random hypothetical that doesn't mean much because there situation in Spain and china is **MASSIVELY** different. 
---
&gt;Because guess what, it's a fucking esports broadcast, not your soapbox for controversial political statements.
---
Ok? Why are you under the assumption that i think he should have relieved no punishment? That's not even a common opinion which shows just how ill informed you are on this topic you have to attack me with assumptions. 
---
&gt;All of the disingenous shit about how Blizzard is "against human rights" or "against free speech" is all just made to fuel this faux outrage.
---
Blizzard censoring their game to appease china's totalitarian regime **IS** going against human rights and free speech no matter how you slice it so idk why you are arguing a fact with an opinion as if you are going to win. 
---
I suggest you get educated on this situation as opposed to justifying your love of the game by undermining the protest which is quite selfish not gonna lie.
---
&gt;Of course I'm talking about the fucking boycott,
---
then why did you **completely** misrepresent it then? 
---
&gt;Honestly, this is just the worst kind of slacktivism by a bunch of entitled gamers who would never actually make a sacrifice of their own
---
Christ when the fuck will this circle jerk die? Why do you people think blindly calling gamers "entitled" means anything? Why is "voting with ones wallet" a sign for entitlement? Are people **not** allowed to have opinions in your mind or just those who game? 
---
&gt;. a bunch of kids who haven't worked in the real world.
---
Strong basis for an argument.
---
"oh the kids are wrong, not me" 
---
&gt;Go ahead, if you work at a company that does business with China, go and tell your boss you refuse to keep working until they stop doing business with an evil dictatorship.
---
wow this is like the third or so example you have **no idea** what this protest is about. my god. 
---
&gt; If he refuses, then you quit. Or maybe it's all just talk and the actual reality of having trade with China is a lot more complicated than that.
---
Ok can you give me an actual response instead of pure belittlement because that really isn't worth a damn thing and i am tried of reading it from people who think it is trendy to go against the grain.
---
I mean, are you surprised?

I dont get why the "new" missions dont have any kind of activator. But thats another subject.
---
But talking about Druid, is the only mission where you can complete by doing literally nothing; do nothing during 4 turns and get your quest complete (and of course the reward is automathic).
---
Then, the deck has a lot of everything; highroll, healing, removal, draw, ramp, armor generation, card generation.
---
I know that its not the best deck in the meta, but it can be truly annoying to play versus a deck that never runs out of "ammo" and can save a lot of bad situations because of all the possibilities it has.
---
Yes and that's interesting to me

Enjoy the massive amount of spam you will now receive.

While there're more decks that work pretty well and are available, this meta definitely is less enjoyable than the one before the wild cards were added.
---
You're just wrong. Gloop Sprayer, Menagerie Warden, Splitting Image, Blood Warriors, Bloodsworm Mercenary, and Faceless Manipulator all say "copy" not "exact copy" and copy enchantments including 1/1 status. The banana should copy the 1/1 status.
---
I never had an issue with them banning political speech. My issue was that the initial and even reworked ban was grossly disproportionate for what was essentially "bad language", which raised questions of alternate motives.
---
Bruh am I in an alternative universe?

Blitzchung is a coward , he can do that on twitter , on youtube , on HK street , but he choose to do that in HS tournaments , ruin everyone's work.

Absolutely not.  In a democracy, you want the leaders to inspire more than the government to compel.

But see the delusional thought that not unnaturally forcing a political statement into story ruins narratives. It’s annoying to me. You can literally detect that they thought “okay we need to make sure to add in that LGBT people are okay and real people.” As if that’s a ground breaking revolutionary thought. It’s what a NORMAL person believes.
---
Reno was good at the first half of the meta where Highlander mage was top tier pre-nerf. But after that nerf to LPG, Highlander Mage is much weaker now. Reno was a 4-5 star card then but I would say a 3 star card as a card in a tier 2-3 deck.

The League of Explorers is the most useful one for sure. Reno Jackson is still used in Renolock and I believe there are other commons and rares from that set still being used. Loatheb is pretty much an auto-include as I have heard. Emperor Thaurissan is good in combo decks.
---
You in EU or NA?
---
but isn't that the statement Blitzchung said will damage Blizzard no matter what?
---
it's like a contractor publicly supporting a political side (wether it's good or bad) within the companys grounds, especially when that support will affect the company in a huge scale is not that much of a big deal.
---
in other words, we could be racist or anti government (in a bad way) in an interview while under a companys name and should not expect major punishments nor termination.
---
it's good for Blitzchung that his sentence is shortened but in my oppinion, his punishment for forcing Blizzard to pick sides should be perma banned as it damaged the company in a a huge scale no matter what side they pick.

Never disenchant *anything* except nerfed cards unless you have an immediate need for that dust.
---
Either save your gold between expansions so you can spend it all on packs the day new expansions come out *or* invest your gold in Arena while committing to get good at it.
---
Craft decks not cards, and when you do, build decks around the valuable cards you open. When branching out, focus on decks that require you to craft Classic staples or versatile expansion staples.
---
Make sure you have room for special quests or that you have a full quest log leading up to events that increase quest rewards.
---
Leave an Arena run with two losses unfinished before Arena changes to earn the rewards and a free run.
---
Try to fill up your friends list to increase your chances of getting the 80 gold quest.

Don’t take long breaks away from the game.

Nothanks, dont need any more liberal propaganda in my life. But if you actually want some sources:

[Pakistani official touring camps](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/422970-pakistani-diplomat-narrates-visit-to-chinas-xinjiang)
---
&gt;During the visit, we had the opportunity to visit the Xinjiang Islamic Institute, the bazaars, mosques, police stations, economic development, and poverty alleviation projects and vocational education and training centers,” she added.
---
She said the diplomats were given full and open access to the three centers that they visited in Kashgar and Hotan.
---
The training program includes the teaching of national common language (Chinese), law and constitution and vocational skills. The students also participate in recreational activities like sports, music, and dance. The diplomats witnessed several skill classes being offered in these centers.
---
“We had the opportunity to interact with both the management and the students. We observed the students are in good physical health. The living facilities are fairly modern and comfortable with separate dormitories for men and women. They are being served halal food.”
---
To yet another question, she said, “I did not find any instance of forced labor or cultural and religious repression. The imams we met at the mosques and the students and teachers at the Xinjiang Islamic Institute told us that they enjoy freedom in practicing Islam and that the Chinese government extends support for maintenance of mosques all over Xinjiang.
---
I learned that there are over 30,000 mosques all over Xinjiang that form part of the religious life of the people there.”
---
Mumtaz Baloch said similarly she did not see any sign of cultural repression. The Uyghur culture as demonstrated by their language, music, and dance is very much part of the life of the people of Xinjiang.
---
The most visible sign of protection of Uyghur culture by the government is the government-run bilingual kindergarten schools where children learn Putonghua as well as Uyghur language and culture from a very young age.
---
About the measures taken to eliminate terrorism, she said, it was informed that the recent measures have resulted in improvement of the security situation in Xinjiang and there have been no incidents of terrorism in recent months.
---
The counter-terrorism measures being taken are multidimensional and do not simply focus on law enforcement aspects. Education, poverty alleviation and development are key to the counter-terrorism strategy of the Chinese government, she concluded. 
---
Also, the eu was offered a tour of the camps and declined

Welcome to Reddit my friend.
---
Except it's been in every news station I can think of, tons of newspapers. People are aware of the protests and are watching China more vigilantly. That's what the protesters want, people to be watching. See the atrocities. Know what China is doing, etc. Knowledge is power.
---
RIP ogipogo, even though this post is logical and makes sense.  I think you just got hit by a random wave of downvoters.
---
Because political messages, no matter what they are, are not acceptable in an environment in which they aren't wanted. No one is questioning that protesting china is wrong. However, you can't pick and choose what political messages you can and can't allow. You either allow all of them, or not at all. Since Blizzard seems to censor everything that is political from their streams, that is alright as they aren't playing favorites.
---
In LoR you can make 4-5 competetive decks with the resources you are given at the start. HS is way worse.
---
Uh, thanks, maybe? I think?
---
Thanks. Didn't know most of these. That arena two losses thingy is clever.

Does more friends = Higher chance of getting that quest?

I got twig by turn 4 on 3 runs so far. Currently at 5 wins 0 losses XD

It doesn’t increase the chance that *you* will get that quest, but it increases the number of people who can easily invite you to complete the quest with them.
---
YES! I second that!!
---
There was no "other punishments of this type"
---
And also, I see no harm in staying neutral in this situation because 
---
1. It changes nothing, even if Blizzard went up on stage and said they support Hong Kong, it means nothing to the actual cause
---
2. It's a decision that would cost millions of dollars of not only Blizzard, but it's related studios
---
There was a post recently about a dude who grew up in 1990s China, and was saying how big Blizzard games are to them over there, just like they are here, even throwing aside the obvious "hurrdurr companies want money", picking a side would be nothing but a loss for them
---
This was a loss loss situation, plain and simple, it's easy as an individual to go "CCP bad, organ farming, human rights", but they're making decisions that impact literally millions of people in a few moments, on situations they're not equipped to handle

Just like u/[CryptozNewb](https://www.reddit.com/user/CryptozNewb/) stated. They are using the blockchain to store the assets. Therefore, they are blockchain-based!
---
Maybe I'm old-school from a time where accuracy matters, but wouldn't it better to get the facts straight than rush out a letter for the political version of fake internet points?
---
Bro.. There are so many successful and completed blockchain projects out there. They just haven't hit mainstream because they are constantly getting deranked by google and facebook algorithms. Which reduces their visibility
---
depends on your definition of success. For me if it's a game and wants to compete with HS then success means hitting mainstream at least.
---
&gt; Because political messages, no matter what they are, are not acceptable in an environment in which they aren't wanted.
---
Again, I bring up Nazi Germany. Don't even bother comparing them to China if you don't want to, just imagine a situation where Nazi Germany exists _today_ and people are protesting against it. My question is do you still think it would be right for a company to censor that? I think legally of course they're within their rights, but do you not think people have a right to be mad about that? Where is the line drawn?
---
I'll also bring up kneeling at the NFL protests that happened in America last year. Many people said there was a time and a place for those protests, but those players protested for what they believed in when _they_ felt it was necessary, which is important. When you have a cause you truly believe in regarding human rights, you won't let other people tell you where or when you can do it. Imagine if people fighting for black rights in the 60s only did it where they were allowed to. This argument is dumb.
---
&gt;However, you can't pick and choose what political messages you can and can't allow. You either allow all of them, or not at all.
---
As I specifically said in my post, I agree that Blizzard had legal right to do it and I do think it was a smart _business_ decision, but that doesn't mean people don't have a right to get pissed at Blizzard for censoring someone who's showing support for human rights. 
---
&gt;you can't really compare the current China situation to Nazi Germany. Two completely different times in history, and completely different circumstances.
---
Them being different times in history means nothing as far as comparisons go. Why can't you compare two things from different times? I don't understand that. There are certainly different circumstances, but if we're getting to the point where we can't compare a government that literally holds people in camps and is committing genocide to Nazi Germany I think we're failing as a society. Can you explain to me why that comparison isn't fair? Does China have a 'right' to commit genocide that the Germans didn't have? You're just saying I can't compare but you're not actually giving a reason why.
---
&gt; Or are they doing it just to get free internet points?
---
Yes.
---
Notice how politicians, Senators specifically, usually just talk and grandstand instead of actually trying to put forth actual change.
---
There are a few rare ones that legitimately care, but those are the exception, not the rule.
---
This is where everyone who ever agreed or disagreed with me shows up very passionately. Because we're clearly in a good place to discuss these things.
---
Uh, if you have a problem with the way Blizzard shut down conversation about Chinese oppression, you should definitely have a problem with the way Riot is a Chinese company.
---
Apologies, I've been waiting on this site to load up since high school. Dial up's a bitch. in Romania.
---
But those are related to the game... Hong Kong political spam has no place here
---
Twig of the world tree. Rogue hero power. Good luck.
---
Not exactly, for two reasons:
---
(1) Changing the punishment doesn't change that someone influenced Blizzard to feel that the initial punishment was acceptable. What the letter addresses is concerns that Blizzard is still listening to those influences, which Blizzard hasn't addressed at all.
---
(2) There is still a not-insignificant amount of people, some who are probably their constituents, who consider the new punishment (and, more importantly, the wording of the announcement for it) evidence of continued Chinese meddling.
---
None of your points here matter since Blizzard's whole defense was they don't want politics on their gaming platform, despite them using their platform for politics for years.
---
Sure, it's entirely their right to do so, it's just exceptionally hypocritical and makes for a weak argument.
---

I knew the people seemed really mad. I didnt follow it very closely. What was the consensus at the end? Did riot lower the price?
---
I thought it was expensive but I also didnt care too much because according to my understanding it is completely optional like cosmetics(?).
---
I play the game for ~10 years and spent less than $20. I think i got lucky and got 2 ultimate skins from the crafting thing and a lot of good legendary skins. I have no complaints if they sell things that dont affect gameplay at a higher price.
---
True, you have a point. but for most they are indeed working on it. They mostly face chicken and egg issue. Or must wait patiently for results. I have a blockchain startup myself and I am facing that issue. Going mainstream is quite difficult, but extremely well worth it :) I big into blockchain so I give a lot of support to them all
---
It's been 2 packs total for all other events, unless you get lucky and get one of the 1500 packs given out each hour.

It's not that farfetched, at least for her; earlier in the year, AOC and Ted Cruz teamed up to make a bill to ban former legislators from becoming lobbyists for life.

---
Pretty sure they bundled a lot of them together and lowered the price, I didn't really know what happened to them either tbh, I haven't really played League the last few months
---
Good, keep politics out of games.
---
Looks like someone THINKS they learned a new buzzword.
---
Many people here don't play the game anymore for like years (or at least they say so), they just stay (and it isn't just with Blizzard but basically any gaming sub) because their own hypocrisy don't let them leave the game/company they apparently hate. They are those types who keep making hyperbolical sarcastic posts at every single mistake a big company do.
---
Why? I will never understand though.
---
Go face
---
I think HS as a base game would still be better , that's due to the fact that HS set the principles at the beginning of the genre and thus forcing new comers to try to differentiate even if they make inefficient changes. But when it comes to cards , I think the current state of HS cards is absolutely bad . You can easily tell a busted card from a normal or bad card. I don't think this would be the case in LoR because of their limitied number of champions you can add in one deck and the ability to upgrade them , that makes them close in power level in designing. If HS makes QoL upgrades and printed better fair cards and stopped introducing disruptive events , and maybe move to more mature expansion once in a while . it would still be the king.

Right? What's blizzard going to do about it? Instead of wasting your time shit posting in twitch chat do something thats actually going to have at least a small amount of impact
---

I have spent 12k dust on Quest Shaman and Quest Druid last month and I havent regretted it since. Both decks are very enjoyable to play and probably will still be around next year, because they dont lose much after the rotation.

no, the card itself was great in every slow Warlock deck, it's just that the *decks* themselves not really great. a deck being bad is different from a card being bad.
---

Such hostility, the instant someone disagrees with the mob they get mowed down, having a different opinion on blizz? Considering that they have every right to ban people who express their political views on GAMING tournaments? Nah they just gaslighting.

Thats is not to even mention that this does NOT work. Its stupid to even think that a company of the size of Blizzard cannot take on this surge of request. Its not easy for a lot of companies out there, but not to them. The GDPR law in EU is not that well-implemented either. My company managed to have an automated system to response to GDPR in mere weeks after the EU passed the law and even before the law officially took effect.

If Blizzard so want it, they can keep all your requests fermented near the deadline and hire some one to build an automated system in the mean time. Its still a win for them regardless.
---
Sorry I mean ‘another card game’. My bad.
---
Good luck out there mate, but more over good luck on your path to beating depression. 
---
I know life can be severe at times but always know that there is always someone out there who is there for you and ready to help.

Cheers!

know what happened to that bill?
---
Whispers meta was great, the only nzoth decks back then were paladin and warrior iirc. Honestly I feel like nzoth wouldnt even be that great right now without khartut defender.
---
Tell me you enjoy getting matched with control priest
---
You won’t say it, yeah I thought so
---
On showcase, Eternals cost 850 RP for 3 Eternals (only available in a bundle of 3). Eternals were marketed as "champion-based achievement feature that lets you showcase personal accomplishments".
---
Except they sort of weren't. There were maybe 20 unique eternals out of the 432; every other Eternal was bog standard stat tracking already in game. For instance, Evelynn's Eternals were kills with R, kills, and damage dealt to champions. Basically every champion had the most generic R Eternal possible, and then 2 basic stat tracking Eternals for stats already available.
---
Riot ended up changing this. The current plan now is 2 different Eternal sets for each champion: a 590 RP one containing mainly unique Eternals (Evelynn has the generic R kills but also tracks kills within a few seconds of exiting stealth, or full charms on enemy champions) and a 225 RP generic stat track Eternal (also available in the Blue Essence Emporium when it comes). Overall a massive gain.
---
tldr; price lowered, quality increased, generic stat track Eternals for Blue Essence
---
Your math seems a little off. In your first calculation, shouldn't it be (1/32)*(31/32)+(31/32)*(2/32)?
---
And then the second would be (1/32)^2*(31/32)*3?
---
Unless I'm missing something
---
It's not so bizarre in the Trump world.
---
The tjing is, he has such a good controlly deck, that the armor up will actually be useful. So while i have no idea why on earth would anyone ever choose warrior hp in arena, it should be pretty good here
---
No. I Just want you to have a Depressionfree Life. No sarcasm.
---
You are smart for doing this. Addiction is learned and is often itself a consequence of some other disorder or condition. Getting away from the game for a time will let you undo those reinforced neural paths. I found that learning about addiction helped me. If you are interested, I recommend reading The Unbroken Brain by Maia Szalavitz.
---
It is important to treat your depression as well, preferably under professional guidance. Whatever your treatment happens to be, there is no shame in it. Best of luck to you.
---
I've never seen anyone play Crystal Merchant turn one including me and I have 200+ games with quest druid. You won't benefit for 2 turns from it.
---
There's a few problems with that, though; 
---
-EVIL Totem doesn't need any set up, it always generates Lackeys and can always be played on curve for a return, while this card wouldn't, which is a pretty big deal as Totem can snowball while you play removals / Taunts / stall to keep it alive (which Shaman also does better atm) and without needing a constant source of damaged minions and without needing to spend resources on healing minions. Lackeys also are better in early-midgame and so getting Lackeys earlier is a big difference.
---
-Priests lack early-midgame snowball tools like the ones Shaman has, so getting Lackeys isn't as good for the class because they can't take advantage of the tempo and tokens as well as Shaman and their Mogu Fleshshapers, Soul of the Murloc, Bloodlust, etc. Especially since the Extra Arms nerf. 
---
-That does nothing to address that this card is basically Northshire 2.0 with an extra mana, it seems a little too derivative for something Blizzard would print.

&gt; I put a 1 line coment on a post that reminds people freedom for hong Kong, i dont see how thats harassment.
---
&gt;&gt; your not helping them by promoting a game that suports a dictatorship
---
This^ right here is not for you to judge
---
&gt; Firing a competitive player and stealing his prize money is not being neutral
---
You're either misinformed or ignorant. Blitz signed a contract and broke the rules. He used esports as a platform for politics, causing a shitstorm because people get emotional over politics. It clearly said in the contract he signed that they will kick him out of GM and take his prize money if he breaks the rules. 'Stealing' his prize money my ass.
---
Then they reduced the punishment and even gave him his prize money. 
---
Even Blitzchung is over this, saying he was in the wrong and his punishment is fine.
---
&gt; especially since i doubt theyd do the same for someone who suported china.
---
They would. What do you think would they do if some guy in Blitzchung's exact spot said something like: '*Praise China, for the mainland!*'? Do you think they'd clap or something?
---
Unwrapped potential + coin on turn one. Change my mind.
---
agreed, its very hard to say a bunch of these are wrong when a lot of them don't have defined descriptions for star ratings like trump (maybe more of them do than I know, trump's are just discussed a lot so I know they exist)
---
some of these cards getting 2 or 3 star ratings that are in top decks I would agree with being 2 or 3 star cards because they aren't really what makes that deck come together. with so many highlander decks too a lot of cards aren't being played because they are good, but because they are less bad than other options.
---
Communism is defined by a society in which the means of production are publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their ability and means. Communist governments can be totalitarian, which is what you described, but they are not inherently that. China is not communist because China's economy is driven by private businesses. An economy that is driven by private business can not, by the very definition of the word communism, be communist.
---
Ну как есть))

suck a dick chief
---
It's not OP at all. But it's allowed me to finally get some use for Anubisath warbringer. Finished a game with a 18 attack Leeroy just a few minutes ago. Definitely more. Fun than just styling with Nzoth.
---
No memes on this subreddit :v
---
It was an excuse, though, since they have not only allowed but been very vocal on some political issues before.
---
That isn't an answer! Automated processes are implemented by humans.
---
Thank you 😄
---
It’s not a law. Just want you to be informed.
---
That wasn’t Blizzard, it was their Chinese partner, speaking on behalf of the Chinese government, to the Chinese people, on a Chinese platform, *in China*.
---
And frankly, Blitzchung’s statement *was* offensive as far as the Chinese are concerned. It goes completely against the idea of “One China” which they’ve been pushing for the last 50 something years. Keep in mind this is a government which routinely cancels trade negotiations and walks out of international committees which fail to recognize Taiwan as a part of China. You and I might not agree with it, but fact of the matter is that they’re the ones in charge over there, so it’s really not surprising that they’d take offense and reaffirm their message.
---
OK replace owenership with freedom of enterprise/get rich again being pedantic.
---
You read the definition in a book and thats cool but the truth is that every Communist experiment made on earth ended up implementing a totalitarian state with huge state intervention in the economy one way or the other and china is not different in that way.
---
By your definition communism has never been implemented on this planet.
---
&gt; In the late '70's China explicitly and deliberately moved away from a communist economy into a capitalist economy with a series of major economic reforms. They are communist in name only and have been that way for a long time. That's like claiming North Korea is a republic because it calls itself the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
---
Yes we all know china introduced capitalist elements in it's economy but it's still a very planned economy with an oversized state which again are markers of a communist regime.
---
Please let this be forgotten. No this doesn't hurt blizzard at all, and nothing will happen at blizzcon and it will probably be their biggest and best in years because of the new announcements. Also as a business they should have 0 involvement with political stuff and the protests so for Blitzchung to do that he deserved that punishment, the employees might care but that isn't a business and they are still going to get paid as they won't quit. Also its just opinions.
---
Blizzard isnt facing anything, their goal is maximum profit and that means continue to selling games in China. If means nothing if they lose few % of western fans now for their long term goal (and that is maximum profit).
---
Pretty sure I saw some Blizzard dev interview that said in testing it was nerfed from discover a mage spell that costs two less due to what it is now, due to the first iteration being too powerful
---
10 days now since request sent and still awaiting a reply, I even sent them a follow up email to request them to confirm receipt of email and still not reply. 
---
I hope our efforts are giving them a good finger up the ass hole in teaching them a harsh lesson in pissing off their Western consumers.
---
The rate will be about 10x faster then HS and it wont matter if you pay for the cards or play, everyone will be more or less even.
---
Looks like Old Gods footage? Seems like standard and that mage two drop was from old gods expansion.
---
Yup, I've been having the same problem since the event update. Reinstalling the game didn't seem to fix it..
---
Crusdale #2493 EU Ill show and you go first

The rogue deck is a... snacc?
---
Sounds like N'zoth isnt cancer, Togwaggle's scheme and Shadowstep are.
---
Will neoliberal publications write articles about me if I get banned for spamming pro-life messages in a video game stream chat?
---
The question is, why isn't there a rogue deck with the shirvallah+holy wrath+lab recruiter combo?
---
I see a Call to Arms still at cost 4, so probably this footage was between December 2017 to April 2018
---
Hong Kong is a puppet state of white imperialist powers. This whole revolution is propped up by America and Britain for the sake of undermining China's sovereignty. Check your own privilege.
---
Who are you to assume so much?
---
I have the suspicion that to be that cynical and blasé about everything other than your immediate personal gratification, means you live a very protected and compfy life that takes the assets of a free society for granted. But unlike you, I shouldn't be making assumptions.
---
Free speech and democracy is something I deeply care about. Studied constitutional law, served in the army, worked in Africa for many years, having to deal with Chinese racism there that would make the KKK blush. Have taken part in 3rd world pro democracy demonstration and been on the recieving end of police brutality.
---
That's just me. All the others out there have vastly different lives that have formed their desire to make a positive difference. Don't take your life as the benchmark for all others that do care about issues that constitute the foundation of a free society.
---
Tried restarting when it was occurring but it didn’t fix it
---
Been a wild player for years now.  I have to admit, its a little funny seeing these posts about standard.  Rez Priest has been an issue in wild for ages.  The best thing you can do is an 0tk deck, or a deck that focuses on stopping all their momentum, like freezing full boards, or blocking them.  The next best thing is mess up their rez pool.  This is a little more do-able in wild, but there are cards in standard like polymorph, hex, and plague of murlocs that can severely hurt any rez deck.  In wild, the golden deck against rez priest is Cubelock with a doomsayer/treachery combo, you jave an 0tk, and whenever they rez a doomsayer, they wipe their own board.  Currently, something like that isn't possible in standard, but stealing their minions is.  Priest can get up to some shenangins when it comes to Sylvanis and a few other stealing effects, and that also really impacts their winrate.  Other than that, all you can really do is play hyper aggro decks, or a small number of decks that outvalue them.  Hope this helps.
---
SmokedMeat#1801 NA 80g challenge a friend quest trade. I show you go.
---
a version with soulfire and leeroy and none of that magic carpet stuff could be classified as hyper aggro, but most lists are board control "zoo" decks
---
And what popular spell that costs 5 can do this to your evolved board?
---
To be fair to some of these reviews they lived in the drboom and CC prenerf.
---
And I feel a lot of the higher reviewed cards are sleepers mattering the meta. Tho I did think higherland was not going to see much of any standard play
---
Nice
---
And I thought I was cool with an 18/17 Void terror.
---
&gt;How do you get card packs from the old sets like Goblins vs Gnomes, Grand Tournament, etc? Is the only way to get them to buy them with real money now? 
---
Yes
---
&gt;I know you can craft the individual cards, but is there another way to get the packs themselves? 
---
Maybe there'll be an event where Wild packs are given out.
---
After this encounter, this is unfortunately true
---
[deleted]
---
Thanks! Besides, I need to get more of the newer cards now anyway.
---
This reminds me of WoW when monks came out. They have an ability called "Touch of Death" which dealt your maximum health to the enemy, and is only usable when their health is less than yours, acting as a killing blow in most cases.
---
For PvP there was an armor set that allowed it to instantly kill a player that was at 10% or lower health. I put in a ticket as there are achievements related to x number of killing blows in a battleground without a death and it wasn't being awarded. I asked if those ToD kills didn't count for bug reasons. I was simply told that I can't use ToD on players and they closed my ticket. Wankers.
---
Good to see you're moving on. I've had to battle with my own addictions in the past and its really hard. I'm glad your depression isn't as bad.
---
no, its 99%. it checks out.
---
It saw play some time ago in deathrattle decks to activate cubes
---
The difference is that it's more of a choice, than a true addiction. You make the conscious decision to skip school/work for the WoW raid, it can never be on the same level as a drug/alcohol addiction. Skipping that raid doesn't result in physical pain, massive head aches and body cramps, puking your guts up, etc.
---
Yeah some of us just like to play and don't need the world handed to us.
---
That is one of the only good cards priest has in the basic/classic set,  they already took out mind blast, if they kill cleric priest will literally have 0 play rate after rotations, I would agree with the nerf if they reworked the entire priest basic and classic set
---
I was messing around with the malygoose variant for a while it auto wins control match ups / nzoth decks. but it loses so much harder against shaman / Paladin  / aggro decks. and those decks just happen to be the meta for the most part 
---
so it was just normal quest druid
---
Sure, *Blizzard* has, not it's players...
---
Did you beat this person?
---
I can relate man. I don't think I can relate necessarily to the depression. I thought I've been depressed most of my life but I have seem to correlate it to severe boredom. Boredom so unbearable that it makes me fall into self-destructive behaviors if I don't get something extremely exciting and new every single day of my life.
---
This extreme and unbearable boredom has become so intense that hearthstone has been my outlet since naxxramas. I have fallen in and out of it due to phone or computer struggles, but to this day I have a computer and fully functional phone and job. But I don't talk to many people and don't do much with my life. The boredom is so intense that my impulse control goes to the absolute shiter. I end up spending a ton and ton of money on this game because it is one of the funnest things I have ever played in the only  game I've played fairly consistently for 4 years. 
---
I know I need to stop. Somebody should not have to look at their spending history and add up the fact that they have spent thousands of dollars on a card game that isn't even physical... 
---
I've gotten better lately. Other hobbies do help. I can promise you that. So although I cannot relate to you 100%, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe you will find things interesting. Maybe your depression won't stop you from getting involved in things that you know will be healthy for yourself. Although I don't have a strong concept of normal people depression, I still understand what it's like to be that down.. 
---
I hope you find what you are looking for. Hearthstone loves you, and so does the community🤗
---
Golden cards are only aesthetic, worse case scenario you will end up crafting him again, which will cost you the same dust you disenchanted him for, take golden legendaries as a free “legendary of your choice”, if you don’t care about the animation of course, that being said, he makes golden minions too which is nice too lol
---
well atleast we have some support at blizzard.At Jagex if i want to help on my account that isn't ban/mute i have to go twitter/reddit and hope for the best. I have perfect example actually in my hand. At my runescape account is a squashed permanent ban from website advertising from 2010. fine right? wrong, before 14-Jun-2013 this was squashed permanent mute -.- and around 14 Jun 2013 it was reactivated and changed from mute to ban. I have been trying to get hold on their twitter helpers at this to change it back to what it was, a squashed perm mute for a while now, no answers :/
---
This deck was unique and that's exactly what having a rotating core set would do for the game.
---
Honest question, is that boss supposed to be difficult? He's the 7th boss and to me, probably the easiest. Is there some crazy combo he's able to pull if he's given the time to fill his board? What am I missing?
---
#DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?
---
Puzzle Lab. By far the most unique and fun of the adventure modes. People complain about how it has no replayability, but once you beat the other adventures, there's no point in replaying them either. I spent hours on the puzzles and I beat them all without a guide, and i would love Team 5 to try this formula again.
---
As I said above having a rotating core set would be the solution of many problems that hearthstone has, and cleric just exposes this to the next level. But in terms of immediate action we cannot allow priest to just have a way better 1 drop that everyone else. A 1 Mana nerf would be fair , the card would still see play
---
In wild, it’s how warlocks can most effectively do a Mogu Cultist deck. You knock off whatever costs you can with Thaurissan ticks, then:
---
Play Generous Mummy and use Treachery to get it on your opponent’s side.
---
Play Glinda (gives all of your minions Echo) and summon a board full of Mogu Cultists, using a cheap “sacrifice one of your minions” spell on Glinda to free up the last space.
---
Play Drakkari Enchanter to double Ra-Den’s effect... Because let’s face it, just about any deck you manage to survive against long enough to pull the combo off without getting killed yourself is probably sitting at over 20 HP.
---
Zeph looks more like Stephen Fry
---
The issue occurred about a week or so ago. It’s fixed itself now but when it was happening I tried restarting and funny enough each time I did, more basic cards disappeared until they were all gone. It basically stopped me playing any of my decks [cause I’m too lazy to fix them]
---
At least I had brawl to play
---
Normally I would agree, but right now Cleric isn't seeing a whole lot of play. They nerfed Extra Arms a few months ago instead of Cleric, since without it, Priest would actually be the worst class in the game.
---
MtG has a rotating core set, and the same sort of archetypes are typically present in most Standard seasona. 
---
Generally too, you can just say the colors in your deck, and you're opponent will have a very good idea of how your deck works outside of specific situations around specific, unique designs like Fires of Invention.
---
Issue occurred around a week ago, at the time it was occurring I tried restarting but it didn’t fix anything.
---
It fixed itself eventually though.. somehow..
---
Try infinite nzoth druid. Dane is playing it...
---
Or some aggro like evolve shaman.
---
Still needing this
---
My only issue with it was that the original punishment was a bit harsh, but now I see no reason for why it isn't reasonable.
---
If Tirion saw no play? Yeah, it was a bad card
---
and yet he keeps playing the game from a company that is 84% owned by a Chinese company. Shill indeed.
---
I think it was supposed to feed the berserker style decks with Garrosh DK and Rotface but it never took so they abandoned the archetype
---
It wasn't just a reduced ban. They gave him back his money and are allowing him to compete in the next grandmasters season.
---
You could at least be honest and admit you were netdecking JAlexander's deck.
---
Thanks man. Means a lot to me to read this. I really felt disheartened that the front page got back to normal in a few days.
---
then why the fuck doesnt rogue run shirvallah/holy wrath otk??
---
That’s not what a whataboutism is at all. What you did was a whataboutism. 
---
And where did anyone say you have to like it or can’t express your opinion? No shit you can express your opinion. Any other completely obvious things you’d like to state?
---
You clearly don’t understand how important this issue is. If China can influence American businesses then they can influence those businesses to influence our politics and our country.
---
And again you’re basically saying because you don’t care about the issue you think they are pandering or whatever, which is just kind of bullshit and shitty reasoning. As if that’s all they’ve done and have introduced and passed other legislation. You’re ignoring that because you don’t like or agree with this. It’s really fucking dumb.
---
I think totem cruncher is definitely worse than gunspire. I actually got off sick gunspire-volcano synergy as thief rogue once, and just for that I am happy the card exists.
---
Stay strong and keep your head high.

---
AH MAN!!!  What are you going to do with that free 100 gold?
---
fun detected
---
STEALTH PERFECTED
---
Mine said invalid 28/30 or whatever, I’d inspect the deck and it showed I was missing my novice engineers or other basic cards. Upon further investigation all of my basic cards were gone except the golden copies
---
MY CARVING ENDS. YOUR NIGHTMARE BEGINS.
---
its difficult if your deck does not have early game board control.  he can  activate his combo as early as turn 4-5, at which point you're screwed if you dont have a treasure to counter the 20/20.
---
the boss becomes  trivial if you take  early board control, for example with the your minions have rush treasure.
---
so it comes down to your deck construction, either he's extremely easy or extremely hard and unfair and its decided before you even get into the game.
---
I've seen your "re-reviews" and you do dumb stuff like saying you were right about Togg Scheme being a "4 star card" just because HSReplay had it an inflated playrate due to the recent pogo hopper buffs (and ignoring the fact that it had like a 45% wr). So yeah, your re-reviews are about just as accurate as your set reviews.
---
He will laugh reading that letter while wiping his eyes with 100 dollar bills. 
---
Who cares about politicians when you have china money to come.
---
Day9 is a boss. Incoming ban for Lee.
---
Taking a look at this sub, community is growing faster then ever
---
Makes sense. I guess the way I've played has generally been super aggressive and he hasn't been able to stick many minions.
---
That's the only exception, but hot tip, which gets ignored to much: Loatheb
---
Came here for this, why are people still upvoting custom cards on this sub? We literally have one distinctively for that
---
Keep snip lol what kind of question is this? That cards fucking strong lol.
---
Why is MGT clip posted on /r/Heartstone?
---
Because it overtakes chat, it overtakes the content going on, and sometimes there is a time and place, and sometimes it very much is best to not have political, religious, or otherwise divisive discussion when people are trying to enjoy their time and enjoy their life.
---
Blizzards Livestream is not your platform to spout your beliefs.
---
Also as I stated they would have to take a position and allow and disallow specific things, because you know damn well you and others acting like they should allow it wouldn't stand up for the rights of China mainlanders to spam chat about suppressing HK or stopping the "riots" or allow racists to spout their views, it hold up signs, or spam chat or anything like that, you'd want them fined, want them kicked out, and blizzard standing up for their "right" to use them as a platform would be seen as agreeing with their position.
---
So that's why not ...
---
What card do you need for the lich kill?
---
oh I thought I was going crazy when my pc kept lagging with really slow actions.
---
&gt; 1 mana charge kinda sucks
---
I AM IN CHARGE NOW
---
Disagrees
---
Like I said already, because the code of conduct is/was not the same and because xQc didn't say it on Blizz's twitch channel during an official event.
---
Isn't it a bit of an expensive card to duplatransmogrify? How'd that work out, did you have enough non-minion cards to hold out for the 9-mana turn?
---
&gt;I know 99% of people know how to control their addiction but I can't.  
---
Good on you for recognizing this for what it is.  I think you'd find a large portion of the community are in a way addicted to the game and would just deny it.  
---
I probably fit into the addicted portion but I'm aware of it which is yet another reason I won't ever let myself spend money on it.  
---
All the best.
---
Ahh, I'm not doing any of those things either. I won't make further purchases from blizzard, nor ever cared for the NBA. I'm not giving people grief over not changing their purchasing habits, but I personally won't support them unless something significant changes.
---
Plays HS? Go on, outrage monkeys, tell him that he supports China
---
Probably because some people has subbed to both subs and are browsing all subbed subreddits and dont see whetever the post is from r/Hearthstone or r/customhearthstone
---
Pretty sure they don't QC on Android what so ever.  
---
All the QC money went to the PR department I'd think.
---
No deck codes though :(
---
Not sure where the RNG came from. It looks like you just played stone fox statue on 🅱️ncient one and this is the result.
---
&gt;Like I said already, because the code of conduct is/was not the same 
---
What fucking difference between two codes of conducts under the same developer could equate to homophobic insults being a lesser offense than political statements?
---
&gt;and because xQc didn't say it on Blizz's twitch channel during an official event.
---
I've already pointed out to you that this is literally not a factor. They are held to the same standard regardless of platform.
---
Blizzard is the common link between these two cases. One did something ***objectively*** worse than the other and received a lighter punishment.
---
Almost every card atm has some op card. At least cleric let's priest setup for fun combo decks
---
Creative and original post!
---
I still find myself being a bit too neutral when it comes to rating sets myself with 32 threes, 29 twos, 29 fours compared to 23 ones and 22 fives.
---
The top plague decks in wild are Mech Warlock, Paladin, and Hunter. Why can't we just nerf Mechwarper so it can't reduce below 1? Also nerf Kirin Tor Mage and Kabal Lackey so they reduce secrets to 1 cost. Suddenly Wild ranked is actually playable.
---
So what are the requirements for getting a Blizzard technical support job these days? Other than speaking mandarin, obviously.
---
Cronos#1964, NA. I'll show and you go first. (Online now)
---
You're right, one is worse. That one got the lighter punishment from the ruling body that sanctions both events.
---
And for the third time [Team Members and Owners may not use obscene or offensive gestures or profanity in their tags, player handles, game chat, live play communications, lobby chat, shoulder content, interviews, or other public-facing communications of any kind.](https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/news/21568602/) The rule goes out of its way to point out that personal streams are no different than sanctioned events.

---
I once contacted ubisoft support because I wanted to know if I got something from an alpha pack, and they told be that I should send them a proof of what skin I'm missing...
---
“Uhh.. Yeah black ice on ALL guns...”
---
Arena decks. It’s just not feasible to have a board clear THAT expensive, as you’re bound to discard more cards than you can afford. It works great in arena though, because board clears are prime rib, and you usually go into topdeck mode in arena anyways.
---
I do often find that if you are using a legend card back it usually means you just hit legend last season, but after a while I find most people just use the random card back.
---
I'm not wishing death to you dumbass. Read what I wrote: APATHY. I don't care if you die. I'm not telling you to kill yourself, I'm saying that if you did, I wouldn't care.
---
If Legends of Runeterra was open even after this trial period, I woulda ditched HS in a heartbeat. But alas, on Monday they'll end the trials (until mid Nov) so I need a CCG waiting room.
---
But they would still be more interesting than now in that there would be at least some strategy, as opposed to the current arena meta where you just pick cards that buff and are big
---
Depends on what decks you are playing.

For that particular combo, you're likely ahead enough to procc the block and to cancel their gameplan. That would be with tempo or aggro decks, which also benefit from playing Loatheb on 5 to keep ahead, that's a matter of planning ahead. 
---
If you play control, you play for survival, tempo isn't as important, and hands down, unless the mage draws poorly, you're fucked.
---
Just use Hagatha, pick Beat Friend Forever and cast Duplatransmogrifier on it
---
Been having some serious success with murloc shaman, but the prevalence of evolve shaman has shifted the meta heavily towards aggro. 
---
Which means now is the time to build your strongest control deck

If I were to go to any stream and shout "Let's kill Putin", I would be banned. And rightfully so.

Uh what party exactly do you need a citation for?
---
None of what I said is exactly [citation FUCKING needed] or do you not understand how countries use their economic influence to their advantage?
---
I mean you do realize China is vying to be a super power right? And one of the ways they are trying to accomplish that is through economic influence. I mean this isn’t exactly some esoteric fact or well kept secret. It’s not even debatable. Feel free to google it and see articles on it going back years and years.

This is why they need to make anyone who works for the company play at least a little bit of all their games, or offer reference of someone else playing it, in case of stupid answers like this.

Are you just here on the hearthstone subreddit just to get mad at people on the hearthstone subreddit? That’s a bit sad man. You need to channel this energy somewhere a bit more productive

Ok boomer

Look at op's hand and board. There's no Snipsnap. He just pretended to have it. It's literally the point of his post.

There's a difference between a company choosing a political issue to support versus allowing all competitors in their tournament broadcast to vocalize their own political beliefs on stream. I'm not defending Blizzard's actions, but I feel like that comparison misses the point.

Ok, bootlicker. Feel free to go read all the articles I just sent you.

Sorry, I don't get like politics being shoved in my face. Blizzard, evidently, too.
---
Damn I’m a liar.

Man, get it through that thick skull of yours that the rules apply the same in OWL concerning platforms. The infraction xQc broke and HOW he broke it were above and beyond the conduct Blitz did. Keep sidestepping that all you want, it doesn't take away from the fact. Not to mention the OWL CoC doesn't make mention of specific punishment for specific infractions so there's literally no use in pointing out the difference when he could have been (but wasn't) given the same punishment as Blitz. 
---
I'm not cherry picking, I don't even pay attention to Overwatch but that doesn't diminish the point or the facts of the matter. And I ***love*** that you just blatantly ignore the fact that EQO was banned from streaming by his **TEAM**. Not by Blizzard.
---
I browse /r/popular, and this showed up, and of course I'm going to call you shitbags out for being worthless piss drinkers.
---
So no: I didn't search the sub out specifically to talk shit; any other psych 101 bullshit you want to try, chief? 
---
&gt;You need to channel this energy somewhere a bit more productive

Like you? Supporting companies that support a dictatorship that tramples on human rights daily?
