They get packs or gold? I would not know. I was never level 50.
---
&gt; Because I have a chance to remove Lich King one way or another. I don't get a say in "boom you're dead and there is not a single thing you can do to stop it".
---
But so what if you do? You're now at 2 cards in hand, he has 7. Unless you pull a rabbit out from whence the sun dare not shine, you have lost the game. You remove his Lich King and he just plays some other threat a turn or 2 later. Or doesn't, and just incrementally knocks you down. You're never going to get the upper hand ever again because 15 of 30 cards in his deck are removal, and in virtually all cases cost less in cards or mana than what is being removed. Continuing to play puts you in a continually worse and worse position.
---
Like the bolt posts they place weeks before the events?
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you instead of just correcting you. Sorry sir but all packs are equal.
---
Imo it's fine because the card is pretty bad. If this were a competitive card I'd agree it would be horrible but I'm ok with cards with terrible winrates that let you do stupid things, like Astral Communion.

Thanks for the response! To answer your questions:
---
1) Yes, this started with the last patch
---
2) Hearthstone is the only Blizzard / Battle.net product I have in my mobile. PC seems to work well.
---
3) I can get into Battle.net and play Hearthstone normally in my PC. However, in mobile (Android) the same problem persists since the update, and until right now (just tested): it stops at the screen with the Hearthstone logo, and after a while, it goes to a "Closed" error screen with a message about how they're working on the "Good Cheer" card back issue.

You can see the attack in the log.

My friend has a big priest deck and I don't think he runs Barnes. He relies on shadow essence 
---
Too right! 
---
I was one of those peeople.
---
What...what body part is that?
---
Considering the card back issue for mobile I'd say almost none.
---
It's a mixture of factors. Zihi singlehandedly won me one game against Mecha'thun Druid where I saved him till the turn before the OTK, but he is also good against clone priest, for instance, where Zihi delays Psychic Scream or any big minion.  
---
  
---
Houndmaster Shaw is such an amazing card in this deck, especially against aggro where he allows you to dictate trades and control the board. The matchup against aggro is all about taking control of the board with value trades, keeping your health total out of range of damage combos the opponent's deck can pull off, and setting up your own lethal.  
---
Of the two cards you mention I'd say Shaw is more important, but there are other good points about the deck. Currently, people aren't expecting even hunter, and this gives you a small advantage in the mulligan stage. I often am able to bluff the secret I am playing by looking at the board state and figuring out the secret my opponent would believe I would play in that situation. For instance, a few low health minions would die to the Explosive Trap I haven't drawn so I play wandering monster and he won't attack out of fear. Baiting out removal from control decks is important, but what's even more important is realising that *he doesn't have the card I want to play around*.  
---
The deck isn't perfect, but I think that I was able to win games by knowing the decks I'm up against. I've been playing Aggro Odd Mage recently so I know damage combos to play around (Leeroy + ping = 8 damage for 7 mana; Automaton + One Drop + ping = 8 damage for 8 mana).
---
Oh cool, a fucking bandaid for a self inflicted wound.

---
Yes, community opinion on the card was formed with full knowledge of what it did. We underestimated the power level of the bots, thinking that the randomness made them bad. We didn't fully appreciate how much we were getting for 7 mana - a random 1-4 damage, twice, is very good if you're not paying for it.
---
I mean it totally is....becuase it has a tough time against a deck most decks do?
---
by that logic no decks are in standard cuz they all have a weakness...dont be so stubborn my dude
---
thanks for your feedback! let me know if you keep using it any suggestions! but that's exactly why I play it, it just feels fun....its not gimmicks and otk and clear boards till you win, it's just good old fashioned play stuff lol

There is no counterplay to Rexxar. You can't stop him from generating value with his hero power. The closest thing is mindbreaker, but that is gone once he is removed.

I ran it without tirion near the end of its life, and people would just concede after 6 or 7 often enough that it didn't matter. 
---
New nerfs. Hunters mark to 2 and emerald spell stone to 6
---
I normally play wild so I'm not excessively familiar with the standard meta, but this deck gets destroyed by mill or giftlock (the one that makes you discard your stuff), so really any combo breaker style deck would be great against it. Spell hunter struggles because it's secrets don't interrupt the combo, but if you can out aggro the armor gain or play a well timed spellstone you could consistently beat them.
---
If you don't have a way to burn combo pieces or if aggro doesn't work for you then maybe just tech in 1 or 2 Skulking Geists &amp; ply them the turn after they stiffer Hakkar's deathrattle, but before they play Togwaggle.
---

It's not our only win condition. Crowdscorcher's got 7 power and Alexstraza's got 8; we're perfectly fine using them to smash someone's face in if they lack a threatening board.

You don't understand why they made them in the first place. They wanted them to feel like sub-classes. It's like saying that they should nerf class *Eugorddo*. How do you do that? By nerfing cards they play.

I really don't understand how Odd paladin is tier 1 the last month or so, unless it farms hunters.

It's possible that with all the latency I've been experiencing that the arena payment request was sent to the server twice before the client received the receipt for payment for the previous arena run. I'm not familiar enough with how the system handles double payments and I don't remember what my gold reserves are supposed to be at. 
---
Tbh secretkeeper does have those perfect curves.
---
Long control decks are good against it too like control mage and warrior because they love doing nothing during the early game. 
---
Yowzer.
---
I am experiencing this issue as well. Also, for pack openings, I get to use my selected card back, but for games I'm forced to use Hakkar. 
---
The problem with Hunter is the distinct lack of weaknesses. It has the early game curve, tools to win back a lost board, card draw, burn, mid game threats, and DK Rexxar to secure any game that goes to fatigue. Rexxar also gives the deck board clear and health regeneration, not to mention all the extra tools Secret Hunter gets. It lacks disruption, sure, but a deck as lethal as this doesn't need it at all.

They really did a very good job lately with those card backs. This one is awesome, too. I wish there was a random card back function already.
---
[[Skulking Geist]] is generally the most reliable to destroy their Naturalize.
---
But since you are playing spell hunter, the general tip is to try keep your hand size 9+ so they cannot Togwaggle + Naturalize (most likely) instakill you. Although your deck can still get stolen as they can Naturalize then Togwaggle, but then you can just let the Corrupted Blood get milled while building your beasts
---
OTKA Decks are worse than agro.Just sit there ans draw cards and ignore everything until you draw the required cards and just play them and win.How fun and reactive.

Fantastic points but Hunter is losing an absolute fuck-ton on rotation.

DK Rexxar
---

---
Dire Mole and Razormaw
---
I doubt Hunter will be gutted like Priest always is, but the losing Razormaw alone will take out the best curve ever invented, something Hunter's will surely be missing. 
---
Also, just to point out, Hunter wasn't at all existent during the Mean Streets meta. In fact, most of the end-of-year expansions tend to push Hunter out, including KnC and LoE. Hunter being the TOP is actually quite a surprise. I'll be very happy when they're put down to size in April, however. 
---
Ring the bells+radiant elemental/sorcerers apprentice.
---
Problem isn't aggro decks are weak (baku enables so many aggro decks), combo decks just have too many options for dealing with aggro.
---
I did the math and you are right.
---
Sounds like a disconnect. 
---
&gt;  It's one card, in one class.
---
Sadly, that's all it takes. When 30%+ of the meta is hunter kinda makes your, otherwise valid point, invalid. And don't make me wrong I enjoy the aggro vs Control matchup, I must be one of the few that enjoyed the reno vs pirates meta, but that was more how i can handle to survive until reno vs how do I do to kill my oponement before reno, if reno the game ended, thats not the case against beast aggro hunter. If they lose the early game, in the way you are suggesting, they just swap to rexxar on 6 to challenge mid game and then they have a bomb in 10 with zuljin to challenge lategame. Beast hunter IS aggro, doesn't feel like it 'cause they trow rexxar and zuljin on it.If rexxar suddenly were odd, thanks god is not, I would have no doubt that they would include it, because it allows you to win against control by himself sometimes.
---
Uther, hmm. Without the burst damage, the deck has no way to win. As far as I know, that's not what a control deck is. 
---
Odd warrior....that class that win games doing nothing then.
---
Mojomaster Zihi
---
I think we come to conclusion that otk beats control, aggro beats otk and control beats aggro. U are usually winning against aggro decks with control priest without mind blast. Mind blastd are there to have win con against warlock and clone priest
---
I can meet you on half way and call it semi control semi combo deck
---

---
Minion combat? Let‚Äôs just all play aggro then 
---
No. I think some cardbacks should be a part of hearthstone history, like mounts in WoW
---
◊ö◊§
---
The problem is that people who complain about aggro are control fags who don't want either aggro or combo.
---
They just want control to dominate over everything and they're fine in control warlock mirrors or control warriors for 4 months straight.
---
You are NOT safe now
---
I started the turn with 2 hp and 1 elemental on board
---
At least, against freeze mage you could include tech cards to remove doomsayers and secrets.
---
Here you can't do jack shit
---
Mech Shaman... I haven't tried that since before Powermace rotated out.
---
It looks quite similar to a Tempo-Shudderwock deck I am running, but I am curious if you think there are enough Battlecries for Shudderwock to be useful. Fungalmancer and Giggling are the only minions that really make a lot of sense.
---
So I‚Äôve been playing on and off since Un‚ÄôGoro, but as a F2P my current decks are limited to Baku decks (like rogue, paladin, even includes Elemental Mage) and a OTK Rogue Maly. I figure all my gold should go towards opening classic packs until I complete the set, or should I start saving it for the next expansion which will be around for 2 whole years? Even if it takes forever, I‚Äôm sure classic cards will be nerfed or put in the hall of fame which will increase my dust gain. I‚Äôm terrible at arena but I don‚Äôt think I like it enough anyways to get better.
---
The problem begins when control has no or minimum advantage against agro and auto conceed against OTK. Thats how I feel recenty.  Also OTK in current meta has so much card draw and is able to complete combo faster than control needs to stabalize - therefore is  not in worse position against agro than control is.  And that is not great. 
---
But then there would be no synergy between the priest spirit- and loa? I think it fits quite well, especially considering who Bwonsamdi is lore-wise.
---
Odd pally has a huge problem against control. You can put early taunts in like the 2 mana gnome or tar creeper. Alongside a silence for the frostwolf warlord the game is pretty much over. Aggro is only on the rise because they are the only counters to the otk decks. The otk decks keep out control off the meta,and that's the real problem, because as straight odd warrior you stand barely no chance against mechathun or hakkar or gallery priest. It's a card game, there always bad match ups. Countering odd pally is pretty easy. The real problem is, you barely instantly loose to every otk deck witch too much defensive cards. 
---
option numer 2
---
Thanks for the feedback. My thought process with the hagatha board clear is that it can be a blowout card in some match ups where all you need is a board clear and some value against decks such as midrange hunter or odd Paladin. 
---
Giggling inventor was with the shuderwock and had some mechs with divine shield other then blocking my face it helps when I play shudderwock. 
---
I think I will cut Lumi it does often end up being a useless 1 drop the idea was the galvanizer reducing the cost of it to 0 for board swings in early turns  thanks for the feedback. 
---
OwO
---
I love the current meta. The best HS I've played since K&amp;C.
---
I mean, it can be improved by nerfing combo as well, so we are playing in eternal control mirror paradise, but oh well, can't get all.
---
Noice
---
&gt; Now making it fun for both players?
---
That's the job of the devs, if they designed a game where the most winning line is for everyone to play misery-inducing uninteractive decks then no-one else can really be blamed for those decks getting played.
---
I read you could use something called heartharena which basically tells you what to play. I've heard it's successful too, but I don't know how it is these days?
---
I mean changing the text since it is inconsistent with skulking geist, who only affects native 1-cost cards and is written in the "1-cost" format same as bwonsomdi. Hemmet jungle hunter on the other hand uses the Cost (3) or less format and effects discounted cards.
---
It will help u draft a deck for sure, ite good
---
But u play the games urself (thankfully)
---
There's definitely a design philosophy at Blizzard where you have all the regular one-for-one and two-for-one trade type cards, and then you hit 9 and 10 mana and you're expected to start playing legendaries like Zul'Jin that generate massive card advantage and swing the board - at least until your opponent plays their equally ludicrous legendary and swings it back again.
---
+1
---
i think it's better to name the odd mage as something like aggro odd mage cause most people may skip it over the name. it has a very different play style compared to the "normal" odd mage.
---
that mechathun druid is so nasty btw. i hope it doesn't become popular but i prefer playing against it compared to the older druid decks. at least this one is very fast.

Exploit the fact that the type of hunter you described has and that is zero tech cards in his deck

you're really exaggerating if you think that insane ramp cards "slightly complement" a 10-cost card, it's what made the card work and now that druid's evergreen ramp cards are more balanced UI is pretty meh.

And on top of all of that if spreading plague was never printed druid never would've gotten beyond tier 2 in the past two years, that card is by far the strongest card the deck had besides prenerf innervate.

Dont be silly, it's not classic so it doesnt need to be nerfed
---
r/flamewanker
---
Very small play rate compared to other decks and has been hovering Tier 1-2 because of it‚Äôs use in the higher ranks sparingly as a counter deck.
---
As someone who has all the seasonal card backs I wouldn't mind it at all if they were available again. There's basically zero bragin rights attached to them and it adds that tiny bit of personalized self expression to your deck.
---
I really miss midrange decks. I think of fun ideas for them all the time, start making the decks and then realise it will lose 100% of its games since everything is aggro or OTK.
---
Playing Blue
---
I bet you hate fun too /s
---
* cost increased by the number of times you have used your hero power and the cards remaining in your deck
---
And the funny thing is, it's impossible.  If only control decks are viable, then slowly they will strip out all of their anti-aggro tools until it is just impossibly greedy decks grinding out as much value as possible, at which point Timmy will come in with his deck full of 30 Bloodfen Raptors and win.
---
Mecha‚Äòthun decks are the definition of Solitairestone I hope they don‚Äôt get too popular 
---
Or y'know Blizzard could have just not made UI that good?
---
yup, everyone else loves not being able to play any minions to not heal the enemy to full 
---
Most annoying thing is when you play around it then they drop a 1 health minion and clear your whole board. Or like what happened today is (I play secret paladin), i had everything divine shielded from 3 cost sword - he dropped double defile on turn 4 and completely cleared by board. Oh yeah then he dropped 2 giants the next to turns. Fun and interactive gameplay.
---
Actually Genn And Baku will probably get stronger once all the strong cards from Ungoro, KOFT, and KNC rotate out. I think the existing Odd/Even decks will  weather the rotation a lot better than archetypes and decks that depend on Death Knights for instance. I mean Odd paladin already uses some garbage Classic cards because being able to summon two 1/1's for 2 mana every turn is so powerful.
---
Firebat and Zalae was high on Supercollider fkr Odd Warrior.
---
Yes, this also works and it is shorter. However, I'm keeping mine like this for the sake of readability and also the fact it is just a quickly made fake bit of code for a reddit comment.
---
Or when you play jank nonsense like Egg Druid and get your board and all the deathrattles completely wiped by a 2-mana card. :D
---
Mage lost a lot of there agro after nerfing mana wrym 
---
Except hearthstone is a CCG, collecting plays a major part in HS.
---
So much of this rant seems meaningless, pointless and just cries about the extreme-POTENTIAL-value cards. Personally i kind of like it more than i did vanilla, played since beta, and I don't really like that if you get bad luck in one turn it will 100% be felt the remaining game. That is just bad gameplay to me, something alliviated with more draw cards, more controlled random cards etc. OP cards are obviously OP and should be nerfed as usual.
---
Odd Warrior is why we need OTKs to stay.
---
I don't mind them, I like having a counter to bigspell mage/odd warrior/control paladin. Although I havent seen a single control otk paladin since the equality nerf
---

RiP.c√∂ass identity
---
I've played the game since release and I have a great memory, but I don't see how relevant that would be because - as stated in the previous post - I'm not using my memory, I'm using HS data tracking websites.
---
Why don't you go take a look for yourself, instead of talking out of your ass?
---
I'm not sure in what other ways I can explain this more clearly, but I'll try again: *The day before the spellstone expansion there was ZERO hunter secret being played on ladder*
---
The ONLY hunter deck that was played (more than 0.01%, anyway) was midrange hunter with 0 secret.
---
Yes, I am right, because I'm using facts. Easily verifiable facts. But I suppose all data tracking websites also have bad memory?
---
molten?

---
YOU FACE JARAXXUS, EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION
---
I agree with your assessment and see OPs assumptions parroted frequently. 
---
I think that very few players have the goal of collecting all the cards from every set. I personally don't care, I just want to be able to have 1-2 competitive decks per expansion. 
---
She and the other dragon aspects became mortal in Cataclysm, she died in Legion but her soul is still within the emerald dream.
---
Is *What's the flight plan?* actually worth running in Mech Hunter? I figured that it would be slightly too clunky at it's cost and a bit too reliant on buffs. Seems win more to me, but I don't play or see Mech Hunter to begin with.
---
I don't feel bad about giving people the benefit of the doubt.  There's a lot of people coming from magic with blue superiority complex.
---
yea you could make it, gain 5 armor,deal 5 damage to face!,  get an 8/8! and 3 cards,
---
it's just the 5 card draw that is insane since they should have known people would use choice cards to ramp only after that.
---
#welcometohearthstone
---
But that suggests that Aggro in Magic is braindead, or that you're superior because you play Blue.
---
That doesn't earn you benefit of the doubt in my mind. It just means you're still an overly judgemental numpty and that carried over.
---
If one archetype has no real counter the meta goes to shit.  
---
In a healthy meta, aggro is strong so people play control, and then since control is strong people play combo decks, and then since combo decks are strong people play aggro decks.  Each deck is doing it's job to keep play rates somewhat even. 
---
Right now, aggro isn't strong enough to stop combo decks so combo decks have a decent win rate against aggro and a great win rate against control.  Thus you get OTK decks everywhere. 
---
The problem is that you need 10ana cards to do that. If I can remove your 10 mana cost card for 3-5 mana then play another card that turn I have a huge advantage over you. 10 mana cards need to have an immediate impact to game state or win you the game outright the next turn or it's a bad card. 
---
It wasn't full on healadin... It was a prelate deck with some healing and not even equality or timeout
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but I wouldn‚Äôt dare allow myself to look back on pirate warrior with rose tinted glasses. Tread carefully friend.
---
It's just that control isnt doing too well outside of warrior and some expensive warlock lists
---
s that get obliterated by the rotation, most of the cards in midrange hunter are common, with some rares and epics, and deathstalker rexxar, the thing is that control decks get destroyed by combo decks, that are present in the meta, and ppl use aggro to counter it
---
The question I guess is...why does it matter? If I now im dead it just sorta saves everyone time? I typically don't concede immediately just because things aren't going my way. But if I am guaranteed dead next turn i'll concede. I mean it saves both of us time?
---
Protect The King was indeed terrible, but that's because Warrior already had (and still has) a lot of anti-aggro tools in the form of 1 damage to all minion clears, which has the purest form of antisynergy with Protect The King.
---
Also, for 2 more mana you get +4 health on every minion you summon... all the difference in the world.
---
I'm a long time druid player. I just always loved the theme of the class.
---
Druid stopped being fun for me right around KFT. In almost 4 years of playing Hearthstone, 2 of those years consisted of playing no other classes other than Druid. I'm approaching 4k wins with the class, and have hit legend with Druid once in standard and wild. I can't stomach to play the class hardly on the past year though. 
---
I didnt want UI, Plague or Paths. I want my favorite class to still feel the same. I miss playing druid, but the class is a shell of its former self and that is sad for me. I'll never be able to play my class the way I loved to in the past. I play a lot of wild, but will never be able to enjoy my favorite class the way i did in 2015, 2016 or 2017. You can still play pirate warrior, mid range shaman, freeze mage, handlock, and secret paladin. But ill never be able to play any of my favorite decks from the past. 
---
Exactly, and its insane to me that Cloning Gallery Priest often doesn't have a play until turn 5 or 6, and yet there are no decks out there right now fast enough to make that a handicap. That's ridiculous. 
---
Gahhhh always too slow
---
So the problem is that healing exists?  Never thought I‚Äôd see he day where people got upset over aggro having bad matchups.
---
Zoolock
---
New players arent typically grinding to Legend tho. Most players never see Legend. I've been playing since launch and my highest rank iirc is like 13.
---
I mostly play in the bathroom or during commutes when I'm not driving, so I just dont have the time to dedicate to grinding up.
---
I still dont have every rare from the Basic set, I dont think. Certainly not every epic or Legend. I spend maybe $100 on HS annually so I'm not hardcore f2p guy either.
---
This sub has *very* different standards from the overwhelming playerbase, I'd imagine.
---
You can't draw those conclusions. 
---
1. This is very subjective. Compared to other card games? Definitely not.
---
2. You only look at expansions from that year. For players who have played for longer the game gets cheaper over time as you also have previous year's expansions and the core set.
---
3. Ditto.
---
4. Not sure I'd call it loyalty, rather Blizzard trying to retain playerbase, but I guess you're right on this one.
---
Taking the other conclusions together: Not getting a full collection is not the same as the game being unfriendly to its players. You only need a fraction of the cards to fully participate. Not only that, but you're completing ignoring the biggest source of free resources: Arena. The game could definitely serve being cheaper, in particular for the paying customer as monetary value is ridiculously low, but having a full collection simply isn't anything to go by.
---
I don't think Hearthstone is designed for "maining the class". Druid was one of the strongest classes for a very long time, and now it's one of the worst ones. I'm sure other classes have experienced the same ups and downs throughout Hearthstone's hustory. It's just how it is. And you can easily avoid that by dropping that *main* mentality.
---
you know what they could do, but it would destroy otk's like mechathun and other cards that rely on 1 mana spells is making a sideboard option where you select 3 normal cards during deck construction and you select 3 tech cards and in the beginning of the game they ask use cards or use sideboard?
---
OMG it just dawned on me that geist is gone in april, ha mojomaster will be the topcrafted legendary
---
I prefer playing against OTK. I play a lot of meme decks that are totally bad, or are snowballing on turn 5+.
---
But loosing before anything can happen makes me stop playing.
---
Against OTK decks, i have a 50/50, depending on my draw. So that's not bad at all.
---
But just reacting and trying to stay alive isn't fun at all, unless you play heavy armour/heal and your opponent is out of cards in his hand. Then it feels really good
---
Dean talked about them brainstorming additional progression systems internally. 
---
Even though I dont necessarily find this applicable, it's very cool to see and I appreciate the immense amount of effort you must have put in.
---
This suggests it has any value at all to begin with.
---
The only value it has is those who have it (of which I am one, just to be clear) being able to feel superior to others based on the mostly arbitrary fact that they started playing HearthStone earlier.
---
Personally, I'd rather my fellow HearthBros have access to the cool cardbacks they want, rather than the almost meaningless sense of "superiority" owning the card currently gives me.
---
Def. not just you, I actually find Jaina the most annoying because it's very difficult sometimes to NOT have a 1 health minion, not to mention they can make their own minions go to 1 health with some calculated trades and ping their own. 
---
Rexxar is annoying but the "return on investment" from the hero power is less immediate because typically the zombeasts aren't cheap but the constant lifesteal from the elementals does get old. I can't wait till the deathknights rotate out (Despite being a neat concept).
---
Honestly if the power level was closer to say the Warrior or Shaman DK it wouldn't be so bad (Strong but not insane).
---
Even paladin is by any reasonable definition midrange.
---
Even warlock is also pretty damn midrange.
---
I'd say Even Shaman too but that class doesn't exist anymore.
---
Way past 477
---
&gt;I learned to craft staple neutrals for a variety of decks. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Lich King/Leeroy/Keleseth/Baku
---
&gt;I opened Rhokdelar and crafted DK Rexxar. It's been a lot of fun.
---
Quick and dirty f2p guide:
---
* Do your daily quests. Anything less than 60 flip.
---
* Don't craft class legendaries/epics unless they are absolute Staples for that class and you plan on playing that class a lot
---
* Do weekly brawls
---
* Try to hit at least rank 5 every month 
---
* Don't dust anything unless it's HoF'd or nerfed. I got nearly 3k gold from last round of nerfs for example
---
That's about all it takes. Been doing this for 4+ years now. 
---
I kept asking for it to be nerfed over and over. I really don't understand blizz nerfing certain broken cards 3 to 6 months after release, but leaving others untouched. Or looking at an op class and nerfing the classic set instead of a card that was op a year ago.
---
Yes i have to agree with you on that
---
If they change the cost it opens up keleseth
---
doesnt work with spellstone either
---
Change Secretkeeper to "whenever YOU play a secret"
---
Those poor dragons on Gromm and Mogor's cards.  Why would you not protect their identity?  Do you even care, you monster?
---
They're listening to us. That's why stuff gets nerfed.
---
The meta before all of this years nerfs was a lot better, but people were salty about losing to good decks so they wanted them hit.
---
Mostly people hate losing games, and any meta where their winrate is less than 70% will cause them to whinge aggressively about whatever decks beat their own. 
---
I played vanish and after that elven minstrel.
---
It was yellow like every combo card if the effect trigfer but i did not draw cards....
---
Happens twive in one game 
---
You pretty much hit the nail on the head. I have fun playing around defile. I do not have fun "playing around" Rexxar.
---
Hmmm /u/slizzle466hs I think you have a new goal now for stream
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aodbcc/this\_meta\_shows\_why\_aggro\_is\_important/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aodbcc/this_meta_shows_why_aggro_is_important/)
---
zuljin is much more of a UI card than dsrexxar. zuljin can swing/end a game in one turn. rexxar takes an accumulation of fucked up zombeasts to turn the tide. but i guess the sense that it does so pretty reliably, does make it a UI type card.
---
This is why patron meta was my favorite meta: Overpowered combination of cards that was extremely interesting to play due to the skill cap of it with decision making.
---
That's largely because cards like Mass Hysteria and Psychic Scream punish any kind of board presence. 
---
Pyschic Scream in particular just "resets the game" when they play it and they can play 2 (or 3) of them if they need to.
---
It also doesn‚Äôt work with that 4 mana 3/4 that Paladin got! 
---
The one that puts secrets in play battlecry and deathrattle. Makes my secret Paladin deck sad but it‚Äôs still actually a good deck. 
---
The official explanation is that "play" on Masked Contender does not actually mean "play"; it means "put a secret into play" a la Mad Scientist. They just didn't have room for that text on the card, apparently.
---
Also, this has been talked about to death since before Masked Contender was released
---
Prolly like 10% and 30% want the heroes that are unavailable such as khadgar and tyrande 
---
I said this as soon as it was made. Don't nerf it, seriously remove the damn card.  Was a terrible game design ideas. 
---
"Live to turn 4 with ramp, gain 35 life minimum" 
---
Classic Control Warrior ran a similar TTK combo using Alexstrasza and Grommash. No one debated whether or not that was a Control deck.
---
I mean lightning storm is still spending 5 mana of tempo so....would that really seem fair?
---
I think that your point about UI is well taken. In a class without ramp, it would have been fine. 
---
Not necessarily. If no archetype has a counter and all matchups are fairly even (40-60 as a 'polarized' match, instead of 10-90), then you don't need that kind of rps nonsense.
---
In older expansions I had game against control as aggro, and I had game against aggro as freeze mage. All of this hyper-polarized stuff where your matchup determines whether you win or lose honestly seemed to start around the Razakus nerf.
---
You can totally have a meta where Control is 50/50 against both aggro and combo without forcing one deck to hard counter another. You just have to not print crap like Odd Warrior and Mechathun.
---
In Aggro rogue, what can i replace Myra's and Greenskin with?
---
Yeah too much stuff flying around, cards coming back to your hand, back into the deck, all the combo triggers - not for me.
---
i started going back to master oaken heart taunt druid because i realized none of the decks aside from tempo mage can actually beat it if I drew what I needed to drew.
---
Im even playing nerfed wild growth and nourish because spreading plague is hilarious and the meta memory is so small paladin players are forgetting the card exist and play into 7 minions turn 5 a lot again.
---
But agreed, Only reason I win is because i can hit master oaken heart turn 7 and barf out 30/30 worth of stats.
---
The problem with cube is that even in a world where you can‚Äôt activate it right away it still makes a scenario that feels bad to play. Take cube in arena as an example. Cube is either awful because it destroys your own minion and gets silenced somehow or the value doesn‚Äôt matter. Or you‚Äôre in a value game and suddenly it breaks the traditional value model of hearthstone and suddenly an almost dead sleepy drake is 2 full health ones. What can I do when that happens to me? I either have a specific card or don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no efficient trading or skill expression from me that matters anymore. The result is a card that almost always feels bad for both players because their decisions no longer matter.
---
YOU ARE RIGHT. The people who have replied to you don't get it.
---
The reason Secretkeeper has "whenever a secret is played" rather than "whenever you play a secret" is that her effect triggers when your opponent plays a secret too. These sort of effects only trigger when a card is played from hand, and never when minions or spells cast. The clear wording is "Whenever a player plays a secret" but that's too long.
---
Did you have any minions left in your deck? That might be the issue
---
Pirate warrior was a horrible deck... Blizz had already lost control of the game back then... Just as toxic as today.
---
I feel your forget an important distinction when comparing cards.
---
For all intents and purposes Defile is a reactive card. It's really strong vs certain classes (read: board centric/odd pally), and near useless against other decks. Keeping that in mind when comparing it to other "auto-include" cards such as Hunter Spellstone, Wild Growth/Nourish or UI, cards that have the highest winrate across the board vs. ANY opponent. 
---
Thats the problematic cards IMHO.
---
Upvoted for the safe identities 
---
Then why does it trigger rat trap?
---
This is probably unpopular opinion, but it would be nice if there was a way to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the cardbacks you didn‚Äôt want to a marketplace. Players that claim to not care about them could list theirs for dust/gold and those that do could ‚Äúpay‚Äù for them. Giving them a market value would add to the F2P aspect for some players and let whales buy whatever they wanted. Like maybe the going rate for Season 1 Cardback is 2000 gold,  but Season 51 is 130. You could also stock up on them for an ‚Äúinvestment.‚Äù
---
Ultimate Infestation is not random enough to represent *everything* that went wrong in hearthstone.
---
[going on a sleigh ride](https://youtu.be/IcwBCdMW2iM) 
---
Per the wiki:
---
Overkill is an ability that activates whenever a card with the keyword deals damage to a character with less Health than the damage dealt **during your turn. **It was introduced in the Rastakhan's Rumble expansion.
---
It isn‚Äôt their turn so they would not get the 5/5. 
---
I mean I enjoy bashing team 5 as much as the next guy but you're saying this while they're nerfing cards faster and more frequently and during an event where they're giving out 60-100 dust per day.
---
*Maybe* they genuinely thought UI wasn't a problem?
---
Cube is an awful card. It makes one player feel horrible whenever it's played because it either doesn't do anything, there's nothing you could do to stop it, or is a mandatory silence/transform.    
---
Created high/low roll situations with Bloodreaver RNG summoning 5 Doomguards or only Void Walkers. Got a few cards nerfed by itself.
---
It completely shattered their long established weakness to swarming boards and fast pressure. Take away the taunt and I could agree with you
---
I hear this as a variantion on ‚Äúduck duck goose‚Äù.
---
Both Charged Devilsaur and Shaw placed within the top 20:
---
* Charged Devilsaur: 2.6% (#12) | 82.1% wr
---
* Houndmaster Shaw: 2.3% (#13) | 68.2% wr
---
Swamp King Dread placed dead last in #80 (we only counted cards eaten by cube at least 1,000x), but as expected with a high winrate of 75.8%.
---
I started playing in September last year and the first deck I made that was good was a budget Taunt Druid. I only had Spreading Plague out of all the OP cards and just that one card was able to win me games on its own. But it isn't worth it anymore because you can no longer ramp and get an early defense. Druid's ramp was the only thing that could give him an advantage over the opponent (aside armor). Also ramping made him a good class for the beginners to play and improve. But it all fell down. Even the OP Nourish Wild Growth combo was consistent in 20% of the cases. And now Druid's class identity is gone and he turned into a plain tempo class and a solitaire OTK class
---
I'll take that as a compliment
---
UNPLAYABLE
---
God forbid they don't just use abbreviations, and maybe have it say as you hover over it what it means.
---
PfH and PfD are two different and not confusing abrev they could use
---
Pics or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
We still have Midrange. It's just Soo slow it doesn't effect the meta much.
---
Even Paladin, Even Shaman, Deathrattle Hunter, Midrange Beast Hunter, most Elemental decks.
---
The problem is that Midrange lacks aggressive tools as well. Midrange used to identify that the opponent is running combo and go for fast damage. But Midrange decks now are relying on slow cube shenanigans and hero powers. This let's combo focus on draw early then hold out for 10 Mana.
---
Old Midrange won by turn 8-9. Now it's turn 11-12. That's to slow for combo decks that can load up with stall so easily.
---
&gt;I'd argue that it single handedly made jade druid overpowered since jade was already an established archetype before its release and it wasn't nearly as viable (barely broke 50% winrate but had explosive games so people thought it's more oppressive than it actually was)
---
This discounts a lot of what you said, because at no point jade druid ever made even tier 1, let alone some imaginary tier 0 some people still pretend it was.
---
Kazakus priest and mage both shat on Jade druid and anything else.  And later came infinitely more powerful decks like Machine Gun priest and unnerfed Cube Warlock- now THOSE were absolutely broken cancer.
---
This post is the most honest approach to the problem for hearthstone I‚Äôve seen so far.  I absolutely agree that the design aspect of the latest expansions starting with KoFT completely changed the game and not for the better.  These days it seems Team 5 just makes ridiculously powerful cards in hopes of drawing in players who are eager to pull off cool alternative win conditions.  There‚Äôs business to be made from hyping new expansions and showing off the latest powerful effects.  The mindset is that later on blizzard can just go back and nerf cards‚Äî an occurence that‚Äôs being increasingly common.  In essence hearthstone feels like an elaborate game of rock pape scissors.
---
Does that Mana crystal slot retain after being used?
---
On the part of Blizzard/Hearthstone, yes. This isn't a draft exercise. It's an exercise in how well you can roll 20s against an opponent not only using weighted dice, but using a higher die number. It's draft vs. constructed.
---
I left hearthstone about a year ago for Eternal. Looking back, the difference between using cards to increase mana and Hearthstone‚Äôs automatic one-mana-per-turn is that high-cost cards in other games is drastic. In MTG or Eternal, cost is a function of both virtual card advantage (as more mana producers mean fewer threats) and tempo. That makes each additional point of cost almost exponentially greater, especially once you pass the point most decks would draw in a normal game. With Hearthstone, it is just another form of tempo. This is a hard cap on how much more powerful a high cost Hearthstone card can be without breaking the game. 
---
Their 1drop-2drop curve alone is better than any other class in the game, not to mention Rexxar providing them with board clear, value, and sustain all at once. Did you forget about spellstone?
---
I did. Several times. 
---
Yeah, but that was literally theonly card anyone had an issue with. The rest of the set barely saw play.
---
Under the current system, my golden millhouse is worth 1 legend. Under yours its worthless. Under the current system, even the most packfiller common is 5 dust. Under your system, it is now actively worthless
---
Yes, it‚Äôs true. From time to time, when I‚Äôm playing in the train, when I‚Äôm just arriving at my stop, I just lock the phone! 
---
But realistically, you can pick [[Scepter of Summoning]] all you want, RNG can still mean that you get little to no ‚Äúbig‚Äù cards, and at that point you‚Äôll have wasted potentially two buckets trying to get something for the scepter and have to reroute. 
---
Ultimately it does fall on the player to build a deck that can have multiple synergies, but if you want to go whole hog on the scepter you have to be screwing your curve up hard in hopes you might get the best chance your class has at winning. Even then, a boss will highroll something and just get a bunch of minions to stick and you don‚Äôt draw removal (looking at the passive +2/+2 boss that comes around when you‚Äôve drafted garbage early game). 
---
Point being here, yes the player has to plan ahead, but to say the RNG doesn‚Äôt come into play rather often on 6/7/8 is not really truthful.
---
Nope. I maybe forfeited a dozen times when the artifact or buckets were terrible in the first few bosses.

Thanks for the tip. That was very informative 
---
So there is a spell damage shifter card that I use to use in my mage deck. The card wouldn‚Äôt shift every turn, it was random. More like varying anywhere from 1-4 turns. I think something similar to this would be a decent nerf to these two cards. 
---
But when you coin it says 10/9 not 10/10. There's the difference.
---
Dota 2 is the more free to play you can get.
---
From day 1 you have acess to everything, all heroes and content.
---
*laughs in Quest Priest*
---
A lot of people play on mobile and when they have a few free minutes (read: on the toilet). Things come up, they can‚Äôt finish out the match. It happened to me yesterday. Super stopped by unexpectedly to fix the microwave, had to drop everything to let him in. Different than when I would concede (usually when I see a start of game or quest card, or a deck I‚Äôm unprepared for, and I know I‚Äôm abouy to have a rough time). 
---
But it's also super unfun having to watch your opponent do his fun stuff and there's nothing you can do to stop it. The lack of counterplay options is what gets me. 
---
Joust sucked soooo bad 
---
Well no because skins and other play modes count as content and those aren‚Äôt free. You can also do some other things in ranked that require you to pay as well 
---
To some extent, weapon destruction tech also helps, but Cubelock is a deck with a rather inconsistent early game. Quite often you should be find yourself able to just steamroll them before they start going off.
---
None of this is broken, or even oppressive, it‚Äôs just class identity. All the math supports the assertion that hunter is in a good spot this meta, but doing nothing oppressive except showing up a lot, and even this is accounted for by two main things: 
---
1) Hunter has a bunch of significantly different decks atm; and
---
2) Hunter has Tier 1 &amp; 2 decks that only run 1 or 2 legendaries right now, they‚Äôre quite cost effective 
---
Nobody ever cares about the poor little legendary frame dragon.
---
Obviously you have to be a trained lawyer to understand how Hearthstone card interactions work.
---
People just hate what they lose to. Or they like the idea of Hearthstone's mechanics and hate them in practice.
---
It's not very good and I've been experimenting with Drakkari Trickster, but you can probably cut it for a second Fal'dorei Strider.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Rogue has the deathrattle triggering weapon too, and can play it the turn before for a 0 mana activation on Cube. the turn it drops.
---
Any warlock beats odd paladin because of defile and dreadlord
---
It is a respond to china new politics in video game which unhealthy chat, sexuality and gore are too much for their men.
---
I don't think class identity should be limited to "this class can only play aggro, that one only control".  It's more that certain classes use specific mechanics.
---
Druid used to be about ramp...
---
Yes, in april.
---
Leave Buzzard at 3 (or maybe 4 mana) and change the text to read: "After you **play** a Beast, \[...\]". The card was busted because of the draw potential with Unleash the Hounds. But "muh player consfusion"...
---
&gt;MTG is not apples to apples here.
---
I was saying they shouldn't be compared. I mean, you got me on the cube comment. That isn't relevant. I was trying to highlight that MTG can be quite cheap. I mean, heck, you can proxy cards and play the game for free (outside of most tournaments). Ownership to me is less about value than it is about support. If Hasbro died tomorrow, I still have my cube/collection to play or sell. When Activation pulls the plug on Hearth (and they will one day), the players are left with nothing. But again, I don't believe the games should be compared.
---
Hearthstone is developed like a video game, and there is no reason it couldn't be vended just like Destiny with season passes for all gameplay and microtransactions for cosmetics only. If playing Hearthstone to you = collecting gold cards or whatever, that's fine. But it's strange to me that players in this thread are arguing the benefits of a delivery model (lootboxes) that's not in their best interest when what they seemingly care about most is gameplay.
---
Call me back when you don't get duplicate Epics and then we can talk about being "generous".
---
So control decks can't have lethal win conditions? That doesn't seem good for the game either.
---
I think he's  saying you can only cube a cube once, since you can only have two cubes in your deck. Meanwhile, you can cube two witchwood grizzlies, since two different grizzlies can each be cubed. So like per game one cubing, not that you only ever cube a cube once in your hearthstone career.
---
This is a good point. In Hearthstone, 10 mana gets you a 12/12 with a moderate upside, and that's pretty decent. In Magic, 10 mana gets you 2 extra turns. It gets you "Draw 7 cards, get 10 mana back so you can play those 7 cards". You get "Remove everything from the game". You get "everything you play for the rest of the game is free". In Hearthstone, you couldn't put an effect as powerful as Plague Wind ("Destroy all creatures you don't control") on a card, because 10 mana isn't nearly as costly.
---
Honestly, when the grim patron came up I expected them to have removed the beer/whatever he's drinking. 
---
Ah. Figured. Thanks though! 
---
I think he means that, in a normal game, you can Cube two Doomguards/Mountain Giants/whatever.  But, since you can only play two Cubes in your deck, you can (generally) only Cube a Cube once per game.
---
Just missing magic mirror to put a copy in your deck. 
---
This is because they didn't choose the right words. This "play" in "play a secret from your deck" actually means "put a secret in play from your deck", while the "play" in "whenever you play a secret" means "whenever you use a card from your hand that is a secret". It's a mistake and that's why games like MTG are far more concise and sound more pedantic. MTG would say "put a [random] secret from your deck into play".
---
No, I ain't classes should be limited to only aggro or control, but Hunter has always been about face. Remember Control Hunter shenanigans back in Gadzhetzan? 35% of ladder are Hunters and the major part is Spell Hunter so they buffed mid Hunter with 1-1 rush and masters call just to make sure this archetype doesn't die 
---
You're exactly right in that the card refill was the unnecessary part of the functionality of the card. It should be somewhat on par powerwise to other 10 cost cards such as mages pyroblast. Comparing the two pyro 10 the face
---
UI 5 to the face plus 5/5 on the board (but obviously can't be used same turn so 5 armor kind of makes up the power difference) . But when you add draw 5 cards on top of that the power level spikes to 1.5 2x that of something like pyroblast. 
---
I just miss how every class lost so much from what originally was around. 
---
Warrior lost Fiery, one of the best control cards in the game. Execute because instead of nerfing Jade Idol, they forced you to run Geist which would destroy both of your main removal tools as a Warrior. Nerfed two of the only OTK decks Warrior has ever had, Patron and Worgen. 
---
Druid lost Innervate, Growth, and Nourish because of Jade Idol, Howl, UI, Paths, Plague. Arguably, those cards are very core to Druid simply for the fact the class has been built around swing turns, similar to Shaman and Rogue which all categorize as mana cheating classes. 
---
Mage lost Frost Lance, Ice Block and Mana Wyrm, all cards that were core to specific archetypes. 
---
I can keep on listing cards off, but it just sucks. I dont want new cards that do the same thing, I want those cards. 
---
I want a truly wild format, either with the existing or a complete revamp of the format itself. We talk about times past where specific decks were incredibly strong and broken, but how many would hold up today? We'll never know, because almost every card nerfed prior to this year were made to be unplayable garbage. The biggest allure to wild for me initially was being able to play decks that were old. With the overlap between standard and wild, too many core class cards have been obliterated rendering any fringe or good decks from years past unplayable. I miss my old decks, but as a Druid only player from 2016-2018, it feels bad that nothing is even close to what it used to be. 
---
You can test decks in casual. There's millions of friends there.
---
Pretty sure if you created a poll of the best designed cards in Hearthstone, Defile would very likely be #1.
---
it's on the top right, at least for me. using the reddit legacy layout.
---
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9uwlss/battletag_findafriend_zandalar_edition/?sort=new) you go.
---
Move to wild, pick up power mace, flying machine, whirling zapomatic, cut al‚Äôakir and use annoyotrons to round out the corpsetaker conditions.
---
I like that card back
---
I mean there was this undatakah hadronox druid.
---
Damn, if they made this card I would actually grind the rank5 floor just handing out free dust.
---
Not remotely as quick. Pirate warrior could kill you in 4 turns, 5 was pretty common. Same with aggro druid, pre inervate nerf it could achieve turn 3 lethals.
---
My point is that Hearthstone doesn't have to be a CCG, it could just as easily be an LCG without changing any aspect of gameplay. You could even add packs of gold cards to satisfy people into lootboxes who are collection driven. In the beginning, Hearthstone was a hybrid CCG/LCG and they moved away from that model because? And collecting cards is the delivery model, not the gameplay. You may derive pleasure from lootboxes, but Hearthstone would still play just like Hearthstone if you could buy whole sets of non-gold cards for a reasonable set price. It might attract different players (one less interested in gambling), but it would be functionally the same game.
---
I'm willing to bet that most of those cube-on-cube plays were just a cube eating a silenced cube.
---
I totally agree with you but it should cost 3 mana. Think about warpath for a second, 2 mana for each damage. 
---
It will reduce your we but its not critical 
---
I said the argued the same thing when Wild Growth got nerfed and got downvoted to oblivion lol. 
---
Thank you for the feedback.
---
IF you play into it.
---
My man. 
---
Who in here thinks you need a COMPLETE collection to have competitive decks when the vast majority of cards are just filler and rarely, if ever, see any play outside of arena?
---
It was mentioned here in the comments: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/a4xbgz/so_masked_contender_says_that_you_play_a_secret
---
But I think it was brought up somewhere else as well. I'll get back to you.
---
My elegant solution is to move Druid to a niche of choice, notably with Fandral in its wild pool.  Treat UI like the Command spells of Magic: the Gathering.  You only get two of the four effects of UI, and if you want all four you have to have Fandral on the field.
---
Why would you? The first card you've played that turn was a card that Silenced her.
---
You could, of course, play your big card first and THEN drop Silence. But you would still give your opponent a chance to play his big card first.
---
Since it wasn't drawn, did it not replace itself? If not, that's actually pretty useful. 
---
Genn and Baku are mana cheating cards that you can exploit right away and for the whole game. They're not very healthy either.  
---
I don't think they intend to carry forward the **Recruit** keyword
---
&gt;wahhh I dont like that control has a powerful board clear wahhhh
---
Topsy combo isn't a 1-card win condition, unlike a good number of the otks.
---
Tweet it to @blizzardcs
---
Listen. I don‚Äôt play meta decks, and Aggro is the fun police. In other games you tune your deck to the meta. In hearthstone you always have to tune your deck to deal with Aggro. 
---
That's still not "spaghetti code." People throw that term a lot but it has a very specific meaning: it refers to when your code is set up in such a convoluted way that when you tweak one thing it affects another and it's not clear what the connection between them is.
---
I *am* a programmer, and that's not what spaghetti code is. See [this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aohvom/til_masked_contender_doesnt_trigger_secretkeeper/eg1ss1u/)
---
Because spaghetti code refers to a very specific type of [bad coding.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aohvom/til_masked_contender_doesnt_trigger_secretkeeper/eg1ss1u/)
---
Completely unnecessary correction, but the egg umbra cube play gets you three 8/8s due to also popping the first with cube, using it itself as a deathrattle activator of sorts.
---
Do you realize how busted hunter or paladin would be if this triggered it? 
---
You play any kind of 2 mana secret or trap to protect it, it gets buffed, turn 3 adds another token to remove any threats, play some more secrets on 4 and make it impossible to deal with.
---
As they always so. Wrap it before you tap it. 
---
He was still played a lot in old Midrange Druid (FoN-Savage Roar) at 9 mana
---
Lul 
---
They didn't even design it. It was a highly upvoted custom Hearthstone card
---
I remember I started playing a couple months before Ungoro dropped because I was like, meh, a Blizzard game on the phone, let's try it, and I was hooked ever since.
---
I remember the first time I hit rank 15 with a super budget dragon priest deck and how stoked I was.
---
I remember the first time I hit rank 5 and how stoked I was.
---
I remember the first time I hit legend and how stoked I was (thank you Spiteful Priest, hahaha).
---
And I would say now what I enjoy most are opening packs, having a pretty hearty collection (I agree with the notion the game is pay to have fun, at least if you hadn't been around from the beginning), and messing around in casual with crazy decks.  I have a quest priest deck that runs Benedictus and Chameleos and I have had games where I played 2 or 3 Rexxars, multiple Dr. Booms, etc., and crazy stuff like that is great.
---
Oh, and I still love the first of every month, hitting rank 5 or higher (I don't usually push for legend because messing around is just more enjoyable to me without the pressure to win and rank up).
---
Oh and also, WAHHHHH, golden legendary!!!!!!  (I have quite fortunate with the number of golden legendaries I have pulled, which I do not take for granted.  Lich King is my favorite, followed by Thalnos).
---
funnily enough, defile was the exact reason dreadsteed had to be deleted from the game.
---
Taunt is really good on sylv because your opponent can not trade his minions into your other minions
---
A hard reset of the server and a patch to remove the card back.
---
How about any control deck against the Rogue Quest
---
Shadow flame does need need giants. It's easy to turn it into a flamestrike.
---
Honestly, I like it for a quick few games every few days and/or to play through the daily quests.
---
I may be the minority, but I really enjoy the solo playing (Dungeon Run, the Monster Hunt, and newest Revenge). Yes, I've beaten them all... I just... Like if I'm watching sports but want to have a mindless game on (that doesn't need to be paused because it's against AI), I'll play.
---
It can certainly be addicting.
---
Abbysal Enforcer as well.
---
Thing is, since they removed Enrage, they added 4 "Enrage" minions to the game. That's more than they've done for Charge, to compare
---
Thanks for further proving my point, since less neutral legendaries/more class legendaries *increases* the cost of the game.
---
Don't forget the Treyeangle and the Peye.
---
There‚Äôs a decidedly finite number of cards and it would only take a few months at most to update 
---
I quit Hearthstone for 4 months until it rotated.
---
Late during Boomsday, VS released an article about meta polarity, because we've had A LOT of decks with polarizing matchups in the meta as the best decks, which lead to frustrating gameplay because people felt like their decisions, don't matter, only the matchups do, e.g. Odd Warrior would just shit on every aggro deck and get shit on by every combo deck, Quest Rogue would shit on everything that's not aggro and get murdered by aggro.
---
Donais response:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9mg4v1/vicious_syndicate_presents_meta_polarity_and_its/e7ek1tj/?context=10
---
Not if they haven't finished drawing their deck ("before he charges the cannon).
---
I mean there's always a chance of drawing Shirvallah early at any point, which is why they always have multiple ways to reload the cannon.  Double Banker, Zola to clone Banker, Banker and the card that puts two copies into deck, etc.
---
When OP is playing scummy Mech Hunter so you wanna downvote but a dead Big Priest just feels so good you upvote anyway
---
Updating my drivers fixed the problem, thanks.
---
Yes, those are the two options; Either we have infinite value, insane OTK burst and overall busted power levels or we go back to playing Yeti on curve. There's nothing in between. 
---
 Are you trolling or just willfully ignorant? 
---
I just assumed it was Hunter‚Äôs passive ability to draw exactly what you needed, and that‚Äôs why they always played Deathstalker Rexxar or greater spell stone on curve
---
Well, I'm not trolling and I have finished top 500 legend 5 times, so maybe you're just bad.
---
But we're talking about a situation where they got mojo'd LOL. Can't do all those things. And LOL if they put it back in before they finish drawing their deck then they can't use holy wrath (unless they wanna hit you in the face for 2 damage)  LEARN THE GAME BRUH
---
&gt; got every card back since closed beta
---
No you don't. Dalaran flame, power core, golden celebration. You don't have any of those.
---
Your collection is incomplete and you will never be able to have them all.
---
Anduin: "I will give you power untold, little recruit. All you must do is betray your paladin order." 
---
Recruit: "kk." 
---
What is SAD?
---
At least Druid is still good at drawing cards and gaining a fuckton of armor. So now their main win condition is to stall the game out, draw their entire deck in one turn and win with some degenerate combo.
---
The class designed around cheating out big minions doesn‚Äôt give a shit about minions anymore. LOL
---
&gt;Something is super fucked here.
---
like you believing a random redditor over a Blizzard employer?
---
-prep
---
-coine
---
-concede
---
Puhleeze. Just go tall. Put on pressure without going all in.
---
&gt; If there is one class that can thrive in a meta without powerful cards it is Warlock because of Lifetap.
---
You havent been around during Un'goro have you?  
---
Ungoro warlock was so bad not even zoo was seen anywhere.
---
A burst finish, sounds a lot like a combo deck when you say it like that. A 4 attack minion, that's like saying "my 4/4 Arcane tyrant is my win condition." You can say it, but just don't expect anyone to take you seriously. 
---
Not like this sub wasnt crying constantly to give rogue healing and hunter draw lol
---
LOL what control priest is extremely favored against both of those. LMAO what those are matchups that I am excited to see. Where did you get those whackass stats just look at it yourself NOOB
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-120/
---
I mean, you can even "think" a little and understand why control priest is favored.
---
&gt;  with a real lack of weaknesses
---
They are weak to multiple large creatures.
---
If Defile was the best designed card, it would not have been necessary to nerf a preexisting, archetype-defining card to make room for it. It is not good design to create a square peg when you need it to fit in a round hole.
---
My Jaina displate is still in the box. It was delivered three weeks ago but I never got around to opening it. 
---
That‚Äôs just semantics. I was here for my cardbacks. 
---
I always agreed with Kripp that it should be nerfed to a 2/6

Sad but true......
---
A 4 attack minion with 9 health is a legitimate threat LOL. Maybe you've never felt the twilight drake beatdown, but that shit legit bruh.
---
Soooo if you cant have a burst finish, I guess the only way control decks can win is fatigue? Sounds like a pretty narrow description to me LOL
---
Sometimes is a far fetch, I think you mean all the time. Without the burst damage, "control" priest has no way to win most if not all matchups. That's not really what a control deck is, actually it's more of what a combo deck is. 
---
The kobold librarian seems like it would only be done by a bad player which could explain WR (trading the 2/1 seems like it would almost always be better) and the doomsayer is just "?"
---
If you look closely, the mana crystal from the coin disappears before the card enters play. So it works fine, it just gives the illusion that it should work
