And how are vague terms like "significant", "significant but somehow magically not part of the meta" or" three random tiers with no further qualifiers for tiers" somehow more tangible?? Sounds like you're just arbitrarily choosing to blow smoke up Trump's ass while choosing to paint everyone else with broad strokes without giving much consideration to how their systems might work. Trump is just pulling vague uninformative words out of his ass instead of numbers and you're just gobbling it up.

---
Oh... I misunderstood the news... :(

I don't think introducing super powerful cards into the classic set to replace the old super-powerful cards they rotated out would be a good idea imo.

Begrudgingly, I agree (hate druid, love Tauren)

Very poor voice acting on this one....well for the last three really

He uses a specific percentage. He usually details it in the first video of each of his reviews. Maybe go watch one of his actual reviews instead of whining about something you know nothing about.

You can just play a few games and add your opponents. Usually works for me if everyone is offline

Agreed. Useful, but not broken cards. It wouldn't be any fun if they were terrible though, right?

r/pitchers ?
---
...*Treants*? Is this some sort of single player reference I’m not aware of? I genuinely can’t remember the last time I saw a Token Druid in ranked, rank 5 and higher. And even the Token Druids you see aren’t exactly of a Treant variety.
---
And it's doing a fine job at it.
---
In reality, I still think it's a fun game, just not worth 15 bucks a month anymore.
---
I might pay 5. At MOST.
---
This was a horrible week, the only interesting cards were Tam, Crisp and the Paladin Healer. Do you just get instantly featured in this compilation if you are the first to make a meme into a card?
---
When choosing passive treasures, you should almost always try to get at least one of the unique treasures since they're usually much better than the neutral ones. Your second treasure works with whatever your current deck is.
---
The 3rd has 3 board slots taken so you can only play 4 creatures.  The 4th is swap attack and health.  5th is 12 rounds.  
---
They are great single player modes but they are not worth it if you dislike single player modes.  The extra 21 packs worth of gold are a better investment in packs of you don't like single player modes.

The day Blizzard nerf barnes and the whole community of Hearthstone realizes that Barnes isn't even the problem, I'm gonna laugh, so, so hard.

Adding now

I don’t even play this game but how on earth did people think that was weak? It’s a cheap ass 5/5
---
I’ve been squaring up against mech and midrange hunters, with the occasional secret hunter. I teched in two freezing traps which seem to be helping.

---
No it doesn't. If you run a golden copy, it might give it away since you get a gold hero and full golden deck, but there's no way to 100% know your opponent is using Whizbang/Zayle
---
Gets matched on the coin against even hunter.
---
Yup, it started to work at some point within this week though
---
Chump is the very best for fun messing around decks, Kibler if you want discussions and variations.
---
What? You get the legendary card back by getting legend rank.
---
4-mana 4/4 "Your opponent can't cast spells this turn" Not too bad
---
Weird flex, but okay.
---
There can be some pretty wild shit with shudderwock and c’thun. Theoretically, pairing it up with prince valanar and dopplegangster...9 6/6 deals 6 dmg with lifesteal, summon 2 copies of itself, repeat. Just a thought
---
f2p man's loatheb

ventoosss#1252 NA 80g trade
---
I disagree. I don't think the fact that the requirements have changed to get to that point should affect the name of the title. In any given year, the rules will be the same for everyone, so whoever plays within those rules and manages to come out on top over the rest of the top players deserves to be called the World Champion. The requirements for Firebat to qualify for and win the championship in 2014 were very different from the requirements for Hunterrace to become the World Champion earlier this year. But they are both Hearthstone World Champions and the fact that they won with different sets of rules doesn't diminish the title for either of them.
---
Sports leagues (and esports leagues) only exist because people want to watch the top players/teams compete to see who is the best. If at the end of the whole thing you don't give someone the title of World Champion, then you've wasted everyone's time.
---
Whoever wins this year will have bested all the other top players in the world in order to do so. How is that not a world champion?

Tess is easy mode once you get spell power and the warrior 2 mana deal 1 to all creatures echo. Also almost always take hero power costs 1 twice per turn on her. That's my 2 cents.
---
My first golden draft fully worth it, nice!
---
Thanks Maly very cool
---
I could imagine that they are afraid of it being exploitable if there is a feature that reveals the oponents cards.
---
But it should be managable for them to keep it safe, one should think.
---
in case you wonder, it took a whole 50 minutes of waiting for those Val'Anir procs to come to an end

classic overreaction.

dude had a tough match and was reflecting on it. give the guy a break.

They wouldn’t do a playable hero and card both with the same art.

He means the authenticator app though I think.
---
Worth getting to add a layer of security.
---
Anytime anything "weird" happens, immediately close and force restart the game. If you're fast enough, you can get back in and reconnected before your turn ends, and this will resync your client and the game state. Fixes most everything. You have 70 seconds, don't waste them asking silly questions, just bounce the thing.

Ahh ok my bad, totally glossed over that.

Disguised toast is really fun and memey, try him.

Important note: I just updated this thread with other QNA things as I rewatched the whole stream again. I think some of them are really interesting.
---
I assume from your nickname you are German rich and bald
---
Boom was broken right away, and wasn't played because of synergy with other cards. Boom even increased the winrate of freezemage, which is arguably the least synergistic deck possible for such a card.
---
I'm finding him a bit difficult in Normal mode, to be honest. I did my first Paladin run last night and got the 0-mana Bells combo, so I figured I just had a free win... but then Haro copied my 5/5 Grimmer Patron and after that I couldn't get a minion to stick.
---
Even when I win this fight is a huge grind, really not fun.
---
That sentence doesn’t mean the card is necessarily anywhere close to good or viable. Picture an 8 mana 6/6 battlecry add a copy of a minion to your hand, when played it’s battlecry triggers thrice, that wouldn’t be very good but it does make big pogos
---
Nice writeup, hooked reaver was good though
---
I'm confused by this, are you saying that when you used Storm Bringer your minions got weaker? Or are you saying that when you used Storm Bringer your minions had less attack than they would if you played them normally?
---
Are you telling me that dog giving every card a 3/5 isn't a good set review?
---
I love the idea of splitting expansions into smaller ones. I'm kinda tired of such a long new-expansion hype.  
---
Probably never gonna happen, but I always liked the idea of coming out with a small expansion every other month, then on months with no expansion, rotate out the oldest, so there's a new meta every month but with the same amount of new cards each year.
---
I will win while you keep comming here to cry about things like "stacking legendaries". Your life must be very sad if you think your way of playing gives you the moral highground or something lmao. "Win by any means" hahahahahahha
---
The name is commander Bolan or something similar, the best thing that I can come up with is this:
---
https://youtu.be/H5C0vkresK0
---
At 15:35. It seems that he's extremely rare.
---
That's one card that can be silenced/destroyed
---
Perhaps more buffs like blessing of kings?
---
It's kinda funny that opponent's name roughly translates as Snip-Snap.
---
13:43-14:14 = 31 minutes

Yes 👉

They need tools to survive more than tools to make bigger Pogos. Now another card that rushed pogos would be truly terrifying.
---
Deadwing#1142 trading quest on NA.
---
Can you fill me in on what it does now?
---
Do you have all the other rarity murlocs already? I feel like they are much more important than any of those cards you mentioned. You play murloc warleaders far more often than you play hagatha.
---
all done!
---
I honestly don’t see the negative side of releasing these SA heroes to use for ladder. It’s the same exact class and give a new taste to the game. I love Hearthstone but sometimes things new need to be thrown in to the pot. Things have been the same for way too long.
---
Still pretty bad tbh.
---
Turn 1pilfer into rebuke, turn 2 dagger, turn 3 face collector into Millhouse, turn 4 wombo combo. That's some high level pay right there.
---
Don’t have tyrande didn’t know about the short window she was available and you had to invest time in another game. Blizz would make so much money if they just made 10+ portraits per class and made you pay for them
---
You could try thijsas Sudoku shaman

Anyone could do as bad as T5
---
It's not like people play the best decks because data sites exist. It's the other way around, data sites exist because people want to play the best decks.
---
I laughed so hard when i saw this guy for the first time, even more when Togwaggle told him to quit roleplaying as an orc. Hope they honestly do get this guy into the game
---
Does he? Is that another boss, just this guy in scourgelord version or what? Link me some images or videos if you got any, I'd love to see this
---
Thanks for good advice. I agree Rover is important but warrior haven’t got anything good for turn two. I try Scraphound to get armor, it works ok against other decks but Hunter has that card that does two damage and get a bomb on the board. 
---
I use one Spellbreaker, one Faceless to counter that “magnetic/poison/damage to everything” and its pretty cool, also that card that kill a mech. But it’s still very easy to fall behind and get the HP so low that Leeroy finish the game. 
---
Even if I just focused on counter Mech Hunter only I’m not sure it would work.
---
That’s a lot of turtles.
---
Both get. I've added you if you still have the quest
---
Not to mention if you play murloc shaman you get skargl quite often from underbelly angler .
---
Nice
---
Idk, just seemed really unfair to me.
---
Yes, of course cards get upvoted based on flavor. Take away the flavor and things get bland and boring. There's a reason Leeroy is liked despite its negative impact on game health, it's fucking flavorful. Without the meme, it's just another charger.
---
It's interesting that you say the crab rave card is an underpowered card, while I think it's a balanced card, and the comments of the post call it OP. I think your dislike of its reference clouds that it's an interesting mechanic. You're completely ignoring that the crabs swap sides each turn, meaning the opponent has to get through his own line of defence to go face again.
---
You call it boring, but it's objectively more interesting than the majority of hearthstone cards. Look through the Rise of Shadows cards, and you'll see plenty of basic mechanics: "Give your minions +1/+1", "Deal 4 damage. Discover a spell", "Your secrets trigger twice." Even Kalecgos is doesn't have any flashy mechanics, but how you combine them and him being Kalecgos makes it feel epic.

*For clarification, there’s a council of Warlocks in WoW called “The Dark Harvest” that is/was led by 6 Warlocks of varying races/skills (typically tied to the 3 talent trees that players had, Jubeka and the former leader were Demonologists and Jubeka learned how to better summon them while her partner learned how to better use their power and went evil).
---
The main factor though is that said council is actually supposed to be all good guys who use the powers to save the world, even if it tends to be “I know what the enemy is doing, I’ve studied ritualistic sacrifices as a major in college”.

Insert The Office meme of two pictures being the same thing

Well, he's a WoW NPC. Xur'ios is a vendor in Legion Dalaran, based off of Xur from Destiny. It's like double meta.
---
people copy what streamers are playing more than what is top winrate on hsreplay. secret hunter was the #1 deck on hsreplay for most of last month but saw very little play. so no data sites do not make the game more stale.
---
I actually thought about it too, didn't try it though
---
Complete
---
I just want to build my own decks and face a story-driven not randomed campaign just like g'old days. 
---
It could be a bless if we were allowed to build the whole deck instead of them being given to us. With a selected sort of cards and maybe some adventure-exclusive cards to spice up the deal, just like a bigger, saucier tavern brawl with a whole story/campaign behind it.
---
I don't like the dungeons, they take so much time to complete and take almost no challange to do so.
---
Someone get the link to the video of the (Russian? Eastern European?) dude saying “why are you mad? Is only game”
---
They might do the same thing as they did with c’thun. C’thun in old gods could not be dusted and was given for free. It wouldn’t be that weird to make the new ones dustless.
---
So Mechhunter mirror. You could counter with your own Venomized Missles Launcher. Or try to have some minions thatll drop some microbots on their death around turn 6. Otherwise? Spiderbomb with Firework Tech?
---
PRIMITIVE
---
Sorry i mistyped I meant mech paladin
---
And once again, I summon another Blood of the Ancient One ^Hahahaha. Fool! It's the only other minion in the entire deck!

Fatalis#1839 Americas 80g trade you first

I really think Mulch is a great replacement for Naturalize. Its 3 Mana instead of 1, it doesn't Mill cards (except if they're holding 9 cards, or at 10 cards in hand it's a better Assassinate) and it fills the void of hard removal in Druid. 
---
Yes, you could say that Druid should not have hard removal but in the case that they were to have more, Mulch is just fine. 
---
Since we got Call of the Void, Pilfer and Time of Intellect maybe Paladin should get a 1 Mana 'Add two Silver Hand Recruits' to your hand or something; like a bad Lost in the Jungle or something
---
It shows that the Ogre treats everyone as his enemies
---
Asshole
---
They already release a free yearly hero like maive and lunara. Its not like hero skins are a god-given right. It's a cosmetic that you dont actually need
---
I cheesed the LK with most classes except Druid (I used jades) and Shaman (Murlocs and windfury). The only craft I specifically made for this were the Jade cards and the two Mechwarpers. I already had a Faceless Manipulator and just enough draw. I also added that one magnetic taunt mech into the mix.
---
Tbh there's no way I'm gonna even attempt wild - not ready for all that knowledge I'll need
---
That makes no sense as everywhere else friendly means on your side of the board and enemy means on your opponent's side.
---
Pronk#2573 EU trading 80g quests
---
would be really flavorful if this Mortal Strike spell made him "AUURGGGG" like garrosh of old.
---
Outstanding Move
---
You're better off buying packs of the expansions you missed to get the legendary guaranteed within the first ten packs of each set. Unless dungeon runs are the reason you play the game, the Heist isn't a good gold investment for any player trying to catch up. If Zayle interests you, you're probably better off just crafting Whizbang instead.
---
The big thing that makes 5-L doable is meta knowledge. To get to 5, you probably have decent mastery over basic hs/ccg knowledge. The thing that makes it possible to make the next jump is understanding the meta. What are your win cons in every single matchup. If your unfavored, what can you do to eek out every single % you can. Like all ccgs, hs is random; the highest level of skill you can obtain is knowing how to play to influence every single random outcome to be beneficial for you.
---
Now got the 2nd one as well, you had to connect the Twitch account with your battle.net account, then it said on the Twitch notifications that I got it, and then I had to re-login to see the pack
---
Oooo, a wild game designer. I haven't seen you guys here on reddit in a whole.
---
8 mana removal and 6/6 body on board, yummy
---
Gloves aren’t bad because you can steal key boss cards and refill your own hand for cheap. 
---
But then again the amulet is 2 mana mind control is that adds a possibly big or good minion to your deck, which in my opinion is a little better than mirror
---
So depending where you are in the run, probably gloves or amulet of domination
---
Hm. Not sure what Mech Paladin plays. Does the deck have some variable cards? Or is it a strict 30 cards core deck?
---
It's a very minor nuissance for me.
---
I only wish I'd been playing on heroic.
---
Playing Warlock. First treasure offered were the Robes of Gaudiness, and the card pack that followed had Rin in it. Yes please.
---
Next treasure offered had the Golden Candle. I knew this would be important for the last four bosses, just had to hope I'd draw it in time. Also picked up another Rin then.  Figured the more Rins, the better, in case I didn't draw the Candle.
---
Managed to pick up a third Rin before getting a Bob encounter where I managed to guarantee Golden Candle in my starting hand.
---
Honestly, the rest of the deck was entirely meaningless. I was worried during one of the final four fights when the opponent played a Rin they'd gotten from the Candle.  But apparently the AI was stupid, because they never played any of the follow up cards, and then played the Legendary that summons 3 goblin bombs. And with the double battlecry anomaly, they ended up with six 0/2's on the board and no way to activate them.
---
During two of the fights I got to play the legendary that summons all minions that didn't start in your hand, which nicely filled my board. 
---
Easiest chapter 5 of my life.
---

---

---
Beginner's luck
---
The issue with adventures, was that the meta just doesn't change in an interesting way with card sets that small. Sure you'd have the new meta, but it would be a pale shadow of itself and that's a very bad thing. Your killing something just to have it around more often.
---
Take archetypes like bomb warrior, that couldn't be created with only 4-5 class cards.
---
Also in order to make the expansions more impactful, the cards would have to be of a much higher powerlevel, leading to insane powercreep
---
Or maybe exactly like that. Playing and preparing all day can be stressful and tiring.
---
I've made it to Vargoth every run, and almost every time he's beat me. I finally beat him on normal with a deathrattle priest deck (I had 5 Sylvanas, 2 Obsidian Statues, and 3 Convincing Infiltrators)
---
What about
---
“All minions in your deck have an attack equal to their health.”
---
&gt;not HOF cards, just the Wild ones.
---
HOF cards are Wild...
---
Matriarch is fine, it saw quite a bit of play in ww as a finisher for dragon priest
---
Agree with you on holy water, though.
---
Lol, sound the bells is sort of op in that mode. I beat the last chapter no sweat because I had  a bunch of sound the bells, the treasure that make spells cost heath  and a bunch of lifesteal minions. My turns were basically casting it until my health was at least 2, then attack get half my health back and start casting it again.

splitting expansions is not a good idea , will aslo make game more expensive likly to more constant swaps and solo adventure and buffs/nerfs and free cards like snipsnap are just fine at keeping up changing meta game between expansions

Granted there were many feel good plays against big mechs but overall I was able to beat about mech decks through pure aggro behavior most of the time.  
---
I think mage was a deck where having less token generators in place for silence was where it hurt me most and I get a lot of mage matchups.  
---
I've stopped the druid deck now since I hit my 500 but it was a version of the more mech orientated deck I had the best success with this season (rank 2)
---
This happens in Overwatch too and I always found it annoying because I'd know if I got disapointing duplicates or credits our of a loot box.
---
Donais even made 2 post in the last 2 days. Theyve been pretty active and its not even the next expansion time yet
---
I like the "Flip Side" idea - would add some consistency which i think would be interesting. Hard to keep the balance for certain decks when turn order plays such a big role in their success..

One quick Google search or Reddit search would've told you that it's bugged...
---
I suppose I have to be attending Daemen?
---
I posted something similar a month ago

---
Be interesting to see if people's opinion change much from then or not.
---
MTG:A manages to do it just fine
---
That's not what the image shows at all
---
Dude. You damn luckster. 2 legendaries of your choice.
---
I know it’s a bug i’m just trying to make developers notice this by sharing :)
---
And in case anyone wants to know: Heroic with Anomaly that spells cast twice and then got the treasure with „spells cost life instead of mana“. Whispers of the old Gods (2x), Blessing of the Ancients (1x, but gives +6/+6).  And an Earthen Scales because it was there.

It's one of the worst archtypes in the meta right now by win rate.  
---
Though I think a lot of the poor win rate is people jsut don't know how  to pilot it correctly as it can be quite complicated if you really want to pull it off.  Or they are running less than optimal decks with out good curve and tempo.  
---

---
Plenty of decks countering it though.  
---
There will be times the rogues RNG does go right though and a highroll deck like pogo rogue you just can't really stop it.  
---
RNG being rng though means they will more often than not fail to get those good rolls.
---
just check it's bad matchups on hsreplay: [link])(https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/250/pogo-rogue#tab=matchups)
---
"Should it *always* be bad to go second?"
---
I played spike ridge steed (6mana spell) and got a 1/1 tiger from it instead. It happened twice and I buffed the first 1/1 thinking it may be a 1 time bug but it happened again. It says the minion is a 6/6/6 with the only effect on it being “Stinky” yet it’s a 6/1/1.
---
what... the deck depends on the rng of getting a card from another class?
---
Lots to think about.
---
I like the death from Cho'gall in BoT as the concede:
---
"Come is the dawn! Come shades of Twilight. Come madness. Come havoc! Come Infinite Night!!"
---
Probably could shorten that to: "Come Infinite Night!"
---
For me it was but I was able to beat the 2 last chapters with Tekahn and Robes of Gaudiness. For some reason Robes of Gaudiness appears a lot when you use Tekahn or at least for me.
---
I also heard that the treasure that converts all cards to golden legendary minions is a good way to disrupt the synergy in the final bosses’ decks. I haven’t done it yet though.
---
I rarely get in match disconnects resulting in a loss and when I do it's always due to my connection dropping out.  How can you be sure this is Blizzard's fault.
---
I used to have an issue of losing matches before I even got into them due to weird glitches that weren't related to my connection at all (hope this is fixed, happened in arena all the time so don't want to waste gold testing again) but that seems a seperate issue.
---
Silence only take away the shield on one taunt and it’s still a 4/8. I can’t see how that helps against a wall of taunts that come back over and over with only 5 heal.
---
Awesome! This is the best one too!
---
Adventures before the “Dalaran Heists” were worth the gold but the heist is too expensive as a F2P. You only get 3 packs per chapter and each chapter is 700 gold. That’s not good.
---
Android 5.0 is one of the requirements, it doesn't matter, if they don't want to support older devices they should limit it at the play store. Otherwise it just creates easy excuse for them. Btw. up until two patches ago I was doing fine on old phone - ower 10k wins, multiple legends on galaxy s4 lol
---
Wish they were back in standard!
---
Wait, that’s illegal
---
I vastly prefer to go second.  Why does it suck?
---
I'm not finish yet
---
A Forsaken, Dranei or Cho'Gall! They'd all be awesome.
---
I really like the way some cards, especially of the base set are super descriptive. 
---
Who cares if the text is different/inconsistent? It's simple and it works.
---
So going throw my heroic heist, I got the Anomaly - Nesting ( when a minon dies resummon a 1/1 of it)  , Then my first treasure i got was Totem Of The Dead , Those plus sylvanas = for playing 1 of her she goes off 6 times , On top of all this i had a 0 cost Dr.Boom Mad Genius and stargazing
---
Teach me your ways. Been struggling so hard just to finish the last chapter.
