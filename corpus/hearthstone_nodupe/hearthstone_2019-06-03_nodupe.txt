Sorry can't help, don't play either of these decks. They're both great decks though. 
---
And with this new HS team that seems way more active with nerfs(and even buffs now) I'm not sure it'll ever be that "safe" to craft the best decks in the game, especially when they become oppressive with 20% or even 30% of the meta; They don't seem to tolerate this as well as the previous team.
---
same order!
---
Hey Tachii,
---
Great stuff! 
---
In the first video you linked:
---
Any clue as to why the presenter mentions card rarity in relation to offer rates of the new sets? Wasn't that changed? Thanks!

Hi not kolento - yes you are - no , I'm dad.
---
You'd think so, I see they left it out of their theory crafted deck though, so perhaps they feel it isn't too useful in deathrattle hunter.
---
Pathra's cool and the community is trash.

with people like this it's best to just rope them back, if they wanna be an asshole, just be an asshole back

Shark and Lab Recruiter are probably enough. It‚Äôs a tight deck list and scheme isn‚Äôt very proactive.
---
You are past redemption
---
Try it without.  I've played around with a heavier mech package and you can just tempo out a lot.  Kangor's is important often, but it's not a combo deck that is solely reliant on a single card to win.

I also do this.  I plan my turn during opponents, and play out as fast as I can.  My goal is to hit end turn within 2 seconds of it starting.  I've never had an opponent rope more than two turns when I do this.

Did you try buying his beard?

Linzi Redgrin takes the cake for worst designed and most annoying. Game 1 SMOrc deck that can easily snowball if you don't have a curve (caused by a bad starting deck), super efficient hero power, extremely spamable voice lines with a voice like nails to a chalk board. But yeah, there are a select few bosses that will not shut up and say the same things every single game.
---
How do we go about verifying that?

---
Tough call. It's a bad pull from Oblivitron, low tempo with Nine Lives, and it's easy to accidentally fill your board with 1/1s. On the other hand, it look insane with Shaw and Zilliax, and if you don't want it in the rez pool (I think) you can just magnetize it onto something.
---
Yeah I just fought a dude with it. All I could do was watch him fill his board with monsters
---
Idk if they're up against token druid then I respect their dedication. Otherwise bleh

It‚Äôs tomorrow ?

Looks like the tournament camera feeds messed up and are showing one player (kolento) twice, instead of him and his opponent (thijs)

Who actually won this game between kolento hunter and kolento mage?

Oh I see, thanks for the info, thought my game client was bugged or something.

they clearly don't value their own time and just want to waste yours, you're giving them exactly what they want
---
i kinda stopped playing HS but damn that crystology buff is making me come back to try it out. what a juicy change.
---
Did Kazamon taste the blade ?
---
What the fuck? The dude is giving constructive feedback to the mods' request for feedback.
---
Imagine thinking playing any game everyday for multiple hours never gets boring. People just get burned out eventually. That makes space for new smaller streamers to come in and take their place.
---
This would be awesome but I honestly doubt they can do it.  Bob‚Äôs tavern is already their clever workaround from engine constraints.  Doubt they can pull another workaround.  One of the sad problems with the game.
---
It's in 12.30 hours from now
---
Oh fuck, I've been doing that just to thank them for the game. Am I a jerk?
---
Any tips lol? I recently created Catrina so I could play it and don't seem to win even 50% of the time. I'm wondering if I'm misplaying my removal spells or Mass resurrection.
---
Roughly how long do we have till patch hits? The daily quest reset kicks in about 10mins ago for me iirc but I dont have access to the game till much later, would love to start an arena run just for efficiency &gt;&lt;

The worst ones, you play a decent match and then when you have a possible chance for lethal, suddenly they start to rope. Why? Don't you want to finish the match faster and queue for next one?

But I learned to embrace it, I just get up from my chair and go around the house and see is there any chores needs to be done. My house haven't been cleaner, thanks to these players.

I like to wait on picking an arena class if I have quests coming up so I can potentially use the arena to finish it, but I do pay for the new arena right away most of the time.

Lol. No it‚Äôs not. You‚Äôre looking at rank 4-1. It‚Äôs not even a tier 1 deck in legend. It‚Äôs an easy deck to pilot and win games fast. It‚Äôs also a really easy deck to tech against, so as soon as it‚Äôs seeing too much play the meta will quickly shift to press it down. It‚Äôs literally what happened at the beginning of this expansion.

People should get banned for this.

Yes. It‚Äôs like waiting in line at the adMV and then getting to the receptionist and they just stare at you and say nothing.

It wasn't intended to be a funny meme, but no, it isn't really working. That said, I mainly ended up making it because my success with Resurrection plummeted at the end of May at rank 4/3, and I haven't had that kind of success with any priest deck since.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Hence the word "pseudo"
---
I wanted to get a video of spell damage +32 (most I can get with this deck) but it didn't work out.
---
The honest tip is: Don't bother.
---
It's not a time constraint issue: 3 hours a day is more than enough. If you plateau around rank 3/4, then that's probably your rank. Some tips won't do magic. The difference between rank 3 and Legend may not seem like much, but you kinda get boosted to rank 3 from ranked floor games. At 3-L, you'll pretty much exclusively face tryhards. 
---
Top comment recommends a 55% winrate. This is still hundreds of games, a lot of which you'd probably wanna do with the same deck. It's tedious, and I really wouldn't recommend a busy person to go for that. Also keep in mind that a 55% WR at 5-3 won't translate to a Legend run, as it will get tougher. You need quite a buffer.
---
Just play a deck you like. Liking a deck is often much more indicative of a high WR than a meta analysis. Just by sticking to a couple fun decks, you might just find yourself in Legend effortlessly.
---
Whizbang
---
We've had the countdown stickied on the sidebar for a couple of weeks.
---
No, the tavern ends, you just don‚Äôt have to choose a card to remove, all cards played during the tavern are effective for the run, but because the remove a spell card has a discover effect, it doesn‚Äôt get completed when you concede without picking.
---
Nope. Your cards cost half but you can only 2 cards per turn
---
Gildolin #2297 EU 80 gold quest, you go first
---
There's some buttons in the settings. Between tracking both decks, WR, the turn cards are drawn, counting damage on board etc. it just takes a lot out of your hands you'd do yourself anyway.
---
No it doesn't, freezing prevents the next attack, it doesn't prevent attacking for the next turn.
---
Zihi
---
Chances are, the buffs will do little if anything to affect the format in any big way. There may be a Pogo Rogue or a slightly more viable Wraith Paladin, neither of which really remove any decks from ladder.
---
At most, it'll be SN1P-SN4P powering up already powerful decks.
---
Blizzard and the majority of the subred think different. For them it was Rogue.

---
Not to mention topless streaming is for respectable reasons against twitch's rules and I don't think Dog wants to risk his account for dumb stuff like this.
---
Casual. Not necessarily friendly.
---
I disagree. Mech Paladin is going to become pretty great, as is Shaman. Deathrattle Hunter might be really strong too. 
---
Satellite/Kibler's Mech Paladin already uses x2 Crystology AND x2 Glowstone Technician, getting both of those cards buffed by a mana is obviously huge for the deck. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AlhyCVdcAE&amp;t=968s
---
Murloc Shaman with Spirit of the Frog and Thunderhead is already super strong too and The Storm Bringer is definitely playable there, with a mana buff then Thunderhead being premium stats then the deck is looking really good.
---
There there are other cards that definitely have the potential to be huge, 5 mana Pocket Galaxy is very scary for example.
---
 
---
Of course it's not going to turn the entire format on its head but the meta will definitely be shifted around a good amount and it will be a nice bit of fresh air.
---
Then suddenly plays \[\[Mayor Noggenfogger\]\] and proceeds to win the game.

The current meta is not worth saving, bring on the changes and figure out the consequences no sooner than 2 weeks later plz

Do I have to even if I dont play arena?
---
As long as they named the cards properly in the code, it‚Äôs easy to dive into the abyss and fix it. It‚Äôs just still a lot of work because they probably used spaghetti code.
---
This is not the hero card Hagatha, but the Swampqueen Hagatha.
---
I played control Warrior for a few weeks before I decided to disenchant all of my Warrior cards. Felt like I made penance with myself because of how bullshit the deck was. I don't want to degrade my opponents sanity like that.
---
They have Elixir of Vile, so two Robes would make three passives. You can only get two in a run.

I feel like that when Hunter plays its 5th 8/8 Wyvern with Rush thanks to LUL'Jin. But we all know that only Warrior is broken right? (:
---
Yeah, we figured it out already, but, I mean, is it really that hard to remember what cards you have in your hand and to distinguish which one misses, I don't understand the problem the op is talking about.
---
Yea. Thats a strange one. Some say its 11. For me it was 30. No idea.
---
But its still possible.
---
&gt;Add to that the massive arena changes (which will also be changing in a couple days) and the single-player content.
---
Its actually today! when the buffs/snip-snap hit, the arena will change sets and the buffed/new cards will be added

---
I'm Aaron Mahnke, and this... is Lore.
---
Cube it!
---
We're already friends lol let's do it. I have one to trade
---
That doesn‚Äôt give enough damage
---
How? I can only max get 12
---
It does if you play dead, hunter's mark and arcane shot your cube with a coin for a hero power lethal
---
Cube, Play Dead, Mark the cube, Arcane shot it, coin, Hero Power.
---
It‚Äôs 10am EST right now. Did the update happen? Do I have time to do this still? The arena is open currently
---
I've played with 21 copies of the card that gives 3 cards with 0 cost.
---
Sap's always been the best Rogue card.  A 2 Mana tempo swap to 6 or 8 Mana is something like 3-4x the old OP innervate in tempo without the ramp part.
---
It's pretty crazy and Blizzard will (hopefully) not be printing cards like that in the future.  
---
The other cards you listed, as great as they are, are still just minions, and even if Fel Reaver didn't have a downside, that's still just +3 tempo on what it should get (whereas sap would hit for +4 very regularly WITH initiative to help you get better trades through taunts or avoid bad trades, and has upside for much more raw tempo if it hits anything bigger than 6 cost).
---
Cube, play dead, hunter's mark the cube, arcane shot the cube, coin and hero power for 32.
---
THANK YOU
---
Thank you guys!
---
if you think that's bad don't look at the current story...
---
I played an early mech pally (no secret package) when rotation hit, felt decent, I could definitely see this deck becoming playable with crystology, 1 mana draw a card to play turn 2 and 3 is pretty strong especially considering the 1/3 mechs pally has access to (or conversely using it in a holy wraith deck to get 2 cost minions that thin your deck).
---
[For nostalgia sake.](https://iminchargenow.com/)
---
So true
---
Sn1p-Sn7P
---
Average match time for Warrior is like 12-14 minutes. Only time it's 20+ is probably mirror matches or matches against Control Shamans.
---
And that's "only" 5-6 min longer than it's for other decks. People exaggerating for the sake of bashing Warrior. As proven by the other guy claiming that Warrior matches "keep you away up to 40 minutes"
---
Not sure if all ppl bashing Warrior never experienced the Reno Jackson Meta. Cause there were multiple decks that could draw out games for 20 min + . You think you got him aaaand suddenly we're gonna be rich!
---
And there wasn't nearly that much whining about it. People just don't like that there's a popular counter to their braindead aggro decks. I really hope they gonna push even more control decks in the future. I'd love to see Priest or Paladin to compete with Warrior in the late game.
---
I am playing Old guardians mech hunter,but instead of 2x argus i use 1 zilliax and 1 argus,so far 12/13 wins against warrior but I havent played all that much I just play till I hit rank 5
---
Well i might just be thinking of rise of shadows which had A HUGE amout of good cards, so much so that its more valuable for new players to get packs from that set rather than classic (look up hearthstone mathematics) so this expansion i didnt have enough
---
Hunter can work without zuljin, that doesn't make zuljin weak. Warrior can't work without boom because the class is really fking weak. Boom is strong, but without boom warrior would be worse than plot twist handlock. 
---
&gt;Zuljin gives you a board that gets brawled
---
Great, now you have like 8 buffed beasts in your deck and a full hand, more value than boom gives on average.
---
If zuljin didn't generate cards he would be OK. Right now I think he is by far the strongest card in the game just because of the insane free value you get. It's like a better Yog.
---
It's not like I can't beat a control warrior, it's just never fun. Even when I win.
---
I can send you the 200 replays so you can see them 1 by 1, then we can discuss who is pulling stuff out of his ass. 
---
Big edwin in turn 3 happens once in every 10 games or more. You just have a negative bias because you can only remember the game where a big edwin crushed you and you dont remember the games you pulled dr boom on turn 7 or 6 with coin and played 6 omega devastators with rush. 
---
And amazing argument that only warrior is allowed to win by turn 15. Rogue is not an aggro deck, in fact, there is not a single aggro deck in the current meta (the only thing close is murloc shaman). If you don't know the difference between tempo and aggro that explains a lot.
---
Sure, but any deck where you're that reliant on one card is pretty feast or famine. If you're playing Bomb Warrior vs. aggro, a lot of times you're pretty effed by turn 7 if things aren't going your way.
---
"RoGuE nErFs = WaRrIoR NeRfS"
---
- everyone
---
All of you were wrong, and need to remember that next time you consider having a thought.
---
No one fucking cares, cripple your collection if you want.
---
Was always a broken card.
---
Yeah warrior has always had strong removal that they needed to build an actual deck around to make it to lategame. Now half their deck slots are literally hard removal and they commonly generate one of their strongest single delete cards that also get rush for another 4 mana to clear a second minion.
---
I've never seen warrior be such a chimp class it seems so bizarre how it's all of a sudden not just easy, but foolproof. When it used to be pretty tough and require a lot of management
---
Necromechanic is already borderline playable in the current mech hunter.  Dropping its cost to 4 will make it great.  3/6 is a good stat line for 4 mana anyway
---
Is it really losing your sanity when you were dominating basically everything that isn‚Äôt warrior though?
---
This might be in part due to how the class is very economical. Its decks have one or two legendaries at most, and  robust use of commons and rares
---
Rude
---
I know it's goofy, but I got a little star struck seeing you reply to my comment lol. Def hit me with your deck, I will be trying it.
---
Have they admitted that? I think hero cards are fine, it's just about ensuring they're not broken from a power perspective.
---
For anyone who has been playing a while and generally only dusts dupes, there are probably quite a few wild cards that could be dusted that have never/barely seen play in wild.
---
There is no need to just blindly dust every wild legendary, start with the epics and legendaries that don't make the cut and see where you get.
---
Kara is fucking bullshit. Turn 2 summon 10 drop.
---
Who design this should suck a bag of dicks.
---
I think the control mech pally will be insane with the new buffs, since it already is quite strong for off-meta reasons, and it contains every card that will be buffed.
---
[It will catch people off-guard pretty quick](https://gyazo.com/b8cc9bfcc71a3122699ae917c006495d)
---
Yea Luna‚Äôs is a good effect, but you still have no reliable way to draw it (especially since raven familiar rotated) so building your deck around it is too inconsistent
---
Ye i will keep some, like yogg and brann
---
It's an aggressive tempo deck but not aggro your right either murloc or zoo would be the most aggressive decks
---
Also i will not disenchant ANY rares or commons
---
It's live (EU) but it doesn't let me disenchant cards that changed for its full dust cost.

1/1/1 | Battlecry: Add a random Mage spell to your hand.  
---
there are 9 classes, are you seriously expecting exactly 11.11% playrate for each?
---
I'm not arguing the value, they've assigned the price/pack since the game released and this follows the standard value for bundles.
---
It does come with a card back (which, admittedly, nobody will use) and an amazing hero skin, but that doesn't mean it isn't milking. The community is willing to pay for these so go for it, but you can't deny there's been a significant increase in bundles the past year and a half, likely because of the slowly declining playerbase.
---
Buffed cards don't give dust refunds, that would make no sense.
---
Tuskarr Totemic also didn't summon any totem for me.
---
They aren't giving full dust for the buffs.
---
Most of the original leaders of team 5 are gone, they have new leaders and new directions. Tons of new team members and ideas are flowing.
---
Grabbel it
---
The cards are in their system and therefore should reflect the state of the card in the actual game.
---
Additionally, we have known for a couple weeks now that TGT would be in arena.
---
I'm glad they posted the tierlist asking for corrections and stuff, but I don't think a card going from 9 to 10 should be on that list...
---
Yeah, but in _most_ cases, I'd say every value has gone up in value per dollar. Just my opinion.
---
Without any other context that would obviously be a bug. The card could've been silenced, your hand could've been full... it's likely you missed something
---
"Wtf boss! unwanted interaction! There's a combo that can win you the game by turn 5!"
---
"Yes, we're aware of Giant-Conjurer's calling, we don't care."
---
"No, it's a Priest deck!"
---
"WHAT!?!? STOP THE PRESSES!!!"
---
Reminds me of the bug from the pre release stream, I guess Lackeys aren't in the list of cards allowed in this gamemode lmao
---
Vargoth is disenchantable though
---
I hate yellow and glowy things. I always use white lightbulb in my room.
---
If anyone knows, how large is the mobile patch? Thanks.
---
Has anyone tested necromechanic in deathrattle hunter? I‚Äôm pretty sure playing fireworks tech/nine lives will proc the deathrattle twice.
---
Just lost a game because I ended up playing a 2 mana 1/1 on turn 3. God fucking damn.
---
Ben brode leeft
---
Did you miss the part where the adventure isn't free? 
---
And I would dish out the money, except for the fact that I have absolutely no need for the packs. If they made the alternate heroes available as separate purchases I'd have no problem with it but instead almost every alternate hero we've gotten recently has been locked behind a bundle.
---
no lackeys work, conscripter deathrattles into none
---
Hehe
---
Is it limited?
---
It seems in general you rate 3/2s over 2/3s, like Bloodfen Raptor over Arcane Servant, when I think the general consensus is 2/3s are better right now (partly due to Hogsteed). This one is debatable.
---
Boneguard Lieutenant is oddly low in Rogue, 9 points below Raptor, when it has almost strictly upside. Also to a lesser extent in Warlock and Hunter. Perhaps something's wrong with evaluating hero powers/inspire (Justicar), in particular with Rogue/Warlock?
---
It doesn't specify, but I would assume so.
---
Nothing wrong with a quality of life update? Can't hurt. Yes it's easy, but why not just add it to make things a tad easier?
---
Can confirm. My Evil Miscreant didn't proc. My opponent gloated.
---
EMP operative might end up being offered more often than Fel Reaver! üòÖ
---
You make a good point with the Lackeys and Spare Parts, but I don't know if it'll really be possible to remove enough cards from their deck to matter before the 8/8 dies or kills you...
---
It's a free game. You can buy the adventure with gold. You're so entitled it hurts to read.
---
If you want it to be seen as a joke, make that a bit more obvious on the card itself.
---
Oh fuck, I feel like this is the time I give up on my "no paid heroes" policy. Thrall grew old, Morgl is lame and Rastakhan was behind a paywall and unavailable now. And it's GODDAMN THUNDER KING.
---
Offline PvE now, please.
---
I had the easiest run to legend a month ago with mech pala. It's amazing in a meta without silences
---
does this apply to wild too?  its way more likely to get the same person there already
---
In terms of winrate:
---
1. Hunter (52.1%)  
---
2. Mage (51.5%)  
---
3. Warlock (52.1%)  
---
4. Priest (51.1%)  
---
5. Druid (49.3%)  
---
6. Paladin (49.2%)  
---
7. Shaman (46.9%)  
---
8. Rogue (45.2%)  
---
9. Warrior (44.9%)
---
Must be; it just happened to me too.
---
Yeah, with the rat one
---
Huh, yeah and first I thought this just meant you don't face the same player twice in a row, but if it's actually making it hard to face the same class, that could have an effect on the meta - no more, "I've faced 5 hunters in a row, let's play X deck to get em."
---
The walking fountain has murlocs inside too (but thats top secret)
---

Flashback to this happening 3 months ago

Would be a nice Gift for clearing all 5 heroic levels with each class.

Yeah, same thing with EVIL conscriptor (the priest 2/2).

I don't usually like calling out small indie company, but fucking hell blizzard

* Players who are disconnected from Hearthstone due to an unstable connection, switching applications, or by locking their mobile devices will no longer be directed back to the login/launch screen when attempting to reconnect.

The game will now seamlessly reconnect in the background from any screen, instead of only during gameplay. This includes during deck editing, or while browsing the Collection Manager.

PRAISE YOGG
---
Ofc i was exaggerating, boom is not an auto win but is very close to it.
---
And getting 4+ omega devastators (you have 2 in your deck originally so your odds are not that bad) is not that uncommon, even yesterday at grandmasters we saw it happen.
---
This update broke deck tracker
---
She calls Chromaggus a traitorous whelp.
---
can someone paste for a sad worker peon?
---
It always shows that I'm going to fight Kizi Copperclip - even for Bob.
---
Yeah i couldnt get passed rank 3 with it and never seem to see it played at the highest levels. Is it just that its countered too easily and has no late game?
---
It sounds like you dislike quite a few big parts of hearthstone... But then wouldn't it make sense to just not play? 
---
I guess I misunderstood your idea of "grind" but generally it's something considered unpleasant and monotonous in video games. 15 wins can take a lot longer than 2 hours considering an average match is probably 10 minutes and you'd need to win them all to do it in just over 2 hrs on average. And I don't work even close to minimum wage so that's why I spend money, because dropping a few $ every so often is way better than grinding. My bad if that's not the case for you.
---
Did they edit the post?  I don't see them saying any thing about playing the same class multiple times now.
---
I logged in tried to open my pack and it froze. I demand packs!
---
My home page on the blizzard client for hearthstone is bugged and i dont see anything, just the background, thank you
---
Well, yes? Corsair is 1, and Expedite makes it cost 1 less...
---
Exactly.
---
Dammit i just wanted to play arena and now i can't even enter the game for like 40 minutes. Also i wasn't aware of the Lackey bug and i drafted evil miscreant and was extremely confused
---
And people tell me there's no power creep in hearthstone.
---
Then write in a ticket?
---
But I don't really care about the game tracking my stats when I'm doing a dungeon run, I just want to play even in the middle of nowhere or while on a train (I have no idea why my phone doesn't get any usable connection when the train is moving. Anyone know why?). If I want to unlock shit I can go online at that time.
---
Ill definitely try that. Floop can be amazing but so frustrating to draw when you only have squirrels in your hand.
---
Hey! Sludge Slurper and EVIL Cable Rat dont add lackeys to your hand! I can happily provide photo and video evidence!
---
yea it was f'd up - LAckey Bug
---
Did, it requires a ID and I dont have one..
---
No packs for us :&lt;
---
i drafted 3 evil geniuses :P Figured that out in a game. And then the opponent coined Evil miscreant the next turn LOL
---
Yes i am rather confident, but apparently snip snap was a rather recent idea that's why they didn't catch the synergy problem in priest. 
---
And that could have ripple effects for the other added buffs.
---
typical blizzard quality update
---
&gt; Rocket Boots for example is universally unplayed and isnt a direct buff to mechs so why was that not the card touched?
---
It's too boring, probably. There's no mana cost at which it's a health and interesting card, but they restricted themselves to only changing mana costs this time around.
---
lackeys are bugged since patch went live.
---
same happened to me with the evil conscripter
---
happening to me on ranked. Servers are just being flooded
---
Howdy
---
I have the weirdest bugs atm. I somehow received a free arena ticket (and no, not because I had an old deck from prepatch). I drafted a new deck post-patch and it suddenly got cancelled and I got a free ticket as a reward (and the pack+gold). Lol.
---
FREE DUST, fo real.
---
Also the UI and servers are just unresponsive even when I am in the game.
---
So did they reset it? Or is this another bug?
---
Lol, so everyone bitches about the game not being F2P friendly, so Blizzard starts releasing more bundles that are much more cost efficient. But then people start screeching about "being milked by all these bundles"
---
Your opponent possibly has multiple copies of either of those cards in hand, thus they are the only 2 different cards. You can't get the same option multiple times in the same discover
---
With the confirmation that this only affect player and not class (despite what the patch notes say), this change is awesome. The positives of getting a good matchup multiple times in a row was more than offset by the rage of getting a bad one.
---
I haven't beat chapter 4 yet, but it shows the crowns above the portraits for all heroes. It seems that the progression is shared between all chapters. Same thing happened in heroic.
---
You Satan
---
He could always try Control Warrior instead
---
\^ This guy gets it. The title was as if to say your opponent always has a Yogg. I didn't think people would take this title so seriously, and I didn't know there were so many touchy Soldier Of Fortune supporters here.
---
Great, now I don't have to hear that fucking innkeeper giving me a shitty greeting while shoving those dailies to my damn face. Gets really annoying when I need to tab out often (for example when answering my bosses) and it disconnects me after 2 seconds every. single. time.
---
Yes. Dump the entire thing and play a deck that requires thought.
---
I cant login, it shows all tables full, one should be available in 1 minute and when I restart, it's saying 2minutes. For the past half hour.

Buffing 18 cards is effectively a nerf to every other card. Therefore full dust for all other cards?
---
Nope, I just can't connect so I have no problems with lag :D
---
Android client isn't even updated in EU. Small indie company cant handle all these launches so close together
---
Oh well, sounds right. Didn't think about it. Thank you!
---
Same thing happened to me.  All hero's now have the crown even if I hadn't completed the chapter with them for every chapter
---
I have to say that I'm glad to see she got a promotion, working hard as one of the earlier bosses finally paid off.
---
Sure, if you also ignore the 20 packs you get at a reduced price
---
meanwhile 4 8/8s in mage turn 5
---
I know.  Just a lighthearted jab ;)
---
eu servers FEELSbADmAN
---
It is actually true. I am trying to run Arena since the patch and I got a refund three times (so this means that I got three free card packs )
---
Same with me
---
Ah cool. Thanks for telling me
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just jaded because I been spending money on this game since it came out and I‚Äôm pretty sick of it.
---
They just changed the sets from which you can draft, so every run that was still going was automatically retired.
---
Just FYI, that is a confirmed mistake in the patch notes. It is only same player: https://twitter.com/LegendaryFerret/status/1135614114959634433
---
Sometimes Tundra Rhino, could keep them from developing or if they don‚Äôt have removal you could have a meaty turn 6.
---
Ohw sorry yes you are absolutely right I was confused over what expedite did.
---
It's live on EUW
---
Is the post complaining about the price?
---
Lackey generation is bugged in arena right now
---
The 3rd heist (on Heroic) was a real pia for me.  The standard/normal heists have been easy
---
Oh, well that's depressing.
---
Which is bullshit because the game asks for an update before you can play...
---
Because is uncraftable, so you need to select include uncraftable cards.
---
Happened to me too. Wanted to cash in my arena reward.
---
Easily possible. You only need one strong class to go to legend.
---
You should quote the tweet to especially clear
---
And yet other games like Warframe don't lock cosmetics behind bundles.
---
Bundles should offer better value not time gate cosmetics.
---
not my screenshot. lmfao
---
Dude all the good mages use gaints don't try and deny that. I don't know about these other decks but every mage I've played has gaint conjured me maybe I'm just not lucky enough to face the other win conditions
---
I didn't say Togwaggle is the problem? I said that if the non Togwaggle variant is not having an issue then it sounds like the issue is not rogue. I'll widen that and say the issue is the lackey variant, not specifically Togwaggle.
---
And four Omega Devastators isn't that big of a deal. It's annoying, but number one it is unlikely, and number two if you took long enough to let them play four Devastators, then the issue is you and not them.
---
The winrate of the deck overall is around 60% which is lower than many previous meta decks, and will go even lower when more mechs fill the pool and you're more likely to get garbage. And the winrate when Devastator is played is not different than any other card in the deck, according to HSReplay. And that's across all tiers, as I don't want to pay for their stratifiers.
---
According to metastats.net, Warrior doesn't even make the top 5 decks in terms of winrate, and in fact is below a 50% winrate from rank 5-Legend. They counter Lock, Rogue, Shaman, go even with Pally, and lose to the other 4 consistently.
---
Aren‚Äôt both warrior cards receiving stat buffs, not mana?
---
Seems like it's working now, at least I can log in and access my collection properly
---
Depends what you mean by competitive.  You can make 1-3 legend viable decks just by dusting the bad cards you get on the 50-25 run.  More than that will take time or money.  You pay for variety in HS, not as much to simply be competitive.
---
You‚Äôre voting for something that‚Äôs not happening and has no reason to happen.  You‚Äôre not arguing for something that doesn‚Äôt simply make sense.  You‚Äôre arguing for free shit.
---
Though when viewing Archmage Vargoth, it does appear in the character screen, where SN1P SN4P does not.
---
I would spam "Aren't you a salty one" all day
---
Yeah, given how bubbly and peppy Hearthstone is, one sometimes forgets the source material can be a bit dour and self-serious
---
That happened to me a few times, you just tap it and it opens. The pack just goes invisible for some reason.
---
What do you mean competitive? Tournaments and such? That's gonna be hard af except you are like one of the 0,00001% best HS players. If you mean going legend, you can do that with a F2P deck and a few cards, but it's gonna be hard.
---
That‚Äôs nuts. They would have to be assuming that  we as players are incredibly stupid.
---
My other main game Smite for example. There are 100 gods now, each of whom have 6+ skins. I have never heard of a player complaint about not wanting to play because they‚Äôre too confused. 
---
And we are only talking about 9 heroes here and only talking about 1 more skin for them.
---
Is that really too much to ask of a gamer? In a game that has hundreds of cards they have to learn, maybe it‚Äôs safe to just assume that learning new things is part of Hearthstone?
---
I am pretty certain it‚Äôs not the case, and the real reason they don‚Äôt do it is because they want to charge people 10 dollars per picture, and giving some away for less would hurt the demand for the 10 dollar ones.
---
Works for me now.
---
Yeah, I kinda wonder how the game would have developed if they kept the same tone wow has and just remade all raids.
---
Because that's what makes it a horror
---
This is a visual bug and will be fixed. Source: Blizzard forums (CBA to link :D)
---
In arena?
---
Unless you want to immediately build multiple top tier decks despite being a new player who likely wouldn't be able get anywhere near their full potential out of them, you can get started reasonably fast and be competitive for free.
---
I've never spent a dime on the game and can build multiple top tier decks every expansion. I've started new accounts for fun to test out changes in the new player experience and have found I can always build competitive decks and climb high on the ladder really fast. And I never grind on any of those accounts. I just stay on top of most of my quests and manage my resources well.
---
Hearthstone is only expensive if you want to catch up or expand your collection really fast, want to build more meta decks than the average player probably has time to get any value out of, build off-meta/meme decks, or if you don't manage your resources properly and want to make up for it.
---
* Getting +2 on your hero power is essential. Especially for that last boss, your rushing 3/1's will take out her regenerating 6/3's. Also, look to mill her cards whenever possible. You usually beat her by taking her into fatigue.
---
* Other perks you want to get are +2 health on minions and/or heal for 2 each turn.
---
* You basically want to focus on minions that are taunts, are poisonous or generate tokens (preferably beasts) through a deathrattle. If you get spells, get ones that generate minions. You want to really focus on dominating the board and being able to reload a board after a wipe. Use your little guys to make value trades and snowball the board to victory.
---
You're probably not going to rush down Glinda. You want to grind her out of cards and take her to fatigue. So, you don't want to overextend your board as it will get wiped often. Manage your resources, mill her deck when you have a chance.
---
Managed to log in, got kicked into offline mode. Tried to log out and in again, gets stuck in queue. Sucks when you want to play with the "new" cards...
---
They agreed to buff 2 cards in each class. Neither of the warrior ones needed to be buffed, but they were. Maybe next time they will just buff cards that are bad instead of needing to be fair to each class.
---
Yes like half the fucking sub
---
They went over the 2 drop situation on the podcast. 2/3s are better if your opponent happens to have a hogrider or argent horseman. But otherwise, 3/2s are probably better because 3 drop power has dipped so much with rotation. A lack of 3/4s mean a 3/2 can contest most 3 drops, which will be 3/3s or 4/3s. The classic spider tank, argent crusader, and microtech controller are almost the only 3 drops a 3/2 can't contest.
---
RIP my inbox
---
And the main reason why Hunter is so good right now. Zul'jin is just bs, I deeply hate this hero because he allows the Hunter to win an already lost game.
---
I totally would appreciate it, if Blizzard would send Boom and Zul'jin to the hof.
---
Kinda ironic, considering one of the lines the innkeeper can say when you start the game is about there always being room for more at the inn
---
probably why we havent seen the mobile update released.
---
Everybody get in here! Oops. I mean hehe
---
I have played a lot of Hearthstone and I had quit a bit before Kobolds and Catacombs. Recently came back and with little to work with I went for good ol Zoo. Helped that I opened Rafaam first. In all my time of Hearthstone this was one of the craziest matches. Going from holding Rafaam in the mulligan, managing to steal his hero card with Lazul, to being near death with 9 bombs in my deck out of 16, to replacing all that with Elysiana, to managing to secure the game. Utterly insanity.
---
They could've made the boomship 8 mana, i don't think anybody would've cared.
---
There's currently a bug in Dalaran Heist (at least in Wing 3, which is what I was playing) where the listed boss is different than who you actually fight. For instance, my second fight was supposedly to be against Marelei Loom but instead it was against Akazamzarak. Thought you guys ought to know.
---
Well it‚Äôs either that or they want to reserve Hero portraits for actual hero characters versus made up small characters.
---
...and I would believe what I just said above if it weren‚Äôt for portraits like Nemsy and Morgle
---
What kind of logic is that? The other variant is not having an issue because he other variant is trash, simple as that. There is a reason why tess rogue the same trash as plot twist warlock.
---
I just stopped reading when u said 4 omega devastators are not a problem, jesus christ dude. The entire playerbase, most of grandmasters players and almost everyone except warrior mains consider the card completely busted due to being so easily random generated and all the rush due to dr boom passive and im supposed to believe in you because you say the card is fine.
---
As a f2p player myself i can Say that it is very possible to stay f2p and still be competitive
---
There are some decks that are budget friendly for example Wild mech hunter ~1600 dust for whole deck (4 legendaries or 1 golden legendary that you will get from up comming event) that deck got me from rank 25 to 5 in 3 days
---
Pro tip btw :
---
If you want more expensive deck do daily quests and keep your eye for promotions and events
---
What does it matter what another game does unless it's a direct competitor?
---
The bundles already do offer a better value for money and attach cosmetics to sweeten the deal. They have no incentive to offer them for free when people are clearly placing significant value on them.
---
president-bashing person asking for something that doesn't make sense, even when they know it doesn't make sense. shocking.
---
You can only play against people playing the the same version as you so in this case other unupdated mobile players
---
Could have gave it +1 or +2 attack for that turn or something. I dont know, I just know that card needs help, their mechs do not
---
I have a hard time connecting; I manage to connect, build an immortal prelate deck and queue.
---
I start the Game: I find myself playing a secret paladin deck. wHAT?
---
Lost the game, can't connect back (see sentence 1)
---
If a deck type needs one treasure to win and not Suck balls...  I am not really in. 
---
The priest with -2 Attack Hero Power is awesome and unbeatable when you get the treasure you talked about.  So..  Why would i Play bomb warrior when every other warrior is better and other classes can use the needed treasure even More,  it's just a bad archtype.
---
That's some incredible crazy code. As the lackeys are from Rise of shadow, if they are from some hidden 'token' set, how the hell they separate the card sets and tokens...?
---
Is this an identity theft joke?
---
I really, really want Kael'thas. One of my favorite characters in WC3.
---
for me it's not even giving the option to update and I'm on android as well
---
Ya, the rank 50 thing put real decks starting at 25.
---
Perhaps it's just reckless experimenter.
---
Thanks Blizzard for (in)consistency.

Yep, it was played at the early times of the game because there were simply not enough cards. If your strategy revolved arround a sticky board, this was the only 3 drop that allowed you that. Its also why things like Yeti were good at that time.
---
As more cards get released, even if they were badly stated, synergies would arise and those simple, really narrow cards without text like yeti would just get played way less. Same with harvest golem, he was decent but now its mech synergies and deathrattle synergies arent even enough to make him viable.
---
I WAS PLANNING ON PLAYING ALL NIGHT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
That is lei shen
---
Any response from Blizzard or????
---
No question about it, it's shit. But it's the kinda shit that's really satisfying when it does it's thing.
---
Did you get the ticket? I checked and my old run is still there
---
If EU somehow gets to share playerbase with NA then americans won‚Äôt ever manage to hit legend and there will be salt fiesta on this subreddit. EU is a significantly stronger region and the two have to be separated.
---
It would basically kill cyclone mage. Taunt is the only thing keeping you from getting annihilated by hunters and rogues.
---
You‚Äôve just enlightened me after 5 years of thinking it was a snake
---
Seems to be fixed now.  Just had an opponent get a lackey off sludge slurper.
---
How about applying it to my current Arena run, and if not able, you do the bare minimum and refund us our bugged ones?
---
Same in Windows FeelsBadMan
---
you may have some connection issues because turns doesn't end randomly in the middle of turn without rope.
---
What does Fruit of the Loom have to do with this?
---
Sort your shit out blizz
---
I would love to test if the summoning portal mechwarper combo still works as it used to, but EU is down :(
---
I really hope they didnt changed this. They created all the naga problem because of making reduced hand costs consistent, and thats why instead of making naga just the exception they decided to keep the consistency and nerf it with an increased mana cost. If they want to nerf reckless (for wild too) doing this kind of stuff is not really good. I think is better than making reckless 8 mana or killing mechwarper effect, I like those cards a lot, but making the rules inconsistent is not really the approach I would take.
---
I thought he was talking about why the card he received wasn't showing.
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt say anything about warriors and hunters, I agree they are too strong. As you say mages have one good gimmick and if you tech against it they got nothing.
---
Can't even get into the game lmao
---
So it's confusing because...? You get to always see the hero power. And you see the class under the potrait at the beginning of the game.
---
FML, I have off tomorrow. Hyped af to play through the night and now what? So disappointed.
---
Time to beat your ass son
---
So [[Ice Fishing]] is just freeing those murlocs?
---
Its a skin. Its the best kind of content to be kept behind a paywall. 
---
I just don't like the 'limited time offer' aspect of it
---
The buffed cards are too strong now, they have overtaken Blizzard and now are holding their employees hostage.
---
And NOW it's even more later now! :(

2/-/- | Draw 2 Murlocs from your deck.  
---
Or just clear the lich king and keep drawing
---
Mage only has two alts
---
and he/she is abrasive and likes petty name-calling. shocking.
---
Exactly! Especially in the murloc shaman meta.
---
I don't think it would keep poisonous when respawned
---
You dont, but sometimes you have double battlecries and ya get what ya get
---
I've tried it out and it's not that great. Gets run-over easily by Hunters and Zoo. Jade Druid is far superior because Druids have more healing, more taunts, more Jade activators, and more ways to draw those cards.
---
Yeah, Zilliax is an insane heal/tempo turn;
---
With say a 13-13 pogo (reasonable) A pogo/zilliax turn means:
---
-6 mana
---
-heal 16
---
-kill a huge minion(or any minion)
---
And of course, it leaves a 16-15 lifesteal on board.
---
That's a HUGE tempo play, you get like 20-25 mana worth of stuff at once.
---
Sure it only has that one heal, but it's such a big one... There aren't many classes that can heal/armor for more than 10-20 in a game.
---
Arch mage antonidis
---
&gt; It sounds ridiculous, but from a high level perspective, a player logging in for the first time in a year and queuing up against a flurry of portraits that they don't recognize could be off-putting.
---
What do you think is more off-putting: queuing up against a portrait you don't realize, then mousing over their hero power and realizing it's just a different skin for a hero you've played against multiple times...
---
Or playing against brand new sets of cards, which have brand new mechanics that are not always intuitively understandable, which release in the hundreds every 3 months?
---
If new players can deal with the latter, there is absolutely no reason to think they would struggle with the former. None.
---
I feel like Vargoth isn't worth it in this deck, you're only running 7 spells and Kangors + Vargoth is 11 mana
---
So smug and pompous 
---
*I love it*
---
No issues for me.
---
Loatheb and Zilliax.

They're ugly as sin. Most of the card art doesn't have a color palette designed around having an extremely bright yellow border, and the human eye's perception of color changes drastically depending on which colors are surrounding it. Then they apply a bunch of swirlies and sparklies that cover the card art, some really tacky "flash animation" style rotations or warping, and often they'll vastly increase the contrast of the image to make it "cooler" or something. Not only do you not get the nice weathered class/neutral card background, but the art itself gets completely vandalized.
---
Filthy Android player patiently waiting with you
---
I mean they could have buffed rocket boots if they wanted to buff something in warrior, but those two are kind of the only other options since the everything else in boomsday already sees play for warrior.
---
What do you do if you didn't open a WotOG pack then? Buy it with real money?
---
Hes on the draw so he wont have it,
---
Barnes on 3 on the other hand.
---
&gt; in testing?
---
Pretty sure Blizzard """testing""" is just some aggressively feminine gay dudes sipping white wine and taking notes about how they feel about each card as its played.
---
Soooo, why isn‚Äôt there another Hunter skin? I feel like there‚Äôs so many fun options for hunter, but it is still neglected
---
Thunderhead was so good with 2 Mana flametongue :o

I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs good. But it‚Äôs fun. And some people like to have fun when they play. Adding 1 fun card isn‚Äôt a big deal but some people are bad at the game and need to take their frustrations out on someone to feel better about themselves. That‚Äôs what this person is doing to OP.

Also important to note that metas are different at different rankings. A number of niche deck builds that can beat tier 1 decks actually lose to tier 2-3 decks but just rely on never running into them at certain levels.
---
No way, Jade Druid is far superior. Jade only requires you to play 1 jade card to buff the jades. Pogo requires at least 2 + time to draw another Pogo. Rogue does not have many ways of surviving the early/mid game long enough to generate large Pogos without compromising that game plan. As a Rogue how are you suppose to beat an aggro Mech Hunter or Zoo opening and also start to play your Pogos + shuffle them + draw them.
---
I'm all for player friendly content and this bs alienation through pre-orders and shit like Nemsy / Khadgar are predatory. If they had the option to buy in store after a period it would alleviate some of this pressure. I agree they should keep exclusivity to season card backs. Then, add the ability to buy cardbacks and give the people who owned the previous version golden / tinted versions of them to show prestige.
---
And it‚Äôs shocking that you can‚Äôt own up to your own mistake and continue to make generalizations.
---
Eat grape shot mongrel
---
&gt;You're exactly right and I feel the same way, which is why I didn't call them greedy or anything in the comment
---
Oh okay sorry. Again: In both this subreddit and others, most people making comments like yours lack that self-awareness. It really sucks.
---
&gt;but it's the players' fault if anyone decides to complain.
---
I'm glad we're pretty much on the same page here. Though I do want to say, at least when it comes to arguing with people, it's imo worth conceding that a company DOES take some responsibility. Just not all of it.
---
&gt;If people eat up these low effort bundles and reskins, then by all means, take advantage
---
Well it's like the typical "unlocked door + burglar" example. The consumers are the ones who leave their door unlocked and in fact intentionally leave out more valuables for the burglar. But that doesn't make the burglar much more justified in doing what they're doing.
---
And yes I'm aware it's far from a perfect analogy but the point is, Blizz doesn't HAVE to take full advantage of people forking over money for anything.
---
You talk as though all buffs are of equal magnitude. Its possible to use large buffs on weak cards to make them very strong, as one can use small buffs on strong cards to make them very strong. There's no relationship between the original power level of the card, and the power level of the card after applying a buff.
---
This might make sense if you were talking about decks, or archetypes.
---
I am dumpster rank 5 so that makes sense
---
I am devastated. I only just got to 500 wins with Shaman, I wanted to take a screenshot of Morgl going gold... but then I realized I finished the game as Hagatha. Ruined. :(
---
This also seems to be a bug for me that EVERY encounter shows as Wendy, including the hero power so i have no idea what im fighting
---
Thank you for elaborating on what I wrote. Cheers!
---
sure, let me just finish my run full of 2 mana 2/2's with a downside
---
it's going to be a great experience, thanks blizz
---
They said they were planning on adding more lackeys in later sets so they probably just created an actual lackey "set" to dump them all in instead of manually coding each lackey generator. 
---
It's not a bad way to do it honestly, but completely forgetting you have a lackey set *literally during the expansion where you made the lackey set* is indefensible.
---
I play on an iMac and the game freezes immediately upon launch. Game won‚Äôt move past tavern doors. No error messages or anything either.
---
No
