Everyone is top 100 legend.
---
---
---
Fuck Priest, the only light you need in your life is RNGesus!
---
Generally the newest one, Rise of Shadows. At some point though work your way through the other expansions at least until you get the first legendary.
---
Kill self, start over?
---
Also true. I auto concede when getting Rogue unless it's Tempo Rogue, auto concede when getting Patron Warrior and mostly concede when getting Pavel's Druid. Those decks are just too weak and are outvalued/outtempo'd by stronger decks.
---
Good response, I got mine over a year ago and am still afraid to post about it here. Thank you for giving us all golden nerds a platform!
---
Even though Roger got what he deserved, I can never get behind twitch chat's...*horde* mentality.
---

---
But seriously, even though in this case it was an actually bad person that's getting flamed, chat constantly harasses players who simply did not play well and bandwagons onto often unfounded "predictions" of the outcome of matches...this case is an extension of that first, "justice" second.
---
That thing... it scares me...
---
Also single player so no rope

It's especially satisfying if you have spell damage on board.

Pretty sure I've tried and gotten nothing.

Sending my prayers up now

WOLVERINES

Dalaran mage is a classic 3 mana 1/4 with spell damage so its still possible!
---
Pretty sweet
---
... is it really??
---
Did you look at the previous thread you posted and take the advice from that?
---
Nice! I hit Legend today too for the first time in 4 years with Mecha'thun Warrior!
---
nice
---
I did something similar with Mana Addict and 0 Cost Unstable evolutions. Killed the final boss turn 4.
---
Ee
---
I’m really really struggling with token Druid vs Warrior. I know TD, I know how to mulligan vs each enemy deck type, I know when to play what. I’m not a pro by any means but I have a solid understanding of TD.
---
I struggle vs Warrior. I win maybe 1 out of 5 games vs Cont Warr at best. He has 6 board clears. It’s really hard to get minions to stick.
---
What deck is a control warriors nightmare right now? I need a different deck to get me past rank 12.
---
There are always many turns before the final turn that ends the game. Also, all card games have RNG bulit into the game.
---
Let’s get this bread friends
---
Thanks in advance!!!
---
Thanks for the chance at winning! Good luck everyone.
---
This way there no need to give to Appple or Google a large part of the money while they just are doing nothing.
---
I mean the /s for true. I think his lineup was a great read.
---
No.  The decks that are strong are strong because they have good cards.  The meta is more about what you should play to counter things/what you should tech.
---
Make more decks
---
YES!
---
Solo only escaped because he was the first real example of it, and valve hadn’t explicitly stated any rules. From that point on, match fixing in professional games earns you a permanent ban from all valve sponsored events.
---
the chance of you getting it on a tess deck is way lower than warrior so its fine
---
I thought token druid is like favored against control/bomb warrior?
---
Ohhh. Mb mb ahaha. The only thing I didn't like in his lineup is that fact that he's banking on winning all warrior mirrors, and if he drew boom second it was insta-loss.
---
For the card game comparison, your points are all true, but how much of that is negated by the fact we get free cards for simply playing the game? That's a pretty big difference between physical card games and Hearthstone. We can craft at the very least one tier one deck by just playing through an expansion. 
---
Though to be fair, I'm not super jazzed about the value of the preorders either.
---
&gt; The pre-rotation meta was much more diverse. The current meta is just less polarizing, especially combo decks have more counterplays.
---
But it didn't feel more diverse &amp; to some people that matters more. It matters more to me. The even &amp; odd decks plus quest rogue were in the meta for a year straight. The matches felt similar. The new meta may be dominated by a few decks, but the decks have so much more apparent variance that it makes it feel better.
---
Oh man, what a well written explaination. Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. Goodluck to you too!
---
I the that hes still super favored. Orange/Feno mock tournament had it consistently winning games with boom second. Even against BloodyFace he would have won if any other minion won that brawl I think.
---
Trump teachings specifically may be more useful as it’s to the point and much more focused, should be better for a player with largely basic cards.
---
Not enough Omega Assembly
---
No I understand that there would be some confusion in wild and I’m not denying that. I’m just saying that it wouldn’t be as bad as you’re making it out to be. And you’re assuming way too much to be as cocky as you are. It’s not that op doesn’t give a fuck about wild so much that he doesn’t have a feasible way to completely remove any confusion. His rotation idea helps in standard and leaves wild with the same issue so that takes care of half of the problem. I see no reason to shoot down a nice idea just because you’re gonna get confused when barely even paying attention to the game.
---
Good god you don't even have to scroll like with most arena decks. Absolutely gross
---
&gt;Your complaints are null.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;  Also, not all revealing of the hand means BM. But even if it was, so what?
---
Are they null or are they not? Saying "not all revealing of the hand means BM", implies that they could use it as BM and my complaints stand, am I wrong? So, to answer your question of "so what?", the answer is simple: toxicity. How much toxicity is acceptable to your client? How my client feels about X or Y? Is it really necessary? Toxicity outweights in certain games and lose players because of that. Also, I must add, when you're already in higher ranks you should assume what your opponent is playing and what cards he has in hand, unless he is playing a meme deck or something new.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Whether you think somebody is an asshole or not shouldnt be relevant as to whether somebody should be willingly allowed to show their hand to you. 
---
You know when someone is BMing you, even with the emotes and this also connects to the first thing I said in this reply.
---
And now about the Emotes. Some people want an "Auto-Squelch" option, what do you think about that? And many people Squelch at the very beginning of the game. In games that make you think (lol thinking in HS kappa), people just want a silent game. Heck, I remember that Pokémon Showdown (fan made), added "ignore spectators" and "ignore opponent", so people have a better experience while laddering. So why they have not removed emotes? Maybe because toxicity is not that high and Squelching just fixes it.
---
I also want to add that the change of UI that Blizzard made, I have seen less "friend" requests. Small changes can do a lot.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Hope this is true !
---
Only cultured Canadians!
---
Oh no...
---
See all I want to know is what defines legend vs being a pro.
---
Though I suppose that could be googled.  Brb
---
Definitely not true...did you play during frozen throne cause some DKs were situational (for example rexxar)
---
That point aside, having it the way it is now makes it so classes that have hero cards *cough* dr. Boom *cough* win on draw without others having that opportunity.
---
Rushinion
---
I think removing the passive rush effect could also be a way to go. All mech having rush is just way too efficient.
---
I’d find this funny, but this guy thought trading was a mechanic so this seems more cruel than anything else. But while we’re at we may as well tell him about the secret power of having an all legendary deck (your hero power becomes a one mana “summon a random legendary minion”)
---
Right? Yet the dude still gets upvoted for talking gibberish...
---
Ahhh, so you have no idea how card games work. Makes sense
---
I’ll roll the dice
---
[removed]
---
i never feel lucky
---
I've seen it both ways, I remember when mtg was in its fledgling days of transitioning to online play, and people complained about the "shuffling"
---
To answer your question, if a skilled player gets a lucky win, then that's great.  All players get lucky wins, just as all players get unlucky wins.  Theres no point in complaining about luck in any situation,  because it's not something anyone can control. In fact, the skilled players make decks that take advantage of luck when they have it, and mitigate the adverse effects of bad luck when it comes their way.
---
Yes, 6 card it says it right there.
---
Or 3, it depends.
---
Awesome dude! Got a list?
---
Played all expansions since Frozen Throne.  A lot of matches, especially against Aggro, came down to if you drew your Death Knight. (Jaina/Malfurian/Guldan).  Rexxar really wasn't a problem for the first year as Hunter didn't have a viable deck and aggro would push them over.  (Heck, even Control/Cube Warlock just sucked them to death)
---
They've explicitly said they want to cut back on infinite resource generation.  (Hence Twinspell).  But some pseduo DK's are left over (Boom/Hagatha) and one just isn't as powerful and feels "fair" (Zuljin).  
---
Future hero cards will be like Zul'jin, not Boom/Hagatha, if we get them at all. (probably not for a while)
---
Seriously this is embarrassingly bad
---
&gt; can be dealt with if you draw properly  
---
  
---
I mean, a lot of decks can be countered by another deck if one draws properly, right? lol
---
Listen bro.  When Undertaker Hunter was popular, the meta didn’t matter.  It WAS the meta.  It was so powerful that the only other decks that could be played were counters to it.   What was being played didn’t matter to that deck because it beat everything.
---
The same thing applied to Patron Warrior.  The same thing currently applies to rogue.
---
You can be smug all you want, but if you think the meta is what’s making rogue (which currently has the best class cards in the game by a landslide) good, YOU don’t understand shit.
---
Comment
---
Yes, the distribution at rank 25 and rank 5 is different, but the distribution at rank 25 is the same for everyone.  Also, below rank 10, the deck you play is pretty unimportant, so playing Rogue from rank 25 to legend is the easiest thing to do.
---
Free packs? Count me in. MalorneGang.
---
With my luck that would mean the board now has 2 Hir'eeks instead of 1.
---
you can extend this logic to every single card. all class should have armor gain, heal, buff, hand buff, spell generation.... 
---
"warrior doesn't have heal. it's unfair. they should give something like holy fire or binding heal to all classes. it would be fair."
---
If he had such a terrible lineup, why did the casters make a point of mentioning the other players had to practice against his decks to attempt a win? He saw the meta, crafted decks counter to Control Warrior, and really just saw a lot of bad RNG in his bloodyface match.
---
So warrior gets an awesome hero card for another year and 5 of the other classes get none, and if they do get one they will be underpowered in comparison.
---
Sounds fair 👍🏻 👍🏻 👍🏻
---
Maybe that just means we need a sub strictly for discussion of the the current meta?  /rcompetitivehs or maybe we could call it /rhearthstonemeta
---
Do we want the main sub to be a safe place for deck discussions and advice?  Do we want those discussions to have their own sub?
---
I also feel like /rcompetitivehs isjust a place to find coaches.  I feel theres no good place to discuss decks, strategy, and skills/get advice
---
Same. Had no idea he cheated, just genuinely liked his deck ideas and mentality crafting decks.
---
If that's the case, then you could tech against it.
---
Running some AOE or that 2 mana 3/2 deal 1 damage to all minions when you cast a spell.
---
I'm not playing token druid, if that helps. Lol
---
what do you mean? Are you talking about the the classic packs? I got my RoS packs for watching 4 hours
---
For Azeroth!
---
Yup
---
Fair answer, thanks.
---
I'm still not even sure how the drops work tbh, I've been watching all of it since day 1 and only ever got a single pack.
---
Dont forget the second zilliax
---
That led me directly to an unfortunate RKelly joke territory...
---
Anyone have the announcer's Weibo or Instagram?
---
Check out Regis killbin too. He is a streamer that posts a lot of YouTube videos of cheap decks that can take you relatively far. He is by far my fav streamer with kibler in 2nd.
---
Like they’d never ever win without it?  Untrue.  
---
You could take that same card, put it in the worst class in the game (Priest?  Paladin?) and that class instantly becomes the best.
---
Every class has enough decent cards that one insane card can push them over the edge.  
---
Take Paladin.  Secret Paladin isn’t bad because the meta pushes it out.  It’s bad because it’s a bad deck.  It runs out of steam.  You give them divine favor back and it is instantly a tier 1 or tier 2 deck.
---
There are times where things can be pushed out by meta.  Nomi Priest is a good example of that.  Nomi Priest is very powerful, but not in a fast meta...that said, if it had psychic scream and shadow visions still in the deck, it probably would be an okay deck.
---
Often, the meta affects how good a deck is to que up on ladder...but not having strong enough cars or having blatantly overpowered cards definitely effects a decks power level too.

I really like this.  I feel like it's unfair that warrior sacrifices their hero power in order to get card advantage but their net armor gain actually increases.  A trade of would be more interesting.
---
Legend with zoo without soularium?? amazing.

 I don't dare make the legend climb without having all the cards that go with the deck. The climb is hard enough as it is without making substitution due to not having a card.

---
Does the 4 hours for the pack have to be just in one sitting? Does it count for the rebroadcast?
---
Yeah, like how people forgave Reynad...
---
That'd be cool. With omega assembly and the tools to reach late game even at this early stage, giving all mechs rush is too much. 
---
Any other kind of warrior just doesn't stand a chance. I was hoping for dragon warrior personally...

I am not a fan of where the team took Priest this expansion. Not many people loved the resurrect stuff, so why did they double down on it in a fresh year? That heal archetype you mention is something that has not been done well to my knowledge, and to me it seems like the one thing a Priest would look to be doing. If it had more card support I think it would be super fun and very similar to a Mage deck with large minions. 
---
I'm also seriously not a fan of Divine Spirit or Inner Fire. To me they feel like cheesy combo cards and less like board control cards. To me they hurt the game substantially and keep Priest from getting better cards for fear of breaking the game. I would love for them to be moved to hall of fame and allow Priest to get new archetypes but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  
---
Where most classes have a similar feel in how you achieve a win, whether it be through board control, late game power, or aggresion, Priest to me feels like the only class that doesn't do any of them well right now, and I don't like what RoS tried to do with the class.
---
How

EU Lifewiz#3571 80g trade. I show and you go first\~
---
I find it much more exciting to watch, and honestly, everyone had the same time to prepare and adapt to the new meta post rotation and make their lineups accordingly.
---
Sure, they are not as refined as a 3 months beta, but then again, makes it much more exciting to watch.
---
Stat lines, synergy, and card draw are important to varying degrees.
---
Three hero cards* And only one is run in the top decks, hint, it’s not Dr boom.
---
Reminded me of A. F. Kay.
---
Rise of Shadows has lots of great cards.
---
Rastakhan Rumble sadly is the Grand Tournament in terms of power level. Just buy your guaranteed legendary in first 10 packs and craft any cards you really want.

Witchwood also has some nice stuff in it.

I hope to win this and that it would have good packs this time.
---
Thank you
---
I was out visiting family and just got a chance to read through all the linked content. That was a lot to digest. Here’s my take in addressing why Roger isn’t permabanned.
---
There’s several differences with the RenMai practice which strikes me as important. The Chinese RenMai practice was an organized pay for “performed” loss in order to secure ladder ranks (or legendary rank for less consequential wintrading). There were monetary transactions in real life and a network of individuals engaged in the practice, performing the pay to lose service repeatedly. This practice had far-reaching implications for the competitive Hearthstone scene in China and undermined the legitimacy of HCT points from ranked ladder. Where proof of wintrading was available, the accounts were permabanned.
---
The RenMai practice in China should not be equated to Roger/Reall wintrading. First, there’s no evidence of Reall paying Roger to lose. Second, there’s no evidence that Roger and Reall are part of any organized wintrading ring. Lastly, and most importantly, the wintrading in question seemed to be isolated to a single, albeit highly important, period at the end of a season. In contrast, the RenMai wintrading appears to have operated on a massive scale, distorting not just a single placement but the entire system. For these differences, I would expect there to be different outcomes in sanctions from Blizzard.
---
The situation with Naiman, Alchemixt and others appear more similar with the Roger/Reall wintrading. We are missing a lot of pieces however, especially regarding the extent of wintrading involved with the bans. I want to note that an individual’s account is a separate entity from that individual, at least to Blizzard. I infer this because while the accounts were permanently banned, the individuals themselves were merely barred from the Championship for that particular year. The punishment issued to the individual appears analogous. As to why the accounts were permabanned in one case and not the other might be answered by the missing pieces, but going down that route is highly speculative.
---
Specialist seems like an ass who doesn’t play well with others. Clever enough to exploit the matchmaking algorithm at a lower playerbase. Not enough information there to make any analytical conclusions compared to Roger/Reall.
---
The bot wintrading thing seems largely irrelevant to our analysis, as that sounds more like a gold farming operation at low ranks. Permabanning the account appears appropriate action to me here.
---
Given my analysis above, I think that Blizzard has been fairly consistent when it comes to individual cases of wintrading, i.e. banned from World Championship or its equivalent, Grandmasters for one occasion. Roger’s ban is delayed, but that seems to be due to an internal Blizzard thing. No idea why the accounts were left intact in one instance but not another, but we don’t know the extent of wintrading that occurred in the account banning scenarios, whereas we only know of one season where it happened with Roger. So I don’t mind the punishment assigned to Roger given the previous punishments issued to wintraders you listed.
---
fuck warriors....
---
he played it safe that last game. I do think he could maybe have coin + hagatha scheme instead of hecklebot on the game vs zoo
---
Unlike all the other "look i just made legend!" posts, yours won't make the front page because you mentioned bomb warrior.

I mean, zuljin is kind of like a spell, as his hero power is pretty meh as compared to the other 2.
---
You clearly don't understand the purpose of having different classes each with different tools available...
---
I've been playing since open beta.  Early on I used to see people raging about "broken" decks, so I figured rather than complain, let's craft the "broken" deck and see what the big deal is.  When you do that, you find out really fast just how weak the deck really is.
---
I remember an early mill deck that people were raging about like crazy.  It was fun when it worked, but 2/3rd of the time I'd lose without my opponent ever realizing I had a "broken" mill deck.
---
I believe [[EVIL Miscreant]] should be a 1/4. It normally gets bounced back to hand or transformed into a 4 mana minion the next turn. I think it’s much more reasonable to produce 4 damage than 5 by turn 3 or 4.

Probably looks like a budget version at a glance, but I've performed far better without hagatha/scargil. This is the deck I ended up with after making 16 different versions. I'm currently top 1000 legend and still performing pretty well.

I've played about 75 games of control warrior this season and still haven't managed to pull a second zilliax 😪

NA 80g quest wadss#1527 i show, you go first.

My suggestion for that is to make [[Raiding Party]] 4 mana, similar to how Hunter uses [[Wing Blast]]. It makes it 1 mana instead of 0. Rogue already has access to many 0 mana spells.

If I said it was heal druid would you believe me? (It's not)
---
I quite like the flavour of it being random, but I agree balance should come first. Maybe if it was just you can't have the same one happen twice within three hero powers (so if you get discover you can't get it again for another 2 turns).
---
yes, everyone here has a boner for control decks
---
with all what you said, isnt it more natural to conclude that rush and lifesteal (which was introduced much later on) was what push DK Rexxa? until near the end of KOTFT, the discover pool was extended. 
---
Hunter can discover as many big ass beast as they can, but with though immediate and sustaining impact, it doesnt do jack shit in late game. I remember back in Ungoro, it cannot even out value control decks despite having Rexxa active for more than 10 turns.
---
It may be true that most of the people " sucks " but I prefer to say they're still " learning " the game . 
---
I'm playing since the beginning , I got legend this month too but if I can tell you something it's that it's harder to get legend because hearthstone is more RNG than before and they are move in the game that most class can't beat or some match up that feel way more one sided than before.
---
And you can't blame the players for that , since the beginning , pro players are asking for less RNG but it's not what make blizzard make more money.

i'm sorry but when I see deck like mage where you've to manage golem turn 4 or your game is over by turn 5 because of khadgar + conjurer's value that's stupid.
---
turn 4 you've +4 mana value then turn 5 : 4x8 + khadgar that mean 30 mana value in turn 5 and the only response to that ? brawl or doomsayer + frost nova.
---
I don't mind loosing if i'm making mistakes , even little one but right now , the game is decided even before you can make the decision making because of unbalanced scenario.
---
still reached legend because it's not about skill but about how much you spam the game.

---
I see, thanks.
---
dude, stop asking for more aggro nerfs. aggro has been nerfed so much that now the fastest decks are not even aggro. "huge hit to aggro decks" what aggro decks? except the always existing zoolock we haven't had any aggro decks for years. they don't even print any good 1-2 mana minions to keep aggro dead.
---
3 mana deal 2 twice to minion isn't terrible at least. Not quite an omega devastator but not totally awful.
---
&gt;a lot of time
---
Zilliax sees play in like 60% of the decks on ladder right now... And most of them aren't even running Mechs. That's my point.
---
Okay I will do thanks
---
I've already opened my 4-hour pack.
---
🎉
---
You can't actually get the same hero power 3 times in a row.
---
That is changing it lol
---
God damn I believed in BunnyHoppor and so far he's been proving me right. Give me all the packs!!!
---
Let's give it a shot
---
Run geddon or some sort of sweeping strikes combo to tech for tokens/zoos 
---
Mecha paladin is honestly one of the biggest counters in the game just gg most of the time
---
Hunter isnt as hard as mechadin but still pretty rough - consider a tinkmaster overspark to delay nine lives
---
Big shaman has suprisingly few threats- hard mull for spot removal and pray you keep drawing into it
---
Control and bomb are different decks and the consensus (in the west at least apparently) is control tends to win the mirror but honestly its fairly even - the best idea for bomb is to unload a massive swing of bombs near the end (1 or 0 left in deck) so its all as one burst and they draw them all before they can delete it with archivist and to mount pressure from there now theyre down a tonne of health. Either you want them to give up fatigue by dropping archivist too early or to nuke them not dilute it.
---
Dies to doom blade. Unplayable.
---
I guess just try an off meta deck for each class for your 500th. Thief rogue, Lady in white priest, dragon paladin and so on.
---
im guessing my chances are pretty low but why not.
---
2 out of 4 players in the semifinals don't have a warrior deck.
---
Maybe Dr. Boom&amp;co. aren't too op, like I read everywhere. I suspect that, in the new competitive format,
---
warrior will be even more targettable by sideboard tech cards and won't be the dominant deck - at least for the first part of the year of the dragon.
---
Why not both?
---
Y not ziliax first?
---
Ah so just because we dont post every 12 wins arena  and dont treat it like instagram for hearthstone we are miserable
---
The top decks are aggro wtf
---
Epic gamers
---
Thats a relief because it would be endless otherwise
---
Isn't that table incorrect? Sadly, Viper won 3 games, not Bunnyhopper.

---
This is the deck I ended up using pretty much the whole time. I didn’t have soularium or crystallizers so I probably would replace Ooze and Taskmasters with those if I had them. 
---
Warrior was probably the toughest. Warpath and Brawl are really good against how this deck goes wide
---
He also has a really quick playing style that I personally enjoy, has great knowledge about the game and all the classes (not just rogue), and multitasks chat and playing on a high level constantly. Best current streamer by a mile imo
---
DiegoBrando#11386 NA   Looking to trade 80g quest. You go first
---
Watched that a bit ago, good for her
---
Well Met!
---
Zilliax is simply too strong and needs a nerv 
---
2/2 would be ok i guess
---
Counting that every 5 posts one it's a complain about Warrior/Rogue/meta deck yes
---
Yeah it’s an unfavorable matchup unfortunately. What usually worked for me was mulliganing hard for a perfect opening hand and try to explode out of the gate. Then keep in mind every turn how much damage Warpath can do each turn (2 damage on Turn 4 for example) and don’t over extend on Turn 5 (Brawl). Those are really the only cards that save him so if you try to play around them, you give yourself the best chance
---
AWOOO
---
I've watched like 8 hours total, my account is correctly linked and there's still no RoS pack showing up anywhere. I hate that kind of reward system.
---

How did you get three malygeese?
---
Maybe there could be a weekly stickied thread about the various achievements that people have reached, and the fact they feel proud. While it's cool that people want to share, I kind of agree with the sentiment that it shouldn't take up a whole bunch of front-page threads, especially if what some commenters say is true and some of them are actually faked.
---
Having some sort of dedicated space would enable those in need of sharing to do so, while avoiding clogging up the rest of the subreddit.
---
What happened to bunny? I checked earlier and it said he was in the finals? The play hearthstone site said he won 3-2 as well, I guess it must’ve been an error or something?
---
I hear that is what happened to Roger. It is a small world/s
---
Picked hunterace cause hunterace, not disappointed.
---
If you voice your opinions, it means you're confident enough in your intelligence to do so... 
---
I guess I don't understand your point.
---
Anger leads to hate.
---
RIP language he's actually decent though. Better than topdecker hunterace
---
***Real*** rogues run Acolyte of Pain.
---
Bunny lost 2-3 in the semi finals to Viper. It was a mistake. Finals is Viper vs Hunterace.
---
Funny thing, it has comparatively low winrate bacause in games when both players play it, its winrate stays the same, so because it is played so often, its winrate just PHISICALLY can't be too high
---
Wow!! You have some serious skill.
---
It looks amazing :D
---
Nice!
---
I think Hunterace is favored because of viper's zoo. HunterAce's decks are heavyly teched against board centric deck, control shaman beats it, Warrior beats it, tempo rogue beats it.
---
It happens consistently. The anti token cards are too high cost.
---
You still have to have savage roar for that
---
Why do i hear the sound of that card?
---
Ah ffs, this post again
---
tehvik#2322 EU 80g quest trade. You challenge first.
---
for christs sake. ive seen so many of these posts and its getting tiresome. as someone who doesnt play zilliax, has lost to zilliax, and faces zilliax all the time on ladder.... ZILLIAX IS NOT OVERPOWERED.
---
Because?
---
no problem!
---
that game was freaking insane! you came so close to winning.. damn turn timer.
---
Ahhh yes, the infamous Glirk Foy.
---
Odd paladin would still have taken the hit of losing divine favour. That card made the deck obscene.
---
not anymore
---
Ok, the Vargoth draw is where you can start feeling bad for him again.
---
Imagine losing to this lmao
---
FFS. Blink fox into dire frenzy. There you go.
---
That's a 100k Rafaam if I've ever seen one (250k vs 150k 2nd place).
---
Peak Hearthstone! That last game is great so far.
---
What is this game lmao
---
That's awesome. What a great way to take it in stride!
---
esport btw
---
holy shit this is amazing
---
If you'll have one a 13 win run in the future please let us know immediately.
---
Well I guess I would like some free packs
---
I mean this is entertaining regardless of the RNG fiesta.
---
The most pepega casters I've ever seen
---
This last game.. lol
---
What is even Hunterace's shaman? why does he have ancestral healing and twilight drake?
---
Fuck fuck fuck Rafaam. This shit is going to ruin every tournament and hurt Hearthstone esports and Hearthstone's reputation as a skill based game. It's like Yogg Saron all over again
---
Make it ten times as many and people will still complain.

are you not entertained?

Competitive esports btw

Hearthsone has a reputation as a skilled based game ?  LOL

&gt;Hearthstone's reputation as a skill based game.

lmao, when was the last time it had that reputation? just embrace the memes

yea I'm smiling ear to ear
---
Heyyyy, choosing the one canadian worked out this time
---
Blaming RNG is just the sign of a bad player.
---
or canadien, idk
---
I don't think Hearthstone has ever had much of a reputation as a great esport. It's just fun to watch
---
I'm sorry, but I just want to play and watch a game where skill matters, which HS basically is, but these cards such as Rafaam just turn the game into a pointless RNG fiesta
---
This is a complete shitshow that is unbelievably entertaining

Don't worry, I feel you. I know this is a joke, I'm just lucky that I can enjoy this, but I don't blame anyone who is absolutely disgusted by this. I think HS will forever will be a laughing stock of esports, and Blizz just want to make it entertaining, so it get viewers. And 100k+ viewers is not bad.
---
What a clown fiesta right now
---
Lmao
---
Honestly when it reaches this point, can you even keep track of all, or just most of the variables and possibilities? At this point I'd just start doing what was generally the best play without really thinking all that much about it.
---
You should definitely consider it. Nice work!

this is my first time watching HCT final, and it is surprising entertaining. I enjoy it, although i dont know what half of the cards do.
---
They are the worst, it's such a minor achievement
---
This directs me to the rebroadcast. If anyone also has same issue, here to the game 5 with timestamp: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/417424950?t=10h17m50s
---
&gt;Like how could anyone POSSIBLY have a full collection.
---
The thing is that you don't need anywhere close to a full collection to be highly competitive.
---
If Hunterace drew Hagatha he would have almost surely played it.  He was doing suboptimal tempo plays trying to draw and find it.
---
i got 1 ros and 2 classic fast
---
sottle's alt posting about himself Kappa
---
Cool
---
Oh God, I didn't even think about that.  It would have been so horrible.
---
this needs to stop
---
I hope this works
---
Hell yeah, I'm going to get all the packs
---
I wish they would fix this it's ridiculous
---
It was one game.  Not a large sample size.  But the point is you want a level of consistency at higher levels of play.   The more RNG you introduce into the game often the less the player decisions matter.
---
Did he?
---
I don't want to blame it on the location as in 2017 Leagues was in Beijing and the arena was still packed. You're right though that it would be better attended during a blizzcon. And yeah you're probably right about LoL being more popular. But I feel Blizzard could probably take some steps to make the event feel a bit more exciting.
---
In the next 120 packs you are guaranteed to finish it
---
Of all the classes to hecklebot, why would you risk it with the one that has no trouble at all bouncing minions?
---
You lucky duck, I’m missing the Nat Pagle from this screenshot
---
This. Many, many people in HunterAce’s spot would have lost that game. The fact that a game with so much randomness was still won due to excellent playing and planning just really highlights why Hearthstone is such a cool game
---
Dynomatic + doctor boom was the only reason we had control warrior all through rumblr and boomsday.
---
I think I played against you, I kept healing your Annoy-o-Tron so you couldn't combo me.
---
Would be a great moment if Rafaam wins, the league of shadows had rise. And it would be iconic too that a random legendary deck would win a championship
---
AFAIK, it sold out in tickets and then Blizzard decided to put out extra tickets to fit the demand but that also sold out. There were lots of things to do around the venue so I guess people either explored or just left after their favorite players lost.
---
Lol. Thats not the packs for watching twitch. All players get that. Thats sad
---
Strage, thanks mate
---
2nd time picking Bunnyhoppor, not disappointed. Always performs well.
---
Holy crap yeah that was the most annoying thing, why not at least see the combo man it was casual :(
---
I ser free packs and I comment
---
...for money i am willing to do this.
---
It’s people hitting a milestone in the game. Let them feel good about themselves. If you don’t like it you can hide the post.
---
I saw it with Lazul at least, I just wanted to see how long I could delay it
---
So this isnt how it normally is?
---
Give packs!
---
Awesome!

We always complain that Hearthstone has too much randomness and can't be taken seriously as an eSport, but honestly watching this game you realise why Hearthstone is so successful, while most of its competitors have been reduced to afterthoughts with the number of active players in five-figures at best.  This game will be remembered for years to come - in fact it might never be surpassed as the greatest game in Hearthstone history when the stakes are factored in - and without all the 'RNG' such a thrilling game could never have happened.
---
:(
---
jrwtih#1852 trading 80g quest, i show you go first
---
Surely you know how 2 mana Flame Imp works by now, right?
---
So basically the point of this deck is to trigger Toggs battlecry with as many shadowsteps and spirits as you can, but if you dont get cards needed you can always espionage + Tak for the rng win :D
---
if those deck are 100% winrate why didn't he win world ?

---
I wanted to compare my version with yours as I also run without Scargil and Hagatha. The differences being:
---
1 [[Zap]] instead of 2
---
I had a couple situations when I had the opponent down to 3 or less health and with Zap only targeting minions it felt bad to top deck later in the game. Great for [[Ziliax]] though!
---
[[Hench-Clan Hogsteed]]
---
I’m not set on keeping him but it’s super good at following Tidecaller on turn 2, killing an enemy minion with 2 health, then triggering Tidecaller to hit for 2. I’m not opposed to dropping him though
---
Is [[Belligerent Gnome]] mainly to protect your [[Underbelly Angler]]s? I may have to incorporate these in my list as well
---
You never find 2 [[Likkim]] overkill? I love having 1 for control and extra damage while overcharged but didn’t want to end up sitting on one when I could draw another [[Underbelly Angler]] or [[Murloc Warleader]]. 
---
I dropped one [[Murloc Tastyfin]] in favor of testing [[Cult Master]]. I’ve had a few games where I needed to trade out to kill important minions and throwing out Cult Master can help you reload your hand. In addition, against spells like [[Warpath]] and minions like [[Wild Pyromancer]] it creates a need to make bad decisions to get rid of the Cult Master otherwise giving me some major, major value. 
---
1 [[Bloodlust]] instead of 2
---
I tried with 2 for a while but would end up with this card stuck in my hand with a minimal amount of minions on the board to use it on. There have been less times where I was hoping for a Bloodlust top deck.
---
I would love to hear your thoughts!
---
Free packs i'm in
---
Idk, feels like a sub for circlejerking to me.

Oh my god, yes. It happens *far* too often, ever since their update last month.
---
I enjoyed it all too, the pairings work well together, it's a lot easier not to miss things when you're just watching the game and not having to look at decklists and keep up commentary. I'd imagine they'd ideally like Kibler and Frodan to cast the final, but as Frodan has host duties as well that wouldn't have been possible.
---
imagine thinking this one clip was the entire series lmfao actual brainlet you are
---
Or drastically lower the appearance of Dyn-o-matic and Omega-Devastator appearing from the discovers? Thats the real problem; that the class specific mechs show up far too much, the percentages are clearly skewed.
---
Omega-Devastator always looked like it should have been a warrior legendary to me though.
---
True!
---
I would've been pissed if it was, the victory would've been taken purely by rng rather than actual skill and deduction
---
Nice
---
How do you think bomb warrior isn’t worse then normal control? Bomb warrior has much more rng with the draw on the bombs, and the bombs kill you on top of having most of the normal control stuff anyway! How is normal control better or more annoying to play against?
---
Vote for your champion. They do it as a promotion for big tournaments.
---
&gt; but you just get over it and move on, it's part of the game, whether you like it or not.
---
I'm talking about in a tournament setting. When money is on the line. Not just in a random match. o-0
---
Go watch Chess instead of a cardgame then.
---
gz to team5, thats quite a lot for a sub
---
That’s cool. I think that isn’t intended however. 
---
Also, does that bomb go off when you draw it with the book? Or since it’s being discarded it never does?
---
Cope
---
Maybe Conjurer's calling
---
Ah i didn't know that.
---
The rng complaint also neglects any bad rng like opponent getting litterally the two best five drops x2 with khadgar in that mage game in semi or him having hagatha as almost last card in that final game.  Plenty of other times the opponent had luck but ppl invent their own reality.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that, thanks.
---
Though being a smartass that still doesn’t seem like the correct play, assuming there’s an equal chance for it to either be Misdirection or Explosive, playing these minions and attacking face only increases his chance of winning by 1/(the number of total friendly characters -1), resulting in him only having a 3/8 chance of winning, while had he played against Explosive he’d have had a 50 percent chance.
---
But obviously I can’t blame him for not coming to this conclusion while being so short on time and in such a stressful position.

---
Keep playing man, I'm sure you'll get there.
---
Yeah imagine losing 500k because you drew Nat Pagle and Milhouse Manastorm from your Rafaam and the opponent draws Tirion and Ysera

Random Card Generation sure is fun... 
---
The better player should win, not the one that got more lucky with his stupid RNG card. Period.
---
- Pre-nerfed innervate in Rogue
---
- Deathstalker Rexxar in Druid
---
- Innervate/preperation in Priest
---
- Ice block in Warlock
---
Sorry.  In my defense Yueying threw pretty hard lol.  His lineup is very favored vs Hunterace and Jing, but he banned zoo against Jing when his lineup has all favorables against it.  Just makes no sense to me.
---
*Malygos
---
They are good but you know, every participant was free to chose their own lineup and decks. If they were so op everyone would roll shaman. 
---
Credit hunterace for good prep and deckbuilding aswell as good navigation of said decks.
---
Comment! Within 48 hours?
---
ok it's mine
---
Looks hand painted :s
---
i've had like 5 disconnects up until about a month ago (and i've played since beta), and during the past month i've got a dc every 3rd or so game. and this is on PC yea (without anything else losing connection, just HS). the "realizing the game has lost connection" feature and the reconnect feature are both beyond horrible.. really incredible that they haven't improved this during all those years.
---
Legendaries are mostly just stats which don't affect the board, most don't even have taunt. You can take greedy value trades and it's really hard to be punished. Viper really only had a chance because he azalina'd Hunterace's high tempo hand.
---
Even your average girlfriend, wouldn't do that for you in front of bunch of viewers.
---
You could also just, not comment?
---
Everyone’s talking about game 5 but wtf was viper doing game 1 against the explosive trap?
---
To we Todd Ed?
---
You're trying to.  By calling anyone who has the sheer gall to play this game differently than you do 'scum'.
---
Shadowcaster in Warrior.
---
Gang Up in Paladin.
---
huh
---
I think he could have AT LEAST played around MC Tech.  Playing that 4th minion out with the Carpet against an empty board was surely a mistake.
---
It was probably just a solid card, he had just 50% chance of getting Tiger anyway.
---
Using 10 meta cards in a deck doesn't make it a netdeck. Sorry you're bad.
---
I always enjoy all three casting duos and don't understand people's constant whining about them.
---
My favorite moment is when Hunterace big-balled the aggressive Alex and nobody saw it coming.
---
What cards does he already own?
---
The algorithm is to make the statistically best deck with the cards provided, even if you add a few cards it will still pick the best deck. Kinda sucks if you wanna try some unique combos
---
You get way more value going for 50 each. Once you open 50-70 packs, you're just hoping to get lucky with epics and legendaries while opening a bunch of cards you already own.
---
Half the people here don't even know the card anymore FeelsWildMan
---
Not taking yourself too seriously is such a underrated and great quality in someone. Of course it was awkward and bad, but that's what made it endearing and fun. 
---
The presenter had a great attitude the entire time. Even if it wasn't in my native language, it was still very apparent she was professional and having fun.
---
Anything from Gilneas - Darius, Genn, Tess. any of em, love the place.
---
I legitimately can't remember who I picked lol. Already checked the Choose your champion website, signed it to my account but couldn't see my pick anywhere. Would any of you fine gentlemen mind helping out?
---
Do you order by "newest"?
---
Just looking at hot/top I see these a few times a week... 
---
If I had to name one thing that 50% of this sub is, it's "Look at this thing that happened in my game!", and it's usually something that we've all seen a thousand times, like a 1/10 odds, or rarely, a 1/100 odds which means it probably *only* happens a few thousand times per hour in HS.
---
(And I just took a look at 'new' and there isn't even one legend/12 wins thread. by 50% did you mean 0.5%?)
---
Killin got me 2 packs, can't complain really I suppose. 2 &gt; 1!
---
Besides it was worth it to support the one Priest in the tournament
---
Yeah looking at how often that seems to happen to you i'd say you need a new ISP...
---
Most fun I’ve had as a near-free-to-player is mechathun Druid with the stampeding roar into anaconda into mechathun combo. Wild only now though...
---
Emperor Thaurissan. I just love him. Don't ask why
---
So we need to scroll through 30 of the same post to find the stuff we want on the page? Alright
---
Nobody gives a fuck if you reached legend or got 12 wins or hit 'dad legend hurr hurr' it's a fucking game everyone here plays, a ton of people have done the exact same thing you have done
---
It's akin to people that try to display how cool their dog is, it's like yes it's cool it's a dog do you know how many people have a fucking dog it's not special
---
It was at that moment he knew, he fucked up
---
Okay Hermione
---
&gt;yeah i got a pack after the day of watching 4 hours. everyday different expansion pack
---
Now I can finally play the game!
---
It's basically only useful for putting together the best deck if you have all the cards for it. For anything else, you're better off doing it by hand.
---
No these 3 are different I got those too but it supposed to be a ros pack for the 4 hours watched
---
Member of the Bunnyhoppor appreciation team right here. Thanks man, well played - you'll get the next one!
---
Wow blizzard thanks for the packs, daaaamn golden chef nomi that what I wanted too !!!
---
I tested it a lot and worked much better than this a week ago or so. I feel it started making messy builds at one point. For example, in my example, it party made a mech and prelate deck, Im sure if it found a Prelate deck was the best deck it wouldnt have added Whelps, Annoyo Modules etc.
---
The weirdest part is that the ysera cards have the hunter colour, rather than anything otherwise unused
---
I’m excited what the Hunterace Hearthstone card will be
---
Just saw the front page post about how people hate these kind of posts... Picked a bad day to finally do this huh?
---
Exactly. He promised someone that he will deliver 4 packs and then didn't want to break his promise and win the whole thing after realizing that 4 packs is semi-finals :/
---
Likely an unpopular opinion, but: Some of the Death Knights were so weak in Arena they should still be available even when not all classes get one. Valeera was exceptionally weak, but I think Garrosh and Thrall are also fine (for when Arena has KotFT).
---
I just put it on SoundCloud too
---
Why the fuck am I doing this? xD
---
Together they defeat captain marvel  because she is the bad guy
---
Holy Rngesus
---
If burgling is something they're going to be making part of Rogue's identity going forward, which it sounds like based on what they've said, maybe they should have keyworded it.
---
Then it could have been **Battlecry**: **Burgle a card**, and the effect and tooltip explanation something like: Add a card to your hand from your opponent's class, or if the opponent is also a rogue, from another class.
---
As nobody seems to want to give you the honest answer: If you've been playing for several years and have access to meta decks and are somehow stuck at rank 20, the situation is pretty dire. Keep at it if you're having fun, I suppose.
---
I'll be sure to be back tomorrow!
---
I discovered this to my annoyance the other day, the bomb counts as a spell for things like the shaman draw a 5+ cost spell but doesn't get discarded by book.
---
Tar Creeper? Stonehill Defender? Mistress of Mixtures? Fire Fly? Belcher? Piloted Shredder? Saronite Chain Gang?
---
yeah but this dude seems to win everything lol
---
Same.  Those along with my golden swash burglars were my favorite cards.
---
Yeah boot and golden veggie are more rarer for sure. Wasn't expecting the lamp tho
---
You could argue he should have gone for the Rafaam, but otherwise it's just a 50/50 gamble. Not a 'definite' misplay.
---
In all the games I've played with Mecha'thun, I only had one person play Hakkar against me, but yeah, I'm sure we'll see more tech against it in the future.
---
Plugging in my comment for the packs. :o
---
Well, I guess I'll try to win then
---
Is there a Youtube mirror? At work rn
---
dies to bgh, probably not good
---
Thanks! I definitely miss the rovers versus aggro...probably a good substitute for Thalnos.
---
Thanks!
---
This event reinforced that idea for me. The number of games that were decided by Create was really shocking this year. Lackeys, in particular, seem to have boosted RNG to new heights.
---
Nah yogg generated the armor
---
This is a great quote, loved the casting of this game by Sottle and Raven
---
The deck you are describing is a world championship deck.

According to Twitch Metrics, League is the second most watched game this month and Hearthstone is the fifth most watched game this month. In short, League has more viewers than Hearthstone, but Hearthstone has a lot of viewers. So it's not surprising that Hearthstone's live audience is smaller than League's.

You should watch some streamers for a while and pay attention to why they play certain cards at certain times. I think you’re just missing something to the strategy of the game. But you can get that thing you’re missing if you study.
---
Babbling book is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at one mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a spell to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 1/1 can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the BB is just so positive. It comes on the board like "do you want to cast a spell?" and I'm like "yeah BB i do want to cast a spell let's do this shit" and when he attacks he's like "SPELLS ARE FUN" and I'm like "yeah they are SO FUN." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "nah spells are fun." And it looks so happy. I mean this is an inanimate object literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. I mean look at his face he's just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when babbling book is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card
---
Then he is using warpath and 4-6-8 mana just to clear some minions. I guess its worth.
---
Why should it be faster in Wild than in Standard? Just because you can play op decks doenst mean your winrate is better, since your opponent play op decks as well!
---
You can play a deck which hard counters warrior. So, it's not invincible. But you can't out-strategy it and make it a good matchup for aggro.
---
If you play a deck which warrior inherently beats you are pretty well fucked and you need them to draw badly.
---
People will tell you not to play into brawl, but between brawl and all the other board clears, there is just no way to play around everything while still playing fast enough to win.
---
Take risks, play around the cards you can beat, assume they don't have the stuff you can't beat. That's how you win unfavorables.
---
If you wanna beat warrior regularly play a different deck.
---
Even if i dont over exetend, there are still more, there is warpath, there is "light defuses" dr boom that gives rush.
---
Must be some kind of glitch bc I never got any of these friends
---
I tried soul of murloc for so long, because of warpath, it just dosent work....
---
4 of the Tier 2 decks are control decks. 
---
And really, not a single aggro deck right now feels truly oppressive or incredibly hard to deal with. There’s plenty of techs available for them. 
---
Learn to your read your pocket meta, and tech your decks accordingly.
---
Neato, free packs, congrats on 1 mil :)
---
*sap* "the pleasure is mine"
---
Dank.
---
Sometimes playing against druid you get either witching hour or predatory instincts off a thief card, and the beast tag on blink fox keeps them from being dead cards.
---
Definitely go with Khadgar right now. Both decks are very RNG dependent, and while shaman is super fun, Conjurer’s mage has more oomph in this meta.
---
Please. No one gives a shit. I didn't make a spam pay when I hit dad legend.
---
This comment is even worse
---
And it just so happens that Lotus Agents are on the history bar from the turn before!
---
I greed more than enough when i am tired of waiting . It still dosent work.
---
I picked BloodTrail just to embrace the meme. FeelsBadMan with a gun
---
Are you gonna try the others?
---
Calling any of the DK weak for Arena is nonsense. Lightforge had the weakest of them (Thrall and Valeera) around 120 which is very good.
---
Woot
---
4/20 the birthday of a certain legendary gamer
---
Given the number of these posts that hit /new, it's inevitable that some of them will randomly get enough upvotes to make it to the front page.  It's a matter of statistics, not preference.
---
The reason rafaam has a low winrate is because it's a play from behind card, and a card that gives you a chance against decks you will probably lose 90% to.
---
Want to know about this too.
---
Please. Pleaseeeee. Pretty please with a cake and milkshake.
---
Of all the decks to complain about, you go with Shaman? 
---
I get big shaman can be frustrating when Hagatha is played on curve and can sometimes provides an answer to everything. But the deck is far from reliable. 
---
So many worst offenders this expansion. Rogues says hello.
---
&gt; do is comment in this thread and a winner be chosen at random within the next 48 hours!

I think I'm late!
