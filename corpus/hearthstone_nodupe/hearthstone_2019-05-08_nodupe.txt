The first arcane explosion doesn't have anything special, or the fact that the spell he got 4 time is arcane explosion isn't anything special. When people ask for odds, they mean "odds of a similar event".
---

---
If I roll a random number from 1 to 1000 and get 444 and ask you the odds, what will you say? 1/1000? Yes, it's 1/1000 that I got *precisely* 444, but I would've asked you the same question if I got 222 or 888 or 555... In practice, the odds of a similar event is 9/1000, not 1/1000.
---
And in the same sense, if I got 287 and asked you the odds, well it's still 1/1000... But the odds of getting a number with nothing special about it is probably more like 950/1000.
---
So in this case, the special thing wasn't "it's 4 arcane explosion!" it's "the last 3 spells are the same as the 1st spell". 
---
So it's really 3 special spells, not 4.

I said "correlation" i never said causation.
---
And yes, in the current meta and this dataset there is a negative correlation between winrate and dust price. 
---
And this can be an interesting statement. Countering the intuitive perception of pay to win for example. 
---
OP is clearly showing a connection, your analysis of OP's intention seems a bit off to me. (But maybe he completely failed in his post)
---
Only because **you** want to present different data doesn't concern my comment regarding OP's data presentation.
---
Omega Devestator isn‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs Omega Assembly and Drone Delivery consistently discovers this card allowing 5+ of these played in a single match
---
Edwin itself is already 2/2 though so it was 48/48 to add. 24/24 before the Shark so 12 cards x 2 x 2 + 2
---
It's way too late for math but something along those lines...I believe...or I'm missing something. Not sure.
---
Not to argue but what's wrong with a 1 cost 1-2 taunt?
---
You mad man. That is genius!!
---
The patriarch was picked up by a hot elf and the others got left behind.
---
It be like that
---
&gt;No, he isn't comparing dust cost and winrate.
---
That's literally what he's doing.
---
&gt;There isn't a correlation to be made there, as you can see from OP's image.
---
There obviously is.
---
&gt;If you wanted to draw a trendline, it would say that deck cost has a slightly negative correlation to winrate (since many of the cheaper decks are on the left in OP's image).
---
The order of the data has no effect on the correlation.
---
&gt;But logically, we know that there is no causal relationship here.
---
This doesn't have much to do with what OP has shown.
---
Looks super nice!
---
It is advertisement, to get those who are unsure about buying into it.
---
But at best, this is seriously the dumbest thing they have ever done, because why not just let everyone play it. Those that want to spoil it can, and those that want to play can equally partake. Seriously, I hope no one watches.

I think they wanted people to save gold for the solo content so that they would have less packs, and so they would be more tempted to spend money on packs to make up for it. Tin foil hat theory, I know, but just what I would expect from Activision.

A new card, [[Chef Nomi]] has been included in a proest deck involving cycling your entire deck and then repeatedly seancing the Nomi. It is hard countered by any deck where you can draw 3-4 board clears 
---
The 3/4 minion discovers a spell that costs 5 or more. Only a handful such spells exist in shaman and he happened to get board clears from both of them, completely negating the opponents win condition

This sucks so much...
---
The entire way they marketed this PVE content made no sense to begin with. Players who are primarily interested in solo content don't need packs as their "reward" for buying the adventure. And those who aren't really interested in the adventure itself can get a lot more packs for the same price (and a lot sooner to boot). They assume that most players like PVP and PVE equally, which seems wildly misguided.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On top of that, releasing the adventure later than the expansion it relates to, which they started doing with Monster Hunt, only frustrates fans of the single player mode. They did say that Dungeon Run "distracted" a lot of players from playing constructed, and that was their reasoning for changing the schedule, but it's likely because solo content with actual replay value was brand new for the game. It's an established game mode, now, with its dedicated fans, and many PVP players who just don't care for it.
---
So, since the "usual" two weeks delay was already frustrating, when they announced a TWO MONTH delay this time around (to get the full content), that seemed pretty WTF. And now they're delaying it even more??! At this rate, we'll get the final wing literally closer to the release  date of the NEXT expansion than the one it's actually linked to... AND  we get to see even more spoilers before we can test it ourselves. GREAT  JOB!

Drawing Aranasi Broodmother on turn 1. That‚Äôs the joke.

You can see a full list [here](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#sortBy=dust&amp;sortDirection=ascending)

I suggest you create an account at hsreplay and sync your collection, it will tell you the dust cost to you and you can filter by the amount of dust you're willing to spend
---
As a strictly f2p player I expect that it will take you two rotations to have a decent standard collection provided that you don't waste resources

You can build a full collection fairly quickly if you get good at arena

I will say thanks even it really heal 1 hp.

But most of time they(priests) just emote "the light shall burn you"then heal me when I am full of health.

Darkest hour warlock is so bad, but once in awhile I get the amazing opening hand and win by turn 6. Wish it was more consistent

Yes correct he is the one. Its on his achievement that he participated in WCG. I wonder how a strong guy like him in hearthstone a free agent? He must choose a team duuuh

OR, now here me out, ditch the classic + basic sets entirely \[and roll out a new 'free' set once a year to actually work with, instead of against, that years sets\]
---
Yes, but not **in-game**, hence the misunderstanding and the suck-it-and-see approach to figuring things out.
---
Anybody got the time?
---
I mean ofcourse it‚Äôs okay to call it whatever you like but I think most people call it just health

I never said rogue wasn‚Äôt op I‚Äôm saying that people complain about it when mech hunter has a much higher winrate which makes it arguably the better deck. In my experience yes rogue is very op but I have managed to win a couple times. Mech hunter is different, I lose literally every time.

I think it might be the last one

---
You deserved it.
---
It seems I haven't had a lot of need for card draw or taunt. The steals, copys and removals have been keeping their board clear and mine useful. Early game kind of differs from opponent to opponent but it's not super important because of how slow most decks are and against aggro there's options to keep them in check until midgame.
---
What I like about it over spell hunter is velen. It adds another nice combo and makes a big difference. With decent draws a lot of my wins come directly on turn 10 with Velen.
---
I did make it a point to say that it doesnt do well against bomb or control warrior, but in my experience no priest deck does except sometimes Nomi, but it's a bad deck in most other situations. If you have any suggestions though, I'm definitely open to hearing them. Priest is in a horrible spot right and now I'm really trying to figure out something that works.
---
This is a u problem not a dev problem

Hope it works well! Tell me your results

A lot of times if I have lethal and I think the opponent is F2P, then I'll just concede.

It's definitely risky at times but luckily it's not the only way to win. There's other priest decks out there that are fun to play as well, no denying that. But with none of them doing very well in the meta at all, I'm trying to figure out anything that hasn't been discovered yet. Meme decks all day...

As for tips, just play. Play Ranked up until rank 20, then jam Casual until you're comfortable with the game mechanics. You can find guide on how to optimise early packs anywhere. Just google or search on Reddit.

"yo n----, I'e done it"
---
In short Blizzard hasn't catered to the "engaged" audience for years now -&gt; people here are frustrated with the preceived stagnation of the game.
---
Moreover HS just had its most disasterous year behind it. If you're doing research look up Ben Brode leaving Team 5, Genn &amp; Baku problems (Kibler's videos sum it up nicely), tournament mode cancellation, revenue/ player numbers dropping
---
There are some positive developments recently. Bascially everything announced the "year of the dragon" video seems like a step in the right direction, HS getting 20% more developpers, decent brand new meta.
---
So you've played this game for three years, yet never gone on an unlucky streak? If you're so certain about it, why ask for an explanation?

Would it be possible to add Leeroy to this to summon whelps with the infinite Shudderwoks to gunk up his board and screw up his res pool as well?
---
oof
---
I believe the combo requires Plated Beetle played and killed before Da Undatakah, then Da Undatakah, Doppelgangster and Grumble, Worldshaker to be played before Shudderwock.
---
This gives Shudderwock the deathrattle of "gain 3 armour", triples itself on summon then bounces them back to hand and makes them cost 1. If your hand is full, the deathrattle triggers and you get 3 armour. ~60 armour per turn in theory?

---
Yeah but the older PVE content was the main content of the set.
---
Thank you friend for spreading the word of Dane, by far the most entertaining Hearthstone YouTuber.
---
I've had the worst luck with that deck so far.
---
Do you know what cards different meta decks play and want to play on specific turns so you can play around things?
---
Not really neither have been very good for a long time
---
Edwin if you like Rogue. It always finds a spot in rogue decks and can win some matches/early game although it's not a must have.
---
There's just not enough content for it to be released this slow. They're trying to spread a measley drop of butter over the worlds biggest piece of bread and its just not working and now im bored tbh.
---
The tempo the card produces is not the problem of that card, but the value and the speed. It is to fast for a draw 2 (It is debatable if a lackey is worse than a random tempo Rogue card). Maybe a better fix is to make the card a deathrattle effect instead of combo. It would be a nice lackey generator for Rogue deathrattle decks. It would limit the value Tempo Rogue has so it has to be built in a less greedy way.
---
He acts as if he doesn't care about HS, but deep in his heart he loves it.

---
The first wing sure. But that's probably it.
---
Just beat it for the first time yesterday using the mage hero power shrine. So glad to finally get it over with!
---
Well no, because there's no benefit to bouncing the deathrattle 2/2, for example. Give it to Warlock and it's great with Grim Rally, but give it to Rogue and it's trash.
---
I can still understand pre-expansion reveal streams, but solo adventures? Why would I want the adventure spoiled ffs.

Can confirm I play control shaman and sometimes it feels like I just lose because of a bad starting hand or not drawing my board clears

Inb4 "literally unplayable"
---

---
Maggot?
---
it‚Äôs the best 5 drop, it can be offensive and defensive. I‚Äòd say it‚Äôs probably the best card there is right now. because it can be used in almost any deck and never will be a bad choice. it‚Äòs balanced and wont see a nerf. so crafting this card is in my opinion the best choice at the moment.
---
I agree with you, but the problem is every Hearthstone video he has is really long, and I never found the time to watch them.
---
Though every time I want to have a good laugh, I always rewatch the Kobolds card reveal with Day9 and Brode; one of the most enjoyable Hearthstone videos I have watched.
---
Careful, once you start MTG, you might not come back :P.
---
I've found myself playing a ton less hearthstone after playing Arena. Though I play physical MTG as well. But it really just is a better game and I have way more faith in them crafting a good meta and keeping innovation going with each set.
---
The comment stating that the idea of giving streamers early access is idiotic has twice the invites than the post itself. And from what little I have seen on twitter, people there are also not pleased.
---
&gt; I think Hero Cards are a disaster for this game, and their toxic effect hits the Priest class the hardest. 
---
Hard disagree. We're never going to have more than nine classes in the game, so the 'only' alternative are hero cards that essentially add another class to the game.
---
SRA Razakus Priest deserved to be nerfed, but in all my years of playing the game, it was the most I ever played HS because it was fundamentally different than every other Priest deck I ever piloted, in no small part to SRA changing Priest from a class that traditionally grinded opponents out to a class that could actually put your opponent on a clock. 
---
We can argue what Hero cards are 'healthy,' but I'd be willing to bet money that one of the reasons why KFT sold so well (and no set has matched its performance since) was in no small part because of how those Hero cards injected a ton of excitement into the game.
---
So you want to
---
&gt; "push everyone into your stupid aggro meta?"
---
Good one.
---
Despair
---
Turns out the real heist was on us all along
---
Thalnos is good but it has almost no use in this meta
---
Both of those classes already run EVIL cable rat, that is a 1/1. 
---
The fact that a 2 mana 2/2 can be silenced doesn't make it unplayable especially when silence is currently almost irrelevant. 
---
Yes EVIL cable rat can be bounced for one extra Lackey in Rogue and the 2/2 can't but that's not very relevant, you have other things to bounce.
---
I see you didn't watch firebats latest deck doctor for beast warlock. 
---
Spoilers- That beast is not as good at it looks
---
Damn I have not seen her played at all, wasn‚Äôt even aware of the cost
---
On paper, really all are equal. 
---
Tempo cards like \[\[Blood to Ichor\]\] proved extremely playable in Warrior in the past, which is exactly what Improve Moral is. Warrior just isn't in a great place for more of a tempo oriented deck when control is as good as it is.
---
Likewise low cost card generators and cheap deathrattles have both been very useful and competitive in Priest at most points in the game's history. Like with Improve Moral, the conditions for EVIL Conspirator to see play weren't met this format.

Important note if you don‚Äôt watch the video/useful tip: Dane tends to play all of them asap, then closes the game and logs back in. Even with reduced cast time on Shudderwock, it‚Äôs legit faster to close and reopen than watch all 10 shudderwocks.
---
Arena isn't open to me yet. When is it available?
---
Hi Zetalot.
---
Now you can play the game!
---
Thanks!
---
But how?
---
Damn, they admitted this? Thats unexpected.
---
 You know anything about totem shaman?
---
There's plenty of ground between aggro and fatigue. Last time I checked I think it was called "Mid range"
---
why it will be like in the early days, one wing for free the rest for X money or 700 gold
---
Yeah, it does seem weird to call it backward when moving into the graveyard. But as you must have seen when you looked at the logs back in that thread, the enchantments do get detached and removed.
---
As it's understood, the idea of a "graveyard" in Hearthstone has two components to it. The first is the literal graveyard zone, which cards get sent to when they're destroyed. This also includes discards, burns, and spells that have been cast. But that wouldn't differentiate between minions that died, ones that were discarded, death this turn vs death this game, and so on.
---
That's where the other form of collection comes in: caches. These are responsible for recording certain events that other cards might later want to refer back to. Minions that died, cards that were played, your opening hand, etc. Resurrection effects look to the list of minions that died, rather than the graveyard itself. The Advanced Rulebook mentions a "death event cache", but the mechanics behind it have since changed from what's described there. As it's understood now, the death cache records the minions that died, along with the state they were in at the time they died. This is what Kangor's Endless Army uses to restore enchantments.
---
It's also the likely reason that Twilight's Call is bugged. When the mechanics of the death cache changed, old cards that used it had to be modified. Presumably someone screwed up when converting Twilight's Call, and when it looks for Deathrattle minions in the death cache, it's looking at the stored final state rather than the base card.
---
The graveyard zone itself is effectively vestigial. Before the mechanics were changed, the death cache would only serve to point resurrection effects to the card in the graveyard, where the actual data would be read. This could lead to a [complicated but hilarious bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MObXMLTN23Y) if you managed to recover a card from the graveyard and transform it in a certain way, where you'd be able to resurrect a minion that never died. Was my favorite bug at the time, but the new mechanics mean it's no longer possible.
---
Tbh I kinda felt bad for him for the long wait. Shudder turn times are kinda too long

There's no difference between buying the adventure for cash or gold.
---
Just so you know, I'm not totally against the whole emote system. I'll send out a greetings at the start of the match sometimes, or offer a well played as the loser when my opponent wins an even match. I'll use Oops and Wow rarely if it is clear that something didn't quite go as planned. Sometimes I squelch right away.
---
I think the place where your logic is flawed is the assumption that your opponent played well. Congratulating an opponent on a well played game doesn't make sense if your opponent did not, in fact, play well. I play on mobile and have lost simply because I dragged the wrong card out. You wouldn't necessarily know that I misplayed horribly from your perspective. Likewise, I may literally have no relevant counter-play. I don't need you to tell me that I played well when my decisions were irrelevant anyway.
---
If you check these forums regularly I'm sure you've seen plenty of bad responses like the one from OP. I would rather remain silent at the end of the game than drive someone to have this kind of reaction.
---
Precisely
---
No turn limit Epic 60 min game where the winner is decided by who gets a better discover.
---
Note it's not "should", it will absolutely guarantee a Legendary.

In case its not a troll:
---
This card is a choice of Jade Idol.
---
No it wasn't. The only deck it was played was tier 5 Test Subject OTK Priest. Druid didn't use it, Maly Rogue didn't use it. None of the Mechathun decks used it. Mind Blast Priest or Clone Gallery Priest didn't use it.
---
While that first sentence is false, since a decent board that doesn't get cleared will win a control matchup much more often, the issues you coin are solvable through a nerf. HoF after less than a month is just nonsensical.
---
They haven't been given out yet, they usually take their time sending them out.
---
Wrrrrrrrrrrrrrong. I was playing Bomb Warrior but the amount of Mech Hunter killed the fun in doing so. Since then I'm playing Mech Paladin. 
---
I just don't have any problem with Controldecks.
---
Indeed. The lich king hero (in ice crown) does.
---
Arguably the best card in RoS with all its Dr. Boom and Control Synergy.  Passes the vanilla test?  Mech Tribe?  Devastating (harr harr) Battle Cry?  
---
Verdict: Busted.
---
There are scenarios in which it wouldn't that's true. I was thinking of token druid in particular when I commented, this card would cause me to concede if they killed my board after I used a soul of the forest.

I have a lot of decks, (Bomb Hunter, Control Warrior, Holy Wrath Paladin, Wall Priest) But they're Incomplete, Does a deck only shine when it is finished? They're not in a bad shape, only missing 1 Legenary or 2 Epics each. Also, What's a good deck to hit Legend? I've been playing Bomb Hunter for a while now(Only missing Flark)  and I've been bouncing between 5 and 4 rank for 2-3 days now, thanks in advance!
---
I don't understand your post then. 
---
You say that Paladin is in a dismal state, but you got to rank 5 within one week of the season starting. That's not the signs of a struggling class.
---
There's always going to be a bottom class and usually it's the classes that have poor Classic sets each time there is a rotation. Which is why classes like Priest, Paladin, Shaman always fall back when their OP non-classic cards rotate out.
---
At least we have murlocs
---
Is there any sourcelink to that statment?
---
This i like
---
Damn it lost a quest
---
It's consistent and it makes sense so yes.
---
Dane-ine
---
It is a mage card
---
Shaman has the same problem though. Overload is dated and pretty shit with the amount of power creep and value cards out there without an overload back. The classic sets are so bad that cards in new expansions need to be broken to feel good playing them.
---
Has it ever been confirmed that there is a separate Golden Legendary pity timer?  That doesn't make sense - how many people are getting 40 golden legendaries in packs? It seems too rare to get that many golden legendaries.
---
[[Keeper Stalladris]] is responsible for this card, you can even see it in the bottom of the history bar.
---
What happened is you expected Hearthstone to have a consistent internal set of rules, when in reality it is a garbled mess of spaghetti code in which the actual effect of a card may or may not have anything to do with its text.

I just reached legend and haven‚Äôt seen a single Elysiana played in maybe 60 games, why is she a problem?
---
Except that there wasn't.  Day 1 was mostly Bomb Warriors and Silence Priests.  That doesn't reflect the current meta at all.
---
Youre not thanos. He had style and purpose and was at least remotely intelligent. Youre just calling strangers on the internet whales because they own a card in the game that you BOTH play and is accessible to EVERYONE. The only thing inevitable about you is that youll forever be at rank 50.
---
Total hype killer for me, especially combined with the slow balling.
---
Team 5 got a bit better at msking balanced cards and designing an interesting meta. But on the other hand Activision-Blizzard got so out of touch with their community, it's harming the good opinion I once had about them.
---
In my opinion, if you enjoy playing arena and are able to get at least 4-5 wins relatively regularly, that's the way to go as you'll get a pack every time and, with quests, can do a run every day or two. But you kind of have to enjoy and be decent at drafting or else it may not be worth it.
---
&gt;"After all, we‚Äôre in May, a time in which Priest will usually suck (Control Priest in Witchwood was quite strong, to be fair). But don‚Äôt worry, everyone will be complaining about Priest once again in December, after it gets ‚Äúcompletely broken AOE‚Äù, ‚Äúabsurdly overtuned dragon‚Äù and ‚Äúrage-inducing Big Priest enabler.‚Äù
---
Yeah guys just keep eating the shit sandwich that is Hearthstone while Blizzard ignores 99% of your feedback and goes through the same tired cycle year after year. *Don't worry guys.*
---
Usually it's 2 weeks after the event finishes on a Thursday.
---
I brought up Mech Hunter because you mention it albeit indirectly. 
---
Even if I were to agree with you that it is and most of the other decks you just mentioned are aggro decks (most actually aren't, they just lean that way or play finisher combos), there's still Control and Bomb Warrior, at least two flavors of Khadgar Mage, Deathrattle Hunter, Big and Control Shaman, Miracle Rogue, Hand Warlock, and a few other slower decks people can do well with.
---
Thank fucking god
---
Also the whole "did I draw Barnes"
---
Booms scheme was hagathas scheme. But they realized warrior has enough bullshit board clears
---
Can I preorder this somewhere?
---
I no longer care. I don't need the boosters anymore and somehow that killed all hype for me. Especially considering the wings will slow dripped over weeks.
---
Is this... actually good content? On r/hearthstone?!
---
Absolutely fantastic write-up. I completely agree with all of your reasoning and I have been thinking about these issues for a long time. Even though control priest in Witchwood was actually pretty decent, these issues still existed around that time, and are definitely going to always exist if nothing is changed.
---
Again, great post, and I really hope someone from team 5 sees this, or has at least been thinking about this already.
---
Your missing the point where he's a whiny entitle asshole who doesn't want people that like the way it is now from having what they enjoy.  He know he can avoid the stream, but he wants to make sure others can't enjoy the streams because fuck people that like things they don't.
---
I strictly play netdecks so I'm usually very happen when theres a list of "these might be good" decks once the expansion launches.
---
Agreed. I especially dislike the pre-release fireside things. I want to be among the first to discover a card is better than we all thought. Screw the preview spoiling it.
---
nope, its Myras -&gt; Astral communion -&gt; double UI on itself everytime.
---
I don't think that it's going to be really competitive, so it's like using 1200 dust(craft, then disenchant) to play with a new toy for a 4 weeks before you get the golden version of it for free.
---
I think your initial idea is stronger, given that card synergy is more important than individual cards.  With the new auto deckbuilding feature, identifying tier 1,2,3 decks based on ranked play is probably easily available in game.  
---
Exclusions or MMR based on commonality would be straight forward -- wouldn't they?  It could base commonality on both the entire deck and the Legendary/Epic combinations found in tier 1/tier 2 decks.
---
Plus witches brew for value++
---
I was pretty disappointed that Madame Lazuli was the only card printed for theft priest decks. I'd like to see more minions that generate cards, like Burglary Rogue now has. This archetype isn't competitive, but I'll bet it could be nearly as fun as Burglary Rogue if they supported it more.
---
And this doesn't even get into how the existence of divine spirit and inner fire forever makes the class constrained.
---
Those cards, and maybe even mind blast, need to be rotated.  And something like light bomb evergreen'd.
---
But yeah.  Hero cards are a joke that have ruined the game for the last two years.
---
Pretty sure they changed it to make it work the way it is intended to work now, i.e no stacks. It's meant to buff the base card and shuffle. Guy in above comment thread posted the link for it. 
---

I stopped playing about when kobolds came out and recently got back into it, didn't they say all the solo adventures would be free when knights of the frozen the one came out?
---
Your soul shall huffer
---
I was going to speak to a manager about this.
---
Arena Question, sorry but I didn't see a thread like this in the arena sub. I hear they're rotating the arena set twice per expansion - have they revealed the schedule on that and which sets are coming next?
---
Strong agree.
---
Yeah it's a nightmare. There's not class worse and it's not even close. Priest winrates are in the toilet. I've been trying everything...
---
What did you wind up with after adding some cards?
---
I mean, obviously I have beaten big priest when they draw poorly.
---
But going by the meta snapshot, big priest currently wins (60% or more winrate) against most of the meta decks (Jade Druid, aggro druid, odd paladin, murloc shaman, even warlock, odd warrior).
---
It loses badly to kingsbane rogue and togwaggle druid.  (Neither of which I have built).
---
I don‚Äôt currently have a deck that actually has a winning record against big priest.  These days they run double shadow word pain, spirit lash, double mass hysteria, double shadow word death.  It‚Äôs hard to aggro that down with minions (Kingsbane Rogue doesn‚Äôt need a minion when it kills with weapons, so it aggros just fine, but most aggro decks struggle).  And playing a slower deck it‚Äôs hard to beat big priest‚Äôs lategame (you basically need to be an outright combo deck, darkest hour, dane shudderwock, togwaggle druid).
---
So IDK.  If you‚Äôre arguing that we should be able to beat big priest at least some of the time‚Äîyeah, they can draw dead.  But the deck is pretty good and beats a lot of the decks in the meta.
---
The success of the warlock spells one hinges on getting picking special minion that fills your hand with random spells. If you couple that with a minion that makes you immune to damage during your turn (there are a couple) you can dump an insane amount of spells/value in one turn that costs no health or mana.
---
The rogue stealth one can be done easily if you pick one or two of the special minions who are immune to damage and then buff up their attack. Cold blood synergies well for that reason.
---
If you're playing the wrench calibur version, you're playing bomb warrior. That isn't control warrior. Go to HSReplay and find a deck list.
---
Not really, Summoner Mages did incredibly well at Worlds and will still continue to do so. As for Mech Hunters, sure they will struggle against Rogues, but other than that, they have a solid chance against every other deck, except maybe Token Druid. Losing warrior wouldnt shake up the meta by a lot in my opinion but then warrior would be useless and I dont want that. 
---
The only way to fix this in my opinion is to buff paladins next expansion by giving them something only they are good at as Summoner mages pretty much do everything they do but better.
---
Thanks for your question! I‚Äôd estimate that i make around 0 gold a day.
---
Oof.  And by the way, I can't believe they've never printed any support for shadowform.  Just adding a card that tutors it or discounts it or adds a copy to your hand or whatever would be amazing
---
Myra into George can be really rough with all his early game. And then George basically gets completely assblasted by Russel.
---
I can‚Äôt see the bug
---
Granted I don't have tons of game time with Zul'jin, he is a great including to the meta mid-range Hunter deck. Most of your cards synergies well with him. At the very least, I usually end up with a few 5/5s with rush on the board or more. Plus, another masters call or two played to fill my hand again. Not a needed card, but if gives you that final push against a lot of control decks.
---
I've got 2200+ wins on ladder as Priest, it has always been my main and I can't agree more with the OP. It floors me they give value oriented hero cards to classes that are not control classes. It totally invalidates the strengths of value oriented classes. Could you imagine if Hagatha hero was a Priest card? I think that could go toe to toe with Warrior and Dr. Boom hero.
---
One thing I've thought of: what would it take to make Holy Nova a good card? I was thinking either reduce it to 4 mana or make the AOE 3 damage instead of 2. I'd also be totally fine with them making Excavated Evil a classic card. I don't think Lightbomb would fix things as it's 6 mana and doesn't even guarantee token type minions die. At least with EE you kill everything that's 3 health and under as long as it doesn't have divine shield. Plus it gives you the small chance an aggro deck will actually draw the copy shuffled in and slow them down a little.
---
Rekt.
---
Wrecked.
---
Now that you mention it, I believe you are right.  Good job open, that is a good pack! :D
---
They don‚Äôt care about Wild, and yet they nerfed Raza right before rotation.... Nope, they just handle everything as hoc.
---
I have the feeling that Mr Chu and George will be featured in the upcoming solo adventure. Since both are fully voiced emotes.
---
The other heroes just got recycled.
---
Thanks for your question! I don‚Äôt do the daylies anymore since day 4 ROS :D
---
....that is the bug, the black screen.
---
I disagree with most of the premises offered in this post, and will therefore reject the conclusion as well.
---
it's different for every event, very incosistent. usually also different for every person, because it takes time to deliver the packs correctly or something (like to make sure everyone who voted gets them and gets the correct amount)
---
The trick is to use Madam Lazuls passive so you can get cheap cards from your opponent. Worked for me at least.
---
Well, thing from below and Draenei Totemcarver ARE important cards in wild even Shaman.
---
I know I'm going to get downvoted for this but just don't watch the streams? This is the equivalent of complaining that someone saw a movie before you've gotten a chance to and you told them it's okay to give spoilers but you're mad when they do. No one is making you watch the streams. If you don't watch the stream, nothing is ruined for you.

It's Schroedinger's misuse! (To be clear, this is a joke about how many fuckers misuse and misunderstand this. It drives me insane.)

Oohh thats true, didnt really think of that for a hunter...even tho I watched trump recently struggling with subject 9 and his own hand.

It sounds like this is more of a complaint against netdecking more than against early access for streamers
---
has anyone ever contact their support about this issue to try and get 50 gold added to their account to replace the quest?
---
I don‚Äôt even like pre-expansion reveal streams. Drop it all at once, the hype is much higher. Look at apex legends, they dropped it and it blew up. Our favorite thing used to be going through all the cards at once when they‚Äôre released. Now we get drip fed for weeks and my excitement level never rises beyond mild interest, and when the sets are released, there‚Äôs already a meta. It sucks.
---
Pre-streaming single player adventures is an even more terrible idea.
---
""""fun""""
---
Unpopular opinion: dogs are fucking annoying and I don't like them.
---
Yeah, just being facetious.
---
Who ever thinks its a good idea to replace our quests without letting us know well they need to rethink that idea a lot...
---
Any reason why the win 3 game to get 10 gold is disabled in this brawl?  Is it a bug?
---
There have been other brawl that is fast like the 1 mana cost where it can end the game in several turns and it still give progress to the 10 gold/3 win.
---
I have not tried that. I'd be interested in the result though.
---
Don't watch streamers.
---
Nope it doesn't, my gold counter stays the same and hdt tracker keep it at 2/3 even though i won 9 games in brawl so far. I play 1 casual game and it increases normally.
---
Everything you said is correct. The competitive meta is shaped by humans and single player content is a finite experience. But I am confused. Did you miss my first sentence? He wants the **competitive meta** of a new expansion not to be altered by prerelease streams that theory craft decks which will in turn be a large part ofthe meta for the first few days. 
---
Single player content has nothing to do with this complaint.
---
Nice.
---
its not on us when they drop a new quest for the brawl without letting anyone know and especially since they have added a 4th quest slot before for special quests.
---
For some reason games won in the brawl doesn't count towards 10gold/3 games.
---
and booms scheme lol
---
Oh, but he did! Until he got into a cavern and our hero killed him in the dungeon run, unless they then ran into some mishaps getting outta the cavern !
---
Like Valve and Artifact?
---
They clearly know this is an issue, but they haven't prioritized changing it.  Best way to get it bumped in priority is to make it a bigger issue for them, and taking up their support's time responding seems like a good start.
---
Yes, let's ignore the fanbase and tell them to shut up because we know what's better for them and how they should be told to play our content.
---
What could go wrong?
---
Ahh. From your reply above, since I hadn't mentioned "Control Warrior" I assumed you were just generally speaking to control style play with Warrior when you mentioned it. Because Bomb is very much  a control deck and I am indeed using the Bomb package atm. I know that (uppercase 'C') Control Warrior is it's own deck too, heh ;)
---
that's why they give you boom so you can change it asap
---
Sry i dont care about that game so i dont know what Valve did.
---
Better to use Archmage Vargoth as a Mind Blast finisher (or Divine Hymn) over fully upgrading your Shadowform Hero Power.
---
I play Cho quite a bit for fun and he is in one of my ladder decks. Good to combo off later in game, steals opponent cards which feeds your non-class card effects, can give your opponent junk they can‚Äôt use (summon pirates, poison on your dagger, etc.), and with echo cards you can fill their hand easily and they have a hard time getting rid of them because each echo you cast is a new card for your opponent.
---
I'll check again later, but I've played only brawl matches and my gold has gone up. I did log out right as I won and the gold popped when I logged in so maybe there is some kind of weird bug.
---
You‚Äôre right. Give him time to think about his life choices that brought him to this moment until he concedes out of shame.
---
A friend of mine recently started playing Hearthstone on his phone, but never created a Blizzard account. He has since gotten an ipad and wants to play on there. Is there a way for him to get his collection onto there?
---
It was a free pack too! Haha
---
artifact had people playing the game for a whole year before releasing it to public , and we all know how well that went.
---
&gt; REQ_FRIENDLY_MINIONS_OF_RACE_DIED_THIS_GAME=17
---
weird, what's this?
---
Okay that's quite a brought spectrum. Are you using Hearthpwn, cause they have a collection tracker (innkeeper) and I usually check what my odds are of opening stuff, since you can see how complete you are with your collection. The collection tracker in Hearthstone deck tracker is also a motivator. (if I have over a certain percentage of my collection complete I just don't buy anymore usually this around 80% and depending on my level of intoxication by alcohol). 
---
But as it stands now I would suggest to not buy packs at all (or as least as possible). This due to the dropping popularity of the game. Numbers show that players are massively walking out on the game so it is either likely that Blizzard will have more deals to engage players like you, or you are investing in a dying product and you'll feel disappointed.
---
WOOF I always get better cards in the packs I get from going 0-x in arena

Kill all of their creatures instead of going face and win with your late game make 5 tokens.

---
I understand the point made here, but I‚Äôm not sure what the answer to the question ‚Äújust don‚Äôt watch it then?‚Äù is.
---
So don't watch the streams.
---
Business comes first, otherwise HS dies. If they didn't think it made good financial sense to do it they wouldn't.
---
This is one of the snowflakiest things I can think of on here.
---
Just looked into this, you should still be getting your 10 gold per 3 wins. The dialogue after each game doesn't display correctly, but it *is* still working.
---
Coin coin coin Barnes with hagatha was probably one of my favorite turn one nonsense plays I've ever had
---
He does say, "You killed Karl!" in the Dungeon Run encounter.
---
You sound bitter
---
As your edit says this is actually a popular opinion.  
---
Anyway just wanted to show my support / agreement.  Let them have access at the same time as we do.  We can still watch them if we want, but let us have that experience (playing cards for the first time without net decks) for at least one day like they get to.  There are other ways to hype releases.
---
Anyway the whole way they've done this solo mode has been frustrating (less packs than you get for gold, announcing announcements, I also heard we get a wing at a time instead of everything at once) is frustrating.  I really like solo mode so I'll still use my gold for it and skip the streamers.  But hopefully blizz listens up and

---
&gt;Streamers are core to the community and keep Hearthstone going. I love watching them and have watched them since Beta
---
I never watch streams I rather play the game, but I do watch on youtube a game or 10
---
I completely agree, but this clearly wasn‚Äôt an unpopular opinion and you‚Äôre lying if you thought it was. It was the immediate consensus with a majority of the community the second it was announced.
---
But it isn't a case of "work toward" that. They can flip that switch now. They flipped it by accident before! Then they realised they didn't want things that way, and flipped it back. 
---
I agree it totally makes sense to have it so that extra quests are extra. But I don't know how it could be clearer that blizzard does not. They chose it to be this way, knowing full well people liked it the other way.

Or be any deck with Madame Lazul effect vs. any high minion deck that chooses that coin effect, at some point in the game the opponent usually has too many coins to use effectively and you can cycle through it pretty well.
---
I'm not a priest player, but I think that if you remove OTK combo cards from classic, then the resurrect mechanics will be fine. The point in resurrecting like 3 minions with high HP at the same time is that if you can't clear them all and leave one alive with at least 8 HP, then you're basically dead because of the Inner Fire + Divine Spirit BS. This is what makes it frustrating most of the time. Resurrecting minions is OK, as long as it doesn't serve as a way to set up an OTK.
---
And then you can fill these empty classic slots with some reliable AOE's.
---
This is by far the most enjoyable Brawl we've ever had
---
I agree. Its like by the time we get acess theres already a meta established restricting deck building.

Sometimes I stagger even myself with my genius. -Jeremy Clarkson -MrRgrs
---
with priest you can win many games just by having turn 1 inner fire (or turn 1-2 spells that give +health and then inner fire), I'd say that   bwomsandi's covenant (heal = dmg to enemy) is the easier one.  
---
for druid, gonk's armament (refresh mana when gain armor), it's a very strong power in itself plus you can get the "when gain armor, draw card, costs 2 less" 3/4 guy for 4 mana    
---
for mage jan'alai's progeny freeze ( add frostfire). frostfires are strong with spell power, but the real star is the "whenever you play a spell, cast fireball to random enemy" guy    
---
for shaman, 0/2 give +x attack equal to overload when you overload 
---
for warrior, Akali's champion (x/8 shrine attack = armor)  
---
these last two are fairly similar, they allow you to bring damage when they revive right away, killing your opponent  
---
against later  enemies, fights 6-8 they'll have so much health you'll be forced to play a fatigue game where you may have to spend all your resources to kill your enemies as efficiently as possible, you'll have to kill all their cards. you'll have to not play your  draw-take out of deck cards.

I play Big Priest without Barnes in Wild. Am I okay, or does everyone hate me too?
---
Well it's a battle cry but the text of the battle cry says it gains the deathrattle, so I think if a Myra is played, then cubed, you should get the deathrattle version, but if it is pulled like with dirty rat, then cubed, it will come back as a plain 4/2.

Would be interesting to see a video from a pro testing this.

You can get to Legend with a deck that costs less than 2000 dust.
---
Here are some examples:

---
You can reroll the quest to try and get it back tho
---
...Fanmade?
---
Then what's the point of clearing the quest when you can just wait and get the gold for free?
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love that as a casual player but yea, there would be a problem on HS side
---
The blizzard defenders always crawl out of the woodworks to swear up and down that players are unreasonable.  We aren't.  They are the multimillion dollar company and they can do the minimum for their customers.

Did you play the game before Ungoro? Divine spirit+Inner fire was a joke for 4 years. It only became competitive with Shadow Visions.
---
Cube also doesn‚Äôt keep its deathrattle when hit by another cube, so it seems like either a brawl bug or a Myra bug
---
Why would you guys watch someone play a solo adventure lol
---
You can get all the way to Legend with a deck that costs less than 2000 dust. There is no particular reason to farm at a low rank, you can complete quests in friendly games too if you get quests for classes you have no good cards for.

Ironic that you‚Äôre here then huh?

Is there a specific deck you want to play?
---
name a single rogue heal that lasts for more than a single weapon swing, and isn't neutral
---
Are you people high? They are doing this as a marketing stunt to hype the single player content, not to let streamers spoil it...
---
Is everyone just complaining cause they don't understand release cycles and want it the arbitrary 2 days earlier?
---
If you want to remain single content virgins just don't watch it. Easy...
---
This sub just goes so far out of it's way to complain about the dumbest shit like a streamer event, when there are so many more reasonable things they could complain about. I really do not get it.
---
It depends on the deck. Some deck rely on specific cards as their main win conditions, others are more flexible. Holy Wrath Paladin obviously cannot work without Shirvallah, the Tiger, whereas Bomb Hunter is fine without Boommaster Flark.
---
Bomb Hunter is a good deck to play to Legend. There are several others too, such as Tempo Rogue, Control Warrior, Bomb Warrior, and Secret Hunter.
---
I‚Äôm waiting too. It‚Äôs getting pretty annoying with each delay and I‚Äôm wondering if it will even be worth playing the in decks I have planned by then.

how many legendary quests are there per year?  a dozen or so?  i think they can afford that amount of free gold in order to stop pissing off the community every time this happens

Garrosh's weapon was extremely strong. That was the reason it saw play in Quest Warrior ( that and the hero power being strong against Dude/Odd Paladin). The weapon was almost like 3 flamestrikes for 8 mana.

Blizzard's choices in Hearthstone follows a simple principle: Is it helping sell packs (directly or indirectly)- If yes quickly implement it. 
---
If it's nether directly nor indirectly selling packs - don't bother with it even If it's easy to implement.

A budget Murloc Shaman is pretty cheap and can get you climbing pretty well. I really enjoy it and have had pretty good success with it in general
