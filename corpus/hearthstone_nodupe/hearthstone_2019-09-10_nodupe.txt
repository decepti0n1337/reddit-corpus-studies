Blocked for trolling

The meme of memes!
---
I made a deck with the mogu cultist problem is all the aggro decks and rogue hurting on mass removal. I've gotten to point I had it ready to go 5 times but the bastards won't let me play it they keep quitting after I get all the materials. Of course they tend to have 20 or less health by then to. It's mechathun all over again everyone quits before the meme kill.
---
My favorite card back. I love this.
---
The chances of drawing all 3 combo pieces by turn 4 is highly unlikely. Most times, Sniplock gets run over by true aggro decks before they get their combo.
---
Lol this must be a meme I am unaware of.
---
They had a backdrop requirement when they first started and have dropped it ironically enough.
---

---
Also your problem with it is absurd and very much a you and 0.0001% of viewers problem that's not worth pandering to.
---
It's likely some wierd phobia disorder honestly
---
Beddle berry
---
lol. So it couldn't attack or replace it's weapon?
---
biggatron#1602 NA, I'll show and you go first.
---
Academic espionage. Its the ultimate burgle card that just doesn't seem to work in burgle decks. It's always so close to being good, but never quite there.
---
Undatakah. All the classes that dont kill you to quickly have polymorph and hex / silence cards and then your screwed. The decks that use the card are far too inconsistent and draw order based.
---
So put it back the way it was for the highlander deck that maximized the benefit in the first place?  
---
No.
---
I play her in quest priest. Boy is it useful vs warrior to get extra damage off her.
---
Blame quests.  
---
If you're going to have quests that basically win the player the game by turn 4/5 then you need aggro to combat it.
---
Not a bad way for diehard Evenlocks to try to cheese out wins against Secret Mage without having to be down a card against other decks by running direct Secret tech.
---
Hunter Warrior Paladin Shaman Druid Priest Warlock Rogue Mage
---
Well, let's see...
---
Name a meta where Hunter hasn't been at least a tier 2 deck.
---
Warrior has some of the most flexibility in deck building at the moment, and control is cheap, yet effective deck archetype.
---
Paladin can just summon a board of seven minions as early as turn 3 (coin, hit your big spell and a whisp with Prismatic Lens). On average, like turn 5, and lethal around turn 6 or 7 (similar kill potential to Odd Rogue back when it was in standard).
---
Battlecry Shaman is a very oppressive and aggressive deck that applies a ton of pressure, with a very easy, yet powerful hero power that used to be a minion from Un'Goro, but better. Also, Lackeys are huge carry potential for this deck to go off on. Lacks pretty hard on the consistent draw though, hence why it runs such basic minions for draw and increasing hand size (lackey generators both for cards and quest completion).
---
Druid has a pretty decent quest deck, and honestly, decks from last expansion (mech, token, control, etc are either just as good, or better now; maybe slightly worse with some of the nerfs).
---
Priest just wombo-combos you with divine inner fire/topsy, abusing large hp minions, if they ever draw into it.
---
Rogue has obscenely good value, hence why it's not dead last, but as good as the quest is, you need insane RNG off Lackeys/Discover/Random Cards to win.
---
Mage is just Highlander, let's be honest. You just play it like you would against old Highlander and assume they don't have the cards they need to win. Chances are they don't. And even if they do, it's still a dice roll if they win half the time.
---
not true
---
IIRC that Kadgar is more like a hero power than a card?
---
I demand immediate dust refused for all Secrets, Weapons, anything that can be silence, or anything that can be killed by Big Game Hunter or either Shadow Word card.
---
I play a bunch of stuff, a lot of highlander stuff rogue pally even my own druid. Then there are malyngos hunter, quest warlock etc
---
and a 8/8 on turns 3-5 was deemed op
---
This guy . You Need to get laid bud.

---
But why not pay the 1 extra for owl
---
.... what? No.
---
From experience, and that's limited to rank 5 and just watching GMs, druid seems the weakest of the 4 main meta decks, Combo Priest, Quest Shaman, Control Warrior, and Quest Druid, then there is Highlander Hunter but that one feels hard to place, but is at least popular.
---
I thini the difference with druid is they're super explosive with things like Cenarious and double Nourish, but they have limited resources unlike shaman or warrior.
---
Fuck off
---
Hey it me !
---
Thanks for the support buddy, this kind of *random* act means a lot
---
I just didn't want to make two trips
---
Just you wait until I get to 10 mana.
---
Kai said in that thread re: (3) he had been offered those cards in drafts, so they either became undraftable quasi-recently or are considered "undraftable" because of bucket and relative draft skill of the HSReplay/DeckTracker user.
---
If they release a new card that makes, for instance, heroic KT from Naxx absolutely trivial .. who would genuinely care? The vast majority of people wouldn't care even in the slightest, a small percentage of people would love having an easier method of beating content, and a minuscule fraction of PvE aficionados would, if sane, simply choice to not use that card when partaking in that encounter.
---
The beauty of solo content is it doesn't actually need to be balanced. Now obviously you want it to be enjoyable, ideally a good challenge, etc., but ultimately it serves to give the players a means to find a way to enjoy the game themselves. I went back and tried to beat some of the old pve content with janky combo decks just to see if it could be done. It's fun. And honestly if they made a card that enabled an easier combo I'd prefer it since I get the same desired outcome (victory) without as much reliance upon luck.
---
I know they'll never make constructed solo content ever again since the main selling point of dungeon run is it requires no collection to play. They'd rather sell you the $20 pre-order and get your money then than hope you'll spend $200 every expansion to keep up with enough cards to beat the solo content every time.
---
The Day9 playing against "Secret Paladin Mage" has to be the last one in the top 3, right?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG64gTC3A9w&amp;t=5m16s
---
They should introduce an unsilence mechanic. Would be interesting to see it used. Maybe put it on a legendary minion and make it “unsilence all minions”. 6 mana 3/4.
---
Edit: further it’s difficulty to use make it a deathrattle that works on itself. So even if it is silenced when it dies it triggers it’s own deathrattle somehow. Would be pretty cool.
---
You think this is degenerate? Do you not remember Nagalock? Draw 1 card by turn 5 (or 4 on the coin) and instantly win the game unless facing a Druid with Poison Seeds in hand. Sniplock is a middling deck at best in a format where you can do far worse things by turn 4. The top meta aggro decks are winning games on turns 4-6 consistently.
---
Not even 12 hours later
---
So why are you salty with a guy playing on his house showing his bed in a game you haven't touched in months? Mate, I agree wth the other guy, you need to get some and relax.
---
Yea

Spellbreaker and Lynessa? After the game they got drinks and last I heard they're dating now
---
I watch grandmasters and thijs but I don't play
---
&gt; I mean, you play around flamestrike explosive trap, concecration and the likes if youre semi decend, why not mct
---
Look, I want to be clear about something here; if Consecrate was neutral I would be fine with that.
---
Consecrate isn't RNG bullshit.  MCT is.
---
I casted a drink-coaster shaped block of plaster and carved into it using clay and woodworking tools. It's technically a relief sculpture if you want to be specific.
---
Thank you! I'd love a pink lemond variant. I might make one.
---
Depends at what rank you are. Control warrior is still by far the best deck in the game. Well maybe not by far anymore. I also think that it's starting to get hit by player fatigue (hehehe) since it's not the most fun deck to play and the games are so long. But my message was also refering to end of ROS where the meta was play mage, warrior or something that can kill mage fast. Basically rock paper scissors and that just didn't appeal to me.
---
If you're going pro, you need to memorize the cards and interactions/synergies. You need to minimize your misplays.
---
Also, there will also be occasions where the pro player will be playing in a foreign country and will play localized clients in that country's language. Imagine not knowing a card and you can't read the text because it's in Chinese/Korean/Spanish/etc.
---
I mean, the only highlander payoff card I'd have to craft for mage is Kazakus (I already crafted Zephrys, and I opened new reno).
---
The problem is that I'm pretty sure the deck needs Kalecgos too, as I often find myself controlling the board for ages, but out of stuff to do by turn 10 (plus it's just good with Kazakus 10 mana potions).  Maybe also some other legendaries I don't have like Pyros.  And to fill in 30 cards the deck probably wants a number of epics I don't have like Arcane Keysmith and Kodorider.  So like...it's probably a 4k-6k dust investment.
---
Thats my favorite cardback too!
---
That is really well done, looks so refreshing.
---
problem is you've got to get to the kodo.
---
Agree. Using a 4 mana card to deal with an opponent say 10 mana card is gaining tempo because you can use 6 mana to do other plays.
---
Tempo = speed you play cards = do things including attacking. 
---
Value/card advantage = gaining relatively more resources such that in the long run you will win.
---
Tempo is actually a surprisingly difficult concept to differentiate from resource advantage .
---
Some many consider mana a resource but the main difference is the mana pool regenerates every turn (with exceptions of Nourish etc) and doesn't carry forward
---
Defeat for both, I suppose
---
-mock up a square version of your card back on photoshop
---
-make a mold of a drink coaster you like using silicone
---
-cast a new coaster out of plaster
---
-use graphite transfer paper to put the design on to the plaster cast
---
-carve it
---
-clean it carefully
---
-seal fragile areas with industrial superglue and the rest with shellac
---
-prime with gesso
---
-paint with acrylic paint
---
-seal using varnish
---
If you've never casted, carved, or painted before, I would not recommend this as a project. It's way too finnicky, expensive, and time consuming for the final result.
---
Flat enough, eveything comes to the same contact point.

---
Gogo98baj#1165 NA 80g challenge a friend I'll show you go first.
---
I'd like to say Linecracker, I was one of the only few to instantly see it as a possibly insane card (for wild) and now we have infinite armor druid. So I guess I can't say Linecracker anymore.  
---
Another favourite that comes to mind is Hakkar. It's the ultimate counter to other stall decks in combination with Archivist. Even used to play deathratttle/shuffle rogue with Hakkar to a decent succes.  
---
Hakkar is practicly a game winning effect like Mechathun or the Four Horseman
---
I'M IN CHARGE NOW
---
Congrats!
---
Sounds like a pitch in shark tank xD
---
Hmm didn't see you mention RoS in your comment above, so no clue you were referring to that meta. Maybe add to it for context?
---
Even highlander is more mid range than straight out aggro but you are right.
---
Goodness me, I think I'm content to just appreciate great art. Well done!!
---
I just dusted my moorabi
---
Alright, piggybacking on my own comment to do some analysis on what the meta would actually look like....
---
Without coin: 6 cards by turn 3 (enough to spend all your mana on 1 drops).   With coin: 7 cards by turn 3 (enough to spend all your mana on 1 drops).
---
Grimscale Oracle/Timber Wolf/Brazen Zealot/Murloc Tidecaller are all pretty similar.  Power 1 drops that if undisrupted kill on turn 4 (turn 3 with coin...except Tidecaller that still kills on 4 with coin, but has a bit more health).
---
Patches just beats all of the murloc-esque cards I think, while also dealing 28 damage by turn 5 if up against something like mind blast (can be brought up to 32 with a ping hero power, or 36 with a hunter hero power).  Worth noting, I think Patches Druid beats mind blast priest even when going second.  Priest would need to heal twice to get out of the 32 damage range, healing even once when going first slows down their kill.  Meanwhile, the 1 armour that druid gets puts them out of range of a turn 5 kill.
---
Meanwhile...I was joking about Bring it On Warrior before but...I'm pretty sure it actually just beats Patches decks in fatigue.  7 damage a turn isn't enough, and playing patches catapults them towards fatigue.  (Obviously also beats mind blast).  But equally obviously, loses to the power 1 drop builds that can output 49 damage per turn.
---
Pogo Hopper Rogue is a new contender that wasn't around the last time they did one of these and might just be the meta breaker though.  Kills on turn 4 with or without coin (fast enough to beat mind blast), but the 1 drop vs 1 drop matchups often have a lot of trading, and pogo wins the trade war; eventually topdecked Murloc Tidecallers are 1/2s and topdecked pogos are 15/15.
---
I'm struggling to even think of an anti-deck that beats Pogo.  I guess Doomsayer Hunter/Druid.  Yeah, Pogos can't actually beat that, since the first Pogos are small.  Is 50-50 against murlocs and friends (with coin murlocs can kill the first doomsayer).  Against Patches it depends which class is being played.  Although I think Doomsayer Warrior will 100% beat any patches deck thanks to fatigue (unless the patches player gets a hard read and literally plays nothing, pulling no cards out of their deck).  Doomsayer Warrior does lose to pogo, though (get pogos up to 7/7 and wait for a turn when they don't doomsayer) so I think it needs to be Druid or Hunter, which maybe makes the patches matchup close...?  Obviously Mind Blast is an option to beat Doomsayer decks.
---
OK, so is Mind Blast/Pogo Hopper/Doomsayer the rock/paper/scissors?  Well in the context of those three a new challenger emerges.  Mogu Cultist.  Mogu Cultist beats Mind Blast (by jamming all the Mogu Cultists immediately) and Doomsayer (by waiting until turn 7).  Mogu Cultist loses to any competent minion deck though.
---
I guess there's another interesting challenger deserving mention: Cheaty Anklebiter.  Cheaty Anklebiter also beats Doomsayer (by using the battlecry to hit face, or if it's Warrior Doomsayer just waiting until they run out of doomsayers and then making a board of 2/1s) and beats Mind Blast (2/1 lifesteal is great).  And probably beats some or all of the murloc-esque builds.  Loses to Pogos.
---
So...Mogu Cultist or Cheaty Anklebiter?  I'm not actually sure which one wins heads up, since Ankebiter doesn't kill that fast.  Actually, Druid Mogu Cultist probably wins because it can hero power down enough anklebiters to survive till playing 7 cultists in one turn...I think (it's kind-of close if the cultist player doesn't have coin, but I think they still win at like...1 HP against a hunter Cheaty Ankle Biter player).  Or...I guess Mage Mogu Cultist definitely wins that if it becomes a problem match.
---
So...rock-paper-scissors is probably Pogo/Doomsayer/Mogu Cultist?  Replace Cultist with Cheaty Anklebiter if you expect sub-optimal decks like murlocs.  Not sure if there's something that would beat all three of Mogu Cultist, Anklebiter, and Doomsayer.  I guess Murkspark Eel?  (Murkspark Eel does actually lose to Mind Blast though, so hey, Mind Blast is back to having some relevance).
---
It helps if u are playing aggresively or controlling, u stop ur opponent healing a lot of the time and can repeat it with shudderwock
---
In contrast spellbreaker battlecry could hit ur own minion with shudderwock, which this guy doesnt...
---
Oh yeah, mobile is terrible now. For some reason it automatically 'updates' once a day on my phone even thougj nothing is changed or is going to change. Theres a lot wrong with mobile HS currently.
---
Nice
---
SPOILERS :P
---
It does, but I took this deck from rank 5 to legend. The meta shifts a little between ranks, but generally the best decks are all still around the same win rate. Piloted well, this deck should have no problem winning games. Even decks designed to target it don't have strong match ups against it.
---
But admittedly this deck is hard to pilot. I took a little break from it and I've come back and I'm struggling at rank 5. Only just getting back into the swing of it now. Murloc decks have high win rates and are super cheap if you want to climb, but if you're looking to climb with priest there really is no substitute for watching streamers, learning how to play the deck, learning the match ups and practicing.
---
"...you make freezing return a crap minion, etc."
---
or evne better make it return a minion you'd want to reuse, so that you can plus off their secrets.
---
a freezing trap against a battlecry heavy deck can be outright suicidal if the right battlecries  are available.
---
Ft2, Thief Rogue all the way, Tess was autocraft when she came out, my personal best was rank 5 few expansions ago, now i am usually somewhere between ranks 15 and 10.
---
Insert penis to into her
---
I think it should be 5 cost, change cost of minions to 3 mana.
---
i'd be down for HoF'ing DS....
---
IF you give priest a usable win condition  to replace it that can be done somewhat consistently and can be built around, like you have with classes like druid and shaman.
---
if you just flat out remove it you face the problem of priest lacking the abiltiy ot actually finish off their oppenent in a pinch
---
Half the video was just fucking bells.
---
But yeah that looks like the dream.
---
OP is a developer's 2nd acc and will enable this brawl again and ban everything that was said in this thread.
---
I played it last expansion in a Togwaggle Scheme Miracle deck.  It was actually pretty reasonable.  Sadly, the Prep nerf totally gutted that deck.
---
It's got Spellstone now too.
---
what's weird botu the wording?
---
it heals for 3, if the targets is a minion it also buffs them by 3/3 worth of stats
---
what's what the quest heror power does  it turns lesser heal inot a heal/buffing spell
---
there might be some new quest shaman lists out there, but in my experience playing it, unless all your pressure has 1 health I'm dead to a fast early game. the decks best possible early play is a 1/1 that deals 2 damage on turn 2, which needs coin and a lackey generator, or a river croc that replaces the quests lost card. if you hate quest shaman just make big minions early and its helpless.
---
You do realise that card is what made singleton mage so strong right?
---
BOTU
---
Yea you get a Lady Liadrin once you hit level 20 in World of Warcraft
---
Happy birthday, awesome cake very creative!
---
Don't worry, they're almost certainly going to HoF Divine Spirit, so we won't have to worry about Inner Fire priest after that.
---
Sure why not?
---
Golden Murloc Tinyfin.
---
Kinda yeah
---
*Gattling wand noises*
---
This card give me lethal couple of times when i got it from random effects playing shaman. Its most powerful when not expected.
---
According to this thread, you can't: https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/lady-liadrin-wow-classic/13502/2
---
cool hyena but that was painful to see your opponent waste so much damage with the longbow, he would have easily won by going full face
---
also you had no reason to trade the last 3 hounds, it just helps him in case of deadly shot
---
Not in Wow Classic though, which is different from the main World of Warcraft.
---
Shudderwock is pretty much required for quest shaman. Barista Lynchen enhances the deck but isn't necessary. I use a token Quest shaman without Shudderwock (Although it would be really good if it did). It's decent.

---

---
Lightwell too op, please nerf.
---
Mummy is not that bad. It usually results in sub optimal plays from the oponent and you can hit them for 5 at least twice.
---
Other then twilight guardian what dragons would benefit? I’d never run Lady in White in dragon Priest, it’s too slow for not enough payoff.
---
I don't think DS is that much of an issue. I understand your frustration because it seems like you lost out of nowhere, but keep in mind that combo priest is exactly that... a combo priest. So it basically it means that if it doesn't achieve the combo, it has no way of killing you. And not achieving the combo is something that happens a lot tbh. 
---
Priest is arguably the worst class in terms of classic set, which means that all viable priest decks are significantly different from one another (as opposed to shaman or druid for example). Which means that if you are just an average player, you are able to KNOW that you are playing against a combo priest by turn 2 or 3. And if you know, all you have to do is keep a taunt on board and keep his minions low on health which is totally OK tbh compared to other stuff we see/saw on HS (DK priest where u at). The combo is not an OTK (at least TTK maybe more since no charge minion has enough health to be put on the board and DS DS IF the same turn and OS)  so it's predictable. From my perspective, shit like malygos moonfire moonfire is way worse and is totally not predictable/outplayable. Priest is totally outplayable, as I said he can only DS one minion, if you have a taunt on board it won't be able to OS you (and yes I know priests run silence but you also run more than a single taunt so... and please don't tell me about mass dispell it's 4 mana... if he MD + DS + DS + IF on the same turn, it means that it's at least turn 9 and he already had a minion with enough health from one turn before to kill you on that turn : by turn 9 if you playing aggro you already won or you already know it's lost, if you playing control you have 200000 ways of removing minions from the board on turn 8 so there's no way he has targets for his DS on turn 9).  
---
As long as you can play around the win condition, it's not OP. I can share a pretty big list of decks (from previous extensions and this one) that had just unpredictable/un-outplayable win conditions and were just totally OP). Combo priest is totally fine tbh. I do understand however that is feels bad being killed with that though.
---
It’s better than that since you get to do it again.
---
Is it possible that they didn't log in during the "Free golden Sn1p-Sn4p" period? How long was it, 1 week?

Has he unlocked all of the classes yet? Pretty sure you have to unlock all 9 playable classes first.

Ohhhhhh WOW! I made that deck but without the Glowstones ( Dont have them) and I am on a 8 game win streak. Lost only once against a shaman with both devolves in his starting hand. Damn that deck is fun. Thanks !

I'd guess part of your frustrations are that quest shaman is pretty efficient so it can chew through non-optimized decks. It sucks because I love janky combo decks, but swapping to anything aggressive can often beat down quest shaman before they get rolling.

I think it is also because the meta is pretty hostile to rogue in general. While tempo rogue has its niche, it doesn't have many particularly outstanding matchups since mage took a nosedive. That is important because Rogue performs poorly against murloc paladin, and gets stomped by aggro warrior, Control Warrior and quest druid. Rogue does have a decent matchup against highlander hunter, but that doesn't really make up for its bad performance against other prominent decks.

Is cabal rat the only neutral generator?

I can't imagine it's the biggest money maker. Though I suppose it does act as a coin dump. Making people have to buy more bundles

Wasn't there a message for maintenance on the launcher for at least 24 hours?
---
Can't join US server, game works in EU right now.
---
I thought they had warmed that they were doing maintenance this morning.
---
Can't get on right now either, probably just maintenance
---
Keep dreaming.
---
Yes mighty wisdom ball.
---
This is true, but I was hoping for something more official like a metal print with a lamination over it or something or like that.
---
You could also include deranged doctors. Heal you your 8. But I just don’t see why you’d run Hakkar when you have no way of destroying your deck. Maybe you play Hakkar, kill it, then play Myra’s with a full hand followed by Espionage? That way you don’t have bloods in your deck but your opponent does
---
Whens it going to be done?

Makes sense the all-class generator would be the most popular one.
---
What is the lightwarden doing on this log? The kodo destroyed only Amet, right?
---
It is a good point but even so it's your card. We shoudl be able to do whatever we want with our cards.
---
Its pretty bs tbh. If I was a newer player and got the adventure and grinded just to get it I should be able to dust it. They did not say it was undustable when it was announced
---
I didn't link a deck. That was data on the entire archetype, and most Hooktusk decks are Highlander to begin with (check the popular decks tab).
---
Hooktusk isn't irredeemable. It is just about good enough to reach legend with, but on average it still performs worse than Tempo (which in turn performs poorly to options in other classes). When it comes to statistical averages, the Rogue class is only better than mage.
---
I think the blockers are purely financial. They don't see the cost benefit of it when people just keep buying expansions.
---
Just watch kripp
---
&gt;not allowed to stream while GM is running 
---
Well, why would Team 5 and Blizzard want their hypemen to actively compete with them for viewership?
---
more like gallon but zalae quotes him a lot
---
I don’t think Blizzard should care if i watch GM or RDU, as long as it is HS, now i stop watching GM bc I don’t have that much time and it is sometimes boring asf.
---
Speaking from experience and without large amounts of data to back up this claim, I can't remember a game where doing this worked out for me (and I have about 2k ladder wins with druid).  
---
I agree that lategame favors you heavily, but to me lategame means that my opponent starts to get low on cards and therefor struggles to sequence his hand in a way that efficiently uses all his mana. if they start floating some mana over a few turns, that's the point where lategame start having significantly stronger turns which hopefully turns into a win in the end. At the beginning of the game, having extra mana crystals does not mean that they start to float mana immediately, though.   
---
BUT, (a) druids turn two is weak (there are very few playable cards at that point) so most often you'll follow that project up with a simple hero power. (b) it put's you down a card - not something to aim for when you want to get to a point where you're opponent runs out of cards. (c) they get to use the mana to develop. keep in mind it's the start of the game. they have a full hand. their deck is full of lowcost stuff, so they can most likely use **all** of those extra mana for at least two to three extra turns. that tempo swing is hard to come back from.  
---
tl;dr: playing project early actively looses you a lot of tempo. you can reap the fruits only in about three turns from now.
---
Thanks. Wasn't sure if it dropped today or tomorrow, so good I still have some time to finish my quests.
---
That is awesome!
---
I remember when I thought cable rat was going to be just an ok card *nervous chuckle*

Wow, [[Sludge Slurper]] is in 16% of all decks????

RDU isn't a streamer who competes, he's a competitor who streams. He  is sponsored for that reason. He takes it seriously. Again if you don't like that you should watch someone else. There's a reason he is grinding top legend all the time, because he's good enough to compete with the very best, and that's his goal.
---
This is the last of my hamon
---
Dude, we’re the majority...
---
That was wild!

Yes, I’ve been getting that a lot lately, thought one guy actually had that name, went to add him and it showed his name then.
---
Evil Genius= best
---
last time warlock had enough health gain to accommodate for cards like that they were a fucking nightmare lol
---
Yes, Firebat has a video on his YouTube channel from the beginning of the expansion of him running that deck.
---
This isn’t unprecedented, though, specifically with cards that are uncraftable.
---
They did this back in 2013 with golden Elite Tauren Chieftan (everyone who attended Blizzcon 2013 got a golden ETC.  You can neither craft nor disenchant golden ETC.  You can craft and disenchant a non-golden ETC).
---
Sometimes with cards that can’t be disenchanted they change the policy when it rotates to wild (old adventure cards were not disenchantable until they rotated).  So maybe that will happen with Zayle.
---
But I really doubt it in this case, because Zayle is most similar to the promo ETC.  golden version is the promo version; golden version is neither craftable nor disenchantable.  (Non golden version is craftable and disenchantable).
---
They never changed golden ETC to disenchantable and I doubt they’ll ever change golden Zayle either.
---
That doesnt explain why the solo stuff still doesnt have to cost real money (aka free).
---
If "bad quarters" was a legitimate reason, the solo stuff would require RMT.
---
Not for gold tho
---
Thank you!
---
They're the items that appear when you open the door in the top right of the gameboard. They have nothing to do with the adventure.
---
The things that don't get done are the things that aren't:
---
1) Revenue producing
---
2) Mobile friendly
---
I continue to maintain that #2 is the biggest blocker of improvements.  They do not want the mobile experience to be inferior to the PC experience b/c the think it will, ultimately, drive people away from the game.
---
If this were a PC only title, we'd have a number of features that simply don't work on mobile for want of real estate and/or horsepower.
---
I havent paid real money for their solo content in years...
---

That looks awesome, is there a way to easily see all the cards though? It makes it kind of hard to see everything and to properly judge the whole expansion.

Then tell her she's bloody amazing at makin cakes, k? K.
---
&gt; and the ability to deal 2 damage in the early game was overestimated
---
Yeah, we had a pretty rogue/mage heavy meta, both of which decent answers to an early 0/2. Both of these are conveniently the 2 worst classes now.
---
Thanks! This is one of my favorite YouTube videos in general, just a perfect summary of what I love about YouTube.
---
Lol I was about to ask why and then I realized! Thanks for the quote
---
Khartut Defender in specific is so good in gonna miss Rotten Applebaum as well both cards make Warlock decks outside of Zoo actually ok to play.
---
I tried her out after opening for the same reason. Even hitting one target to set up a big vial turn earlier or to safely combo the 3/4 in one turn. Also kept whiffing Barnes by hitting the 3/4 or Baron Rivendare (who I couldn't resist lol). The 1/7 is actually somewhat likely to stick for a turn.

Does Toki, world jumper do what I think it would do? Wait for another person playing Hearthstone to also play toki, world jumper and then you swap boards?

You know what's even more dumb? The fact that an announcement has to be made either way. The fact that there isn't a "bonus quest" slot *five years after the game launched* is insane.

Hmm...Google translate translates this (from Hebrew) as "conquering terror", but also asks if I meant "טרור וושט", which is apparently Yiddish for "terror esophagus".

---
&gt;My fiance gave me this birthday cake &lt;3

FTFY
---
It's the Shadow from [[Shadow of Death]]. It's a "Casts When Drawn" card.
---
I had this idea too, if you try to queue up it gives you an error saying the deck is invalid :(
---
I really didn’t see it tbh
---
It's fun, strong, and super cheap. The quest is the only required legendary (Shudderwock and Barista are optional), and it runs no epics at all.

---
Which adventures should I focus?
---
Sick play, Day[9]! Check out this sick move that Day[9] made with his sick play the other day!
---
This appears to have been cleared up in other comments, but it seems that you skipped the beginner ranks by starting an account a few years ago then returning to the same account. The new player experience has changed a lot since then. You can now get a lot of free packs while climbing ranks featuring mostly new players with similar collections. If you know what you're doing resource-wise, you can have a competitive deck by the time you leave those ranks.
---
But even if that wasn't your situation, it always helps to do a little research before you rule out something entirely. If you were having a miserable experience, assume that something isn't right and try to find out what it is before complaining.

I usually play casual when I don't think I have enough time to finish a game. That way I can concede without worry

Mage with Spectral Cutlass and Shadow in hand? I'm guessing stolen steel got cast somehow and, I'm guessing shadow got copied by either Thistle Tea or Elementary Reaction or something?
---
I agree. However Zayle was far from a free card so should still be refundable, especially considering how disappointing it was. I have no faith in Blizzard actually doing this though, they already have people's money. Certainly won't get any more towards adventures from me without it though.

To be fair no solo adventure was every behind a pay wall...

Don't forget Elysiana. I swear all warriors I faced got 2 Clockwerk Goblins from her lol.
---
Didn’t someone just make a post recently about how there hasn’t been Darkmoon Faire content in HS?
---
Well, that is one way to nerf Warrior indirectly. The Taunt package just became worse and both Omega Assembly and Boom got way less consistent as you won't be getting good mechs as reliably. Stonehill will also be cut from Odd Paladin lists, but some lists did not play him anyway so no major impact there.

People are forgetting how sloooooowww and tedious the old adventures were. In card game that naturally has slower gameplay, Dungeon Runs actually facilitate that a little bit and keep the excitement going.
---
I absolutely agree, big nerf to Warrior again. I'm still gonna keep playing my favourite class but it seems a bit weird to do it in this order, seems like Boom could've been 8 easily with this change.
---
Hahahaha thats nice.
---
What was the class you only needed 5 wins to reach golden? I will help you reach it golden with style!
---
Also, are you from EU?
---
How outraged can you possibly be? It's just a stranger on the internet stating a fact. I don't see him whining for dust.
---
It was used heavily in Odd Paly which is a T2 deck in wild.
---
Getting Tarim was just busted. Will probably be cut now
---
I mean, neutral spells would be kinda cool.
---
*CLANG*
---
Don't forget Elysiana. Clockwerk Goblins, Dragon Roars, Darius Crowleys were so common in Elysiana discovers and they were good for the warrior. Now they will get offered so many trash.
---
Furthermore, if I really went back, I am sure I can find a ton of instances where they answer this, and then months/years go by without releasing anything regarding that question.

Do you know if cards like \[\[Stitched Tracker\]\] used to have a higher chance to discover class cards?

3/2/2 | Battlecry: Discover a copy of a minion in your deck.  
---
I really like the discover nerf, but this reallllllyy needs to have a refund for these cards since it really is a straight up nerf for Flunky, Stonehill, etc.
---
Just keep restarting until you get Robes Of Gaudiness then, and just pick big minions; Windrunner, Rag, Y'sharaj, etc. You'll win easy.
---
I just became really sad when I realized I can't discover nearly as many Emeriss in Wild as Hunter....
---
Well, the average value is only higher because of the occasional legendaries and Nobody dusts all new legendaries (they are the Main reason you bought that many Packs anyhow); unless you already have every single Card, but then why should you even Care buying Packs anymore.
---
Wow dude this guy’s replies are so pedantic
---
I can’t believe they haven’t added wild packs to the store that you can purchase with gold. I’d love to use my gold to open packs of Whispers of the Old Gods again.
---
Not usually one to complain about changes but the discover change is a gigantic nerf to discover cards
---
Huh, it's felt like a fair bit longer.
---
Nice buff to Zarog's Crown actually
---
If they do that, at this point they are just reprinting old expansion.
---
Diablo 3 changed pretty significantly from vanilla to RoS to today.
---
There are multiple budget decks (at any given time) that are capable of reaching Legend, which cost under 2,000 dust. You’re not losing because “my opponents have legendaries”.
---
Yes curious to put Baku in an empty deck and click autocomplete to see how smart it is
---
They're charging literally the same amount they always have for packs, plus they added a tier above their standard. How exactly have they "upped the nickle and diming" recently?
---
What does enjoyment have to do with refunds?  The majority of people were happy with nerfs to Boom and Luna but we got refunds there.
---
&gt;we get no refund when a change doesnt directly change a cards stats, mana cost, or text, and its been like that forever.
