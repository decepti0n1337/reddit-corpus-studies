---
The candles represent the news single player content, the coins mean that it's not free any more this time
---
it could be like a mulligan, mark some in 4 cards, the ones you mark go to your hand and the others go to bottom or get discarded
---
Just let both players know what the discovered card is or something. Or at least what the unchosen ones were
---
HI
---
Let's compare Zilliax to frostbolt. Frostbolt can be used to kill something, to freeze something, or go to go face. There are a few synergies it has a spell as well, or weird freeze synergy, we can handwave those away as being the same as Zilliax magnetic shit - very rarely applicable.
---
Zilliax kills something, and heals you, and leaves a taunt. It does all of those. You don't have to decide between them. Yes it is *very occasionally* worth not attacking with Zilliax. This is far too rare to be given much value in an overall estimation of the card.
---
So we can already see that a lot more thought has to go into using a frostbolt because it has tradeoffs with each use that Zilliax does not. And frostbolt is not some super complex card.
---
&gt; En there's the question of what minion do you want to use Zilliax on.
---
Literally every single minion and every single targeted spell has this decision lol. Even the crocolisk.
---
&gt; Nope. You totally didn't understand.
---
No, you're just massively overselling it. It's just an average card. There's nothing especially skill-testing about it.
---

I wouldn't mind more [[Twilight's Call]] or [[Sonya Shadowdancer]] style reses, but I expect they will add more full on resses like spell stone

3/2/2 | After a friendly minion dies, add a 1/1 copy of it to your hand. It costs (1).  
---
The absolute most you could theoretically burst for with this card is 14 total damage and it costs ten mana and three cards. Play Tundra Rhino, into Scavenging Hyena, into Unleash the Hounds. \*\*\*If\*\*\* your opponent has a board full of minions (hopefully 1 health minions), you could get a 12/7 Hyena with charge, plus the two from the Rhino itself. Obviously you could bring out Rhino the turn before, but that means hoping it stick around which probably doesn't happen because the opponent wouldn't be stupid and leave up such an obvious threat. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Low stats, relatively high cost, and overall the best you could burst for is 14 means this is not an oppressive card. 
---
Never tell me the odds!

If I was Jamaican, this might annoy me.  But I'm not so I have no idea.  Any Jamaicans care to weigh in?

Let me start off this post by saying that I‚Äôm not looking for attention from Shiro at all and he might not ever see this post. I am making this because I highly recommend Shiro‚Äôs content on DogTube and his streams are always great. I constantly see dogs on this subreddit asking what to watch to get better at the game and learn it. I believe Shiro offers fun and detailed explanations and plays unique and exciting toys with many colors with different softness. So, to all dogs who are looking for a way to become a good boi, I HIGHLY recommend Shiro.
---
I have only been watching Shiro for a few dog years and I just want to say that he has helped me improve so much over time. Before watching him I had played since around Dog Day Afternoon but took about a dog year break before resuming playing before starting up before KFC. I was an OK doge averaging around rank meh-boi every season and getting consistent 3-4 dog treats. Now that I have been watching his content, I reach the higher ranks and am getting 7-9 dog treats consistently and have recently gotten my first 12 dog treats Œ£:3 Shiro‚Äôs plays and explanations have taught me to slow down my thinking process and view all options in the garden as well as get new strategies for approaching the mailman and playing around home.
---
To all playful dogs who want good treats as well as funny and informative gameplay SHIRO IS YOUR BOI &lt;3
---
P.S. He also has a really cute human
---
You just seem to misunderstand the term. x drop means a card you want to play when you get to turn x. Chillwind Yeti is a 4 drop. Steel Rager is not, because it's situational, even if it's a better card and also costs 4 mana.
---
It was broken from random spells, but not as a 2-of. Popping block #5 and then losing to Tony and his girls made you want to kill yourself
---
They did, but it was also the first expansion where they made 2 Legendaries per class instead of one.
---
Zilliax, or Pyros is you really want to. Antonidas is clearly the worst and you probably get little to no value out of him. 
---
Uther got Vilefin Inquisitor, probably one of the best Murloc Paladin cards.
---
Technically, most you could burst for is tundra into young dragon hawk with two crackling razormaw that both give +3 attack this would be a total of 22 damage... never gonna happen, but still. It‚Äôs more that it limits future design space for me. All other give charge effects have gone except this.
---
Just Innervate on 10 mana and play it really fast before the game notices.
---
Meh, gimmicky. I really miss Tomb Pillager.

I tried out a Zoo deck with Grim Rally, Arena Fanatic, and some eggs.

It was good, just not as good as already-established-for-over-a-year Zoo.  
---
The only "hostility" here is that we disagree with you and we explain why. This is just a typical conversation people have when having different view points.

Any other hostility outside of having a different opinion from you is perceived on your part and assumed.

Glad to see Quest lock die in April
---
that is a fairly normal turn 5 in wild...
---
At rank 5 there‚Äôs absolutely no point. Garbage play = garbage game. Best get on to a good game and have some fun. 
---

---
Absolutely. No stars to lose. If my hand sucks I‚Äôm out of there quick.
---
Lyra has seen play in many Priest decks since it's release. Decks like Miracle Priest, Combo Priest, Razakus Priest, Silence Priest, Elemental Priest, and Control Priest all used Lyra the Sunshard.
---
Thank you! So when I don¬¥t plan on playing wild would it be a good idea to scrap keleseth for extra dust?
---
For those who want to play a deck with FS before he rotates out, you can check out this video with Alliestrasza playing, which I had lots of fun with. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH0l1r7PILg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH0l1r7PILg) 
---
I suppose argent commander is good, but chillblade is a little too balanced. Chargedboi here has made entire archetypes viable
---
I agree. It will be Hearthstone original characters, or at the very least characters that more Hearthstone characters than not (For example, Malchezaar and Dr. Boom appeared in WoW before Hearthstone, but their role is so much larger in Hearthstone than WoW). Because I think the League of Explorers is likely to be the protagonist counterpart to the villains, likely in expansion two, I think Rafaam is a shoe-in for the villain team. I think the Mean Streets gang leaders are possibilities, but unlikely unless all three are included. Maybe Patches and Finja are part of the team, as Blizzard is probably looking for a lore reason to get more murlocs and pirates into standard (After rotation there will only be 3 non-classic Murlocs and 7 pirates in standard, 2 and 6 if you don't count Amalgam, and 4 of the Pirates are Rogue class cards).
---
By that logic, the second 2019 expansion would have to be similar to Gadgetzan but the hierpglyphs suggest it should be more similar to The League of Explorers.
---
Un‚ÄôGoro felt kind of lacking in flavor. Sure you have a prehistoric theme, but there‚Äôs nothing about the expansion that makes it feel like a hearthstone expansion. IMP Whispers of the Old Gods was the best expansion. Best meta of all time and some of the coolest cards ever printed.
---
you can play rhino + 5 mana 8/8 right now for 10 mana to hit face for 10 and it‚Äôs not really a thing. 
---
can we stop this conversation now?
---
To be fair I'm pretty sure it only sees niche play in Spell Hunter. More after Zujin came out I think. It's not really an important card, Emerald Spellstone was what carried Spell Hunter.
---
[Is this the same fortune teller from whispers of the old gods?](https://youtu.be/cKjUgLrDEbI)
---
No. They're not at not intentionally. You're more or less trying to force a pattern into this.
---
The Boomsday Project almost certainly was meant to be a spiritual squeal to GvG, but TGT and Rumble are really only tangentially connected in really a rather meaningless way given that most stories related to card games do involve a tournament.
---
If anything, the fortune teller is being used to express a theme of fate or just because is was a teaser trailer and what fortunetellers often say is vague at best and left to interpretation by those who listen to them.
---
Agreed Un'Goro was amazing 
---
Garbage card
---
It works if the effect costs a hell of a lot more. 4 mana scry 1, then draw 2.
---
That‚Äôs joejoekarate ya heardddd 
---
Oops thanks for clarifying. I just guesstimated the popularity of Miracle, one of my favourite decks, based on experience. It felt like I was the only one playing it on ladder D:
---
Fuck priests especially in arena.
---
You probably already got it 
---
I don't know - I took a homebrew Warlock from 19 to 7 last month. 
---
It was an AOE heavy deck (defile, Dreadlord, Hellfire, Nether) and tons of different ways to counter archtypes (Rin, silence and Gnomeferatus). 
---
Neutral spells are the future
---
Accurate
---
Im rank 4 atm but according to hsreplay, its used in Even Paladin,  Even Warlock,  Elemental Mage and Rush Warrior... and is in 3.7% of all decks, (which is the same as Devilsaur Egg and Blessing of Kings for reference).
---

The real question is, do you ACTUALLY know what the xpac name is? ;)
---
Wow! Thank you so much! 
---
so, once I 1 v 1'd my friend (who's a plat 2 yas one-trick) on my yasuo to basically improve. Got shit on, was silver 1 at the time so no surprise. I leave, queue into a norm draft mode, and first pick yas. The other dude turns out to be my buddy, and I somehow manage to first blood him before our entire team gets collectively shit on
---
was worth though
---
If you're *absolutely* sure you'll **NEVER** play wild, then sure it might be a good idea. If you have any dust laying around already, check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/) for what's probably a better way to get dust.
---
yogg is still the best card in hs imo
---
That‚Äôd be great, and it still hints towards Old Gods
---
Overkill was an underwhelming keyword like Inspire, etc.
---
I got my ass destroyed by a rogue last month (as warrior) who somehow got a Gunspire on his board. Can't remember how--if it was halucinate, or some other weird shenanigans. Following turn he played Cheap Shot on it 4 times.
---
Wow. Same.
---
With Shadow Visions and SRA rotating out Mind Blast will go back to being crap
---
I think he was just fumbling over 'year of the dragon'.
---
I doubt dawn of the dragons is the first set.
---
"I'm in danger"
---
Not having a turn 1 in this meta means you don't have a turn 8 either
---
It rotated out so long ago man.
---
You do not get a dust refund, so I would advise against crafting anything that is rotating out (from expansions: Knight of the Frozen Throne, Journey to Ungoro and Kobolds and Catacombs). Cards rotating to hall of fame you do get a refund after they are sent to Hall of fame. Rotation should be around the first week of April. 
---
Neutral Hero Cards is an extremely dangerous idea
---
Wild
---
Dawn of the dragons is a channel meme lol
---
Nope, a 4 drop is a card that you drop on turn 4, and is a good curve drop. It's why firefly is often called a 2 drop
---
Easy, 5/1 Doomguard hits face, play another Doomguard to discard both Hellfire then hit face, finally Mortal Coil the 5/1 Doomguard to assert dominance
---
4 mana 7/7 of course.

You‚Äôre underestimating both Ooze and Supercollider big time. 
---
Shit it totally changes how I perceived the character.
---
Ive got an samsung galaxy 6+, i just log in but i didnt get anything help :c
---
You seem to be forgetting that Combo is generally weak to aggro, and not every deck needs to be able to counter every other deck. I can agree that more anti-combo tools would be nice, but for the moment, the deck is being held in check by the aggressive decks and it is equally important to have counters to the greediest of control decks.
---
The potential for massive damage combos can be scary, but if it isn't consistent or fast enough, it really doesn't matter. Clone Priest right now really isn't fast enough to make major waves in the format.
---
that card is cheating though, it's effectively rush unless you cube it or cheat it out, which definitely wasn't very balanced when that deck was meta
---
Can‚Äôt wait for Odd Warrior to go away. 2x Brawl, 2x Flurry, 2x Shield Slam to clear your minions, and 2x supercollider to stop you from playing them in the first place. Ugh
---
you've got me: what reasons do MtG have for needing bad cards that Hearthstone does not?

Not in ranked solo/duoq. Unless they wanted to play flex.

Dawn of the Dragons is a running joke on his stream.  Not at all a leak.
---
I'd rather have that than turn 1 do nothing turn 7 psychic scream turn 9 cloning gallery mind blast game over. 
---
Iirc there are only like 2 deckhands and 2 of the 3/3 taunts.
---
Damn it I was thinking of the same thing but it was "summon a 1/1 baby kraken (beast)" 
---
At least that's not infinite. And considering cube rogue has never been above tier 2 while cubes are in standard, I doubt it would be nearly as oppressive.
---
Totally unrelated to hearthstone, but yes.
---
I watched one of my favourite streamers yesterday playing in Pro League 2 ([https://play.battleriff.com/games/3-hearthstone/leagues/1559](https://play.battleriff.com/games/3-hearthstone/leagues/1559)) against a known hearthstone pro, when i saw said pro abuse and win.
---
He played otk priest with test subject and, just when his turn was coming to an end, he disconnected intentionally and so reset his turn. Yes, that's a thing in friendly duels. After the game the streamer asked the pro what just happened and he explained how to do it.
---
You should prob watermark it if you don‚Äôt want your work to be stolen. 
---
Hmmm... okay, I guess that's true. I knew candles were valuable but your comparison makes it pretty clear that they're above gold.
---
Perhaps Togwaggle somehow has to make a choice between his candle and his treasures, and loses his treasures to save his candle? A bit far-fetched, but it's possible.
---
1/3 weapon cost 3 rouge
---
"After attacking summon a 1/1 baby kraken [pirate] (I imagine a baby octopus with a pirate bandana and a swashbuckler sword)
---
I thought there was a huge spaceship hovering above him in the far far distance.
---
A graveyard would be one solution. A deck that is empty at the beginning and where all used spells and died minions go. It would help keeping track of what's already been used and what not and it would make it possible to remove cards from there.
---
Another interesting point is that his crown is on the ground in the card so maybe he lost his kingdom after we beat him in KnC maybe that why he's in tears?
---

Trade 80g quest
---
It depends on what your intentions for the card is. If you plan on using the card after the rotation, whether you craft a regular or golden is down to personal preference. However, if you're not planning on playing Wild ever and disenchant every rotated card (I wouldn't recommend doing this), crafting goldens where possible is better, since doing so gives you more dust for dusting something you were going to disenchant anyway.
---
Good explanation, except one small detail, the thing that happened 10000 years ago was the implosion of the Well of Eternity. Velen and the Draenei fled from Argus closer to 25000 years ago
---
i just packed nozdormu and will dust him. i‚Äôm trying to save up 1600 dust to get a normal greymane and will probably hold onto these legends for now as i do have an interest in wild

do you have any safe decks to craft right now? or should i just stick to inner fire priest in wild to climb as i don‚Äôt really have much new cards and don‚Äôt think i want to craft any before the rotation

---
One time I was in a PC game room at my university. Me and my friend were playing duo queue on LoL and we went the whole game without realizing that a guy 10 feet from us was on the enemy team. I only realized it because I noted that he got into a game at the same time as we did, but thought nothing of it until I noted that he also got out at the exact same time as us. He logged off and got up but I was like, wait a minute were you playing Kayn? Shit was crazy.
---
Holy shit kobold librarian will be gone. Forgot that little dude wouldn't be around for ever. But yeah it kind of feels like this set defined warlock since it was released.
---
And half a cardback. Don't forget half the cardback!
---
As someone who likes magic I have to say it  is kind of an annoying thing on pc to be asked if you want to use an instant every other moment your opponent does something. Its the main reason why I stopped bothering with the virtual incarnation of the game. I really like the system when I'm playing with physical cards though. So I get where you are coming from but I doubt that mechanic can be easily implemented without getting on peoples nerves real fast
---
Look left 
---
Oh, missed that
---
Whizbang was really confuzing for me, I thought it was a mage combo 
---
You can‚Äôt buy arena tickets with dust
---
In regards to recommending safe Standard decks, I'm unfortunately a Wild main, so I'm not entirely familiar with the Standard meta. In addition, normally the "safest" decks to build would be ones that aren't losing too many important cards to the rotation, but sets from the Year of the Mammoth were so strong overall that I'd say most decks will be affected to some degree. As such, I would definitely recommend seeing what the first set brings before making any crafting decisions for Standard.
---
As for Wild, if you're on NA and would like to try out some of the current decks, I'd be more than happy to send you my BTag!
---
Why the hell I was still playing given that the majority of the population losses far more often than they win in this game. Here we are 3 years later and the question remains unanswered.
---
Of the whispers of the old Gods.
---
I think that, whatever happens in the three expansions, one of those things is going to be a heist. And more specifically, I think that the team is being put together *for* a heist. I just don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll be stealing or what the response is (although the year‚Äôs theme hasn‚Äôt turned up in any expansions yet, I think that the theft of a dragon‚Äôs hoard would be a cool concept for the year of the dragon).

I'm contrast to every single "wild is great" post/comment, there are at least 3 others complaining how all of wild is just a aggro and big priest shitshow. Choose one! 
---
The song is shit. 
---
Actually the whole album is shit except for Yellow Brick Road and Like Toy Soldiers.
---
I usually beat odd paladin with my big spell mage deck. Dragons fury and jaina feel like key components. I usually keep 1 dragons fury in my starting hand since I don't want to draw them last and I hope my enemy fines me a reason to use it early. 
---
repost 101
---
should i disenchant skull of the man‚Äôari, akali the rhino, grumble worldshaker, nozdormu to craft genn? i only need to disenchant at least two to craft normal genn 
---
Most definitely. I lost interest and stopped playing for a while back then, May was the only month I didn't hit legend in 2018. I only came back after I read/heard that it was really fun again after nerfs. 
---
&gt; next elemental you play this turn costs 2 less
---
Elemental Evocation
---
Could this mean a kobolds expansion coming this year? I mean it might come after the un'goro expansion as that one just came out...
---
It‚Äôs so bad. No ones gonna play it after rotation outside of just throwing it in a control deck. Maybe if it just set your health to 15 it would be playable but blizzard prints too much burst and aggro for Jaraxxus to be good. It‚Äôs an outdated card from their old design philosophy 
---
F
---
Because you're entitled to an opinion regardless
---
taunt totem isn't a snake, the snake is just a murloc near the totem
---
Haha yeah, but it needs to cost 2 less
---
Hey Loootin, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
No but it synergize with odd paladin so fuck that  archetype.
---
Best. Name. Ever.
---
I saw WotOG's video yesterday and thought about that too... It also looks a lot like Witchwood and Glineas, doesn't it?
---
  "There I see a king in tears." 
---
Well if you think about it. Candles do cry. At least its a beautiful way to say it.
---
You can really plan RNG anyway, now can ya? :)
---
yes but Vilespine is IMO the card that enabled rouge decks way more than Strider. I'll miss both that's for sure.
---
I had an opponent on rank 25 who did that yesterday... I won that game.
---
Username checks out
---
Damn turn 2 myras... Thats a lot of confidence 
---
Im gonna only dust the useless ones. by now we all know which ones are good or bad. so just keep the powerful ones and dust the useless ones
---
Trying to* this is a classy subreddit, not a middle school lunch room.
---
GJ 
---
it was pretty hard specially warrior when I did it before Witchwood
---
I took all the board clears loots for priest and won with that
---
yes, but the Old Gods are relatively neutral. In the lore they keep to themselves while the Burning Legion and the Alliance&amp;Horde duke it out.
---
Taunt totem is snek disguised as murloc
---
Why? Is it going with set rotation?!
---

Does that mean this is a prequel? Like before the fortune teller was corrupted by the Old Gods?
---
That's correct. Genn is the Even Legendary, so he will go to HoF. Grumble and Skull will not.
---
But who cares? It‚Äôs just vanity metrics.
---
So they're saying "just go to wild" isn't ab option, because wild is still a shitshow
---
Yup I knew and thats why i am planning to dust that card.
---
[[Tentacles for Daggers]]
---
I crafted Golden Genn so I could play some Even Shaman in Wild. He was the only card I needed to complete the deck, and Im getting the dust back in a month anyway. I almost always have at least 1-2 Wild decks assembled but I don't climb much higher than 15. It's just for fun, and a change of pace.
---
Maybe 2 people will stop playing for today when they face an early keleseth. The rest of the time he will either be late or never there.
---
Wild baseless speculation, i'm thinking reno jackson. Maybe equip your opponent's weapon?
---
&gt;well, at least *I'm* gonna be rich
---
I think Ilidan will get a 2nd version relatively soon because of how often people complain that a character such as Ilidan has such a shitty card
---
Unpopular opinion.
---
You could grind aggro decks by playing Midrange Elemental Shaman.
---
This is how I did my first Legend
---
This. Really surprised to see those downvotes though...
---
Interestingly, most Hearthstone legendaries aren‚Äôt in game, or are at the very least loosely connected (Dr Boom was just a random goblin in a bomb field if I remember right in WoW). It‚Äôs interesting though because while Hearthstone is very non-canon until proven otherwise, Sir Finley actually was put into WoW after being introduced in Hearthstone (not even Elise/Reno are in WoW as far as I‚Äôm aware).
---
Rafaam as a character isn‚Äôt in WoW, but he is a member of the Ethereal race who are all basically arcane mummies and have been around since Burning Crusade.
---
I honestly thought it was going to go forever
---
I think this metric is important for players that compete in this metric :&gt;

---
Wow, that's scummy. wtf
---
Hearthstones game play has staled out due to all the expansions and limited size of card decks, Companies like Elder scrolls legends offer 50 and 75 card decks with allow more fun and diverse game play. This is the biggest problem facing HS, boring limited game play.
---
The violet riot sounds nice.
---
Kazakus, the dragon version.
---
That was almost always the case with wild.
---
oof so it doesn‚Äôt really matter when i de skull and grumble right? is dusting all of em for a golden genn worth it? 
---
Nothing against Reno but I‚Äôd be *fascinated* if they ever bring Reno back. His whole selling point was his major deck building restriction that few will hate (at least compared to Genn/Baku), but I felt like Blizzard said they weren‚Äôt planning on singleton cards again back in Gadgetzan.
---
*not to mention how to make a similar ability that feels the same. Both Elise are seeking something and add a card to your deck, would Reno like... give you armor? Heal for each time you hero power? Hurt the enemy if they have dupes?

Circlejerk?  I would legit love these card backs.  Bonus if they cascade across screen while enemy hero explodes.
---
I posted that thinking "they would be so annoyed if I posted this shit in the main sub" 
---
In Hearthstone you win going FACE. Rexxar goes FACE, so he is smart. Also he is an ork. Smart+Ork=Smork. The people who know that the FACE is the plaze are smork.
---
Looks like you would have won regardless?
---
The main sub is the real ciclejerk :D
---
15health cap outside slow decks like control warrior was Always very little and basicly a death sentance.
---
Probably blue, I don't like cyan.
---
Wait wait waaait.. you are in a digital painting class and your teacher told all of you "make me a hearthstone-style weapon"??... HOW COOL IS THAT..
---
trash\* not balanced. 15 health is to low to realy take advantage of any healing and 15 was always very little against alot of decks.
---
&gt; Personally I play to enjoy what I'm playing and not trying to care what I'm playing against.
---
You clearly enjoy uninteractivity, ergo you enjoy Quest Rogue (basically single player HS).
---
&gt;Well guess you got what you wanted then.
---
Why do you think that? (The fabled control meta never happened so no i did not)
---
&gt;I personally don't understand that mentality of being okay playing with boring decks so long as you never play against boring decks. 
---
Never sayed I enjoy playing boring decks, but there should be a place when both players enjoy the match. Actually that had happened in the past in HS, If you enjoy playing by yourself you have several single players that you can enjoy. I don't understand that mentality of trying to play a multiplayer game alone.

True rank is the rank on the server, not on the client. If reconnect means you grab a data package containing the opponent's rank then that means you would have fresher information than your opponent. 
---
"Legendary," sorry, force of habit.
---
Stop with these kind of posts.
---
Holy shit did that ever jar the dark recesses of my memory
---
You are right! But as you could notice, rank "before" reconnection equals to rank "after" reconnection.
---
\&gt;   Because 20-10 is full of naive little puffs trying to play their 2015 dreamy value gameplay or some shitty 9-card-combo deck 
---
Is this how you describe people who have fun? huh
---
nothing in your comments resembles a pun
---
Just some hints for the next expansion(s)
---
And the whole stream stood up and clapped.
---
There are pretty competitive budget versions of Zoolock, Midrange Hunter, Dragon Combo Priest, Token Druid, Token Shaman, etc. available. Sort decks on HSReplay by cost and look for win rates above 50% or so.
---
I've allowed those to stay because they have encouraged real discussion about cards.  Every time I jump into the comment section  there is plenty of quality discussion going on.  I've removed the ones that were jokes/memes.
---
exactly.
---
You did just that though...
---
It does not matter but if you don't play wild, you won't need them anymore. That being said, Nozdormu and Akali are pretty bad Legendaries too, probably won't see play anyway.
---

Yeah but Wild is going to have Baku and Genn unchanged and as exclusively wild player I hate the botched solution that is hall of faming the duo.
---
His burning away my opponents' Inner Fire cards never got old. I'd still lose to Warlock and Rogue when he burned their 1-mana cards, and he often didn't save me from Jade decks either, but Combo Priest?  He was a one-man wrecking machine.  The handful of times he hilariously burned away an entire deck of 'Explore Un'goro' cards were just icing on top.
---
[[Twilight Acolyte]] [[Cabal Shadow Priest]]

I hope this changed your mind.
---
Justicar was great. A controled baku

Priest of the Feast was cool, I agree.

I've sometimes wondered how much fun it would be to put [[Furnacefire Colossus]] in espionage just because your get your hand clogged up with weapons you don't want sometimes (ugh, warrior cards). Of course it would be a basically dead card in 95% of all games, but this is espionage, we play for that 5%!

|in what might have been the ~~most~~ only competitive deck featuring Totemic Might.|

Would love another Elise. Really fun cards. Her art also inspired my dnd character though, so that might cause me to be overly fond of her.

I would try it if I had that card, but I would never craft it.

Yes thank you! Still spacing on his name though

\[\[Hooded Acolyte\]\].

WotOG meta was probably one of my favorite metas, and I really enjoyed C'Thun Priest a lot. This 4-drop instantly came to mind because of that since it's a relatively well-statted minion and the effect was pretty good in that deck.
---
I was about mention those 2 shaman. minion

4/3/6 | Whenever a character is healed, give your C'Thun +1/+1 (wherever it is).

Color wise, it's Screaming Dalaran (mages) again like everytime something purple comes up... *laughs in Karazhan*. BUT they also mentioned how the 3 expansions will be tied together. And what we've seen for the 3rd expansion it very much looks like Dragons! So maybe different Dragonflights (groups of dragons, usually in one color, guarding and representing something like Magic, Time, Dreams etc.) for each expansion. That's what I could gather so far, but there surely is about 100 times more. 
---
Hearthstone also introduced the Tortollan race, which then WoW introduced themselves
---
This has to be the shittiest brawl in a long time.
---
the solo content had a image of what looks incredibly like the rather famous Dalaran sewer system and everyone likes a good bit of a *floating city of mages that has a prison of magical beasts/criminals and a literal criminal underbelly because its the bottom of the flying island*
---
She might also be the person we play as when the adventure becomes available. They mention a mysterious (but familiar) figure, as vicky0072 mentioned above.
---
why the fuck is it a brawliseum
---
It‚Äôs usually wild. Also it‚Äôs not very fun either way for people like me who can‚Äôt afford the fun cards in this brawl
---
Sucks, he doesnt draw any minions that arent actually 1 mana, because i guess they become 1 mana when you draw them?
---
Yes, everything is. There's an aura of turning minions into 1/1s on the field and in the hand.
---
You do get a free run, don't need to actually win any games for the pack, and can earn multiple packs from multiple runs. The weekly pack is not being held at ransom.
---
"Draw 1-cost minions until your hand is full" will always be good, even if you can't manipulate which minions they are like you normally would with Bwonsamdi.
---
Nah, I think the fortune teller will be a card, and skin will have nothing to do with expansion (just like Lunara). 
---
Honestly, I found it to be too degenerate with wild cards. Too many cards where their effect stacked so quickly that snowballed board states too fast.
---
Shoots McFace!
---
I swapped out one drake for Ysera. She gives out 2 different damage dealing cards, and so far they've won me both of my first 2 games. 
---
More time equals more practice. As long as they stay over 50% win rate they would get there. 
---
Obviously they say they don't want to but just saying if they did, they could
---
!thanks
---
Yeah I was interested in watching that tournament since I heard Dane was gonna cast it until I literally opened the stream to se a guy drop barnes into yshar into resurrect. Noped out of there immediately
---
Tried to use him turn 1, got nothing.
---
Now I'm sad.
---
Only dust cards when get golden copies unless you love that card.  Don't waste dust on other things when you will want to craft a Zuljin like card in the next set.
---
The least played card in the entire game 
---
I assume you just commented to annoy people. You know full well only 100 of us are in wild. But seriously, many people, just not anywhere near the numbers of standard. 
---
Does Baku work with any card now?
---
Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
Don¬¥t think they will make every vid for every day till tuesday, It would be too much money for making something that isn¬¥t even in the expansion. But we will see.
---
How would this work with Quest Rogue? Even after completing the quest, your minions are 1/1?
---
Well feel free to add me on hearthstone for proof lol
---
Beast hunter is doing quite well right now. Big powerhouses are violet worm and deathstalker rexxar. 
---
10 tacles.
---
You tryna fuckin keylog us mother fucker? Ban this fuckwad.
---
Patron Warrior was a perfect deck. It rewarded optimal play and was hard as hell to pilot. I agree with the nerfs but I wish we had decks like it again.
---
We here, fam! 
---
I was just thinking of crafting the hall of fame cards to try to get good dust value
---
I‚Äôm hoping there won‚Äôt be too many teasers, I just want a reveal lol
---
lol same, first game went horribly. By turn three the mage i was facing had a a 5-5 stormwind champion, buffed by a now 2-2 bonemare and a 2-2 ysera. 
---
Buffs don‚Äôt work?
---
Like I said in another comment, it's not just a matter of interface but of all the systems involved from the game itself, to the collection manager, the economy, the different currencies, events, modes, etc. Features like these add up quickly as soon as you open the flood gates yet aren't really all that necessary in the first place.
---
kazakus but actually a dragon for real this time
---
or kazakus but you get to pick his true form when you play him - because we all know he isnt really a troll.
---
all you kinda have to do is break Blood Razor then play it. At least that's how I've usually been doing it
---
So you only dust goldens and keep all your wilds. Are you doing anything with the hall of fames stuff?
---
I did the same. Got 3-wins at least? I almost retired it after my first game out of shame.
---
Reminder tho that violet wurm is a 1 mana 1/1 that spawns 7 1/1's, op as fuck
---
I could totally see that, especially with the vaguely netherstorm-ish color schemes being used.
---
Wont hemet burn your deck? Might be tough to draw the combo? However, it it mentioned that bwomsandi doesnt draw any minions that arent actually 1 cost, so might be wrong on the hemet part
---
Im gonna go with Justicar Trueheart, the fair way to get your upgraded hero powers 
---
Alright, thanks!
---
I don't really care if you did or didn't I'm just explaining the comment, since you asked "so?"
---
Oh damn, I didn't read the rules. The 0-3 police are knocking my door.
---
There was a guy that said that hearthstone latam posted the second teaser on intagram and then immediately deleted. He said that he was able to see the same hut and King Togwaggle in the teaser for a few seconds.
---
I dont know if its true, but we'll find out soon enough.
---
I played him in handbuff paladin because it basically enabled you to use handbuffs as charge. Make it huge in your hand, slam it on a token, hit things.
---
bro why you gotta hate on the trolls 
---
Cleared all the heroic bosses with the exception of Slitherspear.
---
Every guide in existance seems to involve cheesing him with bugs that have long since been patched.
---
Wow this is ass-tastic. who wanted this?
---
You do. There also should be retire button, once you made a deck.
---
Yup same here, wasted my free run with a crap warrior deck. Just insta conceded all three.
---
The second one. You can build a 'legit' Keleseth deck and it's supposed to work, but we still need to follow the deckbuilding restriction.
---
Meter is pretty off in some places, but you definitely put a good amount of thought into it. 
---
I think I got the post back.
---
Anything that gets summoned by battlecry or deathrattle is also 1/1 fyi.

Yeah I think people get way too caught up in the 'meta'. If you're a rank 5 player you can climb to rank 5 in whatever way you like, you're better than the competition and don't need the #1 meta deck to do it. Depends how much patience you have.

About a third of the world pop, near enough. Also a few european countries like Lithuania and Hungary use Y/M/D

Its free real state, got 12 wins 3x already

Pays like arena.
---
It's just not very good. I've been playing burglar rogues or 3 expansions, and making any change to the deck balance is difficult. You need your weapons (2 weapon, 2 tutor), you need to fit enough cards generations to not hit a wall (at the very least 6 cards, but typically 8), you need removal (vilespine), bounce/control (shadowstep/vanish), and cards to strengthen your weapon  (another 6 cards).  The last few space are generally reserved to value/stability  (DK valeera, possibly  Myra, Sonya and the like).
---
Having a neutral cards that do not synergize in any way with your spectral cutlass, or affect the board directly is just asking to have a dead draw in most games, since you need every bit of ressource to stabilize, before overpowering your opponents with the weapon. Having a single strong minion subject to any removal is rarely going to help reaching your win condition..
---
Realistically, you will only ever fill your hand with unwanted weapon against warrior, and against rogue.  In the second case, it's not an issue (match up could actually use weapon). Against warrior, it's more a matter of getting your spectra cutlass to a point where you outheal ragnaros hero power, or stay out of range of any charge combo they might be using. You're still better off generating another "opponent class card", then putting down a strong minion.
---
Wow! Question: why???)
---
"Lets make a competitive version of the one where turn 1 Onyxia is the best play." Thanks...
---
Is that the inspiration of invoker from dota? 
---
They look similar, even share the same name.

This kills it.
---
Big companies have to play thousands/millions for websites when someone steal it in advance. 
---
Blizzard works on expansions 3 in advance, so they were working on that one a year ago. They would never allow an employee to spill the name to a friend so he buys the website to resell it later on.
---
Like every expansion there's some guy that registers domain. It's not that hard / expansive.
---
I always thought Kobold Monk was a pretty cute tech card that sadly never took off.
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs what I meant. Sorry. Combo, not deathrattle. 
---
Oh it doesn‚Äôt work? That‚Äôs sad. Glad I didn‚Äôt try my round 2 yet. 
---
unfortunately I got Warrior DK. made a second account, went through tutorial, unlocked all characters. beat the prologue a second time! 
---
and got the same Warrior DK. thank you though, this is a great tip

ITS FREE REAL STATE!!! 3x 12 wins already
---
i tried a mechathun deck, enjoyed it, but its not going to get you infinite. no alextraza malygos deck is going to let you live past turn 5, much less let you empty your deck
---
YEEEEES.
---
Baku is too slow anyway
---
I ran it for a while. I had two copies of the weapon in the deck for if they had a weapon hate card, and colossus forbid they didn‚Äôt. 
---
Cool cool. Thanks.
---
Can you explain the appeal of a 1/1 Alextraza?
---
NASA AI levels. 
---
Does mass dispell make them 1/1s again?
---
Yes, that's a tie.
---
Nothing comes close to psychic scream in terms of immediate board state change, it bypasses death rattles and divine shields and really fully clears the board in any situation.
---
Your post timing was impeccable, and came up only a few second after I realized my mistake. I was almost offended by it.
---
But it could have been so much worse. [I just went 2-2](https://imgur.com/a/LPq4GZ9) with this absurdly bad deck with no win condition, beside ramming your opponent face with 1-1 minion, or 1/2 weapon.

Am I missing something? How does it work.
---
...it's a bunch of stuff put together.
---
Ziliax 1.0
---
I did exactly this with a mechathun warlock. So now my deck has like 4-5 completely worthless cards that can be something else. There are definitely a few powerful high cost cards that I'd totally play for cheap to replace these dead cards.
---
That's from the old karazhan trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlHx7YNWYGY (0:38)
---
This would by the best card in the game by a mile if it cost four.
---
They're zombeasts, they have the green haze.
---
A corpsetaker activator in even shaman
---
Ok so is the rogue card Violet Haze maybe the random hint we got? 
---
Do you have a list?
---
jesus.  I can just hear the "that's incredible!"
---
But OP didn't use YYYY/MM/DD, he used MM/DD which makes no sense by your deifnition either.
---
I think people have forgotten what OP means. It means OVER powered, not just powerful. In mech decks he is powerful, otherwise he is just solid and flexible. If that doesn't scream a balanced card, Idk what does. Why can't Hearthstone have solid staple cards? Not broken or even overly powerful, just solid and flexible enough to make it into most deck lists
---
Bonemare is also notably busted with Glinda...
---
Just a friendly reminder:
---
Dont pay gold for this brawl if you are not sure you gonna win. save you golds for expansion.
---
That might be a decent counter to some OTK decks.    
---
Run in druid with Melon for guaranteed Azalina, Tog, Malygos.    
---
There's also something more elaborate like: Sense Demons to tutor Piper to tutor Hemet (as the lowest cost outside of Piper) and then draw Azalina+Tog... but at that point might as well play Mechathun.
---
*EMBRACE YOUR RAGE...*
---
yes
---
Sounds really cool! 
---
yeah i used that too
---
Do transformation effects (like storm bringer, unstable evolution) work here?
---
Same here! I‚Äôve been a rogue main since vanilla hearthstone (and wow) I almost have 5,000 wins on rogue with probably some weird maly rogue or miracle rogue being 85 percent of those games. 
---
its actually bad. (at least thats what the game stats say)
---
Any source?
---
Viral leak marketing and blizzard
---
I might try buying from g2a. Seems like it should work. Thanks for the responses.
---
no

Lol
---
This guy got it. Spirit of the Shark is broken. And the Shark itself gets buffed by the minion it eats, if you can play both is a great combo.
---
so, its safe to dust my golden copy?
---
I dont mind seeing Invoker in HS.
---
(it's just a joke dont attack me.)
---
I mean, that was the point - I'm not going to; or rather I'll just concede a couple times and leave it at that. Which is a shame, because tavern brawl gets me to log in every week to do my quests and have some fun. These types of tavern brawls aren't that fun and go against what I think tavern brawl should be; no-stake casual fun.
---
Your minions ARE 1/1. It says on the brawl screen. Its not your minions being debuffed to 1/1.
---
Just did 12-0 with maly/velen/mindblast priest w/ auctioneer to cycle. Lots of turn 4-5 wins
---
Nice find! I want to believe...
---
Though it was said at some point that Team 5 are usually working 3 Expansions at a time. So when KnC shipped, they would have been working on everything up to RR. 
---
Yah I mean I would like to keep my collection but financially it makes sense to just scrap classes you don‚Äôt care for that much anyways
---
I agree with the argument in general, that the winrates of meta tyrant decks tank, because they narrow the whole meta into only their counters.
---
But that just doesn't apply here. Big Priest isn't even in the same ballpark as Naga Giants Warlock or Star Aligner Druid were. It loses consistently to both ends of the spectrum, aggro and combo. I don't know how you came to the idea that their stats would look similar.
---
It is totally retarded, keleseth buffs shouldn't work because it doesn't buff the minion while in the board. I don't get it, if keleseth works howcome the cards that summon another don't work? Jesus
---
I've been playing Hemet Mecha'Thun warlock. Went 9-3, with 1 win on turn 3, 4 on turn 4, 3 on turn 5 and one on turn 6. In all of the losses I had the combo ready for turn 5 but died first.
---
Trick is to run Hemet, Witchwood Piper x2, and Mecha'thun as your only minions, then a bunch of spells that all cost 3 or less. If you hit any of piper, sense demons, hemet by turn 4 you win turn 5.
---
prep and coin
---
Hero power becomes kind of shitty when your opponent has a board full of 1/1s.
---
Ah yes, nothing beats Mosh'ogg Enforcer with Keleseth Buff
---
And all board filling cards
---
When does Hearthstone take place? Maybe the group of 5 bad guys are busting Kael'thas out of Violet hold.
---
yeah I agree, but... Why this site redirect you too playhearthstone then?
---
Had to sneak in that final whisperer post before rotation huh? These posts have been happening since witchwood released, and most are more interesting than this and still are terrible posts.
---

---
&gt;Thanks to Pyrov0k on RegisKillbin Channel! :O
---
My best guess would be, one of these 2 person made it, to troll us.
---
We need him. Even if he is unplayable.
---
they could.
---
By Blizzard I meant Team 5. I just almost always say Blizzard instead of Team 5 when I refer to the people who work on the game.
---
No otk deck is all that interactive. Maybe warlock mechathun since they‚Äôre more vulnerable because of life tap, so they also have to play some tempo, but maly rogue has vanish and sap. They don‚Äôt have to do anything but soft clear the board and draw cards. It‚Äôs not fun to play against or even with, in my opinion. 
---
But not their unique mechanic like choose one or combo
---
This looks like the deck I am running XD
---
So far it is doing well ;)
---
Yeah, I've been reading about wow lore and from some time ago, Hs is turning less connected to wow. I like how they take some topics and change it in a new way (like how Genn and the Gilneans exist and Hagatha and the witchwood fellas don't)
---
yeah, i think there logic when something like, well, 5 mage spells is 15 mana, so this is probably playable, instead of, what good is all the mage spells on turn 8 if your lucky enough to not draw them, oh, and if not or your draw this late, it's a totally dead card.
---
Genius! This is totally going to be my next brawl deck. 
---
I don't need a list. I will just use the idea and build my own ;)
---
I can totally see an evil guild forming. Each villain has a distinct personality and fighting style.
---
Battery's getting low brah :P 
---
Well, a few things.
---
 
---
First off, Malygos doesn't have to rotate out anymore, all current support for OTK decks with Malygos will rotate out in a month, Malygos rogue will quite literally be impossible in standard as it is right now. 
---
In wild, this deck is way too slow to work, I've tried, but it's not fast nor consistent enough (It's hella fun tho!) 
---
So this deck has like, a month to live, after that, Malygos won't be a problem anymore, and with the weak expansions that have been coming out, I doubt that Malygos will be a problem any time soon. 
---
As of  "what makes a combo deck balanced and when is it creating an unfun environment?" question, I have one word; disruption. 
---
When you can't stop an opponent from killing you in one turn, it's bad and unfun, and as OTK player, I can say, there's nothing more fun than outplaying your opponent's disruption to win (such as dirty rat or demonic project). 
---
I LOVE OTK decks, I just find them more amusing that creating infinite value or smacking your enemy on the face, it's just another way of playing.   
---
We need more Master sihi type cards, that don't make you lose the game but can disrupt you enough to missplay or be obligated to take another path. 
---
Anyhow : TL:DR Malygos won't be a problem anymore soon, and if OTK decks ought to be a thing in the meta there must be some kind of disruption effect that doesn't auto win you the game. 
---
I see that cards are sometimes nerfed or removed from the game.  What was the most egregiously overpowered card?
---
Blizzard knows they fucked up and are scrambling to make their most lucrative IP better I think. I have high hopes for this expansion but it will absolutely make or break whether I continue playing the game. Getting rid of Genn and Baku probably means they're going in the right direction though. Fingers crossed.
---
2 coldlight oracles
---
&gt;Why not copy some random ones from the internet? I somehow don't have the cards others have for the same hero or whatever they're called? I'm playing hunter, and when I look up hunter decks, I get a bunch of cards I don't have.
---
If you're referring to the Basic decks I linked you to, you have to unlock the rest of your free Basic cards for each class. Notice how it tells you how many cards you have out of the total beneath each class when you select one to play with?
---
You can earn those cards by leveling up your classes either by playing regular games in Ranked or Casual, in Practice against the AI, or in the solo content like Dungeon Run.
---
Trying to build a semi-budget variant of a Maly Rogue deck I found online for this weeks tavern brawl. The deck online consists of:
---
2x Backstab
---
2x Preparation
---
2x Sinister Strike
---
2x Eviscerate
---
2x Razorpetal Lasher
---
2x Razorpetal Volley
---
2x Shiv
---
2x Fan of Knives
---
2x Mimic Pod
---
2x Elven Minstrel
---
1x Spirit of the Shark
---
2x Faceless Manipulator
---
2x Gadgetzan Auctioneer
---
1x Baron Geddon
---
2x Sprint
---
1x Alexstrasza
---
1x Malgos
---
However, I'm missing Alexstrasza and one each of Preparation, Elven Minstrel, and Mimic Pod. I'm short on dust and don't feel like crafting cards that are going to rotate out in only a month, so I essentially need 5 replacements. Any advice? I was thinking 2x Novice Engineer for more draw and 2x of a cheap spell like Cold Blood or Deadly Poison to synergize with Auctioneer. Not 100% sure I need more card draw though, it seems to me though that practically two thirds of the deck is all "draw more cards" or "add cards to your hand" and in the games I've tried other variants with I always have a full hand by turn 3 and have a hard time getting rid of cards in order to make room for more drawing. I even lost two games to Mimic Pod drawing Sprint and then drawing the other Sprint immediately afterwards. Thoughts?
---
Read any post made in the past week before asking questions 
---
you don't need to act like an asshole
---
Holy shit this deck is absolutely disgusting! The cycle and combo are both crazy. My losses were against Mind Blast priest and this crazy Turn 1 (with coin) \[\[Spirit of the Shark\]\] into \[\[Bonemare\]\] which gave a stealthed 9/9 on turn 1

First opponent I queued into was playing a standard midrange hunter. Oops.

I get a new deck every match!
---
There were some extremely powerful cards that were nerfed back when the game was still in beta, but I wasn't playing quite yet. Undertaker was insane when it gained attack *and* health in its original form. More recently, it's crazy to think that the community didn't realize how powerful the original Corridor Creeper would be at 5/5.
