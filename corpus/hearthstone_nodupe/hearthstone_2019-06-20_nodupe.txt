I would start by playing ranked. From rank 50 -25 you'll earn packs every five ranks. It's a good way to learn to play and build your collection.

Music#21245 NA 80g quest
---
I think it would be easier if you see me as 2 persons:
---

---
* [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) : The Job is just to post decks hit high legend. They don't have any opinion, except maybe stats.
---
* neon31 : This is the person behind it, I have a lot of personal opinions.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Let's say neon31 is one of the wild players that hate Big Priest, that's fine, but [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) will still post it.
---
If neon31 says he trusts Alexander more than others that's fine, but [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) will still posts decks that runs Shark. 
---
If I remember correct stats had shown that Mossy Horror was good in Heal Zoo Warlock. A lot good players didn't agree with it. This proofs that just cause you run a card or not doesn't mean they have to be correct.
---
Wisp in Rogue is also a good example. Players had different opinions, but stats would shown who is correct (I don't know who was correct).
---
I think it's very hard to say who is correct, Alexander and vS saying Shark is not good (tbh I am not sure if Alexander maybe even has ironic :D), or Players who had success with it. This is the reason why I think it's important to have [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) on one hand and neon31 on the other and this is why their can be a deck that neon31 doesn't like but [Hearthstone-Decks.net](https://Hearthstone-Decks.net) does.
---
If you just force yourself to manually squelch at the start of every game it quickly becomes an automatic reflex.
---
Cringe
---
I think it is reasonable to run one operative and one spellbreaker. I made a handlock deck that runs one of each and in the non mech matchups i just use golden rafaam to turn it into a golden legendary. It doesn‚Äôt feel that good against mech hunter but it is fantastic against mech paladin. It turns a matchup that is otherwise unwinnable into one that I almost always win
---
This is the very definition of a witch hunt.
---
If I made an op right now that said that /u/Olistone_was_taken ripped me off with no actual proof of an order or anything what would you call that?

I think [[Gurubashi Hypemon]] might actually be good in this brawl.  Class cards it can discover are like Aya and Blade of C‚ÄôThun.  Neutral cards it can discover include C‚ÄôThun, Yogg, and N‚ÄôZoth.
---
Spirit of the Shark has not impressed so far.  Not too surprising, but I thought maybe with Jades.  (But the one time I had it, I was like ok, let me set this up so that I can get two battlecries on Aya, and honestly I think I would have been better just playing Aya on curve).  Maybe it sets up an OTK with C‚ÄôThun?

Also, the root cause of this issue is not ‚Äúhis word‚Äù at all - it was delayed orders, to which he has responded.

Are there any budget one turn kill decks in standard? I got the Frozen Throne adventure and the first boss requires OTK. I think with enough luck I could do it with Murloc Shaman but I'd rather not rely on a 6 wide board and Bloodlust.

You‚Äôre a bit late to the party, there‚Äôs already several comments about that way further up the thread.

Since 12 days, if you were sick for months and still had orders queued (like the previous post about you) why would you have started looking for new orders less than 2 weeks ago?
---
It just doesn't make sense dude.

Exactly. Some people in this thread really are just depressingly cynical. Time will tell if he‚Äôs a scammer or not. My money is firmly on ‚Äúnot.‚Äù

I started in Boomsday, but an aggro Hunter deck works pretty well.
---
haha holy shit that was their first ever comment in EIGHT YEARS of being on reddit.
---
I was literally thinking about this yesterday when I had a mage to 6 HP and couldn‚Äôt finish them off because they went from an empty board to one filled with Grave Horrors.
---
I totally agree with this buff, let‚Äôs help our priest friends out!
---
Straight up witch Hunt at the top of the sub, mods should become ashamed of themselves for letting OP ruin some guy's life when he never even tried to contact the guy for a refund, just PayPal.  Oh and the creator was delayed because he had a medical emergency.  Fuck this sub.
---
No, I just realised he meant removing the 12 from Conjurer's instead of adding an 11.
---
I delayed his order, but it was not intentional!
---
Even with a refund, I'll totally send the cards he ordered for free.
---
Everytime this kind of stuff gets brought up, it gets shot down, because it would make the game unplayable on mobile.
---
nar look OP is a bit of a kid or something, but this attitude of 
---
HELLO I HAVE PRECISELY DEFINED WHAT MANNERS ARE, ARE YOU A FUCKING IDIOT TO NOT ACCEPT MY PRECISE DEFINITION F MANNERS? 
---
is not clever or sensible.
---
They have pretermined ones and will automatically use golden ones. If you go to the new deck area, you can complete your deck, and the system will fill it with your best cards.
---
Of the last 29 classic packs I have opened 5 legendaries. I think classic packs have higher chance of getting legendaries.
---
I use him on a meme mill mage, you want to give the opponent the spell that make the 2 playes draw 2 or the other 2 cost spell that add 2 random to you hand minons
---
No he's not?? He's talking about how if you try to conjurer's a 10 drop it fizzles.
---
uh his name is visible I think
---
Can you post deck code?
---
Thanks that makes sence. In this instance I am a little salty that I lost because of this but my emotions aside it makes sence to program the card to only focus on your run and not things the opponent has done.
---
I actually think that has to do with their being no 0-drops in these sets. So there is nothing for 1 drops to devolve into. Same as the interaction with stuff like Molten Giants.

Great name blur execution

---
Probably not.
---
The Boomsday Project most likely began development roughly around the time Knights of the Frozen Throne was releases, and Whizbang the Wonderful was most likely one of, if not, the last cards to complete development. Card names, art, and flavor text are also some of the last elements of a card to be finalized.
---
The phase "Whizbanger" almost certainly in reference to what noise the gadgeteer's gun makes when fired rather than to Whizbang the Wonderful.
---
Wow I would have thought eBay and PayPal would have some Moans here, but nope, they actually are very good at protecting customers and even sellers who are victims.
---

eBay protection is only 30 days so it would not have helped this situation at all. The 180 day protection by PayPal is much more user friendly

---
The Warsong Commander you're thinking of was a nerfed version.
---
The original Warsong Commander was a 3 mana 2/2 with the card text: "Your other minions have Charge." That card was broken because Warriors used it to charge Giants.
---
Tbh i'd request a photo with a timestamp of the finished product that you're requesting if you ever want to buy something from a redditor, that way you don't get bamboozled.
---
Well both actually but i would prefer a budget tweak. i just wanna know if you guys have a better opinion since its just a budget deck or is there a must-be card that i must have to get at least rank 5

Sorry you may need 1 (I think). From there you just act as though your deck is complete and it will give you a bunch of cards you don't own to play with.

---
Point still remains. The card was bonkers.

---
haha, lol. Never got into it :(
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
That's a really rather awkward change. 
---
The giants combo in the early game is probably better solved by releasing more efficient single target removal, especially to classes that don't normally receive it.
---
So to explain, I was playing again this boss, and I had no units on the board. The boss had the same units on the board that are visible. Except the weasel tunneler was on his side of the board. 
---
I received a call which temporarily disconnected me. 
---
When I came back to the game, it reconnected and my board looked like this. A bunch of units from my deck all at 1/1 and no history on the left showing how this happened. Plus I also received 2 new cards in my hand. Before I disconnected, the last thing the boss had done was use that spell that gives both of us a golden legendary, and I received that 7 cost card. I still had the card in my deck too, so I ended up drawing them later.
---
bottom right buddy
---
The act of relying on certain cards at certain stage and not any earlier is rng in of itself.  
---
It's why people like aggro decks as almost any card is a good card.  
---
Or shitty decks like warrior where it's so overpowered that any card is a good card at anytime because you know you'll draw boom sooner or later and the opponent is fucked then.
---
If you're stuck on paladin murloc paladin is worth some tries, it took like ten games but as a nearly f2p player with a tiny collection at the time this was a super cheap option and it did EVENTUALLY work lmao that portrait is worth it
---
 You just cherry picked the win rate to justice why Dr. Boom should not be nerfed it is not the highest win rate card (which is bs to judge a card)--- WHICH IS A LIE TOWN CRIER (60.3% WIN RATE AND SO DOES DR.BOOM 60.3%)
---
Also, Dr. Boom allows warrior only to play one way and that is reactivity not proactive, which cause greedy decks like freeze mage to run pure greedy.
---
In the actual Brawl thread, one of the developers said that for this brawl they tried to limit discovers to just this block. If I knew how to link to comments on mobile I‚Äôd do so.
---
Nice
---
Furthermore,  Played win rate if you want to judge it off of played WR is at 63.4% which is god tier.

---
I didn't want to have to be the one to say it, but git gud.
---
How I did it: I copied a druid deck code, went into hs which had already an opened druid deck and 18 decks, instantly closed it but still got the ‚Äúwanna replace decks pop-up‚Äù clicked yes and it automatically made a 19th deck.
---
That's insane. Here in Spain the only carrier offering a true unlimited mobile data plan, at the moment, to my knowledge, is Vodafone and they charge 50 euros a month for that. Just the line and SIM card.

Most people have a limited amount of GBs to use. In my case I pay 11 euros/month for 6GB and that's a good price over here. Since I use wifi both at home and at the office that's still plenty of data for my needs but still... a scam.

Yeah, they don't immediately die at Rank 20. GL playing home brew at rank 10+, it's gonna be impossible with the amount of aggro and Big Priests.

---
....that's exactly the same in Wild. Odd Paladin, Odd Paladin, Even Shaman, Big Priest, Mecha'thun Lock (if you're lucky), more Big Priest.

At least that's how it works at rank 10+.

Okay, first and foremost: facts based on the average player are still facts. Just like I could present facts about a worse than average player base or a better than average player base.
---
You have yet to present any sort of actual data or evidence refuting what I'm saying. Give me some sort of reasoning why I'm wrong or misleading. Give me specific details like I've given you.
---
Present a legitimate argument for why you feel OP would be better than average and I'll respect your input. And hypothesizing that he's better than average because he's played for four years is not acceptable. Time played does not equate to ability. Plenty of people play for years and never reach legend or never get to that average of five arena wins per run.
---
I think you should be able to generate quests. They are spells just like all the other spells except it starts in your hand. Proved by zuljin replaying quests. Also Tess does it if I remembr right. Has to be rogue quest and you have to transform I to a different class hero card.
---
And honestly. If you could generate quests. That would be pretty fun and not unbalanced in any way.
---
HA, go play wild for like an hour or so, you'll see it happen. It's possible as early as turn 3 with warlock on coin. Mechwarper survives on 2, then you coin summoning portal.
---
I've just seen way too many missplays, lethals missed on Las Vegas Masters Tour (even from top dogs) to consider Hearthstone competitive in terms of 'better player wins'. Though , by RNG I meant the draw RNG whereas if you don't draw the cards you need in certain matchup you are screwed, no matter whether your sample size is 1, 20 or 1000 games. Variance in HS is way too huge. I'm just looking at it as a casual game where having fun rather than winning games is more important. Anyway, the point of the post was to get other and newer players get to recognize how much effort have you put into this game.
---
Because I didn‚Äôt beat it with warrior yet, and I saw my chance when SN1P-SN4P released
---
I don't know how it looks like, but from how are you interpeting I guess it's one of the hardest thing to acclaim in HS so yeah, you got the point.

When it comes to crafting, I strongly recommend crafting decks and not individual cards.

I just wanted to show my experience with it

Now it's a race to find Zola.
---
I understand. We can chat about the bug in that thread, feel free to post it there.
---
It's also been posted about 8-10 times on the sub since the brawl went live
---
So much this. Kill stuff, draw stuff, summon stuff, heal stuff.
---
Ok. Sorry for being an inconvenience
---
Piloted Shredder was busted and will be if it is back in Standard
---
This seems like it could pair extremely well with that passive where you get two copies of every minion you play at one cost shuffled into your deck, and makes you immune to fatigue. While it's true that passive is generally bad because the low cost cards in the early game dilute your deck, if you're playing to mill your opponent then it could potentially help with some of the more irritating bosses.
---
I‚Äôm rank 9 what‚Äôs is this
---
The caverns below, the original form of this card was ridiculous. Additionally, was a Rogue card. It needed to be nerfed not once but twice to balance it to a no that broken state. I'm glad is rotting in Wild's Hell.
---
You know whats even more crushing in a Controlmatchup? Getting 2 Elysianas from your Elysiana what i had in 1 CW Mirror match. Unfortunatly you will hit the Roundlimit at some Point what your oponnent Maybe could have gone for for a tie.
---
Possibly so, but rogue usually has no way of dealing with a board like that, especially because in this instance, vanishing would just give him bigger pogos. Just really good RNG for you that you happened to get a mass dispel
---
No u
---
:(
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it is intended to avoid instantly losing when getting to fatigue.
---
If you have 3 cards and reach fatigue, you draw 2 at the end of your turn (3 damage), draw 2 at the end of your Opponent's turn (7 damage), then 1 at the start of your turn (5) damage.
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding you, you're suggesting that taking 15 damage stops you from losing?
---
Lmaaoooo no it does not. Pogo rogue is a tier 2 deck at best, it just happens to have good matchups against control (which priest usually is) Pogo rogue has so many unwinnable matchups, this just isn't one of them
---
It's a little different, because he pulls from the deck. When you use the rat to pull a card out of their hand and then kill it, not only are potentially screwing them out of their combo finish, but you are reducing the amount of cards they have to play with. This isn't true with hecklebot. It would be comparable (almost) to if you were to add the line "then your opponent draws a card" to the end of rat, which would make it much worse.
---
That being said, if there was a combo deck so oppressive that your only hope was to disrupt the combo, people would more likely play it. But even then, it's worse than something like gnomeferatu, which wouldn't require you to have removal to play with it.
---
The way you‚Äôre describing it now makes it a lot more clear, if that is the case then it is a bug.
---
Technically we don't actually know, because we don't know how bombs are coded.
---
well um the card is pointless cuz it literally says "casts when drawn", not when discarded or played or "cast from opponents hand"
---
There could be a game mode where it has unnerfed versions of cards so people could play patron warrior or aggro decks with leper gnome, knife juggler, arcane golem, abusive sergeant, owl, leeroy
---
Not as much, because the wild meta diversity is much bigger as you can see in the meta report I linked.
---
Your spell power affects the bombs you draw, but Omega Mind doesn't give the bombs you draw lifesteal. Prismatic Lens doesn't switch the cost as far as I know. I think there are others but can't think of them. It's weird in general that the bomb "casts itself" instead of you casting it automatically (all effects that have something else cast the spell are bad)
---
Alright will take it on carefully. Thank you!:)
---
Garvey#21613 EU, 80 g quest. You go first.
---
Not making an excuse for fixing bugs, but next time something like this happens you should just instantly press Alt + F4 and relaunch the game. Of course, the bug should still be fixed, but this could easily prevent you from losing a game to any sort of a bug in the future.
---
Man, I miss Reno... are there many Reno decks in wild?
---
[Update 1](https://imgur.com/a/mKTToen)
---
Are there many Reno decks in wild? Seems like a lot of the top decks are super-quick Aggro, can control decks last long there?
---
Golden Tony has golden fireBALLs
---
Never posted before
---
This.  Shudderwock has little impact in the majority of Murloc decks.  If someoen wants Shudder/Loc they should just make a Shudderwock deck with Underbellies.
---
Hagatha gives you a chance in basically every matchup.  Personally I removed her simply because it isn't fun to play out a long ass game vs a control warrior.  I'd rather concede and move on.  The majority of the wins with Murloc involve turn 1/2 Underbelly followed by a non-stop swarm.
---
Cum is sticky.
---
Teach us your ways
---
I can‚Äôt really see the context but that actually might be the play, no meme.
---
How helpful is Framebot in closing out a 12 Health enemy? 1 mana Take 5 damage draw a card, maybe find lethal faster seems like actually the best choice.
---
What‚Äôs different about Patron Warrior? It should still work, other than the card that gives charge to minions with 3 or less attack, right? Which is sorta a big deal, but still.
---
Do you ever see Secret Paladin in wild? God, that deck was awful...
---
My phone has this app called Notes
---
Classic
---
Was he actually making moves while you couldn't do anything, or you just mean him hovering his card over the board by that?
---

Yes I did. Unless the game can choose the same reward twice from the additional reward pool. Than you can get up to 460.

10/10/10 | At the end of your turn, put a minion from your deck into the battlefield.  
---
wait can you even *use* the 19th deck? the ui just breaks right?
---
it is explained in a comment dude... also Im sure the UI doesnt show more then 18 so you cant *use* the 19th deck, but can just leave it there
---
Yeah. Taking the best cards out of a format would result in a new format. That's not a new concept at all. MtG's Legacy and Vintage formats have been showing as much for upwards of a decade. Plus, Power of Creation, Mass Ressurection, and Hagatha's Scheme are having a negligible impact on the format as is. I am surprised you listed those over Dire Frenzy and Master's Call.
---
However, a complete midrange based format would not be a good state for the game as is the case whenever its just one dominate archetype. All of the issues with Arena games would be present in constructed, and constructed is better when there is a cost to playing the best cards in a present format.
---
Getting to play Conjurer's Calling means having to essentially give up any early game board presence or play Dragons and Book of Specters and giving up all other spells.
---
Getting to play Dr. Boom, Mad Genius means having to play an entirely reactive, slow game, giving your deck a defined and exploitable weakness the likes of Deathrattle based decks, Combo decks, and Pogo Rogue can exploit.
---
Getting to play with Master's Call means giving up cards like Crystalizer, Houndmaster, and Houndmaster Shaw, which makes your deck more one dimensional.
---
If you want your Zul'jin to win you the game, you better keep on pressuring your opponent, forcing them to use all of their wide removal, so the board you construct with it sticks.
---
So on and so forth.
---
As I also stated, Midrange still exists. Midrange Hunter, Mech Paladin, Token Druid without mechs, Dragon Mage, I'd want to call the Hooktusk Rogue deck midrange leaning, and Deathrattle Hunter are all Midrange decks.
---
I don't even think Hearthstone could be pure Curvestone when there are between nine hundred and twelve hundred cards in and individual Standard season. MtG formats have shown the more cards in a format, the faster and more combination or synergy based those formats become. There are just too many cards to make even accidental, powerful synergies impossible to occur. 
---
Early Hearthstone only had four hundred cards in comparison, most with a rather limited scope in their effect text if they had any at all.
---
The has game evolved past that, and if you want that grindy game-play experience, Arena is still there.
---
Yes. But Hagatha is not a nickname for Hagatha the Witch. It was a bas example is all u/Tank1an was saying.
---
They did something to support wild players for once so of course now standard or newer players are going to complain about it. This mode will be gone in a few days, you‚Äôll be fine.
---
GET DOWN
---
Your original comment only applies at 3 wins. The math works out very differently if you move it up, which has been my point all along. 
---
You're the one putting words in my mouth.
---
Oh yes thank you, they giveaway the golden one too
---
wasnt able to try it
---
It‚Äôs even better if u get the ‚Äúall tables full‚Äù message in the loading screen
---
Tracking is still too useful for digging for a card to play though, even in Midrange Hunter (which is why the tournament decks play it). Tracking is one of the best cards in the game.
---
aw rip :(
---
[...](https://hsreplay.net/cards/#sortBy=playedWinrate)
---
Note the played winrates. Each of those top three cards, Pyroblast, Savage Roar, and Bloodlust, have a much higher *played winrate* than Dr. Boom Mad Genius.
---
We can keep going back and forth on this statistics game if you want, but it is just going to be use endlessly siting statistics rather than discussing the core issue of any card mentioned if there is one at all.
---
The basic and classic sets are banned in the Brawl. I bet the 9 basic hero powers are also banned from random generation, so Renounce has nothing to pick from. Also explains why the Hero Power doesn't refresh. It fails to replace it, then it gives you a bunch of cards based on the one you still have.
---
DooM#13660 NA quest trade
---
Wanna do tavern brawl because I dont have old cards. Show yours and I'll go first
---
You are clearly not reading the card text.  It specifically says: "THAT player."
---
Win 3 games in a row
---
Seems simple enough
---
I think that I lost to the boss that has a hero power that banishes a minion.
---
I don't. Hsreplay does though. Idk what reason you have to not believe the raw data, even when it matches your experience.
---
It's a little revenge for Priest stealing our cards and playing with our minds throughout the HS history.
---
Grats on completing the useful classic set :p
---
yeah, a lot of posts of people playing cards with the intended interaction. most people are like "oh no I got 3 bombs!" but these situations happen a lot too, people just dont post these ones
---
I think you're confusing style and theme. Hearthstone is similar to many other card games where the art on the cards are done by a number of different artists so the styles do differ, but they all adhere to the same theme.
---
SakamotoSan#11763 NA 
---
Trading 80g Quest. I will show mine, but you go first. Please pick an aggro deck.
---
Card games aren't supposed to be super consistent with art style. Utilizing a bunch of artists like that would be a waste without letting them give their flair. I personally think your example looks worse.
---
I think i saw a post that if you put in a legendary then autocomplete a deck, you can get anotjer one in the deck
---
In my last game as Control Shaman, Elysiana gave me two more Shudderwocks. Still feeling kind of dirty from that.
---
Check my post history if you want dude, I'm literally just a fan.
---
I lost, he was playing C'thun Reno shaman and I was playing a thief Reno rogue, dumb me equipped a shaman weapon midgame not realizing it would re-equip itself with Tess, breaking my 8 attack Spectral Cutlass...
---
So you disconnected briefly and desynced. Again, restarting the game would fix that. The card hovering in the center like that has been a signal of s dc/desync since closed beta.
---
&gt;It is an over exaggeration
---
at least you're honest
---
fake news spotted!
---
Best I can do here is show the [full screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/yuFL49N.png)
---
Trust me, I have no photoshop skills lol
---
Reno C'thun Shaman vs Reno thief Rogue
---
Under the current system, no, but they've shown a willingness to change before so hope springs eternal.
---
I mean, OP was complaining about long and boring games and that's certainly not the case with Big Priest and Quest Mage. Games against them are pretty fast paced and you usually know the outcome of the game early on (It does depend on what deck you play yourself, though).
---
Warrior is not great because of that card. It‚Äôs great because it can condense all it value into 1 Hero card and leave the rest to be removal/tech for the meta unlike Shaman and Mage that has to dedicate multiple cards for value. People need to stop saying ‚Äúremove the mech tag‚Äù and start saying remove Dr. Boom.
---
If you aren't a super sayan it's really not my problem.
---
Nope i get it too. All the other sounds work but the beats won't play
---
Arcane Dynamo seems too slow. I like the Buffoon but if you don't get both Spirit of Frog and a Portal maker then it's more or less a dead card.
---
&gt;"Young Caine, when I was a boy, I fell into a hole in the ground and I was broken and could not climb out. I might have died there but a stranger came along and saved me. He said it was his obligation. That for help he had once received, he must in return help ten others each of whom would then help ten others so that good deeds would spread out like the ripples from a pebble in a pond. I was one of his ten and you became one of mine. And now I pass this obligation on to you." - Master Po

---
Missclicks and presses the bomb
---
Burn Shaman is a 50% matchup vs Mech Hunter, hardly a counter. Token Druid is only 47.7%.
---
The best counters in the entire game only have a 57.1% winrate vs it which is Big Shaman, that's literally the hardest counter that sucks vs a lot of other stuff. After that in 2nd place is Murloc Shaman with 54.5%. mech Hunter is definitely overtuned, as is hunter as a whole. not saying it needs to be nerfed particularly (because I play Control Shaman with double Hex and double Earth Shock), but I wouldn't be against it either.
---
Well yeah because you can craft 80 wisps
---
Not enough to kill Druid from ~3 months ago though
---
Funnily enough I decided to go with this deck as I was having terrible games against them on my midrange hunter.
---
This one looks good but I‚Äôd put in a second dead mans hand for a blood razor and consider tweaking for more armor gain. https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/cthun-warrior-33/
---
Considering wild growth is the exact same spell without the 1/1 body I'd agree.
---
Do people realize its a Reservoir Dogs reference? Or are people disliking the quality despite knowing the [source material is equally single-minded?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjITICjEqR8)
---
But do you know the feeling of playing Geist against them? I know it from both sides. Minus 9 cards or more, almost no win condition thatnks to that. If you play it early, of course.
---
You can get a random deck if you enter with an incomplete deck
---
Awesome thanks a bunch! :D.

Here‚Äôs a r/wild thread about the idea too https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/wildhearthstone/comments/aphjxf/cthun_warrior/
