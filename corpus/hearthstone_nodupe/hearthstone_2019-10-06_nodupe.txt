Could you share your deck with me pls? : )
---
We liked this suggestion a lot, but ended up adding stealth to it since it fit the character too much to not include.You can see artwork of the card version here on Boz's twitter.[https://twitter.com/BozPotatoz/status/1180613556401852416](https://twitter.com/BozPotatoz/status/1180613556401852416)

EDIT: Oh, I should specify that it's my WoW character - Kass Keelhaul. We named the card "Blackwater Privateer", since she wasn't a Legendary.
---
wait... if you used expired merchant on the nether portal....

oh, okay!
---
I dusted golden tekhan to craft Tess. I have No regrets
---
That's ridiculous. Sky temple is so useless
---
Totally the other way around, dust can do so much more than golden cards that just look pretty. I dislike using golden cards though, so that comes into play for me.
---
Cards created by the Sinkhole's hero power. They cast when drawn and remove the next three cards.
---
This is good advice right here. Nothing like completing a strategy that needed Leeroy or Malygos and you know those guys are going to be there forever (or return their full dust value in case they go)
---
You were right and it's certainly a possibility, companies have done shadier shit to paint their product in a better light

This card exists?

*Goosebumps theme*
---
I have a good C'thun druid deck that i love to pieces. Won 80% of the time it was in standard
---
And add the usual 5 armor intead of setting hp to 15. Not sure if it would be too strong tbh.
---
He sure does
---
I used Reno to play the control game in its first phase, try to not damage him even if you could ( miss face damage ). Let him kill you and then pick Finley with the overload hero power; while he takes fatigue damage build a gigantic army on board and buff the Finley's lifesteal weapon with your hero power. When he's going to change phase smorc him real hard ( you have to almost skip the second phase ). Then during his third phase try to survive with your 5/X lifesteal weapon. If you die with Finley I would recommend picking Elise because of Addarah, you will need a cheap board clear to get rid of the old gods/giants
---
Good Luck!
---
She's hawt
---
Cause Yogg was extremely fun. I play games to have fun, not for the competitive integrity.
---
The Old Gods expansion in Karazahn were the best times I had building decks and playing the game. You could still make your scuffed decks work up til Jade kinda ruined any value deck you wanted. 
---
My Dragon/C'Thun druid actually did pretty well. Probably could have made it to Legend eventually if I played enough.
---
And then I also played a Renounce Darkness/Zoo that was really fun and you could win with.
---
Which is really annoying I must add. When one of the players pops up in chat you know that the match will last only 30 more minutes at most, and it often becomes obvious who won or lost based on the current score on stream. I'm guessing there's no rule preventing the GMs from doing this though.
---
Yeah I played that to complete the quest that requires tavern brawl wins, then tried a Reno deck.
---
There's an interesting interaction with Khartut and N'zoth that I'm not sure people realize yet. Khartut has reborn, so if your opponent clears him completely, N'zoth brings him back twice, with reborn. So if you put 2 copies in your deck and they both die, N'zoth will bring back 4 copies.
---
This isn't speculation, I've seen it in wild.
---
Dude rakinishu predates heathstone by 20 years
---
Still doesn’t change the fact king togwaggle doesn’t appear anywhere else
---
I've never even seen that treasure
---
i have no gold tbh.. it would take ages for me to earn all chapters by gold.... i would need to buy it :(
---
Fork over the 15€....
---
I know this is late, but do most ice block mages run minions? My personal deck runs only spells, so i figured that paladins minions couldnt trade in to make board space
---
He's in the best Warlock deck atm so yes.

more like "Who am I? &lt;&lt;&lt;CHRISTMAS TREE SCREECH&gt;&gt;&gt;" now with even more secrets
---
They’ve added lots of free card packs you earn for going up optional lower ranks. They will help you be more competitive for free alongside daily quests which earn you gold. You also get a free pack every week from the tavern brawl mode. It’s more f2p friendly than it has been in the past
---
Using weapon removal is more rewarding. As it is Aluneth is *guaranteed* at least 3 cards.
---
Doesn't seem to be enough. Just had a deck hit the second treasure choice with exactly 3 7-drops (1x Crowd Roaster, 2x Gahz'rilla). I was offered Gnomebliterator/Zephrys's Lamp/Staff of Ammunae).
---
In case it ultimately proves relevant, the curve topped out with a single 8-drop (Kathrena).
---
"based on boring as Egypty" Get the fk outta here mate.
---
I absolutely murdered him with Finley. Went with the 5/1 lifesteal weapon and 1 mana discover a minion power. Got lucky when I evolved into a Grand Archivist with Finley’s Pith Helmet as the only spell left in my deck. Casting that after every turn was awesome. The discover hero power let me dig for answers including multiple Kalimos’, Thekals and Grumbles.
---
Yeah i understand, all decks have a counter. I was just curious that you didnt mention the weakness to iceblock mage, but it looks like its just my ice block mage that is weird. 
---
Tbh i havent played against a lot of ice block mages, so I thought minionless was pretty standard
---
Nope. The WoW community ships Anduin with [[Wrathion]]

Used hakkar in 200-300 range without realising they get a new deck, and decked them again in the 100-200 range and there was no blood
---
Wow ok where do we want to begin?
---
Ffs man it’s not bad but it’s probably too good lol. There’s a 10 mana 2/14 with divine shield and that’s not that bad. 
---
It is 10 mana though so maybe it’s balanced... hmm. 
---
I mean most the time you won’t even have taunt minions with this.
---
It’s also a beast which is synergy which is nice. 
---
Big plus since it’s not a fucking priest card lol.
---
Fuck I’m actually having a hard time evaluating this since it is a 10 mana card. I can’t tell if it’s too good and will be played in every deck or if it looks good but horrible in decks.
---
Any source to this? Which set are the 20 packs from?
---
what conditions needed to be met to get an extra 10s? just curious.

Snip snap is used in warlock with a huge discount so you can have 3 or more huge snipsnaps magnetized. People who play the deck get banned because some hacks let you maximize your snipsnap plays in a way that is humanly impossible.
---
And now walkers who want to rank up play the deck and go boohoo when they get banned. But I dudnt cheat old pls pls. Meanwhile blizzard hasn't officially addressed the issue

Small indie developer.
---
Rotating just means you give up the twist's advantage and place a shitty minion (better two) on the left. Finley's default Hero Power (summon a 2/1 Amalgam Explorer) helps a lot. Weapons are indeed useless because of Plague of Madness, except Blade of the Burning Sun. If you time Crusty the Crustecean right, somewhere after the first phase, you can burst the Plague Lord for a lot of damage.
---
You also have to remember that legendary weapons were not a thing when doomhammer was made
---
Dirty Rat is a frequently run tech card against battle cries and combo decks. Just play it when you can also use a removal.
---
22 for ranking up, 3 from uldum expansion, 9 from single player, a few from tavern brawls, first arena run, a few quest, some events sould add to 40-45... if you do it in a week or 2. if you are slower it will be more...
---
That's dumb, if you wait you loose a lot of resources until april when the rotation happens.
---
I get that your "technically legal" because the amount of snip snap played is just a bit below the bannable but jesus fuck stop playing that deck.
---
You have seen before how sketchy these bans were. You know how stupid costumer service can be. But you insist on playing this exact deck just because you want to pull of this questionable combo.
---
Tl;dr: costumer service sucks, but you were playing with fire.
---
[removed]
---
So funny and original.
---
Most of the picture looks amazing! But somehow the face look like it's a tranny instead of jaina. I think it's the wide jaw and chin.
---
22 from ranks, 10-20 from unique quests.  6 from Dalaran/Tombs 1 wing solo.  Then the big variance is time.  If you're doing your quest daily, you'll average about 2 packs every 3-4 days.  If you do it in 4 days you'll get around 45 packs.  Take a month?  Closer to 70 from quest/win gold and brawl packs.
---
I think a new graphics card would be wisest
---
Keep it in case next expansion has some surprises that have good synergies. Warlock has been lacking for a while. It may be the time they boost its power
---
Ok. Let's do the math to you see how ridiculous that number is. 
---
You tipically play around 75 to 90 hands of poker online per hour (IRL the number must be lesser than this, but let's take a great upper bound of how many hands you play per hour). To play 100,000 hands you need 100,000/90 = 1111 hours approximately. Since the day has 24 hours, you need to play 46 days NO STOP on average to play that many hands. This doesn't consider time to sleep or eat. You need more or less around 70 days of ONLY playing poker in your awake time. That's 2 entire months.
---
Do you see now how ridiculous that number is?
---
Ok maybe I’m missing something bc I didn’t want to read all the articles in full, but all of these seem to be just recent posts to do with various “trump bad” things; so let me just say again: just because someone makes a terrible president or if they break they law, does not make them by default a fascist
---
I like the sac pact interaction with Jaraxxus but I think this is not an unreasonable take. It’s a bit less of a wow moment when like a third of the decks are running Zephrus.
---
Jaraxxus was meta in classic in the very powerful handlock and almost no one ran sac pact.
---
Post your favorite deck
---
Why do they always rope until the last second when the play is most probably decided way before that (this is a real question btw I always see it in gm and get confused)
---
why do you need friends to play HS? You play ranked vs other random players.
---
Snip Snap is so problematic that the server's think you are cheating....
---
Or just put a limit to the amount of times you can use echo.

" I’ve been seeing it advertised quite a lot everywhere and it looks quite fun but browsing this sub would indicate otherwise."  
---
Most other subs are the same, people only open their mouth about the bad stuff, not the good stuff.
---
I am right.
---
It's just you.
---
shady as fuck
---
Why not? its fair for the ones who kept them. 
---
If they give those copies away for free the whole time then "fuck the people who invested time/money/dust into making them before" right?
---
It actually makes sense because they will incite people into making them after they play with them for one month.
---
I am rarran, been playing hearthstone since closed beta, and hit legend multiple times! My youtube is about showcasing awesome decks and how to play them! I also love to make people laugh and have a good time.

Nope.
---
no it won't. just don't classify hero jaraxxus as a demon, or use another hard code fix
---
If you want, I can add you and help you with f2p playing....
---
Learning the Arena is a great way to get a lot of cards as f2p, but there's many little tips that can go a long way
---
But you can always be competitive as f2p. Out of the last 4 months, I only missed rank 5(arguably competitive) once.
---
I won 20 games in a row in Wild, after just picking up a deck....
---
The game is somewhat p2w, if you want all of the decks and cards, but realistically, if you find one deck you really love, you're probably going to play that mainly on ladder, and getting just one deck is great for f2ps.
---
The rewards and progression system is kinda sucky rn and the game isn't getting updated that much(NEW UPDATE LOOKS AWESOME THOUGH!), but otherwise, it's a great game at its core and this sub mainly just wants to be able to continue loving it. I'm sure you'll love it and fit right in..
---
You would only have to pay for cards if you want every last one.. You don't need to pay to have one deck.
---
But anyway, for decks, you will probably open specific cards from your packs, you may need someone to help you out for crafting decks based off of those cards, because the cheapest deck in the meta might not be the cheapest deck for you...(or the most fun...)
---
Try to get all of your classes unlocked, save your Arena run until you learn Arena, if it seems interesting, and unlock Tavern Brawl(unlocked with a level 20 class) as soon as possible...
---
Don't dust cards unless you absolutely need the dust. The cards you dust would be far more valuable when they are eligible for free refunds or more(nerfs and Hall of Faming).
---
When a card is nerfed, you can disenchant it for its CRAFT value, when a card is HoFed, you get its craft value as soon as it gets HoFed, without disenchanting the card.
---
I'd suggest not crafting any new decks until the new event comes out, as it will greatly affect the meta and the kind of decks you're building...
---
I recommend Midrange decks for fun, and Aggro decks for speed, on your ladder climb. Midrange decks give more diverse play IMO and Aggro decks are super quick(they kill you early on)...
---
Watch Trump's videos to learn the game, always look at streamers to pass on knowledge to you...
---
Learn the mulligan, learn trading etc...
---
And learn your deck. Learn it like the back of your hand....
---
And there's a lot more but it's late at night and I'm tired. Hope this helps give you a few ideas about the game...
---
Terrible text, unfitting art, and wrong sub
---
I agree that the blog post can still be confusing, even after they clarified. I brought that up to them again too. 
---
More importantly, do you actually feel what you write here is what they mean, or are you just saying this to be a contrarian? If you’re sure, I’ll bet you a Set 16 preorder we’ll get to keep the event cards for two months. Ok?
---
It's really sad that these are the best players in HS.
---
It's also important to note that zephrys has arguably the best battlecry in the game. Especially when you take its cost into consideration.
---
Guess you can call it a *miracle Rogue...*
---
Bruh you can't pull the "not to be prejudiced, but..." and then just prejudice card
---
And care to analyze HOW it was condescending? Since I of course never heard the guy say it, it's possible he was very sincere. Over the internet, you can't really tell how someone feels...
---
Sounds good thanks for the heads up.
---
why the f is the card still in the game?
---
I am tired of answering your questions. Tell me first where was I insulting him, since you accused me of doing that. I don't like the game we are playing. You are throwing accusations and questions and wait to see which one sticks.
---
OP faced 32% priest...if we assume the 5% losses were all priest, then OP's winrate vs. priest was (32% - 5%) / 32% = 84%.
---
So I'd say it does OK vs. whatever priest deck was meta at the time.
---
&gt;5-6k dust decks 
---
That's hardly anything. The most expensive decks in a format usually cost at least ten thousand, and six thousand dust is something a new player like you should be able to accumulate somewhat easily.
---
In one of the replies, you included a swearword. Is that enough for you? It also had a very strict tone suggesting that he stop this conversation at once.
---
Culture is not prejudice. You can shut your eyes, but there are tangible differences between how people in certain countries are raised and socialised.
---
This is exactly why I didn’t buy this expansion. I won’t put up with this rigged nonsense any longer.
---
OH, your a casual. My bad. Without guys like you we wouldn't have a fun community.
---
swearword? And? Are we 5 years old to not use swearwords? You said I insulted him. Show me where I personally insulted him? Why would you slander? You yourself use questionable tactics to weaken my arguments, by inventing things I didnt say and defending a person who uses a rapist mentality.
---
Thank god, get rid of that POS.
---
It really depends on where you look.
---
I assumed the spells were discounted by some other means, that doesn't automatically mean he had Khadgar's Scrying Orb. That should be a given piece of information otherwise you would just be guessing. That's not obvious at all, and calling me stupid for not guessing OP had that specific passive is stupid in itself. This was a shitty lethal puzzle.
---
Yeah that was what I was referring too.
---
They should hard cap all cards to 20x per turn, and avoid this issue for any further updates. I can't think of any other card that could be affected by this.
---
Holy shit youthful brewmaster! I heard he sees play in some highlander decks, congrats!
---
We're in the endgame now.
---
Context: took Slatebrand as my pre-run treasure, in boss one I got the Hearthstone as the battlecry, used it, then managed to give her Right Hand Man (always in starting hand). Completed boss one, got given VIP Membership. After boss three gave her Gang's All Here (3 extra copies), and from that point on was just trying not to put any bad cards in the deck. During boss four got another Hearthstone - even more valuable now that I've got VIP Membership - and ran back to Bob after looking through a few more treasures. Got \*another\* Gang's All Here, plus 6 other gold worth of goodies, so now I've got 7 copies in the deck (plus Dorian + discover hero power should be able to give me an extra treasure if he survives the turn cycle).
---
I think I'd still take a Bombastic deck if it gets offered to me as I've seen how damn powerful they are (got the mage one at one point, and I kid you not, the last 3 bosses had zero turns between them as I managed to go off on turn 1 in the final 3 games), but right now this deck is looking freaking amazing. XD
---
Edit: boss four attempt two. Another Hearthstone after a whole bunch of searching (jeebus there are a lot of treasures that can clone Slatebrand in one way or another). After my fourth Bob visit this run, I have now spent a total of 22 gold before killing the fourth boss.
---
Edit 2: boss four attempt three, another Hearthstone. Dug through treasures til I wasn't confident the boss wouldn't suicide, then used it (there's every chance I could OTK final boss through Gnombliterations, though right now I'm at 1/30 required). 6 more gold spent - had to waste one due to sub-par options - but that puts me at 28 gold spent (without Hearthstone, the most you usually get with VIP is... 13 I think?). Now up to 10 Slatebrands (out of 31 cards), with one of those being a 6/6 and one being an 8/8. Also think my neighbours might be concerned as I'm cackling like a madman.
---
Edit 3: going to do running updates. Enjoying this waaay too much. Ended up being forced to kill them as I couldn't find a Hearthstone, though I did get a Gnomebliteration so at 2/30 now. Honestly, the biggest issue here was that the boss couldn't contribute enough to killing the Slatebrands - if the boss had infinite removal, I literally could've gotten about 20-30 extra treasures (that is not an exaggeration - the first 4 minions I had die were all Slatebrands, so each "rez the first 4" treasures would lead to 8 more treasures, plus I had one of the "fill the board with 1/1s" treasure). Still, I won't give up on getting more Hearthstones and Gnomebliterators! Having seen how this has performed, I'm doubtful I'll take Bob's Bombastic deck; I can't imagine they're all as good as the mage one (and for all I know I got very lucky with the draws in that one) whereas this deck is proving extremely consistent early one.
---
Edit 4: ended up recording it because I knew this run was something special. So no running commentary here. I'll figure out what I'm going to do with the video, but here are some cliff notes:
---
* Tried to get a Hearthstone in every fight it was possible. Hand clogging was a serious issue; my board was constantly overwhelming the bosses making it hard to make room, and a lot of the treasures spawn multiple minions. It's pretty telling that I \*never\* felt like I was in danger on any of the fights.
---
* By the end of the run my starting hand was 3 Slatebrands - all 0 cost, two 8/8 and one 6/6.
---
* I ended up casting 12 Gnomebliterates before the first encounter with the final boss.
---
* I ended up spending 74 gold across the whole run, though the effective spending is a little less (I believe Good Food doesn't stack past 2 buffs regardless of how many times you go back, and I kind of wish I hadn't ever Recruited a Veteran; even the potentially useful Thaurissans were basically useless).
---
* I started up the fight with the Lord of Death, and he took 120 damage from the Gnomeblits and went straight to phase 2. I started up as per usual, and amongst my early game treasures were two more Gnomeblits and a Hearthstone. So I pushed him to phase 3, Hearthed, took some upgrades just in case my hunch was incorrect, went back in - and sure enough, he exploded before turn 1. It's almost a shame, because the ridiculous deck didn't even have to do anything.
---
* I've only seen two of Bob's decks - the quest reward one, and the Medivh one - and if his other decks are of a similar power level, I don't think I'm wrong at all by saying this deck was much stronger than those. I would dare say this is Brann's combo (compared to Reno with a few, Elise with Scout+Moonfire, and Finley with Lance+overload power); like the others it requires a little help to go off (VIP wouldn't have been mandatory, but did make things \*much\* more powerful), but if you can hit Right Hand Man and/or The Gang's All Here you're looking very good.
---
Pretty much. Seems obvious to just make echo "repeatable up to 10 times this turn" or whatever. Even 5 would make sense to me. How is this so big an issue that people are still being banned?

I've played a few 100k hands of poker in 1000 hours. No one plays one table at a time. It's common to play at least 4 and some people like to play 12 tables at a time. I prefer 6-9.
---
Some professional players have 1m+ hand databases.
---
“Oh no, I can’t cheat out a shitty board on turn 4 or five and have to pay normal mana like every other aggro deck! Oh woe is me!” You’ll forgive me if I laugh at your low roll, ya casino loving chump.

Just like Grull needs to golden
---
Don’t play that deck and abuse mechanics. You deserve to get banned and anyone else who uses the deck it’s cheating.
---
I don't follow. In a single game of hearthstone, usually anyone can win due to variance unless there's an insane deck/skill difference. The degree that RNG plays a role is less than poker though, but it's exactly the same concept. After a large sample size of hearthstone games you're going to be closer to your true winrate than if you played a few games.
---
Wtf is wrong with you asshole
---
What priest deck I haven't lost to a priest in like three days?
---
Aggressive Bargaining has so much flavor even Gordon Ramsey approves.
---
I mean we have to take into account those 0.00001% of turns where decision making is crucial and you really have to grind those gears to make the right or best play.
---
The rest is just people acting like hearthstone requires 5000IQ to play and make it look like they made the biggest play ever.

This deck has worked very well for me. You can sub the soularium for another egg or something and Leeroy is just a very good finisher the sea giants and magic carpets are pricy but great cards to have, especially the giants since they are classic.
---
You sound like a genuine and nice person. Probably tough to survive here on reddit. I hope it works out for you. Good Luck.

thx

Tacky advertising.

It's due to Lord Jaraxxus's Battlecry.
---
You don't see him after being played, similarly you don't see Shudderwock
---
The irony of a couch-warrior telling someone they should be putting their life in danger from the safety behind his computer screen is insane.
---
Are you American? If this bothers you so much, have you tried contacting your representatives in an attempt to convince them to change their policy on China? Oh, you haven't? Then delete your absurd comment and stop embarrassing yourself.
---
Do you happen to have a decklist?
---
I love that there's so many different and fun decks to play in wild
---
How do you get that from what I said? You don't.
---
Everything I said makes logical sense and I don't have problem hitting legend, up until latest expansion I would use Jaraxxus to do that.
---
You're boring. You don't have any points to make, and you're trying to downplay my playing ability because YOU don't understand. You also failed to actually address anything I said, or provide any pro-interaction arguments, like I said. For someone who's telling me to "apply cube thinking", you seem to have a more casual relationship with basic logic than I have with Hearthstone.
---
Stop being a crap redditor. I continue to address every stupid thing you say, and THAT is the best comment you can come up with. You sound casual dude.
---
Me too! (Though I did cheat by getting it from the Golden adventure pack :P)
---
better go play murloc shaman
---
Not at the moment but I will gladly find you one if you can’t yourself atm
---
Do you have a dust range you’d be working in?
---
Oops, I should have clarified I meant when he was in standard, things are quite different now of course.
---
Fight the power.
---
Played early he can certainly turn bad matchups into favored games. He would be too slow for an aggro deck, but Zoo is best played as a tempo deck, and he's offering so much tempo in successive turns it's not even funny. I would not play him without Magic Carpet, though. The 4/4 lackeys are impressive on their own but backbreaking with +1 attack and rush.
---
Yes spending time thinking is important but waiting and cramming everything in 10s makes most people feel no sympathy when you fuck up.
---
You're probably going to end up playing both in Tempo Mage.
---
Mate, if you were right there won't be anything vague.
---
'You will get free copies of the wild cards until they won't be playable anymore in standard.' 
---
They didn't say that and none of you can give me a link to something like that. 
---
It's not fair that I crafted those cards and they will get free copies of the cards the same way it's not fair they would have to craft those cards only to use them for two months in standard. That's why the middle point and the most fair would be to give 1 month for each side. 
---
At this point you are conecting dots when its clear for me. But you want it your way so I look like the crazy one. 
---
We'll see who's right.
---
People dumb enough to do that aren't the sort of people they should be making decisions based upon.

Guaranteed hits on minions is kinda cool though, like Vanilla Ice

Ribbit vs. Flame on!
---
I know it's not as simple.
---
That's precisely why I provided the Squire and Protector example. It's a clear-cut example, whereas Dart Frog and Flamewaker isn't as clear-cut.
---
Yeah well the card has a meme place in my heart, I'll try to bring him to legend again, but might be needed is a more aggro based meta. You make good points though, so we'll see.
---
ohhhhhhhhhhhh sorry sorry didnt see the *39
---
sorry my bad
---
HSReplay.net , hearthpwn , and tempostorm all have easily browasble and copyable deck lists.
---
There is probably enough public info that they won't need his IP. But doesn't Taiwan play on APAC servers? So Netease won't help.
---
Still, heroic act though.
---
throwback to flamewaker coin mirror image
---
I feel like all the people commenting about how these cards are the same power level haven’t actually played with Flamewaker. Magic Dart frog is hot trash and always has been.
---
&gt; Only targeting minions can be an advantage
---
I think minion damage is strictly better in nearly all scenarios. If you have control of the board you just get face damage from having the board.
---
whizbang maybe? its not that uncommon to see whizbang in rank 20-15. it is glaringly obvious with golden whizbang, not so much with normal whizbang
---
That anomaly is unique in that the shuffled minions keep their enchantments.  Was the Tomb Diver silenced before it died?
---
Agreed
---
FR
---
Batterhead can attack again after it attacks and kills a minion.  Mass Hysteria potentially allows Batterhead to gain this extra attack before he uses his normal one, if Hysteria makes him kill a minion.
---
Ah okey, thanks for the info. I didnt know that.
---
I hope nothing happens to him...
---
Except when the opponent has no minions and you need face damage before you run out of steam...
---
Mtg arena is the best option, gwent is a little different and kinda dead but it's still fun nonetheless
---
Yes that is the one scenario that it is better hence nearly all
---
I never called you stupid.
---
You mean favorite as in "just for the lulz" or "wins most games" or "i wish i had it"?
---
The deck i play for shits and giggles is either a pogoshark-rogue or mechathun warlock (card-drops) which is totally offmeta and just exists to tilt people i mentioned into Narnia when it wins (it doesn't 90% of the time). And even those decks lack the 4-6 legendaries everybody runs at the lowest rank.
---
The deck i try to play to win because i actually got cards for it is secret mage, which doesn't work because i lack luna whizbang and archmage, or different versions of a tempo rogue, which doesn't work because.. we know why..
---
I actually got soularium for zoo but it lacks vulture and other core things so it's just a worse version of a deck you can craft from standard cards (at least that's what it feels like when you face someone who picks 1out of 3 spells a lot of times to simply adapt to your combo and you'd be better of dropping standard yetis and ogers). Not to mention everything tempo i run simply does not pack enough punch to not get overwhelmed by quest builds 70% of the time. The only 2 builds i can win a lot against is murloc shaman or comborpriest if i get lucky and play it correctly but only because i basically counterbuilded that.
---
What i wish i had? Yeah let's start with the free kit-kat mech basically every budget deck runs, people who didn't play at that time need to craft to actually run anything of worth. This is so bs...
---
The only deck i can actually craft is this one but i'm not really a mage player but i guess for any proper season chest i gotta throw the fun-aspect completely out of the window and spam one deck until i quit anyway.
---

---
Every other budget deck has the free legendary in there except a murloc shaman deck that is completely hit or miss or a rogue deck that is too slow to punish quests.
---
Every stream i see plays the exact same 3-4 decks. No rogue, no wl, once in a blue moon a mage or hunter and the rest is always the same 30cards played by dudu, priest and sometimes warrior/pala. Replacements are just crazy rng-gameturners like shadderwock or box. MCT is fun but so heavily rng..
---
Ice Block
---
Play the game.

Meanwhile Flamewanker basically carried a whole archetype.
---
Polnareffu
---
It's actually a weird homebrew singleton Shirvallah OTK. Without Call to Arms now, obviously haha
---
Exactly. Tempo Mage was Tier 1 or 2 deck, but fell of the face of the planet once flamewar rotated iirc
---
Zedipus #2657 I show you, go first
---
EDIT: EU
---
Pretty sure C'thun warrior is still seeing fringe play in wild to this day, especially with all the taunt support lately.
---
This is more of a r/mildlyinteresting post.
---
The lack of Open the Waygate and Arcane Giants as a finisher are the 2 reasons a Cyclone Mage deck isnt in standard now. Flamewaker is good, but lacking the 2nd turn of pure face burn + 16 to face from the giants holds it back.
---
We’ve literally had cyclone mage... a deck that relies on cycling small spells and even then the frog didn’t see play.
---
Looks good, but not good enough for this tavern brawl... mill rogue, snip-snap warlock and OTK Druid beat this deck around turn 3
---
&gt;victim blaming
---
The frog has never dominated anything lol
---
Might be true. Personally, I will want to try a build with standard quest that can use that to switch to a slower, grindier Playstyle. Maybe that will be the opportunity for my girl Kirin Tor Tricaster to see some play, turning your cheap spells into stronger ones later on. Or maybe CC + Mountain Giants gets there. Though I agree, the Vargoth + Waygate + Giants push is really important.
---
Do you know that he is a victim?
---
The obvious takeaway is that Blizzard needs to get their shit together and not your stupid victim blaming.
---
The frog didn't see play in cyclone mage because you didn't really care about the board as long as you didn't die (the majority of the damage came from spells). The frog is decent (not great) in quest mage though, since you care about living long enough to get the quest off and it can clear out a few minions turn 3 and 4 when combined with low mana spells without damage you would be playing anyway (magic trick, ray of frost etc).
---
Yeah, dominate was probably too strong a word, but it can deal 4-5 damage consistently in turns 3-4 which is enough to clear one or two minions on it's own.
---
I played as Elise first and just tried to make the fight go as long as I possibly could. Never went face, just cleared the board and let the boss fatigue into phase two. I eventually succumbed to fatigue as well against the second phase.
---
I picked Reno second, and did the exact same thing by just dragging the fight out as long as possible. I eventually drew the Gatling Wand which was up to 230 or so damage by that point and won with that.
---
Aiight, but only one &gt;:T
---
Never disenchant a legendary, no matter how much it sucks, it can become godlike in the future (Cenarius in Quest Druid) or, if you plan on buying more of whatever packs the legendary belongs to, you have the risk of getting it again, essentially losing a legendary in exchange for 400 dust.
---
ITT: a lot of people that never played when Flamewanker was one of the most hated cards in the game.
---
Yeah for sure. I'll put it this way. I think I can count on one hand the amount of times I've seen it played since it was printed. Idk how long you've played but Flamewaker has carried multiple archetypes, on its own, for years.
---
Hide your dogs

This clip was removed already. Sheesh. You wonder if it’s getting to them or what?

Oh you will be surprised to know, that the vast majority of HS players are rank 15 or worse. People are that bad (applies in general for everything in the world).

I feel like the flintlock should be like a 4/1 weapon, being a flintlock and all

“Finish him!”
---
A lot of the plague lords have multiple \[\[Plague of Death\]\] cards. It's super unfun...
---
Yeah, but why would you need other 2-mana minions? You have a bunch of low-mana spells instead.
---
Show me popular lists that ran more than Apprentices, Cyclone or Khadgar anyway?
---
So your argument is rather fallacious, because you DON'T need other two drops. It's not an either/or argument, you're not running Frog NO MATTER WHAT.
