Does it need to be new to the blitzchung situation to be posted here? It‚Äôs still new and relevant in the context of blizzards recent behavior.
---
---
---
It'd help if they were just up-front about the situation.  Did you read their statement (the Brack one, not the Weibo one)?  It was anything but an actual response to the problem.  Basically the crisis form of the familiar "we hear you, we're looking into it", but written in stilted, awkward English instead of the normal conversational tone.
---

---
I really don't appreciate being lied to.  Saying "China had nothing to do with it" on the one hand, and "we will protect the dignity of China" on the other, does not add up.
---
We already knew after we read 'their', so no need to clarify that.
---
OP says he doesn't believe Blizzard and that's literally the entirety of the post. After a week of posts like this, we're not going to continue rewarding this circlejerk with front-page exposure.
---
The NBA aspect is irrelevant to Hearthstone/Blizzard and doesn't constitute anything "new"
---
If you want to discuss the Blitzchung situation, you are absolutely welcome to do so, but we are going to demand just a bit of effort goes into the actual threads. Currently, this is but another repost of a repost.
---
Im glad you've decided to cut out tje middleman and give your money straight to china
---
Yeah, best we just forget about Hong Kong. So annoying to hear about it when I only just heard about it yesterday.
---
I'd argue that the Adam Silver situation is still relevant and new. He said this 3 hours ago. It's pretty clear proof that China is asking for punishments and bannings. 
---
Blizzard said that China had no influence, but it's clear that China is pushing its weight around in the situations that call for it. This merits discussion.
---
He is speaking the language of the gods
---
Very cool :D
---
Why did it take blizzard 7 days to ban them but only 7 minutes to ban blitzchung?
---
oof
---
Not chat issues for me, but it wouldn‚Äôt update to latest hs version. Had to uninstall/reinstall multiple times before it would take on iPad.

Give a minion +1/+1, return a minion to the owner's hand or discover  a minion.

Eh I'm still not paying, too busy at work and playing ff14 to post on reddit all the time. Been playing wow and blizzard games since before BC and now it just feels dirty.
---
I mean just look at what happened to the main reddit page, this subreddit and blizzard went from top to no where to be seen. Something tells me some twitter-ish bull is happening in terms of manipulation.
---
[Answer: No.](https://i.imgur.com/0GQ8lyV.jpg)
---
I think people were scared of Tempo Mage being back but that deck always relied on Mana Wyrm as a 1 drop, not Flamewaker.
---
The cyclone OTK version is just silly, people need to start looking for tempo oriented solutions to Mage instead of dank memes. But maybe the card support just isn't there at the moment.
---
At the time, I think like 15ish
---
~~That's going to be 1/number of Mage spells in arena^3. As the arena expansions are in constant flux, I honestly don't know which sets are en vogue at the moment.~~

---
1/1 Heal 3. It is unlikely they'll introduce another lackey that encourages aggro.
---
Not personally, but there's streams on twitchtv playing it that you can watch.
---
One of them was Ancient Mysteries, which is not a reborn card, and you get 3 gold cards and a pack, and that was for last week and this week.

I'm pretty sure you can easily crawl a marathon in this time, while playing Tavern Brawl.

What else could a "Day X, Don't Forget What Blizzard Did" be?  No new information is coming out of Blizzard, we have nothing new to discuss.
---
The OP is literally asking why he doesn't see the same protests posts coming up.  The answer is not "because they moved on", it is "because reposts are not allowed".  They were for a few days as we got the same "Day X, Don't Forget What Blizzard Did" again and again.  Then they started to get removed by the mods.
---
While I agree that the China fiasco is deeply disappointing I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to blame the dev team for failing us on that one, as they hold no decision making power on that front
---
Chill, a lot of streamers are sponsored / invited to play the new LoL cardgame beta. They'll be back, at least until next year. If anything, if just 10% of that Legends audience starts showing an interest in HS, it would be a significant increase.
---
I feel the same way.
---
I've played almost daily since 2014. At first I thought I would be alright by just not putting any more money into it and continuing to play. I felt it's not nice to punish the many people who made this game so beloved and had no control over the controversial situation - but everyone internally and externally can and should make some sort of stand for their values.
---
If your values involve something as fundamental as 'lying is wrong', you cannot align yourself people or organisations that lie to you.
---
Even if Blizzard ultimately stands to make money from an emerging Asian market, they've lost the respect of the core that put them as high as they are. Very few people can say they 'love' Blizzard as much as they did 12 months ago.
---
Not if you Q enough animations *wink* *wink*

I prob shouldn't have said that :P

First off, thank you very much. I would if I knew how to do so, although I doubt people would waste their time on re-doing a survey.

Can confirm, the game crashes after loading a match (so you skip turn 1 or even 2) or even when you just loading the app.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I‚Äôve seen fat people struggle to use smartphone keyboards, whale fins would probably be even worse.
---
I feel both decks have a lot of removal, draw, card generation (druid less), healing and the possibity of playing big minions.
---
Shaman has a lot of direct damage that can bypass the board and do damage to face, and druid has armor generation and ramp.
---
Both decks have a lot of everything, which in my opinion its not a god thing.
---
Ive seen decks nerfed for less than that
---
PS:Of course, theres going to be a new exansion in less than 2 months, so we must wait to see how it can change the meta.
---
It's funny how this is a valid statement for the new and the old priest quest
---
Tell that to the people in Hong Kong...
---
Lol no
---
I've yet to run into that deck, but at least Rogue has a weakness in that it's terrible at dealing with the opposing board. Evolve Shaman just has everything right now.
---
The class card offering rate has been increased a lot recently
---
Its not neutralstone anymore
---
Deep...
---
Some kind of balance change was made?

Zayle, maybe? You can't craft it, and thus can't disenchantment it.

I've had 7 right when RoS came out, i oppened [[Keeper Staladris]] and made token druid, it was a prerty good deck with constant board

Well...umm...okay.
---
I had it in my base hagatha deck with a 4 mana cost spell that made me pick 1 minion and replace all minions in my adventure deck with it (forgot the name). So I had 23 BFF's in my deck.
---
They're there for md
---
Fair point.
---
Pretty low. Rank 5 is kinda the rank people are pushed to with winstreak bonuses and ranked floors. It doesn't really get competitive until after that, so people just run whatever.
---
Gonna get downvoted because it's illegal to say anything that would imply not everyone is good at the game, but that's how it works.
---
I love the design even if I'm not sure those colors really suit the priest class ü§î
---
CoD is a sixty USD, full price game.
---
Hearthstone is a free-to-play CCG. Plus, competition like MtG Arena feature both booster packs *and* a battle pass, and the CCG nomenclature pretty much requires the use of a booster pack model.
---
Which card/s? Cruz even if you clear the board, they'll just play one of their other 20 nzoths.
---
&gt;Imo Hearthstone 2.0 must happen...
---
Agreed. But with a dust transfer from HS.
---
lol so I can't keep playing what used to be a tier 3 deck just because they put Evolve back into standard? There's always one or two decks that people are going to complain about, no matter what.
---
&gt;Nothing fresh into the game
---
I disagree with this. The meta is better than last year's Baku-stone and the mid season refreshes change things, as well as innovative design like Zeph. Problem is that the freshness costs 10000 dust every month or two to keep up.
---
Is the Highlander version or the Regular version better in your opinion?
---
It's fine... No problem at all... You just have to play around it...
---
There is a decent chance that the last lackey heals (since the other options are card generation and silence). The fact that this will end up often being a better EVIL Miscreant, and that it would synergize with the newly added Lackey (assuming it is the healing one)... That's just way too much value.
---
At 4 cost, with +1/+1, I could see that being a thing, but having it as cheap as 2 mana just give Cleric way too much value.
---
I wish there was more stuff like this on the sub. Anyways, thanks for sharing!
---
Twitch chat has zero impact on anything, 3 people could easily fill up the chat with spam.
---
yeah what a cunt caring about free speech, human rights or corporate sellouts. what a dick I am for saying people should be allowed to express their outrage at the actions of a company regarding esports on that companies esports stream
---
Yep.  You are the cunt.
---
Wasn't hard to spot
---
Yeah I actually understand and agree with you, I just typed it like that because that's just how people on this sub considered the statement.
---
And what it has to do with Heartstone?
---
i had a 9 match winstreak last season with quest shaman which ended taking me to legend and i stopped playing ranked for that season
---
Yes, I think we definitely can.
---
Literally only focusing on the part where you got triggered about someone saying children's card game
---
yeah but it's not 3 people, it's lots of people, and they want to express something.
---
It was how severe the punishments were that was so bad I think.
---
Maybe the difference is simply those first year(s). I did buy each single player adventure because it cost WAY too much gold to unlock and the price was cheap comparatively. It was the best way to spend money for sure. Since I was getting the adventures "free", all my gold (which would be about a full year's worth of gold as opposed to 4 months) was poured into expansions like GvG, so I probably got a healthy amount of duplicates there that you wouldn't have. At the same time, quests rewarded less gold and there were no events between expansions (like rag double gold) that gave extra resources. Oh! There was also the quest reroll glitch at 2am where you could always upgrade your daily quest too (and get the 100g Total Dominance every 4 days). 
---
I did just recently get every legendary in classic (thanks tavern brawl), still missing a few epics (especially recently nerfed epics like BGH).
---
That's a very economically naive perspective. Blizzard have to bend a knee to get the Chinese market, *of course* it's a fucking business decision. People are protesting because Blizzard chose to make profit over the rights of human beings in the public light, and people are losing their collective shit for it.
---
Nobody is saying it wasn't a business decision, it just so happens that the business decision they made is supporting a horrible regime that kills, tortures, harvests people, and they're unapologetic about charging full force into China's arms to fluff their bottom line.
---
"Profit over the people" is a very common perspective now, and people are like "well, yeah. Of course they'd do that, it makes them money" ignoring the fact that compromising a certain set of public values is horrific and *should* get you lambasted. Blizzard is having a PR nightmare rn, and Twitch chat and continuing the fuel the fire so they can see damage at BlizzCon, the first place where damage tolls can actually be taken.
---
Almost certain that's not an actual law but a teacher or school policy. I was friends with some of my high school teachers on Facebook at the time but some said they wouldn't accept until after I graduated.
---
Free hk!!
---
It wasn't. No one's saying Blizzard is right. But that doesn't mean we can't be somewhat fair.
---
I didn't comment on those, did I ??
---
Banning him from the tournament and a few months is appropriate IMHO. Banning for a year was too much, taking away his earned prize money was ridiculous too.
---
Did anyone even try typing these things in their chat before?
---
It isnt really protest though.
---
It is twitch trolls latching onto the current meme.  for every one person voicing their beliefs, you have 10 trolls parroting it.
---
Yeah, ever since elementary they always preached that any contact on social media (MySpace at the time) is prohibited. It was weird seeing as social media was a pretty new concept at the time. Its whatever though, thanks for clearing up!
---
I didn't get "triggered" I got irritated. irritated is a perfectly reasonable response to someone resorting to demeaning the game as an attempt to take away from the actually kind of serious nature of the subject matter
---
Hey maybe I'm wrong and it is a law in other states! But either way that makes sense.
---
casters deserve the ban more than the boy others are theories so..
---
/r/Gamingcirclejerk
---
It's not like when it was initially Standard legal, it wasn't format warping or anything.
---
what? they laughed, that's all they did. they weren't the producers, they weren't in control of the broadcast, they were just faces on the screen, and because their reaction was sympathetic they got hit with the ban. what possible reason could you have for them deserving the ban?
---
Live chat is all about repetitive phrases and only 5% of the time about the game/what's actually going on.
---
RIP JOE ROGAN
---
What the else are they going to do besides express discontent? Go over to Hong Kong?
---
Something is better than nothing.
---
Ever heard of Emmett Till? A 14 year old boy who was lynched for "offending" a white women, and despite admitting to doing it, the people who did it got no jail time. You're damn right I want to erode the ability for people to use their voices to incite a crime like that to happen again.
---
It is simple, as soon as you will make it spam and be annoying, they will make it ban too.
---
Good. So basically they're censoring spam.
---
It's not *a children's game*, stop acting like a teen douche trying to be cool.
---
Wow that's really cool
---
Reddit's triggered no matter what happens
---
LOL if you think that Hong Kong spam wouldn‚Äôt get filtered out of League if shit hit the fan you are just flat wrong.  League has simply been lucky they haven‚Äôt had anyone cause an international incident over Hong Kong yet.  It‚Äôs 100% owned by China.
---
Since Blizzard is pro free speech ofc. we just all signed a contract that prohibited us from speaking on certain topics, right?
---
Because if not, it would have to mean that Blizzard is full of shit and a supporter of genocidal government.
---
What did you do?
---
How is punishing someone for speaking their mind about something that relates to them financially not logical?  If Blitzchung yelled out: "I believe in diversity!", do you think he would have received the same punishment as he did?  I don't think so in my opinion.  But because it had something to do with a country they are trying to get their two mobile games approved to be sold in, they capitalized and made an example of him in fear of losing that opportunity.  On top of that, they didn't apologize, stuck to the ban AND punished Americans for doing the same!
---
I'd say that I applied a little logic to the point I was trying to make.
---
Do blizzard want all their games boycotted?
---
Post a about reddit post about not allowing free hong knog in twitch chat
---
I wonder if they're going to stop fucking up lol.
---
Probably.. but I mean if 100% people are spamming "I love China", I doubt Blizzard will ban any single one of them.
---
best. Friend. FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I'm gonna die when these buddies continue to show up in my tavern brawl decks for the next year or so. WOOT!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(Yes, I know it probably won't work like that. I can dream though.)
---
That\`s just stupid. They'll just find different ways to spell it...
---
Can I say pro Gay stuff? That's political. If so it's not for keeping politics out.
---
Free Kong hong?
---
Except HK spam happens all the time in league chat, and nobody is getting banned.
---
It's a random statement, while the "free Hongkong" stuff is a currently controverse topic with Blizzard involved. That's a difference you willingly ignore because it's fitting your point. 
---
I mean, sure, technically it would be the right thing to punish that statement aswell, and I'm quite sure, that if a mod catches you, you'll get a warning or a ban, however, ignoring differences between topics doesn't help. 
---
Would you have said a word about China before this shit started? No, you wouldn't have. So why start now? Because it's popular? Because it's the easy side to pick, since everyone will agree with you on that? Big applause, you take a stance that requires no thinking, and since you're already on a high horse, you can tell everyone who disagrees with you in the slightest, that they support what's going on there. Good fucking job.
---
You also got timed out for all caps.
---
The stock hasn't dropped because the market is only indicative of the collective shareholders confidence in a company. If they don't believe this will have any impact on the bottom line they're not incentivized to sell on masse and drop the price of the stock. Things may change next quarterly report though *if* their numbers are down *and* shareholders decide to pin it on backlash from what happened but that's a big if.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs like saying you boycott the NFL but you still watch the games. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
if the company responsible for the tournament existing in the first place is actively participating in global politics, then the game/tournament is a legitimate place to discuss said politics. if they don't want politics discussed in this community, then they should avoid bringing politics into the community in the first place. it seems really hypocritical to me.
---
I get what you're saying, but why not expect corporations to do the right thing?  There are some out there that actually do that.  I don't like to paint all of them with the same brush (even though it may seem that they all have the same greedy intentions) because I believe that there some out there that wouldn't do this.  They ALL can't be like this.
---
Also, I don't have any statistics or proof saying otherwise, haha!
---
At least you are honest about your motivation.
---
Nope, just regular users like me. 
---
It's a thankless job, so thanks for noticing.
---
You gotta put some kind of special twist on it. Prime number cost cards only (2, 3, 5, 7)? Then SMOrc him with Shaman since you‚Äôll still have Bloodlust and Underbelly Angler.
---
Yea because nothing has gotten headlines with league and China yet.  Try having one of the players say ‚Äúliberate Hong Kong‚Äù in the middle of a broadcast and see how Riot responds.
---
how can something be an issue of human rights and not be political at the same time? if human rights don't qualify as politics, what does?
---
Bet they would.

chance of flame lance, cabalist's tome, firelands portal is actually (1/32)\^3 \* 3! (since you can get lance, tome, portal or tome, lance, portal, or any of the 6 orderings, each of which has equal chance of happening). What mctuking is suggesting is correct, because you can get the cards in a different order it is actually 6 times as likely to get a given set of 3 different cards as it is for you to get the same card 3 times.
---
His comment was practically disagreeing with facts. You can't disagree with facts. Well, you can, but it'd make zero sense and you'd come off as an ass hole and uninformed. Just like guy over here.
---
That's like you telling me 2+2 equals 4 and me saying "yknow I see your point but I disagree". It sounds stupid and it makes no sense. Just like guy.
---
If there's something else you immediately want (since a DE legendary is a free epic) then maybe but I also rarely dust legendaries for two reasons:
---
* You're likely to pull the other card or get enough dust from duplicates if you're patient enough
---
* Dusting it means you could pull it again on your next Uldum legendary versus one that's more useful
---
Are you guys retarded or what?
---
Yea, what ridiculous mods. That was obviously an on topic comment and definitely not an attempt to reference ongoing political issues.
---
China doesn't have freedom of speech and are culturally against it. If this is the first time in 35 years you've seen a company pursue greed and money over morals then I need to live where you are.
---
&gt;Yes. Blizzard is in control of their own communication. You even said "Blizzard created". Not a tourney winner shouting "keep the internet free, revolution of our time"
---
Which is what people are upset about.  Them involving themselves in politics when it suits them and screaming "no politics" when it doesn't is why people are saying "Fuck Blizzard."
---
No one likes hypocrisy.  Especially when that hypocrisy involves shielding a brutal regime from criticism.
---
None at all, other than the fact that no one is paying them to be on the opposite side of progress for all the other things that I mentioned.
---
Whereas the Chinese government very much *is* paying them (with access to the Chinese mobile games market) to take a stance against the protests in Hong Kong.
---
Quest Druid is tier 3, if you wanna touch a quest look at shaman, IMO both quest are just fine how they are, Druid get destroyed bu Aggro decks, looses to control, it‚Äôs a good midrange deck and has its counters.
---
Honestly, what does Hearthstone have to do the murdering in HK? Think hard before answering.

These idiots entered a PR nightmare by just focusing everyone's attention on their censoring. If they had just done nothing, no one would talk about it and would have moved on quickly.
---
Still doesn't make it right though, regardless of how that country operates.

Yeti#21265 EU looking to trade 80g quest you go first but i can proof i got the quest. will remove post when i found partner.

Didn't read lol

In this case I got Robes of Gaudiness right off the bat and packed my deck with massive minions (Lich King, Ysera, three Tirion Fordring, and lots more) and just crushed most of the run. Unfortunately, heroic Khadgar filled his board early with the elemental copycats and just blasted everything I put on the board. I really needed a board wipe. This time I'm trying a mage run and taking every board clear I can.
---
I wouldn't be sure about that for two reasons. First, the current event will end at some point, and the Shaman decks returning to normal changes things a lot. Don't forget where the deck was before this. 
---
Second, [according to VS](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-144/): 
---
&gt;Wait, is Quest Druid Tier 3? Really? Well, the data is telling a lie here. The reason why Quest Druid‚Äôs win rate is so low is thanks to the Malygos variant‚Äôs popularity. It‚Äôs just bad, and Emperor Thaurissan hasn‚Äôt made a worthwhile impact to change things. We‚Äôve looked at the Nomi build, which is far less popular, and we can confidently say that it‚Äôs far, far better than what the numbers show for the archetype at the moment. The player base just needs to drop Malygos and go back to Nomi, or even try the Baleful Banker build, which also shows some promise. We estimate that the difference in ladder win rate between Malygos and Nomi is around 3%, which is massive. It‚Äôs the difference between lingering at Tier 3 and dominating at Tier 1.
---
Even though there are disadvantages, the mana reduction is so massive on the big drops it feels like it should be an instant win for that run
---
How does that justify taking away his price money? Why is speaking up for human rights even considered a political issue. If he said "No to racism" would you also consider that political? If he said he supported Blizzard in their "Pro-LGBTQ+" stance would that be political?
---
You beautiful shitlord!!!
---
+1
---
Blizzard censors a lot of stuff in their official channels, like the TriHard emote after the whole TerranceM thing, etc.
---
Political by definition requires a Government as reference so general human rights and ethics are not at all political.
---
And artifact at the bottom
---
I disagree. LGBTQ+ is a human right issue because it's not widely accepted in the world and Blizzard is showing their support for that very human right through their game and Pride Week.  Some countries, it's against the law.  I would say that is a political and human rights issue.
---
Legends of RT is just another Artifact clone that will be dead within the month.

#Ban Blizzard 2020
---
I don't mean to be that guy but surely as a mainly rogue player you may have a bias towards this particular deck?
---
Climate change as a scientific idea or as facts is not political. Policy points based on climate change is political.
---
What if he's literally Winnie the Pooh?
---
I think it gets harder to hit legend with less players.
---
So just block such messages instead of banning them.
---
Omg I don't fucking care.
---
Turn down for what!
---
You know damn well this wasn't done in good faith.
---
imagine paying people to go protest for you LUL
---
A sad day for actual Winnie the Pooh lovers.
---
Same here dude, people just love to be outraged over nothing at any chance. The moment you don't agree with or believe in their ideology your the enemy and are &lt;insert the many names they have handy&gt;. Welcome to 2019, the outrage culture.
---
I don't think "some things are more important than money" comes up often in multinational corporation's board meetings.
---
Lets say Blizzard pulls out of China because of the boycott, that wouldn't be because they changed their political views and are pro HK now, it would be because they calculated they could make more money in the western market than in China. Even Blizzard having gay characters isn't because the corporation is super pro gay, its because they thought they could expand their reach in certain markets with that. Notice how the LGBTQ stuff is dropped in areas where its controversial. Companies exist to make money and business decisions are made to maximize profit and minimize risk.
---
Gamers are so oppressed, can we please rise up against China? üòû
---
Oh, Riot Games released an update to League, awesome!
---
Usually its 100% of all commons and 98-100% of rares. I generally build the decks that I have opened the legendaries/epics for, sometimes I have the full deck sometimes I need to craft an epic or two. If I am missing more than 2 legendaries I don't craft the deck generally. If a legendary is super good and important and I believe it will be vital going forward in standard or will be a staple in Wild I mind end up crafting it. Same with neutrals, neutrals that every class wants for some decks like Ziliax or Zephrys I wouldn't mind crafting either. Usually there is about 2500-3000 dust in the 100 packs and I always get a lot from Hall of Fame or Nerf patches, so I always have some dust floating around that i don't have to actively disenchant something for.
---
Fuck off
---
Treeants and tri-class cards.
---
I'm sad because I really like winnie the pooh and make references to it alot, mostly quoting narration and such, but i hope i dont offend any dictators
---
What a MINION
---
It's about the far reaching implications of an action. I'll firstly say this is on another level from what Bethesda or EA did. That said, If Fallout 76 or whatever did sell well and no face was lost, then that means we could expect any sort of quality control to just go out the window. And when one company has shitty monetization schemes, then others tend to follow the leader, thinking they can use the same techniques to make a lot money. These are things that makes sense to complain about. 
---
In Hearthstones case, the severity of the punishment and the statement made immediately after, makes it clear this issue was about China not being anti-politics of any kind. And you have to ask if advocating for human rights should be considered controversial enough to censor at all. That aside this really brought to light to a lot of people, the extent to which China is controlling foreign media, and corporations in general.
---
Ah yes the infinite kun version of the deck. Might as well go miracle style, draw the entire deck by turn 9, then infinite kuns until your opponent concedes
---
It's funny watching people defend them.
---
The more  they try to block this out, the more they're going to get Streisand Effect'd.
---
When the original quest rogue was a thing I said that Scalehide should have been nerfed for the same reasons. It was breaking class identity and making some resource (life) not matter. It also jumped the deck to tier one overnight. 
---
And plenty of people just complained about the rogue quest to the point it was nerfed effectively three times. But that was because it led to polarization; not because the design itself resulted in unusual consistency or broke class identity 
---
‚ÄúNot breaking the game‚Äù doesn‚Äôt equal ‚Äúwell designed‚Äù
---
Nope, I got a Kun from Worthy Expedition and then Elise'd my hand with Floop and the Kun that was in my deck haha
---
and the naga siren bartender greets the murloc: My boy

tartar0 #1829 NA trade  80g

This would be fun... but I dont' think Lazul will get Lackeys. I think they'll find a way to get Lackeys to the hero classes. I could see the three Gadgetzan crime bosses filling in three of those four remaining classes that need lackeys yet, but I've got no clue who the fourth would be.
---
*sets Activision offices on fire so commons dust for 10 instead of 5*
---
i'd be sympathetic to the "design" argument except the "changes" are all massive nerfs, which would make the quest near absolute trash. and again makes it reek of someone being tilted over a bad matchup. 
---
i dont even think it breaks class design.druid has been the most mana centric class, and having a quest revolve around that fits. its a trade off for having 4/5 low tempo turns and then bursts of powers. which is similar to how most non token druid decks have been played.
---
and you say its not about power, but then go on to cite VS but how powerful it could become. even itf it was a teir one deck, that initself is not evidence of needing mjor desin changes or nerfs,
---
...maybe Team 5 should've given us back Devolve instead of Evolve.
---
Gaming is in the sweet spot of being an official thing like sports and just a random low key past time.  Hence the confusion and rage.
---
This whole ‚Äúgovernment as reference‚Äù idea needs a few pages of defining itself.  I mean if I say ‚Äúthe people living at [geographical coordinates pointing at Hong Kong] should have human rights‚Äù, this is an obviously political statement, but I‚Äôm clearly not explicitly referencing any government at all.  
---
If you open the door for ‚Äúimplicit references to government‚Äù, claiming that I‚Äôm *implicitly* referencing China‚Äôs government, then it seems like the statement ‚Äúpeople should be granted human rights‚Äù implicitly references every government, even though it‚Äôs clearly a statement about human rights and ethics.
---
This is aside from the whole difficulty of the conception of human rights to begin with.  It‚Äôs pretty easy to argue that the only conception of ‚Äúrights‚Äù that is coherent is one that says something like ‚Äúrights are the protections and guarantees a government makes to each of its citizens‚Äù (my wording here is shit, but you get my point - the definition references a hypothetical government and relies on this reference).  
---
I mean, isn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúaccess to clean water is a human right‚Äù just saying something like ‚Äúgovernments ought to do everything they can to give their citizens clean water‚Äù?  How is this not a reference to a hypothetical government?  If I say ‚Äúgovernments shouldn‚Äôt harvest organs from ethnic minorities‚Äù is that still not political, even though you and I and everyone else knows that I‚Äôm implicitly referencing a specific government?
---
My point is that this is EXTREMELY messy, and there‚Äôs an enormous amount of grey area that you‚Äôre just brushing over.  Your post implying that saying that ‚Äúx is a human right‚Äù or (as example of a clear ethical statement) ‚Äúpeople shouldn‚Äôt enslave other people‚Äù isn‚Äôt often implicitly referencing a government seems really dubious to me.
---
Not a very good Rogue main then. A deck with so many tools to keep someone off the board should definitely be favoured.
---
perhaps make it so you have to have extra leftover mana but not a full mana bar? the deck still would just use hero power from turn 3 on but it would stall the quest by a turn or 2
---
&gt;using the image of the LGBTQ+ community to make extra money,
---
I'm not sure why this wasn't clear from the beginning.
---
funny enough I'd say the one that does is warrior, and that one is so obviously the worst it's actually insulting
---
I started to think you didn't know what you were talking about when you said "The only real way to alter that is to go first and draw Innervate to accelerate by on turn (or be a bad player and spend your mana)", then you confirmed my suspicion when you said "Oasis Surger is never either a 5/5 with Rush or two 3/3s with Rush. That card has never been played in the deck. Instead, it's a different card that happens to be two 5/5s with Rush for 5 mana."
---
Both of these statements are objectively incorrect and lead me to believe that you've never actually played the deck, or that you are incredibly bad at piloting it. Against aggressive match ups it can be correct to spend all your mana in a turn to not be overwhelmed, and oasis surger can be a very effective removal option before quest completion for the same purpose. I stopped reading at that point because unless this entire post is meant to be facetious, you've proven that your opinions on this subject are uninformed and irrelevant.
---
Did he stutter?
---
I think it's so funny how the deck was so good when it was around and is still just as strong upon coming back. this really speaks to the strength of avenge and mysterious challenger, but perhaps even more to the Dr 1,2,3,4,5... strategy it was famous for: the deck just replaced rotated cards with new stuff in each number slot.
---
Pro Overwatch player Profit was fined $1000 for flipping the bird. He was joking with his team in the dugout between rounds, and his playercam just happened to be shown on stream at that exact moment.
---
Here's perhaps a better comparison: the heaviest punishment that has been given to a pro Overwatch player was a roughly four-month suspension, given to Sado for running an entire account boosting operation. I think that really illustrates how ridiculous even the reduced punishment given to Blitzchung actually is.
---
By "people" I didn't mean you.  Obviously what you do doesn't matter.  I meant Blizzard should be taking a stand.
---
&gt;People aren't upset about that, people are upset that Blizzard hasn't made a position (or rather hasn't made the free Hong Kong position).
---
I certainly think there's room to be mad at them for supporting China's oppression AND for them being hypocrites.
---
&gt;You're whole point doesn't make much sense anyways, Blizzard 100% have the complete right to involve themselves into politics, other people 100% do not have the right to involve Blizzard into their own politics. Those same people 100% have the right to be mad at a company for not supporting their beliefs. It's as simple as that.
---
I don't think anyone is saying Blizzard doesn't have the right to act like dickbags or that people shouldn't be mad at them for being dickbags.
---
Its a rhetorical question.
---
nope they are not, but it would be nice if they did.
---
In this political climate I find this pretty amazing, and pretty damning for Blizzard. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when Bobby got the letter.
---
I totally pulled this design idea out of my ass while reading your post, so I have no real idea how good it really would be, but [how's this sound?](https://hearthcards.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/d3/b3/cd/de/d3b3cdde.png) ([Hero Power](https://hearthcards.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/0c/e3/a8/f2/0ce3a8f2.png))
---
I picked the quest condition because I thought spending _extra_ mana would be a good way to reward creative mana usage (which mixes well with ramp), but couldn't think of a good way to clearly word it on the card. Spending 4 mana seems like it'd work, as you'd finish the quest turn 6 at the earliest without the assistance of ramp/mana cards (e.g. coin, [[Innervate]], [[Wild Growth]]).
---
As for the power itself, I figured simply doubling the effect of a Choose One choice would do well to keep the actual, y'know, _choosing_, while still giving them a huge power boost as well. That said, while potentially increasing the skill ceiling of the ability, it would probably also noticeably increase its power level in some places (think 5 mana double Starfall and the like), so I think making it cost 1 could level it out well enough.

From what I can tell, they haven't made any statements in support of China's oppression. You are confusing a lack of statements against China as support.
---
&gt;I don't think anyone is saying Blizzard doesn't have the right to act like dickbags or that people shouldn't be mad at them for being dickbags.
---
I have no idea what you mean by that. I was explaining the situation to you.
---
&gt; The things blizzard has done so far are pretty much the things we were advised NOT to do.
---
They really don't have a clue about damage limitation. Once again they need to be told that they need to dig UP, not DOWN.
---
Maybe throw in Hakkar if you have him?
---
Just fucking leave the politics out of their competition and that's it, why do you need to do this? No politics there like no politics in Olympics
---
It could be reworked as: "the first card you play each turn has both choose one options combined" or something like that.
---
Whenever the word "Slammed" is in a headline, you know that nothing happened and nobody did anything except talk. 
---
BTW are people still playing HS? I thought we all deleted our accounts! Dang I guess we all forgot about China in a week...
---
Oh okay. Yeah business care about money.
---
I think you need to read the issues. 5 demands not one less. None call for seperation from China. 
---
Liberate hong Kong revolution of our times is a slogan for the protestors that have the 5 demands. 
---
He was not calling for Hong Kong to be liberated in the sense you are referring. The demands are as follows:
---
Full withdrawal of the extradition bill
---
A commission of inquiry into alleged police brutality
---
Retracting the classification of protesters as ‚Äúrioters‚Äù
---
Amnesty for arrested protesters
---
Dual universal suffrage, meaning for both the Legislative Council and the Chief Executive
---
Rubio is one of the most pro-HK US politicians out there. He was one of the sponsors for the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act in the senate.
---
I'm so close to agreeing with you, but I think the context is extremely important here.  The south is not being denied any human rights that the north has.  I think the only comparable situation would be someone saying "Black people need to fight back against cops murdering our brothers and sisters."  Do I think Blizzard would ban someone for saying something like this?  Maybe, but I still believe that a fine is all you would need for first time offenders.
---
I just faced this 3 games in a row, and came here to check if anyone else has been seeing this...
---
You mean like preventing US companies from selling things to Chinese companies? That's already going on with Huawei and with the export ban to companies involved in the Uyghur genocide like Hikvision.
---
Lol you act like a nob get called on it and then cry lolololololol i can tell youre female off that
---
Unlike Trump's letter they is written with proper grammar!
---
His central argument that isn‚Äôt concerned about power boils down to Druid quest is ‚Äúauto complete‚Äù which  somehow equates to bad design. I disagreed already. Since OP complains about things like 5 mana double rush 5/5s and how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù it is for Druid to complete, he implicitly is also complaining about its power level. 
---
Also all his designs are outright nerfs
---
I know people's hearts are in the right place here, but it's like ever since the first ban was issued the ability to critically think just evaporated off the player base.
---
Blizzard has already allowed people to make political statements at official events long before Blitzchung. See this- https://preview.redd.it/7vtkmn8rh0s31.jpg?width=944&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=838a007f3f2c8bb4789023fc29580bb8f2fc3e06
---
&gt; Considering HK is a part of China 
---
I mean, the British just sort of gave Hong Kong to china. I imagine the people in Alaska wouldn't like being given to Russia all that much.
---
Part of the deal was that Hong Kong would have essentially complete administrative freedom from China, and (of course) China is trying to violate that.
---
Why not take a moment to remind yourself that Twitch is arbitrarily banned in China. So even the people espousing pro-China rhetoric on Twitch or Twitter 
---
Even the idea that people would choose something else over state-controlled media was too much for the government.
---
I understand Twitch wants to avoid spam and it's often a nuisance to see comments that are irrelevant or don't add anything new or nuanced to the discussion by boiling it down to the core idea, but I think that the HK protests are pretty relevant and it's really not everyone's best interests to ignore reality and demand politics be divorced from media.
---
Its literally the same thing. Is acknowledging your existence a political statement? Its a simple yes or no question.
---
MechaC'thun
---
Shoutout to Dane!.
---
Man you're really sticking it to those CS reps
---
fuck off
---
She might. But most other politicians would not. And I seriously doubt Blizzard would punish them with the same severity as the published Blitzchung.
---
Please educate yourself on the 5 demands. None talk about seperation from China. The slogan doesn't mean what you think it means. 
---
5 demands. Not one less.
---
&gt; Faux outrage over nothing and directed at the wrong party in any case. 
---
Uh blizzard **was** the party that punished this player and caster so idk the logic in saying they are the wrong party.
---
Not only that but if i had a dollar the amount of times people blindly call this or any uproar as "faux outrage" purely because they **personally disagree with it** i'd be a rich man.
---
&gt;Wanting to sell products internationally isn't "objectively greedy."
---
No but appeasing a harsh authoritarian government so you don't lose profits from them banning your game sure as fuck is. So that being said, are you ignoring that fact due to ignorance or because it undermines your argument? curious.
---
&gt;"Submitting to a dictatorship"... give me a fucking break. We're in America.
---
Uh, how does "us being in america" change the disturbing trend among american companies submitting to Chinese censorship? 
---
&gt;They had a rule against controversial speech in their esports events. Someone broke it, in a big fucking way, by literally calling for revolution.
---
Funny how **everyone** who doesn't know much about what happens comes to the same ignorant conclusions.
---
Yes a rule was broken and punishment was need but the extent blizzard punished the player AND the casters was clearly brought on due to fear of them getting banned in china which is the core reason for the outrage. Not only that but the rule was **very** open ended and the fact they took his prize money hardly breeds confidence in the game as an e-sport if that was there first reaction to the situation. 
---
&gt; Guess what, if someone said "liberate Catalan, revolt against Spain" in an esports broadcast that person would probably get banned as well.
---
actual argument &gt; random hypothetical that doesn't mean much because there situation in Spain and china is **MASSIVELY** different. 
---
&gt;Because guess what, it's a fucking esports broadcast, not your soapbox for controversial political statements.
---
Ok? Why are you under the assumption that i think he should have relieved no punishment? That's not even a common opinion which shows just how ill informed you are on this topic you have to attack me with assumptions. 
---
&gt;All of the disingenous shit about how Blizzard is "against human rights" or "against free speech" is all just made to fuel this faux outrage.
---
Blizzard censoring their game to appease china's totalitarian regime **IS** going against human rights and free speech no matter how you slice it so idk why you are arguing a fact with an opinion as if you are going to win. 
---
I suggest you get educated on this situation as opposed to justifying your love of the game by undermining the protest which is quite selfish not gonna lie.
---
&gt;Of course I'm talking about the fucking boycott,
---
then why did you **completely** misrepresent it then? 
---
&gt;Honestly, this is just the worst kind of slacktivism by a bunch of entitled gamers who would never actually make a sacrifice of their own
---
Christ when the fuck will this circle jerk die? Why do you people think blindly calling gamers "entitled" means anything? Why is "voting with ones wallet" a sign for entitlement? Are people **not** allowed to have opinions in your mind or just those who game? 
---
&gt;. a bunch of kids who haven't worked in the real world.
---
Strong basis for an argument.
---
"oh the kids are wrong, not me" 
---
&gt;Go ahead, if you work at a company that does business with China, go and tell your boss you refuse to keep working until they stop doing business with an evil dictatorship.
---
wow this is like the third or so example you have **no idea** what this protest is about. my god. 
---
&gt; If he refuses, then you quit. Or maybe it's all just talk and the actual reality of having trade with China is a lot more complicated than that.
---
Ok can you give me an actual response instead of pure belittlement because that really isn't worth a damn thing and i am tried of reading it from people who think it is trendy to go against the grain.
---
I mean, are you surprised?
---

I dont get why the "new" missions dont have any kind of activator. But thats another subject.
---
But talking about Druid, is the only mission where you can complete by doing literally nothing; do nothing during 4 turns and get your quest complete (and of course the reward is automathic).
---
Then, the deck has a lot of everything; highroll, healing, removal, draw, ramp, armor generation, card generation.
---
I know that its not the best deck in the meta, but it can be truly annoying to play versus a deck that never runs out of "ammo" and can save a lot of bad situations because of all the possibilities it has.
---
Yes and that's interesting to me
