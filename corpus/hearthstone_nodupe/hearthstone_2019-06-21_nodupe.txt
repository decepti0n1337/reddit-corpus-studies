I haven't played the game much for a couple of months already, just logging in and doing some quests, getting the 5 ranked wins per month cardback, etc.
---
I have no idea about the meta, so obviously I didn't go for any crafted decks yet and just wait how the meta plays out with the Rise of the Shadows~
---
---
---
Mech Hunter you say, eh? Why not Bomb Hunter? Isn't that deck rated higher?
---
Also what deck list are we talking about ? I only played Mech Hunter recently in Wild, no idea about Standard
---
Nice from 144p to 240p üëç
---
Contary to popular belief, there are quite some people who enjoy mirror matches, me being one of them :)

Well, after watching that poetic masterpiece of a video, I subbed.
---
Even on PC, whenever I access the friends tab while in game, my game can lock up momentarily. Has done that for years. Sorry if that's not helpful or related, but I've had similar experiences.
---
With charge? It‚Äôd be seen in every single deck on ladder
---
This is actually the kind of deck you need to beat Khadgar on heroic imo
---
Was DCed, and barley made it back in time for the hero power win.
---
I don't understand responses like yours. Where did they say they needed to change?
---
Similarly to how a content creator can choose to make and change what they want, an audience is free to express why they do or dont like it. Especially if they mostly or "almost" like it. Just like people voiced their opinions over GoT recently.
---
&gt; The deck does have a rather high skill floor
---
As opposed to what? Looking through the meta I'd hardly describe it as high, not super easy low either but then what decks are?
---
I wish. I keep playing warriors with the legendary that gives all mechs rush and those super OP hero powers
---
Can we talk about how low res this home screen is?
---
Please learn to format your posts.  No one reads walls of text.
---
If I reach rank 1 in this season and for example I end season at rank 3, which rank I will start next season? Rank 5 or rank 7? It depends on my max rank reached or rank that I am at the end of season?
---
I too wish for it to be a viable deck. It seems to have the value gen, healing, clears and removal, but still seems to struggle. What do you think is the issue? (sincere question)
---
that big ass tree taunt with 8/8 stats. No one gets past that shit at rank 24.
---
Rank 5. Max rank is taken in consideration
---
&gt; if they are using a card vs says is bad then it must be good. 
---
Hate to burst your bubble, but if you're relying on pros for stuff like that then you're probably not using it at the right time. for it to be any semblance of good.   And pros make stupid choices all the time, progogue is a fun deck, but not exactly a good one.  Sort of like Raza priest, pros are good with it, but us average players?  Yeah, not so great.
---
Just look at HSreplay stats.  It's in the bottom quarter of the deck in terms of drawn and played winrates.  It's pretty clearly one of the worst cards in the deck, no matter which way you slice it.
---
Not to say it's not FUN.  It's fun to play.  But if you want to win, spirit of the shark is statistically one of the first cards you should find a replacement for.
---
you can play Arena if you like it, just know that until you get better you might be losing gold compared with buying packs
---
He used prep and then coin. Which is a super op combo
---
i think the fact thats its not only possible (and suggested by the gameplay) but very, very easy to do and specific people stand to make gross sums of money by doing it should be reason enough take it seriously.
---
What? I didn't even know this could happen
---
I did not describe variance. And there is no such thing as RNG. these events are manufactured.
---
You may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.

---
RNG is manufactured. 
---
Yes, you did describe variance. You not getting matched up with a deck is variance.
---
Dude, try to get one and decide if you want to go for all three afterwords...
---
You remind me of when Apple had to change their shuffle algorithm because people thought it wasn't truly random because they noticed patterns. In turn they had to make it less random to make it appear more random. 
---
Above is variance because if hearthstone is truly random then there are players who will experience patterns .... including not seeing a particular deck. Especially when you have millions and millions of people playing. 
---
But what you're asking for is less randomness , you want to guarantee seeing a deck every 10 games or so to prove that the game isn't lying about it's randomness. 
---
Bit contradictory if you ask me.
---
EU trade quest, 
---
Talijanic#2757, 
---
I show, you first
---
No, variance means standard deviation squared. Sometimes it's zero.
---
Mage:
---
Mulligan for secret plan, spider bomb, freezing trap and deadly shot. Try to save them for when they start dropping Giants. 
---
Priest: 
---
Go for good tempo and a strong early game. The goal is to finish them before they pull a combo. 
---
Druid:
---
Go for things like animal companion and low cost minions. Try to get venom+missile for board clear. Keep Zillax for lifesteal. 
---
Rogue: 
---
You can kind of let this play out. Have a early game so they don't overwhelm you. 
---
Hunters:
---
If it's the face mech Hunter, good luck. Otherwise you're usually good. 
---
Warrior:
---
Usually an easy matchup. You finish em off early as possible. 
---
Paladin:
---
Good luck. It's the only match up I've got less than 50% against. 
---
Shaman:
---
It can struggle against aggro murlocs, but you'll have no problem with the other decks.
---
Warlock:
---
You won't see this much. The zoo can beat you, but you don't run into it too often.
---
WHY IS THERE NOT MORE UPVOTES
---
yup. it sure is hard to prove. just like the slot machines..
---
They couldn‚Äôt even defend Dalaran
---
I imagine Canadian cost of living is quite a bit cheaper than here so the monthly price might be considered expensive for someone there.
---
There is nothing to prove about slot machines, in US they are government by law. The law dictates the maximum profit casino can make. I don't remember numbers but let's say for every 100$ put into machine it should give out 98$ in winnings. Inside machine is computer, you can exactly set profit margins. Everything from machine/software development to periodical checks of machines in casinos is under government control.
---
I must say, i've seen stranger things 
---
 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
OMFG I seriously started to doubt myself if I really grew a fucking boot 3 years ago. Every single match on this map (?) I tried, but never succeeded again. Thank you.
---
Everybody in the comments are asking for Warrior nerfs. Be careful for what you wish. Control Warrior is a really boring matchup yes but is the last line of defense holding the meta into becoming a full all out hyper-aggro shitshow. If Warrior is nerfed I hope is something minor like removing mech rush from Dr Boom (maybe Omega Devastator to 7 mana?).

---
Ikr lol
---
Well, I am comparing premium plans here not average/budget plans, Canada do have similar plans (comparing local offering vs the roaming features of this plan) for slightly cheaper but the roaming advantages to other cointries is a lot worse.
---
Nice top decking 14 hp
---
Up gonks to the left
---
FYI Sprint is a US mobile ISP. Their post just sucks, worse than their connection.
---
Bruh then how would I get blizzard's attention to nerf this op combo
---
But the old one had +1/+1
---
I had the same issue because I use the blizzard app to chat on my phone.
---
Dont try to clear it, it should go away on its own.
---
As a rogue, Sap is your friend against mechs.  The other thing I do is contest the board a lot more.  So in other matchups I'd maybe leave some of the opponents minions and save things like Eviscerate.  Against mechs i'm much more aggressive in terms of keeping them off the board.
---
Omg you're right I'm so sorry. I think he instantly got to legend after this amazing play even with the concede. Blizz plz nerf
---
He is clearly Bartendotron. How rude of you, you have hurt his metal feelings!
---
You might be able to trigger the enrage phase tho, if you're lucky
---
I remember when secrets could trigger on your own turn! Ah, the [[Eye for an Eye]] lethals...

Done! Loving it so far. Also fun to trigger Deathrattles, 2 damage to face is &lt;3333

I also got Bob to put her in my starting hand for each run. I don't think there is a way I could have lost a game, other than a silence. Even then, I had Spirits of the Dead to make certain.
---
Link it!!!
---
Do you own 2 copies of Gonk?
---
I'm running that version but this seems a little more even to me, I rarely get great value out of the second tundra rhino. I don't have Zul'jin but I do have that big 9-cost charge Dino legendary that I might put in there instead? Or maybe a second Unleash might work instead? What do you think?
---
Cuz autocomplete doesn‚Äôt work in wild
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
If you have the spell prepped and you have to do nothing else as an action/bonus action then yes, that's crazy, but for that one minute you're powerful and for the rest of the time beforehand you have one or more useless spells prepped and afterwards are completely screwed in all rolls. Not worth it imo.
---
Uh. First, welcome to warrior.
---
Second, you‚Äôre just wrong. Jade lady, ragnaros summoner guy, beast cards, mech cards, finja, all murlocs, quests...that‚Äôs just thirty seconds off the top of my head.
---
Stop whining. Seriously.
---
Totally normal to expect a person with "firetree" in their name would have those in their spellbook.
---
He preparation-&gt;coin 
---
It honestly is such a meta defining combo and is incredibly frustrating to play against. I wonder why blizzard didn't nerf it yet
---
Ye I decided against it already
---
I miss Razormaw üòî
---
I DONT KNOW WHICH ONE TO SHOOT
---
Take out Ysera because you might resurect the 3/5 and the 7/6 instead of 8/8 and 10/10.
---
Catrina is really op in this deck, i think that she must be included
---
The problem being that it's powerful for 1 fight, but even the fastest-paced DnD games really only have about 1 long rest per session. You're basically useless for 3 sessions afterwards, so you're screwed for every non-boss fight anyway.
---
  
---
I'd rather die to a mindflayer without the firepower this provides than a group of goblins with its downside.
---
Bojler elad√≥!
---
If you included zaylethe or whizbang as one of the legendaries it will do this as they can be the only cards in a deck.
---
Um...
---
F2P don't have access to 60+ rated cards, didn't you read the user agreement when downloading the game?
---
This happens whenever I reconnect. I've had up to 4 copies in there before.
---
I think you need another tier honestly. Should be great, then good, then okay, then meh. For example Shaku was definitely better than just okay during his time in standard, but I wouldn‚Äôt call him great. Same for Darius Crowley.
---
I hope they add these to the shop so we can use them in PvP. The characters are fully voiced and everything.
---
The one with money
---
It happens to me whenever I reconnect the friends get doubled
---
Enjoyed looking over this, thank you.  
---
I think you're giving Arch-Villain Rafaam way too much credit.  He's a bad card in a weak deck right now.
---
I probably underrated him compared to his broken old self, but it's funny you mention him as I had the idea of this list after thinking of how Patches could be rated nowadays.
---
Still, I don't think I'd put him above "good/great" at this point, certainly not compared to the others in the same category.
---
Though, again, this is mostly personal opinion, so you have the right to disagree :)
---
Anyone who plays a physical card game long enough will start to notice patterns even in the random results.  It's just how the brain is wired.
---
You jest, but I actually considered putting both G O N K and Whizbang in the "top-tier" category.
---
Just instantly turns your whole deck into Barnes.
---
[Solem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puWjn7P-WZ0&amp;t=441s) made a tier list of all legendary in Hearthstone in a 30-minute video and pretty interesting. He's a full-time wild player so I think he has good knowledge about all legendaries in Hearthstone since the beginning.
---
this is awesome, what cards would you add should you not want to make the deck f2p? I am f2p but I have more cards than the bare minimum.
---
Def Lich King.  When you just keep summoning / resurrecting him you get great card generation from him.  Some of those DK spells are game changers.  Catrina Muerte is probably #2.  After that I'd say the real choice is between Ragnaros and Ysera.  Ysera and LK kind of scratch the same itch, so I'd think about dumping Ysera.
---
Yes, 'matchmaking always favor my opponent' st tement is completely true obviously. But if everyone is unfavored by the matchmaking algorithm then so should be my opponent. So which one of us is unfavored really?

Well what midrange Warrior deck you talking about lol. You can hardly call Boom Warrior midrange deck because its units is not strong in midrange standard , only a way to abuse Boom mechanics.
---
In the whole history of HS, midrange warrior is as popular as aggro priest or control hunter mate. The only good midrange Warrior is during the Old God period , called Dragon Warrior. Thats 1 deck in 5 years folks.
---
Alright, thanks for answering! I'll take a look today and see what I can find. Cheers!
---
Wow talk about low effort call content.
---
'Shark' threw me off on Genzo. Thought he was Rasthakan.
---
Harrison is absolutely core. One of the best cards in Control Warrior. Just check the stats if you don't believe me. Weapon's Project  + HJ is the Warrior equivalent of Mountain Giant + CC.
---
Secret Hunter is off-meta atm.
---
Agreed on Alakir then.
---
Even better: have a seance on her so she copies herself to your hand every time you play her.
---
It's definitely not too late. After the December expansion you'll want to be a bit more cautious about what you craft.
---
Same. 2 days ago I'm pretty sure I picked him up and put him down about 8 times to try to figure out wtf he says rather than just googling it like a sane person. Glad the answer has just fallen into my lap.
---
More ideas (all terrible, but I'm inspired now lol):
---
Freeze a character
---
Draw a card
---
Give adjacent minions taunt
---
Give a minion Divine shield
---
Give a minion +2 health
---
Love this guy, got him recommended by YouTube a while back, good short videos

It would definitely see play. It's a better Seaforium and some decks do run her. +1 attack, mech tag, and plus 5 damage to the bomb is insane. Losing two 1/1 boom bots is totally fine.

3/4/3 | Your Secrets trigger twice.  
---
You're joking, warrior is the epitome of unfun repetitive play. Atleast rogue kills you fast so you can move on
---
I will!
---
Now that I think about it, you're right but I just don't run into as many warriors as rogues
---
Because usually, people link the XKCD comic directly.
---
Thanks man! I sure will, got my beast deck ready üëç
---
&gt;D√∂rti R√§tt
---
if you‚Äòre eindeutsching it then do it correctly
---
It was definitely worth it
---
KCharge*(?)
---
Fair enough, I am still scared by my time on ladder being forced to play 15-20 min games where I slowly lose to fatigue
---
Wild really isn't that much of a cesspit. It has its issues, yes, but its not all just Big Priest and Murloc Shaman, especially at the lower ranks.
---
Nah, Iron Juggernaut is too slow and you can get the same effect with Augmented Elek and Clockwork Goblin. The key to bomb Warrior is early minion pressure mixed with the Bombs to finish people off, Iron Juggernaut doesn't fit into that very well as it comes down late and isn't very flexible. You can put more than enough bombs into people's decks with just Clockwork Goblin and Wrenchcalibur.
---
Also, a 6 mana 6/5 is a lot worse than a 5 mana 5/5.
---
Went up against [this guy](https://hsreplay.net/replay/StwGWyfQU4Sqap6F4eXs8e) earlier this week, looked like he was running something somewhat similar, a little greedier tho.
---
It‚Äôs a little bugged a friend of mine logged in but when he logged out after that it showed as away for 3 weeks the numbers are messed up for some reason
---
Renounce darkness broken?
---
Turn 6 isn't "very late" for bomb warrior. Most bomb warrior games at least reach turn 10. 
---
It would be a good fit if you're facing a lot of control warriors, mages, or pogo rogues. I didn't even think about the 20 damage with Elek+Juggernaut. 
---
If the meta was super aggro it wouldn't see play, but then bomb warrior just wouldn't see play either because CW is just strictly better vs aggro.
---
Another issue with the card is it doesn't add "copies" in the same way that other cards will "copy".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Other copies are exact duplicates of the target, but Duplatransmogrifier seems to go against this rule, only putting in a "copy" of the unbuffed target.
---
Wolfrider by it self is fine , ignoring the fact that it's a subpar card, what's really problematic about charge minions is that they're cheap and for example a druid can easilly turn a 2/1 into a 5/4 to go face and have the rest of the board buffed as well. Big expensive charge like King Krush unless cheated out is a perfectly ok card by it self. I think that rush should stay as semi-cheap removal on legs while charge is a slower finisher. 
---
Honestly what the game needs is more disruption and agression because most decks recently are just "Stall/set up a combo until you get that one card and win the game". Like 70% of Warrior's game plan is stall till Dr. Boom
---
I've seen the problem.  I assumed it was because I login to the same account with multiple devices (not at the same time)
---
It's a 1-29 card deck
---
Blizzard randomly fills the deck when you enter a game
---
Hey question how is patches, well, all that great.
---
Lmao when did Blizzard use the baby shark song?
---
So... not sure if you noticed... but Piranha isn‚Äôt really a part of why that deck did as well as it did aside from the fact it isn‚Äôt a minion in a Barnes/Y‚ÄôShaarj deck. Unless there are epic games where it really carried them.
---
I liked it, but I had to fast forward through the scene where Squeamlish cuts off the cop‚Äôs ear
---
Undertaker Hunter, Midrange Shaman, and Jade Druid metas were single deck metas. It‚Äôs worst matchup was the mirror. 
---
The Pirate, Tempo Rogue, Dragon Warrior is the worst meta because it was brain dead and you only had to go face to win by turn 6.
---
The Combo Druid, Secret Paladin, and Odd/Even meta was the worst meta because you only had to curve out. 
---
The Quest Rogue, Freeze Mage, and Shudderwock Shaman meta was the worst meta because combo decks are uninteractive and anti-fun.
---
The Keleseth, Reno/Highlander, and Barnes meta was the worst meta because you had to draw 1 card and you win.
---
The Control Warrior, Cyclone Mage, Lackey Rogue meta is the worst meta because it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm playing right now.
---
Turn 6 is late if all you are doing is putting a bomb in your opponent's deck and playing a vanilla 6/5 minion. A turn 9 consisting of nothing but an Elek and Iron Juggernaut is also not a very good play even if the Juggernaut has Rush from Dr. Boom. In the current popular version of Bomb Warrior this wouldn't be a good card, but you are right if the meta slows down enough to where control decks are popular then sure Iron Juggernaut would see play in Bomb Warrior.
---
Same happened to an opponent of mine. He played one Al‚ÄôKali the Rhino which drew and buffed another üò±
---
They put a hatchling in your hatchling, so you can hatch while you hatch.
---
\-Xzibit, probably
---
I see, I thought the feature worked differently. Thanks.
---
piranha launcher is one of my favorite cards.
---
Priest
---
I think they made their own one - baby murloc. But I¬¥m not sure, I saw it when someone retweeted that. (anyways I was trying to compare these 2 songs.)
---
Duplitransmogrifier on alystra the immortal.
---
16 sprikeridge + 5 sound the bells + gnomish army knife
---
Turn 4 win.
---
Not that much worse than most gold animations, never understood why people crave them.
---
HERE COME DA BIG AXE!
---
I think the only way to make this work would be for it to be premade decks like whizbang has.
---
Nem vased√©ny?
---
It just means you can hypothetically reduce it down to 3 and cast another hunting party to get a 48 damage otk for those warrior games.
---
Blizzard had the first moba as well.
---
Didn't stop other companies from capatilizing on it first.
---
Two layers for Auto Chess tho. DOTA, TF2, CS were all the games made after a mod. Mods within those games didn't go on to spawn another standalone game, at least not one this popular.
---
He only played silver hand requires even though his hand was not small
---
Where did you get the art images? They are not exactly like what you see in the cards, are they?
---
This list is pretty mediocre. Some of these are rated highly and don't make sense because the card itself is weak but the deck it was in was strong.  Prince Thaldram for example is a pretty shit card but Carnivorous cube was busted in some decks so it had exactly 1 use. Then you put a card like Hooktusk in the middling pack but that card is INCREDIBLY broken. It's battlecry is one of the strongest in the game. The only reason it's not super busted right now is because pirates are kind of meh. You seem to be rating cards based on the decks they were played in rather than the card themselves. I know there are tons of cards so it can get hard to keep track of what goes into what tier. But what I suggest doing for a tier this big is set some cards as tier defining and then just go off of those.
---
In the time you need to pull it off, you might as well kill him the regular way.
---
Shaman Quest was bad because a full Murloc deck wants to play a minion turn 1
---
After all the hate, we should thank blizzard for somewhat fixing embarrassingly terrible things in their game since forever.
---
Haha do whatcha gotta do. Ive only been playing a few months so i have a bit of dust but still collecting to see where i wanna go with my decks. Ive played other games f2p and its a great feeling when youre able to get something you want and you can appreciate it because you know what it took to get it.
---
Yeah this happens to me constantly. The other day it showed 18 when there was 3.
---
If you think of Pirahna Launcher as sort of a 5 mana 3/4 weapon, then it's not that much worse than Assassin's Blade. Summoning tokens while clearing stuff is also pretty good (like Vinecleaver, which is also super overcosted.) The problem is that Pirahna launcher kills nothing in the midgame, and when it was released Hunter could only play aggressively, so slow value cards sucked. 
---
Pirahna Launcher would certainly be interesting with cards like Houndmaster Shaw to give the tokens rush. Or with more beast buffing cards. The main benefit of summoning minions with a weapon is, of course, being able to summon minions for free on the following turns after you played your weapon. There's no way it would be OP though, but maybe someday...
---
"blizzard hates druids"
---
...have we.... Have we been playing the same game? The only meta I can ever remember where druid was bad is that meta for like 2 weeks before old gods when they had just nerfed druid because they were about to become the best class again.
---
A warrior deck in wild? Very interesting, mind sharing the decklist?
---
Auto Chess is also based on WC3/SC2 mods
---
Outjerked again
---
I‚Äôve messed with call pet in wild decks.  The problem is that most beast hunters use smaller beasts that only cost 1-3 mana.
---
Dinomancy a really can be pretty strong with hunter.  If you play it, you won‚Äôt get the Zuljin hero power because it gets played again, but when most of your deck is cheap beasts with rush, it‚Äôs actually probably better most of the time anyway.
---
&gt; What if Blizzard allowed players the ability to trade in Legendary cards for others? 
---
And with that, you've created a grey market for legendary cards.
---
Few days ago there was a guy who posted similar image but with 100K gold, you still have some grind to do ;-)
---
Good news! /u/KreaHS posted an [excellent guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/c1s70g/going_down_the_rabbit_hole_pogohopper_rogue_guide/) on that deck earlier this week in comphs.
---
It goes over decklist, mulligans, general strategy, and case studies of important turns in example games (with links for full replays).
---
Looks like a really cool deck.  Thanks for the share!
---
All calculations for the AI are done on blizzard servers, it would take a massive overhaul to allow that to take place client side. That would certainly not be worth the effort it takes.
---
Also it would open up exploiting in the pve modes although that is not that big of an issue since the rewards are small and they are pretty easy to get anyway.
---
Thanks for sharing your creds, I'm sorry if you felt your opinion wasn't being fairly considered otherwise.
---
I don't think we actually disagree here, no one's saying it replaces  Soul or Forest's Aid. When your game plan against control is to just exhaust their removal, another board refill is far from redundant. If someone told me a month ago that Druid would be playing Harvest Golem, I'd be just as skeptical as you are now.
---
IIRC auto chess on DotA 2 has its foundations on another wc3 mod.  So it's really yet another wc3 mod coming to fruition.
---
For all your jojo memes. Thank u
---
It's not happening. Sorry
---
Piranha Launcher wasn't great but there are tons of worse cards, I don't know why people hated on it so much. It actually was pretty good in Arena.
---
Hunter‚Äôs Animal Companion is always Huffer anyways, it doesn‚Äôt need that option
---
When the face play taunt, me still go face
---
Mimiron's Head itself isn't sticky and needs to survive a turn.
---
you ignored the actual biggest problem with Mimiron's Head which is that the 5 mana 4/5 itself needs to survive a turn
---
And what does "one legendary per release" do? Nothing. And if you allow it in general ppl would just make more accounts, farm guaranteed legendaries from packs, trade em to their main account and never spend a cent on the game again.
---
It's not a trading card game, it's a collectible card game. If you want something you have to play for it or spend cash.
---
He said ‚Äútrade in‚Äù like you would with a car dealership,  not trading with other players. A guess a 1-time 1:1 swap per expansion
---
I think it sounds cool, and player friendly
---
What decks does hutner 'rule out'?  I know it's popular (bit too popular, it could certainly have a lower play rate) but what's hunter surpressing?.
---
You can't compare it to Antonidas. You can create Fireballs from Antonidas the turn you play it. You aren't REQUIRED to stick him for a turn to get value from him. You are from Mimiron's Head, and cards like that have basically never been good in Hearthstone.
---
It's the highest of tier, but overload shaman is fun as shit, and the 16 damage combo turn from an empty board is a magical, salt inducing swing turn.
---
Saw your copy/paste a few times, it's a good resource, I cleaned up the formatting.  Feel free to use. ([In markdown](https://notepad.pw/ziy1vpyh))
