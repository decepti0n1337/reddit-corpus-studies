No, none of those cards will improve the deck.

What a man builds with his own two hands is his art, his craft, and a man demands what he deems his art is worth in payment.

You don't get to decide how much his time or his skill is worth, he does that, and you can decide whether to buy or not. 
---
Texx is such a nice streamer and very good too, I don't know the other guy. 
---
it may be because generally before, theyve only bannes specific cards (like whizbang)
---
This is the thing with all these videos. I often find even the hardest lethal because I know there is one. But in live games I miss lethal frequently and only realize after the fact that I could have done some cool things.
---
shadow damage, coin, shadow damage, 1 cost, shadow damage, silence, shadow damage.
---
I think it was a joke about a fake leak that claimed the next set would be called "Secret of the Seas." Star Aligner's multiple references to the number seven and the popular phrase "seven seas" may have been what they were going for.
---
Really? Dang :/ Well, thanks

---
They got together after to play a few more arenas when this play came up. It went back and forth between "passing couldn't possibly be the correct play for 4 turns" and "I think the best play here is passing again to try and get better mossy value"
---
Passing 4 turns wound up being the perfect play.
---
I'm currently having huge success with Deathrattle Rexxar. The 2/2 mech that kills a minon is just insane here.  2 Freezing Traps, 2 Deadly Shots, 2 of those mechs and 1 Sylvanas gives you so many huge swing turns that it's nearly impossible to lose. Cube is insane on a different level.
---
Production teams can‚Äôt be on the entire show according to state law of California where they are entitled to a 30 minute break. Therefore, no one will be switching, doing audio, directing cameras, putting on graphics, and running the show. Hence, having a caster in that slot there would be pointless.
---
Big priest is a tempo/control deck, like handlock. It has combo elements, but isn't dependant on cycling to a single win condition.
---
All i see is that over 1/5th of people are playing hunter and practically all with rexxar!
---
2 of the same class hero cards on the list, well balanced!
---
Rexxar and spellstone are the two best cards in that deck.
---
No. Never attack friendly characters. Its bad wording.
---
[[Spider Bomb]] for hunter is basically auto win if you wait until turn 5 or later.  When I do it, 95% of the time opponent instantly concedes.

Your legend Elo can drop far enough that you are matched with players of a similar skill level. Essentially you are doing so poorly in legend it thinks you are a rank 10 equivalent player in terms of matchmaking elo.

Pretty much agree with what you're saying.  They are incredibly uninteractive and outright boring as fuck decks to play against.  
---
I imagine they do Blizzard more harm to the game than good.  
---
Considering the main counter is to run aggro which in turn is pretty boring to play it's doesn't make for an overly enjoyable experience.  
---
I'm in the "quests until rotation" mode also.

That is unfortunate. You can still bluff and play Zentimo to psych your opponent out, they might treat it like a soft taunt because the potential for it to fuck shit up when in reality you have nothing haha

Popesaidit#2796 EU, 80g trade

These cards that randomize attacks or targets will never make you attack something you aren't able to target beforehand.
---
For example, Yogg can't shieldslam you in the face because the card doesn't allow him.
---
What did you expect from a hunter
---
This deck feels absolutely predatory, tier 0.
---
I took out the meteor for Sylvanas, seems better.
---
If the brawl meta develops and people recognize how good it is, it will be worth slotting in anti-secret tech (Kezan Mystic) or playing some kind of control/combo deck that can outheal it. Maybe something like hakkar druid or regular tog druid.

Same for the spell that makes minions "randomly" choose a side. Never seen it fuck the opponent over yet regardless of who plays it.

Am playing res priest at the moment. It's ridiculous what that deck can do. As much salt as the deck gets, i've noticed i've actually had more fun playing it than others. Many decks feel repetitive, decks like even shaman, and any of the druid/hunter decks I played. With res priest depending on your card order and opponent I never feel like I know what I'm gonna get. Way too many win conditions in that deck though.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I was a pure Druid player until the mana ramp nerfs, i loved token druid but was at a lost of what else to play after that. 
---
It basically a "play and win" card because you don't play it at all times, it's a kind of tech card you play against control or an aggro deck if you desperately need the 2dmg AoE.
---
Glad I got my win 7 minutes after the brawl went live before people could find good strats

5/13 8 to face. Probably the best rendition of flark thus far.

r/rimjobsteve
---
Baku and Greymane are the worst cards ever printed IMO, exactly for the reason you just gave.
---
They had too much of an impact on the game just by themselves, and it was not a positive impact.
---
Giving so much guaranteed consistency/synergy in a game where RNG needs to play a role is super stupid. When you have something THAT consistent, you can just solely rely on it and nothing else, and that's why you see so many Odd/Even decks in Tier 1 since The Witchwood has been released, because consistency is just that good.
---
it's not just one of them, it's THE Bogdanoff.
---
Who knows what will happen..
---
I only did a few games, but I'd say the last Sylvanas wins in most cases.
---
I don‚Äôt have friends and I can‚Äôt win :(
---
Psst. 1 mana makes ALL the difference.
---
His cards are golden, basicallt foil versions. They do the same thing as the regular cards, just have a slight animation in the picture. They cost twice as much dust to craft.
---
I‚Äôm running all those cards myself, added in hunters mark and candle shot, as well as mad scientist with snipes to stop the amalgamating
---
&gt; If they have a board that late in the game odds are you're fucked anyway unless you get lucky and top deck a clearance (because why did you let them build a board if you already had a clearance in hand?).
---
A wide board usually means weak minions, especially on an aggro deck.
---
&gt; If they don't have a board then the swing of 3/6 life steal with freeze is huge and you play it out from there with cards in hand, no different to any other deck including rexxar, diffrence being rexxar you are trying to generate the card to fit the situation, often this fails.
---
The swing of 2 damage to every enemy minion on 6 is pretty huge, too. I'd also say Zombeast is way more flexible and has the potential to be much more useful, so even taking into account its worse consistency, it's better on average.
---
&gt; Huh? earlier as in turn 6 - what other impactful cards are you going to play with no mana left?
---
That's a *huge* difference... Most cards go from oppressively OP to merely playable with just a 1 mana nerf. Hunter also has plenty of effective 1/2/3/4 mana cards. How many 1 mana cards on mage  are useful on turn 10+?
---
In casual mode you can play anyone. In ranked you will play against someone of similar skill, particular through rank 25
---
Were you playing ranked? A lot of people like to bring teir one decks to ranked but lose on purpose so they stay really low on the ladder so they can get easy wins on new players because they have small penises. A card being gold doesn't really mean anything, it's just shiny. You can pay twice the card's crafting price to craft it golden and you can pull them out of packs but it's a lot more rare than the regular cards.

I was playing casual but only because I basically just started also that was funny the small penis joke lol
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Depends on how you define 'counter'.  If counter means that you can force a match on for another 2-4 turns beyond when the combo wants to go off so you can implement, it works quite well against most.
---
If counter means 'a single card that will let you win a match you have no other way of winning' no Zihi isn't a counter.  Which is good, that's horrid tech.
---
Ok good to know thought I was going against someone who was just really good and thought the matchmaking was wack

Yeah I don't know how the fuck you got this dude in casual. The golden hero and hero power means he's won at least 500 ranked games with that class.
---
If you win a certain number of games by hitting your opponent's face for exact lethal (100 games won, I think?) you will have the option in "My Collection" to shine cards. 
---
If you shine cards enough times (100x, I think?) they will turn golden. 
---
If you have enough golden cards in a deck (15 cards, I think?) you can choose the difficulty level of your opponent.

Good luck, have fun!

You can queue up some of the actions while waiting for others, which should recover some time over the course of the process. Also, once all remaining fireballs are in hand, you don't have to wait for any further animations to win.
---
It amazes me then with the RNG nature of arena how people can get an average around 7 being that it's consecutive runs.    
---
I guess they have a lot of money/coins to do so but that aside it to me demonstrates the incredibly higher level of skill that arena requires over constructed.

To remember Loti's stats, just remember the similar cards to her transformations :
---
-The Taunt has the stats of [[Crypt Lord]]
---
-The Spell Damage has the stats of [[Dalaran Mage]]
---
-The Poisonous has no exact counterpart ; the closest is probably [[Patient Assassin]] with one more Health
---
-The Rush is [[Druid of the Scythe]] in Rush form, or alternatively Huffer that can't go face

Hunter will be pretty much dead when the next expansion comes. It will basically lose all tools that make hunter currently so powerful, most notably Rexxar, Spellstone and Flankking Strike. I can't imagine Zul Jin being relevant in the next cycle. Baku is a much safer craft.
---
Dust is what you already get for discarding cards. Also I can only imagine the complaints Blizzard would get when some accidentally discards there "triple legenary pack". Honestly a more elegant request would just be to make quest reward 100 gold if your goal is to get one pack a day. But really I think the gold economy is fine as is. 
---
When I was watching people play Masters Call on youtube I thought it was just stream donations at first and not the actual sound effect.

You need at least 2 Twigs post Myra‚Äôs Unstable Element to refresh your mana crystals back to ten. The rest of the 3 cards need to be dumped without reducing your mana count from ten, so they can be either be Innervate, Biology Project or Twig.

I really hate this kind of hunter. It's just another version of the same damn hunter we've been playing for years. Secret hunter isn't much better, in some ways worse cause of how broken spellstone is. Atleast deathrattle hunter is different, like really different, we've never seen a hunter like it before....its genuinely a bit slower and a lot cooler.
---
They bought a ton of mediocre to average classic spells back because the bucket system incorporates them better than the rarity system.

This applies to meta decks, totally right.

But due to this same reason, everyone plays the same decks, odd pala, spell hunter etc.

Well he is a legendary so and you can only have 1 of him in a deck normally, so hopefully that never happens
---
I like your name, friendo
---
the spell doesnt 'deal' damage per say, as you only take it  and unlike hakarr's corrupted blood, it does not have a definitive number of damage for vellen/malygos to buff up.

Did Blizzard ever email you thanking you for the purchase of the Khadgar skin or confirming it with you, I've never bought anything from Blizzard but most game companies will do that, that's how I track how much money I waste on League of Legends.

Is this, umm, an out of season April Fools joke?
---
?
---
as to why, its because it would be counter productive, on an already situational card
---
The unkillable taunt I heard about on things like youtube
---
So yeah, not a counterpart - there's a number of similar cards, but none identical in terms of stats and ability, unless I'm forgetting something. You could also include [[Cloakscale Chemist]] with Poisonous instead of Divine Shield.

2/1/2 | Stealth Divine Shield  
---
Good advice.
---
Yes, this was my reasoning also, but unlike 'Betrayal' where minion does it's damage (so not spell) and 'Doomerang' where weapon deals it's damage this is not really obvious because text does not really clarify what is the source of damage if not spell itself.

The chances of hitting the 7+ twigs alone is already 1 in 171,000 against (using a [binomial probability calculator](https://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx)). Getting the exact draws you need from Myra's could be even worse. You've got a deck of 45 cards you're drawing from, and need exactly 10 of them, one of which is only a 2/45, the others of which need to be prerequisite pulled by AE and also at best make up slightly more than half the deck. I can't imagine this step is better than 1 in 100k. Plus you also have to deal with the initial draw RNG, UI draw RNG, and lastly, the fateful Hallucination. I can't imagine you'll get odds better than 1 in 10 billion against here. 
---
What do you mean only 3 usable?  Every single one except maybe Warrior was used in a meta deck, and even the Warrior DK has some niche inclusions.
---
At the end of your turn, all of your minions die and their stats are added to form a single minion. 
---
Deathrattles always trigger, so they‚Äôre good in this brawl. 
---
im not the guy you replied too but how does the meta change the higher u go up? at ~15 its all hunter baku and occasional control deck but i see youtubers and streamers at 5-legend playing against otk decks and having to tech in cards to counter like zihi. i guess my question is what ranks are what decks more effective in?
---
You are kidding right? I play mostly Otk deck and believe me, the is ALOT of tech possible. Most people are just too duumb to put it in. Zihi being clearly the best. You just have to play it when the Otk is coming instead of on curve.
---
Nah I play all sorts, control, mid-range, combo if I'm in the mood I'll even play outright aggro. The reason I don't like it is cause it's more of the same thing we;'ve seen hunter doing now for years, no change - early threats, get in the early chip damage, threaten mid game through hero power and topdecks. Same shit we've seen hutner doing since the game launched.
---
Hence my love for deathrattle hunter, it's genuinely different.
---
Oof... Well there we go.

Or that 3 mana 2/2 tri-class card?

I thought I was in big trouble actually, considering to the both of us, it was a clear way to discard my wincon

How did he lose? Mechathun wouldn‚Äôt trigger because of the anomaly or whatever it‚Äôs called
---
Thanks friend!
---
I feel like this is probably the highest probability one here. If you can come up with a list of charge minions that can pull this off in standard I can help you out. 
---
What makes this one good is that a) you have a bunch of different initial draw options b) you have a bunch of different paths towards victory with the charge minions. 
---
You could try to request your full Battle.net account data through the privacy request here: https://us.battle.net/support/en/help/wf/services/316/1490
---
It should have a list of your purchases as well as your Hearthstone data. I suspect that if it's gone from your order history it will be absent here as well, but there's no harm in trying. The turn around is about a day or so.
---
Obliterate says "destroy a minion" just like assassinate/walk the plank/execute/naturalize etc. The spell isn't doing the damage, the minion is in regards to its remaining health. Velen does not affect minion damage.
---
Noggenfogger + target undamaged minion. I'm pretty sure that's possible. I don't own him, though. I just know he's crazy.
---
Listen here you little shit!
---
Proof that the druid nerfs were completely unwarranted. No other class has this weakness to constantly play around.
---
Sounds like the GM didn't understand what sort of can of worms they were opening by giving a "Company Line" response.
---
Odds are this person just miscounted to 40 or tried to achieve a pity timer across different sets, which is not possible.
---
With the release of the Lunar New Year set (10 packs from each of 3 sets), it's entirely possible that this person said "hmm...I haven't opened a legendary in a while...assume i've opened 10 or more packs without a leg, I'll open 30 and guarantee a legendary".  This is a fallacy because that's not how the system works.
---
Reminds me of back in the Halo 2 XBL days, my gamertag was Fizz0 and I randomly matchmade in team slayer with a guy named Fizz00. What were the fuckin odds. I freaked out and DMed him after the game and he never responded üòî
---
Actually, in astronomical scale, jackpot in lottery is pretty likely, while card deck scenarios tend to easily get astronomically unlikely.
---
According to u/namhtes1's maths, the odds of drawing those cards are trillions of times smaller than winning a lottery, and that's not even accounting for Academic Espionage giving you the correct cards, which according to u/-jjjjjjjjjj\-'s maths is less likely than winning the jackpot three times in a row. So all in all, we're roughly speaking looking at winning the jackpot half a dozen times in a row.
---
Winsect, the game that‚Äôs fun for the whole family.
---
Wait, hang on...
---
That's it. Get an infinite amount of monkeys on the job. Make it happen
---
A little more likely with ship's cannon in hand and patches in your deck.
---
Thanks, this makes sense. It's similar to the ranking system of a lot of other games then it seems. I wasn't sure if Hearthstone divulged their ranking system, or at least some details as to what was included in a player's elo score
---
Oh yeah. 
---
Agreed, I feel like so many cards that aren't even legendaries or epics have such a strong character that deserves some music. Like imagine how great it would be if playing Annoy-o-Tron came with a bunch of bells and honking? 
---
I get why they don't though -- legendaries feel more unique and powerful + bigger budget required for the composers on something that in the grand scheme of things is pretty small. A lot of the legendary summon music is reused for multiple cards already or pulled from other franchise tracks so I don't think they prioritized it (and perhaps rightfully so). But we can still hope! hah
---
TIL all the DKs have 100% played winrate
---
You have a problem with your Mulligan.  You have 5 cards listed in your Mulligan when you should only have 4 going second.  So, this won't work on turn 1.
---
I commend your commitment but wouldn't Odd Quest Warrior kind of give you the same thing?
---
That name &gt; That counter
---
That's an old brawl, banning eggs is nothing too fancy. I guess ladder sucks because every new expansion gets even more boring cards than the previous...
---
You are not. 
---
Never said that, but there are three classes that are currently only alive because of their DK cards.
---
Ya it was similar but you picked 20 minions and Blizzard auto filled 20 spells. Also, the ability to swap back changed the strategic elements. 
---
&gt;  but aggro just seemed way less aggravating than board clears until OTK
---
You are forgetting. 
---
Only being able to draw 1/3 of your deck (because matches were over by turn 6) to find your anti-aggro tools that would help you survive was beyond frustrating.
---
It turned the game into a match of drawing the right cards in the right order.
---
That's why Reno was so popular. All the early anti-aggro tools were inadequate.
---
Even if we were to do a crazy underestimate and gave every condition a 1/10 probability of happening, there are a total of 20 conditions that have to happen, meaning 1/(10^20), which is 12 orders of magnitude less likely than winning the lottery.
---

Is there a way for mage to kill his Mechathun in constructed? I'm looking for any ideas.

I have to do a 0 B "update" every time if I open HS app without a data connection. It takes a long time to do with mobile data and that's all i've got right now.

Yea take it gril
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt like to disenchant any legendaries on the off chance they become Meta and you can‚Äôt get a legendary that you already own from a pack. If you disenchant you can open it on your next pack instead of something good. 
---
But IMO you are safe to disenchant this one. I think you will have more fun using 400 dust to craft cards you really want to play with. 
---
And Leeroy's 5. They seem swapped
---
Luna‚Äôs Pocket Galaxy with Voodo doll.
---
Strong is relative though, if you're a midrange hunter player at rank 5 or something a budget Baku deck isn't stronger at all but if you're new to card games in general Baku teaches you quite a lot
---
I was playing against a mechathun Warnock as odd mage last night. Babbling book gave me potion of polymorph and I used it when he had an e.pty deck. When the secret procced he conceded lol 
---
So you dont actually need the 2nd acedemic espionage, since backstabs and whatnot will be playable. Can also add a wisp so wisp + backstab cancels itselft. 
---
I mean lets look at the mana you need. You need to be able to play C'thun, 1x naturalize, and 1x hallucination (since the 2nd naturalize is accounted for by the innervate you get here). You're starting at 5 mana left after myras, with a twig equipped, so you can naturalize and hallucination, be at 3 mana left. Since we can heropower to replace twig, you actually have 1 mana left over. If you did play the 2nd espionage you need either 1 twig or 3 bio projects, at least.
---
Aggro is alive in wild, and it isn't very frustrating as you are dead turn 4/5. No exaggeration either, pirate rogue, Baku pally and rogue absolutely wreck any otk deck if they don't draw perfectly. 
---
u should turn it into a custom card in r/customhearthstone
---
Looks great!
---
Puzzle for people good at math with way too much free time:
---
Which is more likely, this combo or a 5 legendary pack?
---
don't worry, returning players will pay the price of 5 copies of witcher 3 to make a few decks for a card game made in unity
---
Which is very foolish from a design perspective because Baku will rotate out. The whole reason they introduced standard was so that synergies would eventually rotate out and so they'd have more freedom, and yet for some reason they're still letting non-classic cards influence their design choices? Why even bother with standard mode then?
---
1/1s. Fuck Odd/Even decks.
---
*The* worst cards to ever be printed in HS, period. 
---
I guess that‚Äôs true, I‚Äôve probably just been really lucky in my matchups.
---
it is to get people back into the game, it is to lower the barrier to entry. once they are playing then they will be more likely to spend money to actually compete.
---
oops didn't see the new nerfs xD
---
Power Word: Shield is the most staple Priest card across Hearthstone history IMO. I'm honestly expecting Blizzard to nerf it at some point, considering their philosophy against auto-include Basic cards.
---
If even hunter is a thing, it probably doesn't play mark. all the best ways to kill a marked minion cost 1 or 3 mana
---
Shudda nerfed more. Doubt this will shift meta away from hunter seeing as many decks don‚Äôt even run the stone
---
Or just go totally balls out like with one of the last Tavern Brawls and terminate the Classic set entirely. That Tavern Brawl was one of the funnest that I've had the pleasure to play.
---
*Shadowverse* has no classic set! You're just expected to form your decks based on the current expansions. HS can do likewise but they would need to give out tons of free packs to compensate.
---
The difference between wolf and totem are still pretty big. 
---
Hey all, hope you will like this special Report, what deck (that will be nerfed) will you miss the most?
---
Great write up. I am not a fan of the balance changes of late.
---
Looks like "for" autocorrected. It did lol aoe
---
If they keep nerfing the Classic set, then the conclusion of that process is that the set is unplayable.
---
They're supposed to be for old players, not new players.  New players buy expansions.  Old players come back to a collection where they still have at least some cards to work with.  But if the evergreen set slowly becomes irrelevant to competitive play, then those players come back to a whole lot of nothing.
---
[[Steamwheedle Sniper]]
---
Wild ladder is mine
---
The wild players may disagree with you. And there are dozens of us.  
---
In all honesty though, wild didn't ask for this nerf, nor did we need it. The wild meta has never been healthier. Just about every class has at least one solid deck to play. 
---
Pretty sure these nerfs aren't as answer to the meta but in preparation for the next set...maybe the equality nerf will make sense then.
---
*cough* Carniverous Cube *cough*
---
Power Word: Shield is in essentially every Priest deck ever and is a Basic card. I'm honestly expecting Blizzard to nerf it eventually, given their philosophy against auto-include Basic/Classic cards.
---
Emerald spellstone is a fine nerf. Flametongue is debatable, the EQ and cold blood nerfs are retarded.
---
if its to good/prevelant in standard, roate it to wild with hall of fame and do a core set like kibler has sugegsted countless times.
---
Yes, that is what I am referring to, 4 Mana.
---
Wouldnt make much sense. 1 mana hero power is not good in hunter and even worse when you realize hunter wants to play Rexxar asap most games.
---
You also lose both popular weapons, KC, and animal companion and add a minion to the deck (Genn) which makes to my side bad.
---
Currently big aggro hunter (kathrena, charge dinosaurs, secrets, tutors etc) has a higher winrate without the DKs. 
---
When your plan is to win on turn 8/9 at the latest they are just bad cards. 
---
Even big hunter could well be disgusting. The only problem is the loss of the three mana tutor will destroy consistency. 
---

---
2/2/3 | Your Hero Power can target minions.  
---
Add in mecha'thun, drop it when you run out of cards and win the game.
---
Still Priest is untouched. Best deck in Wild. Probably the best and definitely the most annoying deck in Standard.
---
Only for a few more months, until Candleshot rotates. Why not nerf Candleshot instead of Hunter's Mark? I don't get it. HM has never been a problem. Cards are supposed to wax and wane in power as sets rotate in and out. HM has never been a serious problem so it was in no way deserving of a nerf just because it become good for a few sets. 
---
Secret even rouge buff
---
I mean I was saying earlier to leave the more interesting card that has more potential in the future, which is definitely kingsbane. 
---
This looks a little rough.
---
Tap on 1. 
---
Tap or Secret on 2 cause you don't want to play naked Hyena or Razormaw (What are you even trying to Razormaw in this deck?)
---
Same for turn 3.
---
Houndmaster on 4....oh wait. No beasts.
---
So, I guess just tap and play secrets until 6???
---
it wasnt, it was weak without combo and bit betetr then blessing of might with combo ,like combo is designed for.  weak without, strong with combo
---
Please revert the changes to the classic and basic set and move it to the Hall of Fame. Then for every two years introduce a "Core" set with some new cards and reprints. That will make things interesting. Right now it all boils down to "Got a problem?" - "Let's just nerf classic cards" It doesn't feel good and it doesn't help Wild mode. 
---
No, but 2 is. Balance patch bro. 
---
Carniverous cube isn't that bad to play against, especially if you're playing hunter
---
A lot of people suggested that, Kibler as well. That is how it works for certain styles of MTG. 
---
Sure, but they could have done both by making Kingsbane specifically unable to lifesteal.
---
&gt;Even hunter will never work, what's your plan? HP on turn 1? For what? You cut a lot of good card and have an horrible mana curve for nothing. I mean you can win with that but I don't se the bonus of using Gwen especially since you have 2 DK in the deck.
---
yes, but that was a buff to a nerf.  That's more like a correction.  
---
They need to take a card like sliverback matriarch and give it another point of health.  Nothing that will make it dominant, but that it might see some play somewhere. 
---
They could buff 1 card per month from a random set.
---
Looks like Paladin joins priest in the "all my classic board clears are ass" club. So basically if they dont get a ridiculous AOE every expac they just won't be able to do control.
---
Again? Right after i make a deck they have to nerf it to being most likely unplayable?   
---
Come the fuck on you barely see odd rogue on ladder now.  
---
This makes me wanna quit i wasted my dust for the second time on a deck that is not dominant but is still really good and for some reason it has to get completely nerfed. 
---
when the fuck was equality a problem? That really sounds like "hey, we can't print a better board clear for paladin than equality+pyro, so let's just nerf eq" ffs.
---
It has insane potential though
---
Well shaman and rogue may not be for much longer. Also priest isnt good? Have you seen big priest, that shits crazy in wild 
---
Honestly knocking it out of Odd Rogue makes that Coin+Flappy Bird nut draw much less scary and I'm okay with this. 
---
Cold Blood should not be HoF'd because it doesn't present design problems the way Conceal would have, even if they changed it to "stealth for one turn". 
---
And Kill Command. Is 2 damage per turn worth giving up 10?
---
The problem with equality is not that it was too strong. It's that every other board clear in the game is too weak -- except defile and a couple of others -- and that it was too strong by comparison.
---
Blizzard's design philosophy is essentially, at its core, that Hearthstone should be a one player game that two people play coincidentally next to one another. You have a fantasy in mind, you work towards that fantasy, and any player trying to interact with you or kill that fantasy should be fighting an uphill battle to do it. You should just be able to pull it off about half the time. Hadronox and N'Zoth and the like are just supposed to win you the game, they're not supposed to leave room for ambiguity.
---
Brawl and a few other board clears are still playable, but none of them really feel like they counter those big boards, so much as just answering them and keeping you alive. This informs the way hearthstone is played as a whole, and discourages proper *control* play for some vague version of slow midrange.
---
that's kind of the thing about it. It's not really hunter's mark that was bonkers, it was that candleshot made it useful.
---
God I hate this. I am almost exclusively play wild, and I almost wish Blizzard would just ban cards out of standard instead of nerfs. Sometimes I think nerfs are fine (e.g. Aviana), but I'd prefer wild to remain a considerably more powerful format than standard, much like eternal formats in MtG.
---
Anyone think Hunter will still dominate despite these nerfs?
---
They buffed the mountain giant
---
Of needing to HoF them now
---
At this point, I would have rather not come back at all. Losing every game is not fun so not having any cards would at least have a neutral effect on my return. Under powered cards and cards nerfed from when I last played makes the games less fun for me. Luckily arena is pretty good or much better than it used to be
---
Finally hunters get nerfed! /r/fuckhunters
---
That would have been very antiquated while also eliminating the possibility for you to ever give kingsbane lifesteal, which is kind of dumb. 
---
Or have a rotating core set with selected Classic cards. Seems like the way to go, and it gives them much more freedom on what they can print.
---
It‚Äôs truly baffling how terrible they are.
---
I'm of a mind where I don't think any two-card board clear is overpowered. Forcing someone to include four cards (two pyro, 2 equality) thins a deck and gives the player a disadvantage because their deck essentially has fewer cards.  
---
Also, "playable on ladder" =/= " "one of the strongest decks atm"
---
Well until we see the upcoming sets it's impossible to have a complete picture of why some of these nerfs happenned.  Ultimately I think the frequent nerfs are being done in an attempt to revitalize this dead game.
---
I don't care about the fallout. I'm excited for a new meta! Frequent changes shakes things up and keeps the brains churning.
---
Tracking is an absolutely nutty card. There's really no questioning/replacing it.
---
I hope so, the goal wasn't to completely invalidate Hunter archetypes, or really any of the cards we changed. When we make a balance change it's less about looking at the current environment and more about trying to understand what Hearthstone is like after we make changes. Statistically, Secret Hunter was the most powerful deck in the game and close to the most popular. We felt like there wasn't a huge long-term downside to changing the secret build-around card that is likely to get more powerful over time in Wild while we can protect against Secret Hunter separating itself from the pack even more than it already was.
---
Indirect Skulking Geist nerf. 
---
Do you even play wild?
---
But priest is flashy and dumb when they drop barns on 4, but it's tier 2-3 ish. Every meta report tells you that. It's just not very fun to play against. But so are 100 other decks in wild.
---
I think you're just trying to complain while you're not even playing the format.... 
---
Please for the love of god just rotate the classic set. Spellstone was the only card that needed to be nerfed.
---
I hate Genn and Baku so much.....
---
The only viable aggro decks getting destroyed is nice? Lol?
---
You're right, he's a doofus. It's pretty straightforward.
---
Their recruits would now trade into your Lich king.
---
I agree it's still strong, there are just better ways they could have handeled pyro and equality, if thats what they were going for. Simply bringing pyro to 3, or maybe even 4 with adjusted stats, would have the same effect without nuking equality itself. Who knows it may still be popular.
---
I wouldn't call it good, more like it was just necessary. 
---
Any board clear that requires mutliple cards to pull off is pretty bad for most classes.
---
Was it cheap, yeah, but as a long time player I know the pain of losing games cause I didn't have both cards in first fifteen cards. Now it's just way worse because you need to have a combo of cards plus a bunch of Mana.
---
Basically you are screwed now because you can't really even justify mulliganing for it as it will clog up your hand until about one or two turns too late to even be effective.
---
Interesting times.
---
I answered the other guy but I can definitely name a few mainstream decks that didn't run those cards.
---
Kingsbane Rogue, Quest Rogue, Mill Rogue were all mainstream and didn't run Cold Blood. (I believe in Jade Rogue and Miracle it was optional)
---
Control Shaman/Shudderwock/Malygos OTK Shaman were also all mainstream at some point and didn't use Flametongue.
---
This game would be 10x better if they just straight up removed Genn and Baku and all the synergy cards. How many nerfs have happened solely because of those two cards? Ffs
---
I've been playing a ton of anyfin paladin lately. This hurts real bad. 
---
For how strong it is, do you think it needs a nerf? (Moving it to 2 mana from 1?) Or is it balanced?
---
I almost cried...I shed a tear at the end of S1E9 though...
---
I'm pretty salty about equality, I love control Paladin...
---
Your opponent should've played around it.
---
But it's CONDITIONAL - twisting nether is one card, pyro/equality and equality/consecration are very specific combos. A one card "discard a random card in your hand" doesn't have the same requirements.
---
I stead of changing the even and old legendarys they choose to nerf the cards around it, this makes no sense 
---
Oh yeah, it's not an unbeatable deck at all, control and AoE are still huge problems, and once Rexxar rotates it'll go down a tier or two. 
---
It is playable on ladder and is being brought to every tournament. So yes it is both.
---
And it was good enough to be included in every paladin deck since the dawn of time.
---
Again I don't think it's broken, it's just to good for the classic set, thus overshining the new cards. 
---
Yeah but you wouldn't run equality in aggro deck just to trade.
---
Funny how all the meta defining cards and decks are from the expansions of 2017 and a couple (genn/baku especially) from 2018.
---
Yeah, sure let's blame the staleness on classic set because the devs said so.
---
Uh, Even Hunter is bad and will be worse than DK and Zul‚Äôjin dude. Just because you can play Genn doesn‚Äôt mean you should.
---
Please Blizz, give me back old Starving Buzzard and Unleash the Hounds. I feel the pain of Patch 1.0.0.4217 to this day still. 
---
I actually can't wait to see Kibler's video on this. Each time it happens it just validates the last video, and in each new video he's more and more like "guys what have i been saying?".
---
I feel like his latest video can be 10 seconds and him just shrugging and giving a full grinned Kibler laugh.
---
Question is, how did OP lose?
---
The same ones suggested in the last 20 threads of the same topic, that'll be again suggested tomorrow.
---
If you look at blizzard's response, they don't disclose rates, they disclose expected outcomes which are different.
---
Enough 1/1s. Muster. There's been decks that don't run consec or pyro with equality in the past.
---
Yeah I am running into a lot of that shit. Honestly I complained about Emerald Spellstone for the past few days because that card fucks me so hard. 5 Mana get 4 3/3s is dumb af. I ran priest for a while because their cards have largely been unphased by all the nerfing of classic cards and basic set. Thoughtsteal can still get me some OP cards. However it's frustrating because holy Nova does nothing against that. Cabal Shadow Priest can do anything either 
---
Instead of nerfing Baku and Genn, which are 2 cancers of this game; is it better to nerf a lot of classic/basic cards?
---
It doesnt make any sense for me.
---
Which truly amazes me is the stubbornness of Blizzard avoiding DKs nerfs, its unveliable they are going to rotate without any nerf/change.
---
This was my first thought as well.  Hunter's Mark secretly buffed so it can fit with even hunter, lol.
---
They should have nerfed Rexxar-that sort of infinite value generation will make traditional control decks that care about resource management obsolete in wild
---
Or just current/formerMagic players who have seen the benefits to having a rotating core set.
---
As soon as a rotation was announced, we knew Classic would be come a problem. Stuff like this, or even just overall staleness. It needs to go.
---
Hello...
---
[["Little Friend"]]
---
Cold Blood was way too good in wild Odd rogue
---
Can someone explain the equality nerf to me? Historically it's always been balanced. It hasn't even been in most paladin decks historically, even then sometimes it was only good enough to include one copy. So I don't understand why it is receiving a 2 mana nerf, did something happen while I was asleep and paladins took over the meta? Equality made them broken or something? I'm just very confused, can anyone explain? Thanks
---
It‚Äôs official.  Welcome to nerfstone.  
---
That's a yikes and an oof from me. 
---
Yeah that's what I thought too. That's the only nerf I feel ruins the card but there wasn't much they could do since at 3 odd pala could be rather problematic with that board clear added.
---
Yikes...I haven't even played, seen, or even heard about Heartstone for months until reading this new update. I gotta say, it's pretty damn shady of them to nerf classic cards in order to make them sell cards from other expansions. I'm just glad I don't have any incentive to hopping back on to play this game let alone spending a single penny on their packs. Just doesn't seem worth it anymore :/.
---
@ArPak Even shaman is the second strongest deck after Odd rogue ATM
---
Don't forget wild pyromancer.  Still a 6 mana board clear instead of 4.
---
A weapon that can be removed and has limited charges plus a gimmicky OTK vs an unsilenceable lifesteal aura + infinite generation? 
---
Ok. 
---
Ok maybe yeah but equality going up a full 2 mana? Really?
---
That‚Äôs jut the game telling you it‚Äôs time to go make dinner or something. 
---
But they have to nerf okay evergreen cards that are made strong by op current cards that will rotate, it's the blizzard way. 
---
And when the staple cards are part of the problem, HS should rightfully leverage its digital card featureset and do something about it.
---
Blizzard has sat on its laurels and not changed cards for 6+ months. They are making more frequent changes and its needed for the long-term health of the game.
---
Reliable or otherwise, players will adapt to the changes. Classic cards - all too many of them - are a problem. We need a better long-term solution soon, even if it means something like a rotating yearly Core Set or do away with Classic entirely.
---
They already do the "a new board clear every three sets" thing with Priest because of their crap basic set.  I can only imagine how many Pally will need to get to compensate.
---
Wasn't Mind Blast run in KFT/KnC Razakus Priest?
---
Starving Buzzard and Warsong Commander were done before hall of fame was introduced, so it'd be fair for them to return there. But stuff like Equality or Wild Growth still fits in Standard and can still be usable in the future.
---
oops, lol
---
Even paladin is and will be extremely strong after the rotation. Now if even paladin loses the board they are not able to easily comeback, equality was nerfed with that in mind. Plus control paladin was never a thing so I don‚Äôt think this nerfs were for that.
---
Amusingly, that highlights one of the key skills of any card game.  Recognizing and responding to your own state of mind.  Everyone tilts, recognizing and counteracting to it has a massive affect on win rate.
---
Psychic scream is a bad card if they've got something game-winning like Shudderwock on board, since they get to play it again. It's also terrible when approaching fatigue.
---
They should change Genn and Baku to ‚ÄúWhen you draw this‚Äù instead of ‚ÄòStart of Game‚Äô
---
Well, 1 more year and 3 expansions to go...
---
A 2 card entire board clear for 4 Mana or opponent board clear for 2 card/6 Mana that still leaves sticky minions/deathrattles up, seems perfectly balanced (as it has been since vanilla). I don't understand the equality nerf.
---
But that's exactly the point of the basic set. It gives each class a solid base to build upon, without having to worry about losing everything when rotation hits. Look at Priest for example: each expansion they have to hope they get a strong enough board clear to stay relevant, resulting in cards like Duskbreaker and Psychic Scream. Nerfs to basic Druid cards has completely gimped the class, and all their strong &amp; problematic cards like UI, plague, and paths will rotate in a couple months.
---
Strong basic cards shouldn't be a problem. And Equality or Flametongue Totem didn't appear in every single Paladin or Shaman list. Imagine Hunter without Kill Command or Animal Companion, which are almost always in hunter decks. Or Mage without Fireball or Blizzard or Flamestrike. Warlock without Hellfire.
---
So now you have to wait for each expansion and hope your class gets decent tools to replace Classic cards, and that you can actually open/afford them. Blizzard has shot themselves in the foot by presenting Basic/Classic as an evergreen set where your cards are safe, and then nerfing core 6 core Classic cards in the last 2 months.

Nah, I read them. But if they are able to nerf Emerald Spellstone they are clearly able to nerf non-classic and basic set cards. Like I don't even know what backwards logic you have to have implanted in your brain to see them nerf a non-classic/basic card and then use "W-well of course they aren't nerfing that! It isn't a non-classic/basic card!"
---
"staple deck that sees play in every Priest deck". Stuff like spiteful priest existed back then, but I understand what you mean.
---
It's actually okay for there to be worse versions of cards that already exist.
---
Cube, probably, as per the action bar and the fact that two of them have the same amount of stats
---
With all the downvotes on comments agreeing with my post, I can see that you all probably mained that deck while it was in the rotation. 
---
equality nerf is oof
---
I get the spellstone being nerfed, but its in the same section as "these classic cards are preventing newer cards from being played in every deck".
---
Its from a expansion, and only works in decks running secrets.  Its clearly not being nerfed under the same philosophy. 
---
This is essentially the same as the Rockbiter nerf, but years later.
---
I've actually done it many times as a paladin with the Spikeridged Steed. If I had none of these, I would 100% die, but my wr against mecha'thun druid and warlock pretty good ONLY because of the Steed. 
---
Example: 
---
You don't want to always play DK on 6 though. I have won many times as priest when I'm at 15 life t6 and he plays DK even though he would have almost certainly won if he kept pressuring me with normal hero power. 
---
To be fair, while I agree that nerfing other cards for the sake of Genn/Baku (and I really really really hate this set of nerfs.. Cold Blood hasn't been a Rogue staple for its entire existence, it drifts in and out of meta as a powerful option that not all decks want to run which is EXACTLY where you want the powerlevel of a card to be) isn't good, you literally can't meaningfully nerf Genn/Baku. You could make Genn a 10 mana 1/1 and Baku a 9 mana 1/1 and people would still play them for their effect. You can't nerf Genn's buff to hero powers since there's no integer between 1 and 2. You can't nerf Baku's upgraded HP values because in most cases, there's no integer between 1 and 2, or there's no integer between 2 and 3. The only upgraded hero powers that can be nerfed are Warrior (4&gt;3), Warlock(costs 0 life to costing 1 life), and priest (4&gt;3), and of those archetypes only 1 actually plays Baku so it wouldn't affect the other prominent Baku decks like Odd Rogue/Pally. Making the minions have completely awful bodies would be a slight nerf to the powerlevel of the deck, but it wouldn't have much of an impact on how the deck is played out. 
---
I really despise these nerfs, and I despise even more their reasoning, which is just comnpletely fucking untrue. Cold Blood has never been an auto include, it doesn't fit in every Rogue deck, it's just a card that fits really well with aggro rogue's gameplan. Flametongue totem? Same deal, it goes in a lot of midrange or aggressive shamans, but it doesn't go into every shaman list. Equality was an auto include in midrange/control pally (although again, not in every paladin archetype) but that's since it's their only real way to interact with large minions and they've had more or less no viable alternatives for their entire existence. 
---
Any reason why they aren't just making it so that Genn and Baku has to be on your opening hand in mulligan?
---
It's so annoying to see all these pretty well designed cards just go to the dumbster, in a few years there will be literally only Minion cards.
---
I don't understand the cold blood nerf, a conditional 4 attack buff for 1 Mana is perfectly in line with paladin blessing of might an unconditional 3 attack buff for 1 Mana. So why was one touched but not the other??
---
Appropriate reaction.
---
$$$$$
---
&gt; This game is basically a total RNG fest and roll of the dice
---
Not sure I'm the one forcing narratives here. Out of curiosity, what's the highest rank you've achieved?
---
I was fooling around with even hunter before and you are right but it will be a little slow without subject 9  
---
My only hope is if they go with the core set method, Killing classic/basic, We better get the entire core set 100% of it free every rotation akin to how the basic set is no undustable.
---
I think you answered your own question.  If Equality was changed from 2 to 3, it would be a viable option for Odd Paladin.  They didn't want to reinforce an already hated archetype, so they moved it from 2 to 4 instead.
---
I agree with the nerfs. The only bad news is that the ressurect Priest will continue it's long reign in Wild.
---
Cold Blood: OCD: Finally the last 1 mana 4 damage card to be nerfed in standart.
---
Flametongue Totem: Played with it and against it. If you could not remove it on the turn it was palyed, you could easily loose. I hope it is gone now.
---
Equality: I hated the eficence of Wild Pyromancer + Equality combo. Too cheap and effective in my opinion.
---
Hunters Mark: It was a too effective removal. Like Execute was before the nerf.
---
Emerald Spellstone: Hopefully we will see less of it now. Turn 5, 4 wolves where brutal. I would even have preferred it to be 7 mana now, but this might be tierness of the card speaking.
---
Iskar is off the rails. "We must consider the players who only ever play classic decks". Like what? That's who we should balance the game for?
---
Also, isn't that why they created wild? So the people who don't ever get new card still can play...

Ok, but why did equality deserve a nerf? Also my comment was more asking why genn and Baku haven't been nerfed yet, and instead a ton of support cards have been obliterated
---
I can see why you would want to use either of them in different situations even if they cost the same tbh
---
Great nerfs. Unpopular opinion here but I think all cards are still viable. 
---
Cold blood at 2 mana can be run in tempo decks. 
---
Flame tongue would be only run in token decks and still seems pretty strong. 
---
Equality would see play in control paladins but won‚Äôt see play in midrange decks such as even paladin since it‚Äôs to slow. 
---
Hunter‚Äôs mark seems pretty strong still but not that strong. 
---
Spell stone is still pretty good it gives most decks another turn to answer a huge board which is good. 
---
All around great nerfs though the problem still is on 2 cards. Baku and Genn. These nerfs wouldn‚Äôt be done if this 2 cards didn‚Äôt exists. Change to a battlecry lower the mana a bit and kill those archetypes. They were a mistake from the beginning.
---
I'm just sad about Cold Blood nerf since it was always a nice help for some selfmade OTK decks, atleast it's only 2 mana thus making it kind of bad for aggro
---
I honestly only want odd pally to stay just because wacky cards will keep seeing play. If you had told anyone wich's cauldron would see play in a Tier 1 deck no one would have belived you.
---
you're an intellectual
---
Cold Blood is way too strong at 1 Mana. The amount of damage that rogue can do in the first couple of turns is simply too much..
---
Do you not consider odd rogue or odd paladin to be aggro? They can kill you extremely quickly.
---
Said it before but I would like to see a lot more of:
---
- Promotions and sales(which they are doing with Lunar festival, so that's s start)
---
- More methods via social media to "like" Blizzard franchises and such to gain extra packs
---
- Watching Hearthstone streams on twitch to gain packs
---
- More achievements to unlock to gain packs
---
In short, more ways to gain packs that don't cost money. Give people more external methods to gain packs.
---
They really need to remake the core set and balance classes. They have some parity (most classes have a ‚Äú1mana: deal 2‚Äù and ‚Äú2mana: deal 2-4‚Äù type spell but they need a bit more rounded core sets for the basis of each class and then allow the expansion sets add set specific designs over top of that skeleton. They shouldn‚Äôt have to make spells to shore up a class‚Äô weakness each year but a new card that does something they can already do but in a new unique way.
---
Best solution is to remove the evergreen sets entirely
---
Ahhh, yeah, ok that makes a lot of sense.
---
Equality is one of those cards (like Hunter‚Äôs Mark) that was revoltingly undercosted at the launch of the game.  With this change, Hunter‚Äôs Mark and Equality are back to being 2 mana apart like they were at launch (and honestly, Equality is probably still the better card).
---
Really, the only impact on standard control lists I expect to see from this will be like...instead of control paladins running one shrink ray and two equalities, now they‚Äôll run two shrink rays and one equality.
---
(I do feel bad for wild control players, though; equality was one of the best clears in wild).
---
Ask *Shadowverse* players if they think it's "stupid".
---
I think you'll have quite a few disagree.
---
This is a buff to faster Shirvala!
---
So disappointed with the equality nerf. I don't think I have ever found that card to be oppressive when used against me. While it is on the strong side, it was not oppressive. I could have lived with a nerf to 3 mana, but 4 mana is ridiculously expensive.
---
Hey the didn't nerf the rogue yogg (forgot the name of the card) because of public outrage, so maybe there is still a chance blizzard won't kill control paladin. 
---
Says the guy who wants to in-depth argue for the validity of Candleshot.
---
Oh you do lose some, yes. But there are still class-specific cards to be found with each expansion.
---
Just because *you* don't care for the format doesn't mean other people don't enjoy it.
---
Does anyone have any idea what the equality nerf was for? The only paladin deck which sees any play in the current meta is odd and last time I checked equality wasn‚Äôt a key card to that deck‚Äôs strategy so why on Earth nerf it?
---
There is no such thing as "wild nerf" when we talk about standart cards since playerbase for standart are 10 times bigger. It's clearly prediction nerf for next expansion.  They could nerf wild cards (7/7, thing from below) if they wanted to nerf wild.
---
MIDRANGE EVEN HUNTER
---
You're my hero. 
---
This seems like a consistent thing with the team.  They nerf classic/basic cards that have been reasonable for years and are only just now playing really well with set cards that are about to rotate forever.  The same really applies to cold blood; odd rogue is losing dire mole soon. 
---
What are you talking about? These nerfs will affect some of the best current decks. But on top of that, they're about more than just the current meta since most of these are Classic and Basic cards.

Spellstone is going to be six after the update, so that helps a lot. The bigger question for Even Secret Hunter is why even be an even deck? I'm not quite sure why you would want a 1 mana hero power. Secret Hunter isn't aggro right now and I don't see how making it Even helps at all.
---
Yes! My wild even hunter can finally use the spellstone!!!!
---
If you don‚Äôt like fire why do you play with it?
---
RIP
---
Not willing to dust ALL of my cards...
---
That would be hilarious
---
Literally why could it not be a wild nerf now, power curb for potential problems later?
---
It is a wild targeted nerf, because shaman is not prevalent in standard right now.
---
Hunter got hit big time same with even pally/Otk decks.  The latter doesn‚Äôt have early board clears and can‚Äôt play as greedy vs the aggro decks anymore.
---
Well my point is, if the Classic set cards are not strong, why bother having an evergreen set at all? Just rotate it all out in that case.
---
Especially if Midrange Hunter is going to be the new face of the meta.  Most of its bad matchups were nerfed, the only ones untouched are Odd Pally, Odd Mage, and Odd Warrior.
---
God, I hope Odd Warrior doesn't come back into the meta.  That deck is horrible to play against.
---
Shrink ray is one less mana and one less card... as long as your opponent doesn't have anything important on the board like a malygos, and doesn't have a board-wide buff in hand, and can't finish you on limited pressure.
---
I also like shrink ray -&gt; stonehill or something... but that does cost more.
---
Ok, instead of calling you names, I'll explain to you retards why each of those cards are broken. Ziliax is auto include in every non aggro deck right now because it does everything, it's a removal spell, broken heal, taunt and even magnetic is an issue. Whenever you play an aggro deck, and you see Zilliax, you are forced to concede on the spot. You lost automatically. Voidlord is broken because it's 6/18 for 9 mana and it spawns over and over again. If you refuse to believe that's broken, you're braindead. Mass Hysteria is same shit as Brawl, meaning it's broken beyond belief. Plus RNG board clear is such atrocious game design. Control decks right now are so broken because you can just put 20 board clears and 10 proactive cards. That's a problem. If you don't see it as a problem, you are nothing but a biased player. And so what if aggro has been complained about the most? You know who complained the most? Fucking Kripp, the most delusional and biased player ever who believes he's hot shit, but he's so garbage, it hurts to watch him. People will blindly follow this dude, who doesn't know what he's saying, then they'll repeat the same shit he's saying, of course, now knowing what they're saying. And this is a problem.
---
Go fuck yourself. 
---
No one is attacking you, don‚Äôt take things so personally. I think it‚Äôs pretty cool that Hodor and hold the door are basically the same in Italian. 
---
That said, the books were written in English, and that correlation was likely unintended. That‚Äôs all anyone is trying to say. 
---
I don‚Äôt get the hate from Blizzard to aggro decks. It‚Äôs in a terrible overall state right now but they just hammer the whole idea. It feels like the time they just kept nerfing combo again and again.
---
Nerfing Flametongue Totem? What the actual fuck? 
---
The only one of those changes that feels acceptable is increasing Emerald Spellstone by 1 mana. 
---
blizzard are you ok
---
&gt;crucial for every viable rogue deck
---
You answered your own question. Blizz stated in the article that that's exactly why these cards are getting nerfed. I don't like it either, but I at least get their reasoning this time.
---
I said *like* all of your cards.  I have dusted every legendary, epic, and half my rares multiple times.
---
This would have been a much better change - requiring 4 secrets to get 4 wolves.
---
Totally agree, thank fuck for Auto Chess to slowly consume my life the same way Hearthstone once did. 
---
Nah, it doesn't make up for the majority of wins and losses and for anyone who says otherwise is just patting themselves on the back.
---
Completely agree with you. 
---
Ah at last one of your posts got the attention it deserves ^^
---
The only issue is even Hunter would run DK Rexxar which nullifies the Genn effect.
---
I just checked the stats and all big priest decks in the top 20 of highest winrate decks use barnes.
---
Except Priest. Apparently Blizzard really likes us right now.
---
Why 8 mana? Isn‚Äôt it 6?
---
Secrets, spellstone, two hero cards are all you really need. Throw in some other nonsense and done deal. 
---
Wild has always been intended as a dumping ground.
---
So we‚Äôll all get full dust for kalimos then?
---
What the fuck
---
Just play that peanut shaman haha
---
Is this purely for meta shaking purpose, or is there some design space arrangement for cards of the next xpack already going on?
---
Unless I missed something, subject 9 and eaglehorn bow are still odd and are a huge part of secret hunter.
---
These two can‚Äôt exist together. You can‚Äôt have a classic set returning players can rely on AND get rid of all the good common and rare cards in that set. Then you just have a pile of mostly garbage with a few good epics and legendaries that requires 25 of the cards from current rotation to make a decent deck, and then it is no longer useful for returning players.
---
I'll take playable in one format over playable in zero formats.
---
My opponent was playing Mecha'thun freeze mage, so from turn 2 onwards my whole board was frozen every turn. After a Hemet on 6 I knew I was going to lose anyway so I just began stacking up void anomalies to see how big I could go
---
This is correct. Pala removals are absolute garbage and Equality has been the crutch for a long time now. This latest change makes it so you absolutely have to hold on to the board pre t6 when you can Pyro+Eq which severely dents Control Pala even more.
---
Just to be clear we are talking about a childrens card game you play on your phone or tablet but ok mate I see your point also
---
Because then you need the card to do something in the same nature as the previous card. You can't just make it like "Heal your hero" because that doesn't make sense with the card.
---
Also it's easier to completely trash a card rather than making it to something else. Because if you make it sightly too powerful without any playtesting, then you're back to square 1.
---
_Hello hello hello hello..._
---
I either like or can tolerate most of the changes but equality? That makes me both sad and angry.
---
It‚Äôs sad because sure pyro/cons + equality is strong, sure, but it‚Äôs a two card combo (and there‚Äôs plenty of other very powerful things you can do with a two card combo) and it was THE paladin board clear. Now paladins have either twisting nether or sort-of lightbomb, but it‚Äôs a two card combo and takes twice as much deck space as either of those. What‚Äôs paladin supposed to do against aggro before turn 6? Tar creeper is rotating out so everyone‚Äôs much worse at stalling now. Do all slow/control paladins have to run doomsayer and double righteous protector now? I can only hope this means blizzard must be about to print a strong paladin board clear and this nerf is to pre-empt that.
---
It makes me angry because as many others have said, this nerf is clearly massively influenced by genn and baku. Nerfing classic cards because of the influence of temporary cards is a worrying bad balancing method.
---
An non-immunity Candleshot would maybe see play in Spell Hunter where they have limited early game options. As it stands now, it sees play in all-Hunter decks. And actually pretty much every weapon gets run in Hunter because they want to have ways to interact with the board and preserve minions. But this is going to be too in-depth for you to understand, because all you can do is go "worse than light's justice."
---
In the past 2 years control and to a part midrange paladin is the only thing I played. Got legend multiple times with it and all other times rank 5. I cant understand this and I dont believe it. I dont even play any mainstream paladin decks. Never did. Always control and midrange. No baku, no pirate or Murloc. My decklist has like 9 standard and 7 wild paladin decks. I haven't played for a month and I'm not sure if it's worth trying after this.
---
Cold Blood has been a problem for them for ages. It was what enabled Rogues to OTK in every archetype bar the Malygos one from Leeroy to a number to other charge minions
---
You're absolutely right. Tunnel visioned on the OTK decks, but Rexxar is also forcing out grindy stuff.
---
&gt; on the flip side, if say a card like Healing Rain was in Hunter's basic set, we'd rather rotate that than nerf it. Hunters shouldn't be about big healing spells.
---
this is confusing: each class's identity is dictated by their core set so if healing rain was in hunter's core set then healing would 100% be part of their personality. 
---
just look at the converse, priest which is supposed to be all about healing and yet we have a card that can literally only be used for combo burn decks in the core set
---
Wizards of the Coast (the guys who do Magic: The Gathering) running into some tough competition in the field of terrible decisions
---
make genn a 9 mana 1/1 and baku a 10 mana 1/1
---
Nice to hear that you're having such a fun time! I honestly think that the deck has the potential to be tier 1 next expansion, and right now it's still pretty good. Hooktusk is an obscenely good card. It can struggle a bit against Odd Rogue, but it performs excellently against non-secret Hunter.
---
The cold blood nerf is gonna hurt, but Hunter is gonna become even more prevalent after it, since control Paladin archetypes are gonna get nerfed super hard. One way or another, Leeroy and Southsea Captain are still classic cards that have seen LOTS of play for a long time and won't ever rotate out, so they are safe crafts. Lich King not so much since he'll be rotating with the next expansion. Gral has definitely worked for me as a tempo efficient draw, so I would consider keeping him.
---
Have fun!
---
shaman got trampling for no reason, mean while 'resurrect priest' gonna be supper toxic
---
answer. just quit hearthstone
---
&gt;
---
Priest has had this as a chronic issue from day one, and it can only be fixed by adding the missing core cards INTO the basic/classic set
---
Weirdly I just got back into the game after missing two expansions and could build the Resurrection priest easily as I got the legendary spell in my free packs and had everything else
---
So a core set, but Blizzard gets free money for reprinting boring staple cards to gum up packs.... 
---
What is it?
---
Wild is the place to gauge the power level of a card because every card or synergy in wild needs to be busted. 
---
Odd and even decks have been tier 1 in wild since their inception. 
---
Baku and Genn are the failures, there's nothing wrong with classic
---
It's been there, but it hasn't really been meta, has it?
---
It‚Äôs not losing argent squire.
---
I tried to guess what these nerfs were going to be before clicking on the link... 
---
I can't believe that neither Rexxar or Zul'jin were touched. I thought there was also a decent chance that Mind Blast was nerfed to 3 mana. All of these changes are really weird to me other than Hunter Spellstone. I didn't realize they were that oppressive. 
---
I actually played against you as well. 
---
Given that between the release of Naxx up until roughly the Witchwood, aggressive decks have consistently been **the** force forming almost every single format, it make sense that Team 5 would probably like to see the game head into a different direction, and try to create more balanced formats generally that are made up of more than aggressive decks and the decks that seek to counter those aggressive decks.
---
There's a Dragon Shaman variant with Zihi&amp;Shudderwock that can at least hold it's own against Combo decks.
---
Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
---
Maybe their effect can include a downside? Max health is set to 25? Lose a mana crystal or health when the card is drawn? Three random cards in the deck cost +3 mana?
---
No probs, just trying to help! And there‚Äôs the semi cheap odd rogue without some of the legendaries but I don‚Äôt know if people still run that. If you look on hearthpwn or similar sites you‚Äôll be able to look at a giant list of decks people have built and if you just put the keyword ‚Äúbudget‚Äù in the filter a bunch of decks will come up and you can pick any of your fancy, their not really meta decks but can help you climb as a new player. There are the rare budget decks that will let you climb to high ranks posted there.
---
Yuuuup. Some staple cards I honestly think are fine to have around forever if they arent oppresive. Control/midrange paladin hasnt been tier 1 since before the first standard rotation , I'd doubt anyone would argue its an overpowered archtype.
---
Well, now we are guaranteed to never see a control paladin in the top of the meta, unless Blizzard FORCES it to happen by printing UI, Spreading Plague, Drakonid Operator and Dragonfire Potion level bullshit. In which case I have little belief blizzard would be able to do without making it a Shaman Tier in Karazhan.
---
RIP midrange and control paladin, the next time we see you, Itll be 2021 at the earliest.
---
But hey, at least we have Genn and Baku so we can use our hero power and maybe even a couple of cards in your deck to win 56% of your games. Fuck Genn and Baku. 
---
&gt; Wow. It‚Äôs been a while since I last saw someone fail this utterly to understand.
---
&gt; The base definition for auto include, in a card game, is a card so fundamentally and widely good that it goes in all archetypes be it aggro, tempo, combo, control, even though it doesn‚Äôt have any special synergies. 
---
And with this I can stop reading further.
---
The lack of understanding is on your end, not mine. I already addressed this in great detail. This definition is so limited as to be unhelpful. Useless.
---
Do you know how many "strictly" Auto-Include cards there are in the game? Let alone in Classic and Basic? I'd guess less than 15. So you go ahead and make a comprehensive list of cards you deem to be "Auto Include" and I'll *happily* apply your psychotically narrow definition to show you just how useless it is.
---
Until then, see ya jackass.
---
Woooow, they didn't even kill equality, they Thanos snapped out our of existence
---
Baku and genn are also, like, must-craft legendaries, and they make free to play MUCH harder. I think when we have a discussion about Baku and Genn, or of the Classic set, we do need to consider the economic aspect of these cards and how they shape free to play, and the economy of the game in general.
---
dusted all my cards and made golden nat pagle and milhouse, keep nerfing what used to be the only good purchase in this game, and the only thing that would keep their classes feeling like actual wow classes 
---
This, it's a straight buff to the card.
---
**Format:** Wild (Year of the Raven)
