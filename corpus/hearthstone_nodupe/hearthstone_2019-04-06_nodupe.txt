No, I'm aware. It just didn't sound like an actual character's name at first.

Thanks!

And here I was thinking it was the dangling orphan

Hm? You can open the packs even if it's unlisted? When I try creating a gathering it grays out the event option if you set it to unlisted
---
I doubt midrange hunter will ever go away since we will have the lynx for another year
---
Uh, have you seen some of the legendaries in hearthstone?
---
With or without the sarcasm, I dont see why the MAIN MENU needs a change in order to be "new" and "fresh" to players. 
---

---
It has always been a staple in my Hearthstone experience. I mean how many classic games do you return to and expect that nostalgic screen to pop up for a greeting? 
---
This is a really... really bad shit post. Come on now...
---
O I thought this is the free legendary I got from the preordered packs...
---
Prediction: Dr. Boom will get a reduction by half of the number of boom bots he summons. One per bomb in deck instead of two. 
---
Give it, oh, 5 months. Maybe 6. 
---
aahhh man I can't fireside so my packs are closed  but I'd say this guy is number 3 on my list. congrats,

I got  a golden Nomi, Madam Lazu and Hagata from 50packs.

It can take some getting used to, but what it comes down to is that Magic cards need to be clear enough that you only need the card itself in order to understand what it does. Hearthstone gets to cheat by offloading a lot of the weird edge cases into the programming, so it can be more concise with its card text.
---
needs more deck of wonders
---
135 new cards, 80 packs = 400 cards. So on average you would get 3-4~ of each card, but since rarity is a thing you just end up getting way more commons

Trading 80g quest. I show it, but you go first (check my history, no scammerino).
---
who  cares you were playing big rogue and you probably play some mill shit so yeah I agree with the guy
---
And now I have seen it all on this subreddit..
---
As someone that tried mtg after already investing into hearthstone, the cards themselves were the biggest hurdle for me. 
---
But that is a good point, it would be kinda weird for every one to carry their decks and a rulebook of sorts just to explain what the cards are trying to say 
---
2 of mine were Lucentbark and chef Nomi. 
---
I want to see an format where every card is allowed and unnerfed. In a format like that, I feel like Baku isn't an issue.
---
Still probably too slow to be great, but it's a good change to bring Warsong Commander out of the garbage
---
I wish they would do a format where it's the newest set, plus 3 random past sets that switches every month.
---
'Yeet' is pronunciation of a Turkish male name 'Yiğit' which means stout-hearted/brave/daring man
---
Hah ! I tried it an hour ago at a gathering. This one is fantastic.
---
I mean, that's assuming I have no collection to work with. I've been playing since right before KotFT was released, only ever preordered one expansion (was NOT worth the money, at all) and bought all other expansions with gold saved up. I've got 55 legendaries, many of which are rotating, so I'll be dusting most of my now wild cards as needed. 
---
Anyway, there's always some t1/t2 decks that only run one or two legendaries. Not every meta deck costs 15k dust. 
---
Mtga or offline?
---
Cash prize lmao.
---
All the things we could have if we did not need to have the game work on phones as well. 
---
I play on 7 different accounts
---
Band name dibs
---
Nobody is playing one health minions because mono-white is totally not a thing, I suppose? Oh wait, it is and it is playing a lot of those (but I agree that this card is most probably not gonna be maindeck anytime soon)
---
Problem is that do nothing on it's own
---
I highly recommend Eternal. Similar enough to Magic that its easy to pick up if you're already familiar, enough differences in the ways cards interact and colors are divided to feel fresh, and lots of cool keywords and abilities that can only work in an electronic game format. 
---
Death Knights, Genn and Baku have made these last 2 years miserable. One Card should determine if you win or lose a game in terms of DKs. Priest, Warlock, Druid, and Hunter DKs while every other deck that cant use the DK effectively or the hero power effectively fell to the way side for the most part. Also while we are at it, psychic scream and masters call can also die.
---
Fortunately Aunt May and Uncle Ben stepped up to raise him.
---
^/s
---
They’d lose money on this in the long run. Also, if players had every card there would be no reason for gold or arena
---
thanks for reminder
---
It summons oger 
---
I don't think it's possible to know that easily cause when you sort the collection by Rise of Shadows and then hit crafting to see what's missing, it doesn't show you anything. The collection is blank.

No, only fake is fake.

Yea, I’m excited for res priest and burgle rogue. Still looking for lists tho

In that situation, you have more pressing matters than a 30 armor druid.

I agree. This requires a gambling licence. It is possible to do this. The game has the potential to be more enjoyable with real cash money and tournaments. Like I said there are already some gambling companies organizing online HS tournament with real cash prize and entry. I think  [https://play.battleriff.com/](https://play.battleriff.com/)  is one of them.

I would suggest looking at the new expansion before making your decision.

Do the pre-order!
---
I don't get it.
---
I don't normally watch these because they don't affect me or my collection but I have a 50 pack Bundle 30 Packs with gold and a freebie (81) and want some assurence I have not burned my cash. Wished it was 80 packs and not 50 bundle but ho hum.
---
I love that Lezav is Kreko's accomplice. Maybe Kreko had been Lezav that whole time!
---
Take it easy buddy, they are just talking about the metagame overall. Most of the creature decks *still* aren't that vulnerable to Massacre Girl, and if she sees play then mono white will adapt and drop 1-toughness guys or play spells the pump their team's butts to avoid a cascade of triggers from Massacre Girl.
---
how does that work? so they’ll be able to play with the new cards already? 
---
she's WORKING ON IT!
---
Wonder what your opponent saw... Someone needs to test this for science
---
They could very easily have 1 solo purchaseable per expansion and 1 with packs, and 1 freebie! They are already getting VAs for most legendaries, in all languages.
---
They could have the exclusive hero become available when their expansion rotates out. They could have different versions of existing hero portraits. They could include just announcer packs for existing heroes. (E.g., Anduin on a bender, Pool Party Garrosh, fast talking Valeera)
---
They could have an alternate hero unlock at 500 wins in any class, and then you can grind to 5000 to get that one in golden.
---
They could do all the options!

I came back after spending quite a bit of time away. Went all in on a golden whizbang and only play that while I build up a collection
---
Eh, green has largely fallen out of the meta atm though.  It's not completely gone, but it had basically no representation in the recent invitational.
---
That is mostly what I do lol. It’s a lot of fun 
---
That Tak animation needs to be fixed, it is so slow. 
---
also they are working on blitz which is supposed to be permanent
---
5 Mana 4 4
---
3 Mana 2/2 warrior mech, battlecry and deathrattle: deal 1 damage to all other minions.
---
&gt;Will it be better than Midrange/Battlecry Shaman? Probably not. 
---
You are probably right but after trying out the murloc deck at a gathering today I am quite hyped by the spell that gives your minions "deathrattle summon a 1/1 murloc". The opponent needs to clear the board twice to not get bloodlusted, and defile rotates...
---
&gt;that would make a hand/board refill far more possible
---
Board yes but hand ? You would need the 2/3 mentionned by OP and one other murloc, as well as 6+ mana. And you would only get one random murloc in hand.
---
&gt;The biggest hit to this deck is the rotation of Ice Fishing.
---
Personnally I can live without, I prefer Tastyfin for tutoring. I will miss Brrrloc, Gentle Megasaur and the Quest though.
---
For clarfication "anything can Happen"+your birthday... You get it now?
---
Yes. Now I got it. 
---
I don't like Arena but love collecting as many cards as I can. Is this value worth it for me? (he said in bad actor commercial voice)
---
Thank God. No one wanted freeze shaman and it's a terrible idea. 
---
Same here...
---
Yep, and that's why I will never return to Hearthstone.
---
These are cool! Did you print them out yourself or were they from Blizzard?
---
Better than it being a draft brawl in which you either can't really participate or a long game
---
Lol I haven't played in months and this is how I find hearthstone on my popular feed 😂😂😂
---
Because yogg is overrated
---
I pulled a golden Genn when witchwood was new, what an investment! 
---
Yeah but it made me chuckle for a second.
---
nice
---
His bomb warrior video, he played against another streamer who played a mage who got book of specters from magic trick, although the mage didn't draw a bomb....he asked this question too
---
Max dust: if you don't have them, craft golden. If you do have them, regular or golden, don't recraft them gold.
---
Don't bother with classic packs, the power level is useless and they never rotate meaning you can steadily build them up from tavern brawls. Expansion packs have way more powerful cards in them. 
---
They give you some free packs too
---
They can’t... 
---
Lack of minions usually does that. But that's how Yogg-Saron sometimes goes. :P 
---
I'm just surprised (*and relieved*) it didn't throw a single burn spell into my own face. It all managed to work out just enough.
---
I do agree however, I like when more spells actually go off and more crazy stuff happens xD
---
I’m just hoping I can use akali and that spell that lets minions damage adjacent minions. 
---
I miss playing the pre nerf Yogg in a 29 Spell deck, (or with Brann) so I made my own version. xD
---
IMO your missing out on the most fun part of HS, constructed. But hey if you like arena that much all the props to you, but constructed is where it’s at!
---
Is it currently broken and warping the game? No? Then it doesn't need to be nerfed. 
---
I meant that if you want to pull this combo off (Zilliax+Sweeping stikes) you need to wait till turn 7 and have these 2 cards in your hand by that time. So you either topdecked one of them, or you hold them in your hand not playing, making them "dead". Otherwise you just play Zilliax turn 5 but miss out on the combo. Dont forget that aggro could counter by having a taunt on the far left or far right, lowering the efficiency of this effect. Overall, I don't see this card being much stronger than Windfury, different effects, but overall the same powerlevel I'd say. Just my opinion.
---
Who is 1 and 2?
---
Get stabbed to death few seconds later
---
There is a card called Wild Growth??
---
Lol 9 mins as I open it I love it already 
---
I still don't see a bird... 
---
The fact you didn’t pick chronaggus, just to see what would happen with the Bible or wonders you had there 
---
For me, I wouldn't call it solving. A lot of the time it was "trial and error", more aptly though, it was hammering a screwdriver through a lock. I'm not ashamed to admit it, as the puzzles were all technically "solved"... Maybe not as gracefully as they should have been lol! 
---
Remember when I spent all that money on vanilla and gvg cards? Remember adding the wild/standard? Fuck yourself blizzard
---
I‘ll make my own Yogg...witch Blackjack and Hookers
---
now rarity is should be epic, becouse you're going to get a lot of armor from this.
---
There are 23 legendaries in the set. Getting 10/23 for a set that will be in standard for the next 2 years means that you will be able to play a lot of different potential archetypes for a while with those.
---
Lol, I was honestly thinking only of trying to get the most Attack/stats, so I close close out the game, I didn't even think of that potential outcome.
---
just wait for arena...
---
Playing Arcane Missles turn 1 to hit your opponent for 3 is yeeting them. Playing them turn 3 in response to a Muster for Battle and killing all 3 Silver Hand Recruits would be kobeing them.
---
F, but also thank god
---
first time playing TB?
---
play a deck that counters it?
---
Fishing trip it is then. 
---
Jesus man calm down,we are just suggesting moving to standard because that’s where the majority of the development is focused at,wild is well “wild” because they just dump all the old cards in there without a care for balance while they focus on standard more. If you still wanna play wild it’s entirely up to you and we can’t fault you,we are just recommending standard for a more balanced experience 
---
what about you?
---
Or burn spells to the face. Yogg was kind today xD
---
Maybe it's cause I'm wielding his cardback.
---
Some dreamers believe even innistrad will be included
---
Hes a streamer/speedrunner/kaizo mario player.
---
Looks awesome! 
---
first pic could be anything
---
Yogg is BACK on the menu boys! 
---
you're getting upset with him, but you're "drained" from playing against big priest in Wild.
---
Maybe he was kind of a dick with the delivery, but his reasoning is pretty spot on. 
---
I don't play wild because I don't find it enjoyable. You don't seem to either. Maybe get gud nub. I just don't think they're prioritizing Wild, so look elsewhere for enjoyment. 
---
Ok thanks
---
Your victory proves nothing indeed.
---
Yeah, it was more that this wasn't the Custom Hearthstone thread. So I don't think anybody here would understand what card Pandora's Tome is. 
---
I tried that deck too, it’s cool and all, but it’s very slow and can only deal 30 damage ( armor fucks you up, even that 5 armor from DKs)
---
)l
---
Oh shoot! XD
---
I totally mixed up the two threads, I'm sorry x_x
---
I'm a bit tired lol, thank you for correcting me.
---
??? How u get a golden pack?
---
I don't know yet. I think I'll give one last chance to the game. I'm so tired of playing against the same hunter, pally and OTK decks. It wouldn't be an issue if there would be more than 2-3 decks that counters them. That means I must play these few counter decks what is really boring and make me quit the game after a maximum of 3 game per day. 
---
Another very big problem that OTK and charge still exists. Maybe I'm just tired of playing HS but I is not surprising after 4 years of playing the game what did not really changed.  
---
Same client, same mechanics, nothing really determinative change. 
---
Okay they are adding some new keywords but the basics of the game is the same. Play cards and wait. The feeling when you have 30 hp and you can die in one turn due to a shitty OTK deck is just  simply bad. 
---
Same with aggro decks. I realized that I'm more satisfied after a game what was not about surviving the first 6 turn. 
---
I think the Reno meta was the most "feels good" period In my HS career. That was the best tool to operate with against aggros and other fast stuff. 
---
Overall I think the game needs some fresh air, deep changes in mechanics and some kind of tool to react to enemy plays . 
---
🎶MOUTHAF#*CKARS.... 🎶🎸🎸🎸🎸
---
LOL so subtle I almost thought it was real. 
---
Inner fire priest. With the addition of mana reservoir we now have a 0/6 2 drop in addition to the 0/5 lightwell. If you have an inner fire/divine spirit in hand, you can then turn it into a 10/10 or 12/12 on turn 3. Other than that, the lady in white with high hp minions like mosh'ogg enforcer and witchwood grizzly, nothing new there, but i think the addition of faceless rager and mana reservoir can create a much more stable early game. I think those are the only ros cards in it, but its my first priest deck
---
Mass dispel looks promising but idk if it will be often enough to run it yet. If mass resurrection brings minions back with their buffed stats it would be nice but i doubt it works that way.
---
I really want to do token druid with vargoth but i cant quite afford that
---
It does. But it also feels very good that they are able to commit to something as extreme as this. 
---
That’s not true, if u have a regular rare/ epic you still can earn a bit if you craft golden because you get dust for dusting the common version in the first place
---
That’s a fair amount considering how many people just spend all their time playing hunter on ladder
---
When will the rotation take place?

Me go... face?

I dont know how youre going to survive the early game, but seems like a fun deck

---
with 80packs,golden legendary and a cardback aswell, those were 10euro for just hero portrait, preorders ones have lot more then just hero portait alone.
---
I opened kalygos and a golden khadgar with 50 lmao.Rip hope you luck for your golden.
---
Ok, so what if it adds you a mech that deals that much damage to a minion?
---
I find Jade Druid to be quite effective at taking down res priest.
---
i think best between exclusive and not, is prolly to have them aviable for purchase once their set they came with(for preorder ones) goes to wild. then theyre still exclusive for 1 and 4months to 2years and later others can get them.
---
Not much point - there's a 60 card limit on deck size, so you can't improve this, just reach it in another way.
---

---
Tbf I’m still waiting for Krush but I refuse to craft it no matter what the meta is
---
But doesn't this combo also mean that you could play some kind of minion based deck with high attack values? play the combo on turn 1, play minions on turn 2, attack with minions on turn 3?
---
Any method for us iOS folks to finagle it without jailbreaking? (I will assume no) 
---
You lack early game. I think that would roll badly against aggro, maybe add that 1 Mana 1/1 divine shield on it?  Gets buffed with [[call to adventure]] and may help if you Mulligan for it against aggro decks
---
That's two Thaurissan ticks on most of the cards in the combo. I see a few ways you can achieve that (Seance for another Thaurissan, Drakkari Enchanter, Vivid Nightmare), but not sure which one is best.

Whilst the idea of swapping weapons sounds really cool, if your opponent doesn't have a weapon it's a legendary equip a 1/1, with a weak statline to boot, compared to [[Acidic Swamp Ooze]] or [[Gluttonous Ooze]] which have at least a decent statline for curve. The master trickster sounds flavourful with Dalaran though!

Thanks alot !

I lost interest a long time ago. I used to play it so much. Especially on breaks at work. It just stopped being fun.
---
I miss leeching poison
---
Yup. Every card that gives warrior a lot of armor with a single slot (bar getting a huge board with Armorsmith) is rotating out, so the scheme will be the only possible card that currently fills the niche. I made this point myself on the hearthpwn thread.
---
It's still so bad that I have a hard time imaging it ever gets put into a constructed deck on purpose, though. I think warrior will just go without bulk armor gain cards until a better one gets printed, but maybe sometimes it will be the correct discover option from Firetree Witchdoctor or something.
---
Can confirm it worked! Thanks a lot!
---
Why though? 
---
That late into the game mana has lost much of its meaning anyways. Oftentimes when you would want to play this card it doesn’t matter a whole lot that it costs 4 anymore. So I wouldn’t necessarily judge it on this proportional value for mana scale.
---
&gt; And here comes the personal attacks lol
---
It's an observation. I tell you about bulk value and how you're missing the point, you continue to miss the point by literally ignoring it in its entirety.
---
&gt; Tell you what, the expansion drops in a few days. Make a deck with it and tell me how it goes.
---
Again, can't read. I already said it's a bad card. I don't need to do anything after-the-fact to prove anything. Especially not to you.

If you only did one card you would of spend 1600 dust .  Receive 2000 hof dust and 500 dust after de.

So in both cases you will gain +900 dust just you are tying up and extra 1600 dust in your case

I always thought that was a weird death rattle, well done sir
---
In Standard, there are limited bulk armour options. Does that make this card good? No. It's bad.
---
But at least in a deck set on playing to Fatigue or, perhaps in a Specialist format, countering burst damage, this card can actually be remotely useful.
---
Boogeymonster?
---
No, you never run that. Because it's not just a bad Gruul, it's an *atrocious* Gruul.
---
I can't believe that something like that would actually work
---

Ive read this entire exchange and think you are just plugging your ears refusing to accept a single point he made as valid (when they are). Just accept that the counterargument he gave is a valid one, and get off your silly bandwagon already. 
---
Dr. Boom's scheme fills the niche of being dead in your hand for 20 turns, and not much else. Jesus. It's hard to read some of the stuff on this sub sometimes. When did village idiots become so articulate? 
---
&gt; Ive read this entire exchange and think you are just plugging your ears refusing to accept a single point he made as valid (when they are).

This goes both ways.
---
The playerbase is so set on whining about the card that they won't acknowledge anything in favour of it.
---
&gt; Just accept that the counterargument he gave is a valid one, and get off your silly bandwagon already.

Lol, k.

What "valid one"?

Well done.

Odd warrior. my games are long enough as it is don't need hunters making them longer /s 
---
regarding the free classic packs: you just have to play a ranked match on the corresponding device rather than win (insta-concede works as well)
---
they are probably referring to the emulating part , but in the past they have never ban people for emulating stuff , like samsung galaxy device emulator post (this one stayed with mods commenting , they will only remove it if blizzard don't like it and issuing ban, but nothing happen)  and nemsy gps spoof ( this one no ban so far but the post mentioning how to spoof it did get removed)
---
Ohh it worked, thanks so much!!
---
I'll bet you it doesn't. Against any kind of aggro you want Cry of the Carnarium and/or Kaya's Wrath to come out earlier. Control decks don't run much creatures or any at all so no playing a 1 health creature to put the ball rolling, and midrange decks won't want to clear their own board.
---
Nice find!
---
Well because the eye sorta bulges out and the pack explodes in a fleshy finish

I use Vargoth in my control warlock deck. As well as doubling up needed control spells, if he sticks about I can drop a void contract and remove both decks from the game before using Gul’dan and reserecting all my demon friends :)

Thanks, worked great. Keeping that config file for next iOS thing.

It’s only a free win if you’re already ahead or at least even. Even when your opponent has just a 5/4 and a 2/1 or stuff like that on board, playing Jaraxxus is super risky. They can free hit you after you did essentially nothing with your turn. And then you’re forced to play a aoe or taunt, because the 6/6 guys won’t help you fast enough.
---
In my experience arena games rarely allow Jaraxxus to be useful, although he of course is super good in theory.
---
It's gotta be something that wins the game based on armor, or has kicker effects with absurd amounts of armor.
---
I still don't see her getting even a sideboard spot for those niche uses, the fact that it's a board clear that can be played around by buffing your creatures by 1 health is huge.
---
Amazing stuff, thank you! Also it was really funny seeing the mobile client running on PC
---
Kind of dark, but awesome lol
---
I got 9 legendaries in 80 packs :)
---
Nah, rules are what the designers are asked to code. Behavior is the result of such coding.
---
It's so infuriating because if you start with it in the hand, it's good in Fatigue matches but there will always be that small chance that it's the bottom card and it just delays fatigue for a turn at best.

I’m confused on the process, I’ve set the event as private and created it but how would I join it in game?
---
&gt;Make sure your "client.config" actually is a true .config and not a .config.txt when editing
---
Now do I do that? I named the file .config but when I created it, I created it as a txt as you said. How do I change it?
---
Thanks for the response. I am not advocating to replace Wild, since some enjoy it. I do think that the pros would outweigh the cons. 
---
Some people thought that HS would never go down the road MtG did, by making Wild. Eventually, HS may have a "Modern" or "Legacy" of its own. 
---
App logo changed, I doubt people will be able to make their way to the game
---
Would I have to make client.config.cfg, or just client.cfg? Because naming if client.config just creates a .txt file

I love the full art analysis. Probably my favorite type of post on this sub
---
Does it only increase by 1 each turn? Has that ever been confirmed? Because otherwise a turn 7 13 armor for 4 mana isnt downright awful like you're all saying
---
... which shows that not only Deathwing aka Neltharion looks to be vulnerable to Old Gods influence. This strengthens the Malygos/Yogg'Saron theory!
---
which doesn't suck because it was a shitty deck to play against. Kingsbane rogue had plenty of tools to keep drawing Kingsbane, and it was a 1-mana weapon. This meant that they could reliably *always* have it equipped. And a permanent 7-12(?) attack weapon *with lifesteal* is just broken as fuck imo. They didn't even have to worry about fatigue because the 2-3 turns they would be drawing fatigue wouldn't be enough to kill them when they can just get their life back with lifesteal
---
2x 2x 4x
---
why does it even matter, its not like you can ever show it off or anything :/ I just opened mine as well
---
Whispers of the Old Gods, my favorite expansion to date. So much flavorful.
---
I would love it if that were the case, but other than the occassional Tavern Brawl I don't think they will ever implement this.
---
I love how no-one answered your question but you still got downvoted. 
---
People are cheap man. It doesn’t matter if the packs were 20 cents people would still complain. 
---
A deck is 30 cards. A 1 dollar pack gives about 40 dust. Your typical tier 1 deck cost say 500 dust. That’s about $12.50. So for around 13 bucks you can play this game competitively per season starting from zero. Over time your collection expands for free in the form of gold. 
---
People are cheap man. They expect to have everything for nothing because the game is “free”. You could have every card in the game for free with enough time because you get gold every day for free. Or you can pay money to speed things up in the form of packs. That is literally how every free mobile game works. Have things later for free or have things now for money. 
---
People will always complain and downvote though. 
---
seriously? I *only* add people when I want to tell them "Hey man that deck was really good and you played it well, I'd like a rematch sometime."
---
I've got the same problem (first time trying this stuff), have you found a solution already?

Probably because it wasn't even meme level good. It was most likely THE worst forced archetype of all time, and they figured it would be best to just scrap it and move onto a better design.
---
Are you serious?
---
This.
---
Awesome pack!! Can you help me perhaps? I made a Fireside Gathering and it got accepted, but I can't enter it in the game... 
---
Your plan is a very practical one if you can keep to it. Over time 4 wins per run in the Arena is better than buying packs.
---
I don't understand what "control panel" is? I don't find any "appearance and pernsonalization option, any help?

Please make a video guide on this. That would just be the coolest thing. 
---
It's not ruining it, is deciding not to play with them. Nobody is forced to play with anyone else. If you're a cheater, or an asshole, or people just don't like you, you don't play because nobody wants to play with you.
---
What's the difference?
---
GuYs I gOt HiReEk Up To 12/12
---
The value proposition is terrible vs a AAA game or comparable indie title, only having gotten worse due to the lack of new content.
---
I would be glad to purchase the equivalent of the pre-order bundle for $20 but not $60. I would likely still be purchasing them rather than having stopped at BRM.
---
If you don't pay, the game demands a huge time investment to save up for packs. I don't care enough about the game to do this so I barely play any more. 
---
Blizzard neither has my participation nor my money despite still having a residual interest in the game and being willing to pay for that at the right price.
---
It works perfect! I had already obtained the rewards of the cardpacks with an emulator long ago thanks to one reddit post (sansung and android devices) but I was missing those of IOS. So with this post I got the carbacks and the 2 IOS cardpack (Iphone and ipad). As always reddit to the rescue. THANKS.
---
If I ever move to Wild it would definitely NOT be during rotation. That is the best time of the year to play Standard. Usually the later into a Standard year it gets, the more I dabble in Wild.
---
Rotation is the whole reason I enjoy Standard personally.
---
Boom's scheme could be 1 mana and still wouldn't see play.
---
 Rafaam's scheme on the other hand has a lot of support, and warlock is a class that tends to go wide anyway. A few knife jugglers and an impferno can do a lot to make this card worth while, and in warlocks late game, they draw 2 cards a turn anyway, so topdecking this isn't as game ending as a scheme in other classes.
---
 
---
 Rafaam's scheme actually has some potential in decks that already exist, while Boom's scheme is FOUR MANA TOO EXPENSIVE making it by far the worst card ever printed.
---
Another way of Blizzard to say “fuck wild, play standard over this format”
---
I don’t get why people like the IPhone one best. IMO it’s the most boring one.

##My New Player help sheet
---
**Early Progress**
---
* If your combined class level (all 9 classes) is still lower than 20 you can get one free pack with the Recruit-a-friend program. If you play on EU you can use [my code](https://battle.net/recruit/7SLZMTKPNW?blzcmp=raf-hs&amp;s=HS&amp;m=web). If not look in the Find-a-Friend thread in the header of this sub.
---
* Of course play according to the beginner quests that pop up. Besides:
---
* Generally focus on Ranked Play. You will be put into beginner exclusive ranks that match you with other new players. Additionally playing through these beginner ranks (50-25) grants unique rewards and you get ranked rewards at the end of every month.
---
* Get all classes to level 10 (100 gold, get to know all classes a little).
---
* Defeat all Expert AI (100 gold).
---
* Play through The Knights of the Frozen Throne adventure for quality packs and a great legendary for free. Look up basic decklists that are suited for the challenges if you struggle with them.
---
* Focus on one class and get that to level 20 (unlocks Tavern Brawl that awards one pack per week).
---
* Play your free arena entry when you feel like doing so. Beyond that only play Arena if you enjoy playing the mode a lot and want to focus on it, not a good gold income source for new players.
---
* Try the completely free Dungeon Run, Monster Hunt and Rumble Run modes. No rewards, but a lot of fun.
---
* If you didn't know, you can reroll a quest that does not suit you once per day.
---
**Basic Deckbuilding**
---
* Pick 1-2 classes you want to focus on (for which you are willing to craft cards).
---
* Look up and ask for cheap beginner deck options for the classes you want to focus on.
---
* Watch [Trump Basic Teachings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvEIxIeBRKSjprrvlbAcbVjzHsnH9PjDX) for great new player tips.
---
**Basic Crafting/Disenchanting**
---
* Generally craft towards *decks*, not just specific single cards that could be good.
---
* Do not craft cards from the sets Un'goro, Frozen Throne and Kobolds&amp;Catacombs right now, the cards from these sets will leave the Standard format in a few weeks.
---
* An exception to that rule is the Hall of Fame (that would be too in depth here, feel free to ask further).
---
* Be really careful about dusting cards. Dusting value is awful; except some bad rares, epics and legendaries it is not worth to disenchant most cards.
---
* It's safe to dust golden cards that you don't need because in case you eventually do need the card in the future you can just craft it again (non-golden) for the same price (you don't lose dust value, just the shiny effects).
---
* Generally never dust commons (except of course cards you have more than 2 of).
---
**What to buy with gold**
---
* Purchase one Kobolds &amp; Catacombs pack, that will grant you a legendary for free
---
* Generally focus on classic packs for now at least until you get the first guaranteed legendary sometime in the first 10 packs. Skip this if you getthe Welcome Bundle (see below).
---
* In one of the first 10 packs of all sets you get a legendary guaranteed. So work your way through the 3 expansions from last year at least for the one legendary (buy packs one buy one until you get the legendary)
---
* Save a bit of gold (atleast ~400) for the new expansion release on April 9, together with the free packs (3-6 usually) you should be able to get the guaranteed legendary for the new set as well.
---
**What to buy with real money**
---
* The Welcome Bundle ($5) is great. Beyond that the game is really expensive for real money though and you don't get *that* much out of your investment, even from the bundles at expansion release.
---
***Feel free to ask further and have fun!***
---
Read my first comment again, my point was not about how early they can release it. The point was that if they have the expansion ready enough for a tavern brawl (aka implemented into the client) then they have it ready for people to play regularly as well. And I'd rather play with the cards myself than with some crappy premade decks in a brawl.
---
FrostyDog#296403 EU 80g, I show u go first.
---
Mech hunter in wild, runs no epics and some ppl run zilliax but he's not super important. Can grab a deck code if ur interested
---
These are huge points that really show how different the games and cards really are. Important to keep in mind.
---
How good will Flarkmaster Blast be though?
---
It draws two cards from your deck and adds them to your hand.
---
Blizzard has always been a big fan of handing out a set of cards in theme with the expansion and NEVER TOUCHING THE ARCHETYPE AGAIN. So it's not even strange that it happened here.
---
They couldn't figure an angle for Shaman from it's existing themes, so they invented one they never intended to make playable.
---
"Overkill: Double this Minion's Attack" + "Add a 10/10 Copy of a Friendly Minion that Costs 10" + "Summon Duplicates of the Adjacent Minions" = Fun.
---
People have been emulating to get card packs and such for years and this is a lot less innocuous than that.
---
Its also something that makes absolutely no sense to punish. The only people going to this kind of effort over a card back are players already playing Hearthstone anyway - the whole point of these promotions are to attract new players who can think "hey they made a unique thing for my platform maybe I'll give it a try".
---
I think the real question is why didn't you pick Sludge Slurper over both of those
---
Now is the time. This expansion(the first expansion of the year) will be the longest. 
---
The one of Barista Lynchen reminds me so much of Noxious

Because the question was "most popular".
---
People might think the minions on the board are from the new expansion. Heck, I bet even the veteran players can't write their names correctly.
---
I dont know about that. Big Warrior is looking like a low Tier 3 deck to me whereas I don't think Boom's Scheme sees play in any deck, ever.
---
Seriously?
---
This reduce the coolness 
---
Blue counters everything, why would that matter
---
Battlefrog#11968 Asia I show you go first 
---
Exactly. Angler will only see play in Murloc Shaman but Sludge Slurper will see play in Murloc Shaman for sure and has the possibility to branch out to other Shaman decks
---
That's true, the death Knight helps a bit though. 
---
It's played quite a bit in Deathrattle and Midrange decks. It's just that those decks aren't popular right now aside from Even Shammy.
---
VoxGens#1443
---
Sure but this card seems more fair. Only two tokens spawned that have no general synergy with warrior, the armor gain is negligible, and the 2/1 weapon can only menace for the one turn unless buffed. 
---
Well, Dimensional Ripper has potential in a Big Warrior type deck, while Boom's Scheme is just bad in general, no matter what deck it's in. I mean it might "save" you in those fatigue matches, but by that point, you should either be A. have no viable cards left, or B. about to lose to Mecha'Thun.
---
I am undefeated, not once have i yeeted
---
Branching paths wouldnt be played if it was only armor. The whole reason its so str9ng is because it is useful in every situation. Gonna die? Armor. Against control? Draw to get your combo. Big board through tokens/plague? +2 attack to push damage or stop a mossy horror. Even better you can flex it if the situation doesn't require that much draw/armor/attack. Its universal use is why its played.
---
Even if it was the only armor gain card in the game it wouldnt see play. 
---
I really dislike it. It's two unfortunate clicks away from essentially deleting a deck that I spent time putting together and playing with, with no way of turning the function off.

Find out on /r/hearthstone starting 7th April.
---
Its a programmed in intentional behavior of the client. At most the bug is that they only meant the [Emulation] field to be supported on debug and not release builds.
---
At the end of the day though Blizzard will ban whoever they want whenever they want and however they want - I'd love to see someone try suing Activision for their account over the interpretation of Blizzards own ToS, especially when said ToS also explicitly says they have the right to close your account whenever for any reason anyway.
---
Tested and confirmed to work for me :)
---
It's absolutely terrible even in the "Res Priest meta", since even with that slightly worse drawback in maybe 15% of your games, it's still worse than boulderfist ogre, which isn't even worth considering in any deck

I always hate watching Hearthstone clips, because I'm always trying to click the players hand to bring the cards up.  :P

With priest I won with a bunch of insane Lyra the sunshard synergy where I picked discounted spells and ended up getting offered Lyra and 2 radiants in a bucket and drew her the next match and just completely whooped up casting ridiculous spell after spell for like 5 minutes per turn and won so resoundingly and had a lot of fun all the while... then I got offered a bucket with 2 lyras and a radiant and of course won then just kept getting offered lyras and kept taking them when they showed up plus other stuff to synergize with that and it was the most unstoppable and consistent draft I’ve ever had. Never once did I lose control of a match and had a complete blast.

No I am saying if they printed some support, whatvever benefit you might gain, it would be quickly realised that you are better off cutting the card and going wioth other mechs or deathrattles or whatever that also synergise with the support. This has happned to many niche cards in the past, and would happen with this one too.
---
The aggro variant may be good, but I've yet to hear about anyone playing leaching since the nerf.
---
Right now I think your deck is too high rolly with Jepetto and 2 other minions. Assuming the other cards can keep you alive long enough I would add chef nomi and probably archivist and maybe hakkar or exotic mountseller and take out some of the less good spells depending on the meta (like explosive shot and multi shot probably.
---
I also was thinking maybe drop tracking and a master's call for eaglehorn and strategist but idk how well that would go. Obviously if you drop tracking you don't run nomi but if you are running tracking and zuljin I think you need nomi and archivist.
---
Surprised that they gave Plot Twist and Safeguard a 1.  IMO they at least deserve a 2.

Never miss out on an opportunity to shit on a community you're a part of to feel superior to and garner upvotes
---
7 mana, 7 attack, a boombot on each side? What are you on? You can't get more balanced than that.
---
Photoshopped?
---
They really ought to have done the opposite: if you choose a standard deck to play wild pop up "Are you sure you meant to play wild? This deck is legal in standard." I've made this mistake a few times sincence I play both.
---
I think I just came after hearing Arch-Villain Rafaam's theme. 
---
If it works it will be a deck with a limited secret package (about half the deck) and the rest are just midrange cards. 2 of the 2/2 weapon, 2 of the 2/3, 2 of Never Surrender, 2 Eye for an Eye, 1-2 Twinspell cards, 1-2 more secret of choice. Even the 4 mana 3/4 might not be worth it to run. The whole point of the deck is to secret turn 1 into the weapon/ the 2 mana 2/3 turn 2. To do that you need about 7-8 secrets. That's about 11-12 cards. I think the legendary sucks, and if you only run 7-8 secrets including some of the twinspell, the 4 mana 3/4 also sucks.
---
Think of it on this perspective. The payoff for Secret Hunter are Spellstone and Zul'jin. One is incredibly strong mid game, one is incredibly strong late game. The payoff for Secret Paladin are the 2 mana minion, and the 2 mana weapon. They are only strong on turn 2, turn 3 they are fair cards, turn 4 they don't matter much. People never had much trouble dealing with the Hunter secrets themselves, and those are way stronger than Paladin secrets. So with a deck with little payoff for playing secrets, why would you play them? Secret Paladin works right now because of Tarim and Divine Favor, one make you want to play cheap, inefficient cards, one make you weak cheap cards stronger. Without those cards, secrets can only be a tempo tool, they can't be a win condition.
---
I've seen it played. Granted, it may have just been someone who hadn't bothered to swap it out of their deck yet.
---
A permanent 7-12(?) weapon is still pretty powerful without lifesteal *every* turn
---
Sure thing!
---
Yes you are, you go through my post history downvoting everything I write. That's exactly you being a stalker, so stop it before Reddit admins take a look at your deliberate brigading.

---
Yeah, it'd be like anytime this has happened in magic. 'we're going to reprint some old card that gave everyone nightmares.' And then those cards never do anything. The world moved on and minions got better so suddenly Ernham Djinn or Juzam (reprinted in sliver form) seem pretty laughable when you can get similar statted minions with an upside.
---
Thanks mate. Snagged the iphone one.
---
*shrug*
---
I used to be more of a “Timmy/Johnny” type of player, but if you play any particular card game for long enough, that sensibility naturally wears down as you start “seeing through the veil” like I mentioned. I’m certainly happy for you if you still are in that bright eyed, “I want to play meme decks!” phase - but all I’m saying is that I recommend ***also*** playing around with some actual meta decks, because you’ll eventually start getting that curiosity anyways.  
---
Deadly Shot would be a good addition.
---
also wait for few days before disenchanting some cards.
---
some witchwood cards (baku and genn with their supporting cards, doomguard , divine favor and naturalise) will be hall of famed , so you can get free dust for having a copy of them.
---
Agree. Baleful banker should be added imo.
---
Also assign a flair to your post, because it’s currently removed. 
---
Shame they didn't do a prerelease poll this time around :(
---
But what if he "wins" the flip?
---
🤞
---
You want to play it early anyway. It's for surviving until you can do the combo. 
---
Yes, Frost Lich Jaina, the hero card for the class with a much older Freeze association, had to do with ice. Deathstalker Rexxar, Uther of the Ebon Blade, Bloodreaver Guldan, Shadowreaper Anduin, and Valeera the Hollow have objectively nothing to do with ice. Malfurion the Pestilent has icy antlers in his card art and that's it, while Scourgelord Garrosh might have icy art as well. Even being generous, 4 or 5 out of 9 is pretty far from all.

What it comes down to, if Freeze shaman was ever good enough to be a thing, Moorabi would probably not even be played in it because he's pretty slow and bad. It also probably wasn't very popular, compared to some bad archetypes, like discard, that people will keep try forcing. If competitive players don't enjoy something, and casual players don't enjoy something, better to cut ones losses rather than keep waisting a classes few class cards on something no one likes

To add to this, should I save some gold for the wings of the solo adventure? Are going there going to be cards that are locked behind these wings?
---
I know Righteous Judge is for the contest and so it has to deal 4 damage, but I think I'd prefer a consistent damage to all attackers instead. Maybe 2 damage, and increase mana cost and stats?
---
You are using those versions on your Android phone. With this function it's just pretty clear why one unified UI (for all different platforms) is a horrible idea.
---
You can build the deck around that. And why is it always a argument in this sub that some streamer said it. They have been wrong so many times, especially if its about unreleased/untested stuff.

I think you're confusing Darkest Hour with something else. This is a card from the upcoming expansion, so you almost certainly have not yet pulled 2 copies of it.
---
Particularly since many meta decks work like “meme decks” *anyways*. They just also simultaneously happen to be **good**. Like “Big Priest”. 
---
Just leaving a comment here to remember this for future uses. Thank you, this is amazing.
---
Secret paladin is currently a tier 1 meta deck for almost 2+ months. Nothing is untested. No divine favor replacement. I love Secret Pala as a deck but truth must be spoken, especially for the people who will use their dust on that deck and they don’t even have that much.
---
You concede and try again
---
Seen a streamer perform an "OTK" by shuffling a bunch of Scrolls of Wonders into their deck, then giving it to the opponent via Togwaggle. The OTK mostly happens because a lot of random spells draw extra cards causing massive fatigue damage.
---
It's quite possible that getting 2 extra turns is sufficient enough to do so with a mishmash of cards, sometimes, for sure.
---
Looks epic, nice work! 
---
Please don't tell me you're going to turn the lich king in to 1 measley epic when it rotates?
---
I can't do it... when I save it as "client.config", it stays as textdata.

Garrosh? Thrall? Valeera saw play for like a month.

it would be a problem in the classic set still imo

---
I never said Iron Hide was worse for Shield Slam? I would agree, it's better, because it's faster, and enables you to actually remove the threat in a good amount of time. And Mana-efficiently, too.
---
How could you misunderstand what I said so badly man?

I’m new here so what does that do?
---

---
I don't think you really understand what "arbitrary" means, which makes sense coming from you, so i'll make sure to define it. 
---
Arbitrary means "based on personal choice and random whim". 
---
My definition is completely clear. It defines the characteristics thst would lead to a repeatable, consistent outcome. While a Mechathun OTK does use 11 mana worth of cards, you never have 11 mana total, because the maximum amount of crystals you can have is 10. It simply relies on you adding an extra mana crystal from Innervate. 
---
Your Velen OTK that you clearly stated from earlier relies on 16 mana of minions to be resurrected, as well as having at least 2 damage dealing spells in hand. 
---
You define that as an "OTK", meaning that you agree with the definition of what an OTK entails. So by trying to argue my definition, you're being more "arbitrary" than I ever was. 
---
Feels like the article just listed 'the strong new secret cards', without really getting into an interesting discussion of what strengths and weaknesses the deck might have and what some different avenues to solving those might be. 
---
It is much cheaper to play wild. 
---
You're right, you are arrogant.
---
Because you're still the idiot that can't listen to what you even identify as a "Well thought out argument."
---
I didn't die on any hill. People like you are what reduces the quality of this subreddit. With your petulant whininess and the entitlement that comes with it.

other than that , craft it as soon as you can, who knows if blizzard might be experiencing some server outage or you can't log in due to phone breaking , etc.  play safe , do it as early as possible. 
---
Unless it accelerates the rate the scheme growth rate.
---
Valeera was in the Witchwood and Boomsday versions of Quest Rogue.
---
Garrosh and Thrall were used throughout the KotFT meta in Control Warrior and Token Shaman respectively.
---
Chief Inspector might be a little slow if Secret Paladin turns out to be as fast of a deck as I think it will be.  Definitely interested in a Pirate/Weapon package with Hench Clan Thug.  I'm thinking 1 Bloodclaw, 2 Mysterious Blade, 2 Truesilver Champions with Cpt Greenskin, Dread Corsair, and Bloodsail Raider - possibly adding more pirates with Southsea Deckhand and Southsea Captain.

Secret pally can already deal with things like [[tar creeper]] and [[stonehill defender]]. If the extra health is too much for them, they'll tech for it. If [[Proud defender]] becomes really prominent, [[shieldbreaker]] will probably be teched in.

Honestly i bought medivh bc hes amazing and i mostly play mage. I ended uo buying Alleria bc i got a bunch of cool hunter cards but rexxar disgusts me. I wont play warrior much with just garrosh lol. I bought magni for my bff n we love him.

My definition states that something is an OTK when you kill your opponent in one turn. That does not include any choices I made myself; it's not arbitrary. That's how I define an OTK. The Velen example falls under my definition, and therefore is an OTK. 
---
Your definition had to include limitations: why 10 mana? Why 10 cards? Why no minions on the board? These are choices you have to make: with no real reasoning behind them, that is completely arbitrary.

I don’t think malygos hunter is going to work because you have to add a lot of “bad” cards in order to make a very situational combo work.

like i said the decks im goin up against are not midrange hunter. they have these fkng niche legendaries, full golden portraits, etc. 
---
You just need to git gud, man. I downloaded the game on 2016, played it for about 2 hours and uninstalled it. I downloaded it again back in November 2018 and guess what: I was just another noob that didn't have even all the basic cards and at rank 25, because back then rank 50-26 didn't exist. So I was in a harder stage than you. I have only spent literally $45 in the game (which is literally nothing because I got shit cards) and by February I was already rank 5.
---
I literally beated a control warrior deck, which has a bunch of legendary and epic cards (and the guy had the golden hero too), while I was playing a basic cards only warlock deck, and I am a Rogue player.
---
The point is you don't really need to spend any money to rank up.
---
Go farm gold and save it for next rotation. Don't spend resources RN because most of the most played cards are rotating, unless you wanna go for Wild.
---
Aggro druid
---
yeah i did. doesnt take away from the fact that this is the most power crept CCG in the market at beginner ranks.
---
Next time just check if it has been posted please
---
So your original post sounds like you’re brand new, but you’ve actually been rank 2 in HS before? Bruh nothing has changed. Rank 20 has always been like this. Stop crying and plug away 
---
You do have a change. Most of meta decks aren't that expensive. You pay for variety and quantity not quality. Free to play you are able to get one meta deck relatively fast. For instance odd paladin. You only really need Baku to make the deck good. 
---
Any deck can play yogg you just gotta believe
---
yeah i realize that every single function in this game is designed to make you spend money. thats why they are a billion dollar corporation. freemium. whoopdey do. still gonna complain how its impossible to play for free at rank 20 
---
I think people are sleeping on darkest hour warlock. I feel like it could end up tier 2.
---
It seems like if you're *that* good at card games generally *and* has already shown yourself capable at Hearthstone, you would already know that the player with the "better" (more expensive) deck quite often doesn't win.
---
In which case why would you expect to have good decks? You've literally just started. Your meant to start low and build up. But if you get expansion packs you'll build up a thousand times faster.
---
You may be looking at other players and seeing all these good cards thinking they are thousand dollar collections when really a ton of them are probably free to play. You can build a efficient and solid deck for dirt cheap  like 20-30 packs assuming you open smartly. Disenchant cards you don't use, and look up good decks based on what you have. You have to be stingy when starting. 
---
Okay?
---
What I’m saying is for *you* to use midrange hunter. It’s literally a tier one deck right now. If you’re any good at the game you should coast right on up to rank 5 at the very least. If you’re not able to, then it’s your own fault rather than the games. 
---
How do you know what windfury does?
---
No the people at rank 20 who have superior decks suck at the game and are not able to pilot their tier 1 decks. Once in a while they get matched with someone like you who has a tier 3 deck at best and they crush you. At this point you will need better cards or better skill to progress. It's up to you if you want to grind, put money into the game or quit. 
---
So just delete the game and go do something else, you goober. Why are you even here right now? Go read a book or enjoy the sunshine. 
---
&gt;Did he kill in one turn? Yes. Congratulations, it's a one turn kill.
---
I killed him in one turn, did I not? or are you now adding the condition that it had to be 30 damage in one turn?
---
except when there is a significant margin inbetween how good two decks are. skill can only overcome so much 
---
Taken
---
So dumb that a company wants to earn money. Shame on them. Besides that I have multiple friends that are F2P and are still having fun and winning a good amount of games. Just cause you suck at the game doesnt mean its just because everyone is paying money.
---
yeah remove maly and add alex to threat lethal with the spell power bow. Very consistent with masters call tutoring draws.
---
Bran and Emperor are old cards that you should have if you're an older player. I don't know what decks I'll shove this combo into, but every single one of the cards in the pic  has to function without the others. So don't count the adventure cards into the cost of a wild deck.

Quick points:
---
1. WAY less expensive cards with much, much more draw
---
2. Higher damage cap with [[Tuskarr Fisherman]] and extra [[Mind Blast]]s (56 damage with just 1 mind blast due to +3 spell damage)
---
But sadly, this is just not very good still. [[Mecha'thun]] is the same thing but faster &amp; more reliable. I don't think there will ever be an interation better than Mecha'thun, because that goes through Ice Block, doesn't have a damage cap, and can use [[Hemet, Jungle Hunter]]. Fun, though, for sure!

Having more legendary cards in your deck does not mean its better, a player with a golden portrait could have earned it by dumping a ton of time in the game, and you're probably better off investing what you can in one cheaper but certainly proven deck rather than into half a dozen super cheap ones.
---
tf? so reducing your opponent to 0 health from any other number isn’t killing? what’s killing then?

Dude hitting rank 5 is relatively easy if you know how to play the game and adapt to the meta. And no. You don't need to spend large amounts of money. Master one good deck and learn the machtups and you ll see the evolution. Being mad and tilting doesn't work at all.

You are correct that the game definitely shifts into a completely different game and yeah it is entirely too expensive if you just want to buy and play the whole thing for like 30-40 dollars like a lot of people are used to doing with normal games... but you don’t understand Blizzard is just a small indie company and needs you to pay more money than you would pay to play some conglomerates big triple A plus platinum game.

“Why thank you Lich Ki-“

“AGAINST ODD PALADIN.”

Have you ever considered that maybe his deck was designed the strategy you were using and that his deck might just be countered by those that don't care about the removal options and power plays he has?
---

So a lot of boardwipes rotate. Just summon a board of minions via spells ex. The scheme. Turn 9 or 10 summon imps from scheme into darkest hour. Summon only huge minions like the new big imp, rafaam, giants. Kill next turn. Plot twist and hero power can help find the scheme by turn 3 or 4 to get the 7 imps off of it and even 5 or 6 isn’t bad.

I'd guess that do was changed to be viable

Version 16.20 shows cards out of sync with description. Went back to 15.13 and saw the same thing (first insertion of shadow cards)
---
*”I remember my first rotation...”*
---
Looks like super strong neutrals.  Lots of counter potential exists for everyone.  
---
Countess Ashmore is going to be very powerful as there won’t be as much card draw post rotation.  
---
Single card win cons (Rexar, Guldan) are gone.  Feels like we are getting a solid midrange expansion with the sole exception of the new Archmage (he is insanely powerful but everyone has him).  
---
Yeah i know 
---
Its like how there will be occasional color swaps and effects that are black will become white.
---
Ya better downvote yourself too if you wanna keep any sense of dignity
---
I did it again. XD
---
It was just as crazy, with even more minions to actually activate those random minion spells.
---
Also, the audio kept properly this time!
---
So I decided to share with ya all.
---
Cheers!
---
F
---
I did it again. 60 Scrolls and Vargoth, take two!

Only deck I play now lol. 
---
Where is Windfura tho ? 
---
All of these changes are great imo. Excited to get back into playing again. Thank you.
---
Sad that it does not work. I'd like to play with the new cards. And i think it would be fun since its just kinda a light version with whizbang.
---
I actually won the second giveaway. I freaked out.
---
Thanks.
---
Well I opened 4 or so packs to get the first one and then I did open 200 and only had 6. I really have no way to prove it though. And I have heard people say that they opened ungoro packs and they have said they got an abysmal drop rate. 
---
The thing is there is no way to tell if people are being salty or if there really is an increased chance of hitting the pity timer with Un’Goro...
---
It the chances are so small then maybe there is something off with something. 
---
Well its actually is a bad deck if you cant cheat out big minions early and resurrect them many times.
---
Big priest usually gets annihilated by aggro decks unless you draw nicely.
---
Hahahah!
---
Ahh, 4 ragnaroi?! It’s not possible! No one’s been able to summon them!!
---
All of the DKs had frost themes, it was the *Icecrown* expansion.
---
Ok but Hagatha is good and the scheme sucks, so, that's the difference?
---
Its play low attack high health taunts
---
Why isn't he a legendary anymore :(
---
I think you need more dust.
---
53 life's too short to wait 3 months for packs and not open any in the meantime. 
---
Yeah. Playing a beginner's deck as a beginner can lead you into problems. However, you're supposedly playing a "beginner's" deck as a decent enough player. If that is the case, you should already know how best to build a deck on a budget and still do well.
---
If you really do not know at least how basic match-ups (aggro versus control, aggro mirror, Midrange versus Tempo, etc.) play out and what you should try to do depending on your role in a game, then you are for sure the less skilled player.
---
Ugly
---
He's a goblin as everyone has said, but even if he were a gnome, [this](https://imgur.com/a/SXZrFzJ) is what he looks like. He's as tall or taller than player characters in WOW.
