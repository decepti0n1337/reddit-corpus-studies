Rage?  No, just weariness.  This is reminding me of shit I've seen like this a thousand times in different forms of media.  Comic characters getting less skimpy outfits, Kratos not getting a sex minigame in the latest game.   MtG moved away from sexualized art, and some of the loudest voices complaining about it were the same folks who harassed the games top cosplayer out of the game.   Not accusing anyone here of that level of crap, and while you may not see the people seriously criticizing these changes, but I've seen people quitting, calling for boycotts, ranting over liberal agendas and muslims.  Some people take even the most minor of changes away from their preferences as a personal attack.  Most of the posts here are the same joke over and over, yes.  But when a thousand voices say the same words it sounds like a shout.

I don't think they've actually said anything about it.
---
As someone from the beginning, just give me a pack and I'm fine, I have a plethora of card backs I don't use.
---
The free mod didn't do it, the F2P versions of the mod from big companies are doing it.
---
How many more arts fall into the category that would apply to these types of changes?  And too what end?  What is at the bottom of this slippery slope everyone is afraid of?
---
It seems that the whoooosher has been /r/whoooosh\\ed
---
That's the point, the hero portrait is there to make you buy the most expensive bundle. If people knew they could just wait to buy the portrait later and for cheaper, they wouldn't be able to prey on the FOMO in consumers.
---
It's obviously making them enough money because they've done this model a couple times now (Elise, Lazul, Jaraxxus) unlike the $50 with King Rastakhan which has only been done once.
---
And it looks like they're done with $10 direct purchases of Hero Portraits in favor of the $20-$30 bundles that come with some packs.
---
The sentence "A Reborn minion will" is also cut off. It's almost like the original article gave an actual explanation of the keyword right after 🤔.
---
It was just a weird complaint 3 days ago and now it's getting super old.
---
It still has Shadowboxer too, right?
---
"as long as a company or authoritative entity does it and i dont mind - it's obviously okay!"
---
TLDR. OP asks to censor the posts complaining about censorship.
---
Cause they fired someone and are trying to replace them? Seems kinda ridiculous to be outraged over that no?
---
I've gotten a bug where you fired 800 employees including most CMs but are now hiring a CM. Can you help me with this one?

I don’t like them changing artwork on old cards/heroes (rip my Jaina), but I will say I do like this version better.

Yeah, it’s pretty strong in pretty much any battlecry Shaman.  Even just playing it on lifedrinkers on 4 is decent a lot of the time, but it’s especially good on Japetto, Hagatha, Hotshots, and Shudderwock sometimes.
---
I don't get it
---
I'm with you there. Screw you and the minority whining about the majority expressing it's displeasure.  
---
You are just a bunch of whiners that should be sacrificed for the greater good of the game and to fight back the rampant puritanism and censorship creeping everywhere these days.

Wow. I didn't actually see it until you pointed it out!
---
Might be with the lightning, but she looks very pale/bright compared to her hearthstone skin tone.
---
I'm almost certain that if they were just honest with why they made the changes there would be absolutely none of these posts you complain about.

It's not just the Hearstone "journalists" that you should trust, ALL videogame journalists are hacks.

---
Who hurt you lmao
---
there's a thousand better reasons to call them lazy than freaking finley model
---
More than that, overhaul the bloody classes. Having classes that are stuck playing DPS is archaic
---
You're right, I guess Blizzard decided machete's are too dangerous for fantasy creatures to wield so they gave him a comical golden fish statue instead.
---
Unpopular opinion. Does it really matter? I personally like most of the art changes. I understand it’s the matter of fact for stuff like this to be banned, but is it really that dire. Secret keeper is gorgeous! Deadly shot looks like it levels houses. Not a shocked Tauren. Idk getting upset over censorship of cartoon boobs butts and blood is... silly? I understand the act of censorship is something entirely different. But maybe I want my kids to try the game and this isn’t a bad change to get a larger audience ?
---
I get nightmares from that picture, please change it to a picture of Spongebob or something...

making something like this NSFW is a clickbait.

They’re saying both mechanics give you two cards worth of value for one card in your deck not that both keywords are mechanically similar
---
I feel like this will be good and see play just because we have the Battlecry: If you control a quest draw a card thing.

---
&gt;considering this article openly discusses changes...
---
Except it doesn't. It's just a bunch of PR yadda yadda to not outright say "there's money to be made in China so we need to cater to that market"
---
&gt;do tits and blood really matter that much
---
Of course they don't lmao. Thing is, this is the same company that said "we won't change any of the cardarts. The arts is one of the most iconic things about the game so we don't want to change that, every player should have the same experience".... Also, that same company "we're gonna change those specific cards. That those are the cards that can potentially cause the most trouble with one of our biggest markets is just a coincidence".
---
It wasn't me who made the claim, i was just responding to a thesis.
---
To be fair, I think that photo doesn’t do justice to the art direction the last few expansions. Environments, new models, spell effects have all been looking pretty great. They’re threading a needle on keeing the game accessible.
---
Races usually get an across-the-board upgrade when an expansion focuses on them, like demons did with Legion. I suspect murlocs will get their time in the sun sooner or later
---
I suspect that one reason the data isn't available is because using it to program a bot that plays games would be against the ToS.

Would cyclone see play if evocation wasn't a thing tho?
---
I get what you mean, I just disagree.  Teaching someone is still generally is better done through comparisons FIRST to wrap their heads around the basics and THEN the specific.
---
As a first exposure to Reborn, saying it's sort of like Twinspell, a mechanic in Standard that is rather competitive and common to see, isn't a bad place to start explaining how the mechanic works, not just what it does.
---
It's not that they don't give a s*** about you oh, it's just that they overestimated you.
---
&gt;If the comparison helps someone understand the game better
---
Except the comparison is just as likely to confuse people, because Twinspell does something very different. They should have just not made any comparisons, just like Blizzard's own official explanation of the mechanic (and since Blizzard is infamous for not wanting to "confuse new players" I think they know what they're doing here).
---
Says you, I think its much more effort than the "I posted a screenshot of a 1/5 chance gimmie karma"
---
The thing that will stop a change like what is described from being implemented is that it makes the card more complex. Team 5 has as of yet to make a card more complex, at most lowing a card's complexity like with Patches the Pirate, with a card change, and I don't think they'd start with Shield Slam.
---
Pretty sure it’s permanent.
---
The original Finley used to give me a rock hard pipe everytime I played him. It was embarrassing if I played around family or friends. So happy to see this change!
---
If he had included the next sentence in his image it would have only strengthened his point (that the comparison is bad and unnecessary, as evidenced by the very next sentence making it irrelevant), so I'm not sure "misleading" is the right word to use here.

No... just... no. He is stealing the Master Plan, which would be called Academic Espionage. The goblin in the picture is stealing the "Master Plan" which details the plan Rafaam plans to use to steal Dalaran. Because it details the steps, it would be educational to the Henchman reading it, which is why it is referred to as "Academic". I don't see how you could miss this.

Ignoring how horribly OP is trying to slant this, does anybody actually read any gaming related stuff like this anymore? Its 90% fluff written by people without any real interest in what they are writing about. Thats not really an attack on them, its just the nature of pumping out online articles. If I want to learn about the new update for a game there are a million better places to go rather than some random pcgamer article. 
---
It really just feels like the medium as a whole is kind of irrelevant given how many better and more narrowly focused sources there are. Its just simple quality vs quantity at this point. The news sites have a lot of shit, but none of it is particularly good.

Why is someone a moron because they decided to spend money on something they enjoy? I'm sure you have something in your life, whether it be a painting of some sort, a more expensive lamp you don't need, that fancy microwave that makes the little jingle after it's done heating up, that you spent extra on because it makes you happy. 
---
Not to mention, people seem to always forget you also get 80 packs for it as well, which is $1 per pack, big value for those who play the game heavy and enjoy being able to play more than one deck per expansion. Most that get this bundle would've gotten it anyway because of the dollar per pack ratio, now they also get rewarded with a neat portrait.

No this is great, finally a thicc murloc
---
Sure, but cats can leave claw marks on bones, which are harder.  The Moh's hardness scale doesn't work for every situation.  They can scratch glass doors and stuff like that as well.
---
It's not exactly a "scratch" in the Mohs hardness rubbing things against one another way, but rather through enough force the tip penetrates the harder surface, and then from there it's just a matter of dragging it through.  More gouging than scratching.
---
Makes sense.
---
It's blizzard balance, Warlock was amazing from K&amp;C till around rumble so now they're on the down slide a bit. Also it's one card and lets be honest, it only takes 1 or 2 really good cards to flip a class from bad to great. This feels more for the plot twist lock to meme about with.
---
VICTORY OR REST!
---
Where is this in mechagon?
---
Honestly? I’d buy it. In my WoW experience Murlocs have a like average 20 minute life expectancy, down to 1 minute or less if they’re in the most current content. Probably have had a dozen Sir Finleys in 4 years.
---
The mega bundles could still have more value than these anyway, and Blizzard would still make money from them, as a lot of players would want them now, rather than in 2 years.
---
Just old god mutations, nothing to see here. Move along.
---
Thanks
---
For the quest to save it at this point it'd have to be the same as Shaman's, except for Deathrattles.
---
Hey, don’t you body shame Sir Finley! 
---
So he let himself go a little after college. Maybe he got a little too comfortable in his marriage and put on 63 lbs. Maybe his wife cheated on him with her yoga instructor and he turned to alcoholism and pizza to numb the pain after the divorce. Maybe Kaitlyn can go fuck herself if she thinks she can take away his custody rights!

Blizzard lost me as a customer because they've caved to China one too many times. Why don't they just relocate there?

You lost 2 whole titties.  That's a big loss.

It's IPA. But the pronunciation is easy. Rather than the G in 'legion', this symbol represents the S in 'lesion'.
---
Basic and classic cards that you get through the new player ranks. And IF you are buying packs with gold, but 10 and stop. Because there is a guaranteed legendary within the first ten packs.
---
Reno Squatson
---
Because they are changing their products in ways US customers do not want changed to appease the Chinese fucking government. Fuck that. This after they sell out Diablo to Chinese mobile microtransaction games? I will not support that. They lost me as a customer and I was a well paying customer.
---
I didnt. I went f2p
---
TBH this art is actually pretty cute.
---
So many card backs I missed out on or lost on other accounts, i hope they start rotating old card backs into the game for events or every 3 months give us a retro reward card back in TB or ladder and for those who already have it give them 100 gold instead.
---
But Battlecries is a very broad and diverse keywords with many strong and interesting minions, you have loads of options. Any good decks in HS need strong battlecry minions anyway
---
Not like the old quest, Taunt for example. Very plain and narrow choice of boring minions that most of us doesnt want to put in the deck wihtout the quest
---
You should probably put a spoiler tag on that.
---
yeah just log in after some hours you are gonna be fine
---
They are both bad.

I don’t know why you keep making these but please continue

Oh somehow forgot that part completely lol

---
Brode did say back in the day when hero skins became a thing, that they would not be making card skins because they wanted the cards to be recognisable at a glance and having multiple different arts for each card would be detrimental to this.
---
I doubt, because this case is more like the mobas
---
See, that's where you're wrong! They made him more 'Child Friendly'.
---
That doesn't really excuse anything, you're still talking to real people.
---
That would be very shortsighted and mean the person should not play Bo3 in general. The entire point is that there is an option to make a comeback. 1-2 and 0-2 are the same, but 1-2 and 2-1 are not.
---
Its a craftable spellcard.
---
This game becomes uglier with every new expansion, instead of the opposite... blizzard are ******(not to use stronger words)... AND make so that you can assign card back individually to all of your nine classes already! HOW much more time you need to realise this blizzard?!  I could go on and on, I won't even bother to buy the new expansion, it is so disgustingly ugly. If you want your game to be played in kindergarten so be it... that exclude US!
---

That is how it works in MTG Arena. Going 1-2 is two lost games. Going 2-1 is two won games.

It makes a \*little\* more sense if you think of it in terms of biblical plagues (ie plague of locusts, etc). More like curses, really.

Glad to see I'm not the only one. On a busy board I can't get through all my actions before the turn timer runs out because there's a lag after every action I do.
---
It's tanked the amount of time I spend playing the game because it's so frustrating to lose a game because of a slow connection speed. (Not to mention the times were I disconnect and two turns have passed in the time it takes to get back into the game)

I just wanted to take some time to appreciate one of the best shitposts: Babbling Book Copypasta.
---
Babbling Book Copypasta is quickly becoming one of my favorite shitposts. It's just so positive and generous. Practically takes nothing at all to post, you copy it on your browser and that chill ass motherfucker gives you some sweet karma to use later in your profile. And you also get this adorable little post that can get some replies but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the BBC is just so positive. It comes on the subreddit like "This is so positive and uplifting!" and I'm like "yeah BBC we are friends now let's do this shit" and when people reply they're like "I like this" in a cute voice and I'm like "yeah I like this too". It doesn't say some bullshit whiny shit like "they nerfed card art" like the other shitposts, it's just like "this is so positive." And it looks so happy. I mean this is a small copypasta that literally thinks a card is happy. It understands all of Hearthstone is a happy gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. I mean look at his face he's just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when Babbling Book Copypasta is on the subreddit. IDK if it's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now it is a pretty chill shitpost.
---
Not everyone. Those who do stick out of course. But I believe the majority of this community are decent folk.
---
&gt; Odd/Even is an extreme deck restriction
---
&gt; all the board flood synergy cards are odd-costed
---
&gt; all the Warlock board clears, twilight drake, and mountain giant are even costed
---
Do you suppose that's why I said it's not a restriction? What cards would wild odd paladin like to run, but isn't? Minibot, maybe annoy-o-tron, and tarim. I doubt they'd even want to run crystal lion honestly. Honestly the one and only card that odd paladin would be excited about is tarim. That's 29 cards that would otherwise be near perfect.
---
Even lock? Zilliax, Mortal Coil, and Voidlord. Without a Mana cheat method malganis becomes somewhat pointless. The only other consideration is healbot. That's at most 7 cards different. Again, not a reatriction, or certainly not much of one.
---
Again, compare this to spell hunter for an actual restriction. Hunter has got some great spells but there are a few beasts and not mechs which synergize amazingly with some spells but for rhok and TMS that's not an option. And consider the upside of those 2 cards and the fact they must be drawn compared to a vastly improved hero power from the beginning of the game.
---
Deck-restriction perks are fine so long as they're not immediate, powerful, and permanent, like genn/Baku. That was their problem. No matter what I did you could *always* at a **minimum** make 2 new 1/1s that synergize with your deck every turn. That's a problem.
---
The card is not released yet. But once it is, you do it from your collection, there should be a button that says craft :)
---
By that logic everything that spawns 2+ minions is like twinspell. This is an awful comparison, reborn is nothing like twinspell.
---
Okay, thanks

How?

Spent less on hearthstone and buy a laptop/desktop
---
Thats wrong.
---
When they nerf cards, they dont only make them simpler just because reasons. They didnt nerfed patches to make it simpler either.
---
For example, the recent reckless experimenter nerf made her more complex, adding a limit to her effect, and creating situations were people wonder if reckless + mechwarper  or reckless + the hunter kft spider reduces the cost to 0 or the limit of the experimenter still makes it unable to be lower than 1.
---
Not in wild lul
---
And at rank 20

Well I'd say that arena is the best way when you have a good level because it can make you save gold and sometimes reward you with dust or cards

And also check guides on internet for the best safe-to-dust cards because a lots of cards are not used and it can make you easy dust
---
Yes. And if you can do that then you do that. But if your opponent owns the board then you play out a bunch of snipsnaps
---
It happens that I rope „accidentally“ because I watch TV at the same time and theres a good scene or do something else while play. I guess a lot of people that do the same. Its not always mal intent. This behavior is born out of waiting for other ropers.
---
yeah that’s correct, kind of common sense in my opinion i was just confused why they brought it up as if it was an argument lol

Well, okay. I do believe you though.

People are different. And people new to gaming are not that used to how female characters have looked before.
---
The recent update allows multitarget spells to be cast with only one target on the board.  So Multi-Shot, Cleave, Forked Lightning, etc.
---
I'm a bit out of the loop, but did they fix the iOS version of the app by any chance?
---
1. You can say it's not a rumor, but all you have is your opinion to back you up. It's an unverified account of events dude. A rumor. You REALLY REALLY believing in the rumor doesn't make it less so.
---
2. I can't believe I have to point this out but I guess you missed it. I was calling out the dramatic and entitled attitude players like you have over insignificant things. Using such a loaded term as censorship in this case makes you look childish. 
---
Don't think it's insignificant? Good for you. Just like you can complain about these changes I can complain about the annoying gamers who make the biggest deals about things that don't matter.
---
I feel sorry for your friend that spectated your match. Poor guy probably just wanted to complete the "Spectate a Friend" quest quickly.
---
This is awesome for legendary cards. They should do this for all of them. Would look great
---
GodJohnson#11613 NA. I show you go first thank you!
---
You get a guranteed legendary in the first 10 packs you buy, so buy them one by one until you get one and switch to another expansion. That should net you enough to craft Whizbang :) As  far as i know you still get a Deathknight and some  packs for completing the single player prololgue of Frozen Throne. That gives you some more dust :)
---
Yes it is loooool. Bomb warrior is control warrior with some cards removed in favor of bombs. 
---
In what matchups is it "agressive"? Pogo and mage it tries to kill the opponent instead of trying to remove everything. But to use the word "agressive" is dead wrong. It's not a tempo deck in the majority of cases and even when it is it's not at a speed that could be described as "aggressive"

Is it, though?  And even if it were a kids card game, why was [this](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/File:Succubus(208).png) OK for over 6 years in the game's lifespan?  
---
What changed to make it suddenly kid inappropriate?
---
If you do both, do you get two golden legendary cards?
---
I would like the felstalker art if the change made any sense. A small part of the blackrock mountain adventure was removed as a result.
---
A Succubus dressed as a nun would make much more sense as a change than flatout changing and renaming the card. Insert “It would be too confusing for new players” meme.

ORIGINAL JOKE
---
Yeah I've done this a few times and then just swing face with your new board clear to win. The thing that always terrifies me is that they might play flark into me after I do it but it hasn't happened yet.

I don’t think it got fixed, unless it was within literally the past couple hours. This crap just happened to me.
---
"anti-chinese xenophobia" hahahahaha wtf.
---
Reporters Without Borders ranks China's press situation as "very serious", the worst ranking on their five-point scale.
---
In August 2012, the OpenNet Initiative classified Internet censorship in China as "pervasive" in the political and conflict/security areas and "substantial" in the social and Internet tools areas, the two most extensive classifications of the five they use.
---
Freedom House, a US backed NGO, ranks the press there as "not free", the worst ranking, saying that "state control over the news media in China is achieved through a complex combination of party monitoring of news content, legal restrictions on journalists, and financial incentives for self-censorship," and an increasing practice of "cyber-disappearance" of material written by or about activist bloggers.
---
China has some of the most extreme censorship of any country. Not liking censorship isn't xenophobic, and I can't see how you could ever perceive it as such. China has demanded that games be censored in the past, and developers have met those demands. It's not that unreasonable to assume that China could be the reason for the recent artwork changes, it could be completely unrelated, but it could not. Educate yourself.
---
What do you mean get rid of messaging. 
---
50% of my fun in this game is discovering new insults when I accept post-game friends requests.
---
Playing the game to extract the most vaue from your deck increases your chance to win. There will always be a chance that you lose playing perfectly. That's what makes the game fun. 
---
If there was a way to play 100% correctly and always win, then the game would be solitaire and dead. 
---
If you have a 90% chance to win, you still lose 1 out of 10 games. This post is complaining about the 10% and asking to change the other 90%.
---
It's a metaphor. The quicksand is really just your body's immune system telling you how dead you are.
---
It’s not impossible, but the simplest explanation is usually the correct one and laying that many people off saved Activision a lot of money, which is the end goal for all corporations.
---
I feel like the changes would have been better received if they just made the art Bob Ross.
---
This works really well for those seeking a phone background:

---
Okey, man.
---
 Here's a high resolution of this beatiful piece [https://imgur.com/a/MCG2AEO](https://imgur.com/a/MCG2AEO)
---
In Photoshop and similar tools they have different layer types. You add a layer set to color which adds only the color values to the layers below it, which if black and white, will make them the color of whatever is painted above.
---
It looks to me like they probably flattened the color layer to the black and white one (merged them into one image) and did all the details painted in color rather than use a new black and white layer and worked in color for most of the process.
---
The black and white "coloring" is probably just to get a feel for the lighting, values, and contrast before doing all the details and realizing your light source is off or the picture doesn't draw your eye the right way. 
---
Blizzard may also want to see the work as it's being done because with card games they usually only give a sentence or two of detail for the art and some concept art to show the artist what the feel of the set is supposed to be. 
---
I know MTG does an artist workshop for 3-4 weeks where 6-12 artists just draw based on the ideas and concept photos and by the end have an extensive art guide for the set with how all the races, architecture, symbolism,  etc should look before they even make art for an actual card.
---
Is that my boi Jujimufu
---
Lol, you have terrible reading comprehension, hope you get better at it before you get close to graduating high school
---
I did this once in a Warrior mirror and we both just kept roping. I Had alot of time but goddamn the Match lasted for over an hour.
---
The old card was terrible too.
---
I agree. Most of the new art is superior in quality.
---
Unfortunately, Nozari is a character that predates the creation of Reno by quite a while, almost a decade I think. She's a member of the Keepers of Time faction in WoW, added in Burning Crusade.
---
Also Reno is the Mage legendary apparently.
---
Yeah, I was bummed it didn't get replaced in this batch.

Wow
---
It's great for new players, but I feel like new players aren't going to be saving up all their gold for a solo adventure normally though. Seems counterproductive.
---
They're only valuable as long as the game exists. We can't even keep our collection when Blizzard stop supporting the game in a few years.
---
Ur joking right
---
This seems very similar to the WoW storyline right now. Old gods are so hot right now.
---
Idk man a Tauren being foken impaled by a huge arrow isn't child friendly imo
---
So basically, every class vs priest...well I sure hope we get some narrow but powerful spells and quick
---
Hearthstone is using Unity so it's supposedly quite easy to mod. There is a tool called umod for example but after googling it shows few different tools with different websites. I never done it so you will have to research on your own. Of course there is always risk that it will get you banned if blizzard is checking resource files.
---
Its definitely not legit becouse this card sucks donkey balls. It would never cost 2 mana. They would made it at least 1 or Even a 0.
---
Head crack is the only change I like.  Eviscerate is the strangest change by far.

Goddamn this song is good.
---
The key point in all of this to me is WHO CAAAAARES. I wasn't playing this game to see tiddies and I never even noticed if cards had blood or not. I'd look at the card art when cards first came out and then never think about it again. Like, ok if you have ideological problem with Chinese censorship or whatever, good for you, but were you really expecting Blizzard to fight that at the cost of the largest market in the world? The bottom line to me is: does this really make a difference to someone enough to make a big deal out of it? I just can't imagine caring about this enough to complain, let alone have a days long circle jerk about it.

and i can't see how "disliking reparations and redistribution" is related to the history of the soviet union. I dislike it as well because it *doesn't work*, it just feeds corporate control and a combination of inflation and rent-seeking totally eliminates any actual benefit

"I will be your death!" 
---
*Plays Millhouse*
---
But you can only draw a dude with an afro in so many different different ways before all the cards start looking too similar.
---
How would this happen? Kinda looks like you were buying packs for the wrong account all this time.
---
Also don't open too many packs of one expansion. After certain number, you will start to get a lot of cards that you already own. From time to time search for "missing" cards in the collection manager and filter it by expansion. Keep and eye on the number of rare and common cards, those are the guaranteed on each pack. If you already got a legendary and the missing common and rares are almost 0 there is no point in opening more packs, worst case your next legendary would be in 40 packs and there should be other expansions where you still miss more common cards. Any common and rare duplicate is "wasted" gold or money because how disenchanting gives you less value that what crafting costs per card. You can't get duplicate legendary cards so they are safe to craft. But rare and common cards not.
---
Yes, the PCGamer article. Point is, they did communicate this aspect, even if it may appear a bit vague.
---
He really didn't though, "I would look/glance it's intentional" is ENTIRELY wrong mate, not even remotely close

iOS
---
No worries.    Ill do any where from 3  all the way up 15 games..  Really depends how the cards are drawing. Some days you just never pull what you need and others seem to hVe every tool neeeded when they need it.   I've had days where I've hit the cap on the gold you earn through wins in a day..    I'm not super high on the ranked ladder..  Highest I've gotten to is 7.    Usually the quests are easily done in 3 or 4 games. But even if u get just 1 of them done, the other 2 are usually going to have some progress in them as well, and that leaves the open space for the daily reset and the new quest to take its space.
---
Wait I have played for 4 years, are beginning turns shorter than turns that come after?
---
I don't know but we are at that stage yet. All games die eventually but Blizzard won't stop making Hearthstone expansions anytime soon.
---
So if I buy through th web site it will eventually still charge me the same. ?

I'm all in for C'Thun support.

Yes, you are technically correct. But I still wish they did it directly to the playerbase instead. Right now, the credit goes to PC Gamer for deciding to interview them, I guess.

Makes zero sense
---
Oof. I was hoping blizzard had made some changes to gold gain. Thanks for the info. 
---
Do you think I should buy some packs from the recent  expansion, or just pool all my money for the new expansion.

Good to know. Think I'm going to jump back in. Thank you :)

Leeroy is Iconic not only For HS, but the whole Warcraft universe. I doubt they Will ever change it.

No. Buying it through Blizzard shop is cheaper. There’s no benefit from buying it from your mobile device. It’s more expensive just because Apple/Google want a part of the money themselves.

What about karazhan tho

That’s ones mad catchy

I can agree with that, i am on my mission to finish all the chapters with all the classes
---
I finished chapter 1 and 2 fully, and finished 6 classes in chapter 3 (note: i finished chapter 4 and 5 with at least 1 class) 
---
Priest was so hard before the extra arm buff and replacing mind blast with talonpriest, i finished chapter 3 with priest after the replace, i can safely say priest and warlock are the hardest classes to finish the heist with.
---
Warlock doesnt have good pool of cards or even the synergy between puckets, you cant go full discard because every time its the same cards or same card 2 or 3 times in the same pucket, even with big demons you will get the weapon more than any other card, zoo is so bad for warlock in the heist because warlock doesnt have the fuel or the health to do what you want to do. And the hero powers none of them really good, all of them have "take 2 damage" all the other classes have unique hero powers or at least one hero power that so different than the original one
---
Mage have the reduce cost 
---
Hunter have the 1 mana minion
---
Warrior have the bombs
---
Paladin have the divine shield
---
Rogue have the burgle
---
Priest have reduce attack
---
Shaman with the draw or evolve
---
Druid healing a minion 
---
But warlock all of his hero powers deals damage to him self although they are different on what they do, but they are similar for taking damage (i hate taking damage from my hero power) specially when my health is way lower than my opponent
---
Tl:dr 
---
They need to adjust the card pool for warlock and make them better
---
So now you know he knows, and he probably knows you know that he knows.

It's 1 month before the new expansion. U know they won't nerf stuff anymore at this point. Wait until new decks come out and go complain on the reddit
---
A pretty identical change, but I guess the argument is more about what pre-nerf warsong commander allows, even for wild
---
I noticed this too and planned a few moves around it. I was sorely disappointed.
---
But he also is after creating chaos and destroying / restarting azeroth. In his last dying breath (or last free breath before being imprisoned) he might of just said "fuck it" but idk not gonna know until November.
---
But they aren't in most cases. They didn't change Confessor Paletress or Aviana, for example. So maybe it's only bad if obviously evil characters are wearing skimpy outfits?
---
Sure but that art style isn't very prevalent in this game anyway. It's almost like they are trying to say that the very existence of above-average sized breasts is inherently slutty, which is way more offensive.
---
Druid ran that card in previous metas in wild.
---
In theory, it could happen if your only card in hand was Chameleos, too, right?
---

so they're reusing the plot from every wow expansion ever?

How the fuck do some people still spend 1423 words on this topic.

Go on pornhub, rub one off and get over it!
---
They have to fit the good guy classes and its actually the most fitting roles for them. Brann and Finley fit well in their roles and Reno definitely cant be a Druid. Characters don't have to be 100% representative of their classes too. They can mix it up a bit.
---
Zerek's list used the 4 mana res and the Spellstone.

The topic of Warcraft lore? I mean... Some people like fantasy stuff. And no thanks.

I used Nozdormu on her once,and it seemed to disable the timer completely. The rope disappeared when I played him and I seemed to have infinite time. It went back to  the normal 25s when he died tough.
---
How can you not see the sarcasm?  Let’s talk about who’s the sense one here.
---
Oh geeze, Reno's finally going to tell us how he singlehandedly beat that 29/29 C'Thun.

We didn't know because it hadn't happened yet.  
---
I will say that Lazul is the only one of the League of E.V.I.L. who seems concerned about Rafaam watching them. Like, everyone else is chill about going to see Bob the Bartender. ...but when she does it, she says things like "Rafaam isn't watching, let's rest a bit" and things like that.

American movies, shows and music are as common in the UK as British ones. An American game doesn’t sound “weird” in the UK. The same is not true in Spain or Latin America.

Players must've missed your memo. I'm a R3-5 and haven't seen Mind Blast from standard priests since before RotS. Got hit by a rogue though.
---
I agree, but have to admit that OC may be onto something. I don't think Reno is Nozari, but I do think he's a dragon of some kind
---
Search for "Sailor Moon PSAs" if you wanna see some diamonds of american tv...

Well, he was the final challenge in each "wing," so he was a boss in that sense.

I mean yeah, they unnerfed molten giant and moved it to wild
---
Stop advertising your circlejerk crap here thanks
---
Doesn’t this only work on the slight chance that you draw Tilanji?
---
You just stopped at the bar and shuffled more copies of your friends into your list.
---
I'm not saying that it was making the class viable in the current meta, I'm saying that mind blast being gone makes it even less likely to become viable in future expansions. Sorry if I worded that badly.

And with Dr Boom’s hero power allowing you to use the discover a mech feature more than twice, the odds increase even more and give you a high chance of ever discovering two of them
