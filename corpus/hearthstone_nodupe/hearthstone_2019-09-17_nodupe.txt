This is confusing, they should use the same rules as Auto-Chess qualifiers for consistency.
---
So many people playing this deck with success which is why we're seeing a lot more combo priests too.  
---

---
Glad people are countering with that instead of fucking control warrior, please don't let that become any more common.
---
not elegant
---
People seem to forget that Hero cards *actually* display the hero power. They totally can do it, and they did it during Frozen Throne (and with recent Hero cards) but nothing for quests, and generated cards.  
---
More deck slots would be too confusing for new players, but not saying what Ysera's Dream Cards do is fine. This logic is beyond me.

---
Fyi this is 35/45 cards, or 78%. Are you telling me that the packs you get with ToT will give you cards which are 78% meta, once you account for the metric fuck-tonne of duplicates? That's 59 of the 75 cards you'll get cannot be duplicates and also have to be meta. And in that time, you're liable to get only 1 legendary, not 5 as you're guaranteed to get in Karazhan.
---
This guy has a material proof
---
You're also guarenteed 3 uncommons and a rare or a mythic. And mythics are 1/8, not 1/20.
---
Comparing it to MTG packs is just a bad idea. There are too many factors that are different between them.
---
I mean, compared to the "FTP" of most mobile games, yeah, hs is a lot better
---
Took me longer than i wish to get it
---
You vs the guy she told you not worry about...
---
Finley alone: 6 packs, badass, strong 11/3.
---
Finley on bug: 0 packs, cute, weak 0/1 (the bug is golden scarab 2/2).
---
They need a separate server you pay a monthly fee on that has much more dust and no money transactions
---
People don‚Äôt see it this way. They just see that there‚Äôs resell value so that makes it automatically cheaper.
---
If you pay 80$ for zilliax and later down the line ones it rotates to wild you sell it for 20$. You lost 60$. As opposed to only losing 12$ if you were disenchanting it. 
---
Also, it is very important to remember that you can sell your account. This might not sit well with blizzard but it‚Äôs an option.
---
I'm still F2P.  Can't get cheaper than that.
---
I feel like 1200 dust legendaries wouldn't be that bad. It still would take significant saving/pack buying to stay standard or meta, but would make it at least feel somewhat more attainable
---
Hey, you're good. Hearthstone can be surprisingly complicated sometimes.
---
huh? Those tournaments were giving packs before?
---
This is probably why seiko had to use his phone during GM, to find out about tokens he doesn't know about. 4Head /s
---
Cairne, Ysera or Sludge Belcher. Also, chillwind yeti now that i think about it. Cairne was really just a third and fourth chillwind yeti.
---
or they could just make it to where cost reduction cards dont reduce below 1.
---
Leeroy, especially when it‚Äôs a strong standard card in the classic set that fits into your current deck
---
I thought it had been relevant since if you finish a season in top 200 legend, you get an invite to master's tour ladder qualifier?
---
THx for explaining . I play HS but in Standard and I haven't heard about this before .
---
Leeroy, Thalnos and Alexstraza are the quintessential classic legendaries that see play most of the time. Since you‚Äôre playing more aggressive decks - it has to be Leeroy.
---
Of course they are aiming for synergy with it but when Vulture doesn't see play in the next 2+ turns and they are playing against an aggro deck you've got to wonder why they bothered playing it.  
---
Without any synergy playing a 4/5 against aggro that also damages your hero is not a good play.  I usually outright ignore the card now if it has got no synergy and does pose any overly obvious threat
---
Why would the current system not allow someone like RDU to requalify for GM if he was relegated? sorry, out of the loop
---
yes. you get 20 packs for top 4 in qualifiers
---
Well, I don't know where you live but where i live, it's cheaper to buy an expansion set box than a hs 50 pack. Plus you can't sell some of the cards to pay for that pack you bought, which was what I did when I bought a box of fate reforged and dragons of tarkir, made 250 bucks out of them, replaced them with low value cards from the store and sold them as opened expansion packs online, in total i made close to 400 bucks.
---
Blizzard: "Hmm. People are reducing sn1p sn4p to 0 cost. That's a problem. We want it to cost at least 1."
---
New guy at Blizzard: "What if we add some text saying it can't be reduced below 1?"
---
Blizzard: "Too confusing. Sn1p Sn4p now costs 4. That way when it would have been 0 it is now 1. Problem solved."
---
Ads and it's on Overwolf, which in my experience is nothing but a clunky experience.
---
From my understanding, the $20 pre-order goes away and the $15 purchase appears.  No cardback or legendary.  Maybe it's possible to kerjigger the payment system to pay for the pre-order later but that also sounds like a way of getting your account suspended.
---
Hearthstone can be more fun due the high amount of unexpected elements (RNG), allowing games with crazy and powerful interactions, but because of this, it's way less competitive than MTG were games are more chess-like, also being able to play cards in your opponent's turn lead to games where player's decisions are crucial.
---
Just a side note, there could be trolls changing their ID to CNBattleWolf just to troll people over, or hide their identity when they cheat. Similar logic with fake serial killer. Same thing happened on CN server after they banned an infamous cheater. 
---
So what you or your friends encounter might actually be different people.
---
I only played when the game first came out, I haven't touched it in years.. but your argument is really weak. Just because there's something wrong with a game we should just abandon it and jump ship? That's silly, it's like we can't criticize a game at all without people screaming to play another game. I haven't even played in years like the fuck good job shilling for EA
---
How about a chain? There's 4 lords and ladies in Wailing Caverns so you could have Lord Cobrahn summon Lady Anacondra and make her a 4/6 deathrattle summon Lord Pythas who is also a 4/6 deathrattle summon Lord Serpentis who's just a plain 4/6.
---
An added bit of advice:  As you're ranking from 50 to 25, spread your early gold around between the sets.  You'll get a guaranteed legendary and epic card in the first 10 packs of each set and that can give you a huge bonus to your starting collection.
---
Steam does price matching according to country. Blizzard does not. A pack is 2 euros. It is almost 14 turkish liras. For 5 cards. I will never ever buy a single pack. Starting to get it? They could've taken so much of my money. Now they don't get a dime because of their stupid pricing policy. And there are thousands of players like me.
---
Murloc Shaman, Highlander Hunter, Aggro Warrior all can do well.
---
I jsut wish Warrior had a label "I am control warrior" so I could concede early.  
---
I enjoy the Aggro Warrior matchups but they share some similar early cards to control so you can never be too sure.
---
To be fair, the identified elixirs do have different art/names to indicate they are a new card.
---
HSreplay by class
---
HS Replay. It's their front page overall class winrate data.
---
Got this too. Had to reinstall the game
---
It‚Äôs worst match up is Overload Aggro Shaman. 3 attack Likkim lines up nicely early and you have a lot of ways to control the board. But it has a hard time with warriors and druids conversely.
---
This is why i can only play my megafin deck and also only in wild :(
---
Warlock is really good in wild for what it's worth.
---
Wait when does it release??
---
Combo priest is an aggro deck.  The "combo" is divine spirit inner fire.
---
Oh, duh. 
---
Well the natural predator to aggro is midrange, maybe try a midrange shaman with cheap removal and efficient threats. Once you establish a board with removal spells generally the game is over.
---
Play [[Sir Finley of the Sands]] first to assert dominance.

CNBattleWolf coming soon to a Masters Tournament near you.

2/2/3 Murloc | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, Discover an upgraded Hero Power.  
---
I completely disagree. I saved up for 40 packs and bought the most recent bundle that gave you mostly a variety of older packs. That's it for this expansion- no pre-order this time (the past several expansions I did). Yet I have the complete deck lists for quest shaman, aggro warrior, Highlander Hunter, and combo priest. I even have the off-meta hand paladin, though that doesn't require a lot of new cards. Point is, without spending nearly $200 each expansion I am able to craft and play plenty of meta decks and enjoy myself.
---
I had a run in arena where I played fishflinger turn 2, and it gave him sir finley of the sands which he played the next turn. Turns out he also had OG Reno
---
Killerofhero#1645 NA. Wanting to trade gold quest. I show then you go first.
---
I'd argue that we just got three more decks that are as unfun to play against as Control Warrior, in Priest killing you from nowhere with 6 year old Vanilla combos, Quest Shaman generating a win condition from thin air by rolling Lackey generators ad infinitum or summoning 8 drops as early as t3 or Quest Druid which is such a horribly designed, massively overtuned deck that up to 90% of it's list comes exclusively from the latest expansion and rewards unspent mana. Something which the devs outright said they would never do (during Brode's time) because it's not right to reward a player for doing nothing. Not least with a Hero Power that completely removes the balancing on the Choose One cards. Control Warrior is no longer as prevalent (thankfully) but now it's not the only potentially problematic deck in the format.
---
Just nerf the echo mechanic to not being able to be reduced below 1. Slight mana cheating isn't the issue, infinite value is.
---
*More* P2W then, if you prefer.
---
And EU gets the short end again? How surprising...

What‚Äôs wrong with League? The fact that champions are locked? I think its fine.
---
Awesome, and thanks for the video!
---
Localization might happen some day, but for now unfortunately I don't have the bandwidth to handle it properly.
---
The complaints are 2 fold:
---
1.) The deck is strong. It utilizes a combo where when you have a summoning portal (reduces the cost minions by 2, not below 1); mechwarper (reduces the cost of mechs by 1) Snip will cost 0 mana and you can echo/magnetize him on mechs as much as your APM gets you, typically making a mech (which you ideally left over from the previous turn so it can attack) with 32-34ish attack. 
---
Even if you disrupt the combo, dirty rat the snip, it won't help that much, because the deck is capable of just as strong plan B OTK. You need a mech leftover just like plan A and play: summoning portal, glind, mechwarper 3x, so now you have 6 minions on board and the cost of a zilliax in your hand is again, 0 and you can echo/magnetize for an OTK.
---
If all of this fails, all of your mechwarpers are dealt with or whatever, fear not! There is plan C, combo out with Mecha'thun. Yup, you can still win even after your opponents dismantle 2 combo chains. 
---
But how is any of this not clunky, slow, etc? Well, the deck is basically card draw on steroids and combo cards, no half-measures.
---
And for point B, whats the issue besides being really powerful?
---
Well it turns out, there are creative players who either use bugs to get around the animation time or outright use 3rd party software that removes animation time, which allows them to vomit out an actually impossible amount of echo-snips, meaning instead of 30 power on the board, they end up with 100.
---
Try using that website called Google.com
---
Fixing the ‚Äúdust system‚Äù is literally just reducing the cost to players.
---
‚ÄúGive me more dust for less‚Äù is pretty much all anyone here is posting.
---
Every option I‚Äôve read here comes down to the basic: more dust per pack. Either increase value of common/rare, or increase drop rate of epic/legendary. Or reduce the amount of legendaries needed for a meta-deck, which decreases the value of legendaries. 
---
The minds of thousands of players should be able to come up with a valid option more than just the few figuring out the game. Plenty of companies use feedback and ideas from customers to figure out solutions. 
---
A doctor is given solutions to problems in schooling, very few of them create solution. You want the makers to invent ideas that don‚Äôt exist. Any doctor you go to visit for a check up, are not the ones that are creating brand new technology to cure diseases.
---
Well, there are minions with "must be blocked" effects (which is sort of... reverse taunt I guess?). There don't seem to be any cards that specify they must block if able though, which is interesting.
---
Yeah, that's why I don't play the game anymore. Too expensive.

---
Make the animation time longer so you have to be an apm Warrior to play the deck. And even then it won‚Äôt be enough to otk.
---
You get much more value with combining multiple doubled battlecries or Shudderwock. With siamat being 9 mana you can only gain value from him..

I don't know what video you watched, but 6k isn't a budget deck at all... I would barely even call it a cheap deck. Budget deck is like 1-2k dust at most. 
---
6k is just "not crazy expensive", but it's certainly not "budget".
---
As for the rest... You get 30,000 dust a year just for completing your daily quests/weekly tavern brawls.
---
The game is a bit rough at the start, but once you're in it, it's super easy to craft good decks, even as F2P.
---
(For reference, I'm F2P, and I'm currently playing 5 decks worth &gt;50k dust in total)
---
If you're really new, then you don't need to craft a super competitive deck right now; You can play with the other noobs, get lots of quest along the way, and craft a deck when you hit rank 20 or something.
---
What is the cheat?
---
Insequent#11115 NA 80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first.
---
I don't tell you how it works very correctly, but what they do is to remove a file with the animations. So you don't need to wait to play Sn1p-Sn4p
---
Just do it with jade druid, you literally only need like 6 cards.
---
Yarrrrr Jim lad
---
I have some screen shots of this type of stuff with mech hunter
---
Ah, great point. Yes I do mean activision. Actually I think the parent company is called Activision Blizzard, right? If so then that‚Äôs what I meant.
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. Don't get sucked into the grind. Avoid grindy games. Go play games that are, well, games, and not micro-transaction-machines that require you to either pay or grind, *unless* you enjoy the grind *or* don't mind paying.
---
Don't force yourself through the grind to enjoy some gameplay later. That's, quite simply, psychologically manipulative. I know that the majority of games are like this these days, but that doesn't make it any better.
---
This is true for any game: If you don't enjoy the grind, don't play the game at all. No matter how cool the content is that's locked behind the grind. It's just not worth it.
---
Eternal F2P &gt; HS F2P
---
I do watch him, but after some point it seems like my fault
---
Is that an ultrapunch?
---
Or you could, you know, buy the pack for ¬£1.49 instead of buying a return flight, accommodation, taxi/car hire and food in a foreign country. Crazy, I know.
---
Control Shaman .. Quest&gt;Hex&gt;Kragwa = Lots more hexes .. Run tinkmaster or cards like Saronite Taskmaster, etc to mess with their ress pool ..
---
Imo hearthstone is pretty good for a grindy mobile game
---
I think the part regarding packs is for the master tour qualifiers that are held online.
---
50%
---
That sounds hilarious actually, in a depressing sort of way
---
Lol I honestly didn't know and I play him everyday. I know about shadow madness thougj
---
4k dust if you don't pull any cards you need and not counting the legend from the first 10 packs.
---
First of all, *never* pay the regular store prices. With all the bundles and preorders, you can spend however much you want on a 1 pack, 1 dollar ratio. Welcome pack will be over twice as efficient. 
---
But it's perfectly possible to get into this game quickly. The rank 50-20 player experience will give you plenty to get started. Just properly use the disenchant system.
---
Get out with your facts, hating on blizzard here
---
This is great - it also proves that the game is pretty uch extremely random and much like a casino. But we knew that, didnt we? ;)

---
You seem to be stuck in 1 on 1 tempo style play ... you don't seem to understand how aggro decks work?  
---
&gt;1 minion at a time.  
---
Because there is only ever 1 minion on board in aggro matchups right ... /s
---
&gt;Right, you better tap and pass instead. /s  
---
Because warlock isn't an aggro deck and never had any other cards in hand  ... /s 
---
&gt;Except you're judging based on omniscience that you very simply don't have. Can you see the rest of their hand?  
---
I can see the plays that came later and often playing a couple of low cost minions they later played that were in hand is FAR better than dropping thrasher.  You do know you can track your opponents deck right?  
---
&gt;If they're playing against Aggro Warrior like your example implies, anyone can tell you that Neferset Thrasher is a better Turn 3 than Tap + Pass.  
---
IF that was your only play but when it's not it's just bad play if you had ability to drop a couple of other minions in it's place.  
---
Again it's easy to track why it's bad play and dropping it without a plan is bad play.
---
Played both YuGiOh and hearthstone. Hearthstone is definitely cheaper but there is a lower number of cards per deck compared to YuGiOh. It is also digital so it is way more convenient to me compared to YuGiOh.
---
siamat is seven mana though
---
I agree, and it's been busted for a hell of a long time. It's one of those cards where you just go: "why the fuck hasn't this been nerfed at any point?"
---
[[Obsidian Statue]] summons it next to him even though he digs it from the ground, right?

You have to craft cards first though

Meanwhile the best deck in the game contains 2 legends, 1 of which completely optional.

Dont argue with idiots, its impossible to win
---
My conspiracy theory is that it's random, since you don't see what your opponent CAN pick.

200 IQ answer. A single card is not a deck. He is not asking about a deck, but a single card

TINY FLIES!

Fair enough
---
They plan on releasing adventures 6 to 8 weeks after the set to spread out events and content in Hearthstone. They agreed with the community that HS had too bland a calendar but their solution was just to spread existing stuff out rather than give more stuff and more content.

---
Its not a fix of the interaction, the interaction right now its how it should work. Its how multiple aura effects apply their effects, this is consistent.
---
The problem is with 0 mana echoes, but mainly, with people haking the client to play 100 snip snaps a turn and make the opponent miss theirs by watching the animations. Snip snap warlock being played by someone that is not haking is a perfectly normal deck, that plays in a similar fashion to Inner fire/divine spirit priest.
---
You guys are all thinking of solutions to a problem that doesnt exist because you just heard someone getting banned unfairly. The problem is not the deck existing, is people haking with it. It may be snip snap now, but the next one could be radiant elemental + shadow vision spam, just like during ungoro.
---
IIFC, it is even worse then that because if you get disconnected, then you reconnect and manage to win, it would still count as a lost

Wow that's like, a new bug or something
---
Dude, I don't understand how Reddit does not get this. F2P is an insane craze for the gaming industry since the mobile Candy-Crush-style games exploded all over their faces and made money heads-over-heels.
---
These companies have spent hours and money to research how to nickle and dime the most cash out of their customers. Do you really think that the biggest players in a billion dollar industry are not doing these most basic calculations when there's so much money at stake? If the AAA has proven anything in the last 15 years of decline then that they're only happy if they make ALL the money - because making A LOT is not good enough.
---
Yes, elasitcity is a thing, but you forget that every customer group has a different elasiticty. Dolphins and Whales are way less elastic, they just buy everything until their need is satisfied and don't care about the money (In this case, gettin' all your decks). So Blizz will adjust their pricing towards the most lucrative group and that would mean the whales - not the casual and not the smart buyer.
---
They can target them with awesome single-player modes like the new Dalaran thing for example.
---
I believe with all of their data, they are more familiar with their business model than a bunch of people that play the game and want to play the game cheaper.
---
Almost every company has people saying ‚Äúif it was cheaper, I would buy.‚Äù But that doesn‚Äôt always maximize profits. It just means more transactions. 
---
HS, just like any company, pushes the price upward until they start to see a loss in profits. They don‚Äôt just drop prices hoping for a boost in sales. They have a mechanism to gauge from how many people buy preorders, how sales pricing affects sales.
---
They also introduce more and more legendaries each expansion to adjust how much an average meta deck costs. The more legendaries get released, the more legendaries get played in decks. They are introducing more legendaries, so my guess would be, they are finding people more willing to buy more $1 packs to get enough dust to craft all the legendaries needed. An average deck might have used to cost 5000, Blizzard makes more vital legendaries to push an average deck cost to 7000. This is an artificial way to increase prices without adjusting the actual cost of a pack.
---
The increase in OP cards actually adds to the fun of the game. Zephyr is a pretty damn fun card. Or puzzle box.
---
They‚Äôve adjusted from 1-2 expansions a year to 3. They may have lost some customers with so many cards being released, but they probably see more revenue dispute the loss of customers.
---
Most players are F2P and will always be F2P. The consumer always thinks optimistically with price drops... 60 new people will buy them if the price is lower, but they always estimate on the unrealistically high. It doesn‚Äôt use data, but just ‚Äúwhat-ifs.‚Äù 
---
Well what if the drop in price only had 10 more people buy packs. 100 people @ $50 vs. 110 people @ $30. I‚Äôm would venture to say Blizzard has a more realistic idea of how numbers shift than me or you based on price. Additionally, they aren‚Äôt going to adjust the price per pack, but the number of epics/legendaries per expansion.
---
Looks like the wax elemental has one of those dino grabber toys attached to his arm
---
I agree. But that wasn't the point. Being F2P to reach legend is totally different from just using the basic set to reach legend.
---
If you crafter zephyr I would have gone for brann to finish a bit more of the highlander hunter deck...
---
But leeroy is a good all arround neutral legendary that will always be used in aggresive decks and will never rotate out. So I would say I agree with your decision.

fast 80g quest, you first
---
Because this is the least elegant design ever.
---
Yeah the last time I think he was used in a serious deck and a loot hoarder wasnt a replacement for it because you either already run 2 or you needed the spell power too was in Razakus Priest. Thats already some long time ago...
---
I'm really disappointed, I wanted to try this because it looks so slick. I play on a surface pro because I love the touch screen. The app uses so much memory to load it's ads that I couldn't both watch ads and play the game. I would try it again if you gave me an option to get rid of the ads so I could actually use it...
---
(I preface this by saying i've done my research on this due to my job, but I'm to lazy to scramble together all the links to the souces, 'cause i'm sure I did delete most of them at some point)  
---
It depends on the game. Some are more whale-heavy than others. LoL for example had a really low avg. spending (Data was from 2015) of about \~1.5$ per user compared to World of Tanks clockin in at 4-5$. But LoL is friggin fuckin' huge, so I can see that it makes sense for them to let casuals buy cheap 5$ skins for their favourite champ every once in a while.
---
On the other end of the spectrum you've games like PoE, where a skinset costs 42$ or if you want to buy the regular supporter packs at 60$ every 3 months. That's 20$ a month, which already puts you in the Dolphin category and out of the casual one.
---
The craziest number i've seen was for a mobile game akin to Candy Crush, where the report showed that about 10% of the users made up \~70% of the sales.
---
But what people can be sure of is: There's a lot of time and research that was spent on this topic and companies don't put their prices willy-nilly.
---
Tbh quite well. U keep throwing murlocs and adding spells to your hand. So most of the time. For me at least.

---
And it's a baby rager!
---
Erm probably shadowverse, although it isnt a very big card game. You get like, 40 packs in an expansion
---
If you're playing Aggro Warrior, you probably run Frothing Berserker. Frothing Berserker has 4 health. Warlock has three ways to deal with a 4-health minion in the most common Zoolock lists:
---
1. Deal 4 damage to it and themselves.
---
2. Deal 4 damage to it, but only 3 damage to themselves.
---
3. Deal 4 damage to it, but discard a card.
---
Depending on the point of the game, there might be a 4th option with Magic Carpet synergy. But those are the three main options. And out of those three options, the second is the most preferable. You'd rather take damage than discard a card, and you'd rather take less damage than discard a card.
---
Neferset Thrasher is the second option, but it also has a benefit I glossed over. 1 is Spirit Bomb and 3 is Soulfire, which are spells that can only answer Frothing Berserker _after_ it's been played. Neferset Thrasher can be played _before_ Frothing Berserker is played, preventing you from playing it. You're then forced to protect the Frothing Berserker from the threat presented, either by putting Taunts in the way or killing the Thrasher before it has a chance to do anything.
---
Therefore, even if there's no obvious reason to play Neferset Thrasher _now,_ it can still be correct to play it anyway because it's better than playing it _later_ after the Frothing Berserker already has a chance to get +5 Attack and bash the Warlock in the face for big damage.
---
Genn isn't taking his Standard ban well, slipping deeper and deeper into the black pit of depression...
---
I feel like most of the people complaining about the "SN1P-SN4P problem" don't even play wild and just assume it's way too overpowered or something. This kind of power isn't abnormal at all for wild, the problem is that people are cheating and instead of trying to find roundabout solutions to dealing with them, maybe they should just be... dealt with?  
---
Clearly Blizzard has the technology to ban people they think are cheating with SN1P-SN4P, and I can't speak on whether they can fix the possibility for people to cheat, but if they start actually consistently banning people for it, it's obviously gonna make most people stop cheating, and the ones who don't stop will just be banned anyways.

---
What you need to do is log out of your account, restart your phone and then log in again
---
Because it's bad. the deck is all about winning the board, giving up your turn 1 and a card in your opening hand (and in the mulligan) goes against fighting for board.
---
I absolutely hate playing against priest. The whole match feels so anxious because they may have drawn inner fire.
---
Dig a hole?

Oh, thanks for the answer.

can you please explain to me what walnut warrior is? and is it connected to [[walnut sprite]] or is it something other? the only thing that i find when i google "walnut warrior" without hearthstone i find prostate cancer websites.

3/3/3 | Echo  
---
It really is redundant in most cases. You win the game by sticking a minion and be able to buff it with Divine Spirit-Inner Fire, which already results in lethal, most of the time.
---
Also early tempo I guess.
---
You're welcome. That's a thing I see a lot, new players saying that it's too expensive. But the truth is that you don't have to spend any money on the game at all, really. It gives you way more rewards than you think, and until you've invested like 80-100 hours of play time in it, you shouldn't even consider paying real currency for it. You don't need all the cards to make decks, and until you get up to level 20 in ranked and start making that grind to Legend, you simply don't need top tier meta decks. 
---
Think of it like a goal post system. Here's the goal posts:
---
- Do the tutorial, and practice mode to unlock all the classes.
---
- Bump each class to 10 to get all the basic cards.
---
- Bump a class to 20 to unlock Tavern Brawls.
---
- Open the packs you've gotten for free so far, and start deckbuilding for Ranked
---
- Play Ranked at level 50 until you get to level 25
---
- If you get bored, alternate with Arena runs with all the free gold you've gathered so far. I do recommend looking up some stats on HearthArena or similar for this, and reading up about it. Drafting is trickier than you think.
---
- Once you hit rank 25, open all the packs you have now and see what you've got. 
---
- Make a deck that you think is viable, and start the push to get to level 15. 
---
- Once you hit level 15, you've made it and are officially in "the meta". At this point, you can't fall back below rank 20 anymore, and if you're still enjoying the game, then it might be time to consider buying packs with real money. Not before this point.
---
Maybe they they don't want to display 2+ tokens if a card can give multiple different things, and they feel that just showing tokens for just the cards that only give you one thing would be possibly confusing? I dunno, I think showing 2+ cards would be a bit of a mess, but they already have the technology to show one. I can't think of another reason for them to not do it.
---
people who post this should drown on titanic
---
My brain is upset that it know how pronounce all of them except SN2P
---
If he's a new player, then he shouldn't be expecting to play competitively or in tournaments until he at least plays a couple hundred hours of the game. Unless you want him to lose a lot, which isn't a good beginner experience either.
---
Bruh, r/AbsoluteUnits this chonky boi!!!

## bruh üò°üò§üòÇüíØüíØ
---
What are these 10% of mage decks that aren't running Arcane Intellect?
---
Stop it. This makes too much sense. 
---
Real talk though, Sn1p-sn4p is the problem. Why should other cards die for Sn1p-Sn4ps sins? I'm sure there are really good reasons why they would want to do anything instead of your suggestion, but your idea simply makes the most true sense.
---
True. And at 4 wins or above, the reward is always better than break even for the 150 gold cost.
---
Grats dude. Blizzard still think there‚Äôs millions of players because of u
---
two and a half hours left
---
No. Just do some daily quests and get some gold and such. Or buy an expansion. Or an adventure. Or whatever, point being that you play at your own pace, so restarting wouldn't make any sense. It's not like you will be able to take your old card set with you.
---
I can't believe they've kept this as it is so long, there's a 5 mana, 3 card combo where if you have a mech on board, you win. Failing at that, they can play 60+ snipsnaps filling the board with 20/30 mechs who deathrattle fill the board. Just make echo'd cards cost at minimum one or change mechwarper.
---
Well, now that they moved Mind Blast to Wild there's only one "classic deck", yeah. But that's not really a problem. Warlock really only has zoo in classic. Hunter only has aggro, and entirely relies on expansion sets for viability. Shaman arguably has nothing much at all - tokens maybe? It's just a toolbox for different archetypes from expansion sets.
---
But you're right - Priest and Paladin in particular have classic sets that are mostly a very strong toolbox, which makes them very difficult to tune so they're strong without being oppressive. Paladin is a bit easier though, with the Equality nerf and the higher cost of most of their tools. Priest has low cost cards and a handy draw engine.
---
I maintain though that Psychopomp giving Reborn as well as resurrection, especially combined with Amet, is the real difficulty. We all know Priest's usual game plan, so we just try to keep them off the board as much as possible. That's fine and dandy until Amet and Psychopomp make it impossible. Amet's ability is INSANE for only 4 mana.
---
I enjoy token quest.  You basically ignore your quest, and play a worse version of token druid for most of the game then at some point your quest goes off, and you get to explode back onto the board.   Highlander token is quite a bit of fun too.  But yes normal token druid is still a beast of a deck.
---
My free quest this expansion was Druid and free legendary was zephrys so I tried out highlander quest for a minute but gave up on it. I might have to try out some quest token.
---
No, it's 15 packs and 1 classic golden pack. And yes I'm waiting on it to craft my missing pieces.
---
Ofc you pick the dude with the gun.
---
It's basically three issues coming together:
---
1: Abilities that reduce the cost of an Echo card (in this case, SN1P-SN4P) to zero means you essentially have an "infinite" combo.  This, by itself, wouldn't be a problem.  It's just a gnarly combo.
---
2: Animations.  If your opponent plays a hundred SN1P-SN4Ps in their turn, your client will be showing these animations for so long that it will actually **SKIP YOUR TURN**, which is super unfair in a turn-based game.
---
3: Some people are hacking/modifying their game clients to skip the animations, allowing them to play more SN1P-SN4Ps on their turn, exacerbating the problem and guaranteeing that their opponent's turn is skipped.  **This, to me, is the 900 pound gorilla in the room.  Some people have been banned for this obviously malicious CHEATING**, but parts of the Hearthstone community are acting like #1 and #2 are the real problems and that **the obviously malicious CHEATERS** should not have been banned.
---
Some others:
---
Ping: Usually referring to the mage or hunter hero powers, it can also be used to refer to dealing 1-2 damage without attacking (eg. Moonfire, Kobold lackey)
---
Lethal: When you have enough damage on board or from cards in hand to kill the opponent. 
---
Burn: Dealing direct damage to an opponent mainly using spells, also refers to decks in which the primary game plan is to kill the opponent this way
---
Mill: Destroying the opponent's cards by overdrawing them, usually using coldlight oracle or naturalise (both of which are wild cards, so you need not worry about them in standard.) Also refers to decks that win by destroying the opponent's deck by milling them.
---
Burst: Dealing huge amounts of damage in a single turn, usually from cards in hand like chargers, burn spells, or board buffs
---
Bounce: Returning a friendly minion to your hand. Usually asociated with the rogue class
---
Control: A deck archetype primarily focused on clearing the opponent's minions and healing/gaining armour, and winning by outlasting the opponent.
---
Highlander: A deck type that only runs 1 copy of every card in their deck in order to enable the effects of mainly Reno Jackson, Zephrys, and Kazakhus.
---
This is amazing and sad at the same time. A third party have to create an achievement system where as Blizzard could have done that. Even Gwent upon release have an in-built achievement system. Very disappointing on Blizzard. Regardless, I will give this app a try! Looks amazing! Good work.
---
Bought o selling
---
so what? tons of cards are dangerous, the dangerous stuff is why people(many ) play wild to do crazy stuff. and its for old decks/cards cant be if you nerf/change. and mechwarper hasnt been issue at all before snipsnap(0mana +echo).
---
IF mechwarper becomes insaly problematic ner fit then, not now(where sssue clearly is snipsnap) if you nerf cause might be issue eventualy you might aswell nerf evry card
---
Just because they didn‚Äôt have the foresight to realize that viable mana cheat is terrible doesn‚Äôt mean they should stop buffing cards. They buffed pogo hopper and thunderhead, and those cards are far from oppressive. Buffing is actually good for the game, it allows the meta to be more diverse, and the buffs don‚Äôt have to be permanent.
---
If only we had mods that actually enforced Rule 6....
---
Like hunter? Shaman? Warrior? Druid? Mage?
---
Honestly? The only deck that greatly concerns me, as a Wild player, is big priest, because it's like a 90%+ win against control, and maaaaybe some decks like odd paladin and pirate warrior for the potential they have to limit design space. Everything else feels like it's on a relatively similarly balanced absurd power scale - and big priest doesn't feel OP, as much as it feels... I guess unfair is the way to describe it. You're punished for killing things, specifically for removing the biggest threats, and that sucks.
---
Yes. It is nice to be included.
---
NO TOMB CAN HOLD ME

5/3/4 | Battlecry: Summon a 1/1 copy of a random minion in your deck.  
---
I've taken a token druid deck to rank 4 this season so far. It's nice for me, since I still lack so many class epics and legendaries.
---
Yes but I‚Äôm trying to show you that hearthstone is not pay to win and the dust system is perfectly fine as it is. The only thing I could imagine changing is getting your dust back after a card is nerfed or making it so 3 legendaries being dust gives u enough dust for 1 (either decrease dust needed so golds also give less dust or increase dust given. Possibly both together 500 per leg and 1500 to craft)
---
Imagine if blizzard put this money into R and D for the game and not for this stipid shit they always make
---
You are crazy.
---
Summoning portal isn‚Äôt the problem. You could use Faceless Manipulator instead.
---
bloated numbers bc free packs
---
I mean I'm sorta doing that too but I still have things I can play and have fun with, and I really haven't crafted much this expansion.
---
Warren#11562 NA 80g quest  
---
going first provided you show
---
It's usually just a worse fireball.
---
like nerfing classic/basic cause new expac cant be issue(ramp over ui/paths/Plague/spellstone) or avianna(not classic but older) over psymelon even though psymelon is what made the deck insanly fast adn concistent which caused it to be issue.
---
The issue isn't SN1P-SN4P. Leave Standard out of it. Mana reductions always turn out to be problematic at some point.
---
Not OP, but after the first time I hit Legend I've only gotten back to Legend a couple of times. There has to be a deck I really, really enjoy and a meta that I don't find super frustrating, or else I'll just never play enough games to get there. The golden epic for hitting rank 5 is good enough for me.
---
Yeah, I was a little too vague there. I was thinking of the Sn1p-Sn4p issue that's been highlighted so much over the last few days.
---
Asshole Intelligence.
---
Nope still a thing but u can pre order tombs of terror for 20 bucks and get a free leggo from uldum!
---
Arcaneologist can be a 2/3 that finds a secret because a secret card in it of itself does not have the same value as a card.
---
Kirin-tor Mage and Kabal Lackey come with secret discounting effects and on-rate bodies because each mage secret (minus Ice Block) can whiff HARD. Mirror Image can copy a 1/1, Counterspell can counter the Coin, and so on.
---
Medivh's Valet can be a conditional Darkbomb and a 2/3 because Mage secrets tend not to stick around for that long (again, minus Ice Block).
---
Secrets by themselves are almost never worth their mana costs or a slot in your deck without a reasonable amount of secret pay off cards because the floors on secrets are so low.
---
Charge?
---
On play win rate means fucking nothing unless you think Brawl is one of the worst cards in the game?
---
I love treant druid, it's a lot of fun
---
Nah, the guy they banned who wasn't guilty (it's possible he lied but I assume it's true) had a bug to make his turn longer so they thought he was cheating. I don't think they ban anyone unless they play an impossible number of SN1P-SN4Ps in the turn timer. So all they really have to do is fix that bug and then get to banning.
---
I bought about 50 packs from gold and made some nice and good decks. 
---
But there are still card i want, and I first want to 15 packs before I go into crafting. 
---
Prefer to save my dust ;)
---
Firstly because the secrets are all worth about 2-2.5 mana. Secondly those cards were all never in standard together. Blizzard can release 1-2 decent secret synergy minions and a new secret once every 2 years and it will make a secret mage viable as at the very least a tier 3 deck in standard.
---
What Shaman deck isn't running Sludge Slurper?
---
Because the deck would rather play a minion on turn one instead of nothing and being a card short in their opening hand.
---
Because wild is IMMENSELY more fun, even if you lose more. Who cares about winning? It's about playing a beautiful game.
---
Incorrect. Every problem card in wild comes down to mana cheat. It‚Äôs why people hate big priests and, to a lesser extent, cubelock. Naga sea witch was nerfed and you never see any sort of iteration of that deck now. Balancing wild is pretty easy, since the other stuff you can do in wild is certainly overpowered, but it‚Äôs not game breaking, you don‚Äôt just win because your opponent killed a vargoth and you have five cheap resurrect spells on hand.
---
No you shut the fuck up
---
There it is, the most retarded thing I will read today. It is better than fireball in every single way.
---
i‚Äôll ask Tim Apple for it
---
bcs the deck is working for rank 15 wild? he is winning this game against you...
---
This is easily one of my favorite cardbacks I have, and I love using it.
---
And you know what? I would love other people to use it too. It genuinely doesn't matter and shouldn't matter how many other people have it. If I like something, it doesn't matter if other people like it or have it too. So as unlikely as it is to happen, I'd love if this cardback was obtainable somehow, just to make more people happy, and to help the game get that little much spookier.
---
Gifted by Blizzard, can be re-gifted if someone wants some ;)
---
They went back on that.
---
As someone who has this card back (its actually the one I have set as default), yeah. Absolutely. Bring it back. I think its really silly that they havent given a way to get older cardbacks and think the exclusivity is stupid.
---
I wanna see people using cardbacks because it fits their deck or because it expresses who they are as a player, not "hurr durr Im special cause I played 5 games in the month of june in 2016"
---
maybe he added people to curse at them, first it was a warning, he ketp doing it and then bam, banned
---
idk but i do know he isnt a saint
---
&gt; There's no hard deck requirement
---
hmm.
---
The winrate on Backstab hurts my soul. Rogue really took a nosedive this expansion.
---
I have yet to encounter secret mages myself, actually.
---
Yes the hearthstone animation is fantastic and really brings the game to life but the point is it should not be a game mechanic.
---
Psychopomp is equally mandatory, and edges out cleric juuust slightly because she isn't run in most resurrection-based decks
---
Well, I don't truly know the real, full story yet, and there isn't any way for me to know, so I can't judge either of you.
---
Maybe I'll help by bringing u/Eddetector here and you two can talk it out.
---
Show us on this doll where the guy touched you so it makes more sense to all of us? Cause he must have done something to you. Otherwise you'd look completely insane and retarded right now.
---
then it means it's time to move on.
---
The first one. I don't remember any warrior deck that relied on apm.
---
They should just change the echo mechanic so that it can't cost 0.
---
Warriors early turns, if they draw well, are usually much better than every other class out there save for maybe priest. Turn 2 and 3 are their weakest and so are turns 6-8/9. Turn 4 Mimmy, turn 5, Dynomatic.
---
The tools warrior has right now are very powerful, that‚Äôs all. It‚Äôs an extremely efficient control deck allowing them to save their removal for later which is what makes it a strong class.
---
Your odd
---
You got the legendary as soon as you ordered. You get the packs for clearing wings.
---
I still use the Rainbow card back. Seeing these old card backs always gives me a twinge of nostalgia for the classic/basic set days.
---
I think you get them for beating the chapters
---
"i stopped reading at destroy a minion"
---
for him, since he cant play anymore XDDD
---
The only cardback I want is the Old Gods one with the animated eye.
---
Why bother commenting
---
I got the legendary the second I pre-ordered (Collossus of the Moon üòê). Figured the packs were when the PvE opened up.
---
Nope, I‚Äôve been bamboozled.
---
Rich whales playing Hearthstone? I've never heard of such a thing! üòÇ
---
to me? no
---
but he did something shady within the game to get him banned, now he wants to cry and plead the fifth, yeah that aint happening buddy
---
I dont wanna talk to a cheater
---
How is that not intuitive? Auras on board have always applied before other modifiers, and always in the order in which they are played. 
---
Just like if you have a 8 cards in hand and 3 minions on board, the first 2 played will be returned with Vanish while the 3rd is killed. Or deathrattle triggers based off of which was played first. It's always how the game has worked.
---
your even
---
Turn time is there to 1) prevent abusive behavior (just stalling the game indefinitely) and 2) to test a players ability to _think_ under time constraints. Not to test how fast they can click buttons, or to balance a combo by having slow animations. Or at least it shouldn't be.  
---
In physical card games, its enough to demonstrate a combo is infinite. The idea that it should be any different in hearthstone is asinine to me. 
---
Finally, I could claim a person's memory is also a limiting factor in hearthstone (and its actually a much more meaningful limiting factor in a strategy game than how fast they can click), and yet... people use _third party programs_ to augment their memory. (Deck trackers). 
---
Blizzard should just either remove infinite combos or support them properly.
---
Once a Priest always a Priest 
---
Don't be ashamed of who you are
---
They reverted that announcement. Still shady af, trying to sneak shit like that into the game and only reverting if the community cries out loud enough.

Hey Gabialia, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
Let the Blizzard decide and revisit the case. Making assumptions is all fun and games but even behind bans there are people that made them and people tend to make mistakes. Or he truly is lying and he decided after spending 2k dollars to cheat and then cry on Reddit while showing his games trough HS.Replays(do you know how ridiculous that sounds?). Peace out. Let the justice prevail either it be ban or unbanning.
---
Any deck is a wild deck
---
&gt;It only tutors the the most impactful card if for some reason your decks most impactful card has rush.
---
So your most impactful card. Rush is just good. Warrior has the best rush minions and there is no reason to put a shitty rush minion in your deck.
---
I know, I know. I played during that time. I was just saying that there're still ways to make stupid broken shit like that even earlier but somehow that's ok.
---
MTG:A is pretty decent, imo. You build decks about as fast F2P, except you don't have to dust everything to get there. Hearthstone *maybe* catches up on all the give-aways and events they do, but MTG:A does give out very desirable cards for free from time to time (not nearly as much, though).
---
Because if something is on the board saying "Your cards cost 5" the intutive thing to expect is for your cards to cost 5. Previously discounted ones going up to 5, more expensive ones coming down to 5. Any other discounts being applied shouldn't be changing the in-play rule of "Your cards cost five." 
---
You clearly disagree, so I don't see what more there is to discuss here.
---
And unless other posters are lying, it is *not* always how the game has worked. I'm told Naga Sea Witch originally overrode all other modifiers.
---
Lol'd at unleash xD

The truesilver is actually okay-ish I guess.

I think he meant "I use pity timer **tracker**". His tracker app told him his last legendary was 32 packages after the previous legendary he found.

Defeat the boss by killing murlocs... ooo, so fun...

* People aren't mad that snip-snap is powerful, they're mad that success in some matchups depend on animation speed (among other things)
---
* You don't have to play a deck that is "survive until win condition", just look at aggro paladin
---
* It is possible for card games to have eternal formats that are fun to play. Yes there will be powerful combos. But if they're too oppressive, they should get banned or nerfed (e.g. Naga sea witch)
---
* A format doesn't have to be perfectly balanced to be interesting to play. According to the meta snapshot, between T1 and T2 decks there are viable options in 7/9 classes.
---
Just because people are complaining, doesn't mean the format is awful and should be written off forever.
---
You and everyone else (including me) it seems buddy
---
how
---
Then he goes super sayan at the end.  I dont even want to know how hard this will be on Heroic
---
Mage secrets aren't worth 3 mana so the support cards have to be overpowered to make it work.
---
Yes, it's very stupid. It's been a known fundamental design flaw in the game since before it was released.
---
You can tell it works because they still follow this model.
---
No No No it's because he's a Minion, are you blind?

&gt; The more intuitive your game is, the better. Ideally, you shouldn't have to play the game to figure out how certain interactions work, or what certain cards do, the game's rules should be exhaustive.
---
Exhaustive *and* consistent. Hearthstone's are neither.
---
Mine was 18 üòí
---
The weapon one is very good. 
---
The spell one is too inconsistent imo
---
Ah okay, so you're not blind, just dumb.
---
What‚Äôs the origin of this meme?
---
same thing if you beat all the Ch 1 bosses. finish your run, is the thing
---
Releasing 6 weeks after an expansion is also just a hype disaster.  I'm sure they'll use this in a year or two to justify killing adventures/solo content again entirely since it makes them the least money (*Due to decreased interest in Solo Content, we are...*).
---
they never do that for these Adventure sets. spreading out the release across multiple weeks means multiple chances to build hype
---
if you want to wait 2 weeks and open all the wings the same day, you could do that
---
Mass dispel from Zephrys fuckin killed my meme Lucentbark decks :(

I was able to get head starts with the treasure that skips two turns and used the Hearthstone when he was at 11 Health.

Disagree this is substantially better than rumble run or dalaran. The signature treasures and cross-class builds are actually pretty cool. 
---
Dust system still sucks tho
---
Yeah i was getting similar results, just a single usually 1-cost murloc every time, even on the final boss

---
If you have the tavern upgrade it takes you to the upgraded one. It's amazing for the last boss.
---
&gt; I feel like the amount is tied to how long the match has been going.
---
yeah that makes sense.  early pulls were always 1 murloc; later-on pulls were always 2, but didn't seem to go back to 1

dunno but his faces matches the circled info

Good idea. Also, it would be great if they finally fixed the New filter.

---

---
What‚Äôs a normie?
---
&gt;your "equation" does not take into account changes in player or customer behavior
---
Yes it does. Change in customer behavior will be reflected in the total revenue.
---
Still pretty fun even if it is the n'th iteration of Dungeon Run. Was able to beat the first Plaguelord on my first try without dying, but it was looking a little dicey near the end.
---
Yeah the classic set is still the strongest set of the game  despite the nerfs.
---
Definitely sucks for now but I‚Äôll imagine they‚Äôre going to directly address and improve that quests viability in the next expansion
---
Also one that reduces the cost of your first 10 cards by 1. ( those are the ones already in your deck when you start a run)
---
But then revenue is a lagging indicator is it not?
---
Well done! It seems that the  first Plague isn't that difficult - I beat him on first try, too. I hope the Plagues from the next chapters will live up to hyped expectations.
---
Upvote farming is always live on Reddit...
---
Even then the way it's currently designed you need plenty of high cost but high value lategame cards aka. Legendaries.
---
You still seem to be confused. I'm not saying this is how the game is. I'm saying it's what's more intutive. You keep telling me how the game is. That's not relevant.
---
&gt;Yeah, but we've all seen those Trolden vids where some player's trying to pull off something complicated that'd absolutely work, but the turn fails because some animation ate up the rope.
---
Sure, but this sort of thing is an issue in almost every card game. Yugioh occasionally has similar issues, where a combo will absolutely ‚Äúwork‚Äù but it takes 15+ minutes to properly carry out all the effects.
---
The main difference between Hearthstone and other games in that regard is that Hearthstone has the ability to bake the limits on these things into the game itself and let that ride. The game itself plays as the judge and usually doesn‚Äôt need intervention unless something is unusually challenging for the system to handle (like shudderwock). Whereas physical card games either need to do this sort of thing via a compendium tourney ruling or by just banning the card for causing too many time headaches.
---
Did Chapter 2 first, got the Plague Lord down to 3 health, I'm so pissed right now.
---
The way auras worked changed in KFT. It's why Naga Sea Witch went from unplayed to broken as fuck.
---
Haha, not so much, the post blew up with the league of EVIL, but not this time! Shipping outside France should be 2‚Ç¨ for up to three (20g), 3‚Ç¨ for the set of 5 and 4‚Ç¨ for 10 if I remember well :)
---
Was surprised my first run I completed it first try in under 45 minutes. Not trying to brag. Just expected to have to get to the boss multiple times.
---
It's perfectly intuitive. The most recent aura played overrides all.
---
The Golden pack is tied to the last wing.
---
The pre-order legendary is no longer available though
---
Craft whiz bang. It‚Äôs a great tool for new and F2P players. It is a legendary card and when inserted to a deck it gives you 1 of 16 premade decks at random when you go into a match. You‚Äôll get to experience many deck archetypes for a very cheap price tag. After you get a feel for the classes and some archetypes you should have a better idea on what your personal preference is to craft
---
I loved him.
---
Not sure what you're implying here, but [here's](https://imgur.com/vOAHiep) my odds to get a new card after opening ~80 packs and crafting warrior/shaman decks.
---
Titanic Ring is by far the best thing to have for a wave of murlocs!  
---
Did that also, i burned about 30 cards this game... but i had elixir of vigor which gave me an infinite amount of pyros, was an easy fight as well, but the three stages were surprising!
---
It's not rage. We're laughing, with a stroke of pity. Imagine being afraid of holes. It's hilarious and sad.
---
Priest can succ my ass
---
Okay-ish????
---
No! We need to make sure no one ever plays classic cards!
---
Now it's 4 mana 2/2 whenever your hero is healed, you can attack.
---
Wrong plaguelord.
---
Well, your enemy‚Äôs gotta have at least six minions out for you to be able to do this, which is pretty rare. 
---
Otherwise, yeah, you‚Äôre spot on.
---
I just fought against the Azara (or something) boss, the one with a passive that summons a [[Dust Devil]] whenever the boss overloads itself. It completely stomped me, even with a passives-treasures combination that I think counters her. I didn't have even a single moment where I was in the advantage. And the only reason why I didn't lose on turn 6 is because of all my healing cards. Sigh.

Well for me it was 1 every time for my first run through, sorry for asking if anyone had a similar experience, how am i supposed to know it's inaccurate for other people sorry i forgot my magic 8 ball at home today
---
I picked treasures based on fun value and got the last boss to 85 on my first run. Even that was mainly because I blew my load on the first stage and didn't realise how the rest of the fight was going to go.
---
It was okay until I tried heroic and it resets your progress from normal so you have to do everything again. It's called forced gameplay time. Not for me.
---
And that's why the tradeoff/equation/question mentions specifically future revenue
---
pay2play, disgusting.
---
I think their surprise is it say of a creature of that type and they expected random creatures. I believe because it counts as multiple types though it is the only car that can match it's type.
---
Thanks!
---
Nice
---
How do individuals get these pre release things? 
---
Such as this bundle and the wow classic swag bundle.
---
One thing I've learned:  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
If you never, I mean never want to be offered a secret make sure you pick the play 6 secrets chick at the start.
---
That's awesome, thank you for providing insight on your experience unlike everyone else just telling me i was wrong. I was playing a pretty fast deck so i never got beyond 1 murloc each game.
---
This. I was one weapon swing away from winning and he plays a cold light, milling for 10-11 and then 12 damage (exact lethal). Was insanely annoyed as he had 3hp.
---
I have long thought that all cards that reduce mana cost should include the "Not Less Than 1" restriction. Whenever I mention this everyone who plays decks that rely on zero mana cards protests and defends their decks as being perfectly reasonable, why do I want to destroy their fun, etc. I agree some decks would become unplayable but feel this change would open design space for future cards without the need to constantly worry about potential unexpected interactions.
---
That's how AI generally works in strategy games that are more complex than chess. In any strategy game where the AI doesn't cheat, it's because you're playing on easy mode.
---
Good to know thanks fam
---
Ok?
---
Yeah, band of scarabs seems godly the first wing. I got 2 of them for the full Haro Setting Sun experience and so many times the bosses just couldn't do anything.
---
TLDR: unlike the big brains out there who infinitelocked the boss and exodia'd him, my dumbass decided to bash through all of his minions (i won 4 into fatigue, who knows how many murlocs I have slain. I can't count lmao)
---
That has me wondering.  How many times you could play Reno (for the full 10 damage, no damage trigger minions) in time it takes to kill a single Eternium Rover?
---
Why are they giving me the chance to throw more face damage at their face when I can often easily remove it and still maintain board presence.
---
Flame Imp is a card that I think would rarely make this list, because it's never run in control.
---
Even if control lists are 10% of Warlock, whenever there's a card that's good enough to run in both control and zoo, it should surpass the popularity of Flame Imp.
---
I am a little surprised that the winner is Evil Genius, though, since it seems like that card would be almost as bad as Flame Imp in control, in a world without \[\[Voidcaller\]\], or something you proactively want to kill...maybe some lists are running it to target \[\[Expired Merchant\]\]?
---
Probably, it's just that lackeys are that good...but it probably wouldn't take that many people meming it up to push any card that every zoo deck runs to the #1 Warlock class card.
---

I feel like that's been the issue of every single dungeon run type game mode since they started them - have all fights leading up to the boss be ridiculously easy, and then give the boss unfair mechanics that your deck just can't beat sometimes, either due to draw or how you've built it (in the cases where you know the boss, you can build around this, but for random bosses, this really sucks).
---
Beat me to it

Octo jones
---
They changed how auras worked then, which directly impacts the design of Summoning Portal. It's text has not been correct since the KFT aura changes. You're an idiot.
---
Man, Crook and Flail + Rocket Backpacks is really nuts. I just drafted as many cheap spells (including Gnomebliterator) and as many big/valuable minions as possible. It worked well with Stargazer Luna with the +2/+2 buff from the Tavern and Emperoar Thaurissan. If my first run hadn't taken the Plague Lord of Murlocs down to 43 (which very quickly became 11 because of Gnomebliterator, I wonder how it would've done fresh.
---
Everything has constraints. Limits of number of cards, mana, etc. why not time?
---
&gt;  Does this offer anything substantially different?
---
Not much. 
---
1 - your character is a merge of two different heroes (so "your class" is either of them and "another class" is any of the other 7).
---
2 - the final boss retains any lost HP when you face it again next time, so as long as you can get to the 8th one, you'll eventually grind your way through.
---
We used to see doomguard, skull, posessed lackey, voidlord and bloodreaver Gul‚Äôdan here. The fact we see evil genius tells me how bad warlock has become :(
---
Oh ok
---
Staff of Ammunae and Crook and Flail carried me hard in the first run. I kept getting Anub'araks as loot and let me tell you, having 4/5 of them on the board on turn 3 solved a lot of problems.
---
Why can't you people just experience it properly. You'll be the same people complaining about single player in two weeks.
---
On the contrary, that's why the guy is pissed: it simple appears at mulligan, taking a slot.
---

I had fun with it. The power level of the treasures are extremely OP, which was actually a nice change but still in the end it felt like just another Dungeon run

ü¶Äü¶Ä The League of E.V.I.L. is powerless against Crusty ü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Congratulations. I couldn't do it but managed to get him to 72 health from 300. When the fatigue set in, i was done quickly.  In my next run i will take him down for sure.
---
Beat him 1st try. Took the -1 attack to all enemy units twice. all units almost 0 dmg the whole run xD
---
&gt;Corridor Creeper
---
Seems more like a Violet wurm. A corridor creeper has indents in the side of its mouth and it does not reach such size.
---
Lol am I the only one who actually likes this solo adventure¬ø
---
Having fought now through both Plague Lords and beaten them first try, I can definitely admit that Plague Lord of Madness is much easier and straightforward. No more plowing through a neverending onslaught of murlocs. Eww...
---
Heck yeah, didn't thought of it at all
---
So you picked it? I think that is on you
---
Can you get the old passive treasure that makes your hero power cost 1 and enable you to cast it again? Reno's Arcane Craftiness is fucking INSANE. With that, I legit can't see a game lost
---
I really like lots of the new treasures and passives they added, but the plague lords are just a really bad concept.
---
If they wanted to go with the big boss keeping damage between games then they should have made the boss so difficult that it would kill you off in no time, forcing you to get in what damage you could. Instead we get bosses that rely on having so much health that you just sit there dealing damage and feeling bored.
---
I beat the murloc boss in one try thanks to the rush passive. He cleared my board with his power, I cleared his board with my passive. I chipped away at him while waiting for fatigue. This was the most tedious game of my life.
---
The problem is that the plague lord IS NOT a bonus boss. It's considered as the true last boss, so if you lose to him, it's like you LOST the run.
---
Imagine playing multiple times to complete.... good lord what a retarded design.
---
&gt;Why can't they make solo adventures like karazhan and league of explorers, instead of these, boring, repetitive, rng filled adventure runs? 
---
Because that style of adventures was not worth returning to after you had already beaten it once. Draft is much more interesting and dynamic.
---
Yes they need swatting otherwise they'll stay in that one area for eternity.
---
I honestly thought that would have the best winrate of the lot, it's brutal. You get a handle on the game and worthy opponent plays psychopomp and summons the absolute best possible game changer card previously played and its gg.
---
I just dont like how awful mage is in standard, its my favorite class and I wanna play it, so I switched
---
I actually just got Ahmet and plan to try this tonight. It seems like the only real obvious way to pull it off without getting real weird with it
---
Jeez, I didnt beat my plague lord on a similar fasion
---
You would be right if the boss couldn't be beat over the course of multiple runs.
---
I had a complete crap run because I was just screwing around, and I still got him down to about 130 health in just one run.
---
That 5/1 deal 5 to all enemy minions is also really strong vs that murloc flood once you've cleared your deck.
---
That's not exactly how it works. This is only the case if your loop includes some optional effect ("you may do X", using an activated ability and so on). There are infinite combos that don't have those: an example of this would be having a Bishop of Wings + Arcane Adaption (naming angel) versus opponent's Ethereal Absolution. Once any of your creatures dies, you're stuck in a loop of summoning 0/0 spirit angels. This combo is just going by itself without any player input, so you can't just stop at an arbitrary moment. Such combos are ruled to be ties.
---
Earthquake gg
---
I got doomhammer earlier. Insane value
---
put like that, yeah, it's 233 gold per pack. but remember, it's also 3 free packs for Ch. 1, and another 3 freebies for the Epic Finale.  So if you do em all that's 15 packs at 140 gold each -- still higher than normal, but hopefully you got some enjoyment from the solo content
---
Wax Rager resummons itself on death, so it is just outright infinite damage once he gets on the board.
