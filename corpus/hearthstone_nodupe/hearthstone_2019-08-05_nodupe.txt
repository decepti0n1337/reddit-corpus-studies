Singleton hunter actually looks really strong, but that's about it
---
It‚Äôs almost like priests classic set should be completely redesigned because of how horrible it is
---
Dragon priest, imo, was the only "fair" deck they've had.  All the others required literally no skill and you could just afk till turn 5 then win.
---
Bo3 and Bo1 are very different
---
Whether it's \* worth\* the price or whether it should \*have\* a price are two different thing. I argued for the latter, not the first.
---
For me it's 6pm (BST)
---
I really wish they would revamp Priest's basic set.  Give them better removal, get rid of DS/IF, give them the tools to support a Priest that can stick minions without it being a lethal condition, that actually heals its minions, and can maybe make non-massive-swing plays for once by resurrecting moderate minions and making use of deathrattle synergy as something other than a draw engine?  Maybe trade Velen for Vol'jin as a healthier evergreen legendary?

I would be excited if Paladin didn't get the worst set in history
---
No fucking way was Highlander Priest uninteractive and an Auto win. It was insanely powerful but still required a lot of thinking
---
**Underbelly Angler** isn't really that RNG depending and if you leave it up for a turn or two you will most likely lose no matter what cards were RNGed off of it. Of course it feels bad when they get another Angler but most of the time that doesn't happen and it really isn't what determines the game.
---

---
**Lackies** aren't really high variance RNG either as all of them are around equal in power level.
---
**Swamp Queen** is expensive and requires a lot of resources in general to utilize.
---
With **Hagatha** you don't lose because of bullshit RNG spells you lose because they keep producing a bunch of resources to throw at you.
---
**Conjurers** really isn't RNG at all except for the very very very small time that they get a taunt off a giant otherwise you know exactly what's coming.
---
**Astromancer** isn't even played anymore and when it was it had pretty low variance overall.
---
**Power of Creation** has low variance as the majority of 6 drops are of an equal power level.
---
**Magic Trick** is also low variance and low impact as it can only get you spells that cost 3 or less.
---
**Mana Cyclone** is once again a card that you don't lose to because bullshit RNG you lose to because they just generate more resources than you with the card.
---
**Burglar** and **Blink Fox** are high variance but **Toggwagle** and **Lackies** aren't. 
---
There have been far far far worse RNG cards and its actually gotten much better. Babbling Book, Primordial Glpyh, Piloted Shredder, Tuskarr, Firelands Portal, Dr. Seven, Unstable Portal, Flamewaker, Implosion, Yogg just to name a few. It's not just about the level of variance but how much that level of variance effects the outcome of the game and the majority of the cards you mentioned if not all of them have their variance have very little impact on the game unlike some of the early cards.
---
I personally couldn't care less if they HOF Inner Fire, but I know for certain that this sub will still complain about any Priest deck that's Tier 2 and above.
---
kinda feel like you saw a certain post here with many upvotes and decided to copy it lol
---
Thats exactly what I meant. They are/were barely tier 1 at one point, and that was long time ago. Things can change, of course, but the push must be really high and still playing duplicates normally is better, unless the highlander cards are specifically needed for a combo (elise only comes to mind). And highlander druid wont be as strong as other tier 1 decks in wild, so yeh... zephyrs is a bad craft for wild, better craft it when it actually proves to be usefull.

These payed adventures are really taking a toll on the amount of packs I can open at the start of each expansion.
---
NevynStorm, you should go add him/her as a friend
---
Can't wait for people to get back to his videos and realise how stupid were they for mocking about being right
---
You don't hate it as much also because the variance matters a lot less for winning. Getting a good roll in Blink Fox is way less impactful than Piloted Shredder or Tuskar Totemtic or Primordial Glyph.
---
I'm not confident about that one.  A lot of people have said that current secret hunter doesn't run many duplicates, but I kinda feel like they're exaggerating how many tools it'll have for pushing its earlygame and the payoff of Zephyrs/Brann finishers, but it's definitely the one that looks the most promisng rn, given Hunter's overall power.
---
I like your idea, but I guess that effort is a little too much work to be worth it. In the long run I guess HSreplay will offer a detailed analysis of cards offered in which board states. For the short term a bit of manual data collection will help a lot to see broad trends. I for one am sure after watching two days of "theorycrafting streams" that Zephyr got a far to high affinity to tech cards and removal attached to bodies (E.g. BGH and MCT). And especially hex/polymorph get's offered nearly never, even in cases were it could turn arround whole games.. Brawl and (Mass)Silence are offered sometimes but would be objectively best cards more often than Zephrys offers them.
---
And that's only from 2 days, so I guess we will crack the basics on day 1 and after 1 week we will have good guides with detailed data driven analysis following therafter.
---
I don't understand why they wouldn't introduce Elusive. And why on earth did they remove Enrage? Why?
---
unfortunately that doesn't work, you can't find/add anyone by their nicknames ):
---
Did you play any games after this one? If not you could have just added last played opponent
---
I agree it should be removed...but I really don't want 2 more "1 mana: Heal your face for 5 and toss this card in the garbage".
---
There has to be something more creative to fix priest being stupidly overpowered and stupidly underpowered every other expansion...
---
Confirmed: next expansion will take place in the 90s.
---
&gt;aggro demolishes it
---
Excuse me what. the literal only reason anyone plays renolock in wild is to crush aggro. aside from that you have a toolkit of good tech cards to at least pull off ~40% winrate vs combo. The main problem with reno decks, like all other control decks, is quest mage and big priest. You can easily hit legend with renolock if you play close to the end of the season since all the control killer decks are at legend and youll get matched up vs dumpster legend people messing around and get a few free stars.
---
Zephyrs will help reno decks a lot since its a 10 mana twisting nether at worst while also being weapon removal, healing and much more. Aside from zephyrs all the kabal classes got interesting tools like siamat, expired merchant, plague of sand, penance, holy ripple, flame ward, reno 2.0. And thats not even accounting for something like reno druid or reno paladin popping up. 
---
The only way reno decks are all tier 7 trash next expansion is if quest mage goes untreated for 4 months and takes up &gt;30% the meta.

Saves card space and looks better.

That's exactly what I'm looking for, good t2 (1 mana drops) for this deck besides worthy expedition. But you got the right idea here, this seems to be the hardest slots to fill. I'm thiming on running something like 1x innervate and a good pack of 2 drops, since we have a lot of good ones in questing explorer, the "draw-one-if-floating-mana" lady and doomsayer, and, of course, at least 1x worthy expedition. I'm really excited for this deck haha hope I get this quest
---
Wow
---
That's not even sort of comparable. Just because two things have roughly the same structure, doesn't make them equivalent. You can make something that resembles mayonnaise using dish soap and motor oil, but it won't be edible. Pointing that out would not mean the person doesn't like actual mayonnaise, though...
---
The no-duplicate rule for legendary cards is arguably the single most beneficial feature ever added to card pack mechanics, probably even more important than pity timers. It benefits *any player opening packs*, because anyone opening packs wants *cards* and legendaries are the most expensive and hardest to collect, and you can only use one of each, so duplicates are always functionally useless.
---
Not everyone wants *golden cards*, and even if they do, these have very very low odds of dropping to begin with, regardless of rarity, and no established pity timer. The impact of your proposal would be so incredibly tiny, it's not worth implementing. My main issue with your post is that you seemed to suggest that this would be some kind of middle-ground between the current situation and implementing a proper no-duplicate rule for epics (beyond the first two copies). It would not.
---
On top of that, yes, whenever I get a golden card, I'd much rather have it be a duplicate than a new one, especially for epics. That's because disenchanting a golden card is only a net benefit for my collection if it's a duplicate. So even the tiny, very situational "benefit to the playerbase" that you see would actually legit be a detriment for me. And I'm definitely not the only one; all players who manage their dust tightly and don't seek golden cards are in the same boat.
---
To summarize, the no-dupe rule for legendaries is exquisite mayonnaise. A similar rule for epics would be equally delicious. Your suggestion on the other hand is a dish soap and motor oil emulsion trying to pass for light mayonnaise. Sorry. \^\^

I had the same idea the second I saw how it worked and wanted to make a video, but unfortunately all the required notes are not present on the board. Sadface.

There is absolutely no way that MB was HoF'd because of this. Mind Blast wouldn't suddenly make the card imbalanced. It's already overpowered, but that's the whole point of this card.

I like inner fire as a way to turn a big health minion into a bif threat but not the way they win.

Ok pack i guess
---
Back in the early days of the Pokemon TCG, cards would list themselves by name specifically such as "Discard two energy cards attached to Charizard" "Put Oddish on your Bench", etc. However
---
even in Wizard of the Coast's official rule compendium at the time they said; "whenever another Pokemon uses these types of attacks, like through Clefairy's metronome or Alakazam's Psylink, you're supposed to read those attacks as "this Pokemon". It's just shorthand that you're supposed to assume, and in fact in the modern sets they even say "this Pokemon" now to probably to avoid such confusion.
---
Damn, nice, I got the golden mage quest
---
I don‚Äôt know honestly? But I can say we can‚Äôt craft or disenchant them. üôÑ
---
It‚Äôs also super annoying we don‚Äôt get the random golden legendaries yet....
---
PEOPLE, if you want any legendaries golden, CRAFT THEM BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR PACKS!!!
---
I agree. I think Divine spirit is the bigger problem but the general win condition of buff big minion, go face, win play style needs to go.
---
Sometimes people see me say that and are like"oh he just wants priest to suck". I have over 1700 wins as priest. I play it all the time. I just want it to move on.

Please do not risk it if you ever encounter this forbidden deck in the future 
---
Or did you already get banished? In that case 
---
F
---
yeah, should make it a bit weaker
---
I also don‚Äôt mind paying for the game. I‚Äôve said in other threads that I‚Äôd be happy to pay a hefty monthly subscription fee. I have in the past purchased both preorder bundles.
---
I‚Äôm not asking Blizz for a cheaper game. I‚Äôve just seen posts where people are spending the same as me and they pull 7 or more of the same useless epic card. That‚Äôs the problem‚Äî not the cost, just the fact that game has the potential for players to low-roll that intensely.
---
It will have virtually no effect on the structure of the game, or the amount of ‚Äúfree stuff‚Äù players get, but it ensures that players don‚Äôt get so unlucky that they feel cheated.

Take my downvote, is the minion I can do for you after you having wasted at least 5 minutes of your life and mine.
---
&gt; like way back they used to complain about priest winning with "their" cards etc.
---
Drakonid operative was nuts though. Good stats, look at 3 cards in opponents deck (get information), pick the best one.
---
I don't disagree. Obviously a refined deck is gonna roll anything new and untested. Given time, I'm sure many of those decks will give it a run for it's money, but a hard counter to push it and control warrior off the top of the tier list? I personally don't see it.
---
Control Warrior has been dominating the meta since before the April rotation and the release of Ride of Shadows. it was just called Odd Warrior then and the only difference between those decks are Baku and Reckless Flurry are gone, and Omega Devastator and Elysiana were put in.
---
It's been almost 2 fucking years with that deck already. it a rotation and an expansion couldn't stop it, no reason to think another expansion will either.
---
f2p btw
---
Yeah. Blizzard and Team 5 want people to spend money on the game so the game can continue to exist.
---
It's a strategy as old as the concept of a trading card game.
---
Not with that attitude!

Well, actually. The first thing to come to mind when looking at Poisonous is that it applies a damage over time.   
---
Poison and Burn are usually depicted as DoTs in basically all video games, including WoW.   
---
It meaning "instant kill" is not really obvious.   
---
  
---
Yes Soggoth is much larger in the card art than he is in WoW, and actually he appeared equally as large in WoW while he was still ..a skeleton.   
---
Apparently they've revived Soggoth now and retconned his size to be more reasonable for players to fight.  
---
Even so. I'm not saying him being elusive in the sense of a sasquatch somehow equates to him being elusive in the sense of dodging spells. Just that Soggoth can be.. elusive. It's not really relevant to the topic.
---
Better idea: you construct and all murloc mage deck
---
Run 2 dead cards just for this situation.
---
Yeah I‚Äôll take auctal cards instead
---
Amazon coins?
---
I know you're meming, but your logical is somewhat sensible. 
---
All that said:
---
* Specialist is RIP.
---
* Battlecry Shaman is probably going to run that new 2 mana 2/2 battlecry: deal 1 to all enemy minions for the mirror and for Zoo lock. It'd also be a good clear after playing Plague of Murlocs.
---

---
I've been playing this deck since Dead Man's Hand came out and this is probably my favorite deck in the whole game. I was on and off with hearthstone until i saw how fun this card was. Frankly speaking, I wouldn't be playing if it weren't for DMH
---
Especially Sludge Slurper seems like a key piece of the deck.  Drawing that on command isn't bad.
---
The entire solo adventure is a scam, you paid 2800 gold to buy 13 packs worth 1300 gold.
---
That's like saying a game of chess will play out the same every time.
---
That's well done, wouldn't have thought of that in the time limit myself.
---
Still won't make it a good craft but since we see Reno showing up in non-singleton Control decks for fatigue, is it possible to see Zephyrs show up in Standard Control decks?
---
Still upsets me to this day
---
I have a theory if they contain s purple color it‚Äôs not gonna be added
---
I only get priest deck lol
---
Mage doesn't Discover spells, the hero power gives you a random one. It's significantly worse than Discover even with the mana reduction. Hagatha is more value than the Mage Quest but still got outclassed by Dr. Boom.
---
No
---
[removed]
---
stats are original, cant stack reborns, triggers deathrattle if it has it, counts as summon
---
Probably wont be in a tier 1 deck unless Singleton decks get more support next expansion or cards are nerfed. Zephyrs in itself isn't overrated, people are probably overestimating the use of singleton decks high up the ladder.

Paladin is going to an unknown direction and it's very difficult to predict which archetype would work tomorrow...
---
I think OTK, Big Paladin and Mech Paladin are way more consistent than Dragon, Murloc and Quest Paladin.
---
can't remember the cards name but it belongs to the priests and keeps all stat changes and is shuffled into the deck when it dies.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Does the first one to die shuffle while it summons a fresh copy without the bonuses when it dies ? or does the reborn keep the same bonuses as the one shuffled ?
---
So if I bite a poisonous animal, but don't outright kill it, I'm not poisoned?
---
ive used vpn and hearthstone for years, no problems.
---
just dont use vpn to falsify region for purchases then you will face trouble.
---
The mystery would be really tough to unravel with only one secret in a class
---
Here's my thought: Why is poison/venom associated with instantly killing something?
---
dumb is a bit harsh, but I do wonder how does one card help for Jaina? It is just another survival tool.
---
yes, they showed that is how it works with the shaman quest. You just have to remember to pick 4 different one.s
---
Well the issue currently is that there are no secrets in standard so you can't just print one secret like mage and hunter got, you have to print a few, otherwise they aren't very secret anymore, and really you would want like 5, maybe across 2 expansions, to get true secretness.
---
Then as another user pointed out they also need support, especially in Rogue which is a very tempo class and secrets aren't high tempo. So basically you would need to dedicate a full expansion, maybe 2 to getting a secret deck off the ground for rogue and then, because of the standard cycling you would either have to do this every year or two (1 expansion just for secrets) or print 1 secret and 1 support card every expansion to keep secrets going which gets boring.
---
I'm guessing blizzard tried secrets, they didn't work and they don't want to force rogue into that archetype by printing that much support. If rogue had secrets in the basic and classic sets it would work much better.
---
I absolutely think there should be a testing area where you can pilot a deck for a couple games before committing the dust
---
god damnit
---
thank you :)
---
i am rather new to hearthstone so a lot of these things make me wonder what would truly occur :)
---
I cannot comprehend why that isn't an option already
---
I thought it was to capitalize on the unoriginal fools which only follow the masses and maybe wake up the sheeple in the process. That is, until the meta stabilizes and it becomes rock/paper/scissors.
---
Obviously fake but that ui would be way too small for the switches screen
---
This is why hearthstone is awesome.
---
PROFIT. Honestly why give away anything if people will pay?
---
a friend did that too
---
He's not taking a stance at all, he explains the thinking of OP's post.
---
Singleton decks are not good in Wild right now.  They can't build in a way to beat decks like Big Priest and Aggro simultaneously.   And then there are plenty of weird combo decks that will cheese a win if they can't find, or properly utilize, Dirty Rat.
---
Even Reno Mage, who gained the most this set, I would be surprised if it surpassed Tier 3.
---
dragon package is not worth crafting for you because the only viable dragon deck right now is dragon mage and its very expensive I reccomend you wait until the expansion and see what quest you get
---
Than we could easily try to understand complicated interactions! That will never happen. We will also never get a rulebook. Some things are just stuff that Blizzard will never do no matter how reasonable. 
---
I'm curious if we will see new deckslots in the next two years.
---
I like Kripp but I don't think he puts too much thought into his star reviews. He just goes off his initial impression and moves on.

I think there is a difference between wording that is outright incorrect and stuff were it's clearly just meant to be flavorful or ro make it less wordy. Will you come up next telling us that Zephrys is never fullfilling your wishes?
---
Netdecking happened long before the internet. People used to use MTG decks that won in tournaments as printed in magazines.
---
And don't even get me started on farming. People were netdecking optimal crop rotations for thousands of years.
---
The safest craft is [Siamat]. None of the cards comes even close imo.
---
yeah big time I was sure sure it would be too
---
I would assume you both lagged out (server issue?), but he lagged out first.
---
Honestly, it's not that hard to get into Wild. You only need a handful of cards from each expansion to make good decks. 
---
And with adventure cards being craftable now, it's even easier.
---
**You serve well**

Did you do a doozie on this one?
---
Well played!
---
Still looking for someone EU, I'm online now
---
I'd prefer saving plague of fire to keep the board clear and stall the game.
---
question.  once Lineage OS was setup and running on the Switch, how many further mods did you have to make for the game to work or was it good to go?
---
also, did this destroy your switch for Nintendo OS and games..?
---
/wooooosh
---
The solo adventures used to be free, I just can't get the bad taste out of my mouth of paying for something now that used to be free.  Whenever blizzard increases the cost of the game it makes me want to actively avoid giving them money.
---
A divine shield, invulnerable, reborn minion must be quite the eyesore.
---
What does it even mean for a card to have a particular power in a vacuum? There's just playable and unplayable in a meta.
---
Like, I'm making another game, in this game I have a 12 mana 30/30. Is that card powerful?
---
You're always comparing, predicting a meta. In a vacuum you can't judge cards.
---
&gt;2 - \[\[Corrupt the Waters\]\]

---
I understand how you feel but I just do something else, like play rocket league.
---
Some (F2P) players watch these recommendations to see which cards to buy with their dust.
---
Undervaluing is better, as you tend to have less 'bad/useless\' cards, and can still buy the 'unexpected' good ones afterwards
---
What happened to paladin secrets? They keeping getting support but no good ones put back in standard.
---
I would like to not feel obligated to play the game, thanks.
---
Thank you!
---
I'm so glad that we're getting a yogg card now and its actually playable.
---
Such wow, much repost
---
Just wait the next expansion, pretty sure there will be lots of dragons
---
Good point! It may not, meaning it's only 18
---
It seems like literally no one uses the search bar here. I guess the hunt for karma points is all that matters.
---
I should be offended by the name. :(
---
I think the quest might surprise you. I was rather down on it initially, but I'm starting to suspect it might actually be pretty solid.
---
Because people don't know shit about wild. They think DK Jaina and Rexxar must be strong because they dominated standard for a while.
---
Internet explorer, is that you?
---
Shudderwock auto-picks all choices at random, same as discovery effects
---
Great art as usual Matt!
---
Someone spent a lot of time on that. I'm glad they did, but .... really?
---
Leeroy hands down. It's a classic card so it doesn't rotate out. (If he go in hall of fame you get 1600 dust back)
---
Can you elaborate? Sitmat seems like a better firelands portal and that card was played a lot
---
I'll still be playing Mech Paladin to beat them all....
---
I remember when got surrender to madness as thief rogue and played it which was pretty good.
---
Until i played tess and it played it again resulting in me losing.
---
Because Hearthstone is well-known for its consistency...
---
It's ironic how C'thun was made out to be the old god with a cult following, yrt Yogg is the one worshipped by half the sub.
---
thanks as always for your hard work, GrinningGoat!
---
Trump's ratings are based on what he thinks the meta will be.  Like a card that some people would rate a 5, but because Trump doesn't think that class will be played, he'll rate it a 1.  Of course correctly predicting the meta doesn't happen and some cards get wildly valued wrong.
---
Your art is always my favorite on HS! So bold and colorful, always making it fun and bringing the spirit of the game into the art itself!
---
One day, I hope to be as skilled as you, my focus is more line heavy on illustration but I aim to learn how to properly paint and your illustrations are always on top of my moodboard next to Garret Hannah‚Äôs.
---
Thanks for sharing!!!
---
He probably didn't.

Here is a great article about "scrubs" which can be applied to people who complain about netdecking. 
---
http://www.sirlin.net/ptw-book/introducingthe-scrub
---
By this article, I'm a scrub. While I still netdeck, I prefer subpar strategies, I just don't get on reddit and whine about "cheaters" playing top tier decks. 
---
I play Kibler's Plot Twist Warlock.  It sucks, but it's tons of fun to pilot. And when I win... eat it neck decking cheaters!

I indeed had a great time beating big priest the game after that. It must have been you.
---
Lol. I agree with the first half of your post almost as much as I disagree with the second half.
---
Refunds for what exactly? If you're a Wild player, you're not going to disenchant Wild cards now, or at least very few of them, so the fact that they'd give less dust to disenchant wouldn't impact you (or very little). This change would only benefit you, immensely, because you could raft twice as many new cards for your Wild collection for the same amount of dust from then on.
---
Also obviously, if this successfully attracted lots of new players to the format, then it would also benefit you indirectly, because the field would become more varied, there would be shorter waiting times for games, and the format would get more support in general.
---
The only argument I could see would be if you invested a lot of real money into Wild packs from the shop. But even this claim would be flawed in its logic. When something goes on sale, you don't give a refund for the price difference to every customer who bought it at full price in the past. That was the price then. It's just upside from now on if the price lowers.
---
So yeah, aside from a knee-jerk "don't lower the value of *my* cards!" reaction, I don't follow.
---
i have the feeling they only existed to make certain cards work wuth rogues, e.g. discover a secret.
---
The whole reveal is annoying to me.  The are artificially creating an "offseason".  It appears to be good for streamers - bad for fans.  I'm not a big fan of most streaming anyway.
---
The actual reveal of cards coming out 1 at a time is also something full of so much speculation it's infuriating.  
---
I would love to just have every single card revealed a week or so before the expansion and be done with it.
---
Kripp gave most class cards (like 70%) at least a 4 star rating. Nuetrals he was more even with, though I disagreed with a few (Phalanx Commander being 1 star for example, I think its 2)
---
Shiet!
---
Congratsss
---
You should die
---
Stroking my beard.
---
Oh...
---
I'll give you some tips..
---
If it's your most common matchup you struggle with, replace a card that's weak in that match-up and not insane in control/midrange with Silence.
---
Try to build several medium sized mechs, this means you don't get punished that hard by spider bombs and venomizers, but you're still baiting them out so they can't combo it with Missile Launcher.
---
Clear every mech they play until you want to push for lethal, or there's a large enough non-mech minion that's a better target to kill. Their main way of gaining the board back is magnetizing onto mechs they already have on board.
---
Mulligan for Consecration(best card in this matchup) and Crystology mainly, also kinda Bronze Gatekeeper. Zilliax is okay, especially going second, Call to Adventure is fine, Glowstone is good sometimes too. Truesilver is good at clearing stuff like Ursatrons too. Skaterbot and Annoy-o-Module are also usually great, however you might want hand effects and draw if you're going second. If you're running silence, keep it. Try not to ruin your game against Midrange Hunter though, so take Skaterbots and even Silence at your own peril, decide which hand is on average best in both match-ups. The occasional Secret Hunter will probably pwn you though.
---
Try to put them into a situation where their best answer is Venomizer. Put yourself in their shoes and make yourself say: I want to play Venomizer here. However, don't commit so hard into one mech or it will punish you too hard. Additionally, you can have a mech with low attack so they can't kill it with Spider Bomb in the same scenario. Baiting it out is key because removing a Venomized Missile launcher is hard and that combo can ruin you.
---
When you think they might Venomizer+Missile Launcher you, try to set up an egg with enough attack to kill it, so they can't trade it well and you can kill it next turn. Bonus Points if you land Annoy-O-Module or Zilliax on it. If they've used both Venomizers, they're screwed when you kangor's, even if you get back Wargears, unless they can kill you quickly. Lightforged Blessing wins you games if they're close to lethal too.
---
These tips should help up your winrate, the match might be unfavourable for you but there are many ways to gain an edge over your opponent that have helped me get a good winrate against Mech Pally, I think it's over 60%, not too sure. Most of them are generally not accustomed to the Mech Pally matchup and many aren't the greatest players, so you can keep those things in mind for this match-up too...
---
Hope this helped!
---
Switch seems like a natural platform for games like Hearthstone.

YeAh cAn‚Äôt wAiT fOr hIS ‚ÄúTruMp RevIeWs TrUmPs rEvieW‚Äù

I would literally put money on Siamat being just about the biggest flop this expansion sees. It will not play a significant role in any t1 deck once September comes around, and that's assuming it's in decks at all. It is *soooo* much more restricted than people want to see. If it lives until your next turn your opponent wasn't able to kill a 6 health minion turn 7+ so you basically already won, so Windfury is only relevant with Rush, which makes it a very expensive slightly upgraded Multishot. It can't kill anything big (including giants), can't go into any taunts with 6+ attack, and will die to 2 rush attacks nearly every time on a turn 7+ board. There are some absurd fringe cases where he's strong but you can say that about almost any card.
---
He's at best mildly flexible neutral removal.
---
If it were like a 5 mana 4/5 instead of a 7 mana 6/6 it would be strong for mid-game removal. But as statted he's awful.
---
Go 2nd
---
Let me guess, he was cc mage
---
You only lose that game if they get really lucky. Usually you just flood mechs and they don't have Silence or Poly, sucks to lose to either normal or Luna's Cyclone Mage decks.
---
Mec hunt !
---
Kripp gives 5* to "This has potential to shape the meta", 4* to "This is a good card", 3* to "eh, decent, could work, idk", 2* to "ummm, nah" and 1* to "no fucking way" kind of cards. Thus, many class cards can get 4*, though not all, some get 5*, some 3*, some 2*.
---
Thanks for the write up! I've been playing odd warrior but hate auto losing to jade druid and shudderwock. I think this is exactly what I've been looking for.
---
Bomb hunter might be the better option, unoptimized decks do very poorly against aggro
---
dQw4w9WgXcQ for life
---
He is 7 mana. That is his downside.
---
Could you wait at least for a week? Pretty please?
---
So he got pissed at you for stacking mechs while he was stacking mechs?
---
Do you always emote that much?
---
Autosquelch ftw
---
&gt; Also, remember that Trump gave 1 stars to almost all mage cards (including the box of yogg saron) 
---
Puzzle Box is a weird one. When it was first revealed I thought it was a stupid meme that wasn't worth taking seriously. But then The Lightforge released an Arena tier rating for the card last night, at a 148. 
---
Keep in mind that they heavily penalize 10 cost cards since they're a dead draw for a significant majority of the game. They also heavily penalize random effects.
---
Despite this, the card is still rated as 48% better than average card in the arena. That's pretty stunning.
---
I recognize that it's a difficult card for a human to interpret correctly, as you have to consider all potential outcomes of 10 random spells and then evaluate how good each result is. I think it's important to consider that The Lightforge rates cards using an algorithm, so a computer is actually doing that calculation for us. And that computer really likes this card.
---
Kind of makes sense, though. Yogg-Saron was an oppressively strong card in the meta, to the point where it was nerfed pretty heavily. And people ran specialized decks just to get value out of that one card. Puzzle Box doesn't require you to compromise your deck to utilize it properly.
---
You will be offered plenty of 2 drops, and thier quality will be fairly high.  However, you'll get less out if curving on 2 than on 3.
---
So, I suggest drafting 2s for value only and not forcing the curve.
---
Honorable mention for tinkmaster overspark in the OG trailer.
---
Some Starcraft themed card backs would be great! We already had a Starcraft reference with ETC, why not some more?
---
I love having competitive matches come down to RNG!
---
Ideally a game for the Switch should never have a function that is only available via the touchscreen.  
---
Otherwise, you can't use it when it is hooked up to your TV
---
If Blizz made Hearthstone just Switch compatible, I would prob play non stop. 
---
Being able to screen grab 30 seconds of plays using the record feature would be so easy and easy to import on Twitter or something. 
---
Man, it would be great
---
How did you get mecha chtun?
---
He got a pretty sweet clip out of it. That‚Äôs winning in my books at least.
---
She designs them and maybe She also loves hearthstone.But I  won't force her to design if she doesn't want it.Decide by her,right?
---
Yep, I remember getting Gral as my RR legendary and he halfway somewhat almost works in my C‚ÄôThun Rogue. So he stays for now. It does also help that he eats Keleseth buffed minions now, since he used to not get the buff from them. 
---
(but really I mostly just kept him because he‚Äôs a legendary shark).
---
Reborn is way too strong of a mechanic to stick around and also way too similar to deathrattle(it's basically just a premium deathrattle). They might print a few more cards with it but no way it gets the same representation as Rush, Lifesteal or Discover.
---
That league of EVIL pin tho üëÄ
---
google "Tombs of Terror"
---
What I meant was the interaction being op was unintended. Brode didn‚Äôt design the cards. They didn‚Äôt nerf the legendary. They nerfed a card which synergized well with a legendary. You‚Äôre just mad you got less dust. They conclusively did not specifacally nerf shudderwock which is why you did not receive dust. I think a better argument is that legendary dude that directly summons a card that got nerfed.
---
Watch part 15 of their latest SoU review series. They analyse and predict the SoU meta.
---
Yeah, same.
---
I can see the argument that it's like a neutral firelands portal with a highroll minion...except it can't go face, and that definitely matters.  (Also doesn't ignore taunts, which...isn't usually a big deal but can matter).
---
I don't think most aggro decks want it, for example.  Like...bomb/mech hunter?  Meh.  Pirate raiding party rogue?  Meh.  Token Druid?  Meh.
---
I mean, the card is fine.  Amani War Bear is a 5/7 taunt rush, and that saw a little bit of play.  Rush Divine Shield makes this maybe kind-of like Crowd Roaster, which is run in...about half of all decks that run dragon synergy.  Siamat seems better than Amani War Bear, and similar to Crowd Roaster when it does the rush/divine shield mode.  Probably shows up in some midrangey-controlly decks.  But if Trump thinks it's going to match Zilliax's numbers...nah.  Zilliax goes into a lot of aggro decks (mech decks basically) due to its magnetic keyword, and that's what props up its numbers.  Cards that only control decks want such as Acolyte of Pain and Harrison Jones never put up those kinds of numbers, cause aggro is just more popular.
---
Yup, but they could still do stuff like operating menus on the touchscreen in addition to using the controller, considering how pitifully easy that would be to implement (at least in Unity and Unreal)
---
What do you mean? I guess I mispoke on the curve, but I very much understand (and said it in the vid) that the Hyena Alpha has a conditional. One sentence messing up a sequence spoken off the cuff doesn't invalidate the entire video..
---
How did they change Crystal Core recently?
---
Also what happens in the case that you draft more than 1 quest? 
---
The lack of supporting cards is what nixed C'Thun from Arena. See much the same thing with quests too.
---
Yeah I started watching Roffle‚Äôs pack opening yesterday, saw him open the first pack and turned it off because it‚Äôs more exciting when I open them and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh yeah, that was one of the cooler cards!‚Äù 
---
Whereas a month after release you just click through your card packs quickly because you‚Äôve seen all the commons and rares before so only Epics and Legendaries feel special at that point.
---
&gt;Before UI was printed, some Druid decks also liked Yogg as a boardclear/draw engine.
---
And that's exactly why it shouldn't and will never be un-nerfed. Pre-nerf Yogg was way too consistently good/great when played from behind.
---
Looking at card advantage his opponent has? No way.
---
A card which went face more often than not.
---
Would you say that it was the Uldumate disappointment?
---
So as for the first point I think what I could see Blizz doing is having Wild crafting discounts on "hot" or trending cards, like cards that see spikes in popularity out of relative obscurity. The cost of Wild is not the powerhouses legendaries. You craft those once and for the most part you an run them in a lot of your Wild decks for the rest of time, at least for a longer time period than Standard. The cost of Wild, however, is notable in cases where new combos arise from really otherwise useless cards.
---
It's a good idea for us (players) and a bad idea for Blizzard. Like said by other in this post, we usually buy preorder to get enough dust to craft our new decks and stock the remaining dust for future.
---
I don't know how to make a better version of OP idea, but when someone find a way that makes both sides happy Blizzard probably gonna make it.
---
&gt;star aligner druid was a thing in wild, honestly it was just part of the pre nerf aviana decks
---
Then she doesn't accept and end of story? What are you trying to make of this?
---
Highlander decks are terrible because they are terrible. Not because of warrior
---
She will decline the invitation?
---
That's still not using it correctly. The only way to use it correctly is to imply that Siamat is the same power level as Zilliax, and that that Zilliax is actually a low power level card.
---
That explains why he can't seem to properly aim a pyroblast.
---
Been going to the microsoft gatherings for 5 months since the RoS launch. Always walk away with something cool.  I'm way over the free 15 pack limit so I hope blizzard provides new codes/limit next year.  In addition to your loot I got a sweet hearthstone/SoU Bandanna. https://imgur.com/yEgjuKe
---
...so where are those new player-friendly policies?
---
Not a big fan of the crystal cardback, but using a shrimp as the logo is pretty clever.
---
Leeroy 100%
---
Maly and Alex long term but I'd only get them if they fit into one or more meta decks.
---
As for the rest, I'd wait a couple of weeks until the meta starts to settle before crafting any of these. Also, I'd only craft them specifically for a deck you want to play, not just on raw card value alone.
---
I don't remember that, but I see your point.
---
Yes, i agree with your point. No, this doesn't have to be posted every single day.
---
6/6 is way better than 8/3 or especially 3/8. Also you're totally ignoring the flexibility of the other option. 
---
2/10 analysis.
---
What's your decklist? I've been running a gnome+glinda combo with it for memes but it isn't winning quite so much. Still... 5 gnomes is hilarious.
---
You must construct additional pylons!
---
Yeah, so why make a thread talking about how terrible Blizzard is if we don't even know if it was a good idea or not?
---
That doesn't happen. They usually just clown him for being dreadfully wrong about one or two powerful cards, and then ignore the other 90% of the set he got right
---
You're actually joking right? Cause most of the cards in this game are bad. You have to spend a card that you actually put into your deck to get a random card. You don't gain any resources because you have to play a card to get a random one. You're basically telling me you can pick a class randomly and make a deck of 30 random cards blindfolded and win.
---
That shrimp Korean BBQ one is fantastic. They should just pay her for it and use that one for next month.
---
I use spoofing to find on browser without account and when you find the coin promo you just change your amazon account region. As simple as that.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt get the whole fireside thing. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs cool with a group but I‚Äôm more of a solo player so it‚Äôs not for me. More power to them though
---
i love the crystal one
---
Wild rank 25 babyyyyyyyyy
---
I would use that ramen one permanently
---
I'm not really sure what they mean by "attached to refunds", but Elder Scrolls Legends, and a really greedy p2w card game called Spellstone both give crafting resources as compensation for nerfs. So I'm not sure what they're on about.
---
Yes it fucking is. Everyone knows it even if die hard fanboys like you won't admit it. Just look at twitch viewership and steam charts. The last few majors everyone says were boring af.
---
Honestry the quality is so good I'd have believed it if these were our new cardbacks for next several months
---
How can this work
---
Ok.
---
It does enough for this game. It's a known bug for the current version of the Lineage port. It's actually too sensitive. Will make your finger bounce around trying to pick cards or fuck up where you intended to target a spell or minion.
---
Is there a full bodied pic of yog somewhere out of the water?

I was responding to a claim that the Switch touch screen doesn't have enough accuracy.

I'm pretty sure robed and scepter apply in the order you pick them. Get robes first and scepter will only help over costed minions like giants. Get robes second and your most expensive minions will be 2 mana

We need to draw additionnal pylone.
---
1) Aggro shaman does not its win condition is hit them in the face with doom hammer  with rockbiter weapon and bursting them down with lava burst. If you're relying on randomly generated spells off of haunting visions as a win condition you're doing something wrong. 
---
2) Murloc Shaman - Angler literally makes that deck you got me there but you also can't easily snowball it I cannot count the amount of times I dropped angler played a murloc with it on 2 or 3 and got a four drop and they remove the angler if they remove the second angler you get gassed out. 
---
3.) Midrange Hunter - 1 random effect and one discover effect in the whole deck, shimmerfly and marked shot, marked shot according to HS replay has one of if not the lowest win rate cards in the whole deck. Animal companion has been in the game forever and doesn't consistently give you what you want.

I'd pay for the shrimp one.

Blizzard pls

The only decks that‚Äôll survive and be good are going to be Cyclone Mage and secret hunter next expansion.
---
Alright thanks for the reply.
---
That‚Äôs the content of the solo campaign we‚Äôre eventually getting.
---
It's more for aggro, pirate warrior loves it. Not sure if there will be a aggro deck that can make use of it in standard though
---
Kibler IS rich.
---
I assume updates will be a headache?
---
The switch has a touch screen though

Yeah sure I'm going to loooove playing against a deck that has no burn spells but whoops Zephyrs gave them a Fireball to hit me in the face for lethal because fuck me for thinking building a board would matter. And every other situation where this shit will, inevitably, without a doubt, piss everyone off.
---
They're super good, but I'm sure they have an amazing team already. Some card backs are hits, and some are misses.
---
Zephyrus doesn't pick random cards genius
---
Delicious.
---
Thanks
---
&gt; Yogg's effectiveness was tied to the number of spells you played before him.
---
While technically true, hardly any control-oriented deck will run fewer than 10 or really even 15, and that's more than enough for a perfect combination of spells to win you the game. You're playing spells anyway, that doesn't count as set up.
---
Except Nintendo pre-orders
---
Don‚Äôt use improper analogy. But for the resource argument: cards is a kind of resource. Without considering stats, more cards is always better in card games. Now, when your opponent didn‚Äôt run you down fast with big stats early game, the disadvantage of generating cards (usually they have low stats) can be negated. Eventually, your opponent will lose to you because of running out of cards.
---
We've all heard about those 30-minion control decks and their oppressive win rates.
---
Does.... that even work üòÇüòÖ
---
Shabu-shabu cardback is a stroke of genius. Love the look of the Pylon cardback, it makes me want to say to this artist "YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL CARDBACKS"
---
Never not pizza card back.
---
Just imagine we never asked anything or offered anyone anything because maybe they don't want to and they may choke and die while trying to pronounce a word as complex as "No."
---
You're always right &lt;3
---
Aaaalright dude, alright
---
Ok.Thanks, buddy allen.
---
What is this song?
---
The nice thing about the card being in wild now is that there's a legitimate tech option in the form of sideshow spelleater which gives you the opponent's hero power. It has been popping up on rare occasion in reno decks, and might be an even more appealing option with the release of uldum's quest hero powers.

&gt; Lynessa Sunsorrow: Changed so that buffs would be applied randomly rather than in the order they were cast. Considered a bug fix, so no compensation.
---
This one was pretty annoying to me. It is only logical that she plays spells in the order you casted them (and opens some strategies). They said she would cast them randomly but, when they released her, she played them in order. Out of the blue, one day, they decided that card nobody played either way needed some inconsistency for no reason and changed her to be random.
---
I'm now slightly sadder I never heard it that way in the thousands of hours I spent playing that game.
---
switch
---
Bomb is pretty slow and luck depend and the new cards could be fast enough to counter it. The quests mostly look strong.
---
If the new cards are too weak they can still nerf warrior.
---
They said the sets this year are designed with each other in mind so I expect that the expansion will work.
---
I‚Äôm disappointed I thought these were new card backs
---
I am *totally* ok with some Blizzard Universe crossovers.
---
the sushi one is outstanding!
---
The net result is my issue.  Each EOT effect triggers (visually) in the order the cards were played.  It would add an extra level of strategy if it mattered when each EOT card is played, as it does with deathrattles.
---
The vitality totem was the last one summoned, it triggering last. IMO in this scenario he should have died.  I know that is clearly not how it works and it likely will never be changed.
---
Nah.
---
They dropped a rap in the middle of it.  The 80‚Äôs started that (I was there, in some ways I still am) and since the Uldum theme song is basically Eye of the Tiger the usage of said rap is within era.  
---
I‚Äôm just disappointed we‚Äôre all too lazy and untalented to sing this and post it on YouTube.
---
The point is, there could be one like that in the future that would be viable in a Lynessa deck if Lynessa didn't randomly cast it at the end of her battlecry.
---
The legendary pool has a lot of big bombs, but it has a lot of whiffs too.
---
Current team is exactly the same, I remember they claimed "the possibilities of an online card game are endless" but so far I haven't seen those endless possibilities, copied keywords from other games and pumped out cards that are just more of the same. At least the original adventures were fun.
---
&gt; How does your opponent "grossly punish you" if he knows you have a one health minion in hand? 
---
Or two of them!
---
&gt; By saving his elven archer/swipe/whatever?  
---
Yes.
---
&gt; It's not really punishing to have your eggnapper or basilisk pinged 
---
It is, yes, really punishing, when you opponent removes the cards you play for free.
---
No, you're thinking about when they actually nerfed Warleader and made him give less of a health buff.
---
We didn't get dust when they made the mechanic change to murlocs. Here is a past reddit post to prove it: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/58jq8w/is_anyone_else_bummed_about_the_change_to_murlocs/d90yyag/
---
Pit lord. I crafted him when I was f2p
---
That would be a strong pick.
---
Hunters mark was nerfed twice. From 0 to 1 then later from 1 to 2.
---
sorry for the late response, i think the other guy's decklist looks so much better than mine haha. i also really like the faceless rager addition, that's a good card i didnt think about running
---
*unzips*
---
Back in the pre-Naxxramas days I thought lightspawn was pretty insane.
---
ooo dat pylon
---
He doesnt magically get those pings added to his hand just because you know you have 1hp minions and pinging an eggnapper doesnt remove it. Chances are he would have hold the ping anyways until you played something he can use it on
---
this card is actually hilarious haha
---
You still have it?
---
what does wish even mean? lol
---
Yes
---
As long as the deck has a backup plan for the games you draw Maly too early.
---
I love burgle/tess rogue so much
---
I mean... For people that own a switch but not a phone?
---
Plus if people abuse these prices they will just raise them to US prices, which means not only that you lost your "cheap card offer" but also fucked players from poorer countries.
---
Hydra isn't an aura
---
I used to think that Mind Control was the most broken, busted card in the game and you'd have to be absolutely insane to run a Priest deck without it.
---
Came here to say that, nice to see there are other men of culture.
---
Games are always fun, win or lose. Was especially fun when hero cards were in rotation and you could shift into another class and replay all your rogue cards with Tess as well.
---
So we are in agreement then that Yogg requires some set up.
---
Right. It‚Äôs clearly more likely that they are purposefully making the game worse than trying their best to make people enjoy it enough to spend money on it. That makes way more sense. 
---
Come on. Do you listen to yourself before you post? Maybe they were wrong to nerf it, but the intention is painfully obvious to anybody not willfully blinding themselves to it. There‚Äôs not some crazy conspiracy going on. Their views on the state of the game differed from yours and they acted according to their perspective, not yours. That‚Äôs it.
---
Playing anything else against cubelock made you want to slit your wrists though.
---
this makes me happy haha
---
Holy crap this is so depressing to look at.......apparently the correct answer was "none of the above"....
---
Omega assembly heh
---
I definitely enjoyed this previous meta more than the meta prior to it. I couldn't stand the DKs anymore. Probably in the minority but I enjoyed this meta much more in the early half than the later half. I know rogue was a problem, but I enjoyed playing mage warrior and rogue intermittently more as opposed to now where it feels like I'm constantly queuing into warriors. On top of that, I know people have a huge issue with CC mage, but I still prefer the mages over the warriors. I just hate the way the warrior matches drag out. Feels like constant board clears and armoring until they go Dr. Boom, at which point the mechs with rush become such efficient board clear, it feels like a lost cause to continue even playing. I'm excited to play control shaman in the new meta

Oh, lmao I thought they were claiming that Giggling got nerfed 3 times.
---
Well, I guess you have to keep updating how many years have gone by with no improvements....
---
I don't really feel that any of the 6 are all that interesting or would add more to my game.
---
Perhaps Blizzard's research found that people like me are the majority.
---
New mechanics and sets are what enhance the game for me and they've delivered on that. The fluff listed above would be a waste of resources to me.
---
Odd paladin couldn‚Äôt run it, it was 2 mana.
---
Apparently both players low HP (if only you then might offer Alex instead) with enemy having little to no board precense.
---
Save the best for last
---
Nah, y'all going back too far. He hasn't been relevant in at least 3 years. The point is control and handlock decks would not consider running him today, regardless of this "nerf."
---
30 legendaries.
---
mmmm outjerked yet again
---
Fuck you OP
---
The point of playing this game competitively has NEVER been to build a deck you enjoy. 
---
If you don't want to be competitive that's all well and good. But if you do play mech Hunter and stop complaining about warrior.
---
Thank you, I was comparing them lore wise and figured there is something that I don't know and I generally hate that. Thank you again.
---
I seem to gravitate to bad decks in trying to putsmart the meta. My last one started as a Midrange Hunter with [[Untamed Beastmaster]] and progressed to hyper-aggro with Hive Queen, Dinomancy and Young Dragonhawk. I almost got away with it, too, but then the set rotation happened.
---
And before you ask, yes, every once in a while Master's call would brick. But I mulliganed for Beastmaster pretty hard, leaving 0-1 in the deck and then saved Master's Call for after Dire Frenzy on a Dragonhawk. The real problem was a lack of card draw for the other components - Bestial Wrath, the other 1 mana Bestial spell, and Goblin Prank (don't laugh, it added 6 damage to my charging, Dire Frenzied, Beastmaster-enhanced, Dinomanced Dragonhawk (1 mana charging, windfuried 8/8).
---
As in over powered. Not bad.
---
Wait really. Didnt know that
---
Heal Druid‚Äôs pretty fun when you watch the eyes of warriors as they slowly realize that you‚Äôre not token Druid and that no matter how hard they try, they won‚Äôt be able to escape the inevitable doom of 6 eternal lucentbarks even after they played dr boom on curve and 6 omega devastators.

But you need decks that can counter decks.

We're talking about the same Heroic Adventure Blizzard AI that casts Jaraxxus and then Sacrificial Pact on itself. Right?

‚ÄúThe point of this game is not to play decks you enjoy‚Äù. The fuck??

Somebody edit a dj desk into this

Sure but she'll only be paid minimum wage and get laid off once they've overworked her for a few moths.
---
Then just say that, hot garbage means something is bad, not that it's overpowered.
---
Did you do this from scratch? This is so well done i thought it was an oficial artwork from Blizzard!
---
Oh boy this gives me the creeps.
---
No people downvoted you because you brought unneeded toxicity by insulting blizzard and everyone who plays warrior.
---
If the deck you‚Äôre using can‚Äôt beat control warrior use one that can. If you don‚Äôt want to switch decks play casual mode; ranked is for people who want to adapt to the meta and earn their way to the top. Playing non meta decks is fine but complaining that everyone else is in the wrong when you aren‚Äôt adapting is just nonsense
---
C'thun is rather easily done in a physical card game. A game like MtG would do it by using counters on players.
---
Energy was kind of a similar mechanic to C'thun, for example, the difference being that the payoffs worked differently.
---
Prob same as last time 700 per wing so 2800 gold. If you spend all your hard earned coins you can earn that much in two months EZ
---
Why no üÖ±Ô∏èancient one rogue?
---
Yep, this is pathetic.
---
I recon the last adventure is probably a good marker buddy. 700 gold a wing with the first wing free seems the going rate.
---
This actually happened to me for the first time yesterday, a Rogue got Sac Pact off a Blink Fox and killed me. THE ODDS LMAO
---
if you're hardstuck rank 15 i'm guessing you either made your own deck or took a netdeck and made substituions for some cards that made it much weaker. 
---
mech hunter is favored against all mage and warrior decks.

My wild jade shaman has gotten me to rank 10!

Same here. It was going to be the highlight of the evening. Instead, I played quest hunter with 7 copies of [[Beeeees!!].
---
Give this man some gold!
---
You tryna say healing for 5 is bad? For 0 mana? At the low low cost of removing a 'demon'?
---
Wild cubelock, bother pre and post nerf. Still probably my most favourite deck I ever tried to play as and against.
---
I don‚Äôt
---
I can‚Äôt remember the name because it never sees play now. The one with the three dwarves stacked on each other.
---
I thought it was crazy because of how many stats it came with and how sticky it was - but nowadays you have so many removal options that it hardly matters anymore (wild player).
---
I‚Äôll hold your fish if you catch my drift
---
Decks that all have favorable winrates vs Control Warrior, take your pick:  https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/2/control-warrior#tab=matchups

* Mech Paladin
---
* Mech Hunter
---
* Mid Range Hunter
---
* Freeze Mage
---
* Pogo Rogue
---
One thing you have to learn to do if you want to break out of Rank 15 is how to adapt to the meta you're facing it, complaining about it isn't going to accomplish anything.
---
Yes! 
---
Thanks :)
---
6pm in London (gmt) easier maths than working it out from americas!!
---
The point isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs a ‚Äútrash card.‚Äù 
---
Senjin got power creeped hard. It‚Äôs a decent card but it‚Äôs going to be passed over for other cards instead. On a grade scale it‚Äôs sitting at a C. It‚Äôs by no means terrible.
---
I love these
---
yeah looked kinda similar to mine too probably still tier 3 though in the longrun
---
Wait are that tears coming out of his eyes?
---
Those poor Control Warrior players. Just trying to play an honest an skillful deck and then getting absolutely slapped in the face by a ridiculous RNG play.
---
As if the Sac Pact Jaraxxus mechanic needed more opportunities to occur.
---
Strawmaning what exactly? The dude above me (and below RiZZaH) clearly misunderstood RiZZaH's question. Am not refuting anything here.
---
That's also a weird way to express jealousy over internet points but hey, you do you.
---
So if i complete my quest that i have gotten today (the 6th) i Will recieve the saviors of uldum quest later?
---
Yes, it‚Äôs just you. You are a genius. I seriously don‚Äôt know what this subreddit would do without you. This post deserves 69k upvotes for its creativity and originality.
---
You seem bitter.
---
Good. Long live warrior, the most skillful and interactive class.
---
Play Zepherys
---
Wish for Auchenai Soul Priest
---
Kill
---
That's great and I understand it, but the problem is crippling one archetype without adding any new way to play it when it wasn't meta defining. Do you think it has been a good decision that an slower Control Paladin has had less tools all this time to try?
---
It can‚Äôt be fetched by call though? You play secret keeper and contender, which are the reasons the deck is good, and they break call, and there‚Äôs no way 3 mana tutor 1 is good enough, even with a 4/7/7
---
Because I like playing Mech Buffadin. And not having to roll in a bloody Equality combo because it's just that good is a nice feeling. Not having ^(1)/8th of my deck built for me is a nice feeling.
---
He will forever remember how you've treated him. On his last day his last tear will fall while he's thinking of that terrible moment in his life.
---
It‚Äôs a generated card though, so more like discard 1/2 a card.
---
You're a more optimistic man than me, but I applaud you for it.
---
Which is why I run a Control Warrior deck I built myself with quad silence for all that Mech bullshit and double Supercollider to shit on Cyclone Mage when they highroll.
---
It certainly appears to be Tree of Life after Auchenai Phantasm (The healing = damage this turn spell, but attached to a minion).
---
Avenging Wrath isn't guaranteed. 6 could go face and 1 into each minion, leaving up a 3/1 Zilliax.
---
Agreed.  
---
Zephrys will end up being so strong in plot twist warlock just from all the discoveries.
---
Fair enough, but my point was that big cards with huge effects shouldn't be automatically pushed aside just because they are slow.
---
What‚Äôs there to be bitter about? It‚Äôs an obvious and known fact that Dr Boom isn‚Äôt all that strong. It needs a small buff. Read my above comment.
---
Yeah the dude below rizzah attacked a straw man.
---
 Internet points only matter in so far that the silence or boost an opinion.
---
Lol, this post won't age well.

I didn't ask for upvotes, I wanted to know if anyone else had this issue. :)

You know, the worst part about this isn‚Äôt that you‚Äôre the one thousandth person to post this crap, but that you‚Äôve beaten 178 Dalaran heist bosses, which only includes that wing. This either means that after 178 bosses, you still can‚Äôt beat an easy ass adventure or you spend all your time doing the Dalaran heist over and over again. Sad. Just sad.
---
Same. When this game is on its last breathe, we're getting a diablo expansion or something to that effect. I have 0 evidence to back that up but I'm calling it now.
---
I would assume so. You're way ahead in time zones, the expansion isn't going to come out for at least another 16 hours (I think).
---
America trading 80g quest, Muzz#1640 (will be online for the next hr or 2)
---
Not being dishonest at all and you are being too aggressive for a calm discussion. They actively nerfed a card so we cna talk a reason. Also, it was a tool that could be used with the cards they release still. Expansions are made in advance but then why nerf it at that point. I'm basically begging people to just explain why my perception about equality is wrong if they disagree. I'm not fighting someone here.
---
Tiny fraction of cards that are playable until they are deemed inconsistent ...
---
The reaction here is obviously related to the cost issues, seems as fair a place as any to bring up the actiblizz greed.
---
Mogu Fleshshaper
---
People are sleeping on it. Super nutty card for Quest/Overload/Aggro Shamans which auto wins you all the games vs other tempo decks. Between Hunter, Rogue and Shaman, there is so much minion spam that you will get it for free around t3-4 which is an insane tempo swing those decks probably cant deal with. Think about how strong sea giant is in spam vs spam decks. This card comes out even earlier and has an immediate board impact. Disgusting.

And people usually downvote me, when I'm saying here (or at other hs subreddits) that Blizzard are laziest company which cares only about money. There is no way full time working team couldn't achieve this goals for 5 years. It's lack of funding, lack of care, lack of interest.
---
Thank you kind strager for this picture, I will save it to repost it 3 years later.
---
It‚Äôs actually straight up better than Boom. I know I‚Äôm going to be downvoted for this, but only microbots and sometimes drone delivery are better, most of the time this is better AND more consistent, and that‚Äôs if you only summon 1 4/3. If you summon 2 it becomes miles better than Boom. The problem is that everyone is looking at Warrior as a control class, and not just a class.
---
Boom is better for control, but the quest is better than Boom, and it even has more consistency in that you always start with it, and you always summon a 4/3, where with Boom you sometimes just deal 1 damage to the enemy hero.
---
I used to play a Druid deck that had nothing but cards that gives you armor. No win condition tho.
