In WoW, Basilisks are pretty large, so [[Stoneskin Basilisk]] definitely qualifies. Additionally, Dreadscale was an enormous worm-monster.

Thank you yes that‚Äôs exactly it it was arena and i did pick the second one haha sorry if it was confusing

First off: The deathrattles need to happen in the right order. The Undatakah needs to go dormant first, THEN restore health to be re-awakened. Not the other way around. So this is a 50/50.
---
Next, he'd come back as a plain Lucentbark without the Doctor's deathrattle. So this wouldn't cause any kind of infinite cycle.

Aw it's a shame King togwaggle is rotating out. I guess I'll have to meme in wild. 
---
Vilespine isn't a core card in Myracle, losing Striders is big but ultimately it's just 2 cards.  The draw engine is still there, so the deck should still exist.
---
Hey guys thanks for the answers. I didn't think it would work but was just curious. 
---
Ratings based namely on how good the cards are to be summoned (cards dependant on their battlecry will not fare so well)
---
Excellent: King Mukla, Jungle Panther, Emperor Cobra (hard removal is always a good thing),
---
Good: Nightmare Amalgem, Iron Fur Grizzily, Augmented Elekk.
---
Bad: Messenger Raven, Silverback Patriarch, Blink Fox, Duskbat.
---
Terrible: Iron Beak Owl.
---
Dont remember Ornery Tortoise stats but its battlecry not going off should make it at least a decent roll.
---
I've got a new smartphone I'd love to show up.
---
This isn't one of those things where you need three decks to enter the tournament, is it?
---
Reno shudderwock without any face damage cards (except for the 5/5/5 shuffle a bomb into your opponents deck)
---
&gt; especially when you want to play around opponent's Brawls.
---
Right, so every card ever is a bad card because there's a card that "beats" it.
---
&gt; This card doesn't bring you closer to fatigue and has Dr.Boon's Rush synergy for being a Mech minion.
---
Thank you for stating what I've already said.

4/3/6 | Your other minions have Rush.  
---
Thats not what is says on the Hearthstone Wiki [https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shudderwock#cite\_note-30max\_1-1](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Shudderwock#cite_note-30max_1-1) 
---
Patriarch is the real highroll
---
Replace Dire Mole with the new 1/1's, replace Razormaw with Headhunter's Hatchet, replace DK Rexxar with Halazzi and maybe 1x Starving Buzzard.  If Control is a problem then add more 6-drops.
---
I think Dire Mole -&gt; Razormaw would have been broken, like Shamanstone Trogg-&gt;Golem level of good, in the new meta.  Everyone is getting powered down, this includes Midrange Hunter.  But Master's Call still exists, so the deck still has powerful things to do.
---
definitely in the "fuck it I'll just use my banked gold" camp
---
You are wrong. Gives you 10 extra cards at fatigue and will also get rid of bombs etc in your deck.
---
I don‚Äôt remember coldlight oracle having so much blood on his teeth! 
---
Super cool helmet, I want one too but maybe for Bearshark!
---
Go ahead and pretend you lose games after playing her while you're at it.
---
That would do nothing. You'd just discover twice but only the second one would count because it replaces your whole deck, not adds to it.
---
I suppose you're right, I just really wanted to play it because I have a bit of a wallet warrior theme going on so wanted to play as many legendaries as possible xD.
---
Hey, it works for Kun
---
I like it
---
played like hundred or so games with pogo rogue few months ago problem is not drawing pogos, problem is you cant play pogo without drawing pogo ,lab recruiter, shadowstep vs  so you have bunch of cards in your hand which you cannot play and rest of your cards are  bunch of low tempo cards like witchwood piper and shit. 
---
Even if you survive with little to no minions to turn 8 or so and do your thing your opponent doesnt die instantly unlike maly rogue or any other combo deck 
---
Bought 60 packs on your dollar and knew they didn‚Äôt have the funds to pay you back. What a great friend. 
---
Daamn, he had a lantern jaw
---
Just wait 'till pogo rogue gets it's own 2 mana 2/3 rush gain +1/+1 for each pogo-hopper in your deck.
---
THE ***ZANCIENT*** ONE
---
Midrange hunter lost some pretty key cards too. Part of the reason it did so well was because the Rexxar DK allowed it to beat control decks if they haven‚Äôt already killed them past turn 7. 
---
I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll still see a lot of Midrange Hunter but idk if it‚Äôs accurate to call it the same deck anymore. Maybe just aggro Hunter?
---
Absolutely, KnC was definitely building off of KotFT, which is why I don‚Äôt really consider it to be power creep. KnC didn‚Äôt really create any new archetypes other than cube decks and tog Druid once jade rotated, but it did give every class incredibly powerful tools that they still use today, whereas MSoG completely revamped the meta because we had never seen anything quite like it. So in terms of influence MSoG takes the cake but in terms of the sheer power level of individual cards KnC wins out. 
---
I dont get how, flavor wise, this mech summons a copy of a minion in your deck.
---
But Violet Teacher exists 
---
I‚Äôve played since beta and I‚Äôm still as satisfied as ever. I like hearthstone because of the standard ranked mode. I‚Äôve never touched single player content beyond what‚Äôs ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to obtain cards/packs. I just want to ladder. I don‚Äôt need or want anything else. Keep new cards coming and I‚Äôm pleased as a peach. 
---
Maybe but there‚Äôs a lot more combo disruption this year!
---
I'll be pre-ordering WAR instead.
---
I mean that's still 2 Lucentbarks
---
This^
---
Yea but you can take the entire turn just to decide to play the card or not.
---
I‚Äôm the same way. I love close competitive games. Don‚Äôt care about single player, I don‚Äôt play arena, I literally only play standard casual and ranked (and with my friends). I‚Äôve bought every expansion and never felt like I was wasting my money. 
---
Kun was never good at refreshing into a 10 drop. His use was providing up to 100 mana worth of minions with Aviana.
---
Zelda Fans: Wind Waker
---
Yep, this is me as well. Spending $130 feels like there would just be diminishing returns so I'm just buying the $80. 
---
You monster.
---
Haha, serves em right
---
Rather than it being a sleeper set, I think people don't give it enough credit. It has amazing cards for Hunter (Zul'Jin, Master's Call, Baited Arrow), Rogue (Hooktusk, Walk the Plank) and Warrior (Voone, Emberscale Drake, Smolderthorn Lancer, Dragon Roar) as well as the neutrals I've written about previously. Additionally it has support for multiple archetypes like Immortal Prelate and Discard Warlock (and even Treespeaker for Druid if Token Druid takes off in Rise of Shadow). Plus it contains card that are certain to see play for the next year like Mass Hysteria. 
---
Really its strenght is clearly here, and Baku/Genn being gone as well as the old sets will definitely show how good Rumble's cards are.
---
Dude I hope he appreciated that joke, I did.
---
Dies to tempo rogue...
---
Anybody else find it a little odd that, even though blizzard will never print cards on the same level of the year of the mammoth and year of the raven again, they're adding tech cards for it? I understand that this is mostly to combat any combo decks from popping up, but doesn't this just feel like it's a little too late? 
---
Pepega
---
There are better ways to word it too, like it could have said "Its owner summons 2 minions of the same cost."  
---
It makes sense when you think about it, but compared to how most cards are worded, this one was pretty weird.
---
Iconic colors. 
---
Card wise this seems as boring as the last two. Schemes have been seen before, callback cards are nice but novelty and twinspell is just boring. But it will have by far the best rotation so this will be a fun as hell expansion. 
---
No. I am more curious on what would it summon seeing as there are no 10+ minions. Would it replace themselves?
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one annoyed by the (increasingly common) redefinition of the phrase "to beg the question".
---
there were a lot of good cards in that expansion u're right but i feel like in this one not only the legendaries are good but also the rest of the set
---
Other giants?
---
More specifically, the sword took away Arthas's morality, empathy, most of his free will, and his heartbeat. Source: played WC3 and 'I read between the lines', so to speak.

1/-/- | Twinspell  Freeze a minion. If it's already Frozen , deal 2 damage to it.  
---
Is following Baku into HoF
---
This card is actually absurd, in both constructed and arena.  Maybe a little bit too absurd...
---
I understand they‚Äôre rotating/rotated out but when your question is ‚Äúmost expensive expansion‚Äù while discussing how the power level of the cards, you have to compare to previous expansions. It‚Äôs the nature of the question.
---
This is the first expansion in a while that I'm actually excited about as someone who primarily plays mage. 
---
Maybe [[Former Champ]]? A 5/5 and 2 other 5-cost minions for 8 doesn't seem terrible. Or [[Fungalmancer]], +4/+4 in stats and 2 other 5-costs. And [[Giggling Inventor]] got nerfed, so it would give you 2 7-cost minions.
---
Interesting thing about the buffs, I dont really see it happening but I can imagine a world its possible.
---
Youre probablly right about it being a one of, since I cant see playing it more than teice a game and only at the late game. Although interesting thing to consider is high cost deathrattle minions since this card destroys the minion, but I dont think there are that many good high cost dr card.
---
I feel like Glyph was way better during Mammoth because of available spell quality anyway. 5 mana Firelands Portal was devastating

I think  Deathstalker Rexxar would be pretty balanced if a lot of beasts didn't have rush/poisonous effects, it's pretty frustrating when your opponent pulls out something like \[\[Vilebrood Skitterer\]\] + \[\[Cave Hydra\]\] or \[\[Exploding Bloatbat\]\]. Tbh I think blizzard printed Vilebrood just for Deathstalker Rexxar's hero power.

Kripp's video on stream showed it being cast on a Spiteful Summoner and summoning a Blastmaster Boom and War Golem.

No. The minions are summoned on the same side as the minion killed. so if you use it on the opponent, he gets two random minions.

---
Why is the music u used so good

I'm glad you said this because at first I thought this card copied the battle cry minions in your hand, which would have been insane.

I don't think this will ever be ran over Polymorph or Potion of Polymorph
---
You‚Äôre in a bad position. Sorry about the food and gas thing. You might have to suffer through a few days of ramen, canned vegetables, and water. How long until pay day comes?
---
Half priced sets mean that you'd have a shit ton of leftover dust.  Realistically what you would want to do is only get the pre-order bundle, then just buy another 4 boxes of wild to finish off the remainder of the new set.
---
Best preorder was MSoG with the ~30% bonus packs because of the opening bug.
---
Ok on my defense i didnt know they had pre releases 
---
if huffer wasn't a token this would be 5/5
---
It adds "to replace it" to imply that they're spawned on the side they've died. But I can see how this may cause some confusion. Some people will use this on the opponent's minions expecting to get two for themselves, but that would be the most broken card ever.
---
I was slightly hoping to see a legendary themed after \[\[nightmare amalgam\]\]. Something like battlecry: all minions are all minion types. Still excited for this set though
---
Begs the question is still a valid term in this context. It can be synonymous with "Raises the question" as well as refer to a logical fallacy.
---
I'd say I should say "Raises the question" for the sake of clarity, but considering it's pretty obvious what the meaning is here, I wouldn't even say that.

How? Unless you hit Barnes, you're just giving them other huge minions in their pool.

---
Congrats man. Just came back after missing a few sets, and recently finished this too. Warrior was absolutely brutal. Did all the others in like 2-5 tries, but when I finally beat warrior I think I had over 100 bosses defeated. A good chunk of that conceding after the first boss until I got the 5 drop passive or the flag. The base deck for war was hot trash.
---
Dude, Blizzard, enough with the RNG. 
---
I‚Äôm very worried they‚Äôre pushing RNG as a way to lessen the divide between competitive players and new players. 
---
Because to a new player it‚Äôs fun and gives you a random chance to win games. But to a competitive experienced player it‚Äôs frustrating and unpredictable.
---
Seems toxic.
---
It‚Äôs a giant penis
---
Yeah, Deathrattle isn't a theme Mage has been particularly fond of, so unless there's a *really* intense Deathrattle "package" that Mage would like to take advantage of, I don't see that happening so much, either.

Save or spend gold in wait for next expansion?
---
Ok I'll delete that and post another tomorrow and see what you think then. I do take it all on board. If you don't mind checking in tomorrow?
---
Aye. You are essentially deleting a less healthy minion and replacing it with 2 healthy ones. You get a full health trade (maybe) before you sacrifice your minion. So I'll allow 3 to some extent. Not sure where 4 comes from unless it be a deathrattler.

This is not a gif. And yet, we all can see the same movement on loop.

You don't really need to cheat anything out though. You can extract value bu simply targeting a damage minion, a minion with a battlecry with high cost and low health, or to activate a Deathrattle. Then on the side its removal in a pinch. Not bad for 3 mana really.

Doesn't that usually mean synergy cards for the class with least reveals to-date?

But don't you think eventually it won't be worth complaining about because the chances your complaints have been seen/heard are so high, that the only possibility is that those who see them don't care or are listening to others instead?
---
Like I don't get how someone can basically imply they're fine with saying they have issues with something, indefinitely. If you keep partaking in something even though it has issues you continually ask to be fixed and have issues with, particularly if you've gone so far as to stop paying for it, surely the next logical step would be to abandon it altogether? Or perhaps try to convince others to stop paying too?
---
I'm confused, does this summon two minions for your opponent if you destroy one of their minions?
---
Molten reflection but 3 mana and can be used twice, and better on high cost low stat minions

April 9th before the servers go down to update.  Usually around 10 am EST.

#[Hearthstone: Year of the Dragon Checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b1thmu/year_of_the_dragon_checklist/)
---
Card sets from 2017 will be rotating and unplayable in Standard, specifically:
---
* Journey to Un'Goro (Un'Goro) *released* April 2017
---
* Knights of the Frozen Throne (KFT) *released* August 2017
---
* Kobolds and Catacombs (KnC) *released* December 2017
---
So here are things you want to do before Year of the Dragon begins (April 9th).
---
‚òê Make sure to finish KFT Prologue
---
&gt;Finishing the Prologue rewards you with a free Legendary Death Knight.  Additionally, if you finish the Adventure you can get up to 3 more KFT packs. (F2P Guide for [First Wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6sydke/im_the_guy_who_did_the_mostly_free_to_playbasic/), [Second Wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6uf7g5/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/), and [Final Wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6w4koa/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/))
---
‚òê Have Purchased at least one KnC pack
---
&gt; Your first purchase of a KnC pack rewards you with a free Legendary: [Marin the Fox](http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/attachments/55/661/2017-11-03_17-05-30.jpg).  This card cannot be disenchanted or crafted.  
---
‚òê Keep an Unfinished Arena Run at two Losses
---
&gt; When the rotation happens, your Arena draft will contain "illegal Wild cards" and be auto-retired.  You will get a free Arena ticket and the rewards for however many wins you currently have.  So once you have 2 Losses, stop playing, wait for rotation, and get a *minimum* of 1 free pack.
---
‚òê Craft for Hall of Fame
---
&gt;  The full [Hall of Fame Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/)  can be found here.  This is a great way to get a 12-50% return on your dust (or just free dust if you already own the cards).  You can even save cards if you think they will be nerfed in the future with no downside, e.g Genn and Baku. (See *Example 4* in the guide).
---
‚òê Year of the Mammoth Events
---
&gt;Log in March 25th through April 2 to receive 3 free card packs! (one each from Un‚ÄôGoro, KFT, and KNC)  The Tavern Brawl starting April 1 gives you an opportunity to earn a Rise of Shadows pack and [on April 5th you get a free Rise of Shadow legendary that is immediately usable in Play Mode. There will also be a quest chain on launch \(April 9th\)  to reward multiple card packs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dooJlmBjfpUzI-kML8I2dFvSM52qAliUsWAXymYQ0xs/edit)
---
‚òê Pre-Release Party (April 5th-9th)
---
&gt;The [Pre-Release Party](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/the-rise-of-shadows-pre-release-information/) is a special Fireside Gathering event where you can open and use your pre-order packs early.  These cards will have no class restrictions and there are pre-built decks with new cards to play against other attendees which don't require you to open any packs.  You can [go here to find or create](https://firesidegatherings.com/en-us/) a Fireside Gathering. (if it is your first one you can also unlock a special cardback and Warlock Portrait, Nemsy)
---
‚òê Special Pity Timers
---
&gt;You are guaranteed a Legendary within the first 10 packs of a set.  If you haven't opened a Legendary in Un'Goro, KFT, or KnC, you might want to open packs with gold until you do. (even if they are not playable in Standard, you can dust them)  Wait until March 25th as you will get one pack from each of these sets and you might get your Legendary then. 
---
‚òê Disenchant Rotating cards
---
&gt;I do not recommend this as I enjoy Wild and I've seen a lot of regret posts about people dusting Wild cards.  But that is your decision to make, not mine.  [Here is a sheet that will use the cards you own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PtV8vuwufp0nB54lNB-phcDFWhQ_XKviuwvYfQtXEDs/copy) and, using Wild HSReplay stats, allow you to view ones that are and are not used in Wild.  (Works with Hearthpwn and HSReplay accounts).  Anything below the 10-20% range is probably safe to dust.  **However, new cards, mechanics, synergies, or nerfs may invalidate this list so be warned no guide is 100% accurate or safe.**
---
‚òê Anything I'm missing?  I try to keep it simple but I'm not perfect.  Let me know!
---
Wow witchwood was a really good deal
---
Fuck big priest BUT that‚Äôs a good one bud 
---
THE MANCIENT ONE
---
I don't really  wanna give blizzard or activision money again. I'm good.

---
3/3/3 | Battlecry: If your opponent has 4 or more minions, take control of one at random.  
---
that is the gayest take on wild you could possibly have, zero love for the past. Aviana druid was an alltime great deck that blizzard just needlessly nerfed
---
?
---
Giggling summons them.
---
Khadgar doubles the amount summoned. Since this summons two mountain giants if u destroy the one on board you get 4.
---
We‚Äôve already established that I misread. I suggest you read the entire comment conversation between me and the other person.
---
I think I will not use this card on my own minions if I can use it on a big enemie minion
---
Wild should not ever impact the design of a standard card.
---
thats the reason wild was created
---
Then my question is... why not just Polymorph?
---
Final reveal stream.  But did the card art change, I swore it was like a black dragon before.
---
Um. No? You can play "Hero Power Mage" or "Inspire Mage". Whatever it's going to be called
---
I already hate this card. If burgle rogue becomes a thing next expansion it will be the new thing everyone hates.
---
It was kalecgos for some reason but they updated it.
---
So lets say i destroy enemy's minion, do i summon the 2 minions for me or for the opponent?
---
This seems so op for a 3 cost card
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
The only time you‚Äôll ever see Silverback Patriarch
---
I've been desperate for rotation since boomsday. Even then, I was genuinely concerned Baku and Genn were killing the game for me. 
---
Lots of the cards look interesting, but I dont have a clue as to what's going to be meta. I'm looking forward to crafting a janky Hakkar warlock.
---
If you are still looking for someone i'm interested!
---
Barnes isn't really in a Tier 1 deck (probably will change soon at RoS release) but DAMN does it limit design space in wild.
---
Thanks for reminding me how much I spend on this game :(
---
I mean I‚Äôm really hyped for new archetypes, this expansion seems like another Un‚ÄôGoro which was in my opinion a really good expansion as it had no real obvious packfiller but I‚Äôm cautious because I worry that aggro will be so bad that all the decks cost 10k dust and all the games last to turn limit.
---
This card will be game winning in arena I‚Äôm sure
---
I'd keep them. From time to time wild is a nice experience and you can play some of the old cards. 
---
&gt; And it has to be said that Meteorologist didn't stick around in those lists either
---
Yeah, I, uh... I thought that was implied when I agreed with you on the fact Meteorologist wasn't played, *except when Kibler **tried** it in his decks.* To me *try* suggests it was tested but didn't make the cut, or "didn't stick around."
---
&gt; You certainly don't run it with Book of Spectres
---
No, I think that'd be the point. You run Meteorologist *because* you can't run your burn spells. It wouldn't be a burn deck, more a midrange deck. 
---
But more likely I don't think the deck would run Book. Draw 3 for 2 is amazing, but I think it handicaps the Mage class too much. I love it Murloc Mage, but beyond that and the rare Glyph -&gt; Book when I'm looking for Toni or a girl in Exodia I haven't found a real home for the card. 
---
I think a midrange Mage deck a la Even Paladin or Even Lock would be the most likely home to feature Astromancer, Meteorlogist, and Conjurer's Calling. I'm not saying this type of deck would be Tier 1. I'm saying this would be the best chance the cards get played. I'm not saying Meteorologist is going to be game-changing. I'm saying in a brand new meta with no DKs and a fresh sense of value, Meteorologist might be flexible enough to fit into this kind of deck. 
---
&gt; But it will definitely also be because you can always "fall back on" using it with Astromancer on Turn 10.
---
Yeah, obviously you're more likely to win if a card isn't dead in your hand. Don't take that fact and make it some grand point.
---
Astromancer + Conjurer's Calling on the same turn isn't something I want to do. It's a decent backup plan if the spawn is *really bad*, but then I'd say Conjurer's Calling is making Astromancer better and more consistent, not the other way around. 
---
Calling doesn't need a combo to rely on. It'll go into decks because it's glue. You can use it to remove a Hecklebot, because most 4s are worse than that. You can use it to add consistency to your Astromancer. You can use it to upgrade your damaged minions. I don't think Calling *needs* anything. It's part of what helps a midrange deck work -- a flexible utility card. 
---
&gt; That is the difference between Gloop Sprayer (only a "nut combo" card) and Carnivorous Cube (which had both)
---
Also 3 mana. And also the fact you could play Cube as a 4/6 if need be but playing a 8 mana 4/4 would probably lose you the game.
---
I don't know how much DR Hunter you played (I finished 800 legend with it last month as a reference), but most games I did not Cube my Egg. That's usually saved for Control Warriors and Mages, or if I had an Argus or 2 in hand. Typically my winning play with Cube was on a damaged Devilsaur out of the egg (like what I'm suggesting you would do with Calling in a midrange Mage deck), or on a Grizzly I played on 5.
---
Now is dust for me
---
[fist of jaraxxus]
---
The two turns casting seance aren't exactly "do nothing" they still leave a minion with a powerful effect and decent stats. If they're left on the board the player may get a good opportunity for other spells. If they're cleared then that's 6 or 7 points of damage not going to the face.
---
I just hope aggresive decks just fuck off
---
Same happened to me on iPhone today.
---
Yes, the first draft would be filled with great cards which would get replaced in the second draft filled with Silverback patriarch and its fellow tier of cards.
---
Bless
---
Egg mage in wild:
---
Use this on a nerubian egg while you have khadgar for 2 nerubians and 4 2 drops.
---
But think of all the extra minions you could summon with kadgar/s
---
The strongest version in standard is probably the Heal Zoolock that runs Keleseth and a happy ghoul, however I found /u/Old-Guardian made a ‚Äúrotation proof mech zoolock‚Äù that is really really satisfying, fun to play and strong

---
seems to be the magic number, if your last class is warlock. did it at aroung 8.5k last week. any classes with significantly higher numbers? and first golden class?
---
Bad cards have always and will always exist but this card is exceptionally bad. It manages to be so bad that if it showed up in an arena draft, it would NEVER be picked. It literally doesnt matter what the other options are, what synergies you have going etc etc.
---
At that point it isnt just a bad/niche card, its just super poor design and outright laziness from Blizzard.
---
This card shouldn't be printed and should be reworked or just outright removed before release.
---
i'll have a hit of that as well, ifya donmind
---
But that is your problem.
---
I fear I am an arena player, so this is my FIRST portrait, not my last.
---
Too late.
---
I have a lot of success with the quest. It's one of the only things that keep me up in the wild meta with discard warlock. I run one Cataclysm to potentially cast turn 4, allowing me to cast the portal immediately turn 5. Its only more and more value from there.
---
I can't believe that Alliestrasza opened it in 6 minutes
---
And yet, such a common combination...
---
$40 to $100 on Amazon depending on how many moves to open. Not sure how many moves these ones took.
---
It would see play at 0 mana, but only because it would be decent with Yip and Heavy Metal
---
Glacial Mysteries is hundreds of times better than Dr. Boom's Scheme though..
---
King Dred is a boss in WOW: https://wow.gamepedia.com/King_Dred
---
Thats the entire gameplay of wild evenlock. Playing an early 8/8 and follow it up with faceless shambler, or more 8/8s.
---
This is not a win more scenario, since an early 8/8 is not enough to win. The factor that will determine if this becomes a reliable strategy is how often they can drop an 8/8 turn 3/4 (with things like research project or book of specters).
---
Someone should make an edit with Tar Creeper and put [this song](https://youtu.be/zo0kAWUHGx0) over it
---
This expansion are some cards that put random spells in your hand. This is a stone you can get. 
---
Arena has it's own ways to deal with bad cards to balance classes (buckets). Maybe they could have gone a different direction or maybe the first iteration was too powerful and it was nerfed to unplayable (happens a lot).  Whatever the case, it isn't something to be upset about especially before we know if the Control archetype even needs it.
---
Oh look, we have another punslinger here. You're also arrested. 
---
This expansion was about some demons that wanted to invade... so they reopened the portal, just like that.
---
God fucking dammit, Khadgar
---
You can see Raiding Party in the collection too. So it's from the current expansion indeed. Not old at all.
---
There can be a difference between summoning or having your opponent summon on your side
---
Hi! Thanks for the reply. For the point 1 I though those expansion gonna rotate this month, we can still use those cards (Un'Goro, Knights of Frozen Throne, and Kobolds) until **next year**?
---
Yeah I guess I'm gonna wait 'till Rise of Shadow's pack and community new deck / meta release. Too bad about Spell Hunter, I guess Mid Range Hunter also screw up a little bit.
---
Anyway, thanks again.
---
i dont know dude, its an answer to [[Mecha'thun]] 
---
kill it, 2 minions on the  enemy board, its effect fizzles.
---
i see it having niche uses.
---
I would argue that Baku was the problem in that deck

10/10/10 Mech | Deathrattle: If you have no cards in your deck, hand, and battlefield, destroy the enemy hero.  
---
The 2 minion are not for you if you target enemy minion.
---
Since you missed the whole last year maybe don't spend all your money on the new expansion (first expansions of the year are typically the weakest)
---
There's gonna be a $10 for 10 packs bundle on launch for the new expansion. That's your cheapest option. Hopefully they'll do another "catch-up" bundle again.
---
Since we have no idea how the meta will pan out maybe wait 2-3 weeks after rotation to see which expansions are worth investing in.
---
RemindMe! at 10pm
---
Oh shit I missed that too, I'm really sorry for that :(
---
I think is not a mistake. Each scheme is like each villain wants to get after defeating Dalaran and maybe what to get Lazul is the come back of the old gods and that is why the man in the picture is scared 
---
Hi! Thanks for the reply. I already got Legendary Marin The Fox, It's Kobold's and Catacomb the only pack that give us 1 free Legendary card? About Hunter Spell too bad this deck have so many cards that gonna rotate soon, I wish upcoming expansion still have cards that support Spell Hunter in the future, really want to play Zul'jin, looks fun to me.

---
Hi! Thanks for the reply, yeah currently I only interested playing on Standard, well because maybe Wild not really newbie friendly. I'll wait Rise of Shadow's expansion pack release, and new community deck / meta after rotation. Hope there is a new card can support Spell Hunter.
---
Thanks for the reply and the links! 
---
In time reno will be in, like, 80% of the decks. So let them both burn.
---
I enjoy long control games (I hate aggro), but not overly long ones. The current Odd Warrior is already very much testing my patience, because almost every game goes to fatigue.
---
2 books 2 other spells is still doable though. I played 2 books 2 polymorphs for a while (it was the high time of taunt druid) and while yes it adds to whifs it is still pretty playable!  
---
And cloning your wounded mountain giant into 2 full health ones is pretty big even after turn 5.
---
The words are forbidden, hence the hushing gesture.
---
&gt;For the point 1 I though those expansion gonna rotate this month, we can still use those cards (Un'Goro, Knights of Frozen Throne, and Kobolds) until next year?
---
You can use these cards in the Wild format forever, to which you'll have access in a WEEK when they rotate out of standard and can't be played in that format anymore.
---
You could use your gold to buy packs from the three expansions that are rotating out to make sure you get one legendary from each of them, which will happen within the first twenty packs. You'd do that to get the most dust value out of the gold, if you want to craft some cards later on. As for actually playing with the cards you get, those won't be of much help. So if you don't even have around 2000 gold, save up instead for the next expansion - or Classic packs.
---
Honestly, the hs dev team can be a complete joke sometimes
---
For starters never connect your card to a online game. Its better too enter your card information everytime you buy something then risk something like this happen
---
Yip aswell. For my wild deck it would maybe be a good fit, should have mentioned I'm talking about wild tho.
---
&gt; To maximize happiness, stop playing Hearthstone
---
Here let's shake the magic 8 ball:
---
&gt;"Cannot predict now"
---
Hmm. 8 Ball is right. I'd wait until after April 8th to craft!
---
Yeah but that's including dusting epics, which you probably don't have after opening just 50 packs. The math is based on dusting duplicates only after those 50 packs.
---
Welp, no arguing with statistics. I stand corrected. I haven't been playing a lot of standard since Rastakhan and I figured Odd Warrior was still the most played deck. 
---
Just tell him that even if it was a rip-off or anything like that, it introduced do much gameplay that makes him unique, like the discover keyword or the twinspells keyword.
---
[Seems close enough to me](https://i.imgur.com/I0J2cHK.jpg)
---
Don't you think they'd have already done it if it was a simple change? They're not that stupid. Also, this has to be coded to work and then **tested** on multiple platforms, and we have no idea what the codebase is like, so it's not easy to estimate how long that would take.
---
Just let the Deck Builder take the wheel? It gotten better. And I am sure it will make you the most decent decks you can build right now. (Minor adjustments may apply)
---
Tell him that Yugioh is a ripoff from Bridge!
---
Did you just assume my species?
---
#***UNGORO BELONGS TO THE TITANS***
---
^^TO BATTLE
---
He's right
---
Good to know other people are talking about Mecha'thun Hunter! I made my own post about this same deck, and managed to refine it enough to where I'm starting the climb to Legend! My personal recommendation is running Zul'jin, as long as you don't play him when your decks empty, he can work as a secondary win condition or protection/stalling, especially with the secrets. Also Zilliax can help survivability, especially if you use Galvanizers strategy as he can stick to them. 
---
Oh you will be so disappointed of how less you will get. Anyway I will pre-order the small package too.

I will try it, thanks!

How it can deal excess damage to the hero if Divine Shield must absorb all incoming damage? This is a bug.
---
Rexxar is undeniably a really cool card but it obviously needs to go at the same time
---
It follows the rules of Explosive Runes' text.
---
That's kinda vague... If you need help about something try to go into specifics. There's probably a million players who can't get past rank 5, and they probably have a million different reasons.
---
With something vague like that... All we can say is practice a lot, try to figure out why you're losing specific games (was there nothing you could do with the draws, or is it possible you made a mistake, overcommitted, undercommitted, etc?). Watch legend streamers who play the same deck, see what they do differently. 
---

---
No I don't think that. What I do think is that blizzard cares about one thing only which is making money. I think they know no one is gonna stop playing the game because of this, and they would rather spend time developing new shit for us to pay for. I think they, similarly to Nintendo, are lucky enough to have die hard fans who won't let any criticism go unchallenged because of some misplaced sense of tribal loyalty and who will support them endlessly pouring money into their coffers ad nauseum. 
---
Maybe you're right that their code is such a mess that they couldn't easily add such a simple feature to which I reply they've had 6 years to fix their shit so that to me is further evidence that they don't care about anything that doesn't make them money.
---
For me it has to do with getting to play your deck.
---
A match can be fun even when losing, as long as you got to play your cards, made decisions that mattered etc.
---
You get to do that most of the time with aggro and otk, but playing a slower deck against those archetypes can mean dying by turn 4 because you didn't draw a cheap taunt or aoe (vs. aggro) or watching as your opponent plays solitaire, because slows decks often don't have enough early pressure (vs. otk/mill).
---
So for me the frustration of not actually getting to use your deck is greatest with the slower ones. Probably also other reasons for the trend, though. 
---
And RNG minions. Still a virtual carbon copy.
---
It's funny how this combo is still worse than Brawl, because Brawl costs less and can be cast when there's a full board.
---
Seriously,  fuck Brawl.

Hey djuray, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

Why do you lie to yourself? If you want to play fun decks play them, if you want to copy other peoples decks from the internet to win then do that... shit like this post annoys me so much
---
Imagine if it was a bug... it's impossible, because it has worked like that since launch, they'd already changed it.
---
So a regular card game then? 
---
man fuck 16 armor turn 5
---
Exactly 
---
she "net decked" that shit 
---
man fuck warrior
---
You get enough dust from a single golden card to make any same rarity regular card. Therefore, any golden cards you do not use can quickly improve your collection, especially epics and legendaries.
---
However, if you are using a golden card, there is no reason to dust it until you happen to get a regular version from somewhere (pack, end of season reward etc.).
---
So is Scorp-O-Matic
---
I'm convinced that Dr. Boom's Scheme art is incorrect as well. It has no correlation with armor. 
---
Can someone please link me to the video where the guy talksa bout summoning the ancient one but puts a different letter at the start of "ancient" every time. I distinctly remember it but I cant find it whenever I look.  Shit was funny as hell.
---
Did players get a free legendary even without preorder for the boomsday set?   I know that rumble did, and I believe shadows is also doing it,  I started playing after boom was already released so that could be why maybe? 
---
And the rest of the wall is the death knight of gul'dan
---
Haha, well said. Having the same problem. Many times my opponent started playing cards when I was just going to restart the client. Turns out they were just thinking.
---
It'll be the game's first collectible neutral spell.
---
If you buy both the 50 and 80 dollar bundles do you get two different legendaries?  One golden one not,  or the same? 
---
Even on one or two a day. It sucks.
---
I was joking... but I'll work harder on my next joke ;)
---
lmao there isn't enough ram in the world for Chrome.
---
Maybe I'm playing it wrong, but my winrate goes up as a (reno) warlock when i go into fatigue. The deck has enough power you can still push pressure even with dwindling cards, something many other decks struggle with. Especially with siphon life giving board control or face damage 
---
I've found that the quest is more useful as a psychological tool rather than some game winning device.  I've had countless opponents concede on turn two when I play the quest plus coin plus Soularium on my turn one.  If they don't concede then, they will concede on turn six when I play Nether Portal on my turn five. 
---
I love Reno decks because they mean a deck is up to twice as variable than regular decks. Instead of 'Pick the 15-20 strongest cards for this archetype' you have to further consider those that aren't quite as good. And besides, not OTK combo decks with Reno since they're WAY less reliable.
---
Yeah, the double battle flag was my first warrior victory as well.
---
EU 80g Quest trade. I will show you my quest but I'd like you to go first please(check my post history I've done multiple quests here before)
---
Ohliuf#2405
---
It will loose many control cards to help it survive aggo, but still a fun deck
---
Honestly nothing more fun than surprising someone with Reno Hunter. Renolock is a known archetype, Reno Priest and Reno Mage are regular as well, but Reno Hunter? It feels like one of the worst ideas in paper, but it's so fun!
---
Could you post the decklist? Or at least PM me?I have a golden Lakkari Sacrifice that I have been itching to find a deck for, and I didn¬¥t want to craft a very expensive deck if it¬¥s not at least playable (doesn¬¥t have to be meta)
---
Or make Barnes a class card for literally any class expect priest. Or buff his stats to 5/6 and make him a 6 mana cost card. 
---
Another Idea of me was making summoned cards that are 1/1 or 5/5 getting ressed with that kind of stats (but I'm not quite sure if that would even be possible and how it would interact with all the other classes so it might be a really bad idea)
---
This is excellent. I just laughed hysterically and then showed it to two coworkers who didn't understand it at all. That's the kind of quality I'm looking for on this internet site. 
---
Wait, so you kill \*their\* minion and then \*you\* get the two copies of whatever it was? For three mana? Twice?
---
It will indeed, i'm very curious to see how this set and the next will shape the game. We're certainly seeing some cool mechanics and wild is truly becoming wild. 
---
My whole existence is located in the trough of disillusionment. 
---
He has 7 health btw(I'm really bad with taking screenshots)
---
My dragon mind blast priest is winning quite often against big priests and got me to rank 4 last season so I guess you could just play a more interesting priest deck.
---
Don‚Äôt you guys have phones?
---
Well there was a balance patch two weeks after Rasta hit and they did say they wanted to be more reactive. Shit, they released two patches this last expansion.
---
You CAN  summon a bunch of monsters I. One turn. 
---
We said this about Quest Rogue.  But I don't know if it will be that polarizing.  I'm more concerned about Pogo Rogue before Tess Rogue.
---
Dang that‚Äôs crazy considering how long you‚Äôve been playing. Ive been playing since sometime in the Spring of 2015 and I have at least 500 wins with every class except for Mage. I‚Äôm pretty close to getting that one though. 
---
who the fuck would feel bad for someone playing braindead wall priest
---
All it takes is changing the gold reward from wins to games played. If either player concedes before turn 10 the game doesn't count. Suddenly FTP players grinding gold for the next expansion don't feel the need to play an hour of aggro hunter every day.
---
&gt;I'm not going to waste my gold buying packs of anything that's about to rotate out, and I don't know what will end up meta from RR or Boomsday or Witchwood, so basically I'm buying dust with my gold. Inefficient? Absolutely. The whole dust system is brokenly inefficient. Whatever. It is what it is.
---
You can dust new cards too. And there are three sets that are not about to rotate out. And even if you craft every even/odd card in the game, you get 100% of your dust back, and then you can dust them, so that's free dust.
---
Then, there's the fact that you get a free legendary in your first ten packs of every set. Buying packs from the rotating sets and dusting everything is better than buying classic.
---
And finally, remember that you can save up gold for the new set, which will last us two years. Right now, you're basically planning on crafting commons. It's going to end poorly.
---
Your strategy is the most inefficient strategy the system offers. It is strictly the worst possible strategy, with no upside.
---
&gt; craft a decent deck on day one
---
So, aside from the fact that you're planning on crafting commons... You're also planning on committing dust on a day when the meta is 0% stable and you are almost guaranteed to craft the wrong things. *And* you're going to have to craft cards from the past year of expansions that you just don't have. Geeze man, you couldn't have come up with a worse plan.
---
If you want a good deck on day one, your best bet is Zoolock. Nobody will have figured out the trick to control quite yet, and people will experiment with suboptrimal combo decks that can't handle your aggro. It's basically been true early on in every expansion: zoo is the only safe bet.
---
Especially when you start with a kinda aggressive hand
---
Games need to end. 
---
And it's not like everyone will be playing 60 card archetypes. Those cards are very niche and likely will see very little play. Given how much Control gets neutered by rotation, decks need to be able to win.
---
Pretty good with the menagerie buffers
---
The expac launches in less than a week though? And we still have the final stream, dump, and a free legendary Friday to mess with over the weekend.
---
Dunno, I would never play standard.
---
I'd say wait at least 4 hours for all the cards (unless you think none of the remaining 53 will see play.)
---
Just packs from what I saw.  I don't like adventures either 
---
Yeah I love the N'Zoth Reno Hunter he's talking about above. Value decks are so fun when you don't get run over/combo'd.
---
Also that deck has a special place in my heart because my first rank 5 ever was playing against it, same guy 3 games in a row and he realized I was on my game to make it to 5 and auto conceded game 3. Nicest guy on my friends list. 
---
bitterblade#1451 NA 80g trade. I'll show, you go first please
---
I mean yes, but for this to work you need either an empty board + exactly these 5 cards in hand, or only minions with less than 2 health in play. The opponent can always wait for most of these conditions to be met and then play their tech.
---
The state of the game has been the same for about a year. The meta hasn't really changed as the YOM cards have been really strong and these past expansions have done very little in introducing strong cards. This newer expansion however will change the meta pretty strongly. Not only are the op cards being rotated out, Genn and Baku are being rotated out a year early which is only going to create a further change. So if you stopped playing hearthstone around the time it plateaued, then now should be a good time to get back into it.
---
No, you did not. You used it in the same way that people "validly" use the word irregardless, since, you know, according to the dictionary it's a valid word.
---
But keep on dragging the English language through the mud and standing on your soapbox pretending you're being oppressed.
---
YA! THE DOG JAS BEEN SO HUNGRY üòã. THATS WHY IM GONNA FEED YOU TO HIM!!!
---
And burn dust cos they nerf common key card and  leave legendaries useless 
---
Are you positive the Mechathun's deathrattle activates at the very end of all of that?  
---
I know that at the very *end* of the series of events there are no other minions in your hand or deck, but what if it tests for that before it registers that dorian has died or your one card has been discarded?
---
Damn, do you have a spicy updated list for me?
---
Coincidentally - the same amount of health for the current Bloodaclysm combo.
---
Will it summon two from the deck or two random?
---
I think the gold per **win** is a bad incentive. This is basically telling the player base to only play for the win. I think the incentive should be play 3 games in a row, get 10g. If you play 3 games in a row (with like less then a 15 min break between games) win or lose you get gold. This would incentivize me to play more regardless of win percentage. I think it would also incentivize more creative deck building as we wouldn't be more concerned about winning the game but rather just playing the game.
---
My policy is to never dust cards that are not rotating out. Not only can they become viable in future expansions it also is a legendary you will not get when opening future Witchwood packs.
---
That being said, since it is golden it is a free legendary card of your choosing, so it makes it a lot harder decision. 
---
Most if not every combo / otk has an obvious setup turn. It's the nature of the beast. I do not consider this a draw back from wanting to play it. However, bliz printing so many anti combo tools at once is a reason to not play it yet. Lol
---
Toast definitely already watched other streamers open it, saw twitch chat spamming HAMMER SMOrc, and decided he would meme it for twitch chat. I dont think it was out of nowhere.
---
If you're not going to play priest can you at least give me that Tyrande Hero? 
---
Please I need it 
---
BLIZZARD SWITCHIN IT UP
---
\*sigh\* more Mecha'thun OTK. Let's hope the new combo blockers are enough to keep this OTK nonsense in check this time around. Really don't need another 2 years of any form of value absed midrange or value based controll being completely dead.
---
What was his completion time, and did he look up a solution online?
---
You'd have mindless 3min aggro decks even more prevalent than before.
---
You forgot about the Doublespellzerker+bottled lightning combo OTK shaman.
---
30% of the time, it works 100% of the time
---
The Jabberwock does, yes. Carroll actually wrote Jabberwocky before Alice in Wonderland, but he included it in Through the Looking Glass later on anyway.
---
8 mana 34/41...pretty solid value.
---
Okay, hear me out. If Mecha'thun requires your hand to be empty, and Plot Twist shuffles your hand into the deck, Wouldnt you still have a Mecha'thun in hand when Dorian places the 1/1 version of it on the board???? or am I the dumb one?
---
Sent a friend request
---
Well all the main OTK pieces are still here, alk that matters is the draw/Clears needed to get there
---
Now imagine Rafaam.
---
Even a hobbyist ought to know not to make baseless assumptions about a codebase they haven't used, and how long it takes to design, implement and QA a change to an old area of code.
---
This really makes me want to rewatch the videos where Toast scammed wins by playing MTlock but cutting the mechathun.
---
More like 2 mana 4/3 with overload 2.
---
I like the fact that shriek is also discards a card. So it's still possible if you'll have one more card then needed. 
---
With your system you can just auto concede to grind gold. Doesn't sound too good
---
What about the original Mecha‚Äôthun? 
---
Cloudstrife#1676
---
I didn't know that we get first wing for free! That will make my decision easier.
---
Elise would be good. First one or second with random pack?
---
Knew I forgot one.
---
You can't beat the Mal'Ganis boards - the aura effect makes Equality useless so you can pretty much never get a clear. The best way to go about it is to race for the combo as fast as possible - cycle through your deck like crazy, and hope you don't get Ratted. Matchup is super unflavoured for you though, so really the best choice is to play a different deck.
---
I'd like some advice on card advantage. So often when playing by midgame I'm have 4-5 cards in my hand while my opponent has 7-9. And often as a result, they outlast me.
---
How can I better balance using mana efficiently while having better card advantage?
---
I respectfully disagree. While it was fine to have around for a while, playing against Reno Decks can be really damn frustrating and you don't even have to play aggro to feel that.
---
I don't know why you're getting so many down votes. Its true. Maybe if the game really declines in popularity people will only play wild for their DK and other "favorite cards".
---
Shriek will discard it
---
Shadow Madness + 3x Divine Spirit + Topsy Turvy = 10 mana
---
14\*2¬≥ = 112dmg + 3 from the bear in play
---
Could not agree more! Hard to determine if I‚Äôm more excited for the new cards or the ones getting rotated! And Tuesday just happens to be my work from home day :)
---
I don't think u would need an inner fire.
---
Shad mad, 3x divine spirit and Topsy turvy should be 10 mana for 112 dmg, the extra 3 is from the grizz already in play. 
---
They are also unfun to play.  Every time I switch to my aggro decks, I can play maybe two, THREE MAX, games before I don't want to play any more.  I can play control and combo for days until I get bored.
---
Madness, spirit x3 and [[Topsy Turvy]] for 112. Add the 3 from the grizzly to make 115
---
yeah but most of the mammoth cards were really bad and some were extremely meta defining. What i see in this single expansion is that all the cards seem playable at least, not only the legendaries like in KotFT (which were only half of them) and some other cards like cube, this will be the moment were there are the least cards in standard so the power level goes way down and cards that look bad may be better than what we have and most of the cards seem stated well and the ones that aren't may end up completly breaking the game.. I mean.. KotFT had the dk but it also had shit like freeze shaman and a legendary dedicated to that deck... it had a LOOOOOT of bad cards..
---
It took me 108 with paladin lol
---
Nah fuck Reno

---

---
I'm 100% certain that it won't. No other cards pull uncollectible cards unless they're specifically connected to that card. You never Evolve into uncollectibles, you never summon them from Unexpected Results or Jeweled Macaw. 
---
The priest probably OTKed you anyway, and it breaks my heart üò¢
---
Whizbang deserves to be evergreen - allows new players to test and learn all sorts of decks and will never dominate the meta due to premade decks generally lower power level since they're not pro-player refined.
---
How does this work? You still have the 10/10 Mecha‚Äôthun?
---
This is the direct link :)
---
They need to totaly rebalance the classic set. Similar utility across the classes with their own unique mechanics (Druids choosing, rogues comboing, etc.)
---
Pfft. He's nothing compared to Malfurion.
---
Yeah really.... i have a full Premium collection in gwent and so much dust i dont even need to spend money anymore....thats why i moved to hs because i love to spend money i have time for grinding hihi
---
Really, it's the same chance. Khadgar would give you a dupe of each summoned. But I suppose you now have a higher chance that your opponent won't clear them both...
---
can you explain to me how you destroy warrior with thief rogue
---
Who‚Äôs pictured on the left? Rag in human form? (kidding.. kinda)
---
Let me advertice my deck : https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/cntrlwarrior-ros/
---
I don‚Äôt know enough WoW lore to answer that haha
---
If it was, Quest Rogue would have been nerfed for the 3rd time!
---
Maybe 1st Edition Elise, but Un'goro Elise would probably be too confusing for new players (no /s)
---
God no. I was pretty down on Standard when it was announced, and the end of Reno Jackson is one of the things that changed my mind. I despise that card.
---
Come in come and take a seat by the hearth. 
---
If you‚Äôre ftp just save up until Tuesday next week. There‚Äôs a rotation. If you want to play standard then these new cards will be of interest. If you want to play wild. Buy what you feel.
---
Khadgar + Arena Chest + Conjurer's Calling = 2/2 with 4 random 4 drops and you draw 2. Value???
---
Seriously tho, this is a cool card, but unless the Khadgar summoning deck gets more support in the last 40 cards, it seems like just a meme
---
A GAME THEORY!
---
You have my upmost respect. Fork priest!
---
Looks good.
---
Doesn't look like a beast to me.
---
Silence Priest?! WHAT THE FUCK!
---
Interesting. 
---
Depression warning:
---
&gt;!Yeah the other day I'm walking down the street and I'm in so much misery I'm literally saying over and over again to myself "please kill me god please kill me god."  I quit drinking coffee for a few years, and then recently have been bored so started dabbling in black tea and then eventually got back on the coffee train for a few days resulting in that day long misery. So I quit again and after dealing with a day of migraines am stable, so that's good. But yeah I freaking love coffee, so gotta try and get in shape I guess. That'll help.!&lt;
---
*cocks shotgun*
---
Strongest arena legendary of all time. I specify arena because arena ends to disregard synergy since you can‚Äôt count on it and it excludes old gods... You just put Tarim in any deck that doesn‚Äôt have a weird antisynergy with it and it works.
---
Kibler just wants to start playing and Community Manager won‚Äôt let him.
---
Old my Druid heal 
---
Insanely superior to the fungus or naga that do the same thing (at least as far as mana cost).
---
F for Hemet, Junglehunter
---
Well Mage's in WoW do have Time-spells, such as their most notable Timewarp (a raid wide cooldown that increases haste) and probably the more flavourful one in this case Alter Time, which when cast the first time would record your Location, Health, Mana, Buffs and Debuffs and would return you back to that state when cast a second time. (Or After 10 Seconds have passed).
---
Alter Time was removed though at the Start of Legion.
---
Those potions don't *look* strong enough to kill a dragon, let alone a man.
---
If you only open one pack a day, you could probably do it with 120 packs.
---
This is a really good draw engine for priest, simmilar to circle of healing. Also it might be fast enough to enable a few lightwarden decks, especially wild heal zoo

Silence priest is back 
---
Literally only matters to some for dust value I guess, and if you are sitting on 25k in the button then even that doesn't matter.   
---
If I get a terrible legendary as my free one I'm just going to hold onto it til the set rotates anyway so I don't double open and if I get a good one and its not gold, doesn't matter to me.
---
No? Every one where I have to build my own deck is worse. Because that usually gets a meta fast. This one is just a random clownfiesta. The reason why I like brawls.
---
I... wow. I was hoping the neutral cards would have some stuff that fill in archetypes, but heal druid just found an excuse to use POUNCE with this little chickadee.
---
Define an abundance of dust. The way I define abundance of dust, you will not have an abundance of dust from that many decks. It also depends on what you want to play. Some aggro decks are pretty cheap. Something like BSM or Even Pally is very expensive, and unless you got really lucky with your pulls, you'd be running a crappy version of those decks, even if 130 packs.
---
Hey made a well statted creature that broke out to become one of th strongest bosses in its new domain, how is that a failed experiment?

Okay Lich King was a poor example of the point, mainly just saying they could rotate some fair Legendaries into classic to replace HOF‚Äôs

 Feels like it should cost 2 at least...

Good minion for tempo mage.

Insane for inner fire priest, and any other board centric priest tbh
---
Finally, a nice minion to control the board.

So bad Tuskarr Fisherman is rotating out

Honestly Kibler ain't better. He talks about cards too much. I like him but he is a bit annoying.

It's a cube with a random minion instead.. which is so much worse than cube.

I remember kicking ass with an aggro priest back in the day.  Small minions that synergise with healing, like [[Holy Champion]], [[Shadowboxer]] and [[Lightwarden]].  I could do favourable trades with the opponent, and circle of healing and slam them to death on turn 5 or 6.  Nobody saw it coming.  It was super fun.

If you want to play wild you will have to watch out for Baku and Genn. After the Rotation ALL Meta Decks will rotate out, and the Meta will be completly new. Log in the 9. April for free packs.
---
If you have not opened Hearthstone the last months you will get extra packs. 
---
The Adventures of last year gave you no rewards at all. Knights of the frozen throne adventure gives you a free legendary for dust value.
---
Also craft all 9 cards that move in the Hall of Fame for insane Value. If you have the dust, craft them golden because you will get full dust return.
---
But it also cost 3 and doesn‚Äôt need anything else to trigger 
---
This card is insane. 4 2/6 taunt is worth almost 4 mana, so you get an insane deathrattle for only 1 mana. Also its unignorable unlike spider bomb

Priest doesn't care about the deathrattle, this is busted...
---
Looks like the old gods went Kirby on the scourge's big weapon.
---
Strong one. Priest needed new ways to control the board with the scream rotating our 
---
Yes they would. If you spent your turn killing their 3/2 with a card that doesn't make a minion and hits yourself for 4 damage, they will be over the moon.  
---
Aggro often has finishers in the form of charge or burst spells. Every damage you take increases their chance to win.   
---
If there is ever an answer aggro wants to see, spell wise, it would be things like spirit bomb and hellfire.
---
I think people tend to confuse "the cost of playing" with the cost of assembling a complete collection.  A lot of the stuff you read about how the game is so expensive calculates how much you'd need to spend to collect every epic and legendary card, as if your experience is diminished if you don't own all the "content" in the game.  In reality, many legendary cards see little or no high-level play, and so there's no need to have a complete collection - the $50 pre-order every few months, supplemented with extra packs purchased with gold, is likely going to get you pretty close to some "meta" decks and allow you to be competitive.
---
I hate it already. 
---
Dead card against heal druid
---
auchenai synergy
---
Yep they printed a 3 mana 5/6.  More aggressive than Razorleaf but obviously less potential for Divine/Inner combo
---
Very nice! Any new sources?
---
&gt;For example, Barnes could technically be ‚ÄúRecruit a 1/1 copy of a minion from your deck,‚Äù
---
No, it couldn't. **Recruit** on its own means pulling the actual minion, not a copy. Y'Shaarj could be **Recruit**, though (other than the placement of the minion).
---
Tempo Priest ? 
---
Exactly my point.
---
Wild Heal Zoo absolutely loves this
---
**[Convincing Infiltrator](https://i.imgur.com/VFhJeTK.png)**
---
**Class:** Priest
---
**Mana cost:** 5
---
**Attack:** 2 **Health:** 6
---
**Card text:** **Taunt.** **Deathrattle:** Destroy a random enemy minion.
---
Yeah, that card's design was profoundly bad. 
---
Massively, overhelming oppressive advantage that depends on whether or not you draw him early? Check.
---
Does fuck all over half the time? Check
---
Makes and entire cost of minion completely overlooked? That's a big check there.
---
You might want to read the card.
---
Lol.
---
I don't think that means they don't want the Classic set to disappear rather than the sacrifices made by having a constant set of card always be Standard Legal rather than a rotation core set are worth it to the design team.
---
Plus, even in games like MtG with a rotating core set, certain archetypes are almost always present in Standard, most notably mono-Red burn and White Weenie.
---
Seems like silence inner fire priest is an actual thing. Also this has potential in other classes. Reminds me of spirit claws but thats a weird comparison 
---
https://i.imgur.com/sohWhy9.jpg
---
Salt much?
---
That's quite powerful for 1 mana.  I'm not sure where it fits in a competitive deck, but it's got a lot of value and synergy with some new cards that activate on heals.
---
Yes, sir. Dig around in the battle.net app and turn off streaming mode. World of difference. No idea why it defaults to on.
---
healzoolock monkaS
---
god this is genuinely disgusting, this feels like one of the most busted cards in the expansion. -2/-2 and no lifesteal for *4 MANA less*?
---
sure, maybe it won't be the most played card, but it's gonna be super fucking annoying to deal with and I already hate it.
---
This is insane compared to Tortallan guy that only give a friendly +1/+1.
---
Also Obisidian Statue-lite.
---
Greetings.
---
I feel like Ganis is the dude on the right - left guy is looking like he‚Äôs got some elf in him 
---
I own a golden Luna and planning to dust her so I can craft a golden soon to be HOF epic that I don‚Äôt own. I‚Äôll recraft her normal later. I gain 400 dust that way. 
---
They always put the aggro cards a t the very end so all the retards will go AAAAAUUUUUHHHH, CONTROL META an pre order
---
Thanks good sir, I will check this out
---
Oh, that‚Äôs my bad. Didn‚Äôt consider the copy part of it, thanks for the correction!
---
They are still roping every turn...
---
Oh it's "You". Maybe with the Hunt Legendary 
---
I have enough dust to craft 2 glittermoths or 1 golden. does the math work out to not matter?
---
Other classes: Blizzard should compensate for class HoF cards as we have smaller toolkit now
---
Warrior: *Look at Warsong Commander and cry a little*
---
Grrr...MEDIC!
---
REEEEEEEEEEE 
---
We also get the 4 4/7 that doesnt even need to be silenced to smash face. This could be a deck, but losing shadow visions hurts it a lot
---
I'm already mad at this card.
---
Wow.
---
spirit bomb is a pretty awful card with spell stone rotating
---
What's the fastest way to get cards? I really wanna get a decent deck going but I cant manage to get enough cards together so i always end up having crappy cards like the pig or something.
---
You must not have played 2014-15 Hearthstone. Priest without Visions and Scream is a totally different beast.
---
It's got a solid body and might fit a silence Priest sort of deck.  At long stretches the card may be almost dead in your hand.
---
1/1 minion
---
ADVANCE VIGOROUSLY!
---
Why is there a phallus in the background?
---
Baby violet wyrm
---
I like the ideas behind them, but...2/2 demons with rush?  Doesn't seem like much of a payoff to me.
---
Faldorei shuffled the ambushes, not the spooders
---
the burgle one
---
Players:
---
- we hate playing against big priest and resurrect mechanics
---
- drakanoid is OP gives info and gets a copy of a card
---
- Obsidian is annoying and makes you want to play a wide board (agro or mid range) instead of control
---
Devs: "Cool we ignored everything you said because we don't think you matter. In fact we printed more"
---
- More ressurect mechanics
---
- A more powerful version of drakanoid that tells the opponenet 3 cards from your hand and lets you get a copy - which is stronger than cards in the deck
---
- A new obsidian statue that is only 4 mana. This is a 2/6 taunt and destroy a minion. 
---
This will get used in some stupid OTK set up made by someone way smarter than me 
---
Anyone notice there's another card with the same text as this? The 6 mana 5/6 epic demon? Wonder if that's on purpose or a mistake. 
---
Flameweaker
---
kibler was great
---
There is no chance this sees play in a competitive deck. It is a fun card. A great one, but Blizzard never ever intended for this to be a competitive option.
---
&gt; "silence friendly minions" Priest
---
Even with Purify gone, for the legacy of the memes it'll probobly be called Purify Priest.
---
At least in my books.
---
Autodefense matrix is going to cause so much pain with this
---
We need a revision, so here‚Äôs an improvement:
---
üëøIn dalaran I am pimpyüëøin set reviews I was wimpyüëøas minions die my cost gets shrimpyüëøYou guessed it rightüëøI'm jumbo impy
---
I don't think echo'd spells are copied with Krag'wa hence the different phrasing.
---
6/4 summon 4 1/1s is pretty good for board control and token decks. If token druid has space this good be the icing on the cake with Savage Roar.
---
Well it‚Äôs better than Archmage
---
Lol, I already made it to Rank 8 with Quest Shurloc last season, but now that so many key cards are rotating... guess I‚Äôll need to switch to Wild. 
---
Good with Brawl. A bit like Cornered Sentry.
---
Res pools count every card that dies regardless if it‚Äôs the same minion - you will put 7 imps into the pool.
---
2 mana mana reserve(or whatever its called) into turn 3 faceless rager for turn 3 5/6
---
That‚Äôs what he says? I thought it was ‚ÄúMake us fight for the gnomes!‚Äù
---
Would be alright at 6 with double warpath

Nice, finally something for my wild murloc quest deck.
---
What is this from? Lol
---
Not really. I wouldn't play a 4 mana 4/6 taunter and this isnt even as good as that.
---
thanks
---
Yeah, that would work, too.
---
[[Icehowl]] just crying in the corner.
---
Rogue's rushing burgle one, and ancient watcher lights up in silence priest for the first time in awhile.
---
Looks like the meme epic of this set.
---
But that's because of what the ambushes say, it would make sense to me if they had a downside. They are demons after all 
---
Normally such effects work with discounted ones, too. I recently tried it out with [[Helpless Hatchling]] and the Quest.

9/10/10 | Charge Can't attack heroes.  
---
People say this every expansion, but in this case I'm inclined to agree. Most boring expansion on paper since Mean Streets, and quite possibly The Grand Tournament. It's a shame because they've knocked it out of the park since Un'goro (thematically at least).
---
It's been awhile since we've had an actual Warcraft expansion. I hope we get one soon. 
---
And please, no more Dr. Boom! 
---
Yet lose Taunt and 2 health (and magnetic). That's worth like ~2 mana on it's own. A 4/4 Zilliax would *absolutely* be stronger than Argent Commander, not even close.
---
Because it makes sense. 
---
&gt; Well, otherwise it would literally be the only Standard legal Echo card for a whole year. 
---
...No?
---
BLAST WAVE, HERE I COME!
---
Look, I get that people are wrong about cards sometimes. But it legitimately baffles me that people can think that a 10 random card deck is going to pull back anything. Unless both players are running pure removal decks, which they can't with the current card pool, you're just going to lose to any threat. I shouldn't have phrased Nomi as an auto-win, but if you play your cards correctly it's a legitimate win condition. Is it worth running what's a dead card most of the time? Probably not. Is it better than Archivist in the fatigue scenario? Absolutely.
---
There's that infinite combo people wanted with that Heal Druid card all on its own lmao
---
So, quick question, if I'm planning to dust everything from the old sets after they rotate, should i just dust now to craft the hof cards I'm missing? Do I make more profit that way?
---
He shouldn't've could of'd when he could've could've'd.

[[Razorpetal Volley]] for 2 less mana, but for Hunter.
---
Warlock class cards should be weaker than Shaman class cards; especially when you consider the disparity between Life Tap and Totemic Call.
---
Well tar creeper 3 mana 3/5 to 4 mana 4/6
---
It felt like the conversations in between games took a little too long because there was a third person in the room. However, in the actual games themselves, it was just Dean Ayala and Kibler. That went much smoother because a 2-way conversation is naturally going to end much faster and result in less distractions than a 3-way conversation.
---
Because of this, I don't think having a community manager is necessary for these reveal streams. If the streams were about a lot of the in-depth applications of the cards, then having another person could provide more insight. This is why the Omnistone reviews work well. That's not needed in the reveal stream, which is supposed to be more about hyping up the expansion. Talking more and playing less doesn't add up to as much hype.
---
I don't dislike Chris Sierra, and I think he's done a great job for the Hearthstone team. I just think that 2 people more efficient than 3 is for the reveal streams.
---
And here's the rubber band for our mech discovery aspirations. Good, certainly, but not as good as the rest.
---
curves into upgradeable framebot...
---
Archmage with taunt. It actually has an ok statline for a 6 drop taunt, + the added bonus of spelldamage. Its kinda hard to utilize both aspects of this card and it will probably be its downfall.
---
Good pull from the Hagatha Hero, decent as a spell discovery. Probably not a card one would want to run in a deck like Unstable evolution is, but certainly not a bad card
---
Random 4 damage is not great for Shudderwock
---
The synergy with lifeweaver is so good.
---
[Grandpa why would you put this card in your deck?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9QD6sxoJxk&amp;t=76s)
---
Don't forget that they reprinted a more powerful drakanoid operative for this expansion. It's almost like the devs didn't listen to a single complaint and just reprinted all the things people hated. It's terrible - just shows how little they care about players
---
Healzoo warlock lives?
---
thats by far the strongest rager we have seen yet. if you curve afetr 2-3 its already playable, later its insane.

It's so fucking stupid lmao

---
What card??
---
ANOTHER counter for res priest. Thank you blizzard, thank you
---
That's the same kind of shaman quest deck I run when the I get the murloc quest. High five brother from the deep.
---
When the Witchwood Rotates out next year, what other Echo card will there be?
---
Really fun flavor, I like it
---
faceless rager seems like an actually really good card for aggro
---
Overall just solid
---
Otk?
---
It wouldn't have to be that at all, just from all non Standard sets.
---
Fack piller
---
Compare this to healing rain. It‚Äôs so bad 
---
Resto Druid?
---
well, this 100% confirms that I'm going to be rebuilding my imp deck.
---
IMPFERNOOOOOOO
---
Wow, after two turns this is huge
---
Is that an original character in Hearthstone?
---
Token Druid?
---
No
---
reno wasn't the problem it was kazakus
---
everyone was really hyped about reno for a couple years because his existence automatically created tons more t2 and t3 decks that existed in any meta
---
it took them printing a bunch of stupid gamebreaking shit that made people sour on the idea and then they made the same mistake with genn/grey
---
Wild buff paladin with spikeridged steed anyone?
---
Is this the first Textless minion since \[\[Ultrasaur\]\]?
---
A second wave of Murlocs is always a plus in those types of decks. This is even a good card for a potential token Shaman, just to be resilient to AOE
---
It will cost 10, it only takes effect if the demons die while it's in your hand, unlike the other giants.
---
New tar creeper
---
The stream showed *exactly* why schemes suck.
---
Sqadala! We are off!

Hey Onyxia isn't *that* bad.

It's only a 5 mana combo though

Wild zoo still has Malch imp and silverware, heal package isn't worth it there.

‚ô™MY HEART IN MY HANDS‚ô´

I wonder if it‚Äôd be viable in Wild? Maybe with skull/void callers to cheat out a demon?
---
Alabam‚ÄôAkir
---
Not at all if u pass that
---
Maybe. Depends heavily on whether Standard Mech Hunter will care about this kind of draw, or whether they'd be more skewed into the "powerful deathrattle" effect to make cards like Nine Lives more favourable.
---
Same, I want it but I'm not going to craft it. Hopefully I open it.
---
Giggity
---
That's a cool ass elemental Genie.
---
Wild quest shaman has 10 ways to buff a wide murloc boards. 2x bloodfury 2x Everyfin is awesome 2x Gentle megasaur 2x Grimscale 2x warleader. The problem is that getting a wide board vs aggro is hard when you play quest t1 and vs control you getting the board wiped before you can buff em.

That's going to be a Trolden clip: a streamer is bewildered as to why a Shaman just dropped a Tiger on the board.

Where‚Äôs all the dragons this expansion to reign in the year of the dragon? :(

Lol
---
Wa... Warsong Commander? Is that you?
---
Because gruul is so powerful you can only run 1 so you need something else too for consistency.
---
Warsong commander died for this
---
Pyro blast!
---
Would have been busted if it worked with Doomhammer. As it stands, unless they give shaman a Boomship type card, (Al'akir, Whirlwind Tempest, Cauldron Elemental for 20 damage) there is no way this ever sees play.
---
Maybe it's not oppressive by your definition, but I'll return to a question I asked earlier:
---
\&gt;Do you want to have fun? or play boring kingsbane/odd warrior/evenlock?
---
extending this to anyfin, or jade
---
Maybe having fun in a game is overrated? 
---
But I for one don't like playing against a deck with every boardclear in the game that hasn't been dealt with in any balance changes
---
you mean crazed alchemist(i think this is the only one version of this effect shaman as access to)
---
Not using weapon art matching the one on mysterious challenger was a real missed opportunity. 
---
I always just "That's what agin say" Don't ask me what that means, but that's what I hear...
---
It's because the downside is more universal than the upside. 
---
* You can't play cards that benefit from spell damage but aren't spells.
---
* You can play spells that don't deal damage
---
there's a lot fewer elementals than beasts, especially post-rotation. This will be (along with celestial emissary) the cheapest elemental mage can play, which is useful for triggering those elemental effects.
---
of course, elemental decks will also just be kinda mediocre going into post-rotation, so really the point is moot.
---
Eh, I dunno about inner fire priest, but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if this saw fringe play somewhere.
---
[[Kobold Geomancer]] has shown up in decks from time to time (rare but it happens).
---
Right now nobody runs kobold geo cause they run [[Spellshifter]] if they want a 2 mana spell damage card beyond Thalnos.  Or [[Tainted Zealot]].
---
Zealot is rotating out, and this looks better than spellshifter to me.
---
Most decks won‚Äôt want a 0/6, but if a spell damage deck exists and if it wants more 2 drop spell damage sources, it probably runs this card.
---
Wild big priest only getting good stuff yay
---
Oh lordy....
---
I could go in right now...but I will refrain myself. 
---
"People down the line would be like what is this echo effect"
---
If people can't do a little research or reading they DEFINITELY shouldn't be playing a CCG. And yes I called it a CCG because this is no TCG. 
---
I instantly thought that this goes face, the same way you pyroblast in hand will go FACE
---
A whole new world.....
---
thats kinda suiciding your knife juggler, you can clear at best 5 imps, assuming he doesnt hit face even once, so still at least 2 imps survive and can trade into it. there are much better combos with knifey than that
---
Except when they got rid of Enrage they printed more Enrage cards.
---
Notably doesn't look like the Scargil model in WoW
---
Roll tide
---
Yeah, but I don't know whether its effect isn't too powerful with Ice rager. At least we won't see this op combo in standard...

Yep, it's arguably the best hunter deck in wild, and this helps address its main weakness of lacking refill

---
Fixed
---
I'm going to fucking hate this card. 
---
First impression: Whoa! That's powerful!
---
After thinking about it: this might save 1 or 2 mana. Murlocs suck.
---
My meme dream for this card is slapping this and Rocket Boots on that 4 mana 5/3 pirate that draws  2 cards when you overkill.
---
Kill 3 things and draw 6 cards.
---
Im gonna stop playing wild for now simply because baku and Genn got hof'd. Stupid ass boring cards that invalidate so many decks.
---
There is a small $10 for 10 pack.

---
Holy shit. Did you really just put up a question mark. Am I being too wordy or something ? 
---
Them not continuing keywords is un-ethical. In every way, and if you disagree you are a mindless individual.
---
Sneaky Devil is my most hated card in RandomDeckBrawls...   
---
But in ranked this card is close to useless i thought.  
---
I‚Äôm talking about wild. I didn‚Äôt even think standard had a mech hunter anyone cared about
---
That's how Krag'wa already works with Echo cards though?
---
Sorry dude. I didnt read you last comment because after the first few words I recognized that it is insulting and very very boring and stupid.
---
So I really have no clue what you said and cant answer to it. End of the discussion. Bye.
---
kingsbane rogue isn‚Äôt really that good against control decks like it was before. in wild, it‚Äôs more like a super all in aggro deck that tries to buff up the weapon super fast and rush you down with pirates. they typically lose when they run out of cards or ways to get kingsbane. they lose super hard to aggro paladin decks and decks with lots of good taunts like odd warrior. 
---
This video got 1st out of 350 pieces at an art on 04/03/19 lmao
---
Thank you for reminding me about that gem of a video!
---
Geez if only, looks like we get to do murlocs again
---
True, there is some good stuff. Agro also doesn‚Äôt look to be as aggressive and instead more sticky, which is easier to endure with our many spells. Also I could see the new Portal demons being good in a Shudderwock deck, helping you keep your board full.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to build a Dragon Secret/Elemental Midrange Paladin/Shaman deck üôèüèº
---
Can't fint the info about it, and don't remember from previous expansions, but is the pre-order available all the way until the date of release, or is it unavailable sooner?
---
BEWARE OF THIS CARD AND STONETUSK BOAR!!! IM WARNING YOU ALL NOW!!!
---
&gt; Them not continuing keywords is un-ethical. In every way, and if you disagree you are a mindless individual.
---
The question mark is because you evidently don't know what "ethical" means.
---
Holy shit, did you really just use the word "ethical"? 
---
Why yes, you're being too wordy for your own good. Because you're chatting bollocks rofl.
---
Happens to all of us :)
---
I do tend to agree that this is relatively unlikely to see play, but who knows? Including 2 bad combo cards in a deck could be a sound decision.
---
They made a joke and you're mad about it for some reason
---
But muh right to see titties! /s
---
They've proven they like this mechanic, make Echo and Recruit evergreen keywords.

The new warlock card Darkest Hour also has recruit.
---
I wasnt around back in the "who am I" or the tunnel trogg era but in this case the prerequisite is playing a secret turn 1. Think it'll stilll snowball as hard?
---
This + Mad Summoner wombo combo. 
---
More to come but we got a few and we have some from last year too.  
---
oh rully?
---
\[\[Da Undatakah\]\] will not summon itself with his deathrattles, but another 8/5 on board is nice!  
---
what if muckmorpher morphs into a muchmorpher
---
I won't deny this is a really interesting card, that gives a lot of opportunities for Rogue players in wild. 
---
What i am confused about is why is this a commoin card? I thought common cards were meant to be easy to understand cards for newer players. This seems more like an epic card
---
Also discoverable from omega assembly. Also has Rush with Dr Boom and discoverable with his HP. Sick sick sick.
---
Oh goody*

---
8/8/5 | Battlecry: Gain the Deathrattle effects of 3 friendly minions that died this game.  
---
This card is the flavor opposite of Dr. Boom's Scheme.
---
If like past sets, until the servers go down to update the new expansion on April 9th.
---
*earrape*
---
If your have your Knife Juggler on the board, all the opponent's imps will be dead. 
---
if I was a new player I could read the tooltip that pops up when i mouse over the card and not be confused.
---
and as a new player, I would not know that it was a new keyword that was added 2 expansions ago since I just got here.
---
Would've been really nice to see this with a Deathrattle...
---
*got nerfed for this
---
Sometimes... I forget things.
---
Also with a board full of imps you could make the new Jumbo Imp card cost 3. 
---
So I'm guessing you aren't a Tavern Brawl player? Because we occasionally get deck constructing brawls that use the Wild format.
---
Wild is super fun for some ppl but you would want early cards like from naxaramus and gvg
---
r/ofcoursethatsathing
---
&gt; You're so ignorant and mindless you are arguing about a word...that was used properly
---
I can stop reading here rofl.
---
Keep getting yourself salty and riding that high horse of... well, not knowing basic English rofl.
---
Cheerio! 
---
I love the completely out of proportion attention this one card is getting. I know it‚Äôs mostly a meme about card text inconsistencies, but some people seem genuinely bothered. 
---
omg!!! 
---
Token-Murloc- Shamen!!!!
---
Rafaam would nuke this card too. You can‚Äôt combo it.
---
Congrats! Haven't done that myself yet
---
In wild this can be an otk. Play sheme then this and summon a bunch chargers like devilsaur, doomguard and argent commander
---
I think you‚Äôre forgetting that this is the ultimate follow-up to T2 Coin + Am‚Äôgam Rager
---
I still can't believe they got the balance on that card so wrong. Even nowadays it's still an insane deck against Control.
---
Wow, it‚Äôs like knife juggler but objectively worse!
---
Listen carefully: Raid Leader, this card, Shaw.
---
A constantly-resummoning Rush minion that can take out your opponent‚Äôs board.
---
How‚Äôs that for control?
---
FUNNY IMP-lications INDEED!
---
Hunter card‚Äôs this expansion are super bleh
---
if it's turn 8 you could try to fit in the 2 mana spell damage +1 minion for 30 damage on turn 7+8. Probably pretty hard to pull off though
---
This is the card for all those wild murloc lovers and brilliant for quest completion as well. And let's face it, with murlocs, it's never just a 4/4.  I'll give it a  perfect 5/7,  murloc love craft confirmed.
---
Every last one! I'm still going through the last commons
---
Well, 4 mana +2/+2 would be nuts.
---
The new secret and get down are really good with this in the early game. Basically immunity to the first attack and/or first spell
---
THE FROST BOOBS STAND READY.
---
I didn't consider wild, and I was informed that windfury is viable card in some wild even shaman decks. So this maybe added as a sort of finisher. After all itll be only 1 bad card meant for burst. 
---
Tho it doesn't seem like leeroy where its 5mana 6burst dmg no pre-conditions. But in a deck that manages to get a big body to live until late game, then the 10mana combo could work, assuming windfury was not used on something else.
---
wait that "combo" does absolutely nothing.
---
Not really. Mage has gone from combo, to aggro, to control based on the flip of an expansion. So has warrior. So has Druid. So has Warlock. So has Paladin. So has Shaman. Only a few classes have really been limited like rogue and priest. 
---
Quest Rogue: 2 Boars/Deckhands and 2 Escapes is 24 damage for 8 Mana.
---
This is me
---
Recruit is dead though. All the new cards say ‚ÄúSummon a copy‚Äù which has different applications.
---
Correct. I can usually get a win with a meta desk to get the pack.
---
Well, you tried
---
ahhhh I see...you support Activision. 
---
Damn cash grabbing ignorant children.
---
Awful content and can't even be consistent in their wording.
---
You're the kind of person who like world quests huh?! HHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
[removed]
---
r/fucktron is leaking
---
How did they not print more good neutral dragons/heal cards, dragon pally and heal druid is dead on arrival. 
---
No, the new 1 mana 1/1 isn't gonna make crystal stag or lucentbark good. Here are good heal cards you are happy to put in your deck, the new 1 mana spell, zilliax and dreamway guardians spell(most of the time wont heal 5 lets be honest). How many shitty cards are you putting in your deck to make them work, healing touch? earthen ring farseer? the new 3/2 with divine shield? You can't tell me this sounds like a remotely good deck.
---
This is just semantics. The priest is restoring health. The druids health is restored. Since Lucentbark says "Restore 5 Health", either should satisfy. 
---
Murloc is going to be broke
---
Not a good quest rogue card. At best a 1 of but even for that I dont know what people would drop. Quest rogue has no problems finishing the quest in wild.
---
Murloc shaman will live and you will like. Just wait until stormbringer on a full board and get 7 hireeks
---
Doesn't her heropower just give mega-windfury?
---
If you play this against Big Priest, couldn‚Äôt they just Psychic Scream it and ruin YOUR deck?
---
I agree. I started playing from day one but took a 2 year break so I'm missing a lot of good legendary s.
---
Wow... I am disappointed at the lack of Lackey cards. I thought it would be more prevalent... but each of the villain classes only have 2 cards that generate Lackeys (one of which is neutral). 
---
I think it is such a cool concept, and I know there will be more with future expansions... but this is hardly "setting a tone that will last 3 expansions". This is the same as when they give us a card with an ability that later becomes a keyword. Right now it is just a hint... not a key mechanic :(
---
&gt; If that was true they wouldn't print the card. 
---
Oh no, Blizzard has never went overboard with the battlecry effects on cards and had to errata it later...
---
Hey mod.
---
Flair was added before you commented. BYE
---
\^this
---
wtf is this flavour?  "i love defending people.  oh look there are people here to defend, im gong to try less hard now."
---
That‚Äôs not very good tho. Why would you give your opponent 5 free turns to develop the board and do nothing, they would win every time 
---
&gt; Mage has gone from combo, to aggro, to control based on the flip of an expansion.
---
Uh yes. All of which facilitated by amazing Mage Spells in Classic and Basic.
---
If you can't see how Classic has a big influence on archetype, I just don't know what to say to you. Yes, *obviously* expansions impact how classes play. That doesn't change what I said at all, rofl.
---
I would love if anybody who thinks this card should say echo, would go and try to get into Eternal. If you haven't played it, it has like 30 different mechanics. It's stupidly difficult to keep track of what each one does, especially when they're slightly different from similar keywords in hs/magic. Aegis? It's Divine shield. But also for spells. But only certain spells. I think? Actually, I forget. Endurance? It's like vigilance (from magic). Oh, but it can't be stunned. What is stunned? It's like frozen. But not. Warcry? It gives the top minion of your deck a buff. What if it's 3 cards down? It works. Oh, it buffs weapons too. Just relic weapons, or all weapons? I don't even remember anymore.
---
Adding too many keywords to the game genuinely does make the game really difficult to approach. Yes, I know we all know what echo does around here. And yes, one keyword is probably not going to make or break that much. But there's a line to be drawn somewhere, and this is where that line gets drawn, apparently.
---
If you want the Spell Damage to survive behind another taunt, one might claim that the Taunt is a debuff.
---
It totally makes sense for Taunt to be free. Whether or not a minion has it should not effect the cost.
---
I'm not sure this pun is good enough to miss obvious "Giant Imp" name for this card.
---
0/10 troll.
---
real talk, i hate malygos
---
Even Shaman would‚Äôve loved this. It summoned a lot of Spell Damage totems but had no damaging spells
---
5 mana do nothing on board. If you have the luxury of playing this in quest rogue you would never lose the game to begin with.
---
[[Upgradeable Framebot]]
---
Heck yes it will work. Taz nozwhisker with lab recruiter or scheme will be nuts
---
I agree. Hadronox. Gonk is a gimmick. Tank up... mecha... maly... nah poor druid! 
---
Another example... Imagine a drink like Magic Caffeine that heightened your senses. Taking a sip lets you hear further, see clearer, feel wind changes, and perceive things quicker. If you take five sips you can see wind paths, see every flap of a hummingbird wing as if it was slow motion, hear the capillaries open and close in your veins like soft drums.
---
Now say you drank 100 of these at once. A single second turns into an eternity. You are a million, million years trapped in your own mind. Unable to speak. Unable to stop anything. Unable to move because your perception views a Planck Time as days unending.
---
[[Call in the finishers]] plus this makes for a very nice board.
---
Thijs was asking for this card today, not even kidding ahah 
---
the other shaman murloc minions/spells look like they are trying to make a sticky board swarming deck viable
---
We are going to need more mechs
---
I thought it was "Thanks for the entrance!"

2/1/5 Mech  
---
With combo, you play any minion with 6+ attack on the board one round, and then add windfury and this card the next? Other buff effects, taunts, etc. 
---
Like I said, this is a Combo card IMO. It helps with some innate windfury, but you can have a minion do 4 times the damage in one turn with this and the windfury card in the same turn. 
---
Whether you see it as jank or not, I still see viability in its burst, and a 3 card combo isn't too bad. 
---
I want to pre order too!  The new expansion looks great.
---
What stops me is that I've preordered before so I know just how disappointing and little 50 packs can be.  It's simply not worth 50 bucks.  I wish they'd provide a deal that felt better, but they don't seem interested.
---
Not only must more minions die, it is also only your minions and you have to keep a 10 mana card in your starting hand for turn 4 or 5 plays. It also have to be demons, not just good aggro minions like in paladin decks. 
---
Rafaam's Scheme is pretty bad.
---
Probably isnt tbh.
---
When I first started playing, Ravenholdt Assassin into windfury was a staple combo in my shaman deck.
---
It specifies ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. 
---
Imagine a rogue playing on curve building a 13 damage kingsbane. 
---
Is there a spreadsheet yet with everything typed out for ease of reading/search?
---
i fn love all the new murloc synergy
---
&gt;Anything specific to the game that would make that a logical statement? Or is it solely just a way to give you something to work towards
---
[It's not from a game, as far as I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_FQU4KzN7A&amp;feature=youtu.be).
---
Still. At one point you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about buying any more pre orders. IMO if you spend 130$ in the game then you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry for the next expansions from that point onwards. 
---
That only effects 1 minion
---
Shouldn't have been friendly minion so I can play it against taunt cards on the board too
---
Then you have too much morpher.
---
Morgl wants to your location.
---
Are you serious?!?!? Making a deck with more options never makes it worse, extra redundancy and double dipping on 4/4 charges will be as ridiculo as  the old shadowstep leeroy. Now imagine it for up to 9 charge minions
---
Murlocs are always going to be in the game. If there's any class I'd want them to push the murloc tribal synergy into, it's Shaman.  Let's forget Murloc Paladin ever existed.  
---
It is very similar when played from hand, however the card saw the most play in decks that found ways to "cheat it out" negating the downside of it's Battlecry. Rush would retroactively hurt the card pretty badly, so I think that's why people are so against that particular change. 
---
However \[\[Ice Howl\]\] is a card that would become objectively better from Rush, and seemed to be designed with the same idea in mind. Being able to attack minions right away, but not push OTKs. 
---
Why do people keep assuming I‚Äôm talking about standard when mech hunter isn‚Äôt even an archetype anyone uses in standard?
---
It's too early to see your downvotes so I can't speak to that.
---
I think every minion having a chance to have windfury with the 2 mana spell is what makes this card a solid win condition. 
---
This seems fun and interactive
---
Quest rogue isnt too slow, its not the best but if you play it well its legend viable. That being said 5 mana do nothing is too slow for quest rogue in wild.
---
He‚Äôd revive as lucentbark
---
If you are playing warlock, and your dream in life is to cheat out an 8/8, then just play control and run mountain giants. Having said that, I think he support is there to reduce the cost, but not until so late in the game that an 8/8 isn't that impressive anymore. The advantage of these 'giant' type cards is getting them on the board during an early turn when you shouldn't have the total mana to play something that big, not a later turn where it's just cheap but on par with other minions you could play for your total mana pool.
---
Extra good in Shaman and Druid.
---
Yeah, there's plenty of real power creep in hearthstone - but this is not it. However, it's fun to joke about.
---
That‚Äôs actually a huge fear of mine after that black mirror episode, where they put the girls consciousness in a sort of mini avatar that can be controlled like an app, when she refuses to do chores they poof her away to basically the void and make seconds last years. Fuck that hah.  But yeah that makes sense I suppose I never really thought about it very much haha
---
Read in my head as ‚ÄúMagic Fart Dog‚Äù.
---
Holy crap, this is busted (were it not for Standard rotation).
---
potion seller. i need a potion.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Nope you just get one back if it's echo, you might be thinking of [[Unstable Evolution]] but that card does not have echo.
---

1/-/- | Transform a friendly minion into one that costs (1) more. Repeatable this turn.  
---
&gt;  they **already want to run**
---
Yeah, taking beloved legendaries and placing them in the classic set sounds like the best option for most people
---
Also, importantly, Witches Brew doesn't buff Mistwraith when cast.
---
BTW if you can't tell I only play ranked. Usually finish rank 5-4
---
Its time to bring back my wild patron hunter.
---
Not really a good comparison because of the Mana cost. It's definitely good in any kind of zoo or token buff deck because other things can be played with it.
---
What do you mean, you play rafaam and then on a later turn you play the scheme and this card for a bunch of legendary minions
---
Dies to the Black Knight, not necessarily better! 
---
*Ooooooh that is really bad for us! That's really bad for us!*
---
Calling it now, this guy will have the best battlecry quote of the set. 
---
this only happens for hall of fame right? not for wild cards rotating out normally cause i could swear they did that one year unless im mistaking i for this
---
I always heard, *error joke not found*
---
If an expansion can completely flip the best deck of a class from aggro to control, then clearly their classic set was not that influential. My point is that the classic set will be more influential than normal due to the limited number of expansions and their relatively lower power level compared to past expansions. 
---
I'm not wrong. This isn't really a debate. You are arguing with me and getting yourself confused about what the word archetype means for no good reason than to troll me or what? I don't know. 
---
Oh boy do I love me some Deal 2 damage and summon 2 1/1 imps
---
Good blastwave card and decent for spells that are 6-9 Mana. 
---
It's simple, you play Barnes, pull out a blood of the ancient one.  Bring him back, play him again, pull out another blood of the ancient one.  Summon the BANcient one.  Give it windfury and then megawindfury the next turn.  Easy 120 damage.
---
Rafam's curse + this + Blood of the Ancient Ane in the deck = 99-99 worth of states! IT'S GOLD JERRY!
---
If control warrior is going to be a thing after rotation, it will definitely play this card.
---
Heck, I think this might be the Giggling Inventor of the set.
---
Wow that works. Nice.
---
Why does Blizzard REFUSE to be consistent with Hearthstone.
---
Even when they attempt to make things more consistent, they often arbitrarily leave stuff out.
---
The worst part is they refuse to talk about it, or even listen to players suggestions on ways to make the game more consistent and new player friendly.
---
He didn't touch me really prior, he used a battle cry to reduce health...he killed me from when my health was set at in 1 turn, I think it counts 
---
Would be a pretty neat micrometa^tm
---
Bomb Warrior
---
Big Warrior
---
Imp Warlock
---
Murloc Shaman
---
Mecha'thun Hunter
---
Probably nothing is playable... and game is dominated by some shitty cheese deck.
---
This is what happens when Papa Faceless loves Mamma Rager too much, I guess.
---
On the other hand if they would have given out more with this expansion they wouldn't release that much more over the year. 
---
Thank you for the awesome reply, that's really kind of you ! When are the other expansion packs than Kobolds and Catacombs going to leave the shop? I only have enough gold for a pack right now and I'm wondering if I'll be able to earn some and buy a couple from these expansions. 
---
Think this might be the only expansion where I tech in more than a single silence. Some of these cards are fucked. 
---
Shovefist!
---
You just tried to compare eternal keywords to hearthstone and magic keywords... if you play eternal you know exactly what Aegis and Endurance and Entomb and Killer do...
---
Yes they have a lot more but they‚Äôve also pumped out more cards with unique effects and don‚Äôt tend to reuse more than a few core mechanics each expansion. Not the same thing as Echo since Echo keeps getting reused as ‚Äúrepeatable this turn‚Äù.
---
It's simple, you play Barnes, pull out a Blood of the Ancient One.  Bring him back, play him again, pull out another Blood of the Ancient One.  Summon the BANcient one.  Give it windfury and Whirlwind Tempest the next turn.  Easy 120 damage.
---
Those are all the youtube highlights you see that happen once every 100 games. Yes deckhand combos would be insane, but:
---
A) You imply that the quest is finished and you are not completely behind on board against taunts, AND you had the chance to fill your hand with deckhands. Sure then this card seems good, but in that situation does quest rogue ever lose?
---
B) Can quest rogue afford to destroy the little board it had against a hoard of agro decks?
---
C) What can quest rogue cut in its current deck to put this in? You need to realize wild quest rogue does not even run mimic pod which is much more flexible than this card. 
---
It looks good at first sight (similar to new 3/6 resummon this minion if it has 4 attack card) but in reality if these cards are ever in a situation where they are going to get value, chances are you would win the game anyways.
---
Seriously though, Token-Zoo warlock with This, Mountain Giant, the 2 mana egg, grim rally, rafaam's scheme, hell unironically even imp-losion
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they've never printed a one-mana card with an insane effect either, so we're all good!
---
Cool mine is [[Crushing Walls]]
---
It's a 100 dust on average including legendaries and golden legendaries, but the median pack dust value is 40.

7/-/- | Destroy your opponent's left and right-most minions.  
---
I think sticking a six-attack minion is fairly reasonable. It shouldn't be your only wincon, but as a two-card combo that you can throw in a lot of decks for an instant win, it is probably at least playable. 
---
He said wild, not standard
---
Murloc Shaman was actually never horrible. Quest Murloc Shaman on the other hand....
---
It should, based off the wording.
---
It was definitely played in N'zoth decks, just because it was the only "decent" deathrattle with taunt at the time, if you werent a Paladin
---
Oh yea your right, I completely forgot about that. 
---
To be fair, it happens in an anime then the guy stabs the 'super sense' person to kill him. It briefly goes to the super potion guy's internal monologue where he's lost track of the years and begs for the blade to finally kill him.
---
#LOOKS LIKE TEAM ROCKET IS BLASTING OF AGAINNNNnnnn
---
Rafaam replaces your hand and deck, which includes the scheme and this card 
---
I don't think this is a good card, but you have to realise there's a draw card with the whole token beast package that's considered a great play *on curve*. It's really not that far out there.
---
They should replace the art intentionally for treants on hallow‚Äôs end. Looks kinda cool.
---
I mean... if this is how much we will get with each expansion... then by the time we get the third expansion it will be a "keyword".
---
This is pathetic in terms of something they wanted to be dominant. I am not asking for a thousand more cards here. But more than 2 for each class and maybe a few more neutrals would have been great. Imagine how interesting the game gets when Lackey's become more prevalent with each expansion. I don't think it would hurt to just try it out. Would definitely make for more minion focused boards.
---
I actually agree a lot with you there.  
---
I appreciate the fact that he said in the beginning how they've read the feedback and will be implementing it right this very stream.  
---
Him being there to guide a game designer and content creator while they can focus on enjoying and explaining the new cards actually seems like a really nice role to fulfill.  
---
Obviously this didn't go as well as the first stream but this stream he did a lot of nice things like going over the cards again and keeping some conversations between games short so we can see another game.

---
Mulligan for Malchezaar's Imps and anything that has a benefit when discarded. Sometimes I like to keep Cataclysm for turn 4 so I can immediately play the quest portal on the next turn. You'll more than likely draw discard cards in your next few turns. Most of your discard cards are 1-3 mana single discard effects. 
---
The soonest possible turn to get your portal out is turn 5, and do it if you can (Cataclysm). You can feel your opponent scurrying to keep up with the imps being shit out every turn. 
---
I tried to make this deck fair against most matchups. I only have problems with Barnes Priest. 
---
Demonwrath (x1), Hellfire (x1), Felfire Potion (x1)? I had the portal's imps in mind for the Demonwrath. The imps are demons so they survive after you cast it. Hellfire and Felfire Potion are good both for board clears and obtaining lethal. 
---
Your creatures are meant to be expendable, so dont be afraid of trading your infinite 3/2s!

It's generally a bad idea, within reason, to be self casting your discard effects instead of discard casting them. *Sometimes* you need to self cast Fist of Jaraxxus to clear something for lethal or whatever. But because you need to maximize the value of your already big statted discard effect minions, you want to keep your discard casts in your hand for when you inevitably draw your discard minions. For example, you have 2 Silverware Golems, 1 Fist of Jaraxxus, and 2 Succubus in your hand. When you play your Succubus, you have a 75% chance of a valuable discard. Keep thinking like that and different ways to increase your odds throughout the game. Sometimes it's a bad idea to tap first! 
---
What happens if you draw Cataclysm and Deathwing late? Usually I've gotten a couple copies of legendaries in my hand by that point. So not only so you clear the board, you usually get extra value and a few Jekliks added to your hand. 
---
If you have Soularium, cut a Succubus for it.
---
Can't think of any more tips for now. Good luck!
---
I thought haunted creeper and Amani berserker were good alternatives to thalnos
---
I think i see a slight problem with your plan.
---
Probably not.  There aren't that many good 5+ spells around that you'd want to keep in your hand.  We will have to see if there is any spell bonus applied to the new Arena.
---
Do you understand the game at all?
---
When did the battlecry trigger by summoning a minion?
---
Aight cool.
---
The new 0 mana evolve spell + new Hagatha might bring this guy out for some fun highlights.  Other than that, I doubt it'll see much constructed play unless a good cheat card comes out.
---
Still fucking garbage...
---
*laughs in Ticking Abomination*
---
Okay imagine mech hunter but better at spam and usable in a class with good card draw. Murlocs are already aggressive and being able to drop 2-3 more murlocs if you have them is enough to close off the midgame where your opponent would otherwise stabilize
---
Actually if you silence a doomsayers on 2 it would be a 3 mana 5/7
---
For now...
---
how old are you?
---
Read the card maybe?
---
if you're at a place where you can stick a board of treants, you should just savage roar for the win. This card is laughably bad when savage roar and even power of the wild exists. 
---
They said they're going to add more lackey support cards over the next 2 expansions, AFAIK
---
So new players will have to learn every keyword ever made and not just the already abundance of evergreen keywords ?
---
Why does it matter?
---
Oblivitron Mecha'thun tasty
---
Too bad Warrior wasn't playable for a good chunk of the year of the mammoth.
---
you dont know the potion seller....
---
Zap o matics attack sound is: WHEEEEEEEEE!!!
---
RAID LEADER? In a deck that doesnt have 7 minions out at all times and is hit with a significant deck limit mechanic? Thats a no from me
---
Such a perfect specimen
---
It was viable at various points throughout the Year of the Mammoth, even into 2018.
---
Ok?  This is fucking retarded, it's not funny
---
I could see this being moderately interesting with evolve mechanics.
---
GRGRGGuggHghuGHh
---
I thought it'd be $10 for 9 packs and an arena ticket?
---
I really like the current mind blast priest for this reason. I always feel like I am on the edge of losing, until I end up winning the game.
---
They would never make Wiz Bang a classic card, you can‚Äôt milk returning players for $$ if they can just craft Wiz Bang to play the new cards for free. 
---
There will likely be more throughout the year.
---
Can copy be silenced, or is it permanent?
---
So a Norzdomu mode?
---
So it should say "this minion" whereas "you" sounds like it is referring to you, the player/hero.
---
It's good enough at 2 mana. Rocket boots is objectively worse.
---
31.12.1999
---
Well ddeathrattle doesnt activate
---
No, sorry. I just misunderstood your comment.
---
Erh ..Mad Summon + Darkest Hour?
---
EZ 100 Dust 
---
honestly there comes a point where you reach a critical mass of minions that need silence, once you have a deck that has enough of those silence becomes meaningless.
---
You know here it would have been totally fine to word it "can attack 4 times" instead of rehashing an old keyword...
---
[[Black Knight]]
---
[[Shieldbreaker]]
---
[[Spiked Hogrider]]
---
Alabama man! 
---
Correct
---
what is your definition of fun? you are saying that 6 of the top decks in wild are unfun. no one is forcing you to play a top deck if you think they are all boring, but in all card games a few strategies will be superior to the rest. 
---
personally, i think winning with an explosive combo is fun, that‚Äôs why i play anyfin paladin right now. i think it is situated well in the format, at least until even lock started to rise in popularity. the next deck i‚Äôm going to try will be mind blast priest. 
---
IT'S A VANILLA CARD JAJAJAJAJA
---
o no
---
So it becomes a two card 10 mana dragonfire potion + add a few spells to your hand.
---
Yep I would do that to look more like an undead than pirate. But Idk It¬¥s not up to me.
---
This will be scary in wild 
---
Does it work with reduced cost cards?
---
That still leaves a 3/1 on the board since it survived the flamestrike there would be a copy.

The original freeze mage had an OTK that would do 30 damage with an Emperor Thaurusen discount on the burn spells. But, it‚Äôs standard win condition was Alex one turn, do 15-20 damage the next turn. It‚Äôs just the difference between a two turn combo an an actual one turn kill like Mecha‚Äôthun or Hakkar-Toggwaggle

---
You're 100 percent right, it's just awkward since this card itself is named Sweeping Strikes
---
It crazy outclasses the old 5 drop classic card that does this to.
---
Not worth it imo 
---
Just for Hall of Fame. We haven't ever got refunds for non-Hall of Fame cards transitioning to wild.

It also let's them run silent watchers for taunt / silence to survive aggro or be aggro.

#MEGA WINDFURY ON THE ZANCIENT ONE
---
Thanks Obama
---
ok thank you 
---
I even use Cho in spell based decks with success.
---
Came here knowing that the top comment would be a pun comparison to either knife juggler or flamewaker.
---
That's actually a really good point. Could just be "Give a minion Sweeping Strikes"
---
Because in a years time someone shouldn't have to know a keyword that only applies to one card in Standard.
---
I‚Äôm disappointed with lack of dragons it‚Äôs called year of the dragon but barely any dragons I don‚Äôt get it 
---
Would have to be three apprentices because frostbolt would cost (3) with tricaster down.
---
Do they have windfury in addition to mega-windfury?  
---
But why?
---
That implies there are at least 14 other cards that fit into that already...
---
*Laughs in inconsistency* 
---
Should we tell him / her?
---
What. No. Not even close to balanced. Why are there upvotes
---
So Paladin gets decent dragon support and there's nothing to support that in the neutral set?  Bollocks.
---
Best case Scenario would be [[Leeroy Jenkins]], 2x [[Reckless Rocketeer]] and 2x [[Argent Commander]] + 2 other minions for at least 24 damage, if you have Grim Rallye you would be at at least 29 at a 10 mana 3 card combo. 
---
It will be picked more than silverback in arena that‚Äôs for sure
---
Put this in a rez priest deck. Maybe some divine shield/spirit action going on. Could get ugly. Expensive so maybe not good but when it works, I bet it will be very frustrating to your opponent.
---
That‚Äôs legit Teddiursa and Ursaring 
---

Hm? No, this is great for wall priest (in whatever iteration it will appear in once Lich King rotates). Silence your Grizzly, summon a second Grizzly, then res them both later on for some fat 3/12s. 
---
Catrina is directed to the Day Of The Dead, a holiday that immediately follows Halloween and is celebrated mostly (to my knowledge) by Latin-American communities and countries, and also on World of Warcraft.
---
Its just a burn mage. Now there was an otk for mage that was very simmilar but utilised [[Evolved kobold]], to get the damage through. I believe it was regarded as the old exodia combo.

New expansion launch and standard rotation is April 9th, that is the deadline for purchasing one K&amp;C pack, crafting Hall of Fame cards, playing the rotating adventures Dungeon Run and Frozen Throne. The  expansions from last year don't rotate and can be purchased later as well.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you have to use all 5 for 10, but as history has shown, healing is good. This is flexible healing, which is even better. If your opponents goes wide, play a board clear and heal with leftover mana. Krag‚Äôwa just nabs you extra copies of a flexible healing card for immense value
---
your spells cost 1 more and do 3 more damage each... 
---
That's what they keep telling us since Blackrock Mountain. [[Dragon Consort]] never got the love it deserved. The only other paladin class support we had since then is that gargoyle now, right? 
---
He's talking about neutral - the 4/8 windfury, this card and topsy turvy in priest
---
Roooooooooooooooooooooootates out :D
---
Run both.
---
I imagine it‚Äôll lose buffs
---
Doesn't the new spell only resurrect unique minions?
---
Agreed! A mysterious treant indeed.
---
‚ÄúWait for the incense!‚Äù
---
Really depends on the quality of inexpensive demons but the potential for greatness is there. 
---
I know man, but I think she shouldn¬¥t have the "pirate" theme looking, otherwise she seems really well arted.
---
I would say there was no reason for Blizzard to put the ‚ÄúPirate‚Äù tag on it, considering that is a Priest class, Priest doesn‚Äôt have and will never have pirates synergies.
---
Plus it would be easily removed by Golaka(that crab that destroys pirates, sorry if I don‚Äôt remember the name) and that would be a huge drawback in Wild.
---
This is a neutral too.
---
What did they change exactly? Haven't had a chance to check the stream out yet.
---
And gets silenced by shieldbreaker.
---
Rarity has nothing to do with stats
---
&gt; then clearly their classic set was not that influential. 
---
Wow, that is some leap of logic you're using there.
---
No, that is not what is "clearly" the case. Because, and I can't believe this has to be said: *the Classic set often has a variety of cards that serve a variety of functions.*
---
&gt; This isn't really a debate. You are arguing with me and getting yourself confused about what the word archetype means for no good reason than to troll me or what?
---
This isn't a debate because there's "debate" to be had when you don't know what logic is or how to use it.

Yup, this murloc package looks bonkers. Even my non-quest murloc deck is decent, and this will just make the tribe much stronger. 
---
Yep!
---
I thought that off the name too lol
---
Maly really limits design space, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was something like ‚ÄúThe next spell you cast this turn has spell damage +5‚Äù with a small decrease in mana cost, even if it doesn‚Äôt see play.
---
There's a reason Jaina never accepted any apprentices again after Kindy Sparkshire... 
---
&gt; if you play eternal you know exactly what Aegis and Endurance and Entomb and Killer do...
---
Sure, if you're an entrenched Eternal player you know them. I tried to get into Eternal, bought their welcome bundle and some packs, built a budget rakana aggro decks, drafted a few times, lost interest. I still couldn't tell you what Entomb is. I remember Killer as 'this creature is a Hearthstone minion this turn' but I couldn't tell you any more details than that.
---
Witch's brew doesn't say Echo for the benefit of those sorts of players. Not you or me.
---

---
r/everyfuckingthread
---
Combos well with spell damage
---
I don't follow?  My point was that corpsetaker can't be the reason windfury was used because windfury (the card) doesn't trigger corpsetaker.
---
It's OK interloper. We all make mistakes.
---
I hope you're right. 
---
Both can hit next turn, both cards are silenced. 
---
I don't see how people can see this as a meme. At worst it's a meme, but it has really great upside. Like even getting a one health buff makes this card worth 3 Mana.
---
I think the format was great from a conceptual point of view.  It divides up the work in a way that makes sense. Chris is there to make sure they talk about certain topics and run some of the 'behind the scenes' stuff while Kibler and Iksar are there to bounce to discuss the design aspects.  
---
One of the problems with the first stream was there were too many people trying to do all the different roles and it just winds up being a mess, especially if that crew doesn't have a lot of experience doing all that.  And then add the bugs that throw people off and the whole thing falls apart.
---
Having just 2 voices most of the time is a lot easier to follow than 3 and that was the most noticeable change that improved the quality this time around.
---
\*High-Roll\* Tide
---
In wild you might save 6 mana on turn 6. Maybe. If you draw all 3 legendary murlocs that you want. 
---
1 star! Recruit is specifically KNC mechanic.
---
It was an opportunity for some interesting new cards and they really just went with a lame option, the only positive thing about it that those rng cards are good for newer players to play cards they dont have
---
obviously since were not that audience people are going to not like it 
---
Millhouse is standard
---
Man Dragon priest was great during MSoG. Kinda sad how we have [[Nightscale Matriarch]] now and it never sees play. 
---
Question about how discover pools work with deathrattle minions and Nine Lives:
---
Say two Ursatrons die as well as four other deathrattle minions. Is there a chance you'll be offered two Ursatrons in the discover options when you cast Nine Lives or do discover effects like that only care about unique cards?
---
There isn't a whole lot of fun imo if all games play out the same
---
For me Big Rogue, Thief Rogue and Renolock are fun because every game is different.
---
The win condition is more fluid, as opposed to 'hit face with murlocs' or 'press hero power and exhaust their resources'
---
I think Big Priest needs addressed, because most people play this game to have fun.
---
either that or because of an obligation after all the money and time you've already soaked into it
---
Oh dear God it becomes unkillable then doesn't he. Or does he loose the gained deathrattles?
---
I can't tell if it's because of the limitations of their design choices (only so many class card, themes/keywords are kept within one set).
---
Or ... it's a deliberate thing they do to string long-time players out into waiting for more cards to improve the deck AND causing newer players to buy older cards to create the deck once it becomes playable. 
---
Either way, it kind of annoys me.

7/4/9 Dragon | Whenever a friendly minion is healed, summon a 3/3 Whelp.  
---
You can use weapons project the turn before, the perfect answer.
---
My only actual critique for Chris would be to stop making mention / apologizing every time he mis-speaks. It just draws attention to it and slows down the conversation. Better to just move on and let it go. Other than that I think he did a lot better on the second stream and using him in more of a host capacity was a smart move.
---
I'm expecting this card to get nerfed.
---
But for now, I'll get upset if I don't open at least one in the packs I get
---
Yeah, especially when splitting between multiple sets. I really think if you want to get to the point where you can play multiple types meta decks AND experiment with meme decks and such, you need to open around 180 packs per expansion unfortunately (maybe fewer if you've been around since the beginning, but I started right before ungoro and this has been my experience. I also play quite a bit).
---
This one doesn't even have elemental synergies. SMH
---
Now we just need something to cheat out Eureka! 
---
My thoughts exactly 
---
Finally all those shitty summon imp spells make sense! 
---
PANINI
---
No. If you unstable evolution 5 times on turn 5, he returns 5 of that card to you.
---
I see I see. So it would be 400 dust + one of two choices, a golden baku or 1200 more dust.
---
That makes things a lot more clear, thanks!

At least you‚Äôre closer than me, I thought it was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flying biceps‚Äù

But spells trigger Gadgetzan Auctioneer. I don't know much about Hearthstone, but I lowkey think Small Mage will be viable, because Small Mage will have all the draw they want. [[Stargazer Luna]], [[Gadgetzan Auctioneer]], [[Pyromaniac]] are all great in small mage. Small mage is the only deck where I could see Pyromaniac remaining good with Baku leaving us. I could see this card being ran in some versions of small mage if it ends up being any good.

You just explained how the basic/classic sets of classes are important and impactful in every single meta since the game launched. If you wouldn't have the base structure in the basic and classic sets you wouldn't be able to shift a class into different playstyles.

It's a 3/5.  Ping it.  It's now a 3/4.  It survived damage - its ability triggers! Now there are two 3/4s; the orginal and a copy of it.  Flamestrike.  They don't survive the damage, and now you're sad.

Conjurer's calling: so I destroy a minion then all I have to do to replace it is summon two same costed minions??
---
Aggro cards? I mean there's been a couple here and there, but this expansion LARGELY seems control to me. In addition, they're HOF'ing two cards that are largely responsible for aggro. Not sure if srs.
---
*died for this

---
No, they're trading 1-2 health for a coin, since if you can go face with a 5 attack creature for 4 mana you could also go face with a 4 attack creature for 4 mana (Yeti is a 4/5 with no downside and hardly sees play). This card is pretty bad when compared to Yeti of all things.
---
My Stars Align Priest deck is happy
---
Have you even summoned The Ancient One yet? 
---
Rogue knew what he was doing, swd has been outta the meta for a year
---
good in arena, i guess
---
I think there was a clear improvement. Only having 2 playing made it flow better than the previous stream, and I think Chris filled a useful role of leading the stream in between the matches.
---
Also, the decks were much more interesting in this stream since they could show all the new cards.
---
Shaman has ALWAYS had big damage late game combos like that. Alakir Rockbiter. Bloodlust. Rockbiter Windfury. Zentimo. Eureka Malygos. The list goes on. Hardly any of them have ever been good. Shudderwock made it but I don‚Äôt think this card is on par with Shudderwock
---
That's how I feel as well. From a powerlevel perspective I can't weigh it in tbh, it will show what it has over the next 2 years. But when it comes to interesting ideas, flavors and effects this expansion looks really amazing. 
---
The whole point of heal zoo in wild is to be even shaman, which is heal zoo but actually wins games... Turns out a free 3/3 or 2 isn't as degenerate as windfury on 4 mana 6/6s, 4 mana 7/7s, 5 mana 8/8s, and 1 mana 5/5s, or beating aggression consistently. 
---
I don't understand why people on r/hearthstone say "gOoD iN WiLd" whenever blizz prints a bad card. It seems like this sub doesn't understand that whatever slow card or combo is printed or available won't work in a faster format. You're doing it right now, and there are a few people who are doing it on the mega-windfury card thread.
---
Neutral Legendary:  3 Mana 6/6
---
Battlecry:  The next card your opponent plays costs 0 mana.
---
Let's not confuse new players who don't know who that is. We gotta keep it simple for blizzard standards. 
---
This is definitely not something they want to be dominant, this is an introduction to something we'll see being built upon over the year.
---
Not doing what you want =/= ruining class identity.
---
Grow up.

Haha when I first saw this, that was my thought
---
Thanks, this answered the question!

Came here to say this.  Also can bounce Shinyfinder.

Cool it, buddy

Yeah, I think it would be too powerful if it kept them. Still pretty decent value/board presence unless you're hit with silence.

8 mana 7/7 Legendary

**Battlecry:** Discover 5 cards. Replace your deck with 2 copies of each
---
even elder scrolls legends has a   list  of what   each keyword  does. 
---
You can't teach some people about proper game design, not in a game this casual and accessible. They think they know everything and refuse to learn from proven examples in other games.
---
So I gather there's another purchasable solo adventure in a month too. So does this adventure award new cards like previous adventures (Naxx, League etc.)? So we're getting a full set and a mini set form the adventure?
---
This card seems more about control than an otk or push mechanic. What happens if you draw your charge minions beforehand? Then you‚Äôre kind of screwed.
---
In a control type deck you‚Äôd want to summon a bunch of taunts or large minions
---
I think it sounds awesome my only concern is draw and survivability which I don‚Äôt think ursatron, oblivitron and safeguard can facilitate but I‚Äôll certainly be giving it a go cos it looks fun as hell.
---
Unsleeping Soul - 4 mana Priest spell, "Silence a friendly minion, then summon a copy of it." 
---
I mean that's a pretty low bar
---
What's with the weird spellzerker wild pyro shit. Just play thalnos and kobold geomancer
---
If you think aggro is about hand vomiting then you're genuinely bad at the game LMAO
---
Portal Overfiend too.
---
Depends on how slow the game is. If secret paladin is as good (and fast) at it looks, then this likely won't make the cut. But if more midrange decks dominate you may put this card in just to help stabilize the board
---
So dreampetal florist or twig preparation isn't OTK?
---
I know what you mean here but if it doesn't require much commitment (you're still likely to win without inner fire combo anyways) then it's not detracting from the degeneracy of the combo. I'll reword it to 30+ damage without much work if that makes you feel better.
---
Hearthstone will be out of business before they print a proper dragon pally deck 
---
Happy Ghoul &amp; Fungal Enchanter made a whole archetype of zoo with trash cards like Lightwarden/Voodoo Doctor which have been around forever and (AFAIK) were never viable otherwise.
---
Shaman OTK: Have the Walking Founain, the Crazed Alchemist, Ancestral Healing and the Whirlwind Tempest in hand. Play the Fountain on the first turn. If the Fountain survives with a few life, play Ancestral Healing on it, then Crazed Alchemist and then play the Whirlwind Tempest for 4x8= 32 Damage. Easy OTK out of nowhere.
---
si
---
Secret paladin has a fiery war axe and a totem golem to potentially play on turn 2. I dont think it'll be quite on the level of aggro shaman, but I'm satisfied that it has enough consistency to be a strong aggro deck.
---
I'll do something different.  Rogue's "Callback" card is an "Unidentified" card from K&amp;C.  Can you guess which of the 4 modes is fake?
---
Unidentified Contract:  6 Mana Rogue Spell.  Destroy a minion and:
---
1. It deals its damage to adjacent minions.
---
2. Add 2 Coins to your hand.
---
3. Summon a Patient Assassin (1/1 Stealth + Poisonous)
---
4. Shuffle 3 copies of it into your deck.
---
Oh oops. Well the new one is incredibly underwhelming.
---
with that rush minion it may very well see play, but I didnt say they were bad, just kinda lame. Some classic cards have made huge impacts and this is pretty much the only time theyve added cards so it couldve been great, but they seem to save those things for the regular expansions 
---
just another day in arena....
---
They are going to print more of those over time. 
---
HAHAH!
---
I fucking LOVE this card. This feels exactly how I felt about Witch's Cauldron last reveal season. I hope I open some of these right away. 
---
[*Bonus meme*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yLsF8VMPKE)
---
HooooWeee that's insanely good!
---
Every rush is kinda awesome with this card 
---
Is 'hu' an abbreviation for anything?
---
It's not semantics man it literally describes gameplay interaction. It says "restore" health. That's an action. 
---
Not unless you play it with immortal prelate
---
Linkin Park is that you?
---
Nope its fake!
---
This was inspired by the rumors that we were getting a new Milhouse, but it was just a random minion instead.
---
You're not wrong, but with the big meta shakeup and all the even/odd decks rotating out, burst shaman definitely has a chance. It's been popular in the meta before. With that new murloc [[Scargil]] , that lets Shaman build a big murloc board from essentially nothing, then token/murloc/burst shaman is due for a comeback, I think.
---
Shudderwock was a one off. It saw play not because it was good (it really wasn't, after counter decks were created) but because it was unique and straight up broke the gameplay mechanics. If Shaman can build big boards, control the field, survive to late game, and have some kind of burst damage available, it'll see play.
---
for once....this post on it actually is interesting even though it's been posted like 50 times  
---
that card art effect looks insane 
---
Hey renanbalbinot, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
I'm a little more interested in this expansion than I was in the past few. There's nothing here that completely wowed me, but at least there are some interesting new combinations. I'm particularly interested in Wild, since I prefer slow decks and suspect Standard will be an aggro-fest for awhile. I think the variety at my casual level (low teens/early 20's) in Wild will be pretty fun.
---
Hey, but there is a weird thing going on here. I have not enough dust for all, but I have Dust for some things. I guess I should prioritize Epics &gt; Rares &gt; Common, because the refund for Epic is 1:4 (the highest)?
---
This after t3 playing the 5/6 that can only attack with spellpower..looks pretty good for aggro mage
---
Yep its fake!  This was based on a rumor that we were getting a new Milhouse.
---
You explaination is a good one but I would lean towards potions with effects like extra strength other buff being toxic to the organism like in the witcher.
---
This is a neutral card...
---
Jungle panther isn't a bad card, and while this seems unfavorable at first, and probably won't see play, that one extra health allows it to dodge a lot more early game removal that kills panther. 
---
Are you alone in this feeling you ask? Of course not. Everyone is excited about a specific card I'm sure...
---
Paladin has access to 2 board clears, more healing then it's ever had and a mechanic that lets it never fatigue.
---
If you can't make a control deck out of that, I don't know what to tell you.
---
maybe by repeatable they let you use it again without using any more mana?
---
Or,
---
1. Play Ravenhodlt Assassin
---
2. End Turn
---
3. Play Eureka to summon copy of Whirlwind Tempest
---
4. Play Windfury and Rockbiter on Ravenhodlt.
---
5. 5 card 2-turn 40 damage combo, ez.
---
I'm right with you guys.  I'll be opening about 200 packs and dusting everything that's rotating.
---
She's a dead Mexican. That's a sombrero (different from the pirates bicorne) and also the skull and crossbones are a pretty appropriate motif for a graveyard. Similar art styles but conceptually different.
---
This one's really stumping me, because all of them are very flavorful, but I'm gonna guess that #4 is fake because it seems to have the least to do with the flavor of "what killed this minion."
---
Is this really a post complaining about seems Ng freeze mage for the first time?
---
My sweet summer child...
---
I think pogo is gonna be t2 in the next expansion due to the value meta
---
i dont see it this way.  There are so many ways to build a deck designed for a windfury minion to stick, or ANY minion to stick, with enough taunt and removal to last until turn 8, or turn 10 with the windfury spell.
---
You've given up on it before youve even tried!
---
Haha thanks! Sorry I didn‚Äôt realize how often this was already posted though. Just caught me off guard when I saw this in my arena match. 
---
I think there are enough spell damage cards in this set to make SOMETHING work. Not sure what that something is. I don‚Äôt think spell damage hunter will take off until masters call is gone tho. Beast draw engine is just too good 
---
Cause reading is hard. I read title then comment
---
It's flame wanker 2.0
---
You‚Äôre in for some good news, cause this is real. 
---
Wow, some of these seem very strong... haven‚Äôt felt this excited for a new expansion in awhile (could be because it‚Äôs being coupled with rotation)
---
LOL let's see dude, this card will break the rank 15 meta for sure
---
A whole new world...
---
Also arguably the best budget deck in wild too
---
But that directly supports the quote you put in the title...
---
So, what's the point?
---
Kobolds and Catacombs was merely a setback!
---
and the ticket is at least 1 pack.
---
I've been messing around with the idea of a miracle mage this expansion and this is what I got so far. Let me know if you guys see any improvements that can be made. I know it's not going to be the greatest deck in the world, but its looking like a fun deck to play on release.
---
How about rotten applebaum? Dragon paly is looking to be a good midrange deck, but it will have a terrible time against murloc shaman. I think it‚Äôll be far better later on when we hopefully get more dragons. Murloc shaman is loooking like it‚Äôll be the aggro deck to beat post rotation
---
&gt;auto eliminated(like Umbra's main issue). 
---
what's this mean? 
---
[[Psychic Scream]]
---
Enjoy your 13 dead draws. 
---
Thanks, Sherlock! Now, which paladin card do you use to rez the neutral card?
---
Never said they were tied to the expansion, just counting their inception as keywords. Hell, prior to Frozen Throne there were only two cards that used Lifesteal's pre-keyword phrase (poisonous had a couple more but they were generally few and far between).
---
Murloc decks are stupidly fucking strong so they gotta seperate all the support so you can only really play it in wild
---
To wild. Big priest is a wild deck.
---
I'm less interested in the new cards and more interested in seeing the old cards leave.  I have some midrange shaman and paladin decks in mind that I look forward to playing.
---
What card is this referring to? Is this referring to unstable evolution or did they release a new card like this that I missed? Seems especially weird that they wouldn‚Äôt call it echo since they‚Äôre revisiting old mechanics this expansion
---
Question: Is there any downside (considering I'm at a rank floor in Standard) to seeing out the next few days with a meme deck, disenchanting all my KnC, KoFT and Ungoro cards and using the dust to craft these HOF's? 
---
I'll lose three days of perspective climbing (which is horrible right now, tbh) and gain some dust, or am I missing something?
---
Yea, because fucking anyone who enjoys playing as the only interesting class this game has seen. I forgot every single deck has to just be either "play minions" or "kill minions".
---
Good V-07-TRON callback
---
# THE GOLDEN ZENTIMO I PACKED ON DAY 1 IS FINALLY USEFUL
---
I can see at least 80 cards seeing play very cool expansion, plot twist will probably be nerfed 
---
Wait really? That‚Äôs actually really cool.
---
That's interesting. But why pick murlocs over overload on an expansion based around Dalaran? Seems like the perfect time to push spell shaman since it already has cards like Electra, Zentimo, Kragwa, Haunting Visions, Spirit of the Frog etc. and also cards like Likkim and Thunderhead. The aggro shaman deck did relatively poorly since it is still clearly missing the support it needs but 4 overload support cards and an overload legendary would definitely have been a step in the right direction.
---
True but it isn't exactly the same, wasn't calling you out or anything but i just wanted to clarify
---
Ah your right. Damn, Rafaam sucks then.
---
If rafaam didn't affect hand that combo would have actually been a really strong mid range, maybe control, board fill and finisher.
---
Da Undatakah only keeps it's buff when it's shuffled back in your deck, so the Recruiting Villain deathrattle will only summon a vanilla 8/5
---
Shovelfist is massively better than Icehowl.
---
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS
---
There's so many cards that give you benefits when friendly minions die like 3 to the enemy face i can't wait to try when it releases
---
Yes, but the actual mode #4 is "Add 1 copy of it to your hand".  The names of the modes are:
---
1. Turncoat Contract
---
2. Lucrative Contract
---
3. Assassin's Contract
---
4. Recruitment Contract
---
&gt; Shudderwock was a one off. It saw play not because it was good
---
wtf are you talking about? It absolutely was good. Give me some proof if you‚Äôre gonna try a bullshit claim like that
---
But without admitting they're doing so. 
---
If you're invested in the release season centered around twinspell and then out of nowhere here comes an echo recruit and adapt cards sprinkled about. It'll be weird. Not to mention keywords which they're main expansion has rotated out, seeing these keywords here and there would mean that super casuals would get annoyed by a mechanic which they really don't need to know. Unless the card goes evergreen like Discover and you start seeing it everywhere it's better to put the info on the card.
---
You never draw Alfred unless its both Alfreds at the same time, in your opening hand.
---
Darn, we got another evolve card at least
---
r/inclusiveor
---
This could have been a legendary effect 
---
It‚Äôll have some polarizing matchups. It‚Äôs a good midrange deck, so good against control, but too slow against aggro. Hard to say really, as the meta is nigh impossible to predict due to the rotation
---
well paladin decks without deckbuilding restrictions run thekal and molten giant, which helps compensate for the lack of baku
---
Why is the recruit keyword not being used here?
---
twinspell
---
Adding 3 damage for 1 more mana seems decent for Arcane Missiles, Cinderstorm, Frostbold and Fireball, but pretty great for Arcane Explosion and Shooting Star.
---
130 packs is not enough to craft multiple meta decks with room to experiment.  It is nice that there is some discussion going on, but the very simple answer to your question is "no".
---
&gt;big priest gets absolutely shit on by most of the top decks, namely kingsbane rogue which is like a 90-10 matchup, odd warrior which is like a 70-30 matchup, and even warlock which is like 60-40.
---
You are wrong Big Priest is strongly favored against Evenlock.

Cue the arena shaman lethal top deck with spell power totem.
---
It make even less sense, SINCE THIS IS A CALLBACK EXPANSION. So dumb.
---
Silence it and you're golden
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Because recruit isn't an evergreen mechanic. Blizzard thinks keeping keywords precious makes individual expansions feel unique.
---
They're wrong.
---
But that's why 
---
Yes I would.
---
&gt;if I was a new player I could read the tooltip that pops up when i mouse over the card and not be confused.
---
Assuming you haven't already forgotten that you can do that amidst all the other information you're simultaneously trying to absorb. Ever watch a casual player try to learn Hearthstone for the first time? Everything you think is obvious will completely escape their notice as they miss attacks, forget their hero power exists, and try to play cards they can't afford. A perpetually expanding glossary of keywords means more stuff they have to learn, more mistakes made while they're learning, and more people who quit because they decide the game just isn't for them.
---
Strider is a class card, those a built stronger. This isn‚Äôt even meant for rouge so again way out of the loops comparing these two. Why is everyone on reddit just ‚Äúworst than card from two years ago can‚Äôt see play‚Äù

Can you explain that in more detail? This is +1/+1 over yeti for the downside of your opponent getting a coin when it attacks.

they hof'ed  divine favor. that's the opposite of supporting aggro. i think any kind of aggro paladin decks will be dead for a while. i don't know what you are talking about.
---
Overload doesn't mean spell spam. Again, Team 5 is trying to bring Shaman back to its original themes. Its minion themes are Totem and Murlocs. They went Murloc this time and likely will go Totem or Overload next time. Once those are stabilizes, they might hit subthemes.
---
Also Shaman is behind Hagatha not Dalarian this time. Murlocs is swampier than Overload to me.
---
Yeah, Mill typically lacks those, but idk if there are enough mill tools for this to work out in a mill deck. 
---
Im sorry? I can, but its not a good idea because?
---
Umbra is never safe on board, unless the opponent already lost or is really unlucky because most of the time she is killed one way or another

"The second spell you play each turn has has spell damage +5."

Not technically because secret.... but I would have went for it.

So does this gain +2 every turn or just gain +2 once?

Well, wild does exist.

It's this good enough to make quest hunter viable in wild?
---
Probably not.

FYI, Shaman's one of the evil factions in this set. They have no ties to Dalaran since the evil's Hagatha, who came from the swamps - ergo murlocs would make sense there.
---
So I've used the shaman [[windfury]] spell on a [[sea giant]] before to do 16 damage. This is a wonderful organic combo for 32 that might work and might not show up some days. I love it.
---
Fate seal was only ever mentioned on one card (mesmeric sliver) and was from a set all about weird, new mechanics that might be used in the future at some point or not at all. That set being future sight. Jace's ability isn't Fate seal since he can target you and fate seal only hits opponents.

10/8/8 | Costs (1) less for each other minion on the battlefield.  
---
I think I made this card once, but it used to be a bread vendor.
---
I think the reason they don‚Äôt make recruit permanent is the same reason they got rid of enrage. It‚Äôs not really useful to save the 3 words. Most keywords feature in card text of other cards. Like the reason poisonous became a keyword is that they wanted ‚Äúgive another minion poisonous‚Äù or ‚Äúsummon a 2/1 poisonous thing‚Äù without explaining poisonous on those cards that reference the effect. Recruit exclusively showed up on recruit cards, and there isn‚Äôt really a useful reason it would show up on another card, because summoning from deck is the same as any other sort of summon mechanically. Basically if it isn‚Äôt causing card space problems, why bother having another keyword to learn?
---
You can't trust the card text, this is Hearthstone.
---
I need this answered too. This is why I hate the hearthstone blue balls trope
---
Hey they made my favourite raid boss into a card. Opulence. WoW players know.
---
Don't really see this making any Druid lists. Way too overcosted at 3 mana. The Twinspell is getting more credit than it should, it might as well read "Give your minions +1/+1, add a terrible card to your hand." It's in a weird spot where 3 mana is too weak, while 2 mana may be too strong. Still, I'd like to see this at 2 mana as I like to see class cards potentially a bit too strong as opposed to underwhelming, especially when Druid is perhaps one of the classes being hit hardest by the Standard rotation.
---
I don‚Äôt see him enough to warrant hatred. Only a few decks here and there succeed with him. Compared to omnipresent op cards that were slapped in every deck. idc one bit about the dragon.
---
Does the vault safe have a deathrattle?  It should give you a coin.

 ^(Silence priest is back)

Dude you have the weapon equipped from a different turn it doesn't count
---

---
Had this thought too but it rotates unfortunately.
---
they want you to be able to reuse it but not proc echo synergy cards
---
I love seeing all the wild format comments on these new cards. They all come from players who clearly don't have much experience there. 
---
It upgrades by 1 armor per turn, right? Like Hagatha's Scheme from the original reveal?
---
That is so bad. So absolutely awful. There is no way that even Blizzard would print that.
---
is this an actually playable rager???
---
Well no shit lol, the frog is for spell decks and the juggler is for minion decks. You‚Äôre obviously not going to run them in the same deck. The thing with the theoretical Small Mage is they can easily generate tons of spells so they‚Äôll probably get more out of this card than a zoo deck would with juggler. 
---
uhhh, you can't do all of that in one turn? Also a deck like that seems very situational, and most of the time you would have multiple dead cards in hand. A otk combo that has limited damage cap, can't go through taunt, requires a minion to stick, and requires you to run cards that are bad on their own doesn't seem good enough.  
---
If you've seen the combo decks that do well in hearthstone, this one raises a lot of red flags :/
---
Not bad, that's an epic right?

---
I never played wild before... before this!
---
maybe he conceded!
---
They are still good cards that can be played in Wild, Solo Adventures, and some Tavern Brawls and aside from Genn and Baku are better to have than the HoF cards. The amount of dust you'd be getting is not much compared to what you are losing if you ever craft those cards again.
---
Not sure - it seems worse than that 2/5 taunt poisonous for the same price

I have a lot more hope this time:  They had been only drip-feeding before, one Dragon Paladin per year.  Getting 3 cards in a single set might be enough to make it work.
---
just retire it at that rate.

Dude, put him in a Jade deck. Nothing is more fun than getting off three Jade Lightnings in one turn.

---
The tutor is important since you really want to play \[\[Tracking\]\] in that deck without discarding a combo piece. This not only tutors the Mechathun but also the Galvanizers.
---
This is just best practice for keywords. Magic has demonstrated this for years now.
---
It makes no sense to use a non-evergreen keyword *once* in an expansion aside from extreme outliers like the Mega-Windfury minion revealed today where the keyword is so over the top, that's the point.
---
Chances are, if you're interested and involved in the game enough to visit online communities to discuss cards with other players, this practice wasn't done for you. It's for newer or more casual players who very well might not be familiar with Echo. And even if the game offers a tool tip reminder, that doesn't explain why there aren't other Echo cards in the set or in future sets.
---
It sounds silly to the kind of people who read about and discuss the game pretty much every day, but this is just a simple way to reduce complexity for players which is actually a really big deal in card games where complexity (which we've long seen overcome) can be a huge turn off.

They're not finished by any means but without playtesting it's sometimes hard to tell what will/won't work, lol.
---
A sad, boring card, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's real. I'm betting it is. 
---
This makes me unreasonably angry. It‚Äôs one thing to leave a card‚Äôs text alone if it was printed before the keyword was made (Y‚Äôshaarj, Unstable Evolution) but fuck this
---
maybe not several... I'd say at least 2. 2 dozen wild quest shaman players. ever.
---
Does this guy get resummoned without the death rattle?
---
I thinks it's worth mentioning that [[windfury]] costs 2 mana. In shaman, you can give anything mega-windfury for 10 mana.  Now it's just a question of "is that worth it?".
---
Not sure, but at the very least it will work with regular 1-cost cards that bwonsamdi would pull.  
---
It doesn't sound that great, but a Carpet + Spirit with Bwomsamdi in hand means that you can throw a bunch of ones at the enemy to control to board, then play Bwomsamdi and do it against next turn. It's... *decent* I suppose.
---
Now, if we could make it work with reduced cost cards, then the sky's the limit :)  
---
Nah, he‚Äôs right. The only good thing about this card is you get to play 1 cost murlocs for free. Since this card costs 4 mana you‚Äôre never going to actually get a discount on murlocs that cost more than 1, you just won‚Äôt have enough mana. It‚Äôs too slow for a murloc deck. Even if you do get a crazy combo with this card your opponent is just going to clear your board, then you have no minions on the board or in your hand and Shaman doesn‚Äôt have a ton of draw tools. 
---
Oops, I misunderstood the post.

Won't know until we see it in action. I've seen a lot of improbable combos make it. I love it when we find decks in late meta as well

---
You should be alone because I just went and checked the amount of windfury cards that will be available to play after rotation hits and Rumble, Boomsday and Witchwood LITERALLY HAVE 0 FUCKING WINDFURY CARDS.

 So yea you only have the classic windfury cards to work with and the 1 new windfury 8 mana card which means you can't even curve it into this efficiently.

So it‚Äôs essentially a 2 card flamestrike that still equals 7 mana but leaves you a body and further spell damage. Not bad. 
---
This looks really fun to play. I like the Big Bad Archmage with Dimensional Ripper combo didn't think of that. Might need to cut 1 or 2 high cost cards tho
---
Isn't this true with the 5 mana paladin spell that doubles a minions attack as well? And that doesn't see play
---
Just opened a golden one last week and immediately dusted it, boy will I regret that decision! 
---
This could work in the mage deck I've been sort of planning. Thinking a value centric tempo handmage kind of deal. All the twinspells plus discover effects. Wouldn't be hard to have 4-5 spells in hand. 
---
Its just IMPortant to think about better puns in cardnames. 
---
You mean quadruple Oondasta with two of these.
---
Actually, Nine Lives allows us to summon a three mana Mecha'thun which could potentially be pretty nuts. Boomzooka him out or summon him early with Oblivitron and you'd be able to summon Mecha'thun later in the game (as long as you don't run any other deathrattle minions)
---
Donias once said something along the lines of "hunter is overplayed at low ranks, even when it has no good decks. This makes us worry about the low rank prevalance of hunter if there are too many powerful hunter decks." Reasonable statement when taken at face value. Because this was said around KoFT, when hunter was REALLY struggling and priest was the class to beat (additionally there might have been a Donias quote where he said he enjoys priest decks, i dont remember), this quote has been mangled into "hunter will never get good cards because donias hates huntets, and priests will always get OP cards because Donias loves them"
---
Obviously, this is bullshit, but that hasnt stopped it from being said
---
That seems bananas. It really doesn't need to have much more than 1 health to be worth playing.
---
^Mmmph
---
 It feels like we‚Äôre getting a malchezar card in the near future
---
As I said elsewhere, you can already represent 4x minion attack by using the 5 mana paladin spell that doubles a minions attack. That doesn't see play
---
It won't be that bad, I think. It should be far easier to go up against than Odd Pally has been. 
---
Who knows though, I'll just be over here with my new Rez Priest and MemeLock
---
I think he's distinguishing between aggro token druid and later token druids that weren't as strong the first couple turns but turned things on fast with [[Wispering Woods]] and pre-nerf [[Giggling Inventor]] turns in the midgame that instantly threatened lethal if left alive for a turn.
---
yeah i made a Miracle Mage deck I'm hoping will be good. Never know until you play it tho.

Tron is a magic deck which has the most polarizing matchups in modern.  The midrange and control decks of the format all have horrible matchups against it, while combo and aggro decks can easily handle it.  Because there's not much counter play against tron apart from hoping you don't get paired up against it next round, it became a meme.

Fun bot to vizualize how conversations go on reddit. Enjoy
---
It's harder to remove turn 1 than a 1 drop, which then gives you this crazy tempo play. And aside from a few all-taunt decks, very few control decks can *never* attack and still survive a super strong tempo play, so you'll get value from your Noble Sacrifice eventually, too. I'm prepared to be wildly wrong but this looks really awful, esp for those of us with lingering "Who am I?!" scars.
---
It should.
---
FIRE
---
Your combo seems eerily similar to double blessed champion which saw 0 play but it‚Äôs definetly a fun thing to think about 
---
Creative, flavorful, balanced, I like it and I'm betting its real. 
---
Does that change any aspect of what I said? Just because it can be run outside of warlock doesn't mean it won't be part of warlocks toolkit.
---
Good Rager. What a wonderful time to live in.
---
True. Filling your hand in hunter should not be so quickly dismissed though.
---
I still don't understand how Shaman got this as their newfound identity
---
Yup just yup
---
No because Wild is shit, full of a lot of the gimmicky mechanics I really dislike and Standard looks to be getting better as many of those are now gone for the most part.   
---
I'd be down for that, but maybe make it 50-60 seconds. A full minute seems alright for a turn. That said, there's a lot of combos and interactions that require waiting through a lot of animations and that could cause some issues.
---
Some cards have an effect when you play a card with echo. This would not trigger that effect...
---
As someone who‚Äôs played a lot of Pogo Rogue lately I‚Äôm not really sure this makes the deck better.
---
It‚Äôs pretty good against control I guess, but you usually win those anyway. What the deck really needs is ways to survive getting your face smashed by aggro while you‚Äôre trying to snowball your bunnies. Quest Rogue could rush the quest and make a comeback with Scalehides but Pogo Rogue just doesn‚Äôt have that sort of ability. While having more redundancy in bounce effects is nice it doesn‚Äôt solve that problem.
---
But perhaps the deck will still be good enough to see play as a pure control killer. We‚Äôll have to see.
---
Thank you.
---
I totally forgot about Arcane Shot. With it you can get easily to 34 with Attack=2 , 2x Mana Reservoir (-4 mana), 2xArcane shot=12 (-2 mana), 2x Rapid Fire=20 (-4 mana).
---
Wouldn't Tony be better in this deck than Nomi?
---
Don't sleep on being able to cheat minions out that can take advantage of this, it is a good thing adapt is leaving because Flappy Bird with Mega Windfury on turn 4 due to rogue hijinx was not gonna be fun for anyone
---
Because if you only say it once, is it really overpowered?
---
Don't forget to use your dust to maximise profits from HoF cards then.  
---
2 mana shaman spell: heal 4 health. Repeatable this turn.
---
Nine Lives doesn't summon the minion it discovers, it adds it to your hand and triggers its deathrattle. It wouldn't work with Mechathun since he would be in your hand when the trigger goes off.
---
Even the art on the cards it a total disappointment.
---
Vanish has been used in the same way as Daring Escape in the past, and Vanish costs 6.
---
No you will not have enough cards to play what you want for only 130$.
---
2 Mana Warlock Spell plot twist, shuffle your hand I to your deck draw that many cards
---
"won't know until we see it in action" is a cop out answer. Why do people evaluate cards prior to the expansion? If that's your response after all this, then idk why I'm bothering to formulate thought out analyses. I want to have a proper discussion on this card, and answering like that doesn't really add anything to the discussion. Like if you had a viable use for this card, then we're talking. I'm open to being wrong here. 
---
Holy shit. That's potentially a lot better than just trying to get a lethal with bloodlust. Wild even shaman is already running 1-2 windfury and this seems like a good 1-of to get cheated wins in game occasionally.
---
Along with some of the other cards in the expansion I think wild even shaman will be insane
---
That probably had something to do with the fact that it needed dragons in your hand to trigger lmao. When the effect went off it was bonkers
---
Happy Reddit birthday friend, you've been on this site for exactly six years! Now you get to question the length of existence!!!
---
Arena filler, cool
---
How does this minion not have Windfury too?
---
For most it's because they need the dust to craft HoF cards, maximizing HoF is expensive when you go after gold cards.
---
Demon synergy with new warlock cards though, for all 4 minions
---
I did that. I cannibalized my old collection and started a new account. 
---
Felt great, tbh, plus now I have a bunch of rando fun decks on that account if I get a Friend quest.
---
Trying to make the best deck you can with a new account is a lot more enjoyable than just making a T1 and stomping 2/3 games til rank 15.

It would be a 5/5. It copies - not adds - a friendly minions health
---
Vanish also does this great thing where it removes the opponents board and possibly even kills their minions if they have a full hand
---
nope, provided he has more than 4 attack he gets resummoned as this minion
---
Da Undatakah is like that because his effect is a battlecry
---
Jepetto turn 8 then turn 9 play 1 mana Maly and 1 mana Vareesa, So (assuming you can swing Thori'Dal) that's 7+ Spell power and 7 mana to play around with + the 2 damage off the weapon itself, that should be within OTK range i would imagine but i'm sure this isn't the answer. 
---
I would say that that's really powerful, but Shaman already has Healing Rain, so I'm gonna bet Blizzard wouldn't hesitate to print this. Makes me a bit sad they aren't using the Echo keyword. 
---
The rogue 5/1 stealth one was pretty good, saw some play too
---
hi from /r/magictcg
---
In MTG there are 3 lands, Urza's Tower, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Mine. On their own they each tap for 1 mana per turn, but if you have all 3 on the field you get a total of 7 mana. 
---
Named after the mecha series Voltron, Assembling all 3 Urza's Lands on turn 3 is called "Urza Tron" (or Tron for short) nets you a huge mana advantage. Casting 7 mana spells on Turn 3 usually is gamewinning. A lot of people find the gameplay infuriating as there is little interaction from the Tron player and it feels like they're playing a game of Solitaire trying to assemble Tron. It's also a relatively linear gameplay which some find boring, and yet Tron puts up decent results (7% of the meta which is the second highest share after the 12% Aggro deck, in a meta with 19 decks over 2% share). Since it's somewhat frustrating it's a common meme online for people to say WOW. FUCK. TRON. in frustration

roppis1: Mana Reserve: Am I a joke to you?
---
Yeah I think elementals are dead until they get some more love. Ungoro had most of the commonly played ones 
---
Yes, we desperately needed an additional 2 Mana Elemental with good stats last rotation, but I have to disagree on its uselessness in this rotation. Mage has a card that can discount the cost of an elemental by 2, meaning in combination, this is a 0 Mana 2/3, quite good for tempo. Other applications remain those of recent Shaman expansions and those of Mage, but less impressive then the 0 Mana 2/3
---
Wow... Whoosh. 
---
Two of the paladin spells that double attack represents 4 times the minions attack. 
---
Mega windfury in the same way represents 4 times the minions attack. 
---
I sense a great deal of Azerite in the area.
---
easily my favorite art of the set
---
the penguin sees the lines... :)
---
I think wild quest shaman will be the better iteration of the murloc deck this expansion, but with so much rotating out I think murloc shaman will get a chance to eke out a spot as a tier 2/3 standard deck. Like you said, not oppressive but pretty good

Love playing a minion and have it be good two turns later

---
So I let this thing die. No matter what his attack is. Than I play undatakah who always has more than 4 attack and undatakah resummons the original minion? That seems weird cause whenever undatakah dies with ancestral tiger or something a copy of undatakah goes in the deck. So why is this one so diffrent
---
Yep, it‚Äôs real!
---
May actually be pretty good in an aggressive elemental mage deck. Elemental Evocation hasn't had it's time to shine yet, and a finally good 2 mana elemental (we've only had pyros and unstable) may be the exact thing this deck needs. I wouldn't write this off as pure trash just yet.

Uh huh, and you think putting a 10 mana combo in the deck that hamstrings your early to midgame, is what midrange shaman needs. 
---
Cool. Tell me more. Can I have some.of your crack?
---
Actually Healing Rain is going to wild.
---
wait who is Tony?
---
Chris Sierra off-handedly mentioned that they play-tested the decks this time. They were probably trying to avoid the same reaction as the kick-off reveal.
---
Year of the Mammoth cards will give no dust at time of expansion launch and if you decide to disenchant them will do so at normal dust amounts.
---
Cards going to the Hall of Fame will give you the full dust amount if you have the card in your collection when the expansion launches. You keep the card and have the option to dust it for normal dust amounts.
---
We haven't seen Windfury in a while, so I'm just gonna assume this is real. After RR brought back half the abandoned mechanics and tribes in the game, I don't doubt that Rise of Shadows would bring back a few more.
---
Basically the optimal f2p way to do things is to save up on gold for the entire expantion and buy a bunch of packs the next expantion. This means that you get a majority of the cards released that expantion and enough dust to make a decent deck. The only problem with this strat is that you will have to skip the current expantion, and save. Also you could get really good at arena but thats kinda hard. 
---
Could this be the worst card art they have ever released? This looks like it was drawn by an 8th grader compared to the rest of the art.
---
Guilty...
---
I saw the blade before the boobs. I must be getting wiser.
---
I thought he said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for the English‚Äù. Never made any sense until now!
---
What‚Äôs not to understand? Blizz has always struggled with shaman identity. It‚Äôs always been a mix of totems, whose decks have failed since tuskarr was nerfed; murlocs, who haven‚Äôt been viable since the old murk eye left standard; freeze, nothing needs to be said about that; elementals, which for the most part worked out but was never the most powerful deck; battlecry, which didn‚Äôt work until shudderwock, but has now been nerfed; and evolve, which blizz hasn‚Äôt had to nerf.
---
TLDR: evolve is one of the most fan loved and stable identities for blizzard. It‚Äôs never been totally horrible and also never needed nerfs due to being so good.
---
No, a 5-mana 4/4 Rush - Divine Shield - Taunt would be run in every deck in existence. 4 health is a huge breakpoint at that stage in the game, both for him being able to kill things that big and requiring that much damage in return.
---
So this card alone forces the opponent to kill any minion with 6 or more attack
---
That's true, I just mean that they've had a bonkers powerful healing card before, so I assume Blizzard isn't scared of giving them another. 
---
Aggro paladin with a murloc twist was briefly a thing last year but that deck is losing its main card draw and I still think the 3/2 draw two murloc card is way too weak to warrant running but who knows. 
---
Remindme! 2 months about all the scrubs thinking this is somehow playable with the card windfury. 
---
There's a small chance this gets abused, but unlikely
---
Oh, your post kinda confused me, I didn't know that's what you meant
---
Undatakah resummons himself upon death, if the wording on the card is what I think it is
---
Yeah but what else is priest gonna play lol
---
Well, i made that up, there is a 8 mana 6/6 minions with windfury have mega windfury though
---
Perhaps you should elaborate on this a little more in relation to the original post?  
---
With the word "always" you seem to be implying that all archetypes are always influenced by the classes classic cards?  
---
So looking at the meta we could pick any class right now and we should see that the classic cards had a big influence on those decks archetype?  
---
   
---
Masters call forces you to cut non-beast minions. Really good ones like hound master and hound master Shaw. This also creates *extra* threats. Extra highmanes etc. Thats much different than drawing cards
---
Or you could play blessed champion twice
---
Quests are rotating to wild and boy let me tell you the climate is rough there, you're not living to see your quest done against aggro.
---
Thanks u'mama
---
Fuck off even ^(yugi oh is better than this trash) 
---
Just a rare :/
---
Yea could be tough. But maybe it could work against slower decks. There seems not to be very much aggro in the next expansion as it seems. You should add in Zilliax, too. Forgot about him.
---

---
You specifically
---
&gt;  I love seeing all the wild format comments on these new cards. They all come from players who clearly don't have much experience there.
---
Actually I don't think it will be any good in wild. But I like to make people think of that format at all. If an idea is just not possible because of the standard rotation maybe people should just try it out in wild were it's possible. And it most stuff should work for rank 15-20 fun.
---
Haha yeah pretty slow but dangerous if left untouched. Prob won't see play 
---
Only real thrillseekers should dare to use Tinder on Azeroth.
---
Without twinspell, i'd think this is a neat card.  
---
The fact that it ALSO has twinspell makes this fucking INSANE. Think beyond standard
---
every minion with 3 attack or more
---
Goddamn, this thread is ubiquitously people sucking off this dudes purple tendrils. This card is B A D. 
---
They're all falling into the classic noob trap of only imaging the best use scenarios for this card. Try imagining the vast amount of times that this is literally Magma Rager. 
---
Silence Priest just doesn't have enough support right now to run a dead card like this. There are other, better, ways to get a ball of stats if that's what you're looking for. 
---
Ez stonetusk boar and dire frenzy synergy.
---
This will be a great addition to my terrible [[Hobgoblin]] decks. 
---
That's weird. Windfury minions basically never stick, so I can't imagine that being very good. Whatever.
---
Way too expensive for something like rush warrior, but this would be excellent in arena. 
---
Ah. I thought it would summon it and then trigger it's deathrattle. Welp, now I'm very disappointed.
---
The post you are replying to simply states that basic/classic have more power when there are less expansions in play which is a fair enough statement.  
---
Not sure where you get  the "every single meta" part from that post?  
---
**14**
---
This card is going to be ridiculous. Especially in wild 
---
hype hype hypeeeeee
---
No one talking about underbelly ooze?
---
And this is a comment thread about how it would be good with Spikeridged Steed, Which is a paladin card
---
I thought it was "that's what the wind says", for some odd reason
---
Most interesting card in the format tbh. Could be nice in Corpsetaker decks in wild.
---
Skull has a 50% chance to summon a wrong demon.
---
I had to double check that this is not /r/customhearthstone
---
Yeah it's just a +1/+1 in vanilla stats, it doesn't have charge so it has no immediate effect, it has no effects listed so there's no synergy available unless you're using an elemental deck (and if you're using an elemental deck, you want an elemental that does something based on playing an elemental the previous turn, not a vanilla elemental that could give your opponent advantage). Again, the stats are only +1/+1 against the Yeti and the Yeti sees no play in the meta.
---
The downside is effective, too. Your opponent will have either 5 or 6 mana when this card first attacks, giving your opponent effectively 6 or 7 mana available to them after the attack. 
---
Things classes will do a turn early that can disrupt your aggro game if you play this card against them:     
---
Druids will pull out Spreading Plague or a Saronite with a Tar Creeper.    
---
Hunters will Deathstalker Rexxar to wipe the board and gain 5 armour.    
---
Paladins, Spikeridged Steed to delay or Sunkeeper Tarim to win on the spot.      
---
Warriors have the Dr. Boom (7 armour) card, or can play one mana below curve and use their hero power.    
---
Priests will either Holy Fire, Psychic Scream, or play one mana below curve and use their hero power.      
---
Rogues don't get much advantage, except for a Blazecaller in some instances.    
---
Mages don't get much advantage, except for a Dragoncaller for hopefully a Ragnaros.     
---
Warlocks don't get much advantage.  
---
Shamans don't get much advantage.    
---
This analysis is done using the current top decks listed [here](https://disguisedtoast.com/meta_deck_rankings).
---
I legit thought it was a circle jerk meme made to look bad when I saw it.
---
I will always refer to Silence Priest as Unicorn Priest
---
It‚Äôs not different. Undatakah SHOULD resummon an Undatakah. The only time it won‚Äôt resummon as an Undatakah is if it goes dormant like Sherazin.
---
The difference between this card and the Undatakah is that Undatakah will summon a vanilla Undatakah meaning it‚Äôs just an 8/5 with no Deathrattles so it‚Äôll only trigger off the original where as this card has the Deathrattle printed on it so it keeps triggering as long as it‚Äôs above 5 attack. 
---
Immortal prelate, also give it taunt.
---
If they don't have a silence then you control the board for the rest of the game
---
8 mana 6-6 epic - Your minions with windfury have mega-windfury
---
Looks like Pokemon Boxarts
---
&gt;Wow, that is some leap of logic you're using there.
---
No, that is not what is "clearly" the case. Because, and I can't believe this has to be said: the Classic set often has a variety of cards that serve a variety of functions.   
---
You do realize you basically criticize his "leap of logic" and don't actually contradict it or point out why it might be wrong right?  
---
Neat
---
I‚Äôll be glad to get those hoppy bois out of storage. They‚Äôre shaping up to be better than jade Druid. 
---
No. Firefly gives you a flame elemental, not a firefly.
---
It's also not a spell. 
---
I‚Äôm the most dissapointed about warrior. Seems bombs are the only decent thing coming out of it.   
---
It‚Äôs a shame, cause I think if they gave it some help *ahem buff Boom‚Äôs scheme* Big Warrior could work.
---
Where do you get that from? He specifically mentions *Aggro* Token Druid and Ungoro even though the deck was Tier 2, and sometimes even Tier 1, during the K&amp;C meta before Witchwood.
---
Yeah rogues definitely needed a little help. Glad to see they got it.
---
So Dollmaster Dorian is good in this version.
---
It's basically a joke because people hate the Tron archetype in MTG. That archetype is all about assembling the 3 key cards that let you generate 7 mana on turn 3. So people tend to "assemble" the WOW FUCK TRON meme as three separate words. Often in three different comments for emphasis.

\[\[immortal prelate\]\] no need for battlecries
---
I feel honored
---
Honestly, I think a full on Control Warrior might be awesome again....they got some decent tools for it, and aggro across the board seems to be solid while most control decks are getting hit hard. Control Warrior has always fared well against aggro type decks. Fibonacci tweeted it as well, but he seems to agree.
---
&gt;I think the classic set is going to have a big influence here on archetypes.   
---
I'm personally not convinced they will necessarily shape archetypes but then again I don't often have enough cards to play around with design.  
---
Cards like Kill Command for example in a mid range deck don't shape the fact that it's mid range, it is just an awesome support card to the archetype itself (removal or face damage).  
---
Not sure how you would use that card as an example of how it would shape the archetpye of say midrange since it equally fits nicely into aggro or control? 
---
Can even drop this on a minion you're about to trade off the board anyways. Seems like the best rager we've ever gotten.
---
hearthstone - consistently inconsistent
---
Effects on the board are applied before effects in hand that reduce cost. This is why Naga Sea Witch sets cards to 5 mana, then Molten/Mountain Giant's effect sets their cost to 0.
---
8 mana 1/1 Hireek XD i guess the 8 cost pool is not the best drops anymore
---
GOLD JERRY, IT'S GOLD
---
Kind of, yeah. 
---
As a person who only plays Priest and nothing but Priest- I kind of rolled over the expansion Silence Priest was in full swing. I‚Äôve personally have never played Silence Priest before. But maybe I‚Äôll give it a try after trying to make a Hakkar Priest. 
---
Now Murloc Shaman I‚Äôm even more disappointed in. In every Rumble Run (or PvE where select from three different sets of three) I always try to make Totem Shaman work. Especially with the card that summons Al‚Äôkir or however you spell it. I want Totem Shaman to be viable. I might even switch classes for a year. 
---
We almost had Totem Shaman  with the 3,6 for 6 mana that gave your totems +2 attack on Inspire. Yes it was a little broken, but I want that idea back. 
---
Silence the adjacent minions. 
---
This is 3-mana give your minions +1/+1, draw a card. If a board based druid deck exists, this will see play 100%. Thinking this is bad is the same mistake people made when evaluating [[To my Side!]]. Bundling cards is op.
---
+1 spell power
---
Whenever you cast a spell gain +1 spell power until the end of turn
---
I'm excited to get this off of Neptulon and flood the board
---
Redundancy is funny
---
Are you sure? Wouldn't the mecathun still be on the battlefield?

6/-/- | Summon an Animal Companion, or 2 if your deck has no minions.  
---
I first heard it that way and had to go into another match to make sure I was hearing it wrong
---
Jeeves is just better for the deck than this card. It's really low tempo. Piloted shredder is much better tempo wise. Its basically the same card but plus 1 attack, and you basically draw a card and put it into play for free for the deathrattle, vs drawing 1 card. All of that for 1 more mana. 
---
The card that gets Northshire HOFd. Save your goldens!
---
Topsy turvy after that.
---
Its just annoying
---
If you're going to make nonsensical posts you can expect people to reply and call you on it.   
---
No need to get all childish and angry over it.  
---
Also you do realize by replying that you weren't going to reply you've already replied right?  
---
No way hunter has enough survivability and card draw to make mechathun viable, even if this is a pretty neat combo in theory, it would take hours of grinding to even get to the combo wombo turn
---
Completing the quest has never been the problem. Surviving is always the problem.
---
For instance this is why you don‚Äôt play 2 pyroblasts in aggro decks generally. It‚Äôs too many spells and you already have a ton of that. Quest rogue already has a ton of bounce effects 
---
Roll Tidal Surge*
---
Like, "choose a minion, Silence adjacent minions?" I assume that's real because I've heard Silence is a thing for Priest this expansion.
---
It's not your fault!
---
I guess if you use both spells, thought you meant only one.
---
But this windfury combo is more consistent, and has more value. Thats a fact
---
I had an idea without Malygos but with Vereesa and other spell damage:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b93op0/hunter_miracle_burn_deck_theorycraft/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
Looking simply at the power level of the cards on their own, I agree for sure.
---
[[Charge]] is a spell and a mechanic.
---
this card is OP. a 4 mana whatever big fucker you have on the board is good
---
Likely she'll would be mid-range with a turn 8 finisher.  26 damage is the dream but if you have chipped in some damage you can probably get away with 12 or so
---
It‚Äôs a quote from gamepedia, supposed to be tongue in cheek. Guess I could have picked a better one.
---
Really ain't that interesting. It only summons copies of itself, so unlike Patron it can't go "infinite" as well. Even if it does the reward for setting up a whirlwind/inner rage combo seems very low. It doesn't seem really good in arena either because it's a 7 Mana 3/5.
---
It would have, but Blizzard very rarely goes back to old keywords, so it's surprising that they did
---
I feel like it *might* be an *okay* cost, if it had an additional keyword or at least a tribe. 
---
Do they each take damage if you have multiple out?
---
are you saying that *this* card in any way has an insane effect or is even remotely likely ever to need nerfing? Because there's just no way.
---
A crappy card that draws another crappy card is not good. And for the record, To My Side was played very little, and not a top tier deck.
---
They could literally remove druid from the game and it'd still find a way to be a pretty competitive class
---
Archmage Antonidas
---
Sick maymays
---
Thanks, I didn't know how to do that. 
---
Yeah that enrages me.
---
What the fuck, Blizzard, Earthen Might is only 2 mana and won't rotate for a year. This plus this plus Walking Fountain is gonna suck.
---
Same here same here
---
Very true. I originally experimented with Evocation in a Amalgam Murloc mage, but I always felt it needed a solid two mana elemental. Too bad Aluneth, the murlocs, and the other cheap elementals are rotating out. The elemental package did seem pretty strong in practice, and you didn't really even have to do any activations. Just dropping a 1 mana tar creeper was generally pretty nice.
---
AHHHH thx ! :) 
---
I meant RoS of course, sorry cannot edit the title on mobile :(.
---
All I see is normal bronze man. 
---
The outline is there in the screenshot though if you look carefully.
---
3 mana Hunter minion ‚úîÔ∏è
---
You still have to play the quest on 1 instead of tidecaller which was always the problem 
---
Only 90s kids will understand the reference.
---
Yeah, I could be wrong, but I am not disenchanting any copies of this baby.
---
My prediction is that this will get nerfed to cost 2 mana eventually.
---
ah ok my bad didnt realize how weird it sounded. thx
---
oh yeah i was thinking about it maybe i could have both 
---
Lol the first person in this thread actually trying to have a discussion and not losing their minds over a pointless keyword. Especially when this is going to be a very relevant card as shaman‚Äôs main heal for the next 2 years.
---
Some possible awesome synergy with soup vendor too
---
I always hear him say "You fucking insect!" 
---
!RemindMe 6 months was this nerfed?
---
It's part of it. Cards like call to arms, minibot, mysterious challenger, anyfin are also part of why you'd want to run an aggressive paladin that's not baku
---
Who invited the Kobold?
---
I can't believe this... Just earlier today I had a shower thought randomly at work that Dr. Boom and Togwaggle kinda remind me of Junkrat and Roadhog... :D
---
I guess they want to make those lifesteal dryads a thing
---
Man they're really pushing spell hunter... I fucking hate it. 
---
I want you to use all your powers, and all your skills... I don‚Äôt want Ben Brode to see him like this...
---
Brann, kaleidosaur +3 +3 +3 +3 +3 windfury stealth divine shield +3 +3, this.
---
Not a single decent option for shaman. "Here! have some more murlocs and get deleted for 4 more months! gg"
---
RemindMe! 6 months "was this nerfed?"
---
An even more flexible forbidden healing at that, it‚Äôs gonna be a very good card especially since shaman doesn‚Äôt have any other heal any more
---
Neutral Minion: Tower Giant, 30 cost epic card
---
8/8 which reads: costs one less for each card you‚Äôve drawn this game
---
Born under a bad sign?
---
Not that I fully disagree, but it's 3 turns earlier, warlock hand size is less of an issue, it heals you, and gives you +3/3 in stats (potentially counterbalanced by how many enemy minions are on board)
---
But if you play it after  Halazzi, that's like 20 lynxes. 
---
No 
---
I know, right? With this card, *we could have played Finja on turn five*! Think of all the possibilities!
---
All joking aside, I am going to have a lot of fun in Wild with my murloc deck.
---
You enjoy your boring cards while I play with ALL THE CARDS IN WILD HAHAHA (gets killed by Big Priest again)
---
ahh i gotcha. so we would need to bundle this with the prelate in order to make him stick forever
---
You could try to make a miracle draw with Halazzi + Arcane Fletcher. Also if you get Vereesa in time you could start the burn with Gadgetzan Auctioneer + rapid fire/ arcane shot at 10 mana.
---
We're overdue for a Giant, but that's ridiculously weak. No way it's real.
---
You can't target your own minions with the scheme

7/7/8 | Taunt Battlecry: Replace your hand and deck with Legendary minions.  
---
This is just a major facet of card games in general. It fluctuates over time in how prominent and extreme it is, but there's nothing inherently wrong with it.
---
I don't care, I'm totally digging all the new shuffle cards. 
---
Jesus. Could you have any more value increments lol 
---
I mean Steel Rager was the best so far and it's pretty okay. Shadow Rager was fine too.
---
I, I don‚Äôt like this 
---
One ‚Äúget down‚Äù was already used, and could have tested with the owl anyway. 
---
Regardless, everyone was sleeping during that stream until he missed it though. 
---
Looks really good!
---
I'd hardly call Rotten Applebaum "mediocre." If you got a bunch of cards that healed 5 to instantly resummon Lucentbark turn for turn without effort, I'm pretty sure Blizzard would've thought twice about printing it.
---
Heal Druid doesn't need to literally win off of healing, it's not like discard where you have to build an entire deck around it to justify running it. Healing is an element of control that is good for a class like Druid that attacks most of its foes. Just like how "Handlock" doesn't win off of having a big hand, it's just control warlock that can slam a Mountain Giant early. So don't think of Heal Druid as "Heal a lot to win" because that's not going to happen. Heal Druid is really just a control shell with a healing core, and it's your job to fill in the blanks.
---
2 mana heal 4  
---
4 mana heal 8  
---
6 mana heal 12  
---
8 mana heal 16  
---
10 mana heal 20
---
None of these sound great but this looks like a card that will be good just because of how flexible it is and also because what other options does shaman have with Healing Rain cycling?
---
also I'm curious what a wild control shaman would run for healing between this healing rain and healing wave
---
we must go deeper
---
So Vanguard, Prelate, Villain = Giant Dreadsteed?
---
Now THIS is a fucking Murloc!
---
Yet Arfus is still a Beast and had no similar changes.
---
The advantage of Giants is cheating them out fast. A Giant that can't even be played till you've drawn 15 or 20 cards is useless. I'd price it somewhere from 14-20 if it were me.
---
Fungal Enchanter?? Not sure if better or worse
---
I see in your post history that seems to be your "go to" post when you're backed into a corner and made to look foolish.

Solo adventures, so I hope, will be non-collection cards only for all futures. Also that applies to only long term players. I just checked the highest Winrate decks on HSreplay and I own around 10cards per deck, before dusting anything. I doubt Ill make much use of that...

I remember how much shit people gave Ben Brode over purify, good times...

I just want to know what he's doing with that extension cord.

This is an excellent card.  I won't be crafting it on day one, but I really hope I pack it.

Am I going crazy or is this totally malygos on a small body for any control deck??
---
It looks really bad. Like a screenshot from WoW.
---
You think, shaman with one minion on the board can play windfury and then this and that minion gets 4 attacks. 
---
How about Hunter legendary 7mana 5/8 equip a 2/3 weapon which gives you +2 spelldamage this turn

---
Yeah I am marginally disappointed by the Murloc Shaman and lack of neutral/Paladin Dragons.

The main thing I'm annoyed by, though, is actually that Warlock didn't get a new Discard synergy.
---
It was so, so close to being a truly good archetype in standard... but nope. Now its just garbo... again.

---
Im honestly shocked this is not a legendary.
---
Not true at all. Doomhammer has been VERY viable, and even Windfury Harpy/Stormcaller saw a lot of play recently due to Corpsetaker.
---
It feels a bit overdesigned, but I guess that's what Legendaries are there for, right? Still, I'll say it's fake. 
---
I find it unlikely that blizzard didn't already intend to release more good silence targets within the next few expansions.
---
Honestly this shit seems like a straw poll discussion, how much of the player base wants keywords vs not, Imo it would be a landslide in the direction of keeping keywords.
---
I‚Äôve never had such a physical reaction to a subject like this before, but hearing people use the canned ‚Äúbut newer players‚Äù line fucking hurts, I‚Äôve never met a new player who in anyway found keywords confusing, in fact the exact opposite is true. 
---
At what point can we agree that we shouldn‚Äôt remove keywords to accommodate what I‚Äôm sure is an extreme minority (new players who are extremely illiterate)
---
HS imo is already such a fucking easy game to pick up.
---
So you're saying Malygos double mind blast is a 4 mana combo?
---
That sounds like a lot lol
---
Now where's that bingo card, Rager has got to be a point!
---
Yeah, but unlike the other Echo cards, this will be Standard legal after April 2020.
---
This is worthless in mech hunter
---
I gaurentee you now the Decks they push now are not the ones that will be on top in a month. Yes people will use them as a base but as always the most innocent looking card will probably be Broken by a deckbuilder and most T1 decks we won't see coming. After all "Shudderwock was a bit of fun" they said "The Restrictions are to high on Genn &amp; Baku" they said.

I always thought a good way to nerf Doomguard would be to have him gain Charge only if you discarded 2 cards with him. This would mean that he would no longer work nearly as well in Recruit decks.
---
Priest cards are far from bonkers. Everyone's overhyping the resurrect cards because of Big Priest's stupidity in Wild and Wall/Clone in Standard. But both decks are basically in wild now, and resurrection's hard if they can only do it on turns 8 and above, now without spirit lash and psychic scream. The other cards they got are pretty niche.
---
FINALLY 
---
Oh yes you totally made me look foolish!
---
I'm so scared of an obnoxious knob who thinks they're intellectual on /r/hearthstone!
---
You showed me!
---
If you don't play wild, go for it.
---
Waggle pick is not a dead card, and it gets drawn with raiding party
---
I am aware, but the presence of a keywords rather than just explaining what that keyword does on the card still makes the card more complex than it would be otherwise.
---
Hm?
---
[[Counterspell]] has the keyword ‚Äúcounter‚Äù which is only seen on that one card.
---
Broken as shit
---
&gt; A crappy card that draws another crappy card is not good.

Faceless Rager will be a 5/3 most of the time on curve, and I'm not sure if a 3 Mana 5/3 would be played nowadays.
---
Portal Keeper is literally a worse Fal'dorei Strider.

Actually, technically it IS fake.  Its a 7 mana 5/6.

Also, you should try to post actual fake cards.

Hey, a good replacement for [[tortollan shellraiser]] in my horrible [[Lady in white]] deck
---
So what? 
---
Wild Quest Shaman will unleash! Set the Hungry Crabs!!
---
This is how card games work. They're not gonna come out with completely new archetypes every single time, and they shouldn't. And even when they revisit or continue to support archetypes they've already done, context is everything. The most recent Token Druid was significantly different from the Aggro Token Druid before. Same with Secret Paladin. Murloc Shaman hasn't been viable in years if ever. Same with Silence Priest.
---
Also, in regards to there only being two dragons for Paladin this set, if you're suggesting they should have printed more, that's pretty much the *opposite* of how archetypes should be supported. They shouldn't be forced in a single expansion, especially when there's a foundation already laid from previous sets.
---
Witch's Brew I think is the name. 2 mana Shaman spell with text: "Restore 4 health. Repeatable this turn."
---
Cubelock runs a lot of low-Cost minions to get through the early game.
---
But... But it's Hagatha themed! Couldn't they use echo as a "call back"?
---
I will summon this girl, next turn playing knife juggler, value muster, then top deck shredder, coining challenger. The perfect cuuuurve!
---
Possibly. You have Tracking and Subject 9 to filter 5 secrets, then may be Zuljin to replay the trackings. 
---
I think another question is if Hunter can survive long enough with Deathstalker Rexxar.

---
DAT'S NO PUN IF I E'ER SEEN ONE!!!
---
It's pretty good that baku rotated because baku Hunter with vereesa and two of these would have some big reach
---
You do you OP, and if you preorder I hope you enjoy it. For me, I still have no desire to preorder because it still just seems like another new set without any actual substanitive changes to the game. I like new cards as much as the next guy and am hyped to play, but I just don't want to keep paying for a game that hasn't had a serious update in years.
---
We still have  Spectral Cutlass. 
---
I think pirate rogue would prefer the weapon that gives rush. It synergises with ticket scalpers. 
---
I actually didn't realize this couldn't go face at first. I was thinking of it as essentially like a Knife Juggler, but the guaranteed minion hit actually does make it a lot better IMO.
---
There‚Äôs warpath from Witchwood
---
Darkkmane‚Äôs ‚Äúhow to play hearthstone‚Äù
---
What a Hybrid. But it's just better again than the Normal one.
---
I'm not talking about Witchwood Token Druid. Aggro Token Druid was Tier 2, and sometimes Tier 1, into K&amp;C. It was definitely viable beyond Ungoro that year.
---
1 mana, 1 mana, 1 mana. This card is 3 mana do little. Way too much tempo to give up.
---
Wager? The card shown today is terrible, and will not see a significant play in standard. 
---
I fully agree with Recruit not being necessary to revive as a keyword.
---
Other examples like Echo I take some issue with. There was a synergy card with Echo that would otherwise not work with "Repeatable this turn." If you don't intend to keep a keyword around forever, don't make one synergy card that specifically uses the keyword.
---
This isn't uncommon. They hardly ever push only one archetype at a time.
---
Heck, check out Rastakhan's Rumble. For every single Loa and Champion bundle with the sole exception of Shaman, they push different archetypes. Hir'eek was about hand buffing/sacrifice, whereas Jeklik was about discard. Shirvallah was about Spells, whereas Thekal was about healing.
---
I don't think it's strange for Blizzard to push two different archetypes each class at all. And I certainly think it's better to do it like this than to go all-in on one archetype. You don't want to overdo it and make an archetype *too* powerful in one fell swoop.
---
Which is very possibly what they've done with Secret Paladin. Desperate Measures, No Surrender, Commander Rhyssa, and Mysterious Blade... but also Sunreaver Spy. That is a *heck* of a lot of support for the archetype.
---
love how they hid merlock shaman till the very end
---
They fixed the problems from the first reveal stream and I kind of feel sorry for the first reveal crew.  The intro was cut in half, down from 15 to 7 minutes.  The community manager shut up during the games and let the two experts talk.  There were no technical glitches.  There were more cards to reveal.  Kibler didn't ask what he should play, he just played so some turns were faster.
---
When did they say that?
---
This was a custom card that Trump reviewed before the expansion was revealed. I really doubt it's real.
---
&gt;In the entire history of Hearthstone only a single windfury card has ever been viable (alakir)

I you
---
Doomguard would also be summoned with the ability to hit face if you drew it with Betrug on board. If you have the mana to play the one you drew that's like drawing 10 damage. Definitely understandable why they rotated it, on top of the fact that it's just been such a defining class staple/finisher for pretty much the whole games life.
---
[[Plot Twist]]
---
Dust 
---
Yeah ok, you're clearly a little angry here.   
---
I suggest taking a break from reddit, maybe even the internet as a whole and just chilling out a little.  It's not healthy to get so worked up over being called out on flawed posts you've made.  
---
Hope you feel better soon!  
---
I thought the exact same thing when I first saw this card. Looks like I‚Äôll be riding secret pala to its gold portrait next. 
---
That doesn't mean they only got one archetype. Especially when Resurrect, no matter how "inherent" it may seem or feel, is based so strongly on the cards Priest are given in that specific rotation.
---
Well, you don‚Äôt know what we can find! Why don‚Äôt you come along with me little girl, on a magic carpet ride! 
---
Very CLEVER!! And it don't need mana reduction. I think you crafted a new meta before it get started.
---
I only offered suggestions - who knows if this thing will even slot into any real meta decks unless there's significant things that take advantage of it.

2/-/- | Shuffle your hand into your deck. Draw that many cards.  
---
No card can be printed to make this guy better so dust
---
Its all fun and games until you get both goblin prank and mechathun with your tracking, and realise that this is way worse than just hero powering your opponent to death
---
And ridiculous deck thinning once you've got Mechathun in hand...
---
It will get played off of elemental generators like the Shaman 2/2.  It's a low roll result.
---
I wish you best of luck with your pre-order packs.
---
 If you're somewhat of a budget player, I recommend not spending to much during the first 2 weeks on experimental decks and instead saving some dust for a meta deck when the meta is figured out so that you have something viable for ladder to finish quests and grind gold for the second expansion later this year.
---
step 1 play minions and bounce them back to your hand
---
step 2 concede because you're playing quest rogue in wild
---
Wait a second someone had the same idea as me or did I watch that vid and forgot about it ü§î 
---
I mean, actually, it would be 15 raptors on a single magic carpet, as you only played 1.
---
Lady in white?
---
Would have to happen in one turn. Coins are bad cards to give your opponent if your long-term plan is to mill value. Coins can always be dumped and also help them dump other cards.
---
Yeah but for what‚Äôs posted you do
---
ROFL
---
 brainless aggro players at it again
---
Nice armchair psychology. I recommend you don't try to look into other people's psyche so much without reflecting on why you'd insert yourself into a conversation with such asinine and frivolous comments before choosing to high horse over someone else.
---
That shows either an insecurity or a dangerously undeserved ego.
---
Hope you get that cleared up soon!
---
If you re-arrange his name it spells "Annd me rip" which was probably what went through his mind at the time.
---
I hope Morrigan starts seeing some play. She isn't even really a bad card, just in the wrong class. Putting her in Priest would've made Big Priest even more disgusting, and she honestly could've made Big Warrior work too.
---
Yeah but if we‚Äôre talking about standard, that‚Äôs not really relevant anymore. This is the only heal shaman has after rotation, and if the control-y shaman archetype that blizzard seems to be pushing is going to work, this card will see play, if only just out of virtue of necessity.
---
Personally it‚Äôs really not that bad imo because of how flexible it is and how it‚Äôs much more targetable for maintaining your board. Plus soup vendor might actually get a chance to shine with this card, so I‚Äôm optimistic. Honestly I think the majority of people are down on this card more because they‚Äôre upset about it not being echo for some reason than because they actually hate the effect. 
---
wow sorry didnt see your comment. Is not a good deck, because I don't wanna craft good cards for this archetype yet, waiting for new expansion. Here's the deck, I lose more than win cause hunters, I steal they low cost minions... xD Copy paste, i have the game in spanish.

Slow druid decks need a degenerate combo that wins them the game to be playable, theres no control druid. Seriously try building a non token deck and look how fucking terrible it is. 
---
he's wrong, but not wooshably so.
---
Not reliable though is it? We'll see it on Trolden but not on the ladder a month from now.
---
I believe Silence Priest is the other archtype they wanted.
---
Or just double [[Blessed Champion]]
---
Its not bad with silence priest no?
---
Oh yeah, i didn't realize you can keep doubles of both. I guess you can earn 10 dust per common, but you are locking yourself out of 400 dust until rotation. 
---
You forgot step #6: Remember you are in Wild and your Kingsbane Rogue opponent already killed you 4 turns ago...
---
Paladin in WoW, D&amp;D, and in fantasy generally is capable of being both an aggressive power house, healer and support, and defender of the weak. Even then, the only real aggressive cards Paladin got are Mysterious Blade, a conditional weapon, and Sunreaver Spy, a neutral minion. 
---
Everything else has either been value oriented like the Dragon synergies or defensive like Never Surrender!.

5/-/- | Double a minion's Attack.  
---
That's usually the case, I would say, it's just that this time the archetypes are clear-cut and have support in the set. They will get more support later, but stuff like Dragon Paladin definitely looks playable already, it's not just one synergy card added that will only become relevant in six months.
---
As much as they should just use the damn keyword, this is sick for Arena.
---
Why do you think this is a bug?
---
It's cause when you fight him in wow he is like 300 ft tall and attacks you while on a flying platform
---
Imagine if Dirty Rat and Cornered Sentry were still in standard. You could theoretically curve them into a 3 mana 5/6
---
1-drop minions that generate another 1-drop minion are worlds apart from an overcosted buff card that generates another overcosted buff card, not really an apt comparison imo.
---
I like everything about this card except it's name
---
Kibler was an old MTG pro. He is in the Hall of Fame of MTG (the physical card game). He was also featured in MTG Arena for an event around big creatures
---
Well Overload was there original and key defining mechanic. But they realized that unless they just made the overload cards waaaaay ahead of statline, the mechanic was too punishing. That's literally how we ended up with some of HS's all time most problematic cards, ala tunnel trogg, Totem Golem, and 477. (thought admittedly 477 was more meme than broken)
---
Oof.
---
Absolutely crafting this golden day 1.
---
Just wait and see what you open from your preorder, imo. You might not need to spend all of your gold on packs.
---
The adventure will cost 2800 gold, so you'll have some left over anyway.
---
It wooshed right over me can you explain? 
---

5 Mana 3 5 legendary your end of turn effects trigger at the start of your tyrn
---
It makes no sense to keyword a mechanic on a single card in a set unless it's evergreen or some outlier like Mega-Windfury on that new card they revealed today. The entire point of set keywords (as opposed to evergreen keywords) is to highlight a major mechanical element of the set while also simplifying it and allowing for certain cards to directly reference it when necessary.
---
You're not simplifying a mechanic on a single card if there are no other instances of or references to that card in the set. Meanwhile, you're setting up questions that have no obvious answer for players who aren't aware of why this one card in the set is keyworded.
---
People are confused by seemingly simple stuff all the time in this game as evidenced by the nearly daily threads asking questions about them. Just because you're not one of them or don't know any of them doesn't mean they don't exist, especially in a game with an audience this huge. I don't see how this can "fucking hurt" you.
---
But... they already do! xD 
---
Nice name
---
Rush wasn't a thing when that change was made. If they want to make that change as well as the Cleave change, they might as well revamp the older sets. I'd be perfectly fine with that, but Blizzard would see it as a waste of money.
---
I'd need to try find the card (wasn't a secret either), it was from wild so I didn't know the card.  
---
Was playing Warlock in the recent brawl and had it happen about 30 minutes before reading this thread which is what made me think this when I read this thread.  
---
Well all 4 cards you said are from different classes. If you wanna win a lot, part of the game is knowing what you‚Äôre playing against and baiting it. 
---
Are you implying that u/HeadWright is not prepared?
---
I am tired and brooookennnn
---
[¬øPor qu√© no los dos?](https://i.imgur.com/c7NJRa2.gif)

That seems kinda pointless and terrible. Maybe if it was an Epic printed in KnC, but I seriously doubt they'd print something like that today, certainly not a Legendary.
---
r/customhearthstone
---
Having a only one card with a particular keyword in a Standard format is not good design. It's awkward, especially for new players, especially when what the keyword does can be expressed on the card without taking too much card space.
---
Shockwave sounds too much like what a Shaman would do though.
---
Also great in Handlock. 7 mana, play a drake with 7+ health and then this? Or if your mountain giant lives then on turn 5 you can do something with 2 mana and play this as a 3 mana 5/8? Yikes.
---
That makes sense to me
---
First is real, except it also has Windfury. 8 mana 4/8 Rush, Lifesteal, Windfury.
---
Second I only changed a bit from the real one so you‚Äôre not too far off there. It‚Äôs 10 mana Summon 2 copies of a minion in your deck.
---
Third is real
---
Fourth is fake, I did a bad job with that one haha. There is a 6 mana Twinspell: Summon a 5/5 with Rush
---
This is not even close to as good as corridor creeper. 
---
Divine Favor, Secrets, and Small minions being buffs are Paladin's core identity. Control OTK is a tertiary theme at best.
---
This is insanely good.  The attack buff is permanent, not this turn only.
---
if you complete the quest earlier then you survive earlier.
---
quest rogue survives by flipping quest and making an army.
---
Why are we talking about druid?
---
I have too many cards!
---
&gt;but this is the last response from me here.  
---
Hey, come on pal. At least start sticking behind your own statements eh? This is the second time you've stated you won't post I believe yet here you are replying again.  
---
&gt;. I recommend you don't try to look into other people's psyche so much without reflecting on why you'd insert yourself into a conversation with such asinine and frivolous comments before choosing to high horse over someone else.  
---
I'm just concerned over why anyone would get so irrationally angry over comments in thread as opposed to just addressing them civilly and maturely and discuss them out.  
---
I've noted in the past you've had no issue doing so thus I can only conclude that you know you are wrong and are acting out as a result of not being able to accept your error in this case.  
---
It's ok to be wrong buddy, it's ok! 
---
People would kill that thing on sight though (or just kill you), so it wouldn't happen too often.
---
It's a video game, they can hover over the card. Also, Rush is still going to be in Standard on a single card after Boomsday rotates, so that argument doesn't even work.
---
Mah blade be thirsty
---
Call back card 4 mana 3/3 your opponent's spells cost 5 more next turn legendary 
---
Okay that's what I figured, but you never know. Thanks for answering
---
The entire adventure costs 2800 gold? Does that include the golden Zayle and packs or is that only in the $$$ version? If you have the source of this info I can answer my own questions which is probably best.
---
If you have [[Harbinger Celestia]] you can safely dust that, probably. It's incredibly easy to play around and won't see play much.
---
That would be the boldest move ever.
---
I love it
---
Very similar to zereks cloning master, and that card didn‚Äôt see play. I like this stat line and cost better but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs amazing
---
April fools?

---

---
&gt; draw a card
---
It is not "draw a card". Draw a card would mean you could get a number of answers - that's not the case
---
You don't need villain for that combo.
---
&gt; Also, also - how long do you guys think it will be before they put Alex and Maly in wild?
---
The general consensus I've heard is that when the next rotation arrives, Maly will probably rotate (probably accompanied by Alex and any other troublesome Dragon Legendaries; that will be the end of the 'Year of the Dragon'.
---
you hover over the card and the game literally tells you what it does
---
we need to stop treating new players like toddlers
---
So true. Hunter got shafted 
---
1. Play Electra
---
2. Play Eureka to summon 2x Blood of the Ancient One
---
3. End turn
---
4. ???

Dude I swear they change these cards after I read them or I have word dyslexia or something.

Not when it runs into a Barnes and 1/1 Obsidian Statue by Big Priest, or 8/8 Giants from Even Warlock or Barnes to Yshaarj to  10/10 Yshaarj in Master Call Hunter, gets Devolved by Even Shaman, Sapped by Rogues.  
---
It requires 2 cards and 6 Mana compared to the above being only 1 and 4 Mana.
---
None of those are crappy cards
---
You‚Äôre right!  So it would.. multiply?! Undertaker hydra?

Damn, thats actually hard to beat.
---
I still don't know how tunnel trogg escaped getting nerfed. Most broken card ever printed in HS in my opinion.
---
Remember when this battlecry was legendary worthy?
---
Everyone in this thread saying "worse Flamewanker" over and over don't understand how powerful guaranteeing to hit minions is. It's why Dynomatic is nutty. 
---
Not to mention these cards have quite different uses. I'm not certain what the list will look like that this finds itself in. But it will find its place somewhere. 
---
It's something I often forget too. I've watched many streamers get lethal or push big damage by silencing frozen dudes and I still often forget 
---
Frost wolf commanders big sister
---
He isn‚Äôt kidding? There is a trump streamer and he has good tutorials (albeit outdated? But basics and principles are still somewhat applicable) also, firebat is an enjoyable streamer and has one of the best editors in yt.
---
Also for packs, wait until the rotation (some of the cards will be unplayable in standard) and if you want to play competitively i‚Äôd say wait for a couple of weeks before crafting cards (unless you want to try them out and just have fun)
---
That is bananas with bananas

---
One less sap for my other big cards.
---
For every counterfactual, there is a counterplay. My combo is still awesome. :)
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not that intuitive to figure out tbh I always forget 
---
I don't have Shirvallah so never played it. I've only ever seen it a handful of times, and they've always been combo decks (Shirvallah -&gt; Baleful Banker -&gt; Holy Wrath or similar). Maybe that's unusual, but it's not exactly a common matchup. Virtually all Paladins in Wild are Odd, Anyfin or Secret.
---
I never standard anymore though, so based on your comment maybe it's common in control decks there?
---
Wisps of the Old Gods had options, this doesn't
---
Nah it's definitely closer to 3 when you look at cards like [[Scarlet Crusader]], [[Crackling Razormaw]], [[Silvermoon Guardian]], etc. This technically makes smaller minions like [[Argent Squire]] overstatted but that's cause they're generally played early where divine shield is less useful

Overload is not abandoned, it‚Äôs just not really a prominent feature. Not enough to flesh out the identity at least
---
Probably due to the order

Would like to hear your reasoning for Faceless Rager and Soldier of Fortune. Other than that, I don't know why you have zero spell damage AND playing Unexpected Results...
---
Dont really even need the second coldblood tbh
---
good movie. turned out better than Us, however i wasn't disappointed in the film overall. 
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt see the cards released today lol
---
Odd mage?
---
Technically no but you're just being pedantic, it still feels very similar to an OTK. Honestly, it usually feels worse to get hit with divine spirit inner fire for the loss than most OTKs because it can come out sooner if they get really lucky
---
A lot of those cards you mentioned are rotating.
---
Im pretty sure that Wild exists so that blizzard doesnt have to worry about rediculous synergies in standard when balancing. Otherwise we wouldn't have rotations at all. Doubt they care much since its effectively a banlist disguised as a gamemode.
---
Should I disenchant cards rotating out from Year of the Mammoth now so I can get enough dust for these gold cards?
---
Battlecry: Set your opponents Weapon to 1 attack?
---
This one's art is cooler and they needed to fill one more epic slot. 
---
Yeah, but it cheapens the Witchwood mechanic if they can just make cards at any time that do the same thing, but don't use the keyword.
---
It would be like if one expansion they made minions that your opponent had to attack or they couldn't attack anything else, only instead of calling it "taunt", they called it "defender", just for this one expansion.  Wow, new keyword, "defender"! Much hype!
---
Already angry because I know I‚Äôll get 5 of these within my first 15 packs.
---
Now this is the kind of card that may be worth trying to get off eureka
---
In review: you‚Äôll be approximately 50% happy
---
His favorite book? Storm of swords 
---
I can't wait to see this guys golden art.
---
That's pretty arbitrary.
---
Maybe Nefarian to Paladins so those Dragon synergy cards get some use?
---
I really hope we get to see all villains this year, like Kel'thuzad.
---
might as well tho. 
---
14 Mana 3 cards clear your opponents board only if only one minion has less than 5 attack and it doesn't have taunt is downright ass actually
---
I am glad to see them use this keyword for a second time. 
---
Reddit: Super powerful decks that control the meta are not fun and interactive
---
Also reddit: Why didn't they give this deck cards that would have made it super powerful and meta controlling
---
I give it 5 stars. Hellfire is already a good card. This adds a 3/7 taunt for 3 mana on top of that 
---
We still have quartz elemental
---
I just gotta say I love the thematic part of all this stuff. Mages, defend dalaran! Summon the statues to fight!! 
---
Haha yup you're totally right on that one lol
---
Yes, we do.
---
Depends on order of play
---
Millhouse first: your opponent's spells cost 5
---
Loatheb first: your opponent's spells cost 0
---
Because all they do is netdeck, They have no imagination. This is the perfect candidate that may be cheated out
---
Everyone knows that the Lady in White is always one of the last five cards in your deck.
---
Odd pally
---
Azerite elementals exist in WoW. Though in the game they're not as yellow as this artwork. 
---
You forgetting all the cards they're printing that utterly fuck resurrect or...?
---
She doesn't look like a pirate. Edwin Van Cleef looks more like a pirate but he's also not a pirate. Don't judge cards by their looks.
---
ITT: People who overrate the power level of playing secrets turn 1. I personally think this will see play in secret pally but won't be OP at all, as pally would almost always rather play a 1-drop so this isn't as insane on-curve as it looks.
---
Even with all the nerfs?  And board clears on curve?  I‚Äôm a rank 22 player so I don‚Äôt know crap about the game.  Could someone explain to an idiot like me why this would be op?
---
Turn two evocation sof(most underrated card in the set) turn 3 faceless that's two 5/6s. Mana reservoir and azerite elemental both have spell damage.
---
Yeah I honestly don‚Äôt understand how they can hype something up like this so much and then just never talk about it? I mean unless this was for the legendary that they‚Äôre giving out to everyone, but they never once mentioned this video in the IGN article.
---
Ya. Lol. Like 3 or 4 cards just definited a possible meta outta nowhere.
---
That's literally not the only reason for keywords to exist in Hearthstone.
---
They exist, much for the same reason as they do in other card games, to reduce overall complexity as well. Typically, when you apply short hand to the name of something, it's meant to shorten it and/or group it with similar things that you'll be dealing with or referring to often. But if you apply sort hand to something you almost never deal with or refer to, the short hand becomes an added barrier.
---
It doesn't matter that you can click on the card and see what the keyword means. Mechanics aren't keyworded just to reduce text, they're keyworded to group similar cards together to reduce overall complexity. There are no similar cards in this set to Witch's Brew. Next year, there more than likely won't be similar cards in all of Standard. At that point, keywording this only *adds* complexity where there's no need. There's plenty of space on the card and the effect is pretty easy to understand. Nothing is gained from keywording it.
---
Fill your opponent hand wtih coins and then play two of those both players draw two cards from mage
---
I see most are thinking wild with this, but come on,  where's my Standard players at? :) Wild can't have all the fishy fun.
---
Not just kill some stuff. If your opponent has 3 minions with a combined attack of 9 or less this will straight up win you the game. And that's a pretty legit scenario, token decks will have to see Linecracker as a taunt against Shamans.
---
Not really. Its just save till next expansion and buy a bunch of packs so you can sort of keep up with  everyone else. The game gives you enough coins through quests and stuff to where you can get enough packs to make a good deck with the extra essence you get with the cards. Theres a video on it on youtube. 
---
Until now, finding a way to use the card was a problem. 
---
Heh. Problem solved.
---
I don‚Äôt got a deck but I plan on making some sort of token Druid with heals
---
It seems to me the distinction between  being able to clear 3 health and 4 is pretty big?  
---
Not a lot of 3 health minions late, most will be 4+.   Idk, it just seems like that 1 extra damage on the aoe is kind of an important damage. 
---
I'm more inclined tho try it with shooting star though.   
---
Buddy hate to tell you but millennials are look old now. I own a car and a house and have a job and please help me
---
Combos nicely into the new rager
---
There is also Tanglefur mystic and that one Drakkari card.
---
Not quite the same since Shambler has taunt and copies both stats, but it definitely can be a solid midrange threat in the right deck like silence priest or maybe a new Handlock.
---
Fuck big priest, this is beauty.
---
They said they wouldn't have one this expansion so..
---
So what age is considered warm?
---
Blizzard confirmed it will work.

"Just like last year, you will be able to keep your copies of these card once they move to the Hall of Fame, and you‚Äôll also be granted the full Arcane Dust value for each card (up to the maximum number that can be used in a deck). The dust will be automatically awarded once you log-in after the Year of the Dragon begins."
---
Cant wait for this to dominate ladder
---
Not only does that reduce the variance so one player isn't raging most of the time, it also makes it do nothing if they have no minions so it can't SMOrc. So much better balanced I love it 
---
Yea, this one just looks kinda like Infinity Edge
