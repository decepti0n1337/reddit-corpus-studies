I'm genuinely curious. Did people not know what was happening before the NBA or Blizzard situation? It had been on the frontpage of /r/all at least a handful of times. Plus it has been covered by the news in my country. I think the reason it gets so much traction now is that people feel there's an actual way for them to show their support for HK. 
---

---
It's been difficult helping HK, because no country or even company is in a position to stand up to them in a way that matter. Hopefully on a long term basis, with enough people caring we'll see things shift more rapidly. I think in a small degree we have seen it happening in some areas, but it's not as easy as "don't do business with China" for every company or country.

---
He's been answering random questions in his twitch chat. I don't think there were rooms for PR help. Also he sounded very genuine.
---
I saw your blue demon stripping. Noice!
---
China is just turning into one big season of Black Mirror.
---
"Today is Hong Kong independence..." Once again a slippery slope argument.
---
You're arguing the potentiality of more demands refutes his current demands.
---
"But sure, 'wHy dOn'T bLiZzArD jUsT sAy fUcK yOu cHinA, fReE hOnG kOng'. Life is that simple when you don't think about anything for more than 3 seconds before going on a moral crusade"
---
Once again a straw man argument. You take legitimate demands, reduce them to the point it's non reflective of his point of view then attack it.
---
You do realize it's possible to argue a point without logical fallacies right?
---
&gt;Well yeah because the end is the same. Either they don't release their game in China that has gay characters
---
You found the right answer!
---
Either your morals are resolute or they are up for sale. Blizzard's are up for sale.
---
&gt;as for the "lgbtq promotion when its profitable" part
---
It's an insult to everyone who actually fought for it to be acceptable in the west. That's why it's loathsome. Civil rights aren't something that should be embraced only when it's "hip" or profitable. You believe in them and their importance or you don't.
---
The hive mind is those who assume that every single person in North America is up in arms regarding this whole thing. 
---
I may be wrong, but from what I've seen over the last few days, people on Reddit seem to think the entire population of the Americas is ready to drop this company in its entirety. 
---
That is not the case. Those who are up in arms about this are the vocal minority. But looking at Reddit it seems as though everyone believes it. That is a hive mind.
---
I don't think capitalism is to blame for wealth inequality.  I also don't think america is really a true capitalist society.  However, the parts of capitalism we do have, I believe, are detrimental to our society at this point in time.  
---
IMO, the idea that freedom of business will solve all problems that have value is not how this system will ever function.  The idea that greed is good is not something I can get behind.
---
That wasn't my point. My response to the original comment was that we shouldn't be COMPLETELY ignorant of the world's problems. If people need a break, of course it's reasonable and I am not blaming anyone for it.
---
Blizzard going on war with China, duh.
---
Yes I did. You were wrong. Sorry fam.
---
I was just making a factual statement, you are ignorant and selfish.
---
Nice try.  This shit is hours old- You’re pathetic scanning comment threads trying to spot anything you can to pounce on. Away with thee, Troll. Crawl under another bridge.
---
[removed]
---
I don't know where you're getting the idea that I am against a distraction or a break. I simply said, in response to the original post, that we shouldn't be completely ignorant of politics or pretend it doesn't exist.
---
Private Enterprise getting in bed with government *is* the endpoint for capitalism. That was Marx' entire point. That's why his book is called Dad Kapital.
---
All the communism stuff was just him spitballing. Economic fanfic. As far as his actual analysis goes, capitalism tends to aggregate capital, and at a certain point that capital corrupts functional government and you end up with fascism. Communism is a response to that process.
---
Until about 1985 or so he was spot fucking on.
---
Correct.  Google is just too dominant.  To the point where we very likely need federal intervention to deal with them.  You can't just boycott them.  They are within and behind so much of the digital infrastructure that you would seriously be hard pressed to disentangle them from your life, and the majority of people who are less tech-savvy would have no hope. 
---
The same way that back in the day, and even now, a boycott of Microsoft would be so difficult, because Windows is just a default for so many people in their lives and work.
---
It's not sticking. Pretty much everyone involved in streaming who has stepped down or has said they're no longer doing Blizzard stuff has stressed the same point. But pitchforkers gonna pitchfork.
---
Well, a ton of company can just not piss off the Chinese nor the Western part of the audience. It's pretty simple actually: 
---
You just censor it out from the Chinese feed, make an actual neutral tweet/comment or just don't comment on it, fire the casters as they did (because they were the ones dragging the company into this as they knew and endorsed it) and tell the player to not abuse their platform for his political beliefs next time and just to be sure, monitor the GM more closely.  
---
It's long, but it's not hard and pretty much a solved question. And the matches are on 45 min delay as an anti-cheat mechanism, so it's not like they can't spot it in time.
---
Truth
---
Capitalism is the sole reason as to why the western world is as rich as it is. Even the poorest people are rich in comparison to other parts. 
---
People who oppose capitalism dont care about the poor; they just hate the rich.
---
Get out of your hate bubble.
---
Most savage comment I’ve read
---
Yeah, I got the golden on my first run just by chance.  Not sure why they didn't have the rewards all listed out before hand.
---
Thanks. Was looking for this. This should be upvoted more.
---
Acitivision Blizzard is name of old Activision...
---
I honestly think that we are close to that reality.
---
There were questions asking him details about the movement like what does the slogan mean. He replied with "It would be too long of a lecture" and "I don't want to talk in details because you can Google it online and see for yourselves."
---
you're a dumbass dude.  I SPENT ALL THIS MONEY ON HS PACKS.. but im gonna disenchant everything..  Some stand bro.
---
&gt; A lot of awful stuff is happening every day all over the globe. There's ongoing genocides in Africa, atrocities in the middle east and China being awful isn't entirely new either.
---
&gt; 
---
I think part of the difference in reaction is that genocides in Africa are not going to impact Western lives. 
---
China's cultural war against Western/democratic moral values and forcing authoritarianism down everyone's throats will, and it already has, and will continue to escalate if left unchallenged.
---
It is the inevitable result of every system. So get a better argument against capitalism.
---
&gt; Of reproduction. We aren't talking about any other kind of reproduction aside from humans, where you require a fertilized egg to reproduce. 
---
Not initially. You just mentioned sex was for reproduction and you can't reproduce without particular sexual organs. I'm saying that that's not necessarily the case. But no matter, it wasn't particularly relevant in the first place.
---
&gt; You need a sperm, which is exclusively made by males, and an egg, which is exclusively produced by females, in order to create a human. 
---
Yes, which is different to a penis/vagina. Those organs may be involved in sex, but are not strictly necessary for reproduction. It's the gametes that are important.
---
&gt; What you've read on salon.com doesn't matter in reality where it is required to have a male produce sperm and a female to produce an egg.
---
Is salon.com your favourite hoster of scientific articles? I'm afraid I can't comment on it, as I haven't visited it and I get my scientific news elsewhere. Anyway, in reality there are people who are researching these topics, and in the future there may be humans that originated with "artificial" sperm and eggs.
---
I’m not the one automatically assuming someone is Chinese with a vehemently negative connotation. That’s on you, and you have to live with that.
---
Not my fault you got caught. Oh wait, it is.
---
They did this in English, outside of China.  The Chinese government gets to block the Western platforms which they put these up without people batting an eye. Within China the government gets to point at the statement up on NetEase as the latest official Blizzard statement.
---
Obviously, but semantically that region as we know it and it's history.
---
Everybody is cheering and upvoting this, when in reality they pulled sponsorship to avoid pissing china by getting in the middle of this quagmire.
---
R-o-t-fucking-l
---
under 40 is for the extra reward. No rewards under that.
---
I did an 11m 10s run and no change. I highly doubt under 10m would be different, as I was running the most broken deck possible mostly killing the bosses by turn 2/3.
---
The problem, old boy, is that you equate our systems with good, and the systems of non western countries with 'suffering'. Its rather chauvinistic, very American, and altogether not very helpful.
---
We need lasting impact on Blizzard and the NBA. Cancel your subscriptions, stop going to the games, stop watching them. If there is lasting impact then other companies will take heed and won't bow to the Chinese mafia.
---
LOL.
---
If I am not wrong King's Last year's revenue was 2 Billion dollars and judging from the trends it has almost paid off the amount it cost to acquire it. Why is it not earning its keep?
---
Are these up to date and the only demands? Article is from August, and I'm curious if something has changed since then.
---
Also, how unified in the demands are the protestors? Are there more "less important/popular"? Idk if that question is phrased super well, but I hope it makes sense.
---
You realize they pulled sponsorship to avoid pissing off china right?  They don't want to get involved in this quagmire.
---
That last paragraph is freaking beautiful
---
Literally killed the game. 
---
Randomly pulled the plug on the professional scene. Pro-gamers, streamers and casters all lost their jobs with the public announcement.

I think you all should stop demonizing a culture you don't understand.

Is this supposed to somehow contradict what I said, or are you agreeing with me?
---
Worth it in terms of gold-packs, absolutely not.
---
But, I personally find the adventures very fun, so I buy them anyway. If you like the adventure style of Kobolds, Withcwood and Raskatan Rumble, do it and buy them.
---
Indeed. Getting over it is a Good Game.
---
These 'agitators' and their traits seem to be something you made up with your imagination. People are perfectly capable of voting with their wallet and holding multiple companies accountable for curtailing to chinese-style censorship. In fact, here's a [blacklist](https://github.com/caffeine-overload/bandinchina/blob/master/README.md) of them to make it easier. 
---
If you want chinese-style censorship in the west, by all means, but don't blanket people who are pushing back as uniformed, one trick ponies like it's factual.
---
As others noted this is very well written and conveys your thoughts and emotions.
---
I'm not a fan of Blizzard and stopped HS long back. But imo, the company will not apologize until they have severe losses incurred or a possibility of that. 
---
As a gamer, it is sad to see all of you passionate players being struck with guilt to play your favorite game!
---
Imo, it is not worth it to do things in a guilty manner. as it messes up our well being.
---
Isn't there some profile picture, or hashtag we can use!??!?!
---
Not really, it just shows how many people that watch the tournament shows/knows that Blizzard is full of shit and they need to correct themselves.
---
Even most of the employees HATE their own company's response and lost faith in them. Sad.
---
Blizzard was right to nerf her all along.
---
Seems to me that what Apple did is a bit less clearcut though. If the app was really being used for nefarious purposes (I know this is probably unlikely), then that's a valid reason to remove it. It's also not like they removed every app that's related to HK, it's only 1 app. What Blizzard and the NBA did is pretty clear censoring of free speech.
---
What about family?

---
The Chinese company published that statement under Blizzard's name and even after all this time, Blizzard still didn't deny that it's their words. Seems like Blizzard is pretty happy with that statement.
---
Just because you know people are going say something doesn't mean they are wrong. These comments are perfectly good examples of virtue signaling, and that doesn't change just because you "called it".

 "Chinese time" meant "October 12th 844am"..... or vice versa? Like what? every year on October 12th just before 9am, its "chinese time"?

Man blizzard has some good planning  waiting a few days to release their statement exactly..... at the yearly anticipated...... Chinese Time!!!!!
---
And then he left the meme face in there cause everyone knows that makes your point so serious.

Come on guys chill, it was a joke. If you think OP was serious then you're the one that should be made fun of.

Sino Delendum Est
---
Same thought simulation. I dare say it had to be more than 50% of the total subscribers to deal much damage to the company else those stockholders won't panic. To be honest, I feel that there's something more that's going on why those companies are bowing to that country right now.
---
Then why are you replying to my post, which clearly isn't talking about that. Also, the majority of the poster understand that it's not Blizzard NA who posted this apology to China, but the fact they are giving conflicting statement is insanely worrisome.
---
“most people” obviously doesn't include Goodwin512
---
He called it out exactly for what it is.  
---
Money only matters for corporations.
---
In my experience it wasn't that bad. I wrote a couple of "yea it looks bad but there is a chance Blizzard isn't lying and actually just wants to avoid taking sides- in which case it would be fair to criticize them for not taking sides but not for taking a side" comments and none of them got downvotes at least.
---
Just gotta try to phrase them so that others can't conveniently misunderstand it for unreasonable.
---
China can get creative.
---
I mean I didn't see Zoe put a rope around his neck then kick him off a block. Just like after destroying you so much you change the subject, if you decide to take a doorknob nap it isn't my fault.
---
Good to know I'm not the only one who felt the 'letter' was off. Having two writers would explain most of that weirdness.
---
My point is your "sources" are lacking actual sources. Gaming journalism is but clickbait now.
---
Awooooo
---
*Shrugs* Then keep sucking down that chinese goo and get excited for your next product.
---
Doing so opens them to being detained; they're "disrupting social stability". As you say, "not state endorsed", or whatever. I'm not saying there is some uncombatable amount of law and order in place, but they're not far from. I never suggested they catch and detain EVERY PERSON that manages to get the messages/news out. But they do detain journalist, they do detain citizenry, and they do use violence as well as technology to discourage speaking out.
---
 Here at Blizzard something that we're constantly kind of struggling with is, you know, we gotta weigh on one hand the desire to look like a super progressive company, you know, every, every voice matters and all that stuff, and on the other hand, uhh, still bending over backwards for an oppressive government in order to make a ton of money, at the cost of our moral compass. So, it's a really fine balancing point for us, uhm, we're gonna do our best, it get's very tricky... Now, I was supposed to talk to you guys about how Blizzard headquarters are moving from you know, Irvine, California to an amazing skyscraper in, in China, But, I really need to go off script for a second... I think a lot about video games and why people behave the way that they do in, in video games and I think a lot of it comes down to the ability to freely chat with anybody, any time, speak your mind, which I think is super valuable, and, uhhI really do believe, that the world needs heroes now, more than ever, and because of the recent controversial events It's very important for me to mention, that I 100%-

‘merica is my lane, bro. What’s yours?
---
No it doesn't but if you are using someone else's platform you have to follow their rules or face the consequences. That has nothing to do with the freedom of speech. Just because Blitz is allowed to say what he wants (according to the freedom of speech) doesn't mean Blizzard is forced to provide him a platform for that.
---
Banning him for turning their livestream into something political is an entirely different thing than banning him for supporting HK, let's say, on his twitter.
---
The alternative is also difficult to believe. Also a non-native speaker does not equal to Chinese speaker. I'm not saying it's wrong or impossible, but the guy I replied to phrased it as a fact rather than a speculation.

Second post, on the other half of your question. The general guideline is to buy up to 10 packs of each Expansion, then switch to another, as you get a guaranteed Legendary in the first 10 packs. Other than that, decide which deck you're going to play and buy the expansion that's most likely to give you cards you need. A lot of the current decks use Quest cards that were in the SoU expansion so it's probably worth starting there.
---
The next rotation is in April, and will be Witchwood, Rastakhan and Boomsday.
---
Arena's still a good way of getting packs if you're good at Arena. 
---
For Constructed, the meta's in flux after last week's introduction of old cards back into the format. Once it's stabilised, hsreplay.com and vicioussyndicate.com are good sources of meta data. Quest Druid, Quest Shaman and Highlander Hunter are good bets, but all expensive. Murloc Shaman and Combo Priest are good budget decks, but the latter has a learning curve.
---
yeah no. an account owned by some side thing and clearly not a statement made by anyone with real authority. they are certainly harvesting the bad rep for it though, as seen in your comment.
---
&gt; I am against this "pushing others to speak up" thing. Even if one disagrees with you we have to respect each other. This is the fundamantal line of democracy.
---
Huh, this guy is *actually* for freedom speech, civil discussion, and democracy, who would've thought?
---
That aside, thanks for compiling this! Blitz seems to be really smart and respectful, I truly wish the best for him in the future.
---
It means that someone thinks microtrends are definite proof of anything.
---
You're absolutely correct.
---
Blizzard has not yet apologized in any fashion.
---
Lol, ask yourself: is the Chinese state news media more reliable? I mean it's not like they are always censoring information and manipulating news right? Oh, wait didn't you have to use a VPN to use this site?
---
&gt;Editors at state news outlets have told reporters to avoid emphasizing the N.B.A. issue for fear that it might become overheated, according to interviews with three journalists on Thursday.
---
This is somewhat expected if you how government-backed Chinese public opinion usually develops. Stuff like this happened multiple times already.
---
An example would be Senkaku/Diaoyu island dispute in 2012. Chinese state media riled nationalist anger for couple days and then had scale back because people are start to going to protest in street, smashing Japanese shops and burning Japanese cars.
---
Chinese government found in a situation they can no longer control, and all state media started to call for reason...as if they didn't fanned the flame to start the whole mess. 
---
&gt;Blizzard/NBA
---
The situation is actually very different between these two. 
---
Anger toward NBA is top-down, and was clearly government directed, with all the noises state media made and the way Chinese companies acted. There were actually quite a few people defending NBA in Chinese social media. And public opinion was more or less mixed, with most people outraged at Morey, but saying Silver's follow-up statement was okay, and banning NBA because this is just too much. 
---
Whereas, anger toward Blizzard that resulted in the ban is bottom-up. It alsmot entirely came from Chinese who play Blizzard games. They flooded Blizzard's official Weibo page with angry comments and the ban followed. Chinese news outlets mostly didn't picked up on this...in fact, it didn't even make a ripple outside of Chinese gaming community. 
---
They were also very different in scale...NBA's topic occupied more half of top 10 trendings tags on Weibo, whereas, Hearthstone stuff wasn't in top 100 (didn't bother to dig deeper).

Give it a week
---
Thank you for writing this, it was interesting to read the perspective of someone on the other side. 
---
However, have you considered the possibility that you might also be overexposed to media that goes in the other direction (supports the CCP)? We have all seen footage of people cowering in the corner of the train (posing no physical threat to the heavily armoured police) as the police beat them with batons. We have all read stories about protesters being inked so that they can be later identified. Even if we ignore 90% of the reports, there is still a large amount of evidence that the CCP engage in or encourage acts that fundamentally conflict with human rights (not just in the context of the protests) 
---
I don't deny that a notable portion of violence is likely instigated by the protesters, but while you are giving the government the benefit of the doubt, we are giving the protesters the benefit of the doubt. Given how much more power the government has in this situation, it seems prudent to question the government at least as much as the protesters. For me, it is far more appaling seeing a government that is so willing to brutalise its citizens, especially given how reasonable the protest demands are.

---
Plenty of memes are up here, why censor just this one, strike a nerve?-

chill man, people not liking your opinion and downvoting it is not the same as silencing your right to free speech lmao
---
One immediate "avoid". After the tutorials, when you first step onto the Ranked Ladder, you will be given the option of jumping straight from Rank 50 to Rank 25.
---
Do NOT jump to Rank 25. Ranks 50 to 26 are there to get you experience as you will only be matched against other new players, and climbing these ranks will give you a fair number of free packs. That way, by the time you reach Rank 25, you'll know how to play and you'll have enough to make a good deck.
---
but they are fine having people spout gay pride on their broadcasts. They can’t be ok with one thing but not the other.
---
I agree you don't want that, but the punishment did not at all fit the crime in this case. If anything, this is the most active involvement of all the cases. You didn't have to strip his hard earned prize money for some minor thing like that. And, again, the the PR aftermath just screams that Blizzard/Activision is China's bitch given their tweet literally says "we will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost".
---
Again, you didn't address my point that said tool can be used for bad purposes too. Like come on, it must be obvious to you that it was not removed because it was a tool to keep people safe. Stop trying to make that point, it makes no sense. It was removed because, again, it could be used for bad things. And, again, it's this 1 app. If Apple were China's bitch like Blizzard is, they would remove all HK supporting apps or something. 
---
I don't think you understand technology if you think using China's cell infrastructure constitutes active sharing of data with the Chinese government. There's something called end-to-end encryption FYI, which most other companies \*cough\* Google \*cough\* haven't had for a long time for their messaging apps. Apple is the only big company that has e2e encryption for their messaging app by default. Also, Apple uses EU infrastructure in EU; is that some kind of "active" undermining of the US in your mind too? None of what Apple is doing is "active" at all. I think all this stuff is being twisted to fool less business or technically saavy people.
---
The worst part is that there is *zero* chance of any actual rational discussion about it.  If your comments aren't "Blizzard is literally the worst company ever", you get slammed for being a bootlicker.  
---
A *large* group of people were saying that they were ok with a punishment, but it was too much.  Cut the ban in half, restored his winnings, rehired the casters.. and now the goalposts are moved to "any punishment is CENSORSHIP!"
---
Yea, businesses censor their employees &amp; want to keep their broadcasts censored.  What a shock.  You think MSNBC or CNN or NPR or ESPN or ABC want guests on there shouting homophobic or racial slurs?  Of course not, but point that out and it's YOU MUST HATE HUMAN RIGHTS
---
Congrats on your user name not being relevant in a month.
---
Of course I know that. But it has expanded its meaning so that it can mean a ban in general. Like Blitzchung is banned from HS but not *disqualified* from GM, but he still used the word DQ.
---
Blizzard is fine with promoting gay rights on stream though
---
31! How long did you finish this run?
---
Aw shit here we go again
---
They chose to fuck with the one form of entertainment where the people who partake in it have nothing to do but play games, talk about how shit something is, and adore making things get big attention.
---
Sports come second, but video games get a bunch of shit because it’s an inherently online hobby so everything is almost immediate.
---
Cool... so the relavance of my username on an online gaming platform is more important than human rights? You must be cool at parties...
---
Then they have to terminate people all the time they break contract, not just when they think it’s ok

Remember kids, absolutely nothing has ever happened in Tiananmen square.

Based mid 2000 model eclipse.
---
I had actually spent money on thus game.  I probably would have again in the future.  But i deleted my blizzard account.
---
To all the people that intentionally run the clock: i hope you blizzard turns you over to the ccp and tells them you are a uyghur that protested for hong kong.
---
Eh sure they do but there aren't enough people who believe that to call it a divisive opinion.
---
Meanwhile there *are* enough people believing that all races should not be treated equally to call that a divisive opinion. I wish there weren't but there are.
---
If Blizzard had actually apologized, redditors wouldn't still be up in arms. It isn't like Blizzard admitted fault, apologized, and then redditors demanded they give him extra prize money or something.
---
nah im good im having fun with the new meta so far, you should give it a try
---
if its quest shaman, that deck is just nuts atm but they need some key minions(mogu,giggling,thing from below) to transmute you have to remove them asap sometime you may not have the chance to e.g fucking mogus, but that has to go asap. someone else said control board they're absolutely right you need board control with 3 good minions (courtesy of MC tech) and thats ghe end of that usually unless that deck starts heavy with rng e.g kobold lackeys being generated after battlecry quest activation is like getting hit with a strong ice bolt for 1 mana. best deck imp to shred quest shaman is the combo priest.
---
&gt;we already have gotten an official response by both blizzard and blitzchung, honestly after their statement r/hearthstone just isn't the right place to further discuss stuff like this.
---
Blitzchung himself is 1/10th as mad about this whole thing as everyone else is.  He knew his actions would have consequences and he's accepted them. Even stupider, his whole comment was to shine light on HK/China, but now everyone is jerking each other off about *Blizzard*.
---
So you didn’t read the article I linked at all then. Why am I not surprised?  Yeah, those children and adults who are in a camp of prisoners which is highly concentrated are in concentration camps. You just don’t like it because it’s your country and not the scary foreigners country. And this isn’t even the first time the U.S. has had concentration camps.
---
And right, inmates aren’t people, so they can be sterilized without sacrificing your “morals.”  But this whole Hong Kong thing is about human rights, correct?  
---
The list of atrocities committed by America, past and present, is far longer than the list of atrocities of any other country in the planet, let alone China, which is a country that’s been around for about 5,000 years.
---
Just admit it, this has nothing to do with “human rights” and everything to do with xenophobia.
---
It pretty much kills the narrative that blizzard only needs to appease china. Realistically, Blizzard makes more money from the west than they do in china. They would like to keep everyone happy but push comes to shove, they need to appease the western audience more than they need to appease china.

Capitalism itself(what people agree is the "core concept") is letting individuals place their support in companies who provide a good product. 
---
What capitalism(core concept) does not take into account is the possiblities and risks of this system. For one, the system does not account for people with large sums of money **investing** in companies and lobbying occuring. It doesn't take into account who is giving the money to the companies, all it takes into account is that $ flows from the common consumer into an entity providing a service/product. Where the $ goes after that FROM the entity to other places is not taken into account. 
---
The oversights in the core concept of capitalism are it's "problem"(What consumers now feel is unfair and not very competitive/individualist at all). It's not accurate to say that just because these things were not foreseen in capitalism that it isn't what capitalism "actually is". 
---
Just to be clear, I don't hate capitalism but I realize it has too many issues in it's ideology to ever succeed for everyone in the latest stages of it(what we're currently experiencing). 
---
The only way capitalism could succeed is if there were safeguards preventing large fundings of money from one source. Of course, that eliminates startup business in the current stage of capitalism and in itself is a problem where no standard business(barring some insanely innovative startup) could receive funding and grow to what it needs to be to survive in the market. 
---
Overall what I'd like to say(along with an apology for boring you with so much text :p) is that any system (definitely not just capitalism/communism/etc.) will not be able to be fully thought through and cannot be overseen fully. Just because of that though, it isn't right to say those flaws "aren't part of capitalism" or "what capitalism is". It's just not something that was thought of as an upcoming issue when capitalism arose.
---
&gt; Google Reddit BBC bla blabla isnt censored. 
---
No, it's all over the media in Vietnam, biggest newspapers like tuoitre... They don't censor these news. You don't need to find it elsewhere. Are you oversea Vietnamese?
---
"Nobody here give a slightest damn about hongkong's plight. "
---
It's just your guessing, considering you don't even know what's on the media.
---
Neither of those is the case I am talking about. I see that many (most?) Chinese people are wanting to support their government in order to keep the country unified and agree that HK should be a part of a unified China. They find the idea of protesting in support of giving HK freedom from China as offensive and very negative. The NY Times article I linked goes into much more detail, from a Chinese-born writer, especially the later parts; and Joe Tsai's open letter is very worth reading.
---
I dont want to burst anyone's bubble. But anyone that is going to like a post like this is going to be entered into chinas social credit system as a threat. In the future you will be denied entry to china because you upvoted this post.
---
The rest of the world laughs at Americans, how much do you care? Why would Chinese be different?
---
Streisand is prob banned in China too so ... fuck em.
---
That's not my job to know  ... The people who care should figure that out ..
---
Any attempt at quelling the discussion would have resulted in people screaming about censorship and claiming the mods were in league woth Blizzard/CCP so I can understand their hands off approach. It can be hard to draw the line between keeping an active and visible forum to discuss the issue and having the sub be overrun with HK discussion and I think we've gone a bit too far in the latter direction even though I know people are passionate and wanted the issue addressed.

They are a tricky business to keep afloat and actually do require all the markets to even stay above breakeven. They partner with each other and share flights to lower costs of connecting multiple cities.

Ah, my misunderstanding. I had thought they'd dropped, but I don't hugely follow stocks. I was more think of the potential damage it would have.

Thanks for the info :)

Great article! Not even 300 words

Weak damage control changes nothing.
---
Just want to point out SEA =/= APAC.
---
Also the Chinese will never get fed up with their government. They LOVE their government. The sooner you realise that the quicker we can come up with real solutions.
---
This seems a little pre-emptive and judgemental on the protesters, and is also something Blizz will probably try to hide behind — devs and organisers front and centre.
---
It can go past 20 copies during a run, but it goes back down to 20 copies on your next one. Turn 2 or turn 3 lethals tho.

It is only hypocrisy if you tell someone else not to do it.

So.... what happened? Was it summoned as a minion?

Fuck that false equivalency.
---
If you really don’t care, then don’t waste your energy calling people who do hypocrites
---
Blizzard wouldn’t have done anything if this outcry hadn’t happened, so it’s not like people bringing attention to this is in effective anyway
---
I mean, they have.  But ok
---
It's funny, in China you wouldn't even be able to say the same thing about China. Even if you hate your country for personal reasons and are concerned about its problems at the end of the day you still have the ability to complain about your grievances without being censored or supressed...or jailed. That's better than nothing.

Depends on what you’re looking for. 
---
To me, blizzard is dead. I deleted my account, everything i owned by them is now trash, and I will never touch a game from them ever again, so I’m not interested in anything else. 
---
Maybe a few questions on why their stocks prices dropped and are dropping like crazy
---
There is a high chance you will be facing full tier A decks the moment you step into rank 25. Be prepared for it, don’t think too much about it or get angry. Folks have been playing this game for years. 
---
One sort-of cheap, very fun, deck to start working towards is zoo warlock. They introduced quite a fair bit of interaction and interplay into this year’s variant, so it’s not as simple and brain dead as before. 
---
Also unfortunately, you missed out on the free Sn1p-Sn4p legendary which fits into multiple decks.
---
Only the US other countrys don’t do it.
---
NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS 
---
In Europe Soccer you Song your Teams anthem but not the national one.
---
I don’t want to discourage you from doing that or anything, but is it a possibility that, having seen you hand out Hong Kong t shirts, they might not let you in? My thinking is that they’re going to be on mega high alert for anything that looks like protesting, and I’d hate for you to not be allowed in even for harmful peaceful protest **outside** the event. I could well be, and obviously hope I’m wrong, but it might be worth considering anyway.
---
How about you go fuck yourself? 
---
Death the Blizzard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
 Not in any way that would seriously cause blizzard to worry. 
---
The most ive seen is one guy tweeted about it. More people have expressed concern about the NBA thing than this.
---
No, you just want an easy target to hate. It gives you a feeling of acceptance and power. Since China dont give a fuck about you, reddit and social media, but Blizzard does, stupid entitled kids decide to hate Blizzard. Easy as that.
---
I hate to say it but I have actually seen it in quite a few comment sections so far, not often you see r/ChappoTrapHouse subscribers and r/The_Dons agree on anything.
---
Then Dupla it every now and then maybe. Also watch out for Naturalise (the guy whose hero power heals his minion to full nearly killed me)
---
I'm not demeaning or judgemental of the protesters. The Devs and the organizers don't deserve this but yes they will be casualties in the crossfire. I just don't want anyone to go after any devs personally.
---
Dude, China (and a lot of Asian saving-face) is petty as fuck.
---
You hit it bang on, their national pride is extremely frail. They will use any petty means to defend it.
---
&gt; You inserted a big "if" :) I dont think the spirit of gaming is to unify under a single banner, personally.
---
It's not that big of an if when it's specifically stated by Blizzard as their objective. It's about people coming together and sharing a common passion.
---
There are millions of reasons people play millions of different games. But "we're all gamers." We all share that common interest. That's the point to be gotten at. You don't have to love GSL and herald Starcraft as the best eSports of all time to recognise and understand someone's love for the LCS. You don't have to be obstinate against the Overwatch League because you're a diehard CS:GO fan. You don't need to go to /r/hearthstone and complain about the latest money grabbing pack bundle because "~~Duelyst~~ ~~Eternal~~ ~~The Elder Scrolls: Legends~~ ~~Magic the Gathering: Online~~ ~~Shadowverse~~ ~~Gwent~~ Magic Arena is better."
---
In the context of a game tournament, I think it's very safe to assume that you are there to watch high quality gameplay of that specific game.
---
So it doesn't have to be about feeling like you're a part of a big loving community. But you are at least a part of it. And you don't want to be pit against other parts of the community - especially the company that you pay for your entertainment - based on unrelated world-views.
---
If you're trying to get a reaction out of me it isn't going to work lol. Try on someone else.
---
;-;. My feelings.
---
But for real tho, Just don't attack employees. that's all I really want. It's supposed to be a decent time ya know.
---
Doesn't answer any of the questions lol . My point was go out and make a difference I'm not here on hearthstone reddit to make a difference .
---
Bro you're mentally retarded.
---
Thank you for doing the right thing and helping us keep the momentum going till Blizzcon.

Sounds alot like a fucking coward dev who wants to suck PRC cock rather than make a stand for free speech!

Free HK!

The outrage online has literally already made a difference is what I’m saying
---
Are you Chinese?
---
How can I hitchhike across the Atlantic ocean?

Every deck starts with three treasures, I believe. Some of the decks have passive treasures over playable card treasures, which makes this less obvious. The Shaman deck features Best Friend Forever, Duplitransmogrifier, and that five mana spell that puts two zero-cost copies of any minion into your hand.
---
That's true there has never been a communist economy. There have been communists and people that try to implement it, but communism, as it has been defined, requires the dissolution of the nation state structure. Has it been tried? Yes. Has something that should be called communism happened? No. Do I trust anyone to implement it ever? Definitely not. Do I think that communism is desirable? No, I actually think social inequality would be worse, but it's hard to be sure. I just think socially inept people would be left by the wayside in such a system and in capitalism (or any other system that allows for the pursuit and accumulation of wealth), they have access to ways of building social capital through building wealth. Under communism hierarchy would still inevitably exist and we the most powerful people would just be the most likeable sociopaths we can find and everyone would be competing for social power because there would be no other method for gaining merit. It would toxic as hell.
---
I try to talk about communism as it has been attempted at (usually something much closer to a nationalist socialist model, not necessarily fascist but often just as brutal). I do that because there's not really much reason to discuss something that doesn't exist and maybe can't exist.
---
Dude, tying together economic and environmental grievances together with the Hong Kong issue is not helping. You are setting yourself up for not accepting anything other then the downfall of the Chinese government, which is not going to happen. You are not going to be able to boycott China either. They provide goods for much of the planet, they are impervious to boycotts. Diplomatic and political pressure are the things that could have an effect and get the Chinese to back off on the changes to Hong Kong’s status under the one country two systems set up. Making regular people angry is not going to help get that public sentiment against the situation in Hong Kong.

Here you go, scoured the web has to have been an exaggeration, the top 2 articles both had all of them after googling "hearthstone 1000 win portraits".
---
It was put on hold and not withdrawed. By the way , how could you trust a government that tried to implement something so dangerous to your rule of law ?
---
Well, I guess they didn't sign the same contract like blitzchung regarding grandmasters when they joined the tournament? Then it would make sense that they did not recieve a ban. Blitzchung also mentiones it in his recent interview.
---
Yes, I think, by now, Blizzard knows, who Barbara Streisand is and, more importantly, what the effect is, named after her. ;)
---
It’s not identical but it’s very comparable. OP might’ve gone a tad too far but you’re out here downplaying it, which is definitely worse. Do you think it’s justifiable, what they’re doing? Because your message damn well sounds like that. Take this opportunity to correct yourself.
---
Not all offenses are created equal.  Saying " I support trump " would be less egregious than " death to all liberals ".
---
I hate to break it to you, but that's not how free market capitalism works. There are almost no ethical companies in the world, it's simply not possible to compete if you are.
---
Blizzard aren't an exception, they're the rule, they're just one of the few dumb enough to make that explicitly clear.
---
No matter how controversial, as long as it doesn’t upsets china it’s ok /s
---
Actually I’m not sure if I need the /s but there you go.
---
Ok, I will re-read your comments with this in mind.
---
You realize the US has concentration camps on the border? And is literally losing and killing immigrant kids? So how many American games are you boycotting
---
The trust and reputation that Blizzard painstakingly earned, game by game, over the last 20+ years, shattered in a matter of days. 
---
Was it worth it?
---
I have no idea what youre talking about.
---
Wasn't this debunked?  Specifically the "at all costs" line?
---
How about disrupting the events? Organize the crowd into a chorus of "liberate hong kong", pull out placards of HK Mei - make this blizzcon as much of a PR nightmare as possible for Blizzard. Make them have to choose between heavily doctoring/censoring the footage or throw it out altogether. Put them in a lose-lose situation.
---
Whoa, we got an Internet badass on our hands here, folks.
---
支持你呀，光復香港，時代革命！！
---
I'm mostly F2P but I was really enjoying those singleplayer adventures and was happy to pay for them. Blizzard, if you're reading this, i want you know I'm not buying any more until you undo all the bans and make a full apology and promise this never happens again. I don't expect any of that to happen, but there it is.
---
Same here. Gamers tend to act entitled and throw tantrums online, but this whole thing has made me feel so disgusted with Blizzard.
---
You really should try to get a better understanding of things before trying to make a point. The extradition bill was intended to close a loophole that popped up allowing a murderer to get away. read about it. HK is just adverse to any change to their way of life and sees this as China interfering. Yes China agreed to give HK 50 years of autonomy but at the end of the day, HK is still a part of China and China has plans to integrate them in 2047. You can't change someone's entire way of living overnight so there has to be incremental changes along the way. If they get this riled up over something that doesn't even impact most people, they're not going to have a good time later.
---
No it wasn't. China already has their own unique censored art for Hearthstone. Removing skulls and whatnot. If the art changes were for China, it would've been only for China, like all the other unique art they have.

I'm glad their games have brought you so much joy, like they have to me. Never did try WoW, out of worry I'd get *really* into it!

In some ways it's nice to know there are other people feeling like this, but it's such a shame so much adoration and passion is now associated with feelings of guilt. Thank you for sharing, and I hope I don't add to the guilt in any way, it is not my intention! 🙂
---
&gt;Also communist governments ironically result in absurd wealth inequality.
---
You were willing to use the phrase as everyone else does when it suited your point, and only now that you've been called out on the inconsistency are you trying to pretend it never happened.
---
You know what people mean when they say capitalist and communist economies, and trying to use meanings that literally nobody uses to protect yourself from having to actually defend your point is just intellectual dishonesty.
---
You know what people mean. You knew what he meant, and you know what I meant. And I know you didn't truly mean the words in a fundamentally different way than everyone else when you wrote them.
---
You called out the guy you were arguing with before for not addressing the full argument and only picking at a couple of points in your comments. You are doing the same now. You have answered basically only the first sentence I wrote.

There are plenty of subreddits where you can discuss your bullshit. Turning gaming sub into trash can doesn't help HK people at all. GTFO keyboard knight.

After blizzcon no one will even know there is place called HK.
---
You said literally two comments up that people will believe in one thing until they are inconvenienced by "feminists" or "hippies".
---
Guess what? Talking about something and keeping the attention on something adds pressure. China doesn't like having the whole world watching them. Has anyone in this thread ever cared this much about people in concentration camps in China, or about Hong Kong? And yet, right now every gamer is talking about China and what they are doing. I think that keeping the pressure on and raising awareness is way more important that having fun.
---
Btw, by causing disruption I don't mean making a mess. You can cause disruption by staying silent when they want you to cheer, for example.

If it's not enough, please elaborate on what you would deem "enough" because I think everyone still on this, wants things that doesn't even make sense.
---
Your source doesn't support your assertion that "What China is doing to the Uyghurs within China is genocide and is identical to the holocaust of Jews in Nazi Germany."
---
What Nazi Germany did is try to literally kill every single Jew in literally every single country on earth. What China does is horrible and possibly genocide, but I don't think it's quite "try to literally kill every single Uyghur in literally every single country on earth." So I wouldn't quite call them Nazis or say that what they're doing is identical to the Holocaust.
---
I feel bad for you considering your lack of empathy. Despite that, against all odds, I hope you will truely be loved some day.
---
This really should be one of the key points from this whole debacle, together with the free HK movement. Acti-Blizz is predictably doing what massive publicly traded corporations do. They are not being shills for China, they are being shills for the single-minded focus of making money. Taking down Acti-Blizz will not change anything, they are a rotten apple in a barrel full of rotten apples.

I'm playing hs for over 2 years, and it's one of my favourite games. And now you blizzard, made me lose the passion i had for heathstone. I still play it, reluctantly, and i fear that i will stop playing in the future.

All that talk about morals. The stories about good and evil, it's time to practice what you preach blizzard, and if you won't do it because it's right, you're gonna do it because you'll lose even more money. One way or another, the internet will win.
---
Yes! This situation has made me look at everything I buy and spend money on. Moving forward I will be anti CCP consumer. If I can chose I will always take the product or service not China owned! Its time to fight back as customers
---
It's extremely money heavy tbh, nearly sure, feels like £40 pound will get two decks or so

Good luck trying to convince the sinophobic echo chamber that is reddit.

Didn't help Blizzard doesn't have the best of reputations to begin with, they've been going downhill for a while, especially with last year controversies of Diablo Immortal and the sudden firing of 800 employees

If they'd have actually admitted wrong doing outside of acting hastily or said 'sorry' might have helped for sure.

I'll just copy paste what someone else wrote in that thread so that there is no misconceptions about this article. The text below is not mine:
---
"Just so everyone is aware, this isn't another statement from Blizzard. It's the same one from Friday night.
---
&gt; “Every Voice Matters, and we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the many places available to express themselves. However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.”
---
They're saying that they will silence people for speaking out about politics etc during official tournaments that are focused on the game.
---
Shit statement they've made, but whoever wrote this title is trying to make out that they've doubled down on their statement made this Friday. 
---
This article is just taking words and quoting them out of context, even if the original context deserves to be shit on."
---
Honestly though on mobile its small enough with 3 options, 4 would look horrible

I said please explain without including emotions.

Neutrality and centrism is something different than not caring about it, and this black and white view of "You're either with me or against me" is super harmful as well.
---
This is truly one of the stupidest takes I've ever seen on the internet. Good job
---
My problem is that, with control warrior, I need to craft Armagedillo, Archivist Elysian and a third legendary (varies between Zephrus, Harrison Jones and Siamat). I can craft only 2 of them...
---
Like I said, I don't care about made up internet points. This post started as a way for me to come to terms with what I'm feeling. 
---
I think for you to say I don't care is either a knee-jerk reaction based on your feelings, or it shows you've not really read my letter and comments. Which is fine, you don't have to.
---
True, the PRC will most likely remain unscathed by this like always. That said, it sure would be amazing if someone capable can go 'Solid Snake' on them know what I mean? If CCP were to collapse from within someday...
---
Games stilll enjoyable, standard just gave people 23 new cards for a limited time free, if your struggling dust wise just hop into wild, most efficient thing there would be secret mage
---
If they get hired. If that job pays similar wages. If that company has the staff and equipment to make just as good games. Just risk you current life on a bunch of maybes cause it's for a good cause even if you don't really impact it at all by quiting alone.
---
Might I suggest r/competitivehs?
---
Sorry you feel that way.
---
Just over thinking an wanted some reassurance haha
---
Serving up one order of a year's blizzard abstinence here. Let me know if you need an upgraded plan!
---
Well, I can't say I know for sure as this looks to be a friendly game between Trogg and Jetz, but assuming it's about bugs:
---
1) The card on the far left of Jetz's hand is... not behaving right.   
---
2) Even though there's the message on-screen that "Hero Powers can only be used once a turn", which usually means you're trying to click on an already used Hero Power, here Jetz is obviously using it.  
---
Also, trogg is playing as Hemet while Jetz is playing as Jaina, but that might be something to do with the Tavern Brawl?
---
Sure this is what I think. I play to have fun, and to play the decks that I like. I don’t care about the meta. Sure if you want to reach legend, but I’m only playing wild right now, so who cares.
---
&gt;  I do know that it feels better to donate money and supplies to Hong Kong protestors
---
Then perhaps you should stick to that.
---
&gt; cry about a video game company
---
Ah, so ***that's*** who you're shilling for.  Thanks, that clears it up.

 ajasnia#2580, EU, 80g quest
---
He "jokingly" said he would comeback if blizzard reconsidered their ban, I dont think they would actually change their mind, now that the DID, he cant just not play hearthstone, thatd be way worse
---
What attitude? This sub is being flooded with political activists who don't even play the game, karmawhoring Winnie the Pooh memes, 100 different 'DAY X: I USE CAPS TO EMOTIONALIZE THINGS' threads, threads about leaving 1 star reviews on Google Play, claims of people quitting the game because of the incident etc. This is a cardgame subreddit.
---
3 NA packs incoming /s
---
&gt;but who is to decide what is good and what is bad?
---
Man, over the course of history we have established a set of rules, called in general "human rights". These things are already decided and if you're really curious about the details, you would have to track thousands years of philosophy and ethical treaties, among the set rules of living in modern society.   
---
One of the key establishment is the ones right to public assembly and to protest in peace. Now, you can obviously take the different perspective and analyse, whether China's or HK arguments are closer to your heart but that doesn't change the fact: ability to protest is good and brutally pacifying protesters is bad.   
---
I am from Europe, so my perspective about Crimea is very different from yours, as ban and embargo of this area is completely justified and I can assure you, outcry here about the subject was huge and cause of it will not be forgotten.  
---
I would like you to stop measuring others by your standards. Every protests of this magnitude is and would be noticed by someone, who's even remotely into global affairs. Whether it happen in China, France or Venezuela - people do care. Now, my personal reason to care about "people that are located thousand kilometres away and have 0 cultural similarities with me" is simple, they are human beings just as I am and we share 99,9% of same genome. Isn't that alone enough reason, to have in mind someone, from other side of the globe?
---
There can be good and evil in politics and just because you have cynical approach to that subject, doesn't mean the whole world turn around your principals.
---
1 dust per minute is not worth.
---
Bit late for the karma train unfortunately. Should’ve posted this the other day and you’d be swimming in awards and updoots
---
Not just June, There are 2 pride months a year according to businesses. 
---
Im used to be down with pride but recently its gotten silly. Gone are the days of gay lesbian and trans people walking down the street in a t-shirt and jeans letting us know they are normal people just like everyone else, Instead current day pride is about wearing bondage gear, Dildos all overyourself putting make up on children and getting spanked in a gimp mask in the middle of the street. Pride has turned into fetishcon and its not right.
---
It's not a genocide if they aren't killing them. It's still horrible and absolutely unacceptable, but these dont appear to be death camps primarily. So let's remain accurate and clear when we talk about this issue.
---
Should he have set himself on fire in protest?
---
Seriously, what is the expectation? Toast said he would stream it if they ‘reconsidered’ their position. That is inarguably true. Blizz is not going to fully reverse their decision for a lot of reasons. 
---
Blizz still shit the bed. They are not forgiven. But that doenst mean Toast isnt held to what he promised.
---
Me too, I have tried several other card games, looking for alternatives. Most of them suck and are not as good as Hearthstone, I'm still going to play this again though.
---
Change your name to ‘Free Hong Kong’ 
---
Theyll remove your account within 15 minutes.
---
The worst form of protest is those that undermine those who have no control over the situation. Like when people protest by damaging - causing repair crews and janitors to sweep up the mess. 
---
Don't make the little workere pay for the greedy corporate idiots in a meeting room.
---
I do. Lots of people do actually. 
---
My (and many others) problem with the punishment was the severity. I even had issues with the new punishments severity until it was confirmed that he would be back in GM after the 6 months.
---
I still wish the best for the people in HK, but I harbor no ill will towards Blizzard. Just because they aren’t willing to sacrifice their position in the Chinese market (and cost thousands of employees jobs) doesn’t make them evil to me
---
Reporting rumors that it is happening* 
---
It's not like we were able to send reporters in to investigate.
---
Make sure you know which part of the venue is private vs. public space.  They can't kick you off public space.  But security can remove you from private space -- like lobbies and parking lots -- can't they?
---
Can't blame him
---
[That's false. Epic is 40% owned by Tencent, and majority owned by Tim Sweeney](https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1181944951686488066?s=20). You might be thinking of Riot.
---
Oh shit. Someone better tell China.
---
As a wild Odd rogue player, the new Valeera is exactly what I've wanted
---
He is pointing out that mass incarceration, forced labor, brainwashing and torture are not genocide. It's all horrible, evil and unacceptable, but it's not a genocide if they aren't systematically exterminating them.
---
It benefits all of us to stay clear and accurate.
---
I luckely got this under 40min first try, went with warrior deck - and when the headless head enters the board i used BRAWL, and just crossed my fingers, and BAM -instawin.
---
Btw, anyone having the problem of applying them to your deck? I made all of them favourite, except Druid, which I totatally can't, the button just does nothing. I also try to apply them to the deck manually and it also works only temporary. May be it has something to do with a mobile-PC client offsync?
---
Thank you for sharing this. These sentiments match mine. I had to delete my account and renounce all my content. It’s the only way I couldn’t feel dirty anymore.
---
Just like human rights in HK
---
Oh... Wait.
---
Ok. See you in HS with your main account
---
No not the same, but good try
---
Cancelled sub, uninstalled everything. Vote with your wallets folks, that's all these people understand.

Rip r/hearthstone
---
You missed russian invasion into Ukraine, separation of Crimea and several other regions, that attempt to be "independend city-states" now, and fights go on about them. Basicly a lot of people are dead and keep dying because criminals on top (of both sides of conflict) want to claim\\reclaim the territory. If you will want details - it's easy to google them.
---
I was able to win the best way just a few hours ago, Deathwinging the horseman from orbit which also nukes my Boombot so that a bomb immediately kills the Horseman.
---
Don't flatter yourself. I like calling out people's bullshit. That's a 'snowflake' is it?
---
Not being able to take negative criticism, and hiding in safe space subs nobody cares about, would accurately fit the definition of snowflake actually.
---
Isn’t that the point?
---
This but literally... the game's price went thru the roof with the release of Uldum and no one is saying a thing
---
Everyone keeps saying this, but he clearly doesnt like the game and he is already making good enough money from TFT.
---
Then again, he is a self admitted opportunist and loves money.
---
But as much as he loves money he stopped playing HS because he hates playing it in the first place.
---
So who really knows. I am willing to bet it's a little bit of both. He's smart enough to know it's bad press for him to return now as well.
---
Yes they do. They are inherently tied to the POLITICAL decisions of the country and are a purely political question. 
---
The question „should that person over there be discriminated because of who they love even though they‘re nor hurting anyone“ is only political because people make it political. It shouldn‘t be.
---
China’s policy “geniuses” are the ones who got maneuvered into buying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of frozen pork, called it a “strategic pork reserve”, and shortly thereafter had to sell all of it off due to a swine fever epidemc.
---
What in tarnation? No! It’s too late for them to redeem themselves. The world would be a better place if people would be a less forgiving with greedy companies. Blizzard had an obligation they didn’t follow throw on. No not as a company, but people should stand for the freedom of others no matter the consequences they face. They don’t deserve redemption. They already chose their side. No redemption for blizzard.
---
Whoa there chief. I've been playing a lot of wild, and ever since the Barnes nerf I've only encountered two Big Priest decks on ladder. What rank are you playing at?
---
Taunt Maexxna Druid? Never seen it. Maybe you mean Hadronox? Even that is rare in wild (though I've played the Reno variant of the deck).
---
Taunt Warrior lost a bit of steam with the shadow nerf to Discover. More people play Pirate Warrior instead (has better game against Secret Mage).
---
Jeez everyone here is so vicious, it really doesn't take much for the community to turn on a streamer does it?
---
https://youtu.be/KXG1hkmmXVU
---
Yes I am. Except it isn't "bullshit".
---
Every bit helps but until we csn find alternatives we will do what we can.
---
thx for the fast reply :)
---
damn, lol, i'm going to hear about this one for awhile.
---
Same :)
---
Yup... this has been super disturbing to watch
---
It's not *their* game.
---
When I found out that there was no way to buy the game without Blizz being involved what did I say in the topic you linked?
---
Edit your original post and tell everyone what I said because you told a quarter of a story to discredit me you piece of shit.
---
It's not about supporting China. It's about not supporting an American company that shows direct support for China's authoritarianism.
---
I think any company bowing to Chinazi is not even worth wasting a minute of your time trying to reason them.
---
Go play another game by a company China cannot influence.
---
So why should all those people lose their jobs. What did Joe Schmo on the art team do to deserve losing his job?
---
Just to we are clear though, Blitzchung directly addressed this. He signed a contract, they did not. They agreed to no special behaviour, they are not playing at a level that requires them to conduct them selves in any specific manner.
---
Are those people going to reactivate their accounts now that Blitzchung gave them his blessing to do so?
---
&gt; reconsidered
---
Brack could've said "we reconsidered and decided we did everything right" and that would still count as "reconsidered".
---
Just to be clear I don't have a problem with Toast's streaming, that's his decision. But personally I do think he folded too early.
---
They already did.  It's a 6 month suspension now.  And they were partially to blame they knew what Blitz was going to say and allowed him to say it.
---
I am pretty ignorant on the topic, so correct me if I'm wrong.
---
If blizzard outright condemned China for the terrible stuff they're doing, wouldn't they likely retaliate by banning blizzard products? The tragedy to me wouldn't be Blizzard losing a very large chunk of money. The tragedy to me would be the millions of folks no longer being able to play the games they love.
---
I don't wanna sound like a blizzard shill, but I feel like this would end up punishing many people who play the games. 
---
Then again that might help the current Hong Kong movement by getting more people upset with the government. 
---
I don't see what the right thing to do is.
---
Because even though it's hard if not nearly impossible to live life without ever using anything from China again because we have a global economy, this can still put pressure on Blizzard or other companies to make them have to make a choice. It also gives this issue more international light for not only Hong Kong but other injustices happening in China, which China is not the biggest fan of. Secondly, if blizzard does get banned in China, it could upset a lot of the local population since they could like playing Blizzard games or watching the NBA. With enough upset, the people might want actual change for themselves too. The final thing is, just because we can't do everything, doesn't mean we shouldn't do something. If we give up and throw our hands in the air, nothing will ever get done.
---
Because we only have small worms to bait the small fish.  Also the small fish are loud, but the big ones lurk in the darker depths.
---
They do, but they run into the same problems as HS but on even shorter cycle. 
---
Games within the same patch get pretty stale in what people are picking.  But if they make patches too often, it becomes too hard to follow. 
---
Doesn't seem like there will be a competitive scene either.
---
Forsen#2999 EU looking to trade quest, I can show but you go first..
---
But then wouldn’t we still support them by buying all of these other products?
---
As the others have said, this deck is super strong but is hard to play correctly.
---
The situation is basically over. People protested, Blizzard reduced the penalties. Now people have to make their final decision, quit the game and Blizzard products or not. But it's very unlikely Blizzard will change the penalties again or issue another statement, so continuing to complain is mostly pointless.
---
I was thinking "oh good people stay angry so it won't die down." Then proceed to close the app but then i realized if i do that it will die down and i refuse. If you think like me i implore you to keep fighting, keep the boycott, make memes, upvote threads for visibility, tell the truth of how badly the situation in China is to your friends but keep doing something we cannot let this die down. This is exactly what China wants.
---
Anybody else click "Skip ads" out of habit?
---
Stop lying to their customers would be a good start.
---
This appears to be correct. The actual amount appears to be in the **35%** range. Thank you for looking this information up.
---
I mean.. we have american company, which is directly hindering HK protests and are siding actually actively with China's government and there is...nothing...crickets. No protest, not outrage, no political intervention - just silence.
---
However, let's burn Blizzard down and ruin event for thousands people because HS tournament ban.
---
Damn, this is really age of internet whoring and fake warriors for freedom across the globe.
---
Are you dumb like this or did you made some kind of course?
---
unfortunately Blizzard is plenty rich and powerful, and even your small enterprises, in some miracle that they grow big enough to make it into the world stage of investors and stockholders, chinese people telling them what to do or lose money from a market of a billion people, where does your moral compass stand?
---
It does change an Awful lot. What if going against NetEase on a global scale like that was somehow a breach of contract. What if in their contract as a way to control business that come to China,  there are clauses that allow for a transfer of IP.
---
Remember how decisions from Activision was really hurting what Bungie could do with Destiny? And once they got free of Activision and were able to have full control of the game alot of things started changing for the better?
---
Blizzard could be in a situation like that. While contract with NetEase (which I believe I have seen somewhere that the contract is through 2023) Blizzard can't formally go against NetEase without risking control of IP's. Meaning, if Blizzard did stand up like people are saying they should have, they don't just lose Chinese money, they can lose Hearthstone altogether?
---
Speculation, of course since we don't have access to their contracts as far as i'm aware. But if everyone else can Speculate that they are being greedy for Chinese Money, why can't I speculate that maybe their hands are tied in more ways than appear.
---
Not this shit again
---
YES please do not go planning to yell and harass. If there is a chant protest outside then feel free to participate, but also showing up in cosplay/ or a T-shirt that supports Hong Kong and just enjoying the event is totally fine! (Until you probably get kicked out)
---
The link in Blizzard's tweet 404s for me.  
---
Anyone got a permalink or anything to the article?
---
Yup. Did you see they eased up on the ban and gave him his prize money back as well? My only issue personally was the severity of the ban.
---
By all accounts, the new event is called the 'Global Finals', not the world championship. The world championship was already played this year.
---
Write to government, force them to make a stance, let's push towards legislative to protect people like Blitzchung. This has to be political discussion, not trying to make it about video games and video game company. Be heard where it actually matters, not at blizzcon. Noone cares, not america, not china not other gaming companies - they will just be better prepared how to fool masses in the future, not being suddenly anti-china.
---
People gonna be back eventually. Some will be even demanding their old account back, lol. Can't wait
---
Another rage account with no HS history.
---
That's nice to hear, however, is this actually some hot theme or it was already forgotten? I hope for the former.
---
What you talking about?
---
Big companies don't want to take a sensitive political role, do you want blizzard to let some neo-nazi talk during live broadcast about jews as well or is it only okey if it fits your narrative?
---
Blitzching could have said fuck Trump or fuck Clinton and would get punished as well.
---
&gt;  Blizzard made it political, not blitzchung. Blizzard is censoring and perpetuating their dictatorship. 
---
They did this because they don't want people to spread random political message through their company.
---
Blitzchung made it political as soon as he started saying political stuff..
---
That's a weird logical fallacy. The thinking here is so incongruous that I'm not even sure if there's a name for that one.  It's sort like the false cause fallacy, except you're conflating two seemingly random things together.  It's like you're saying that because I like ice cream therefore I must hate french toast.
---
TL;DR: Wut?
---
Didn't open the game since this happened. Won't be paying anything until it change. 
---
I know they like money; I've been supplying them with money for years now. Not anymore.
---
[deleted]
---
Let me rephrase it maybe, whats worse, people that already dont watch you also liking you less, or people that DO watch you, suddenly disliking you for lying, and not watching anymore, which is more impactful?
---
It's like one of the really on-the-nose ones, too.
---
"Blizzard releases statement obviously translated from Chinese after banning a player for advocating human rights, promises to 'defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost'".
---
Another rage account.
---
Can you talk without verbally insutling people.
---
&gt;  a dumbass like /u/Narux117 
---
&gt; Fucking moron.
---
&gt; you piece of shit.
---
&gt; there is something wrong with you because you are fabricating a victim
---
Christ. YOU EVEN RESPONDED TO THE WRONG PERSON.
---
I didn't tell a quarter of a story. You made a post trying to play a game that's fine. But you inability to research and pay attention to situations demonstrate your hypocrisy.
---
In What world could you possibly try and think a Call of Duty game wouldn't lead back to ActivisionBlizzard? I didn't just link a specific comment to tell a "quarter of the story". Every step of Call of Duty's History has been published by Activision.
---
So tell me, how are you so justified about calling for the death of Blizzard when you inability to research into ActivisionBlizzard products demonstrate you as being uninformed on the nuance and details of a global political situation. I'm not editing shit you are actively calling for 5000 people or more to lose their job for things out of their control and if you spent even 15 minutes learning about the situation you would know many people are Blizzard are against what's happening.
---
Not true. I'm seeing it on both their mainland China and Taiwan website now.
---
People fellating South Park for their controversial stance don't realize they have absolutely nothing to lose in this fight.
---
They just love stirring shit up for free publicity.
---
Played hearthstone alone for almost six years. Posting on reddit isn’t mandatory for players, yknow?
---
If you'd really pay attention there was even an overall list of everything the west companies did to please china under a HS thread and apple was on the list as well, stating exactly your points. You could follow the link to the original reddit post and see people talk about it there, but you dont get karma or some other internet points, so you didn't bother, right? Rather bitch about it here and spread false claims to get the juicy karma and be pretentious as fuck. Smh...
---
Well, please explain your views instead then.
---
Honestly, I appreciate the fact that you’re continuing this conversation. Communication across the lines isn’t easy. Wish that we would continue. 
---
What bad do you think would come from allowing children to choose what toys they’d like to play with?
---
Their relationships with China had no influence on their decision to not show it in China. /s
---
Yes, I know and I love it. I said it before but I am glad there were protests against blizzards decision and I fully support it. But decision was changed, blizzard was forced to make a statement, but at this point people just want to ruin blizzard and if you ask them, what they actually want blizzard to do (realistically), they can't tell you. They will just say they are for freedom and basic human rights and blizzard is not..well, okay then.
---
What the fuck?
---
i cast demonbolt and then recast it with rafaam's hp. the head being the only minion left on board. didn't work 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Who cares
---
Yep, definitely believe you, just like the other hundreds of throwaways spamming the sub for false virtue signaling. Noodles!
---
I actually had this happen with RoS pack from event. Did not even realise I had the set.
---
Well, I guess we can be proud we did our part, right? This is how it works?
---
Yes
---
The Yemeni tragedy happened in an active war zone. The sad reality of war zones is that large numbers of people get hurt on a regular basis, nearly always through no fault of their own. It’s simply not practical to have an emotional attachment to each injury in a war zone, so people blur them together into one lump sum, for their own sanity.
---
It IS possible to have an opinion and/or emotional attachment to the war zone as a whole. And individual highlights sometimes help make that connection, but you have to view them as shortcuts to the greater issue, and not really the issue in and of themselves.
---
So some people are concerned about the fate of the Yemenis as a whole, and for those, the bus incident is a sad spotlight.  Others of us haven’t taken any position on Yemen, and for those, the bus tragedy blurs into the greater tragedy of war.
---
Personally I just don’t know enough to know which side I should support in the Yemen war- but I do know which side I support in Hong Kong, and it’s not the CCP.
---
Blizzard's statement was a "We're very sorry you took what we did badly" style apology. People who are still pissed at the way Activision is playing this are unlikely to be happy with anyone willing to accept their statement at face value, so you probably have more than the average Toast related vitriol here.
---
Personally, I'm kind of hoping Toast goes seriously low-effort and off topic with it. I think a half-assed stream for a half-assed apology seems fair.
---
First thank you for the reply - you certainly didn't have to. I appreciate the time and thought you put in.
---
I'm not super familiar with Kern, so good to know some additional context. So far from what I've noticed it seems like he does indeed like some spotlight but he's not off any rails. I'll just keep a grain of salt in mind when reading going forward. 
---
I know this whole thing is going to be super tough for the rank and file. I have nothing but compassion and support for them - this certainly wasn't their decision or responsibility. I'm looking now mostly to the esports teams at Blizzard and executive leadership for their handling and subsequent response. Not sure that I'm satisfied with it; still going to not play anything blizzard until I see a better handling. 
---
Honestly I might wait until after Blizzcon into December. Give a full month break.
---
Yikes. I hope you find some peace in your life.

&gt; I didn't tell a quarter of a story. You made a post trying to play a game that's fine. But you inability to research and pay attention to situations demonstrate your hypocrisy.

I disagree with Divine Spirit. I think it's fine. Cleric is the problem card. Otherwise I'm on board with all you're saying.

+100 social credit points
---
&gt; So your arguments are of other people did it’s fine that he does it too?
---
No, what he does wrong is wrong, period.
---
The problem is the contrary: where you think that something special is happening right now that did not happened before. In this point, you are wrong, there is literally nothing new happening now.
---
Example of what you said:
---
"with a elected president that is censoring every research agency/university from publishing data that compromises the government is a first step for us to become a dictatorship"
---
That's HILARIOUS. You are so oblivious that literally all past governments did this that it is unreal.
---
"first step to become a dictatorship".
---
Man, if you paid attention to what kind of laws the previous government tried to pass, then you would be REALLY scared of becoming a dictatorship.
---
The first Lula term literally tried to pass a law to control the media creating a Federal Board of Journalism to control and punish 'bad journalism' in all of Brazil territory.
---
Man, if the Brazilian people paid attention for the things the previous government tried to do, they would shit their pants.

Elaforestis#2992 EU - 80 gold quest trade.
---
Given the phrasing of the tweet, probably yes. But only an insider could tell us for sure, and they’d probably be fired immediately if they did.
---
No, I completely agree. Plenty of mainlanders, even those living abroad or with plenty of foreign exposure, are often perfectly willing to tolerate and even fiercely support their government despite repeated gross misconduct, often through handwaving denials of "biased western media" or whataboutism to justify it. Admittedly our media and our citizens do often play things up unreasonably with rampant unsubstantiated theories, which is why I'm so dead set on correcting misconceptions, but the things that are in fact confirmed to be real are enough to damn them as it is. That being said, I don't think what much of the HK population did was okay because racism is not okay regardless of whatever legitimate grievances you may have, but if I made it sound like it was a problem solely on HK's side, I assure you that that is not my assertion. There is the question of what came first, but I don't know who started it or if that really even matters at all. The unfortunate fact that remains is that HK is in desperate need of assistance from the mainland - support that almost certainly won't be given.
---
This is merely the impression I get, so take it with a grain of salt, but I get the impression that as long as things are improving for the majority of mainland Chinese (which they are), many of the more openly political or nationalistic ones are more than willing to justify what happens to dissidents as necessary, and the less political ones just don't seem to really care or are even aware all that much because their lives have improved a lot. Admittedly, incidents like the stabbings perpetuated separatist Uyghur terror groups didn't help, but it hardly justifies the cultural genocide being perpetuated in the camps against the entire populace.
---
Again, merely speculation on my part in this regard, but I think that they look at the west, and see we've done similar things in the past in some cases (Kill the Indian and Save the Man anyone?), hence the rampant use of whataboutism whenever these debates crop up as a form of justification. Kind of like a "it's our turn to do these things" idea that a certain nationalist socialist leader advocated in regards to their actions compared against Britain. But we all know what happened to that guy.
---
No shit, none of the reviews are about the game. Why allow a massive surge of false ratings that dont tell anything about the game?
---
tbh Team5 did Change a bit to the better on that time, it takes way longer for the game to feel stale compared to an year ago
---
No, there is new 'mentality of the modern protester', the aim has always been to cause disruption. The problem is that the only place to perform legal disruption is in public areas. Try to disrupt the intended targets of private business or the govervenment on their property you will be removed/arrested for tresspassing. 
---
Protesting is not a perfect solution to get political change but it is the one that shows you geniunely care about something, enough that collateral such as annoying some people who cannot get to work is a concedable draw back if the result is awareness and change.

Exactly.

&gt;no approval; no disapproval; no promotion

Just the way it should be IMO.
---
Here it is. "oh they're just following the law of the country that harvests the organs of religious minorities, it's fine"
---
Then what is it? If it speaks directly for Blizzard, on behalf of Blizzard, to put out official statements to a community, *then what is it?*
---
Same. Stopped playing last year but rejoined the sub a few days ago.
---
looks like mods don't think so : D
---
I went looking and couldn't find anything, but I did find that the comic that Tracer "comes out" in is not for sale in China.  I heard it here.  This might be just heresay.
---
I voiced a similar argument that the employees should seek other jobs if the corporate culture not reflecting their values, in the end, we all have a choice to make, if that choice is based on self-value or corporate value it's up to the employees.
---
This statement speaks volumes.  It's easy to give up on a video game, but when it comes to physical goods people won't do shit.
---
This entire comment threath started with someone saying netease can say whatever they want, we shouldnt blame blizzard for it. Me and others said that although netease isnt literally blizzard, it does represent blizzard.
---
You told me they didnt aknowledged it because netease is like their "boss" and then I said why then they lie with stuff like "china had nothing to do with the ban" when it clearly ahd to do (severity of the ban, comments on netease that they decided to ignore mentioning, etc...).
---
Yes, I did mention blitchung ban, but I was never complainign abotu the mere fact he got banned. I complained about blizzard not aknowledging this has a lot to do with china (you even say so with phrases like *"If the company publishing your game says make X change, because of how contracts work, the developers generally HAVE to go along with it/ give it their best effort."*).
---
I never EVER said I dont agree with blitchung having a punishment. Thats something you completely pulled out of your ass with *"So your telling me. That a company has a established rules. A person knowingly breaks said rules. The company punishes the individual based on the rules. The person agrees that what they did deserves to be punished."*. Stop putting words in my mouth that I never said to try to make a point. We arent talking about if blitzchung ban is legitimate or not, we are talking about why blizzard doesnt aknowledge the comment made by NetEase in their name.
---
you think I will watch some random play HS for 12 minutes? lol
---
&gt; But you and the rest of these keyboard cowboy slacktivists can do nothing more than put out some tough words
---
You're making assumptions.
---
&gt; Come back and lecture me when you can show me that you're actually doing something useful.
---
I'll lecture you all I want without your permission, because my government won't jail me for speaking my mind, "dog".  I think it's really admirable (and more than a little suspicious) how tirelessly you advocate for Blizzard's interests.  Maybe they'll give you a cookie?  Or is it a paycheck they give you?
---
If this went completely unpunished the Chinese community (not only the Chinese Blizzard fans) would blow the fuck up. Not saying their wrath would be completely justified but that's what would happen. No punishment = get out of China permanently. It doesn't even have to do with the government. 
---
The statement alone brings tensions high as fuck. Many mainlanders have their blood boiling hearing/seeing it. It's a reflective thing like hearing the N-word as a black person.
---
tbf he doesnt even stream anything he makes youtube videos now
---
Ah yes the pissed of people, some caught up into a movement cause everyone enjoys a good bandwagon. Some are looking for a enemy to vent anger that has been accumulating over the years. Oh theirs plenty more types of people in the crowd but let’s not kid ourselves blizzard can’t anything for those 5 demands.
---
Much like American citizens can’t stop their military actions in the Middle East even if they wanted too.
---
Yeah, defending the Chinese government
---
Like saying to donate and support the Hong Kong protests, saying what Blitz did was admirable, and literally never once saying China was in the right
---
I guess thinking that a fucking video game company is in the right for not wanting to take part in geopolitical issues and just make games is a communist ideal
---
But hey, while we're here

---
Sincerely, fuck yourself, and the bandwagon you rode in on
---
So many are commenting that the punishment was too extreme. But extreme in comparison to what? Well this is isn’t the first time Blizzard has had to punish a pro player for breaking the rules. There have been past cases of players actually cheating in tournaments and received less of a punishment from blizzard, and only after the community complained about it. Now knowing this, Blizzards Chinese statement, their current business ventures in China, the fact that AU players did not receive any punishment for pulling a similar stunt, it’s clear the reason Blizzard did this was not because he broke the rules but the content that was said. They are assisting the Chinese government in keeping the Hong Kong protests quiet.
---
My wife is Chinese, and she said don't let up, it's what China is hoping we'll do. Stay strong fellow gamers!
---
Sorry guys I am little out of the loop with the whole China- Hongkang deal. Could someone explain?
---
Emotes, voice lines, sprays, including the comics with in the games
---
That's simply not true. Anyone is free to go though his or mine post history.

Everyone out here advocating for human rights and this dude over here like "MMMH LEMME SEE THA VIDEO GAME TIDDY"

You're most likely doing fine if this is your first card game :) it used to be my first aswell and i was horrible at the beginning xD (you wouldn't believe how bad if i would be able to show you) but after playing the game for a good amount of time i got better and better until finally reaching legend. Im sure you will be able to do the same once you really get the hang of it :)
---
Btw are you playing on NA or EU ? :D
---
&gt; that’s already been addressed
---
Oh, has it?
---
Well, if you accept a typical corporate non-apology that doesn't even contain the words "sorry" or "apology" then that's your prerogative. But never forget that Blizzard's post from Friday evening was the same level of PR bullshit as EA's "pride and accomplishment" or "surprise mechanics".
---
Blizzard apologized for getting called out on their crap, and they lied to their customers. If China really didn't have anything to do with this mess, why wasn't the AU Team also punished? And why is Blizzard suddenly this completely a-political platform, when just a few months back they were all too happy to get political with rainbow sweatbands and posts about pride?
---
No, this isn't fully done yet, and Blizzard hopes that people will react exactly as you did, so that they can get away with their bullshit and quickly pave this disaster over just in time for the next holiday sale.
---
Oh sure let's call it a conspiracy theory when it's obvious to anyone with any faculty of critical thinking to compare his previous press releases with this crap and see how completly different his writting suddenly is, with a bunch of ESL level mistakes. 
---
He didn't write this.
---
Companies can be neutral and can censor. And customers can get mad at them and can boycutt and protest in response. FFS Epic Games is 87% owned by a Chinese compaby vs 5% and CEO said he would never censor and punish like blizzard did. It's quite telling. 
---
They can cut the stream, they can remove the vods... But punishing like this and declaring in mandarin to your Chinese audience that you will always defend the pride and integrity of the mainland is not a neutral position, it's taking a side.
---
Originally, yes, I *was* making a fairly nitpicky point about actually having read Adam Smith; I won't deny that.
---
But I think you have a fundamental misconception of what capitalism is. The term refers to any system wherein ownership of capital translates to economic (and, inevitably, political) decision-making power. Western market capitalism is capitalist because those who own factories get to decide what the factories produce.
---
And yeah, it *has* existed for a while. Feudalism is basically capitalism taken to the extreme - a system that allows capitalists to effectively own not just capital, but also labor. American slavery is another extreme example, where equality and human rights are so pushed out by profit-seeking that people themselves become capital.
---
The fact that capitalism is older than dirt is not really controversial. Adam Smith didn't invent anything - he gave us a framework (or, really, laid the foundations for one) to discuss what was already happening.
---
How I can differentiate between capitalism and other systems that have trade is by asking who makes the decisions. Communes, like the early Israeli kibbutzim, participate in trade but entire communities decide collectively how to allocate their labor and resources. And yeah, those systems can often be deeply flawed, but it's not hard to differentiate between them and capitalist systems.
---
I don't necessarily think capitalism is inherently wrong, mind you. I think some of the best systems we've come up with so far are fundamentally capitalist ones - I'd point to countries like France, Belgium, or Finland. But capitalism, like any system, can only function when we recognize its flaws and actively work to correct them. If that means using a leftist framework that describes a hypothetical egalitarian, classless society and trying to achieve some of that system's goals, then that's an effective strategy for making capitalism function.
---
Dont bother with this guy, he is probably paid to say this stuff as damage control.
---
Either that, or he doesnt understand the concept of "represent"
---
&gt;This is not from a person wanting to jump on the #boycottblizzard bandwagon. This is from a person who now feels guilt playing your games
---
So much this. Love the diablo games and books and been holding blizzard high since i have a pc. I just can't get myself to even start the launcher.
---
Blizzard is avoiding confrontation. Blizzard was always about making a political point. Just look at overwatch: tracer and zarya lesbians, diversity through all continents. And now they try to tell us they're politically neutral?
---
It's like a cheating partner who tells you that they "would never do that" but still insistingly refuses that you have a chat with that yoga-trainer. The lack of action is enough to not trust you.
---
Release the fanmade mei-skin as official and you'll have your western playerbase back
---
&gt;I'll show you I have the quest, can go first? :D
---
Done with Macdrevious :D
---
Being a 7 win player is way above average. And to get there you need to practice. And to practice you need gold/dust
---
You may also want to check basic card only decks such as the ones on Icy Veins: 
---
[https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/basic-decks](https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/basic-decks) 
---
They already gave you the link for a good starting guide, but be aware that you need to reach level 10 with every hero to collect all the basic cards for each one of them. Try to beat the Innkeeper on Expert mode for each hero ONCE and you'll get some gold, but after that don't waste time against the AI and switch to play against real players. Some of them will have much better decks than you - obviously - but for a limited time event you now have a chance to include powerful legendary cards on your deck (such as Ragnaros or Sylvanas) for free. You will not lose ranks until you reach rank 25 anyway. Then your next step should be to bring one hero of your choice to lvl 20 to unlock the weekly Tavern Brawl, which is fun and will give you some more card packs.
---
And im glad that i dont have to spent any money in HS thx
---
Anyone speaking freely is clearly deranged?  Ah, then you would recommend re-education for me.  In my country speaking your mind is not considered a mental illness.  You're obedient to your government, but disobedience is always an option if one is morally compelled by the circumstances.
---
How was it obviously translated form Chinese? When did this theory pop up.
---
Lmao, even Blitz knew he'd get in trouble for doing it, guess he must be a boot licker too.  
---
Cry more over spilt milk.  He broke the rules, Blizzard revoked the harshness of the punishment, get over it.
---
No one is calming independence in Hong Kong. That is a Chinese propaganda in order to confuse the Mainland Chinese and the Western media so that they won't support Hong Kong. 
---
A local state requesting free and fair election: For the west, that is basic human rights. 
---
A local state requesting independence: For the west, that can be controversial. 
---
Do you get my point? 
---
A side note: Hong Kong was a British colony for 150 years. Western valve is deeply rooted in Hong Kong.
---
We got him during Rise Of Shadows, not during boombsday. So if you played after boombsday but during RoS (so, 2-3 months ago really) you would have gotten one golden for free.
---
If not, well, gotta craft it. Check your collection just in case.
---
If blizzard wants to allow THEIR property to be dictated like that then it's still on them. They don't HAVE to do business in China, but again, profit is clearly more important to them than basic human rights.
---
Renounce warlock is my most played deck ever, it is terrible deck with 0 consistency no matter what cards i put there but i still try to make it work somehow.
---
We joke, but we're all fucked when China takes everything over
---
Dont get the wrong idea I come here to see hearthstone related content alone but they stickied how they were cool with the sub going to shit. To find out (and recently having just seen) the hong kong posts getting wiped and they have no updates is ridiculous. They flip flop more than my mayor.
---
They were given a statement by someone Chinese (Blizzard in China/Taiwan or the Chinese government) and were asked to say those things.   
---
Blizzard is doing this to appease the Chinese government, so they can keep selling games in China.
---
Ditto
---
As long as you lie about it its true. Really nice argument.
---
"Blizzard releases statement obviously translated from Chinese"
---
Conspiratorial bullshit with no evidence from an non professional making dumb assumptions.
---
"promises to 'defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost'"."
---
Blizzard did in no way do this. This isn't even kind of true. The company that controls Blizzard's dealings in China made a statement without consent, nor would Blizzard even be able to say anything about it without getting banned from the country.
---
Literally Alt Right tier dishonesty.
---
I really do not interpret it as independence, but as you said, the CPC is able to spin it as such. 'Liberate X' is more political language than 'Stop brutality in X', for example. For the record, I stand by Hong Kong 100%
---
How is people making memes and saying that it's a pointless change  "Violent rage" 
---
Don't dramatise past events to complain about other people making pointless drama that's pretty hypocritical
---
First thought: Nice idea! How do you find the deck works in practice?  
---
Second thought: What makes this a meme deck, out of curiosity? I don't see anything memetically repetitive, mutagenic, or viral about it, and it doesn't look like it's just playing already memetic characters just for the fun or coolness value. Honestly, sounds like a pretty decent idea that pares the mechanics and flavors of interesting cards together, but not something I'd retweet alongside pictures of Sonic in pumpkin hill or Mario shrugging next to a TGIF logo with "Did I Do That?" written under him. (Not that you're wrong to call it a meme deck, I've seen it used in the context of "not currently in meta" deck ideas before, I'm just... trying to justify that usage of the word to myself.)
---
Imagine having your life so centered around an idiotic forum and its meaningless point system that you start believing people care about that rather than the actual humanitarian crisis you fucking master projector.
---
I'll be fair though, it could be that you're that scummy of a person that you actually believe nobody can sympathize with the HK protesters.
---
Is admitting fault the same as apologizing?
---
Ah yes, the best way to get people on your side is to ruin something for everyone else...
---
Yes perfectly just annoyed someone replied with some random wow hack comedy guy the casters did nothing wrong
---
[This seems like a better translation.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGcLL8VX0AA7jAs?format=png&amp;name=small)
---
1) it doesn't.
---
2) Meme decks are not decks meant to win but rather achieve certain highlights of some epic stuff happening.
---
Corporations care only about profit. This just in.
---
If you were not karma whoring, you would have gone and did something to help honk honk. Not post stuff on the wrong sub because mods are too soft.
---
Are people playing Hearthstone again? Has there been some news that I missed?
---
...mulling over this further, and given the usage of the words "meme" and "memetic" in other contexts, wouldn't the real meme decks be the netdeck powerhouse decks that you see everywhere like Secret Paladin and N'Zoth Priest?
---
If all you've done is post on reddit about it, you're karma-whoring.
---
Doubling down on being a bootlicker. Well at least you’re consistent, imagine thinking a video game company is an authority to be respected, yikes

Nevermind, it's another keyboard warrior. Maybe your apebrain can process it better as a [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/dh25mk/never_forget_who_the_real_victims_of_the_chinese/). You know, spamming reddit or twitch chat won't change the world

My best run so far is 10min 39sec with boom. Go hyper aggro and abuse empty loot boxes so you only draw good cards

---
It's more about the statement than raising awareness. That's my view on shirts like that.
---
Case in point: You don't think 3 days is quick.
---
And so the "bug" required you to send an ID...
---
It's happening. Hearthstone related content on the front page again. Soon, people will forget about all the outrage..
---
...and Hongkong will forever be a part of China.
---
I think it's totally fair to give your opinion on someone's content but I agree this sub was really really hostile to him and I think it was over the top
---
I think your expectation of Blizzard are unrealistic. They are not supposed to be the moral compass. They just make games, that's it. You either like their product and use it, or not. 
---
It's the same with Apple for example. You could argue you can't use their products because Apple uses Chinese labor which may or may not be slave-like. But you probably use it anyway, or if you're not using Apple, you probably use a phone that has components made in China.
---
Therefore as we see, Blizzard faces different reaction than other corps do for some reason. Their actions are scrutinized more than other corps'.
---
I can understand however how this thing happened. People were assuming Blizzard was inhenrently good since the old times. They made some good games, nice people were working there. Then when this thing happened, and illusions were violently dispersed which is why this extreme reaction occurred. 
---
In reality, they were purchased by heartless corp long ago and have become a part of that corp. They have stopped being good long time ago but you just didn't realize it. Now you do. But does it make their products automatically bad? I think not, although I must admit, quality seems to be slowly detiorating lately. They're still usable though.
---
Dude, your IQ...
---
Question: should one consider the discussion of "Human rights" a "Political" matter? Because to me, the whole "liberate HK" thing is about the extradition bill that started it all. So when a kid hops on stream and says that, that's the lens with which I view it (and as a parent, I would explain it as such). Thoughts?
---
It does have relationship, but I was talking about blizzard apology post not mentioning anything about the NetEse situation. Yes, it does have to do with blitzchung, but I never said that i disagree with the fact he should be punished, or that he broke the rules. I am only talking about why blizzard didnt mention NetEase.
---
As much as I'm trying to stay away from Blizzard, Toast playing HS was legit the highlight of my day some year ago or so. Personally happy to see him coming back.
---
Hard choice here: Upvote, because actually Hearthstone content or downvote because China/Hong Kong? :O
---
You're...downplaying it by using the phrase 'justifiable reasons' and saying meaningless sentences like 'China is a sovereign government in China'. With love, I would suggest you take some time to look into the Nazis, look a little deeper into what's happening in China, and then maybe come back to us.
---
This is a good thing??
---
Not surprising. Just like in any other circumstance where there’s two judges who COULD rule on something, whichever one gets to it first is probably going to have his ruling upheld in both places - unless there’s unusual circumstances that lead to an appeal. (Which, to be fair, DID happen here.)
---
I wondered if it would be reasonable in a zoo deck as zoo is just a tempo deck anyways
---
You want to argue about sexualizing a fake character because it offends the creators? I'll bite.
---
Why does it matter?
---
He is, he implied it.
---
&gt; Even Blitzchung himself agrees with that.
---
&gt; You have seen Blitzchung's official statement right?
---
But I see by the same kind of writting of you and Narux117, comments, similarity in the names, times of commenting, and the fact that both of you always come here only to say some bullshit, that you either are the same person with a different account, or someone really really confused about this topic.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Whenever you add a copy of that card to your deck (through magic mirror, picking as a treasure, or any other means), it'll stay in you adventure deck through every other run, even after you beat the 8 bosses and start up a new class. When you play the good boy, it removes all other copies of him in your deck and hand (not permanent) and gains 1 1 for each card. During a run, you can get as many copies of bff, but after you start a new run only 20 will carry over (but that's still topdecking a 1 cost 20 20 with charge and taunt). Hope that clears it up :)
---
If you actually do something useful, I will.

Yep also here. Happens mostly in solo but lots in deckbuilding too. Samsung galaxy s8
---
It's a platform used to discuss the recent events in Hong Kong and China.
---
Yeah, they should’ve just been more honest about their interests and money in China
---
It likely came from most people obviously picking the easy quick options and the services crashed / bugged out, knowing Blizzards history with bugs it doesn't seem too unreasonable to imagine.
---
&gt; it's not ok to hate on a communist authoritarian government that is suppressing the freedoms of it's own people.
---
It obviously is. But interests in Chinese business is making it difficult for a lot of companies to see this.
---
This has nothing to do with left/right. It has to do with the way free speech is affected by capitalist interests.
---
What’s the reward for beating it under 40 minutes anyway?
---
I'mma have to stop you right there. First off, relevancy? Second off, Donald Trump is one of three presidents in US history to ever have an official impeachment inquiry thrown at him. He's not "doing what the other 90% did." He's blatantly abusing his power, going around Congress, and colluding with foreign governments to win elections. Sorry dude, I just cannot subscribe to the conspiracy theory that this is just what we've been doing for the past 300 years.

You realize that Chinese government is literally using these people (without them having a say in the matter) as leverage to silence free speech, right? In a normal world Blizzard wouldn't have punished Blitzchung for speaking out and if mainland China population would be so offended by Blizzard not reacting to something they find offensive (HK fighting for their freedom), THEY would have the right to "vote" by not buying Blizzard's products. But that's not the case as Chinese regime is making that decision for them by strong arming corporations to silence any views about HK movement.
---
I mean yeah if you ignore all the articles circulated at the time and some of the threads created, then yes, that'a zero people caring.
---
Good to know!
---
Please change title to make sense if possible
---
I would say what we are seeing now is reactions of genuine horror and people making a concerted effort to educate themselves and raise awareness of the root problem.
---
Outrage I would attribute to reactionary, misdirected anger and/or indignation. This behaviour is counter productive to any real discussion. There will always be a vocal group of users in any reddit thread who fit that description.
---
ok?
---
Why does Blizzard continuously lie ? Do they think their players are stupid?
---
&gt; Why are YOU so jaded about this entire thing?
---
This indicates otherwise lol. Wanna explain how I’m jaded then?
---
They want to continue in the field and don't want to burn bridges. They hope the next time would be different.
---
Essentially why people did what Weinstein wanted.
---
The British treaty with China in 1997 stipulated that HK would belong to China but would be self-governed until 2047.  That's what China agreed to and that's the official, UN view on the matter.  Democracy in HK is what the HK people are saying they want as their form of self-governance.  China attempting to decide HKs government is a violation of international agreement, so it should be even less up to Blizzard to violate a clearly written law.
---
It's sad Xi isn't sending his best, and just bush league shills that think we're as gullible as the general Mainland Taiwanese are.
---
Oh you're so smart, I never would have figured you were making yourself look like a total moron just to mess with me. You had me completely convinced that you were an actual clueless, uninformed idiot. Bravo, you should get a Oscar.
---
Yes China has not free speech. It is different mentality than western world but who knows, maybe if current generation of chinese kids will play enough western games, then future generation of chinese leaders will be more open minded.

Repost. Literally the top post of the frontpage of this sub
---
My mind is blown that what people cared about the whole time was the player’s punishment and not what it meant about blizzard at all. I think their “walk back” is the biggest indictment for them being an absolutely shit company. They took DAYS of massive backlash to have China draft up a pathetic excuse of a statement that said “we were right, but hey maybe a little too harsh” and people just accept it. 
---
Personally I care little about the punishment and wouldn’t have been on board with the boycott if it hadn’t been for the path blizzard has been on for the last 10 years, but the straight up south parkian statement is gross. Blizzard showed that they are the very worst that anyone thinks of them, but it’s cool, they gave the little bit of money back to the guy that’s probably gonna get harvested as soon as the spotlight falls off him a bit.
---
I'm not advocating for people to walk in and literally shout at other people there. Sure then security would make you do a literal grandpa simpson.
---
But over the course of the day and throughout many people are you going to have to do things that get on the nerves of the attendees in general? You betcha.
---
[Translation of his Q&amp;A] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dgvs5i/blitzchungs_statement/f3ftvkb/)
---
&gt; Q: Do you accept that Blizzard DQ'ed you based on "non-political reasons"? Will you accept the returned prize money? (note that DQ in Cantonese sometimes refers to a ban like in this case)
---
&gt;A: I have to think about that. (seconds later) I will accept the prize money. I've already talked about it. About the DQ, althought I'm still having emotions about it... yeah to be fair I did signed a contract when I agreed to play in the Grandmasters, and I did break the rules, so the punishments are acceptable.
---
&gt; To be fair I did sign a contract with a rule saying not to do such things when I agreed to play in the Grandmasters. I don't think the AU players signed a same contract to play in the university tournaments, so you can't compare the two things.
---
Here's the only way I could have twisted his stances into being a straight lie. As this is the only time he really even references China in any of his statements thus far. Which would lead to believe that he does not, at least openly, believe China had much to do with it.
---
&gt;Q:How do you feel about Chinese money controling the gaming companies?
---
&gt;A: Honestly I don't believe I'm in any place to judge. I am a player, not a "gaming company", so I have no idea what's actually going on behind the scenes. It would be unfair to talk about it (without having full knowledge).
---
So, and burn me at the stake for making an inference in his statements if you'd like. He believes that Blizzard is justified in the actions they took (maybe not to the harshness), based on his own violations of contract.
---
He also believes that it's unfair, to talk about China being involved in it.
---
[They are literally partners you cabbage.](http://archive.fo/QTnj3)
---
&gt;They didn't lie and they didn't need to apologize, they needed to reduce the punishment. They did.
---
They did lie. They claimed it had nothing to do with China and what China thinks. That's a complete lie.
---
The reason people want an apology is that we want reassurance that this won't happen again. By them not apologizing and lieing in the same statement, they have just communicated that they don't actually care.
---
The whole game is just bugging out for me on my android.
---
Brawl into 0/4 taunt and make a comeback from there. Add some taunt totems shenanigans too.
---
Can you clarify what "forcing people to pay attention to your issue" means to you? That's a very broad category, and could be everything from simply getting someone's attention (Hey, have you heard about X?) to constantly blocking their path and invading their personal space.
---
If you condone the latter, fine, that's your business. As long as nobody is getting physical.
---
***Down with Blizzard!!!!!***
---
no. its at best a dubious construct for talking about a personality
---
I agree. I find it sad but the game often has so many bugs that people's first reaction to this is thinking it's a bug.
---
I don't want an apology, anything put out would just be PR-written nonsense. The suspension should not have been one year, and should not still be six months. Not when the punishment for speech-based offenses for another player was less than a month.

Silver immediately stood up for Morey, he didn't wait for backlash. The translation that confused everyone was *not* done by his office and possibly not even an NBA employee ("NBA China" is jointly produced by the NBA and Weibo, and the Washington Post stated that the translation sounded a lot like official state media statements from China - it was probably translated by Weibo).
---
It's happening on my Galaxy S10+, so... no. It has to be something else entirely.
---
When is the CEO gonna resign?
---
Then stop.

And you won't be.

Up to you.

Mark Kern lmao
---
Stop what? Stop asking karma whores to gtfo so this sub can talk about its main topic, Hearthstone?
---
I can understand where you're coming from, but you have to understand other people's opinions as well. Hearthstone may be just a game to you, but it's become a symbol to others of how companies will lick boots and kiss assholes in order to please China. It's showing us of a trend that a lot of people didn't even know was there, a trend that CAN affect people in here personally.
---
It's become the latest symbol in a long line of them. (Most) Gamers didn't care when a Marriott employee was fired for liking the wrong tweet. Many people didn't care when the NBA had to censor a general manager, or when google and apple were pulling apps from their stores. But this event was a wake-up call to the players - playing a game and saying something that China doesn't want can lead to censorship and punishment. It's more personal to gamers when it's one of them, when it's a fellow fan and enthusiast getting trampled underfoot instead of someone unrelated.
---
So while I understand your frustration and I can see your side of things, please look at the larger picture. Look at this as gamers standing up together as a community against a much greater evil, and showing solidarity and compassion for real-life events. Please consider how if we don't stand up now, how long before we see this censorship spreading throughout other games? How long before you have to wonder whether or not saying or doing the wrong thing in game can lead to a company across the globe singling you out for punishment?
---
This may fall on deaf ears, but consider more than the here-and-now. Consider the future, ask yourself if you're OK with Blizzard's non-apology and if you're comfortable with the way that China has been worming their way into the things you love and are trying to change them to conform to their vision and values instead.
---
I have not looked up the Webster dictionary on the definition on propaganda but I thought it was related to false information used for political purposes. After thinking about it I agree with your use of the word propaganda in your statement. Been seeing a lot of propaganda at my university in support of China.
---
Well, one of us desperately stalks people's comments when they run out of valid arguments and one of us doesn't. Such is life. You're probably one of those weak Tim Pool "liberals."
---
Yes. They were hired by Blizzard as representatives of the company, and it was their job to try as best as they were able to ensure the event went smoothly and in accordance with the image Blizzard wanted to project. That clearly is not what happened. 
---
They'd be fine if they were simply ignorant of what was going to happen, or acted as if they were. When they started laughing on-air at the shitshow that they knew was about to unfold at their employer's expense, it's pretty understandable that their employer isn't all that happy with them.
---
"Punishment" is an odd way of putting it in the first place. They have no particular right to be hired by Blizzard for an event. If Blizzard thinks that they actively contributed to this mess, they'd obviously in the future want to hire someone who won't.
---
Lol from retards in comments and in whole section.
---
They were moderators, they were fully awair about what's gonna happen, they were from Taiwan as I remember? I guess so they acted like a bias morons letting it go. I mean if my country is having conflict with another country to let offensive messages towards my countries "enemy" would be a disasterous for my reputation and it would be considered as sabotage and abusing my power for my own political views. Damaging "own" country is morally fine, though.
---
I'magine the situation where on some event hosted in CIS one of russian players with CIS moderators stands up and shout something like "Long live rebellious states of eastern Ukraine, fuck Ukraine" or smthing like that.
---
Or In GB - letting "Revolution now, Scotland will be free" from scottish player with, Argentinian moderators? That's absolutely inappropriate.
---
They didn't stop the damage to the company that pays them money. It's clearly that they made a reputational and direct $ damage of billions. I guess from Blizzard point of view they deserved a lifetime ban.
---
By directly telling the player to "say the words" and then hiding behind their desks, it could be interpreted as them effectively directly encouraging him to say it
---
&gt; Who make suspension decisions? 
---
Yeah. If that was made public, guess who's getting bullied of all social media including Linkedin?
---
Nice! My fastest time was only 9 minutes and 31 seconds.
---
https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3a5xx/blizzard-doesnt-respect-the-human-rights-of-its-customers-major-rights-organization-says
---
They're now human rights abusers.
---
Any reasonable person would say that that is an important topic for discussion here, seeing as how it's monitored by blizzard but not controlled by them.
---
Agreed, and to be clear, this is ILLEGAL.  Always get the offer in writing.  Always.
---
Also, avoid interfering with pedestrians and the flow of traffic. Most people around and about the area will have no idea what Blizzard is or what happened. Ruining their trip to Disneyland makes you the bad guy in their eyes.
---
Heartbreaking finish for Purple, he cane so close again but Quest Druid seemed to fail both Hunterace and Purple.
---
Why are people downvoting you?
---
&gt; Just check the upvote ratings of the Hong Kong related posts.
---
I'm not sure what this is trying to prove.
---
While way overkill imo, it's not new. You can have your credit card on your account, you could be a spiteful ex who wants the account owner to suffer and lose all of their precious games and progress.  The photo id stipulation to recover, remove or otherwise permanently alter an account had been a thing for years. That said, I've quit hearthstone, Diablo and starcraft all together.  Blizzard gets no more money from me. Ever.
---
How dare they punish a person for going political on a stream that is supposed to be 6+! And how dare I ask for Hearthstone discussion on r/hearthstone. I guess all HS discussion belongs to r/HongKong.
---
Really cool game, doesn't quite match HS for me but im still loving it.
---
&gt; You're probably one of those weak Tim Pool "liberals."
---
Wrong again.  I'm awestruck by the vastness of your arrogance and the simplicity of your understanding of things.   Interesting.
---
This is the silly part to me.  Blizzard walks back the punishment and it still comes off as draconian for the sake of appeasing China.  Blitzchung even said he thought the 6 months for himself was still a bit harsh, and I completely agree.  The casters don't need to be made an example of at all though.
---
It feels like Blizzard isn't even capable of walking this back enough to appease their western audiences because they're more concerned with appeasing China.  They just hope they've done enough for this to blow over, when what they've done isn't at all reassuring.
---
Anyway, I don't need this sub to be in constant riot state forever lest we not forget this.  It's simply the case for me now that I'm no longer comfortable giving Blizzard money.
---
Yup.
---
Why do you believe human rights abusers should be let off the hook?
---
They told him to get it over with because censoring someone's speech is against the tenants of the company that hired them.
---
Cause Blizzard are too busy bending over before China these days... Mine also crashes a lot. Mostly happens in crafting/deck managing.
---
&gt; We shall never surrender.

What are you talking about, boycotts are THE thing that work, money talks bs walks they wake up when the curve dips downwards buddy.

I don't. But luckily for me, there are no living "human right abusers" I know.

no one cares about the truth
---
When you post hearthstone gaming content.
---
I thought by "boot licker" he was referring to the original person who wrote the comment criticising the casters?
---
nah it's pretty fucked
---
what if, lez say feno has right believes and is a neonazi in disguise... so in a stream he tells frodan that he desperatly wants to talk some nazi-shit but they tell him "only one line".
---
than on matchday they interview and at the end, frodan gives in "say ur statement and move on", he goes "sieg heil, hitler was right".
---
would frodan be at fault here? ofc he would, so punishing those guys is totally acceptable... but reddit is full of hypocrits, asians, liberals and sjw-morons ofc they cant accept rules and consequences.
---
Then head on over to Blizzard's forums. You'll be happier there, I think.
---
No reason for frustrating yourself.
---
when you stop complaining about what other people are posting about and start contributing game-related content to the sub you ridiculous hypocrite.
---
Congratulations!!!! Post this over in r/ArenaHS they have a megathread for all the 12 Wins
