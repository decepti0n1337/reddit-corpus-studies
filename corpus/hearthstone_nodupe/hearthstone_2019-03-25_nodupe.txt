&gt; Tar Creeper was played in *some* aggro, token, Zoo, control, midrange and elemental decks
---
It seems like no one remembers 5 mana giggling. Literally every deck was made better with it
---
Yes, Hakkar deathrattle would trigger after the end of the game.
---
Congrats, you're only the \*\*SEVENTH\*\* person to post this exact same clip
---
I still like Holy Wrath Paladin. It's not as powerful as it was before the nerfs, but you can still win a lot with it. If they don't print some crazy armor gain cards, it should actually survive rotation, so that's nice.
---
Fair point. Let's see some magician of black chaos and blue eyes shining dragons then! Xyz's would make good as mech I imagine
---
Yeah, that factor, while mostly true, mostly falls apart considering how top-heavy Yugioh gets, and Hearthstone has very few minions above 8/8. So mathematically, most Hearthstone minions using a similar factor would get wiped out by a normal, old school 4 star 1900 atk minion.
---
When I [designed my Nzoth](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b4gylr/heres_nzoth_the_corruptor_as_a_yugioh_card/), I realized that 1700 atk would be really silly, but since 5/7 is still a pretty low  stat line for a 10 mana, I went for completely arbitrary numbers that were closer to 2500ish. (2400/2800) 
---
Whoa. Yeah, that makes this clip even crazier.

O M G NICE

Sometimes I do my quests in casual and since I only use that mode for quests I can't complete in standard (like play as a priest), my MMR puts me vs relatively bad decks often (though I also face net decks every 1/4 games or so).  When I see people playing really janky home made decks but I can tell they want them to work so bad, I pretend I am trying to beat them but hold off on playing good cards or make "mistakes" so they can just barely beat me.  It is worth it seeing them drop cards really fast and go for lethal with some crazy home made deck that they usually lose with, betting that they are thinking "hey my deck actually works!".  
---
If you don't die when you play Bloodreaver you win, the hero power is so oppressively powerful compared to all other hero powers, unconditional 3 damage lifesteal that can target face is worth easily 3-4 mana, for two mana and having unlimited uses makes most decks unable to contest it. 
---
The hero power is too strong to compete with for most decks, the fact that void lord made playing the card insanely safe is problematic, and the ability to cheat out voidlords cheap and early breaks a lot, but the card itself is problematic for it's own reasons.
---
Yep this is a board state in a hearthstone game

I wonder if you aren't just a member of Team 5 who has access to test matches :D

---
This is the peak of RNG in Hearthstone, we will almost certainly never see anything better than this (aside from Yogg casting all three of those in a row immediately).
---
I still think it should be unnerfed. Averege wild game lasts ~7-8 turns, it doesn't affect aggro, Reno decks have kazakus potion and other removals to deal with yogg and combo just don't care because it's faster than big yogg. Also yogg can backfire, even while nerfed he lost me a lot of games by drawing into fatigue or killing me with spells, and won like 2 or 3 games. 
---
Power level of the wild format makes yogg almost irrelevant
---
Summoner geeks.  Google it
---
That‚Äôs awesome. I had the same experience with this deck - probably 20-4 with my own idea. I didn‚Äôt see anyone else using discard warlock through most of that run, now versions of it are all over.
---
prize?
---
Looks  cool, just like Yugioh Anime Cards :D
---
Yogg's problem has pretty much never been power, it's fun.
---
It is monumentally unfun to outplay your opponent for an entire game and win by every metric until your opponent plays a single card which completely randomly turns the game from won to losing. 
---
Umm, my constant loving friendship 
---
Ok thank you, i'll definetely try this one (eu too) hope to get that back

Damn. That was cool.

&gt; First of all, there is a card against aggro that wins the game on the spot: Guldan. Reno does it too. Often also Jaina. Nzoth. All this cards end the game for aggro. 
---
False, false, false and false. Reno and Jaina only "win" if you completley stabilized, play that against a full board and you'll die anyway. Gul'dan and N'Zoth are insane but there are ways to beat it, Shaman can devolve the taunts, Hunter, Shaman and Mage can burn face directly. 
---
&gt; And 10 mana Kazakus potion has 2 AoE options (polly and damage). And it doesn't have to be kazakus potion. Nether, Brawl, Dragon Fury, lightbomb, dragon potion, scream, warpath, haghata scheme, vulcano, defile, it goes on and on.
---
All those are situational and unreliable, Nether and Brawl less so. If the Yogg gets the correct rolls there isn't much you can do.
---
&gt; It's a value card no better than dragoncaller allana. By your definition you could call dragoncaller 9 mana win the game. Similar conditions have to be met, but Dragoncaller is more consistent as a win condition.
---
Don't fucking put words in my mouth, I didn't say Yogg is a wincon, I said Yogg is a coin flip, it's completely different.
---
&gt; Against combo, say Mechac'thun or Malygos, those decks have so much draw that by the time they finish their comno your yogg has maybe like 10 spells max. Good luck.
---
The only prominent OTK deck in Wild is a heavily control-based Mecha'thun Warlock, other than that we have Exodia Mage and Priest shitdumps involving Prophet Velen, all those are very, very slow except Exodia Mage which still often takes more than 10 turns. Don't confuse Standard meta which is just a race to Wild meta, in Wild we don't build rush decks, we build decks that can fend off powerful aggressive decks.
---
&gt; There is no meta deck, other than maybe reno mage or priest, that I would play unnerfed yogg in and make that deck (maybe) better. It's not a good win condition.
---
Your mentioning of Reno Mage as a meta deck further demonstrates your complete ignorance regarding Wild. Now that I stop to think of it, you're constantly mentioning Reno Mage and Reno Priest... that's funny.

I'm not sure what the technically accurate term for the other guy's use of 'or' is, but something along the lines of 'sequential objects' would get the idea across. Essentially, the word 'or' can be used to divide objects in exclusivity (this OR that) or connect objects in unrelation (cannot be this or that, must be neither this nor that).

It is because Toki sucks and probably the weakest of the 3. It was super easy for me to win with the other 2 early on but I have never won with Toki all the way through. RNG is not a good strategy to have in a deck that has to win many times in a row.
---
I got a golden legendary from a free pack so...
---
or watch it on youtube
---
Turn 6 twig into hero power into void lord
---
Because it's a better version and it takes literally no skill so anyone can play it. Pyro actually means it's pretty solid against some aggro decks (it's heavily favored against odd paladin, for example) and it's too fast for any control deck that doesn't have Geist or Demonic Project in their top half or so to ever beat. 
---
You don‚Äôt wait to play doomsayers. You play them right away starting turn 2 and use them to stall for mana gain. Once it‚Äôs turn 6 you can stall with spreading plagues too if you run out of doomsayers or you can branching paths to draw 2 looking for another doomsayer. Once you get to 10 mana you can finally pass and let the mech player build a board then you spreading plague plus branching paths for attack which trades with their whole board and leaves them almost out of cards. You should be able to do that 2-3 times until they are truly out of cards then build up a board of scarabs and buffs that doesn‚Äôt get killed instantly and kill them instead.
---
well... i guess that is some kind of change. i dont think its one that will help hearthstone, but its definitely a change.....
---
thats a bummer, but lets see how bad it actually will be. i cant  believe they just created another dungeon run with a price tag. there's a little bit of hope left in me.

The meta at the time of the expansion's release was changed very little by the release of those cards. [The top decks before the adventure were Midrange Shaman, Dragon Warrior, Tempo Mage, and Token Druid.](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-07-31 )The top decks after the expansion released (and before nerfs) were Midrange Shaman, Dragon Warrior, Tempo Mage, Malygos Druid, [AND ZOOLOCK](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/standard/2016-09-18) 
---
I'd call that a very low impact, especially considering how many of the non-Barnes cards see play in Wild today.
---
I dont think forgetting about a deathrattle classifies you as incredibly dumb.
---
When OniK came out it did absolutely nothing to change the meta. That's what OP is referring to. Midrange Shaman, Midrange Hunter, and Yogg/Miracle Druid were top dogs before Kharazan came out, and that expansion didn't change that at all.
---
The packs and the golden legendary are part of the solo adventure. Because of that it doesn't matter if you spend gold or money on it. Personally though I wouldn't spend the gold and instead buy it with money and use the gold for buying 28 of the new packs. 
---
Mostly agree with this but the question asked was is this fair? Plenty of people are dabblers, so should they really have to play large number of games to even out rewards on par with their skill level?
---
Where I disagree with you is the extent you take the drafts will be boring and have similar performance comments. Drafting for synergy would be huge in such a format and make more variance than you are assuming. Pros would presumably be better than the average in such a format, much like they would in any format which is why I didn‚Äôt find that a strong argument in your initial post. Matchmaking is still a big factor in run win variance. Yes the pros might get less low win totals but are those flukes really fair? It is certainly good for worse players that it exists which is a decidedly different reason than pros win more over time.
---
The problem for me and the reason I haven't expend money on this game since booms day is the abysmal amount of dust and playable cards for 50 bucks, is not worth it, plus the themes of the last expansions have been boring to me. 
---
Thanks!
---
Rotating expansions will be implemented in arena next expansion. It's not unthinkable that a similar thing will be introduced in the future for constructed decks as well.
---
The last time I paid was the 70 packs for $50 pre-order deal. Since then they have been trying to pad the pre-order with a random legendary (which has a decent chance of being garbage) or a new hero which is a hard pass for me. Now this expansion, they are hoping people will pay for the cards AND the single player content. If I have to choose between them I might abandon most of the cards and just go with the adventure since I play more of the single player than I do standard now anyways.
---
Cheers, thanks for that
---
Honestly i think mechs are going to be very strong. The 2 cards that are going to be scary is boomship and the paly legendary mech spell
---
Yeah, because Midrange Shaman was already too strong before they released a card that slotted perfectly into their decks. The release of Karazhan made the top decks STAY the top decks, and Spirit Claws is a perfect example of why.
---
the told prophecies  have come true at last mauwww! the white knights in this subreddit could never longer spew their nonsense that there is no evidence game is dying.  Nice to see how my forward thinking and insightful outlook on the game has proven true. I see things way before they happen, but this is an ability I've cultivated not something based on luck.

---
Can anyone comment on the credibility of this source considering Blizzard normally doesn't reveal this sort of data? Don't get me wrong, I'm not surprised that Hearthstone is doing worse considering how Team 5 has been handling the game, but 52% seems REALLY high.
---
Outstanding move 
---
That's my number 1 want, I was incredibly disappointing they aren't planning to have that in the next year. 
---
For the record Free from Amber could've replicated the "Summon Mechathun" step, but mind games -ing it out made it so much better
---
It's not surprising. Simply how it feels to play Hearthstone just sucks.
---
Since Goblins vs Gnomes we've just had way too much RNG in the game. 
---
There are too much value and power in certain cards. The hero cards are the most obvious issue, but cards like the old gods (especially N'Zoth), Defile, Emerald Spellstone, and so on are just far too strong. 
---
Then we also have literal Exodias within Mecha'thun and Uther, which in my opinion is just dumb as hell.
---
And then we have the issue of combos being far too strong without having any counter play. (Which also is relevant to the Exodias).
---
I love how it's missing 1 health.
---
This guy concedes
---
Its funny really, i know the moment they introduced the jade cards and i was one of the first to say that this whole infinte value was just awful game designe. Nearly everybody liked it at fist and now look where we are know. 
---
For me the game was more fun 2 years ago than it is now...
---
Yogg hunter is quite good. You basically make spell hunter, and add yogg, stitched tracker, and brann if you have him.  
---
Dedication mate... ask your dingo to wake you up at 02:55. They are noctural anyway, aussie boy...
---
Can confirm :)
---
Stop playing on the phone and this wont happen. Or keep whining and see where that gets you
---
Some cards are made just to explore design space, and a couple of years from now shaman could receive more freeze effect cards that can make moorabi at least meme tier
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. I always thought that this game needed an overhaul. I think most importantly to the game‚Äôs engine because I‚Äôve heard many times it‚Äôs hard to work with and for a game that plans to live a very long life you need to have an engine that‚Äôs not so cumbersome to work with.
---
Well all of the current Deathrattle Hunter is going to rotate out soon. Keleseth is actually an important part of the deck, but you have to identify the match ups where you can play your synergies or you have mulligan for things to contest the board and remove opposing threats.

I always play my cards out to show them what i had left, not to bm just to let them know. 
---
The dude had lethal with wurm but he chose to defile and the beetle gave Kripp 3 more armor. Bm gone wrong. 
---
You get better rewards at the end of the month the higher your rank is. However, the difference of the rewards are extremely minimal compared to the amount of time it takes to grind up the ladder. People grind to higher ranks only for their own satisfaction and gratification. If it's not your thing, then I wouldn't worry about it. And no, you don't get extra rewards for 5 wins in wild.
---
I don't think the systen works
---
I hate how true this is. 
---
Wow thanks 
---
I remember when face hunter was all over the ladder partially because it was good, but also because it was like 1k dust with most things besides the Arcane Golems being commons.
---
Do you spend 130 a year? I do and I have every card I want with dust left over including wild cards. I think your numbers are way off. 
---
IIRC you get a golden legendary that you otherwise couldn't get, something similar to Whizbang.
---
I can't even get in. Tried to reinstall it but nope, still nothing
---
I never get how ppl can even think about this to be good, if the supposed decline, I don't think any of that info is true, is right Blizzard will let Heartstone die as they have done to other franchises before. 
---
Blizzard are indeed greedy.. But you can't say wotc aren't! 
---
While that's quite true, I don't think it's the main problem. I'm pretty sure many people love Old Gods having Naxx before. 
---
That still makes no sense as the minion should have only been enchanted and not actually have a deathrattle attached to it. The game SHOULD be able to separate these 2 on death.
---
I quit hearthstone over a year ago and the main two reasons were the power creep/general overpowered situation (it‚Äôs less a card game and more Rock Paper Scissors of deck choice at this point since every meta deck is SO strong that you don‚Äôt have a chance if you didn‚Äôt happen to bring a deck that counters it), and the insane cost of continuing to play.
---
I just can‚Äôt justify spending $150+ per year on glorified Rock Paper Scissors, especially when I like to play control decks and those get consistently shat on by increasingly cheesy aggro decks.
---
Damn that‚Äôs bad. Activision will just fire half of the HS team and move them to Diablo Immortal project or other lootbox game they are planning to launch.
---
It's really difficult to judge how decisions get made and who's responsible for what. Reading interviews and stuff I get the impression that the "old guard" struggles a lot to envision a more expansive game beyond the current modes and interface.
---
Ben Thompson is one of the OG guys lead artist responsible for the look and feel of hearthstone now creative director (Ben Brodes job before game director). He did a great job 5 years ago but the interface has not evolved since even though it should have.
---
He is also the one justifying the cancellation of tournament mode (he was in that dev group). [That interview](https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/16/hearthstones-in-game-tournaments-are-on-hold-so-blizzard-doesnt-disappoint-you/) in particular really paints a lead developper without vision or ambition to me.
---
I'm sure there are producers that equally responsible for hearthstones standstill but we rarely get to know them.
---
And the meta is a revolving door more often than not, inbetween nerf and everything. 
---
I'm barely experimenting anymore. The cost of crafting a deck you don't enjoy is far too high.
---
Well, sure, the very first MOBA-like thing was the custom map Aeon of Strife in StarCraft, and there was loot for killing an enemy, so if somebody killed a thing you almost had killed and the killer was an ally, they got the cash. Meanwhile, if somebody killed a thing you almost had killed and the killer was an enemy, there was no cash because of the way the scripted events worked.
---
Bam, you have denies and assisted farming.
---
If you're facing a lot of aggro, you can sub in some tar creepers for say stitched trackers. Mulligans are important against aggro classes. Hard mulligan for candleshot and keleseth if you know you're about to go up against an aggro deck.
---
So it took them 5 years to add this for arena and we still have an indeterminable amount of time before we get the option the community actually wants.
---
My gaming laptop can‚Äôt even launch this shit in steam
---
Except that‚Äôs 11 mana. 
---
I opened KnC as my first pack and saw golden border for the first card. Felt pretty good and then it was revealed to be Runespear, the second worst legendary weapon. 
---
Don't think this expansion is gonna help much. Looks incredibly uninspired so far.
---
Gotta take risks and become a better game, Hearthstone. You're already behind.
---
that's what happens when you nerf the boobies.
---
&gt;  MTG Arena
---
As all WoW-killers that have come before it, that game will be dead in a couple of months. Pro tip: If it has both Lifecoach and Noxious playing it, it will die soon. 
---
Bro, it has over 5 millions installs, and on peak times it approaches half a mil concurrent players.  
---
It's pretty dang popular. 
---
I feel that feeling even more in MtGA than in hearthstone.  It's just less obvious.  You still have all the "losing to your opponent having the answers when they need them" moments, with an added bonus of mana screw and flood.  Even drawing a measily 2 more lands than the opponent is just an instant loss in the lategame.
---
Yeah, Arena and Constructed are two very different things. I'm pretty sure this will never see the light of day, since "not everyone has a lot of cards from older sets to build from so they can't participate". Guess if some can't, nobody can.
---
&gt; Card Reveal Livestream!
---
&gt; Livestream to kick off the reveal season, featuring Peter Whalen, Cora, and Chris Sierra! 
---
That is a very nice way to see it. It would suck if he would ‚Äûcheat‚Äú. (What‚Äòs keeping him from doing it? Do *all* his youtube videos come from lifestreams?) i‚Äòm just a bit skeptical.
---
to be fair they dont know what boombots do
---
Was that really the best title you could come up with?
---
rank 5 and below takes more time then any other ranks in the season. I usually get legend every season but i cbf this time, worn out after the otk paladin meta, straight into wallpriest/mechathun decks. Its not fun.
---
Not to mention that you HAVE to win on ladder in order to get anything, so ofc everyone netdecks
---
Even if they feel like it was worth it initially, do they want to make that same purchase again every four months?  I feel like it was easier every eight months.  I skipped Kobolds and I skipped Boomsday, and I'm leaning towards skipping this new one too.

---
This x1000. I still love hearthstone, but I barely play it anymore.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
I would play the hell out of any sort of in-game tournament, now that they're switching competitions to this new specialist tournament I'd love a sort of "specialist ladder" that was Bo3 Specialist matches.  
---
Hearthstone is great. Hearthstone is also **EXTREMELEY MATCHUP DEPENDANT** a normal Bo1 ladder is such a coinflip. Obviously the better players still end up at the top over thousands of games by winning a few more bad matchups and a few more good matchups here and there, but it feels like shit having individual games (mostly) decided simply by what deck you are randomly queued into. 
---
I remember when people would say this and then the usual defenders would say things like:
---
- But it's cheaper than Magic...
---
- CCGs are meant to be expensive
---
- You're not supposed to have all the cards
---
Lorewalker cho is a fun card, and this deck is still pretty good vs hunters (50/50)
---
Exactly the same. That's why you can't measure "Are rumble cards played" by comparing with how many cards are in an expansion.
---
At most you can do it with percentages, as in "x% cards of Y expansion are played"
---
I've spent basically the entire tavern brawl trying to fill non-weapon class' hands with deadly poison......i have my own fun.
---
Yeah, last pre-order I got was Boomsday, forget the details but you got a golden legendary for $50 with 50 packs. Witchwood you got 70 packs for $50, which I prefer over the golden legendary honestly. Now you don't even get the golden legendary at $50. I'll just wait till they put a bundle on sale like 30 packs for $20 or something. Should def be like 100 packs for $80 with golden legendary and 75 packs for $50, with a card back or something. 
---
&gt; I found it surprising how often my opponents banned expensive cards when there wasn't an obvious cheap one.
---
Exactly! I had a blast with a Odd Mage that should have worked because people kept banning Baku. Like, what??? For reference, my deck was Daring Fire-eater, Black Cat, Jan‚Äôalai and Baku. I pretty much always lost when the opponent didn‚Äôt ban Baku.
---
Monster hunt and rumble run are too hard? Really? I struggle to get above rank 7, and I can't get pass two wins in arena. But I have beaten MH on all the characters and finished RR on the 2nd run. It just seems like there are obvious ops cards to chose from. I wonder why it's so hard for you....
---
‚ÄúThe sky is falling!‚Äù
---
Honestly, I now just wait 1 week before dusting and crafting any cards so I can just wait and see which cards are not worth playing. It feels like after the first week, we know that 90% of cards are unplayable which therefore makes buying card packs unnecessary. I can literally just do a couple dailies before an expac and just dust/craft the few worthwhile cards. Rotations, while keeping the game from going stale, also killed any interest I had in collecting cards. I personally don‚Äôt find the game fun anymore and get more pleasure just watching Twitch streams (which is free). 
---
i am perfectly comfortable with how i spell, read and talk. i would assume most people are. if they arent, they wont be coming to reddit for help. 
---
This was fun, I liked it a lot. I did a bunch of different decks.
---
This was also a godsend for "play N" quests.
---
Takes an awful lot of factors to set it up for a pretty simple combo paradoxically. 
---
Not sure if it would be exactly balanced, nor would i use the words "every single player ever". I think the arena change is their way of seeing how it goes before adding it to constructed.  It will def need some fine tuning.
---
Yeah, it was really stupid of me to not check the rotations before building the deck. 
---
Very cool.
---
This 100%. Personally I've grown bitter towards Blizzard over the years for their laziness with this sort of thing, as a consumer I do what I can, vote with my wallet.
---
He's a neutral card that's good to play
---
and the worst part is they nerf the supporting/enabling cards, so you're just sitting here with an un nerfed leg with little dust to make another viable deck. 
---
&gt;He didn't open any packs from YOTM. You don't need to be a genius to see he started after WW and don't want anything to do with wild.
---
You are assuming everyone who started after WW doesn't want anything to do with wild just because you don't like the format. Wild is actually the cheaper format in the long run and i'd recommend not ignoring it to any beginner. He might play it in the future. Then the cards will probably be pretty useful, since year of the mammoth sets were some of the most powerful ones in the history of hearthstone.
---
&gt;Yes. Now apply that logic to YOTM legendaries that he won't ever user. He can pull new viable legendaries from the new set.
---
He can, but you assumed he'd pull only viable legendaries ("3200/4800 dust"). He is more likely to pull bad ones, but realistically he will probably get 1 viable one and 2 trash ones. Of course, there is a highroll chance (3 viable legendaries), but the same is true for the rotating sets. There is a chance that he will play wild in the future and get 3 very powerful legendaries for it. 
---
&gt;But you will get usable commons, rares and epics which is way more valuable.
---
Again, if he plays wild, the same is true for the packs from rotating sets. But more importantly, he will still get those even if he buys the year of the mammoth packs. Like i said before, it will take him on average 12 packs to get the 3 wild legendaries. So on average, he is only losing 12 Rise of Shadows packs. Then he has 2 more years to get as many of them as he wants, so he can get most of the usable commons and rares (not really true for epics, would take hundreds of packs). 
---
&gt;Sure if he had gold to spend. He will get a legendary, 1-2 epics and dust everything he pulled which is worth 1/4 of new cards.
---
Again, on average it's only 1200 gold. The literal worst case scenario is that it takes him 2700 gold. We know he has 4000 gold.  
---
As for dusting everything for 1/4 of its value - isn't that what you standard players do every year when a rotation happens? I could say that the same will happen to his Rise of Shadows card in 2 years if he listens to your advice.
---
Kaladesh limited was so ficking good, if only Arena was available at that time... people would play the shit out of it
---
I mean, it's a card game, you're obviously going to have those games where you just have bad luck. It's inevitable. But Magic does a much better job mitigating bad luck and bad starts. Best of 3, mulligan/skry, a lot more ways to combat aggro. It's just better all around, in my opinion. 
---
Players could spend Gold on Adventures.
---
Furthermore, $20 / 2800 Gold on Adventure is far more accessible than Expansions where even getting 20 free card packs is going to barely scratch the surface.
---
I'd even add some of the most powerful decks in Hearthstone's history were far cheaper to make when Adventures were around since you just needed to get some of the earlier Wings.
---
&gt; the auto complete definitely showed it. Was really amusing.
---
"I know what your reno deck needs! Two plated beatles"
---
There has been an official statement. Auto complete is currently not active in wild and there is no ETA when they want to activate it there.
---
they clearly miss judged the power level, but they want to creat some intreating effects so people create off beat decks. I'm not angry about them trying with Moorabi, it was just executed poorly. Had it been cheaper or better stated it might have been a fun meme card that sees non-competitive play, instead of the reddit punching bag it is today
---
Quest Mage only saw play because over 50% of the latter was Druid past a ceartain rank. This is not an overexageration. Quest Mage had a slightly favorable match-up against Druid so it so it was playable. The second Druid was nerfed Quest Mage disapeard. People were just mad they couldn't play curve-stone. 
---
 
---
If you already have regular Baku, you can‚Äôt make any profit. So no.
---
yea, I'm already looking at Magic Duels or MTG:Arena as a replacement because it's just the same shit over and over again.
---
Does anyone know what kind of differences there are between these two Magic's? Will Arena not be F2P or are there other factors?
---
I have freeze issues on pc, any advice? Not the computer, never happens on other games. 
---
Ah yes, the problem is competition and the gamers themselves, not a single finger to be pointed inward.  THE GAME IS TO EXPENSIVE.  I personally cannot keep up, so I don't even try anymore.
---
I hear ya, but "make this card game not like a card game" or "kill all spikes" aren't really objectives the hearthstone team was ever going to consider.
---
Thats why I said "good", not great.
---
He is still the cheapest way to play fully fleshed out decks for people.
---
Even the most cost effective Tier 1 deck is nearly 6k dust atm.
---
Exactly, these reason and many more is why the issue is complex and requires analysis; not just some random person on either reddit declaring with a certainty that this one or that one is more F2P. Magic Arena may *appear* to be cheaper to most, but at best it‚Äôs still just anecdotal.
---
Yeah but what's the percentage on the funrate!
---
You probably already did this, but the PlayRavnica and PlayAllegiance codes are good for 3 packs a piece of the two newest sets if you redeem the codes in the shop!
---
Ah got it.  I'd personally like that but it seems to be against blizzards design philosophy.
---
We have arena because they wanted a draft like system that you wouldn't have to commit more than 15 mins or so at a time 
---
I feel it's the high cost to play the game that's ruining the revenue. 
---
While it's true you can grind to obtain every card and Hearthstone isn't "pay-to-win" by definition, it certainly *feels* like it's P2W and what makes people want to buy packs. *However*, having card packs cost as much as they do is criminal and not everyone is willing to spend that much on entirely digital content. Even at the lowest they are priced with the pre-purchase bundles at $1 per pack, that's not nearly enough value for the money. With the $80 bundles, you only get at most every common, maybe at least 1 of each rare card, a handful of epics, and on average four legendaries (1 per 20 packs) (not counting the added freebie with the bundle). That's merely a small portion of the expansion you get for that much money spent, and the dust amount gained from extra copies is laughably low. 
---
Card packs need to go way down in price, or have more product included with the prices set. For example, $50 should be the price to obtain 2 of every non-legendary card and 1 of every legendary card for the expansion, and $80 could be the price for all golden versions. 
---
For those who think the current prices are fair because it's the nature of CCG's, you would be right if we were dealing with **physical** cards. It's an entirely different story with **digital** cards. Blizzard is selling us **lines of code** for us to **borrow** (read: don't actually own) that we can't hold in our hands, sell for money, or trade among friends. 
---
The value is currently not there. People like value. Simple. 
---
AND took damage to your face presumably against big minions cause you were trying to greed out value so hard. Definitely ded. Super ded.
---
It‚Äôs comparing February of this year to February of last year, which are terrible months to compare because they don‚Äôt include any prerelease bundle or recent expansion. 
---
February 2018 was when there was a set of nerfs (patches, raza, etc) that dramatically changed the meta, so that could have inspired some players to purchase some packs between expansions.
---
Do the math by yourself and you'll see there is no net gain. Craft golden only if you don't have the regular for HoF
---
I went the other way around. I played paper Magic for a time, but quickly got tired of keeping a collection of cards organized. Hearthstone scratched that card game itch while keeping all of that under control in the cloud. 
---
Also, I did use to play Magic Duels, which had a mobile app. Isn't that basically the same thing as MtG Arena? 
---
Stop treating your playerbase like children and be more transparent, you will see a miracle unfold blizzard
---
That's like saying there is no point in watching a weekly episode of a show because you can't judge the season before all the episodes are out.
---
Well, I guess some people think that way, but I don't.
---
&gt; CCGs are meant to be expensive
---
I loved seeing this argument. The anti-gamer crowd spewing the same old "OMG GAMERS ARE SO ENTITLED" BS and what was the best reasoning why Hearthstone HAD to be so expensive? Oh yeah, b/c all of these other physical card games are so expensive. Yeah that's why. 
---
I mean it probably should but I think it treats it as almost a targeted mechanic. 
---
Sealed pack mode would be so great. I don't play Arena any more than I have to, but I'd totally play sealed pack mode all the time.
---
ok how about a different mode that promotes fun decks over high winrate decks
---
So time to stop buying packs, because this game doesn't have long with this world?
---
I believe them because so far I've seen no evidence to the contrary. If Rise of Shadows turns out to include crazy infinite value engines, they'll have broken their promise.
---
Bounce it back to your hand. Youthful brewmaster, etc. 
---
That's not a problem at all, it's a strength. With a rotating set they can rotate out terrible cards and keep/reprint good cards. Instead of always trying to give priest a decent board clear they can just reprint say lightbomb for a year.
---
7
---
I played Dota with intel integrated graphics on a pentium proccessor. Get a refund from who ever sold you that "gaming" laptop.
---
Blizzard just doesn't care about the game anymore. Simple as that.
---
I used to buy the old adventures. I figured the game deserved some of my money, but I refuse to buy loot boxes and gamble for stuff. So I've been a F2P player since they stopped selling adventures.
---
It's always so sad when they die so young.
---
It's simply because they still have enough customers willing to pay. They essentially have the monopoly on digital CCGs and can dictate the price without much fear.
---
That's fair. I've long since embraced the fact that HS is a wacky RNG game, and I frankly wouldn't probably enjoy the game if all the casino effects were removed. But I do know there's a lot of people who strongly disagree with that.
---
I did not, no - the cleric in my hand is the one generated from the spell.
---
Not OP, but for me Monster Hunt and Rumble Run are BS because the game just decides to fuck you over, and you have no say in the matter. I've played Shaw SO MANY TIMES. it doesn't matter if I get perfect buckets. It doesn't matter if I get perfect treasures. It doesn't matter if I get perfect perks. I've only fought Glinda a handful of times because I'll get to that sixth or seventh fight, and the game decides it's time for me to lose, so I get a shit opening hand, mulligan for more shit, and meanwhile the AI "randomly" gets the perfect boss with the perfect hero power to counter my deck, draws a perfect opening hand and has lethal on turn four.
---
Yup. Every expansion marks more passing of time. The game continues to bleed players, Team5 refuses to improve the game for whatever reason, and they offer you less for more each time. Haven't even logged in for Rastakhan and won't be returning still.
---
Brian Kibler made them steer away from "Legacy" when Wild was introduced as to stand out from Magic. a good idea imo
---
I just like that the power level is dropping overall. Less powerful value engines means a single card no longer wins you the entire value game, and that means control decks have to devote more resources to cards other than heals and clears.
---
I'm not convinced that's not an Opossum.
---
18%. Either the combo works and you have fun or it doesn‚Äôt and you don‚Äôt
---
Click bait. The website cites themselves to prove their claim; but if you follow the citation, you can see they literally just made up the numbers.
---
To u/tetnenal u/pyroT3chnica and the 19 jackweeds voting for Tetnenal's comment: 
---
Since we are on the r/hearthstone sub and not the r/HearthArena sub, I'm gonna cut y'all a break and assume y'all are dirty constructed players and not upstanding arena players.
---
Again, hitting Tirion alone is a jackpot. But if you play this out, 90% of the time you are not getting value from both cards in an Arena game. 
---
It could have gone Myras -&gt; Mechathun -&gt; Cataclysm.
---
You are being fully fucked. Just start playing another game man, this one isn't worth it.
---
There are plenty of games that appeal to both casual and hardcore players. Hearthstone is a casual game for the majority of players, that is undeniable. There are plenty of mobile games (candy crush was a random example to show a point) that are casual that also go into a lot of depth just like HS does. Some even more depth than HS even.
---
Just want to point out, that my point was simply that I do not want to play HS on PC and would not play if it wasn't on mobile. I'm not denying HS is in need of new modes and levels of complexity (in a way that is still manageable on mobile). I think there is still plenty that Activision blizzard has to work with that doesn't exclude the mobile fanbase. Hell, a lot of QoL changes will benefit both PC and mobile players. Just last week they reduced the size of the app by half, which is something that should have been done years ago, for example.
---
Yes lol. Still cracks me up thinking about it
---
I spent stupid amounts on hearthstone up until they decided not to implement tournament mode. Haven‚Äôt logged in since. 
---
rude
---
It'll be interesting to see if this year performs better with it being a standard rotation.
---
Probably has something to do with the cost of cards. I used to buy packs all the time when it was around GBP 45.00 for 60 packs a few years ago. Now I may treat myself to a pre-order of a new expansion but that' it. Blizzard have lost money from me because I don't see the same value for my money so I spend less of it. This is the case for me - I'm not saying everyone is the same but it could have something to do with it.
---
Sure, but that's because the Year of the Mammoth sets were OP, in my view. Like, if those expacs had all had their power levels reduced, across the board, more RR cards would've probably seen play. My point is basically that I think RR is closer to the power level Hearthstone should have.
---
&gt; If Artifact or MTG:Arena were better, people would stop playing Hearthstone.
---
I still do HS Tavern Brawls, and quests every once in a while, but I find MTGA to be much better and play it instead, and for far longer each day than I ever used to be able to play HS while still enjoying it. 
---
Addiction. So many features in the game are built solely to keep people playing.
---
It didn't though.  I made maps, it's easy to do damage-based gold or time based gold or literally anything.  
---
They ditched the unique design in early 2016 and tbh the way they setup their shop was pretty stupid. 
---
Buying heroes was way too expensive, skins as well. Asked way too much for a game that struggled to load and reconnect.
---
Already switched to MTGA. I was sticking around mostly for HS memes as, usually, they are dope around this time (when the meta gets stale) and card reveals but so far not much.
---
I do kind of like this 52% decrease in revenue though, maybe finally they'll get their arses in gear?
---
I really like Eternal's model myself. I spent $5 on the AI arena mode yesterday and got 10 packs worth of cards. (120 cards total + a bonus $1.5 refund in gold.) And that's fairly common since it's arena with AI.  
---
Not to mention a vastly different reward structure.  
---
(Eternal packs are 1,000g for 12 cards - you can have 4 copies in your 75+ card deck)
---
You get a daily first-win pack every day, as compared to Hearthstone's weekly tavern pack. Daily quests reward at **minimum** 400g a pack + 2 uncommon cards as opposed to Hearthstone's 3/5th a pack average. For every 2 ranked wins you get 50g and a common card, every 3rd gets you 200g and a rare as opposed to Hearthstone's 10g per 3 wins. Watching the entire community and official tournaments will generally net you 5+ packs worth, watching normal streamers will get you several individual cards. They fairly frequently release new free cards in between expansions to freshen the meta a little.  
---
By the time the new full expansion is released - as opposed to the alternating Adventure set - in Eternal I generally have 70%+ of the entire last set, including max copies, without spending a cent. Although I do buy a lot of cosmetics in the game instead.
---
Yeah that is a perfect example. So now if I'm playing against that card I can't just calculate the odds of a particular Shaman spell out of all possible spells. Now I have to consider the odds of the first choice giving a targeted spell, the odds of the opponent taking it, how that may impact the cards offered on the second choice (which may have a higher probability of a boardclear but ONLY if they picked a targeted spell for the first choice) etc..
---
Suddenly it's impossible to calculate probabilities unless your brain is a supercomputer. All because a competitive card game can't handle the mechanic of selecting two targets with the same card. It's unreal.
---
There is only one answer: Because people are willing to pay that price. Paper TCGs cost a lot more so they instantly had a large number of people that deemed it cheap.
---
I got a combined three rares from my three packs. About 150 dust total.
---
&gt;the abysmal amount of dust and playable cards for 50 bucks
---
This has, honestly, been the problem for a long time. It was always a gambler's fallacy with good pulls making it onto the subreddit but the actual drop rates were crap. All versions of ranked have such a tight and demanding meta and the drop rate from packs is utter crap.
---
Same here. Really hard to even keep up with the daily quests. Sucks to play Hearthstone right now.  
---
Thanks for the reminder. Pulled a golden Bittertide Hydra and golden Pyros from the Ungoro pack! Woo!
---
I still remember the Blizzcon where they started the Heathstone stream, only for the audio to not work and they cut to something else like Starcraft until Hearthstone was ready.
---
Hope you like this little summary of the decks of this expansion, what deck you will miss the most?
---
Yeah. I'm honestly just tired of Hearthstone. It's still an amazing game and I loved the years I spent on it, but no amount of new cards can make the game feel fresh to me. I am cautiously optimistic about the upcoming single player content. 
---
They won't. Maybe Blizzard of aeon's past would have, but under current management they are much more likely to fire or re-locate 90% of the team and throw the game on life support.
---
I have skipped now multiple expansions, the last I played was KnC , I think they need a complete game overhaul. 
---
Unfortunately, your submission was removed because it is a pack opening.  All pack opening submissions should be added to the [Pullsday Thursday pack opening threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=Pullsday+Thursday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).  They are stickied to the the subreddit every Thursday and allow you to show off your crazy or unlucky pack openings.  You are also welcome to post in /r/HSPulls.
---
Because it's free to play and because people validate the price for additional content by paying for it.
---
A F2P system likely cannot survive for long at a high level without giving players more for nothing but less for something, at least not card games.
---
Then why are you acting like you are getting robbed?
---
Wild is already suffering from a low playerbase and long queue times, splitting the format further would kill it for sure.
---
You just need one Standard deck.  Standard decks are always on top.
---
So basically Hearthstone died when Ben Brode left.
---
You happen to have a list? 
---
I don‚Äôt think you get it. I don‚Äôt mind playing someone using all the time, you are entitled to do that. What I don‚Äôt understand is why you start to do that after you have lost the game, just to be annoying. If it was one, two turns, ok, but you on fatigue, no cards in hand and still taking all the time after 20+ turns never doing that, really?
---
New game modes open up playability for unused cards and makes everything fresher. To answer your second question, MtG has so many game modes that I'll probably make a huge mess trying to write them all down.
---
4 mana 3/3 soft taunt is pretty bad - I think immortal prelate is worth a shot in that deck though
---
At the same time as Apple event, ballsy.
---
Hearthstone does a good job of reeling me in like once a year. The game looks different enough that I get immersed for a month or two, then I come to the realization that it is just more of the same. I still play arena every once in awhile though...
---
People say Runescape is dying/is dead, but it‚Äôs still going strong after 18 years. Hearthstone is gonna go on a lot longer than 5.
---
Well, what do they expect when they‚Äôve run the game into the ground by:
---
1) Mishandling of the Evergreen set (constantly killing cards people love instead of balancing them to be fair, but playable ‚Äî see Keeper of the Grove etc. Also see: killing old cards instead of fixing new ones like Ultimate Infestation and how they killed Innervate/Wild Growth/Nourish).
---
2) Constantly printing Auto-includes to push sales removing any deck building decision making since most of your deck will be comprised of whatever cards are obviously most effective.
---
3) Printing new cards instead of just fixing old ones like Magma Rager/Ice Rager or Booty Bay Body Guard/Heckler.
---
4) Refusal to do an overarching adjustment for old cards that no longer make them money ‚Äî for example, there are tons and tons of evergreen cards that are totally useless garbage and or pack filler. Seriously why are no cards ever buffed? Make keeper of the grove a 2/3 to make it more inline with Fireplume Phoenix and Spellbreaker or give Guardian of Kings taunt or make Holy Light heal 7 or something for example.
---
5) No modes players have wanted literally forever like 3 player free for all or 4 player 2v2s or custom games where players could choose what sets to allow etc or you know just a tournament mode.
---
6) General Power creep ‚Äî this has probably exacerbated by the move from 2 to 3 expansions per year. The season 1 world tourney lists for Paladin included holy light and guardian of kings unironically. There was a time when the mighty Sen‚ÄôJin was considered an excellent card. Remember when we had Jaraxxus who was actually a fair, but still strong in the right list hero card? Now we get auto include deathknights with absurd power levels.
---
7) When a class is behind they usually just release a card like UI or Duskbreaker which can singlehandedly swing the win rate by itself. This means games are no longer as much about incremental value over time like they used to be and are more about who hits their ‚Äúbig boi‚Äù cards first.
---
8) Infinite value can be fine if balanced properly to be fair I think ‚Äî see a Hogger or Illidan for infinite value that‚Äôs too weak or Jade Idol for infinite value that many players found oppressive for example.
---
pretty good, some of the cards would work well in HS and spice it up.
---
Casuals destroyed by FACTS AND LOGIC
---
yeah, that's weird. Hopefully those classes without will get more powerful cards to compensate
---
Plus, when it comes to Western Markets, if we were even in a position to want to play an Asian Mobile game then why would we get something that is stylized in a Western manner? I'd rather opt for Azur Lane, Girls Frontline, or some other RNG waifu simulator with explosions.
---
They should have just made a new fucking IP for their mobile game.
---
Magic Arena is really fun. I'm just starting out with it and trying to figure out how to build a decent deck with it without spending much. Seems like the playing bonuses are a little better than in Hearthstone.
---
Oh no, they gave everyone free legendaries to trick us. It's not like you can just be happy with what you got and not buy any more packs. Especially since opening a legendary means your pity timer just got reset, so hoping to suddenly open another in a few packs is just stupid. 
---
I replied to other guy on top, I guess you don‚Äôt get my point. I don‚Äôt mind you using all the time, you are entitled to do that, my point is starting to do that after you lost the game. I understand that some turns you should do that, but on fatigue, no cards in hand, really?
---
STOP TALKING AND SHOW THE CARDS
---
You're right - I should have clarified that I believe multiple card games  can exist and thrive.
---
If I'm acting like I'm getting robbed then surely you can point out the comment in this thread where I'm complaining? Or are you just making more shit up now because you fucked your reading comprehension and want to cover for that?
---
He's gone, get over it.
---
Looks like it is streaming live to YouTube as well FYI
---
Many people don't seem to want 'crazy!' in their games, so they get meh.
---
ResidentSleeper
---
Every time someone brings up Pauper I think, ‚ÄúOk, that would be cool,‚Äù but then realize how much of Hearthstone we would lose with a format like that. Currently almost all decks, both meta and casual/fun, depend on Epic and Legendary cards because the team constantly chooses to print the fun and crazy cards as Epic rarity and powerhouse/deck-defining cards as Legendary. 
---
For example, Odd/Even. You could never play a good Odd/Even deck in Pauper because the defining cards are both Legendary. Then the meaty cards that make up the Odd/Even decks like Gloom Stag and Glitter Moth are Epic. Sure, you can try playing an Even Shaman and benefit from Murkspark Eel‚Äôs powerful battlecry, but it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to hurt your deck that much for a single card. This example can be applied to almost every other deck that has a theme or archetype. The only one I can possibly think of that has a chance to stay mostly the same in Pauper would be a Beast/Aggro Hunter, but I feel like Hunter would end up just dominating Pauper regardless because of its massively powerful commons/rares they keep consistently getting.
---
I would love to play in a casual Pauper event/tournament and see how it feels firsthand, but I can‚Äôt imagine myself growing to like/love it.
---
I agree.  Depending on what happens with this next xpac, my plan is to shift my money to playing MTG:A
---
It's just a better game, and the last thing I'm going to do is bet AGAINST magic's ability to stay relevant.  
---
I... turned it off already. Yeesh.
---
the changes made to the reveal stream is a good view of everything currently wrong with not just hearthstone but blizzard in general. 
---
It is what I did this time. Kinda feels bad, but at same time doesn‚Äôt really. Being fair if he had started to play normally after I would had finished the game ASAP. When I realised he was doing on purpose I let the game go the distance.
---
There is speculation that the Shaman death knight card was going to have freeze mechanics (like a freeze a character hero power or something) but Blizzard changed it because they felt that it led to frustrating gameplay
---
Not really true. Tavern brawl *still* promotes winning because of the 10 gold per 3 win metric
---
No
---
Literally just left HS like two weeks ago for MTG:A haha
---
My friends and I talked about HS regularly and our biggest disappointment about the game is how long they let oppressively OP decks stay oppressive, and also how they fixed it by nerfing the cards in those decks (often into oblivion) instead of buffing others to be competitive.

I stopped playing when I got all the golden heroes. I have won 12 in arena and have gotten legend on ladder. I only come back for quests and play meme decks for like 15min not even every other day. What incentive is there to still be playing when you have achieved this? More play modes, formats and achievements would get me back. Not just new cards every now and then. This set is the first I haven't even bothered to get the preorder package, and I used to be a whale. 
---
What is this shit, a talk show?

Remember when Brode and Frodan would meme and laugh their way through it? That's how you do it. 
---
Savjz wife gets fired and they keep this guy on the payroll rediculolious
---
This community manager is irritating.
---
so thats why they communicate a bit more
---
Yeah, back in the days it was better... but it‚Äôs still good to watch, so I definitely recommend going over right now and watch it 
---
I got Ozruk and Clutchmother Zavas i know i shouldnt complain about 2 legendaries but my Ungoro legendary luck has been brutal
---
I am watching it, hence my disgruntled comment.

Count me in that 52%. Sick of OP RNG cards swinging games.
---
Priest doesn‚Äôt need healing from Zilliax, go Lich King.
---
&gt; Even if the Bomb deck isn‚Äôt comptetitively viable, the flavor of it is exquisite and I will definitely be testing it out.
---
I am **so tired** of seeing this bullshit EVERY Hearthstone expansion. 
---
"Well, 70% of these legendaries are just garbage memes, but I'm looking forward to testing it out and I'm glad Blizzard prints these!" 
---
Followed by 12 months of a Meta dominated by ~5 legendaries, where 99% of decks are net decks, and nobody plays that trash tier meme card. 
---
Yes, because the thing that will cause them to allocate funding toward the game is that gaming losing profitability.
---
Right on time since Vilespine is rotating, I think this is an auto-replacement.
---
Bruh... Do you not know the history of WoW itself? In many people's opinions, they basically wasted characters from the RTS games, during TBC. Lady Vashj, Kael'thas, and Illidan were all killed off when more could have been done with them. I mean they fucking brought Illidan back because they killed him off before.
---
I can understand where you and others are coming from but I don't get why it's such an issue. For one, the expansion themes they come up with don't necessarily fit existing characters (Why the fuck would you want a SECOND Harrison Jones in League of Explorers, for example), and for two if they had put existing characters into every expansion, I feel like we'd have run out by now. 
---
I understand there's a lot of notable characters in WoW but like... I don't think there's enough to be sustainable for ~23 legendaries per expansion. If they want Hearthstone to last a while, they'd rather pace themselves, and I can respect that.
---
It's bulking season brah
---
You can put it in any deck, or only on the evil ones? 
---
They usually have one or two classes lagging behind in reveals that end up being featured in the final reveal stream.

4/1/3 | Your Hero Power gives this weapon +1 Attack instead of replacing it.  
---
I was thinking the same thing. I would imagine that it will.
---
absolutely disgusting .. hated every second of it .. never again.
---
Well, no excuse to not put in Janalai shrine now. Shrine + Fire-Eater + ping on 3 is 9 dmg.
---
this seems stupid, they should have gotten a specific name for these kinds of bombs, thia generic "bomb" thing introduces so many inconsistencies and confusing wording
---
Absolute trash. How was this ever printed.
---
Sounds too fun to be really powerful. Probably just outshined by Rush Warrior.
---
0 innovation in 5 years. No new classes or game modes, no effort to reduce rng or making the game competitive. Game getting more expansive every year (big set + paid expansion 0.o and core set losing pieces every year).
---
I think he's implying discovering [[Kalecgos]] due to this discovering mage minions
---
Toxic Arrow is mediocre, but it's still removal. Not even close to as bad. 
---
You can do a thematic throwback without recycling.
---
Zavas is fun to use in tavern brawls. That's why I've kept her. 
---
Kind of a flavor fail. Doesn't make sense for a wrench to put a bomb in your opponents deck. Also, its title is a reference to the sword in the stone, but its mechanics don't reflect that in any way

Some players are asking for returning mechanics for a while. 5 years anniversary also seems legit.

10/4/12 Dragon | Your first spell each turn costs (0). Battlecry: Discover a spell.

Which one? I haven't seen kingsbane ever since the nerf and exodia mage is rare, but it isnt out yet. It probably will be with rotation.
---
To all those Blizzard fanboys saying things are going to change with Hearthstone: watch this reveal stream. It had it all. 
---
Bugs so massive the card literally doesn't work.
---
Asinine conversations about nothing to waste time and rope every turn.
---
Recycled card ideas using recycled animations.
---
Hardcore pack-filler (Boom's scheme is insultingly bad).
---
It's exactly the same (or worse) than past expansions. I'm sure Blizzard will flood reddit over the next few weeks talking about how "excited" they are. But so far it is business as usual.
---
He made a joke off of how Troggzor the Earthinator was predicted to be better (and wasn‚Äôt). I made a Captain America reference to that reference. Sorry there‚Äôs not more to the story
---
Not even 4 Mana 7/7. Literally unplayable
---
So not an exact copy?
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but these cards were very likely conceived a full 6-8 months before yours. Blizzard designs cards several sets in advance.
---
Now mage too can become wall/ressurect priest.
---
But those aren‚Äôt even close
---
It's a bit annoying to be that the effect is only a slight variant of the original, the first half the of text is the exact same. And the boombot art isn't different 
---
???
---
Are you seriously trying to act like there was copying done?
---
Get over yourself rofl. The designs aren't even particularly similar.
---
Warrior still goes [[Brawl]] + [[Shield Bash]] + "Heh, greetings!", seeing that he spent 'only' 2 cards against your 2 likely heaviest ones.
---
the reveal show had a bug in the gameplay where lackays weren't received when they should have been.
---
Is there a reason they never call other streamers like trumpSC or kripp? I mean I could see the forfer giving bad pr because of his username, but I can't think why krip couldn't be a host.
---
why I complain? easy answer: shitty slow stream, tons of bad plays, unfun and 100 times heard comments from the devs, bugged game
---
do you need more?
---
*laughs in Dota Auto Chess*
---
You added a few extra words to that title.
---
Thats what he said
---
I agree, and I feel the same way. I also played in the beta and have been playing daily, except for a while under Un'Goro when I was sick of the game. Its not weird people feel burned out, it still is the same game as it was 5 years ago. I hope Blizzard will make another card game at some point and it will be just as fun for a few years. In the meantime I hope other card games will entertain us and keep evolving the genre.   
---
This is not me quitting, by all means, Im still having fun with the game, but I am ready for the game to die some time in the future

5/-/- | Destroy all minions except one. (chosen randomly)  
---
It‚Äôs fucking hilarious how often people say this shit in Hearthstone subs. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of this mechanic it‚Äôs exactly the same as X except in scenarios A, B, and C‚Äù. So what you‚Äôre saying is it‚Äôs a different mechanic
---
Yeah, looks like for Discover and similar random card generating effects only Classic and Basic cards are allowed. No Lackeys in those sets... 
---
That's funny cause the very first thing I thought up was the same but with mirror image instead of artificer, I did try artificer after awhile but ultimately doomsayer ended up getting me the most wins.
---
Wait for the vod and skip over the stuff you dont like?
---
He was referencing Kalecgos? Kalegos? the new dragon legendary for mage
---
I don't mind the people talking, but they talk for waaaay too long. Its fun to watch HS streamers, and if they don't talk it gets boring. I however expect some focus on SOMETHING rather than just random ramblings, and 10 seconds at the end to play cards
---
Then why are you commenting in an attempt to defend Blizzard? If pally didn't have any new cards to be revealed then it didnt need to be part of the REVEAL stream.
---
He may wanted to say more canon accurate
---
Whoops
---
Bugs are ok, but Cora talks so much and play the turns super mega slowly, is not fun to watch at all
---
I really hope they drop the personalities from these streams and just use the team 5 members...  
---
What's wrong with having the actual designers and developers showing off the cards? Whalen is great, and from the videos it looks like the other team members are all fun cool people who have tons of insights about the game, you don't need to pay streamers and youtubers to cut off Whalen, play like trash and tell terrible jokes.
---
This card is absolutely mental.
---
all ive paid for is the medivh skin, am i allowed to complain that their business model is absolute dogshit and id probably support the developers with my money if it would feel reasonably priced? dota is f2p, i buy every year several of the purely cosmetic things cuz they feel like high value plus give a percentage to creators or professional players.
---
Eh, debatable, it curves into your opponent's blood knight. 
---
2 drop legendaries should always be treated with caution. One eye shut to Arugal for now but still.
---
No it wouldnt. It would still suck. It'd be decent if it gained in 3+ increments. 
---
I will make it legal.
---
That's mean, but made me laugh.
---
I believe it‚Äôs the same for all revive cards. 
---
Are we 100% sure they didn't miss a news item on the entire Paladin class being moved to HoF?
---
whats the difference between recruitment and seance?
---
Glinda+innervate+lackey+this
---
They didn‚Äôt want to spend time making new cards so they just picked ones from the leftovers file
---
No matter what cards come along, the meta is more or less always the same. That in itself is mostly fine, but incredibly far from the average player. You can watch steamers and YouTubers play these decks until you are blue in the face, but the fact is that the average player can hardly make even a lower tier deck because of the cost. So the average player might only play the weekly TB and that's it.
---
It becomes this continued cycle of you don't have even a crappy deck to get a handful of wine with because you go up against T1 meta decks constantly. Then you finally get enough dust or gold to make even a T2 or T3 deck and guess what, expansion time! That deck is useless now! Maybe introduce a mode where you can play with decks up until a certain expansion or up until the most previous one while you get enough stuff for the newest one. There's all sorts of ideas, but as the average player myself, it's just impossible to keep up and more importantly, HAVE FUN while doing so.
---
It's in classic, I guess. Same reason why they gave Illidan a new animation
---
Or if you pick one of the spells you can prep them out for free. Summon two legendaries seems pretty good. 
---
Its still kinda garbage at the end of the game lol, if this gets to 20 armor, youre in a control mirror and its still gonna be kinda bad
---
I hate how Discover interactions are phrased. Do you gain a copy to your hand or not?
---
I've thrown a lot of money into the game over the years, but not for he last year or so. The game is simply too expensive. The greed is catching up to them now.
---
4 4/3 discover a card from an uncontrolled pool isn't very good. Compare to \[\[Shifting Shade\]\]. But given that it works with both pirates and burgle synergy, it could see play if given the support.
---
I'm not going to comment rn on whether or not she's fun to watch rn, just want to note there totally *are* people who are making totally blatantly sexist comments.  It's not the majority or anything, but it's still worth noting, I wasn't paying much attention to twitch chat but I'd still say a significant number of the times that I looked at it, there was *some* sort of sexist comment.
---
It's certainly important to clarify your specific criticisms, but that doesn't have to be in the form of 'the other type doesn't really exist'
---
Just get Glinda and innervate. Infinite mana
---
You play against actual people though still, right?
---
Best generic turn 7 play which may clear small board himself no matter you behind or ahead on board. You need to drop more big bomb to finish the game after that aka old CW style
---
69
---
Don't the terms "rastakhan" and "frozen throne" have more searches, because of the Warcraft universe? Also, "kobolds" are fictional creatures appearing in countless franchises/universes, including Dungeons &amp; Dragons, so not all of the searches are hearthstone related.
---
Sure, they're being a bit slower than ideal. I was just pointing out you were wrong in both the title and content of your post. Which also seems to miss the point of reveal streams.
---
That card counts, [[Iron Juggernaut]] does not as he shuffles a ‚ÄòMine‚Äô and not a ‚ÄòBomb‚Äô
---
Yup. If you're playing your own deck and doing alright, you're rewarded by getting paired with people playing overpowered netdecks, just badly. Fun.

it would be so much better at 3, heck at 2 you could do a nice combo with [[Geosculptor Yip]], but it's not even close to viable, Armor Warrior is the next Frost Shaman it seems

In paper MtG it's a surprisingly well balanced format with a lot of variety in the decks you can play. I think it's actually the fastest growing format right now because it's non rotating and cheap (Just look at the deck prices [for pauper](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/pauper/full#paper) and then compare them to [modern](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/metagame/modern/full#paper)). One of the reasons it's so balanced is that due to limited formats such as draft and sealed, there needs to be answers across all rarities. For example, you have [[[Impale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=439733)]] at common, [[[Murder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=447246)]] at uncommon and [[[Vraska's Contempt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=435283)]] at rare. Vraska's Contempt is obviously a better card but you still have the tools to deal with creatures at common rarity.
---
As for Arena, the client currently only has the cards from standard in it so you lose access to a *lot* of the old tools. Pauper is also an event that comes around every now and then, much like HS's tavern brawl. I haven't actually played much of Arena's pauper but it seems like it's balanced enough.
---
This was the second time i quit a hearthstone official stream (first being Jia casting). Not hating on women casters/ players but I would like to see people that can play a deck better than a random rank 25 hearthstone player. Raven seems like a god next to her.
---
Like sure, they didn't see the prep wand when they kept saying how good the prep play 2 legendaries would be. But how can you make such a bad edwin turn? Its like a natural instinct to wanna use as many cards as you can to make edwin big (esp with shark) but I guess a 1/2 dagger is better value.
---
I didn't really like the top 2 or top 3 brawls, but this one was different. Probably my most played brawl in a few years now. The mystery ban option was an amazing choice to implement. I didn't like that it was super restrictive on mana costs, meaning putting more than 1 copy of a 3 mana or higher card could just screw you completely. Aggressive decks are the reason I didn't like the top 2, 3 brawls, and while there was more variety this time around, it only gave those decks more win conditions, making even slightly slower combos more difficult to play. 
---
He's not wrong though. Its not about "sexism is an absurd concept", its about the fact that pretty much anything negative said towards a public female figure (often times even just a  fictional character) is automatically "sexism". Which atleast on social media has become *more* common than actual sexism itself. But people react very emotionally to "vile" comments like you put it so a few shitty comments get treated as "this entire community of thousands/millions is sexist".
---
Ahhh, yes that definitely explains and I get what you mean with this being the first set that they're releasing where they've been there from the start of its inception.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Best this post.
---
Blastmaster? More like Assblaster!
---
The Dungeon Run variants that replaced single player adventures about a year and a half ago have all been available to play fully for free, but the recent "year ahead" blogpost said that the next one will primarily be pay-to-play.
---
that's how I felt because for a casual player like me, I barely have time to learn the previous xpac before the next one comes out.  I'm just getting further and further behind...
---
...which is what Blizzard wants since I'm not a spender. 
---
Oh yeah haha 
---
So just Brawl or Twisting Nether 
---
Funny that you hate the only female that's been on a reveal stream. Surely this must be a coincidence.
---
Game will be dead by 2042 probably
---
When they were playing that first game they shuffled 1 bomb into the deck but got 2 boom bots???
---
That's fair. Maybe we're all just realizing how tired we are of these reveal formats? 
---
I get so excited to watch these. This stream was awful. I stopped watching less than half way through. 
---
Rafaam is a great counter. Turn all the bombs into legends.
---
That art is Bad. Like reallllly bad. Comon Blizzard wake up.
---
Ngl I definitely read that in Killian's voice.
---
God damnit Khadgar.
---
I was waiting for another big spell for Kalecgos, this fills that role pretty well. Control mage looking kinda nice, Khadgar too
---
She's better than you'll ever be.
---
My guess is that they made it so random card generation doesn‚Äôt put cards from the new expansion. That stopped the lackeys from getting added to the hand. I‚Äôm not 100% sure but none of the card generation had new cards.
---
They want to push "Summon Mage" and Khadgar is the hero of the expansion. Combine those two concepts together and presto, this card. 
---
even rogue tho
---
Considering all the abuse he's been through, Millhouse is made of some tough stuff.
---
Also you find him in the Arcatraz, so he's clearly not just some random mage you could pick off the street. Dude is dangerous.
---
If you look at the other cards from the reveal stream they DID do more with it. They basically reprinted orig. Dr Boom that gets 2 Boom Bots for each bomb in the opponent's deck. There is also another Warrior weapon that puts bombs in your opponent's deck. So this seems to be Warrior's theme for this expansion.
---
You can have balance without bad cards, and this card is objectively a bad card. 
---
Frankly, I think Chakki done a mistake by playing Cho... After playing Rafaam, any player dreams about great card. A real salesman will only show you strong generated cards. Here Rafaam is played and the very first and ONLY  minion played is Cho... The first of a loooong series I bet.
---
So do all of the 3/2 weapons that have upsides. A vanilla 3/2 isn't worth 3 if a 3/2 that gains durability whenever a secret is triggered is also worth 3. 
---
Well, at least it probably is a more powerful card at a low mana cost vs high.
---
Still a mask, theres no imagine if he is full mech, he just got an armor suit
---
Maybe if it's 1 mana, and its effect gets copied by DMH it could see play. Assuming that DMH is even a good card begin with it.
---
I think Shieldblock, Drywhisker Armorer, Bring it On are still most of the time the better choice.
---
But how its currently represented, a 4 mana 1 armor every turn. That's a candidate to be the worst card in HS history.
---
This guy is right on all points
---
Man I really liked Ben Brode, it was a bummer when he left, but I think he made the right choice
---
Marin the fox died for this.
---
You seem like a lovely person.
---
It would still probably suck. Against aggro you're going to be mulliganing this away and against control the mana cost isn't a big deal. Against midrange it still isn't strong enough to keep in your starting hand, which is what you normally want to be doing with these upgrade cards.
---
1 armor per turn held is just so weak. I doubt this would be played at 0 mana. 
---
I am missing something or should this be wrenchcaliper?
---
The cards alone may not be that strong, but at the point you have enough of these bomb shuffling cards, there comes a point when the strategy is actually viable.
---
Ya know, i kinda wanna rank up
---
You‚Äôre such an unhappy person. 
---
Almost all mage cards revealed, and paladin let me see...ZERO. That distribution of cards is awful, this was just a mage card reveal with constant roping and boring streamers.
---
Don't really need Thaurissan, you could use Leyline to reduce Khadgar generated by Simulacrum to 0. Still a Wild combo, but still.
---
This is exactly the kind of Rogue card I like to see.  This will be a Kibler day 1 streamed deck.  It is an upgraded Marin, discover treasure makes it insane.  Doubling the lackey effect and treasures with Spirit card.  Easy access to cheap lackeys.  Shenanigans with treasure.
---
Yea, I'm guessing the original intent was to shuffle bombs or do Boom Bot damage, but they found it was too powerful in testing and changed it to this as a safe alternative at the last moment. This feels like the Shaman Death Knight all over again.
---
And my axe!
---
idk but doesn't it just seems bad that you can't play a deck because of something that happens literally every second?
---
All of these upset people in the thread jesus calm down, Papa khadgar already got a Hero portrait, you should be thankful he is even a card 
---
The reveals are always slow. Talking about the match is the point.
---
I thought it was a fan-made for a moment, due to the art, so yeah.
---
50 dollars? You have to spend 80 to get the new hero. It's fucking highway robbery
---
I'll try...
---
I play a non-baku build that isn‚Äòt perfect but does fairly well. Its gameplan really is to gain sheer infinite value through janalai. That means i throw elekk, banker, faceless, gorgonzola, all of that shit into the deck and try to hold off threats with all kinds of board clears. Plus pocket galaxy because why the fuck not
---
I feel like he's iconic for the wrong reasons lol. The character is basically a meme. Most of the most notable things about him is reasons not to like him. Nothing too seriously I mean, but he's not exactly the most revered of characters.
---
Bomb warrior is like 5 cards, it could work as a package, especially since you don't have to have the cards in your hand ar the same time.
---
Yeah but will we see much Jan'alai with Baku rotating out? I feel like without Baku and DK Jaina it will be much harder for Mage to survive to 8 Hero Power Damage.
---
Gotta love daddy
---
Bomb warrior viable?! Ironclad Juggernaut, I missed you.
---
Would it be too op if they had added "Beginning of the game, draw this."?
---
You wouldn‚Äôt have been able to run this in a Baku deck anyway
---
This is an auto-include in my TessWaggle rogue.
---
&gt;Terorist warior 
---
Is it ok for me to call it that way ? 
---
I believe iirc that they've said in the past that with dream cards from Ysera part of the fun of it is finding out what dream cards are when you play her. I would guess this follows similar reasoning.
---
This slots right into exodia mage allowing you to molten reflection for two sorcerers apprentices with one spell. It's like an alternate combo piece that will improve consistency 
---
And nerfing every classic card instead of getting rid of all of them from standard. I wanna hear their reasoning why they don't want to HoF every classic/basic card.
---
You can use the mage spirit to make it easier
---
That maybe but I'll lower my expectations. Excuse me for holding the development team of a highly valued gaming company for higher standards...
---
Gotta keep with the theme of each year having a raven card.
---
Something really disappointing about this card that people aren‚Äôt talking about is the bland name. It‚Äôs literally just his name with no fancy title. No ‚ÄúArchmage Khadgar,‚Äù no ‚ÄúKhadgar of the Kirin Tor,‚Äù and not even a title unique to Hearthstone that would fit this expansion. 
---
Also, according to the old prank concerning the relationship between hand size and face size, Khadgar has cancer. Probably colon cancer because he‚Äôs such a shit wizard. 
---
Khadgar is a pretty shit wizard 
---
I run a wild resurrect priest which includes 2x blood of the ancient one, emperor thaurissian and all my other big dudes. It also has zerek's cloning gallery. I have a 62% win rate (190-118) and peaked at rank 6. I don't play enough to make it to legend but I feel my deck could make it if I had the motivation to play more. 
---
I frequently get the ancient one to spawn, and even if it doesn't attack, the hard removal leaves my opponent vulnerable to my other big dudes. It also becomes a resurrection target. It's not the strongest deck but I have a lot of fun with it. 
---
I started a match after beginning this post. Here is my turn 6 zerek's play. I won this game. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/wRrHNdX
---
This will be a day 1 Kibler deck.  This is exactly the kind of shenanigans that makes rogue one of my fav classes.  Spirit into double lackey double treasure.  A Marin treasure you get straight away and can discover and prep and play!
---
So it's only credit cards?
---
Because that would exclude PayPal and Blizzard Balance cards don't get tracked.
---
And how does that work with Amazon coins? Because you're sending $50 to Amazon. Do they know what it's for?
---
Same goes for Playstore and Apple store. Can they track those transactions?
---
True enough
---
Don't spend money. Blizz will have to change things. As simple as that.
---
It‚Äôs okay buddy, I understood this reference
---
Why is he just called Khadgar with notTitle ? he is one of the most powerful Mages in WoW Lore. 
---
With just the Name and as a 2 Mana 2/2 he looks like a random pleb Mage.
---
I didn't watch it yet, so forgive me if I'm misunderstanding - Most of the time people complain that the player is trying too hard to win instead of just playing new cards to show them off. Are you complaining about them doing the opposite of that? Because I'd rather watch a reveal where they play a clumsy game but show off all the new stuff.
---
I don't get this. Are you saying my computer is to slow. Because if I make my moves as fast as someone who used to play starcraft at a master level does. The game will refuse input forever between my moves it feels like. Just clicking the end turn button usually requires at least 5 clicks until the game catches up.
---
If played at the right time this can sway a game after a board clear, and that's not even taking into account getting cards with good effects. 
---
They could have done something different. Obviously this is unplayable pack filler, so they could have just printed some other effect that's unplayable but at least works with the theme.
---
Deal 1 damage to a random enemy minion. Upgrades every turn. Boom, first with the theme and is still shit. 
---
Geez, lighten up a little
---
Odd control was running Zola pretty much entirely for Jan'alai, so if Jan is still worth running in a post rotation control mage then I think that Khadgar can make the cut. Admittedly, Zola is much more flexible, but there is something to be said for playing 2 rags on the same turn.
---
Yeah plus there are cards that increase hero power damage
---
where did you find the second 2?
---
Greatler was Kib.
---
Honestly they should have made this card khadgars floating head which is an actual thing in world of Warcraft. It would make sense that he would be able to channel his magic through the crystal ball and would make sense why the stats are so low 
---
the update goes live in like 2 weeks lol
---
This is the worst card in Hearthstone.
---
I believe in you buddy 
---
Kinda, so far. The legendary minion pool still got significantly altered compared to the League of Explorer's era, when Golden Monkey was more widely played and Khadgar will further contribute to that. I also should have specified what certain effects I alluded too, which was instant summoning effects like Zarog's Crown (that one trasure from Marin, who will rotate anyway). Summoning Khadgar with any effect that summons specifically legendary minions instead of the big boys will feel lackluster.
---
&gt; NO ONE is here to see the devs or listen to them talk.
---
He only wanted to see the new cards. Why watch the stream and not just wait to see them after if he doesn't want to listen to anyone talking?
---
Not arguing the stream wasn't rather shit, but it could have been the most insightful and interesting stream ever and he'd still not have wanted to listen, according to his own words.
---
I don't mind the bugs and the customary "technical difficulties", but if they plan to talk for 20 minutes about whatever uninteresting and not new thing, then warn us beforehand. I tunned in to see new cards, that's it. Then we have Cora roping every single turn for no reason at all while the game goes into fatigue with no new cards besides the ones we've seen on the first 2 turns.
---
I created a [Word Cloud](https://i.imgur.com/KMIWnnG.jpg) by analyzing comments in this thread. 
---
It's a fun way to see trends and patterns in the comment section that would otherwise be unclear or difficult to see. 
---
This is... really bad... the other versions of these upgrades generally looked pretty value after 2-3 turns... this is 4 armor after 3 turns for 4.... it doesn‚Äôt get value until around 8 turns... 5 armor is 2 mana on most warrior cards... 
---
I'm still wondering what they were thinking when they printed Glacial Mysteries.
---
Give toast an OTK deck without explaining what the combo is 
---
I thought it started when [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1j2BMPe7L0) was released?
---
It's a shame what blizzard and their games have become. They used to be titans and produced only quality stuff.
---
There‚Äôs literally hundreds of cards and decks that you could not say the same thing about, much less build an entire deck around. Saying purify was the worst card ever printed was just a circlejerk.
---
You mean you're worried that Blizzard has the ability to modify the game? The game that they run and control everything about?
---
YASSSS GIVE ME MORE PIRATES
---
I've never understood that. Why do bad cards need to exist? What sense does that make?
---
The thing about schemes is, most suck as a top deck but become better with time, eventually becoming extremely strong in a short amount of time. It takes 4 turns for hagatha to be great, it takes 4 for rafaam to be great, it takes like 2 or 3 for togwoggle to be great, and it takes like 5 for lazul to be great.
---
To make boom mana efficient, you need to wait twelve turns.
---
Twelve. Twelve whole turns just to match the power of branching paths. 5 to match the power of a 1 mana card. You'll also have to have it in your opening hand for you to gain upwards of 20+ armor, and even then you'll need tons of support on top of that.
---
This is such a waste of a deck slot, it's not even funny. It will not see play, solely because of how long it takes for it to break even.
---
Lackey rogue meta incoming 
---
Branching Paths was just OP, everyone agrees. Iron Hide was awful and didn't see play.  And this is far closer to Iron Hide.   I agree it isn't the worst card ever printed and Reddit is over reacting.  But that is a far cry from playable.  
---
I don't even know if armor synergy cards, which were too weak to see play, would like this card.  (Geoscultpor Yipp, Heavy Metal, or Gemstudded Golem).  At least with Shield Block you cycle.
---
Vex Crow has no problem filling a board, Vex Crow has problems living more than one turn
---
I feel like they should next time just make a 1 or 2-hour long pre-recording of the gameplay featuring all the new cards in advance and just accompany it during the reveal stream with their commentary. That way the viewers won't be as much annoyed by the stream's pace and it will be the streamers' duty to actually keep up with what is shown.
---
I mentioned Bride's name three times in front of the mirror last night and almost died.
---
Pretty much all of these complaints are in direct opposition to one of the primary reasons Hearthstone was ever extremely successful in the first place: casual simplicity. At a fundamental level, the interface and game mechanics are intentionally designed to keep the game moving at a quick, casual pace. Any one of the things you complain about here would likely slow the game down in one way or another, for one player or another.
---
I think having three people was a mistake. But I don't blame Cora, even with the slow turns; it's not like there was much to reveal anyway.
---
That's the laugh of a dev that has said to upper management that the last minute changes can't be done on time, he's forced to do it anyway and when it's pushed to prod it shits the bed as expected. 
---
Pretty sure every one working on Software has been through this at least once üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Is Shield worth 1 mana and 1 health?
---
It's not the fault of the devs, it's the fault of whoever configured the reveal stream settings and forgot to allow the generation of Lackeys and then didn't test those settings.  This was just lazy work.  The first deck was a Lackey deck, play testing of the reveal stream would have found the problem almost straight away.
---
This was only the case after Ben Brode tho.
---
What if the upgrade was +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7, maybe cap it after X turns
---
Ah, yes, Purify Warrior, my favorite deck.
---
Then maybe it should be summon x amount of boom bots.
---
This might be one of the worst cards ever printed lmao
---
Imagine you only play those classes. You wanna be hyped for this expansion, maybe pre-order. But now... you have nothing to go on. THere's hype for the unknown, and then there's just the dragging it out that kills it all.
---
Two weeks is still enough. There is absolutely no way they will launch an expansion where a major mechanic is broken. I promise that lackeys will not have the issues they did in today's stream. 
---
The bugs happen. The misplays happen. I can live with all that and they allow for a good laugh. 
---
What I couldn't live with was the endless chatting about nothing in particular. Hover over a new card, read it, say a comment or two and move on. Think about the game you're playing not about having a conversation. Conversations about new mechanics and possibilities should be left for between games. I come to these reveal streams to watch someone play new deck archetypes with new cards, not talk about how the unidentified card turned into betrayal + assassinate and rehash that conversation 4 different times. You'd think after the 2nd or 3rd time you couldn't complete your turn you'd try to focus a little more on the game.
---
That or maybe Blizzard could add some options to friendly challenges where we can control things like who goes first and turn timer. If we turn off the turn timer all the sudden none of this matters.
---
I feel like they have changed the card last minute because it was creating some problems and they said fuck it, lets not fix it, but remove it from the game by making it complete garbage
---
its even much worse then purify i think its the worst card ingae prolly the new scheme.
---
\*Put Mirror Image in their deck*
---
\*Hold onto Mirror image until like turn 10 or something*
---
\*Get Archmage Antonida*
---
"Let's just get rid of this Mirror Image"
---
Why would you upgrade a bad hero power (Even Shaman) when you could play a different class and upgrade a good hero power?
---
Oh that's right, because sometimes a weak mechanic gets some much-needed support and dominates the meta for a while.
---
FTR, I don't disagree with you at all. Scripted and practice would be good enough.
---
And, I don't disagree that finding someone AS engaging as Brode would be super hard. But just someone with SOME charisma. Like, literally his job title is "Hype Man" if you need to do it that way. Someone that loves hearthstone, has inside insights, and is great at hyping shit up and interacting with people. 
---
But again, scripted would be fine too. Normal people to their own devices is a bad idea 
---
Oh right, kinda forgot that jan'lai, khadgar and brann are on the board too lol
---
Jan'alai is going to be next to impossible to make work competitively now that its gas pedal is getting an emergency rotation. Mage is so stuffed full of bad 6-drops that Power of Creation is hobbled from the getgo. Astromancer + Khadgar is eh because it weakens each individual spawn and removes your ability to react on that turn.
---
The simple fact of the matter is it's a gimmick card with nothing to get to lategame to mess with it. Mark my words, its most impactful inclusion will be to Vex crow spawn tables.
---
Wondering he same thing. If so, I think this is pretty broken.
---
Idk didnt watch stream but everyone is talking about it like 1 armor per turn
---
yeah man there you go
---
Siphon soul has been good for ages though, so I can see it.
---
None of the cards you listed do the same thing, and half of your list have trigger that are fairly limiting in term of deck building.  Cards like Shield Block are "better", sure, but redundancy is rarely an issues in those scenario.  This is more of a late game cards that will more or less replace Bring it On.
---
Right now, Heavy Metal is the only cards left in standard that use "Armor" as a ressource, and its fairly bad. We probably won't get any this expansion, but if they do  in 4 or 8 months, I'm pretty sure this cards is going to to see play,  especially if we get a tutor for "scheme" this expansion.
---
Wait... wait... What about 9 armor!
---
Cards get revealed almost every day they even have a schedule for it and announced a stream on April 3rd
---
Is there even a need for a stream? Just reveal the cards. Do what WOTC does, have prominent members of the community reveal cards
---
BOMB WARRIOR IS HAPPENING HALLELUJAH 
---
Yeah, though what I'm expecting is for some insane combo to show up. If you can recruit or hand-summon Malygos for example, you'd get a spare.
---
If it makes you feel better I agree. If control warrior is a thing then new doom should see play.
---
I think the worst part of the stream wasnt even the bug but the speed at which they were playing. They were soooooooooo slow it was really annoying to watch the rope almost every turn. Also i remember day9 making an effort to just generaye the most crazy situation with draws and stupid plays. We're not watching to see hogh lvl plays. We're watching to see the new stuff
---
Am I the only one who already hates the deck? Good stated minions with almost inevitable win in fatigue...
---
I may have snapped the pick while the card started moving. High definition pic of card should be on HS website, well, soon?
---
This was Blizzard‚Äôs fault, not Cora‚Äôs. It‚Äôs Blizzard‚Äôs show. Cora just tried to make the best of a bad situation. No way this was one person‚Äôs fault. Honestly, shame on you.
---
I want this card as a background of /r/hearthstonecirclejerk because, well, it is a joke.
---
Baku is rotating out anyway, and I doubt this would make the cut in Wild even as a 3-drop.
---
I'm pretty damn upset about how I saw this coming from a mile away. All team 5 and the higher-ups did was give us Tavern brawl and just keep on adding sets. Then the revenue started to go down and now they give a shit
---
Wow, finally more than one nerf per card set? Too little too late, we *still* don't have replays, any new mode, a shit given about wild, no buffs, and you were always too stubborn to make any big changes. The fact that cards can only get rotated at one specific day in April every year is ridiculous, if a card is a big problem just rotate it. Or I don't know be like every other card games with rotations and pair each release of a set with the oldest set being rotated
---
Their figures are finally telling them to make the big changes the community has always been asking for. The rotation this year is interesting, and I'll play the next set. But I am absolutely not buying anything until I see serious changes.
---
This is what irked me the most, honestly. I can forgive the cringe, and the wet blanket personalities hosting it. It's the fucking bugs which were so horribly embarassing... I was so angry that bugs this horrendously game breaking made it into a REVEAL STREAM. Like seriously wtf. Do these guys not have playtesters? Shaking my fucking head Blizzard. Worst reveal to date. 
---
This is bafflingly bad.
---
aggro mech hunter says hi with turn 4 wins (wild of course)
---
Peter Whalen did fine in this stream and previously, it was just the other dude that didn't need to be there. 
---
She was pretty bad, but it's understandable. She doesn't have as much experience as streamers like Keibler or Day9, and she doesn't have multiple reveal streams under her belt like Frodan. 
---
Ignoring that she did terrible is a disservice because it wasn't her fault. It was a bad choice for this specific stream, it's on Blizzard, not her. 
---
Is it confirmed to only upgrade by 1 armor each turn? Because if it goes up by 3 or more per turn it could be good.
---
I didn't even realize the reveal stream was going on. No view from me I guess.
---
Purify is mathematically a viable card?  The silence effect is worse than a 0 mana Silence (targets only your minions vs all) and the card draw is available cheaper/easier other plays (Power Word: Shield is 1 mana for draw and a health bonus, neutral minions have draw card effects on a body at 2 mana).  Mathematically Purify is god awful.
---
The only redeeming value of it was adding consistency to what is otherwise a combo deck (collect toughness pump/inner fire, then burst), doubling the available 'viable' options for silence utility.
---
Dragons on the other hand had support before Drak OP, in BRM.  Instead of being a combo piece, dragons play on general synergy which makes for a much simpler deck construction (see: murloc).  What Drak OP and Duskbringer did do is shift that synergy from early game tempo to midrange/control and value.
---
But to address your point, the early cards for dragon priest; Twilight Whelp, Wyrmrest Technician, and neutral enablers like Twilight Guardian forcibly created the Dragon Priest archetype. 
---
Purify was using up a design slot in a small release to make the air freshener before the car was finished.
---
So many things went wrong this stream, I don't know if it was just her.  It probably just put more pressure on having a good cast to carry the stream and they didn't.
---
Double Shir'vallah or something is pretty good stats.
---
Makes me think of really nice art for a random generic DnD character
---
I remember how fun Tirion and Antonidas were to play, with their lore and epic themes. Old Gods and Death Knights were also great; I assumed we would get expansions for other WoW cycles, but all we have gotten since then is quirky, uninteresting expansions.
---
I once thought we would get new classes, new modes; I dreamt of playing plague-themed decks, burning-Legion themed decks, Alliance vs Horde... Instead, it's been years of appalling OC that doesn't deliver on the fantasy. 
---
People have also complained every expansion that they don't bring back old keywords and mechanics. There's no pleasing some people.
---
Anyone who thinks this entire expansion will be stale because of a small fraction of cards that play up a theme of looking back is just reaching for reasons to complain.
---
What an amazing comeback
---
It indicates the comment is sarcastic 
---
I'm so sick of Hearthstone making shit cards. Like what is this supposed to do? I'm gonna summon a bunch of random minions in my MAGE deck? Why? I'm just about done with this game.
---
sweet... i had a wild pirate based burgle deck... this will go right in!
---
Worst case scenario, in 1/4 instances, this card is a slightly worse Walk The Plank. The only thing that makes it worse in that instance is that you need 6 mana to play it, then you get two Coins back which makes it functionally 4 mana but you need the 6 mana in the first place. Also doesn't have to be an undamaged minion so there's that as a plus for this card. If you hit Betrayal or Seance with it, it's pure value town baby. I feel like I'm going to want this over walk the plank most of the time. 
---
12 turns to match the power of cards that are rotating out? From the overtuned Year of the Mammoth? And how often does control warrior take games super long anyway? Im not saying its a great card but i do think it will be playable
---
Yeah the $5 welcome bundle definitely helps, but 12 rare wildcards is still a drop in the bucket if you want a competitive deck that's not mono-red or mono-blue.
---
White weenies needs 20 rare cards, Sultai midrange needs 29, Azorius aggro needs 27, Esper control needs 41(!). Basically you need to either whale for 100+ packs or slowly grind for months to get a single competitive deck.
---
Which is why if you queue into CE or constructed, you'll face mono-red or mono-blue most of the time. Because those are the only decks most people can afford to build. Sucky situation for both the f2p and whales since the meta gets kinda stale quickly.
---
its aslo great with kalegos.
---
u/BBrode I miss you
---
I don't see how this is any more reliable or "unstoppable" than any previous OTK Antonidas deck like quest or Simulacrum/Leyline Manipulator.
---
Those decks can use their survival tools entirely to stay alive while they build up a hand that kills you in 1 turn and protects all requisite combo pieces in the hand leaving the only possible disruption to a handful of cards and mill.
---
This combo takes 3 times as many turns, requires more cards in the hand at once, leaves Antonidas vulnerable to silence or bait spell + clear, requires a whopping 7-9 cards in the hand at once and still suffers from all of the weaknesses of the other OTK decks.
---
Mark Rosewater (head designer of Magic the Gathering) has talked extensively about this, and while the original article is extremely old (2002!? I am turning to dust as I speak), I feel it's timeless and valid even to this day. It's also, if I recall, his first ever most famous and widespread article.
---

And it looks bad compared to every one
---
I'm not saying he isn't strong, just that his presentation leads a lot to be desired. It's pretty hard to make a character standout because of power when the world runs on rule of cool. I cannot be surprised because I have no baseline expectation for what is the standard. 
---
Like the time they tried to get us to like Garrosh in WoD so they buddied us up with him a lot, except every time he always fucked up, committed a crime against humanity, and/or acted like a manchild.
---
Is it possible at all that this card goes up by more than 1 armor per turn?
---
They should have cool footage prepared so we can see the card, see it in action and then discuss it with a streamer. The format they have gets stale quick, and often doesn't even show the card in action or when it's set up to be powerful. HS has tons of RNG so playing one game with a deck will have tons of variance.    
---
* Discuss expansion with streamer    
---
* Reveal Card and reactions    
---
* Show epic footage of card in action    
---
* Further Discussion    
---
* Reveal next card
---
I think if that were the case they would specify "copies".
---
It is? It's right next to it.
---
Tempo warrior will be back!
---
Discover picks from random results.  Heistbaron Togwaggle always gives you the same choices.
---
How about with two Khadgars? 
---
Exactly, with baku gone more deck building options exist!
---
Mage will still have the spirit that makes hero power target adjacent minions and the other minions that buff hero power. I think it has enough existing support that it will still see play.
---
I'm new, and will take note on this. Thanks!
---
Paladin, with pyro/consecrate + equalityshrink ray
---
Mage with Frost Nova/ Blizzard + Doomsayer
---
Rogue with Vanish
---
Shaman needs an insane scheme
---
Hunter with Venomizer+Missile Launcher
---
Warlock with Twisting Nether
---
This.  The whole "burgle" premise is that you're stealing cards belonging to your opponent's deck, or at least class.  "Discover a non-rogue spell" is just pushing the archetype to casino rogue.
---
One IS clearly better you buffoon
---
No, it went up by 1 in the stream.
---
He (she?) passed the Pirate fashion exam.
---
If they released good preorder packs like witchwood, I would buy them. Haven't preorder ever since out of principle
---
You‚Äôre right, this is the one worst card we‚Äôve seen in a while ^^^^^^/s
---
...that's why I don't blame Cora.
---
You said 
---
&gt;this is still one of if not worst card ever.
---
I would put that under the "cannot possibly see play" column
---
Real question - why do people watch them? All the cards get posted to r/hearthstone immediately anyways...
---
They still have it in the Adventure. They probably disabled it in the brawl for balance reasons.
---
Okay, please clear me up, what's not good about all 9 quests being meta relevant, assuming they're not overpowered or annoying to play against? 
---
It's Choose because it's always the same choices.  Discover gives you random choices.
---
There are a ton of other indicators showing that hearthstone is dropping in revenue and players at a rapid pace - google trends, contributions to deck trackers like HS Replay and VS, this report, twitch viewership, etc. 
---
The fact is hearthstone is in decline.
---
What about adding Bran?
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up, friend. 
---
All it takes is one more card to make this card good. 
---
I‚Äôm not really sure what the point of trying to rate cards with any type of certainty before the full release is, but jumping the gun is just foolish.
---
It will suck if they don‚Äôt release a single piece of additional synergy, but this is a Scheme card and it‚Äôs very unlikely to be as bad as people think.
---
Maybe by "Add a bomb that deals 1 damage each turn, upgrade each turn (upgrading the damage)" would fix it a bit.
---
I seriously don't believe they could have done a worse job.
---
Lots of bugs check
---
Endless drivel check
---
New cards, you know, the whole purpose of the stream? Big fat no check
---
Why do you care about about t games that are  out the door? Why play something that's over and done with, you have to get over it. Everything ends and hearthstone, may not be "ending," period, end of discussion, but if you've been playing since launch you can easily see they just want to print weak cards. Hearthstone was never about tame, but you put it the best Dr.Boom in this set is just Dr. Boom with a condition, that's their philopshy- make it more tame, make it cost more, make it have less stats. 
---
Move on to another game man it's time. You think you cant but you're probably like me and have an obsessive personality if you love hearthstone so much still, I guarantee you you'll obsess over another game. 
---
Would this include cards that summon copies, like molten reflection? If so this would improve exodia mage 
---
OI MI NOI MI NOI

So is someone gonna make a ninja turtle deck?

---
You know how much work that would take?
---
Aren't the spell stones rotating? 
---
Isn't it better for the game to have weak cards that have very niche utility rather than card's that have no utility in any circumstance? I get the idea of printing Bad cards in order to reduce the power level of random effects, but it seems absurd to put out cards that aren't intended to ever see play. 
---
/r/unexpectedgroucho
---
It's obviously not a great way, but it's supposed to be approximate. A 5 Mana should be stronger than a 2 Mana, but khadgar is stronger than most 5 Mana minions. There are always exceptions of course, but this is the biggest misrepresentation of power I've seen in hearthstone.
---
As jaraxxus you can even destroy yourself and replace yourself with yourself. 
---
if my opponent does this combo I would not mind it. 
---
Seems alright.  If you build a deck around it he might be the same power level as a neutral boom, maybe better.
---
The fact that you have to run this is an archetype probably works against it, but it will be funny to play it with 6-24 points of damage summoning and with 5-30 damage of traps in your opponents deck
---
Strength and mana cost don‚Äôt either.
---
Chakki was great 
---
Out jerked again
---
I read this like a Magic card and my eyes almost popped out of my sockets before I realised minions aren't spells in HS. Yeesh.
---
8 Mana 10/24 or 20/48 lool
---
Callback things are cool. Probably. 
---
Smashing!
---
Just imagine playing this on 3 with the lackey you get and they all seem pretty good
---
1/1 + 2/1 with rush
---
1/1 + random 3 drop
---
Two 1/1s and a random 2 drop/deal 2 damage/discover
---
Art is off on this card. I would see some play if it was gain 2 armor per turn or starts with 6 armor
---
that's because you're playing the equivalent of pirate warrior except its worse because the life total is only 20. a game's cost is averaged between combo, control, and aggro if it were just aggro hell you can play just zoo over and over and over and over for like 2000 dust
---
a 2 mana 2/2 that makes two 6 cost minions is pretty talented
---
Arguably great. 
---
Hearthstone was released 5 years and 14 days ago.  Of course people will eventually abandon the game, it's simply inevitable.  I've been playing since closed beta and I'm still enjoying the game to a certain extent.  
---
They also had a massive bug which disrupted the flow of every match.
---
The reason it was such a huge deal is because the entire Priest class was unplayable at the time. Then they gave Priest a horrible card with no support.
---
Purify is a bad card, but to call it the worst card in the game is insane.
---
 It seems like all they care about is money. Game is becoming more and more boring and stale. Card designs are getting worse.
---
As I said. this is what happening to this game. for example new solo adventure COST 20$. besides the packs and rewards now they are charging us for the (previously free) Solo adventures. Isn't this enough?
---
Maybe it will be played in mirror matches. You already win in fatigue with warrior against any other class 
---
Boom's Scheme is just a badly designed card, even if it does somehow end up being good. It shouldn't be prinited in it's current state. I thought the team really cared about "theme and flavor" above all else but this is clearly an exception. It's pretty disappointing.
---
If the golden version has the belly bounce, I'm going to use my entire college fund to buy packs.
---
Murloc Mage big oof
---
Does this work with Seaforium Bomber?
---
that's not a good sign.. is it?
---
there were more people quitting this year...
---
&gt; It's obviously not a great way, but it's supposed to be approximate.
---
Hard disagree there.
---
Otherwise Old Gods would have to be like 25 Mana flat.
---
Titans would have to be 1,000 Mana flat when they're introduced.
---
And the Giants would not be equivalent to *freakin' Dragon Aspects.*
---
&gt; There are always exceptions of course, but this is the biggest misrepresentation of power I've seen in in a card in hearthstone.
---
Nope. Old Gods are much more wildly misrepresented than this.
---
"It's supposed to be approximate" is extremely baseless on your part. Have a character with a seriously powerful effect of high Mana Cost -- like Varian Wrynn or Alexstrasza.
---
But if you're going to have a powerful effect that *doesn't* have to be gated by a high Mana Cost, such as Khadgar's? It is actually stronger to have him be low Mana Cost -- and thus more accessible for combos -- than for him to be high Mana Cost, and for his effect to be more difficult to take advantage of.
---
Hence why Arugal and Khadgar are both more powerful than if they were, say, 4 Mana 4/4s or 6 Mana 6/6s.
---
When To My Side was revealed I was still expecting them to unveil the Reno of the mechanic, a powerhouse to make the condition make sense, so I didn't get caught up in the circlejerk. I was optimistic. This card... this card I have a hard time being optimistic about. I have a hard time thinking of any mechanic that could make this card work that isn't overly contrived and doesn't make the other armor gain cards overpowered. Spell-only Hunter may have sounded weak at the time but the potential was there. I just can't see any potential here.
---
And it prompted a mass exodus when ported to Gwent :D
---
Asking the question I came here to pose. I'm out of the loop on where the card reveals are coming from, so I wondered if the card was revealed on a British stream or something.
---
I think this is the worst card that will ever be printed, I really can‚Äôt think of anything that was worse 
---
They didn't even use inhouse developers for that iirc. It's made by NetEase with Blizzard art assets.
---
I think this card may still see play because Warrior will only have Shield Block and this card as unconditional armor gain (I guess Weapons Project also kinda counts). If a Maly deck gets popular, they can add one of these as a tech card. Like the 5 mana BGH, it doesn't matter if you are terrible if there isn't a better option.
---
rip in peace
---
Two 1/1s and a random 2 drop/deal 2 damage/discover a spell
---
inb4 a huge reveal video of Heroes/Champions for the remaining 4 classes with no villains.
---
[removed]
---
This bad to summon boom boys originally. No way is this the original idea. 
---
Their legendary cards are consistently amazing, and most can be auto included in any pally deck. I don't think any other class is like that, correct me if I'm wrong. I've never enjoyed facing paladins tbh.
---
The best defence is a good offence. 
---
His point was that they force him to be like brode and the paper thin intentionality of it is another point towards hearthstone being a paint by the numbers metric machine that would rather capture some sort of statuts quo than be innovative, which is what got them success in the first place. And I for one agree with him, now what matters if I think that and others don't, nothing, but then why discuss video games ever, because at the end of the day the whole topic of video games is benign. 
---
It's supposed to be an anniversary set that has callback cards
---
Don‚Äòt you guys have Lackeys?
---
I'm just grateful that just MAYBE, for once in the history of Hearthstone, Druid and Paladin won't dominate ladder.  Seeing the same 10 cards get overplayed for years begins to wear thin.  It's not personal, it's just one of the most overplayed classes in the game, because they consistently get fed the best cards (applies to both aforementioned classes).
---
DR IS BACK BOYS
---
Finally, mage has a way to win games after sticking Antonidas on the board for a turn. This is sure to be broken.
---
They got real lazy.
---
everyone knows swoledan beats nerdghar in a fite
---
They are completely disconnected from their audience
---
The preferred term is fecalmancer. üí©üßô
---
"Kaiba! I activate Greed of the Pot, card it me allows decking 2 cards my from deck"  
---
"Yugi, you... you might be having a stroke man, should I call in my Blue-Eyes shaped Ambulance ?"
---
And what more proof do you need beyond no patches or any communication for months when the current population of goes down 99.5%?
---
I'm not trying to argue that 'Blizzard cares'.  I think believing that any company 'cares' about you is laughably juvenile.  Blizzard, Valve, any for profit company (and quite a few of the non-profit ones) do not.  Valve supports Dota2 like they do because it's profitable.  No other reason.
---
As long as you can consistently have 3 bombs in your enemy's deck this thing will fill your board no matter what. Add on the Dr. Boom hero card and all those boom bots have rush giving this card a solid body and a decent amount of removal/burn. 
---
While in wild Dr. Boom hasn't been used because of the insane amount of synergy... Well this isn't wild and the power level is significantly lowering meaning the bombs, the Dr. Boom hero, and this card all help each other significantly in an interesting control/burn deck. 
---
The shudderwock player also had shudderwock. And you wouldn't play cards that would dig you into fatigue. And sometimes you'd play banker. Remember that shudderwock is an infinite pile of board clears, healing, tech... It's not even a control matchup at that point, shudderwock is a one card combo.
---
Jeeze, what do you think you're talking about.
---
At least it‚Äôs common and not Epic.
---
Ok?  To me it seems like you're just trying to make something out of nothing. If you're not enjoying the game anymore, then just move on.  Just because a game is losing people doesn't mean it's a "daed gaem".  I went through that with StarCraft, and this is nothing like that.
---
They did, they said [[Drakkari Enchanter]] makes scheme cards upgrade twice as fast :P (Kappa)
---
This was supposed to have been a response to the OP, I didn‚Äôt mean to attach it to yours. Shame on me!
---
My guess is that after Dr. Boom blows up the reinforced metal door he looks at the metal shrapnel left behind and thinks to himself, "I can make myself a new suit from this stuff!". 
---
The longer you wait, the more powerful the explosion is, which causes more metal bits to fly loose from the barrier and then be used as armor.  
---
Is it actually his rat? If so that‚Äôs awesome
---
You could throw it in renomage pretty easily since it runs all these cards anyways.
---
#HEY EVERYONE
---
&gt; It's a reveal stream not a "analyze every old card like its a tournament" stream.

Damn, spot on. Casters don't really fit to do this.
