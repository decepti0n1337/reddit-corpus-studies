Gladiator's isn't good enough to slot in a deck but 10 immune damage is far from a dud.
---
WHAT WHY DOES HUNTER NEED THIS MUCH VALUE??
---
This is really strong, but I don't think it's broken.  You need to have a lackey on board and your stats are split.  In early game its easier to deal with 2 decent minions than 1 huge minion a la Mountain Giant.    
---
The nastiest I see is a T2 cable rat. T3 lackey, coin, this guy.  Thats 3/3 &amp; 5/5 on T3.  It could be busted, but its a 3 card combo minimum, so it might not be tier 1 (lackey generator, lackey, this card).    
---
Who knows?  In 2 months I might be raging at my phone when this drops on me.  xD
---
What video ?
---
Inner rage has seen plenty of top level play in the past.
---
When memes dont make sense, its not funny
---
Yes because you are the only one that could have thought of this , using an enraged warrior legendary minion with charge with a new warrior card that synergies with damaged minions 
---
Upboated and gilded
---
Then that'd be on the player ultimately~
---
And draw each of the combo pieces before you myra's, to be safe.
---
Emptying your hand isn't so hard, though. Run tunnel blaster and some other deathrattles
---
Holy shit
---
It's simple.
---
IP matching would be the main thing and even with a separate IP it would be pretty obvious what you are doing from a log point of view unless you are using multiple different IPs.
---
Honestly you wouldn‚Äôt run other deathrattles so you can hit mechathun with it
---
They won‚Äôt have long
---
&gt;Not trying to spread any kind of warriorhate or something,  
---
You should.  They are fucking cancer.  
---
Trust me you don't want to reach legend.  It's full of more Warriors and queue times are really quite long compared to the numbered ranks.  
---
I wish I could un-legend myself back to 5 this season, so bored at legend.
---
I sympathize that you are a f2p player but there are some decks which beat warrior pretty well.  
---
I would suggest trying mech hunter and they snowball fast with tokens as well.  Late game is where control decks should shine but the mech hunter deck does not let the warrior reach late game and kills them before it.  
---
Conjurer's mage also wins against warrior if you can get the early tempo turns and draws.  
---
It requires skill but you should be fine as you reached rank 1 as ftp, however this deck is pretty dust heavy as well.  
---
Do give mech hunter a try if you wanna beat warriors, let me know how that goes!  
---
Good Luck, bud.
---
Maybe you don't know what objectively better means bc your so biased thinking every game is a control mirror. You realize other deck arechtypes exist right? 
---
If zilliax has a 55% win rate and thoughsteal has a 53% win rate then zilliax is OBJECTIVELY better. 
---
Talk about critical thinking when you've done it.
---
Honestly it might would just be best as one-of in a tempoish murloc deck. 
---
That is, if we can build a tempoish/mid-range murloc deck. 
---
Would've been sick in the ungoro era murloc pally.
---
agree, Dragon is especially important.
---
*I am Murloc pay on the distance*
---
Even then it's arguable, since it's about tempo vs value. Sure you went to fatigue, but you might not have had you gotten a random card instead.
---
Used to happen to me 5 or 6 times a game. Since this last update its happened maybe once.

This isn't true. As a murloc deck you are very likely to curve out near perfectly turns 1-5. If you are facing a control deck they won't run as many early game minions. The murloc you get won't help your early turns, but giving your opponent a play where they otherwise are floating mana can be terrible. Also, giving conjurer's mage an extra +1 hand size can speed up mountain giant conjuring by a whole turn.
---
Nice job!
---
This actually boosts the card's value up to me. There are often times where I WANT my own minion to be destroyed. I don't like paying health in order to do this. I don't really like this card at all because of the price of using my own health pool. But being able to destroy ANY minion....including my own, is good in some situations.
---
Dude wtf ? I play 95% wild, I guess i'm irrelevant ... :'(
---
Does anyone see any good improvements for my [cheapo spell mage](https://www.hearthpwn.com/deckbuilder/mage#4:2;30:2;44:1;49:2;177:2;274:2;489:2;589:1;595:2;89365:1;89471:1;89861:1;90140:1;90232:1;90568:1;90579:2;90607:2;90608:1;90637:2;90685:1;) deck?
---
I'm not really interested in running Giants or Conjurer's.
---
Hell yes, Murloc mage is lacking in card generation!
---
It just feels wrong to group inner rage with rampage, when the latter was only been part of a single competitive archetype in its existence, and inner fire has come into plenty of decks as expansions have rotated in and out. Inner rage is far closer in viability to PO than it is to rampage.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer! I'll give this a try and let you know how it goes.
---
We only have one piece of footage on it and I think it's safe to assume that word of mouth spread a bit until the footage was released. There's nothing saying that it wasn't exploited, so I choose to assume that (much like judgement stacks in Cata) people will exploit something as much as possible until it's fixed.
---
So cool
---
Ohhhh that would be nice.  What makes you think it will be though?
---
Okay this I like.
---
This is cool, never realized it was on a little mushroom house before! Good work.
---
Blizzard immediately realized since it was used for the World First kill and it was patched famously very quickly before anyone else could bug it. 
---
Did people get like 2-5 reck bomb stacks? Maybe. But no one else stacked it for like 7-8 hours to kill a world boss. He was the only one and there wasn‚Äôt another one after.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôll be 8 or so months once this set launches.
---
Priest quest : Play no minion and heal your face for 5 turns.
---
Reward : you can emote even if your opponent squelched you.
---
WOW
---
Followed advice, hand stuck in toaster. What now.
---
Gain 7/7 worth of stats. You gain 8/8 but you lose 1/1. So in the end you gain 7/7 stats for 3 mana.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Yeah I agree, it's strong.
---
Oh dear lord that's way less intimidating than a regular Krush... And it's earlier and had a 2/4 on the side...
---
Didn't blizz say they swapped to supporting failed archetypes in their second year? Secret pally was pushed last year and reinforced this year. Same thing for dragon. Mech pally got a buff with the buffs. Heal pally has yet to get a second pass and I don't think it will.
---
Yup. I play it in my tempo bomb warrior. It‚Äôs better against bomb hunter and lackey decks but decent against control as a mid range deck unless you draw bricks. It‚Äôs pretty consistent. 
---
Fast enough to run battle rage and inner rage synergies but slow enough to wait for bomb draws. It‚Äôs weird. Also runs grom as a finisher so this card is amazing.
---
Also, Anakin hates it too
---
It's a decent option, and I've tried it in the past, but it's been mediocre so far. That said, a package of 2x Anyfin, 1x Dinosize, 1x Scales might be just what the deck needs.
---
You aren't forced to attack with your minions every turn in hearthstone. But attacking is fun, and thankfully it is almost always correct as well.
---
Wow that actually looks very fun to play!
---
This was my first thought Agro pally that can go the distance. Seems to be a common theme as of late with Warlock, Shaman, and Hunter all having ways to win late game now.
---
I don't.
---
They design two expansions ahead so when they designed this one they knew dragons were already getting a pass and didn't know whether it'd be strong enough.
---
Radagast was definitely the druid. Gandalf I‚Äôd actually say was more of a priest.
---
I enjoy it quite a bit. It‚Äôs something more to play for fun than for a challenge unlike some of the previous adventures I thought. Definitely worth the purchase. üôÇ
---
I kept counting 30 and forgot the spell triggers deathrattle TWICEA lol
---
This was a horrible experience
---
I'm assuming that it works like [[Star Aligner]]. With AK47 Druid, the battlecry still works if you have 4 7-health minions on board. The wording is the same, so it probably works the same.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
[[Blood of the Ancient One]] also uses the same wording. From the wiki:
---
&gt; If the player has more than two, one The Ancient One will be summoned for each two Bloods - spare Bloods will not be affected. With multiple pairs of Bloods, multiple The Ancient Ones can be summoned.
---
There is definitely some wording inconsistency with this type of card. Here are some examples that reference having "at least" a certain number of minions:
---
[[Ravasaur Runt]], [[Nesting Roc]], [[Second-Rate Bruiser]], [[Mimiron's Head]], [[Sacred Trial]]
---
What about anka herself? She counts as a minion and mechathun wont trigger

Hey everyone, wouldn't all of you be perfectly fine if this archetype that I have never played in a game with already limited archetypes in the meta that is good against my favorite naetdeck be removed? Plz daddy give me moar.
---
OP didn't say it did. Arrows all lead to Murmy for a reason lol. Not interconnected. If you haven't noticed, making mummies doesnt synergise with any of that except for murmy
---
I'm pretty sure murlocs were made for beginner players. So they can grasp a simple concept and gain context for how the game is played.
---
I remember in the last interview with a game developer ominstone had they said they like having a variety of cards and also simple cards so beginners could quickly grasp the game.

Fuck I thought this was r/customhearthstone
---
That shit is strong.
---
I think the first set of a new rotation kind of has to have low power cards since they're in the standard rotation the longest. The really good Ungoro cards didn't stop seeing play for almost the full two years \[\[Tar Creeper\]\], Jade Druid cards. With Witchwood the general pool was underpowered but the Odd/Even mechanics warped their design space so much they had to rotate them out a year early or we'd still be dealing with them. The cards should get more powerful as the Year moves forward so we get fun cards to play with eventually but they're not shaping the meta for too long... And in theory, they can limit how good this card is by keeping the really good Mage secrets till later.
---
Because Tog couldn't look away from shiny things.
---
I know Reno has his own use cases, but man... maybe they should have swapped rarities
---
It's basically Fireball with a 4/4 body that also has elemental synergy, just an excellent card all around, especially if you discount it down to 2 mana

3/1/5 Elemental | Taunt Has +2 Attack during your opponent's turn.

You also have these in wild you have everything
---
You posted this 4 minutes before the hour. Check your clock settings and get it synced with a time server.
---
You are more likely to be matched against the same person twice. I've had 5 in a row with the same person on a quiet day.
---
Yeah didn't mean to call this card bad at all, its a good card and probably nuts on wild with ice block, but i don't think this card is omega devastator good.
---
Props for leaving your comment up hilarious fuck-up lol
---
They realised that rise of shadows was weak in comparison to last year‚Äôs Un Goro and stepped it up
---
Seems bad
---
This really, REALLY helps with early board flood in wild, which is the decks absolute biggest weakness.
---
We will have to see how many cards you can actually cut for the new stuff, since the list is pretty tight.
---
I'm excited, I love Aluneth Mage. :)
---
Will this be run in even shaman?
---
Hopefully they print more support for secret mage in standard, aside from literally 2 cards and no secret so far
---
Add in Hooktusk and pirates for the early game. The pirate with Overkill draw 2 cards is good when it has rush.
---
No one‚Äôs gonna put a slow 3 mana value do nothing card in Master‚Äôs Call Hunter which is already extremely refined and efficient. No one‚Äôs gonna waste a slot in Bomb/Control Warrior with a fucking handbuff card. The Rogue Legendary could definitely be strong at some point. But frankly Rise of Shadows seems much more powerful than this expansion to me. There‚Äôs definitely nothing yet on the insane level of stuff like Evil Miscreant, Conjurer‚Äôs Calling, Omega Devastator, Underbelly Angler etc etc I could go on and on.
---
Even Shaman just got buffed
---
&gt; Secret Mage? Join the ranks of Murloc Paladin, 1 HP Paladin, Taunt Warrior, and more!
---
Secret Mage is way better off than those other archetypes though since there are actually Mage secrets in Standard from other sets.
---
Hmmm seems interesting with more totem support. In wild though ;-;.
---
I mean, if you already had a secret up, which isn‚Äôt that hard to do, it‚Äôs only 1 more mana for a fireball AND a 4/4.
---
1. Tempo mage isn't very good right now.
---
2. Secret mage in standard just doesn't seem to have enough support. How many good secrets does mage have? 3? 4ish? Is that really enough to make this card worth it? The secret would have to stick hopefully for 1-2 turns to play this on turn 5. It's not as op as it looks

Nightmare almagam on 3 into this on turn 4 is already decent but probably not consistent enough with the current totem pool. Maybe it's time for the legendary totem this expansion
---

---
Hoooowoooooooooo !

But Mark of the wild is a druid.

---

---
Where did you find this?
---
Possessed Lackey needs a nerf in wild then.
---
Turn 3 this plus possessed lackey + Counterspell is too big of a tempo swing.
---
Shudderwock will repeat this 
---
Maybe with the 3 /  4 totem ?
---
That's a pretty early guess. A lot of sets have seen cards of this power level before. We've only seen around 40 cards so far, there's bound to be less powerful/pack filler cards.
---
This really should be 3 mana.
---
5 mana for a vanilla statted 2 drop that can keep wrecking, a blizzard, and a secret is insane.

---
Holy shit, rip wild
---
IMO don't dust your wild cards, you'll regret limiting yourself in a long run.
---
This really is the wild expansion
---
Well this is disappointing, what a boring card?!
---
Serpent Ward has never looked more awesome.
---
Well I could delete it, but making mistakes is not something to be ashamed of.
---
Control mage is gonna be meta 100%
---
One of the best reveal Videos I've ever seen; watching this one was really worth it.
---
awesome reveal video!
---
You play lotheb. 
---
Their spells cost 5 more, so they can only really play minions. 
---
If they flood the board or taunt up, you can play Arcane Flakmage + spells to AOE their side down.
---
Not too sure about that. You do really only care about copying a Totem Golem, but that seems really inconsistent.
---
So in your scenario where the league teams up, the guys they‚Äôre facing DONT team up?
---
Can someone fill me in on the joke?
---
My bad, I meant 2 years ago
---
The new Quest Hero Power + Mana Tide Totem + Splitting Axe = DIY Aluneth. 
---
Serpent ward - DIY Rag that always goes face.
---
Pretty sure resurrection literally is necromancy.
---
I mean, yeah. Even with your cherry picking the more powerful cards of the set, the general consensus on Hunter's Pack was that the randomness might keep it from seeing play. 
---
Also the Warlock one is technically only a 3 mana 7/7.
---
What‚Äôs the cross with LEGO? And of course it‚Äôs an Asian guy. Their music sounds so damn stupid :D
---
This reminds me of a beefed up Medivh's valet.
---
I had to triple-check whether I am missing **"to a minion"** somewhere on the card. Now an iceblock played for free by a mad scientist will basically give fireball value to a minion :/ oh god
---
Please stop with the secrets and gave us more support for reno/ control mage. Control decks are already the worst archetype in wild.
---
Seems okay tome. It‚Äôs like a mix of League of Explorers (and the tomb raiding motif) and Mean Streets of Gadgetzan (the cartoony look).
---
That you don't like it, doesn't make it trolling. It is merely observation.
---
I love this game.
---
Turn 5 is too late for a board clear?
---
Wow, i must be a really bad aggro player.
---
Sometimes I like to play a game where I cover up the health and attack of a new card and guess what it will be. For this card I came up with a 1/2 or 2/1.
---
This card is going to be ridiculous.
---
This with spitting image will lead to concede against so many paladins
---
In wild, for sure. This card actually triggered me, because that deck has a secret active...basically all the time, and getting yet another card that can do relevant face damage...ouch.
---
from my experience secret mage crushes quest/otk mage
---
&gt;children‚Äôs 
---
&gt;highly competitive ranked and wild play 
---
No
---
Wait wtf I thought I was on /r/customhearthstone and was going to complain how OP it was. 
---
Blizzard is ridiculous with the power level of new cards.
---
Actually better than the new Reno...
---
You can play it on 3 with a secret and that 1 mana card which makes your next secret free. That's pretty good!
---
Possibility either :  
---
1) Lot of fake account to get better trade (like one fake account open a valuable legendary and trade it for some crap to main account)  
---
2) Lot less player because game become to damn expensive
---
It will see play
---
Just wait for secret to hit menopause, then they'll stop.
---
I dont know why you put "streamer" when it's going to be Thijs
---
Honestly, I think Dragon decks just need a beefy taunt in the middle of the curve. Similar to how Twillight Guardian functioned in the past.
---
Maybe with pre-nerf Flametongue... but not now.
---
We have seen 43/135 cards and for now, it's the same mix than previous sets. Every cards don't show the set theme. Rise of Shadows don't feature 135 spells and minions in Dalaran.
---
I want the to make the new Obelisk card a totem. It deserves to be one
---
That looks insanely strong.
---
But I welcome anything that tries to push mage in a different direction (meaning, anything but giants+conjurer).
---
Initial Design Team: We originally had the infinite value snowball 2-drop as a 2/3, but toned it down to a 1/2 because, y‚Äôknow, this isn‚Äôt Shaman, they can‚Äôt have ALL of the card generation.
---
Now I want a Warcraft LEGO movie.
---
Shudderyoggreno shaman with a frog and a devolve and luck

---
Believe the beast you draw would be from the hunter class limiting what you can draw.
---
slixe#2448
---
Towers are not totems.
---
Wow man, the beast is a free Leggo of your choice, or you could just keep it for some mc tech shenanigans deck. Congrats
---
It‚Äôs a 2 Mana Auctioneer in a deck that plays a lot of combo cards, we just need some good ones to play in a deck that (pun intended) can **combo** together.
---
Holy shit, 6 damage? And it can go face?
---
Blizzard doesn't fuck around in this expansion when it tries to push new decks.
---
Ooze will come in Handy
---
The larger problem (apart from the battlecry) with this card is it's competing with Likim and it will never be able to overcome that (during this year).
---
3-mana 4/2 weapon is super good. Aggro and control Pally played Truesilver even when the healing didn‚Äôt matter, and this is a mana cheaper. It‚Äôs also better than Fiery War Axe which still see‚Äôs play at 3 mana.
---
It‚Äôs exactly what a Common class Card should be. Solid, powerful design. It‚Äôs really well done.
---
Oh nice racism.
---
Oh it's a tower I just remembered. Thank you. (I know what totems are supposed to symbolise and I did not remember the card's full name)
---
All Old Odd Rogue players collectively drooled.
---
While we're at it can we reduce mage secret costs to 2? Hunter's secret cost 2 and paladin cost 1. Mage's secrets aren't that much better but they cost more.
---
Well Rise of Shaows should of been weak in comparisons because Un'Goro had much stronger previous expansions to compete with. Remeber that Un'Goro was launched with Whispers of the Old Gods which was quite a powerful expansion, Mean Streets of Gadgetzan arguably one of the strongest expansions up there with Knights of the Frozen Throne and Kobolds and Catacombs, and One Night in Karazhan which was also a pretty strong expansion.
---
In comparison Rise of Shadows was competing with Witchwood which was lower power level, Boomsday which was lower power level, and Rumble which was lower power level. In comparison I would say Rise of Shadows was significantly stronger than Un'Goro relative to the other expansions it was with. It added some of the strongest cards in the current meta and basically created two of the most dominant archetypes which were this year's iteration of Tempo Rogue and Token Druid.
---
If this card was 1 Mana it would be in every Rogue deck. I wonder if the two Mana is going to make this too slow?
---
I guess this card will never survive a turn from your opponent. So 95% of the time this will just activate combos by being played first anyway.
---
Those priests, no. There is almost a schism in priest ideology, where some seem the shadow and the void unusable and malicious, those who seek to exalt in it (shadow priest), and those who believe in a balance of both for true understanding (discipline). Velen is definitely in the first camp, and Anduin was more in the discipline camp, using mind controls very liberally in MoP, with more recent action seeming very priest of the light. 
---
Paladins were created by Alonsus Faol as an order of priests who "actually get out and do something". Alonsus however, still a priest, is raised as an undead and leads the Conclave mediating the bickering between holy priests and shadow priests as a discipline priest. 
---
All of this is to say that the shifting ideology of priests, gravitating between light and shadow, is baked into their identity, whereas paladins have always been warriors of light, formed from priests who didn't want to sit around anymore. Shadow, darker elements and darker magic is kind of what gives them an identity separate from just "weaker paladin". Forsaken and troll priests certainly embody this as well, and would very easily be seen engaging in ethically questionable magic.
---
i plan on spamming quest infinite undatakah paladin. so i like the quest its just i wish its completion wasn't tied to this expansions new keyword.
---
Curved swords. Curved. Swords.
---
Consecration for 1 more mana, no face damage, two cards, a 3/2 body and a secret. You guys should actually stop making comparisons between cards that are nothing close to each other.
---
Here are the combo cards currently in standard: \[\[Cold Blood\]\], \[\[Eviscerate\]\], \[\[Defias Ringleader\]\], \[\[Perdition's Blade\]\], \[\[SI:7 Agent\]\], \[\[Headcrack\]\], \[\[Edwin VanCleef\]\], \[\[Kidnapper\]\], \[\[Cutthroat Buccaneer\]\], \[\[Crazed Chemist\]\], \[\[Raiding Party\]\], \[\[EVIL Miscreant\]\].

---
3/2/2 | Combo: Gain +2/+2 for each other card you've played this turn.  
---
Except the card is pretty bad
---
Auctioneer draws your deck. This adds random combo cards to your hand. Am I misunderstanding you?
---
Imho 2 mana less shark means more rogue shenanigans. This card is cheap so it can act as combo activator. 
---
Also it will not be killed by Dyn-o-matic on curve.
---
you can double this battlecry if you have the quest done, but them, you can't summon totems...
---
so bad...
---
All of the mage secrets are also really bad right now, with the exception of maybe counterspell but even that is a useless card 50% of the time when you're going first. If runes and ice block were in standard these cards would be really good.
---
8 mana 2 cards: play a random secret, summon a 4/4 and deal 6 damage. Reminds me of UE in a way
---
don't forget the new combo weapon
---
Kinda feels like it
---
&gt;However, its not always easy to chain these cards together, with cards like Kidnapper, Raiding Party, and Perdition's Blade.
---
I think people will use it the same way you use Angler optimally: Make sure to have a few 1 drops/2 drops in your hand, in case you RNG a bunch of 3/4/5 drops.
---
If they wait til they have at least 2-3 combo cards in hand (and maybe preps) the odds that the chain breaks early is low; If you get one of the big/bad one, just use an eviscerate to keep it going.
---
The biggest problem I see with playing this the fact you are already running 2 S:I and 2 miscreant I am not sure if you want to put a third combo card in your 3 mana slot.
---
Wow!!! 5 mana fireball with a 4/4 body... this is insane.
---
Does this open up a weapon rogue? Just run 4 weapons, a few toxicologists, greenskin, raiding party, the pirates. That's a lot of damage.
---
Baku on turn 3/(2with coin) without restrictions.
---
To be fair, that's 2 cards and a subset (a non specific secret) of a third you'd need to have on turn 3 to use it.
---
I named my aggro discard-lock ‚Äúpanic! At the discard‚Äù
---
Linework is bad, but the colours are done really well! 7/10
---
This has more potential than you'd think. It counts towards the new shaman quest and works with the reward (double battlecries after playing 6 battlecry cards). In such a quest shaman deck you want to run as much lackey synergy, the new EVIL totem adds lackeys at the end of your turn, this doubles the EVIL totem therefore resulting in lackey quest totem shaman madness!
---
hag is very underrated, murloc shaman can mix all of this in
---
Genuinely would be incredible IP crossover. The existing LEGO fictional world audience (ie Ninjago) would be all over it. But I‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs a lot of red tape stopping it.
---
r/humansbeingbros
---
There is no reason to play this over Deadly Poison.
---
Unidentified Maul could summon two 1/1s and that wasn‚Äôt even the best outcome most of the time.
---
True, but in wild there is ice block which is basically a secret you have all game so medivh's valet is still relevant there
---
The Electra omega mind lightening bolt combo just got powercreeped by frost  lichcloud Prince
---
Original.
---
I cant read ‚Äôdio‚Äô in a normal voice in My head. Its always very dramatic and annoying.
---
Send help :(
---
i love how they fix the problem in future cards but not the original problem
---
&gt; Looks at comment
---
And of course it's a racist.
---
Read it again
---
Hard to decipher amongst all the comments regarding wild.
---
3/4 of beasts are almost always good, some in quarter of the pool are good in specific scenarios (for example Skitterer), all secrets have at least a little bit of impact and all weapons are good.
---
Bonus points for synergy with 2/3 of weapon pool.
---
To sum up: we gonna play it will our 10 mana hero card.
---
Thanks for the false dichotomy!
---
If only there were some other themes Mage currently has in standard, such as hero power, elementals, spell damage, or hand-size. If only...
---
P.S. I didn't say this theme is bad in and of itself, just wished they'd actually support existing archetypes, rather than create a new one each set, and all of them end unsupported.
---
Oh ho! Then get as many mana as you need.
---
The point of the basic set to to introduce new players.  Combo and Choose One are both "complex" mechanics.  Remember, these players are still figuring out how taunt works, how to target spells, and when to trade.
---
I guess thats a good point; this guy at worst is a more expensive fireball in the lategame, that also heals you a bit, potentially stalling your ice block being popped.
---
why would odd rogue even want to pay this? HP + Deadly Poison gets you the same 4/2 weapon for 1 less mana with no conditions, and that's not even a core 2-of in every list.
---
I think this will end up being more of a tempo or value card than some combo OTK finisher. I just don't see how any combo with this would be better than just running Faceless Manipulator.
---
Late game it does not that much but its overall a good tempo
---
Yep. Aside from maybe a handful of months of the year, Priest is always in the dumpster with a mishmash of cards that never get enough support. At least Paladin players had a deck that was high Tier 1 through the entire duration of the April 2018 - March 2019 season.
---
The ‚Äútotem‚Äù tribe has always made me think of ‚Äútotem poles‚Äù from Native American culture, which were usually stacks of multiple figures.  
---
It would be cool to get a new totem that‚Äôs a big stack that summons smaller ones as a deathrattle (a 3/3 goes to 3 1/1s or 2/2s then 1/1s).  
---
That would be sticky enough to almost guarantee something is left to replicate the following turn.
---
I like it, but only because it‚Äôs a combo enabler that generates more cards - which is like a mini auctioneer of sorts... the problem is that there‚Äôs not a to of cheap combo cards that can cycle with this so it will only get you 1-2 cards and the get killed by literally anything coming to standard this expansion...
---
Eh, Aluneth mage kinda abandons the idea of tempo eventually, and thats what makes this guy a bit worse than valet; even coming down on time, it's usually 3 turns before you lose board control completely once you reach that point.
---
&gt;When to trade
---
Me go face?
---
He is a standard Mark tho
---
Seems bad on paper - but I‚Äôm waiting for a nutty combo that fills a board with totems and then changes them all into murlocs...
---
No I'm like 90% everyone agrees that it's hot garbage.
---
I got the treasure that shuffles 10 scroll of wonders in my deck, and one of them casted academic espionage, that‚Äôs how I got the shaman weapon
---
Can we stop fucking getting random card generators
---
I don't think the cube works like that though. It only gains deathrattle upon destroying an minion
---
About 4 years ago
---
Before the Prep Nerf my tesspionage had a fighting chance. Now it just gets stomped by everything. :/
---
it comes in pretty late and you have to remove some good low cost spells from your deck to make sure you get what you want. say if you're running blizzard and flamestrike and you want to play this on 8 for a boardclear/stall, even having 6 different spells on your deck you have a 20% chance to not get one of the boardclears as a discover option
---
Varies between metas. Warlock and mage are probably my favorites even though I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of their current decks. Evolve shaken is probably my all time favorite.
---
Well, Aluneth as the main archetype is rather. Wild mage is mostly burn with the major damage being done by: (a) either early giants or (b) flamewaker + apprentice + hand of cheap spells. Most play one duplicate secret, runes, counterspell, mana bind (especially if quest) and ice block. I agree, the flakmage doesn‚Äôt Deal face so it‚Äôs only worth for one copy per deck. Yet again, burn mage is the most broken archetype in wild. I‚Äôd actually say it needs nerfing, especially since the new expansion doesn‚Äôt seem to bring any new themes into it. It‚Äôs only getting stronger.
---
seeing the actual card was like hearing the artifact announcement reaction in my head
---
I chuckled, hold this updoot
---
is it bad that I was sitting here for a few minutes wondering how a warlock was supposed to get 2 backstab cards?
---
i totally forgot cube was neutral.
---
*eke
---
Ok now this is a control Mage‚Äôs greatest friend right here
---
Vanguard#11201 trading 80g on NA. I show, you go.
---
it might seem strong but i don't think it is good enough for constructive decks. in standart you can only play it safely on turn 5 (4 with coin). if you play it on turn 2 to play secret on next turn, it will be probably dead.
---
however, in wild you can play it on turn 3 (2) with a kabal lackey. if you play it on turn 5 (4) it probably won't any major effect cos at this moment you have 10-15 hp and 0 minions on a board (unless you got board clear from glyph or trick)
---
That's not actually the case. Even shaman is 40 percent vs big priest, they need at least a devolve (and dodging Barnes) to have a chance
---
Neat!
---
Secrets themselves are still solid. And if there's enough secret payoff it'll hit a critical mass and be good enough for one ofs. 
---
Plus if you're running a singleton deck you gotta have a wide breadth. We will see once all the cards come out and we get a chance to sit down with it, of course.
---
Ah yeah now that I think about it, you're right.
---
I think perditions blade is better than this. This card will see no play, 1 star.
---
this is insane in even shaman. totem golems, primalfin totems, evil totems etc all for free
---
I think they said it's to raid the bank of its valuable magical artifacts
---
For you non-wild players browsing: VS has the matchup going Odd Paladin's way 75% of the time.
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wild-drr/wild-matchup-winrates/
---
I swear mage is like the spoiled child of all the classes.
---
duh, you're right. Had the waggle pick cost in my head. Point stands though, I don't see any reason to run this in odd rogue
---
And perditions blade already exists and is better than this and already sees no play
---
Maybe Rogue‚Äôs Quest is to play a certain number of Combo cards and the reward is a 0 Mana Hero Power that says: ‚ÄúActivate your combo cards‚Äù
---
Freeze is freeze.  It falls on the similar game plan, draw-freeze- burst
---
This is coming from a player who got his golden mage by playing purely freeze mage during the brm - tgt days. 
---
You have the basic feeze package, 2 nova, 2 blizzard and 2 doom to stall. Ray of frost over powers flame strike by a mile and is a really good tool for freeze. 
---
You can still do the classic tony into a nova. Pocket galaxy mimics thaurisan‚Äôs effect to a degree. Its weaker but when it works its more nuts than old freeze mage. 
---
Yeah its its not the same as before where you rely purely on spell damage to win. but the conjurer‚Äôs package fits really well with the playstyle of freeze mages. Its just the thing that the archetype had to transform into to be competitive in today‚Äôs meta game. 
---
Its still weak vs warriors but this version is alot better vs today‚Äôs warriors in comparison to tgt freeze vs warriors. 
---
Control mages that existed in the past are reno and big spell mage. If you compare them side by side, there is a very thin line separating those 2 archetypes. They play almost similarly. But control mages dont play Novas, frost bolts and fireballs in favor for other board clear / wincon. 
---
Here‚Äôs a top 10 ladder freeze mage list if you still dont buy it 
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/freeze-mage-shadows-hof-10-legend-theo/
---
Well at least I have to try hard to win, and have encountered poor sportsmanship and good sportsmanship, indicative of a competitive scene.
---
They nerfed Headcrack portrait!?! I didn't know that got caught up in that mess too.... my lord Blizzard, my lord
---
Wild spiteful mage? Not sure if theres good enough low cost minions to fill the curve tho.
---
Otherwise just control mage in standard with puzzle box as random wincon. Conj callin for actual wincon.
---
I tried so hard to make him work when I opened him day 1. It didnt go well
---
Some one has never been on the receiving end of a retribution paladin.
---
The ideal play I see with this is going Whirlkick Master, Prep, Evis, Miscreant.  5 mana and you played 2/6 of stats, dealt 4 damage to something, generated 2 combo cards and 2 lackeys while maintaining your hand size. The Miscreant could also be an 8/8 Edwin instead.  It's a kind of specific scenario though so whether that play is worth it, remains to be seen.
---
Shaman quest reward seems spicy.
---
I agree with the sentiment that pogos are the better card for a deck like this, but.... There's no rush and no taunt on the Pogo Hoppers, and no vanish to clear your opponents board for them in standard. You need to untap with Pogo Hoppers to threaten your opponent, or have zilliax on top of copying 7 of them. If you're getting 7 of the same 1-cost minion on board, High Keeper Ra is a better payoff than some beefy statsticks with no immediate impact, IMHO.
---
yu gi oh's first big super legendary cards were a card called Ra , a card called Obelisk and a card called silfer.
---
we now have a Ra and an Obelisk in HS
---
thankyou for letting us know we fixed the link so now it goes to the card's DT
---
Alot of these are fine if you dont maindeck them imo.
---
This card is really good if Big Spell mage is any good.
---
I mean, yes, priest has the least number, but Druid and Warrior is also very close and 4 and 3 cards respectively, right?
---
Yeah that works. Also if we get to finish warlock quest and draw into glinda with tome of origination we can do the combo right away!
---
"Almighty protector of the sun and sky, I beg of thee, please heed my cry. Transform thyself from orb of light and bring me victory in this fight. I beseech thee, grace our humble game. But first I shall...call out thy name,¬†Highkeeper Ra!"
---
I believe people won't really play Obelisk due to the fact that it is so expensive and needs to be discounted, while Cultist is 4 mana cheaper and has a better effect.
---
Dude, Leeroy is old news.  You should be copying Desert Obelisks!
---
Entrance is nice... but that end of turn animation is some sexy shit.
---
AviKun was the most important combo for druids in wild, the nerf crippled it. Don't try and imply that it was anywhere near oppressive. AK47 Druid was, yes, but Star Aligner/ Psychmelon shouldve got the nerf, not Aviana.
---
Time for some taxonomy:
---
**The Ancient One**: 30/30 summoned by Blood of the Ancient
---
**The Bncient One**: same as above, but memes
---
**The Dncient One**: [[The Darkness]], a 20/20 summoned by extinguishing candles
---
**The Jncient One**: 30/30 Jade golems, created by summoning larger and larger man
---
**The Rncient One**: 20/20, summoned by filling up your board with Mogu cultists
---
What are the others?
---
EVIL Totem into this into two Lackeys which all fuels the Battlecry playstyle.
---
If you want all the rewards try to finish a run in under 40 minutes. Warrior and rogue are probably best bet.
---
Bruh just use barnes and blood as the only two minions
---

Fingers crossed for at least a few neutral dragons in this set.

I'm not sure what the other options are. Maybe Rogue with Lab Recruiter but that seems really slow.

Get two of these, Glinda, and grim rally in hand in wild with a Thaurissan tick, and you can do this in warlock
---
This would work, if the opponent isn't playing any minions or removal until T3 and provided that you've got the best starting hand.
---
If the current pool of totems stays the same, I don't think it'll be of any worth. So much for hoping for a great battlecry weapon that shaman could use with the new quest.
---
I think he meant to say "currently not enough good secrets and make secrets cost (0) cards to make this card work."
---
Less shitty than the last tortollan, but still situational at best
---
Which was nice
---
I was 99% that this would be a Priest card, because of the art... Well I was wrong... I'm not so sure anymore if any Priest card will be revealed this week...
---
Highkeeper looks straight up like Kratos. I‚Äôm about it!
---
Maybe it will though.   If you don‚Äôt value the bounce effect.  With the current cards we have...I mean idk.  It‚Äôs faster.  It has combo synergy if they print more of that, and on turn 2 you can coin this with the 3/3 taunt.
---
Hell maybe you even run both.
---
I don‚Äôt.
---
Cyclone mage is just the current more popular version, they need need to be careful when they print cards that cost less than 7 mana because regardless of the pretty low power level of mage cards conjurer's calling is just waiting to break the game.
---
Gang up doesn't benefit from "Battlecries trigger twice" synergies though.
---
[deleted]
---
I don't know, man, it was problematic, but killing it altogether was not a good solution
---
Its tumblr-level bad. 
---
"Did you just-"
---
"Get out."
---
Et cetera.
---
5/5 that casts a bonus Blizzard or Flamestrike
---
Wtf
---
Ayayayaya
---
Agree, I was mostly talking about the Warlock and Mage hero powers
---
Ahhh finally a proper wincon for my elek-plottwist deck....?
---
way too slow -&gt; dust
---
Obelisk and Ra? Slyfer the Sky Dragon incoming!
---
When your 3k atk God is just an expensive 3/3 in hearthstone
---
The ¬ÆÔ∏èüÖ∞Ô∏èncient One!
---
Have they said if you can get the 20/20 off evolve effects or conjures calling?
---
I think most people would tell you that miscreants basically makes it all fit, hell even odd rogue in wild runs it. It's too good of a card to cut out
---
A few things worth noting, mtg has ALOT of stupid combos, so things like runescar demon are utterly devastating, and in mtg your draw is diluted by needing to play lands, so drawing cards there is even better than in hearthstone.
---
And then, after playing a Mogu Cultist -
---
**I SUMMON THE HIGHKEEPER üÖ±A**
---
If your able to copy cultist enough to fill your whole board then obelisk is going to be just fine.
---
I have no idea what ftfy means, but sure haha
---
personally I think it's pretty fucking lame to give the class with the best stall tools in the game no payoff for leveraging those tools, but whatever.
---
I think that Controlled Discard Warlock might actually be better for this. If Cultists are your lowest cost cards which you can discard with [[Shriek]]/[[Dire Troll]] and then you hit [[Soulwarden]] with [[Expired Merchant]], you're all set.
---
Seriously, get this poseidon looking motherfucker out my egyptian god power fantasy.

---
Psychmelon never should have been printed. I say that as a Day 1 AK47 player.
---
This is how you do a card that won't see any real play
---
So run a maximum of 4 spells and you'll always hit a blizzard or a flamestrike unless either have been drawn.
---
Glad people are out here keeping the meme alive
---
I assume conjure's calling can't pop this out can it?
---
Anyway to get the current pool of mage elementals to work together?
---
Iiiiiiiiiiiiii dont think so....?
---
&gt; [[Reckless Diretroll]]
---
Boy, the reaction from the Druid had to be priceless.
---
Oh, that's fair then.  I doubt they'd all survive to turn 4 though.
---
Not that it's that good as an 11 mana combo
---
The animation on this the battle cry summon is pretty baller! Would recomend watching the video in the link
---
Yeah but you have Tog's Scheme aswell, and Myras to get rid of everything else. If you play priest you can't play any other minions since they will get resurrected if you do.
---
what the fuck is wrong with you franco? you have iPad's all over the goddamn walls in your house, but you jack off like a fuckin' tortollan pilgrim!
---
Putting 7 obelisks down.... Still not as good as Ra.
---
\[\[Highkeeper Ra\]\]
---
This would be a good test.  Some one go do that!
---
If you start with an empty board then play the lackey and card you spend 4 mana total and you're end result is 8/8 stats on the board, 3/3 minion 5/5 sumon. For your logic you played 9/9 stats total but destroyed 1/1 of those so its 8/8
---
How do you have 2 in hand in the first place?
---
Ra isn‚Äôt collectible so he can‚Äôt be summoned by mage
---
Pretty slick, apart from the different class cards
---
Sounds like you want more people with Priest-heavy collections to migrate to wild and play control.
---
What turn?
---
Is it even possible in arena? What sets are going to be in arena when Uldum comes out?
---
Good decks arent built on averages, even though your claim that SI is better on average is something you just made up, since we have no data and dont know what the future meta will look like.
---
SMOrc
---
I tell you.
---
Impressive.
---
At least I have chicken
---
‚ÄúI WANT YOU! And you! And you!‚Äù
---
Don‚Äôt worry guys, I‚Äôm sure this one will be just as viable as pogohopper.
---
Nope, Conjurer's Calling can only summon collectible cards.
---
Ra isnt a collectable card. So it wont work. Similar you cant summon the Bancient One that way.
---
Nah doesnt work this way
---
Because that is already part of the identity of other classes (Mage, Druid and Rogue). Shaman too, but they are more of a "jack of all trades" kind of class.
---
Somehow I read ''Whenever you draw a card, you drew a card''.
---
Brilliant deduction.
---
2 vicious fledgling ?
---
3 north sea kraken ?
---
If it was 5 mana it would be nuts.
---
That's correct. Calling only generates collectible cards. Can't get stuff like this or Azari
---
Wa MU
---
They said they wanted to reduce the amount of damage Priest can deal from the hand to emphasize the controlling nature of the class. In the recent AMA, they said they didn't want Priest to feel like it can kill you next turn when it doesn't have a board. It's a reactive, manipulative class that wants to control the board. It shouldn't be that dangerous when it has no board.
---
Ra was supposed to be the strongest, so it works.
---
Got it, good news here! Thanks!
---
You don't need synergy. Even 6 mana 5/5 vanilla is good enough.
---
Not that WoW lore has any bearing on Hearthstone at this point, but I would like to point out that in WoW there are only 2 female Mogu that are known to exist. Just an interesting choice to make the card female.
---
This looks straight out of Yugioh
---
Super combo!
---
every 1-2 mana beasts are mostly good only when you have some certain card. the exceptions are butterfly (gives resources) and echo dog (it is trash)
---
highmane is 6 mana 10/9 in sum, new wild bloodstinger pulls out minions with battlecry or that were meant to be played with other cards or for some other reason (basicly every single minion in bomb warriour).
---
not a fan of hunter decks so i looked it up in some sites. mostly the only beast that costs 5 or more is 1 tundra rhino or none, so the new spider will mostly save you 1-2 mana. but you can keep it untill you draw rhino another hunter's pack
---
rhino is ok unless enemy has minions on a board
---
krush is good when you need to push dmg to face but it is 9 mana 8/8 so it is pretty bad. there is also a chance to shuffle 3 more in your deck (i forgot the name of that spell)
---
everything else is extremly situational which makes them pretty bad (unless the spider decreased their cost i guess)
---
Heistbaron will not be in the next arena rotation.
---
Misread that. My mistake, was thinking it was "add a 1/1 copy to your hand" not transform into the 1/1.
---
Ah makes sense. Thank you!
---
alMOSt EnoUGH dAmAGe tO kIlL waRRioR.
---
There, we all knew it was coming to so I got it out of the way
---
yep, at least it board wiped, and did 20 to face :/
---
Ooops, Meant Dark Pact.
---
you better believe thats what its for
---
You saying that wouldn't be awesome?
---
Too bad that control Rogue... \[\[Vanish\]\] ed.
---
Thanks!
---
what do you think if this card had "can have more than 2 in your deck" text? obviously it would be op, but i think that would be cool if a card was printed like that.
---
It‚Äôs simple.
---
I wait 7 turns
---
Play Mogu Cultist
---
Draw the rest of my deck
---
Shuffle Mogu Cultists into my deck
---
Draw them all, play them all
---
Then I summon Bighkeeper Ra!
---
[I play Barnes](https://youtu.be/GPAsYTzi-iI)...
---
Thanks
---
Druid: Please let me Introduce myself.
---
You could say he got *Krush‚Äôd*
---
Lmfao you‚Äôre totally right. Idk what I was thinking.
---
This card looks like a blast.  
---
Highkeeper Ra seems crazy unfair to evolve into
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. We suck.
---
Neither will Togwaggle Scheme or Heistbaron, I'm not sure most of ppl are aware that most of key cards will not be in next arena rotation.
---
Batman309#2885

Kratos will need the Braids of Chaos to tame that mane.
---
I've got a list of games id like to see remade. This is on that list.
---
Taz+Cultist+Tog scheme
---
Elise and Flooplise both have to die as well. If your opponent doesn‚Äôt have a board allowing for killing them, you can‚Äôt fill your board with Mogus.
---
AYAYA
---
Nah they‚Äôre all based on Titan keepers in Warcraft
---
I liked benedictus, I want another card like that that actually lets priest outfatigue people. Oh and more value generators in general. Priest needs a lot of help if it wants to compete with warrior and shaman as a control class. It seems blizzard doesn‚Äôt want priest to be an otk class any more so give us more control tools!
---
YGO: The Abridged Series is one of the best things to ever happen on Youtube and the YGO franchise in general. And LK is one damn handsome man and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.
---
Not enough for warriors armor unplayable. -,-
---
The issue with Priest having direct damage is in part it is something already had by (In descending order) Mage, Hunter, Rogue, Shaman, and to a lesser extent Warlock, making it something a lot of classes already have.
---
Additionally, Mind Blast was point for point the most efficient damage spell in the game. For two mana, Mage, Hunter, Shaman (when viewing Lightning Bolt's total mana cost) and Warlock can only deal three damage and Rogue can deal four with a condition. Priest were able to out-do each of them with no condition where it mattered.
---
While there is the Shadow Priest Discipline within World of Warcraft, Team 5 seems to want that aspect of the Priest class to be interpreted as copying your opponent's cards (Thoughtsteal, Devour Mind, Drakonid Operative, etc.), mind controlling your opponent's minions (Shadow Madness, Potion of Madness, Cabal Shadow Priest, etc.), and turning Healing effects into damage (Shadow form, Auchenai Soulpriest, etc.) over just overt and hyper efficient damage spells.
---
Unironically, you made a good point.
---
You can‚Äôt even spell your favorite card‚Äôs name right? How dare you lie to us like this.
---
Story time:
---
In WoW, Highkeeper Ra is known as Ra-den. He was locked up in the basement of the Lei Shen's palace (also known as a Throne of Thunder) and he was left in chains by the Thunder King himself after torturing him and tearing pieces off his body to empower himself and create powerful. Ra-den is a Titan Watcher in charge of watching over Pandaria and the remains of the old god Y'Shaarj. 
---
That being said, Ra-den is a being to not be messed with.
---
I did? Shit
---
There ya go. Let‚Äôs take the skeleton of the Pogo decks and just replace that 1/1 with this one. Obviously we‚Äôd need more survivability since you can play Pogos as they come, whereas these bois need to be played all at once... But there‚Äôs definitely something here. The meme is real
---
Haha, i was just kidding. Also, I don't have the arena skills to make it true.
---
No prob. Happy cake day!
---
Obelisk not keeping up to the standards. Its not a legendary, and compared to Ra is a bad joke. Also, its a monument, not a God lel
---
Say that to all people posting last week with 40 .ins or so.
---
&gt; on a stick
---
What does on a stick mean?
---
"my grandpa's deck has no pathetic cards,rexxar!!!"
---
Mage in Wild can pull it off with Simulacrum, Echo of Medivh and Molten Reflection.
---
Do you have something like a deck tracker screenshot to show that amount of delta?  Not trying to doubt you too much, but things like 1st/2nd WR are very vulnerable to confirmation bias.
---
It's simple...
---
Oh, yeah, because 6 and 10 are exactly the same.
---
If you use HS Deck Tracker just login on HSReplay and you can get your matches.
---
If not, download HS Deck Tracker :P
---
It's the immediate effect plus a body on the board that makes SI 7 a tempo beast. This card doesn't offer the same tempo. It's meta dependent based on how prevalent 5 health minions are, which would be out of range of Backstab + SI 7 but in range for this weap
---
And then the hunter plays deadly shot.
---
The dudes die due to a battlecry. So Ra triggers the turn he comes in.
---
Just wanted to comment that this was the best card reveal ive ever seen, incredible job!!
---
If you plot twist with an elekk on the board, does it draw twice as many too? Or does it only draw what you originally shuffled in and ignore the elekked ones?
---
Haven't heard that game in a while.
---
That would've been incredibly inconsistent, I think because it is a minion, and is a card you can add to your deck, it has to be in the evolve pool. I don't think you can make single exceptions in a game that will grow in card pool as quickly as hearthstone does. Its best when interactions work either as a category or exactly as on the card. 
---
If you want to say that The Darkness should've been a spell that summoned a 20/20 and shuffled candles into the opponents deck, that'd be fine, and probably wouldn't change too much other than how it interacts with some secrets and stuff like gadgetzan. You could also change the functionality of dormant minions as a whole in different ways, perhaps you can target them, but your opponent can't, but that'd open up a whole ton of interactions that'd be incredibly weird.
---
Elise + Floop. 4 cards, 2 turn combo
---
Yeah but then people would feel bad for doing all that work just to have it CC‚Äôd.
---
Yogg giveth, and Yogg taketh away. And so does his Puzzle Box.
---
2 weeks and there's the new rotation.
---
1 convenient local... in Africa
---
I do not have the card, but if it works I am willing to craft it, but I have a few questions:
---
1. Can I play with wild in the adventure mode
---
2. How do you use patches? / looks that when you play a pirate the card draws it self, but I do not see how can a 1/1 card can help to defeat the King?
---
[[tolin‚Äôs goblet]]
---
I like this card with Togwaggle‚Äôs scheme and Tak just fill your hand with mogu‚Äôs
---
UNABLE TO IGNORE BP SCUM DECK
---
So, what is this stemming from? That one Darkkk Mane video?
---
Obelisk? Ra? All we need is Slifer and I can finally quit Yu-Gi-Oh for good!
---
Generic advice to anyone entering the meta for the first time
---
There are incredible tools for finding what decks you can make for cheap. Go to hsreplay.net, link your Blizzard account to them and download hearthstone deck tracker. Yes, its a legit site. Hundreds of thousands of HS players use it daily. Once deck tracker is up and running, open my collection in game and HDT will upload your collection to HSR.
---
Then go back to HSR. Go to 'decks' and sort by name. It will list every deck it tracks and how much dust you'd need to spend to complete it, as well as the win rate of the deck and the number of matches recorded. Look for at least 1k matches, preferably 5k.
---
From there, dust bad cards and make good decks! If you have a question on a particular card, look it up on HSR as well. Anything used in less that .1% of decks is a pretty safe dust and you'd be amazed on how much dust you're sitting on.
---
I summon the üÖ±Ô∏èancient one
---
Sadly, there's no class that can consistently get a lot of armor and make 20hp burn useless :/
---
I‚Äôve literally never played against a totem shaman.
---
Yugi won with a revival jam, so for what you're looking for it needs to have the text "if a minion is summoned with 1 attack, destroy it and draw a card" and then they need to print a new slime. Idk what balance is so:
---
Eternal Slime
---
1 Mana
---
1/3
---
Deathrattle: If this minion was not attacked, resummon it.
---
Or just use prenerf dreadsteed.
---
Just because you do poorly with a deck doesn't mean the deck's bad. I'm not sure how you consistently manage to make such idiotic comments. I see your name constantly pop up on this sub, and constantly it feels like my brain cells are dying. Maybe this is a troll account, idk. I'm fine with shoddy card predictions and insane game feature suggestions, but intentionally misleading new players is where I draw the line. If you can't get your ass out of rank 20, stop these sort of comments.
---
Weird because here I am going first, playing on curve and wondering "How the fuck do they ALWAYS have an answer and can steal tempo, arena is so unbalanced right now!"
---
But it was the one that‚Äôs about to ruin wild even more.
---
its easy first i play barnes get the guy
---
I‚Äôll be surprised if it‚Äôs in the Arena pool
---
It would be so great for Switch too. Literal sad face
---
a another meme card this will be a good patch boys and girls
---
no since its noncollectible
---
If you had 2 dmh in hand you could go infinite
---
still kinda salty they never made a new one. it was so good.
---
I close it after my draft unfortunately, but I can attest to it for sure, you can even tune in and hear Kripp whine about it all stream. If anyone knows Hearthstone, its him.(not trying to fan boy, he literally plays at least 6-8 hours a day for 6 years now) 
---
Its worst with hunter or rogue, once you have the turn one advantage you just hit face and force your opponent to trade or just die to face damage by turn 7-12.
---
True
---
[removed]
---
I think OP got the image from Hearthpwn https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6831-new-neutral-card-revealed-mogu-cultist
---
I think they're the ones that put it in a card generator, with the Legendary gem, even though you can find the card on the playhearthstone.
---
Pretty sure  it will, 3 is just the minimum for the card so all 6 should go off or else it would say in the text. Not 100% though.
---
The Floop can be played a turn later, allowing you to possibly play the swipe and the new extra card you drew.
---
When I thought of this combo I thought of Baleful Banker instead of Swipe, for the Ra or possibly the Elise if all goes wrong.
---
So for this to work you would need a lot of small cards to make your hand is easy to dump.
---
The power level of this card is a bit extreme tbh. It will be in every hunter deck until it rotates
---
That'sthejoke.jpeg
---
This is so true. Hunter does everything now, just like broken classes in the past have done everything. I thought they were fixing things, lowering the power level these last two expansions so we could finally get the classes closer to some sort of equilibrium. Why bother with the whole "class identity" post, Blizzard, when you're just going off the script left and right with these cards? With their backwards logic, Priest should have mega proactive early drops and a 3 mana or less face burn spell to combo with Velen. So glad I haven't preordered in several expansions. Nothing changes.
---
God I love the art on MtG cards.
---
Shit hit the fan and the green one ignored orders.
---
Ok, I all ready checked and I can use wild in the adventures, but how do you use patches...?
---
Thanks for your help
---
You can theoretically get enough copies of this card to pull it off in any class by using Barista Lynchen + bounceback effects. Obviously very inconsistent though because you need them to stick
---
Do people really think that people who work out do it because they are insecure?
---
Short but slightly wrong  answer: There‚Äôs no benefit,  
---
Much longer more correct answer:  Cards get nerfed occasionally and when they get nerfed, rather than disenchanting them for a little bit of dust,  you can disenchant them for their full value.  Some players tend to hold onto their cards before expansions because it‚Äôs unclear what will be nerfed in the coming meta.
---
Practical answer:  Dark Iron Dwarf is probably never going to be nerfed.  You can safely dust it.
---
‚ÄúFuck this card in particular‚Äù
---
What‚Äôs jarring, is that there‚Äôs still only 6 of them!
---
psychopomp has some serious potential for a midrangey priest list to take shape.
---
Regular Lab recruiter doesn't generate golden copies of a golden card so there is at least one case where this is currently true. I guess there are some inconsistencies in the way golden card generation works.
---
Looking at the wiki it should work like Thoughtsteal for the Elise case. I stand corrected.
---
Big Priest isn't even a 50% win rate deck on Wild ladder. Let that sink in.
---
i hate periods
---
Twisting Nether still GOAT
---
Schrodinger's INSECT
---
Holy shit, minus the discover effects that's basically the same card
---
Random trivia: LK did the audio description for one of the new star wars films. Think it was The Force Awakens
---

---
What usually happens is that classes with small amounts of reveals earlier on into the cycle usually get a big batch of synergistic cards later on. Freeze Shaman had most of its cards revealed in a short space of time towards the end of the reveals, because it wouldn't make sense to reveal one at a time.
---
The question is which prebuilt deck Blizzard has made for priests this time.
---
I don't read minds but if I did I may have caught your drift.
---
I've always thought Mecha'Thun is a bit underwhelming as well.
---
Fucking Custodes.
---
But then you're not playing Oblisks, which is like not playing at all.
---
Or all face, maybe, probably not, definitely!
---
Thank you for clearing it up
---
Wait, where is all this count down shizz
---
Bruh, come on. Mogu live in Pandaria, not in Uldum...
---
Like wtf. Do they even play their Blizzard Games?
---
So.... run both, right? Run both.
---
The shitting axe is made of poop, it's much less sharp.
---
Silence and copy?  I figure you only need one live copy  to trigger?
---
This combo needs Myra's in there somewhere so you can consistently draw just the cultists.
---
Talking about otks though.
---
I don‚Äôt know of it can work in the new 2 new Murlocs, amalgam, AND this just for something that isn‚Äôt that big of a pay off. A 4 mana 3/2 weapon is just so bad if it doesn‚Äôt hit amalgam
---
Maker of titans, or titan who makes things?
---
Or just play 7 of these then drakkari and do 40 damage to all enemies for 10 mana
---
Orly?
---
I'm thinking $50 to unlock all of the Commons and Rares plus 20% of the Epics from the sets currently in Standard, aside from the current set, might be reasonable. That would at least give me a foot in the door....
---
Yes but for 3 mana to be able to deal with a minion that has 4 health and have a 4 attack charge leftover can be a huge tempo swing.
---
But you had lethal next turn regardless, why not heal face?
---
You're a u gi o joke.
---
They all have high mana cost. They sound like wow on paper but in practice you'd just get overrun if the meta is slightly aggro at that time.
---
They all have great meme values tho, and we can expect a bunch of incoming videos featuring these combos being pulled
---
Oh no they released a meme epic, pay to win boiz
---
WHAT
---
Yeah, but I just want to see the animation happen twice in one go. It's a transformation trigger, right? So there's no deathrattle shenanigan we could use...
---
Does wock stop triggering if it's transformed? Or could we use faceless + this battlecry + uhhh... dopplegangster?
---
Wait, no, we'd need treachery + mind control to get rid of this and then take it back. And that's just too much.
---
Paladin seems to be the way to go, if you can make the combo work, since it's a 2 mana 0 card way to duplicate this effect. Crystology to draw, quest hero power. The question is, if you ask me, just... Can paladin practically replicate enough of these, and draw them, while finishing quest, with only three spare slots in hand? And also, can you do it effectively enough against non-Warrior classes to be wrothwhile given the existence of warrior?
---
Compared to....?
---
Tbf, I never watched one piece. The only anime I‚Äôve watched with more than a season or two is naruto
---
Let people have their memes, it's the only joy they are going to get once the expansion releases and they meta becomes quickly as stale as it's always been.
---
Wow, I was honestly talking to my brother and cousin about this game the other day. Such a great card game. I truly haven't played any other game quite like it since then.
---
Bitch you wish lol
---
You also died to eviscerate, double SI, lifedrinker + SI, and miscreant shenanigans. Its hard to determine what was correct without knowing how many cards are in hand,  but in general you should bet on rogue being able to do 4 damage with any hand with at least like 4 or 5 cards. That being said I think this play was mostly incorrect because you had lethal set up as long as you didn't die.
---
Lol with the phasing out of older cards and the in game system its impossible to play competitively unless you shell out dough regularly. You're clearly a fucktard though.
---
Could we record gameplay too??
---
I don't have hs replay rn
---
The meta is fucked
---
Nice observation
---
... are you joking here or wearing a tin foil hat?
---
Don't need card draw. Just play

7/6/6 | Whenever you shuffle a card into your deck, add a copy to your hand.

1/-/- | Choose a minion. Shuffle 1 |4(copy, copies) of it into your deck. (Upgrades each turn!)  
---
Really?  You're using Freeze Shaman as an example?  I guess Priests are just fucked either way.
---
That's more reasonable. Now how do we get the 5  copies in paladin?
---
Not joking.
---
You *do* get nine Classic packs from the Return of the Hero quests (unless they changed that), and there are the guaranteed legendaries within the first ten packs of each set you missed.
---
They've also being offering bundles of older but still Standard sets the last couple years on top of new bundles here and there.
---
Glinda is sick in Wild Even Wisplock. She's a cool card in general.  
---
Try doing things with her and summoning portal for some cool swings.

---
and this is different than Darkness how?
---
someone beat some sense into me because I think this is fairly easily done. With copying minions, putting copies of minions into your deck and the such, This has more potential than the BAncient One
---
29th to 31st is best guess.  Usually at least 5 days and early in the week Mon-Wed.
---
Til you face the ultra cheap Exodia deck that gets you before you power up.
---
The echo stays if Glinda dies so you only need one cultist.
---
Yes, orally.
---
You can't, you wouldn't have enough space in your hand for any other cards. Unless I'm miscounting
---
Yes but different strokes for different folks.  It would probably go better with Priest but this is one of the new archetype themes that has stuck (Deathrattle never really has)
---
Outjerked again ://///
---
jUsT a wOrSe OnYxiA
---
Uncraftable cards cant be summoned like that
---
Going down the list for those unfamiliar with it;
---
Lanipator did YuYuHakusho (the abridged movie was pretty great)
---
MasakoX &amp; Vegeta 3986 tackled early Naruto
---
Hbi2k abridged (and finished!) Berserk, Gantz, and Escaflowne
---
and Antfish did the old adaptation of Part 3 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It was outstanding.
---
Wish there was one initial sweeping laser on the minions (if any). Then a focused shot on the hero.
---
Is amazing but was kinda derpy... like it took the minion summon order into account.
---
Riftcleaver is literally Azari, but with colorful arms.
---
Stating facts about your attitude and personality is just being factual.  This isn't /r/politics - no need to get your millennial knickers in a twist. :)    
---
Now where exactly does it clearly and obviously state Conjurer's calling cannot summon a non-collectible minion?  I mean it must be blatantly obvious right? You should have no trouble providing this obvious source.
---
&gt;These cults also have agents that monitor social media that pages then when certain keywords are posted. Then they appear and attack the poster with all kinds of insults.
---
So if I attack this post are you assuming that I am said anti-occult government agent and not just a random Redditor laughing at you?  how do I know that you aren't a government agent planting a false flag to misdirect us from the aliens training us to fight to the death in MOBA's?
---
I don't think it does. Warlock self destruction cards like Ratcatcher and Voidterror gain double stats with doubled battlecries.
---
Are you sure? OP said his chance of winning going second is 20-25% but said nothing about chance of winning going first.
---
What if OP only wins 30-35% of the time going first?
---
Meta is meta.  
---
You don't have to do it, you can play any deck you like.  Maybe you'll make a meta breaker of your own.  
---
Otherwise don't complain about not being able to lift your win rate.
---
Noooooo ),:
---
Well which one is Kowalski?
---
You don't get to define what is a 'cheat' in this game.
---
You can craft the Darkness. You can't craft this card.

https://hsreplay.net/cards/48146/dr-boom-mad-genius#tab=recommended-decks  
---
SHOULD show you all decks with that card in it but it's broken and only lists 1 page.  I'd posted on the sub for hsreplay but got no answer as to why it behaves this way.  
---
It would make answering your question easier if it worked correctly.
---
This is why prep raiding party was the part of rogue they nerfed ü§î otherwise this would be a nasty combo
---
As an alien I can confirm this.
---
PS: Please don't come to area 51. Leave us alone.
---
Thanks for clearing that up
---
But Mogu Cultist is a battlecry, you have to play the 7th one
---
Are you really calling playing meta decks and using deck trackers cheating?
---
I still like Azari the Devourer's best
---
Can‚Äôt druid really easily trigger The mogu cultists. Draw 2 of them then Elise and floop. That doesn‚Äôt even require that much set up.
---
I definitely hope you're right. I just feel like older sets, like Kobolds or Frozen Throne or Old Gods, have generally been more cohesive, thematically, and had higher art quality, than what we've been shown so far. But as you say, the majority of the set is still not revealed, so hopefully things'll improve as we get closer to completion.
---
All a deck tracker does is present information to you that is already available in a more efficient manner. It doesn't make any decisions for you. So I'm not quite sure how you arrived at the conclusion that that is cheating. 
---
As to your complaint regarding access to the card pool - welcome to card-based games. If you don't like it, then this genre probably isn't for you.
