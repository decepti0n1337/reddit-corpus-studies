It summons a 4 mana minion that exist in BG, it can be any tier (eg Gentle Megasaur (6), Infested Wolf (3)).
---
---
---
I don't disagree with your primary point, and I'd say that I agree with some of your secondary points with various caveats (Shaman, my favorite class, is often given toys that become too hard to beat.)
---

---
However, I disagree with a tertiary point you made... &gt;!that being that Standard mode \*is\* Hearthstone. I think it's fair to say that Standard is Hearthstone's "first foot forward", especially for new players, but Wild players have a pretty strong claim to the game as well. Heck, from a sheer numbers standpoint, as of the next rotation if you don't play Wild then you're missing out on over half of the game since Wild-exclusive cards will outnumber Standard cards.  !&lt;But that's all beside the primary point you're making, don't wanna digress too much.
---
Sounds exciting!
---
Sorry bud.
---
Yeah I hardly play her perfectly. I believe she's very high tier but I play other heroes much better.
---
It would still be insane. Because any and all tribe synergy works with it. You don't have to do any critical thinking or planning. Just pick a "Give X +2/+2" and take it, to buff the Nightmare.   
---
All Tribe is too strong for Battlegrounds.
---
I say standard is the game because that's what Blizzard designs for, balances around, and supports competitively. Standard just sells more packs than Wild
---
I summons a 4-cost minion **from battlegrounds pool**. Also notice it doesn't say summon tavern-tier-4  minion.
---
Another example: Mounted Raptor, tavern-tier-2; 3-cost minion 
---
&gt;Deathrattle: Summon a 1-cost minion.
---
It summons a Shifter Zerus, tavern-tier-3; 1-cost minion
---
I tried that but kept running into rogue with  20 nzoths shuffled in

Oh I never noticed that, thanks for the tip!

I disagree honestly, just a major flaw with the expansion is that too many of the cards either supported doomed archetypes/ones about to rotate out like Quest Warlock, Odd Mage, Quest Hunter, Spell Hunter.
---
Maybe you should read the stickied post?

I think his is the count of the number of different cards in each tier. Not copies of cards at each tier.

I didnt say Aggro is evil but your point is: Degenerate aggro decks are fine because they keep other degenerate decks in check?
---
So no one is gonna touch 1st point ? Hard disruption should exist in every card game. My suggestion is series of hand traps similar to [ghost girls](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Ghost_Girl_(series)) from YGO. Add stuff like [battle fader](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Fader) and [swift scarecrow](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Swift_Scarecrow). This would solve a decent amount of problems listed here. Of course they would need to be balanced properly.
---
Edit : links
---
No they didn't. The rats should have attacked before the hyena.
---
It is beta, I do believe there are going to be more cards added at the end of beta, just my assumption.
---
U can discover minion that has ran out out of stock?!?
---
so every turn, Jaina could ruin people’s game plans? OP as fuck. Bye junkbot
---
I'm kinda amazed at the amount streamers have been playing it. It's a fun game but after playing a while it feels like the same thing a lot. The more you play, the less the games differ
---
Oh, ok. My mistake.
---
The real solution is that no other cost reducer should getting past summoning Portal.
---
If you have Portal in play, regardless of what other cost reducers you have, it should ALWAYS set the cost to 1 it it would be 0.
---
As for the tavern Brawl, I don't care about that. It's a week long, doesn't affect ladder, etc
---
He starts with 60 health
---
Alot these seem incredibly bad or OP AF. The Paladin one is WAY OP, +10 health is crucial.

It's easy to play, cheap to build, and transitions well into Wild.
---
I mean, in constructed you often know the deck type and even amount of removals. In arena you do not, so it doesn't fit what he is describing. Though arena probably is closer to what he wants than current standard, which is your main point.
---
you just got woshed!!!!!!
---
Because most of us are burned out on three expansions a year without any real innovation.
---
We got a new game mode...... that’s not really a new game mode. So yeah.
---
Reveals don’t start until the 21st, and the other cards have already been discussed
---
I feel like Malfurion's doesn't make any sense. Swapping stats is more Priest's thing rather than Druid's. I figured he'd have a "Give a friendly minion +1/+1" or something, but maybe that's just me.
---
You keep saying "patch", I don't think you understand what it means. How would a "patch" affect SN1P-SN4P in Wild unless it's a direct nerf? You sure you're not paraphrasing pro-Evolve copypasta?
---
Jaina is OP in this lineup
---
Done!
---
Yea idk I tried doing one the way he did it in this, took a bite and almost threw up. Had to power trough the second one cuz I hate wasting.
---
I think the way it would work it would remove minion from Mage player's tavern
---
But did you win?
---
When you say "viscious syndicate", do you mean that they're a bloodthirsty syndicate or they have the consistency of a hot loogie?
---
While it’s not entirely luck based, this game mode is roughly 50% or so luck 50% actual decisions that matter. Math might be wrong XD

What about healing minions like rotten applebaum? It may help increase the viability of late game comp. Lifesteal or battlecry heal may extend the game by too much.
---
Not really though, just getting +1+1 every turn is a lot worse than the amalgam that curator already has
---
I see what you’re saying and I guess you are right.  It’s kind of a different game all together, not a different Hearthstone mode.
---
It wouldn't make it unabashed. You'd just have to diversify your combos. Combos based around a single combo piece would be vulnerable, but they *should* be vulnerable.
---
Any healing that goes to a hero might cause games to stretch unnecessarily. Maybe minion heals would work better in that case.
---
50 days ago you were crying about losing to an inner fire priest. It’s not even a tier one deck right now. It’s not that hard to beat

Ask yourself what is the meta when wild cards leave. Priest will have no removal and no lategame, druid will have no armor potential it does now. Shaman 's biggest change would be that non quest versions would die.

I think tarven level should do less damage and minions do way more damage. There should be a problem was flooding zoo early to prevent greedy players.
---
It's not the best deck this brawl. Patches + Mark of the Lotus + some armor gain card (prolly Feral Rage) is the best, as far as I can tell, and before that Ice Block + Fireball + Arcane Mysteries beats almost anything, including snip. Yea flare beats that but I beat like 10 snips without ever seeing that.
---
Wait... so he can become tier 6 minions?! I thought he was locked to like tier 3. I see... so basically it is a luck thing. Interesting.

Can someone ELI5 the issue?
---
Can this cause someone to create a massive creature (or multiple massive) in a single turn?
---
She’s all about risk vs reward and getting ahead of your opponents and destroying them before they can ramp up to your level. Probably one of if not the highest skill requiring hero. The damage doesn’t matter when you are a tavern level ahead of everyone else and getting the best minions.
---
note: they synergize perfectly though because in menagerie builds you want some un-typed units. Also it would be wayy too strong early game. You can take almost any minion turn 1 and beat every other minion with a free 2/2. In fact you probably beat people with two minions on turn 2, while upgrading instead of buying one. If this started once you hit rank 2 I think it might be balanced.
---
Exactly
---
Q: Is battlegrounds going to get frequent balance changes?
---
A: Yes for a while at least
---
I hope a while doesn't mean like until summer

I would literally just cut the "guarantee a demon" clause, I like the thematic, but tap refresh is basically a redraw, so its already on theme. Added type control is just op.

There's a series of youtube videos called "Trump's teachings" which do well on the basics of hearthstone, even if the decks are currently outdated.  If you're looking for potential decks, vicious syndicate goes into detail about the current top tier decks, though don't worry about building those right off the bat.
---
For some general advice:  Open packs until you get a legendary.  There's a guaranteed legendary within the first 10 packs, so that can help you build your collection up pretty quickly.  With a new expansion coming up within a month, there'll be some new decks and a fair bit of free stuff given out, and that'll help you build your collection.
---
At the starter ranks, stats on the board are generally most important thing.  So a 3/5 taunt might not be as good as a 4/5 without taunt, the extra attack certainly matters.
---
Battlegrounds is new and is being talked about quite a bit.

&gt; Especially less randomized hero dmg where a low statted 4-6 cost minion (e.g. megasaur) is summoned as part of deathrattle and randomly kills you.
---
Yeah, that is pretty crappy.  Deathrattles like that really shouldn't be a thing.
---
You can definitely do it day of, but like you said it'd be safer to not wait past the 9th if you want to pre-order.
---
The intent is that the Totem is a 1/1 during the first combat, as it enters play after the first turn has already began even though the wording is "Starts the game with..."  
---
There are already several heroes that win the early game with big stat bonuses. Amalgam + Rockpool Hunter gives you 9 stats on the board. Rat King can give you 7 with an extra gold with Cats. Even with the Totem being a 2/2 on turn 1, you still lose/tie to some Hero Power/Minion combinations.
---
She's hard to use well.
---
I like to double-buy on turn 2. Turn 3: upgrade + buy.
---
You really have to use the power every turn and spend the coins fast. BUT. You can get a board that protects your health and start to level your tavern. It's aggressive.
---
Even so, life gets really thin so I usually stop using the power around 20 health. I try not to put myself below 10 b/c a couple bad rolls will kill you.
---
I would think of her as hard to play, rather than bad. If you put yourself at 22, you've gotten 6 extra mana which is more than Bartendotron gets, but you get it in the early-early game so you're taking less combat damage.
---
This photo is a perfect example of what the playstyle can do if your buys come together.

Thank you very much!

Would fire mage Jaina art be better?
---
Don’t blame them, it’s spam .
---
Why should a game competition be littered with political spam
---
Do I smell a yoink?
---
I made the same deck but with shadow visions instead of shield.
---
I shit you not this game mode runs better on my little Samsung 8 or whatever cellphone than it does on my Ryzen 5 3600, 1080ti, and wired internet...
---
I literally gave up and curled up on my couch to play on my phone instead and I even won my last match after a couple top fours!
---
Everything pretty balanced besides Jaina SHES too broken
---
I am Playing on iPhone 6s as well and the game is nigh unplayable
---
There is definitely no 'ok done' sent from the client. I was mid game yesterday when my internet cut out so I switched to my mobile.. made it to the final 2 and I beat him but didn't kill him, but the animations took so long that I had literally 4 seconds in the tavern, which was exactly enough time to buy one minion and sell one minion... So my board was just weaker than before the turn before.
---
I could imagine that maybe time is calculated by the number of actions performed * x seconds, but regardless if your mobile hardware isn't great your animation speed is much slower and it definitely eats into your tavern time
---
tapping/clicking on cards can skip the animations. If they skip them and you let them play out, it seems like they're cheating the timer.
---
It's the cards from your previous opponent.  If they had cards in their hand, they still show up the next time you see Bob.
---
Yeah, super slow animations, that was accepted cause turns in play mode by standard take 75 seconds, but now in battlegrounds every turn takes less time, and you have to think about your next move, so it's impossible to keep up with the turn time. The animations are obviously made for being acted by computers, and It results that in mobile even scrolling the collection is frustrating.
---
Wealth, paying for hearthstone and PC/phone equipment correlate way less clearly than you presume.of course, if you're super poor, being awake in hearthstone and having a good PC and phone is impossible. But once but other than that,
---
I play on iphone X and my tavern times are so long I get bored to death inbetween rounds, even when taking time to think through possibilities. I don't experience any of the things other people describe here, except for that you can't interact with the board if your hand is open.
---
I'm asking pro, what is the better option there? WTWD *what toast would do*
---
Buffs during combat don't stick, so it would basically just be a 2/2.
---
When you two star it, it gives +4/+4
---
There is almost no punishment in this game for early greedy play other than turn 3 afk and/or missing one of the main units listed.
---
 
---
Most players are wasting coins going for triples. I have played a lot myself and I almost always end up in Top 4 unless I miss all the big units and/or I am up against an extremely lucky player, I do skate by with extremely low health but I usually turn it around.
---
But the battlecry would do nothing.
---
There's a nifty program players are using to do just that SP Blizz will ban them.
---
For real though, this situation is a no win situation for Blizz. Either they allow us to skip/remove animations, something they've refused to do for over 5 years, or they effectively announce they're okay with their players having a sub optimal experience.
---
That's. Not. Faceless.
---
For 0 extra RNG?
---
Imho the biggest flaw is the no overlap between synergy pools except for Amalgam that’s way too good. Other Auto battlers usually have 2-3 "tribes" on their cards and it becomes interesting to mix and match the synergies you can get in combination with scouting what others might compete on. In Battlegrounds you just force whatever tribe you get a good card first. Competition barely matters since there aren’t enough variations to winning decks and you can’t scout.
---
Thanks for the guide. Very useful. Out of interest, how many hours a day do you have to play to get to rank 1?
---
Patches the Pirate: Fire the Cannons!
---
Figure it yourself mate, it’s not that complicated given the thread you’re talking in
---
What makes Yogg so good? I only use it in the early game when I'm looking for stats. I rarely take a chance in the late game for it to hit the card I want.
---
If that makes you feel any better :)
---
If you always end up top 4 you should climb to a rank that'll prove me right.
---
Getting a early Brann and using a bunch of cards with battlecry buffs is a good way of getting a giant Amalgam. Get a lightfang enforcer aswell and its gg
---
That's because the game already knows the results of all the values the instant the players enter combat. If your device is able to open and respect you to the game reliably quickly then it's actually better to just quit the battle as soon as you have some scouting info.
---
Yeah, totally agree. Ultimately it reflects how they perform for the average player.
---
And for now I lack data for high MMR players, but if enough of them start using the app I should be able to build something :)
---
Tbh quest jade shaman is a tier 3 deck at best if not 4, way to slow to deal with the meta decks (rank 6-1 is filled with secret mage, paladin and snip lock), if your purpose is to climb I would switch to another deck but if you want to make it to 5 I would consider adding tech cards like eater of secrets, devolve and hex, not sure what to add for Mecha’thun so I guess that’ll be a lost matchup since you can’t pressure him fast enough and snip lock cycles way too fast, they can Mecha’thun you on turn 10 most of the time
---
Definitely :)
---
But it still shows the impact of a single element (the hero power) on the shared card pool, which I think is pretty interesting.
---
But you can fix the truely broken deck by nerfing Snip-snap to say cannot be reduced below 1 cost. Or an overall effect to Echo, or just gutting Echo+Magnetic.
---
You don't have to nuke all Mech decks to nerf a snipsnap combo.
---
In my experience, freezing for any tier 1 unit ends in failure
---
You can afford to burn coins on buffy characters you aren't gonna keep as 2 coins -1 coin for selling immediately after using buff = 1 coin, it's just a matter of inventory management.
---
I've seen ridiculously buffed Sarons almost as much as Rat Kings.
---
I've only been playing it recently for arena and even that seems to have had a crazy powerspike in all the decks to the point a 78+ rated deck like 8 months ago would be around a 65~ rating now
---
I'll probably just find something else to play tbh
---
I would disagree. In this specific context, her hero power doesn't mean as much as you think it does. Mechs are so overwhelmingly good, that the hero power DOESNT matter. This is further proved by how often Mechs win with literally any other hero.  
---
Her hero power just pushes you to try and force a mech board (Which isn't hard to do anyway).
---
Oh wow good board! Next...
---
Yeah I think the main problem with Jaina is that HS Battlegrounds doesn't have 'perfect information'.
---
In all other 'auto battlers', you can always check exactly what each other player is fielding and what cards they are holding on their bench. This currently isn't possible in HS:BG.
---
I think Blizz would need to fix this information gap before they could start thinking about Heroes like Jaina.
---
What's your MMR?
---
BOB Clap
---
Its the new mode battlegrounds. Pretty fun so far and free to play you should definitely try it out.
---
I got the second place, the last guy was so lucky and got a lot of snipes. 
---
btw this is 6200 MMR
---
Yup. Nightmare Amalgam has ridiculously good scaling, but that scaling relies on you surviving. Less stats means you have a harder time surviving. The nerf is far more elegant than its simplicity implies.
---
Mechs are a better end-game comp.
---
Biggest surprise to me is seeing George so low, personally have been rather successful with him.
---
&gt; saying mechwarper isnt a problem
---
It's true though, echo having the postential to be at 10 mana is the problem, a card you can play and infinite of time is and always will be a problem. Same with sound the bells in kind of dumb too when you get the infinite combo, or evolution
---
Thanks!
---
what about prep, coin?
---
I think starting the game with tribes was a terrible idea overall. 
---
Every game just devolves into players being funneled into the same 4 tribe pathways. Theres no cards that neutrally buff things, so you're forced to pick these tribes if you want to have big enough minions to contend in the mid to late game. If in the first few turns you havent got some of the power cards from each tribe (Cobalt Guardian / Junkbot, Rat Pack / Hyena) you will very quickly fall behind and lose, with no way of swinging the game. The games you lose don't even feel like you could have done anything differently, as its down to RNG to give you the useful cards that you need to start immediately buffing, and sometimes you can re-roll 4 or 5 times and only get minions that have no synergy whatsoever with your board. This just plain feels terrible to happen to you. Cards like Wrath Weaver, Metaltooth Leaper and Overseer in the early game are too specific to their tribe, and we need normal buffing cards to help players with non-synergistic boards fight back.

I'll show but you go first.  I've done dozens of trades on here with no problems.  Search my name and battletag on this thread if you're unsure.
---
wow this doesnt explain at all whats going on here, without the context that its a new game mode
---
At this point, it is best if wait and see the effect Descent of Dragons ultimately has on Standard generally before really diving into potential card changes. Much of the strength of decks like Quest Shaman (Lifedrinker, Former Champ, Shudderwock) are also rotating out in April.
---
Even then, what Hero cards are causing problems in Standard ever since the nerf to Dr. Boom, Mad Genius? If it's Zul'jin, well, that card's more similar to the likes of Yogg Saron, Tess, and Shudderwock than Frost Lick Jaina, Deathstalker Rexxar, and  Shadowreaver Andiun.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought when I saw it.
---
But since all heroes are exactly the same apart from the hero power, doesn't the difference in winrate between heroes indicate how much effect the hero power has?
---
Dude I haven't seen that in ages. I gotta rewatch it soon.
---
Maybe in the first few turns, but later on there *might* be a scenario where you want to wait with purchasing a minion.
---
A few I can think of: You don't want to buy anything because you want to buff the minion(s) with Deryl's hero power next turn
---
You don't want to automaticly make a golden minion because you want to upgrade your Tavern before playing it, and making the golden minion would 'eat' 2 minions on your board.
---
Oof, triple Mal'Ganis is a game changer for sure
---
That's how I feel for a lot of the heros and card backs. I was thinking it would be nice if Blizzard gave everyone a free hero and card back unlock of our choice.
---
Those *are* clouds behind her.
---
Don't worry this is just the start to the guide, I'm going to to add the more detailed stuff next.
---
Next time maybe restart the game before queuing up? 🤔
---
A super quick meta would probably push it down for example, or if a fast combo emerges. DH lock would shit on current sn1p lock if it was a tad bit more consistent.
---
On the other hand, sn1p lock might very well get some more tools and get stronger (or be strong enought to keep going as it is), there is no way to know without waiting.
---
So I just tried something like "consider only the top 4 of each game, then run the same stats". Is this a good enough way to do it?
---
In this scenario, the top 6 are:  
---
* Manastorm
---
* Mukla
---
* A. F. Kay
---
* Rat King
---
* Yogg
---
* Nefarian 
---
So Nefarian is a bit better in this situation, but not enough to overcome the stronger starts from the other heroes
---
Yeah it's super solid. One of the easier strats to pull off too!
---
There's some strategy, though the odds of you getting all 6 of a key piece of somebody else's strategy before they get one copy, as well as having a strong board yourself sounds like a lot of effort.
---
I seem to have forgotten to add ‘the next minion you buy’
---
I hate that the change is just starting stats. Those rarely matter when every game ends up with giant, taunted, divine shield, poisonous Amalgams. So many battles boil down to “did my biggest thing get killed by it?”
---
When the level 3 and 4 minions you get are strong AFK is in very good shape. When you only get crap tier minions it will be a short round
---
That realism. Have you considered a career as an artist?
---
This is a great point. People don’t value small buffs and nerds enough in this mode
---
One Poison Seeds might do the trick :)
---
i had no idea about the shared pool thing
---
Never heard any streamer stress the wrong syllable
---
Its not a made up definition... It IS the definition. Just that it doesnt match your views doesnt mean its false.
---
Priest seems the most broken, followed closly by mage, then hunter and rogue are tied. the rest are fine
---
&gt; sounds pretty damn good to me.
---
Because u are a really fuking bad player, thats why.
---
Blood imp sucks and its a horrible card. Just like "taunt" warlock is a horrible deck. You losing to it doesnt mean shit. Get over it dude, holy shit.
---
Zerus is pretty underrated.  Now you obviously shouldn't just be grabbing Zerus all the time, but when the choice is a marginal upgrade, re-rolling without enough to buy something, or Zerus; Zerus can be the choice.  Zerus has an 11% chance to become a random 6 drop and a 16% chance to become a random 5 drop.  Not all of those are good,  but a 1 in 4 shot a 5/6 isn't too bad.
---
Its been nearly 6 months since they told us they'd be 'keeping an eye on' wild snipsnap. It's been[4 months since I voiced my frustrations](https://www.reddit.com/r/wildhearthstone/comments/cf1gta/sn1psn4p_is_a_failure_for_wild_im_unhappy/) over on wildhearthstone's subreddit. It's been 2 months since the ban reversal. It's nearly a month since blizcon and silence on sniplock.
---
The saddest part? people are still cheating and the soonest I'd expect any change is early december, when they're releasing Descent of Dragons. Even then, I doubt they've got the sniplock nerf ready, we'd surely have had communication on it.
---
I can't recommend pre ordering this cycle. Battlegrounds is fun, but the rest of the game, wild and standard, has been allowed to flounder.
---
What does that even have to do with anything I wrote?
---
The economics of a game, especially one as high profile as Hearthstone, do quite often have to take priority over the artistry .
---
If no one or not enough people are paying for the game, the game dies.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
Beaming Sidekick being a minion with actual stats that can target another minion to give extra health to at a rate it takes Blood Imp two turns to do must completely blow your mind if Blood Imp is honestly "pretty damn good."
---
If it's so good, why don't you recreate this "Taunt" Warlock deck and hit top one hundred legend for use plebs?
---
Oh Bob, I bet you say that to all the girls
---
Haha, why wouldn't Blizzard find another way to entice people to preorder? I'd be surprised if they didn't.
---
People have been asking for smaller storage requirements for Hearthstone on mobile, this is how we do it
---
intuitive meaning the players are aware thats how it works. The game doesn't tell you and its not apparent at all. I only know because of a reddit post. That's 100% non-intuitive.
---
I play on an Ipad 2018 and it lags horribly. I don't think that it's an Android vs iOS thing. I don't think that iPad OS should lead to a significantly worse performance than iOS.
---
Definitely a great idea for tribe hybrids. Would be much more interesting than just stacking amalgams
---
I completely agree with you! But there is another point: we need a clear for mage
---
Honestly it’s just the Brann placed badly. You want the poisonous dude’s to kill any enemy poisonous dudes ASAP because after that the big bois can just soak up any normal attack dmg.
---
* Tier 2 on 4 mana
---
* Tier 3 on 7 mana
---
* Tier 4 on 10 mana 
---
But this can vary depending on your hero and the current situation (Eg.: Do you have a very strong early board ? then you can probably get away with an early upgrade)
---
The main question about upgrading tier is - Can you do it without falling too much behind on board ?
---
Oooh cool
---
I have some more examples here: https://imgur.com/gallery/1asFhdq

Dave504, 2019
---
That would be an amazing addition to the game
---
Foe Reaver?
---
No, the data we showed is Blood imp. This entire argment is blood imp, not tar creeper alone. Lmao, that dekc you linked doesnt even play blood imp... 
---
Like, dont you see the irony? You proved yourself wrong.
---
My tavern still broken. 
---
Dear Blizzard, you suck.
---
Jaina wayyyyyyyyy too op. I like the gul dan HP
---
You said that tar creeper is only played in rank 25 meme decks so take that L.
---
You're wrong, deal with it.
---
Yes had a game exactly like this yesterday too. Not that hard to get to 1 hp with your hero power and it doesnt matter if your at 6 or 1 Health.
---
I mean. With amalgam, brann, and lightfang enforcer, tribeless is not only very much a thing but can pretty easily win some games. The existing 6 stars are also pretty solid, even the tribeless ones (you don’t really run most of the 6 stars for the tribes anyways, you run them for their abilitiies.)
---
The problem with adding hybrids is that hybrids take up a LOT of minion slots.  You can only have so many minions of each star value, or else it's unrealistic to make triples.
---
I do agree that amalgam is OP and (more importantly) boring, but this might be too much fluff.
---
Cobalt can do alright against Nef if you position it well as it can reshield. But in general I think that's the point of the hero powers. They each make the game a little unfair in specific circumstances. You just have to play around it as best you can.
---
You're nuts and I love it, good luck
---
Blizzard may have made a mistake giving it to us for free. Even with the battle grounds pack bonuses I don't feel compelled to preorder this expansion. But it is still "Beta" so I imagine they are gonna find a different way to monetize.
---
OH GOD NO NOT THE HELLOS AGAIN
---
Thanks for the explanation, makes sense! Im just super excited, and as someone who is not impressed with Battlegrounds, I cant wait for the new expansion.
---
Someone on /r/dataisbeautiful once wrote a post about the optimal posting time based on reddit users being online all around the world, which seems like it would be an important part of circlejerk karma farming.
---
Makes you question all these high mmr players.
---
Why?
---
I mean I think life drinker is fine. It could be used in any deck because it's a jack of all trades. But its not used in every deck since it isnt the best. In fact I think zilliax is more of a problem.
---
You doubt the power of murloc engineering?
---
That was ridiculous... I love it lol
---
WE NEED THIS
---
The card is terrible in Control decks, because in lots of matchups you don't care about face damage. That's the "downside". Why would you play it over Earthen Ring Farseer, which is 1 mana cheaper, and it's already a bad card in Control? There's no popular Control build that runs it, for a reason.
---
And yeah, it's a solid Aggro card, but it's not broken in any way IMO. It's only really good in the decks that can get something extra out of it - like Quest Shaman (double Battlecry, gets in Shudderwock pool) or Tempo Rogue (bounce cards, Spirit of the Shark in some builds). Those are basically the only two decks using the card right now. 
---
It was never a problem card throughout its stay in Standard. And it rotates out in ~3 weeks...
---
Pretty integral component in all these shaman decks isn't it?
---
I tried to make a death rattle priest so that I could get Majordomo on the board, kill him, and set my Rag Health to 40. Unfortunately, it almost impossible to get him out early enough.
---
I won my first game. This was game 2 trying to finish a play quest.
---
Faced the same problem in another game, and is also AFK. (She can really be AFK LUL)
---
I hope they keep doing the early access. I dont want to waste dust on release day for overhyped cards which then wont see any play a week later. Without these early access streams, its really hard to make educated crafting choices. While experimenting is fun and all, not everyone has enough dust to do that.
---
Just the one copy that your blast.
---
&gt;What the fuck does this have to do with anything being discussed?
---
And yet the only deck playing it consistently is Quest Shaman since it can be a Fireball, Holy Light, and a 3/3 all wrapped into one for six in that deck and that deck alone.
---
Control generally wants cards that can control the board better on turns four and five like Bone Wraith and Zilliax.
---
Aggro generally wants cards that have more impact on the board than a 3/3 for four like Murloc Warleader and say Hench Clan Burgler.
---
&gt; The more I think on it, the more I realize I just can't get behind any sort of 'chart' around the hero win rates, when the hero selection is left up to chance, you know? Its just impossible to prove one way or another.
---
But.....it's not. Random chance on its own does not mean something cannot be evaluated, which is why we have such large sample sizes. By your logic, it would be pointless to study or research anything since there's an element of chance in all aspects of life.
---
yes priest confirmed
---
Relative to the rest of the format, it really isn't.
---
Granted, I don't know what else I would expect from someone who's having trouble dealing with a Blood Imp in a deck already playing board sweepers.
---
“Heal with no downside” yea playing a 4 cost 3/3 would be a downside. It’s just a decent card idk how it’s a problem...
---
3 Coins is what you spend to hire a minion anyways, so not really losing out here. It is also a permanent buff, while Uther is a temporary buff at the start of combat, so you would have to keep paying to reapply the 10 health.
---
Breaking into Tier 6 early can win you the game by itself with having Mama Bear or Deathrattle snakes.
---
I would agree. At the very least it would be nice to see how many of each minion is in the pool when you hover over them in the Tavern.
---
Pretty sure that's the entire point of the post. Drop Amalgam and replace it with hybrids like the example in the picture.
---
Dont need goldrinn, two mama bears are busted. If you add to that the worgen that gives 3 attack on summon and a rat pack with a decent amount of health you pretty much insta win
---
Yes
---
dont think i want to spend 4 turns at lvl 1, just to get a 2 star after
---
You didnt specify what format, holy shit you're arrogant as fuck lmao.
---
Amalgam should be removed. The End. Make Cobalt a T4. Make Junk a T5. Introduce more Murlocs. Introduce more Demons. Dilute the  pool.
---
I think Amalgam just needs to go up a tavern tier level.
---
&gt;why make five minions to do Amalgam’s job worse when you could just nerf Amalgam and be done with it?
---
Turns out late game is about superbuffed minions and Mama Bear comes too late if you don't get it from discover. Might be correct sometimes, but will hardly 'win you the game by itself'.
---
MMR is not an average reflection of game results due to it's current setup. At a certain point, you're only gaining a couple points for a 4th place win. It doesn't matter if he got 4th in every single game he played with this method, it would take him years to climb to the top only getting 1-5 points a match.
---
"The *Horde* had *dragons*, *we* had the *gryphons*. *We won* that *war*. - Ilsa Blusterbrew"
---
SweetDaddy is quite the battlenet tag
---
You do realize that the number of minions in the pool is in the high hundreds, so it is impossible to perfectly trim the pool? While I agree that some information component would make the ability more clear, like showing all players what Jaina blasts when she does it, there is no way it is consistent enough to regularly have a huge negative impact on everyone else in the game.
---
I did as well 5days ago https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvqwz3/dual_tribe_minions_will_add_new_strategies_to/
---
If people aren't talking about it, it's almost certainly not actually a problem card.
---
But it's really fun trying to understand how to play them :)
---
You’re definitely right, I guess I was thinking of the dev intentions when making the post. I suppose it’s not a huge issue, just thought it was worth pointing out :)
---
As are most of the five stars to be honest. The cards that really determine the winner are the buff cards along with the amalgam that can receive all buffs.
---
How many games have you actually lost because you're opponent dropped a Nozdormu and your screwed up your play sequence?
---
That free gold coin is insane. If you started winning you could just snowball away from everyone, leveling up before other players without any penalty. It's especially swingy if you're up against AFKay in the first two rounds.
---
None.
---
Bobs favoritism
---
This is true. As it stands you can slam an amalgam turn 3 with whatever else you had and you'll probably win the next fight cause 3/4 stats are pretty impactful in those early fights
---
It's pretty much the best Murloc.
---
What if it were to remove a random minion from the pool?
---
Well, no wonder you're having trouble with this game then.
---
From what I heard this is just a visual glitch so your MMR is safe friend :)
---
I think the concept of having hybrids is great, but I don’t think they would be great unless there were multiple cards of one hybrid type. The reason amalgams are strong in BG is because you can magnetize to them, buff them with most cards, and(most importantly) give them poisonous. Hybrids would not get all the benefits that amalgams do, so a basic hybrid the one you made for this post would not be strong on its own. 
---
Additionally, singular type comps would probably just have better minions and a more central focus, so hybrids would need really strong effects to be chosen over traditional minions used in comps.
---
Also, in regards to the minion Bear Gills, the players should not be able to interact during the battle phase, so adapt is not good keyword to use. Blizzard is also not printing anymore cards with that keyword. 
---
A fix to the problem stated above is to create custom options; for example: gain divine shield, +2 attack, poisonous, or +2 health. Because the minion effect will activate whenever any minion dies, it is much more powerful than cards like junkbot and scavenging hyena, so I separated the stat buffs into 2 options.
---
I sometimes do it just so that other people can't get more amalgams.
---
Because yes.
---
&gt;[In addition, this Tavern Brawl was something that players needed to buy into and offered rewards that some players have been unable to claim. **This isn’t OK and we intend to make it right for players.** Stay tuned for more details soon!](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dwi3fv/tavern_brawl_update/)
---
You're right buddy I see pros play all the time and they just chuck the cards out left and right boom boom boom done ez.
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
The data I gathered simply consists of the final place of each hero. I don't extract the picking options.
---
What kind of info would you like to see? The db is not publicly accessible, but I could extract some stuff
---
&gt;Rather than building hype and excitement it kind of dimishes both of those qualities.  
---
agreed. i don't know why some people seem so convinced pre-release streams are increasing sales. they could just as easily be doing the opposite.  
---
&gt;a horde of streamers have already had plenty of time to try out all the new cards and essentially solve the new meta  
---
complete fiction. you are learning absolutely nothing about how strong any deck is by watching streamers playing against each other in a closed server. hsreplay data is what will solve the meta within 24 hours of expansion release regardless of whether there are pre-release streams or not.
---
If they would combine that means other golden cards would be able to combine with regular cards too, which doesn't really make sense in the game.
---
Then obviously the card isn't an issue, and the complete flavor win of the card is worth whatever relatively minor breaking of games rules the card deos.
---
Had a very similar one except it was triple Alleycat. Imagine my happiness sink all the way down to disappointment when I found I wouldn’t get a triple Tabbycat &gt;:(
---
I've seen a lot of balancing complaints, and that's expected for a beta test, but am I alone in thinking the game isn't as unbalanced as a lot of people seem to think? I mean amalgam is definitely strong, but I don't stress in a game if it never drops. Just have to work a new plan, sometimes make a hybrid board yourself with two types. I dunno, just seems like people are having trouble picking up the nuances of the game and think amalgam is OP because it doesn't require any thinking or planning. I mean it is, but that's not necessarily game breaking.
---
Or shaman weapon.
---
That's highly debatable, but the doc said to come back in 3 months so apparently I'm passably sufficient for the time being.
---
\**rimshot, twitch, stomach noises\**
---
Every battleground is an illusion of choice: do I go mech or not?
---
This kind of just makes it worse. Fewer to choose from means the people that do get them basically auto win in games of any noticeable length. It also further punishes heros that have powers that are well used early game like Daryl.
---
Almost certainly junkbot, security rover, cobalt guardian, amalgam. The two magnetize mechs likely just as popular but, well. Not visibly distinct by then
---
Yes, I meant my turns that I actually get have no standard between 0 and 120 seconds, though they do tend to be 20 seconds or less.
---
Because you're playing against real people that wasted their time thinking it was a real match and setting up.  
---
If it's a quest for a class you don't like why not just wait a day and exchange it?
---
I'm not the one that can't think of a move in 15 seconds 🤷‍♂️
---
fuck you!
---
Yeah cause submarines dont exist
---
Dang, I don't check every post on reddit everyday.
---
If I missed your linked post (I did), I guess I just didn't need to know!
---
nice!
---
Its a shared minion pool for everyone,  so it goes both ways
---
Exactly if I get unlucky and they get lucky I'm not given shit? It should be the same chances for everyone
---
thats how pool works in this kind of games, league of legends teamfight tactics, auto chess, etc. So thats not unfair in any way bcs thats how the game is.
---
[Is that a Tin Can ~~Hitman~~ Hitmurloc?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQThpgkWJ6M)

Think he means nefarian. He was streaming saying that the fact it popped divine shields made a demon comp competitive
---
It is, from the same pool...
---
&gt;  ~~the average man~~ a small group of loud, whiny entitled assholes
---
FTFY
---
Amalgam should realistically be nerfed to tier 3 (maybe even 4).
---
After seeing more into your submisions here, I really really suggest you to leave reddit for a while.
---
Staying here isnt making you happier at all. Its just making your struggle worse. This people dont need to die, if you simply dont connect to reddit its basically as if they dont exist, and for you both situations are practically the same.
---
So, instead of asking them to kill themselves, better leave this damned place and seek happiness in other place, at least for some time. Have a nice day.
---
It would become a real life card, using your phone as materials. So yeah, one time use only.
---
Edit: unless?
---
Vegan math
---
Threshadon seems like pure tavern filler to me. He's a beast, but spawning murlocs doesn't synergize with beasts in the slightest. He spawns murlocs, but a beast spawning a bunch of 1/1 murlocs doesn't synergize with the battleground murloc strategy.
---
Nice!
---
Ah, I was thinking that Jaina’s Hero Power meant that the card would no longer be offered to you.
---
You're given what's left,  so you do get shit
---
Because I A) this small indie company cant fix tavern brawl B) 10 Deathrattle is far less fun C) Murlocs
---
Everybody here is ignoring this. Take my upvote. I agree but nozdormu is still not the worst for any meta
---
I always like to ask people like you, what is an example of a deck that you think isn’t “braindead”?
---
Sorry, I posted that card in customhearthstone Around the same actually.
---
Sure sure
---
Lettuce King
---
Definitely a little high-roll but I was thinking along this vein.
---
Grats! Now aim higher haha
---
it’s not unplayable atleast. 90% shamans but many lose if you can survive the onslaught
---
hmm why get rid of poison if super buffing will stay a thing? I think thats more of a problem that takes away from other viable strats.
---

Lol I'm just dumb not malicious. I do my tavern stuff and alt-tab to dwarf fortress so I didn't even realize what had happened right away.
---
I believe is lettuce king but he may have changed it again.
---
I love seeing funny bugs come up like this. That playing the new pokemon game on a Switch on the same network as a roku tv can make the tv go into a restart loop is hilarious. What crazy things are happening to make these things happen? haha
---
Not buy, obtain, FTFY.
---
well bg is still in an early phase.  
---
they have enough options to create new cards, especially hybrids.  
---
like we already have one (not really but still) in form of mecha jaraxxus, who doesnt know which 2 tribes he would be defenitly didnt played for enough time and should not read this anyway.
---
Did you get the divine shield as well?
---
Prepare to face the secret final boss
---
There are no "meta" decks 2 hours after launch. It takes time to refine a theorycraft into something that actually works. People will be copying what the streamers are doing 2 hours into the expansion, sure, but the meta won't settle for a couple of days afterwards. There's just no point in brewing a deck if the meta has already been solved by the time you get to open your first pack.
---
two normal amalgyms &gt; one upgraded one
---
No it doesnt activate at all, it shows the hero power icon at the bottom as if it was never activated and then they dont gain the death rattle
---
Other than Vulgar Homonculus and the guy who gets stats for summoning demons, what else deals damage to you? 
---
I've won with demons twice when I play them and at most I get a golden homunculus. I've never used the neutral minion. I've just won with the absurdly high stats demons can obtain and the guy who deals dmg when your demons die.
---
I have allmost same first places and same 4 or better places compared to kripp but he have 6800 with that, and i only lost points in like 8 games, dont think thats fair
---
You've lost more in between. The system is not biased towards anyone.
---
Taunting the junk bot seems like a misplay, although I guess it plays around zappy boi. Then again from the looks of it you might not even need the junk bot. Overall good board, I approve.
---
Hey CrimpingMadness, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
He’s at like 6700 MMR
---
Hell yeah! Keep them, both are used and both are fun!
---
I have never played a single Battlegrounds match but I can't help laughing when I see A. F. Key is a top tier in something
---
Yeah. Blizzard doesn't care about the mid-expansion lulls so much, they've started to have events like Rise of Mech and Doom in the Tomb, both of which provided player with quite a bit of value, shook up Standard, and came with like five or so packs worth of stuff over the course of a couple days.
---
&gt; has not once has
---
Does it turn into a golden random???
---
Kurgan#1785 NA, Trading 80G quest. Please show or go first. Fine with Wild or Standard.
---
What sort of decks are they used in then? The same as when they were in Standard?
---
