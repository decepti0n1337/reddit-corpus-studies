What in tarnation
---
Or maybe Hearthstone is just a casual game, they never intended it to be bigger than that and some of us didn't really realized it sooner.
---
People who want a casual game picked the right game, people who want to go further picked the wrong one.
---
I just beat it. It took a bit of luck, but what I remember is:
---
Animal companion was really good
---
Saurolisk is the best card, 8/8 troll second best.
---
IIRC I mostly went beast synergy, with rush and charge cards being rated highest among those.
---
You can still do a lot of other things with it - Taunt it up with Sunfury Protector/Argent Defender, use it as a sacrifice for cards (mainly Warlock) that destroy a minion for their effect. These are less snowbally though and I can see how taking advantage of that would be considered skillful play (and with the latter point - Odd Warlock viable when?), I'm just leery of any implementation of Genn/Baku which gives them some *additional* benefit even if their primary effect becomes less consistent.
---
Deck list? I've got a homebrew casino mage but could probably use another variation
---
I'd rather they invested that time into something else. Shame they haven't.
---
that disease gave you hearthstone, the computer youre using to play it, and why youre not standing in line for bread lol
---
F2P BTW
---
To summarize:
---
- Artifact was sold to the public as a "no free cards, and our cards are actually worth something and can be traded/sold on the Steam marketplace". Every digital card was actually worth something, unlike with HS, Shadowverse, and other CCGs.
---
- You needed to pay $20(?) to buy the initial game which gave you tickets for the various modes, and starter decks.
---
The controversy came in when not only did you have to initially pay for the game(no F2P in this game), but you also needed to pay to buy more packs(not unexpected). But in order to play in some of the competitive modes, you needed to spend tickets.
---
And once you're out of tickets that you got from the starter pack, you needed to buy more. The perception was that Valve was gating their content and indeed, your ability to even play some of the game's modes. How this differed from HS' Arena mode, was that at least with HS, you could still slowly gather income through playing the game for free, then pay the gold fee of 150 gold.
---
Artifact didn't offer this, because their model depended paying to play.
---
The initial marketplace resulted in a scenario where some cards were very pricy(not unexpected, despite Valve's assurances of safeguards against outright scalping). Then the market plummeted quickly.
---
The Steam charts showed a mass player exodus from Artifact, all within only the first few weeks of the game's debut.
---
&gt; Even indirect buffs like Sunfury Protector for the Genn shrine is a waste of a potential Taunt effect, considering it would lose any bonuses after reviving.
---
I wouldn't call it a waste, guaranteeing a Sunfury proc even on a subpar body is still great for consistency when putting 3 more health between an aggro deck and your face can make a lot of difference.
---
At this point tournament mode is used to refer to everything Blizzard doesn't do, new game modes, bug fix, actual game balance, etc.
---
I can't win with any of the warrior shrines. Armor shrine dies and leaves me useless, with dragons I get to boss 7 usually then die, due to lack of immediate removal/board inpact, the overkill card seems just bad to me.
---
Same with hero damage druid, which seems to me to be an extremely weak and delayed effect. 
---
I actually wasn't aware of that, but it's good to know as that makes it significantly less polarizing!
---
Long term? Wrong.
---
Hey, I am not arguing with you, was just giving the people a reminder of the person that did what you said would feel bad. 
---
I think you are right. I think it is impossible for someone to go to Blizz and get a good idea of what the new cards will/won't do. Regis and Lifecoach are great examples of the extremes, but in the end. Both could be just as wrong with their initial reactions. I love watching Regis, think he's a swell guy. I would probably be excited as well if I got to play with some new cards. But once the meta actually rolls out, that's when we can see if its a yay or bust.
---
But his fans knew he was going to the Blizzard summit. It would be pretty dumb to just not say anything about it. And he's not a "yes man" either. 
---
No golden portrait. 
---
Why would people be choosing 2 of the most expensive meta decks if dust scarcity was an issue?  There's a dozen equal or better decks for less dust than either of those.
---
Unplayable goldens are the best!! They become playable with the press of a button (well two to be exact - disenchant -&gt; craft) ;)
---
*plays yogg*
---
Yogg: no
---
at least he can disenchant them for a legendary each without second thoughts on if he should keep them
---
Hahaha! I had the same thing. 
---
I just played a round against the secret Hunter, that Freezing Trapped my Keleseth, and then I got Mistcaller out, so +9/+9. Was pretty nuts.
---
Ohhh! Genius!
---
that would cripple it worse than what OP suggested 
---
Warrior sucks ass

2 crystallizers is still 5 armor
---
No you can buff them infinitely.
---
Glinda (1) + Mechwarper (2) + Mechwarper (3) + Mechwarper (4) + Mechwarper (5) + Mechwarper (6).
---
Now, you have 1 more slot for minions. Because Zilliax is free due to the 5x Mechwarpers and has magnetic, you can play Zilliax for free and magnetic it onto one of the Mechwarpers. You now get another free Zilliax, during to magnetic.
---
Then the Rogue steals your minions at 2 mana discount, easy loss. I beat turn 2 Kele like that, easiest win in the brawl.
---
You see it's really simple. First I play Barnes and summon, the Blood of the Ancient One. Then I use shadowstep to bring him back into my hand to play him and summon another Blood of the Ancient One. Then I end my turn and I summon THE üÖ±Ô∏èNCIENT ONE. 
---
You won‚Äôt have the option to purchase on the b.net shop, if you already purchased 
---
Its bad
---
Try playing against a mage. They got Ice Block, Reno, board clears for days. I'm surprised if Zuljin has even 15% winrate against Mage.
---
Honestly I'm tired of catering to new players. What about the players who have stuck with the game for 5+ years?

Imo lich king I run it in my even shaman and he's been wonderful

Play mage
---
it could become a big taunt, but I guess buff pali could use ALL the help it could get. Might make it viable(lots of the buff spells are even), if only genn worked with quest
---
I don't think you'd run any of those in Wild Even.  Turn 8 is about 2 turns after you've already won the game.
---
Yes it is. Tied for worst with Priest.
---
3 mana 5/5 OpieOP
---
Warrior is the worst shrine in the brawl. 
---
Drawing with replacement.
---
&gt;  the best you can get is 10/8 by playing 2 Crystallizers
---
No you cant. You'll get a 5/8 that way.
---
THE DANCIENT ONE
---
Rogue is the RNG pick this time. It can be the best shrine in the game, or the worst.

and everyone tech'ed in [[skulking geist]] and weapon removal just to counter 1-2 different decks.
---
Got gold harbringer for my free Lego was super disappointed
---
Which is almost a shame because stage 2 was actually fun, like really fun. Turtle rock actually tried to make Evolve good and was doing ok at it until it got axed. Huge lesson to learn there about over monetizing a game and focusing on profit over fun
---
By my math, not very high,
---
I agree... I have it in my tesspionage and I actually find it very helpful a lot of the time tbh
---
The odds of Unexpected Results with +7 spellpower summoning 2 blood of the ancient ones is 1295:1
---
Holy fuck
---
Which is not all that tiny of a chance. 
---
also i disagree with your last paragraph about ‚Äúthought degradation‚Äù. I, and most others are perfectly capable of laughing at memes while retaining our ability to ‚Äúconvey unique value through words‚Äù
---
I've seen one other person post something like this before: ever. So you're still "golden." ;)
---
I disagree. I dusted some cards to make a good deck that I could climb the ladder with that wasn't gonna go away for at least a few months so I could at least enjoy that side of the game while still playing casual and trying different stuff out and expanding  my collection on the side. I am pretty sure if I hadn't done that then I would have lost interest in the game because I wouldnt have had at least one reliable deck I know that I can always play whenever I want.
---
Patches was OP as a free 1/1, I'm pretty sure a free 0/6-0/10 as you suggest would be even better than that.
---
Better :
---
Run Witch's Cauldron then get an unstable evolution into the Temporus then bounce it.  Sounds too easy.
---
No offense to RDU, but after the whole Artifact debacle where every streamers was like "DIS IS THE BEST GAME EVAR BUT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT", I put zero stock in what insiders say.
---
It‚Äôs nice of you to offer solutions, and I‚Äôm glad it worked out for the other user. In my case, however, I do not use a pi-hole, and the issue persists irrespective of whichever network I‚Äôm connected to. I did a little more testing to try and figure out what‚Äôs going on and it seems like the issue is somehow related to Cellular Data and Wi-Fi. 
---
If I disconnect for a moment from a Wi-Fi network, then my phone switches to using Cellular Data. However, irrespective of whether the network connection is regained within a few seconds or not, this seems to completely throw off the app and mandates the reboot. However, when I tested on my home network in single player with Cellular Data turned off, you can be disconnected from the network entirely, but upon regaining connection, the old auto reconnect works as expected. Any idea on what‚Äôs up with that? 
---
&gt; And I own it.
---
Technically you don't. You just renting pixels from blizzard with your money.
---
Never seen this in my life
---
Blizzard ties limited time hero portraits exclusively for pre-order bundle purchase.  That is how they get the consumer.  They target a part of the game that is anemic then put it behind a paywall in order to get guaranteed bundle purchases.  I am confident that if there was no King Rastakhan portrait in this past bun
---
dle or Lord Jaraxxus in the expansion before, you would see the pre-purchase sales plummet.

It was safe to dust as soon as they nerfed lifesteal.
---
This rogue shrine was the funnest option in all of RR, and oen of the strongest also.  
---
I plan on keeping it around. I am fairly active and have about 2k gold saved up and 3800 dust so I'm ready for the next expansion. The only legendary I ever pulled that I dusted was Cho and then the next classic legendary I got was Cho again... so I learned my lesson with dusting classic legendaries
---
If you've ever played physical card games, Hearthstone's business model is nothing new, and as long as you can keep yourself to a budget, is hardly predatory.
---
Guldan is really good! Better use him while you can
---
I think Harbinger could be the pick she‚Äôs good with silence synergy too if you‚Äôre good at reading hands you could also use her as a mirror entity for a big minion. I think Nat and Cho are practically the same extra value soft taunt Cho is good later on in the game and Nats good early and decent later on. I think it‚Äôs Harbinger if you have the silence and Nat if not could be ballsy and go Cho but I think Nat is usually the pick.
---
I can't disagree with that!
---
I just forget to put on a better one, my go to is usually the dungeon run one.
---
Remove Benedictus, Surrender to Mad, Talanji, MC. Add Mind Blast x2, Alexstraza, and Primordial Drake x2. Boom..  meta control priest. Enjoy!
---
Battlefield V, Star Wars battle front 2, and anthem beg to differ.

There were variations of token Druid played by streamers with the new Rasta card that turns treants into 5/5s the deck looked fun. I would throw out wild growth though.

That, right there, is a beautiful thing. 
---
If you could buy cards outright, that could possibly be more than just a fair way to acquire them. It would make the game much more interesting and (possibly) rewarding.
---
Been voting with my wallet since Witchwood! I bought every adventure. I pre-ordered every expo from WotOG onward. I stopped after witchwood. I'm unlikely to pay for anything ever again unless there are significant changes.
---
Or you could just pick him because his screen name is BunnyHopper, which is what I did.
---
Never heard of any of the pros since I don't pay attention to HCT.
---
There really needs to be a 'I don't know'  Because I don't, I rarely to never bother to go into that screen to change something i don't see much either way.
---
You're not wrong, of course. But I still believe blizzard's analyst would rather reduce their 'concentration risk' by having 50 people buy 10 packs rather than 1 person doing it all. So, the effect of voting with your wallet as the average Joe blow is still influential
---
what he deserves 
---
I doubt it. I mean, that would take resources that really wouldn't net them a gain. It's already on mobile and PC, and I think they mentioned not too long ago it wouldn't be going to console (pre switch release)
---
&gt; Which bits were hyperbole?
---
"Hearthstone relies on a predatory, addictive reward system instead of providing any value with purchases"
---
1. There is value through purchases.
---
2. Identifying it only as predatory and addictive pretty strongly implies that it succeeds mostly because of vulnerable people. Which is quite the reach.
---
&gt; so that more people become aware of exactly how much of a rip off it is to spend money on Hearthstone.
---
While you said "the rest seemed to be their personal experience," what they're doing here is projecting their personal experience onto everyone else. 
---
&gt; So spending $20+ on a bundle of 30 packs doesn't give you enough to craft 1 legendary.
---
Not said like it's from personal experience, hence why I clarified what the average is, which *is* relevant since he seems to, like I said just now, project his personal experience onto the experiences of others.
---
Averages trump anecdotes.
---
&gt; and the fact that the normal cost of packs is so high, 
---
More hyperbole I clarified in my original comment. Though you can argue it's not hyperbolic when compared to other card games. Yet it's pretty clear why those card games are more generous (read: they're trying to compete with Hearthstone, which is top dog).
---
&gt; The point still stands, however, that even with good luck it is essentially a waste to spend any money on Hearthstone. 
---
More hyperbole and projecting of personal experience onto the experience of others.
---
&gt; This is just "I spent this much money and I feel I got ripped off".
---
If it were, I still commented on it.
---
But there's more to it than that, which is what I also addressed.
---

There is value through purchases.
---
Identifying it only as predatory and addictive pretty strongly implies that it succeeds mostly because of vulnerable people. Which is quite the reach.  
---
Fair enough though I'd only really call the "predatory" part hyperbole as the rest is quite "eye of the beholder" in what constitutes value.  
---
&gt;While you said "the rest seemed to be their personal experience," what they're doing here is projecting their personal experience onto everyone else.

Sharing their opinion I guess - sort of what everyone does every day in this sub.  
---
&gt;More hyperbole I clarified in my original comment. Though you can argue it's not hyperbolic when compared to other card games.  
---
Subjective - I tend to agree, the cost is quite high.  I don't really care what other games cost as this is the game I'm playing and discussing.  
---
They can all be high or higher but this still feels high.  
---
[Insert comment from &lt;= 1 genius pointing out the memeful /s]
---
Serves you both right!
---
The mobile version is riddled with bugs. Let's fix that before we start adding platforms. 
---
PRECISION
---
Not necessarily, especially when it comes to crafting an exciting player experience.
---
Is it really exciting to spend ten whole dollars for one specific card at least relative to spending a roughly equivalent amount, maybe not getting exactly what you want, but getting a couple decent surprises along the way? Sure, that plays into the aspect of collectible design models that makes them most comparable to gambling, but it does also just work.
---
There is a reason why no physical card game maker sells individual cards directly to their consumers. That reason being some cards are just better than others. Cards of the same rarity aught to be priced the same seeing most of them are printed in at least similar numbers. However, the laws of supply and demand dictate that ones people actually want will end up with a higher price than others no one wants.
---
It would end up creating a situation a large portion of Hearthstone's audience would end up being dissatisfied with.
---
P E R F E C T I O N

I mean, if you never change it....then it's yes. Unless you don't know how it works.

That's fine and fair, but some angry fellow came at me saying the idea is literally just shrines and he hated it in single player mode, hence hated my idea too.
---
What's the point of hearthstone on switch when it's already on mobile? The switch wouldn't even be able to play it on the go so you would just be sitting in your house with your switch in handheld mode playing hearthstone.
---
/r/itwasagraveyardgraph 
---
I feel like people in wild (at least the lower ranks) play less serious decks than in standard. As you said, it doesn't completely fix the problem though. 
---
I mentioned in original post on this that dangerous cards are exactly what you're saying - Crazed Alchemist, Topsy-Turvy, Spell Breaker, Stampeding Rhino, etc etc. And before we forget, a steal by Cabal Shadowpriest would be devastating.
---
But many of these are tech options. I was thinking that the whole shrine idea is one which is introduced by the Rastakan Rumble expansion, but Genn/Baku are Witchwood cards. Making them effectively shrines may not be something that Blizzard would be keen on.
---
Announcement should be any day now, not sure what's taking them so long.

Always using the Netherportal Card back. Thats my absolute favorite Card back in the Game ^^

---
why did you feel like this was worth posting?
---
do you have nothing better to do?
---
The real reason is that all the payment providers charge a percentage of the transaction *plus a flat fee*. So receiving small payments is expensive.
---
i just want more quality of life, i could give two shits about my collection as long as i have something playable
---
maybe if it had some condition like bagu/genn/reno
---
&gt;hen you probably want to use them and with your idea you only remove the chance of getting a usable golden card without helping the economy. i
---
That's a good point I've not considered. Thanks for bringing it to my attention. I guess that might just motivate people that just aims for getting they collection completed. However, the idea would be that if you have all common  or rares, you would then receive a random golden, so you would still have your chance on getting that card you own but on golden (similarly to the rule on when you get a legendary: once you have all legendaries you just get a random one).
---
So I'm wrong, because you dont like what I say? Maybe you should be a little bit more careful about the bullshit you spread on the internet! This is Reddit, not your personal safe space. Opinions differ, and if you are a dick about it, someone will call you out for it. Welcome to reality.

Roll for inflation
---
Gruul not cuul in this deck.. you need 2x Deranged Doctor, 2x Charged Devilsaure, 1x Lich King for the 8 cost minions.
---
Same thing for shaman, there are like 2-4 minions that cost less than 4 and most opponents have a full board by that time.

Yes because companies frequently pump more money into things that aren‚Äôt doing well.
---
I've always wanted some kind of bo3 format on ladder. It could be a separate mode too of course.
---
I'm not sold on Specialist on ladder though. With Conquest or LHS, you could change your lineup and your ban strategy to get a significantly different experience. The biggest problem with a ban format is that broken decks are even more broken because they are played in lineups that ban their worst counter.
---
Specialist does the opposite, it has a *polarising* effect and certain decks just auto lose to specific tech cards that everybody can now play in the secondary deck (as opposed to playing tech cards in a normal ladder deck, which comes with the cost that you have to run that cart against opponents where it doesn't help).
---
IMHO that's even worse and it's bad for variety as well. There'd be fewer viable decks or even classes (I mean, all of Druid gets countered by the same thing), and you have fewer different opponents in the same amount of time.
---
FYI if you're interested in how Specialist works out in a ladder like setting, you could look for streamers who play on battleriff, their pro league just restarted and they're using Specialist.

I thought that must be a joke, but no he really said that.

Well they seemed interested and keep asking what kinda game hearthstone is. And I did warn them that it would suck to start a new account. The first few weeks they seemed to really enjoy it. But it goes downhill fast afterwards.
---
This will be the first expansion in awhile I spend $0. Last few have been disappointing and I never even remotely got my money's worth. As such I've just been hoarding gold for the next set, and will use base whether I keep playing at all in the future based on its quality.
---
I'm not optimistic.

And haste, big creatures need to have an immediate impact on the board
---
Because you want your shadow visions to have a better chance to draw a board clear and not a mind blast. The deck is designed to kill control and combo decks which usually have too much armour for your minions to break through before you fatigue and lose. Or you get out valued through other board clears and your opponent stabilizes. Let's just say this deck has out valued many hagathas. 
---
This isnt a midrange deck or aggro deck. You play minions for board and chip damage. You zihi and madness when you have stabilized or won board or you benedictus first usually. After that you literally just play for board and control. 
---
Geist - wrecks Mechathun decks and sort of wall priests too. 
---
Benedictus - beats any control warrior except quest warrior can be difficult. Also beats pretty much any control/long game decks. Especially even paladin.
---
Zihi/madness - Good against OTK decks, warriors, elemental shaman, Hunter is about 50/50. The idea is that once you benedictus they will keep fighting for board. Your minions now are quite buffed and they can't outvalue it. By this point in the game they've run out of a lot of resources that they can't contest your board. 
---
The only only decks that actually give you any trouble are mages and hunters and malygos rogue if you dont draw geist and they draw the perfect cards.
---
Looked it up there was a bug were you could cast packt directly on the Prince, this was fixed.
---
Paladin deck is awful this week. Almost no early game minions. Rogue and warrior have the better decks this week.
---
If you buy packs you are not f2p. We've come to a point where "only" paying $50 every 4 months is considered "free to play player".
---
Im at rank 13 but I see them on casual.

It's a very expensive game that has no physical value. I'm done spending money on it.

---
ANCIENT ONE DONATING LOTS OF BLOOD TODAY, AT LEAST YOU GET A COOKIE AFTERWARDS 
---
The adventures put powerful cards behind a paywall... the only way to get them was to buy the adventure. People hated it. I'm surprised anyone wants them back.
---
I was free to play during the era of Adventures and I have no idea what you mean.  The non-Heroic bosses were always pushovers, even with limited collections.
---
So the armor changed from 15 to 1. Brilliant. 
---
They fixed the bug LOL
---
Yes, all these numbers matter, but there's still a number that businesses prioritize, and that number are the profits. If the number of players (spending their time) stayed the same, while the number of sales dropped by 50%, most companies would investigate and try to improve their product / service and/or make better offers. (And such a drop in sales could have been the cause of the latest hires. An investment to rescue the cash cow.)
---
Patches was op because it was decktinning, sinergy e boardflood all in one
---
The problem is the people who buy microtransactions have no impulse control. This means it doesn't matter how many topics are made "planning" to not buy anything, as soon as they see a trailer and something new and shiny, they'll start hurling money at the company as fast as they can. 
---
Is it worth it to craft these cards now to get extra dust?
---
Yeah, just one as the Solo Adventure hero for the first expansion, not related
---
Yeah seriously, between nerfing the ramp cards and then removing Naturalize AND the set rotating, what the fuck is going to happen with that class?
---
They really need to un-nerf the ramp cards
---
That's unthinkable round these parts. 
---
It was 700 gold per wing 3-4? years ago then it became free, not the other way round
---
Equality is still balanced at 4 manna, it's such a broken card.
---
There will be lots of posts.  If I recall, the only ones that make a profit by crafting gold are Common/Rares because their values are weird.  (or at least Rares).  Look up the Year of the Kraken posts for that info, specifically Coldlight Oracle.
---
Best Hall of Fame ever.
---
TY BLIZZY
---
Ehhhh arena still costs gold or money, and there's no deck building. Arena scratches a certain itch and this will be refreshing for arena players, but that's it. New formats are needed. This tweak to arena is a tiny step in the right direction but it's not nearly enough. 
---
You get the crafting cost refunded, so for golden legendary it's 3200, for normal legendary it's 1600 - for golden epic, it's 1600, for normal epic it's 400, and so on. But you don't get dust for extra copies (i.e. only for one legendary, and two for other rarities).
---
Does malygos have a realm or something in warcraft? I think that's first and the malygos in human form is gonna be the new mage hero. Though I may be totally off lore wise on that.  
---
And if maly is the first maybe the others are also aspects?
---
Looking back at the incredible number of hours I have put in Dungeon Run, Monster Hunt and Rumble, I'd say I would have been worth it for me to pay the gold for those to. These adventures hold really high value for a lot of players, unfortunately there will be selfish people that will complain about the return of the price tag without looking at and evaluating it from all directions.
---
Or in other words: I will pay it cuz I know it will be worth it.
---
That sounds like an average turn 7 to me dude no clue what you're talking about
---
Sounds reasonable if you're not F2P, I guess - but as an F2P player the adventures were always fantastic as they guaranteed powerful cards rather than forcing me to rely on inconsistent drop rates (especially as this was before the pack ratio changes).
---
Whoops. Fixed it, thanks.
---

Idk I love the Arena change. As someone who pathologically avoids Arena, having old and new sets rotating in and out could make it feel super fresh. For the first time I'm actually looking forward to trying out Arena.
---
They are oppressive in Wild. Wild players wanted a change to these cards, not to be HoF‚Äôed untouched. 
---
Lol. OK bye.
---
The entire idea of the HoF is bullshit, I've hated it from the start and now we're coming into year 3 of it.
---
It depends if he will keep them or not.
---
I don't think they're scrapping Even/Odd moreso than they're scrapping specifically Genn and Baku and their powerful Start of Game effects.
---
The only problem with future Odd/Even cards is that they will supplement Genn and Baku in Wild.
---
They will almost certainly revisit Odd/Even in the future, but I mean the *far* future. There are so many ideas that they've glimpsed at or scratched the surface of and haven't revisited yet. Because that's how card games work -- there are millions, *billions* of iterations to make, they don't have to obsess on one thing ceaselessly and exhaust it before moving on.
---
As such I will expect Odd/Even to return *at some point,* but not in the foreseeable future.
---
nerfing =/= killing lol. 
---
Kind of sad to see what is the only good demon in the classic set be taken out. I wouldn't have minded making it a 4/7 or simply giving it rush instead of charge.
---
Looks good. That's a set of cards I won't miss at all in Standard.  
---
Who the hell is gonna play those cards without Genn and Baku? Might as well rotate them. Also, two of them are epic. Can you imagine how bad it would feel to open one of them in a pack and know it's 100% useless?
---
The issue with Baku and Genn is that they severely restrict design space. 
---
Take odd paladin for example. The HP is strong enough that they can't print odd costed board buffs in standard. Give paladin a 3 mana [[mark of the lotus]] and they'd be T1 in both standard and potentially wild. It is that good. 
---
Blizzard's nerfs aren't always good, but the majority of them I'd argue have made the game better. Call to arms, Patches, Corridor creeper and hunter's mark are examples of good nerfs. 
---
Pre patch
---
I've wanted this for so long, glad it's finally going to come.
---
It's the Year of the DRAGON.  You can't Hall of Fame Malygos going into the Year of the Dragon!  It's one of the most iconic dragons in the game!  
---
The only time they have "replaced" cards rotated to the hall of fame were for class cards from the classic set so I very much doubt we'll get extra legendaries as a replacement of sorts, especially not in a separate expansion.
---
Good luck playing Wild and not hitting odd paladin and even shaman. Those decks are prevalent and have been problems since Genn and Baku were released. They should have been changed or looked into working on them instead of just taking them out of the more profitable format and screwing Qild players with it.
---
This is the best thing I a LONG time that happened to hearthstone I think game will have its second youth 
---
They'd never add Lich King to the classic set since it'd just be Ragnaros 2.0
---
Wild is pretty good right now, if anything Big Priest is the problem, not Genn or Baku. Odd pally and Even shaman are the only OP decks using them and even then non-Baku aggro pally is almost as good
---
It was broken.

Lich King needs to rotate. 
---
Alex hasnt even seen much play lately and I never saw her in months.
---
Holy shit. There go my only two actual competitive decks. 
---
As f2p, I‚Äôve only been able to make two decent decks, odd rogue and Mechathun Druid. Looks like they‚Äôre both gone now. 
---
Oh look! Just in time for me to play MTGA!
---
^I'm sorry guys
---
Is it just me or does this feel like a completely new game, like Hearthstone2.0? The new changes all make sense, the rotation of Baku and Genn are a surprise, but probably the best choice for the sake of balance. Without those power houses and the DKs gone, Standard can go back to being lower on power but more balanced. They really went all-in for the year of the Dragon and it seems to me like they are going exactly in the direction players want them to go: A cool single player experience, a solution to Baku/Genn, random card backs, and Hall of Fames that I quite like to be honest.
---
I am really looking foward to the new Hearthstone year now!
---
My guess is April 3rd.
---
&gt;Finally, as we bid farewell to the sets rotating out of Standard, we thought it would be fitting to give them a truly Mammoth sunset. Logging into the game between midnight on March 25, 2019 and midnight of April 2, 2019 will reward you with one pack each from the Journey to Un‚ÄôGoro, Knights of the Frozen Throne, and Kobolds &amp; Catacombs expansions.
---
They nerfed Raza when it moved to wild, but not those 2? I guess blizzard isn't consistent
---
(And I'm still salty because blizzard killed my midrange priest that was actually decent)
---
All good hits, but a little surprised that either Malygos or mind blast isn‚Äôt going also; that deck is just as bad as the naturalize decks though I suppose losing the epic spell will hurt
---
Very true, it's a reason why bigger names are getting bored of the game. Sure you can play some netdeck with baku and genn and reach legend but so what, it's not fun doing so. Hearthstone is a game that feels like a chore because of these cards when all a lot of people want to do is have fun with new decks even those grinding latter don't want to play the same thing forever unless you want the game to die.
---
"Year of the Dragon"
---
Taste the words in your head like a fine wine.
---
Thing is that Naturalize was barely used until recently. Anyone who has played since 2014 can attest that Naturalize was a very niche card until it started being able to be comboed with things like Hadronox or Mecha'Thun. 
---
Prevously, the drawback of giving two cards to your opponents used to be huge but now it's mitigated by an absurd amount of Druid card draw and the rise of single-target win conditions.
---
Finally Kibler can take a break from video making.
---
That would be absolutely insane.  I hope that never happens.
---
‚ÄòClass identity‚Äô is beginning to sound more and more like bullshit every day. Druid had 2 cheap hard removal options in Classic for years: Mulch and Naturalise. Their weakness was classically midsize, wide boards, as the only options they had were Swipe and Starfall, which provided both sub-optimal spread damage and stall for the cost. 
---
Then, as soon as Spreading Plague was printed, that weakness was majorly neutered, meaning that Druid suddenly was a jack of all trades class with no major drawbacks and several powerful win conditions, quickly making it tier 1 across multiple decks. Now Blizzard are once again nerfing a classic card rather than the actual problem, and lying about class identity to cover their asses. The irony is that with Spreading Plague finally rotating out, Druid is now likely going to slide right down to the bottom tiers again, as all their OP cards from KFT are disappearing.
---
I'm suprised the new Arena will contain at least 8 expansions though. Quite a lot if you ask me
---
I actually like the idea, provided the content is good. 
---
grinding for legend doesn't have an incentive anymore. So arena and ladder I guess are the same thing in terms of rewards
---
This is the first time I've heard of a unanimous opinion on Malygos. As someone who personally enjoys Malygos in standard where did this opinion come from?
---
Sealed mode is Arena and they changed the rank system last month
---
HoF-ed means no mana refund, right?
---
I crafted Mecha'Thun a couple weeks ago when I realized that Druid was barely losing anything in the rotation. So now I get an 80 dust refund for making that deck unplayable. 
---
Anthem is fantastic. You're doing yourself a disservice by falling for the hate-hype. I'm 60 hours in and have had the most fun since the Taken King. Devs are vocal and mskjng changes and providing fixes in quite a timely manner. The negativity surrounding Anthem is wildly exaggerated. 
---
According to Kripp, 1/9
---
Definitely a step in the right direction but we need more. Let‚Äôs not get complacent. This will get me to log back in for a little while but I don‚Äôt see anything that will sustain long term interest for those of us who‚Äôve left. I love the Arena seasons idea but ladder needs to be revamped too. 
---
That is the singularly most lucid analogy for why people hate that card that I've ever read! I'm impressed.
---
The cards listed as going to the HoF above.
---
***TLDR Summary***
---
* The new year theme for HS is **Year of the Dragon** and its 3 expansions will all tell one continuous, evolving storyline.
---
* **Baku and Genn --&gt; Hall of Fame** after just 12 months in Standard. Ditto the Odd/Even synergy cards: **Black Cat, Glitter Moth, Gloom Stag and Murkspark Eel**
---
* Classic cards **Doomguard, Naturalize and Divine Favor** also getting HOFed. (Remember that when a card goes to the Hall, you get full dust value up to a playset, with Golden copies prioritized, AND you get to keep the cards or dust them for regular value.)
---
* **Deck Builder improvements** -- it will be able to create the highest-win-rate deck for the cards you select and/or have available
---
* **Card back randomizer** -- tired of showing the same card back all day/week/whatever? Now every game you can show a different card back
---
* **Arena Seasons** will last two months each and will feature cards from certain sets, while others will be unavailable for selection in Arena mode. The first season will feature cards from Basic, Classic, Naxx, WOTOG, MSG, TWW and 2019's first set.
---
* Starting with the update, **Arena wins will count toward Golden Portraits**
---
* If you don't like the start-of-expansion quest chains, now you'll be able to reroll those for regular quests
---
* **PVE "Adventures" are back** (sort of). In May, about a month after Expansion 1 drops, the new PVE content will open up. It will feature
---
-- Five "wings" similar to how Naxx, BRM, LOE and ONIK were structured. The first one's free, the rest will cost 700 gold each, or you can buy the whole thing for 19.99 USD. (Unforch each wing rewards just 3 NewSet packs each, rather than sets of new cards the way Adventures did)
---
-- Much more replayability with Heroic Mode, Anomaly Mode, 4 starter decks and 3 Hero Powers per class, progression trackers &amp; much more
---
The first one looks like it could be original *Shattrath*. The color scheme reminds me of the WoD Draenei.
---
The second one reminds me of *Uldum* with the hieroglyphics and gems on the bottom. I don't know why the shape in the middle looks that way though.
---
The third one is really throwing me for a look. It definitely looks like it could be Iron Horde, but the markings in the bottom corners look like something else. I wish I could think of anything other than Iron Horde, or Black Dragonflight.
---
No big deal.  In ~1 month you get all the dust back and its probably good in Wild.
---
Long shot, but I'm calling #3 as Mantid/Klaxxi.
---
Value for golden pack should be higher.  You're counting chance for epics/legendaries in the 100g=100 dust (otherwise it would just be 40), so you need to do something similar with golden packs.
---
or \[\[Mulch\]\]
---
Good thing set rotations generally help a lot with that, since there are less cards in the game + you get a massive bonus from HoF. So there's that
---
But you get 3200 for the rotation, and then you can dust it for another 1600, can't you?
---
This. The only problem I had with the old adventures is when the powerful cards are the last wings, and I have to spend so much gold to get past the cards that I do not need to get it.
---
Odd paladin is tier 2 last I checked. I never see odd paladin on ladder, either. It's always aggro or Anyfin. Even warlock is tier 1, but there's also Reno, cube, and Mechathun in tier 1.
---
Watching Firebat's latest Deck Doctor Episode Divine Favor isn't even that good, I'd say. Personally I will miss Doomguard in Standard, for me the game is more fun with Charge but I understand. Baku and Genn were a mistake and Blizzzard admitting it is huge.
---
Overall interesting announcements. Changes were needed, the game is in a bad state. Let's see if the game improves for the good. 
---
So what actually changes in arena

3/-/- | Destroy a minion. Add a random minion to your opponent's hand.  
---
In wild they are more play, but gosh yeah they should be rotated from standard. The limitations they put on decks and other cards is just too much. 
---
Somewhat. Honestly, the power level in wild is so damned high that they don't really dominate the field. 
---
I expected a more blizzardy way to fix it: 
---
Stulting Heist 
---
8 mana minion / 6/8 
---
Battlecry: If your opponent's deck contains only Even or only Odd cards, destroy the enemy hero. Draw a card. 
---
Okay, I will preorder the next expansion after all I guess.
---
The point is, in your own words, the exchange is only *potentially reasonable*. It's no secret this game is struggling to retain its playerbase, and their solution to that is to add content that is only *potentially reasonable*? There is nothing smart about trying to nickel-and-dime the remaining players they have left. They should be making decisions that are no-brainers for the community, not forcing us into decisions like "well, maybe that's worth it, I'm not sure"
---
Love these changes. Genn and Baku are HUGE problems to deck building archetypes and gameplay. Bravo Hearthstone team!
---
The final one seems like a globule of Azerite. I could see it being based in Silithus, around the Wound area where the Sword of Sargeras hit Azeroth.
---
This doesn't address a few critical issues... 
---
a) Wild is being ignored. Genn/Baku as well as metawarping cards still exist there. And scant little is going to happen if the cards themselves are not changed.
---
b) Counterplay or interactivity is still not there? There's a chance that the new set of cards will provide interactivity, but... I'm not holding my breath. This is tied in hand with matchup polarization. Genn/Baku being out will hopefully see a lower power curve on many of the decks, and after DKs rotate infinite value will be out. That is good. 
---
c) Evergreen classic set still there!
---
d) Expansion model still the same. No adventures, which means it's harder for normal players to keep up.
---
e) No new format... that's a big one. If I play it'd be to netdeck again... or just do wack decks in wild and don't mind the losses.
---
Then again, at least Genn and Baku are gone. Druid even more in the shitter (guess I'm going to wild anyways). Friends list still pretty atrocious and lonely. 
---
Meh. 
---
I was really hoping Malygos and Alex would get the HoF treatment but once I heard Year of the Dragon I knew that wasn't going to happen.  The HoF'd cards are good ones though and the rest of the changes seem good.
---
Arena seasons are cool, and the Adventure pricing seems a little steep for what you get initially.  If the solo content is fun then it might be worth it. I'm cautiously optimistic. 
---
It's free but you lose out on a Card Back and *some* Pve content like new heroes.  Basically, for the net  price of 1300 gold you get an extra hero portrait and golden classic pack.
---
Didn't say I ended the season there, but I was there for a few days. The end of the month grind is not something I enjoy though, so never pushed for it.
---
Nothing is getting nerfed, and Cube is rotating is out of Standard.
---
Because I have something obscene like 50,000 dust from crafting almost nothing from the weak card pool of the last year but still completing a year of daily quests.
---
I‚Äôm not. I always hate being ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù, but here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt care/don‚Äôt like most of the changes here:
---
This was the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù solution for Genn and Baku. This was the solution that players that play Standard but not Wild wanted. It‚Äôs what Kibler wanted. It keeps people that liked playing Even/Odd decks happy, but given the power level of such decks in Wild already, it is really poor future-proofing as more cards provide more options to make deck restrictions matter less.
---
The random card back thing I can‚Äôt complain about because there‚Äôs nothing negative about it. It‚Äôs been a long requested feature, and I‚Äôm glad the people who actually care about it get it to keep them happy.
---
The Hall of Fame stuff for more classic cards was bound to happen again, and this time it has a big impact on traditional aggro Paladin and Zoo lists. At this point, I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt just rotate certain sets in and out each year like a lot of people suggested.
---
 The adventure model honestly irritates me. This is not like the old adventures where you were guaranteed a set of cards. This is just a paid expansion pack for the expansion itself. I personally haven‚Äôt pre-ordered in a while, but for those who do, they‚Äôre presumably asking for another $60 a year on top of $150 to get content that has typically been free since the old school adventures rotated. (The card pricing is pretty much identical for US prices. 15 expansions packs for $20, and they throw in a gold pack to sweeten this particular deal.)
---
The Arena changes are kind of the only change I care about. Shorter lived arena metas definitely help keep the experience fresh. 
---
TL;DR: For me:
---
- Genn and Baku change: Bad solution
---
- Hall of Fame: Kinda neutral, questioning the logic of no rotating sets more and more.
---
- Random Cardback Changes: I mean, it can only be a good thing. I just don‚Äôt care about it.
---
- New ‚ÄúAdventures‚Äù: Worse than old adventures, locks single player content behind a paywall (money or a lot of gold) again with a worse payoff for players. 
---
- Arena Changes: Again, pretty much no drawbacks.
---
this isn‚Äôt anything new, this is how it started.
---
Much prefer this over paywalling specific powerful cards... The solo experiences obviously take a lot of effort so the price seems alright.
---
Provided content was good, it's about reaching a larger audience who doesn't play competitive and enjoy dungeon running while commuting.
---
This is so sad to see this feature that was free behind a 20$ paywall.
---
For the umpteenth time - Wild is supposed to be much, much stronger than Standard. That is why they don't nerf Reno, Loatheb or Kazakus. 
---
Get fucked
---
I made a thread about it. You have to min/max according to your current collection but if you have 20k dust will be able to maximize your returns. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avrui0/collection_management_tips_with_recent_news/

GodfatherXP#1915 NA 80g quest
---
Not as meta breaking as Seawitch or that stupid melon but by far the most influencial legendaries in the format.
---
Odd Rogue, even shaman, odd warrior, odd pala and even warlock are all tier 1-2 decks.
---
If nothing changes about those cards it will stay this way for years to come...
---
Overall yes, but Naturalize? What is Blizzards problem with druid, the card wasnt playable for years.
---
Yep full dust value
---
Literally everyone was saying this your not special 
---
I shouldnt be surprised by Blizzard taking laziest way after all this time.
---
Divine Favor was never really overpowering. I've played a good amount of Pally, have over 1,000 wins in ranked; I'd say about 30% of the time I drew more than 2 cards, and the other 75% I got fucked by either drawing one card or not drawing it at all.  
---
Also, if you know you're playing against an Aggro pally, you should know not to keep a big hand. It's totally possible to play around it.
---
Loses so much support with Shadow Visions, Divine Spirit really never saw competitive play before Ungoro, that kinda makes sense

The nerf to Flametongue hurt Even Shaman, but it‚Äôs still considered Tier 1 I think. Since the nerf, I haven‚Äôt actually played against any of them. Odd Paladin is still strong, but it‚Äôs the same with Even Shaman. I just don‚Äôt run into them anymore. I think the one deck that I still occasionally run into is Even Warlock. 
---
Sadly this is also how I feel
---
You'll get full dust value of Venn and Baku AND get to keep the cards. As well as any other HOF cards. So there's that at least
---
I'll miss all the decks I was able to afford to make with Baku, but I guess it's for the health of the game (and I don't really play anymore so eh).
---
Yes. They give the dust back for the two highest value ones. This is what happened last year.
---
They keep rexxar around for 2 years but give me a year to play odd warrior? I don‚Äôt like that.
---
Do you not own 2 copies of those cards yet?
---
If you only have 0 or 1 Doomguards, now is definitely the time to craft your way up to 2.  Same for all the other cards going to HoF.
---
Am I the only person that feels that Hall of Faming the Odd/Even cards is a bit of a kneejerk move?  I didn't find any real issues to be fair, but rather Blizzard being too gunshy to print actual good cards to keep these decks in check.  Year of the Raven was really lackluster, and with the best cards being cut completely and Mammoth rotating as well I can't say that Dragon will be any good.
---
Jade Druid, N'Zoth, Mecha'thun, Big Priest, Quest Mage, Bloodreaver Gul'dan are terrorizing Wild.
---
It's place where Baku and Genn belong.
---
Good catch, you‚Äôre probably right here.
---
How is removing two cards that paid for at least one-quarter of upwards of ten competitive decks in Standard a good day for free-to-play players?
---
I agree with your first point. As for the new solo content, I will give the benefit of the doubt because we don‚Äôt know what it fully entails, but it seems clear that the Devs intend improve the solo contents in the least.
---
in the lore, ancients are not treants.
---
Its honestly not that bad
---
&gt; (c) A player may only earn points from a single in-game Hearthstone Ladder per Standard Ranked
---
Play Season, but the points they earn will be based off their highest placement on the Americas,
---
Asia, or Europe in-game Hearthstone Ladders. Points are awarded based on a player‚Äôs standing
---
in Standard Ranked Play on the Hearthstone Ladders at the end of each Standard Ranked Play
---
Season may be revoked at Blizzard‚Äôs discretion. Situations that might lead to such an action could
---
include where **a player engages in account sharing, boosting, win trading,** etc., or where points
---
were incorrectly assigned to the player. 
---
Hmmm ü§î
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8ixgh1/2018_april_us_server_wintrading/
---
Every class is losing a lot, and we've no clue who wins in the new set. The metagame will be so different upon rotation that it's almost impossible to guess what will happen.
---
Will you do this every time a company makes cuts? What did you do in 2012, when Blizzard made the same percentage of cuts? 
---
And what's the point anyway? Even IF you'd get him fired, what do you think how much money he will get for that? Spoiler: tons of it. 
---
Don't get me wrong, firing 800 people sucks hard, but do you care, create petitions and whatnot when Microsoft does it? Or Apple, Samsung, whoever else? 
---
I know you think it's for a good cause, but at the end of the day it's riding a bandwagon. 
---
It's also like downvoting is meant to be used towards topics that don't contribute to the discussion, rather than using it just because you don't like what the person has to say. Weird.
---
They know Dragons are cool and they know people are willing to pay a bit more for Dragons.
---
They also have a token identity that is still very strong and with witchwood apple it synergizes well with mountain giant, sea giant, and mulchmuncher. Not as flashy as some of the stuff weve seen lately but i think treant token druid is going to be good once a lot of this broken stuff moves to wild.
---
The problem is that the two cards are *way* too influencial for a whole format and this will not change for years and years to come.
---
I can live with individual staple cards like Reno that will make a big impression once per game. Baku and Genn are different in that it transforms a large portion of the meta into hero power pushing contests starting turn 1 or 2.
---
I'll never understand most of the complaints from wild players. I think most of you entirely miss the point of wild. Wild is not and was never supposed to be some safe haven where everything is balanced....
---
You only get dust for the highest type you have, not all cards. However, if you already have them, I wouldn't bother crafting golden. If you don't have 2 of the non legendaries or 1 legendary, it's worth crafting golden
---
I hope they add a new tribe. I wonder if they'll update Nightmare Amalgam
---
Are the times in the evening? Like 7:30 pm? 
---
&gt; If you own a normal baku, you craft a golden one now, you spend 3200 but get back 3200 dust plus you can disenchant it so 4800 dust total and you still have the nongolden copy of it. 
---
You're thinking about this the wrong way. You don't net 4800 dust. You only net 1600. This is literally the same result as doing nothing if you already own a normal Baku. 
---
I also predicted that the sun was gonna shine today.
---
Its the easiest solution / prediction
---
When a card goes to HoF, you get it's value in dust without having to disenchant it. You may then disenchant for the standard dust return. It's not nerf rules.
---
Ahhh, got it, thank you.
---
Oh cool! Do you have a link for what they said about the anti combo card?
---
 My initial interpretations of this:
---
1. Draenei  - Velen/Prophecy? Perhaps the exposition for the Year of the Dragon  overarching narrative? A foreshadowing could initiate the story and  create the reasoning to travel to faraway lands.
---
2. I'm picking up 2 vibes from this: Uldum or Vol'dun.  
---
In Uldum, Al'Akir was allied with Deathwing and attempted to convince the Tol'vir to join them. During Cataclysm, Deathwing would also periodically fly over Uldum and torch it, killing players that were caught.
---
3. &amp;#x200B;
---
I think the Hearthstone  team are making a better effort at thematic resonance in this year with  the naming convention. During Year of the Mammoth, they expressed the  year name would identify with its expansion themes. Mammoth resonated  with dinosaurs in Un'Goro, the frozen north of Northrend, and loosely  catacombs
---
First one is almost definitely Dalaran/Kirin Tor themed.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
- Same colors
---
- The first new solo content in the Year of the Dragon is about the story of a "mysterious (but familiar) mage."
---
- The rune on the bottom is an arcane rune from WoW that is associated with Dalaran/Kirin Tor/Human Mages
---
- Center purple gem contains runes from arcane mage and portal spell effects/decor in WoW.
---
Second looks like Nazjatar, but can't definitively say. The runes are shamanic runes from WoW.
---
Third is a Bronze Dragonflight/Time travel theme.
---
- Coloring is identical to the Warlords of Draenor Frostfire Ridge motif (Frostwolf armor, Iron Horde, trimmings, and broken lava paths.)
---
- Includes a Draenor Orc marking in each corner.
---
- Shattered Bronze orb in the center is the broken time travel shard from the bronze dragonflight that was used to start Warlords of Draenor and was recently shattered in Battle for Azeroth during the Mag'har Orc recruitment quest.
---
Most of his heroes are already golden iirc 
---
Even better, craft Golden Genn, get rebated the cost you paid, then DE for 1600 dust.
---
If you already have a non-golden version of a legendary, then you end up +1600 dust either way (you either get 1600 for it or you put in 3200 to get 3200 + 1600 for dusting). The only things to consider are:
---
\- If you don't already have a copy, craft a golden one to get either 1600 dust or a golden legendary to play in Wild for free.
---
\- If you have a regular copy and want to upgrade it to gold to play in Wild, you can essentially do so by downgrading your payout from 1600 dust to 400 dust by DEing the normal copy and crafting gold. Essentially, you can upgrade it to gold for 1200 dust instead of the usual 2800 if you still want to use it.
---
Adventure : 20$ or 12‚Ç¨ !!!
---
It looks like the EU will finally have a decent convertion rate !!! I hope (not to much) that it will be the case for boosters too.
---
Thanks blizz for finally moving this line. It was about time !
---
If you add multiply deck isn't 20k cheap then? How many decks do you add to get to 20k dust?
---
Tournament mode has been put on "indefinite hiatus". So, don't look for it any time soon.
---
You can always go mecha c'thun. Although it might be harsh without Naturalize.
---
Or there's also hadronnox (however its spelled)
---
Serves em right for being such pain in the ass for the past months.
---
And oh, how could i forget Gonk. That's a sweet deck lmao
---
Don't think the percentage of net deckers will differ much at all. I feel the players who make homebrews are well aware of the meta and disregard them at a certain point regardless 
---
Token, probably. 
---
Yeah, and paying for main content makes sense. Why the fuck are we paying for fun side content, too, now?
---
Dude seriously. These fast, hard hitting nerfs are completely revitalizing the game. This is coming from a salty old whale too.
---
I got a Dragon Soul vibe from the third one.
---
Honestly, it sounds like you were already mostly out the door and and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessarily representative of the average player. 
---
The devs did the best thing they could have for Standard (the heart of the game) and that was move Genn and Baku to the HoF. This says way more to me about the state of the game than the optional solo content. 
---
I would agree if Jaina DK was still going to be in standard. Jana'lai won't be particularly useful without that elemental synergy + the odd hero power. 
---
They did nothing. I don't like the golden Heroes and I don't want them and I play mostly Arena.
---
What now? Did they did the option to choose? Of course not.... 6 years and they don't give an optiont if you want to enable golden heroes or not.
---
Going by 24h clock, 07:30 means 7:30am. 7:30pm would be 19:30
---
Dungeon Run's are just lazy RNG fests compared to the old PVE content. Now we have to pay for them too.
---
To shareholders, it's a feature
---
Wow the cards that are rotating make very little sense:
---
\- **Doomguard:** I agree that Doomguard has been around for a long time and has been powerful for a long time but this is one of the strongest Discard related cards so it seems really strange that they would rotate it after literally printing several cards with discard synergy in the last expansion. It makes perfect sense to rotate Doomguard next year along with Jeklik and the other discard related cards from the last expansion. 
---
\- **Naturalize:** On its own Naturalize is not a strong card, however it is made strong by UI and King Togwaggle which makes losing card advantage irrelevant as well as making your opponent draw cards into a win condition. I can only assume that Druid is going to get more strong card draw because otherwise this card would go back to being terrible after UI rotates. 
---
\- **Divine Favor:** This is another card that is not particularly strong overall except against slow control decks. Maybe it's being rotated because the upcoming meta will favor control decks once again, although Blizzard did nothing to this card in previous control heavy metas. I won't shed any tears for this card being rotated but at the same time there seems little reason to do so.
---
\- **Baku/Genn:** Rotating these cards without changing them seems like the ultimate in laziness. Yes, these cards are very hard to nerf without fundamentally changing them, but that hasn't stopped Blizzard before. I am very happy that they are leaving Standard since I think they have a very bad effect on the game but at the same time Wild is still a thing and leaving them completely unchanged just feels like a slap in the face to Wild players. 
---
If you have the spare dust, do that in golden for +1600 instead.
---
My boy Leeroy dodged the HoF net again.
---
Could be a hedge against druid mecha'thun decks
---
I'm honestly excited to finally get into arena. 
---
Well, the expansion is being release alongside it, no cards are being gated behind it as far as I can currently tell (something people tend to forget about with the old Adventures), and for the price of fifteen packs and the opportunity cost of three packs from the new expansion, you are getting a Golden Classic pack, two card backs, and upwards of two hours of single player content.
---
I wouldn't hardly call that greedy.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Right now, Aggro Kingsbane Rogue seems to be the best deck. For a while, Reno decks were the best thing too. 
---
Bye?
---
Yes you alone called it!
---
Idk, why you downvote this, have you seen any new basic cards being played above rank 20?
---
Dragon Soul
---
Do they contain exclusive cards?
---
People thought KotFT *was* Dalaran.
---
I can't afford either. 
---
Probably new classic cards like they already did. We already are going to get some new classic legendaries too which they announced.
---
Thank god I didn't enchant 4 legendaries to craft Baku for Odd Mage after the new expansion... Oh wait I did
---
So guys we did it....
---
&gt; just to make the ideal Tempo Mage deck.
---
Blizz never promised anyone a rose garden. 
---
If the ideal X deck has cards gated behind multiple Adventures, seems to me the player can (A) buy em, (B) grind gold for em, (C) learn to make do with a less-than-ideal version of X deck, and/or (D) figure out Deck A B or C that *doesn't* have so many hard-to-get cards
---
It is probably related to Hearthstone's playerbase fading a bit, and competition from MTG Arena.
---
Now they are trying a lot harder to keep players happy.  I hope this continues.  Competition is very good for consumers.
---
Just dont craft golden versions of cards you already have. it's not economical.
---
Random card back = HEARTSTONE IS SAVED!
---
Where is tournament mode?  Economy changes? Changes to the way cards are nerfed into oblivion?
---
This is all glitter and no gold.
---
They will continue to dominate wild until the end of time 
---
Really?  Is this retroactive?!
---
[https://i.imgur.com/K1FHckW.png](https://i.imgur.com/K1FHckW.png)
---
Blizzard didn't just shake up the meta here, they put it in a blender.
---
And I'll say the same thing I said elsewhere:
---
&gt; Previous adventures had an average of 70 cards (54+57+85+85) and 2 card backs (one only from pre-ordering).
---
&gt; The new Dungeon Run has 15 cards packs (75 cards), a golden pack, a golden Legendary (Zayle, Shadow Cloak), and 2 card backs.
---
Even if you are getting lesser "collection" value from the tangibles, the older adventures had virtually zero replay-ability, whereas Dungeon Run games have a TON of it - and this is coming with new hero powers, new decks, new enemies, AND Anomaly Mode.
---
It's good value if you like the single-player content, and not required to buy (like the adventures were) if you don't.
---
Sounds like a win/win to me.
---
They also promise that the PVE adventure will be way better than before , so we'll see if that's worth the ~1200 gold that you're paying for it (if you count the golden pack as 400 gold worth of dust).
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Wow you said something that had a good chance at happening wow you are so cool my dude , COMMENDED 
---
Am I crazy, or is that poster hidden in the top right showing the sewers of Dalaran? 
---
I mean if i craft the golden one and disenchant it at rotation dont i get an automatic refund? At rotation?
---
I'm thinking it's really not going to be worth buying the single player content. It's like they saw the success of the single player adventures in the past, but took the worst part of all of it.
---
Am I the only one that is excited af for the random card back. That‚Äôs the one feature I wanted in the game since forever. 
---
And thank god for Genn/Baku HoF. But was kinda obvious so I‚Äôm actually not really surprised. If they let those 2 in the game it would have probably tanked a big player number. 
---
It was just a joke.
---
&gt; The problem is that the two cards are way too influencial for a whole format 
---
The exact stats I linked seem to contradict this statement.
---
I don't think you're angry enough about this 
---
Yeah but Jeklik and Soulwarden aren't.  
---
No, the game will compensate you for the best versions you have, up to what can be included in a deck.
---
If you own regular Genn, regular Baku, golden Genn, and golden Baku, it will just compensate you for the golden versions (3200 + 3200 = 6400).
---
Same. My immediate thought was Deathwing
---
That's what I thought, thanks.  HoF &amp; Dusting != NerfedCardDustRefundAmount  
---
So, then I should craft two Golden Gloom Stag's because I have zero of them, and I'll just have two free golden ones in case they are ever good, right?
---
Considering other key players like Trump and Firebat have moved on to autochess, they need Kibler.
---
I get a feeling it's the Dragon Soul
---
If you have the dust the yes it does cost zero in the long run. 
---
I'm most happy about this.  I wonder if previous wins will count?
---
Because they're fleshing it out beyond its initial scope and attaching rewards to it. There clearly trying to make it into a game unto itself because it's become popular among people who don't really care for the traditional card game aspect.
---
Whether this is worth it or not depends if you can disenchant the golden legendary.  If you can then 1300 gold for 1600 dust + whatever the golden classic pack is worth (about 400 dust?) is actually not a bad deal.
---
I don't have the dust to craft them both in gold, sadly.
---
It's just frustrating seeing cunts like Kotick pocket shitloads of cash for their position and have zero negative consequences when they fuck up. They keep going for short term explosive growth and when that backfires they lay off normal people who actually feel the Impact from that. Kotick could stop earning any money now and still live the rest of his life slurping champagne from golden skulls.
---
Wait until the last brawl for the classics. It might be best to do the same with the witchwood cards, as we might get some packs for some reason
---
If you open the cards you net the same amount of dust as crafting golds
---
Yea, I guess if you don't want to keep them around
---
To be fair, they aren't as bad in wild in terms of making the format feel too narrow since there are way more ways to build an odd or even deck, and how can they even nerf them without a complete redesign? Wild will manage, if not they can make the change later, they have done so before.
---
no I'm very excited about the randomizer too.  when I do a TLDR I try &amp; stick with the plain info, not get caught up in cheerleading  O:-)
---
about Genn &amp; Baku, honestly I thought they maybe would straight banlist them, MTG style. Just admit that they were bad design. But I guess they don't want to do that, and besides, what would be fair compensation for banlisted cards:  double dust value? triple?
---
so no, instead take an existing "this card is too strong" structure (the Hall of Fame) and apply it to the Odd and Even cards a year early. where they can further muddy the waters in Wild, not that Team 5 seems to care much what goes on there
---
People thought wrong, people think wrong. 
---
Thank you, I have always wanted to craft Genn but I never did because I wanted to play other decks
---
Yeah and it's still a ripoff lmfao. 15 packs is nothing which is why they offer discounts at the beginning of every expansion to try to get people to buy it.
---
Thanks!
---
Just do the math and you will see I am right. If you can¬¥t do the math, just research on the internet and you will also see that I am right.
---
I keep telling myself that this is the year I switch to Arena as my main format (away from ranked). With the rotating sets, as well as wins counting towards my golden Hero now is as good a time as any.
---
...and we won't be wildly upset about it either, saying things like "they were a joke race from warcraft 3, omg blizz" like back when Mists of Pandaria was first announced.
---
Well I don't need golden versions, I have the regular ones
---
rejoice
---
Yeah, I had conflicting times, I've fixed it.
---
Your post implies Blizzard doesn't give a shit about Wild balance. That is false. If nothing else the Naga nerf proves that's wrong. They may not give as big of a shit as you'd like, or may not be as active as you'd like, but they do give a shit.
---
Good. I personally hate stupid OTK decks. But I can see how people like to play them. 
---
I have a gold and a regular Baku. Someone knows how many dust i will get for? 
---
/r/hearthstone has been begging to bring back solo adventures. Now that do they they complain about the cost and the reward. 
---
If they guaranteed legendaries you all would just complain about it being locked behind a paywall like you always did years ago. 
---
This update in my opinion shows that they have been trying to listen. Trying to implement ways to keep us playing (and paying..as they are a company and it is a card game).
---
I am overjoyed by this. I haven‚Äôt played very often the past months. I will absolutely play the adventure and solo content. I will absolutely play arena more now that it will become more interesting. And no more Baku and Genn. 
---
Random card backs, arena wins counting towards golden heroes, reroll legendary quests, better deck building options. These are all very specific things we have asked for and they‚Äôre giving to us. 
---
Team 5 and blizzard hearthstone time and time again have shown they really do care about the player base. I think it‚Äôs time we give them a little credit based upon how much we‚Äôve criticized them lately.
---
Do we know when this all starts to drop? I know the expansions are not until April I think? Is that when Baku and Genn are dropping out?
---
Craft Golden Baku for 3200, get 3200 refunded and then dust. Profit = 1600 ;)
---
Yeah, I know you get back dust refunds but there are plenty of cards that supported the odd/even decks. I kinda salty because I crafted jalanai not too long ago and it might not even be playable (much less good) anymore. Spending 16 mana to summon ragnaros is not what I was expecting.
---
From their description, this new adventure is going to be a lot more fleshed out than the recent ones. I imagine they're trying to turn it into its own full fledged game mode that people can devote more time to without almost immediately consuming everything it has to offer.
---
they did add some new classic cards after the previous nerfs. Shit cards, but still.
---
You can double your dust if you really want to. You can disenchant the card after the refund as well. 
---
&gt;It's similar to why Ice Block got HOF. It was never a problem until they made cards like Quest and Primordial Glyph.
---
Freeze mage.
---
And able to organize decks (drag 'n drop)
---
So if I craft the glitter moth and gloomstag. I can get 400 dust back plus 100 dust when I disenchant them? There is 100 dust profit then? ü§î
---
no \[whizbang the wonderfull\] to clasic set ??? ... biiiig disapointment :/
---
Seems free to do golden so why not?
---
Tempostorm, stats ....
---
If you're denying that Genn/ Baku decks make up a huge portion of the meta so be it.
---
I haven't looked too deeply into the cards being rotated out.  Current decks that I think are are not fun or interactive include Malygos Rogue, Meccathun Warlock, APM or Meccathun Priest...
---
Really great changes overall 
---
Maybe the only thing I can complain about is that instead of creating an ‚Äòachievements‚Äô bar they just made it so you can reroll special quests... 
---
That feature is useful for maybe only 1% of the playerbase. 
---
An achievements bar that stacks those special quests and doesn‚Äôt cancel your normal quest is what truly helps returning players and F2P play the game.
---
Idk , unless it‚Äôs really fun and has a lot of content I wouldn‚Äôt wanna get it as it just isn‚Äôt good value 
---
Seeing their latest single player adventures has me not wanting to get this ‚Äúrastakan rumble‚Äù especially 
---
The witch wood one was fun at first  but felt like I was rolling a dice to get the right treasure , did not want to replay it too 
---
Dungeon run was the bomb tho , played it for weeks when it came out and I find myself occasionally going back 
---
Hopefully they have picked up on the player feed back over the years on the pve content otherwise this thing would probably be a no for me 
---
his demonic cousins took the blow for him
---
Lich king ez 
---
The first one looks very draenei-ish, not sure about the rest. 
---
Why wouldn't you be able to?  I didn't read that you got a Golden Legendary.  If so, I revise my assessment and it is immediately worth it.  There was roughly a 1:1 ratio of gold to dust that reduced after Legendary pack changes.  But that alone will be worth 1300 gold if you dust.
---
Disenchant normal: 400
---
Golden Refund at rotation:3,200
---
Golden Disenchant:1,600 
---
By making a golden im making 1,600 dust.
---
Youre wrong
---
Thanks!  And I agree with your name.  Not a GoT fan, but yeah, the Starks ain't so bright.
---
Maybe, but the expansions would have to be smaller, or packs would have to be more generous. Otherwise you're asking the playerbase to suddenly drop a lot more money on the game and that's not the best move.
---
Could be, but if i go with vs data, it isnt played much and it isnt that good. Especially that it also needs relies on UI as carddraw/selfmill.
---
I would have like it until the hakkar card back which I'll be keeping.
---
If you play mainly Wild, all this crazy things get old and quite frustrating real quick. Take some broken Taver Brawls for example, it's exciting for like a day or two. I just want a normal, slighly more powerful format where I can play with all my cards. And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on this one. Maybe Hearthstone need more formats.
---
What would be the correct number? 
---
I could not watch streams anymore.
---
They were awful to watch 
---
They have shown they do, they nerfed patches and raza (even though they where rotating in 3 weeks) and thy nerfed flametounge totem even though even shaman was  not very popular nor oppressive  in standard but was one of the best decks in wild
---
I dont have that much dust, but I'm really excited to add to my collection. 
---
I really love odd mage as well.
---
Thank god. I was getting tired of standard, but I really wanted those 500 wins.
---
Except now you can experiment with mechanics you like and it will build a best case scenario deck around those mechanics for that class. Honestly really opens up the possibilities for casual players who don‚Äôt care about climbing ladder but just enjoy playing funky decks. 
---
Blizzard killing the only decks I played and had fun with, awesome
---
Ahh ok. so since you can on dust up to 1 copy of each legendary and  2 of each of the commons and epics. So I should craft golden copies of genn and baku, and the epics, rare, commons.
---
[Need I say more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usfiAsWR4qU)
---
Or just hall of fame maly.
---
You spend gold to craft golden (-3200 dust), get refund on rotation (+3200 dust ), then dust golden copy (+1600 dust), so you get +1600 dust and get to keep your non golden version.
---
If you don't spend gold to craft golden and just let your non golden version rorate out you get a (+1600 dust) refund and get to keep your non golden version.
---
Both get you the same exact result, so no reason to craft golden if you already have the non golden version. 
---
The only exception is common cards, which actually do yield a small benefit for crafting and disenchanting golden copies when you already have the non golden versions. (-400 dust) to craft, (+400 dust ) on rotation, (+50 dust) to dust golden version, and get to keep non golden version. Instead of (+40 dust) for non golden version rotating out and keeping it. So it results in (+50 dust) and a non golden version to keep instead of (+40 dust) and a non golden version to keep.  
---
&gt;It's 5 wings, one free and four paid. 700 per paid is 2800 gold to unlock the whole SP adventure.
---
I guess the main value in this is getting a bunch of free golden cards 
---
&gt; Though they are sending all the support even/odd to wild as well.
---
I know, what I mean is the problem with Odd/Even wasn't Odd/Even, but the Start of Game's powerful effects. So we may see reluctance on powerful and consistent Start of Game effects, but that won't stop them investigating Odd/Even in the future.
---
&gt; as well as keep Control decks in check especially with the consistent nerfs to combo decks (i.e. Aviana, Druid ramp). 
---
I play Big Priest, a lot, most "control" decks on ladder are OTKs or Kazakus that always roll polymorph.
---
Does that justify $20? No... no, it doesn't.
---
Well, I mean if you have the dust to craft the legendary, most people do genn and baku
---
If you already have them, you are getting the full dust value, which is what you would gain by getting rid now &amp; crafting golden.
---
For example, you have normal Genn. You are getting 1600 dust for it &amp; could DE for another 400. Gained 2000.
---
DE it now &amp; gain 400. Craft golden, lose 3200, which you get back in a month. You can then DE that for an additional 1600. Gain 2000.
---
&gt; It's similar to why Ice Block got HOF. It was never a problem until they made cards like Quest and Primordial Glyph.
---
Oof, I get your point but this is a terrible example to pick.  Freeze mage was unbearably frustrating to play against.  I have far more than enough damage to kill you - oops no you have Ice Block, preventing 20+ damage for 3 mana.  Next turn I again have far more than enough damage to kill you - oops no you have Ice Block again, preventing another 20+ damage for 3 mana.  Then you burn me down with spells from hand.
---
I hit Naturalize :) 
---
I hope we can buy all these heroes for $10 each! /s
---
He already has a normal one. HE WILL MAKE MORE by making a golden one, YES, but he will only get that dust back that he invested to CRAFT the golden one, all in all you make as much dust as you make with  the normal one IF YOU already HAVE a normal one LIKE HE DOES.
---
Closer to 400.  On average, a golden card is worth ~4x a regular card.
---
it looks like it has a golden unique 2 drop aswell : zayle , shadow cloak.
---
wonder what the hell it is but sounds legendary for sure
---
I honestly just don't get why people are so nostalgic for them. I always felt that they were an annoying chore to get cards that I would rather get from packs and dust. To each their own. 
---
But what did it cost?
---
So you're saying I should not craft them until they're just about to get HoF?
---
No. Only golden if you have both. 
---
I think in the article they said that it is not retroactive. 
---
If you already have the cards, there's no value in crafting golden and disenchanting. If you want golden cards, this is the best deal you'll get on them, but its only cosmetic value.
---
For example, assume you have Genn. If you do nothing, you get 1600 dust, and you have Genn.  If you craft a golden Genn for 3200 dust, you get 3200 dust back, and then you disenchant the golden Genn, for net 1600 dust, and you have a Genn. Same value. 
---
The golden upgrade (disenchanting normal Genn and keeping golden Genn), only nets you 400 dust, so it "costs" you 1200 dust relatively (it'd normally cost 3200 - 400 = 2800 dust, so not a bad deal if that's your thing). 
---
If you don't have Genn, then crafting Golden and disenchanting delivers 1600 dust vs crafting normal and disenchanting which returns only 400.
---
Commons are the exception because the golden disenchanting reward is 10 dust more than the normal crafting cost (whereas for every other rarity these two match). So you can crafting golden and disenchanting yields more than crafting normal and collecting the standard HoF return.

---
&gt;The first Solo Adventure in the Year of the Dragon launches about a month after the first expansion of the year, kicking off with a free chapter.
---
Sorry, I happened to see it through a reddit post a while ago. Its was on a podcast with HS streamers and a HS developer. And they didnt really say anything specific just that they are working on it and that it will be in the game sooner then we think (so probably the next expansion)
---
This seems OP.
---
This cycle was especially bad I feel 
---
EU 80g quest trade, Emilia#21719
---
What about if you're able to draw and have killed a Hakkar, the Soulflayer? Should keep his deck full. But there might be scenarios I'm missing. Unless the opponent is using galvanizer.
---
just some years for this, cant wait until 2022 so i can auto mute opponents
---
its gonna be 6 years this summer
---
Well in my opinion the feature will be used heavily and it will help casuals to rank up when playing against other casuals up until they start encountering people who either are just better then them or who built the counter decks to the  auto deck that the casual would use
---
God I'm so dumb, I always forget that just owning the regular Legendary is like crafting then dusting the golden version
---
I am dumb. So, if I craft a Golden Genn (-3200), Blizzard HoF's Golden Genn (+3200), I disenchant Golden Genn that I already recently crafted and which was HoF'ed (+3200) and re-craft it for a non-golden Genn (-1600) which nets me 1600 dust? Am I right? What do you suggest if I already own both in non-golden forms? do I not DE those?
---
But the discussion is framed by the Naturalise HoF, which won't take affect until the new set releases.  If you're talking about the current meta then Druid is doing okay - it is still seeing play on the ladder and in tournaments.
---
Then enjoy your free dust!
---
OMG, please HS team, we want a random shuffle of select card backs, not all of them.. rip
---
So we're just going to ignore all of the single-player content that we've gotten in the meanwhile then?
---
3500\* - Theres 5x wings at 700x Gold each but you do get 15 normal packs, 1x golden pack and the golden copy of Zayle
---
Calm down buddy. Its not a big AAA company we are talking about. You should be happy with whatever this small indy company is able to give to the players.
---
Thanks guys! 
---
Wait so if I craft Genn now it costs 1600 and I get 1600 back when it moves to hall of fame then I disenchant it cause fuck wild and I get another 400? So...  
---
**I can make 400 dust by crafting Genn now** **and then disenchanting when it gets HoF'd?**
---
only golden
---
Ah i was thinking in terms of cards that I don't own. Right now I'm debating if I want to disenchant my cards that will be rotating out. They don't see a lot of play for me and I don't plan on doing any wild. So I might commit to that once I get the packs from after the tournament to see what free packs I get. 
---
&gt; How would players be getting bored [...] TOLD them to hate Baku and Genn
---
I don't hate Baku and Genn, but god are they fucking boring to play and to play against. Each deck has very few flex spots due the limited card pool,
---
Have you considered that with the way the single player content now functions, players who don't want to deal with it will never have to while players interested in a much deeper form of story content will now likely get it.
---
What you will be paying for is the mode itself. The rewards that come with the twenty dollar purchase, twelve packs, a golden pack, two card backs, and a Golden Legendary card already available in the set, are ultimately extras on top it in
---
What has Activision done to you my love? 
---
You will get 3200 dust for the Golden Baku.  If you dust the normal one you get +400 and the golden one +1600.
---
This is the basic answer for every situation which are explained in depth below with examples ([full guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/)):
---
* If you ***have a golden copy*** of the card, do nothing.
---
* If you ***have a non-golden copy*** of the card you have a choice to make:
---
  * If you want to upgrade to a golden copy for free, craft the golden copy.
---
  * If you want to maximize your dust received, don't craft anything.
---
* If you ***are missing a copy*** of any card, craft golden.
---
* If you ***have a non-golden COMMON card***, craft Golden. (See **Example 1** [in guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/))
---
The dust is automatically credit to your account, without dusting the card, when you first login to Year of the Dragon.  (Expected April 3rd)
---
They mentioned the adventure telling the story of the new mage hero. They also teased it by calling it new (but familiar).
---
So... any old cards that could very well be a mage skin?
---
&gt; only
---
lol. And no, I just don't want to see another year of Genn/Baku meta and nerfs bi-monthly because of these cards. They basically said they don't know how to fix them, so they just removed them. I'm pretty excited.
---
I'm not sure I can go back to priest after Lyra and Shadow Visions and Frozen Custard elemental rotate.  
---
Un'Goro was the first time I really loved playing Priest.  Lyra Shenanigans for dayyyyzzzzz.
---
Disagree - in both 
---
In standard? lol.  Looking at latest VS data: 0.72% Odd Hunter, 7.73% Odd Paladin, 1.67% Even Paladin, 5.56 Aggro Odd Mage, 2.41% Odd Mage, 2.98% Even Warlock, 1.31% Odd Rogue, 3.25 Odd Taunt Warrior, 1.81 Odd Warrior, 0.66% Even Shaman.
---
Total of 28.1%. Also 3 of the 4 classes you name see basically no Odd/Even play (2 under 1%, one barely over 1%).
---
Shorter: just don't spend money on things that you don't like. This shouldn't require a PSA. 
---
That's how I keep reading it too. I bet his attacking voice line is "Stupid Noob!" and his come into play voice line is "Play me so I'm in play"
---
Oh, yes, you are right.  I was just counting Zayle and Golden Classic Pack.
---
Rogue is a tempo class at its core, and Prep is one of the most interesting tempo cards in the game, a staple of rogue's identity &amp; the combo mechanic, and has a high skill cap. I think the circle jerk of how much design space it limits is a bit overdone. It feels great to play, and rarely feels bad to play against (opinion).
---
he was , golden was blizzcon ticket, normal was free for evryone.
---
Yeah all the changes suck. Greedy blizzard. Not hearing to the community. At all. Brings back adventures but you don't have to pay since the legendaries are not exclusive and if you want to you get roughly same value as normally buying packs and free polished solo content. I can smell the greed. /s
---
They just made my decision to drop Wild completely so much easier
---
Uh...wild arena is coming in 2019, in a form. The first one will have Naxx and WotOG, among others.
---
I got genn in gold may aswell do baku XD 
---
I'd say Shadow Visions was the bigger problem.  But Frozen Custard Elemental was definitely a good card.
---
No guarantee that you'll be able to disenchant that golden legendary and it's likely you won't as it will be probably be treated as a reward card. 
---
There's also the question of the quality of the pve content which has been noticeably been trending downwards since Dungeon Run. 
---
Might be reasonable, might be not, but I suspect you might be being overly generous from what we know right now.  
---
just add whizbang to classic then, id take any legendary instead of a copy of him.
---
stop sucking Blizzard's dick
---
People generally bitch about how broke with UI is, yet even with it atm druid cant see play. They're not removing another core tool. They better add a UI on steroids next expansion if druid wants to even have a hope at seeing the light of day.
---
They're also in Standard. For now.
---
My odd paladin noooooooooooo!!!
---
Meh i disagree the old adventures where kind of fun but the replay value was pretty much nonexistent. 
---
I think you might be just a tad nostalgic. 
---
Or a matter of taste, to each his own i guess. 
---
Odd Mage is pretty damn strong right now.
---
and we know how that turned out
---
No they said it wouldn't be retro
---
I'm F2P and if I feel that my gold can either buy the same old packs OR I can buy single player "adventures" (7 packs worth) with only 3 packs rewarded after each one with the same probability of high (or low) rolling as usual, I'll stick with the former
---
Now is the time, they are basically free if you have the dust.
---
It doesn't come with a golden legendary.
---
Even shaman, even paladin, even warlock, odd rogue, odd paladin, odd mage, odd warrior...
---
Nobody:
---
Doomguard: "WHO DARES BANISH ME?!"
---
Even then, its still a golden legendary card that, if the PC Gamer article is to be believed, will be similar in function to Whizbang the Wonderful.
---
i dont mind any of the hof except baku and genn they shouldve been deleted or gutted adn the cards nerfed cause of them unerfed and hof'd. ANd they should unerf those and alot of other cards anyway.
---
So for 2800 gold you get 15 new packs and 2000 dust. Or you could get 28 new packs. The end goal is as much of the new cards, before you have to start crafting. 28 new packs is the better option for the average player.
---
It's all initial matches today and no winners matches A&amp;B today
---
The oposite? If im getting 0 dust from the normal copy, in dust terms, why should i not desenchant it?
---
I rarely play Arena, I struggled getting the runs to a level of sustaining themselves. I'm not even looking for great rewards, just a cycle of arenas. And now it sounds even more exciting than before. Plus I never played wild, so I'm excited to play with old cards again. And tbh I think a lot of people like me will start now which will make it easier to get used to it in a long run. 
---
It's not about now it's baout 1 or 2 years from now. They're gonna just keep getting more and more cards to power them
---
Puss in Boots Rogue more like it 
---
Sorry I phrased that bad, I meant the card effect is very powerful and would be broken at anything less than 4
---
I have over 7000 arena wins and no gold portraits. Been waiting for this for a looong time. 
---
**Tempo Decks** Are supposed to have a flow curve of high impact cards that take over the board and win by putting enough pressure so that the enemy doesn't have time to develop his game plan. Most popular tempo decks over the years have usually been Mages due to Mana Worm having so much snowball potential , coupled with burn cards that keep the Worm alive and help finish off the enemy.
---
**Midrange Decks** Kinda follow the same game plan as tempo deck, are more centered around dropping big threats on turns 4-8 and hope that the enemy can't properly deal with them. Over the years there have been many tempo decks, most recent probably Midrange Hunter that made good use of the unnerfed 5 mana Emeral Spellsone, basically a 5 mana 12/12 , coupled with Savannah Highmane , Scavenging Hyenna, Tundra Rhino and most notably Deathstalker Rexxar. They aren't as agressive as Tempo Decks due to lack of a snowbally early game minion like Flappy Bird (Vicious Fledgeling) , and not as passive as control decks due to lack of value generating cards and board clears (That's why Rexxar is so damn good, it does both in one card).
---
**Control Decks** Usually run a lot of reactive cards coupled with a lot of value generating cards. They win by running their opponents out of resources while they keep generating threats to close off the game. Most classes except Hunter had a viable control deck at some point in time, most notably during the Reno Jackson era. 
---
**Combo Decks** Their game plan is mostly stall and draw while trying to either build a combination of cards that can OTK (One turn kill) their opponent or make their lives miserable by either swapping their (almost) empty deck with their presumably not empty deck or fill their decks with shitty cards like Weasel Tunneler, Corrupted Blood etc. 
---
**Zoo Decks** They try to flood the board with many minions that are either hard to deal with or have the potential to get out of control really quick if left alone. Zoo decks have almost exclusively been Warlocks due to their ability to draw 2 cards every turn as the game goes on, most other classes don't have enough draw to afford to play such a deck. They usually focus on getting value trades and slowly chip away at their enemies health and use cards like Doomguard (RIP) and Soulfire to finish them off, if needed.
---
**SMORC Decks (Aggro Decks)** They play very strong early game minions, usually coupled with Charge , throw in there some weapons and spells that can go face and you've got yourself an agressive deck. The definiton of all in. It's been a while since we've had a pure agressive deck, most notably is definetely Pirate Warrior that had you killed on turn 5 on regular basis.
---
Must have changed the format then. Didn't hear anything about it.
---
yeah that's not accurate.
---
Let's say I currently have a normal Baku and 3200 dust to start
---
I craft a golden one.  On rotation day, I get a 3200 dust refund, and I still have both copies.  I then dust either my normal one (400 dust gain) or golden one (1600 dust gain)
---
So minimum gain from crafting a golden one if you have both if 400 dust, max is 1600 dust
---
The only way this is true is if you don't have Baku at all, in which case crafting it is just free, since you get 100% of your dust back.  
---
[[Gonk The Raptor]]
---
[[Duskfallen Aviana]]
---
We have our own Moorabis now. 
---
Sry, i should have been clear. Playing as mage VS rogue is really tough 
---
.
---
Folks in the thread about expansion teaser art are making some pretty good educated guesses based on the designs.
---
Dalaran for first expansion (Pink and magic.  Name a more iconic duo.)
---
Pandaren for second expansion (Though some people point out that it's not QUITE green enough to guarantee Pandaren.)
---
Dragons for third expansion.  (No argument here.  The question becomes if it will be Dragons + something else or not.)
---
I know you're joking, but you're not wrong. If they can't introduce new archetypes when they print cards to specifically support them, there are other cards that are too strong (or the support cards are too weak).
---
The ideal world is that there are 5+ viable archetypes per class at all times, and if you want that much variety, you need tree druid in the mix.
---
 So you want to replace Baku with Justicar?
---
Even in wild, they so seem to be on an absurd level. Maybe it's confirmation bias, but i feel like most of my opponents nowadays have one of these bad boys in their deck.
---
I have 7000 arena wins and 0 gold portraits lol. I'd easily have all 9 if they had done that from the start. 
---
That's just the first season though, right? Two months later, it will be a completely different set of expansions.
---

5/3/7 | On each player's turn, the first card played costs (0).  
---
Guaranteed cards are much more impactful.
---
In general it wasn‚Äôt as good since wild growth and nourish nerf, they got that stupid hakkar togwaggle deck that I‚Äôm glad to see go
---
Oh wow, you do get tilted easily. Maybe you should stick to a less stressful game like candy crush or checkers.
---
Is this all we getÔºü
---
Hey. I just was wondering, is this an out of season April Fools‚Äô joke?
---
Yeah. But since it has only 5 decks maybe it will be having multiple class cards in one deck. Just in his recipes. That's pretty nice IMO if that happens. I would love to have the card anyway though. 
---
I know, I'm just really bored with the game overall at the moment. I'm af the point of the cycle where I do my daily quests every 2 days, open a pack and close the game again. 
---
as long as you dont forget
---
Well, i like the shinning on them :B
---
1300 gold means 65 new cards. I prefer 65 new cards to a Whizbang-like card with no ranked play value.
---
6 years was a pretty good run for those playable classic cards. Hopefully that will open up new design space, which includes the ability to print charge minions in the future and not just ones with rush. 
---
Unnerf Wild Growth and Nourish and HoF the first with Naturalize. Nourish died for no reason but Naturalize was always annoying if you play control decks. Just like Oracle it was a certain mill most of the time. 
---
I think Gen and Baku will get weaker with time as more cards get released into wild, they're already not as impactful as they are in standard. 
---
The reason why I think that is because cards get better with time but the rewards from Gen and Baku are mostly static.
---
Dealing 2 damage for 2 is fine when it can actually kill minions, gaining 4 armor for 2 is great when it successfully stalls but later on it may not be worth giving up 1/2 the card library to get.
---
I do think it will take a while before they become obsolete and the warlock one is the only one that isn't static so it doesn't apply to even warlock.
---
I may be completely wrong though and I'm open to any different opinions / theories.
---
I'm also curious about what new hero skins we will get.
---
I would pay for a Mojo Stormstout skin in a heartbeat.
---
Everything's nice except more classic/basic rotations. Either rotate the sets and make an core expansion each summer similar to MTG or try to focus on changing other cards. 
---
Indeed!
---
Because Wild Pyromancer is still around. 
---
Golden Zayle is worth 1600 and for a new player, Whizbang is worth it. Basically, you aren't that much worse off.  
---
And I did the math, the average value of a Golden Classic pack is 470 dust.  At worst, it is 300 dust. (4x50 dust,1x 100 dust)
---
Because standard doesn't have the overpowered cards to deal with them, which wild does.
---
I'm confused about something. I thought a new "Year of" meant all cards in the previous year will be rotated out. What is with the Genn and Baku thing then? I thought they are already rotating out. Why does it say "a year early"????
---
Plenty of opportunity left.
---
I think wizbang should be added to a core set, but zayle could still be cool depending on how they make the mechanics work. I think Wizbangs decks change recipe from expansion to expansion but it what if Zayle had its own permanent unique decks, such as a deck that uses cards from different classes such as mechs from hunter, warrior and paladin, or dragons from priest and warrior? 
---
I'm not sure that's quite the same as adjusting the barrier of entry for the game. I get where you're coming from - I quit Hearthstone and only came back when Dungeon Run was a thing which I found really interesting, so it's a way to bring in new players or bring back old ones - but, unlike old adventures, if you don't buy the new solo adventure, you aren't going to be behind anymore than you otherwise would since it's, essentially, just buying packs. 
---
Adventures are back?!? YESSS
---
I like how all of these decks have two time firefly's (and have since that cards release) yet you think Baku's the problem. Funglemancer and Stonehill defender as well are stronger cards that are seen more often than Baku and Genn. 
---
If you're complaining about games being stale these should be your targets just given their play rate. 
---
But Odd rogue's high winrate is in part due to it's good matchup against Odd Paladin, but also rogue loves firefly (which is rotating out anyways).
---
And Odd Shaman is just fair. Really I've never seen a more fair deck in my life. 
---
Oooh, i get what you meant to do, yes, i like to keep the golden, lul
---
As compared to the price of decks now which is probably more.
---
r/woooosh
---
U need to apply to work at blizzard 
---
I love Slay the Spire, but I don't think that is an apples to apples comparison, particularly when you can spend gold on the adventure. 
---
ah yes, a meme as old as time
---
A - You can still play odd/even in wild, so craft away.
---
B - You can‚Äôt discount people‚Äôs opinions as ill informed without knowing how they came to those conclusions. For instance, I took the data you presented -30% of decks are odd- and came to a different conclusion than you did because we are both making a value judgment using subjective standards.
---
I get that you are frustrated and need to vent. You can do that without insulting people, or claiming that your opinions are more factual than others.
---
But you are both assuming that you can disenchant the golden legendary which isn't guaranteed.
---
I agree I don't like the design of Genn Baku very much. Being infinite value at the start of the game. 
---
But just print strong competing cards that don't offer such little counter play. 
---
Blizzard won't do that though because they're lazy. 
---
i see 3 mage specs
---
Who rode to Whiterun from ole Rorikstead...
---
You gain 5k dust, you lose 12 decks.
---
=D Thank you!  I spread your comments around to the rest of the art team and they were all really stoked as well.
---
If you're playing a game as an investment you're doing something wrong. Games are entertainment for people with too much time and/or money. 
---
A lot of cards are annoying. But you can t take away the last good thing that class had left lol.
---
I'm confused. I thought they were rotating out anyways because they are year of the mammoth and it will be year of the dragon? What am I missing?
---
inb4 people commenting , a good version of this article...  
---
anyway with this quote
---
&gt; However, moving them to Wild lets people who love these cards continue to play them, which is the whole purpose of Wild, to play these cards that they love. So we decided to move them to Wild, put them in the Hall of Fame, where I think they'll have a good home there.
---
maybe someday they will revert warsong commander and just hall of famed her since in wild, the patron deck would probably get murdered anyway long before it can dish out the combo , or there is enough card in wild to disrupt the combo. other than that maybe they could change it to rush like what [[Houndmaster Shaw]] have, rush doesn't seem so broken compared to charge.
---
Kinda sad its still only 3 sets. We in forbthe stale metas again boys. Honestly bumping it up to 4 or even splashing in adventures would shake things up. Like magic has 5 per year im not asking for that much cause i know its a lot of work but 3 is way to little things get boring fast espe ially if you have 1 lame set as we saw with The last one.
---
It's technically profit to craft them since you get dust back and are able to disenchant them afterwards if you don't ever plan on playing wild
---
yes and you still keep the cards
---
&gt; If only Baku and Genn were played half as much as Undertake was you might have a point.
---
[Oh the irony](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-111/) (UH peaked around 43%)
---
&gt; People who complain about the meta have never actually looked at the meta, let alone compared it to past meta's.
---
It would appear these people know more than you
---
Does this mean that we should all craft those 2 hall of fame cards since blizzard will refund us the dust when the hall of fame rotation hits??
---
Naturalize is going because skulking is rotating. Mechathuns would be everywhere and mojomaster would be the new ziliax

4/3/6 | Your other minions have Rush.  
---
So they can get laid off?
---
Legendary weapons too. Those enabled a ton of archetypes. 
---
God damn I just got Baku and crafted an odd rogue deck :( I guess it's for the best
---
Read - the - post.
---
nope
---
I mean, mill rogue is a bigger problem than mill druid. Mill rogue can burst mill like 24 cards in one turn. I get why they hate that, but it's just a problem in wild, and it probably always will be.
---
But mill druid has never been a strong deck. Naturalize is the only reason people try to make it work.
---
You need to wait untill the year of the dragon or play wild. The last few months of any year is really boring to play as everyone uses tier one decks 
---
When are they gonna reveal the next expansion?
---
Is multiclass really exciting for the players? I recalled there was a bit of backlash with the tri-class cards in Gagdetzan. Too homogenous experience with 3 classes playing like 1 with less diversity in cards. Or just the pain of having to play around even more cards outside a class, like losing to a Twisting Nether after playing around 2 Flamestrikes.
---
On one hand, using Prep as Mage is hella fun, but on the other hand fighting against a Mage with Prep sounds awful.
---
You can make 0 gold at minimum a day.
---
That 100 gold you can make from 30 wins takes a long time.  A 'Tier 1 win rate' is about 55%.  That means it will take an average of 54.5 games.  At about 7 minutes per game you're looking at 6 and half hours to get that amount of gold a day.
---
Come on the card was REALLY good but never game breaking good. The fact it's still playable probably says more about Paladin's other hard removal options that, apart from Shrink Ray, are pretty mediocre. The nerf was probably to ensure that it wouldn't make it into tempo oriented decks anymore while also keeping it's viability for Control, which l think is pretty reasonable.
---
If the first one isn't the Violet Hold, then cover my chest and call me Jaina.
---
There's one card from the new adventure.
---
It is in addition to the expansion.
---
It's "Dungeon Run"-style.
---
It rewards 16 packs, one card, and a card back.
---
I loved adventures and played a whole bunch of DR/MH/RR, this is the first for worse reward or the second for 20$/2800g instead of free. I hope I'm wrong but this "back to old adventures" seems to just be "buy 15(28 with gold) packs get some content." I'm all for content but buying packs has never been worth it, adventures *were* because you knew what it had and the ~5 legendaries were guaranteed.
---
Yes. Everyone wrote the same thing but multiple times. So did I.
---
So same rules still apply, right? I can ensentially craft Goldens of all of these for free?
---
I have a meme deck that activates her no problem with spirit and fire eater
---
Naturalize is not good hard removal. It is bad hard removal that is mainly used as a combo activator, and only in an extreme niche deck as actual removal.
---
You wouldn't have gotten more free dust. HoF cards only give you back the dust value for the max number of playable cards rotating that you have. ie 2 copies of non legendaries and 1 copy of a legendary
---
They will always be available to play,just like the old ones are for those who bought it. Just take your tine to complete them.
---
If they where to remove them they they will say something. 
---
1.) So are you going to elaborate at all then? Or are you just implying they should keep the old prices and just give even more cards?
---
2.) Yes they can. I do it pretty much every expansion when I start new accounts to test out the new player experience. There are always competitive budget decks that serve new players perfectly well that can be easily built with all the bonuses available to new players nowadays and the wider selection of available cards. You can have a few in your first *month* without excessive grinding or disenchanting.
---
3.) They really don't. I'm not sure how you manage your resources but it sounds like you don't know how to handle them very well. New players get a bunch of free packs and guaranteed legendaries early on. From there, any F2P player should be opening upwards of 80 packs an expansion which is plenty to build multiple meta decks every expansion.
---
4.) It's very telling that you don't actually address the point this all stems from and just repeat your baseless insult. You got all angry and made a flawed comparison, someone called you out on the flawed logic, and now you're resorting to insults because you can't defend your original claim.
---
My eagerness for new game modes the only thing holding me back from running a billion dollar gaming company 
---
That and I only know html 
---
Except they‚Äôre a company who needs to make money. Asking them to not try to make money off of their game is silly. 
---
&gt;transform 
---
Does transforming Mechathun affect their Floop?
---
Not that foolishly, you will get full refund
---
What's zayle?
---
there is still that 1 mana deal extra 2 damage card, i have been using that in my control mage deck, odd deck also run that card since it can provide good burst. it works just fine. 
---
Just watched the video. Fluff comment, the new Executive Producer looks like a 40 yo Heavy Metal fan. 
---
I like him.
---
u/GenericLunchbag
---
The question is will the new alternative heroes be added value like cards like the 3 we have now, zuljin,boom and hagatha without an op hero power or will they fuck up and make an op one. I mean they have to make 4 new heroes after they made 3 class heroes right?
---
It probably won‚Äôt be able to be played on curve, but Ragnaros is still a ridiculous finisher. Think it will be a Hail Mary for big spell mage. 
---
For free since you get the dust back. And you can dust the regular for 400.
---
Have you finished yet?
---
No but demonic project would, and loatheb would also stop the spell for a turn 
---
Yes, I play both Wild and Standard and almost every class and I regularly have to delete decks to make room.
---
Whats scary about it? The data will be bad, better decks can already be found online.
---
Unity. Presicion. Perfection.
---
Tokens. Not that significant *right* now, but token druid has always kinda worked, and sometimes been top tier.
---
When are they going to be rotating these cards from wild???
---
i'd say $20 bucks for some quality single player content you can always return to and play mostly as is (if you look at dungeon run the reno style buckets can have new cards in it) as long as hearthstone is still playable. Plus 15 card packs of the new expansion, a golden classic pack, and a golden legendary. As the current rate goes $20 gives you 15 card packs anyways so it is a special deal in a way, but you don't even need to pay $20 as you can just use gold.  
---
Ice block is still strong in Wild, being included in all mage decks I can think of. Honestly, which mage deck does not run Ice block? I hadn't thought about it, but can't think of a single one now. 
---
It gives you an extra turn to burn down your opponent or set up a combo. Considering how fast wild can be, this is a serious advantage. 
---
If I craft Genn before the HoF rotation, will I still get a dust refund?
---
No DKs, no missions, no Baku and Genn. Perfect.
---
Now I hope they don't include some other toxic cards in the next expansion.
---
Actually I assumed that they would push the Pandaria theme, and thought that everyone was fanboying over the newer races.
---
Wait, does that mean I get the full dust value of Genn and Baku when they get sent to the Hall of Fame without me having to enchant them?
---
Which means I could basically craft golden Baku for free?
---
And its the perfect timing. With death knights rotating out, your opponent drawing 7 cards for 3 mana can once again be game winning.
---
All HoF cards give a full dust refund without needing to disenchant. 
---
Im not saying let us build our own decks without restrictions, but it would be dope (imo) to have some flavorful meme decks that utilize themes across different classes. Like a Mage thats focuses on getting as many spells off as possible, maybe if have cavern shiny finder and dragon soul (If those cards werent going to wild)
---
I just started playing in November. I crafted my very first legendary card less than two weeks ago. It was Baku the Mooneater.
---
I think the biggest giveaway here is the fact that they said the single player adventures throughout all 3 expansions this year will tell 1 overarching story. Combining that knowledge with the color schemes and designs, it seems almost obvious that the expansions will have the following themes:
---
1- Argus before the Burning Legion invasion
---
2- Draenei/Broken survivors on Draenor
---
3- Horde invasion
---
Hearthstone = Fisher Price: My First Card Game
---
My theory is that Toki the Time Tinkerer is going to be a central figure in the upcoming expansion. In the playhearthstone article they mentioned how the events in the upcoming pve content come from the perspective of a mysterious and new (yet familiar) Mage hero, which could easily refer to a Toki from a different timeline. 
---
The developers also said that this year the expansions will form a year long narrative, which implies that the events that take place in the first expansion will eventually lead to the events in the second one and conclude in the third one. 
---
With that in mind the bronze dragon vibes given off by the third image can act as an indicator of time travel being done throughout this narrative. Furthermore, this time travel concept would explain the arrangement of runes on the first image, as it bears a passing resemblance to the face of a clock. 
---
But maybe I'm just too far off my crazy pills...
---
So the new PvE adventure is basically 700 gold for 3 packs per wing, or $20 for 12 packs?, that seems bad...
---
I would love an improved mobile app, but all these changes sound great for the game. There‚Äôs still a lot they need to do, but this is enough to get me excited about Hearthstone again for now.
---
More robust discover cards might solve this problem.
---
Thanks. Suppose I have just one normal of a non-legendary and no goldens, should I still craft the other one golden. Yes, right?
---
Yup, let me edit the comment
---
Yeah i literally just said that.
---
filthy casual try 4,880 dust not counting dissenchats
---
DooM#13660 NA
---
I show first, you complete first
---
bloodyface FTW or I guess FTP (for the pack)
---
they always gave a third of an expansion at best. 
---
Needs the common card exception?
---
cya buddy
---
Yeah actually I have to agree with that. No idea why that card doesn't attract more attention
---
Can we expect new "card types" in the new expansion, such as Hero Cards or Quests? 
---
I‚Äôm not a blizzard apologist but the rewards along with packs seems like all of it is well worth it. Including if you‚Äôre a F2P player because it gives you a free whizbang. 
---
These articles have information not in the official post.
---
For example, details on the more intelligent deck builder.
---
So now they are charging tor single player content AND not giving cards for it? (Whisbang knockoff doesnt count)
---
Dark moon fairie, uldum and bronze dragonflight
---
Ah, I took as if we disenchant them to mean half value.
---
When it says arena sets will rotate twice per expansion... Is that from *all* expansions? So we can get that Juicy GvG, KotFT, WotoG arena?
---
700for 3 packs. fuck off Blizzard
---
3200 for the baku. then you can d/e it for 1600. D/e the regular for 400. = 5200
---
Yay more pay2win!
---
Poor Glitter Moth and Gloom Stag have seen no play and are already retired, poor sods.
---
Burn
---
Don't forget to log in just before the rotation too if you want to craft any Hall of fame cards you don't have for free or want to upgrade ones you do have to golden at a discount.
---
Arent you supposed to announce the announcement of the announcement of the AMA?
---
They must have realised everyone does it already
---
You're just required to buy two hundred packs instead.
---
Ok I need clarification. Right now I have both Genn and Baku. If I craft golden variants of them will I get dust back for the golden AND regular copies or just the golden/regular?
---
Then all the more reason to remove from Standard. If a card sees play in every deck of that could potentially want to play something like it, then it is pushing out other possible designs from seeing play. It's like Ragnaros the Firelord or Sylvanas Windrunner
---
Druid has had a massive problem since the beginning of playing a core set of about twenty cards at any one time in just about every deck. The only way it can be remedied is by changing the cards that will never rotate like Wild Growth or by just straight up removing them from Standard.
---
Druid is seeing play right now though.
---
&gt;These decks have all been super powerful for just as long as they have been in standard and honestly are even more powerful in wild to the point that if you're not playing one of these decks your only other strategy is to resort to insane mana cheating through combos like Barnes/Resurrect, Thekall/Molten Giant, Voidcaller/Voidlord etc. This creates super high roll and frustrating games that are often decided by either the incredible consistency of your upgraded hero powers or the insane high rolls you can achieve with the aforementioned combos.
---
&gt;I'm all for wild being a playpen for insane broken combos but Genn and Baku create the same problem it did in Standard. The games are too much the same, and the decks are too consistently powerful to beat with any strategies that don't involve insane high rolls that are just as frustrating to lose to. 
---
I feel like this is the crux of your argument, but one I just can't see happening. In a card game, all eternal formats (even Modern in M:tG) have these insane combos, ridiculously fast aggro (which is largely what Odd Rogue and Paladin are) and extremely durable control (Reno Lock/Mage/Priest). Wild has always had the destiny of being an insane format, and it is finally reaching those levels.
---
However, deleting or changing Baku or Genn won't really do anything to change that. Wild has to be a format where you fight unfair stuff with your own unfair stuff. There's a line things cross that make them too unfair, as pre-nerf Patches, Naga Sea Witch and Raza were (alongside pre-emptive changes to Shadowboxer, which prevented what surely would have been an insane deck with Magnetic). 
---
Baku and Genn are extremely powerful in multiple decks in Wild, much as cards like Reno Jackson and Kazakus are. However, if we got rid of them, the same strategies would still be around. For all Odd/Even decks other than Shaman, there's already a broken combo version of it if Baku and Genn cease to exist (which you listed alongside Big Priest as "insane mana cheating combos" in the format). With the recent nerfs to Cold Blood, Kingsbane Rogue is the most ‚Äúconsistently powerful‚Äù Rogue deck in the format, replacing Odd Rogue.  There‚Äôs legitimate argument over whether Odd Paladin or Thekal Paladin is better. And Cube Lock, though somewhat different than Even Lock, still wants to crush you with a huge army of cheap things. 
---
Wild has a plethora of archetypes that can do well on the Ladder, and I think this is an important part of keeping it an interesting format. Baku and Genn help with that, as you‚Äôre never quite sure exactly what kind of deck you‚Äôre facing even after seeing the class. Even if they were gone, Wild would still have a boatload of other decks with insane consistency, infinite engines or ridiculous highrolls. 
---
My true hope is that Baku and Genn themselves become more diverse with the printing of future sets. There are 18 decks that can be built, and with each set, the outline of a successful Odd Priest or Even Hunter becomes more visible. If Baku and Genn can help 18 diverse decks make it to the upper echelons of Wild, the format is richer for it. And besides, if they‚Äôre truly insufferable, there‚Äôs lots of room for changes, both in terms of tech cards (ala Mindbreaker) to help dampen their power, spot nerfs (as Cold Blood was) or something even more exotic (nerfing them as Hall of Fame cards, but only giving dust to those who have played a Wild game before the changes to ensure the dust doesn‚Äôt just go to hoarders who don‚Äôt play Wild).  Baku and Genn are fine for the format, with the potential to create more powerful decks in the future (and serve as a great budget entry to Wild, now and forever). I strongly think that Hall of Faming them and possibly changing them later is for the best, should that truly be warranted. I feel like acting like Wild is a ‚Äúdumping ground‚Äù as a result either misunderstands eternal formats in card games or is asking for something far lower in power level than Wild currently is, with changes needed far beyond Baku and Genn (the ‚Äúinsane mana cheating combos‚Äù you listed). Still, it‚Äôs important to ask for dev feedback, so thanks for raising the issue!
---
Druid (below rogue) seems to have something resembling a candle shown. Could a kobold druid even be a thing?
---
&gt;I have spend over a thousand dollars on this game since 2013
---
You are the problem. Good job.
---
I mean, as far as you know it could be. You have just as much idea as I do. We know it‚Äôs a dungeon run with the cost of an adventure and worse rewards. The downsides are known, the upsides are not. 
---
So sure, maybe they chose to talk only about the downsides and not include any information about the upsides compared to the PvE content of previous expansions. In the promo.
---
Why is no ice engineer (or maybe loot hoarder also) a bad decision?
---
They arguably already are super oppressive in Wild.
---
Just to be clear, someone correct me if I'm wrong here: 
---
- If you already have 2 copies (gold/non gold doesn't matter) then you're good to go. Don't do anything. You end up with the same amount of dust.
---
- If you don't have 2 copies, craft them in gold until you have 2 copies. You will receive their crafting cost back + have the option to DE them. 
---
For example, I have 3 regular black cats and 1 golden black cat. So I do nothing and get the full HOF benefit. 
---
I have 2 regular doomguards. Again, I do nothing and get full dust benefit. 
---
I have 0 glitter moths. I craft both in gold and get their crafting cost back + I can DE them. 
---
I have 1 golden gloom stag. I craft 1 golden gloom stag bring my total to 2. 
---
Note: Don't do this until april! You might open up some of these cards with packs which would be even better than crafting.
---
Well I unistalled it by the conventional mean because in the amazon appstore there is no unistall button on hearthstone it only says open
---
Nope, he'll stay with us through year of the dragon
---
No. Not this close to an expansion release. Save your gold 
---
I play priest typically. I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by mana curve? Do you mean have more lower mana cost minions in your deck?
---
Just the golden. You only get a refund for 1 each. 
---
Do the hieroglyphs in the teaser image actually mean something or is it just gibberish?
---
If I learn to decypher hieroglyphs for that and it doesn't mean anything, I'll be mad
---
But the method does work, as envinced by every other CCG in existence. 
---
I just want to add that it's only net zero if you DON'T already own a non-golden copy. If you DO, and you craft a golden one to keep, you are also costing yourself the 1600 dust which otherwise would have been given to you for having the non golden one in the first place, which makes for a net loss of 1200 after disenchanting the normal one. Not a bad deal as far as crafting a golden goes, but if you dont want to lose dust period, it's not the way to go.
---
They literally stated that Equality got nerfed to 4 because 3 was too strong regardless.
---
So no.
---
The only reason Azure Drake ever dropped off of decklists back in the day was due to Sludge Belcher, and it came back immediately once that rotated.
---
this is what you get by being greedy and wanting to have "ez win" against everybody. 
---
I have 4800 dust but i have non-golden genn and baku, best thing to do for me is crafting golden glitter moths and gloom stags right?
---
Can someone explain why crafting a golden is a benefit? Wouldn't it just be a wash once you get the refund?
---
I never really got into arena but I'm honestly excited to get into it now. I think they picked some really great sets to kick off the new system. 
---
135 card sets are overrated though, there's a lot of filler on those packs. 
---
&gt; gate an entire expansion behind a paywall 
---
What are you talking about?
---
you're an idiot, aggro decks are disgustingly broken in this game. Nerfing even/odd is basically nerfing mostly aggro decks (except odd warrior and evenlock), and could not come any sooner. Do you even play the game if you think aggro is weak????
---
Great work!  It's such a dynamic composition.  I love how you get a bit of a narrative in there--I can't help but try to fill in the blanks (How'd the murloc get there?  Is the Corpse Flower just playing with him, or is dinner?)
---
Also, technically, awesome work on the tongue and the Corpse Flower's nose (?) and nodules--that's some great highlighting!  Likewise, the background is both spooky and does a great job of efficiently suggesting a dense jungle.  But, it also doesn't get in the way of the main image.  Solid work!  Hope you make more!
---
As someone who pretty much only plays Druid with Naturalize in my deck this is a bit of a bummer. Removes Togwaggle decks and massively hurts Druid's removal.
---
Plus, you know, the content.
---
It is significantly bigger than the free adventures though. I prefer the option to pay for a good Adventure rather than feeling I need to buy in for the meta cards
---
I was about to disenchant to of them recently. Then I thought that Genn and Baku are surely gonna stay for another year, so it's gonna find some meme place eventually. Good that I kept them. 
---
You get reimbursed for a maximum of 2 cards, with golden versions being prioritized. So if you have 2 regular versions and 2 golden versions of Doom Guard, you are given 2x800 dust. If you have 2 regular and 1 golden version, you are given 1x100 + 1x800 dust and so on. 
---
Im so confused, its unreal.
---
I got Greymane in non Golden, but i do have 32.000 Dust to craft a Golden Version. Do i craft a Golden right now? Is it correct that if i craft a Golden Greymane, and when the Rotation hits, i get 3200, and i STILL have that one Golden Greymane left, that i Dust for 1600 Dust? I literally have no idea what to do ¬∞_¬∞
---
still, I don't get it. So it was a "free" 2/2 or 3/3 in the worst case. Any control would just AOE that trash.
---
It's more that Druid's win con is so difficult to interact with that giving your opponent cards really won't threaten your chance of victory.
---
13 packs for 2800g, right?
---
One of those packs is "special" and hard to evaluate how good it is.
---
Turns out you also get a golden legendary (new whizband) which was not in the original announcement I read. Still don't think it's worth it.
---
If you look at the packs for the first Expansion, it's very dark. I truly believe it's a Theramore/Bombing of Theramore themed set. 
---
Nice analysis, thanks. I wasn't considering the golden legendary at the end. 
---
&gt; 135 card sets are overrated though, there's a lot of filler on those packs.
---
They still have far more impact than Adventures.
---
&gt; What are you talking about?
---
8,400g for an 135 card expansion with a ton more PvE content.
---
That's not going to happen. It makes no sense for Blizzard to go down that route. It's a pipedream.
---
That's not terribly accurate.  The power level is  insane in vintage but so are the answers.
---
The change to Equality had nothing to do with Odd Paladin. Odd Paladin is not a deck that would have wanted to play Equality. It is too reactive of a card, and situations where it would be useful in are all better served by cards like Ironbeak Owl and Void Ripper.
---
He's not blaming anything for his decks.  He's making the extremely valid and unarguable point that net-decking leads to less-fun matchups as a whole.  
---
LOL let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Tog druid is tier 1 now, but even and odd pally are definitely the top decks rn   
---
[Sethrak Shaman and Vulpera Rogue](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/20NJS1QNU2JU1551306604231.jpg)?!!?!? New Allied Races maybe?
---
I will play that snek forever.
---
Such a great leap. They must have been coding this tirelessly for years. I remember people asking for this 4 years ago and they finally made it! Who said Blizzard doesn‚Äôt work tirelessly to give us what we want? 
---
I crafted big hand mage and it‚Äôs dope. Nothing will convince me otherwise 
---
You get the dust for the Golden legendary only since you could only have 1 copy of it in your deck, you get the dust for 2 non-legendary since you can have 2 of them in a deck. 
---
I'm surprised they didn't HoF Malygos. Rogue and Priest OTK rely on him.
---
I've wanted rotating arena sets for ages, once every two months sounds good.
---
That will be the surprise gift they give at the close of the Year of the Dragon so it can both start and end on a high note for Kibler :-).
---
A year paid by me cuz you cant keep your legs together? Yea really want to strive towards that. /s
---
Welfare heaven. 
---
Its called personal responsibility.  People act like the government has lots of money or something. They dont make money...they take money.
---
It was pretty fair in Zoo even when you did find yourself discarding. And busted in disco zoo. 
---
Kibler was great
---
You can disenchanty it as well to get even more dust
---
Either that or they would have simply mentioned year of the raven. I think it's great the way they planned. Finally I feel motivated to get into arena! 
---
&gt;I'm certainly excited to see how all the cards from the 2018 block that haven't seen any play might finally become relevant.
---
Same here.  This is what I'm maybe most excited about.  This last expansion was the least fun I've ever had in the couple weeks after the expansion, because it was obvious that there were so, so few cards that could be incorporated into good/decent decks.  I tried.  Oh, I tried.  But, the OP expansions that are rotating out are going to, hopefully, allow a lot of re-examination of cards from the last couple expansions, and I'm really excited about it.  
---
1.) So basically make the game less accessible for new and F2P players. Got it.
---
2.) You disenchant a handful of the valuable but impractical cards you're guaranteed as a new player opening packs from sets for the first time and then you craft them. Pretty simple.
---
Now you're adding an arbitrary meta deck for all nine classes to what a new player should strive toward? Even established players don't have the time or a need for that. Why force such a specific and impractical requirement? You're just artificially inflating the requirement to make the new player experience sound more difficult than it is.
---
3.) My point was the current system provides F2P players with enough gold to build multiple meta decks each expansion. Switching to adventures doesn't change everything else we've been discussing, nor does it address the other problems that Adventures brought to the game.
---
4.) Adventures had duds too and the difference there is players are turned off from disenchanting those cards leaving new players who grind out adventures with little to no disposable dust to craft what they need to actually build decks. Meanwhile, with expansions, players have access to craft individual cards they need. You ask if new players will realistically disenchant legendary cards, but if they actually look into how to best make use of their resources, then it's clear they should almost always disenchant some. Part of the reason even established players think the game is more expensive than it is is because they're overly conservative with their legendaries and epics, holding onto them in the hopes they'll get more value down the road but essentially diminishing their value over time.
---
I'm tired of explaining how these things work while you keep contriving scenarios to defend a side point to the main point this started with which you refuse to even acknowledge anymore.
---
You'll excuse me if I borrow a page from your playbook and just stop responding. There's really no point in continuing if you just want to keep making stuff up and evading the point.
---
As you've acknowledged these special events to be "legendary quests" why not introduce a new section for legendary quests, and not have them block the 3 daily quests?
---
Kibler was gr
---
Hey, do I get the refund for the golden AND the non-golden legendary card or just for one of them, because only one is playable in a deck?  
---
And now that they've justified having 3 expansions a year by saying that adventures are free, they're selling the adventures separately again. I guarantee that the adventure content this turn around will feel generous, but the main motivation will be to shed a good light on the additional paid content so that they can continue to sell more later.
---
That said, I am not saying it's the worst thing ever, but I am not going to thank Blizzard for letting us pay more.
---
Craft\*
---
I don't see why zayle is worth 1000 gold
---
I‚Äôm just happy because I packed golden Genn and golden Baku... then after the announcement I crafted some golden glitter moths for my odd priest.  9600+ dust incoming
---
I have a feeling with wild growth nerfed they will feel comfortable printing really busted 2 mana cost ramp now. It makes sense honestly because now it won‚Äôt just be ‚Äúomg wild growth on 2‚Äù... the decks will vary more as expansions are released. 
---
Switch that symbol around my dude if you want to mean you're winning less than 1/5 matches.
---
Sure, it's not good, and if i stick it out, i'll probably win that match but it's super not fun. 
---
The bracket spreadsheet says the opposite btw.
---
A deck can never have too many Chillwind Yetis. It's pure value.
---
I don't have a source for the 43%. THat's from memory
---
And your original statement was "Baku and Genn" not "Baku or Genn" so I take that as they're together. Especially given that they're both being Hall of Famed for the same reason. Doesn't make a whole lot of a sense to view them differently when they make the same types of decks.
---
And the highest percentage I saw was about 27% which is still more than half of 43% which until I see different, I'm going to consider a point well made. 
---
Who cares? I imagine black people would care about comments like these. 
---
As the owner of a golden Gloom Stag, this is very serious business

You missed all the elekks in the history bar. If you‚Äôre going to make a bad outdated meme do it right

For legendaries it's just one, so if you have both versions it's only the golden one.

This is pretty cool and something I've personally wanted to see them do. Finally see a better variance in cardbacks during play. Not a major deal but something fun.
---
Seeing as how the 3 packs we get from the first free wing will most likely be considered the free packs we get with every new expansion, I'd say they should not count for this argument.
---
So at this point we are paying 1.600 gold for solo content, a Whizbang-lite that very few players would use for more than the initial hour of novelty (so basically 1.600 dust), a pack that will most likely end up in 300 dust and a couple of cardbacks. I think the solo content is going to have to be pretty damn good to make people choose to spend gold on it instead of the main game mode, because even if the 16 packs you could have bought instead wouldn't hold anything substantial, they would still bring you closer to the pity timer for epics and legendaries. Though if you're a free-to-player, you ironically need these 16 packs anyway to fill your collection with rares, since if you're anything like me, you just get 40-50 packs per expansion, and in such cases every pack counts. The 1.900 dust you get from the Adventure is not nearly enough to cover it in such a case. And of course, all of this is without even bringing up a comparison of how adventures USED to be, where for the *same amount of gold* as this, you'd get ALL 30-45 cards of what was basically a mini-expansion, packaged with a nice adventure to boot.
---
However, my biggest complaint about this new Adventure system is not even the economy. The thing is, because the pack rewards will be given at the end of a wing, and wings are released weekly, this means you will have to hold off on crafting any non-legendary cards from the new expansion for a **full month** if you wish to avoid the risk of opening duplicates. This means not playing what you want in the first two weeks of an expansion where the potential for fun is at its highest, because you will have to keep in mind that you would have 9-12 packs waiting for you in the following weeks. This is insulting for a free-to-player who has to manage his dust carefully in a game that has gotten increasingly expensive for the past couple of years and it just makes me say that most people will be better off just spending their gold on the packs instead.
---
OMG that would be amazing. Normally I don't care about my cardback (I just switch to whatever my newest one is, to keep things fresh), but this would make me actually care about getting new cardbacks. Great idea.
---
And having fun with the new single player content...

---
Best hearthstone news in a long time. The furute for this game is looking good so far
---
I don't quite believe all the hate for these cards is that valid.  These cards were literally designed to be the cornerstones of even or odd decks, which was literally one of the defining features of one of the set they came from. 
---
They also represent about 1/3 of the meta which is roughly what you'd expect.  To day these two cards are broken is like saying that singleton decks were broken or that magnetic decks are broken.  
---
Not only that, but the way people talk about these cards, you'd think that all even/odd decks are the same, but that's absolutely not the case.  Odd rogue is way different than odd paladin which is way different than odd mage, which is way different than even warlock.  
---
If you don't enjoy playing PvE content then yes, it does. If you do enjoy it however then it very much changes the value calculation. 
---
&gt; Are those amounts worth it to you? Answer, 2800 gold or $20 should, 3500 gold will probably not be.
---
And the answer to this question should compare the value from 4 paid wings to the value from not paying for wings. I don't think (from your analysis) ~2500g is worth 28 packs from a new set (greatly inflates dust value per pack).
---
&gt; Old decks that never really worked in the past have a much higher chance of becoming competitive after rotation:
---
Y'all think my tess togue deck will finally be tier one? &gt;:)
---
Are we seriously considering the possibility of Handbuff Warlock in 2019? You've seen how shit the handbuff cards are in every class.
---
Also, except for Cubelock (in which the truly offensive card was Cube), Doomguard was never a key piece in a deck. It was only ever a good card. Really, the problem is that Warlock has all this Demon synergy and they will basically have no viable large Demons in Classic (or even in Standard) after rotation.
---
Draenei / Exodar, Ulduar / Vyrakul, Cataclysm.
---
First has purple, white, and gold, cornerstone colors of the Draenei. Not sure of the rune as it looks like Dalaran but I think they want to fool us. Second looks a lot like Titan stuff. The resemblance to Sargeras' armor makes me think it could be a pre-Space Satan Sargeras' but I might be pushing my luck. The third could very well be a Cataclysm theme with the tooth, dragon soul thing, and fire at the top. Some are saying Mag'har / Iron Horde, but that would be contradictory to the first set. Draenei and Orcs have a history together so it would make sense to mix the two. The picture also does not give any tribal Orc vibes like fur, primal weapons, shaman imagery (elements), tribal paints, etc. With that said, an alternate universe Gul'dan hero card would be perfect.
---
This is Right.
---
Yeah, that's definitely a problem. Glenn and Baku for all their problems were really cheap decks to build. F2pish blew a ton of dust on the decks and while they'll get the refund it won't be enough compared to the overall deck. Unless they come up with new archetypes that are cheap to build the skeleton with like even/odd (unlike some other very legend dependent archetypes which has been the trend) players are going to hemorrhage
---
Dude, this isn't that hard to understand.
---
You implied that there's something wrong with a company trying to earn more money than they already do. I said basically every company does this, including the ones you buy everything else from. You said you like to "attain things in full."
---
See that last part? That's *you* comparing two different products and models.
---
I'm not arguing against myself, I'm arguing against your compete lack of understanding of how business works. You can't make a valid criticism against something you don't understand. Posting a screenshot of a conversation you don't understand in your own personal subreddit of lost arguments is so fucking pathetic.
---
Netherspite?
---
*tadaaaaa!*
---
Looks really good! Make me one! 
---
Bet bliz learned their lessons on this one.
---
Or you could give each class a monk shrine, like the shrines from Rumble Run. Or a quest which illustrates some monkly rite. They can definitely come up with something, if they decide to.
---
Looks like Draenei/Argus for the first. Second looks like Titan something and last i can't rightly say- The Iron Horde from WoD? 
---
Mr. Shiro, I don't feel so good.
---
Hearthstone is a card game.
---
Baku, and to a lesser extent genn, make it a hero power game.
---
I'm expecting a new hero as a preorder bonus for the new expansion.
---
Good, building decks has always been my least favorite part of this game. To the point where I never play a brawl if I have to build a deck. Just tedious and uninteresting (to me).
---
Right.  You get your choice between a dust bonus or a "free" upgrade to golden + 400 dust.  You can't get both options.
---
People don't like that they often result in similar turns and can generate tons of value by the late game without relying on any cards in hand. The hate got excessive over time, but I think the early move to Wild will make Standard a lot more interesting on top of rotation.
---
Boomsday was mech focused and there weren't many (or any? Can't remember) mech supports in the expansions after, so far at least
---
Whi is this being linked to Hearthstonetopdecks instead of the official hearthstone page?
---
I wasn't aware Gloom Stag was staple and/or OP? :P
---
Yes, if we look strictly at the value of the cards received in this game mode it's pretty much the worst model they've released in terms of cost. However, Team 5 isn't trying to sell you the cards. What they're selling is the solo play experience. If you haven't liked the previous ones and you don't care for this one then there is close to 0 reason for you to spend money or gold on it. However, for players like me who have enjoyed previous solo play modes then what we end up paying for is more of that, especially if it's a better experience. 
---
In fact, if you pay gold then you're getting 16 packs for 3500 gold, which sucks. But, if you pay with cash then you're actually getting a discount since 15 packs costs $19.99, the same as buying the adventure.
---
Well, that all the luck you get for the rest of the year...
---
It really is a great idea since there's no interaction in the game ^^^/s
---
well we got 1600 instead of 400 for normal,and 3200 instead of 1600 for golden
---
Second one definitely reminds me of Elegon from the Mogu‚Äôshan Vaults raid in WoW, literally a titan constellar dragon. 
---
&gt;(except odd mage).  
---
Because of this - everyone has their hated deck and these cards really limit design space imo.  
---
If you could buy Naxx now would you say it costs 2800 or 3500 gold for all 5 Wings?  It's 3500 because the promo to get the first Wing free wasn't infinite.  The rate changes depending on if you login (presumably in the first 2 weeks) and get that promotion.   **Not everyone will**.
---
The gold is equivalent value and we are using minimum values for packs here (assume you get no new cards).  If you get new cards, the rate goes up.
---
&gt; In average a value is worth more than 100 dust. In average.
---
Depends on what average. You're using the mean average, which is *just* over 100. You can expect to open this much dust per pack if you open a very large amount of them (upwards of 100 packs). 
---
The median average is a better estimate when working with small data sets. This is so that an unlikely event doesn't skew the results. 13 packs, for example, is less than the average number of packs to get a Legendary (barring the guaranteed Legendary in the first 10 packs of an expansion). Considering that the pack with the Legendary contains around 400-500 dust, it heavily skews the results. 
---
If I opened 13 packs right now, the dust values could be either of 
---
40, 40, 40, 55, 55, 120, 70, 55, 40, 40, 215, 70 (total 840)
---
or
---
420, 40, 40, 55, 55, 120, 70, 55, 40, 40, 215, 70 (total 1220)
---
Notice how the total dust jumps up by 380, or almost four whole "average" packs just because one of the packs contained a Legendary? Because of this, the mean average for small sets gives *either* a small underestimate or a gross overestimate from what will actually happen. Conversely, the median average (I'll ballpark it at around 65, I don't want to go try it) will usually give a small underestimate, but sometimes you'll be pleasantly surprised. When calculating stuff like packs needed to craft a specific Legendary, it's usually better to calculate with the median, unless you're opening something like a 60-pack pre-order. Sometimes, you'll highroll and pack the desired card, but if you lowroll you won't be disappointed.

Year of the Balls ‚Ñ¢
---
Black Cats isn't bad in regulat mage. R.i.P
---
Well it's the fact so many decks use them. There are two different odd mages, two different odd warriors, odd paladin, even paladin, even warlock, even shaman, odd rogue, even rogue. And these decks have been so strong that we've had two expansions in a row where basically nothing changed and a whole standard year where very few new cards were played.
---
It's just these decks are everywhere and as the devs said, each game plays out very similarly and people are just bored of it now and to have another whole year with the same thing because odd and even decks won't really get worse, they just improve as better odd and even cards are added and the deck building "restriction" stops being a restriction leading to just a strong start.
---
Except you HAD to get the old adventures to be competitive. Now they‚Äôre 100% optional. If you‚Äôre not interested in single player content... don‚Äôt buy it. 
---
I didn‚Äôt get Naxx because I was excited to follow the storyline or play a shitty AI...
---
Can someone explain to me what the ‚Äúhall of fame ‚Äú is like does that me it goes to wild or what?
---
They‚Äôre going to start charging for the pve content. And not a little. Splendid 
---
I'd assume a Pandaria expansion's featured color would be red, no?
---
9 new Death Knights confirmed
---
Exactly.
---
Full cost of crafting and you can disenchant it
---
You make a profit, but it's just (I believe) 10 dust per common card. It's probably not worth the chance of screwing something up to do it. For example, if you mess up and disenchant the gold copy before the dust is doled out on rotation (and people do this pretty much every time.)
---
&gt;Do you apply this logic to everything you buy?
---
#
---
&gt;You can't compare completely different products sold via completely different models and expect it to make any sense.
---
explain to me how this isn't a contradiction.
---
&gt;Dude, this isn't that hard to understand.
---
i couldnt agree more
---
&gt;You implied that there's something wrong with a company trying to earn more money than they already do.
---
i've already dealt with the stupidity that is this argument, but i will reiterate, "ruining a game to boost margins is defensible to shareholders, not to players." is this a blizzard shareholder subreddit or a hearthstone subreddit? this question is not rhetorical; though that's not to say i have any expectation that you will answer it.
---
&gt;I'm not arguing against myself, I'm arguing against your compete lack of understanding of how business works.
---
shareholders still aren't players
---
&gt;You can't make a valid criticism against something you don't understand.
---
more ad hominem padding for your comment to try to make it harder to have an actual discussion
---
&gt;Posting a screenshot of a conversation you don't understand in your own personal subreddit of lost arguments is so fucking pathetic.
---
just endless padding, stick to the topic please
---
Literally Playable...
---
While it is fun to craft decks around them, the top winrate decks are just boring. Heropower every turn. They are too consistent and it doesn't matter what you or your enemy draw, it's always the same gameplay.
---
It'll be interesting to see what kind of data we can glean from it and how it compares to VS and HSR.
---
tehvik#2322 EU Still looking for 80g quest trade since yesterday. You challenge first.
---
Yeah, it was weird they didn‚Äôt announce one. Every year since mammoth has gotten one. Maybe closer to release? 
---
More to the point the first set of every year has been thematically linked to the year.
---
Year of the raven: witchwood.  Spooky forest.
---
Year of the mammoth: un‚Äôgoro dinosaurs, mammoths, sabertooth tigers and whatnot
---
Year of the kraken: whispers of the old gods with multiple tentacle monsters.
---
(Technically there were zero krakens in year of the kraken.  There‚Äôs only been one kraken and it was TGT).
---
Thalnos is a great card, fits in a lot of decks don‚Äôt know bout higher tho...
---
And even if you don't want to disenchant, you're basically getting a free golden copy instead of a free regular copy. So, unless you're really scrapping for dust right now, why not?
---
On the image that shows what is included in the pve content there is a picture in the upper left with the words, "Choose your deck" on it. In the background of said picture is a star design that is very similar to the specific star design we saw on the Magic of Dalaran cardback.  
---
The statement above is one I can get behind!
---
Anyone who is on this reddit reading this news within hours of its release and questioning to themselves, "Is buying the single player content worth it as opposed to buying straight packs?" is going to log on to take advantage of the free promotion.
---
I just think you need to clarify your OP to not be misleading a reader's conclusions who will fall in the above scenario.
---
It is worth 1,000 equivalent gold because you can get 1600 dust for it.  Every gold coin is worth 1.6 dust because of the we did above.  So the gold value of 1600 dust is 1,000 gold.
---
Lol how have you got 11?
---
Oh okay, thanks for the clarification - I was ready to DE them, this is better I suppose. The DE value is only full when cards are nerfed, not HoF'd then I guess.
---
BRM and LOE are the only real money I‚Äôve spent on the game. So like, it worked, but man is this model better for me. 
---
It is 10 dust and if you screw it up....you probably didn't read the guide.  Gauge your own risk aversion, or read carefully, and make a choice.
---
Why can't they be good? They'd be finished decks anyone can find the decklist for. There'd be no issues with things like not knowing what to play around because they can have cards from any class.
---
Hey this was me earlier. I just wanted a minion on the field. 
---
I don't understand why you think you'll be able to open a duplicate legendary.
---
But it‚Äôs replayability isn‚Äôt yet known. I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending 700 on it if I could run through it a couple dozen times with games that feel meaningfully different. 
---
Otherwise it‚Äôs a tough sell, for me
---

---
I would definitely have goldens if it counted arena, but I'm kind of happy that it starts now. Hearthstone has so few milestones, I'll be happy to work towards that as a goal, and would be rather dissapointed if, rather than feeling like I earned them, they all just plopped onto my account for past wins. 
---
Yes, it goes to Wild.  And instead of nerfs (where you dust the card for full value), you get the full value back in dust automatically when you first login to Year of the Dragon.
---
You actually only need to *own* not complete all five wings. Source: me, who wrote the piece for PC Gamer.
---
You do need to complete all wings on normal and heroic to earn their respective card backs though. 
---
Oh and you will also be able to craft the non-golden version of Zayle, I guess if you don‚Äôt want the solo content.
---
I'm speaking mostly on how I feel after hitting top 10 leaderboard late last year, and not having the urge to play 30 runs ever again. For constructed you at least have HCT points to grind for, which may lead to exclusive cardbacks like Golden Celebration and tournaments. 
---
However small it may be, I just wish there was something similar for consistent arena players. 
---
Some of us play wild, and we're just as tired of every other game being a genn or baku deck. It's a long term problem for that format.
---
How? Wouldn't you just get the same amount of dust back from the legendaries you enchant? 
---
If it is Kirin Tor/Dalaran I expect them to do an academy for magic and you are the student or something
---
Might introduce bunch of non-damage spells that get improved by spell damage.
---
You would get 6400 dust back (for your gold copies).  And then dust the gold copies for 3200 dust total.  So your total profit is 9600 instead of 3200. (if you dusted them now).
---
Everything about 1. screams Violet Hold to me. Which is on Dalaran so very likely.
---
So, i have somewhere around 6k/7k dust right now. if I have no interest at all in playing Wild or keeping any cards that will only be in Wild, what is the best action to take? Do I just craft all Golden copies of all the cards being rotated?
---
You can't possibly know that yet. If the single player content isn't better than what we used to get from adventures or what we currently get for free, it's definitely not worth it. Now we get it for free, so anything fun is good. Before we paid for it, but we got multiple legendaries and didn't have to spend gold/money on packs for an entire expansion, plus the content was good, so it was well worth it. This needs to be vastly more content or much, much more interesting and unique content to make it a good deal for us. We're either paying for what we're getting for free now or paying for much less (card-wise) than we used to get.
---
I missed Naxx promo.  It happens.  It's over a month away.

Well stop accusing people of whining and crying when they are pointing out an obviously unfair system. This is the Hearthstone subreddit, shouldn't we be able to point out negative aspects of the game without being accused of pandering?

You actually get double value. You get to keep the cards and you get full dust. So you can play them in wild or you can dust them for regular dust returns. 
---
For me, especially with Baku, it's because they're over played
---
Warning: I'm normally not a theorist or a lore keeper from WoW but with a bit of research I've hatched my own half-baked theory about what the expansions could be along with the possible story and felt like ya'll would want to see. So sorry ahead of time for how sloppy this is since I've never done this before but I hope you all enjoy!
---
First expansion: Definitely think it involves the sewers of Dalaran. There was imagery of the sewer in the announcements [here](https://i.imgur.com/tN2wUNl.jpg) behind the Choose Your Hero Screen and that's a little fishy. There also seems to be some weird cult or evil group look going on by the eye in the triangle and since this seems to be a Dalaran based expansion, they likely originate from the sewers since that's where the shady stuff mainly happens. The only other possibility is Violet Hold, the jail inside Dalaran. Besides that, not much else I could grab from this lore wise and hard to make a bridge to my ideas of the second and third expansions.
---
Second Expansion: Definitely something related to [Uldum](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Uldum) (possibly [Ulduar](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Ulduar)). Uldum has a lot of Egyptian themes along with a similar [color scheme](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/008/546/502/large/diana-kon-halls-of-origination-randd-concept.jpg?1513462534) to the Expansion 2 panel.  I also found [this image](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/125925.jpg) of Ulduar that has a similar rune (2nd from the bottom on those two columns) to the one on Expansion 2's panels. Both Ulduar and Uldum were created for similar purposes so the same runes popping up isn't impossible.  It's interesting too because Uldum holds The Forge of Origination, a device created by the Titans to regulate the planet and if it became too corrupt it would destroy every living thing on the planet so it could start over. This seems like something a evil group would love to target and use for their own evil purposes.  
---
Now this is where my theory gets a little wild so strap in folks.
---
I believe this evil group is [The Twilight Hammer](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer) re-branded to try and bring on [The Hour of Twilight](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Hour_of_Twilight) (The Hour of Twilight is where all the dragon aspects die which would allow the Old Gods to come out and destroy the world \[or whatever they're in the mood for that day\]). This wouldn't be the first time The Twilight Hammer has re-branded them self to gain traction and followers. They did this before in the Pre-patch to WoW Cataclysm, they were known as the Doomsday Cult. This also would work because The Twilight Hammer has previously interacted with both Uldum and Ulduar before. Twilight Cultists were found in the Ulduar raid in the [Descent into Madness](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Descent_into_Madness) portion and they have been seen at Uldum trying to turn the Forge of Origination into a super weapon to destroy all life. The Twilight Hammer is also heavily involved in WoW: Cataclysm
---
With my previously stated ideas, logically the third expansion would be in relation to Dragon Soul, The Hour of Twilight, End Times, some form of Cataclysm, etc but nothing in particular points me that way besides the color of the gem and the burn/claw marks at the top of the panel. It seems similar to the themes of [Vyrkul](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vrykul) (possibly [Iron Horde](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Iron_Horde)) but I'm unsure.  Could also be a tie into the [Firelands, Druids of the Flame,](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Twilight%27s_Hammer#Cataclysm) or [Blackrock Caverns](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blackrock_Caverns) since they all were involved with The Twilight Hammer and the panel is simply just wood burning.
---
That's the end of my half-baked theory. Like I said, I'm an amateur to this so take it easy on me because I'm sure there are plenty flaws in my logic but it's what I'm sticking to now. Feel free to provide other input or ideas! 
---
I agree, you vote with your wallet. That was the whole point of this post - to get people to stop purchasing and hopefully put some pressure on Blizzard to make it a little better for consumers. 
---
In general, rotation will be weaker because there are less cards available and most stronger cards (historically) are printed at the end of the year.  Because 2017 was a massive power creep, there should be a sharp relative decrease in power.
---
but in the scenario where you disenchant the legendary anyway so that it's a real comparison to my scenario, you end up with the 5200 anyway lol they both end at 5200
---
hmmm, maybe I just got really unlucky, but I played maybe 10 rounds as shaman, I got Keleseth several times, but I simply could not stay alive past like turn 6 about 75% of the time. The deck has great cards by the end, but I kept getting steamrolled so early on, and since my totem only has 3 HP it's so easy to kill.
---
Good point

Yes, that is the next step. It is just disappointing because I really enjoy the mechanics of the game. 
---
I think the second one is more likely having to do with the Sethrak or Vol'dun in general as it fits the color scheme of something like the \[Temple of Sethraliss\]([https://c-4tvylwolbz88x24nhtlwlkphx2ejbyzljkux2ejvt.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3\_c-4dvd.nhtlwlkph.jvt\_/c-4TVYLWOLBZ88x24oaawzx3ax2fx2fnhtlwlkph.jbyzljku.jvtx2fdvdwlkphx2faobtix2f1x2f11x2fAltwsl\_vm\_Zlaoyhspzz\_svhkpun\_zjyllu.qwnx2f8957we-Altwsl\_vm\_Zlaoyhspzz\_svhkpun\_zjyllu.qwnx3fp87j.thyrx3dpthnl\_$/$/$/$/$/$/$](https://c-4tvylwolbz88x24nhtlwlkphx2ejbyzljkux2ejvt.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3_c-4dvd.nhtlwlkph.jvt_/c-4TVYLWOLBZ88x24oaawzx3ax2fx2fnhtlwlkph.jbyzljku.jvtx2fdvdwlkphx2faobtix2f1x2f11x2fAltwsl_vm_Zlaoyhspzz_svhkpun_zjyllu.qwnx2f8957we-Altwsl_vm_Zlaoyhspzz_svhkpun_zjyllu.qwnx3fp87j.thyrx3dpthnl_$/$/$/$/$/$/$)).

The third one looks more like it could be either maghar orc related or dragonmaw clan related but I think Iron Horde is possible.

3/2/4 | Your Battlecries trigger twice.  
---
as someone that has every seasonal card back ever, this is pretty cool
---
Sorry I'm not familiar with cards rotating and HOF'ing how does this work? Do you get a refund for a card in HOF but you can also dust it after this?

You can do the old infinite combo in Wild using [[Dopplegangster]], so the combo is still viable there.

5/2/2 | Battlecry: Summon 2 copies of this minion.  
---
You get a full refund for the card, AND you can disenchant it.
---
So for example, if you crafted Golden Baku.  The HoF would come around and refund the 3200 dust you used to craft it, but then you could still disenchant it for another 1600 dust.  By crafting Golden Baku, you effectively printed yourself a free Legendary of your choice.
---
However, this only counts for the maximum *playable* copies.  You can only play 1 copy of a Legendary per deck, so even if you had 2 non-gold Baku and 2 gold Baku, you would still only get the same 3200 dust from the HoF as if you only had 0 non-gold and 1 gold Baku.
---
Let's say I already own a regular Bakku. If I craft a golden Bakku, wait for the rotation to happen, and then dissenchant my golden Bakku, don't I end up making 1600 dust for free?
---
Only if you don't already have them, though.
---
Will Dragon+Raven be weaker than Raven+Mammoth and Mammoth+Kraken? We don't know but it is likely since Raven was designed to be more toned down in power.
---
Will new Decks arise after the rotation. Yes. Remember Deathrattle and Secret hunter kinda sucked until Year of the Kraken rotated out. The rotation will kill decks and make room for low tier decks to rise in the open niches.
---
If you have the non-golden copy already and do nothing, you get the same 1600 when HoF hits.
---
How is 2771 gold value for 3500 gold not a bad deal, or am I completely missing something here?

Your company has seen some major restructuring, your stocks in the tank, your main breadwinner is dying, the self propelling community outreach that is twitch has collapsed and... oh hey its expansion season. Time to open up temporary communication to feed the hype then go dark again for the next 3 months.
---
No, you make 0 profit.  See Example #4.
---
Also Marin the Fox could not be disenchanted.
