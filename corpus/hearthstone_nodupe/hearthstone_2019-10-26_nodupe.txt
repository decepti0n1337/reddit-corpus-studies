I love his decks too but some of his plays make so little sense that I can't watch his streams without breaking my keyboard out of sheer frustration.

Still hell of a chill, likeable guy though. Love him to bits.

I guess Togwaggle signed a contract with Rakanishu and he stays inside the lamp and being sealed underground, in the dalaran heist, he can get out of the lamp and he was much larger than he was underground. In SoU he has a crown and he has grown muscles. I believe that he is the last plague lord of flame.

Nice

I just don’t get the appeal people have of just copy and pasting deck codes and playing those decks without making any changes ever... what’s the point of playing this sort of game if you’re never going to tinker around with anything?
---
Personally I actually like the meta right now, I’m constantly going up against quirky and unique decks and not the usual 4-5 variations that just beat everything that people just copy and pasted online.
---
Proper scamazing
---
Rank 5-L is the worst for try hards Shamaning.
---
We get about 11 variations of this same complaint post every day, fair to say you're not the only one who's noticed it...
---
Yeah, those times you emote oops and you avoid doing it the following turns...
---
If you use Senace or Faceless on a minion that had its cost reduced it'll have its original mana cost
---
nerds for communism

Thanks.  I really had no idea.  Seems like it needs to be updated.  New players need some help

Welcome to Hearthstone 2019

The same as the odds for getting any other combination of cards.

I agree with the intention but this is the wrong target.

Heart breaking.

Ok ok. Fair enough. It is partially related. Let the system deal with it. The HK topic died in this Reddit. And this post will just be buried.

You can try talking to mod or becoming one, then do what u feel like.

Does anyone else think that the murlocs in Hearthstone have been getting more and more cartoony and off-model? For example, a lot of the art depicts them with their eyes on the front of their face, rather than the sides. Kobold art has been getting pretty ridiculous too.
---
And jebus they have *so many* of both species in their cards now. I swear the next expansion will be called "Nothin' but Murlocs and Kobolds".
---
Did I fucking ask you goddamn gypsy
---
Will you fix the Hong Kong bug where Blizzard doesn’t support basic human rights?
---
Damn that's long, but thank you for communicating with us. It's nice to know that you're working on it.
---
Whatever stats it has, I was thinking of something like "Deathrattle: Equip a 1/1 Primitive Spear".
---
I think you made great points!  I'm still sticking to my hopelessly optimistic mindset that opponents will know I mean well when I WP/GG.
---
Pretty sure no one asked you to stop Hitler by yourself. Hitler was stopped by millions of people fighting for human rights. Any one of them could have taken your apathetic approach and said 'I'm not gojng to make a difference so why bother'. Fortunately, a lot of humans are not that apathetic and are aware that lots of people making a small contribution can have a large impact.
---
We've already seen this in Hong Kong, where the protests have led to the extradition bill being retracted.
---
I get the feeling the code may have been a little spaghettified since launch.
---
Nice.
---
I always get the 3 mana 5/19
---
For whatever it's worth, I tend to use WP to mean "This game did not leave me hating you, your deck, or Hearthstone itself".  The same circumstances I'd tip the opponent, if that were an option.
---
On those occasions I win, there's rarely enough time to respond if I wait for the opponent to initiate a WP.  Which leaves me feeling bad if they do say it.
---
I think there is something to be said of understanding personal bias in this case. There are some problems I have with the argument that people, especially winners, shouldn't emote because the other player might take it the wrong way, due to the game's inherent anonymity. So, my main problem is arguing people should conform to their opponent's potential feelings. I want to stress that I understand frustrations with emotes, and I don't want to invalidate anyone's feelings. However, I think that people need to own their own assumptions and try not to put those on others. If you assume people emote in a sarcastic matter that is on you. Sometimes you'll be right, sure, but always assuming that your opponent is a sarcastic asshole is very pessimistic and is going to really get you anywhere positive. So, if you take someone greeting at the beginning of the game as negative and/or sarcastic, that's not on your opponent or the game, that's on you, and you need to take that in and either accept or challenge it.

&gt;Imagine an algorithm analyzing a Chess board after every single move and telling the player the best move.

Chess players use engines to analyze and improve their game

I dont ”cry” about it, i wonder why people are downvoting it as is the truth, and I am not a trump supporter that was just an example you donkey, a joke going around though is “orange man bad” which is kinda funny since you said they didn’t appreciated the “orange” jokes.

Looks somewhat similar to my reno/zephrys c'thun quest shaman ive been playing in wild. Lots of fun, this one probably too!

Classes in HS are just a suggestion

So much for that never forget hk stuff

akmsbda#1532 EU looking for quest trade, i show you go first
---
I fatigued him on normal with elise... basically i got a jade idol off of a raven totem and the rest writes itself
---
Yeah
---
I've played tons of games in competitive settings for 15 years (online and LAN) and I've never had any discussion of this sort. Honestly, I've never been exposed to this concept until Hearthstone emotes. It's either people letting some bad winners influence their perception of all future opponents that beat them or they're being sore losers. I get it if they emote spam or rope. I even understand being miffed if they emote 'hello' or threaten at the end, but getting triggered over "Well Played" is beyond me.
---
Congrats man, also got legend the previous month.
---
His answer is correct though but I think when you play the 2nd Floop, the 3rd Floop will turns into Elise.
---
Don't know. I guess the missing heal and mass removal makes it weak in the early game. But with the right draws it's probably the strongest N'Zoth deck. I mean what other deck can compete with 10-15 N'Zoths in a row... And ofc it's also weak to combo decks. But that's the same for every other control-ish deck.
---
Nobody's saying this meta is diverse.
---
Yogg-Saron value
---
That's basically it's worst matchup. Not to say it has many good ones, but no halfway competent Quest Shammy should ever lose to it.
---
From 4 to legend I only faced 5 shamans
---
"wish for the perfect card" ??? What does that mean? Sounds like it should be in r/customhearthstone ...
---
yes
---
I play Barnes...

This is why you only ever play quests in ranked. Way less intense and competitive than "Casual."

Its definitely not all androids.

Very true.  After that it is much easier.
---
Did he concede? I am always playing till the end no matter what but I would consider conceding here
---
It’s a dick move but really not a big deal, plus it was a casual game so if it’s getting on your nerves just concede and move on.
---
Maybe he was secretly tired of it and this was the push he was waiting for.
---
 Nothing last forever.
---
The cards, armor, and 5 damage don't really matter this early in the game, so it's basically a turn one 5/5. Nice but there must be more stats you can cheat out with this method. Call of the wild comes to mind, 5/4 taunt, 5/3 charge, 2/4. Power of creation? What one spell summons the biggest board.
---
holy wrath paladin
---
You’re actually so dumb, you really think you being some random citizen deactivating their account is gonna do anything to help the people fighting for their rights in Hong Kong.  You’ve still spent your money on their products, and they probably have a backup of your information anyway, you deactivation all of this stuff is pointless and just gives you a free negative karma farm because you chose to post your political views on a fucking dying card game’s subreddit
---
It’s insane how much pride you feel calling other people bad for not doing anything when in reality you’re really not doing anything either
---
Ok all that is great, but they are still babies and wrong
---
Isn't it 40% chance to get either one of the 2 and then a 1/4 to get the remaining 5/5?

Firestone has many deck-building achievements that promote building unique decks based on restrictions :) Hopefully the app is a big hit with achievements and Blizzard takes note, it's something the game has been missing for years along with a sealed format.

No .. you are so far off base. You have begun applying other principles and unrelated circumstances. None of this has to do with the underlying sentiment of the whole topic. I do not condone violence or being an asshole but I do condone the process of maturation and growing up.

No where on this thread was I out of line, calling people names, or making slanderous statements. 
---
Im sorry to say this, but you are in over your head.Also your priorities are out of line, feelings and emotions should not be at the top of the list. Maybe your not cut out for this life
---
Craft decks not cards.
---
Already saying that, Baku and Genn are great though. If you get reno you should also get zephrys since both will be always used in the same highlander decks. Baku and genn decks are way cheaper (and even shaman and odd rogue are better tier) than highlander decks too, so take that into considerantion. Also, Genn/baku decks are more or less already known (odd rogue, odd paladin, even shaman, even warlock) while highlander can be played in more classes and their decks are more felxible. Other thing is most of them being viable, but for sure they will eventually print more highlander payoff cards, while more odd/even cards are debatable seeing how baku/genn ended up.
---
Is this rank 20? Zoolock is a deck that controls the board through value trades. What are u talking about
---
Are u playing at rank 25 man? Zoo is a board control centric deck. If you never used doomgaurd to help get thr board then u were playing zoo very badly sorrry to say.
---
nope godfrey is better
---
Unfortunately they are not bleeding money now, because the upcoming spending row is when the new set preorder appears in the shop. On the other hand we, who can't play now, are losing gold and progress daily worth between 1--2 packs from the new set. However, there is no mention about any compensation, and honestly at this point I lost faith it won't happen with every upcoming major patch.
---
I had the same thing happen with a rogue minion that copies a deathrattle, when it died it just resummoned itself. I think the name is unearthed raptor?
---
What? Is this a joke?
---
You are saying an aggro deck is a "board centric deck" that doesnt use their charge minions to hit face??
---
Whats next, saying pirate warrior was a heavy control deck?
---
There's  a thing known as a proxy which people use to represent cards they don't own. It can be text on a card or just a regular printed paper stuck onto a card. They are usually only used for testing decks with cards you don't own or in a friends playgroup
---

---
I was talking about Legacy or Modern and you can compare it to hearthstone wild if you want.
---
I actually completely respect this line of thinking lol
---
Usually the bugs are a different order of complexity. Random crashes can be very hard to diagnose if it's a race condition or something similar. This would be hard to pinpoint
---
Malygos is card that finds some kind of combo deck to call home almost EVERY expansion. The power level of these decks vary quite a bit, tho. If you like the idea of playing these kinds of decks, keeping Malygos and waiting for your collection to grow will pay off.
---
All chapters give 3 uldum packs
---
The very fact Doomgaurd has the drawback it does pretty much excludes it from being used in a straight control deck.
---
A control tool, as is a card that would see consistent play in control oriented decks without any help, is one that would be capable of at least trading one for one in card advantage. 
---
Doomgaurd has a floor of minus two since if you use it to kill an opposing minion, you'll have taken away one card from your opponent at the cost of it and two other cards.
---
any additional rewards like golden common cards etc?
---
If u complete everything you get a golden pack
---
GG these nuts
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
The pros all literally play the same decks with, generally speaking, at most a couple tech choices. Very, very rarely does someone bring some random as homebrew deck.
---
Are we making up definitions or pulling them from somewhere?
---
A control tool - tool used to control. In this case the board. I feel like thats as simple as it gets.(im not trying to call you stupid just simplyfing it so we can see where we disagree. 
---
I am aware that doom gaurd would never be played in todays xontrol decks.but that doesnt mean it can't fit in the future with who knoes what cards and meta comes next.
