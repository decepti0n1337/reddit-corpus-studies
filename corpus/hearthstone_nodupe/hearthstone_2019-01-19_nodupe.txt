The difference between the druid meta of last year and the current meta is that druid had almost no weaknesses. Druid had great armor gain, great draw, great removal and spreading plauge. Hunter has really bad draw and can’t restore health or gain armor outside of minions and basically only has tracking as viable card draw. When the DKs and Rhok’delar rotate out hunter is gonna lose a ton of essential cards which is almost gonna make the spell hunter decks unplayable.
---
This post almost feels like you’re just complaining to complain. Like come on are secrets suddenly a problem or have they been buffed secretly because i can’t recall hunter secrets being a problem earlier. And what does it matter that you meet the same deck twice? Shouldn’t it be easier because you can learn from past mistakes and already know their deck list. There is always going to be a class with more meta decks than the rest. If you nerf hunter another class is going to take it’s place. 
---
I will not be trifled with!
---
Me again. Safe to say my Spell Hunter deck I used to use with Rhok'delar would pair very well with Zul'jin? Didn't really look at him until this afternoon.

So far I have completed full rumble runs with 8 different shrines, and I have to say that I had a lot of fun with the rogue stealth shrine. I played a tempo deck with plenty of pirates and some deathrattle synergy (such as unearthed raptor and necrium blade). Essentially what i'd do is trigger my shrine's deathrattle (give all friendly minions +2 attack) to then attack with my shrine into an enemy minion and kill it off for an additional attack boost. Combine this with several other consecutive deathrattle triggers and some good team mate cards and you're all set. 
---
This tactic also has the additional benefit of triggering any deathrattle you gave your shrine from your chosen shrine upgrade card, such as lowering the cost of the cards in your hand by 2 or drawing a full hand. 
---
I’m so high i thought that was a sentence
---
Hunters strong but fine. Petition to get rid of OTK decks!
---
Incase you're not reading other comments some knowledge for you: cheat death returns it to your hand. When pros dies, he doesn't go to death an generates a token, but goes to your hand and transforms itself.
---
Hence it can't be returned again and does not get transformed into a 6/6/6.
---
Yeah he slots right in
---
Am I missing a joke? What is wrong with Tyrande?
---
Thank you for posting this because I thought I was the only once noticing that every single deck is the same and that the cards aren't random.
---
Start of turn triggers on minions always trigger first I believe.
---
Did you fucking found poem Hearthstone?
---
Yeah I agree with the infinite part, and totally get why people might be frustrated by elements of it that i don't mind personally. I just hope that other classes get hero cards so that they have the same quality tools as warrior, hunter and shaman
---
Fair enough, I guess people have different tastes!
---
I wouldn't call Tar Creeper unbalanced. It's a tool for slower decks to make aggressive deck play closer to their speed. Plus, aggro decks did play it since it is particularly versatile.
---

I enjoy this because to me its a mobile Magic + WoW game I can play on the go. I wish it wasnt RNG like you say though, it 100% is.
---
Absolutely.  But warrior only has two ways to consistently proc it:  boomship (assuming there is an opposing six attack minion) and saving a coin,  having a shield slam and ten armor.  So,  yeah,  saying consistent was generous.  
---
Man. My best was 6 boss. But that is something! Not to give up despite 200 times. I guess that's real practice. 
---
K
---
Cool. 
---
I’ve done 25 of them. The “spells cost health” warlock one and the Druid hero attack one are making me go gray. The changes definitely made rumble run easier but there are still some ridiculous unbeatable swings...
---
Murmuring Elemental has uses in Shudderwock, mostly because it lets you double up shudderwock’s battlecry if you reduce its cost with Fireplume Harbinger or another similar card.  Shudderwock will also copy the murmuring elemental battlecry if you can play a second shudderwock that turn.
---
But yes, when you play murmuring into lifedriker, wock sees one murmuring and one lifedrinker.
---
You forgot EA smh
---
And yea, I had a couple glasses of wine. I finally composed a deck that managed to rise above Shield Bearer, and I’m proud of it. But once again, resistance is futile. I should have spent all my dust on Mecha’lose so maybe I could make everyone else who takes this game seriously double think exactly how “strategic” this game really is. Like I have. This game has turned into little more than a flashy slot machine. And obviously, you can’t play the slots if you don’t pay the slots...
---
I saw that hadronox in video, I think
---
It is worth it as a challenge for yourself. Im on the opposite side lf the public opinion here. I totally liked the high difficulty that was wining with every shrine, but... the nerfs happened when I was mid completition and I totally felt it being much more easier, thus making it less self-rewarding the full 27 shrine wins
---
Troll him Ben shaperio style
---
yeah but you also might have a two drop and be making them think that on purpose, I think it's a bit of a stretch to view that as a 'tell'
---
You need to either buy a wild pack or on shop.blizzard.com or wait until April. But buy an Old Gods pack, you'll get a legendary for free.

I could try looking at the Hsreplay but at some point the tracker started bugging a lot so i dont know how acurrate it would be.
---
Anyway Id say the top 3 that took me the longest were the hunter overkill: cost (-1) for hand, warrior overkill: attack again and the priest deathrattle x3 (although this one was because i picked too many greedy buckets). The forth is likely the mage spell power. Lost until I realized the teammate that gives you arcane missiles was an instapick and 2 were instawin

The Majordomo/Ragnaros transition gives the most insight into how the Horsemen/destroy the opposing hero is checked because it does not include a board wipe.
---
After all four horsemen are on the board and Majordomo gets destroyed, the only effect is that the enemy hero is replaced. The horsemen remain just 2/2 tokens and not consumed like with V-07-TR-0N. Despite having the four horsemen with Uther of the Ebon Blade, Ragnaros just chilled out.
---
This requires further testing: what happens if all four horsemen remain until the next turn? Can I press the hero power button if the horsemen remain or does it behave like the Shaman hero power?
---
I did confirm that Ragnaros is vulnerable to a second collection of the four horsemen even if he faced them earlier. 
---
nah, it's cool. Wiktionary sez the word has 3 noun def.s, plus one as a verb, that have nothing to do with this kids' card game of ours O:-)

\#StopTheOppressionFromBarnes

My instinct is that at 10 required picks the control archetypes start to catch up a bit, especially if it's pros making them. Aggro is probably still very good, but maybe not completely oppressive though? But I have no evidence for that so no reason to disagree with you really.

I remember playing pirate warrior back in the day vs a freeze mage who roped me every turn and was pissing me off, I topdecked southsea deckhand for exact lethal, drop him on the board while BMing my opponent for being an asshole AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND attack with my weapon first destroying it, then he killed me

No. I had a online friend who was very into making clay dolls and would keep posting in progress photos on FB way back in the day. So I asked her what she used for tools and what she packed the sculptures with, and off I went on my own journey. I can get great ideas about techniques from Youtube though, but the clay community there is mostly about kawaii small things.
---
I made a deathrattle hunter deck, but i don't have Kathrena or KK so i used the mech package with the Whelp and Fireworks Tech. The first game I played i played Keleseth on turn 2. On turn three i drew the Egg and it was 0/3, and then i saw the Firework Tech in my hand. I conceded in shame. All this in legend of course.
---
i just emote randomly cause i like doing it and I've gotten friend requests just for people to brag about how they beat an emote spammer

It still pretty fun, hunter has like 3 different archetypes so the games play completely differently also odd paladin is weaker but still around to give them a hard time in general

Certainly the Overkills from warrior and hunter. Appart from those Id say Priest deathrattle x3 and Rogue spells x2 took me longer that it should have, but it was because I was drafting the wrong cards
---
Standard but you can always get wild games

Nexus Champion Saraad and enough patience, maybe.
---
No way that's real.
---
That's great! Now you can play him in all his glory!  I just jammed him into odd Hunter. Boy the opponent had to remove him asap.

Just to say i have an odd mage completed a dragon mech warrior completed and an odd quest warrior on thr other classes i have just commons and basic cards and i don t know what to do

he used to play alot of pirate warrior , its very real haha

It amazes me how many people in Rank 4-5 of Wild are dumb enough to play Dirty Rat on turn 2, or Deathlord on turn 3, against my Big Priest deck. Big Priest is literally one of the only Priest decks you ever see that high in ranked.

"My magic will tear you apart" takes on a whole new meaning now.

If Zul'jin was a Priest card then maybe they could finally nerf Big Priest in wild.

Of course not, this is completely wrong.

Lights Champion was a fine pick. It was a 3 mana 4/3 with upside at a time when a 3 mana 3/4 mech was considered one of the better arena picks. 
---
That said in the dozens (maybe hundreds, I’m over 3200 arena wins) of games I had him I think the silence was useful like 3 times.

Yes, it prevents targeting. It does not protect against untargeted destoy effects like [[twisting nether]]

Tried to combo without having discounted M’thun since Galvanizer was the last card.

Soularium when the deck had 1 card, took fatigur damage, and died.

Too strong. Now all minions are murlocs that are also demons for warlock. But also pirates for the weapon classes and dragons for priest who can steal your minions and already have duskbreaker as removal
---
Remember that Dog misplayed a turn earlier by not silencing Velen when he had Silence from Lyra.
---
Right. What's the point of asking the community?
---
I literally mentioned that in the title
---
I quit watching this thinking Dog was checkmated. Came back from getting some food and couldn't believe that Dog was winning. It was just such a textbook lethal setup for control priest.
---
That's not a misplay, don't be results oriented.  He JUST screamed it that's 2 draws for a 2/x (where x = number of cards left in the deck) odds were incredibly unlikely for him to have the cabal.  
---
10+10 🤔
---
He actually lost the game after that. I believe that Warrior 1h game TILTED him super hard
---
I was rooting for Dog, but I didn't want him to win like that.
---
Title.
---
Shaman is not so strong right now and if you want to climb the rank tier 1-2 deck will give you consistency gameplay just check meta in hsreplay or any site
---
Damn the cards these week are especially bad.
---
Mistakes were made.
---
Reno decks tend to be tons of fun, it's highlander after all and life truly becomes a resource.
---
Im new to reddit and don’t really care about upvotes 
---
It's in the title dude. And it wasn't really even a misplay because Dog doesn't know his opponent's hand.
---
When is it ever correct to take that risk in this matchup? Dog didn't have the burn in hand to make use of the Velen anyway so the 7/7 body does just as much.
---
I felt bad for Fib... but so happy for Dog rurururururu!
---
Where do I place my bet on priest going back to the dumpster? I'll spectate from my home in wild.
---
He won the warrior game
---
I think I got 7 or 8 from the bundle too, it was crazy. I feel like they would have advertised increased drop rates tho.
---
A much more subtle misplay, since it was him reacting quickly to a random silence off Lyra and accounting for a cabal shadowpriest + mind blasts in his opponent's hand. 
---
Also, the next turn, Fibonnaci played Twilight Acolyte (3 mana swap attack) without a dragon in hand and immediately NotLikeThis'd. 
---
Will Hunter, Shaman and Warrior be strictly better (without knowing what is coming next), because they will have hero cards still?
---
Misses lethal. Then misplay again the turn after. Loses the series. One for the eSports annals.
---
Next turn, Fibonnaci played Twilight Acolyte (3 mana swap attack) without a dragon in hand and immediately NotLikeThis'd. Chat exploded, Fib lost, feel bad for him but that was a hilarious match. 
---
I know but Dog getting 2x DMH's and prolonging the game for so long is what tilted him imo. Also the game was mentally draining for both players.
---
Dogs "misplay" was a judgement call. Finonaccis misplay was garbage gameplay
---
When you own the OP.
---
oki ty, then its me and ill have to improve myself
---
I'm very sure this worked because I managed to get the kill that way. 
---
Dog most of times did not know what was he doing with Priest.
---
Worst series ever in term of quality, funny though 
---
TFW you got 30k wins with a deck that never goes face.
---
Missed the game, did Dog end up winning?
---
Yup.
---
It is a misplay. You have to count for this possibility and furthermore he would have buffed his Velen by +6/+6 instead of +2/+1 for Ziliax.
---
I agree with you that it shoudn't be categorized as misplay. But he realises that fibonacci may have cabal in hand after silencing zilliax and thats why he becomes kinda nervous. Also you can see the relieve on his face after fibo plays primordial drake.
---
He could have topdecked burn or got it from the on board lyra. The cabal was such an unlikely threat. Its easy to pretend you would have made a better decision when you can see both hands.
---
Seem to be in good company, Fibonacci just made very similar mistake :P
---
Arguing on the internet is like playing chess with a pigeon. No matter how good you are, the pigeon will knock over the pieces, shit on the table and strut around like its victorious.
---
Not even yourself
---
Nothing against fibonacci but I find it ironic when HS just came up with a 'how pros fight tilt' video when a pro player just omega tilt, ragequit and gave up the chance to make world championship finals.

Maybe taking some time away from the game would be for the best because if you can't not be toxic when you're literally in the playoffs then you're playing the game for the wrong reasons and you need to do something else with your life or at least go and get your head straight.

1 oFf???
---
ITS OVER 9000!!
---
This inconsistency is how you know it's a real blizzard dev.
---
Omg I never knew! I've been browsing though to find my golden duplicates. This is great
---
Dont put janalai or jaina into a tempo mage deck. You will lose late game every time and will have a dead card at hand early turns.
---
Thanks for letting me know. I just tested it out for myself. Direct casting is once again caught by a hard code exception, it triggers the old dialog and consumes the sacrificial pact, as before. Grand archivist casting it still works though.
---
Inaccurate, it can also pull Tirion. Kind of OP for an odd deck if you ask me.
---
Not necessarily. You can still discover useful mechs before turn 10.
---
Jaraxxus + Amara
---
I always thought he was wearing a hat
---
Both are about 50% wr right now. I don't play OTK Priest, but oh boy is Holy Wrath Pally so much fun. You can also go for a double OTK Paladin list with Brewmasters, DK, Holy Wrath and Shirvallah so that you can use the combo that makes the most sense in the situation. Shirvallah is quicker, but DK isn't blocked by armour or healing.
---
They rotate next expansion so it will be over soon. However you are correct that the deathnights created a polarized meta with continuous value generation. That being said, they did allow a lot of cool decks to come into existence like rasa priest, big spell mage, cubelock, and the new aggro secret hunter.

ashy slashy
---
Holy frog that is better than a 3d printer
---
Damn
---
No worries man, there are 4 adventures for purchase. Karazstan and LOE were my favorites by far. You can also buy packs from the wild sets on their store as well but you must be on pc to do so.
---
U are crazy lol. How long did this take?
---
The best thing is, he didn't even recognize he misplayed.
---
Track your games, see against what you are losing to. Try to see how you can improve those match ups. Ask for match up advice here or in the daily question thread on /r/CompetitiveHS.  
---
The real issue with mage is how strong the basic cards are. Fireball/Frostbolt definitely make things problematic for the aggro side of things, but flamestrike/blizzard also set the standard for board wipes. It means they don't like to give mage very powerful cards since we always have access to those effects.
---
The only way they can give us powerful things is through effects like dragon's fury removing all of the cheaper spells. It just sucks because the reason I like playing mage is to cast lots of interactive spells xD I don't mind removing the braindead aggro decks, but I don't like control without spells.
---
Rotation will be interesting... I just want mage to have a t1 deck for once... I don't see that happening with baku effects in standard though... mage upgraded power just isn't very good. 
---
I really like vicious fledgling and raging worgen as 3 drops because they can win games singlehandedly, as for 2 drops, dire wolf alpha is a very good choice
---
Pretty sure home has nothing to do with Hearthstone at all.
---
It took a few tries to figure out a deck to achieve this goal, and then a few more tries to roll the correct treasure from Marin. The Golden Kobold ruins everything.
---
I'd say about 3-4 hours from concept to execution. 
---
11+4 🤔
---
Let me fix this title for you:
---
&gt;*I am at least 2 years late, and Blizzard has already done this before, but I digress. Crazy Idea: Blizzard should host a tournament on the day an expansion drops so everyone has to bring to the table only theorycrafted decks*
---
Dude are you serious those mods have been nazis for a long time now.  That's a normal occurrence in that channel.
---
I’ve lost in very similar fashion. You figure out the epic defile clear, it involves you dropping 1 or maybe even 2 minions. Then you do all the counting again to double check your math, maybe even a third time, and when you’re finally sure the rope is ticking so you drop that puppy anddddd it fizzles into nothing. 
---
God is it demoralizing, it’s not just the misplay, it’s the “what could have been” of the play you were going to make instead. 
---
I mean, the ban was also in effect during RR's reveal streams, and people were getting banned and whatnot and that was only a little more than a month ago. I don't think "it's been a long time" lol
---
dude, I just corrected your statement. you're gonna be wrong sometimes, it's okay, don't cry over fake internet points plz
---
I just had a vision of "dark Krag'wa" after your comment and I'm debating painting him in glow in the dark colours? Good green boi by day, dark and evil by night?
---
Nope, spam prevention 
---
Except not accurate at all because Stonehill Defender is run in a ton of classes.
---
Maybe Shirvallah will be next?
---
Yeah but why, literally all that can come from unbanning it is people spamming the same shit like "BEN BRODE WAS BETTER" 
---
Neat! Your username being Praxis is rather fitting :)
---
It was a joke. Its accurate that tarim shows up very frequently. Dont be a buzzkill. Move along.
---
10 mana deal 7 to all owo
---
What a stupid hill to die on. 
---
I believe you are wrong. Molten giant (in that case) is 0 mana. There is no lower cost minion. 
---
Dude censor the primalfin totem as well, it clearly has a face carved into it, think about this little guy. 
---
Love the announcers here
---
I think its a bigger problem in arena
---
My favourite was when they spoke German.
---
A few months ago I was watching a game and I said "wow this match is so boring" and I was perma banned.
---
I'm not touching the 666
---
Thanks! Good to know. These are awesome resources. Just what I was looking for. Wish I had some reddit gold for ya.
---
Oh! Okay... see I thought I was playing a video game. I didn't realize this is a clubhouse for insecure assholes. My mistake.
---
Yeah, because priest loses all their bullshit AoE next rotation. Wait, no they don't. And they still can play cloning, just not 2-3 turns early. But w/ seance and pw replicate and vivid nightmare, Priest can still pull off ridic burst combo's especially if Velen lives for a turn. And Inner fire and divine spirit plus topsy aren't going anywhere for minion based burst. Plus divine hymn still makes pyromancer another source of AoE. So Priest will still be around, just far less broken than the Raza or Drak OP days. But if no ones plays Priest in standard, big rez Priest will still ruin wild.
---
Seems a bit unlikely, considering the upgraded hero power isn't worth the deckbuilding cost for non-control warrior decks that need to curve out minions.
---
are you saying ice block was a bad card?
---
dxw100#1827 NA quest trade
---
10/10, would play two in my Baku deck.
---
It'd honestly be hard to see tempo stay around, it actually relies a lot on Keleseth i'd say.
---
Is this an Eva reference?
---
Binding heal was playing in machine gun / razakus priest. 
---
Have some ideas since we’re talking about them.
---
Card idea: Red Whelp
---
Class: Druid/Paladin (usable by BOTH classes, like the well received Hybrid mechanic from MtG)
---
Stats: 2 mana, 2/1 Dragon.
---
Effect: Choose One. If you’re holding a dragon, deal 3 damage to an enemy character, or If you’re holding a dragon, heal 6 health to a damaged friendly character.
---
Card Idea: Green Whelp
---
Class: Druid/Rogue
---
Stats: 2/1 Dragon
---
Effect: Combo gain an empty mana crystal (if you have 10 max mana, get an excess mana card instead).
---
I'll still never understood why class cards have an appearance boost for Discover effects.
---
Discover on its own is already a strong effect.
---
I meant a Control deck that isn't odd, not an odd deck that isn't Control.
---
