Siphon soul sees a fair bit of play and it costs 6, Rogue just doesn't have a use for assassinate. Hex and Polymorph should cost 5

A controversial opinion. A brave one at that. But we reached a game state where the game relies on drawing the right cards again. In Kobolds, I didn't mind because any class could use Keleseth effectively. Now, every hunter deck can draw an oppressive string of cards only beaten if you run odd pali or something to that nature of aggro.  
---

---
Side not is that DK Rexxar just isn't a cool card to play against. It turns a 180 reversal on the class identity and is run in any kind of hunter deck (even midrange) just so it can make up for the class's iconic weaknesses. A good balance design is to buff the strong parts of something, maybe give it more options, but not to remove any weaknesses. Giving them a garunteed good minion every turn (card draw) and giving a reasonable board clear+5 armor (stabilizing) should never be a part of the kit. If people don't think it's broken, they wouldn't go out of their way to craft and play it.
---
where did you find this?
---
The only one i ever got was flame leviathan worst legend ever
---
omg!!1!11! that’s insane bro 🔥💯😂👌
---
If you have whizzbang, you can roll for the awesome augmentation deck, worked for me.
---
I hope the hunter hype train loses steam soon. It’s popularity stems from many reasons, including being untouched and being good against pretty much all decks below tier 2, much like KFT jade druid. Jade druid’s popularity rose drastically because people thought it was unstoppable and the only way to beat it was by playing jade druid, but in reality, there were decks like Pirate Warrior, Murloc Paladin and Aggro Druid that were favored against it. Same thing is happening with hunter where people think only hunter can beat hunter, but most of the tier 1/2 decks have good matchups against it. 
---
I think the solution would be to nerf the deck similar to how they nerfed jade druid, not to make hunter a lot worse, but so people will jump off the hype train. Sometimes you gotta nerf cards not because of actual power level, but because people are misinterpreting what’s good and making a worse meta because of it.
---
I'm surprised people think armor hate is unbalanceable.  That is laughably defeatist, but also it doesn't have to be balanced to be printed.
---
A neutral epic, call it Rust Technician, 7 mana 7/4 deals double damage to armor. It doesn't have charge, and can't get charge, and with 4 health late game it is easily removed.
---
It wouldn't see play, but that makes it a perfect epic.
---
V A L U E
---
Christ. I mean I sit here and say. Obviously no. But the reality is. Heck yeah. What a day it would be. I've bought.... Many packs...
---
It's a thousand times better than druid. OP Combo decks like that are not fun to play against 
---
Speaking of which does anyone legitimately know how to beat Wild Res Priest?
---
Turn 3/4 Barnes into bullshit like that 10/10 that summons more bullshit happens every game and there's just nothing i can do. I play even shaman, odd mage, tempo mage, odd paladin, zoolock, shudderwock, some others. All same outcome, can't win
---
Not really dealbreakers by a long shot.
---
If they wanted to (they don't) they could only give individual classes anti armor cards (like a piercing dagger for rogue) to limit the scope.
---
I'm actually playing Even Warlock, the only major deck besides APM Priest with a negative winrate against *every* Hunter archetype. My winrate looks like that because I'm a returning player climbing from rank 20 back to my normal spot in the 10-5 range; my vs Hunter rate is 60%, and it's still among my worst.  
---
But more importantly, I don't recall complaining that it's overpowered. I'm complaining that it's *overrepresented*. I admittedly have a particular beef with Hunter because I don't like secrets and I don't like long, grindy matches vs. Rexxar, but I'd be pretty sick of any class if it was in half my games.
---
You are playing warlock so yeah...
---
Nobody gives sympathy to priest players for when they were all highlanders for an expansion and a half. Back to the shaft they go. Here we have a class that was hated for a year and a half, then became partly bad except for when midrange was viable, then Blizzard gave them good cards for a year. Now we have to wait it out for them to leave.
---
DK is run in Beast Hunter though, at least in my experience.
---
best 8 or 9 mana tempo play ever, that also has a sick deathrattle
---
Even in its worst classes (mage and rogue who have no class taunts) its not a bad card, because there are very few bad taunts, just because the taunts aren't good enough to put in a deck, doesn't mean they're too bad to play if you generate them 
---
It would probably be something like "1 mana: draw a card and deal 5 damage to enemy armor". But even that is very iffy.
---
It depends on the amount of threats and the quality of the minion you kill. If a deck runs a few big minions and you spend 2 cards to kill some of them, it's great.
---
For what it’s worth, they said to hall of fame them. And I could see Blizzard doing it if they want to print a card that functions similarly with a different twist.
---
Leroy I’m amazed they haven’t HoF’d yet. Blizzard had a hard turn on charge and he’s the epitome of that style.
---
Control decks are expensive because they require unique abilities from high rarity cards, this is the way it is in almost every card game. 
---
much more guaranteed than lich king giving you 15 to face
---
you could definitely tweak it a little bit if you get strong healing synergy often in the early game, taskmaster is one of the better 1 drops and the card is great in aggro matchups though the deathrattle is a downside of course
---
If you want to ladder up: spell hunter or control priest. If you want to have fun: Tess espionage rogue :)
---
It’s all over this sub dude 
---
Happy new year i guess
---
You can draft broken cards too. Sometimes you get screwed with bad options, but that isn't the norm.
---
&gt; its evening out the cost of different archetypes im talking about.
---
What do you mean by "cost"? If you're referring to the dust cost, that ties back to what I said: Team 5 has no reason to do it if people are satisfied with prices as is.
---
If you mean what cards are Epic, Rare, Common, etc., that's done intentionally and I think it should stay the way it is so long as you only get 5 cards in a pack.
---
Yep. It’ll be posted a handful of times per day. Brace yourself.

&gt; The card covers what would otherwise be bad matchups for hunter.
---
What? You mean an aggro deck outvaluging a ultra greedy purely value oriented control deck isn't good for the game?
---
How does the first part of the sentence relate to the second? Getting your bladed gauntlet oozed doesn't remove your armor.
---
Not really. It's not like there's a one to one ratio of balance centered entirely around hero cards.
---
I wish i had a friend ._.
---
Personally I think hunter is fine. any time it gets a SLIGHTLY set of decks or cards, people wince and complain.  your all remembering undertaker too much. 
---
The holiday bundle if it’s still there.  If it’s not:
---
You’re guaranteed a legendary in the first 10 packs of each set.  So I’d start working towards opening packs until you get a legendary from each set.
---
Even when I have what seems to be a pretty solid deck, I still get wrecked in the third match. They seem to get the most powerful cards and the luckiest draws. Maybe I’m inept, but like wow. I can’t see myself ever beating that adventure.
---
Ah, the og shudderwock counter, not that we need him now tho
---
I understand that there are, but teching against control strategies are better done through attacking their card advantage instead of their life totals. Skulking Giest will usually do more against Odd Warriors and Druids than most potential anti-armor tech could.
---
I don't mean to come up as either harsh or dismissive in my following criticism of your suggestions, but here they are:
---
* Big minions won't really matter against the typical deck that gains a lot of armor. They tend to play a lot of single target removal like Shield Slam.
---
* See above. Also too circumstantial to really consider printing as too often, the card would do nothing.
---
* Could actually be something Team 5 produces, but the words "neither player" will only every functional be "Your opponent" in decks that play such effects if it were made neutral. Maybe as a Warrior or Druid minion.
---
* Big minions won't really matter against the typical deck that gains a lot of armor
---
* Far too circumstantial and niche to really consider printing. It's also a weird idea to want your opponent to gain armor in order to get your cards to do something.
---
* That sort of effect would be far more applicable in controlling decks, especially other warriors, over decks that actually want anti-armor tech.
---
* The extra damage that design could do against armor would not justify how linear, limited, and expensive the card is in its default state.
---
* While it could be seen as a useful way to draw out an removal source against a Druid or Warrior, most four drops would also fulfill a similar purpose.
---
* That statline is probably not high enough to really make an impact. A similar design (When you're opponent has more than X life, \[Creature\] gains Hexproof) could see play in Magic the Gathering, but that game isn't as liberal with creating board sweeper effects as Hearthstone is.
---
Top 3 tiers are 17 consecutive decks of either control or aggro. Tier 4 first combo deck.
---
We all need to remember just how much fun it is to lose to control and aggro to remind ourselves why it is combo had to be nerfed unto the fucking ground.
---
I mean there literally isn't a single druid deck in 4 tiers but we need 2 classes in tier 1 and an additional 3 by tier 2 to all have 2 decks.
---
I'd say something snarky like "I hope you're all happy" but the sad thing is you all probably are.
---
gmac921#1889 trading 80g quest on NA
---
Sounds like another class that used to get played a lot.. hmm
---
A fun card can become anti-fun if it becomes broken. I loved playing DK Rexxar back when it released, but now with all the other broken shit, it's a I win card against control and quite often enough of a swing turn against aggro.
---
In general, I try to take out the enemy shrine as much as possible while taking advantage of my own as much as possible. From there, it's just basic fundamentals for the most part. Yeah, the drafts can get crazy and the unique cards can be game changing, but you have access to them as well. It's challenging, but far from impossible.
---
I didn't think of that interaction, that would make sense.
---
Man, tempostorm cranking out the wild snapshots. I could get used to this.
---
I think it's better to indicate punish your opponent for their armor:
---
Battlecries: gain armor equal to your opponent's.
---
The armor amounts in Odd Warrior and Druid is nothing compared to the measly five given by Hero cards. The armor gain also tends to be the least important aspect of the Hero cards as well.
---
I dunno combo priest sure seems to be a good counter to it. Although maybe the cost of that deck is much higher. 
---
I personally made Zul'jin recently. Filling the board again after the enemy used his clears is way better than crafting a singular zombeast. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But it's your dust,your choice.  Oh and maybe dust some useless cards to craft at least one To My Side!

Meny92#1622 Quest trade on NA

When do the old packs rotate out of standard and do they all rotate out at once?
---
All I play against is hunter now it’s annoying
---
No that’s dumb.  That isn’t how balance works.  Imagine they printed 500 different hero cards of the power level of Dk Thrall for shaman, and just frost lich jaina for mage.
---
Who has the more balanced hero class?
---
Yeah
---
Oh my.  Oops. 
---
It wouldn’t be as upsetting if you didn’t have to restart the entire adventure for losing once. And then the shrines and cards are all different again, making it hard to build a strategy after each defeat.
---
I take my time and carefully pick my cards and shrine, and just can’t do it. But I could just suck.
---
To be fair he reviewed it before Lich and “Precision” were printed. Still 1 star is a clear miss
---
Seems like they intend to just keep it as cash cow now as it's past maturity, arguably on the decline.
---
There's a strong argument that long term players will keep playing regardless, and a few new modes won't really attract more players. So spending presumably a few million on new game modes has no positive return for them financially.
---
Wut? He added me and just said “trash” and then “lucky”
---
Its worse when you reach the final opponent, they  start 2 mana crystals up and maybe im crazy but i swear they draw extra cards and get the EXACT perfect card everytime they need it.
---
If you look at the odd rogue lists on https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/219/odd-rogue#tab=similar
---
you'll see that only few builds run crystalizer and those who do also run dire mole as well, so really in that case it's just to add another 1/3 one drop
---
Thank you for taking the time. I’ll have a look :)
---
And you responded with petty sarcasm designed to rile him up even more. You're no better than he is.
---
Technically you dont lose life since the life gets comverted to armor.
---
Odd rogue is all about early board presence supported by amazing hero power. 3 health is not easy to remove in the first 2 or 3 turns of the game.
---
You can think of crystalizer as dire mole number 3 and 4.
---
Lol I’m not adding people to call them trash and then saying I’m gonna kill people. You sound upset tho 
---
I would rage so hard if I made it to the last guy and they pulled that bullshit. I don’t mind a challenge, so long as it’s fair. But these seem almost purposely unfair 
---
Username checks out. To My Side is kinda insane, though it's one of the only reasons to have no minions in the deck.
---
That's because these numbers are made up.
---
Thank you for understanding lol
---
Funny thing, if you go to open a pack it fixes itself.
---
It’s my anti lich king deck
---
Thx
---
You're doing it again! Using low-key insults to rile me up while again trying to take the moral high ground. It makes you look more like a shitty human being than the opponent who added you. 
---
My first opponent when i hit the end had the druid shrine that refreshes his mana when he gains armour, i dont remember his deck exactly.but he mostly had 1 and 2 mana armour gain cards and on turn 1 coined out the minion that draws him a card and reduces its cost when he gains armour... By turn 4 the game was over, i wasnt dead but it was impossible to win with how many huge ass minions he had, most with overkill and rush, making it impossible to have a board.
---
1. Why would that matter?
---
* You will go into combo turn with 10 mana anyway.
---
* Ice Block didn't work versus Time Warp - while "Time Out" specifically says "become immune until your next turn".
---
* Ice Block is easily removed by Eater of Secrets. Time Out is not possible to remove.
---
* Ice Block effect is triggered by opponent, so you can AT LEAST bring your opponent to 1 hp before triggering ice block. In some cases, this wins game if you play "Eye for an Eye". Time Out makes you immune at your current health total.
---
2. What skill exactly? It's not rocket science to estimate what the opposing deck can and cannot do. Especially if they have 40 power board while you're trying to roll that horseman.
---
3. wut? So how does Time Out lose in situations where Ice Block stands? Considering Time out cannot be interacted with.
---
4. I fully agree on generation of ice block. Many games I had 4-5 ice blocks and that is nonsence, bs, op, non-interactive and blabla. That is true. But one way or another, Ice Block **can be interacted with** by Eater of Secrets. But Time Out ? How can a card that has no way to be interacted with be "more interactive" than Ice Block? :D
---
See... that’s the stuff that would make me never try again. I’m so sorry you had to endure that bullshit.
---
Found the hunter main /s
---
What an odd knack to side with the guy starting the fight you have 
---
You have to get to Rank 25 first.
---
This would only work once, if at all. If he's recruited by his own deathrattle trigger, it won't activate his battlecry a second time. 
---
How is that xenophobic?  Maybe look up the definition.
---
And you've done it again. https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/moral-superiority-psychology_us_5892110fe4b0522c7d3e6a32
---
Geist is still pretty good against Hunter and decent against Priest and Warrior. 
---
However, I've been trying out Mindbreaker in Big Spell Mage and it's had above average results. A 2/5 stat line is actually pretty solid for a 3 drop and can be a decent turn 3 against more tempo decks. It can also give you a fighting chance against OTK Paladin and Quest Warrior. Haven't played enough games with it yet to know how well it will truly do, but early results have been promising.
---
I'm guessing he was salty over two greater warlock spellstones lol. I annihilated two of his large minions whilst restoring most of my hit points.
---
You’re sitting on the internet looking for a reason to get upset
---
Oh ok, that makes sense now.
---
And again. https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/moral-superiority-psychology_us_5892110fe4b0522c7d3e6a32
---
I guess different things are annoying to different people. For me going through million deathrattle little dudes and 3 Amaras in a priest deck, combined with 4-6 full board clears feels more annoying. Secrets I have learned how to play around and usually can beat secret hunter (very good win rate against them). Or odd warrior and their 25+ armour by turn 5. I find that more annoying.
---
I dusted him early in the expansion release and I regret it now. Standard has gotten stale for me so I’m mostly focused on RNG/meme decks like Tesspionage and Thief Priest. Think Griftah would be perfect for those types of games.
---
Here is the deck code for those who are interested:

I don't think something that bypasses armor, but perhaps a minion that deals double damage to armor but not health. Could be a bitch to code, but if it works then at least there is a tech that would be overcosted if they are aren't heavy on the armor.

Well yes, it's a card game. Luck is a big part of the equation as it depends on what cards you draw!
---
Just as a priest you might not draw dusk breakers or mass hysterias, hunter has the same problem with spell stone, actually you're less likely to find spell stone early plus buff it with secrets and play it on turn 5. That is statistically much less likely as it's just 2 cards plus you also need secrets. Priest has at least 4 answers to spellstone so much more likely to draw them. Priest in this case requires less luck and it's easier to play.
---
I'm so lost, have you never played these decks before? I don't understand why running Reno disqualifies you from being a combo deck. I run Reno in Wild Exodia Mage (The Thaurissan/Antonidas version that is an OTK). You draw through so much of your deck that it usually activates and the heal can provide a couple extra turns to pull the OTK off. Only reason Reno is run in Reno Priest is because it's a free heal with a conditional you are fulfilling anyway for your combo. "Oh look I've assembled the combo, you lose the game" is an OTK deck which is a type of combo deck but not the only type of combo deck. 
---
As for Anyfin, every single deck in the game would prefer to have their opponent dead by turn 5, but the current Anyfin list is very unlikely to do so. Have you even looked at the deck list? What Aggro Paladin would run Flash of Light and Uther of the Ebon Blade?

MU Tips: Tech a benedictus and a geist you get that win for free(hard techs). Or 2x holy fire(soft techs) to increase the burn will also get through that match up. The key is don’t over extend and play 1 minion at a time and maximize your anduin pings(like in late game shadow vision for another visions over picking the mindblast straight away to get more pings). Save Kabal combo for direhorns. Avoid drawing cards because you need the time to fit in every anduin ping. Try to deal more than 4 damage with 1 minion(never play a second midsized minion when the warrior passes or super collider equipped) and anduin every turn and the warrior will have trouble dodging the multiple mindblast burst. Remember outside of hero power warrior only has 2x shield block for armor and they don’t want to play boom to lose the reliable armor gain. Late game when close to kill you can play around zillax by not playing minions. Also don’t need to hold all the mindblasts late game, play 1 or 2 to squeeze out that extra anduin ping is key. Super hard matchup but doable if played right with a few soft techs. If the odd warrior plays quest, then you are basically screwed unless you perfect curve anduin -&gt; alex -&gt; mindblasts
---
Just curious, would you consider Toggwaggle druid a combo deck? (As far as I know, most people did, and I'd like your opinion)
---
I personally thought it was the easiest solo adventure yet, some shrines are just really broken and easy to exploit.
---
First ever run got to the last boss with the mage 0 power shrine, but RNG was not my friend. Second try was the warrior shrine that has attack equal to armor. Loti was the last boss, which can snowball pretty quickly, but if you force her to play most cards so she’s always top decking -the AI is really dumb with trades and whatnot- it’s an easy win.
---
Monster Hunt on the other hand, still can’t beat it with Toki. I’ve tried every possible combo I could think of and nada, it’s such a pain in the ass.
---
This one is only more annoying when it comes to the RNG of the initial shrines. But conceding until you get a decent one is not terribly long. 
---
Yeah that's my assumption too, but the face collector has some potential value based on the deck. Wanted to verify before jumping the gun because what you have does matter quite a bit, however unlikely.
---
Blizzard is very bad at implementing things during their heights and pretty much waiting till something is dead before they realise that hey, maybe we should have done something. (See SC2)
---
Hearthstone is pay to have more options, your deck options are limited by card availability.
---
[The deck in this video is pretty cheap and straightforward to play.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTYYABiDtHE) Hunter is generally a good class to start out with and has receivced some good cards in the last few sets, so in my opinion the best class to start out with.
---
Net decking at high ranks is expected.  Rank 18 though?  Yes, I don't like only playing against the same net-decks over and over again, and especially not when they generate infinite value.  Makes the game stale.  
---
Ok
---
Yeah Cairne is likely the best option across the board. Gral has very little value and the only potential other option would've been Collector, but 9.5/10 times Cairne is the pick my dude.
---
New cool mechanic would be to allow in any way to include cards of other classes in your deck, but only being able to play them if you satisfy certain condition
---
This is accurate. 
---
Hearthstone by definition is **not** a pay-to-win game. There is nothing in the game you can buy that will give you an advantage you otherwise could not obtain for free via grinding. When you buy packs, you are paying to fast forward through the grind. That's it. 
---
A quick example of what true pay-to-win looks like: 
---
*"For $2.99, add Captured Flag (the +1/+1 buff from the K&amp;C Dungeon Run) to your decks for the next 10 matches."* 
---
Is it more fun to have a big collection of cards to play with? Of course. Will you win more matches by buying tons of packs? Not necessarily, depending on the meta. As proven, you can climb to legend with a number of budget decks (primarily mindless aggro decks), as long as you have the time to play, you're not a complete idiot, and have a bit of luck. 
---
Bloody hellfire! 
---
The problem with face collector in arena is his lack of consistant value. On top of his slow value, the randomness factor doesnt help. 
---
It still worked pretty damn well with the good discard cards you were playing anyway and very little downside compared to voidwalker 
---
I have never made a comment like that. 
---
Should have played around it
---
&gt; However, in what world is Reno Priest not a combo/OTK deck? In the featured list, you literally have 2 ways to kill from 30, using Velen and healing cards or Spawn of Shadows and inspire heropowers.
---
Make the deck and give it a run for let's say 500 games. How many did you otk? 4? Maybe 7? A combo deck otk's for its actual win condition. Reno priest is a control deck with a combo backup. Does it otk against aggro? No.
---
&gt; Combo decks are in a pretty difficult position because aggro is so strong
---
Then why argue the point? Combo is utterly fucking pointless if it doesn't OTK and OTK reliably so random turn 37 horseshit like reno priest or anyfin don't count. I want to gain my 10th mana crystal and win. The game is in an utter cesspool pit at the moment for how much blind stupid aggro and absurd late game control is rewarded, yet for some reason Wild Growth and Nourish are ruining the game something fierce.
---
You're definitely not wrong. I guess I sometimes go for more fun stuff like a hail mary or something in the situation my deck is solid on its own, but Cairne is just so much value it's likely to be rare regardless haha. I would almost never take either of the others, it's just good to see decks when making decisions in general.
---
What overlay/dash does TrashcanTV use? As seen [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/abldv9/trashcantvs_budget_legend_zoo_warlock_for_1500/)
---
Can ya blame him?
---
Nice. 
---
But you can't play Time Out on turn 3 and just wait for it to save you, it has to be played  at the perfect time to make full use of. Not to mention Ice Block just straight up beat any sort of combo/OTK decks without any counter play whatsoever. 
---
I always expected raids to be something that woukd be a main stay of the game since it was a bug part if the physical card game this was based on.

Exodia paladin is on the verge of enjoyable but it plays as a shitty control deck until you draw 2 brewmaster/zola, get the right summons, and win. There is precisely 0 satisfaction in rolling a 1/2 for your 3rd horseman. There's nothing I did I can look back and pat myself on the back for well played; I just got the right horseman. Zero enjoyment. At least with AK47 I knew that from the mulligan I was on a clock counting down to 0 with limited turns and mana to assemble the pieces necessary to win and 9 wins out of 10 it was the turn before I could lose so I knew that my decision making accounted for that extra turn and thus win.
---
Exodia paladin gives absolutely zero enjoyment for wins. You just fall into the otk without any actual effort or feeling that you could actually possibly lose.
---
Oh and there's no mecha'thun deck that's even t4 so .. uh .. no.
---
Beast as in midrange beast hunter.  Kripp may have made a budget version or something of it, I don't really know, but there've been dozens of people messing around to try and figure out the best cards for the deck, and a lot of pro players coming up with different variatns which focus on heavier midrange, token style game play, more aggro versions and so on.
---
But all of them run dire mole, razormaw, and flanking strike, and most run rexxar and candleshot
---
Best counter to armor is damage. Also good time to complain about druid
---
Dat perfect flavor text too!
---
Grats.
---
Mhm.  While you do need to be prepared for it, most of the time they aren't building a board beforehand (assuming secret hunter) so ensuring you can clear the board works out pretty well if your deck can do so.
---
Similar to turn 10 zuljin, it's often a BIG board, but at the same time you can know "Okay, need to save a 3 damage AoE for this."

if you're using hearthstone deck tracker, it have a pity timer function to help you keep track of the pack you open. in order to you use it you have to install additional plugin. Pity timer is useful to track down epic/legendaries and are calculated separately for each expansion, no sharing together.
---
explanation on pity timer https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics#Pity_Timer
---
http://standardhearth.com/  , for cards from expansion, they will rotate to wild mode. so be careful when crafting cards for deck, they might be useful in standard mode but in wild , it could be a different story. the next rotation is the next expansion.

The problem there is any Hunter dominant meta comes with an influx of control Priest to counter, so you aren't gaining much ground with that trade.
---
I don't get the hate against Hunter, mainly due to the fact that there are some clear counters against the class. Both even and odd Paladin have positive win rates against all Hunters. If you don't like Hunters, start farming them!
---
Source: https://i.imgur.com/WQMRTJP.png
---
where they all minions?
---
Sigh.
---
What’s funny is that it deals damage to your own minions, and then lists execute as synergy, implying that you should execute your own minions. I don’t think OP considered attacking with the weapon for the synergy.
---
Holy nova and seanace are 2 bad cards in the deck, maybe focus more on heal synergies and add in some heal spells? Also frostwolf warlord seems to be a poor pay off to a board of minions. Sea giants seem to be better. If you don't have sea giants tho I don't think it is worth it to craft those. It is quite hard to build a good budget fun deck. Hope you can have fun with this deck!
---
I'm glad they finally nerfed rain of toads
---
Wow this is a blast from the past
---
Midrange? Sure. Fuck the res, esp the 9000+ dust Spell Hunter.
---
Another issue I think is that it's very hard for a hunter to completely whiff. Sure Druid could high roll, but Druid whiffed a lot and just sat there twiddling their thumbs hoping to hit ramp or an answer. Hunter doesnt have that aspect, because if they dont hit spellstone then they have Rexxar, Animal Companions, Candleshots and Hunters Mark's, secrets, Zuljin, Deadly Shots, Flanking Strikes, etc etc. Hunters very rarely whiff outright and are left dead in the water, and that's a huge aspect I havent seen anybody bring up yet. 
---
Left side shows the past actions, so not sure if he got it from there.
---
Cant believe there are still people who haven't 
---
See both Odd and Even Paladin win rates vs all Hunter: https://i.imgur.com/WQMRTJP.png
---
You can execute your minions that has been mind  controlled.
---
A 10 cost minion can evolve into the overload giant, and that can evolve into mountain or clockwork giant. 
---
A 12 mana minion cannot be evolved just as a 0 mana minion (tinyfin, wisp, target dummy, penguin) cannot be devolved 
---
Sigh
---
1. If you don’t like what’s meta, don’t play it, stick to decks you enjoy
---
2. Always find at least 2-3 classes you like, using the same deck and same cards over and over can sometimes get stale
---
3. If a friend didn’t get you in the game, get a friend in the game (it helps with certain quests)
---
You don't have to restart, if you press the play button the blur goes away. Still a little annoying though.
---
My problem with it is that Zul'jin is one of my favorite cards because Zul'jin is one of my favorite Warcraft characters. but now I can't really play hunter to play Zul'jin, because the popularity of the class means I either face just boring mirror matches or I face people most likely teched to murder me.

looks like you're just making excuses and just want to play druid ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

try the shirvallah then where like druid , you aim to stall too until you can assemble your combo.
---
there is also malygos rouge.
---
Exactly 
---
Yeah its good cause its easy to beat you just need class with 3 boardclears and you are fine.
---
Yeah, this is exactly why it's so annoying to play against secret/spell hunter. You just typed two paragraphs about how to deal with hunter secrets. 
---
It takes a lot of resources to deal with, and then when they play Zuljin you have to do it all again. The secrets are annoying, but Zul jin is just straight up pre-nerf Yogg.

I think the meta is pretty healthy rn, much better than it was before the nerfs. I'm seeing a wider variety of decks being played and the frequency of hunters in legend isn't as high as 1-5. I'm sick of playing against DK but for the most part hunter isn't too oppressive and there as very good counters to it rn i.e. priest, even shaman (my current deck)

Griftah sells useless junk in WoW and his wares are either completely useless or "help" you do things you already can do.

People underestimate Gral. If it pulls a 3/3 on average, you're getting a 5 cost 5/5 that draws a card. If you high-roll a 5+ drop you'll be looking at a 5 cost 7/7 draw a card.

3/1/3 | Whenever you target a minion with a spell, cast it again on its neighbors.

I thought of something like Zilliax but instead of lifesteal it would do double damage to armor and you could attach it to bigger minions via magnetic.

The only card you need to craft is your credit card.
---
are you complaining that hunter is actually beatable and this shit ass community just echo chambers good decks until people find out the obvious weaknesses? lul ur prolly rite
---
You lost and you still lost? Hate when that happens.
---
On hindsight you're right, it had the marks of a good joke which some of us probably could have seen coming, but it was just not the kind of thing people think too much about. The audience would have also have to be very familiar with the Griftah character in the first place, and most people who play Hearthstone now are probably not.
---
The flavour text line was also edited in later.
---
I was expecting something relating to anti-armor in the Grand Tournament set, seeing as the jousting mechanics from WoW centered around building/breaking armor. It would have been the best set for it flavor-wise *and* considering that's where Tank Up came from.
---
I doubt we'll see it now, even though I'd love to see them try something. A complete armor removal could potentially dwarf [[Alexstrasza]]'s effect, so having something that set armor to a value of 10-15 instead (like Alex) might make more sense and gives it some versatility.

I play since beta, never spend money, never grinded and I have a pretty good collection. You simply compensate for the lack of time playing the game with spending money on packs. Allows people with time to play for free and those without time to spend money instead.

If you think other card games ar better, whya re you still here complaining about Hearthstone, play those "better" ones instead. I played MTG:A, Shadowverse and Artifact and I rather stick to Hearthstone.

Ahh temporus the accident
---
&gt;Its just more obvious and luck based losing to a hunter.  
---
You just summarized hearthstone.  
---
&gt;While a combo deck i know if i didnt kill them before turn 9 theres something i probably did wrong and can modify my play.  
---
Or you had poor rng or it was a rather polarized matchup.  
---
&gt;So its not really out playing them, its out drawing them or building pure hunter counter  
---
Again ... hearthstone summarized.
---
The problem with these statements is that all cards after the introduction of the DK are balanced around them so they’re likely to be intended to be this dominant. 
---
The decks been nerfed bucko. The circle jerk is over on r/fuckdruid
---
Freezing Trap is disgustingly OP. Should only make it cost 1 more
---
I guess Wow wiki or if you really want to get in to it I suggest you start reading the wow books, they're amazing! 
---
If cube was the problem we'd see it in more classes, play dead and terror scale are the culprits. 
---
fake, don't respond to op if he replies or pm  you privately, see my edited comment later for proof, this is a scam and alt account of op that have scammed previously in this sub.
---
I love the facepalm
---
Ya I remember when Hunter was at the absolute bottom for a few expansions. 
---
It’s alright that it’s finally his time in the sun. 
---
I completely agree, 
---
And i am really happy that no realy early aggro legendarys exist. Mukkla and leeroy are crucial enough. But aggro legendarys would be like keleseth. A huge snowballing swing, like old manawyrm or those lovely aggro shaman cards before ungoro. 
---
Furthermore aggro decks play mostly cheap tempo minions and like to put duplicates of those into the deck. Mukkla and leeroy are typical exceptions. And its nice to have mukkla only on turn 3 with a downside which can lead to interesting decisions. 
---
Interestingly the only 3 early game aggro legendarys are neutral, which makes a huge load of sense because in that aspect "all aggro decks are the same" so no reason to print them class specific.  
---
Also regarding the Skill: if you use "decisions per minute" as a measurement aggro decks and controll decks have the same value but the aggro deck just played 2 or 3 games in the time the control deck played 1. So yes over 1 game it has fewer decisions but that doesn't make it any easier just less representative of your skilllevel.
---
In a control matchup you get more chances to make a mistake. But in aggro matchups every decision is more significant. 
---
Secondly: in control matchups there are generally more cards in hand and often more minions on board and you have to make long term plans with your plays. Which makes them more complex, but they still have the same depth.
---
(Complexity is a puzzle with many pieces, depth is  "the interesting decision making process." https://youtu.be/jVL4st0blGU (And yes they can amplify eachother sometimes))
---
And as  hearthstone has a lot of depth to it, aggro decks are deceptively simple, but still insanely hard to master. 
---
(Even though the difference between the worst and the best aggro player is likely smaller than the worst and the best control player. (Aggro has a higher skill floor) Both can be Very skilltesting even if aggro skill rewards you with fewer % points and lowskill aggro can reward medium skilled people with easier climbs. (Not lastly because of winning streaks and shorter matchups.) 
---
One last aspect i would like to mention: as the league  system for 2019 has changed, aggro decks will lose in high legend significance. As in the past it was useful to get a lot of wins in order to get those many wins you need to be at the top. 
---
In a tournament setting and high legend aggro decks are traditionally weaker as on ladder. (No need to explain why)
---
So from a theoretical perspective it makes more sense to play aggro (especially up to rank 5) so in theory aggro should be balanced to be weaker as there is an extrinsic motivation/bonus to play it. But on the other hand, people with slower decks on ladder would create way slower games for everyone hurting the playerbase overall. 
---
Which creates an extrinsic motivation for blizzard to keep good aggro decks around. 
---
I am sure you are aware of all of this, i just put it out there. 
---
(It was rambly in the end, but i typed this on the phone and got to go.)
---
Anyways, have a good day. 
---
We swapped our decks several times with the Archbishop. So my opponent could play Marin the Fox three times. I made one switch sides and in the end killed him with one of the, now 16/16, treasure chests.
---
I assume it triggers when playing Ancient of War but not when playing Druid of the Claw.
---
If so, what's wrong with that?
---
alright thanks for the heads up
---
i know i was just kidding. but i'm actually in the camp of players that are annoyed when they get highrolled by a lower percentage chance rather than a consistent one, so i'm actually less happy about this existing when aggro paladins have several lists that can stand on their own merits without having that 3 card highroll package that can't be answered if it hits.
---
if i had been serious though i would have pointed out that the explanation they gave for naga sea witch nerf fits 1:1 to situations barnes/big priest create, so im not sure arguing blizzards point of view is that solid of a ground to stand on in general. ;)
---
Eventually they'll run out of ideas and add it.
---
You can HIT minions with the weapon, and then execute them.
---
Come on, people.
---
Maybe he just had a full hand and wanted to empty it / was near fatigue. No need to be that salty.
---
Enrage: Your charge minions have +1 attack.
---
It’s not like there’s already a legendary that leaves your hero to a one card OTK.
---
And that legendary costs three times the mana.
---
And that otk is almost permanently available the rest of the game.
---
And that otk card has legitimate board control reasons to include
---
And that otk card has a variant use of healing too.
---
Yeah no that would make no sense.
---
Buff jarraxus 
---
Please do. My two regular copies and a golden copy yearn for the sweet release of death.
---
The joke is that is what a bm-ing opponent would say
---
That's pretty obvious tbh
---
you have to wait till she falls asleep then move your SOUL to the FIGHT box and attack her for some whopper dmg!!
---
overload is part of the effect of the spell. You dont use 3 times the mana to cast 3 times the spell. Zentimo only replicates the effect of the spell, and arcane artificer gives you armor **when you cast a spell**. Only 1 spell casted, so only 1 time armor, but 3 times the effect of such spell (including overload).
---
Hunters current power is fine right now. People are overhyping them so much, and there’s available counters for most of their decks right now.
---
In general, this meta is far more varied and healthier than Druidstone. Don’t see why they would nerf it, specially with a rotation that will heavily impact said hunters looming.

---
They really hate the deck, but in my experience it works well vs Priest and Odd Rogue (it also unfortunately does poorly vs Even Shaman), they're giving it way less credit than it deserves.
---
No deck gets onto the board faster and no deck kills faster on average, that's definitely a significant niche to fill.

Hmm.. maybe I'm missing something, but how does not having broken cards imply everything will be played on curve?

Furthermore, and while this is not an easy task, cards shouldn't be broken but they shouldn't be bland / boring either. It's a delicate act of balance.

Scalehide and Skitterer both came out during Witchwood (3 expansions ago), which was when Rexxar was most powerful.
---
Boomsday brought in 3 mediocre/bad Beasts (Loose Specimen, Subject 9 and Augmented Elekk) and Rumble added 4 more that are either underwhelming or just bad, situationally (Halazzi, Ornery Tortoise, Gurubashi Chicken and Helpless Hatchling) and one that isn't in the pool (Springpaw, which is too bad because a 1/1 rush would be great in the pool).
---
Witchwood added the two mentioned above plus Hunting Mastiff, Lifedrinker and Swamp Leech (along with Scaleworm and Night Prowler which both suck) which are all strong picks.  
---
Tl;dr - Rexxar was strongest after Witchwood and has become progressively weaker.

Thanks!
---
Most cards that are really strong are also situational cards or interactions which in some situations are really weak and in other situations really strong. Then you can build your deck around these interactions to skew the times they are strong in your favor.  
---
Let's take a simple example with a creature, but feel free to extrapolate. For 4 mana the average could be a 4/5 creature. This is the fair card.  
---
Then comes another card which is a 3/4 half the time and a 5/6 the other half of the time. Now this is also a fair card. However, what happens is that you build your deck in such a way that it's not a 5/6 half of the time, but rather 80% of the time. Now this feels oppressive in constructed play because 80% of the time it eats your 4/5 and leaves a 5/2 body.
---
So what can you do to make this fairer? Well maybe we take into consideration how much decks and strategy can bend the odds. So we make the upside weaker (f.ex Billigerent Gnome, Rabble Bouncer). Or we skew the likelihood that the upside will occur (f.ex Star aligner, mecha'thun).  
---
Say you strike the perfect balance here and you have them on average being as strong as the 4/5. Then.. why not play the 4/5? Remove the variance and the work you need to do.  
---
Then it turns into curvestone, where each turn you'll need to play a card that's stronger than your opponents last card. Less niche cards that are dead in hand until the correct turn. We've had this meta too. Wasn't enjoyed either.
---
Thing is, people enjoy different things. And some things need to be overpowered in certain situations to be justified a spot in the deck. You need to be able to use your 6 mana card to destroy 10 mana worth of the opponent, because otherwise you will never recover if you play off curve. 
---
In the meta that it was released into, 2 stars was quite accurate.  It took a significant series or nerfs to weaken aggro enough to make the card viable.
---
Volcano
---
 Equality-Wild Pyromancer/Consecration
---
Cataclysm
---
All just as easily answer a 12/12 as they do four 3/3s.
---
Then you have Mass Hysteria, Brawl, and Reckless Flurry which have a chance of being able to answer to the 12/12 depending on board state or armor.
---
Also you forgot Hunter's Mark-Candleshot as a good single removal, Spider Bomb, anything poisonous, vilespine slayer, unwilling sacrifice (i think it would see play in a meta with more 12/12s running around), and demonbolt.
---
I think you should also account for more single target delays or debuffs when considering this comparison.  Glacial Shard, Aldor Peacekeeper, Sunkeeper Tarim (6 mana but still), Shrink Ray (works on both but gets rid of more stats against the 12/12), most hunter traps work better against single target, and the multitude of mage and shaman freeze options.
---
a year and a half later.....
---
I answered my own question by finding [this!](https://www.innkeeper.com/)
---
thanks anyway!
---
The prevailing opinion in the community was that Keleseth was trash, and he didn't really see much play until the nerfs following KFT.
---
Beats some decks and loses hard to some of the top decks, that’s pretty much what tier 3 means. 
---
Jeez, what’s the username? They delete it before I can even see every time.
---
I think people think aggro is brainless, because you can play it that way, and still curb stomp slower decks with bad draws.  Honestly, aggro becomes much more think when you are against other aggro or tempo decks.  You can't just slam down all your cards without thought, or you lose.  I suppose there may be a bit of hold over from face hunter too.  That deck was scuzzy and mindless for the most part.  I watch a few videos of people playing with cardboard to cover their opponent's feild, so they weren't tempted to make trades.
---
What's the percent chance of getting Deathwing in my Arena draft pool?
---
tbf you didn't even need it there right? Fungalmancer between the 3/3 + left imp does the job.
---
Would personally go for Spellbreaker; more versatile and leaves a body.
---
Sure, this game is worthy. I would suggest you to try it for a couple months before spending. Play with what you have (you will lose a lot, but not cause the card, but cause you need to learn first), try the solo content with is very fun, and if you like ranked play for the next expansion, then buy the pre purchase.
---
I agree that it’s annoying to run into countless net decks, and that Hearthstone has an insane price to continue playing with good decks. But I don’t see the correlation you’re building between those two things.
---
If the price were lowered I think, if anything, there would be many more net decks. 
---
This only comes up because the recent cheap hunter decks. Before f2p didn't say a thing about netdecks because they couldn't afford them. Meaning, it's not only your usual netdecks, it's every single one having access to a high WR netdeck. And that IS annoying af.

I've played Valeera DK decks almost exclusively since Frozen Throne.  All her emotes are pretty trash and it makes me sad.  Most of them don't sound anything like the feeling you're trying to evoke.
---
Greetings = Where have you been hiding? (said ominously)

Yeah Reno priest DOES assemble a combo and win the game, spawn of shadows and cheap spells discounted with taurissan will 30 or even 60-0 you in one turn.

rAnK TWenTy
---
&gt; That opponent runs out of cards, has only 3 of them in their hands, and makes no move for 8 turns
---
8 turns of fatigue is 36 damage. Your opponent did nothing for 8 turns and you couldn't figure out a way to kill him? wtf were you doing? 
---
Agreed. But surely it's fairer everyone having access to a decent deck, and doesn't discourage new players who just get beat by people with hella expensive decks . 
---
Ok the user is already banned, I guess someone got to it. We’ll send to admin and see if they can do something.

---
Get Maiev 
---
This player stacked up 100 armor. I played againts druid.
---
I know this will sound rude and "toxic" for someone to say in a community, but maybe as an f2p you shouldn't be expecting to be able to perform at top levels at all times.
---
I only get bundles and sales. Other than that I'm f2p since I started in old gods. After one year, I was able to craft and afford whatever I wanted to play in the game. It's all about managing resources. The game isn't as unfair when it comes to obtaining stuff as some like to display. 
---
When is the next expansion and how can I know that? Can I know it directly from the game website? I will follow your suggestion. I don't lose alot atm but I died alot with the hero I want to be better with since I want to build a Deathrattle deck. I'm better with paladin since I loose lesser than the other hero's out there.
---
Why not just remove the card from buckets?
---
If you were a spider and your web started to unravel you'd say oops
---
I also love MTG Arena and obviously I'm not happy when a player surprises me with their plan but doesn't that just make them a good player with a great strategy. That's some 007 mecthuning right there. I want to be on their level of stealth. I get your anger. Because it's annoying. But it's not Blizzards fault when people play their games well. 
---
It's easy. You delivered simple bullshit to begin with. 
---
Do you know if any of these sites support a non pc player?  I play on my android phone and only have a chromebook.

Sure, this is the whole point. let's be mean with others, let's be toxic and waste time. *claps*

Doesn't change the fact you couldn't beat your opponent for 8 turns, with him taking a total of 36 damage anyways AND him not doing anything. That must really suck lmfao. 
---
Yeah shadowstrike Face
---
Why are you missing the point? They could've played it 8 turns earlier. The same combo. They had no restriction to play it. They literally chose to waste my time. That's not good playing, that has nothing to do with personal skill, deck building skill, anything. Just wasting time. It's like I have 5 malygos down and 2 swipes, and just waiting for the timer to almost expire, then use it only, while constantly spamming "well played".
---
Oh i totally agree. I don't expect to be at legend as a f2p player. I just don't think people should be ridiculed for relying on meta-stats to get info about which decks are good. The way I see it, it's not people being lazy for the most part, it's people wanting to know how to spend their resources wisely to get the best deck they can.

&gt; They never even pitched any idea whatsoever to the community about what the tournament mode beta would be, when it would be, or what format it would take.

Doesn’t Priest counter Hunter anyway? In any case, I really don’t mind Hunter being the top dog because they don’t have a combo archetype. I mean, okay, Zul’jin is kind of uninteractive because he has a solid chance of summoning a bunch of random Huffers, but at least I’m not getting hit in the face with infinite fireballs or losing the matchup when the game starts thanks to Mecha’thun. I don’t even play Hunter right now, but I need them around to keep combo down (though Control Priest can still spank Hunter with their 20 mind blast burst damage) 
---
what happened with whizbang the wonderful? seemingly gone from the game? the wiki of the card has no info either
---
&gt;**Interactive** Odd Warrior, Exodia Paladin, Control Priest are interactive?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Diverse** Druid is dead, Shaman has 1 playable deck, Mage is mediocre.  
---
&gt;**Stale** Can't be stale right? Cubelock, spell hunter, odd paladin/even paladin and odd rogue are these new archtypes we have never seen!!!!  
---
&gt;**Polarized** Odd warrior and Mechathun decks have tons of 50/50 matchups right??? lol  
---
&gt;**High skill level** Don't worry we nerfed Malygos Druid and removed Shudderwock and "nerfed" odd paladin so the skill decks can shine!! LMFAO
---
Deck list?
---
Yeah, and the casual audience is pretty much why they are so hesitant on nerfs in the first place.  If you came back to the game and found out your favorite class that you invested all of your resources in was absolutely destroyed, it might cause you to drop the game entirely.  
---
The Druid nerfs had to happen, but if you're a player who has been spending all of their dust on Druid legendaries and epics to have a competitive deck, you're pretty much running a dead collection until Druid gets some new cards.
---
Arena is never fun. Just stressful.
---

Still looking :(

Side note: the emote menu should show the actual words of the emote, not the generic names. Casuals like me who don't emote a lot often don't get what we expect.

Game barely changed. No new decks or cards being used with the exception of master's call and that was bound to pop up anyways. The best warlock deck right now was the best warlock deck this time last year. There was a spike in twitch views for about 2 days after the nerfs and its now back to as bad as it ever was. But they had to rush a change before Christmas.....
---
Which is why I’ve completely given up on videos featuring gameplay and narcissism and only watch videos where said streamer is DISCUSSING a particular topic or explaining a deck (rather than just clipped gameplay vod) or just watch the podcast style shows like omnistone, angry chicken or valuetown. 
---
Most emotes feel sarcastic and BM tbh lol
---
That rumble run was like impossible. Which shrine did you beat it with?
---
Yeah, that's true. That's why I'd love an additional format with all sets but where certain overused or broken cards continually get added to a ban list. (Maybe even using an algorithm based on winrate.) There are probably better names, but I would call it "Mild" ;D

Pro tip: brawl is about 210% more enjoyable if played under the influence of hallucinogens.
---
They are both hot garbage might as well run natural card draw IF you need that extra card draw. Only reason it might exist is high roll 2 free 4/4 otherwise the card is insanely bad.
---
Wild Growth was fine until they printed Ultimate Infestation and Spreading Plague.
---
We are here to suffer
---
Sets do go through stages, but at a certain point they get to the stages beyond the point where things can change. Cards get sent off for translation and typesetting and finalized coding and whatnot. I believe they've mentioned a six month window where the set is "finalized". Presumably they're already the final design stage of the August expansion and close to initial design for sets for 2020.
---
You can sharpen up your rock to have a better chance against paper, but yeah every card game is rps with some random draws.

Can we get designer insights into the awful Easter Egg brawl? "We thought matches were too fast, so we decided to give the player a hand full of useless cards and made each minion hatch from the egg with summoning sickness. RNG can be fun, so we thought having Sleepy Dragon and a 1/1 rabbit both come from the same pool makes really interesting decisions where you have to decide whether to concede or wait and hope your opponent happens to randomly disconnect so you can get your pack and leave."
---

Whoops I dusted my star aligners. 😔😔 
---
What was the opponents reaction?
---
Welcome to hell
---
yes this is serious question: is there ANY situation that warrior would want to play a Cursed Blade and they aim for the win?
---
The only problematic Hero cards are Gul'dan, Rexxar, Jaina, and Anduin.
---
* Gul'dan is waaay too much immediate value while also having a great hero power for the long game (Zul'jin is better balanced because his Hero Power isn't OP).
---
* Rexxar gives you an extra card every turn, and his cards are frequently better than Dream cards. Compared to Valeera, Hagatha, or Boom, Rexxar is miles better.
---
* Jaina potentially gives you endless 4 Mana Elementals for only 2 Mana. Factoring in the Lifesteal, and Icy Touch is almost on par with Jaraxxus's hero power.
---
* Anduin has been better balanced since Raza was nerfed, but he's still insane with Mind Blasts and Inspire-like effects. He's the only one that doesn't really need to be nerfed, but he's still very strong.
---
I can see them releaseng a card that is 4 mana 3/5 and if it hits a hero with armor it gets +2 attack
---
&gt; Deathrattle Hunter (play dead, terrorsale stalker, decilsaur egg)
---
&gt; Big beast(khatrena, charged devilsaur, play dead)

isent this the same deck?
---
Yeah when the ememy has 2 hp

### [**5-FEAT Scoring**](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/94iuee/the_exhaustive_comprehensive_definitive)
---
## *Lovely.* (Greetings, Valeera the Hollow)
---
**BM Damage:** 205% (+110% DoT)
---
**Weight:** Staggering
---
**Versatility:** 30%
---
**Peace of Mind:** Superb
---
**Swing:** 120%
---
**Weighted Score:** 91/100
---
One of the main reasons to trade in Valeera's already-strong emotepool for that of her Death Knight counterpart, *Lovely.* is a slow burner--it inflicts sizable BM damage on initial impact and then, if successfully struck at an opponent's weak point, continues to erode away their psyche over up to the next six turns, though this effect can be ended early by dealing significant BM damage to Valeera during this time. Evocative of a tight-jawed, mirthless, toothy grin, the smug sardonicism contained in this emote is certain to leave a gaping stab wound in the opponent's defenses, and is quite a strong offensive threat. It suffers mainly from its lack of value as a defensive tool, as it has a low chance of being able to successfully parry many other emotes, but its sheer offensive power and extremely high weight make it a treasured addition to any emote lineup.

I can tell you dont play wild if you think rexxar is actually an issue there. Most decks will just kill you or outvalue rexxar if you rely on it.

Nah, i don’t belive so. Imo deathratlle hunter focuses more on the egg when big beast focuses more on ondasta and kathrena

You’re an idiot

you have lethal and instead of doing so, you play immortal prelate, because why?

i would assume the vast majority of players haven't beat either of them with any of the heroes, have no interest in wasting their time making an actual attempt at it  that will almost certainly fail and just do the first 1 or 2 bosses repeatedly when they get the quest.

too bad it takes way too long to climb 25 ranks just to come to the actual game? so stupid, no point in playing if I have to use the same standard bad cards for that long. any way to get to 25 any faster?

Of course you think that...but the only reason you do is because Blizzard tricked you into thinking that with their stealth BM "well played" emotes.

That doesn't fix the fact that it will either be terrible or meta breaking. It's a bad design.

6/6/6 | Battlecry: Discard all weapons from your hand and gain their stats.  
---
Im clearly missing something lol how?
---
How
---
As others have said, it's often run in hyper-aggro warrior in wild. 
---
Your health doesn't matter if you swing the thing face every turn, and since you're aggro, typically your opponent is too busy trying to clear your board to capitalize on the extra damage you take. You do it turn 1 and you immediately put it face. This thing never hits a minion. Nothing in that particular warrior deck hits anything other than face.
---
It's not a tier 1 deck but it's pretty solid and cursed blade is something you're very happy to play turn 1 in that deck. 
---
I would be curious to see how this played out lol
---
Also doesn’t play around BGH after a certain point 
---
No, otherwise, it'd be the League of Legends chat, nothing but salt and anger, except worst.
---
What are you going to do with the match you won, and would you have preferred a pack instead?
---
Lyra generated it 
---
It's a potentially lethal BM weapon, but *Lovely.* can be disrupted by spammable emotes with strong versatility and swing potential like Morgl's *&lt;Hello, friend.&gt;* and Thrall's *I thank you.*, as the two keys to defeating this emote are 1) halting the cadence of her attack and 2) threatening a far stronger counterattack to discourage her from spamming it herself. If you have your heart set on going blow-for-blow with Valeera the Hollow, this scholar recommends Shadowreaper Anduin's *Uncanny!*--with a base BM Damage value of 235% and a hidden stackable debuff for the opponent which increases all BM damage taken by 10% for two turns, this emote will allow a judicious and dextrous BMer to defeat *Lovely.* in a straight DPS race.
---
Here's a very big 10 gold. Hunter is op plz nerf. My screen is blurry. This card that gives 2 random dragons gave me 2 copies of the same dragon! Blizzard should give us more free stuff. Why are people playing good decks against me this is hard. 
---
wild growth has always been a druid staple but not one that was too oppressive or complained about. it just formed the base of what druid did. 
---
Nourish was also extremely common always, but almost never for ramping, just for draw. Unless you were playing a Ramp deck with lots of big minions, you couldn't really afford the ramp part (once ancient of lore got nerfed especially)
---
Card advantage and ramping have always been at odds with each other, and they balanced each other out. You want to ramp? you'll be low on cards, so you better make a deck that can better rely on top deck (ie, has impactful higher-end cards). 
---
UI completely broke that balancing act by giving insane card draw for after you've ramped away all your cards. 
---
Just craft any tier 1 deck and grind. If you then cant get to rank 5, then it is not the deck but you that just needs improvement. There is a cheap midrange hunter deck that works  very well. Decks do not get better just because some cards are more expensive.
---
Sounds like the only way to play around this is to not play any class with a DK. 
---
Will try that out and let ya'll know how it goes. 
---
Got radiant elemental off of earthen might and then got the crow mage minion thing when I evolved something into a hex crow which let me fill my board
---
Biggest minion I made was 4 mana 369098752/184549376 using oasis snapjaw
---
There's nothing quite like playing a long match in Wild, then your opponent plays something that lets you know they're playing their own homebrew that looks interesting, and you reach for the "hello" button to say "Hey, your deck looks cool"...
---
...but what comes out is "The cycle of decay begins", which feels like "that card is bad, you put it in your deck and you should feel bad".
---
...and then, because you're playing a much better homebrew than they are, with Malfurion, Jades, Hadronox, and N'Zoth, you beat them...
---
...and you try to say "Well Played", but all that comes out is "Masterful", i.e. "I beat you because I'm better at the game."
---
...and then your opponent goes and subs to r/fuckdruid...
---
...and then Blizzard responds to the hatred of Druid by nerfing Wild Growth and Nourish...
---
...and it's all because you couldn't express your feelings.
---
Double death + wax elemental+double health+all draw
---
All classes have tier 1 or 2 decks. And a variety of decks into those tiers too.
---
Popularity =/= balance
---
Nozdormu doesn’t work in solo adventures. Neither does mindbreaker 
---
like your pathetic life
---
I don’t even understand how this is debatable. The problem is there are people who will defend *any* retarded decision Team 5 makes because Blizzard can do no wrong. 
---
Be less concerned with value and more concerned with performance.
---
Out value him even more with my infinite bigger men jade druid 
---
Yeah sadly it's been something people have complained about for a while. You are right that it is missing health that is taken into account, but the wording make it seem like it's just damage taken even if you healed.
---
Can you still buy it twice?                
---
I was a F2P player but I bought the welcome bundle twice.  Well worth the investment 50+ cards for 5$
---
If you do get it turn one, wouldn’t it still be kind of poor to use on minions since their attack damage you take is doubled? At that point it’s a 1 mana 6 damage spell that takes 3 turns to use
---
Imo Blizzard should just make the whole classic card set F2P. It would make it soooo much more new player friendly and I doubt that they still sell a lot of classic packs. Most of the money's gotta be in selling expansion packs.
---
That would still create the same problem (Shaw gives rush passively to minions, whether they're summoned after Warsong Commander hits the board or not).
---
I get your point though, and I agree - it'd be nice to get Warsong Commander back to some level (maybe with a Battlecry instead or something).
---
I'm playing a dragon shudderwock list. It's probably not the best version but it's fun and kind of memey
---
Yes, in original hearthstone high value cards in general were a lot worse than they are now
---
Hell, ironbark protector was one of the best 7+ ones, now he isn't even worth a look
---
If you're not running other jade cards, then it'll only summon a 1/1 or a 2/2 at turn 10, as opposed to drawing you a card, which means it's probably right to run Wild Growth unless you're running other parts of the jade package.  
---
I liked the idea of an Alex effect of setting target hero's armor to 10
---
It reduces armor of armor classes, and gives armor to non-armor classes. I think that's the way to do it. Granted, the armor classes have ways to recover from that very easily, but it's still something to think about.
---
Ahh I see. So at the time it just entirely ruled standard. That’s crazy. 
---
I agree, but random legendaries is more entertaining. That actually wouldn't be the worst random brawl ever...
---
Generally agree, however at 10 mana with Jade deck the Blossom should probably give you something bigger than 2/2. Sometimes a lot bigger.
---
And before ultimate infestation was nerfed it also oppressed aggro. 
---
I used to play Mage. A lot of Mage and then I branched out to Priest, Hunter, Warlock, Warrior. Never gotten into Druid, Shaman and Paladin.
---
How is it clunky? It's incredibly smooth while still giving you options to do things. HS just has you check out during your opponent's turn which is kind of ruining the game in the long turn. 
---

They nerfed it recently (December 19, 2018) so that it's 3 mana. They also hit Nourish (now 6) Level Up! (now 6) and made significant changes Leeching Poison (cheaper but only gives your weapon lifesteal for 1 turn, as opposed to permanently) and less significant changes to Saronite Chain Gang (now always summons a 2/3 Saronite Chain Gang, as opposed to a buffed copy of the chain gang, or a Shudderwock)
---
Any deck relying on card advantage and spell damage remvoal can fall back on thalnos.
---
Were you playing against a warlock that played a rotspring early on? That might have been me lol. 
---
Needs a Flare in there somehow
---
Yeah no shit but this is more specific than just "a screenshot", several of my points would count as screenshots
---
&gt; So if you're not running other jade cards
---
In what world is Loti the only viable card from Rastakhan? Are we forgetting about Pounce, Stampeding Roar and Treespeaker? If you're gonna argue that Loti is more relevant because it's played in combo decks (which it isn't), then Pounce is still better because it's popularly played in Mecha'Thun Druid.
---
Also what is this nonsense about Token Druid playing second fiddle to combo decks? Token Druid has been the best Druid deck for most of the year, only briefly losing to Malygos Druid during late Witchwood/early Boomsday. During Boomsday, it was even the best deck in the game until Giggling nerf.
---
I think OP was talking only about only non-jade decks when referencing the Simmons 
---
Thanks again for the tips.  I had a fairly complete classic set (a few scattered cards missing here and there).  So I will probably do some ladder, some arena, and mostly save up!
---
All emotes are BM and people that use them are trash.  Even with instantly squelching I can see your dumpster ass hovering on your portrait to emote.  Pathetic.
---
Probably because you only need to beat it once for the card back, not every class. 
---
I managed to beat it with discard warlock shrine and a bunch of good RNG. 
---
I find that even if you have a completely insane deck, you often won’t manage to win unless you get lucky with your bosses. Some bosses, like wardruid Loti or warmaster Voone are ridiculously hard at boss 7 or 8. 
---
I’ve also found that you can’t rely solely on your shrine to win. For instance, the discard warlock shrine often suffered from small hand sizes and lack of value in the late game, meaning you wouldn’t be able to discard anything, and if you tapped you would fatigue. To avoid this, I chose two of the treasures that filled my hand with random spells. 
---
It was the random spells that ended up winning me boss 8: Paladin. By the end of my final match, my shrine was almost useless. My opponent’s hand was empty, and all I had to do was maintain board control, which I was able to do thanks to the random spells I got. 
---
For instance, I managed to cast [[spellbender]] on Thekal’s [[spikeridged steed]], which probably saved me from losing. 
---
Its even worse on vanilla wow servers

You should probably relax a bit.  Maybe unsub from here for a while if it gets you this riled up.
---
Gadgetzan definitely had the most. Had the balance team existed back then, probably coulda been one of the most enjoyable metas for awhile. 
---
You don't want to do the trading yourself as PW if you can help it. [You're the beatdown deck](http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/3692_Whos_The_Beatdown.html), so you should be pushing for as much face damage as possible, and make your opponent deal with the threats that you put down. It's fine if you have to use a weapon charge to deal with a minion, because your life total doesn't matter. If you're in a position where you have to constantly use your weapon on the defensive to control the board, you've pretty much already lost, and not running Cursed Blade wouldn't have helped you.

Good reward, i am happy

Been playing a shitty version of it and it’s pretty fun, can I see your list? 
---
Thanks and happy 2019 as well! Gonna try spiteful priest later but thia deck is quite strong right now
---
Cards with such a Keyword will end up typically being defensively statted due to the extremely offensive nature of such a keyword, and as I had said in the initial comment, such minions would never be on the board long enough to deal that extra damage as decks with a lot of armor gain tend to play quite a few pieces of spot removal.
---
It says "at 1-2"
---
I choose to doubt your weird explanation that they linearly "develop, test, develop, test" one brawl at a time, because that's a ridiculous claim to make. They're likely working on multiple brawls at once, but this still doesn't mean that one single brawl takes less than a week to create. 
---
Looking at how Hearthstone release cycle works, I'd argue it's likely they prepare multiple brawls in a shorter period of time when they have lull time between expansions, but that's just a guess.
---
Classic being near worthless means Blizzard can hand out classic packs with more abandon, especially for newer players. This is useful as a reward mechanism for milestones and weekly events. They can give veterans 40+ classic packs a year and it won't be too crushing to newer players that join later. Like I've gotten hundreds more packs as a budget player over 3 years than a newer budget player, but over half of it is Wild. My Classic stuff means I have Preperations, Doomsayers and Brawls, but those only account for so much in Standard. The New Player Experience is served by Classic being a medium powered set with lots of defining cards at Common and Rare. Stuff like Blizzard, Dire Wolf Alpha, Doomguard,  Flame Imp, and the like that can enhance natural strategies found with Core cards. 
---
This also means that $5 bundles "cost" Blizzard much less as they value the asset less. However,  they keep the retail high to avoid a dust crisis and to keep players appreciating the cheap and free Classic packs.
---
I started playing a little over a month ago. I got pretty lucky with legendary cards in my first 20 packs, to the point where I now question if they artificially pumped up my luck because i was a beginner.
---
I have basically realized that it'll take a year to get decent decks. Tbh, if it wasn't for my friends calling me to play with them, I might not have kept playing.
---
But now that it's been a month, I am fairly happy with the game. I may not have great decks, and I might still make mistakes, but they match me up with similar players, so it all works out.
---
Yup it's random spells. I picked Druid and got Predatory Instincts and Witching Hour. Both totally dead cards.
---
You too? Let's rejoice against these nasty Priests! 
---
Find a new ~~game~~ girlfriend. 
---
Chose paladin and I got prince Liam on turn 5 because of a mirror match, would recommend not picking paladin to avoid this being done to you! 
---
They had a special? Where they let you buy it again and the guarantee legendary was a dragon card. Can someone confirm if they still allow you to buy the welcome bundle twice
---
Anduin: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
---
I was a Priest and opponent discovered Dragon soul LOL
---
Preach.
---
For some reason when I play my hunter deck (its not an aids deck, its quest hunter), i always come up against another hunter. Then i play tespionage rogue and i always come up against another rogue, which meant my tess couldn't do jack. Explain matchmaking
---
Im already tra-Anduin
---
I'm not suggesting that they have to do the development all in a single week leading up to the event, but that it takes longer than a week to complete all the required activities. If it takes more than a week to complete, then they clearly cannot release a new brawl each week even if they have 2-3 done that they release in a row.
---
Definitely the bad guy
---
Treespeaker is in 6.6% of Druid decks and is one of the best performing cards in Token Druid. Pounce is worse than Spellstone but they are run together in Mecha'Thun Druid (and is hardly filler since it's vital for early board control with Pyromancer/Spellstone). If those Loti options were decent for most Druid decks then why do none of them run her?
---
I dont get it. What am I missing?
---
Underrated comment
---
It’s awkward now but we’re going to be blessing that the minute the overpowered cards rotate out. I’m happy that they’re combatting power creep. We had arguably 4 expansions in a row of absurdly overpowered cards before witchwood (MSoG, Un’Goro is the arguable part, KFT, and KnC), and I really don’t think the game was better off.
---
I honestly dont even feel i play that many Hunters. Are they more common? Yeah obviously. But I don't roll my eyes when I see a mirror. Maybe because I'm playing it. Idk lol
---
They played double hallucinations on turn one, and tavern brawl is the hallucinations one so it’s like the same thing 
---
Yeah that's definitely not normal, but I don't play on a mac so I'm afraid I can't be more helpful than that.
---
...
---
4. Profit
---
Oow yeah Im an idiot for not checking the history bar XD

Wouldn't "contest mode" be appropriate for this thread.

Dude I dont even think that the guy that wrote the code for the Hearthstone AI is able to explain how the code works. AI has been stupid AF for years. But it makes for fun moments.
---
Ignoring that you got the Odd/Even versions wrong, over the years Blizzard has printed a number of Shaman Overload cards that allow you to play a minion 1-2 turns earlier than you normally would by “overloading” your mana for your next turn.  Additionally, Blizzard has printed a number of cards that benefit from board presence/tokens, and in some cases specifically Totems as tokens.  In Wild this has reached a critical mass of cards where Shaman is able to put out oversized minions earlier than most opponents (besides Priest) can deal with them.  Even though most of the cards are fairly coasted factoring in the Overload, getting them out 1-2 turns early allows the deck to take control of the board, even from aggro decks like Odd Rogue and Pirate Warrior, and snowball face damage extremely quickly.
---
Even Shaman also benefits from strong damage spells, including Crackle which utilizes Overload to put out a lot of damage either to a minion or face for cheap that turn; the snowballing nature of Jade cards; and Devolve and Thing From Below both being undercosted.
---
That sounds like a good approach. I think more people would jump in if they felt they could pick and choose which discussion to add to, or start their own freely. I think suggestion topics are a good opener to the thread, especially if hot meta topics are trending after nerfs, a new expansion/patch etc, and you can just see where that discussion goes. Just make it clear it's inviting to any hearthstone related discussion and I think people will join in. 
---
Yes?
---
Odd Mage happened and ungoro will cycle soon. Rip.
---
Yes, it's not like they were up against a deadline and ran out of time to finish it. They actually thought that brawl was good enough.
---
Bad
---
Any kind of aggressive, midrange, or control strategy that doesn’t rely on ramping up to UI or Spreading plague has been overshadowed for over a year now. 
---
And yes, both of those cards are busted. But they’re more manageable when they come down on the turn they’re supposed to, instead of 2, 3, or 4 turns early. 
---
I don't still, I just switched to Odd Mage but I would pair it up with dragons. Look at Brian Kibler's dragon quest priest, my deck was very loosely based on that.
---
Sore loser doesn't inherently mean angry, also means just whiny or complaining about a loss. Which I would think this is, personally, as the complaint is 'these mechanics aren't skillful enough.'
---
I got a Tess off a rogue, free hand and board refill anyone? Oh, and that 2 mana minion to let me shuffle 3 more into my deck, and gral the shark to tutor one of the tesses back out.
---
Outtempo him easily with basically any deck because he's extremely slow.
---
You need to run Kill Command.  The difference between 6 and 7 wolves is not nearly as much as the difference between 0 and 10 face damage in your deck.
---
The old Paper Rock Scissors balancing:
---
* Spell Hunter beats Midrange Hunter
---
* Midrange Hunter beats Deathrattle Hunter
---
* Deathrattle Hunter beats Spell Hunter
---
Looking good Hearthstone.
---
Last time they released an expansion.
---
Seriously though buffed/reworked old cards would be so great, currently you have your collection and generally speaking it deteriorates.
---
Some cards become playable later but generally card archetypes are strong enough to make a card switch from one end of the playability spectrum to the other.
---
Strong card synergy either breaks an older card and wording tends to be very simplistic.
---
Maybe they should buff base HP of heroes and revert some aggro nerfs then buff Jarraxus.
---
Looks like there's an issue with your host for the lineup images; I'm getting Error: 403 Forbidden when trying to access them.
---
In arena it is still very close to being a river crocalisk.  You're just as likely to bring them just close enough to draw deathwing when they need it as you are to milling it.  
---
Dlc to get all of them
---
sounds like a boring deck to play
---
Lichking would agree
---
Linessa Control Pally (which existed in negligible amounts) also ran the card because it was so busted.
