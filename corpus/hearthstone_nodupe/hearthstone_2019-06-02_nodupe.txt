Good God does the Void Singularity Brawl deck suck.  Its full of 5+ cost minions, so I always fucking die before I even get to do anything.
---
---
---
I hit rank 5 for the first time last night as well.  Congrats!
---
And repeating the new Hagatha and Horror battlecries is pretty good.
---
SHIEEEELLLLLDDDD SMASHHHHHHHHADU!!!!
---
&gt; I've been wondering for a while why no one talks about Rover. 
---

---
Because it's like...the 10th most played warrior card (gets cut decently often), isn't always a 2-of when it does get run.
---
And well...also in general it's not great gameplay if Warrior is a helpless kitten on turn 1, and an unstoppable killing machine on turn 10.  This leads to very polarized matchups.  I'd rather Warrior have a solid turn 1 and a solid turn 10, than Warrior have a pathetic turn 1, and an unbeatable turn 10.
---
Well Gallywix currently owns Gatzetan as the mayor (unless Blizzard decides to change it because f'ing up old lore with retcons and idiotic twists is their forte) and has been supplying the entire Horde before Garrosh 2.0 took over
---
Congrats my dude!
---
Midrange hunter is the best deck right now maybe Control Shaman might be the answer. I would have suggested rogue but they suck right now after the nerfs.
---
Not gonna lie it looks badass

---
Jhin mains crying everywhere
---
Generally in Wild, if you want to win (without playing Big Priest yourself), you either need to play a very aggressive deck or a combo deck. Control doesn't really work anymore unless you're just trying to have fun. Most aggressive decks have at least a 50/50 shot vs Big Priest, and generally just hope to burst them down before a Statue hits the board. If you're looking for something cheap, aggro is probably your best option.
---
If you are specifically looking for a competitive deck that wins 95% of the time vs Big Priest, Exodia mage is your best option. It's not ideal against all of the aggro on the ladder,  but I'd say it's low tier 2 or high tier 3 right now. Pretty boring to play after a while, though.
---
Mage Priest and Druid are different
---
What has he ever done to you?
---
With token druid or in general?  If you're asking how to improve the token druid matchup you should know that in general that matchup is favorable for you.  Generally you want to try and make their unleash the hounds and scavenging hyena turn (turn 5) not good for them.  If they use dire frenzy on a life drinker then you're going to want to try and kill them as fast as possible.  This is one of the matchups where trying to keep 3 or 4 minions of average size is better than going wide with a bunch of low health minions or going all in on one minion.  If you want a deck that "counters" midrange hunter that isn't token druid then you could try rogue, but token is already one of the best decks against midrange hunter so it probably isn't necessary to change.
---
strange that you think any1 would care for your opinion. if he played only aggro than he doesn't have any skill.
---
It is difficult to play, you can't fully trust the data for a deck like that.
---
Not that it would have mattered since you had lethal without the free stuff...
---
Are you fucking kidding me?  Whats aggro about all your cards costing 5 mana or more?  I cant even do anything most matches until turn 5, and by then Im already dead.
---
Blizzard is incredibly reluctant to give Priests a good midrange archetype, it's sad.
---
I don't even think that'll work, since he'd die immediately.
---

---
No it's not. Warrior has been one of the best control decks because it's always had extremely efficient removal. Back when Execute was 1 mana they essentially had four 1-mana cards in their deck that deleted any minion of their choosing, no matter how big. Combine that with some solid rush/charge minions and lots of whirlwind effects and board clears, and that's why control warrior has been one of the better control decks. 
---
If your opponent is actually attacking you then the Priest hero power is generally better as it can threaten to keep minions alive for a very long time, and hero powers like Mage are far better at removing little shits off the board and, more often than not, gain you far more than 2 extra health in the long run. 
---
Warrior is just one of the only classes with good control tools in its basic/classic set. Priest, Warlock, and Mage rely heavily on cards like Dragonfire Potion, Dragon's Fury, Shooting Star, Defile, Voidlord, and Amethyst Spellstone to keep up with the power creep that aggressive decks have seen over the years. When those rotate out, so do the control decks. 
---
I'll grant you that against other, non-Warrior control decks the armor gain is quite helpful but the kind of armor gain that helps you win in fatigue situations usually comes from actual cards like Shield Block, Bring It On, Drywhisker Armorer, DKs, Justicar Trueheart, Gadgetzan Armorsmith, regular Armorsmith, and of course, the subject of the thread, Eternium Rover.
---
It... it is a beast.
---
WiCkEdOnE#2872, trading 80g quest on EU, I show you go first
---
can confirm, tried it a couple of months ago and it worked.
---
Because when nerfs happens, you can abuse your deck for a easy 12 wins if the nerf is big enough.
---
I believe it's because Southsea is a conditional charge
---
That's where I was hoping this would lead.
---
Meta will be lightning fast. Mech synergy will be relevant but not game defining.
---
Paladin has some of the best earlygame tools (muster, minibot, coghammer) and some disgusting magnetic mechs that double as curve plays (glowtron, annoyo-module). Easy Tier 1
---
Druid also has crazy tempo tools. Living roots, robo-cub, druid of the saber, etc. List goes on and on. They also have good midgame tools like tending tauren, mech bear cat, and savage combatant. Doesn't have crazy mechs but doesn't need them. Tier 1 IMO.
---
Mage can't tempo as well as the previous 2 classes but it has enough bullshit that it can probably still perform well anyways. CC, both portals, flamecannon - a lot of really tilting RNG cards here. That's not even touching into the absurd mech synergy mages have like blastmage and snowchugger. Tier 1.
---
Priests have crazy early game (cleric, extra arms, shrinkmeister, velen's chosen) but they have a lot of bad cards as well. They can definitely succeed, but the extent to which they will do so is questionable. Their ROS package is great, though, and it's still around. Tier 2
---
Rogue is in a very similar position to priest. Good but not great at playing for tempo, has a good toolset from ROS (miscreant, contract, burglar). The main difference is that rather than having a few absoultely busted cards, Rogue has a sizeable amount of good cards. Assuming that microadjustments are reverted, rogue will be Tier 2 IMO. If not, tier 3. 
---
Hunter has really high quality cards. But the class is in a bit of an identity crisis going forward (which is true for most of the following ones as well). It has both good tempo tools (glaivezooka, venomizer) as well as the value tools from ROS (marked shot, unleash). Neither are particularly crazy but both playable enough. Probably still tier 2.
---
Warlock has a really bad set of cards in this pool. EVIL Genius in zoo decks can still win games on its own, but the lack of enforcer and felfire will likely greatly hurt the standings. It's good cards (watcher, implosion, imp) just aren't good compared to what the other classes gain. Tier 3.
---
Shaman is likely the least impacted by the rotation. The class gains (zap-o-matic, maelstrom portal, totem golem, etc.) about as much as it loses (4 mana 7/7, claws, evolve, etc.). Bloodlust and Walking Fountain still seem like the best wincons for the class. Tier 3.
---
Warrior sucks. Their GVG and TGT cards are not really worth talking about. Same goes with Kara, outside of Fool's Bane. Boomsday has the absolutely busted supercollider (which is an epic and won't appear as often), and decent cards in assembly and dyno-matic, but often these won't be enough to make it stand out. The class cannot tempo and control really hurst without warpath, roar, or militia commander. Probably Tier 4.
---
Had somebody do that same thing to a field of 1/1 Cloning Gallery clones, here come the big boys.
---
Did i dust my cards too early?  After the game patched last week i dusted, but only ended up with around 6k dust... Did i dust too early?
---
I think that it’s fascinating that they are STILL using art from the TCG in Heathstone as recent as Rastakhan’s.
---
Nice.
---
Cant wait to lose games because I cant answer a turn 2 mechwarper #SecondAgain
---
Is there something I'm missing here that's not super obvious in the picture?
---
That's really not the case in constructed. If anything, what you said proves the opposite point: The same players keep getting the top 16, despite this game having multiple years in the running. No other e-sports has that kind of streak, not even Magic the Gathering.
---
Players age out of competitive skill based games. Hearthstone isn't a competitive skill based game. It's a competitive gambling game. Hearthstone is much more in line with Texas Hold'em then throwing darts.
---
Yet, even in Texas Hold'em you don't see the same players in EVERY tournament. That's partially due to the digital nature of this game, but it's more due to the fact that the only reason why the same people keep topping is that it's their fucking job.
---
The only bar to Legend is time investment. The only bar to top 100 in Legend is time investment. The only bar to the top 20 in Legend is also time investment. If you paid all of my bills, and I could sink 12 hours into this game without losing my mind, I too would get top legend all the time. You would too.
---
Because at the end of the day, there are decks with high win rates that are mind boggling boringly simple to play. I hit a considerably high number in Legend when Undertaker Zoo was a thing. It was an amazingly easy deck to play, that had very unfair matchups. And this game is FULL of those decks. 
---
If you want to hit legend just do this: Play the game for 8 hours a day, pick a deck that has a 53%+ winrate, and a duration of less than 6 minutes.  Oh look.
---
https://hsreplay.net/decks/zBIJy80UbyGGAPvK2OAhsd/
---
It's Zoolock. Just like I knew it would be. This shit isn't hard. Reynad has been doing it since Hearthstones inception. It's not about skill to hit legend - it's about time investment. And when you hit legend... you just keep playing more hours than the other legend players.
---
Maybe you switch a couple of cards out in your deck. Or you keep track of your stats and realize that at this rank of legend you hit more warrior or whatever, and you play a counter deck that's just as easy to play and with just as high of a win rate - again, not hard to do.
---
Arena is a different beast and I agree with you there. Krip is very skilled in arena, probably the best at it.

&gt; Think about it, if you played your hero hagatha, you ALREADY nuked your own board, so you probably won't worry about killing it again, no?
---
Well if you play them exactly on turn 8 and 9 no, but it doesn't always happen that way.
---
But what I was talking about is mainly the Shudderwock generated board; I listed the benefit of using Shudderwock (generate 1-1, sometimes 1-3, etc..) but if the hagatha battlecry happens after these, then you generate nothing, thus it's a 9 mana 6-3 that puts 1 or 2 lackey in your hand, and a random horror. That's hella expensive.

Against Zoo players, a turn 1 Rover is often an insta concede, especially if they don't have a Flame Imp on turn 1.

You're right, I read it again now and I think I just thought it should be more explicitly stated since I found it hard to imagine there being both a pack and gold in the reward section. Also isn't a pack always better then 50, 60 or 80g?
---
Anyway, pretty unnecessary reaction, but at least I got my answer, being that other people don't think it isn't explicit enough. Guess it wasn't as infuriating as I remember it.
---

Yeah sorry I misrembered it a bit, I just thought it wasn't explicit *enough*.

Give it +1/+1 with the Captured Flag or other handbuffs and then it becomes a 4 mana 1/1. Better than the darkness

That’s true too

Perhaps we're just playing Druid in a much different manner.  I've found that scamming people with hand vomiting stats has been most successful.  The 1 mana matters a ton there.
---
Ziliax doesn't win the gane on its own. It just does something for almost all decks. Aggro decks love the rush to push through taunts, and lifesteal helps in the aggro mirror. Control loves the lifegain and spot removal that also eats at least 1 attack/spell from your opponent next turn.

---
Can‘t you just tell me which website has an accurate meta list?

What class is skillful then? Hunter is even more streamlined. Token Druid is pretty straightforward. Zoo is as hard as it's always been. If Warrior is brainless then I'd say the only "skillful" meta deck is Cyclone Mage, in which case Warrior is far from the problem.
---
You guys are saying all the things that I felt too. What really pisses me off is I spent $20 for the campaign expansion to get this card and it turned out to be a piece of crap. Absolutely disappointed.
