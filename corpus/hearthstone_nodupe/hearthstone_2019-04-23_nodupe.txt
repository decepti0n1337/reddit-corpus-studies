&amp;#x200B;
---
That's pretty different, compared to Warlock (or Warrior to some). Rafaam is evil, so is Gul'dan.
---
Nozdormu has not purpose in the current meta. It is strictly a fun card that no one runs.
---
And the worst part? Baku and Odd Paladin, the reason why it was nerfed into an even cost? It was HoF'd, so now there's no excuse for Equality costing 4 mana.
---
That's the thing is that this card is poorly designed even though it isn't overpowered or overplayed. OP isn't the only way a card can be bad, and like I said it affects certain players more than others.

Don't have emotional relationships with companies.  Don't hate them, but especially don't love them.  If you think what they're selling is worth what they're charging, buy.  If you enjoy the game at the amount your comfortable playing, play.  If you think your friend would do both of those, recommend.  But never care, a company cannot.

How about if the new hero was altered so that you could tell that it was a new edition - different colour garments or something?
---
Ever since the random card back was introduced, I am not as keen to acquire old card backs -- it does seem like cheating -- but I really like seeing them in my opponent's hand -- some of the artwork is just awesome.
---
What struggles do you have?
---
- Archivist - makes the game look like random crap on camera = bad press.
---
- Barnes/Warlock spell - breaking wild.
---
The pickaxe is a candidate (too good, too reliable) and I believe the forest thing that creates treants as death rattle will be HoFed.
---
If you want to play long games classes, you get long-games. it's simple as that.

Games ending 3-7 minutes if you play aggro.
---
This was basically my experience as well. Used to do all the pre-orders + another $50-$100 each expansion and would be left feeling cheated with how little of the decks I wanted to make after spending so much money.

After a couple years of not playing I'm now jumping back in but only planning to do F2P. (my drop money on the single player content)

Haha thanks for posting this. I haven’t seen this in a long time and my god the animation quality was so good! :)))
---
Lets nerf a card that no one ever put in any deck in all of Hearthstone history!
---
yeah i think it would be really cool if you opened a craft whatever legend card. honestly i would rather get a craft your own legend than a golden legend as it feels bad disenchanting a legend even if its not one you were planning on using.
---
&gt;There aren't different versions of this sub either
---
Yes there are.  If you don't like this post, read a different one.  If you don't like that user, block them or whatever, you won't see their posts.  Reddit, unlike Blizzard, is not a monolithic entity.
---
&gt;how I would know that you are right compared to professionals?
---
You could weigh my statements on their merit???  What???  How do you think people become professionals?  They are game designers because they are good at what they do, they are not good at what they do because they are game designers.  Game designers do not have the monopoly on knowledge of what is fun in a game.
---
&gt;And repetitive gameplay is a good or a bad thing?
---
Both!  It's good when the game is a little bit predictable, otherwise there's no strategy.  But it's not good when it's too predictable, because then it's boring.
---
&gt;The only decks that didn't have counters ... , Blizzard nerfed
---
Blizzard also nerfs decks that do have counters.  Even if a deck has counters, if the counters are weak in the meta, then the deck is too strong.  Hell, even if the deck *isn't* too strong, sometimes it gets nerfed anyway if it's really unfun to play against, like Quest Rogue.
---
&gt;You seriously believed that this sub's complaining did it lol?
---
You can't prove that the sub has nothing to do with nerfs, and I can't prove that it did have to do with nerfs, so we're just going to have to ignore this point.  We can't really prove if complaining is good or bad as far as motivating good changes to the game goes.
---
&gt;Why they don't nerf Barnes
---
Well, that's because they know they can freely ignore Wild, they've been doing it for years... but like I said, we're not going to prove things one way or another here.  I'm pointing out that there is an argument, I'm not claiming that the argument is correct.
---
&gt;point out an online card game with at least those parameters
---
I can point out an online game that's better than Hearthstone pretty easily, MTGA is a better game than hearthstone.  If that's what you want.  I wouldn't say MTGA is 95% perfect or anything, but at least the devs seem like they're trying.
---
&gt;on them it's not really mistakes.
---
What does that matter to me?  If they make the game more expensive on purpose, you want me not to complain about that?  I understand it, I don't think it's likely to change if I complain, but complaining seems like just about the only thing I can do about that.

---
Nomi works because it’s difficult to deal with that. Either you run priest down with damage what can prove to be difficult or leave for mid/late game and somehow find 3 board clears or a way to kill 7 6/6. Note that between you likely to have to deal with at least 2 7/8 0 mana, up to 4 if he uses the sense on that. It’s not uncommon priest have nomi on table on turn 9.
---
Wild decks can win by turn 4/5/6 (or have the game virtually sealed, such as Y'Shaarj in Big Priest's resurrect pool).
---
Standard decks may be able to win some games (Aggro Druid is powerful in both formats, with the Wild version only having about 10 Wild exclusive cards to boost the power level), but Standard decks are not tuned to beat the extreme power of Wild.
---
There are Wild decks that are very cheap (Inner Fire Priest, Silence Priest, Aggro Druid, Mech Hunter), so I would recommend trying those rather than a Standard deck.
---
I actually find the Elysiana games fun most of the time, and I'm not the only one. That's what a lot of divisive cards come down to- a lot of people enjoy them, a lot don't, and a lot don't care that much either way. It's just that those who don't like them tend to be the loudest, because why make a big deal if you're mostly happy?
---
youre implying that a few f2p kids bragging about keeping their empty wallets away from blizzard is in any way shape or form going to cause a slight drop in revenue. blizzard is a gaming titan and doesnt need to adhere to the rules that f2p players want them to play by, they make the rules and profit harder due to that. their stock and shareholder security isnt reliant on a small minority of f2ps that are willing to boycott them over a reddit circlejerk. monopolization is quite a factor that you are undermining here... thats really how multi billion dollar marketplaces work. ignore the niche broke kids on reddit and price for the mainstream audience with money to spend.
---
On wild? Just play shudder with loatheb and the 5 Mana copy guy
---
I have Tyrande but some of the old card backs I missed due to being unable to play. It would be awesome to have a chance to get them
---
I think they'll add some cards with Rush to the classic set. Since it's such a great keyword and they seem to use it a lot it would make sense that new players are introduced to it in the classic set.
---
Start of game:  The game begins.
---
It affects certain players more than others because it’s supposed to be primarily used as a tech card. After future expansions, a meta may develop which involves a combo which requires a lot of time, such as APM priest from last year. In the new specialist format, we may see more Nozdormu (although unlikely). Nonetheless, I think he has his niche place and is designed well, even though it’s a weak card.
---
Thanks for the downvote and the armchair market analytics, but I'm explaining to you how it is, not how I think it should be.
---
What was the nerf?
---
you can't seriously suggest that Kazakus warlock, priest and Mage felt like the same class... they played totally different.
---
Same with jade cards the class set really changed how you played with them, Druid was dominant and relied on ramp/going infinite but jade rogue while less dominant played totally different (focusing more on copying/bounce effects to grow jades and in my opinion was infinitely more fun to play)
---
You really don't need Nomi, shudderwock is already a 6/6 so just use 3x doppelgangster (with zola)
---
Big warrior is still control warrior. It's not a mirrored decklist but the whole point is you don't need Elysiana. If Elysiana is your only win con vs control...of course it's going to warp the match up lol.

---
YOU FACE SHARAXXUS!!!
---
If the other player stalls the win then I'll concede. I get the want to do the finishing blow on someone but if you're going to take forever to kill me I won't give you the satisfaction.
---
Pilfer is pretty cool right now and Tome of Intellect was alright with Quest Mage.too. Call of the void was really the only lame one.
---
if you are running carpet it only buffs 1 cost units. that card is a 2 cost.
---
Thanks rank 5 is passable I suppose, not true control though. Is the Amani + Oondasta the good one?
---
You will be fine when you have your druid golden hero.
---
&gt;Jaziel
---
I think pally is winning because of Rogue and Warrior. Warrior struggles a lot with deathrattle, specially in a meta that doesn't ask much for silence( people already started to tech against that, but having to tech with silence and weapon removal and keep the deck consistent is almost impossible). And rogue is running the clock. If pally can drop one or 2 big minions( a good prismatic lens/Duel can do that), or Shirvallah and stabilise it's over for rogue (that in my experience as rogue in that match, I haven't tried pally yet).
---
If you were playing ranked then it’s 100% fine.
---
If you queued token druid into casual you probably should feel a little guilty.  But ranked? That’s what ranked is for.
---
Pretty sad he got the boot from standard :(, I loved the old zoolock deck with him in it.
---
Source?
---
They were removed because they were consistently bad with every set. Why would they change? Janalei is worth that massive hero power difference just to summon ragnaros, the card is insane.
---
And why do those specific cards need to be added back? Is there an actual reason? Otherwise we will get 135 new cards every 4 months so it's no different.
---
On Nomi priest, since it's been brought up a few times. 
---
Hsreplay has stats on Nomi. 162k games played, 43% wr. The most popular version has 16k games,  42.5%wr. best preforming version has 1600 games played, 49% wr. 
---
It's best against heal druid, which isn't super common and terrible against bomb warrior. 
---
Looking at matchups, the most relevant I see is a positive wr against zoo warlock, heal and token druid. I'ts really designed to be anti-token decks with the pyros controlling the board. IDK why it's good against heal druid but I don't see a lot of those. 
---
It loses to everything else.
---
If you are only going to play otk decks , he's good .
---
Only issue is playing him is kinda slow and you can't have some minions like zilliax or flobidinous floop.
---
I do have zilliax in my deck but after losing spell stone, dk and plague to the rotation it's difficult against aggro decks anyway:)
---
Thanks, my bad
---
&gt; I mean from the original post it makes it quite clear it was only available for a limited time and blizzard probably doesn’t want to promise anything in case they change their mind on something. I could be reading your comment wrong though.
---
they gave Khadgar out to asia for a while, and they said they wanted to offer Tyrande again because she was not available world wide(they even promised in year of the Mammoth). Khadgar was only apple, and hearthstone playable on many platforms. So it sort of leaves people in the air about these things because no question has been given a definitive answer, and the only one given was retracted.
---
Battlecry: turn an enemy minion into a 5/5 or a friendly minion into a 1/1, depending on which one is worse for you.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
If this is a “OTK” with your opponent nearly at half health, I declare every time you kill your opponent is an “OTK”
---
Neat combo though.
---
You're missing GvG aggro paladin :D
---
To clarify, Ben and Dean obviously gave their answers in English. As far as I know as of last week they don't speak any Mandarin :P 
---
There was a lot of translations back and forth throughout the 2h session, and various Chinese sites published their articles over the weekend.
---
I read the Chinese article/s but didn't want to misquote the devs (and it's pretty silly translating an interview English -&gt; Chinese -&gt; English), so I obtained the raw English audio and transcribed/cleaned it.
---
See, what I'm hearing here is: "Safe from Hemet Jungle Hunter."
---
How do you use Myra’s?
---
Now kith.
---
"That was Wild!"
---
It's just another deck to consider since you're heavily invested in the priest class, which isn't in the best state this expansion. If all you care about are the stats, just play rogue or warrior.

\# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
&gt; Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Red Dead Redemption 2 and Forza Horizon 4 combined bought me a heck of a lot more enjoyment than a few extra year of the raven cards beyond the free to play amount would have bought me.
---
The thing is not everyone gets the same amount of enjoyment from AAA games as you do.  Also, some people don't have the time to play all of those games.  Or maybe they just really like playing Hearthstone.  For those folks, spending $50-80 on something they like (Hearthstone) makes a lot more sense then spending $50-60 on something they wouldn't enjoy.
---
You could take that $60 and go bananas on indie titles during the Steam Summer Sale, but it's a complete waste unless you actually plan to play those games.  I have friends with hundreds of games on Steam that they bought because "they were a great deal" that they've also never opened.  Meanwhile, you could spend a hundred hours enjoying Hearthstone and then come back and say "why would I pay any money for that; it's ridiculously overpriced".
---
My point is that everybody values things differently based on their own personal circumstances.  $50 for you might mean something completely different than $50 for the next guy.
---
Basically I use it to fish for more damage if you are close. If you have a high tempo play or can set up lethal do that first.
---
Didn't know you can assign a specific hero portrait to a deck. How is it done?
---
It only works if you say, very calmly, this time for SURE. I promise that not only will you get the right minion to transform, it'll be the right outcome too

My question is, I saw a post about 10 minutes ago suggesting trading out crystalizer for swamp leech, any input?
---
I mean, when he complains about the game, and then reacts to people politely telling him how he could have played that situation better... 🤔
---
The silent Tri-Class nerf wouldn’t seem so random either.
---
AAA games were one example.  The nice thing about the world in 2019 is there's so many forms of entertainment.
---
And the bottom line is that $150-240 (per year) is not the cost of playing hearthstone but the cost of a few extra cards that will won't bring you anywhere near a complete play set, so you still won't be able to build the deck you really want.  Play for free or pay $240/year, you're in basically the same spot, so paying is foolish.
---
they did not add in discover effects and instead went with 'add random card into hand effect'. IDK if rush is going to be put in.
---
I’m only pretty new to the game but not a noob (since November) and have yet to craft zilliax. I see it in a lot of decks but would it be worth it now?

---
It doesn't turn people away either. They're just fun little cosmetics to show that you were around. It's only a small minority of players that even care about cardbacks. 90% of people never switched off of Hakkar. And obviously these exclusive rewards work or devs would stop adding them.

Tri-class cards are the reason I first got into Hearthstone. I was walking my dog through a park about a mile north of my house when I came across a neighborhood kid I'd never seen before. He was maybe six years old, flapping his arms like a bird in running in circles saying, "Crystals! Fresh from Kazakus!"
---
I thought he was pretending to be a magical bird or something, so I said "oh, are you a Phoenix like from Harry Potter?" The kid stopped moving and looked me dead in the eye and in the most serious tone you could imagine goes, "Tri-class cards are a new and exciting feature in the card game Hearthstone."
---
I talked to the kid for maybe an hour after that. He helped me understand that I needed to give tri class cards a try because of the unexpected possibilities they create. I talked to him about growing up, what it was like, what I struggle with the most.
---
I never saw him again after that day, but I kept the little purple crystal he gave me before I took off. I still think about that kid sometimes. I wonder what he thinks about the upcoming rotation and how he will feel not having tri class cards in standard. Honestly, I miss him so much and I just wish there was someway to know he was okay.
---
So, yeah, I think you make a great point OP. Your post hits on something deep that, you are right, people just aren't considering. Thanks for reminding us of that. This community needs men like you in the metas to come.
---
Didn't know if it did work on ios, I looked it up and there is no deck tracker for ios, looks like arcane tracker is android only

You could put deck limitations in though so it’s aggro or control only if you wanted.

Thank you HS for making MTG f2p.
---
Otherwise, ugh Hearthstone is boring af.  And unrewarding, gimme a break, win 3 games for 60 gold?  At max, win 15 games for 50 gold/day, or grind out 12 wins in arena for like 2-3 packs or break even win a pack for \~7 wins.  And let's not forget our one classic pack/(most) week(s) in the brawl.
---
But compare this to mtga, win 15 games/week for 3 relevant packs, and/or win 4 games/day for the equivalent of 100+ gold (including the daily quest) or LOSE games for packs.  OH, and if you want to win 15 games/day, it's basically 75 gold plus most of a pack (I average at least one rare/mythic per day in MTGA ICR's and that plus the rest as uncommons makes a pack if you don't care about commons and why would you).  And if you want to do arena, a 7 win run gets you 5 packs plus a little.   Now you can't go 12 wins, and infinite is arguably harder, but for most people this is a much more lucrative system.
---
And mostly, MtG is just a lot more FUN.  So many jank decks and archetypes, (even in mythic rank you'll see more than the top 3-4 decks, though they are definitely prevalent) and with the single exception of mana screw/flood which Hearthstone does better, it's just a highly superior game.  I've played Hearthstone near-daily for a number of years now, but it's just a chore to even do dailies, I never bothered to grind to mythic in HS, and meanwhile I'm mythic in MTGA in season 2, and lately have been getting my 15 wins/day.
---
Plus, "arena" aka drafting rotates, there's sealed, bo3 and bo1 drafts, plus standard constructed events and rotating special events of many flavors.  There isn't one new (sometimes) rotating brawl/week, but there are way more options all the time.  And as a f2p player, let me tell you it's WAY more friendly than HS - I've currently got 4 T1 decks as f2p, plus a $50+ cache of premium currency saved up from drafting rewards, and I'm not a terrible player but I make plenty of mistakes in drafting, deckbuilding, and playing (both draft and constructed) and probably more I don't even fully realize.
---
So...I'm wishing Hearthstone well, but I don't expect I'll be spending much time on it moving forward, I opened 50 packs for this expansion with what I'd call pretty good luck, and got a ton of dust from the nerfs, and I've got another 2500 gold sitting there for arena or whatever else, but the will is just not there.  I haven't even opened my alt with the golden whizbang to see what the new brews look like, there's just no interest.  There was talk a while back about how non-interactive certain Hearthstone decks are, some of the combo decks especially, but ultimately the entire game design isn't very interactive and I think that's my biggest gripe.  Play your turn, your opponent plays theirs, you decide attackers and blockers, and there's no back and forth like you find with mtg, it's dumbed-down for a reason (more kids with daddy's CC I always figured) but what they lose isn't made up for by the larger player base AT ALL as far as I'm concerned.

Yeah, me too. Epic cards are meant to be good cards with unique effects, [[Brawl]] as an example. It hurts to think about spending 800 dust on two cards which are equal if not worse to some common rarity cards.
---
Could really need a decoy snail

In general, maybe, but there's good aligned stuff and evil aligned stuff in basically every class (except maybe Warlock).  Priest has Shadowform for example.
---
In the Rise of Shadows plot, all of the classes that produce minions and have legendaries from the league of EVIL and scheme cards are evil aligned.  All the classes with legendaries from Dalaran and Twinspell cards are good aligned.
---
Priest is aligned with evil and with doing a heist, they have [[Madam Lazul]], [[EVIL Conscriptor]], [[Convincing Infiltrator]] etc.
---
Hunter is clearly aligned with Dalaran and good in this expansion.  They have [[Rapid Fire]], [[Unleash the Beast]], and [[Vereesa Windrunner]]

Depends on what you enjoy, but yes the ladder prizes are the same -- that is, whichever is highest between both ladders is chosen.

Eh, perhaps OP means that with the lower player population the homebrews are more noticeable? From what more grindy players have written, it's common to see non-netdecks up till 5.
---
How dare you exploited the game with intended interactions! For shame!
---
He must have stolen Shadow Form too.
---
That’s some good scaling. I only just started playing Duel Links so I’m getting used to seeing 3 star and 4 star stat stuff being around 500~2000 atk/def
---
I’m slowly trying to build a Deskbot deck, still missing 009 after ripping 20 packs... :\
---
It's just a title bro, he probably thought it was kinda funny that it happened and wanted to share it on reddit, and so he came up with a title for it. Chill.
---
I took some ideas from that deck but made a pure centered beast deck with no healing package and more removal plus copy abilities in replacement.
---
Lots of decent control, Dead man's hand, quest, patron,  etc warrior lists are pretty competitive. Maybe not tier 1, but still good.
---
That's why it aches, and the Druid's not laughing.
---
I think your Caps Lock is on. It the big button next to A on the left hand side.
---
That's how Forums work. Look up if stuff has been there already. Kek.
---
More info: I was at full health and dominated him. He wanted to add me. I said okay lets defuse it right away with "i was lucky" (i didn't).. he still flamed me. He played fave hunter, but i am the one with brain damage :D.
---
Is this reportable?
---
Why is it any worse than just playing an OTK? It's basically the same thing. You need to set up the combo then once you have it you win the game. The difference is OTK actively ends the game whereas infinite armour forces opponent to concede or just sit there for like a helpless lemon.

What does the rolled in here mean?
---
It's ranked tier 4 on hsreplay. Crap win rate but it's still a meta deck. That's just semantics though. Point is you hit legend with a low tier deck. Congrats. People have definitely had success with it though. Check the Meta reports and you'll see it's seen some play and success at top ranks. 
---
I faced the deck once around rank 4. Wonder if it was you!!? I was playing token druid and it crushed me. 
---
I loved taunt druid so I may give this a try. I don't have lucentbark but can afford him... But it's a risky craft 😣
---
Remember the priest mechatun last year?
---
Reckless into coffin into tickling abomination x 2.
---
Coffin crasher dies ( death rattle executes in order the minions entered the game), invokes mechatun, THEN both tickling abomination. Not that the death rattle resolved before the other death rattles trigger. If the same logic was in place here, this combo should work.

And you can report him by making a ticket with blitz support, need his Battletag tho. I'm pretty sure nothing will happen tho. Not saying the guy is "right" or not acting childish, but he wasn't even *THAT* bad.
---
Disaster*
---
I reckon this would be class specific ( rogue/warlock maybe) and like bomb warrior now, just a couple of cards.
---
You're both 6 years old. Lol.
---
He's a card in many tempo deck lists but the highest win rates don't include him. I don't think I'd craft him. I got him from packs and still don't run him in my tempo list.

That's some next level negativity/toxicity in your reddit history. Find some counceling or get someone to hug you. You need it.
---
Yes this happens a lot
---
Better play ranked or arena games only on computer
---
no, for me anxiety isn’t something I can get used to. Even though I have hit rank 15 I have anxiety about getting there, and I haven’t gotten to rank 10 or 5. But I do just have anxiety, in general - it just manifests as ladder anxiety in this situation.
---
All control decks aim to stop the opponent from playing, all Aggro decks aim to end the game before opponent can play, all mid range decks aim to make opponent feel as if playing anything is pointless. You’re just limiting your definition of “play”
---
Guess that isn't a 100% winrate
---
No one gives a single fuck
---
Picked bunnyhopper (or whatshisname). Cause he did it once, he can do it again.
---
Fair
---
He isnt worht the effort. Just ditch him and youll forget about him within two hours.
---
Where did you find the link to the .csv? Can you add the link to that post (not just the csv?). I’m learning and would love to find that and older csvs for Hearthstone to practice data analysis with. I had a search myself but could only find files for August last year.
---
Deleted so you can breath easy, friend
---
Because he plays rogue.
---
How did you know the time... There is no progress bar in the gif
---
Control decks in most card games actually have win cons. It's pretty much only HS that has "fatigue" or realistically now "infinite" control decks, because it's actually garbage design that only Blizzard could be stupid enough to come up with. Other games dont allow for infinitely adding cards to your deck, and once you hit the end of your deck you just die, you dont draw for sometimes like 6-7 more draws (with enough armor). 
---
I was hoping they'd redesign how Control works and get rid of infinite BS so that I could play control, and then they added a new one. The only way to have any fun playing this game is playing aggro so you can concede before the infinite BS starts up.
---
I understand what you are saying I don't hold onto him, I drop him at 4 and hope they blow stuff to clear him and then I get a double mass ressurect later. I was just saying that it is nice when he is out. I have a deck with the novas and a deck without the Novas, Im testing both out right now
---
Haha!! I’m the only one that posted it on r/whataretheodds
---
They see you put a weird card in your deck and immediately kill it in my experience.
---
I see that no one's complaining about Zul'jin. So I guess people are okay with hero cards when they have a strong Battlecry and a mediocre hero power, just not the other way around.
---
We definitely needed a third post about this match /s
---
Wow, that's so awesome!!11!
---
Thanks :)
---
I never said otk decks are fun. I refer to them as solitaire decks bc ur playing by urself. 
---
And dying to aggro sucks, i genuinely hate aggro but its neccessary to keep slow greedy decks in line. I find control vs aggro to be fun. Is my deck sturdy enough to survive the early shit storm? Can i stabalize in time for it to matter? Both sides feel full of important choices.
---
And yes concede exists but the fact that yhe shaman deck goes infinite is just stupid to me. Like i said, if thats your thing then go off. I can't judge because i know people think my favorite decks are awful too (big spell mage specifically and i rly enjoy dragon priest)
---
I think the deck is shitty but if its in the game and you wanna utilize it, go for it. I just find it to be a scummy strategy. Similar to how i think knocking people off a ledge in for honor is shitty lol. But its in the game for a reason so go off if u must.
---
When you play token druid the whole game play is basically " hope your opponent didnt draw in their board cleard" and "whoops, that's a warpath again, gg"
---
Been playing til old gods, dust wasn't really an issue this expansion, hof rotation alone gave me around 10k dust
---
Okay thanks that makes sense
---
In simpler terms: killing a minion does not remove it from the board. It gets removed once everything is done.
---
Try this Paladin deck out! It is super fun to play with and you can have some super strong turns!

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Dr. Boom, Mad Genius is not the card pushing Warrior generally over the top. That instead falls on the combination of Omega Devastator, Omega Assembly, and Dyn-o-matic. Change those in some meaningful capacity, and Dr. Boom ceases being an issue.
---
Delivery Drone is the most inefficeient method of "infinite" value in the game currently as it only draws you one-fifth of a card per turn on average, and the Rush aspect of the hero card generally actually allows it to meaningfully contribute to the game during the three out of every five turns The Big Red Button more or less whiffs, and it's only a problem when mechs double as removal spells (as Omega Devastator and Dyn-o-matic do).
---
When Aviana was nerfed, AK47 was at best bottom of t1, more like t2. When Wild Growth and Nourish were nerfed, druid didn't even have a playable deck. Each of the 3 times QR has been nerfed (giggles was nerfed specifically for it), it was at best a t2 deck.
---
No one gives a shit about its tier. It's unquestionably the least fun deck to ever play against in this game. Combo decks at least let you do your thing. Big Priest's entire game is just making your life miserable.
---
Just had a hell of a comeback against a bomb warrior with this: https://hsreplay.net/replay/W5F7nKxGgH2XvD2GDahLdT
---
&gt;My opponent emoted well played and I came
---
&gt;I like the idea of putting both in my deck
---
Oh I bet you like it. You like it *a lot*.
---
If you wanna be the truest, most ultimate life form you should rank up in arena
---
There, the truth
---
No way :o I've been wondering if it would work and you just confirmed it! Cheers mate ❤️
---
I just beat him with token druid, but boy, it was a long game...
---
I have 9+ listed right now for Batterhead, I think I got to around 12 or 13, and that's with only 165 packs. I still have a few ***rares*** I don't have playsets of, in addition to missing about 20 epics, but lord do I have Batterheads.
---
I'm hoping the next expansion somehow makes them grossly overpowered so they get nerfed for free dust.
---
Depends on the type of mech hunter your're playing: if you're oblivitron/mechanical whelp, your deck is too greedy to consistently beat token; if you're flark/bomb, you need to have a strong opening draw (the matchup is still bad), and remember to go face as much as you can. You can usually leave 1 or 2 minions on the board if that means an extra 5 face damage.
---
I thought at one point, there was someone on this subreddit that compiled his best statistical analysis on whom he thought was going to win and who the best pick would be in total number of packs won. But I cannot remember who that was the save my life
---
I’m not saying hearthstone has a good fatigue mechanic, nor am I saying control is the best way to play. All I’m saying is hotagewock works just like any other combo deck.
---
Whether hearthstone has good design is an entirely different discussion
---
OP might be on Hagatha though
---
That’s what I was thinking 😂
---
It is bomb hunter, i will smork him more. Thank u for your time man!
---
Too crazy, my friend. I will think of you when casting Shadowform.
---
Just like pinochio
---
Roger the cheater
---
Is you’re name Pavel by any chance?
---
Thanks for this
---
I just thought about how fun it'd be, just the other day. It wouldn't.
---
I doubt they will be very strong cards. They most likely really don't want to create new evergreen cards that see play outside of niche situations. The safest way to do that is to overcompensate a bit in making them weak.
---
I'm glad I haven't bought any pack since  6+ months and as Blizzard said, "I have no plan to" buy anymore in my life LuL
---
Hunterace. The photo used is amazing haha.
---
Right. See when I quit a game I don’t start bitching in the comments of the sub but you do you bro. The sub can’t appear on your front page if you’re not subbed to it. Unless you mean r/All.
---
you only had to play around 2 cards here, counterspell and spellbender. no need to play around every possible cards here as mage has limited secrets and only 2 activate with the spell u wanted to play. sure, he could have leeroy and hero powered next turn for lethal so maybe a taunt could save you, maybe he plays the 8 mana spell and summons 2 argent commanders next turn, but noones telling you to play around these 2 possiblites. they are only pointing out that you should have played another spell first to check for counter spell or spellbenders.
---
Didnt realize that was Celestia, had to look at the comments.
---
Disaster indeed.
---
I still hate priest so much because the cancer wall/otk decks that didn’t matter what you had done all turns before, you would just die. I don’t like nomi miracle, but it is the option now. And I reckon silence priest can be good with a bit more support.
---
How exactly is it trash design? I can agree that its over tuned and really should have been priced at say five mana, a lower damage amount, or a 3/4 body instead of the 4/5. However, it really doesn't fall under the normal tenants of what could be considered "trash" or bad design.
---
The card doesn't inspire degenerate strategies like the Caverns Below or Kingsbane with Leeching Posion did nor is it a not a fascinatingly bad card like Harbinger Celestia whose awfulness was obvious from the get go.
---
Ladder diversity? Sure. Warrior and Rogue proven to be the big sharks in a weak card pool to no surprise, as it was fairly obvious estimate before the rotation even happened. But like you say, there are decks for everyone. Because it's a random best of 1 in what is basically an elaborate game of rock-paper-scissors. As long as you get lucky to avoid too much of the bad match-up, it's a pretty fun experience. 
---
But then you go on to talk about specialist format. What diversity? 70% of Top8 finishes are Rogue/Warrior, with Hunter being a distant 3rd, and 4 classes basically non-existent - https://www.yaytears.com/battlefy/stats
---
you are right, I think that what's bother me the most is the rush for mechs thing. It backs what you said about Omega Devastator, Omega Assembly, and Dyn-o-matic. 
---
But you are right infinite value is not the problem regarding Dr.Boom.
---
why would you instantly insult other redditor? Moreover the title of your post says  **First time 12-0 with Kingsbane in the Brawliseum! OP Deck!** but the pic that you used shows just the 12:0 and the deck is blurred out. seems like you wanted to kill two birds with one stone and now... now youre just r/gatekeeping
---
I picked Bloodyface after reading that article.
---
What the hell do so many people say loose?
---
You didn’t defeat secret paladin if you conceded tho
---
Congrats! That's awesome.
---
im more surprised that it survived...
---
haha
---
&gt; AAA games were one example. The nice thing about the world in 2019 is there's so many forms of entertainment.
---
That's true.  There are many forms of entertainment.  Here's a few of the top of my head and a rough cost for each:
---
* Pandora Radio Subscription - $4.99/month
---
* Netflix (Standard, HD) - $12.99/month
---
* 3x AAA games - $15.00/month ($180/year)
---
* 3x Hearthstone Pre-orders - $20.00/month ($240/year)
---
* Local Gym Membership - $35.00/month
---
* Starbucks Frappuccino 5 days/week - $92.08/month
---
* International Travel once/year - $250/month ($3000/year)
---
* A Boat - $500/month
---
Which of these, as a consumer, should I choose to buy?  There's not going to be a one-size fits all answer.  The price of Hearthstone sucks compared to Netflix, but it sure is cheaper than that boat.  But some people like Netflix, some people like Hearthstone, and some people like boating.  Therefore, each person has to take the cost of each hobby and compare it to the enjoyment they personally get out of it and make their own purchasing decisions.
---
The new Rabbids game looks pretty good
---
Whoosh
---
It’s a win to me he didn’t concede and played it out even tho any normal person would. Unless he was waiting for I think it’s an eye for an eye? But he played minions and when my board was full and my pogo was just below 100 he boosted it up and I got there
---
It's not a popular deck I didn't even know someone played it this expansion.
---
Imagine being so desperate that you have to go 5 months back to some random post in order to come with an argument. First off, I thought he was referring to the Mechathun deck. Second off, people going 12-0 in Brawliseum are far fewer than those who hit Legend.
---
it clicks
---
Bunnyhoppor 100% win rate ez
---
No they won't. Opponent just have to go face
---
Deck list?
---
everything was fine, but i really hated cubelock
---
I have no idea what the thought process was with this card lol
---
Nah, spirit of the dragonhawk, blizzard, DK Jaina hero power killing 3 minions and summoning 3 water elementals :)
---
Coin+Barnes
---
How do people send the whole decklist?
---
Oh shit you right. Run it in a sort of control lock, wait until you have it able to summon about 20 then summon them. You could also have the warlock shrine and hireek, have shrine and 20 imps on board, kill all imps with hireek in your hand, play hireek, then boom infinite 21/21’s
---
Tap second, always!
---
They literally just said in yesterdays that they aren’t gonna unnerf yogg, because it’s a neutral card. They said if they’re ever gonna make a similar effect on a card like an unnerfed yogg, it will be a class card.
---
where are the links for the decks?
---
Because for 4 Mana you can kill almost each minion. Arditional it's a mech (so good synergy), has as 4 Mana 4/5 vanilla stats and is a class card in a class full of removals.
---
You don't mind that you gotta wait until Turn 10 to use it because as Warrior you can already clear and stall before better than any other class.
---
Leeroy and Shadowstep are the current biggest bullshit combination in the entire game.   I know this because I just lost to a rogue who had no business winning thanks to that combo.
---
Because part of the design is to make the card fit the environment?
---
good, it has been 2 years since her last run....and when they said shed come back......
---
I don't get this. It's so much easier to just printscreen for the whole screen, or just use snipping tool if you have multiple screens. It's faster, the image quality is so much better, the viewing angle is always 100% correct. Why use an alternative that is worse in pretty much every way?
---
And ofc, gz to OP, great job! You're obviously smarter than me in some ways 12-0. I'm closer to 0-12 than that perfect run.
---
itsbeen84years.gif
---
I dont get it.
---
&gt; The fact that anti fatigue is more important than value (immediate or otherwise) is a sign of a few things:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; That stall is too strong
---
&gt; That value is too easy to come by (dr boom hero power)
---
&gt; or
---
&gt; That immense value is too easy to deal with
---
It's actually not a sign of any of these things.
---
Control warrior vs control warrior has basically always gone to fatigue, pretty much since the start of the game.  When both players play more removal than threats, and neither player is a combo deck, the game will go to fatigue.  Control warrior vs Control Priest also used to go to fatigue.  This is a function of mirror matches, and not particularly a function of balance issues.
---
Right now, as far as I know Elysiana is relevant in basically three or four matches:
---
Control Warrior vs Control Warrior
---
Control Warrior vs Control Shaman
---
Control Shaman vs Control Shaman (presumably; I know very little about this matchup)
---
Sometimes as a counter to Bomb Warrior to delete the bombs in your deck.
---
(And presumably control warrior vs control priest if control priest is out there).
---
Basically, it's a card that ruins control mirrors, and is irrelevant in nearly every other matchup.  (I haven't been playing control decks this expansion--haven't crafted any yet, missing too many cards, and I can tell you straight up that I have literally never seen an Elysiana played.  Most included legendary in the set, I don't even know what her voice lines or entry animation look like).
---
The point is, the answer to "this one card makes control mirrors extremely unfun, but is irrelevant in all other matchups" is not "NERF CONTROL DECKS INTO THE GROUND UNTIL NONE OF THEM EVER FACES A MIRROR MATCH."
---
They said that you can later download them for free on the battle.net shop online. But they haven’t added the ability to do that yet. Hopefully soon.
---
Ooo too bad for me I guess, can you provide the source material for it please?
---
I remember it a bit differently. Rogue used the unearthed raptor package so there was more of a focus on deathrattles.
---
Also shaman used jade to swarm the board for a bloodlust finish.
---
Yep. And I had 49 health + armor before the first Deathwing smash to my face.
---
Awww ;(
---
My best bet would be Nourish for the card draw but it's still a sorry replacement at twice the Mana.  Crystal song is pretty unique at the moment.

How would they draw? If he was just a non boom warrior he would play it as a 10/10, the enemy would get a copy of the 10/10 and just go face to win. Hell he could just pass and win via fatigue. They would only draw if they both had an empty hand/deck/board and traded the mechs into each other.

So?

Your analysis on the data is really sad, there is a clear trend in the most hated decks (most of them are either combo or uninteractive decks with some control in it), I thank you for doing this, I found the data really intresting.
---
This is true, and the other way to do this is by hitting \[\[Toki, Time-Tinker\]\] and hitting \[\[Sir Finley Mrrgglton\]\] off of Toki. I have done this once against a Mage, but you could just hit Toki randomly off of \[\[Blink Fox\]\]. And then you can discover a different Hero Power, which could be a mage hero power. :)
---
Great list, to build off it: Ironbeak Owl, Loot Hoarder, Dire Woolf Alpha, Harvest Golem, Acolyote of Pain, and Knife Juggler.
---

Only does 4 dmg
---
While we are discussing this, what is your opinion on the Vargoth / Shadow Madness interaction?  I believe this is a bug, since even though this spell is enacted in the End of Turn phase, it should also resolve within there.
---
They can actually do more in 1 turn even without coin. Leeroy &gt; Waggle &gt; Leeroy &gt; Eviscerate or Cold Blood &gt; Preparation &gt; Eviscerate or Cold Blood. 
---
10 mana for 24 damage.
---
Unfortunately no because they don't make new forum posts and just update their rules post on the forums.  [This is the current rules page](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/current-arena-rules/93) with the most recent bucket adjustments, but it doesn't include the possible HoF cards.  This is actually how I found out cards that I missed, by comparing the two lists to see what actually changed.
---
&gt;no u
---
It's pretty low the rank, there are at least 4 different builds for Warlock that are better than Leeroy+PO+Faceless combo, that it's so underplayed that it doesn't even shows up in the hsreplay data.
---
And Frost Mage is not really a thing, those are Burn with secrets and the Exodia variant with Antonidas, where the immunity is just Ice Block 2 times.
---
but 0 x 2 = 0
---
The spell damage should be a sum in the code and not a factor. So by default it should be 0
---
Watch out, he might be that Madman who techs in  Hagatha’s scheme.
---
I mean is it really much more different to playing normal shudderwock lists that just kill you? When they get everything off you lost, the only difference is that the one list will kill you and against the other one you will have to concede. If you have too much pride to press the concede button, i think thats more of an issue than an annoying deck
---

Besides, isn't this why we have a fluff tag?

Why is maly 0 mana

Maintenance, until 10:00 pdt
---
They did say they work 3 expansions ahead but not in the sense that the next two are basically done and they're "really" working on the 3rd one. Supposedly they are all at different stages of development, with the furthest one away being the most ambiguous and least focused on.
---
According to what we've heard, the next expansion would be mostly finalized, doing last minute testing, getting all the art, audio, and names right, prepping for the reveal season and launch, etc. On that point you're right. But the following expansion (the last one for this year) will have just exited the initial design phase where the theme and mechanics are finalized, and most of the card design, testing, and changing is still being done and will be for the next few months.
---
The only thing they'd be doing for next year's first expansion (the 3rd expansion from now) is just kind of generally discussing the theme and types of mechanics they might want to use, the overall direction they may want the game to go and how they can design cards to achieve that goal - but most of the efforts of individual card design, balance, and testing would still be going into the next two expansions, particularly the 2nd one from now.
---
Best bot
---
I would disenchant and craft regular Thekal just to flex. 
---
But seriously... he's one that I can't bring myself to dust. He enables some wonky stuff and I'm sure he will be the host of more shenanigans in the future.
---
Thank you! I dont mind the down votes (prob just salty infinite shudderwock players lol) :) i gotta speak my honest opinion i csnt change it :)
---
Literally always keep legendaries until they rotate. Prevents you from opening a second copy and also lets you have so much more options later in the year.
---
Better oress that hero power to not lose out on value.
---
Actually if the new (neutral) legendaries are good, it could potentially allow for less dust to be spent overall because you could reasonably jam them in more decks than a good class legendary
---
Go to my collection and where you rename it you copy deck code
---
Yeah. It's a capable deck as a counter to Warrior and Mage. Just don't expect to do too well against Token Druid, Tempo Rogue, and Murloc Shaman.
---
Does Harvest Golem really get played any more? I use it in a tempo mech warrior deck but it’s still one of the weakest cards. I agree with the other choices though, although Ironbeak Owl probably isn’t as necessary as the others.
---
Yes. So "safe from Hemet is correct"

Xiaot cuz i rolled a a 20 when we were playing hearthstone during a dnd session and my friend was watching him
---
I personally don't like the restriction on some of my favourite Heroes at the moment. 
---
If I want to play druid - I am highly restricted to one archetype, simply because of the winrate. I hit 65% win rate with Token, and 45% with Malygos/Heal druid, it is not equivocal. 
---
Mage as well, is incredibly restricted, in my opinion. I don't understand why one of the best Mage decks has almost no Mage cards (Dragon Mage). 
---
Warlock also only has one archtype. I can not breach 50% with hand/control-lock, and I did before the rotation. My playing experience is largely consistent with Hsreplay too.
---
I guess, however, that this is just my opinion. Some decks have cool variations, but largely, most Warriors/Rogues have the same shell. Shaman is either full on murlocs, or a very expensive deck. 
---
Hunter is probably in the most varied state it's ever been in. I've had success with Mech/Combo/Midrange/Spell hunters across the board. 
---
Paladin seems in decent shape, two viable decks at least. Priest has a couple too, but I don't play these classes that much since I got 500 wins with them a few years ago, but from what I've seen, Priest is fairly one-dimensional too.
---
Kripparian has one out, his choices look pretty safe if you’re looking to play that particular class that has a card recommended.
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1097
---
Backstab dagger double poison...your move.
---
I think of crafting that deck too. It looks fun to play and fast.
---
I recommend accepting any friend requests. If they are nice, it's a chance for 80g down the line. If they're not, it's usually hilarious.
---
I usually send them to people I lose to to compliment their deck or congratulate their good RNG. If I win, I usually don't get received well.
---
For me whenever i play control warrior i go against control warriors or bomb warriors or tempo rogue
---
Taunt wasn’t the problem.
---
Please enlighten me then, what was the problem?
---
I mentioned cthun and Reno. Those are special cases of build-around cards without redundancy. Patches is another great example. He tried to use Grom, boom, leeroy, and white eyes as generic examples of "they'd be too strong if you could run two." He was wrong.
---
Yeah, less of a brag, more of a fun way to play an all legendary golden deck for cheap
---
You'll never convince me that switching decks doesn't change the matchmaking algorithm. I can legitimately not see a deck for double digit games, but as soon as I switch decks, next game, here is my direct counter. Yayyyyyy
---
Can you imagine how busted standard would have been with TWO sergeant sallys in decks!?
---
I know I got hunter first, because I got 350ish wins with YOGG hunter, that was insanely fun!!!  Spell hunter before actual spell hunter!
---
After that, mage, then I can’t remember lol.
---
Quick shot, brave archer, 4 mana 7/7... can't think of anything else
---
Actually, I just came up with a Vargoth OTK myself that I was able to pull off.  
---
It also sports vivid nightmare, and I think 2/6 2/1 2/1 2/1 has a good enough boardpresence to have your foe use some important counters. The actual trick I used however was utilizing the new Ressurection Spell (9 Mana) after pulling off the vivid nightmare combo. The idea is to then have 7 2/6 Vargoths (all ressurrected Vargoths recast the ressurection spell) and use Mindblast for a whoopin 40 damage. But once again, it's not exactly otk because you lack 1 mana, and even using coin would make vargoth cast coin instead of Mindblast at a 50% chance.  
---
I pulled off the combo a little bit wonky however against Rogue, using Shadow Madness I got one of his taunts into my ressurrection pool, which led to me using a turn 9 ressurrection for 4 Vargaths and 3 3/3Taunts, while I also had a second vargath (in this case because she sapped the 2/6 one after vivid nightmare, but also doable with Seance). By the end of it I summoned Vargath on turn 10 to add to my 4 remaining on the field which rogue was unable to remove (No Vanish on hand apperantly) and closed out with mind blast. Wasn't necessary however because rogue was at 25 lifepoints, but I wanted the over 30 damage combo.  
---
In any case, the reason I came up with this meme was that I used Vargath previously to be able to add him to my ressurection Pool along with 2 Strong Taunts or the like and then cast Ressurrection, which leads to the ressurected vargath recasting that spell at the end of the turn.
---
&gt;The new mode, though, has a lot of repeat play possible with all of the different decks and Hero Powers and also the different type of tracking inherently available too. There are many different ways you can track for winning this chapter, with this hero, with this Hero Power, with this deck - there are a lot of checkboxes for players to explore.
---
&gt;Thompson: There are players across the globe who are very interested in collecting all the checkmarks, experimenting with different decks; there’s a lot of repeat play that’s possible for players of all types.
---
Looking forward to this. So uhh... can you guys actually get started on actually releasing this content? If we're going to trickle in one "wing" each week, we won't see the last classes until JUNE at this rate.
---
For real?
---
Just freedom to mess around!
---
yeah my side mouse button clicks 47 times per second
---
You seem to have lost because he got a taunt, the kelthuzad is just a nice extra
---
Thats odelat specific lmao
---
Could you imagine how broken a deck would be if it could run two Keleseth's?
---
wait....
---
Which paladin deck archtype? LOL
---
I have almost all the classic cards, but have only opened around 10 of each card expansion. Should I only buy rise of shadows from now on, or buy all the other expansion packs all the same? I'm f2p. I know that the three other expansions will rotate out by next April, are they worth buying with gold or do I just craft the absolute necessities and invest all my gold on rise of shadows?
---
Nny#1597 Trading 80g quest. You show and then I'll go first.

Just going "kill myself warlock", want this done quickly
---
But the Mecha'thun and the RE were killed by the same thing, the ticking aboms (is that what it was?).  Here we have the RE being killed by the Voodoo Doll, and Mecha'thun killed by the RE end of turn mechanic. Could that make it different?
---
RNGsus giveth and RNGsus taketh.
---
Big warrior removes everything until it plays big stuff to win.
---
Elysiana warrior removes everything until it plays Elysiana to find a win condition.
---
They have different win conditions. But their "control" game plan is very similar. 
---
Saying big warrior is not control warrior is a load of crap. It's literally a control warrior shell with big minion win condition. I stand by my point. If you want to play control warrior and hate Elysiana in the mirror, play big warrior.
---
Im pretty sur its one month so, may 9th
---
Nice one
---
It's a better bgh
---
man when he realizes spellbreaker is a card hes gonna feel pretty silly

Because it's a terrible deck lol

- Harbinger turns into a 10/10
---
- still a mistake to play Harbinger
---
Two leeroys would absolutely be broken
---
Decklist plz
---
No, the taunt is not losing when he has 1 hp! Lol 
---
And I still have what I do!
---
I explained it [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bgh1fo/so_toast_found_a_glitch_and_i_want_to_know_your/elku2yc/), but to summarize:
---
It's the fact that minion death doesn't resolve until after a phase is complete, and minions are added to a "death queue" when they die. All effects in a phase are resolved, and the death queue resolves afterwards.
---
So in this case, Reckless kills Doll and C'thun, they're added to the death queue. Doll's deathrattle adds Reckless to the death queue. C'thun's deathrattle doesn't trigger because Reckless is in the queue after him. Then the death queue resolves, Doll&gt;C'Thun&gt;Reckless, removing the minions from the board in that order.
---
I've tweaked it a little bit, got 2 oozes and bwonsamdi. Havent progressed a lot but I've been too busy to play much, gonna try and push higher this weekend. Let me know when you give it a shot! Very interested to see how it does at legend
---
Change the KT to another random 8 drop and you're still losing pretty hard. He might have 1 HP, but you have no way to actually deal 1 damage with his taunt that you can't kill if he trades away the jade and goes face with the rest.
---
The cost tho; 3200 dust | At home: \~400\~ 0 dust
---
I didn't net-deck though, it's just really hard to build this list in a way that's different from the net-version, I heard "jepetto hunter exists" and thought "oh, cool idea," and threw this together, never actually looked at a list. Never said I was better, but going to casual to try out some meme trash and playing against nothing but legend viable competitive decks gets annoying. Like, that's why I went to casual instead of tanking my rank.
---
Nice man. Grats welcome to the club. It really is nice being able to play whatever class you want. Especially for me since my least favorite class to play was rogue and I started the golden grind with about 70 wins. Played odd rogue the whole way.  Wish they implemented the arena wins sooner I probably could’ve finished 8 months earlier. I didn’t really push until I only had 2 left
---
Healadin isn't a good deck in standard (yet) nor in wild. You can fit him in wild Control Paladin lists. Especially ones that run DK Uther. He has extreme synergy with Molten Giants in wild and in fact that is a common package in most mid-range Paladin decks in wild. Thekal + x2 Molten Giants on turn 3 is Naga Giants powerful, but is very unlikely to happen most games. Paladin isn't in a good spot in standard right now, bit that may change over the course of the year.
---
Yeah, I think even Blizzard knew that the mechanic just wasn't enjoyable enough to push hard. That's probably also why the few cards that they did make with that mechanic were pretty bad. Even Core Rager, which probably would've arguably been the best card if that mechanic had actually panned out, wasn't good enough to justify intentionally dumping your hand.
---
It's not a consistent deck, but I agree that combo is kinda bullshit. With a good draw you can have 1 mana alex, 1 mana maly plus 20+ burst from hand damage the turn after Jepetto. With a bad draw you can end up pretty screwed.
---
I cant stop laughing this is so silly lmfao.  
---
&gt; it's a lot more fulfilling to actually defeat the person rather than them simply just leave.
---
please mercy man.
---
well an otk is an otk. doesnt matter wht cards they use
---
Give me an example of a deck that makes u win if u are the better player and lose if I play badly.
---
I bet you cant.
---
Because your entire point is so ridiculous in a card game. Don't want any RNG, and a game where the played who played better always win? Play chess.
---
? the fuck are you talking about lol
---
haha ok man. ill just run hecklebot in all my decks :d ure retarded
---
You're not wrong, they're going to keep a significant portion of the proceeds and sprinkle the rest on top of the HS earnings.
---
No it wouldn't for exactly the same reason.
---
freeze mage was consistantly below 50% win rate you mean? youre right
---
I assumed for a long time that it would keep stealth and keep transforming every time your opponent played a new monster and always wondered why people hated it so much
---
so play aggro or warrior. great advice man

---
It's deleted
---
An otk is not  bad per se. Just because a deck can otk doesnt mean it should get nerfed inmediately.
---
Jeppeto otks are way more tamer and easier to interact with that all the otks from the year of the raven.
---
you can get to dad legend
---
Glad you did that thanks mate
---
That jow mafia works.
---
OP is lazy but so are you so here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hstgV1xFHo8
---
Depends do you like druid? Do you really like palaying a different class?
---
For me I play mostly warlock, and have zero intentions of playing priest or shaman (I'm not a fan of their class identity for whatever reason)
---
I don't immediately disenchant preist and shaman cards ever but they are always first on the chopping block when I'm trying to craft a warlock deck.
---
If you don't intend to spend any money in the game and want to be remotely competitive youre gonna have to just get really good at one or two classes.
---
When people feel bad for others, this strange emotion is referred to as "empathy." Some people actually enjoy showing feelings and want to share them, finding meaning in their lives this way.
---
If you have been playing for long enough to know you don't like the class, and are missing cards you really want from your favorite classes, IMO go for it. Rogue and druid are my personal write off classes and I haven't regretted it at all. Been playing since BRM and have never once made a druid or rogue deck. At that point you have to ask, do I want to have more fun now or reserve the small chance that I have fun later (with a class you have not had fun with to this point).
---
Plus, Hearthstone isn't going to be around forever. Those unused legendary cards are going to be completely useless 5 years from now when the game has died and Blizzard has moved on. Have your fun now while you know you can.
---
Mage was bad to fair for all of last year. FLJ was strong, but by no means broken compared to what else was out there.
---
I don't like aggressive face decks that can win on turn 5 or 6 either, and yet they are allowed to exist. Just because you don't like combo and OTK doesn't mean they should be erased from the game. Just imagine how warped the game would become if I we applied that same thinking to control,  midrange, or agro decks.
---
\*slowpoke meme\*
---
Having the same issue right now.
---
God this sub has gone so downhill.
---
I won’t comment further on the absurdity of your argument
---
Sounds like its ylu on the otherside of that conversation?
---
Good one.
---
I've been playing free since open beta.   I'm swimming in dust.    I've got 11,000 dust (I haven't yet crafted for RoS).  I also will get 7,000 more dust if I click the button to DE duplicates.  I also do play wild but I haven't disenchanted any of my old cards from wild sets.   There are plenty of cards that I know for sure I will play in wild I could DE if I wanted to take the time to go through them.
---
So for all the money you've wasted on preorders, you end up with a few more cards each xpac, and enough dust for a couple more legendaries each xpac.   You're basically in the same spot as any FtP person who completes most of the quests (and if you don't play enough to even complete most of the quests, why in the world would you spend so much on the game?).
---
Note, that I'm not saying the game is bad or not worth playing.   I'm saying it is idiocy to spend any money on the game in the current model they have.  You just get almost nothing extra for your $50-$80-$130 "investment".
---
Cause u know I'm right and Ur wrong
---
You actually have a point here, nerfing it to 9 mana would effectively make it much more fair. And to be honest: control shaman and contol warrior's gameplan is, by all means, bringing the game into fatigue. It's not even a strategy born by this expansion, it has only been made blatantly more disgusting by the introduction of Elysiana.😂
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
The correct term here is sarcastic, not ironic :)
---
No that would ruin the card.
---
I agree with part of your sentiment. This game does have some bad RNG/random cards. Back when random mage was a thing, you would be right, there is no possible way to play around something like a 3rd or 4th Flamestrike.  
---
However when it comes to secrets, you know the card exists, you know it belongs to a small set of cards. And each of those cards have activation triggers that you can think about, play around, and use the process of elimination to figure out exactly what you're up against. And that skill is not something only a legend player can learn, anyone can.
---
&gt; the likelihood of it being exactly spellbender was extremely low
---
There are 6 secrets in standard for mage, something that can easily be figured out on your own. So off the bat, it's 16.6% chance it's spellbender, and a 33% chance it's something that will counter your scheme.   
---
The options are:  
---
Counterspell (bad in this situation)  
---
SpellBender (bad)  
---
ice Barrier  
---
Mirror Entity  
---
Splitting Image  
---
Vaporize
---
Wanna learn how to play around mage secrets? OP has an empty board at the start of the turn, so assuming this.  
---
Play a minion ~~Mirror Entity~~  
---
Attack Face with weapon ~~ice Barrier ~~
---
There is now a 2 in 4 chance of your spell being countered in some way. I'm sorry, but there is a very good chance your combo is going to be countered here. If you started the turn with a minion on the board, then change it up, use the minion to attack face (if you don't mind losing it) and use your face to attack their worst minion. Do this, see it's neither vaporize or splitting image, and suddenly you know it's either counterspell or Spellbender. Otherwise, play a different spell, one you don't mind losing, like shadowstep or sinister strike. Best case it's counterspell and you didn't lose anything of value, worst case is it's spellbender, and you can't trigger it with a different spell. In which case you either suck it up and scheme the 1/3s or hold onto it and play something else.
---
That's not our case.
---
You're really underestimating just how much money he is worth, he made an average of $107,000,000 a day last year. It would be more accurate to say he could throw away like $110 million a day for the rest of his life and still die richer than 99.99999% of the worlds population. He'd be out of money by about like the year 2140 based on a loss of $3,000,000 a day.
---
Control warrior is cancer, u shouldn't complain about any deck you fight.
---
The Boomsday puzzle rooms were pretty enjoyable. Least frustrated I've been with solos in a while.
---
Yea, because people think screenshots of angry players and trolls is enjoyable content. It’s not even fluff. It’s such low effort content.
---
I love this meta - there's a ton of variety in deck styles. None seem impossible to play against.
---
Black Superman!
---
It was a few months before they got stale in my opinion, there was definitely experimentation with the underutilized classes. I genuinely think if they released them in the third set instead of the first they would have gone out without a hitch. It was a blast to see unused cards like Raid Leader and Frostwolf Warlord finally see play because of the fun deckbuilding experience, it was just tiresome once you’ve played against the same deck for the past three releases lol
---
Yeah, assuming that’s control warrior, giving you two brawls is not really going to hurt him.
---
Sure.
---
You should definitely NOT play him in big Priest. Probably the only deck in the game where you don’t want him.
---
Yes limited archetypes sucks. There will be more diversity with the next xpan
---
Fluff tag is for like silly artwork or something that takes some semblance of effort. Not screenshots of angry players and trolls. It’s not even fluff. It’s about as low effort as you can get.
---
Oh you are excused for your mistake. I use the stats that do not count rank 25 stats. I thought you'd actually consider only looking at the players that matter in the high ranks. But yeah, you're still wrong even by your own measure and by any measure that matters.
---
But sure, if you want to say " if i drag down the score to account for rank 25 I am only 50% wrong! ... Ha!.."
---
I keep rereading it and laughing. I keep imagining a ten year old shouting "nuh uh" over and over.
---
In France as well
---
Four hours during an inconvenient time of the day for half of the world (late night/early morning) for... 1 pack. Wow, such value
---
Please do
---
Could be worse, doomsayer is a thing
---
Playing something you are comfortable with is perfectly fine. Im just trying to set expectations that you could hit a wall sooner or later. What is your current rank?
---
Also because of the inherent weaknesses of the deck, I wouldn't invest too much on upgrading it. Resources are better spent on a class which has a higher overall winrate.
---
Underbelly angler not too scary if u have the resources imo.
---
I mean Bomb Warrior isn't even as good as Control Warrior. If you're wasting 6-10 slots of your deck dedicated to the Bomb package then that is about a quarter/third of their deck not dedicated to removal/key control cards. If Bomb Warrior is waiting to play their bomb cards until the very end, then they will have a difficult time finding cards to play since a significant portion of their deck are the bombs. Which means aggro will have an easier time beating Warrior. In that scenario the control player should be the aggressor (similar to vs DK Rexxar in past meta). Especially if the control player does not run a lot of healing, so they lose in taking the game to fatigue against Bomb Warrior.
---
You mean it would make it only good in some decks instead of every deck. No card should be universally used in every deck archetype.
---
It concludes with a concede
---
I definately should be random boths times, no reason it wouldnt be
---
14...

Anduin + The Light Shall Burn You + Heropower opponent's face + Not Quite What Was Planned + Pass
---
Apple?! in the earth? this is a golden turnip.
---
Seems like a lot of call center lingo.
---
Welcome to a year ago :)
---
It was and I think the outcome of this game is pretty easily predictable

Seriously using words like toxic and kill when talking about scheduled white collar work is silly.  You overreacted imo, i.e. the Beavis tag.  If thats all it takes to scare you from a conversation then it seems well deserved.  I wasnt trying to shame you but thats what you focused on, NOT your fallacious descriptions.  No wonder you are triggered by the thought of having to push a button at 3a.m...
---
Same bs here too ;(
---
Make a new one?
---
Your post is well-written and well thought out.   Including the fact that you very explicitly say "Hearthstone Pre-orders", and not hearthstone.   I'm not saying the game isn't worth it.  I'm saying the incremental benefit from buying the pre-order vs free to play is negligible for the money and anything else on your list gives far more enjoyment per dollar than the hearthstone pre-order.  Unless you are a seriously hard core fanatic with nothing else going on in your life.
---
Sure, if the money goes to the players. Not 25%, and the rest for Blizzard and twitch or whatever bullshit like with overwatch and hots.
---
Wait, we still haven't found the secret with the cauldron? Pls tell me that someone has found it.
---
Its more to pad their viewers stats for investors/stockholders and inflate their viewership.
---
Thanks, I had that error and your solution helped me fix it! :)
---
You didn't a big board. You needed 3-4 damage to kill off 3-4 6/6s. Your brawls/warpath does the rest.
---
Also control warrior does commonly get big things on board to kill people who spend 3 turns playing into your removal and nothing else...
---
I mean it's a token druid player, what do you expect? Bet the Warrior was just cocky and it totally had nothing to do with the fact that he just didn't have another Brawl / Warpath in hand or anything. Because we all know every deck has 20 boardclears all the time...
---
Leeroy is core to Warcraft fantasy but Sylvanas and Ragnaros aren't?  Thats not a consistent reason to keep Leeroy in standard.
---
yeah but why was this my golden legendary from the preorder?
---
I mean you could by not playing the doomsayer earlier (if that was an option) or waiting till you didn't have 9 cards in hand.
---
"strategy and intelligence"
---
How come people tend to forget intelligence is not just playing the cards right, but also in deck building... Seems to me your opponent built a better deck, played around your 2 brawls and baited your warpaths. Suck it up.
---
I just want my yogg lock and load deck back, it was the most fun I have ever had in hearthstone.
---
$800 isnt that bad if you plan on playing a lifetime. Thats EVERY card in print? I figured itd cost thousands to get everything.
---
I am not the one going on  other people's posts to write useless comments just to mock them, I simply answer to those who dont want to partecipate in a good discussion as they deserve. If you pay attention I haven't insulted anyone who wrote a legit comment

Are you the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

Cuz you're a little bit tilted
---
I'll play 20 warriors in a row and not see a single collider.  Then I'll forget it exists and end up losing because of it lol.
---
I'm going through to a similar issue right now and came here to see if anyone else was on the same situation
---
I believe that with ogre magi the deck would be too powerful and I don't want to flood the whole ladder with a single rogue deck (damn that's some extra /s right there gotta praise myself)
---
Jokes aside tho that deck is actually really fun to play
---
Yes, it's my cake day today!
---
No way it's him. All them 10000s of other people farming rogue with warrior are just extremely lucky.
---
A little update, blizzard is aware and working on it. [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/4-23-2019-blzbntagt00000907-blzbntagt000008fc-and-missing-play-button/4373/38](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/4-23-2019-blzbntagt00000907-blzbntagt000008fc-and-missing-play-button/4373/38)
---
The odds of getting catrina and resummoning doomsayer is extremely low to the point where not playing doomsayer earlier would be a misplay.
---
"Some cards are very good" 
---
That's a great summation you've got there, and the only way to avoid it is to play a game that isn't a card game. There will always be good cards.
---
Being able to cash out is the sole reason why MTGO is superior to hearthstone. Ive bought and sold collections many times and I always come out ahead. MY account on HS will never grow and never be worth a penny of what I've spent on the game.
---
&gt;A deck whose only wincon is fatigue shouldn't be able to exist, 
---
I disagree. I *love* that kind of deck. The problem (for me) is that I don't like warrior, and Dr Boom provides so much value that fatigue decks aren't working in other classes for me.
---
venmo me 800$ for my rent
---
It wouldn't be fun without the memes
---
Read your own comment again, but slowly. Now think why people just *might* be disagreeing with you.
---
Do you want 20 cards out of every deck or 30 cards of some and 0 of others? If you can't keep up as is, just dust it.
---
Consider, on the other side, the case where you need some extra damage coming from different bodies to gain control of the board. That's where Leokk is the most useful.
---
Depends, We don't know what the board state was like or what cards they had in their hand at the time nor the amount of mana they had. The doomsayer itself could've been a misplay.
---
Obviously its random. Its a joke on RNG. its a chance between like 5 powers
---
"This **word** is in alphabetical order" sounds like some kind of cryptic riddle.
---
Well done mate! Im stuck between rank 2 and 4. I really like the look of the deck but what is the actual reason for running witchwood piper instead of 2nd weapons project ? Can u explain her value in game ? TY
---
It looks it.  I've only seen firebat's version for a short time, but it looks pretty fun.  Him trashing ogre magi really sold me on it tho
---
good doesnt always mean frustrating

Leeroy isnt as design limiting as sylvanas and actually enables some of the aggressive archetypes that need a good finisher. Play dead, terrorscale stalker, necrium blade, zola the gorgon, necrium vial, carnivorous cube, Necromechanic, rez effects, flobiddinous floop, prince 3, undatakah, etc all have very good to game-breakingly powerful synergy with her deathrattle. Some would be okay of she had a higher mana cost, but that would make her a different card entirely.
---
I said fuck off cunt. I understand you cant even read but i am not wasting time on your retarded comments anymore. Cya fucktard
---
Dude, Warriors are objectively the most boring class to play against this season. You have no right to complain about Rogues lmao

You know, there are other parts in the world, like Europe, where we use . to indicate ks and , to indicate decimals. Luckily, not everything is America, my dude. Why do you US guys always have to be so assuming that your way is the only way? It's smug af.
---
And here we are going in circles. With little context we are unsure of whether or not playing the doomsayer when it was would be a good play. In such a circumstance this circumstance could be played around (unknowingly) while still playing correctly. Yes its pedantic but acurate.
---
Right you are. Mine was a dry utilitarian response to the very idea that maybe its better to use it there, when it never is
---
You beat me to the punch here, so I felt it was in order. :)
---
Well if it’s repeated then the death rattle for voodoo doll should trigger before the mechathun death rattle is triggered right? Why does the voodoo doll flag it to die and not kill it when it’s deathrattle is triggered?
---
How dare she defile the sacred act!
---
So glad Genn and Baku are gone. Just wish there was less RNG elements added.
---
Im so confused how hero levels work, You are level 60 with 115 win but my rogue is level 35 and has 110 wins?
---
ITS JOJO'S
---
Right, but Jojos is just a kripp reference.
---
I felt just as lost getting into standard this month.
---
The thing is that standard is more expensive than wild.  If you make a tier 1 wild deck now, it will probably still be viable in a year.
---
How about Duskfallen Aviana?
---
Hey we’re not allowed to get angry at any streamer besides toast. (Also give your post a flair)
---
Reposts have been ramping up like crazy on /r/hearthstone lately; are people really that bored with the expansion already?
---
The problem is that a lot of people want to do fun things with their control decks but die before drawing half their deck. Easy solution is if blizzard added more early game board clears like lighting storm and volcanic potion
---
Big priest relies on rezzing huge af minions to either smash face or combo off, he’s adding 3 useless 1 costs into that pool of rezzed minions. Also when the big board comes he has evolve counter whatever combo/shenanigan big priest is using.
---
Ofc I still won because ~~I'm~~ I watch the Hearthstone superstar
---
im not skilled but i seem to only encounter priest and hunter and the same deck each time, not very fun
---
Klenner#11243 NA looking to trade, I can show quest but you go first
---
Title of this post is 11/10.
---
Well, the RNG factor is part of what makes this game so unique. I understand it may be frustrating, sometimes, but it's part of why hearthstone is, well, hearthstone. But I understand your point of view u.u
---
That is true so you need plan accordingly when piloting this deck.
---
It is weird enough, given that priest sees very little priest, it's a bit of a stretch to define the current meta made of only 2 classes :3
---
Gotcha
---
Does going into settings to locate game work? I'm currently on mobile but you can go into settings and each game has a directory linked to it. I believe you can attend it to locate the game there and choose where the folder of it is.
---
Awesome thanks!

all is good :)
