I mean the whole pity timer has been discussed and analyzed to death. You're the one who just did some simple math based on nothing and claimed it implied anything. I'll try find it, but the most in depth source was a compilation of all Grand Touranment preorder results. This was also where it was confirmed that pity timer was perset, and not between all sets. It was shown chance of legend per pack % has exponential growth which has a gentle slope and starts trending up a lot \~ pack 35. The average number of packs per legend is between 18 and 19 packs.

Amulet for harrow setting-run

This has been happening to me for about a month now. Have updated the game, and completely deleted and redownloaded it like 2-3 times now and still get this message.
---
Obviously it is in Wild, for literally years now.
---
i think it‚Äôs pretty cool he has more than 30,000 in game gold. you need to get the stick out of your ass.
---
I dunno, I was enjoying wild more than standard for most of the time following the Rise of Shadows launch.
---

---
Like...Standard had like...three decks for over a month (rogue, warrior, and anti-warrior).
---
Wild balance wasn‚Äôt perfect at the time, but it was more interesting and varied than that.
---
and i love it!
---
saying false things and pretending they are true is funny.

Not losing stars = rank floor?  
---
honestly it's the most fun place to play.  Experiment with fun decks and often find other fun decks to play against.  
---
Makes me wonder if all the Warriors I concede to might actually be running interesting decks ... probably not but I still wonder.
---
Yeah I'll totally buy this, if the annoying Deck incomplete bug gets fixed and if psychic scream stops making my cards invisible, sure I'll buy your bundle. If not then I'll pass, it's not like you need to spend anything on wild if you just craft one of the better decks once, you'll be set for months cuz what's a balance patch amirite.

There is some amount of numerical shenanigans due to the [legendary card Pity Timer](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics) but assuming that you just convert all of these cards into dust it's somewhere slightly below a 50% sale on dust (since full price packs are 60 packs for $70 and this is 56 for $35).  The less obvious in dust value is from spreading the packs across expansions.  The absolute minimum dust you'd get from this purchase is 2240.  Just assume that's ALL you'll get and decide whether or not that much dust is worth $35 dollars to you.
---
Hunter, druid, mage and shaman all had viable decks.  
---
I think people need to stop thinking that if there isn't tier 1 decks there isn't any decks.
---
Yes no one has ever logged off and logged on before. You're probably the first.
---
As a new player, I would avoid Silence Priest. It's not exactly the easiest thing to play and the matchups can be quite polarizing. It also has no good upgrade paths as you get a better collection since Priest is currently the worst class.
---
I would invest in a midrange hunter deck. You can probably find a couple of budget builds out there.
---
There are literally dozens of us!
---
You keep talking about pity timer.
---
Holy shit.... That's like 1200+ packs

Have you tried checking your network connection?
---
It literally depends on the mood of the opponent. If you didn't emote a lot before hand and it was generally a fair and interesting game, then the opponent will take it as a GG. If you snagged the win from them or emoted a ton they will see it as BM. Same emote, just depends on the context as to how it will be percieved.
---
I've never tried for a refund, but I have gotten them to switch packs when I bought the wrong set (with gold).  Just don't open the packs and say you just want the packs switched to the type you meant to buy.
---
The problem is 
---
Trump review card is based on the playability of the card, not the raw power (unlike other reviewers)
---
For example, Moroes is bad (everyone agree) but it is one of the important card in quest rouge.
---
Does it mean everyone is wrong, no, it just mean some cards need other cards to support / some cards need to neft. 
---
The good thing about trump review is, unlike the ‚Äúis good, can see play, have potential, x star‚Äù he is predicting the meta, not saying is perfect, but every card have potential in some way. Bad things of coz the priest 1 star, will never see play and so much more. Look at this meta before the neft, fountain elements are good, like really good, but over shine by some warriors and rogue. 90% of cards have potential, but meta define what they are. And that‚Äôs why people watch trump review.
---
I guess that explains why the card is so weak. She‚Äôs been doing it wrong the whole time!
---
Ahh you threw off my groove!
---
You're very welcome. Happy crafting!
---
True, but you gotta be able to play your whole hand so the echo card won‚Äôt screw it up by going on the right hand side.
---
I actually beat him using my old spell Hunter with rok delar. Took maybe 2 tries. Just the old ladder deck before rotation
---
Congratulations but I disagree with your defeatist attitude, especially in today's meta game where decks are a lot weaker than last year. You can reach legend with meme decks or "just ok" decks. It takes time, dedication, and a solid base level of skill.  
---
Still your accomplishment is nothing to scoff at.
---
My friend is a new player, whereas I played earlier on and I bought the first 3 solo adventures way back when. I then went on a lonnnng hiatus.
---
When he looks at the "Solo Adventures" screen he only sees Practice and Dalaran Heist.
---
I see those two but a bunch more like Rastakhan's Rumble, Boomsday Project, all the way through League of Explorers/Blackrock Mountain/Naxxramas. I just learned I could get a couple more through the shop, so I did.
---
How can my friend unlock the basic free adventures that aren't in the shop? Note he's super new so there must be some requirement there, maybe unlocking all the classes?
---
Which surprised me all the more when a player brought not one, but *two* copies of this card to this weekend's Master's Cup to counter Mech Paladin as a sideboard.
---
goldengust#1846
---
80g trade. normal rules.
---
why did you blur out questing adventurers eyes
---
NA?
---
Daddyus works better
---
There a rastakhan rumble epic that gives you a card from the opponent's deck. Maybe he used that?
---
Sounds like more math than I signed up for. ü§ì
---
You made 10k gold since Dalaran heist was released as F2P with no Arena??
---
Let's math this out. Assuming you get 60 gold a day from quests (I'm guessing this is about the expected value if you reroll all less than 60 quests), 60 gold * 365 days (2016 was a leap year) * 3 years = 65,700 gold which means you would have had to win 10,290 games in that time (34,300 remaining gold to get * 3 wins / 10 gold). 10,290 wins / 365 days a year / 3 years = approx 9.39 wins per day. Assuming a 50% win rate, it's about 18 games a day. Lets say a game takes about 7 minutes per game (based on data from https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/statistics-on-the-duration-of-hearthstone-games-over-16000-analyzed/), you're looking at 126 minutes a day to get these wins. Bringing it full circle, this took OP 126 minutes a day * 365 days * 3 years = 137,970 minutes / 60 minutes = 2,299.5 hours / 24 hours = 95.8 days of play time without spending gold or getting any bonus gold from quests.
---
No, but I have spent my dust while drunk. Golden Nat, Golden Cho, Golden Knuckles... üò≠üò≠üò≠

We will probably get a new skin or a new Yogg, that will bring them in more money than making decent tournaments and caring about competitive integrity

---
I think his point is that, while it is possible to hit legend with a meme deck, you're gonna have a much harder time of it. The average person should just buckle down with an established T1 deck instead of making excuses about why they never get past rank 3.
---
That's an incredibly niche battlecry without even much payoff, especially if there's a divine shield in the way. Nobody would play that even if it was a power creeped yeti.
---
Like this reddit gold ?!

Make his effect trigger before or at the start of his turn. Or exclude a player from the rotation if they have no minions.

Paladin got equality consecration, that's board clear
---
&gt; He's also getting nerfed in tje next balance patch
---
Source plz? I cant find anything on this
---
The state of your collection doesn't matter since you're going to dust them.
---
Say that a new set comes out and you've already opened 80 packs from gold, so you're mostly getting dust now and you spent $50 in the pre-order instead of this bundle. With the new packs you will be opening at the very least new full legendaries, which are potentially worth 4 times as much dust as the old ones (because you're not dusting them). A single legendary that you don't dust from the new set almost offsets the price difference, since 100 dust is roughly a buck (it's less dust but for simplicity's sake). And you're also opening epics.
---
What would you do if I randomly saw you and deciding to violate your personal space without consent?
---
You'd probably think I was a fucking nutter. That's what you look like.
---
Should I add you with my account that has the same name as this account and play a game?
---
You don't need 2 violet hazes
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible. It‚Äôs just very strange that he manages to do that and gets perma banned half a month later.
---
&gt;The numbers are pulled from my ass because they dont matter
---
They absolutely do though, because we're talking about pricing, and what you get for your money is very relevant. 
---
&gt;My counterpoint is that if somebody spends $728659 on a single card in MTG it is because that card is worth $728659.
---
Thats very nice, but I quote myself:
---
&gt;If you play standard in MTG, the majority of your shit loses like 80% value when it rotates guaranteed
---
The going price doesn't matter in your resale argument, the value of the card in the future does (when you're actually selling).
---
&gt;If you spend $1 on packs to craft a legendary in HS thats it. The money is gone. You will never see that dollar again. You have nothing to show for it
---
Well, except y'know, a more complete collection that you can play with, which you hopefully care about since you just spent money/time/resources on it? Saying you have nothing to show for it is silly, beause you know what you're going to get; hearthstone cards. The fact that you have nothing physical doesn't mean it can't be worth anything to people. If someone deleted your steam account, and when you complained about it other people said "well, you had nothing of value on the account, because you couldn't sell it (openly)", then hopefully you realize how silly that argument is. 
---
Yeah, like most entertainment you get no money back from the money/time invested into HS. I do not see why this is inherently a problem, feel free to explain this to me. 
---
I see problems related to this to be more about the price compared to what you get, rather than the actual fact that you 'get no money back'. 
---
&gt;But that goes both ways. The cards that arent worth anything also dont cost anything when buying singles.
---
I don't like insulting, but this is just retarded mate, of course the cards cost a lot when buying singles, unless you just buy draft chaff.
---
Jades. Take jades.
---
Both really. I'm personally saving up gold to buy the Dalaran Heist chapters as I go and it's just a really rewarding feeling grinding through quests and finally getting what you want. In terms of dollars, rands for me, I work for my salary so if I feel like occasionally  buying a pack or two or a value bundle then why not?
---
I mean correct if I'm wrong here but I don't really see HS as a P2W kind of game. Sure you can buy enough packs to eventually get that legendary but that doesn't mean you'll have it in every game. Dr Boom and Haggatha for example are without a doubt annoying to come up against but surely the outcome of a game is more dependent on how you deal with a situation than on what cards your opponent has.
---
Not to mention the 10 gold per 3 wins.....
---
I don't think it tracks combinations of deck and hero power, so you just need to beat each deck with some hero power and each hero power with some deck, not each possible combination. You can do this in 4 runs for any given choice of chapter and class, rather than the 12 you would need for each combination.
---
You could craft whizbang tho. Save you a lot of struggle
---
Yeah you're right, I forgot about that lol
---
Mau #2516 EU 80G trade
---
Dr Boom. 
---
It should be atleast 9 mana, so you can't get a heropower in with it. 
---
At 7 mana it should probably be "Give the mechs in your hand and deck rush. I was baffled the first time i saw the card and remain baffled that it has a global effect. I would have thought that having to nerf quest rogue a bunch of times woulf have though blizzard that those are a terrible idea.
---
Because you can do a new deck and hero power at the same time. This means you don't need to multiply by 3, leaving you with 180.
---
I.e. first run use the base deck and hero power,second run switch to second deck and hero power,allowing you to check all 4 in 2 runs.
---
You're misunderstanding the goal. The goal is to get all of the check marks. There's no reason to do every deck with every hero power.
---
Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of cards with vanilla stats and powerful effects.
---
From the top of my head, this includes:
---
1. Arcanologist. 2 Mana 2/3 tutor, especially one that tutors out a card for the next-turn play, is insane.
---
2. Underbelly Angler. People knew this card was absolutely nuts soon as they saw it. And they were completely right. It carries Murloc Shaman.
---
3. Houndmaster Shaw. 4 Mana 3/6 is good, but the effect is incredible. A massive step above, say, Water Elemental.
---
4. Necromechanic and Thunderhead post-change. They're not as "offensive" as Houndmaster Shaw, but my oh my are they tough bodies on powerful effects. Thunderhead gets Voltaic Burst every time you Overload, and Necromechanic can duplicate very powerful Deathrattles while still being a vanilla minion. They are "dangerous" cards.
---
Oh, and Crystology being 1 Mana is utterly bonkers. I get they wanted to buff only Boomsday cards but yikes.
---
With that said, these cards are powerful but don't seem to have gotten on people's nerves as utterly broken or something. Indeed, their effects tend not to be as flashy as the Mad Genius' or Omega Devastator's.
---
Oh. Yeah. Omega Devastator should be 5 Mana imo. Make it similar to Omega Agent. Except Omega Devastator would still absolutely be playable at 5 Mana, especially since it would still be a Mech and benefit from the Mad Genius' Mech-Rush buff.
---
Eu rifathemage #2465 add me for double trade you go first ƒ± have reps :)
---
That makes sense! Probably doesn't help that my laptop actually has a touch screen. Searching is incredibly annoying because it keeps jumping, and also "resets" the search, so I have to press the x to cancel twice before it actually lets me search again.
---
Actually, I always squelch my opponent when the situation comes when there is a card that wins him the game and I just hit the 'End Turn' button. I know you are not mean-spirited but I hate when my opponents call the game as done before they show their winning card, I'm like "just play the card and say 'Well Played' when the game is actually over!".
---
But yeah, every person takes emoting differently, and if someone doesn't like that emote at the end of the game, they can just squelch like I do :) Just wanted to let you know a different point of view.
---
I can imagine how that design got brought up. 
---
"Hey guys, let's fuck with ZamorakHawk...."
---
Sometimes a card hard counters a deck type so hard I die on the inside. In this case it counters all of my decks. But that's the price of living for the meme.
---
well everything with spells. Vs definetly 3 mages as boss 10,11 and 12. Calling that it makes it easier is wrong. They strongly profit from it.
---
If you think this is fun, try to combine it with "Rocketlauncher". Easy board removal, but be carefull as it would also kill all of your minions.
---
Use his balance on a golden millhouse
---
I feel you. I can't read that either :&gt;
---
I just don‚Äôt find it more fun because decks like big priest, kingsbane rogue, and some others have dominated for so long. There‚Äôs no sign that these decks will be disappearing soon because they have been lowering the power level of new sets not increasing
---
With the Hunter having such poor board removal cards that's actually not a bad move if my back is against the wall.
---
Zayle seemed kinda lame to me, but I suppose it could be fun for playing vs friends and even if I have most of the decks then at least getting to play Rogue once in a while would be cool? I guess if I've already paid 1400 into it it's probably worth finishing for 6 packs, 1 golden and lots of singleplayer content. I'll keep hoarding for now but I'll probably splash out soon, just the constructed side of me wants to save for next xpac.

I don't know exactly how many hours. I have a golden warlock and almost golden priest, 100+ legendaries (I have never payed money to anything) and I play a lot of tavern brawls when it is one where you can make your own deck and something cool is happening (not something like: cast a random spell whenever you play a minion). I am currently trying to beat all bosses in each difficulty in each chapter, with each hero, each hero power and each starting deck.
---
I didn‚Äôt know the concept of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù was objective. If someone doesn‚Äôt play the game then this bundle is worthless but if you‚Äôre very into the game 0.625 per pack is pretty decent value. 
---
Varies from person to person.
---
In a tavern I managed to get a "look at 4 spells in your deck, reduce one of its cost by 2" card and I used it for this.
---
Imagine if they thought you cheated the system and reset your gold count to 0.
---
Either with the Spells cost 2 less anoaly or with Bartender Bob reducing the price of a spell by 3.

Alone the thought of seeing cards again that I was glad that they rotated completely turns me off from wild. I don't want to see so many cards from the last rotation ever again, that I probably won't touch wild with a ten foot pole.

I had  anomaly - arcane which reduces the cost of all spells by (2) resulting in this  monstrosity

But have you cleared it with all hero powers and decks?

You can tell in this case because they're curved swords. Curved. Swords.
---
Nope, it doesn't.
---
Madmen! truelly awesome!
---
depends on your cards that you have but if it makes you feel any better I was able to hit legend with mech hunter so its definitely doable. if you feel like you're losing alot, just take a small break.
---
Charge minions don't risk getting deleted by Sap or Silence, or simply 2+ for 1 removed. They also can't be avoided with board control or removal. Mechs are fine in their current state. There's just not many alternatives.
---
I may open a couple more before the next expansion comes out, but generally yes.

It will?

The auto loss to Haro ... ughfgh. Anyways, I‚Äôve found that most of my best runs with super synergetic decks got killed at some point, and lame decks with good player decisions got me to win it on heroic mode, even if the deck was not that fun, and even when the synergy was clearly off, that was counter intuitive and winning it was ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. The only class I really enjoyed was mage and Druid. Maybe some of the rogue, and I did won one time with Warrior but mage was top of my preferences for normal and heroic mode.

This card is the death knight warrior card from Knight of The Frozen Throne, which features Garrosh. Since this boss from the solo copies Garrosh in his pode and everything else, they mad him have the same card, but changed the art to be like him as well
---
Oh it is a little achievement. Irrelevant one too. Imagine being so pathetic you are proud of being legend on FUCKING WILD. LMFAO
---
One of the bosses is Dazzik, who pretends to be Warchief of the Horde. His portrait is a play on Garrosh. His deck has the Warrior death Knight card but the portrait is changed to Dazzik (which is obviously unique to this boss)
---
Look at the card art. It's not Garrosh. It's the goblin pretending to be Garrosh.
---
So, just checking back in, but yeah .. mtga has been great.  I've got the tree thing completed for all those decks and cards.  Just working on the last few levels for the wildcards.  Have done a little ranked play, I've done a draft (on my 2nd one now... Think I'm 3-1).  So yeah, pretty hooked at the moment.  The interface isn't too bad, kind of a mix between the old stand alone magic games on steam and mtgo.

Still need to get my pauses figured out, I don't like that it just autopaseses when I have no options..  like... Way to broadcast to my opponent that I'm holding 2 lands!  Lol.  I do hold control so far, but it sometimes doesn't work out anyways, so just need to fiddle with it.
---
Uhh one thing that's kinda annoying, when did there become all these uncommon planeswalkers?  I'm going into draft matches and it's not uncommon for there to be 5 out at once.  
---
I'm debating the $50 m20 bundle.  I know when I used to play paper, 2 boxes of 36 (72 packs) generally got me full uncommon play set and like 12 mythics.  I'd have to still work hard at getting full set of dual lands, but generally, that was enough of a purchase to get me going.  With the smaller packs, how far will 50 packs get me?
---
The art is different to reflect the boss's hero portrait.
---
 Because warrior, rogue and mage?
---
by far the best animation in the game
---
What did it cost? Everything.
---
Probably mostly classic from Tavern Brawls
---
This is good to know. I feel like whenever I play KT against the AI, they immediately kill it, but I'm not sure how many times I've managed to get a taunt up as well.  I will have to keep this in mind!
---
Update: I've managed to find that a couple of other people that also tried this method late (within the last two weeks rather than two months ago) are having issues too. I haven't find a work around though.

Hungry Crab is so much swingier. 1 mana 3/4, destroy your opponent's 1 mana 3/2. You pretty much just win if you activate Crab on turn 1 or 2.

Bloodreaver Nemsy? Shadowreaper Lazul? Deathseer Rastakahn?

Mech seems more common than beast.

Fuck. This. Boss.

I played a Pala deck focused on buffing big minions  combined with a healing Hands deck and double divine shield hero power.
---
Had a 5/12 taunt life steal minion at turn 4 I built up because he summoned some retardedly strong early pressure minions. Insta entombed. RIP
---
Took some face damage before building up a second big taunt minion.
---
&gt;Mind controlled so he had two Lichkings my taunt minion and a rag and obsidian. I had a one card hand.
---
I used my holy grail card "discover a legendary and summon 5 copies"  got yesera. 
---
" Ok, I might have a shot here" 
---
Long story short It merely delayed the inevitable and I wasted 1 hour of my life on a playthrough that I was never gonna win
---
Can someone who speaks Oktoberfest explain this to me
---
NoobyMcNoobface here, i just started out. The characters are all over lvl.15 now and i got some golden cards, same of which i alteady have. I bought some classic packs from daily quest gold and i guess i should start to understand the crafting process now. Do i trash all my golden cards? Or the normal duplicates? What do i start crafting?How do i get more material for crafting? Do i just go on playing other players? Does it make sense to play the solo stuff? Can you win stuff there that you can use in your decks? So many questions.... sorry
---
ü§î
---
This is easily the best they've done.
---
Thank you for explaining!  Folks like you are the true heroes.
---
Meh, I've seen about 3 others just today.
---
Do the last 2 draw cards when you summon them?
---
I think it'd be kinda contextual. As an example, in my family, when the kids are being super loud, we always got yelled at with "Was ist mit dem schreie!" Interchangeable, maybe?
---
Rakanishu obviously.
---
Go to options and hit that red button
---
It's like 15 cards different.  I'll show you for now and maybe do a thread later: 
---

It's a lackey, thief, mech, deathrattle list.  Huge swing with Necrium Blade + Mech Whelp, or 6 mana Sn!p.  It can also just draw a card if you havne't pulled other battlecries, or let you get a "random" minion from Pinata to trigger your vendetta.  Barista is there for a couple swings, often used to get more Blink/Drakkari, or Hench-Clan (love this guy).  Also, for a second Heistbaron, or better yet, the 3 mana treasure to spawn 2 legendaries can be 2 battlecry legendaries, and with her for 8 mana to get 2 potentially game changing minions.  Rusty is in the list to fight against Hunter, It can make a 5/6 divine shield lifesteal minion with Zilliax, or 7/5 with Pinata.  If you can get a Rusty to stick a round, you can Sn!ip it for 3/6/9 mana and get a huge lifesteal taunt to get your life total up.  Zilliax can also be used after destroying your 2/2 Whelp to make a 10/9 rush lifesteal.  Enjoy!

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
I pulled Prince Valanar, Seargent Sally, Golden Scourgelord Garrosh, krul the unshackled, chogall, and ghazrilla
---
Hang on I thought the image of Dr. Boom in Garrosh's armor was a joke. Is that in the game somewhere?
---
Who?
---
Also probably not who you're thinking of no
---
True. In that case then yeah they're going face.
---
Yeah, my thoughts as well. OP probably meant ThatsAdmirable.
---
I highly disagree with you there. You usually only choose crown if you're desperate for board. In a deck where every card is chosen to help you to throw giant bunnies at the board, Wand is usually the best option.
---
Specially since legendaries are tending to go more towards low stats good effect cards and less towards the ball of stats they used to be.
---
Nice.
---
Which the warrior would have had to do anyway if you didn't CC one of them again...
---
No, I really took one in that interaction.

---
Sweet! A golden Khadgar and 1600 dust!!!
---
I don't know, for me, even you can develop a board, the damage deals by the board is still very small, as most of your 1 and 2 drops only deal 1-2 damage. If you don't have a deadly shot or hunter's mark and they drop a giant at turn 4/5, you pretty much have no answer to it
---
An opponent in the new solo.
---
Deck is probably still viable right?
---
The title is in english, so why isn‚Äôt the card?
---
Per another comment, it's 5 armor in regular and 10 armor in heroic.
---
It‚Äôs apart of Hearthstone deck tracker. His opponent has 10 power in play.
---
A 4/8
---
Furb#21223 trading 80g quest EU, you go first, i can show first
---
Yeah I‚Äôve already gotten a legendary for each standard pack and make sure I do the weekly tavern brawl so it sounds like ROS is the best thing to get with my gold. Thanks!
---
Well, getting a lot of war of Sparks packs now.  Just completed a 5-1 draft, so invested 1500 gem and got 3 packs to draft, 6 packs as prize, plus 1800 gem back?  Forget, but it was more than I spent.  So 9 packs though right there.  Maybe I won't put $50 into packs.
---
and fun was all I wanted from the combo :) (also shuffling 1 mana alex into the deck and 1 mana lotheb is op op)
---
good bot
---
#bromance
---
Woow so my guessing is right?!!..
---
Btw I actually like to make my own decks and name them instead of just naming them
---
"Big priest"/ "Zoolock" etc...
---
I don‚Äôt consider it BM.  I know that you‚Äôre saying hi.
---
But they're in the wrong order.
---
Kibler??
---
Wild is much more fun than standard. Blizzard, however, does everything they can do to try and stop people from playing it because they don‚Äôt want to have to actually balance wild.
---
I don‚Äôt follow him rn

heh heh heh 69...

Time to learn German (it‚Äôs German right?) so that I can learn what this post is saying and so I can appreciate Blizzard for these awesome interactions!
---
That escalated quickly
---
Opponent greats. I use "threaten" and squelch. I'm farming gold, I'm not looking for a social experience. 
---
Blizzard please, enable auto squelch. Sometimes I forget to do it.
---
What is this?
---
22 pogo hoppers in a dalaran heist deck, id say thats unbalanced
---
Naw, I just apparently didn't understand wock. When it transforms it stops. The Swampqueen minion cast storm bringer. I just got unlucky.
---
Fuck you're right. I've finished 1-3 rank in the last 3-4 months and somehow didn't know this. Thanks.
---
From my point of view the Jedi are evil!
---
It‚Äôs the case, they changed(nerfed) shudder to be like yogg where if it dies/it‚Äôs transformed the battlecry stops.
---
&gt;Magnetic is incredibly strong,
---
It's strong in the exact same way as Aura enchantments in Magic the Gathering. Yeah, it makes your minion big, but when your opponent inevitably removes it by spending only one card, you'll be down at least one more card than your opponent.
---
&gt;as long as they have even a 1/1 they can magnetize two warbots and bam that's an 11/11 with CHARGE. 
---
I will say buff effects in Hearthstone are stronger than Aura Enchantments in Magic because removal tends to be more expensive in the latter, attackers in the latter get to choose where damage goes, and card advantage is a bit more fluid in Hearthstone, but my point still stands.
---
Granted, buff effects do have an extra weakness in Hearthstone that they don't in Magic, and it's avible to all classes: Silence.
---
&gt;Or all they have to do is summon all of their bombs and that's an automatic 50% from the enemy's hp without them having to do anything else. 
---
Yeah. That's what aggressive decks do. Granted, the Goblin Bombs actually have to die. They don't just deal two damage naturally.
---
Control Warrior doesn't have the worst match-up against it for a good reason.
---
&gt;And what is up with the missle launcher/poison combo? 
---
Oh yes. The eight mana and two card combo in a class that can't really tutor either card up that does clear the board and leave a 6/6 up. It loses to pretty much every form outright single target removal and silence. Try playing some.
---
&gt;Did no seriously think that might be a little too strong? 
---
Well, for the first six months the combo existed, it did absolutely nothing in Standard or wild.
---
&gt; And if all else fails just summon ZulJin and gg. 
---
Mech Hunter doesn't play Zul'jin nor an ample amount of spells to really justify playing the card. If Unleash the Beast isn't being played in your Hunter deck, you really shouldn't even consider playing Zul'jin.
---
Xur'ios is a boss from the new Dalaran adventure. His hero power is that any spells drawn cost zero during the same turn. His first card drawn was Arcane Intellect into Power of Creation to summon two Auctioneers which results in him unloading his entire deck on my face.
---
Not that I really doubt it, but please include the pictures that show that you beat them with each hero power as well. I wanna see the ultimate proof of that 100% completion in one album.
---
Here's a little lesson in trickery
---
Why is Zilliax so good? I run him in my stupid shitty Oblivitron deck because he's magnetic and good but I see him all the time in stuff like murloc shaman and spell damage mage and other decks he doesn't belong in. Without magnetizing him, he's a 5 mana 3/2 underneath the keywords. Why does he earn a spot in all these nearly mechless decks?

---
Maybe a video of someone opening forty packs from a set and not getting a legendary.  If there's no pity timer, surely one would have surfaced by now?  All data collected in any sort of official capacity has supported the theory that there's a pity timer.
---
  
---
Blizzard support aren't the people who make the game.  They parrot whatever they're told to.  And they're blizzard, so they have a vested interest in the answer that's given to the question.
---
Shudderwock can only cast a maximum of 40 battlecries, maybe that is the problem?
---
Maybe for the others, but Mountain Giant has been a core/deck-defining card in at least one top tier deck for at least the last year and a half.
