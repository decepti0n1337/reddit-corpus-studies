3 years , 151 ranked hunter wins. Impressive. 
---
That makes sense, seeing as I live out in the countryside in my country the internet speeds are not half as good as someone from a city's. I will try it anyways though, thank you!
---
Says him?
---
Let's play guess the Verb.
---
Yeah that's happened multiple times before too
---
I like the idea of a card which gives you retroactive value on your battlecries, like you said, resulting in effects like a board clear, adding something to your hand, copying a minion on the board...just crazy value. I like that.
---
What I don't like is that at some arbitrary point in the late game, you could play a single 9 mana card, and just because you have played the other cards in your deck throughout the game, no differently than any other deck would, you just win the game outright.
---
And if you don't win, it's because the matchup was by default in your opponent's favor, or your draws were bad, or their draws were good, or some combination of those things. It was never a matchup where it felt like my decisions determined whether or not I won the game. There is just nothing interesting or engaging about that type of gameplay to me, that I can make all the best plays possible every turn for the whole game, and then with any amount of health left, I can just lose because you drew and played one card. Even Frost Lich Jaina which gives an insane amount of value for one card doesn't literally just win you the game because you played it with almost no cards left in your deck. That's a stupid thing for one card to do.
---
Like, imagine if in Exodia Mage you could just play your Sorcerer's Apprentices for early game tempo, and Antonidas' effect was "Battlecry: If you have played 2 Sorcerer's Apprentices, 2 Molten Reflections, and 6 other spells at any point this game, win the game."  That's basically Shudderwock.
---
**How long can this go on?!**
---
Boom isn't original to Hearthstone, he's from WoW. He's a quest boss in Netherstorm.
---
This hugely depends on how much you play.
---
I assume you want to dust cards to make good decks to climb ladder. But the reward for ladder is almost nothing. Dusting (non-extra) cards make you fall so far behind on expanding your collection. You will consistently end up playing only 2-3 decks at each given time, and if those decks are good, they will inevitably get nerfed, which makes you playability for the game almost zero. The dust economy is all about the rich getting richer (just like any economy), and dusting cards is the sure way to make yourself poor.
---
Since around KFT, I have gained at the very least 20k dust from nerfed cards (with the next HoF rotation). I don't even need to dust my other cards anymore and still survive comfortably. Of course, if you dust the majority of your cards, you will benefit little from those nerfs.
---
Oh sure, but part of the complexity of the deck was using warsong to board clear which role compressed the deck hard. That's gone and its a different deck. 
---
That's a bold statement.
---
I want one that says not roping, kid trying to kill themselves 
---
Heh, thankie kindly
---
Why the fuck would the single player be not be related to the expansion 
---
It's a tough one, I must admit.
---
You open 1 quest guarantees when you opened those packs? 
---
I reject your reality and substitute a narrative I find more compelling
---
In the long term, very bad.  But some people want the short term dust.  At the very least, you don't want to dust it until you are done opening packs in the set.  The worst thing you want is to dust it and then open it again later.  (having a copy prevents you from getting it in the future).
---
My thoughts also, I really don‚Äôt believe that every single teaser got spoiled accidentally
---
Ha, ha,
---
#HAAA!
---
he wins the game off this play, the hunter has no cards and he gets 2 cards with lifesteal + taunt. 
---
Is this even your final form?
---
Bold of you to assume Team 5 is gonna use some actual existing lore characters.
---
I've been playing since release and I only started playing Ranked in the past two years. Some people played casual to start, I played Arena for the first two years exclusively.
---
Gg Godlento
---
I got  Exodia'd by a damn Rogue...fun brawl...
---
Absolute. Unit.
---
What the point of the Warrior quest and reward? Like what is the reward supposed to encourage? 
---
Do you even play hearthstone. Who the fuck calls it PvP
---
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted you‚Äôre right
---
Damn, thanks!
---
No it's every 3 days.  Re-rolling would increase the average.  For instance, I average 70g per quest over the last 6 months.  And I'm not even counting the gold you get for those 20 match sessions or special rewards.
---
Again, it's fine not everyone plays the same or spends the same.  I wouldn't describe those 3 years as "grinding".
---
Now that's controversy :) I hate her even more than DK Rexxar: Rexxar still has to craft zombeasts and the choices he gets are sometimes lousy, but FL Jaina is simply a water-elemental-summoning lifesteal machine, so it feels like you should have a card that does 30 face damage to beat her most of the time. And even that may be not enough as she gains armor with that one little elemental... The epitomy of oppression
---
Sitting on a pathetic 1k, but I got dust for days. 
---
Yes lol 
---
So like the %.1?
---
It was Regiskiblin who did it for RR
---
100% sure she will be there. There's no way she won't make her a card.
---
You in shop class 
---
Is it an OTK deck and can I get a deck recipe, that seems interesting. 
---
Rip tgt front seat dude....
---
Not with a druid‚Äôs power
---
List? I'm quite bored of burning people down with Aggro Mage. 
---
He could also have a quest to play warlock cards and\or deal damage to a player. Its not like he did more than one emote and then roped him before killing him.
---
No imo. Like it the way it is.
---
Oh snap, it‚Äôs freeze mage. 
---
Malorne.  The controversy is people think it's bad :)
---
If you care just a bit about class identity, Spreading Plague makes up for Druid's 'natural' weakness versus wide boards in a way that armour generation‚Äîas excessive as it recently has been‚Äîdoesn't.

Rogue 1800 wins, I think warlock is 2nd on 200.
---
Seems interesting, hopefully the choppy animation is paired with the song trailer announcement, prey to the ben brode that it is
---
I doubt they did it out of the kindness of their hearths. They have data, i'm sure they had data showing people who get duplicates are more likely to quit, and less likely to spend. 
---
It would be nutty if CITIZENS OF DALARAN is the actual name of the expansion.
---
CakeyCookie#1300 NA looking to spectate someone getting a win. Can help if you have this too or help with something else
---
I‚Äôm the shop class teacher. 
---
Don't have a recipe on me at this moment but it was a midrange deck with an OTK finisher (Malygos + Darkbombs and Soulfires after a Thaurissan tick). Not many like it these days
---
This. It also completely messes up any game plan: by its class identity, hunter should be aggro, tempo, or midrange, and based on a hit-or-miss aggression. With DSR it's that EXCEPT oh hey, suddenly we're playing control or even fatigue. DSR was not a good idea, especially with minimum limitation on which beasts can be "stitched together" (if you had to choose between text and keyword, would be much more balanced; now you can have both, making some of them just unbearably oppressive)
---
BEGONE FOWL CREATURE YOU ARE NOT WANTED HERE DEMONIC BEAST

Rank 20 is not even close to a shit show. There's a lot of experimentation between ranks 10-20. 
---
I'm thinking it'll be whatever the group of villains ends up calling itself. That way it would serve as a nice foil to the League of Explorers and give us an easy way to refer to them.

And on pre-contructed brawls it's annoying to constantly be reminded that you can't use the cards you collected. Both brawls types exist for both sides of the spectrum.

I want him also:(
---
It'll probably be the League of Explorers with the addition of Marin and/or one of the Boom scientists or Rumble champs.
---
They use Boom because Hearthstone took him from a minor NPC to an iconic character people identified with Hearthstone. It's not necessarily about players *liking* him, though I'm sure a lot of people do. It's about branding and building upon iconic and memorable characters.
---
Combo decks win conditions typically hit faster than the mill.
---
Why mind shatter and not dinomancy?
---
I played tons of quests... and crafted many.

What's funny to me, though, is that the only quests I don't own are the quests that were meta: Mage, Warrior, and Rogue.

I mean, Dr. Boom was THE card during GvG. It‚Äôs reasonable for him to feature prominently in the Hearthstone pantheon. It‚Äôs hard to say whether they‚Äôre leaning on him too much right now, since we still don‚Äôt know what the teasers mean or what the next expansion is. If the point of these teasers is that they‚Äôre going to fill in the backstory of some of our recent expansions, including prominent characters from each, is that really so bad?

I'll be honest... part of me hoped the final card in the recent teasers would be a mysterious hooded figure...
---
Hey mate can you point me to a decklist or where I might get it from this
---
I love this stupidly bad deck because it‚Äôs the most interesting thing to play in this stale time pre-expansion, but I admit I‚Äôm not good at it, so any help is appreciated ha
---
Have you found someone?
---
You have terrible security issues if an iconic goblin of Hearthstone makes you feel embarrassed to be seen playing the game.
---
You are the king at unnecessarily splitting hairs and missing the point.
---
No idea why you're counting the Hall of Fame as a "nerf."
---
Oops. I haven't seen the rafaam trailer.  Kinda got bored after the first one lol. Haven't really played since the Christmas break. Gonna tune in when they actually start telling us stuff, but not having rafaam as a thief rogue card is an opportunity wasted. 
---
Craft Genn and Baku and their odd and even cards. They are being hall of famed early because they are too powerful. You get all your dust back and you get to keep the cards. You can even dust them after the hall of fame for extra dust. 
---
That list is the reason i'm coming back to play. A lot of fun solid cards sure, but oh man is the power level about to drop a metric fuckton, as opposed to last rotation when fuck all changed. 
---
I posted that from my phone, didn't see that. Thanks autocorrect ! But yeah it's a nice autocorrect :)
---
There‚Äôs a whole lot of shit decks right now. Academic esp. needs to be cut in half! 10 cards at a mana cost of 1 is absurd. I‚Äôd really like to know what they were thinking on this one.  The problem is a fundamental one in that players get so hooked on winning that they play the ‚Äòmeta‚Äô which means that everyone plays the same 3 or 4 decks at a time. Why not come up with a deck of your own that‚Äôs fun to play? You won‚Äôt win so much but it‚Äôll be more enjoyable. 
---
HS could make wild more fun by retiring some cards temporarily.  Most wild games are the same - coldlight oracle - return to hand - oracle again return to hand, make three copies of oracle, return that one to hand. Oh my cards - vanish back to hand. What a cheesy ass gimmick. 
---
I think if it costed 2 mana that'd actually be a very fair and balanced card. The effect would be somewhat weaker than Loatheb but it'd be better for being far easier to fit in a turn
---
True, I don't play wild so I forgot that it's a battlecry and not a start of game effect for some reason
---
Nearly spit out my drink when I looked at this for some reason. Bravo.  #zombiechow2019

Heh, I actually don't remember if I originally pulled Maly but after playing Maly Rogue through the Troggs rule meta the deck grew on me and I crafted him golden. My most treasured virtual posession haha.

AND MY AXE
---
Only lady in white decks I have seen couldn't survive for long, even against slower decks. As it turns out, the power spike after turn 6 is not really THAT great when your highest tempo play before that point was an unbuffed unpowered steambot. I'm not talking about only times they don't draw Lady in White on curve, either; even when she is played, the priest is left with no board, almost no hp, and can only really play whatever minion they topdecked (if they even topdecked a minion).
---
If she ever sees play, it will be incidentally, as a slight buff on a deck that just happens to have a lot of x/x+2 minions. I highly doubt a deck running unpowered steambots will ever work.
---
Boom the random quest boss with no significance whatsoever is from WoW.
---
Boom the mad genius, face of GvG and Boomsday, and king of the meta from 2014-2015 is from HS.
---
Suffice it to say, though he comes from WoW, his ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù comes from Hearthstone.
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
What class would she be as a hero card or portrait?
---
I do not think we will see any of the characters as epic, simple due to the fact that it makes no sense that you can have more then one In each deck, also the significant role they have in the HS universe
---
All of the minions in hearthstone have no name, except legendaries. Legendaries have their names and stories, they are unique and the only ones in the world.
---
Epics, rares, commons and basics have never had names, their card names are just descriptions / professions. Have you ever seen an epic minion with his own name? I think not (The Ancient One is the only exception, I guess, but he is uncollectable).
---
Either all team members will be printed as legendaries, or won't be printed at all.

I adjusted it a bit because I don't have some cards (cho) and some are a bit too greedy I think (faceless manipulator) but I'll try it later on

What do the numbers stand beside the games stand for?
---
At first I thought they were prize pools for the games, but

a) they add up to a lot more than the total prize money count in the corner

b) I find it hard to believe Hearthstone had over 25m prize pool last year when the world championship has a 1m prize pool.

Honestly thought it was going to take me forever to get 1 win this week since I don't have enough of the cards for these combo decks but just threw together a beast hunter with some big boys in there and have gone 3-0 so far.
---
The basic idea is to get a bunch of minions out and use cybernetic chip to keep your hand full. Hopefully this can help people without too big of a collection. If you don't have rexxar/oondasta etc it's not really important, just search for beast and put some big ones in.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Cool idea but the actual effects and quests are pretty bad I think.
---
Also I hope we will not get quest cards again. I really enjoy what they did with Jan‚Äôalai. It feels like a quest but it‚Äôs not a big focus on how to play the deck than actual quest cards. I hope Blizz will make more of  that kind of with the next expansions.
---
a jank deck is a low quality deck based on fun interactions that have no real impact on the game, and thus aren't competitive. it's a Magic Arena term sorry about that.
---
And yes, i was playing in standard, that is what bothered me and made me question the match making algorythm.
---
Trailer is probably tonight
---
Talanji will be finally playable again.
---
Id be shocked tbh. Im expecting one more teaser then the stream
---
The theory could work with all of the character:
---
King togwaggle want to get back in past and get his treasure back;
---
Agatha probably wants to get back so she can defeat the monster hunters;
---
Dr boom wants another chance with his crush...????.
---
As for the fortune teller, it could be something like she promised to everyone in the group that they will have their chance at changing the past, but in the end she betray everyone and try to get the old gods back.
---
At least that's what came to my mind reading your theory... 
---
Starcraft and LoL were almost caught up to CS and DOTA just went nah fuck you guys

Nah. What else are they going to tease about? It‚Äôs all the villains revealed. Now it‚Äôs time to reveal their plan towards Dalaran hence, the trailer

How??
---
This is the general opinion but it just makes whoever says it look stupid. It was so powerful, you need help if you couldn't play that deck and win most matches. Compared to aggro decks maybe, cos aggro on autopilot revolves around playing the cards you can afford mana on and going face, you had to think about a few more things with Patron Warrior but it was still pretty autopilot bar a few fringe moments.
---
&gt; skill intensive decks such as mill warrior. The card was never oppressive in standard

Ballsohard#1314 NA 80g quest trade

I have that problem also. It has something to do with the quests. When you are playing and the daily quest "arrives" the hearthstone client wents blurry.
---
The solution is to restart...
---
Which server do you play on and which game game modes are your favorites? I can recommend Discord servers based on that. 
---
Imb4 it's just three expansions of iconic villains doing iconic villain things for 12 months. 
---
Honestly, that doesn't sound that bad.
---
It‚Äôs definitely gonna be my go to. Walk the plank is nice, but it adds no tempo. 
---
Won VS OTK mage as non-antonidas OTK by fatigue. Best feel ever as I though I was done
---
&gt;Funny how things can change so quickly and go from a meme deck to top tier
---
It's not funny. It's just how slowly people cotton on to powerful strategies/cards. People tend to think the game is solved and they know what cards/decks/classes are good or bad at a particular time. But if more people were out there experimenting and trying new ideas, what we think is powerful now would seem weak.
---
Finley was a card in the expansion or maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding what your saying 
---
3 rank gap is fine since everyone plays the same braindead decks on rank 1-10 anyways

No more Khadgar for the love of god! I got so sick of him in wow to the point when i can‚Äôt listen to his voice anymore. Maybe it‚Äôs just me tho
---
If his objective is to travel back in time then we already know he failed.
---
cool!
---
Instead of a fee, just set up a system where people can only enter once a day (or every 24 hours). 
---
That will weed out all the no-lifers who are entering in every tourney and boxing out others who can only play in certain time frames.
---
Probably going to turn into "Delete the deck week", because I have so many codes and keep winning on Wild low ranks right now. XD
---
Honestly not too impressive. There are already very few dragons in Standard, so getting two legendaries isn't very rare
---
Did you type this thinking you wouldn't come off as an asshole?
---
Im hoping for some more Oondasta synergies
---
To defeat Thanos and revert the snap? 
---
So?
---
It's a good place to start, try to look up the deck on hsreplay.net in the "decks" section by searching in the bottom left for all the cards in the deck, once you've found it, sort the deck by mulligan win rate, this should give you an idea of where to start, best of luck!
---
This theory also makes sense for the additional single player content being added. They could use the time travel angle to explain why people can now do extra dungeon run/ rumble run/ Monster Hunt content.
---
i mean if you were gud, you wouldn't have trouble completing your quest
---
people have reached legend without paying a cent, it's not impossible
---
either pay money or play more, this is how it works
---
Haven't played for a while, could someone please explain what's weird about this?
---
In almost every case, if you already have plain versions of the cards, the only reason it would make sense to craft Golden is if you want to play the Golden in Wild.
---
Taking Legendaries as an example, crafting a Golden will cost you 3200. At the rotation, you get 3200 back, and then you can dust it for 1600, so that's your profit. 1600.
---
If you do nothing, you get 1600 back for your plain version. So in both scenarios, you end up with an extra 1600 dust and the plain card, which you can then dust or not, depending on whether you plan to play Wild.
---
This applies to all scenarios where you already have the cards, except for Commons, where there's a slight advantage in creating Goldens. 
---
But u couldn't keep rag heropower when u turn into jaina
---
Is this legal? 
---
This would also tie into the theory that Reno is a bronze Dragon. He may come back to help thwart the plan as one of the good guys in the next expansion. 
---
The hunter has fourteen cards left.
---
Friends are dead and we should all die
---
Is Rafaam better has a priest or mage? I'm thinking mage.  
---
Yeah definitely. My favorite thing about HSreplay is how it shows you the core cards of an archetype. As you are grinding to Legend you will encounter certain playstyles or decks more frequently over a span of ranks at times. You should feel comfortable adjusting tech cards as needed while maintaining the core of the deck. Assuming it all works well for you. Good luck!

I got 5 rank not straining at the beginning of March with deathreatlle hunter. If you have card for it - try it out
---
Done!
---
If anything, Brawls used to be far more likely to require you to build your deck.  And with the Arena format, where you get rewards (Brawlseum) you are no worse off then your typical Brawl and usually better off.  (you still get a minimum of 1 pack).
---
Wild card/players get little love through the year.  I"m glad to have these events from time to time.
---
That's my N'Zoth Reno Mage list. Although most Reno Mage players abandoned deathrattle core, I feel like it is really powerful right now with all the aggro decks swarming high ladder right now. Also if you play on EU, you can add me Aparter #2965 and borrow it to try out.

How is Counter-Strike vanilla still on the list in the recent years?  They have items for Source and GO so those are separate.
---
It works
---
Schedule from this point onward will always be 1-2 weeks before formal release. Release it any earlier than that and everyone figures the meta out within the week and oh this game's boring right on release day.
---
WTF!!! How did you fucking do it?
---
I don't think they should make neutral hero cards. I think he'd be rogue if they did make him a card. 
---
Kobold and Catacombs was a fun take on Dungeon and Dragon. The titles contained was self-explanatory, and gave us lot of information.  Rise of Shadows really doesn't mean much in the context of WoW, or in general. It also sound like some terrible P2W mobile game with its "Rise of" format. 
---
True, usually Maly means you've lost..
---
I've seen some druids who just dump him, and then use Floop within the next couple of turns, so sometimes Maly means "you're dead next turn" which is atleast better..
---
Not by a lot, but it's better
---
Thanks!
---
that\`s a good deal tbh

Blackrock Mountain. One Night at Karazhan

I know, but I think they referred to no new hero for the start of the year. (so no free hero like lunara)
---
I might be wrong tho. 
---
Ugh got the Beast. Free dust I guess?
---
So they will only have one pre-order option this time?
---
Would be great. And then we travel back at get some old cards back like the old gods/ jade stuff

It's weird that the name of the expansion is not translated to French, they always are.
---
Wait, Naxx is out?
---
u wait til they get old and smash them
---
Remember how in past years they announced the expansion and then we had to wait like 2 weeks for the card reveals to start? 
---
Maybe team 5 are trying a new strategy where they feed us teasers for a while and end with the reveal so they can start showing new cards on the very next week
---
Also Raza 0 mana hero power is back.

That's really clever

More "this guy is happy that he wasn't crazy!" "no one cares", but yeah, that was a good time to use that.

---
This new tavern brawl is crazy fun and there doesnt seem to be one specific deck that's too strong.
---
Agree - VoVH is a great name, Rise of Shadows is too generic and kinda cringy.
---
Blizzard: Guys, Magic is making War of the Spark. How do we copy their narrative and build a over-arching story across sets?
---
But how am I able to see how many from each card are in the deck?
---
The Candle has betrayed me!
---
Both strategies suck, but I would honestly say that this one is worse
---
If you're going to tease the expansion, make it more interesting.  Imagine if instead of teasing the characters involved, which a ton of the playerbase could not give a shit about, they teased the legendary card for each villain at the end of the teaser.  It could show the cost, maybe the class if it is class specific, and the art, while holding back the specific text.  That would be at least more interesting than this.

Just Google death bringer saurfang basic deck and you'll get a couple of cheap/free decks for the fight.  Every encounter can pretty easily be done with a free/basic deck up to the Lich King.  Then it gets into a giant RNG fiesta that you have to try a million times to almost win

---
How often do you pull this combo off? 
---
What? Every deck had Mossy and some deck teched in Blood Knights. What more do you want people to do? The card wasn‚Äôt just good it was broken. Would love to hear your arguments against the statistics back then. 
---
Is cheat.
---
This is the first time we've seen him wearing the medallion. He didn't have it in League of Explorers afaik. So there wasn't really anything clueing us in on Rafaam's return besides the leak.
---
I like this idea OP.
---
Rafaam, Togwaggle, Hagatha and Dr. Boom all team up with the fortune teller to travel back and regain their glory. Little do they know, they're being played. They return, reclaim their riches and power, time travel shenanigans happen and the infinite dragonflight appear.
---
Servants of the Old Gods only care about serving / furthering the cause of the Old Gods, so although the four villains have what they seek, the fortune teller has other plans.
---
That and it's convenient Boomsday released Mecha'thun. Maybe the real C'thun isn't happy about it's counterpart.

There are also 2 bodies standing between them in the back, including one blue-chest giant! Prince Malchezaar perhaps?
---
I think it's more like a metal mask. Totally a Doctor Doom reference since Boom is basically a goblin parody of him. 
---
what if its following da rules?
---
Yet no new card have been leaked yet.

I'd have the same look if Rafaam asked me to time-travel to Dalaran with him!

If you have the dust, [[Zillax]] is a pretty safe craft for a Legendary. Pulling up hsreplay stats, Zillax is the most put-in-deck legendary in rank standard in the last 14 days. It doesn't rotate out and is just a solid option all around.

Isn't that great? It's been so hard to type on that damn keyboard. It's so little and my arthritis makes it impossible to use. It's bad enough that I don't understand all the things our little Johnny is posting on his Facebook. What are these me me things? A lot of them are very inappropriate and rude. I think his account was hacked, because our grandson would never post such terrible things, right? He's such a sweet boy. I can't wait to see him graduate from university!

[][][] #FORTNITE  Me and my son have always had an up and down relationship. I think this is due to us not really have much in common, its hard for us to bond. He is a huge fortnight fan, and his mother made him a John Wick costume for Halloween (His favorite skin). He was beyond happy. He really loves Fortnight. I took Halloween as an opportunity to bond with him more, so without him knowing I had his mother make me a fortnight costume to surprise him. I scrolled through google looking at different skins and eventually decided to go as what they call "Rust Lord". The outfit seemed easy to put together and it had a bad ass feel to it. I even researched some of the more popular dances (The Floss, Best Mates, and Orange Justice) I spent hours learning these 3 dances, I don't consider myself all that coordinated but after some time I felt I had them down perfectly. Halloween night came and my son went out trick or treating with his friends. As they were out I put on my costume before handing out candy to the kids. I was surprised with the amount of kids that recognized my costume, I was a hit. Until this group of kids, dressed up as skeletons, I guess they are called skull troopers nowadays? I dont know, looked like skeletons to me. Anyway, what seemed to be the leader of the group didn't seem impressed with my costume, he actually seemed bothered. In a demeaning tone before even getting any candy he asked if I could floss. That smirk on his face turned into full blown surprise as I dropped the bowl of candy, and put every bit of energy into the best floss I could muster up. I nailed it. Surprised but still unimpressed the leader said not bad, but lets see your orange justice. I don't know what came over me but I completely blanked, he caught me off guard despite my hours of preparation. I couldn't let this 10 year old alpha me so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and started flailing around like an inflatable tube man caught in a hurricane. I finished my dance, and silence followed for what seemed to be an eternity. Next thing I know it the group of skeletons erupted into laughter and started jumping left to right while holding their hand in an L shape formation. I was embarrassed, I slammed the door and I kid you not, thought about crying at that very moment. My man hood compromised by a group of young children, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 20 minutes later my doorbell rings, which is strange considering I turned off the porch lights after that embarrassing incident. I turn the light back on, opened the door, and my jaw dropped. a Group of what seemed to be 50+ characters gathered across my lawn all jumping left and right with simultaneously while forming the L shape with their hands. I yelled at the kids, slammed the door and ripped off my costume. What have I done. 30 minutes later my son comes home and I guess word travels quickly in a small community, he already knew what happened. He didn't even make eye contact with me, I tried asking how trick or treating went and he ignored me, went up to his room and slammed the door. He hasn't talked to me since last night and I really don't know what to do.. I don't think he respects me anymore. homer sexual got him  me parents are fuqin nonces they like putting "RULES" on legit everything i wanna get its dumb so for example i buy headphones rules will be put in place for the headphones wanna buy a game they will put rules on that like a couple mins ago i asked for a legit credit card and there like NAH youll have restrictions and im like shut the fuck up youve already put rules on my phone, laptop, most shit i own and i dont even listen to the rules cos there that fucking stupid like one rule for my phone is "dont bring your phone to any place except home and school" like what type of gayass bullshit is that but ofc i dont listen then there like O_O and try to fuck me then i make them realise just how retarded the rules they make are. Basically, frICK my fortnite....d.as.d.   MOMO MOMO MOMO MOMO MOMO TIDE POD MOMO People have been sending me this! Why??? I'm honestly feeling in danger right now... This makes me feel very unsafe. I'm honestly shaking and crying whilst writing this I can hardly hold myself together please kindly tell anyone who post this without a trigger warning to PLEASE add one to keep their followers safe! I had to take a 30 minute breather after seeing this in my camera roll when posting this before I even typed it. Just... Stay safe...  LIGONDESE lmao $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

I've got my eyes on the warrior rush package.  It looks like the strongest most cohesive package in the game when you only include the last three sets and classic.  No firefly? how about this warrior-only 1/2 that draws Zilliax? 
---
1 card a day for a month just isn't enough to retain customers
---
YES!
---
Just play a useless spell then flare.
---
Ah. The low ranks have been pretty casual with only 2 top tier decks being faced so far. I lost to Mind Blast Priest but beat Wall Priest (with his own combo).
---
I play for fun too but I like to take it to ranked so that I can slowly work on golden heroes.
---
The copy doesn‚Äôt. 
---
It's probably very good. Golden monkey was strong and required more setup than this, and it has taunt so you can slam it against an enemy board to defend yourself. That being said, the pool of legendaries now is a lot different than during LoE when Elise was played, so not sure if getting a legendary hand/deck is as strong as back then

Well, Golden Monkey was fairly good. This has potentially better effect and it's easier to use it. 
---
A fine adition to my greedy af reno mage on wild lol.
---
For everyone wishing this was a neutral legendary... All Villians will be class specific, as well as the Heros. 
---
There will be 9 heros or villians, one per class. 
---
What about 30 attack minions? 
---
7 mana is a lot different than 10 mana, but 4/12 is also a lot more difficult to kill than 5/5.
---
Solia also didn't do anything for you if you didn't have a spell in hand. This works in more situations because of the discovered spell.
---
I think Kalecgos is substantially better.
---
If Control Warlock can somehow survive the loss of KFT, this will absolutely be in it.
---
Kalecgos, Coin, Concede.
---
That faceless lackey is going to be summoning so  many doomsayers
---
Yeah its already decent after sitting in your hand for only one turn and it just gets totally ridiculous after that. Good to see that Shaman is getting a good board clear after since Volcano rotates out.
---
That's a nice city... I think I will ***TAKE IT!***
---
They added more than the pre order..
---
[https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22911364](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22911364)
---
There is so much wrong with this. I guess I'll go into detail...
---
There is a gigantic difference between an 8 mana 10/10 and 8 mana summon 5 2/2s. A freaking Holy Nova clears that. It is a terrible, terrible card and no amount of Treant synergy could possibly make it good.
---
There are a ton of Mage spells and you can easily discover a bunch of garbage
---
The Shaman spell is nowhere CLOSE to the power level of Volcano, like it's embarrassing that you would even compare them. If you topdeck Hagatha's Scheme turn 5 you have a freaking 5 mana Arcane Explosion. Like are you serious? It's an AoE that you have to keep during the mulligan to even make remotely worth it. The card is flaming garbage and will never touch a competitive Hearthstone deck. 
---
tl;dr stop trying to summarize cards because you're bad at it
---
Still no fix to the annoying new cards bug. No the card I just disenchanted is NOT new.
---
Looks legit. Happy to see new solo content, hopefully it's closer to dungeon run than the rumble.
---
Twinspell looks.. uninspired? Just not a very exciting mechanic, like Joust. Though I will be curious to see the rest of cards with that mechanic. 
---
$80 for a bundle is too much, with tax that's roughly $270/yr. Too much for any video game IMO.
---
So I went ahead and pre-purchased the 80 pack bundle and then logged into hearthstone and the pre-purchase gave me a golden togwaggle.  This caught me by surprise.  I was assuming the pre-purchase would give me a golden legendary from the new expansion.  What gives?
---
Hah, I can't wait to play more of this brawl tonight because so few people remember my best friend:  Coldlight Oracle.
---
With everyone trying to dig out their combo pieces as quickly as possible [I made a deck to help them get through their deck as fast as possible](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1240491-tears-of-the-combo-mill-rogue)
---
Really, I think this looks both great and original, at least more original than boomsday IMO
---
30 attack minions are one of Priest's core weaknesses.
---
So, they will add more lackeys in coming expansions? Wille the league of evil recuit more members?
---
Fantastic flavor (and pretty good card too)
---
I see Blizzard is sticking to lots of RNG rather than skill based cards. I am disappointed.
---
yeah should be need to figgure out how
---
While we can't fully judge what they're doing to a class based on one card, it sure kind of looks like druid will be a full 100% unplayable for 4 months if they're actually sticking with the Treant horseshit. I can't see them putting in one huge spell for an archetype that receives 0 additional cards.
---
Why would anyone spend 8 mana for a board of 2/2's, let alone do it *twice*? It cannot even be (easily) comboed with SotF either.
---
Yes but if you use the spell that's in your hand already you have one less card in your hand, meaning if you want to include the spell you cast as part of his battlecry you technically discard a card as well.
---
Yeah. That's going to be insane.
---
10 mana 4/12 that also allows you to cast a big fuck off spell right after? 
---
I love the cinematic! 
---
[Ackchyually](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/035/135.png), I think it's a dragon.
---
I'm a big fan of this kind of RNG. I agree that it would have been nice as a neutral, but it'll also be nice having something new to do with Warlock. 
---
So more people buy the $80 pre-order.
---
Cards look underwhelming too.  The new mechanics are once again bland and uninteresting.
---
And without any restrictions too
---
Tempo rogue with chef nomi? After myras that card is nuts
---
That dragon gives you zero mana for first spell every turn? :o
---
Let me put it another way. If I decide to go for L, it never takes me over a 100 games.
---
What an underwhelming way to handle an announcement.
---
I'm glad the other villains were as dumbfounded as I was trying to understand half of what Rafaam was singing about

Playing dragon decks in Shadowverse, I also want a viable dragon deck in HS but this randomness seems very bad.
---
Too bad mate, your preciction failed.
---
Never new Rafaam could sing so well.
---
I've never been a big fan of the "deck speed" argument. There are two decks in any game of hearthstone. Back in GvG when control warrior was a great deck people said it takes to long to reach legend with the deck so everyone just played face hunter. Well, what happens when control warrior queues into face hunter? The game is over in the time it takes to play a face hunter game (5 minutes) and the control warrior typically wins. Really the only time you get a penalty for playing a control deck is when you queue into another control deck, but the whole "deck speed" argument is concluding everyone should play fast decks so this rarely happens.
---
Play the decks you enjoy or are good at. It really doesn't matter all that much from my theorycrafting and experience.
---
But of course the majority of people do believe in deck speed on ladder, so you are right that this does have an effect on the meta of the ladder.

Stickying this here as this is the post that took off, let's get a direct link to the video too on the front page.
---
Oh you're right. It's a lot of what has been announced recently, cool to hear.
---
Laughs in Shadow Word: Death
---
I was thinking about this then realizing how scary it would be to put in odd pally. I think it‚Äôs fine as is being a warlock card and I‚Äôm sure all the other classes will have their own fun legendary. 
---
I would prefer a discount on the $80 bundle and have it not include the hero portrait.
---
Yeah, I was afraid it would work like [[pint-sized summoner]] and [[Duskfallen Aviana]] but looking at it I believe both those cards count as the first minion you played that turn, whereas Kalecgos isn't a spell
---
Calling it now - the Lackey mechanic, + Keleseth rotating out, means Spirit of the Bat could be a key deck mechanic for Warlock. Don't know if that means Hi'Reek will work, but handlock in general will be improved.
---
Makes a lot of sense in Warlock, too, since life tapping is one of Control Warlock's weaknesses in the control matchup.
---
This was the best announcement video ever
---
Prep+Myra's+Chef Nomi= win the game 
---
I‚Äôd be shocked if they give mages a cheap twinspell card.  They skipped them for echo entirely.

---
Mind control it!
---
You can buy them in us shop. It takes a while everytime I buy packs to figure it out again but it's not that hard
---
Rotface, Toki, Face Collector, Prince Liam. Why do they give all classes that legendary effect? It is boring. 
---
Elise, i like your golden monkey mechanic. I think i'll take it!
---
Yeah, it looks like the most powerful card in the expac so far. I could see a big spell mage with Dragoncaller Alanna making moves. 
---
Its an effect we've seen before, I'm not disappointed but I'm not jumping for joy over it either.
---
Orc, goblin, kobold and...? 
---
I'm honestly pretty disappointed that they just made Rafaam a collectible Golden Monkey.
---
Awful, I guess.
---
If your deck is empty, you should have been playing Mecha'thun instead.

---
Rafaam is basically a Golden Monkey for Warlocks, doesnt seem too good for constructed, but is surely gonna be hella fun to play! Also probably a safe pick if this gets into arena. 
---
First new Priest hero AND the first Troll hero.
---
Yeah as badass as Prince Liam and Rotface. Ooo don't forget Face Collector. These cards are the best legendaries.
---
I don‚Äôt know if Arch Villain Rafaam will be viable, but it‚Äôs sure going to be fun.
---
It has a good body and a taunt. It's not that bad statwise
---
Care to share your stats?

You just change the EU in the URL to US
---
Just make sure you don't coin him out. His effect is on the first spell played that turn.
---
No word on this yet. I've seen others report that they received immediate current legendaries too. Even though the release says legandary from the new expansion.
---
Q: Do you want a Pyroblast or Kalecgos in your deck?
---
A: Kalecgos! It could discover anything! Even a Pyroblast!
---
Day 9 was great.
---
Of course but if you played WoW you would know what I meant. 
---
DALARAN HEIST
---
AAAAAH NOMI! I thought I'd escape him after Legion. 
---
Not consistent. It should cost SIX mana.
---
I'm dying to see those videos!
---
It could be one of the hero/antagonist classes too. Mage has Kalecgos as their hero so not them. 
---
Thanks, I've tried to put it as clearly as possible for people who don't like watching long announcements :)
---
I've also combined most of the info into three images in case you guys want to share it somewhere: https://imgur.com/a/gaD4eiC
---
(I forgot to add Legendary cards to the pre-purchase, sorry about that)
---
So 10 mana 4/12 dragon, discovery a spell, free pyro blast to the face? Am I understanding that correctly?  
---
Also, lackey look super fun/good.  I'm pumped!
---
Interestingly does't seem to work I wild. I tried a warrior deck with only War Master Voone, and it added no dragons.
---
The minion who was revealed for rogue is a kobold so...
---
New player here (3 weeks): I've only been playing ranked standard, haven't done any of the solo stuff aside from scooping my DK Legend.
---
Will it be worth it to buy this adventure and play all the way through for the rewards? From the second line in table above, it is suggesting I'd get 44 packs via purchasing (and beating) adventure?
---
No it definitely looks like illegal cards. Literally PvE hero cards from Monster Hunt.
---
I dont understand the people in the thread complaining about the bundle being 80 dollars. People need to stop equating this as just 80 bucks for the hero portrait cause it's not. You get 80 packs, the portrait, AND a golden legendary. To me it's a pretty solid deal .
---
Stop right there criminal scum! You have violated the law!
---
Please revise
---
He wrote "promised" so not 100% certain, but the assumption of that estimation is that you have to be really unlucky to discover 3 garbage spells.
---
Mtga going under honestly. I stuck around for single player content but i just can't sink money in like i used to
---
&gt;Trigger Rules Update - We're updating the rules regarding how Poisonous, Lifesteal, and Overkill keywords work in specific cases, to make cards behave in a more intuitive way.
---
I feel like maybe they should have included *how* these changed....
---
There's the $50 bundle that has basically the same things.
---
Ahhhh, thanks much my friend
---
Good
---
I don't understand.  So it is like echo but only 1x? 
---
I think after Lich King, they'll never do that again.  Lich King had to be strong, you can't disrespect him, but making him neutral just got him included in every slow-ish deck.  If Rafaam was neutral, they'd have to make him shit.
---
Card back is meh
---
Togwaggle as hero card in my opinion because the minion which was revealed for rogue is a kobold
---
Holy shit this looks good. Blizzard bringing back old mechanics and popular characters are big things the community was requesting for a good while. 
---
The prices still feel ways off, but I hope the rest of the card reveals reignite my love for hearthstone.
---
Love the new priest hero portrait, I really wanted her to be a card in WotOG. This is fine too.
---
So you Myra on Turn 5, Nomi on Turn 6, and if they can't clear seven 6/6 minions, you win on Turn 7. Seems balanced. 
---
You can still play flamestrikes in your deck. 
---
You realize you can just....not have an opinion on things you like and spend time doing even though those responsible routinely demonstrate their lack of respect for you or your ability to continue to afford a game that costs $80 every 4 months to stay relevant or an hour a day right?  
---
Or you can take your boot licking submissive consumerism to a website not intended for people to have discussions on. 
---
Most expensive preorder is equivalent of like 2-3 hours of work where I live lol, it's such a good deal. 80 packs will get you quite a few decks (espec with all the dust from old cards rotating out)
---
The extra hero is just icing on the cake!
---
Why wasn‚Äôt this datamined?
---
I believe that's incorrect
---
How can you say it turns into a control deck, it could turn into anything?
---
Why?
---
Since Doomguard is gone I'm having my doubts about Zoo surviving.
---
I got a reply to this: should be fine once shop is back up but if not should submit a ticket. Either way we will get our packs etc.
---
He's a pretty awful card. On average he'll just die on your opponent's turn, so you get to use 1 spell for free and your turn's done.
---
Finally the counter to Rin we have been waiting for.
---
Schema looks to be a theme so expect other cards that are similar.
---
I will have around 3500 gold and ~10k dust.  Is it possible to aquire most of the cards without spending more then 50$
---
Jesus Christ, take the stick out of your ass.
---
not sure if out yet on mobile, usually lags behind pc
---
I know that, I'm just referring to the card itself if you were to drop it on turn 10 without the coin.
---
"supre"
---
It only draws ¬Ω a card on average.
---
Echo cards disappear at the end of your turn, but with twinspell, the 2nd copy stays in ur hand until you play/discard it. 
---
Tess always says "You have no idea what I'm capable of!" I guess with having her hero card played in ranked..  She wasn't wrong lol

Yes.

And "us" (as in significant part of the playerbase) will pay that.

Relax, you get to enjoy the new expansion and fresh meta in the meantime, and when the meta starts to settle a bit then BAM you can check out the new solo content.

I hope the hero card is one of the good guys from Dalaran, considering we'll be seeing these villains throughout the entire year of the dragon. 
---
Happened to me as well. I managed to update it on my PC but the Update on mobile is not there yet. I guess we have to wait. 
---
Are the cards in your collection?
---
shockedpikachu.jpg
---
This chart is really only if you totally plan on buying the adventure regardless and want to know if you should use gold or cash.  In my main post I put the assumptions that you have 2800 gold that you will either use to buy packs or the adventure.
---
Case #1 is the baseline at an equivalent of 16 packs (that's 12 from the new expansion + 1 golden classic pack that has the equivalent of 4 packs of dust).  Case #2 is you bought the adventure with cash and spend the 2800 gold on packs (28 from gold + 16 from adventure).
---
If you are on the fence about even buying the adventure, I'd treat it as 16 packs.
---
There won't be one. They answered this in last week's AMA.
---
still the same basic boring shit. this will be my 1st expansion i pre-purchase most likely :/
---
No, the card sucks.

Pls god no

---
When net decking with deck codes becomes too confusing for new players 
---
I think it will be good but I don't think it will be *that* strong.  I might be remembering wrong but the Mage Legendary from Gadgetzan had a similar (albeit one time only) effect and I don't remember it being oppressive even with 10 mana Kazakus spells.
---
10 mana cards have some powerful effect to be worth the mana investment.
---
\[\[Void Contract\]\]
---
Well more are gonna be added as well in future expansions they said.
---
So seeing as we know we're delveing deep and meeting old villians, I'd wager a Ragnaros Lacky at some point too.
---
Where is my tyrande
---
YES PLEASE
---
Specially considering we have Old God representation with Madame Lazuli. 
---
If not now, then I hope we get a Naga expansion sometime soon

8/-/- | Destroy half of each player's deck.  
---
Yes Ragnaros and Crystalsmith
---
Can‚Äôt wait for a Burn Mage to smash me with a zero mana Pyroblast! 
---
I made this and posted it before I went to work and the announcement.  So, I had to try and cover every scenario possible.  I am currently at work and can't go through making all the changes to update it with the new information.
---
"You have no idea what I'm capable of!" Turns out she wasn't lying after all lol
---
Kalecgos is low-key a warrior buff
---
Turns out you weren't a very good teacher.
---
Coin + Kalecgos = Rank 1 legend
---
That's a weird way to say THE MIGHTY MILLHOUSE MANASTORM. 
---
Just like \[\[Unstable Evolution\]\] was a test for echo I guess
---
priests are known for playing with minds and manipulation
---
Lackeys are basically a callback to spare parts from GvG
---
Thanks Captain Obvious I mean Captain Clam.
---
That's quite a leap you've made
---
**Release Date:** April 9, 2019
---
Then Hearthstone isn't the game for you. Go try something different or else you're gonna be stuck playing something you don't like.
---
This is a more tempo/impact-oriented card than Ysera, with the *potential* of later value. Ysera has 0 impact when she hits the board, she is a very slow card that can potentially give you a tn of value...that is IF she doesn¬¥t get removed (very likely). 
---
This has *guaranteed* value. Against a control deck, you still get a free spell (and discover). Against a midrange deck, you can swing the board. It just has more uses than Ysera, while having less potential infinite value.

---
1/-/- | Transform a friendly minion into one that costs (1) more. Repeatable this turn.  
---
I understand the confusion, which I hoped my post with assumptions would avoid.  But I was in a hurry and had to get to work and couldn't go more in depth.
---
Really like most of what Im seeing here, but uffffff 80 bucks for the hero :( 
---
Im not against spending money for HS but normaly I only drop like 50ish per expansion and this time the single played content has to be bought aswell.
---
The most exciting part of this so far, is that they already said that MORE Lackeys will be added as we continue through the year. So we have 5 now, but could have 7 to 20 before the end of the year.
---
If people wanted last years packs they would have probably gotten them by now.
---
Having a month of just the last 3 expansions would probably drive a lot of people to buy packs from those sets that were overshadowed by the year before just in time for the new xpac to come out after everyone spent their gold and dust competing in the temporary new meta.
---
It's a bug, you get literally ANY legendary on purchase, including from brawls, tokens, adventures, etc.
---
 Pretty sure it'll get clapped soon so I'd dust it before they clean them out of accounts.
---
Well bear in mind that this card shouldn‚Äôt be evaluated in a vacuum; it‚Äôs probable that you‚Äôd be building your deck in such a way to complement it. So you could just be hanging on to the flamestrike that you had in your deck to begin with, and then play whatever card you discover later on.
---
It's now a $80 pre-purchase. Oh and you no longer get a free legendary at the start of the expansion, you've got to buy that. And no free hero, you've got to buy that. And no free solo content, you've got to buy that. I think I'm sensing a trend here...
---
ahh yes the good ol 10 mana 4/12 dragon with battlecry: deal 10 damage to your opponent for lethal.
---
They should have made him a free legendary that you can not disenchant. Missed opportunity.
---
(Cause the guy would pursue your alts to the edge of the universe, until you satisfy him, this is the most persistent panda ever.)
---
Depends how you look at it. 
---
* 1 pack = 100 dust
---
* 1 pack = $1.495
---
* Average packs to open a legendary = 20
---
If you disenchant your golden legendary from the bundle, you get 1600 dust. Which is $23.92.
---
Youre cute 
---
They are going to have to make up for it with creative spells. But yeah, it is not super interesting at face value.
---
These single player content leaks are hilarious. 
---
Maybe next expansion will be the opposite of this one, introducing 4 villains and 5 heroes, having one for each class for the final confrontation
---
Noice, thanks for update.  So we'll get Rise of Shadows legendary once it's fixed today?
---
False.
---
It's the exact opposite of the perfect Neutral Legendary. It would end up in almost every control and midrange, maybe even aggro decks. I doubt it would be too strong, just a card you would see way too often (see Sylvannas, Ragnaros, Lich King).
---
&gt; Imo needs to work for the other player too. Or not take effect until your next turn. 4/12 discover a free spell in one turn is too much.
---
Nope.
---
Glad that Mage is getting a great legendary instead of Flame Leviathan.
---
This card seems terrible. Everybody hyping it up in the comments here but it‚Äôs unreliable even in arena. You‚Äôd need to get usable legendaries in your hand which supplement your tempo but realistically playing this card is suicide like golden monkey is 80% of the time. They will probably reveal other cards which could make Rafaam amazing but off of what we know right now this just looks like a garbage card with the exception of lucky arena tempo plays.
---
You get a normal legendary with the first bundle, so it's more like $18 benefit over the alternative.
---
phew, good.
---
Changes lile this or Deathstalker Rexxar getting access to KnC beases should not take an entire expansion to complete. It's simply facepalm-inducing!
---
‚ÄúWell played‚Äù
---
*Double espionage woosh*
---
FYI I won that game on a disgusting topdeck Fireball (on topdeck mode) while he had 5HP.
---
And yes, I do feel sorry for that guy x)
---
Sure that could happen, but you can still just play AOE from your hand in that case. The possibility to discover a free AOE just adds some consistency to the card and potentially gives you extra removal in matchups where you need it.
---
Kind of sad that Rafaam didn't get to be a hero card.
---
You could just not buy the solo content. Unlike before, it doesn't have any exclusive cards that can only be accessed by purchasing it. But if you really enjoy the solo content, it sounds like they've fleshed it out well beyond what we got over the last year or so to make it a legitimate mode unto itself. I wouldn't base the value purely on the rewards.
---
are you missing some of the cards I have?
---
f2p best value for money \o/
---
It's certainly a good value card no matter but I just think you're overestimating it's ability to stick to the board.
---
Nice.
---
No, it tells you that it'll be replaved with a normal quest.
---
Minus 4 deckslots for you!
---
Well, it wouldn‚Äôt be a combo deck, would it? It‚Äôs not direct damage and is vulnerable to removal.
---
Most likely ‚ÄúNomi rogue‚Äù will be the usual tempo/aggro rogue with Nomi as an alternate wincon against anti-aggro decks
---
sneaky edits*
---
Add them back! 
---
"Secondly, if you think that cards are the worthless part of the game and the real chase are the cosmetics, then that, if anything, is fuckin' bonkers."
---
I didn't say the real chase is the cosmetics. I said it's not a competitive game [because it's not anymore and I'm not going to take the time to explain how a game can be 1v1 without actually being competitive, plenty of pro players have already done that, just google it] and playing for fun is the only reason I play. To this end, I like cosmetics because they allow me to have more fun. 
---
Nerfing cards is a bad thing, it means you made a mistake.
---
"Hundreds of games have preorder bonuses."
---
Again, an entire library of articles and op-eds on why this is bad exist, just google it. 
---
Why are you talking about golden cards? 
---
You don't have to understand the parts of my argument you don't agree with, it's not my argument. Other, more credible people have said all of this and I agree with them.
---
i mean the entire point of this brawl is to pull of whacky OTKs
---
What you are saying is true but im using my average game lengths.  So regardless of matchup thats my time per game. 
---
Ha, I got that reference
---
Yeah just blizzard right after it, or counterspell, depending
---
I mean, what‚Äôs insane about it? It‚Äôs working exactly as they described it would... inputting the highest win rate deck based on your card selection. Very cool update, though. I‚Äôm looking forward to auto-complete with some trash cards. 
---
Yeah and it's already run in competitive priest decks so it's perfect
---
Spellward Jeweler is a fantastic card. 3/3/4, so on curve stats, and it has an effect that can be game changing with the right timing, but doesn't completely win the game outright by destroying combos. Wonderful card. Looking forward to drafting many in arena. 
---
Try wild. Same cards each time..
---
I noticed. I've been part of Hearthstone since it's beginnings and seeing how much it has changed shows.
---
I'd go further, unlike those fun meme cards Rafaam is actually good.  Think of all those control mirrors where you sit on removal and early defense, turning those into lategame threats while being a good body on his own is wonderful.
---
Like Kibler has been chanting recently, If we move away from the ridiculous infinite value lategames of current deathknight standard, cards that bring a lot of finite value become much better.
---
What a joke 
---
I'm skeptical about Inspire (Genn and Baku rotated because of hero power centric gameplay and Inspire was kinda a boring mechanic) but I think we'll be definitely have some Echo cards back into the menu.
---
This would be a mistake as a neutral. No way that a majority of midrange to late game decks wouldn't run it. 
---
One new keyword that is almost exactly like an older keyword and no real new changes. Least hyped expansion so far for me. Sorry.
---
&gt;They went from being 10$ (Medivh and the like) to being slammed behind an 80$ pay wall.
---
"Pay wall" argument right on cue. Never any mention of the *thirty* additional packs and golden legendary. It's crazy how triggering hero skins are in this community.
---
Nope.  Way too expensive.
---
My bad, meant Sindragosa.
---
Badass Arms Fold
---
Interject perhaps?
---
the one i posted only difference is - 1 egg, + 1 sense demons
---

2/1/3 | Battlecry: If you're holding a Dragon, Discover a Dragon.  
---
Thanks buddy, you're the real here here!
---
The mechanic is rather dull and this card is so heinously awful, I cannot wrap my head around it. Especially with the state of druid now and especially post rotation, if this is what passes as exciting new archetypes, I know I won't be spending a nickel. They've tried for 3 fucking expansions already to push treant and all it's done is waste what could have been useful cards for the class. This will be 4 consecutive expansions of treant cards, all of which are beyond useless.

Felt that way for RR. First time I didn't preorder since Old Gods bc I didnt like the direction the game was going and they offered a cosmetic instead of in game content like a golden legendary.  I think these two bundles are fine for people who want to spend money. Thinking about preordering again if we get an exciting, impactful set but more important to me was that theyve demonstrated a willingness to correct unhealthy/stale metas (two balance updates last expansion and getting rid of Genn and Baku early). 
---
You still can with golden rafaam!
---
&gt;" value for packs " How valuable are those packs when Blizz can just decide that a card they designed, play tested and printed is still broken so they take it out of standard?"
---
If they rotate a card early I get full dust refund which means I got to play with the broken card AND get full refund since it was deemed to be broken. Same if they nerf something I get a full refund for disenchanting if I deem the card to not be worth having anymore. 
---
Sure I'd rather have everything perfectly balanced from the get go but most games have to have either balance patches or banned and restricted lists like in MTG or Yu Gi Oh.
---
Also important to point out is the fact that this is the first set of the year and will be in standard for the longest amount of time. This to me is why I am more willing to spend more at this point in time to have a wider pool of cards to play with for the next 2 years rather than 1.5 for summer sets or even less in the case of the winter expansions.
---
&gt;"Reward for spending more"- Exclusivity culture, might as well just be a big $ sign instead of a hero portrait, I would be embarrassed to play with an $80 skin, personally. Whenever I see Rhastakhan I cringe a little knowing it's a $50 bill sitting there. Enjoy the game, love the game, play it all the time, whatever- it's an exorbitant amount of money for a cosmetic.
---
More than likely that person didnt buy the preorder for Rhastakhan but for the 50 dollars for 50 packs. I personally didnt buy and pre orders for Rhastakhan due to not playing much at the time.
---
That was my intention as well; right now I just get clobbered, but at least from what I‚Äôve seen *A LOT* of the cards I‚Äôm losing against are going to be rotated out soon...
---
I‚Äôm going to give it a try after the new set comes out and let‚Äôs see what happens...
---
Thanks for the insight anyway! =)
---
This is OP IMO
---
&gt; If Big Bad Voodoo's effect triggers on a minion that doesn't have any valid minions to evolve into, it will now summon a random minion of equal cost.
---
No new 11-drop in this set confirmed?
---
Potentially strong with Shirvallah.
---
Depends on how much you value the content itself, not just the rewards. If you're only in it for the packs and Zayle, it's probably not a good gold investment. But if you really enjoy solo content, I imagine it'll be worthwhile considering the improvements they're making.
---
Pretty good is an understatement imo. The only time it‚Äôs not great is if you low roll all your discoveries.
---
But still a 4/12 discover a spell free spell every turn is really good.
---
I threw in Sindragosa in a Mage deck, and it gave me a Big Spell/Control deck that was really fun!

Out of the cards in your collection, yeah.

No, it isn‚Äôt. Cash is worth more than gold, and you get most value for your money spending cash on the adventure and gold on more packs.

---
Somehow the best Warlock deck is Cubelock with one Cheaty Anklebiter (without any Corpsetaker for the synergy). I wonder if the ping and occasionally setting up better defiles is really worth a card slot.
---
Of course this list is dependent on the state of my collection but I think I have all Standard cards that are playable in Cubelock (even fringe synergy like Ectomancy) so don't think that's the reason why.

---
But think of all the Shudderwocks you can have...
---
That's Aggro Kingsbane, which IS a pirate deck, but mainly a weapon buff deck. It just happens to use a bunch of pirates and throw in ship's cannon.
---
I think a lot of pirate enthusiasts are looking for something more thematic, where the win condition is the pirates themselves, not some unrelated legendary weapon.

Why though? It's basically an auto-netdeck feature. You could have been looking up decks online for years

This is such a pedantic argument.

Players have a limited number of discounted packs they can purchase. Getting the larger amount comes with additional content. His point is blatantly obvious. Arguing semantics doesn't somehow diminish the fact that more content is offered on top of additional discounted content.

"I can't see very well while hiding in this barrel of dynamite. I wonder if lighting this torch would help me see better?"

I hope not, but most likely will. Maybe if there was a cap on the spell (for example "damage cant be higher than 5) then the spells would be cheaper (or maybe there is a cap, just havent seen it anywhere. Its cool idea, but very badly executed.
---
My take on this type of card:
---
Hunter beast 2mana 1/2 beast: summon "Summon *0* more copies of this card" (Upgrades each turn! Maximum upgrades: 2)
---
Do they keep what they got incorrectly? I would hope not as that's a pretty big boon purely for those that got in early or live in the correct time zone.  
---
The power they have when held in your hand long enough might outweigh the downsides of drawing them late.
---
You're only looking at the worst possible scenario, when the best possible scenario might be weighted much heavier.

Yeah, because heal zoo with one dead card is still better than discard-lock, at least by the stats.  Maybe if you add a few synergy cards it my give you a really discard deck.

One more step towards the never dying shudderwock deck. 
---
I don't think you understand their point. Yes, you have to pay the dust now, but you will get it back upon rotation, thus making the total net cost 0 dust, aka free.
---
You do realize how MASSIVE of a task that would be right?
---
Not to mention that data probably is not stored anywhere, so what do you expect them to pull from?
---
I mean spellstones are similar in that they aren‚Äôt great to topdeck you‚Äôd rather have them in your hand to be upgraded. That being said, these take a while to charge up before they are good it seems as of right now unlike spellstones where you can play cards in the same turn to upgrade them. I think there‚Äôs a possibility of them seeing niche play but I believe only the next cards if they‚Äôre better than Hagatha‚Äôs scheme. Regardless it‚Äôll be interesting to see what effects the other cards have.
---
I wanted to see it build a control paladin, so started with 4 card: Thekal, Tirion, Tarim, and Shirvallah. It filled the rest of the deck with garbage cards from the classic set. Weird.

---
Nozdormu was my first legendary. My second was Gahz'rilla. I'm still in therapy.
---
I wonder if they don't have enough wild games, or if the decks in wild are just too random for them to get something coherent.  Or maybe they just didn't run the data for wild.
---
First thing I noticed: too percentage odd pally and zoolock don't run their respective fringe legendaries (prince Liam and the soularium), even though many big data bases think tanks such as VS suggest these. Interesting.
---
Another interesting thing I got was that (at least on EU) the highest winrate Rogue deck is miracle that runs gadgetzan.
---
Best warrior was quest warrior and best priest was wall priest. Nothing unusual for other classes, as far as I remember. 
---
i understand the point. but "have the dust to craft something" is far from free
---
Is this only on PC? Seems not to be live on mobile yet.
---
another weird thing:
---
i was selecting zoolock cards, and it made the heal zoo deck with no 2 drops and no keleseth (i dont own it)
---
He was around in MoP, but it required a hell of a cooking grind to unlock him so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you didn‚Äôt see him. 
---
We taught him how to cook, it might say more about the players that he keeps fucking us up. 
---
&gt; I've thought about it, genn and Baku have been in control decks, are terrible topdecks but have seen play.
---
Playing a 6 mana 6/5 or a 9 mana 7/8 isn't terrible though.
---
It's not comparable to a 5 mana, 1 damage AOE.
---
Was this on a computer? HS on my phone still makes some... interesting autocompleted decisions.
---
I expect they'll lean more on ability words rather than actual keywords. Stuff like Joust and cycle mechanics like spellstones, Omega cards, the Worgen mechanic, etc.
---
Not anymore they're not. They used to be, and that's why Elise was played, but you won't see her anywhere in Wild because the average legend is much smaller these days.
---
When League of Explorers was released, Sir Finley was literally the only 1-mana legendary minion *in the game*, and people were pretty damn hyped to see him in large part because we were interested to see them start making smaller legendary creatures with interesting effects. These days, you've got cards like Patches, Kelseth, Zentimo, etc, small minions that are very powerful in the decks built for them but serve no purpose whatsoever in the kind of situation Elise's effect is strong in. It's not that these minions are bad, it's that they're bad when you get them super lategame when two control/midrange decks are duking it out, the main purpose of playing Elise. Filling your deck with Gruul's and Boogeymonsters is one thing, filling it with a bunch of tiny 2/2 and 1/3 legends is something else entirely, and these days there are way too many of those in the legend pool for the card to be effective.

Hey Thebestthom, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
It doesnt seem to work in wild tho. In standard it made great decks for me but in wild it made crappy ones
---
0 dust is free. Don't really know what else to say.
---
I hope Mage gets a good board clear with Twinspell.
---
You could also play Hakkar and transform all the blood cards in your deck into legendaries.
---
You're assuming that aggro decks and control decks get paired together, which isn't the case. If you get stuck in a control v control match up you'll be spending 30+ minutes in a game. 
---
And even an aggro v control matchup wouldn't be as fast as your average aggro v aggro match up. 
---
&gt;The only time you get punished is in the mirror which didn't happen all that often because the perception is you must play face hunter to get fast ranks. 
---
Exactly. This is aggro getting an unfair bump just for ladder. 
---
So then the most expensive tier is $0.73 ($150/206). If one of the legendaries is golden, it goes down to $0.68 ($150/222) which isn't that bad.
---
Does anyone know if i can buy the pre purchase bundle with a Google play gift card?
---
Looking forward to the Rogue one, please let it be decent, I know prep is a thing but please blizzard don‚Äôt give us some garbage

---
Nope, they used to sell it at 700 gold per wing, or $20/$25 for entire adventure. Difference being that back then it was required to buy the pve content to get the cards. Now it‚Äôs only required if you want to play the content. Once it drops you can decide if it‚Äôs enjoyable enough to buy, or simply save up gold. You might value it solely based on what you get from it, but others will value how much entertainment they got from the content. 
---
The opposite for me. For the first time I'm not feeling the theme at all...
---
Oh yeah, or that!
---
For some reason I thought the new deck builder was included in the last patch but hadn‚Äôt been ‚Äúturned on‚Äù yet.
---
lmao
---
Ah that would explain it, MoP is the expansion that I took a prolonged break through. 
---
It's not smart. It just picks high winrate decks with your selected cards in them and autofills. It doesnt "build around".
---
They didn't change [[Chillmaw]] after they added [[Sindragosa]] proper, so I doubt they would do it for a card that's even more recognizable in Maly.
---
As someone who has been winning a lot with Cubelock recently. Recruit is a mechanic that should stay in the past.

I got a Nefarian and Skull of the Man'ari, will I keep the skull and get a RoS legendary to replace it? Or do I lose the skull?
---
I don't remember actually. I feel like it was a free legendary. It was in the recent AMA.
---
Even if I add 10 discard synergies and autocomplete, it'll make heal zoo.
---
It's cosmetic content that people really like but some likely can't justify spending money on if it doesn't come with any practical content. It just makes sense for Blizzard to sell them this way and it's clearly working. I get that some people cannot justify spending that much money on an expansion and feel bad they can't get the skins, especially when it's a character they really like, but it just seems unreasonable to get bent out of shape about it the way some people are.
---
Interesting. The algorithm probably knows that Keleseth + other 2 drops devalues Keleseth massively, but it does *not* know why not having any 2 drops in a deck is good to begin with. So it does not know that a Keleseth deck without Keleseth is a lot worse on average.
---
The articles references a start date of April 9th is that a legit leak and mistake of the forbes article? Or, possibly just a guess of rough launch date
---
If Control Warrior is a thing after rotation, I almost guarantee that it will play Weapons Project. 
---
Seems the patch is not live for mobile yet.

I just think it's naive for people to look at a bundle and think "I'm getting free stuff". I think it's dumb for people to say "you're getting free stuff when you spend money, why are you complaining?". All of last years $50 bundles had better "free stuff", but we're still getting "free stuff" so we should just not complain about getting less "free stuff".

1/1/1 | Battlecry: Deal 2 damage.  
---
lol i feel stupid now \^\^
---
so if you alrdy own 2 copies of those cards + both legi, it makes no sense to craft the golden versions at all?
---
but what if you don't own them yet? golden baku/genn would net you a free legendary?
---
If it matches up with class than:
---
Warrior: Dr. Boom
---
Rogue: Togwaggle
---
Shaman: Hagatha
---
Priest: Lazul
---
Warlock: Rafaam
---
Im guessing Rafaam is the golden monkey callback.
---
&gt; The exact difference in this case is pointless.
---
Except in the case of, you know, facts, and reality, 
---
I mean it's definitely gonna be annoying when going vs Shaman as an aggro deck and thinking to yourself 'do i play this or do i just not in case he can do 5+ dmg board wipe, twice'. This meta seems like it could be more control orientated from what we've seen so far
---
If people weren't getting what they paid for and that was fixed please tell what did the fix give them?
---
Well ya, that's because people don't care about going full try hard mode in the dumpster legend. They can just play for fun without worrying about rank 
---
Probably because they want to keep in mind Soul of the Forest.
---
Don't want to give Druid too many ways to build a board that's hard to deal with. If it was 7 mana they could always innervate or biology project a soul of the forest out with it.
---
With Druid having Whispering Woods + This they actually go up in token generators even with losing Living Mana. 
---
What a fucking awful legendary. So boring. All those discard cards get no lego synergy. Sigh. 
---
/woooosh on me. Still don't think he makes sense in a class tho. 
---
Ok. Let's see it this card is played.
---
!RemindMe 3 months
---
ehh...just got Grand Archivist and spiteful in a druid standard deck with extactly 1 spell(3mana) so.. yeah.
---
iPad counts as mobile
---
C'Thun and Handbuff are too specific and Handbuff is already back
---
I would have totally done this by accident...
---
Dinec#1419 Trade 80g friend quest
---
No that would be something entirely different, because the average non legendary minion would have better stats and on average better effects.
---
And you lose every spell which is another big downside. You aint gonna win by slamming down big stuff that often does nothingwhile your opponent gets tempo by playing removal + board development.

Only supporting one half of the game? Typical blizzard idiots. 
---
No real downside? It costs 10 mana in a class with no ramp. Now that downside might end up not mattering, but let's not act like 10 mana is nothing. 
---
The fuck are you snorting, mate.
---
Cards with symmetrical effects, like \[\[Biology Project\]\]
---
So incredible boring. 
---
In regard to skull, I think it's a bit different.  Skull was strong because it cheated out things on multiple turns. Nomi doesn't really cheat anything, other than vomitting a bunch of stats on the board one time. 
---
Plus, decks love to run board clears already regardless if this area play or not. The issue with ooze is it's a dead card if they don't run weapons, but basically every deck runs minions so board clears are always relevant and desired.
---
I still don't see how it's different from just removing the worst card from a good deck or just searching for decks that contain a card on hsreplay or any other website. I guess removing the worst card is a new feature since you don't have to do it yourself? But you could have always just looked at card winrates.
---
I hardly think they'll bring back **Keyword** cards from previous expansions as they said too many keywords can be too confusing.
---
Are there any other signature cards without keywords form old expansions, like this one?
---
You need spells, draw, heal (warlock,rogue), and removal in a decent arena draft. Replacing all your cards for drops that aren't guaranteed to have much impact or be cohesive with the rest of your deck at all does not make for a good arena card, unless you're against the ropes already and have no better option.

1/-/- | Each player gains 2 Mana Crystals.

This is absolutely untrue, as other have said. The control warrior mirrors were dictated by who kept track of opposing threats and saved removal/planned for fatigue (e.g. chose NOT to draw with slam/did not use shield block), not racing to spam monkey. Monkey was used very very late game once every removal piece was used/as a Hail Mary attempt if removal was forced on suboptimal targets such as shieldmaiden, etc. 
---
This is some great communication! thx
---
Idk if they edited it, but it says *WEEK OF* March 25 and April 1.
---
Good point. People might also be hesitant to invest as heavily in third expansions since they're in Standard for less time.
---
Welcome to CCGs. It's also pretty likely that there will be cards used from Year of the Raven after rotation that weren't used before,  and you might already have them.  
---
Also Zoolock never really goes away either,  even if it loses 90% of its cards it can easily find replacements. There's a reason it's been around since beta.

It will definitely see play but it will just be a meme card.

r/FuckDruid
---
Dude, kalecgos+blizzard is almost always going to be a great stabilising play.
---
Magic, of course
---
As one of the people that instantly bought the pre-orders and got said "incorrect legendaries", do we still get to keep those? Or are they going to be removed or something? Thanks for the fix too. :)
---
Discover a spell that can then be free is a pretty big deal. Flamestrike, Blizzard, Pyroblast, Luna's pocket galaxy... Solia also has a huge limitation.
---
Kalecgos is awesome and I expect to see it in practically every Mage control deck, possibly even midrange decks.
---
Old Gods - Forbidden
---
GvG - RNG Fiesta cards
---
KnC - Spellstones
---
Witchwood - Worgens
---
"Most"? The only I can think of in standard are phoenixes, which is just one in a myriad of decks that do make use of that mechanic. Am I missing something from modern or?
---
&gt;No that would be something entirely different, because the average non legendary minion would have better stats and on average better effects.
---
I am not so sure the difference is that huge in average. Besides many legendaries do have useful effects.
---
&gt;You aint gonna win by slamming down big stuff 
---
If the game went past turn 8 in arena you will ABSOLUTELY win by slamming down huge stuff every turn.
---
So what are the results with meme cards?
---
Guess you can even make the minion cost 1 with a mage spell. 
---
Priest is a skin, not hero card.
---
He would totally make the cut in today‚Äôs meta.
---
and chicken and angry chicken
---
It's extremely situational though, and doesn't even answer most combos.
---
I really hope druids don't find a way to get this card...
---
That Nightblade gave me a good chuckle.
---
You criticized me for arguing that it's not free. You said that I could've instead argued that to certain people the value of this bundle would be lower because of personal preference. Before that you said that the OP of this chain merely "viewed it as free stuff" implying that he was merely giving his view on the matter, when in reality he bashed OP for complaining about getting free stuff. When he did it it's fine, because you're part of the same circle jerk. When I do it it's wrong, because I'm not part of the circle jerk.
---
I play Myra‚Äôs into Faldorei quite often in Myracle rogue and go for the win with a board of 4/4s. I think this is legit too. Without Cold Blood you don‚Äôt have so much burst anymore, especially vs Control decks that are more defensive
---
Yeah but priest has an answer for 4 now.
---
You do not know the lengths I will go to for value
---
I you're low spending or F2P player, Wild is much frendlier place, things chance less there and you get to play with all of your cards forever. It's much more fun too IMO.
---
r/wildhearthstone
---
Mages can generate heaps of value if they have time.
---
Togwaggle's thinking: *You need ~~Jesus~~ Candle!*
---
Those are directly from the witchwood single player, one hundred percent will not be included and is very clearly a glitch
---
I too like to watch shamans wiff heavy.
---
I love the idea, the only problem is that only 3 classes will have hero cards, 3 classes will have huge advantage against the other 6. 
---
Lol that card will see no play, this is the same reaction as that 6 mana 5/5 Druid beast copy card that saw zero play, 100000% overreaction
---
The one you've linked seems more like a discussion piece as opposed to a low effort post with a  meme though?  
---
Imo the post you've made breaches the rules and they are right in removing them but then there is also posts that don't get removed that are equally breaking the rules but it seems once something gets a few upvotes, it stays.  
---
Try posting at a time of day when there are less mods, once you have the upvotes you'll be golden heh.  
---
Lol, the most shameful. I did lose a game because I nerubian unravelered and then tried to coin 2 drop on 7 mana. 
---
I keep getting told I am disconnected from Hearthstone and to restart whenever I click complete my deck. Anyone else?
---
Despite rules it may have, Duplicates are too hard for it to handle. I made a warlock deck with only reno, and the other 28 cards were mostly dupes.
---
This one had some top visuals though.
---
Wall priest does really good in this expansion
---
I know its a throw back to the original but this is still quite possibly the laziest designed card Ive ever seen.  The rest of the set better have some interesting stuff if this is what theyre showing first.
---
"OoOh I can't wait to play as the evil Jamaican voodoo lady"
---
Seems to be coming into Android now finally. 
---
Not strong against priests.
---
I created a deck with just Moorabi and it bricked my phone!
---
I did get Nomi, but then lost the will to live trying to train him. You could only do one quest a day with him! Maybe this is why he burns my food...
---
Oh ok.
---
You said that he who plays it first, wins. You changed it to he who draws it first, wins.
---
You lied when you said you always said the latter and not the former.  Chuck in calling me a cunt, and you are a coward and you have the trifecta for a shit troll.
---
I honestly have no idea how grinder mages with these slow cards will be able to survive without ice block or jaina. They will either get some broken life gain cards this expansion or this is gonna be as dead as Hex Lord Malacrap. 
---
I had 355‚Äôish upvotes in like two hours....do you mean more than that? 
---

---
I'd have to disagree. It'd trash out of the gate. It's comparable to Ysera in that the stat line is the same and it "discovers" from a pool of preset cards. Albeit not a great example. My point is, Ysera is tricky to play because you're unable to directly respond to the previous player's turn and board state; in essence, it's a multi-turn powerplay that leaves you vulnerable and answers very little. Now, with that being relayed, Kalcy does generate a discovery... but with mage's spell pool and the variance factored in with that, the likelihood of the spell being ideal or even useful is slimmer than the hype train here would lead you to believe.
---
A niche card at best in greedy whale decks, little viability in competitive play. 
---
2 out of 5 ice cold milks. 
---
Not strictly, part of the benefit is adding a card to your deck
---
&gt; Barnes Mage
---
First of all, r/whoosh
---
Second of all, It's a joke that Stonehill is commonly seen with Paladin, and it always seems to discover Tarim, Tirion, Lich King, or in some cases all three.
---
I played against you, I'm Forkbeard in the pics (I know - midrange Hunter, gross). I didn't know about the pre-purchase kerfuffle and to say I was baffled when I saw you throw down Darius would be an understatement.
---
You won‚Äôt just be facing control though, what I‚Äôm saying is this card impacts the board because it acts as a pseudo board clear. Discover a spell in mage means more often than not discovering a board clear. That‚Äôs tempo. 4/12 with soft taunt is also tempo. Then if it survives, it‚Äôs value. You can play another high cost spell to stabilize or remove something and then play another win condition.
---
It‚Äôs tempo, value and card generation in one card. That‚Äôs valuable. It‚Äôs expensive though and that‚Äôs why it would require the correct deck to function. It enables your other win conditions, like a lesser UI 
---
Quick add timey Wimey prefixes to every card! ‚ÄúGreater Temporal Bladestorm‚Äù ‚ÄúTime Gamon‚Äù

Scam is the wrong word but you have a point on inconsistent pricing.  
---
I guess it's just too much effort for them to do anything about it.  
---
As always if you don't like it don't support it?  
---
You're trying to argue that you have 65% winrate without actual stats? LOL
---
You‚Äôre right I made a mistake. I admitted to it. In my head they both were he same. You were an outright cunt to me. Please disagre? Now I‚Äôm a coward for what admitting my mistakes. Man you have issues. I‚Äôm done with this. Get some help
---

Since the update I can‚Äôt seem to play HS on my iPhone X. I logged myself out by playing on my pc, then when I went to switch back, it stops on the launch screen telling me to update the latest version, but there is no later version. I have tried force closing the app, restarting my phone, and reinstalling the application altogether. Any help would be appreciated.

There is an update now for me for Android
---
Hmm...I was wondering if I just hadn't gotten that change because the mobile update hasn't come out yet...I've gotten the announcement, but when I clicked it the store didn't contain the bundles yet.
---
But I am seeing exactly the same thing as you are, I'd been looking forward to asking "Oh great oracle, what is the best deck in the game that runs Jade Idol and Hadronox?", and its answer was "Double Innervate, Zombie Chows, Green Jellies, ..., Dr. Boom, Splitting Festerroot, and Violet Wyrm". SMH
---
Just to clarify, is your collection complete and have all the cards necessary for Odd Mage?
---
I just started the update for android
---
Tree in art was such an overpowered mechanic, they dealt with it in the only way possible.
---
6 mana to all enemy minions, twinspell
---
Wow and the still removed it?  
---
Oh well, next itme invent some odd discussion point to go with it and then they can't really remove it for said rules.  
---
!RemindMe 3 months  
---
Words marked.
---
ya im canadian
---
Not complete, but I do play odd mage, so yes.
---
I mean it doesn't count any packs you get afterwards.  The 16 packs for F2P is obviously not enough.  They have to either pay for more, which is a worse deal if you don't get the preorder, or they have to buy them with gold.
---
This is good. Truth. 
---
Yeah. But I think that would be like new keywords. And if each class only gets one or two cards, I don't think it would be that confusing. But I guess it would be to new players.
---
I just thought it would be neat if like paladin got one or two adapt, warrior got a joust, mage or shaman got inspire. You're probably right though lol.
---
And I was trying to think... and not really. Maybe potions? Handbuffs? And ... jade *shudder*
---
Wild does not seem to work at all, unfortunately.
---
I told you to quit your bullshit, that isn't being a cunt to you, that is telling you to admit to the fact you lied and was caught in said lie.
---
Calling me droll, a cunt and touched in the head is just icing on the cake at this point.  The fact that you cannot simply admit your fault, and you are constantly trying to belittle me because you are a pussy is fucking hilarious.  I'll add you to the "failtroll" watchlist.  It is always fun to catch up with the deleted accounts after a few weeks. 
---
Okay, that's not really what I was talking about whatsoever.
---
This is a joke post right?
---
Complete my deck function won't work for me. Just closes out the game and tells me to retstart.

Leeroy quit HS and started playing YuGiOh.

Even with a low roll you could just play another spell from your hand
---
Sooo, next bunch of cards will be shown in 2 weeks?
---
Priest are known for healers, Shadow Priest are known for mind control, manipulation.
---
We've had a meta for a year that routinely sees the game go to turn 10+, where one of the best cards you could play cost 10 mana.
---
Why are people still calling 10 mana cards with *massive* upsides "too slow"?
---
Jaina died for this
---
If you define Boom as "Infinite Value" then almost all hero power are "infinite value", although Boom's hero power is that much more inconsistent. 
---
I agree and this comment would deserve gold if it wasn't so obviously true

Actually, I'm pretty sure it's an acronym.  I'm not sure why they didn't put in the periods, maybe something to do with spacing issues.  Now as for what the acronym stands for...

LamboDiabloSVTT circlejerk traitor ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
---
I play it very rarely. But I never completely stopped doing so. As long as you don‚Äôt play much it won‚Äôt become stale for you.
---
Overall the game is still good enough for me to not deinstall it, and every new expansion is fun for a few days at least.
---
If you think about HS as a game to play each day chances are it will become boring, but if you don‚Äôt have that expectation it‚Äôs a great game from time to time.
---
This bad boy can cast so many spells for zero Mana.
---
Say you play it and cast pyroblast, sure you got a 4/12, but did you really gain anything? If you pyro you're dead sure you're going to win, 4/12 or nah. 
---
This is no different than that seven drop because the effect is supposed to outweigh playing just the spell, you get a minion, BUT what does it matter if you use a turn to pyro either way? You're certain to win, why play a 10 drop instead? 
---
Say you clear board, does a 4/12 pose threat? No. 
---
Perfect for my Hakkarlock. See you later Elise.
