&gt;Why can't they make solo adventures like karazhan and league of explorers, instead of these, boring, repetitive, rng filled adventure runs? 
---

---
Because that style of adventures was not worth returning to after you had already beaten it once. Draft is much more interesting and dynamic.
---
---
---
Yes they need swatting otherwise they'll stay in that one area for eternity.
---
I honestly thought that would have the best winrate of the lot, it's brutal. You get a handle on the game and worthy opponent plays psychopomp and summons the absolute best possible game changer card previously played and its gg.
---
I just dont like how awful mage is in standard, its my favorite class and I wanna play it, so I switched
---
I actually just got Ahmet and plan to try this tonight. It seems like the only real obvious way to pull it off without getting real weird with it
---
Jeez, I didnt beat my plague lord on a similar fasion
---
You would be right if the boss couldn't be beat over the course of multiple runs.
---
I had a complete crap run because I was just screwing around, and I still got him down to about 130 health in just one run.

That 5/1 deal 5 to all enemy minions is also really strong vs that murloc flood once you've cleared your deck.
---
That's not exactly how it works. This is only the case if your loop includes some optional effect ("you may do X", using an activated ability and so on). There are infinite combos that don't have those: an example of this would be having a Bishop of Wings + Arcane Adaption (naming angel) versus opponent's Ethereal Absolution. Once any of your creatures dies, you're stuck in a loop of summoning 0/0 spirit angels. This combo is just going by itself without any player input, so you can't just stop at an arbitrary moment. Such combos are ruled to be ties.
---
Earthquake gg
---
I got doomhammer earlier. Insane value
---
put like that, yeah, it's 233 gold per pack. but remember, it's also 3 free packs for Ch. 1, and another 3 freebies for the Epic Finale.  So if you do em all that's 15 packs at 140 gold each -- still higher than normal, but hopefully you got some enjoyment from the solo content
---
Wax Rager resummons itself on death, so it is just outright infinite damage once he gets on the board.
---
Nice

And giving us less content for the same price.

Is this one of Bob's Bombastic Decks?
---
The faster you play the worse you play (for the most part). Unless you're TrumpSC, then you take 90 seconds to think of a play and the turn ends before you're halfway done making it. :P
---
Personally prefer Jaina since she can keep summoning elementals while removing their murloc. Really the only issue she has is that she's 9 mana and doesn't trigger at the start of the game.
---
Also with so many murloc being summoned, Baron Geddon can heal a ridiculously large amount every turn.
---
I had Sorc and Unstable lethal as well but with a flamewaker!

I had the option to take whiz bang, so I did and I did absolutely nothing, just a dead draw
---
The setup:
---
Jr. Scout given +2/2, cost reduced by 1, and always starts in starting hand from taverns.
---
2x face damage anomaly.
---
Zephrys's lamp, which always gives cold blood when played with low mana on a small board. If [[Adaptation]] had given me +3 attack then the boss would have been dead turn 3.
---
He was at 16 with 12 on fatigue. I only had to land one hit and he pulls a draw out.
---
I saw that it had 300 health and did t try it. Is it difficult?

Nice man! You obviously weren’t cheating so it’s kinda messed up they just shut down your account and weren’t going to talk to you about it
---
You can beat it in multiple runs. But if you break a bit the deck is easy to beat it in one. So is not that difficult at least in normal difficulty.
---
Hearthstone is **literally** the most expansive digital CCG out there.
---
So far nearly every of those "I've been banned for no reason" posts turned out to be either blatant lies or at least someone not telling the whole story. I always look at those skeptically and - to be honest - I think that more people should (because most of the time those get massive amounts of upvotes despite being super sketchy). Glad that this time it was real and it ended well.
---
Thank you for investigating and resolving the matter fairly.  
---
Please also consider the questions posed by u/valuequest.
---
Might have to do with the card that turns all the minions into one tribe.
---
3 card packs..
---
It's the first wing, it shouldn't be outrageous. Something like this isn't going to get me to buy it. I'll just buy packs.
---

---
that's some next-level mind games the ai is playing at
---
Ain’t there a 1/1 from the hench clan hag that’s also a type all? Did you get super lucky or is that not part of the hs code.
---
By de Old Gods!
---
It is more than kinda messed up. They didn’t even look into the issue long enough to understand it well and then auto ignored the appeals explaining their mistake. I’m glad they got it right but that card has shown multiple systemic failures on the dev side, starting with having to do nerfs the community called out before it was even launched and unfortunately probably not ending here. This is really concerning for the game going forward.
---
You did the community a service by sharing your experience. Based on Blizzard's reply, we can be reasonably confident that you not only saved your own account but some other innocents' as well. Carry on!
---
4 Mana Snip-Snap? Oh god no.
---
Yes it's a good way to prevent the current exploit, but when people play it normally (play them max 3 times), it's such a huge nerf.
---
That's only a token, not it's own card
---
We still don't know if he's innocent though.
---
A fair appeals process should provide an appellant with all the facts that support the initial finding and should also take into account additional information from the appellant.  Of course it is difficult to provide more information if you don’t know what *exactly* you’ve been accused of.
---
“We think you cheated” and “We looked into it again and, yep, you cheated” don’t make for much of a fair appeals process. This is what is so troubling about this incident.
---
That's like 280 dust! Poggers!

I don’t get what is so good about this comment. It would actually be fairly easy to tell if this is a recurring “issue” (cord puller) vs one time request from a dissatisfied customer. Not sure why it would be so terrible to occasionally allow another run for paying customers given the high cost and real possibility of client side issues.

As of now, he might be unbanned based on “rollbacks.” Which would be hilariously incompetent.
---
It ain’t march though
---
No offense, but this happens far too often in the appeals process. A thread on the WoW sub this month was nearly an identical situation but for a handicapped player using an assistive program.
---
A boilerplate response from a GM or CS agent, a promise that a fair review has already been completed, and a locked account with little path forward. But sure enough, a day later, a Blue is posting an 'Our bad' spiel. I pity folks who might get swept up in this sort of thing who *don't* know to try to use Reddit as a soapbox. Seems the system is broken if your actual best hope of a fair hearing is throwing yourself at the mercy of the community.

It's incredibly common to not inform people who are suspected of cheating or anything like that what exactly led to their ban, so that it's harder for them and others to determine how the anticheat software caught them.

Well played, /u/lexandremon
---
They would never nerf Snip instead of Mechwarper, cause you have to give literally everyone 3200 dust. Where 2 Mechwarpers are 80 and most not even have it, cause it's a really old Wild card.
---
It sucks to hear and I personally disagree with that statement, but unfortunatelly that's how they would handle it.
---
Only the Heroic cardbacks have any real value, and I guess preorder ones have some monetary value...technically.
---
r/unexpectedouija
---
Thanks for the quick reply and wow. How stupid ...  
---
I didnt bother to disentchant them because I wanted to look if the card is still playable. Played a bit yesterday and realized that its not. Unlucky haha.
---
Nvm, the first time i played that i chose malygos and got 4 copies of it on the board and that's what i thought the card did but now, I realise that that's the time something very unlikely happened and now absolutely nothing special did  
---
Basically misunderstood what party of 4 did due to getting the same 4 minions the first time i used it and i thought it was a bug now that it gave me diffrent minions
---
Sorry to be the one to break the bad news!
---
I think it depend on the card; some have short animation time but some take like forever (shudderwock)
---
Great move by AI. Now he's safe from ban waves.

1.Choose **House Specia**l (Replace your Adventure Deck with one of Bob's Bombastic Decks) and get a pogo deck.

2.Then use **Do the Math** (Remove all cards from your Adventure deck that cost (2) or less), so there is nothing in my deck and on my board.

3.Since there is only  **Twist - Plague of Madness and**  VIP **Membership** in my deck, I died immediately because of fatigue damage.

Start a match. While it's loading before the heroes are shown quit. Like force quit. Wait over the 5 or so minutes it takes for them to count you as a leaver. When you try to login again it will attempt to reconnect and you'll get stuck in that screen forever (I waited 10 minutes). Force quit, open hearthstone and you will have lost your run. That was my experience on the heist at least.
---
dis p2w game smh
---
VIP merchant gave me the option to swap my deck into these amazing OP cards(every quest reward,fully enchanted spellstones, Ra, ect...) and it gave me a spell whenever I draw card it costs 0 and gives me 2 extra copy and I had the passive that whenever I play legendary it summons a copy of it.
---
I agree that the core of this problem is Blizzard relying on the animations and the turn timer to balance the game.
---
Blizzard already had a bad experience with the Shudderwock / saronite chain gang infinite combo last year.
---
Honestly I don't see a solution for the problem other than meticulously assessing each ban.
---
Reno's flexplosion is powerful enough to take out unnerfed violet wurm
---
Man seriously fuck Blizz and this game. The inconsistencies throughout every aspect of the game have killed it for me. After about 6 years and over a thousand pounds/euros spent, I think I'm done.
---
Wha-
---
It’s a adventure, the new Uldum expansion. The new adventures are using a persistent deck for each run, and you pick various cards to add after each win. The screen shown is from a bonus “level” where you go the a “tavern” and can buy cpvarious power ups/cards from the bar man.

Bruh why did you just comment 1600 dust, God himself, 1600 dust, 1600 dust, 1600 dust, 1600 dust
---
Evil Genius was used in a Midrange Warlock which I saw earlier, that may have been the edge????
---
I'm not sure about the new Whizbang lists but I assume one was a pure Lackey deck, so that could've been a factor too...
---
muu.
---
Is funny. I give 4/10 for funny joke.
---
So, they guy needed a reddit post with over 2k upvotes to have his account unbanned right? what those that get un-justified bans will received as a payback for blizzard mistake?
---
You need to get "VIP Membership" as passive treasure as good old Bob will deliver. Big time.
---
You can't say she's not hot tho the artist was clearly going for it
---
Well ain't that something. Im glad you got your account back
---
Well replacing the weapon sets off the deathrattle, but yeah Hearthstone would have worked.
---
All stack onto one big guy, I suppose?
---
Scaleworm, or Gazhrilla. Maybe Knuckles
---
I see you watch some Ozzy Man eh?
---
If he ever did one on games, this right here would fit the context Perfectly
---
If you continuously make moves fast enough it extends your turn
---
You can't give Bob the win. He'll take it himself.
---
Usually Hearthstone is connected to Warcraft lore. Every expansion there is usually some ‘famous’ Warcraft Lore character. In SoU, Brann Bronzebeard is an example. 
---
I don’t think we will see any Overwatch themed expansions any time soon. Would be cool but Overwatch is in no way connected to World of Warcraft or Hearthstone I believe.
---
I actually really like that mechanic...
---
plague of murlocs btw
---
I think Tombs of Terror is great. Granted I have only done wing, I find it more interesting and fun than the Dalaran Heist. Prolly cause of the return of memorable characters for me.
---
Bobs decks are awesome. I got two hunters focus or whatever that reduce the cost of cards by 3 and an azsari  for the plague lord. He never saw it coming.
---
Come to think about it, you're probably right, but that's not something we can realistically calculate.
---
But the overload hero power needs to be unlocked? So it can't of been your first run... As does the weapon infact
---
Why fix animation issues when you can just adjust your ban procedures instead. Blizzard with another bandaid solution.
---
His hero power is designed to stop fast decks
---
I did chapter 2 first
---
smol
---
indi
---
company
---
What about actually fixing the underlying issue? Any talks on that
---
Yes. The classic expansion was entirely Warcraft based. Naxxramas, Blackrock Mountain and GvG were also very Warcraft related. Later on Hearthstone became more creative and created its own characters (like Elise, Finley and Reno). 
---
I guess over the years, Hearthstone has become more independent. But at its core, it’s linked to World of Warcraft (and possibly forever to). I highly doubt Overwatch theme expansion will happen but it’s a possibility.
---
I think they got 7 packs of the newest set
---
My comment started off as a joke, but then I thought about it and felt like it would fit the norm for Blizzard responses to things like this. I would expect him to be banned and remain banned, but if their automated bans caught many people in a bug, I wouldn't be surprised if legitimate bans got caught by a batch rollback as well.
---

It's $5 less.

Congrats bro, I remember how I finally defeated him couple of months ago with Paladin as last. Gg wp
---
Nice!
---
It could have like a card back or something at the end for beating them all but I suppose we aren't sure yet
---
Yep!  Completely resets to 300
---
In the second wing, there are bosses with weapon removal... So, good thing you didn't use it there
---
Will try
---
Once wing 3 opens you can reduce her to 3 secrets which seems perfectly doable
---
This comment itself is a bullshit rubber stamp
---
It’s pretty damned good...
---
wha-
---
the 8 packs you miss out are worth nothing, maybe one epic an 8 rare cards, woah.  
---
You don't have to do awfull PvP with roping bullshit metadecks from heartpwn, so thats a huuuge plus!
---
does he actually say that or did you put in the lich king quote?
---
congrats
---
I haven't done the math, but that sounds right.
---
That one is/was also 4
---
I just died to fatigue with the boss at 2hp, almost an hour for that last fight alone... the last hero power he gets is fucking awful design
---
5 lifesteal each turn, wins you a lot of game, unless the opponent has weapon removal, some have in the second wing.
---
It's something that Firebat/Zalae/Purple call him, I think it's because his card art looks like a blue goose.
---

JRuss#11794 EU 80g quest trade. You go first but i will show you the quest :)
---
What's wrong with the [current one](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/e/e8/Questing_Explorer_full.jpg)?
---
Do you even get anything for completing it on normal or heroic?
---
Tom#23194 80g, You are going first :)
---
It is like a rank you go from rank 50 to rank 1 and once you get higher than rank 1 you get a number and this is called legend, which means this is your actual position in your region ei N/A or EU. If your number is 10 then you are top 10 in your region
---
&gt; Is hitting Legend based purely on RNG? 
---
No, there is a reason why top players maintain around 65% (and higher) winrates.
---
&gt; I feel like RNG is so much more important in HS 
---
In HS you have rng cards, and you will have matches that will be crearly won/lost for it. But, unlike MTG, you will not insta lose due to mana flow/screw. I played MTGA (got to [Mythic](https://i.imgur.com/dr6s7RG.jpg) in the three firsts seasons, then left because I didnt like all the hand fixing they were putting on Bo1) and I would say that the influence of luck is even in both games IF it is MTGA's Bo1 what we are comparing to HS.
---
&gt; how different is the HS economy and the MTGA economy? Has anyone ever done the math to see which one is more f2p friendly? 
---
I didnt the math, but MTGA is definitely more f2p friendly for starters, not sure in the long run (if we compare standard formats). Since they are f\*\*\*ing up the new Historic format, HS is definitely less expensive if we compare Historic to Wild.
---
You didnt ask about skill: MTG definitely has a higher skill floor due to more mechanics and rules. Now, about skill ceiling, while the average MTG deck has a higher skill ceiling than the average HS deck, sometimes there are some HS decks which its skill ceilings are comparable and even higher than the highest skill ceiling decks in MTG (ofc, I am talking for the meta that I experimented and for Bo1 format; playing with the sideboard in Bo3 will increase its skill floor/ceiling). Right now the high floor and high skill ceiling deck in the HS meta is Combo Priest.

Or, you know, the face that Vesh keeps shooting himself in the foot by destroying his murlocs in order to buff ours
---
Not sure I see the connection. It's not about language or understanding. Something can't be "generally" in a vacuum.
---
Why wouldn't you just reply to the thread *you* started?
---
They changed it to always show a shrine you haven't done if any, the one that beat you if you lost, the one you just used, and then random ones to fill
---
Which, to me, is the worst offense. It's just annoying, it's not something I'd expect Blizzard to "fix"
---
That could also be a solution...pls blizz.
---
F
---
*megalovania noise*
---
That's weird- it says exactly the same thing as Celestial Emissary, and I'm pretty sure that that stacks.
---
The problem is that if that was implemented, people would only ever pick the "meta" option, and the meta would become flooded with those decks.
---
Can definitively buy that, but that would shut down the discussion. I rather talk about the correct uses of the word, rather than the practical/colloquial uses

Treasures and buckets being different makes it pretty much like a DLC of Dungeon Run.
---
Personally, I really haven't had as much fun in a Dungeon Run-style game, as the run where I got the "even cost cards refresh your Hero power and makes it free for the rest of the turn" passive, in a deck with spell generation and Sorcerer's Apprentices. I genuinely must've used my Hero Power 15 to 20 times by the time I killed the boss on turn \~7.
---
Even for an early ability she is frustrating to use.  It's entirely possible that you can go an entire run without even the ability to activate her.  Which sucks for something you have to choose before the even the first buckets.
---
Yeah you right. Worst of the worst.
---
I somehow beat it first run
---
You literally said you're replying to posts in your other thread....
---
Congrats, the power of reddit and Blizzard caring about the reddit community :) Will u still play that warlock deck tho?
---
I mean... There are actually a couple ways to play around it. For instance if you have an Animated Armor on board when the weapon die, you are immune for 5 turns and then take 1 damage.
---
I like the content but I find the plague lords annoying. You don’t get the satisfaction of making it through a run and finally beating a boss, just “oh I did 200 damage, guess I need to start over”
---
In my case I probably would have killed him if I went for face damage, but I mistakenly thought I could just rely on fatigue so I was using my 9/9s to clear his 2/1 murloc and so forth for many turns.
---
Then when I got him under 100 health and he was at 12 fatigue Fatigue, he suddenly gets a whole new deck and my deck is empty.
---
Which means that anytime in the future someone gets banned, they are going to come crying on reddit about it regardless of whether the ban was legitimate or not
---
0 attack minions can attack if forced to by effects like Duel!, or Mass Hysteria.

I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Jr. Tomb Diver. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Jr. Tomb Diver pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Blizzard create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?! Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.
---
Super super fukd
---
*Potentially* viable doesn’t mean it will ever *actually* be viable, though. Like Troggzor: on paper, he gave you a better board presence every time your opponent cast a spell. In practice, though... Well, we never had memes or entire expansions joking about how generically good he was.
---
Not sure if it works with the ones once you start the match, but the dialogue bubbles that block the Play button can be clicked away. Just click the dialogue bubble and it immediately closes it.
---
le sigh
---
That sort of goes against the concept of a persistent health pool.
---
I know and I agree all the dialogue you can’t skip sucks I was just talking about exiting taverns seemed faster now which when I noticed was like a nice QOL but then all the other unskippable stuff kinda reverses all that lol.
---
Yeah like the major point of plague lords is that you can whittle them down over multiple runs
---
What a great name for an isekai novel! XD
---
And I told the guy BrM and LoE weren't free. Not sure why you had to come in with fucking sass.
---
In Dalaran heist they added a "save" mode where it you leave it keeps your game going for when you come back. So I dont think that would work.
---
Alright, lets math it. 
---
For a 1/1 it's 1 mana, for a 2/2 it's 2 mana, same is true for a 3/1 and a 1/3. 
---
At a 4/6 his stat line is approximately 5 mana. Ontop of 3 arcane missles that makes him a +2 on mana efficiency which is decent but not crazy. 
---
He doesn't do anything degenerate, but that is because he is not the win condition in a singleton deck, just like old Reno he is there to get you there. 
---
So in otherwords, yeah your right lol.
---
Bob Replaced my entire deck with pogo hoppers and then i took the minions from his side of the board. Upgraded Taverns are crazy haha
---
Lol thank you for the math
---
Ok buddy, thats just the english name tho
---
People don't want to acknowledge reality on this... the legal system deals in far too subtle shades of grey for their retina-burned basement-dwelling eyes to detect
---
I had continuously tried to explain why they brought it up, and you just kept saying there was no point in bringing it up.
---
You then complained that they should’ve just taken the time to look it up when you made it clear you didn’t bother to check why they said what they said.
---
Just 300&gt;0'd the Madness Titan with this first try in normal. In a spell fishing/secret deck with the +2 armor, and play a minion from deck when you cast a spell. Had windfury anomaly active. On to Heroic now. Probably going to try his split hero power for this.
---
Too many post of people not looking at the card art hard enough so they easily misinterpret it in ways that make little to no sense. Common example: [[Stoneclaw Totem]]
---
Another example is [[Stolen Steel]] featured in this post. The man in the art is clearly not Reno Jackson and who he is stealing from is not even undead (forsaken). But of course because they sorta look alike everyone here who didn't prescribe no eye glasses posts about this supposed linked story cards.
---
Another two idiotic example are this [[Ooze]] [Ooze](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/a/ad/Ooze_%28Bilefin_Tidehunter%29_full.jpg?version=2da7675d75dd5972648ba32d791130e9)
---
And [[Huge Toad]].
---
I am sorry but Hearthstone didn't fall enough into Saturday Cartoon world aesthetics that we start seeing Toads with cigars and Oozes with graduation hats. Items and visuals that do not make any sense in the set Theme they were released in and the game they are based on.
---
Last I checked, Jaina is a multi-classed hero.
---
Oh! I had that wrong in my head. Thanks for the correction!

2/3/2 Beast | Deathrattle: Deal 1 damage to a random enemy.  
---
I feel like this is a trial balloon for a Pauper mode. Unfortunately, I think that this is demonstrating why Pauper doesn't work well in HS: a few classes and archetypes would dominate which would make the format feel repetitive and boring after a short amount of time.   
---
I'm wondering if limiting the cards to Standard would fix the issue, or maybe banning a few key cards (like Highmane) would help. I would love to see a pauper format in the game but only if it's going to be worth the while.
---
im assuming the card that discovers a 6 drop and gives it divine shield and taunt
---
Reno's a natural ;)
---
You have to understand, Papa Activision doesn’t want to spend money so Mister Roboto will happily hit 0 for yes on any ban.
---
in that case, maybe raise the health pool? Beating the last boss over the course of 1/2 run seems too easy?
---
I'm right there with you. I prefer heroic and I enjoy unlocking the things while in heroic mode.
---
I was being facetious, but your comment is untrue. Game theory applies to any situation situation involving strategy and rational agents. (The only reason game theory might not fully apply to HS is that human beings are not 100% rational.)
---
I like the idea of having a big hunk of meat that you slowly club down and that gets increasingly aggressive as you go down the many phases.
---
Guy says "Frozen Throne is free", another replied "I'm talking about BrM tho" and I replied "Thise arent free". 
---
Then you came in and cunted the place up like an asshole. Pull the stick out of your ass.
---
Did it deal 300 damage to him
---
The adventure has been out for about a day, your experience may not reflect everyone else’s .

I doubt blizzard will change something so early if ever

banned again for opening card packs at impossible human levels

I agree, I was able to do a single run 300HP on Heroic and I felt it should've been harder.
---
For those who don't know, you can also skip through your AI opponent's moves by clicking on each card they play as it pops up. Much faster.
---
Just checked it and it is a capital cursive J ... the lower bow in the j goes further down then in the f (although they do look darn similar).
---
Thank you for poiting me to that though @Aikicinema
---
I got him first try with 2 of the things that reduce enemy minions' attack -1 (so they all had -2 attack). Majority of his minions were worthless. Kept his board full of 0-attack minions so he couldn't summon more. Old Murk-Eye kept things interesting though.
---
Same here
---
i beat him fairly easily with priest the first 3 weeks i believe it was availble and said to myself i didnt need the arthas portriat.
---
It’s down worldwide
---
I also can’t get into the game
---
i am also having difficuty doing that haha, i always reach the 8th boss and get slapped down
---
Damn now I gotta pay attention in this lecture
---
I got a golden Hunter quest and it still felt bad
---
then lich king top decks obliterate and you cry lmao
---
The only pack I've ever gotten with two legendaries was a Golden Pack I got from Twitch, and I've played since the first season.
---
lol what class
---
The card isn't too bad tho
---
I don’t even know, all I do is play hearthstone during it
---
UAV Navigation and Controls
---
Maintenance.
---
same here, i cant get in
---
I also managed to get this encounter done in one attempt. It was an epic battle especially since I was not prepared for the change of the hero powers. I had the +1 health and taunt on your minions plus the Bulwark Shield that blocks lethal damage and instead deals 20 damage to the opposing hero. Add in the 0-cost Wish, and the 0-cost car that gives you mana and discovers card equal to the amount of bosses you have beaten.
---
At one point I had the shield and a discovered Ice Block up at the same time and was left at 1 health. He popped the Shield with a Blowgill Sniper, and then shuffled all the minions into his deck, leaving me with just an Ice Block up. After a lot of barely hanging in there and some lucky murlocs on my side, I finally managed to finish him off with my Ice Block still in tact.
---
Congrats!!!!
---
There isn't and I think it's a pretty big oversight.
---
Getting a boss down to just a few health and grinding all the way back just to hit them once or twice is a total bummer.
---
The health doesn't come back, next run if you get to him again the health level is where you last left it... I only had to do 39 the second time
---
Damn dude you should pay attention, Hs is not that good
---
Except it’s not
---
Rerunning 7 extra bosses is still insanely lazy and bad design
---
It's scheduled maintenance. Down until ~ Noon Pacific Time.
---
How long does it usually take? I’m a new player
---
LOL what rank and class do you usually play
---
Only for the first 100 damage
---
wait arnold voiced that?! thats awesome!
---
I had to stall by killing my own minions just to complete the 6 Secret objective, but I got there just in the nick of time! 7 Secrets in deck by the 4th Boss due to picking 3 buckets with 2, 2 and 1 Secret in them respectively.
---
you sound mad
---
Not as annoying as getting the second plague lord to 3 health before I died on my first run through, just so I had to start a second run to finish off his remaining 3 health. 
---
That felt like the biggest waste of time.
---
Same! I hit the 8th boss and then I lose. Sometimes I even lose on the 7th boss.
---
I basically gave up, lol. I don't think the rewards are worth the frustration.
---
[https://imgur.com/DotZhJd](https://imgur.com/DotZhJd)
---
its called "alarm-o-bot" hope you can beat him!
---
Yep Tree of Life works the same way.
---
Isn't that exactly the nature of spaghetti code, to always get worse?
---
The same thing happened when I played Avenging Wrath against the plague lord
---
not that interesting of a brawl. i played against a secret mage and a mech hunter and i already play against those all the time in wild...
---
Honestly you can probably beat the second plague lord in one run easily. His mechanic is stealing your rightmost minion but if you just make minions with finley’s hero power the dude is super easy.
---
Odd, I had the same situation in mine.  I was bracing myself for an endless loop of SN1P-SN4P, and he only played 1.
---
Play a match. That worked for me when I had the issue.
---
Got it again turn 1 in the very next game 😂😂😂

Maybe read before you spend money on something. It was clearly displayed at the bottom that the adventure would be cheaper later. It's not Blizzard's fault you have access to your parent's credit card.
---
I ended up beating the murloc boss first try with random murloc rng. First 5 cards were random murlocs. It's hard to lose vs that boss when you have a board advantage the entire game.
---
Why are you using an s5 if you have an s7 though
---
[r/hearthstonecirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone)
---
Darn you sexy Bob
---
Not him but- It's easy to say it's a fair trade-off from outside, but when you're the innocent sucker that gets entrapped... I honestly think I'd rather have more criminals free, and hope they either don't re-offend, or get caught.
---
Click the text bubble.
---
&gt; Under normal circumstances, a real human player can only play a small number of cards in a turn - it's just a limit of how fast a human can perform those actions
---
Lmao please. It's a limit of how obnoxiously long animations that cannot be disabled are.
---
I’ve played multiple matches.
---
Goddamn it, losing with tree of life in hand and the boss on 58 feels a lot stupider now
---
You can't have that, cause it's legendary.
---
You're in the right here. You thought they were making all adventures free and that would be really unfair to people who paid for them. This guy just started swearing and making an ass out of himself because he couldn't accept he didn't read the thread correctly.
---
So you invested 150g.  The pack returns 100g.  If we assume the average dust/pack is 50 (for some reason I think it's closer to 60) then that common card has a value of about 10 gold (probably less since I think dust/pack is higher).
---
Then you're at a loss of 40g.  Not including opportunity cost of the 5 games you played, since wins in Arena don't count towards 10g/3 wins.
---
So is it really a slap in the face that you lost 40g by not having a positive win rate?  Like you can't come out net positive at 1/2/3 wins in Arena, or else it would break the mode.
---
Dude so what?  i got a 0 mana card that starts in my opening hand that gives me the PERFECT CARD!
---
For the most part, epic cards are ones with unique, experimental, and niche effects. Some cards are made epic simply because they're strong, but not many.
---
I wonder how an escort quest would work, would you protect a minion? Knowing how annoying escort quests are, it must be a 0 1 with taunt.
---
I got the 3 mana-steal a card from enemy deck. That one was pretty fun for infinite valuetown. (Also had Alchemy treasure to keep it mana efficient).
---
Yay, good ol' midrange Hunter with the Razormaws. Forgot how much I loved Quick Shot as well.
---
I wish I could upvote this a million times.
---
Lmfao damn.
---
He’s a smooth criminal who wants to stay in the bazaar...
---
So okay thats a good way to do this thing but, 
---
I looked at rise of shadows and it only has like 5-6 playable legendaries wouldnt u think that opening boomsday instead of rise of shadows would be better ?
---
You have to set up Time Out, you can just set and forget Ice Block and get free Secret synergy
---
This makes more sense but doesn't explain why the animations take so long since the same logic could apply to the state of the boss. It needn't stop the animation every time the front end damage counter goes down
---
Yep! The health is set to the health the Plague Lord had when you escape. Here is a small snippet I tried to create on imgur just now that shows some of the cool things I saw in my run.
---
 http://imgur.com/a/K03Ihg9
---
It’s proactive vs reactive. You need skill to use Time Out correctly, whereas Ice Block can be played any time. Also, Mage’s ability to generate spells made the 5th, 6th, 7th Ice Block feel like a nightmare to play against. Paladins can’t really generate spells like that.
---
small indie company
---
Not at all, saying more attack is better for empirical reasons has nothing to do with actual quality, you can't compare that.
---
pie4magpie#2999 EU Looking for 80g trade, I will show the quest, you go first.
---
Wish I got 7 packs every someone added me after a match and falsely accused me of cheating.
---
You get some fun solo content and 3 packs.
---
finished
---
Thanks for the trade
---
Double /r/whoooosh, that's a reference to Knights of the Frozen Throne
---
it’s really not that hard
---
well now I know where that heroe comes from! Congratulations, considering how frustrating and time consuming these adventure can get you deserve to boast. Sure there are people who happily say they one with just a few tries, but I dont believe them, Ive never finished any HS adventure because I play to have fun, not get bogged down in frustration.
---
How are yu getting 600 packs??? Go for the latest expansions (Uldum and RoS) as well as classic, as those never rotate.
---
