---
---
Thank you for posting it here then!
---
At least as importantly, the downside for blastcrystal only applies if you use it before turn 10.  Reno lock was a long game deck and single target removal is still good after turn 10.
---

---
Shuffling 3 trash cards into your deck stays bad until you're about to fatigue.
---
im on the grind team, i play 1h then i have nothing to do, and winning 30 game take too much time. doing adventures feels bad bc there is no reward after 1st completion.
---
I'm pretty sure this card will trigger deathrattles inbetween the two effects, simply because otherwise it would barely make any sense to release it this way.
---
And while it's true that effects which resolves deaths inbetween are usually either recursive (defile, godfrey) or chain multiple effects together (tess/yogg/shudder), [[poison seeds]] is a spells which does neither and still resolves deaths inbetween. I'm fairly certain we will have our second exception with this card.
---
Soooo you won a highly favorable matchup? Congratulations I guess? For those of you new to wild, no, he’s not some off meta crusader murloc shaman, he’s actually playing one of if not the most broken aggro decks in wild at the moment. 
---
And yes, I hate big priest as well, but this post is so pointless.

In case you didnt peep it a few posts up, a Blizz response confirmed the interaction. Deathrattles will trigger between the casts.
---
Yes, but that means you have to not attack the boss’s face for the first 5 turns and will start off down at least 10 health on turn 5 even if you have a perfect curve
---
The classic set is pretty big 245 cards. Getting the card you want isn't likely.
---
I mean he did take lethal away from you..so he won.
---
Whats the curse passive?
---
Defile isn't the only spell with a forced death phase, and not all "cast this again" cards have one. The mechanic is used in various places when needed. Cards like Conjurer's Calling, which both destroy and summon minions, use one to clear the dead minion from the board and make space for new ones. 
---
Defile has one out of necessity for the spell to function, but Spreading Plague [has no death phase between iterations](https://i.imgur.com/re9WZsm.png).
---
It's one weekly card back from like 5 years ago. They didn't just open up all the card backs for people to buy. Kinda seems like people are trying to find something to be mad about.
---
Wow! I just finished within 22 minutes and thought that was already pretty good
---
Or maybe he get 40 min and 1 sec in the first run :)

&gt; 2 shimmerfly

&gt; 2 springpaw

&gt; 2 headhunters hatchet

&gt; 2 hench-clan hogsteed

&gt; 1 Scavenging hyena

To answer the original question, I find these most important in midrange hunter.
---

---
I won in 25 min with Hagatha adding 10 Grimmer Patrons to my deck on the second boss with the included Duplatransmorgifier
---
And *deathrattle - summon small minion(s)*
---
Have you tried Kibler's plot twist deck? There's a ton of healing in there. I've gone from 4 hp to nearly full in a single plot twist.
---
Does it work after you finish the update (bottom right) and restart?
---
Thank u for this tip
---
Finish... update?
---
This is a thing? Damn I always leave my games open while I do other stuff
---
Gotta show off that you played Tavern Brawl that one time.
---
I got it working again
---
Delays it by **up to** three draws.
---
Your game is being updated on the bottom right. At 91%
---
i remember that ds/inner fire used to be a noob trap combo that didnt really see much play and i kinda want to go back to that
---
Except the anti fatigue would be valuable against other control decks while the removal aspect wouldn’t. Seems bad in other matchups where a top deck answer could be important.
---
Idk hard to evaluate
---
I know. It’s been there like months
---
I've had it for almost a week now, it's not messing up my game or anything tho
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
if they want us to do it we need this counter.
---
That's the way to do it.
---
Play Cho, use this twice on either imps on your board or some dude on their board - turn 10 play (10 mana used) = Legend rank
---
Because control warlock isn't a good deck right now.
---
Ot won't update for me :(

3/3/3 Beast | After this minion attacks a hero, Adapt.

To bring your battle cry minions back to your hand (just a guess)
---
To get your battle crys back I would guess
---
Because pogo hopper is also in some of the battlecry buckets, I’m guessing.
---
Is there a separate award for under 30 min? I got under 40.
---
bAtTlEcRy
---
Youre missing the point. kill these 0/5 one by one, to minimize face damage. What happens is receive damage, equal to the number of 0/5 tokens died at the same time. Ex: killing only 1 token you receive 1 damage, while killing 2 simultaneously will FOUR damage (2 damage from one token and 2 from the other) and so on.
---
I did the same thing too haha nice
---
What’s the extra prize for finishing under 40 mini
---
Ouch.
---
I am insulted you think that is why I come to this sub.
---
I actually come for the discussion and card reveals. If you aren't a fan, you can always just not look, not post, no reply. You seem to be the one that wants to be part of this community.
---
There's a lot of bad and lame, but there are times when you can find the right thread or discussion. Don't get discouraged.
---
Same, I had pressed the button at least 5-6 times per match mostly with elekk and maybe 6 bombs were drawn, the fucking draw 2 boss only drew 3 bombs one of which he milled
---
The bosses should add you as a friend after you top deck lethal, just to tell you your deck sucks.
---
Having fun with this brawl. Lowest time has been 42 min.
---
Been thinking of this card for years! Token or divine shield beware! Was hoping for more of a 3 damage then 3 damage but this works.
---
How's this for going on the attack: You're a stupid, small minded, disrespectful, full of sh*t, idiotic, petty, aggressive, irritating piece of trash. Your comments astound me. You're an utter moron. I hate people like you and posting on this subreddit always turns up some toxic trash worm to spoil things. You are that trash worm. I hope my ignorance and rage hurt you this time, because you deserve it.
---
I found that using the Dr. Boom hero makes it incredibly easy. Get 7 bombs on the field and play Brawl. Also having the passive card that triggers deathrattle twice is a major plus.
---
You're a moron.
---
I mean... It is....
---
Your company is cool with you playing hearthstone on a work computer but not taking screenshots?
---
Or wait, can I still do it? Is it 40 mins each run you have, or 40 mins from your first run?

Anyone having trouble dusting the rewards?

Missed opportunity to be called earfquake.... shouts out to tyler the creator
---
Hyena and Springpaw are pretty close to core.  Shimmerfly is in most current Midrange Hunter decks so would be next most important.  Hatchet is for if you see a lot of Token Druid and Zoo, so goes in and out of builds.  Baited Arrow doesn’t see a lot of play on ladder but does in tournaments, I believe it’s for the Mage and Murloc Shaman matchups.  The other cards almost never see play in current Midrange builds, mainly because they’re usually built around Master’s Call and Zul’jin.
---
Spellbreaker is an uncommon tech card in the deck so not necessary at all, but if you feel the need for one you can sub Ironbeak Owl.  For replacement cards I would look at Tundra Rhino first because it really fits into that deck’s gameplan, Savannah Highmane if you’re facing a lot of Warriors, Eaglehorn Bow and some Secrets if you like the idea of the Hatchet, Untamed Beastmaster, Witchwood Grizzly if you see a lot of Token Druid, Marked Shot or Dire Frenzy or Unleash the Beast or Zilliax if you happen to have any of any of those.
---
This card would be so unhealthy for the game that I almost believe it because it's exactly the type of bullshit Blizzard would do.
---
I didn't see where they said that. Kinda weird that he isn't available right away anyways but I guess even Blizzard can't get some things done on time.
---
Care to be less of an asshole?
---
I didn’t even know it was timed until I saw a post about it on here. 
---
Went full bomb warrior and beat it in 28 minutes
---
I was just agreeing with you bud.
---
Next week because the brawl will be stronger
---
I'm curious how it calculates time, too.
---
What Rogue theme is getting you there? Either I am god-awful, or I am getting terrible treasures and lots.
---
Well done, and I'm glad you enjoy it, but...
---
How is it not extremely frustrating to continually try to get better times for speedrun attempts when there's so much randomness that could add entire minutes onto your time?
---
I’m prolly an idiot but gotta ask, that solitary confinement background... it’s not real right?
---
It’s not like he’s actually in one, right...?
---
I somewhat recently did heroic LoE. For those challenging bosses I used:  
---
Sun Raider:  I did something similar to [this](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1113841-pve-loe-sun-raider-phaerix-heroic). Mulligan for shadow word pain, buff up the staff with inner fire/divine spirit shenanigans, and prevent it from swapping sides. After killing the staff, silencing it also prevents it from switching sides again. Just keep restarting until you get a good mulligan.  
---
Skelesaurus Hex: Big Priest. This is straight up RNG as this boss gets random 0 mana cards. Just mulligan for Barnes and hope it does not get a big drop in the early turns. Takes luck.  
---
Rafaam Unleashed:  I used a mill rogue similar to [this](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1274226-heroic-rafaam-unleashed-mill-rogue-2019). Hopefully Rafaam doesn't get the 10/10 troll boss who increases your cards costs right before you go for the kill.  This one actually requires you to pilot the mill deck well.  
---
Steel Sentinel: I remember using [this](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/613601-heroic-steel-sentinel) guide.  
---
Scarvash: This one was the hardest for me in terms of restarts. I think I used Big Priest and just hard mulliganed for Barnes. If it hits Obsidian Statue you will be in great shape. Lots of restarting.  What's good is Barnes is a 4 drop and Psychic Scream 7 mana which do not get raised in cost on curve.

I think anyone’s “outraged”, but it certainly does somewhat limit the impact of actually having any particular cardback. Not to sound too dramatic or kooky, but I don’t think it *is* just a matter of cosmetics. There is a certain existential weight that comes along with having some cardbacks. Granted, it certainly doesn’t seem as if it matters too much much if anyone hypothetically had access to most of the rank 20 cardbacks. But for example - if just *anyone* could obtain the Pandaria cardback, I sincerely think that would be a shame. I don’t personally have it (I didn’t start playing until the month after), and I don’t want it. It’s a special signifier that you were around when the game first started. If just *anyone* can have access to it, it becomes a signifier of nothing. The impact (or “value”, if you want to get into vaguely more academic language) of having it is greatly diminished, and therefore nobody who has it would even *care* about having it. 
---
It’s somewhat comparable to having something like a golden whizbang deck. The “existential weight” of having an all golden deck is diminished to the point that the novelty wears off after a single match, because you know you don’t *really* have an all golden deck, and so does the opponent you’re playing against. When you reduce these things merely to the cosmetic level, you’re diminishing the thing itself. 
---
I just think it should be thought through more carefully than your post implies, at least with *some* cardbacks. In a purely personal sense I would extend my thought process to apply to all cardbacks, but I’d never be “outraged” about it either way.
---
One possible solution I can think of to appease both sides of the “issue” is that old cardbacks that are given again as new rewards could be given with a new color palette as well, so that newer players can still get it as a merely cosmetic reward, but veteran players can still show that they have the original.
---
Man, this makes Flamestrike look like hot garbage.
---
How does this not affect all minions on the board?
---
Then you blow up the first boss in 2 turns.
---

mine would be i just played a couple games then the game crashes and could no longer be played. did the usual troubleshooting up to updating to android Pie, to no avail
---
Using Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1
---
Oh shit
---
It wont be summoning coz it effects the minions on board..also they are disastrous so wont be evolve..might be devolve or convert everything into toads or something
---
it gives chance to decks in either case. burn mage will benefit greatly from this, and slower mage can benefit greatly when almost 1/3 enemies health total is gone from 3 mana.
---
Yea pretty sure Kripp’s ass is dyslexic
---
ANTI MECH TECH LMAO
---
Fuck He beat me by 3 seconds!
---
It will also kill your own board, So not really.
---
I think shudderwock does as well. I used to play a bunch of tempo shudderwock before the chain-gang/giggling inventor nerfs. The deck played DK thrall and if the evo battlecry went off it stopped the sequence.
---
The outrage is ridiculous.
---
What gets me is it isn’t even an exclusive card back or a card back that is particularly meaningful, it was simply a ranked reward from 4 years ago.
---
Well just armor and dont play anything lol
---
The deck would be terrible though
---
KinkyHS! Love that guy lol
---
This is my favorite brawl, racked up about 50 wins myself
---
But is that card out?
---
In Naxx? So not out?
---
it was fun as hell and i reached legend many times during Reno life span
---
Card backs are one of those things where if you have them you want them exclusive, but if you dont have them you want them to be not exclusive. Its honestly a lot like league of legends skins; they do nothing except make you feel cool.
---
I ran into this probably about same time you posted this and I got through fine.
---
I saw that playing that guy was gonna be a problem and I filled my deck with him so I slowly picked one off at a time.
---
GG2EZE
---
League of Grouchy Old and Obnoxious Downers
---
Yup, me too, so easy
---
I thought they removed it completely. That's kinda unfair tbh. My opponent played 4 eccentric scribes in this match, but I still managed to deal with them because of my hero power
---
I was opening some free packs I got as returning awards. I stopped playing right after Witchwood released.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SmokyEnchantingFlyCclamChamp
---
Well you are explaining arena, just another version of it.
---
I highly doubt it lol
---
That only matters if you can draw your entire deck. Currently Warlock can't survive until fatigue. Having 10 cards or 16 cards in your deck to turn into legendaries is no different if you only draw 8 of those cards and then die because of bombs.
---
Also turning the worthless draws into legends doesn't eliminate the dead draws, because there are some legendaries in the pool that are dead draws too. Turning an optimized constructed deck into random legendaries often actually lowers the power of the deck.
---
Come on, we need to know
---
I thought if they all died together it would be 0 damage... I mean the card text is "do damage based on how many of these bitches have died this turn" and if they all die at the same time then it would be treated like 0 had died, or at worst 1....  I was wrong.
---
And I had BRM back in the day, I just haven't played it in 3 years and forgot the mechanic.
---
This. I can't open the damn game on mobile and I will be travelling this weekend so I can't access my PC. I will miss out on so many quests and those legendary quests too. FIX THE APP BLIZZARD! This needs compensation but I doubt they will do anything. Infuriating.
---
Really disappointed I never found out who won.
---
What is this? Second helpings Hearthstone?
---
You would be the best player ever if you did that.
---
[removed]
---
Hearthstone as strong focus on intuitivity, often over technical consistency. These changes (creating another spell for the "summon treants" and "deal 2 damage") would not be intuitive at all. If the second spell would be displayed when viewing the card, it would be look clustered and be weird to read, if it wouln't, users would have no idea what happens when casting the spell.
---
I agree with this approach and don't think that there's any connection between it and the weird bugs in hearthstone.
---
It’s a simple descriptor for the appeal gained from having a particular cardback (or other comparable analogues in this game &amp; others). If you can think of a better way to phrase that descriptor, feel free to recommend it. 
---
As for the other implications of your comment, I’m in a thread about cardbacks, offering my opinion on the subject. There’s no intended implication going on from my end that this is somehow some sort of dramatically significant thing to be discussing. We’re just chatting. I’m not sure what to tell you if you think I’m chatting in a way that’s... whatever your implying here. Too dry? Too wordy? Whatever it is, it isn’t my problem. There’s nothing at all I have to say about that. 
---
If you have an actual opinion on what’s being talked about however, then I’m happy to reply to that opinion.
---
I finished mine at 40 min and 1 second. Fuuuuuuuuuu
---
Is there a reward after? I beat in 26 but I dont remember seeing the message that I can get another reward

Maybe you did, but I paid for it with in-game gold. No profit for Blizzard, since their app doesn't even run ads.

The Muscle + Duplatransmogrifier... Could have changed all minions to the muscle, 3x0 cost cards each turn

They do? The Mummy video didn't show for sure, I think.

My sympathies. 
---
The idea that you get rewards based on completion time in a turn-based strategy game is absurd beyond measure. Those responsible for testing should be demoted for not doing their job. Especially considering the recent issues with mobile devices and the more and more frequent disconnects, both of which could add several minutes of delay and additional frustration.
---
I suspect the reason was either to "improve" some statistics which can be included in the upcoming business reports or simple laziness. It was a little bit easier to store a timestamp at the start of the first game and compare it to the time at the end of the last game, than implementing something different like a turn counter that can count turns taken across multiple games.
---

Casual from /r/all here. Why does it not just deal 7 damage?

Unfortunately no

Much as I'd *love* to run Boom in my bomb hunter, I don't think there's anyway to live that dream (pretty sure even the new Brightwing gives random legendary *minions* only and not hero cards)

&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, my deck has "your Mechs have **Charge**" anyway (every mech is magnetic lol) so even better than rush!

Always fuck me with this, so tired of this shit

rogue got heavily nerfed this expansion, i'm not sure what are u talking about
---
and she just said she likes the quest, not that the quest is overpowered (i bet some devs like the discard quest on warlock and we all see how that went)
---
No, only for 40 minutes and 60 minutes
---
dude i was talking about the video that you just posted :)
---
Bro there's just no way this card is worth running over other options. If you're spending health and mana to get dead draws you're just fucked.  I can see this MAYBE in a really fast aggro zoo deck as a one of, but even then you have demonbolt and I would rather run a silence.
---
Took me until the start of turn 3 to realize that there was a fuckton of damage on board that I had to start clearing
---
U will get new quests every day till 17th july

---
Hearthstone is a very battery and disk space friendly app.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Yup
---
I agree with u and don't understand the whining at all as I said in the main post. That's why I thought rather than whining over nothing it would be more amusing for everyone just to have a fun poll.
---
idk how you guys use so many deckslots anyway, I've literally never gone above 9. if you're really that irritated then go play MTGA where you can make 60
---
The next is 40 minutes and i had 0.40.12
---
So like changing his mana cost?
---
You waited 2 weeks to tell me that?
---
16 minutes on warrior for me I won on Turn one for first boss and didn't go past 5th turn for almost every boss
---
As many other comments here, I think the overall feeling is misunderstood.
---
Old players (or at least me) are complaining about not getting anything just because you already owned the cardback... It's a little unfair and not cool
---
i never said itll get reprinted, just that they hinted to rag going to wild
---
NASA does it, why can't hearthstone devs?!
---
I didn't wait, I just saw this comment.
---
my point was that there should be a visible reward for collecting cosmetic in the first place.
---
It feels good to see your units/heroes' new skin in Starcraft2 and any MOBA game, because you look at them pretty much the whole time you play the game.
---
In HS, the existence of cardback is next to non-existance. Do you actually feel good by looking at your chosen cardback in 0.5s it shows when drawn? Or have you ever feel 'damn, I want that card back so bad' when 3 of them are shoved into your face as your opponent play a discover card?
---
I don't deny the importance of collecting aspect in card games, or just any game. I just think that it is poorly implemented into the gameplay of HS. Heroes' portraits -&gt; good. Cardbacks-&gt; meh.
---
What do you get when you beat it under 40 minutes?
---
One golden Bronze Herald for finishing in under an hour, and one golden Recurring Villain for finishing in under 40 minutes. 
---
I also got a similar error on mobile, but checked it out on my PC and the card was still there.
---
Yesterday, the quest came in at around noon I think
---
The caverns below was a mistake yes, but if the damage is already done they should had delay scalehide release after caverns rotation. But Blizzard has a double standard when comes to Rogue and Priest. They are over-conservative towards Priest (delayed Mass res, Catrina and Vargoth after PS and Shadow visions rotations and on the other hand they released Raiding Party, pike, lackeys, ect...). I just want them to be conservative about Rogue as well, they seem to have the policiy of release it broken and nerf after when it comes to Rogue releases (because Rogues are supposed to do broken stuff for some reason (that's what they said when they were denying Raiding Party to be broken)). The Rogue quest seems to go for the exact same way.

I'd use that site to see what's being played right now, you can even see the dust cost of each deck there. Since the next expansion will release in a few weeks I'd wait a bit to see what's going to be good after that.
---
How the fuck are you supposed to win with Lazul?!
---
and "no escape from big priest" sounds like the most alarming video from that genre
---
rofl
---
They just add cards as "classic" , which will be balancing factors of their game. They are not gonna rotate out like the rest of the "new expansion" cards when the time comes. Also, the game is out 5 years now...
---
Helps against divine shield minions.
---
Was there a way to get the scheme during the tavern brawl? Must have missed that?
---
'I don't want to talk about it, but I will write dozens of cryptic comments about it.'

It seems like you could 'be bothered' to write the initial comments as well as reply to me. Perhaps you care more than you let on.

I got [[Sunkeeper Tarim]], [[The Last Kaleidosaur]] and [[The Voraxx]]

4/3/3 | After you cast a spell on this minion, summon a 1/1 Plant and cast another copy on it.  
---
Ok I was wondering about that because when I went to go disenchant my golden recurring villain it was gone and I didn’t get my dust &gt;:(
---
These players were almost surely using the exploit that involves quitting out repeatedly. I can assure you that those times are impossible if the players are killing Ragnaros as late as turn 5 or 6.
---
Too bad Control Warrior can beat Control Shaman with just one card, Dr. Boom hero.
---
Thanks for that.   
---
I'd add that your quests can be completed on your opponent's turn, and as an added note (not in the article), your quest can't be burnt if your hand is full when it completes.
---
Was playing as Hagatha and had the chance to use Duplatransmogrifier on a Horror created by Hagatha.  
---
  
---
[It had Jade Lightning and Maelstrom Portal on it, I almost lost because this combo does not work.](https://imgur.com/a/9QoySmb)
---
Who are you and where is our Blizzard??!?!!
---
Poor man’s Bloodmage Thalnos
---
Hagatha comes with the treasure that copies and replaces all minions and then I chose the robes
---
Does this mean I will no longer have instant queues starting in 3.0?
---
Any of them?
---
Sped it up so we can't see how terrible your APM is I see...
---
Already won 7 runs, and lost like 10 extra trying stuff and i at least get to beat 4 bosses each run
---
I think i did my part
---
Wow, you cracked the code!
---
But can you figure out who Harrison Jones is referencing? That's the real tricky one.
---
Battery? Absolutely not
---
Just had a decent first ever run by Duping the Deal 2 Damage lackey and having Hand of Rafaam too. I recommend trying that Dup instead of Trogg if you get the chance again, could easily take you under 13m.
---
I managed to complete my first run in 37 min using toggwaggle,I played really fast and got pretty lucky tbh (against rag I started with the 0 Mana spell that fill your hand with coins and Edwin so I ended my first turn with an 18/18 Edwin on board lol)
---
Nice. I managed to get just under half an hour with bombs.
---
Quests are not so hard you cant complete them with f2p budget deck.
---
My Nozdormu deck is useless now
---
I forget the dragon's name with the hero power weapon but i just kept shuffling in bombs. The match ended with them drawing 4 bombs in a row
---
There aren’t.
---
Too soon
---
I got just under 20 minutes with a priest cthun deck, and with that ability where everything is half cost but you can only play two cards per turn.
---
Time traveler memes intensify
---
I prioritized bombs, but two treasures I pulled were start with 3 boom bots and double deathrattle. Got to Ragnaros and he died without using his hero power once or even upgrading it.
---
Rogue quest: lucky lackey (play six lackeys)
---
Reward: wrong neighborhood (your lackeys have +4/+4)
---
I share your pain. Currently at 17/18 decks, really don't want to delete any.
---
Don’t worry guys, Team Fight Tactics is now rotating to the classic set as a replacement!
---
"Anyone who disagrees with me I'm going to call names!"
---
State your opinion.  If it's worth hearing maybe people will agree with you.
---
Token druid is perfect for budget ladder climbing. Its arround 1.2-2k dust to craft from scratch, it is kinda fun to play an your worst match will be tolen druid. After you get bored there is midrange budget hunter or mech hunter and then the most hated controll warrior and cyclone mage decks , offcourse you can allways be a poggo rogue or zoolock. The decklist you can find easy in any site. Good luck and dont forget ot have fun in the end.
---
Turn 1: Earth Shock.  
---
Turn 2: Rockbiter Weapon.  
---
Turn 3: Feral Spirit.  
---
Turn 4: Stargazing hero power twice.
---
I'm sorry but you seriously don't need more than 18. I play Hearthstone for hours every day, 18 is a good number.
---
No shiet?!
---
Jesus he GOT nerfed! 5 mana?! That's outrageous! What's next, making cold blood cost 2 along with it to shut down the shadow step combo? Lol.
---
I thought they said they weren't going to do anymore hero cards for this year?
---
Official reveals don't start until July 23rd...FeelsImpatientMan

You seriously need more than 18. Especially if you play wild and standard
---
please
---
Just get a Notepad file, and copy and paste checklists when you need them. You can save a thousand deck codes in notepad if you like.
---
14 minutes on double deathrattle goblin bomb/boombot Warrior. I got double dr boom’s remote on the same run and plenty of elekks and bomb cards. Rag died turn 5.

Try robes of gaudiness with duplo zilliax. Perfection.
---
"Hall of Fame" is where they put cards that they've decided they don't want in the core set anymore (usually because they are too strong, see play in too many decks, or prevent them from printing new cool effects). Essentially it means you can only play them in Wild mode. 
---
They only put cards in the Hall of Fame at rotation (the first set release of the year, when the 3 oldest standard sets leave, and a new set comes in). When they do, if you own the cards, they let you keep them, but also give you as much dust as they are worth, so you can craft a replacement card for standard.

He

Tutned himself into Ragnaros,

Turned enemy into Ragnaros,
---
Turned that Ragnaros into other Ragnaros
---
Played Ragnaros on board
---
And killed enemy Ragnaros with his Ragnatos hero power.
---
Sure, but that's sometimes fun. 
---
One of the problems I have in playing friendly matches is that I've got awesome decks and my friends don't. We often use Whizbang and Zayle as ways to level the playing field. I hope more cards like that get made.
---
You sunk my battleship!
---
It's Hearthstone, life is telling you to switch to something else.
---
Imo not even worth putting in the deck it just makes kangors worse with every play of it
---
Guess you could pity timer it to make sure you land a legendary?Idk

that sounds awesome as fuck

Uh, this is a single player brawl in case you didn't notice
---
My limited understanding is you can get away with playing the deck without it. You could also just wait to play it until after you Kangor since a turn 9+ snip snap is really powerful.
---
Big Priest memes aside, Wild is way more diverse than Standard at the moment.
---
You can do it, the subreddit believes in you.
---
Big bear sure loved the honey
---
Yeah, I feel like people are forgetting that Mage has bad spells too
---
also better vs Reborn perhaps, but we'll see on that one

Lmfaooo I remember that Geico Ad

Granted, it’s an assumption. But it seems, to us non-dev plebes, like something that wouldn’t require a titanic amount of resources. If it does, then some communication from blizzard explaining why it’s not feasible would be welcome. But they just haven’t addressed the issue in years. I guess that’s part of the frustration.

Wasn't there a news article that recently said the quest rewards wouldn't have infinite value like some of the DK hero powers had?
---
I don't know about this one though. 2 mana infinite [[Primordial Glyph]] without the discover part.
---
I'm not completely sure about this, but I believe that for overkill to trigger, the minion itself has to attack. A minion targeted by bees will be defending, and overkill will therefore not trigger.
---
Yeah as you rightly pointed out, you really only need two. It doesn’t happen often but it’s possible. You should reset if you don’t get either hand, robes, or dice (yes dice). Dr. Boom’s remote while tempting and very good is a bit too slow. Thinking like that you’ll get the second robe about one every 4 runs that you get going.
---
But still this is infinite value and the net cost of gaining a spell is 0 mana.
---
nice

---
Gurubashi Berserker + Beeees is insane
---
Looks like TFT is back on the menu boys if this is the path of quests they are taking.
---
Bit late.
---
Neutral is gray, Druid is brown.
---
Wild is far and away the superior format, regardless of how degenerate a lot of the top decks are. 
---
Standard is just the gimped babby version of Hearthstone that forces you to keep buying cards to keep up with the game.
---
Seems like the god curve will be t1 quest, t2 EVIL Totem, t3 anything, t4 lackey + wasp
---
This seems really great! In both aggro and control, this can be a huge tempo swing, especially if you compare it with the similar-costed [[Spring Rocket]]. The lackey needed won't really be a problem due to Rat, Slurper, and the new totem
---
You might be right, overkill may only trigger when it’s your turn and the minion attacks. But I swore I’ve seen a highlight clip of Linecracker + Mass Hysteria with a board full of 1/1 imps working.
---
You can also only do it once a turn, which makes it significantly worse than Hagatha's hero power.

While we’re on the topic, I would like the ability to move my decks around. It sounds super trivial (and it is) but I like organizing my decks a certain way (by class, in a line, starting with Druid) and every time I find a new deck I have to delete all my decks and recopy the deck code to organize it how I like. I may be on the minority here but being able to move your decks around in your collection seems like something that they could give us with minimal effort.
---
HOLY SHIT! lets GOOOOOO!
---
I'd been wondering if any double quest decks would look likely, and here it is
---
Yup, I can already see packing it full of damage dealing minions all down the curve. This card, Lifedrinker, the 5 mana one (that triggers on holding a spell), 6 mana class Elemental, etc.
---
this is absolutely insane, mage has bonkers spells and now they cost 2 less. it blows shamans out of the water. this quest will be original rogue quest levels of broke. but you seem like a developers wet dream with that reply, so i see why they made this quest
---
You're assuming it is played turn one. Instead you could just keep it and toss it into your cyclone combo. 
---
Wouldn't mind ditching a single copy of magic trick for this.
---
Duushig#2961 Asia trading 80 gold quest
---
yo ghazrillas time to shine!

---
Well, the first spell of this turn cost 0 indeed.
---
It should be in 15 minutes since that's the time where we got the brawl and quest yesterday.  
---
19:00 GMT
---
But you can also keep using it when you've run out of minions.  So not strictly worse or better.
---
New spells for solo adventure maybe?
---
Sort of... the HS team reveals specific cards for the upcoming expansion based on how many boss kills are done during this event. Most of the boss kills are the normal Tavern Brawl. If a Fireside Gathering takes down Rag, they earn 500 boss kills... so, it's mostly for fun.
---
I mean, if people make 1000 custom hearthstone cards - sooner or later some will look alike. However, they could very well have found inspiration from your creation.
---
Nic Cage legendary incoming?
---
I'm definitely curious if this will be considered better than Shamans hero power. Definitely a lot of pros and cons for each.
---
Warrior has the defensive tools to fully make use of infinite value meaning you can easily absorb some duds (like when you only roll kaboom and zap cannon several times in a row). Currently in standard Mage does not, so that dud turn where you get an evocation or tome of intellect would probably kill you
---
Did you really post this 45 minutes after the video came out, expecting that this hasn’t been posted here already?

---
holy shit, my friend plays casino mage, he will both nut at this card, and hate that is is glyph all over again
---
also any slow ass mage can use this and the quest to get a combo way later in the game
---
And it's targeted, and it doesn't hit your other minions.
---
actually seems good
---
Oh ok thanks its 19:45 at home lmao
---
Casino with giants, true dat!
---
unless you have no use for the spell
---
Yea, all things considered, I think it’s best to wait until the expansion drops before crafting anymore expensive cards.  
---
Guess I’ll just chill and play my decks as they are for the time being.  Thanks for all the info!
---
How is it so hard to comprehend that other people have different needs that you do ?
---
Like what's even to argue ?
---
More people have probably seen that movie poster than actually played hots
---
I'll go ahead and agree with you. Not everyone game out there has to be full of ongoing content. I paid for Diablo 3 and later paid for Reaper of Souls. With those two one time purchases I've received hundreds of hours of content.
---
I'm honestly sick of the live service trend. I'm very happy to receive set amount of rich and enjoyable content for my set amount of dollars.
---
My prayers have been answered!!
---
Would the spells cast by puzzle box of yogg saron be counted towards completing the quest??
---
SC is an aura buff, so they will come out as 2/2's.
---
&gt;It would be very unintuitive and against the design of this card if it didn't work that way.
---
Okay, but remember what game we're talking about.
---
you cant have 2 quests active, but yes :) cool fun deck
---
r/WeEatBees
---
Why do people think this is interesting content
---
Yay more random to lose to! I'm sure it's gonna feel great.
---
damn... damn son
---
This is quite an interesting card and I really like the “attack a minion” effect they’ve printed a few times now. Interaction with auras, “on summon” effects, and piercing certain buffs is quite a neat aspect of the card that has the drawback of needing board space to fully utilize.
---
Now Ive seen this card, i want to play mage mmore
---
Can the double qu’est deck be a thing?
---
Still nothing on EU...
---
To be fair I like this post more because it shows the hero power too :D
---
Well .... 
---
there are spells you can’t really play ( arcane intellect in late game or the new mags spell cost 10)
---
Don’t need to reduced 
---
Is more like a 60 good /40 bad
---
The card art is slightly misleading. You'd think the card is about some earth elemental or minion-eatery.
---
Because stuff like critical thinking and empathy are hard for some people.
---
So they end up going "it's not a problem for me so you're not allowed to complain". It occurs in pretty much everything.
---
A spell that does nothing when cast. Would much rather have any other card in that deck in my opening hand over this. Losing a mulligan slot is huge. And as others have said the quest reward is pretty pointless for what that deck wants to do. It’s not looking for long game value.
---
More importantly: can you *run* two quests at the same time?
---
I'd totally run both, mulligan away old quest, draw it and win it easy.
---
Mage looking like they're hitting the casino hard this expansion.
---
I'm thinking we're gonna be rich!
---
3 mana pocket galaxy is preeeetty good. Spellbender is also an excellent card to get off random generation. Most mage spells with a -2 mana cost discount (that you get to hold on to for future use, no less) are going to be better than a random boom hero power if you ask me.
---
compared to other "deal 4 to a minion" cards (Wild-format ones in italics): 
---
**Druid** -- Swipe: costs (4); can target any enemy; also AOEs his face and/or other minions for 1
---
**Hunter**
---
-- Snipe: costs (2); but it's a Secret so you can't target it
---
-- Marked Shot: costs (4) and also Discovers a spell
---
-- Wing Blast: costs (4) unless something died this turn, then it costs (1)
---
**Mage**
---
-- Scorch: costs (4) unless you played an Elemental last turn, then it costs (1)
---
-- *Ice Lance*: costs (1); can hit anything &amp; Freeze it; only deals the damage if it was already Frozen
---
-- *Flamecannon*: costs (2); hits a random enemy minion (so you gotta clear everything else to ensure it hits what you want)
---
-- *Dragon's Breath*: costs (5), but (1) for every minion that died this turn. So, sometimes free or cheap
---
**Priest** -- Holy Water: costs (5); if it kills the minion, add a copy of it to your hand
---
**Rogue**
---
-- Eviscerate: costs (2); only deals 4 if you set up the Combo first, e.g. with a Coin or Lackey
---
-- Vendetta: costs (4), unless you're holding a card from another class (e.g. via Pilfer), then it costs (4)
---
**Shaman**
---
 -- *Stormcrack*: costs (2); Overload by (1)
---
-- *Jade Lightning*: costs (4); summons a Jade Golem
---
-- *Tidal Surge*: costs (4); also restores 4 Health to your hero
---
**Warlock**
---
-- Soulfire: costs (1); also discards a card
---
-- Spirit Bomb: costs (1); also hits your hero for 4
---
-- Shadowbolt: costs (3)
---
-- *Fist of Jaraxxus*: costs (4) but can be free via Discard effects; targets a random enemy, so it might hit face instead of a minion
---
**Warrior**
---
-- Devastate: costs (1); target must be damaged already
---
-- Mortal Strike: costs (4); can hit for 6 if your hero's Health is 12 or under
---
**Neutral Minions**
---
-- Kaboom Bot: costs (3) for a 2/2; deals 4 randomly as a Deathrattle (can be foiled via Silence, transform or an empty board)
---
-- *Bomb Lobber*: costs (5) for a 3/3: deals 4 randomly as a Battlecry
---
-- Sunreaver Warmage: costs (5) for a 4/4; deals 4 as a Battlecry where you want it (even face) **if** you're holding a spell costing (5) or more
---
-- *North Sea Kraken*: costs (9) for a 9/7; deals 4 as a Battlecry where you want it (even face)
---
Use it to round up the lads.

All of the lads.

Forever.

How long have you been waiting to take that picture?
---
Yeah but that can be made up for with the 2/3 draw a card. Or you can just mulligan the quest and complete it over a couple big Cyclone turns later in the game.
---
I'm not sure it's good enough but it has potential. Definitely a very good tech card in specialist format.
---
I can see the point for artifact, but how's arena a bad thing?
---
You're reading this as I don't want new players to get stuff. Nowhere do I even hint at that. I also don't care that they got an old card back. I care that blizzard is both recycling old shit instead of creating new shit, and penalizing people who have played longer by not giving them anything. 
---
Take a step back. Look at how I've phrased everything.
---
It's basically "4 mana, deal 4 damage to a minion and regain 4 mana". But it actually nets you one additional mana if you kill the target. Its not a game winning combo, but a nice synergy to have.
---
CROOOOWS!!!
---
Wait, wait, wait, it says choose A minion. That means you can choose a friendly minion, which I suppose would summon the bees on your opponents board. Someone else please figure out synergies.
---
Eehhhh I'm not a fan. I say this as an extremely white man: he's *way too white*. Saying "it's bees" and smiling and ducking... that's too much for me, man.
---
People are going to get destroyed by lackeys and shaman hero power. In both classes on an empty hand, something like a sludge slurper will generate 2 lackeys from which you could potentially then generate 2 or 4 discovered spells.

If it were possible do you really think there is any chance we wouldn't have seen a priest mindgames on 1 to steal a quest and have 2 up?

Or they could only nerf troublesome cards like they did with Aviana?

I suppose some buffs to never seen wild cards wouldn't be bad either, but I wouldn't want that happening on a regular basis.

Both are priest.

What if the targeted minion is behind a Taunt?
---
Uh, you can absolutely play a 10 mana spell on turn 10 because it is reduced by 2. Press the button, get an 8 mana Pyro, play Pyro on face, ????, profit.
---
HS is supposed to be a fun, light-hearted game full of adventure and excitement. I'm almost 40 and I thought the guy did a great job expressing those themes. Old people can have fun too you know!
---
Very much a person opinion.  I played StS for about 10 hours, enjoyed it but got bored.  HS's deck builders have lasted far longer for me.
---
1 Mana cheaper, op
---
I did 4 runs. 8, 8, 7, and 7 bosses killed. That's all I can tolerate.
---
Can’t wait to get hit with 3 Pyroblast in the same game.

owo

How do we set the timer bot, I think this will see lots of play the first month and then get dropped.

You really want to play the new yogg card

Knife Juggler procs too!

More like hold my BEES!

Awesome card and fun.

---
Because store items aren’t taken seriously by the WoW community. It’s never about how something looks but how hard it was to get
---
Its not reduced by 2 mana. Its just one random spell a turn. You have to pay 2 to use your hero power and then it reduces it by 2. The spell will never be cheaper and if you get a 1 cost spell it will actually cost double.
---
Also for every time you luck into a board clear right when you need it there will be a dozen times you roll sense demons or deadly poison.
---
I'm out the loop.
---
Did Blizzard set a goal for an early release or something?!
---
*Nick Cage ragequits*
---
Woah dude calm down let’s not make it too overpowered here
---
it's really personal preference for me. I cant stand games that try to look real, aka most AAA games. I'm a fan of the cartoony art style like wow/league have.
---
No love for Killer Bees, even though that's how I beat Shandalar
---
Yeah maybe 20+ Azaris can't work, or can it?
---
Which I unfortunately did not find out until about a week ago when I doomed my run by dulpatransmorphing a bittertide hydra and viscous scaleworm zombiest only for my deck to get filled with hydras.
---
WHY SHAMAN
---
Yup, this will be a really good card for token decks and might tempt token druids to use cards like knife juggler or eggs more.  
---
    
---
But it could also be a combo piece if they print a high-cost minion with some ridiculously good effect every time it takes damage. But it would have to be amazing.

---
Next level plays.
---
Thanks.
---
Unlike the other dungeon adventures where the winning strategy is more often out live the bosses in this tavern you have to kill the boss before it kills you. Aka. make early game value plays. This is evident in the fact that the Max boss health is only 40 and the brawl rewards you from finishing fast. (&lt;40min For the best reward)
---
Didn’t expect to discover this reading this post. Thought I had already a golden copy of both of them. Thanks blizzard my efforts lead to less cards to play with.
---
&gt; but not easy because you had to build your whole deck around evens
---
You miss the point. If eel is in your hand it is active. The deckbuilding restriction is irrelevent to the context of the conversation being held which is "odds of being able to use the effect on curve".
---
If you have the eel in your hand then you can play it and its effect will go off. You don't have to worry about anything on board or comboing it with something else, it just works. For all itnets and purposes once the game starts the card reads "Battlecry: Deal 2 damage"
---
Rogue wins pretty easily. Just takes a while because of its insane card generation.

FTFY since it's not new

I am so lazy, I wake up 1 hour early to do nothing for 1 hour longer.

NA 80g trade, bridog#1893
---
not really a discard, the card we're referring to is the zero mana card
---
I mean, that's pretty much ghaz in a nutshell.  He lives, you die....he just rarely lives.  The one hit combos with emperor can be fun, though I haven't played a 1 shot deck with him in years at this point... I imagine it is much better than before now though.
---
I did that by getting three copies of "fill your hand with coins"
---
Blizzard gives us unplayable crap :  "Stop giving us crap, move the meta!"
---
Blizzard gives us good cards : "Stop making cards that define the meta!"
---
And no, there is no line between the two.
---
Based on the Q&amp;A answers, Kingsbane invalidating Control Matchups was a problem but they're absolutely 100% fine with Big Priest destroying the Archtype.
---
Play Brightwing in Wild and get really lucky
---
Imo warrior is extrremely easy. I think I won 4 out of the 5 runs with warrior. Just focus on using hero power (nearly) every turn and other things like elekk and armor that help your strategy of staying alive untill your opponent explodes.
---
Shit, I can't believe I didn't think of that!
---
Its almost as if people wouldnt want to go somewhere they have never been to meant an unkown number of strangers to play fucking hearthstone
---
Oooo I'm excited! I love quest decks.
---
I can’t believe how much shit about eggs and dire wolf alphas I had to read before I found the real meta-breaker in the comments.
---
For those wondering, I'm OP for this reddit post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cbljwk/tried\_a\_few\_times\_but\_finally\_got\_a\_sub\_19\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cbljwk/tried_a_few_times_but_finally_got_a_sub_19_as/). Been trying to slowly hone closer and closer to the sub 12 minute times that seems to be the fastest times atm. I'm willing to answer any questions this time around as I have more experience and time put into this brawl then yesterday.
---
It is but afaik no one knows what it actually means, pretty sure the farthest anyone’s got is that it’s been confirmed to be an acronym and that possibly all the participants in the league think it means something different than the other  (e.g Dr. Boom thinks it means volitive explosive inventors league)
---
A lot of people like to say that it’s “Every Villian Is Lemons” 
---
It’s hypothesized the meaning will reveal itself at a later time, but who knows, but maybe I’ve missed something I’m no mememaster.
---
Play Underbelly Ooze and then swarm it with bees for a particularly sticky board.
---
The topping is also cursed.
---
Mechanically, this is where I'm at too. Though it's kinda funny thematically at least. The idea of Reno raiding scrolls and just having absolutely no clue is very amusing.
---
&gt;You never EVER cut pocket galaxy. Like ever. It's top 5 cards in the deck. Pocket galaxy is absolutely insane.
---
Funny enough, this past weekend on Grandmasters, the casters (Frodan and TJ I think?) we’re discussing Pocket Galaxy. Apparently some pro players say it’s an outright terrible card, while others think it’s pretty good. Strong feelings all around.
---
I had a feeling the card worked that way. It explains why Shudderwock didn’t copy it at first.
---
&gt; That ignores how effectively removing a card from the game via a nerf can allow multiple previously unplayed cards to enter the meta.
---
True, that's also possible.
---
&gt; There's also the issue of obsoleting decks indirectly without offering any refunds like you'd get with nerfs.
---
Eh. That's a thing that can happen, but so is nerfing a common card that makes some legendary suddenly unplayable. You won't get your dust back for that legendary, either. The system isn't perfect.
---
&gt; Buffs are less accurate in that regard and run the risk of directly creating problematic cards.
---
It's a possibility, but so far that hasn't happened, has it? Again, we have one card that can even be considered problematic, and that's arguable.
---
Seriously if this expansion doesn’t buff control decks across the board it will be another season of brain dead aggro decks.
---
Warrior.
---
Is this real?
---
Scuffed. It should be called BEEES???
---
Okay I log into, oh look it's a card this will fit nicely in this warrior deck. Some people dont look at every single card that comes out in every single expansion. I have been playing since beta(I did take a break) and I still dont know every single card in every single expansion. Now yes if I was very high up in ranked I expect that players would be more aware of cards and I would see it more often but not at low ranks. My point also wasnt how it was acquired it that it is I standard, if you wanna play crazy stuff there is a wild mode for a reason.
---
except infinite value
---
26 minutes on mobile with bomb warrior, first try. Seemed pretty easy
---
&gt;not true or cosmetics wouldn't be a thing.
---
Why not? players like them. My point is that *you* like the cosmetics you have and might enjoy your collection/favourites, etc. Other players do not know or care what your collection or favourites are.
---
And you say my opinion isn't unpopular but here I am getting downvoted lol.
---
Pretty boring. Random card generation is not such an exciting mechanic IMO
---
Someone giving their opinion.
---
You: Don't do that.
---
Me
---
I would not use the word corporate. Corny is probably the closest word to the word I was going to use. But white still gets the point across. You understood it, didn't you?
---
Use the evil tech company .Com and search it.
---
No it will go to a basic one, keep the 200.
---
Interesting... Right after the interview in which they said they "learned their lesson" about infinite value, and that the new Quests' rewards would NOT be infinite value... \^\^
---
but after implosion you have imps... after this your bees are dead
---
If I recall correctly, those are usually set and not random. I got the same two you describe, for example. So you probably won't get a different legendary quest
---
I can’t tell if he is hunky cute guy or adorable teacher.
---
Same lol not sure why people are complaining
---
This card isn't even an issue. You are dumb
---
&gt;The system isn't perfect.
---
I didn't say it was, but at least it *allows* for that potential and has done so in the past.
---
&gt;It's a possibility, but so far that hasn't happened, has it?
---
No, but we're talking about nerfing and buffing in general, and in regards to addressing balance issues in a meta, nerfs are better than buffs in pretty much every way.
---
Ye I'm bored of seeing that class going full random too. You're not even playing your deck, the deck itself gives you another random deck that sometimes can work, and sometimes just tells you to gtfo walk your dog. I'd rather play anything else that is consistent even though I've been liking mage a hundred times more than all other classes since the beginning of Hearthstone.
---
I am disappointed.
---
You can beat ragnaros earlier though. I did it turn 2 with hand of rafaam, double starting boom bot treasure, and a 24/24 Edwin off bag of coins.
---
Yes, but we see the mage quest reward. While none of the "infinite" value we bitch about is actually infinite, that hero power is the same crap we call infinite.
---
Online, from my home, sitting at my desk, comfortable. Notice how i am not out at fuck knows where surrounded by an unpredictable number of people i do not know? see the huge diffrence there?  
---
Look i do not care that much about this specific content personally but it is just really fucking stupid to me to lock it away like that. For those that do want to to play it but cant get to a gathering it is a problem tho and they shouldnt lock away actual content like that.  
---
That said if YOU like gatherings then by all means go to them, enjoy yourself and have a blast man.  
---
Honestly i wonder how many people have no idea gatherings are even a thing or that you can get a hero or do this at them.
---
Looked up MtG Bee Sting. How does that exist in the same game as MtG Lightning Bolt? Jesus, and people think the strictly worse cards in Hearthstone are bad.
---
What the hell lol. Have you tried closing and re-opening the app?
---
No, not really. The corniest man I know is hispanic.
---
Not a fan of that design. I thought the Druid and Warlock quests were much more reasonable with no infinite value attached to them. I suspect people are going to start severely hating on this in about 2 months, just like for the DKs.
---
I can’t really see this bringing mage up to be a suitable climbing deck unless there will also be more tempo cards to support it.
---
Control shaman is nearly a 50/50 split so far against control warrior, with all the new cards and quest it would most likely have the majority, it certainly won’t lose hard
---
What are you doin with those stacks of 40 packs friend?
---
Damn, what kind?
