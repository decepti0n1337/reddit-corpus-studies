Yeah, they had a lot of strong cards for turn 1 and turn 3. I get that the hero power is strong but it can only do so much.
---
---
---
They didn't receive any cards from Boomsday and Rastakhan and their best cards are rotating out.
---
His sister is laughing at his small dick :0
---
They pushed the spell theme pretty hard for Priest in these last 2 years. I assume Priest will go back to deathrattle stuff or maybe a thief Priest route if Talanji decks will be supported.
---
I thought this was aMTG meme for a second before seeing the art and subreddit
---
Odd warrior keeping almost everything is worrying, already dull as ditchwater to play as or against. 
---
What is "Grimy Goons?"
---
I mean what have they done the last 4 years on the anniversary? nothing afaik
---
If I had a penny for all the games I've won against odd warriors using reckless flurry at awful times and effectively killing themselves...
---
I wonder if - in case they ever do 3-class cards again - they will be in the same groups.
---

---
Maybe it could also be 
---
Hunter, Druid, Shaman (the nature gang)
---
Warlock, Rogue, Warrior (the shady/dark and edgy ones)
---
Paladin, Mage, Priest (the light and goody-two-shoes boys &amp; girls)
---
Or country, rock/metal, pop (or classic?)
---
Year of the Mammoth, in particular Un'Goro was huge for your "minion fillers". How many decks have Fire Fly, Tar Creeper, Stonehill, Vicious Fledgling in them?     
---
Knight's of the Frozen Throne was undoubtedly huge for individual classes, but the neutrals from Un'Goro have seen so much play and still do. Those will be big losses for many decks.
---
It doesn't have to be an either or. 
---
Cold blood could go fuck itself but flametongue was a good boy
---
It's actually fair for everyone else, but Blizzard code it to be unfair for you specifically. Sorry
---
Warlock is dead!
---
Long live warlock!
---
Im enjoying secret paladin with fakari battle axe and chargers, sucks the 2 life leech ones are rotating out.
---
But apart from those two units its got plenty of reach and defense! Quite fun.
---
Realistically, itll be a few days after when a reddit thread hits front page about how nothing was done
---
This isn't precisely an order of play situation, that applies to ordering effects within the same phase. Whenever triggers are an earlier phase than the spell's effects, so the outcome is the same.
---
Wish I can empathise but the communication with the community is almost non existent. We can even get simple clarifications for event start/end timings, the need to clear our quest log, etc.

They could use cards from those sets, they just are weaker options than mammoth cards. Which is also the case for almost every other deck in the meta.
---
A perfect example is the Mech version of Odd Pally. It's a solid deck, just not as good as the regular version. When everyone else also loses strong Mammoth cards, Genn/Baku decks will still be able to rely on the HP

With power levels dropping as much as they should be, there's a really good chance for an aggressive/mid-range Druid deck to come out of it. 
---
I think people are getting pretty sick of crafting expensive legendaries just to have the cards that are built around them nerfed so that they don't even get a dust refund. I'm honestly surprised there wasn't more outrage about the Saronite Chain Gang nerf. Shudderwock shaman had like 7 legendary cards in it, half of which are relevant outside of that deck.
---
True grumble is pretty worthless now and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best solution, just the one they are going with now. I‚Äôd be surprised to see a large direct nerf to genn/Baku and if there is that is going to be interesting for future nerfs

What if they had given baku to 3 classes, genn to another 3, and created another legendary with a restriction for the last 3. You could start off with 1 more mana or something

In short, no. Team 5, Blizzard, Activision, someone we don't know of, is deathly afraid of making changes to this game. Tournament mode, observer mode, stat tracking, deck organization, game modes, sealed mode, cosmetics, anything that requires an extra screen or extra check box they won't do.

Oow thanks. Ive been waiting for this expansion for years. Now I can finally play it.
---
not a Battlecry per se, but we do it when the card hits the field:
---
**Put your faith in the light!**
---
*you about to get rekt, son*
---
Fun fact, did you know that the Jade Lotus are the 3 "ramp" classes?
---
* Druid is obvious (Wild Growth etc)
---
* Rogue accesses many cards that grant coins, and also has Preparation
---
* Shaman's Overload mechanic is a weird "built-in ramp" allowing access to big stats ahead of curve (Totem Golem, Flamewreathed Faceless, Earth Elemental) and they also have Far Sight.
---
I think midrange hunter is pretty cheap if you forego rexxar which I would recommend as he rotates in April
---
Nice üòé
---
The mechanic I hate the most is mass res, especially if it can be controlled like wall priest, clone priest and guldan
---
Hi, do you still have the quest for trade (Kurgan#1785, NA)?
---
First we don't know if the opponent saw it, and second I don't know what advantage it might give the opponent
---
Kurgan#1785, NA, trading 80g quest. I've done it before.

I had the same problem. Relogging and setting the cardback before playing any games fixed it. See if that works for ya
---
"Rogue"
---
Not an otk as it required previous set up. Cool win though. 
---
Yeah, it needs a loooot of niche legendaries.  Thankfully the end game can be kind of altered and played with, to make it less expensive if need be.  But still... not cheap.
---
Ohemgee your right. I hope this card becomes s classic. It always requires proper set up never feels busted but is clearly a warlock card. Super well designed for the class
---
I play a Renounce Warlock deck full of spells + Barnes, Y'Shaarj and Yogg-Saron for late game lulz.

I imagine people get pleasantly surprised when the terrible tragedy ends up being a 1/1 Yogg. :D

55% is 250 games. You could just click the link and see the graph. It's 12.5 hours of game time if each match lasts 3 minutes.

so, not neutral either.
---
Why lab recruiter?
---
To be honest, you seem to have little understanding of deckbuilding at the moment. You play a lot of cards that are weak individually and would only see play if they have strong support, which your deck doesn't offer them. (1) You also play some cards that are outright bad, and will likely never see play in the "better" decks. (2) You do have a bit of discard synergy, but not enough for it to give you a gameplan. (Be aware that people have been trying to take advantage of discard for ages, but it was rarely good.)
---
I suggest you start of by playing (cheap) lists that you find online and try to understand why they are good, and why they include certain cards. Then attempt modifications of these decks, if you feel some other card would work well in them. This way you get to experiment without going on a losing streak, because the deck will stay reasonably strong. If you have to replace some cards that you don't own, try to understand why the cards in the list are chosen above your replacement, and what they would offer to the deck.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
(1) These cards are, at least:
---
* Bloodbloom (Using it for SS or TN is inefficient removal as you spend two cards (and life) to deal with a situation, consider crafting \[\[Defile\]\] which is very efficient removal that you can play early.)
---
* Void Analyst (You don't have a lot of cheap (!) demons that would profit from it. You would want to play \[\[Doubling Imp\]\] at the very least, as it gets twice the buff.)
---
* Questing Adventurer (You'd want to have a lot of cheap generated/drawn cards in your hand, like from \[\[Fire Fly\]\]. It even has anti-synergy with your discard effects.)
---
* Tanglefur Mystic (You'd play it only if you get much more value from a random 2-drop than the average opponent, which I don't see a reason to assume.)
---
* Fiendish Circle (You'd play it if you have more cards that buff or otherwise take advantage of tokens (small (generated) minions), like \[\[Knife Juggler\]\].)
---
* Sunborne Val'kyr (You'd play this in a deck that generates a lot of tokens to keep them alive against removal. For instance, it does have synergy with Fiendish Circle, but the imps are not important enough to warrant protecting them.)
---
* Mechanical Whelp (You'd play this if you had any effect that triggers deathrattles, like \[\[Carnivorous Cube\]\], or if you had (mech) buff effects that took advantage of the 2/2 body if your opponent doesn't want to kill it, like \[\[Zilliax\]\] or \[\[Wargear\]\]. Deathwing has synergy but doesn't cut it.)
---
(2) They are:
---
* Shieldbearer (You do not need a taunt on turn one as your opponent won't have threatening minions and you don't have minions that need protection, which is why 1-mana taunts don't see play. Voildwalker is an exception because it is also a 1/3. 1/3 is much better than 0/4 because it can take trades and give you board dominance.)
---
* Green Jelly (It's a fun effect, but too expensive for 5 mana as it gets easily cleared at this point in the game with just 3 health.)
---

Eternal formats in magic are constantly banning cards.
---
Dorian will survive rotation and Illidan is Classic. I wouldn‚Äôt dust any legendaries from Raven or Classic sets ahead of rotation: you never know what kind of support we‚Äôre going to get. And I certainly wouldn‚Äôt dust anything now just to build up a war chest for April.
---
Does this card keep buffs when discarded?
---
Thanks a lot. Exactly what I was looking for. 
---
Hell yes! All the Jekliks in my hand are 11/12! üòà
---
So I should only dust stuff from un'goro, knights of the frozen throne or kobolds and catacombs right?
---
Do you think Baku is worth crafting then or should I just wait for now and see if there will be a legendary I absolutely need?
---
If you‚Äôre strictly F2P (although the number of legendaries you‚Äôve accumulated suggests you‚Äôre buying packs too) I wouldn‚Äôt craft a card that‚Äôs about to rotate and I certainly wouldn‚Äôt dust legendaries to do it. You‚Äôll want that dust when the new set comes out.
---
I would wait until rotation to see what to craft. Cannot emphasize enough that we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in store for us.
---
Kalimos also has a non legendary effect in a legendary card.
---
Every effect it does is a 4 mana effect:
---
- cast Fireball face
---
- cast Whispering Woods
---
- cast Greater Healing Potion
---
- cast a sorta of Lightning Storm
---
Can I make a recommendation for your next one? 
---
Guldan.
---
True, but you also have big board clears like Light Bomb and Dragonfire Potion as epic (besides Psichyc Scream). 
---
The issue starts when the numbers are simply broken like lets see rexxar: 6 mana 2dmg AOE like blizzard, 5 armor gain and then you got infinite value with access of cards that actually can keep you in the game indefinitely (lifesteal/poisonous+rush/charge, cards that let you evade fatigue by adding cards to your deck, infinite amount of threats...).
---
Another issue comes from the fact that blizzard barely releases any cards to let us interrupt the enemies gameplay. Only warlock has for exmaple the ability to make the opponent discard cards or access their hand by demonic project.

In wild , back in the days it was even worse lol, even after 20-30 seconds.  only good part about that was countering them with a counter deck or tech. I wonder if it's still the same or have it improved or only worsen.
---
I still remember the  same pirate warrior and secret paladin that i met countless time. 
---
Finished
---
Yeah but the way you can choose one of them is the cool part. A legendary that requires setup and offers 4 different outcomes when you play him. This is cool design.
---
For nothing .. exactly the end I'm looking for
---
Am a new player deckslots confuse me
---
Thinking face
---
The new RR TB quests is in a new direction though, right? Play 3 TB matches, get the RR pack
---
ye but in the previous turn he was alive and this turn hes dead so he killed him in one turn
---
Good write-up, as usual. I don't think there's much else to be said within the scope of the current Standard format and rotation. There are, however, other ways to combat staleness and keep players enganged with the game when the inevitable late-expansion lull hits: please give us more formats!
---
Barkskin is a K&amp;C card, and it was pretty powerful combined with Pyromancer and Acolyte of Pain. I honestly don't have high hopes for the deck after the rotation (or most meta decks for that matter), but I am NOT looking forward to a Tank Up meta.
---
But i want to be in wild so for me make this deck is kinda ok
---
thanks
---
Holy shit I genuinely didn't notice any of these. This post is awesome!
---
Huh? How does the Innkeeper help when watching an HS video? Or does the Innkeeper work for that?
---
I don't really understand this, tbh. I'm not trying to come off as arrogant or anything, but mostly just trying to understand. Because, if an OTK requires no setup, then what counts as an OTK?
---
So, the Maly Druid OTK with (pre-nerf) Aviana and Kun, would that not count as an OTK? As far as I know, you have to draw into the cards, make some board space, and get your opponent's Health low enough, all of which I would define as setup.
---
Really the question is: if an OTK is a kill that can be done in one turn with no setup, then does Hearthstone really have any OTKs?
---
A nice compromise might be to let players use any cards they want in friendly battles against people on their friends list, in the singleplayer content, and in the Tavern Brawls, but restrict players to using cards in their collection on ranked and casual ladder.

Plenty of people would spend $40 per expansion to get all the cards, but plenty of people already spend like $80 per expansion to get **some** of the cards and then more on packs later. The cost of playing the game is absurd (and it's why I haven't put a cent in since the expansion before the one with Whizbang) but it's working for them clearly. You'd have a hard time convincing me that they'd make more money on your model than their current model, even though I agree that it would be a better game with more meta diversity.
---
Wolfrider + hero power is the same mana as leeroy and only 1 damage less. Leeroy is always a reasonable craft, but unless your flush with dust, you don‚Äôt always need every single card from a net deck.
---
The design space of MTG is way bigger (more mechanics and more ways for mechanics to interact with each other - e.g. Planeswalkers, Instants) and the designers get more creative with their designs than the HS designers do IMO.
---
sad troll, let me tell you a secret...
---
no one cares 
---
I have a meme deck when I use early game deathrattle to cheat out corrupted blood by turn 7.
---
I started the game when old gods launched and I had the sandbox feeling you described just a few months into the game back then. I was completely free to play except one Amazon coin deal. I even saved up gold for Kharazan and over time Blackrock Mountain and League of Explorers. I had the most fun during the Gadgetzan meta. Without really investing money, I could play multiple fun and to some extend even competitive decks. Nowadays I get the pre order bundle usually and some packs here and there and constantly feel like I'm missing something. The increase of meta relevant epics is an issue as well. I think it truly started to be an issue when there were 2 class legendaries each set. With the swingy powerlevel nature of legendary cards you end up crafting necessary or even playable ones much more. 
---
I don't want OTK players to have the satisfaction of actually playing their combo.
---
He didnt let me hit for 48 but yes
---
"Everything is ODDsome!"
---
Good job haha
---
i see, legendaries that interact together and can be pair with one another, nice idea
---
Oh dang, TIL
---
Congrats. I'd be tempted to grind to legendary rank but it's just not worth the stress.
---
The last time I got serious about it I had a game in the back at rank 3, when suddenly my Internet crapped out when I had lethal (this was while on vacation, so my Internet was much shoddier). It effectively cost me 2 stars because I had 2 instead of the 4 I had earned at that rank, and then I went on a big losing streak after that, which made me decide it wasn't worth it.
---
it will be probably HS in Marvel world, so playing with cards like Iron man Spiderman their villains etc they got funded like 30 mio USD so i hope it will be good.
---
No joke, Kibler‚Äôs Dragon Elemental Krag‚Äôwa Shaman is pretty good. I‚Äôve been switching between janky Homebrew (as if Mech is hard to homebrew lmao) Mech Shaman aggro in Wild and Kibler‚Äôs deck in Standard to try and grind out the golden portrait. I‚Äôm currently at Rank 3, and while I‚Äôm not motivated to push for Legend these days, maybe it‚Äôll just happen naturally as I play with the deck.  
---
Nice! Combodecks need to exterminated!

---
At first I was like: What a shitty pol, these answers suck. When I was halfway I realised it was a joke XD
---
No it doesnt deal 0 damage, it doesnt deal damagr
---
To be continued
---
Thought this as well!
---
He‚Äôs not in charrrge now!
---
It's not a 0+2. Priest hero power has NO damage value. No damage whatsorver
---
Introduce cards that ‚Äúupgrade your hero power this turn‚Äù ‚Äúif you played an even cost card last turn‚Äù and ‚Äúyour hero power costs 1 this turn‚Äù ‚Äúif you played an odd cost card last turn‚Äù
---
Or perhaps for rogue, ‚ÄúBattlecry: equip a 2/2 weapon if you played an even cost card last turn‚Äù
---
Paladin: ‚ÄúBattlecry: Summon two silver hand recruits if you played an even cost card last turn‚Äù
---
Now for genn!
---
That's really not clear from the text.
---
Two MORE damage. So it would have to be dealing damage in the first place to receive a damage buff.
---
The best explanation is that if you have spell power, your healing spells don't suddenly deal damage.
---
So it's not that your HP deals 0+2 damage, it doesn't even have that 0 damage variable to add the extra 2 to.

I think one card that doesn't get enough discussion is fire fly. Particularly in odd secret mage i find that it improves the curve of an otherwise top heavy deck. I wonded if it will simply make all decks have a worse early curve or if classes with good one drops like paladin and warlock will pull ahead.
---
Overall though half the ungoro cards feel like they should be classic weve been playing with them soo long.
---

Dope app, would love a dark mode. A deck editor tool would be nice too, but not really essential. Overall your app is very nice.
---
It's fine man. People get missunderstoood over the internet and it blows up into this huge thread of angry comments all the time, I get it. And yea its is a pretty common topic but this is my first post to Reddit ever and it was just something on my mind I guess. I appreciate your maturity about it though :) 
---
It's pretty clear. If it deals any damage then it'll specify actual values. You can't just imply that cards which don't have any damage specification automatically deal zero damage. 
---
Papa bless
---
I have the mods at gunpoint, their last resort was to change my flair
---
This sub lost its shit when they went to 3 expansions a year. If they went to even 4, people would lose their minds about pay to win, let alone 6 to 8.
---
We got double nerfs for the first time ever and people are complaining about their decks being hit.
---
There is no one right answer. You are going to tick people off no matter what. 
---
The optimal model most people seem to think would be a totally free game with updates every 2 or 3 weeks. And that's a horrid business model
---
Tavern Brawl. Card rotations. Dungeon Run.
---
Sure, there is room for more, but to say nothing has changed is just stupid.
---
Both decks deserve to die 
---
Even Warlock loses all of its healing. No spellstone, no shroom brewer, no beetle, no death knight. And speaking of the death knight, you essentially can just never win against control decks if you don't cheese them with mountain giants since you can't fall back on lategame value. You also lose defile meaning you also lose against aggro as well.
---
You can nerf Odd Rogue by making the hero power a 2/1 weapon. You can nerf Odd Mage by making the hero power only target minions. You can nerf Odd Warrior by making the armor gain 3. You can nerf Odd Paladin by making it only summon one 2/1 or 2/2 minion. All of these changes can be done without adding some weird widespread nerf on Baku.
---
Genn doesn't need any widespread nerfs to the card either. Even Paladin is hard to judge on how to nerf if it becomes too widespread because it's losing a lot of core legendaries with the rotation, but something like hitting Tarim is an easy way to nerf it. Even Shaman you can just nerf murkspark to deal only 1 damage.
---
Casual player here and I'm having a blast. Really like the changes to ladder. Playing the same small amount of games but I am actually making progress on climbing now.
---
I stand by my comment. 
---
30-45 minutes a night is tons of time. Average 3 games a day for a month, that's 90. 60% win rate is 54 wins-36 losses, or +18 differential. **Not even counting win streak bonuses** and assuming a low win rate (60% for a T1 deck is low at that rank honestly) +18 wins is more than enough to maintain / increase your rank month to month.
---
If you can't get past rank 14 playing a tier 1 deck, it's not a dedication issue. You are making fundamental mistakes and would benefit from some study / reviews of your games. 
---

&gt; I have to face your zero skill requiring auto pilot deck on pretty much every second match. Can you please grow a set of skills and proceed upwards from rank 15, which I could do my eyes closed on your broken deck, so that the rest of us can have some more fun at the lower ranks.
---
I will translate:
---
Hey, players. Why do you play "good" decks in a competitive ladder play mode that rewards people for winning? I cant understand, why do you want to win so much in a mode that rewards you with gold and golden cards and dust after the end of the month for your victories? I cant comprehend it. Could you please dont use the collection you have adquired trough work, effort, time and/or money, and instead handicap yourself so that I can win without having to put work, time, effort or money into the game? Its just the fair thing to do. Also, just because you are playing a good deck, it probably means you guys are worse than me, and in equal conditions, I am sure I could win, because my IQ is higher than you *brain damaged ape that was lobotomized*.
---
Damn, this posts are gold.
---
Salto-masochism. 
---
Until they literally stop making expansions, probably not. But honestly, having almost 70% of the cards in the game without spending any money is impressive. Honestly, I get that it can be frustrating from the collector‚Äôs angle, but realistically you‚Äôll only need about 40% of the cards in the game at most to keep up with the meta.
---
Priest blew his load, no more divine spirit shenanigans, mage still has plenty of cards left and frost lich hero power. Should be fine.
---
Is this a question?
---
I have an idea that after you use your hero power it switches between upgraded and normal. 
---
What do you think?
---
Kripp? Is that you?
---
dont forget the zilliax
---
Streamers also commonly play meme decks, I don't think they're to blame at all really.
---
Mods..
---
Now that I think about, most decks which are anywhere near competitive deserve to die
---
Looks like Thok
---
&gt;For you, it sounds like you enjoy the social aspects of games like this a lot. Which is great. I encourage you to find more experiences like that. Within that context you're freer to enjoy non-game aspects (like seeing friends and eating together), as well as impose other informal rules on play (like deck restrictions or something similar). 
---
Ha I wish! Like I said, Pandora's box. I play this game to win. Due to the lack of a lot of different formats, the way laddering works and rewards are tied to it I play to win. 
---
That said, I know there are a lot of people who don't. They are where I was with m:tg 15 years ago. For those people things most likely aren't stale or stagnating and they are truly enjoying the game. I envy those folks. 
---
Legit!! Thanks!
---
How about Deathwing? How many times do you get to turn 10+, and consider playing him? He might very well be a dead card in your hand, even if you happen to run Jeklik at some point in this deck.
---
If you are looking for a late game dragon, swap Deathwing for either Ysera or Alexstrasza. Alex is more consistent, as burn or midrange decks use it to get your health lower for upcoming burst damage, and some control decks use her to help sustain/put out a threat in the late game. Ysera usually gets removed pretty quickly, and can sometimes add not as powerful Dream cards to your hand.
---
And card draw in hand... What are they worried about? 
---
You bet your sweet ass I'd like to see a neutral taunt that gets played in over 50% of the decks. Black Knight is going to shine in all its former glory (don't wake me up please)

---
Yea this is really fun when it happens. I think there were some nerfs too that happened just before a rotation so we got a few days of a tweaked meta.
---
I mean, when volcanosaur dropped just seeing 1 new card in a few decks felt good. 
---
I guess the icy winds of northrend consumed your opponent's soul.
---
What about Ziliax 
---
Rank 20 play right there.
---
Sure, I'm just saying that if you don't want to spend the dust on leeroy right now, wolfrider + hero power is nearly as good.
---
This post made my day, if you hate the deck that lots of people are playing right now (I‚Äôm basing this off of the post, I don‚Äôt play standard so I wouldn‚Äôt know) then maybe take a break from the game instead of blowing your salty load onto reddit and making yourself look like an immature child.
---
No he's just been spamming this on this sub for the past 2 days. I have no idea what the fuck he's doing.

I wish there was an attack all to face button

Mby i don't play enough these days ... wall priest isn't new, i've seen the deck before but was just a worse version of the priest decks we all knew (and hate).

Thank you for this list

Most players are probably like 12, what do you expect accepting requests straight after a match?  
---
Never accept them unless you want to have a good ole laugh at the rage or just want to troll them to make them even angrier.  
---
Infinite value is just fine if its slow enough that aggro can easily punish it.
---
My wild casual experience is definitely mostly janky decks butting heads. But it really depends. If you play silly decks, you'll lose against anyone who plays serious decks, and eventually your MMR will be bad enough to only play against other true casuals. If you try-hard in casual, you'll end up bumping into others who do the same.
