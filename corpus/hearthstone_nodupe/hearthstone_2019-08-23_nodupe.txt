If you actually take a look at the core Priest class identity you'd see that damage is actually really important to it. It's just half a class now.
---
---
---
&gt;Loosing 1 Health or Divine Shield on every minion you play is a huge deal.
---

---
When you're using minions are removal spells, it really doesn't matter.
---
&gt;It allows you to avoid Rogue removal ([Backstab](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/backstab.png), [Walk the Plank](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/walk-the-plank-card-art.png), and a couple of wild cards)
---
It wouldn't matter any way. The Control Warrior is throwing their minions at yours by the time Dr. Boom is dropped.
---
&gt;[Plague of Wrath](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Plague-of-Wrath.png): ALWAYS kills ALL your minions
---
Plague of Wrath is usually played after a Warpath anyway as far as I can tell.
---
&gt;Promotes an Self Damaging Agro Architype for Warrior
---
Enrage Warrior wouldn't want to play a card like Dr. Boom, Mad Genius in the first place. Seven mana for a card that does't win the game on its own is too slow for that deck. Overlord's Whip isn't even seeing play in that deck. Instead, the deck prefers Livewire Lance despite it having two fewer durability since Lackeys are just good.
---
Warrior itself already has an easy enough time hurting their own stuff since the deck is doing better than expected.
---
&gt;Changing the Mana cost will change the Hero's initial 777 design (Mana cost, armor gain, armor heropower = 7). That is fitting for his rng based heropower that cycles just like a slot machine (777 is the jackpot). Hopefully you realized this in the hero's initial design. 
---
Sometimes flavor needs to take a back seat to function.
---
Your proposed nerf were do absolutely nothing to affect just how often the card is seeing play. Plus, if you're assertion that it would start being used in the Aggressive Warrior deck turned out to be turn, the card would have just received a buff.
---
r/hearthstone: *makes joke*
---
le epic memers: "lE oUtJeRkEd AgAiN!!!"
---
Yes yes yes. Do it.
---
Ya that's what I got
---
I never thought of it that way. That's pretty clever.
---
Yes
---
Should have made More Arms cost 2. Make people pay 1 mana for the flexibility, not 2. They know this card is barely playable at 3.
---
I was just on a rant, only read your title. Sorry bud .
---
If they nerf IF/DS then Priest is dead class for the forseeable future. How about they give Priest new viable win conditions that survive rotation before they destroy the only one left? I do think it is pretty unfair that Mage and Warrior get to run wild for months while Priest's new good deck gets immediately nerfed. Doesn't surprise me though since blizzard always does that to Priest.
---
Odd Warrior hard-counters any Hunter except Cube Hunter according to VS. That's my experience too as Odd Warrior player. Sure DK Rexxar was annoying, but he wasn't auto-winning against Boom. Odd Warrior could overrun Deathstalker Rexxar and remove his big minions (1 mana shieldslam/dragon package). Because Hunters don't have Boardclears they lose.
---
Odd Mage is considered Tier 3, while Odd Warrior Tier 1 in Rastakhan Rumble's VS report. According to the data nobody stomps Odd Mage harder than Odd Warrior.
---
The reason why Odd Warrior favors over Odd Mage is because Mage can only generate Elements if there is 1 health minion. Without it, Mage does nothing more than 1 damage a turn, Warrior doesn't need to play minion, it only needs to stack armor and watch Mage loses in Fatigue damage.
---
So, full dust refund, right?
---
Also you can put it in an odd deck, but that only matters for wild ofc
---
Maybe theyll listen for once.
---
We don’t see the data the blizzard does. It’s my understanding that if left unnerfed priest would have have been the highest win rate deck in the meta, so much so that it would have been oppressive.
---
mountain giant was never a problem before CC.  Mountain giants were played in even lock and there was no problem with that deck. It was strong, but not nerf worthy.  In other words no one saw a problem with giants for even lock at that time.
---
Whizbang at least occupies a sensible niche as that limited demo for each new expansion, especially while people are still playing around to figure out what’s good. 
---
Zayle is shockingly pointless by comparison even to Whizbang. If they don’t intend to furnish Zayle-style cards that get released midway through an expansion with reasonably good decks, they should at least make them “refundable.” The devs seemed to want to use Zayle as promotional hype for the Dalaran Heist, so it’s unclear why they’d want people to feel bitten by it.
---
Well I don't want to ruffle too many feathers but a murloc deck shouldn't stand a chance against a control warrior. Boom or no boom.
---
I don't think luna's pocket galaxy would be that good if Conjurer's calling didn't exist. It might be able to exist at 5 mana if that card wasn't also in standard.
---
I saw the comment on that post. Hilarious to see it as it’s own post now.
---
I think removing the mech tag on omega would have been enough.  Its still an incredibly strong card that way and not discoverable.  Currently its a 4 mana deal 10 damage battlecry with a deal 4 damage to another minion as well.  Its just busted.
---
What I’ve found is Warrior can be rushed down as long as they don’t get massive value from their control cards in particular Brawl.  If they can kill 5-8 minions with 1 or 2 Brawls it lets them stabilize so their ultimate value kicks in.
---
These look awesome, super pleased
---
I'm proud of the new blizzard team for letting us try playing  with the buffs,  then reversing them because of the community response. They're definitely only trying to make the game more enjoyable for everyone. A response could have been to buff other classes to match the power level and result in a huge power creep, but they did a much more humble thing in admitting their mistakes.
---
Let's hall of fame all 5+ cost minions cause of galaxy as well.
---
All good mate. I myself dislike the idea of a cosmetic coating 80 bucks. Why not just give the option to buy them in the shop for 10 or less. + I just really like rafaam as a character and all, would just really like to see him as a possible hero you could choose
---
Why stop at 20 when you can go for 30? /s
---
Not joking, I have a decent winrate with that meme of a deck
---
I'd prefer to let the format play out first before becoming complete doom and gloom.
---
If anything, the card probably won't be a mulligan keep any more when priced at nine mana.
---
I do not dislike you as a person but Gods do I wish you queue into nothing but Reno Decks that slam Geist on turn 6 every game or just Mecha'thun Warlock.
---
A bit disingenuous to call it “cheaper” when it doesn’t do the effect until you’re at 10 mana. Vilespine was ran in tempo/aggro decks whereas Omega Devastator would never be ran in a tempo/aggro deck. They’re very different cards, honestly
---
Is there a link to these top decks? I’ve been playing with a homebrew priest deck that has been tons of fun but I would love to see about optimizing it.
---
2 mana nerf means 2 turns for faster decks to defeat warrior, and it also means that they will have to play a 9 mana gain 7 armor in order to get the effects. It is a big nerf to CW against faster decks imo. Just because in one game CW have the luck to draw all his removal against you does not mean that it happens all the time.
---
Hey haven't played the game in almost 2 years just wondering if someone would look at my deck and which cards i should dust.
---
They definitely dont encourage it, but aggro could definitely see a rise as usual
---
it'll be easier for you if you just don't stay stupid shit on the internet
---
Do you really care if your first half of CC is 5 mana when your giant is now 0?
---
Reno mage can still win games where LPG doesn’t get played. They just have to run a less greedy, more value-oriented deck.
---
Yea the card that is designed to destroy secrets shouldn’t trigger them.
---
NA. Veer#1637 
---
Looking to trade 80g quest. Can show proof if you want
---
This is sort of a big deal for combo priest. Hes right. Being able to drop a damaged one 2 cost minion , cleric t2 or something next into extra arms, especially with light wardens and damaged enemy minions on the board with healing circle...gg. Your warden is tko in a turn.
---
! Lmao some of the scenarios that played out have been insane for me. It has been pretty incredible and I enjoyed it while it lasted! But I am also excited to see a little slower priest with some more dominant cards because those two damaged minions and wardens were pretty boring to play tbh lol.
---
There's plenty of interactions in the game that have just been written off as "well, once you see it for the first time you know forever". Like, what is a Dream card, what the hell do these quests even give, why is Jaraxxus different from the other hero cards, etc.
---
This wouldn't cause too many problems I feel.
---
Sorry but that doesn't make sense. Counterspell stops flare from activating. Flare can't destroy counterspell because flare can't activate while counterspell is up. This isn't hard to understand
---
No other deck is producing that kind of minion on turn 2 in standard... it's a 3/5 that can snowball further on turn 3 with more buffs or survive and draw a card with a heal....
---
Now I don't think cleric is as busted as Mana wyrm but with cheap health buffs? Absolutely. Mana wyrm usually can get answered by turn 3 since it's capped at 3 hp....cleric into arms into arms is a 5/7 on t3....thats just two card combo. That's arguably stronger than Edwin since it can snowball even further....
---
Well to be pedantic, the entire rez mechanic is the problem. A card that is a one of in your deck to start the game dies 3 times and now 3 of that card exists in your rez pool.
---
Granted, it's very fun to play with but very odd the way it works.
---
Problem is when you remove Northshire you pretty much remove priest as an entire tempo deck and they don't have an identity other than hodge podge control
---
Priest hero power is possibly the worst in the game, basically rendering it unusable for the first 3 turns and needs a good 1 drop to compensate for early presence.
---
Priest needs good staples because his themes are so out there it's hard to make anything consistent.
---
Northshire and extra arms was by no means oppressive when compared to other 1 drop 2 drop synergistic decks out there. If you vaulted northshire then priest would LITERALLY be unplayable outside of otk and shit control. You cannot rely on expansions to give deck staples
---
Cleric into arms is too stronk, my star aligner deck hates the nerf but it's justified
---
Boom is not dead.
---
Honestly, couldn't really help you there, I know very little about the tablet market unfortunately. Something with 20GB+ of space, over 1.5GHz and maybe 2 GB of ram would be a good range, maybe contact support if you want more specifics about it
---
I will gladly die on this hill as well. And if they really need to change something for it just do something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/O3oXbKn.png?1) or [this](https://i.imgur.com/Hrxenv6.png).

Great, they fucked up my Spellhunter and my memey Big Rogue...
---
It’s hilarious, talked with someone a couple hours ago making this point un-ironically.  “I crafted cards to play with these, are those going to be refunded?!?!”
---
it was so extremely strong that it didn't see any real play, truly a masterpiece, the pinnacle if you will
---
What.
---
Divine Spirit/Inner Fire is just as important to Combo Priest. If they were HoFd and Extra Arms was left alone Priest would still have nothing. Those two cards also enabled Wall Priest to be a thing. They do more to enable Priest than Extra Arms at 2 ever has. They are extremely powerful but they're obviously designed with synergy in mind. Of course a card that targets a minion is worthless played by itself. It needs valuable targets to be powerful. And in many metas those cards were given valuable targets hence they are too powerful cards. 
---
We've had a whole expansion since the druid nerfs with nothing to justify the nerfs showing off the new design space made.
---
Quest druid is weak so if that's what ramp died for, thanks. We're still stuck with an aggro archetype being the only viable one for standard.
---
I agree. 2 extra turns to pressure the warrior is huge. There are ao many games where you get to one turn off from winning only for dr. Boom to come down on 7 for a 7 health gain to save them for one turn, and then crazy rush mechs to take over the board, reversing the tide of game.
---
Making boom come down 2 turn later give aggressive and midrange decks a better chance at closing out the game before it becomes unwinnable.
---
Bust

Playing wild where CC isn't a big deal. But asking questions is worthy of death by downvote. Thanks, r/Hearthstone.

Thank you for your input smart kid.

I'd keep him. Chances are, he'll still be a strong card. A bit weaker, but still strong.
---
I just want prep back for my stupid brews :( 5 mana sprint is shit
---
This brawl was a wild player’s wet dream. Pirate warrior’s ship cannon/patches bs mixed with mech hunter’s cost reduction bs mixed with murloc shaman’s staying power with angler + Anyfin if they’re somehow not dead. Pretty much every one of my games was a turn 4-5 lethal. It was pretty absurd lol.
---
You could post *literally the same exact comment* and have it be defending counterspell blocking flare
---
I find it to be poor design to create a card (counterspell) that counters a specific set of cards (spells), then in that set of cards (spells), have a card (flare) that counters their set's counter (counterspell).
---
That's how I can tell you thought about what you wrote for even less time than it took to type it.
---
&gt; i mean, will i get refund dust so i can disenchant those cards for some extra dust ?
---
No. Here's how it works:
---
If a card is nerfed, you can disenchant it for full value, which means you lose the card but gain its CRAFTING value (Whatever the cost for that rarity of card is).
---
If a card is sent to the Hall of Fame, which only happens during the first expansion of a year (Witchwood last year, Rise of Shadows this year for example), then you keep the card BUT ALSO get the card's full crafting value. However if you disenchant it you will only get the normal disenchanting value.
---
I guess in term of power, Dr Boom is still great, but is it really a good idea to keep a card for 9 whole turn?
---
 **EDIT: To clarify I mean a dust refund in addition to keeping the card. Sorry for the confusion!**
---
Amazing write up! I learned basically everything you said on my own messing around with hsreplay, but there were some insights that were good to hear too!
---
I fully expect that at the next rotation.  It is time.
---
Laughs in Bloodreaver Gul'dan
---
Pretty easy.  Zeph and Enforcer remove that taunts leaving 4 damage on board.  
---
Leeroy is played, inner rage applied to make leeroy a 8/1 - upto 12 damage now but need 17.  
---
Bloodsworn mercenary copies Leeroy adding another 8/1 to the board.  
---
Total damage is now 20 to face out of 17 required.
---
I have a suspicion that he might be a portrait for part 3 of this adventure. We've had Hagatha, Boom, Lazul (though admittedly not Togwaggle) and maybe the conclusion has him as the final hero of the story when Lazul brings the apocalypse with c'thun
---
That example isn't the same since battlecries happen before the minion is played.  The battlecry of Eater of Secrets destroys the explosive runes and then the minion is summoned.  Counterspell is more ambiguous since there is no clear "phase" that should take precedence for one card or the other.

This card has taught me that Standard currently has a lot of spells that draw cards and otherwise add cards to your hand.
---
Been playing HS for years now, that is this sub’s go to phrase against any popular deck
---
i mean i crafted stargazer luna, reno jackson and king pharos to play with pocket galaxy. feels pretty bad not gonna lie.
---
Yeah that was my thought process. It's less damning early game but helps the card overall later.
---
Really I'm just burnt cuz this was a great card for Zerek. You got two buffs out of it to keep the Zerek train alive.
---
This is what we like to hear Donais! Keep up the good work. A lot of whining on this sub but Hearthstone has been an amazing game in flavour and exciting returns to awesome mechanics lately. Looking forward to more design improvements in the future!
---
when they're almost never in a position before turn 10 where they don't have other more efficient removal options, no, it really isn't.
---
I have questions
---
heck, giants come back into meta even when there is just a deck with good draw like a lot of warlock decks in the past.
---
so its ok if he says stupid stuff irl??
---
I mean,
---
&gt; it'll be easier for you if you just don't stay stupid shit on the internet 
---
the same applies to u then ;)
---
Ouch, simply ouch
---
Ok, look at other CCGs then.  MTG Arena is a lot more expensive and they're just a straight copy paste of paper.  Last year I spent over 500$ on MTG:A and was barely able to craft two t1 decks.
---
People on this sub just love to complain about shit.  If it's that fucking bad then just quit until it gets better.  No one is holding you guys at gun point to play.  I quit during that entire odd/even bullshit and came back when those bastards got HOF.
---
I’m a mage and don’t use PG and used to do CC but now do secrets, so doesn’t really affect me much. Even when I did the new quest mage, I didn’t really use CC or PG.. so meh..
---
I just got that same pull, it does feel bad
---
Got it
---
Thx !
---
&gt; "another warrior card just got nerfed so don't talk about how broken this card is" is not an argument. 
---
It's not about the card specifically, but the deck it's being played in. Control Warrior is being hit, even if you don't think its a serious blow. There is a chance that Omega Devistator, a card only really useful in control decks, stops seeing as much play as it is right now. A "broken" card that isn't seeing play isn't worth changing.
---
&gt; it's a joke to even call the mana cost increase a nerf. 
---
We don't quite know that yet. Let the post nerf format play out.
---
&gt;why would having dr boom's infinite value generation delayed by 2 turns make any difference in games that go long enough for it to matter? 
---
Yeah. It wouldn't matter for control mirrors, but for the aggro and midrange match-up, it most certaintly will since those games will usually end by the time Boom has generated one or two cards at most.
---
There is one in the classic set now.
---
Sure it can, turn 4 giant into coin double conjurers on 5. That's the problem, is that if they can stick a giant a turn, it just turns into 4 12-drops.
---
Except having perpetual value is the problem. Naming a single deck in a class notorious for not being able to support control decks does not invalidate the fact that having perpetual value pushes out any other control deck.
---
Fucking Okus
---
Wow, that’s a really new and interesting point you make. I am completely convinced now.
---
Oh yah.  I forgot about Zayle.  I have that card.
---
Same here. It was golden even!
---
Nah he fared alright
---
Making every expansion require an 80 dollar buy-in to make more than one deck isn't very great for the new player experience either but Blizz doesn't care about that one
---
Nah I think it some anka deck with the handbuff 9 drop,u basically anka it and then you can necrium it,use the shadow thingy or necrium vial. Once you got those FAT STAT u smorc em

As a player of five years who essentially plays exclusively Wild, I'm afraid for the format. The phrase "too little, too late" isn't even a good enough descriptor for this situation. It's not Barnes that's the problem for Big Priest (or in Blizzard's lingo, "certain Priest decks"), it's how the game works, and how Blizzard has been pushing Priest.
---
Hearthstone is programmed so that alternatively statted token copies of minions aren't actually token copies, they're the real deal, just with changes to their stats. I was putting off on making a post about the state of Wild to a larger degree, and in that I planned to talk about Barnes and the bigger issue with reanimator. One of the reasons Big Priest feels so unfair is that a 1/1 or 5/5 copy of a minion is deceiving, and feels bad or very costly to beat--and the conventional ways of beating something like that (silence, for instance) don't work how you might want it to work. It's not a great idea to silence a 1/1 Ragnaros. Sure, a nerf to Barnes is helpful. But it's not like it castrates the bull, it only delays how long until it wakes up.
---
And the greater issue now with Big Priest is just how many strong cards fit ***absurdly*** well in the archetype. In one set, Big Priest got Convincing Infiltrator, Catrina Muerte, Forbidden Words, and Mass Resurrection. The set before that, it got one of the class's best board wipes to date: Mass Hysteria. It even got a tech option in the set before that through Zilliax. And a few months before that, Psychic Scream, which is arguably pretty busted and a no brainer inclusion for a ton of Priest decks at its current low cost of 7. But obviously I skipped over a pretty big one. Archmage Vargoth is such a demoralizing addition to a deck that for the most part only got better every single set, because it made a deck that so many people already felt was unfair a LOT stronger, both in raw power level without having to actually change anything in the deck, and in flexibility of how the deck can play out. And this guy was added to the game in the same set that added 4 playables to the archetype, only four months ago. A while back, Blizzard's defense to the lack of action was Big Priest's relatively low winrate, but I see two problems with that. In the past few *years*, Big Priest has been at its very worst around tier 3. For the majority of the time, it's been tier 1-2. And if Big Priest is still getting *significant* buffs, some of the best buffs it's gotten in years, that makes it a lot harder to rationalize a lack of action. And a nerf to Barnes, the highest draw RNG dependent card in the deck and the highest RNG dependent card in terms of effect in the deck, only a few months after some major buffs to the deck, isn't just too little, too late, it's just not enough, and is totally off target.
---
And this is just a part of a larger issue in Wild currently, involving a lack of options across individual classes. For the most part, there's only one *strong* deck per class at any given time, with the exceptions of Mage and Warlock, which probably have the most class-specific deckbuilding options. Because of nerfs in the past and years of what seems like a prioritization of Standard, Wild is less like a celebration of the history of Hearthstone's best decks ever and the emergence of new, unique strategies developed between cards with multi-year gaps, and more like a cesspool of just the strongest cards ever printed, all jammed together (Odd and Even decks, for instance). As much as I'd like to see unique decks pop up, like Darkest Hour Warlock, I'd both prefer those things to happen naturally, and for the current strongest strategies in the format to get a bit less support from new sets. There's also always the option of unnerfing old, nerfed cards to revive old strategies in order to give some new options for the format.
---

I've also got my problems with how they're dealing with Boom and Conjurer's Calling. I don't think those nerfs will guaranteed fix the problems people have been having in Standard or in Wild. Boom could be at 8, enabling him + a Hero Power on 10, and Warrior would still be pretty absurd in Standard. Warpath needs to rotate. Brawl might need to be considered for the Hall of Fame at some point. And until at least either of those happen, Dyn-o-matic will remain way too good, too--I genuinely don't think Boom was ever the real issue (in Wild, it's still playable in Odd Warrior, which is where it's best currently, so whoopdeedoo). As for Conjurer's Calling, we'll have to see, but it's a frustrating nerf for Wild just because Quest Mage was the primary reason why Big Priest hasn't been tier 1 or 0 lately (Quest Mage actually struggles against most of the metagame). I'll always be curious what Luna's Pocket Galaxy would have felt like at 6, but again, as a primarily Wild player, I never really had to worry about that card.
---
Well smorcing them will sure assert your dominance and control their fear in the same time so I guesse you were not wrong.
---
As much as i hate playing against Mage, the nerf seems a bit much. It feels like Blizzard just want to get rid of them because they knew nobody want to use it on 7 mana.
---
This is why I love this subreddit. People can agree with me in the first sentence, (incredibly overpowered) then argue that because the card/deck isn’t seeing play currently it’ll never be a problem at any point going forward. 
---
Here’s hoping the next 4 sets of cards (~540 in total if they keep the Uldum release size) don’t release a single card that’s good for highlander decks. Because lord knows if, in the next ~16 months this card is in standard, Highlander decks suddenly get good, they have a card with an effect you yourself would claim is “incredibly overpowered”.
---
It was broken just like pocket galaxy. This sub is filled with rank 10 players or something.
---
By the time you run pocket galaxy advantage it would be 2 rounds after. Cant pull arcane get two cards after and drop a character. Lunas pocket galaxy rendered useless.
---
Broken is broken no matter what class.
---
The only deck that I could think of is evolve shaman, so fun to play so fun to play against
---
Priest is broken in standard, not strong
---
I love these.
---
Sooooo you want the deck completely dead and the entire meta to be degenerate aggro? You stupid?
---
If I now craft those cards, am I gonna get full dust back after they nerf?
---
that‘s correct, i remember. wasn‘t that around the reno times?
---
as a player who likes free dust i approve of this message.
---
What? Boom at 9 severely weakens the deck vs aggro. Good luck squeezing in that play now.

&gt;control decks that could beat warrior would lose to Aggro and that’s why control was bad
---
&gt;no no, you’re wrong, control decks that could beat warrior were out there, it’s just that they were losing to Aggro, that’s why they were bad.
---
Dude you’re literally saying what I just said. The late game decks that can beat control warrior just lose to Aggro. The ones that tried to target Aggro would lose to dr boom and either way you’d just be playing a worse control warrior. My whole point is that control warrior was still op in that meta because it was the only control deck that could beat both Aggro and control. Every other control deck would choose one or the other, so instead of making that decision you’d just play warrior. Or you would play Aggro. If there was no dr boom in that meta, then control decks could play with reasonable late game. But because there was, you’d have to target warrior or tailor your deck to everything else.
---
Maybe you’re not getting it still. Control warrior loses to either lots of value or lots of tempo. Decks that put in lots of value lose to the tempo. So if you try targeting a warrior that way even with 100% win rate against them you’re still losing. Decks that put in lots of tempo sometimes beat warrior, and then they can also beat the tempo decks. So you always have a chance to win with a high tempo deck. 
---
Therefore, it’s logically better to go with a high tempo deck, because sometimes you beat warrior, sometimes you beat tempo, and you almost always beat any other slow deck that is not warrior, because they are either targeting warrior or just plainly a worse warrior. And they’re usually cheaper. Thus, anything that might be able to beat a deck like warrior consistently cannot compete, so you either play warrior, or an Aggro deck.
---
Like dude, fuck all the stuff I just said even, you’re saying that no other control deck was good enough to see play, that anything that could counter warrior was pushed out of the meta, you’re even saying that every actual deck in the meta had unfavorables against control warrior....
---
And then you’re saying it wasn’t op?
---
Good. Any deck that can play 20 mana in a turn must burn in hell.
---
Make this a copypasta now.
---
Lmao bro priest was the best deck in the game. You're clearly biased and don't want your class nerfed.
---
You spelled priest wrong (wild)
---
Revert the nerf that reverted the buff*
---
If you craft the nerfed card after the patch you can disenchant it for full value. I've done this with Elysiana. It's like free rotation for 2 weeks :D
---
i have an ipad and it works great
---
I still hate the fact, that one simply can deconstruct any highlander deck by shuffeling some bombs into it. ( as example)
---
Feels like a deal breaker for me. Might we wanna talk about that issue?
---
I think the most part of the blizzard community could understand the problem by labelling it "unfun and not interactive"

That’s like Himalayan pink sea salt

Awh, balls.
---
Yes, but you basically get to play them free for a few weeks, so i dont even think its worth the time
---
Hurray bigpriest is left unscathed!! I am so happy hurray
---
That 1 cost 1/3 Bastard
---
raza priest was the best deck for like 6 months wtf are you talking about
---
Good advice. Will just keep it all for now. Don’t need anything specific but like to tidy up my collection and am always tempted to mass disenchant for ease rather than disenchant one by one.  Maybe I’ll just get rid of the common dupes for now like you guys suggested.
---
They costs me about 35k of dust, and now i'll get 3-5k?
---
&gt;Resorting to strawmanning won't do you any good lmao.
---
Exactly how am i strawmaning you? This shit is exactly what i am talking about, vague assertions that go no where but you think just because you uttered them everyone should take them seriously it is just ridiculous. No wonder your first comment was just an insult....
---
&gt;That has absolutely nothing to do with what we were arguing about. 
---
Uhh were we not talking about control warrior versus aggro decks? or are we *now* talking about dr boom because it is convenient for your argument? 
---
&gt;Sure, it's still an auto-include in Control Warrior, but that deck will be weaker against aggro because of the mana change.
---
It is weaker only slightly when you consider the rest of its strengths against aggro and just general value in the current meta.
---
&gt;Lmao, what? This is the response you made to a comment about how it actually matters not being able to Hero Power the same turn as you transform. How the fuck is that a "blind assertion"?
---
Can you actually explain **any** of your "arguments" as opposed to suggesting something with no other thought aside from your suggestion? How exactly does what i say relate to this for example? 
---
&gt;Punished for it? How? I'm not the one who just embarrassed himself by making such stupid comments.
---
Yeah your comment got removed because you being rude for no reason other than to stroke your toxic ego despite not knowing shit about the game so i'd say thats pretty embarrassing than a handful of downvotes but thats just me. 
---
That being the case, i honestly hope you find something more fulfilling to do with your life than to be unnecessarily toxic about a game for children. It is quite unbecoming.
---
I don't see why More Arms! couldn't be 1 mana. It still makes double buff do +4/+4 for 4 mana, without being OP in early game. +4/+4 for 6 is just terrible, and too slow to trigger pyro. +2/+2 for 3 in itself is also terrible.
---
Congrats man!!!
---
Thats true but since highlander decks like hunter or mage are so strong I find it good that there is a little gimmick keeping them in check. In the end it only delays you from playing 2 cards so i think you are exaggerating with the "unfun and not interactive" part.
---
It absolutely matters. Many games are won when the Mage is behind on board on turn 4/5 when they play Lunas, and they catch up on board the next couple turns by playing 1 cost late game minions.
---
Lots of decks around that can end the game by turn 6. Aggro warrior, combo priest, murloc shaman murloc paladin, hunter
---
RIP, I crafted Sneed's Old Shredder just for that deck a week ago
---
Yessir. Rank 10 now
---
People want nerfs, they get nerfs and still complain.
---
I know, and honestly I can't remember where I was trying to go with my original comment
---
But can only target a minion. Big difference.
---
Ahah ok ^^ sorry then
---
Golden Rafaam...oh the value! A deck full of golden legendaries, jealous!
---
Ha ha and you already got downvoted. (I upvoted you btw) 
---
There are just an extremely amount of whining Priest players around who can’t stand a nerf to any of their cards. ( because they just crafted, because Priest was never the best deck(( besides a couple cancerous archetypes they had but these Priest players actually don’t play, promised!)) because they have the weakest core set (( wich isn’t true)) etc. ) 
---
There was even a tweet by Frodan who was mad they nerfed arms. And as Iksar mentioned, people don’t seem to realize how strong Priest actually is atm. Leaving the class completely untouched would potentially give her a boost in winratio and popularity. While we had worse deck through out the history of HS , this deck isn’t particularly interactive. Additionally Priests tend to get very good cards in the last expansion of the year. So it just makes a lot of sense to tone them down a bit right now.
---
Thanks
---
Most of the time Rogue is good. 
---
Right now the class is ok. They nerfed a lot and removed the only board clear the class had.
---
Since Boom dodged a real nerf just do the following:
---
You wanna have fun with a class you like: Rogue.
---
You wanna win: Warrior.
---
You can get it running with wine, you can also get HDT running. See [here](https://github.com/borisbabic/hearthstone_hdt_linux) for instructions
---
The new taunt package made the matchup significantly easier for the Warrior.
---
I get that. It's just that no one ever means to find dragons when they search for rag
---
You have about 3 weeks to get the barnes to disenchant for full value. Seems to be feasible with the daily quests.
---
Pilfered Power has been patched to also give Excess Mana.
---
What? This is one of the best metas ever. Ignore the shitty pro scene for a moment where they basically all realised that you just include LPG and hope to draw it for free wins and think about actual player experience. 
---
I got my 100 gold from wins yesterday, my winrate with a homebrew anubisath priest and dragon discover mage was 65% combined, I only faced the same deck three times all day and I only faced five other decks twice. The variety right now is enormous.
---
It's like 20 bucks for the whole thing. Dont waste your gold
---
Wait you're right! I thought I only had until the nerfs came out. Thanks
---
How to evaluate quality if not by popularity? It is more complex than popularity alone, but obviously quality and popularity strongly correlates.
---
The main issue is that you can't use the hero power on the turn it's played. Not being able to play it turn seven is largely irrelevant.
---
“...Riiiice...”
---
haha, pile on
---
The moment you knew Mankind's fucked
---
People should know the truth if it’s negative so be it. And yes it’s not the exact reasons I mentioned but if you look just a little deeper you’ll see a big reason of why the game IS dying.
---
I don't own any of the cards that got nerfed actually so no I aint salty at all
---
I think so, its one of the most widely known ones.
---
Why would Blizzard make mechanical changes to cards that are rotateing out in about 5 months, and can still be played in Wild?
---
If it was a card from Rise of Shadows or Saviours I'd be more expectant of mechanical nerfs, but Boom/Lunas are near the end of their lifespans in Standard and are not huge Wild issues.
---
&gt;but because all these old cards are also broken it's fine. 
---
No. My argument is that this card is broken (at 5 mana), but that doesn't mean they shouldn't make an attempt at balancing it.
---
TGT throwback: Who am I?
---
How the hell u have 9 minions on board!
---
time to disenchant the wife.
---
Go to hell.
---
It might be a lazy nerf, but Big Priest is, at the moment, far from the best deck in wild, and this nerf will make it even worse. It already has numerous bad matchups and now aggro will be even worse
---
Like swatting insects
---
Out of my jungle!
---
If that's an actual question, they do it because of returning players. You can see the mana costs of every card in your hand without taking a closer look at the text, this makes it impossible to misplay because someone missed the nerf.
---
If that's just a "it sucks that they do it this way", then yeah I agree.
---
I think someone posted cool idea that Barnes should summon 1/1 minion that have same efect as one of minions in deck but when u try to resurect you can resurect only 1/1 without any efect.
---
Zephrys doesn't know what supercolider does. All it sees is a 1 attack weapon. Would you want an weapon destruction for a Light's Justice?
---
The only card he understands is doomsayer. Everything else is just raw stats on the board.
---
Float like a butterfly
---
Weird, I did the same.
---
Revive spells can be beaten by diluting the Rez pool. Barnes highroll allows them to get started much sooner, and also potentially just wins the game vs aggro. So now they are a lot weaker to aggro, and control has more time to find the tools to mess the Rez pool up (hex, Kazakus potions, etc)
---
My guess is, it is searching for cards that have "arms" in the text that you have extra(more then 2 copies) of.
---
The search keyword 'extra' does not search at all for the word extra.
---
They overcosts Priest class because Blizzard thinks Priest Hero power is opressive. There is also a lot of usseless cards in the core set so Priest relies a lot on expansions. There is also the boad clear problem, Holy nova is a really bad card, but Priest has almost no other choise but to play it..
---
She's not disenchantable. And neither is C'Thun. COINCIDENCE?
---
Consistently inconsistent.
---
What makes you think they didn't try it at 6?
---
Suck on these nuts
---
First of all, the full experience is playing that cool deck everyone is using without having to disenchant my whole collection, any other card game is cheaper than hearthstone, that's for sure.
---
And second of all, stop bringing the excuse of the arena, because the arena is the dumbest thing alive to generate gold, imagine I get a 3-3, I get what I have invested, it's true, but I have played 6 games with a crappy deck I don't even enjoy playing. It's not worth the effort to improve in arena, that's only for streamers that have time to waste
---
Expired Merchant / and 5cost 8/8 40health girl
---
I think Barnes was exactly the right target. Despite him being the weak link, he is the most complained card by a lot. It's always complaints about how Barnes auto-wins the matchup or how the winrate increases when they draw barnes, etc. Regarding power level Big Priest was never a problem, but especially now (SoU launch) it isn't anyway.
---
Have they fixed the bug where Wizzbang decks show the class you used to create them. EVEN IF YOU COPY A PREBUG DECK WITH THE RIGHT ICON FROM ANOTHER ACCOUNT.

Because it's easy to pilot so even bag players can beat other bad players with it and these other bad players think that's unfair instead of improving, so they make up arguments like "barnes is too highrolly" even tho it's a rng-based game with a lot of highroll-decks and "it locks control-decks out of the meta" which is just super wrong.

---
Yes that is true, but handlock needs the big dudes early to build upon that tempo. Without the giants or the drakes, handlock didnt have a lot to stop the enemy from overrunning it.
---
It's worse, but.. theres so much removal in the deck that having a guaranteed turn 9 Boom is probably worth having. 
---
Definitely would keep him if I start with the coin.
---
It'll be interesting to see, but my gut is that it's not enough to really change the deck significantly. Maybe w/r dropping slightly against aggro is enough!
---
Just something cool memelords say
---
2 turn kill Odd hunter with Cube and Clockwork Automaton. Not very competitive but it was a really fun deck.
---
Yep good move blizzard!
---
But don't you need to have the Barnes BEFORE the nerf date in order to have those 2 weeks for dusting it?
---
TONIGHT!!

If I remember correctly, that used a HearthPwn-enabled extension. Innkeeper does not sync your collection anymore, so I guess the extension isn't supported, either.

Back when Priest was supposed to be a control class, those were the times...

Last (does someone know what game this is🤔)

It should be worse point for point than Blessing of Kings, due to it's flexibilty.
---
You can put it all on the same minion. You can split it between two. You can split it between *turns* to be more mana efficient and work around other cards. It's less vulnerable to hard removals...

It's like Choose One shouldn't be as good as the standalone versions of a card would be.

Hey! Joins the goons...

Yeah but you had to build your deck to have big minions and there are plenty of games where you dont get the galaxy off and you have to find a way to play all of them. Dr. Boom on the other hand had no downsides
---
Your past dids?
---
why is it 18/16 for 6 mana? sorry for not knowing as  i didnt really play that much back then.
---
Congrats on securing the most OP broken minion in the game that Blizzard refuses to ever nerf.
---
&gt; It has, and the IF DS combo sucks, that doesn't mean Priest deserves to have its only viable deck nerfed within a week. They refuse to give Priest a solid win condition that isn't that combo and removed Mind Blast, what do you expect?
---
Wait what, they removed Mind Blast? AHAHAHA! I used to be an avid HS player but now I log in on a weekly basis and mostly meme it up with Whizbang and my  meta-breaking Jaraxxus deck. I knew they fucked over Vanish, but removing Mind Blast? Hm.
---
&gt;CW is recent, but it's a lot more boring in my opinion. Priest relies on a combo, Warrior relies on his opponents dying of boredom and realizing Warrior never runs out of removal.
---
Fair enough, dude. Although Control Warrior has always been that way. I'm sitting here with 30 armor and 9 cards which are basically all removal for when my opponent tries to play something.
---
&gt;And I think you got nostalgia goggles, the game was always annoying in that regard. Cubelock recently, Undertaker decks, old Freeze Mage...
---
I loved Cubelock and Freeze Mage. I believe those decks actually required some skill and forethought to be played. Freeze Mage in particular had limited resources and had to choose whether to use their damage spells to clear minions or save them for face damage. Freeze Mage died for Quest mage, which is an easier form of Freeze Mage. Freeze Mage lite where you don't have to pay attention to your damage resources because you have an infinite number of those as soon as you get your combo going.
---

Undertaker decks can go die in a fucking ditch. I'll never forget the Undertaker into Zombie Chow into Hollowed Creeper opener. NEVER EVER.

But in other instance it is a 0 cost spell (0 to activate the effect 8 in this case to max attack) also it will be logic that with loatheb will be 5 to activate and 3 to max attack, but is a digital game and code is the referer if it is coded with no diferenthiation of mana no words to add, also will be interesting to know what happends with mana discounts ¿it is posible to kill a deathwing with 2 radiants on board?
---
Kinda tbh. Playing a deck where you REALLY feel it when you misplay finally taught me to recognise my misplays.
---
I cut my teeth on token and taunt druid, where hardly any of my decisions mattered because I could just build another board in an instant, it's taken me a while to grow out of that, but I think that I finally have!

---
Interactivity is the process were subjects influence each other, the more process they exchange with each other, the more interactive the conexion. 
---
If you need examples to understand this definition, a succesful OTK deck would be totally non-interactive, (If you can remember, Boomsday's Mecha'thun Priest saw some success, the strategy was to clear the board and draw cards) despite the action of one subject, the other would remain unaffected, otk decks just need to stall the game and draw the combo cards needed, nothing else. 
---
Control warrior would also fit in this definition too because all they have to do is to wait until you play some stuff just to be remove them later, you can't choose to not play anything because Warrior would outresource you with an insane amount of armor (and Elysianas), after Dr. Boom is played, the interactivity decrease even more because now every mech is turned into a removal, the plan of remove stuff and stall the game, occasionaly play some minion for the pressure. Since there aren't that many charge and good rush minions, the board doesn't change, neither your enemy's health, you just dispose your minions on the board and hope for them to not be removed (which they probably will), It's a one-sided game.

Thanks for the PTSD. To whom should I bill the next therapy session?
---
The 2 drop that draws a card when you have a quest on ?
---
Quest mage would on average generate another additional Ice Block if they were lucky. The odds of having 4+ is so statistically tiny that it doesn't even warrant talking about. However, I believe it has happened to SOME people, which is why I'll light a solemn candle for them. 
---
Quest Rogue was amazing for its meta. Hear me out here. The deck had such polarizing matchups that, if you were playing a control dec, you could immediately concede upon Rogue playing their quest. If you were aggro or even midrange, you stuck around and tried killing the Rogue before they got their quest off. Now that's some serious time-saving.

If this is true, the meta would be a million times worse than it currently is.
---
Hunters favorable match ups have been nerfed leaving mostly its unfavorable match ups in the meta meaning that it will not be tier 1 anymore
---
Thing is, they straight up just gave away Priests's viable possible identity to rogue.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
No one likes playing DS/IF combo decks, not even priests. 
---
Let's face it, there identity should be healing, this means giving mininos more health to heal, but they shouldn't be flipping the hp to kill people in one hit, and there are too many 'flip' cards in this game, it's not just inner fire. They've painted themselves into a corner again.

Fair enough point honestly. Warlock's quest is trash and they didn't get much. But I guess then it comes down to whether or not Zoo is better than Combo Priest.

Also, that's why I said (but not shit). Give Priest a new gimmick that isn't utter fucking garbage. Give them anything but more combo and big fuel.

Nope. It's boring and keeps being the only way priest is ever viable. I wish they'd HoF one or both of them so that they can design actually interesting cards for priest

I also don't want to complain about the changes... I just played Highlander Mage because it was so strong (but also quite fun) to play, at the same time the Priest and Warrior Decks didn't seem fun to me. But with all three classes nerfed there are good chances to have a higher variety in decks again which is a good thing.
---
mage is murloc best match up though

I recognize that, but aggro warriors will likely face less control warriors post nerf. People tend to shy away from nerfed decks even if they are still relevant.

Hecklebot wasn't in most control decks to begin with. It was teched in when Archivist cost 8 mana to get rid of either her or a bounce mechanic in the mirror, but was otherwise not that great.
---
It'd be cool to see 'realistic' interpretations of Hearthstone stuff.
---
T R E S S P A S S E R
---
Gotta go to blizzards website to do that, or the launcher if on PC
---
Oh damn, id say thats more embarrasing than losing matches in a vídeo game
---
In theory this idea is awesome, in reality there will probably be one meta-deck of neutral minions that can't attack, have 0 attack or 0/1-mana drops in general.
---
It’s a solid deck that will continue to be overshadowed by control chads now that they whiffed hard on the Boom nerf
---
Warrior has a bunch of fun archetypes prepped for experimentation and probably a few T2/T1
---
Decks on the bench, but no let’s make a nerf that literally won’t have any impact on the 30 card decklist that everyone is spamming for 6 months.
---
1400 gold are 14 packs which are on average roughly 1400 dust.
---
This deal provides you with 2560 dust.

I miss the super early days of Hearthstone where that card was relevant
---
I'll show them, I'll...
---
I bring life...
---
Agree,i would argue that the classic set shoud be reshuffled every rotation cicle like MTGA with the core sets. to keep it relevant and actually usefull in every meta.
---
You win, or you dieee...
---
Snicker snack!
---
Nomi shouldnt even be in the deck, thats just averages working out for above 50% look at his played winrate
---
MRGLGLGLGLGL!
---
just apm more 4head
---
They have been shitting on priest since last year
---
Yeah and now Dr boom is nerfed. Okus is a legend he has gathered enough salt and "karma" to nerf Dr Boom into Oblivion
---
I regret giving Hearthstone money after how they treat Hearthstone
---
Noooooo RIP the dream of being a real deck ahah
---
Why's it always the Paladin... lol. That one made total sense to me
---
SNICKER SNACK
---
yeessss someone found me yaya
---
just focus on drawing it for easy win
---
Srs note, looks good.
---
Hahaha, love it.
---
While I know what he *says,* every time he hits the field I think he's just meme'ing and saying, "Naxxramas is *open!*"
---
Nah because there's no way you'd put 2 shitty chargers in your deck just for that. More likely Anubisath Handbuff
---
This place is scaarrryyy
---
Everybody was hyped about that card and then it turned out really bad 😂 because aggro
---
Is it possible to have a "Total Dominance" quest if you haven't done the tutorial yet?
---
GOOOOORGE YOUR HATRED
---
It’s so sad that this is a massive value increase lol like 1400 gold really is worth nothing when you consider how excited people would be to trade it for 2560 dust.
---
Pretty you're right. but it was hotfixed in a day or so following it's release
---
Thought this would be my season, made it to full Stars rank one. Of course I lost my match to get into Legend and now im empty Stars rank one. With Mage Nerf coming after the weekend I'm not sure I'll get it :(
---
I'm in charrrrrge now!
---
I was hardstuck at r11 4 years ago before i quitted and come back during witchwood and decided to review every game i played from r18 while reading normal guides and an odd paladin guide. Then i finished high legend most of the time now when i am not too busy, some decks with 58% winrate like murloc shaman,60% winrate with combo priest while lower on others.
---
All of the games are at legend-5 with mostly above 400 games with each deck. I wouldn't say playing a deck helped me, more like reviewing my replays and reading guides is what helped me the most, watching streamers do help sometimes when they discuss their play with their viewers like rdu,zalae and sjow but less helpful than just reading guides.
---
Maybe if it was 1 mana cheaper so it could be played earlier, and also have more defensive stats, let's say 6/7. Then it would be absolutely perfect

Anomaly Mode - Double battlecry/evolve Shaman

Mage should be a pretty decent match up for aggro priest. I'd try playing a few games from the mage's side. (Highlander) Mages don't carry a lot of single target removal so if you manage to start drawing cards especially early on, it's generally game over for them - at least in my experience. Play around flame ward and perhaps frostbolt by making sure your important minions are above 3 health and a potential ping. You cant play too well around polymorph other than not over committing to a single minion.
---
Hunter is polarising and control warrior is rough.
---
I understand it can be difficult to climb though so switch it up sometimes. I got walled pretty hard at rank 1 using quest shaman before switching to big spell mage and finding my way to legend. Variety is the spice of life.
---
Validated
---
Say hello to ma little friend
---
Does it matter? Either of those mean that control decks for other classes in general aren't viable. If it's the latter, that means the whole "Boom outvaluing control decks" thing never even comes into play, but whenever there IS a potential control deck that can deal with aggro, it always has that second issue of "does it also beat Boom?".
---
Those legs hanging off Nightmare Amalgam's chest are so creepy.
---
Apparentely they don't, because Control Warrior has been a thing for ages now and Omega Devastator is still a 4/5 deal 10 damage with rush.
---
Theat happended with me for Naxx and Blackrock mountain
---
"its awesome except for all these reasons why it wouldn't be awesome"

I had a guy (back when innervate gave 2 mana) play innervate, innervate, defender of Argus (or w/e the 4-2-3 give 1/1 and taunt is). I thought I was about to get stomped and then saw that card and died laughing.
---
It triggers when a minion attack brings a character to negative health. Usually this is achieved by manually trading, e.g. a 5 attack minion into a 4 health minion. However, the same goes for the minion attacking with effects like \[\[Mass Hysteria\]\], \[\[Betrayal\]\] or \[\[BEEEES!!!\]\].

That's actually the sound I make when I craft an outrageously expensive deck ***THEN IT FUCKING GETS NERFED AND I'M OUT LIKE 6K+ DUST BECAUSE THE ONE CARD THEY NERFED RUINED THE WHOLE FUCKING DECK***.
---
What? I'm not spiteful.
---
Get that gold class! Gj on rank 5 thats commitment
---
im a simple man, i see control warrior getting rekt i upvote.
---
I'm a Rogue player, I like Priest but I'm not even a fan of Combo Priest. I don't like seeing one of my favorite classes in the dumpster after being viable for a week though.
---
And the deck is entirely based on buffs, so silencing does do something. Sure, you don't revert the healing, but silencing does take a hit on their resources and makes it harder for them to pull off the combo. You can't one shot with just a base level Injured Blademaster + double Divine Spirit Inner fire, and that's the highest HP minions the deck runs. Silencing the other buffs does delay the combo.
---
The impression I got was that the Warlock deck was stronger.  Sac pact for 2 more crabs, and more card draw to get crabs.
---
There’s also some viable control/combo decks that run a lot of board clears and very few minions.  It’s pretty rare to get matched against one, but I’ve had success playing them.  When your opponent’s game plan involves using crabs on your minions, you can mess up their plans by not playing any minions for them to crab.
---
Because that same thing has been true for other classes and they also weren't nerfed? I'm asking for consistency here. Why is it such a big deal when priest is strong and oppressive for a week but it's not a big deal with warrior is strong and oppressive for an expansion and a half? Why is it not such a big deal when paladin is strong and oppressive for half a year?
---
It would've been nice to see some of warriors mechs getting their wings clipped, I guess we just have to wait until Boomsday rotates to get another CW deck that involves decision making.
---
Because secret hunter will no longer be tier one due to it's best matchups getting nerfed and its worst match ups rising up
---
Is this a meme now? 
---
Gotta say I like it
---
Well, that class identity thing is kind of a joke.
---
Mage can’t swarm the board, Shaman can’t generate cards...
---
Masters Call was really good at the end of Raven but as soon as they introduced Lackeys and Twinspells and Mana Cyclone and Underbelly , card advantage as a strategy pretty much went out the window and Call became just a way for Beast Hunter to keep up with everyone else.
---
Reporting for duty!

There's certain spells and animations that are entirely unfair on mobile versus desktop.
---
You lose a TON of apm.
---
I give up.
---
Dude, tempo.
---
4 mana, discard your hand, summon a 2/3
---
Huh, failure is an option.
---
I've literally never roped during a turn. There's been like one deck in history that every even vaguely had that as a risk and it was just a dumb inner fire deck anyway.
---
I started July 1st of this year and it has definitely felt grindy at times, but I seem to not be able to make anything competitive with other classes! Props to you* for playing across multiple classes, man! Typo* lol
---
Like swatting insectsLike swatting insects!
---
Yeah deck tracker is pretty key for decks like holy wraith pally. For example you would use the tracker to predict likely out comes from playing prismatic lens.
---
You can summon a full board of them!
---
Step 0: queue into control warrior as that’s the only matchup slow enough to possibly let you complete this absurd combo.  
---
Step 1: get 2 copies of wonderous wand. 
---
Step 2: Myra’s to empty your deck. 
---
Step 3: play cultist and cast 2 death’s shadow on it and end turn. 
---
Step 4: when your turn starts you’ll summon 6 cultists. Play another cultist from hand to summon ra. Now cast a six power tog’s scheme on ra. Play both wands which will draw you six zero cost ras. Play them all.
---
first as tragedy, then as farce
---
This kind if response is why blizzard did not to nerf cards in the first place. Their economic model leaves most players in the position of only being able to craft one or two meta decks a cycle. 
---
It's their own damn fault for having card prices so high but the end result is either cancer decks ruining the game or angry players that blew all their resources on a nerfed deck.  I think cancer decks are a bigger problem for the revenue stream but the pissed off poor players will be a thorn in their side.
---
combo enabler? i guess
---
Right you are, Ken!
---
You took Dalaran? WE'LL STEAL YOUR BOOMSHIP! MUHAHAHA
---
This image is cursed and i like it
---
Why do any of these matter? Lol you should've made an album of winrates of the individual cards within the deck, not the inflated individual deck stats
---
Wait so if you're wrong what do we win?
---
its only mostly worthless!
---
you can buff to be a card draw mechanic with things like power word shield. or healing with stuff like binding heal or earthen scales/
---
Battletag:Jimotonic#2749 Region:Asia, Trade only? Yes, you go first
---
Yeah, but the decks I enjoy playing the most often cause the opposite to happen. Casino Mage, Tess Rogue, Wild Renouncelock. Decks where I often don't even know what my own hand will look like at the end of each turn, so I have less time to anticipate and plan for my opponent's actions. Play those decks for some time and you start playing against RNG more than against your opponent.
---
Recently though I've taken up Quest Shaman and it's making me a decent player again. Working with/around RNG is crucial for that deck, but it's not so extreme that it takes up all of my time, like with the sillier decks I play. So I have time left to think for my opponent, predict his moves, track cards, etc that I don't have when I'm playing decks with even more unpredictability.
---
Same here - I’m doing very well this expansion in arena but I rarely play around cards. Don’t know which mage secrets are available rn for example
---
That strikes me as unhealthy class design, not something we should be focusing on preserving.  I think it's a good argument for giving priests better classic cards but a bad argument for preserving the DS/IF combo forever.
---
Good for you, most players including top competitive ones from time to time don't finish their turns in time even on pcs's. Usually because they used to much time thinking about their turn. Everything is bit slower especially if it's older mobile. This guy climbed to legend first time - so probably used more time to think what to do in comparison to somebody who climbed there few times.
---
Delaying their best card 2 turns won't do much?
---
To be fair, it's such a decent draw engine that you can die on turn five from overdraw in wild from it. Northshire is absolutely bonkers.
---
No one cares
---
Its sad there are so damn many people in these comments  who could learn a thing or two from Okus.
---
Oh, shit..
---
SCARGIL+MECHWARPER+RADIANT ELEMENTAL+CRAB+DARK PACT=I have transcended time and space. Those dimensions are capable of hosting creatures known as murlocs and, in this new plane of existence I have created and placed myself in, such a thing cannot touch or otherwise interact with my being and consciousness.
---
With Baku, the best deck is odd rogue. It's hyper-powerful. Odd pally is also very very good. But secret mage is in a tier of its own right now.
---
I honestly feel like the Dr Boom nerf is minor. The amount of time you actually played it on turn 7 were pretty few and far between. Sure, you can't do turn 9 play boom and highroll 7 armour hero power, but really, the rush and the discover ability are both still there. People are still going to eat 4 omega devastators in the same game.
---
Damn dawg go easy on him
---
r/whydoesthisexist
---
Another reason to never play that card.
---
This game is stupid.
---
EU Squelched#21689 looking to trade the challenge a friend 80g quest. I show, you go first!
---
I was hoping for some more meaningful nerfs other than just mana cost, especially dr boom who will remain in every warrior deck. The cost is almost irrelevant when the card provides value indefinitely into a control matchup.
---
Reno mage will definitely still be strong, it’s got a really strong defensive core and a good amount of punch to finish but the high till non games are gonna be out for the most part
---
I'm not sure what I expected
---
The actual strength and meta-warping of the chosen deck will not be relevant.
---
That’s what a copypasta is my dude

If you're used to Magic, you should know buying into busted stuff can lead to your deck getting banned. That shouldn't be new to you.
---
Not true, Tess now spawns a 1/1 token, or more for each time you play her. 5 more times for a ghetto Onyxia

Havnt played magic but googled lions eye diamond. Why is it confusing? Discard lions eye, diacard your hand gain 3 mana of any color. Seema pretty simple to me.
---
"I'll eat my shoe/hat" is a colloquialism not meant to be taken literally.
---
Move along, nothing to see here.
---
Knowing my luck I'd get lorewalker cho every time
---
Except that the opponent knows you played it. They can see it. So they play a crappy 1/1 instead. It's a dead card because of how the game works.
---
Edit: oh, you mean if it retained stats. Well in that case, then there would be counters that caused it to do something to you, like deal damage to you whenever it got hit or whatever. Those already exist, of course, but aren't played because they're equally bad.
---
Exactly
---
Zeph on 3 has won me the game giving me a juicy crab 3/4 and killing one of their Murlocs. Still need to get lucky with secrets and hope they don’t draw prism
---
That is why it is the first to get off the banlist.
---
Is it worth buying the naxaramus adventures if I have to spend 1400 gold to get 3 legendaries (2 of them stalag and his twin never even see play)?  The cards rewarded seem a bit stingier than league of explorers
---
What? Your screenshot button broke as you went to do it?
---
[removed]
---
In theory it’s a tech against decks like Big Priest that only play big minions. Also Spell Hunter was a thing back then, and this card is VERY good against that.
---
The problem is it’s unplayable against literally anything else.
---
Game changer.
---
People here are so friendly.
---
Last two expansions have had much better legendaries to craft.. FeelsBadMan
---
But it had divine shield and rush.
