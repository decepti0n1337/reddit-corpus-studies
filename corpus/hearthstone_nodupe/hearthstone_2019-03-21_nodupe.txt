I picked Tarim,stonehill, call to arms, and tirion. Oops
---
---
---
Some that I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned - cathedral gargoyle (better than shielded minibot, just needs the dragons worth running), Mulchmuncher (with enough treant support), juicy psychmelon (post UI rotation), venomizer, sul‚Äôthraze (sees some play already I know), dragon roar + war master voone.
---

---
Maybe not the absolute most powerful but I can imagine a lot of these seeing play with the right support and after rotation of infinite value deathknights, most otk combos etc.
---
Meh.  Much uglier than Murloc Tinyfin
---
https://youtu.be/0TmoYBcLul8
---
its banned now.  no more fun
---
Look at any competitive sport and try to find a lifetime ban for cheating a single time, it just doesn't happen because its ridiculous overkill. In sports people generally accept that people will try to bend or even overtly break the rules to gain any advantage and giving lifetime bans is crazy because most of the time the cheater learns their lesson and stops.
---
I would probably waste my entire week playing patron warrior in that brawl
---
That's a glove.
---
Plus playing fungal on a pair of 1/1s is still good. Not so much with gloop sprayer. 
---
Most card games actually line up their release dates to the end of the spoiler seasons rather closely. For most players who would actually pre-order booster boxes and other similar products, what's in the box itself usually doesn't matter to them.
---
But... nevermind
---
I feel like the odd requirement doesnt allow you to run enough dragons for a dragon package to work. You also have to cut duskbreaker, bone drake and firetree witchdoctor, some of the best dragon cards.
---
That being said this deck looks interesting. I myself have built/ played control quest priest, odd quest priest, dragon quest priest and a bit of dragon-control priest; since Boomsday. Very fun decks and playable up to rank 10 and even 5
---
When you mill the new legendary... you know you‚Äôll have made it. 
---
Thanks. They seem to remove these ahead or schedule. Perhaps there is an internal dollar limit that automatically triggers because this isn‚Äôt the first time
---
This will make a fine addition to my collection
---
Its just a spam account report and move on
---
It's because the deck with elementals in them is worse than just a generic deck that happens to play the cards you added.
---
The problem is that Yogg is basically "do you play more than four spells? put this in your deck as your oh shit panic button".
---
If Yogg were unnerfed I could easily see decks like Even Shaman and Warlock auto-including it just for the highroll game finisher despite them not running that many spells.
---
It's probably the Bandersnatch.
---
Yup, definitely thought this brawl was about showing off the new deck autocomplete feature.
---
I'd guess that they banned malchazaar after you created the deck
---
They took it away, but reverted it after community outcry since it was considered a non-competitive card.
---

---
[removed]
---
I was living a lie
---
That's a bold statement.
---
I feel like having 8 Kelseths in your deck might not be as effective as you think it is
---
MTG previews cards the same way and have done so for quite some time. 
---
Oh right
---
No beast tag. 
---
I've never seen them put these up and take them down so quickly. Nor have I seen a deal timer like the one I got this time. You are probably right about a dollar cap.
---
Companies pretty much have this stuff down to a science. Other card games do it as well as certain video games, movies, TV shows, etc.
---
Analysis from streamers isn't particularly effective in determining whether or not a set is a good investment anyway. But even if that is a concern of yours, most streamers will likely still try to push out reviews before the set comes out since that kind of content rapidly loses appeal after release.
---
Or they don't find this brawl fun and just want to get their win quick. I play nothing but meme decks, but I'd still have banned Yogg in my first game for the free win so I could never touch this brawl again.
---
looking at you, countess ashmore.
---
I'll be disappointed if the mage villain isn't Infinite Toki.
---
The last expansion was Boomsday, what is a rastakhan? 
---
Yogg compares well to Deathwing. If Deathwing were a neutral 10 mana board clear that *didn't* also discard your hand to play him it would be in almost every single deck as a last ditch effort card.
---
But that wouldn't be nearly as offensive as unnerfed Yogg is.
---
So just think if you would want to play with a Deathwing that didn't have a drawback and was just a neural 10 mana twisting nether with a 12/12 body. Thats how Yogg almost always ends up behaving, except it draws you a ton of cards, often hits your opponent for a ton of damage, and might summon you a full board of minions.
---
*Maelstrom Portal Intensifies*
---
wow I was wondering what was going on... some guy played odd warrior and it showed me some random shit cards. Then he kept consistantly clearing my board with spend all your armor cards I was so confused. 
---
Same deck, same results. Easiest 100 gold per day of my life.
---
I still think this statement should have been released quite a while ago.
---
Use book rather than fireball - if they do ban apprentice I have options. 
---
fair. I run a one of tolvir warden in most of my versions, so it usually ends up pulling out at least 1 raptor patriarch if it's pre-quest 
---
Couldn't it just be like a hulk hand? It doesn't quite look screwed on to me,  not sure though. 
---
*Plays spirit lash*
---
Elven Minstrel is going away we might need other reliable tutors. I really hope it can become a thing, it's the only standard deck I  play.
---
So should be unnerfed Yogg!
---
that would actually be decent combo disruption for control mage 
---
It was played in tournement winning and legend decks. Watch old vods and you will see yogg only used as the above describes. There is no funny memory play at work here.
---
RNGesus take the wheel.
---
Also, banning Yogg is an unforgivable sin and affront to the God of Death. Those who do so will be cursed with an eternity of drawing Patches... in Standard. Don‚Äôt ask how. Just don‚Äôt do it okay?

Yeah let's further degrade the format for the fleeting enjoyment of someone who plays wild 1-2 days every couple years. Who cares about the dedicated wild player base- standard peeps want to have fun before the next set drops. 
---
RNG isn't an on/off switch.
---
Is the punishment really a slap on the wrist? Sounds pretty major to me, could be much more money in the exposure from a league than any one competitive event.

5-0 with [[Mana Wyrm]], [[Flamewaker]], [[Unstable Portal]] and [[Frostbolt]]

---
Who says that?
---
&gt;stop being wrong.
---
You first.
---
yeah this is the one.
---
I see your Ysera and raise you Naturalize for milling pleasure while you nibble your opponent to death with treants from Landscaping.  
---
That Ysera you've got there is pretty nice, it would be a shame if you... drew two more of them... and then had to discard them...
---
The coin flip was anything but. You have to survive 10+ turns and play a boat load of spells to have a chance to equalize or gain board state.  It's a fun card and not unfair at all due to the deck requirements to make it work.
---
The deck just didn‚Äôt make sense to me so I didn‚Äôt play it. That‚Äôs an interesting thought though. I‚Äôll try it again.
---
Maybe just make it 10 mana? 
---
But there is a reason.
---
Oh yeah. I certainly wouldn't expect that deck to win again...I switched away from it pretty quick. 
---
This feels like it has such a rich meta, Renounce warlock is super fun!
---
Found 2 more decks that are real fun.
---
Glow-Tron + Bronze Gatekeeper + Arcane Nullifier x-21 + Kangor's Endless Army.
---
It can create a Giant untargetable taunt wall or one big minion always just out of reach of angro being able to kill it and destroy it.
---
I wish this were a permanent game mode. There are so many fresh archtypes with their own sub play styles depending on bans. It creates a huge level of counterplay with playing towards your outs and trying to cripple their deck into giving you an advantage while trying to adjust your plan on what cards you have left. The more I play the more It feels like vanilla where each loss is a pretty fair match where the archtypes do have an innate advantage, but player difference can make an impact enough difference to make up for it.  The games that are lost really quick do to extreme highroll feel crazy enough to be more impressive than annoying like barnes in big priest, or atleast in my opinion.
---
I am currently at 62 wins, and I havent felt like there was any decks that were oppressive, just the more that the deck took advantage of the mechanics were always a higher tier and that there were few enough cards to make it feel like it has its own flavorful theme. Murkspark Eel feels like a natural predator to crackling razormaw lol. 
---
Sorry man. Don't know why they bothered to add the ban, it's a lot of fun, but in no way viable. 
---
They need a Deck of Legends brawl. Here's an idea: Play with any legendary cards you have, and fill the rest of the deck with random legendaries, favoring those that you specifically do not have in your collection. 
---
This sounds like people who just want to [give patches charge again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icsNbTkZBTs) but not deal with the repercussions.
---
The best you could hope for is that they would allow un-nerfed Yogg when playing against a friend. Anything beyond that and wild ladder goes to being half hour coin flips.
---
Agreed, I still occasion the subreddit but I quit hearthstone because of yog and cards like it.
---
I thought the exact same my first time! 
---
No, the current form makes more sense anyway. Plus it's how Shudderwock works as well, so it it would be inconsistent to change it back. We already have all the fun crazy Yogg clips we ever need, it was neat but I like the card better where You dying stops the chain.
---
Silverware golem and the warlock legendary spell gave me a turn 1 with coin 6x 3/3s. 
---
Very well edited
---
Photoshop and a default round brush, nothing too fancy
---
I definitely get your point, but IMO it's less that it's impossible for machines and more just a massive lack of data for off-meta decks. With more data the algorithm could actually know when it's creating a non-functional combo deck. Starting with a few off-meta cards would also be more likely to result in a unique deck if there was data on all the different decks that can successfully utilize them.
---
Getting the data is the real challenge though. We'd need something like weekly tournaments with various meta cards disallowed or total dust cost limitations. Forcing people to get creative with off-meta and budget decks would provide at least something approaching useful data to work with.
---
Watch him slap you with that hungry crab into Hemet Nessingwary...
---
I see severely limited deck wild brawl, I pick Metaltooth. It‚Äôs that simple
---
Had a lot of success with galvanizer, mechwarper, Jeeves, and metaltooth leaper
---
Can‚Äôt ban both discount cards, so they choose between a board fill with lots of hand refill, or board fill with huge attack buffs
---
You could cheat out millhouse easy enough - call to arms and that mech from boomsday. Then you just need a charge minion and sound the bells for an OTK with minimal set up. Don‚Äôt know how strong that would be, but a 3 card combo with not too much set up can‚Äôt be that bad, and I reckon paladin has the tools to go late game, although that equality nerf makes everything harder.
---
Control decks can built the druids hand so they can't UI, or simply mill them once They fill their hand. Unless you're at 5 health, then the rest of the card is mostly just general board interaction. 5 damage isn't that much, you can play around it the same way you do fireball or other single target burn spells. The armor is just health gain, you deal with that the entire game with druid since their HP heals them. And a 5/5 is just a minion. 
---
The only thing that makes UI feel unfair is the card draw which is simple to play around with things like coldlights, and class answers like naturalize and research project. 
---
I got matched up against a Mill Druid while playing with a Malch Druid. Surprisingly he played till the bitter end and it was glorious
---
InTeRnAl MiScOmMuNiCaTiOn
---
The idea is get  2 Radiant and cycle through Visions until Grave Horror costs 0 mana.
---
Pogo hopper and hope they don't ban them lmao 
---
Oh man I loved Dr. Strange
---
Bandersnoot Cumberbitch
---
I think it is his dad, who was a competent villain
---
Cumberbatch
---
Just won against malch Druid as mill Druid with Dark Nat Pagle. I just kinda punched him to death..
---
Well played, I thought it was orange hair too.
---
I ran trogg/claws/bolt/crackle for my one win
---
It's difficult to pin down wall priest to an archetype since it's also a midrange deck with buffs. It doesn't have an explosive otk, it has to rely the enemy running out of removal.
---
So it's weak to control decks that have more removal than they have threats. 
---
Well in the case of my Mecha'thun, better data would make it not Mecha'thun. It's missing plenty of cards necessary to survive long enough to reach the win condition. Having an impossible win condition was just adding insult to injury.
---
So Warlock, Shaman, Priest, Rogue, and Warrior?  And what does E.V.I.L. stand for, anyways?
---
Arcane Missles, Frostbolt, Primordial Glyph, Fireball
---
Oh no. Deckslots!
---
ugh, never!!!!11
---
Like what can you do other then quit?
---
Weird. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Mine mostly just touch me inappropriately.
---
Best part is that if he'd just played the Cold Blood on the Skulking Geist he still would have won.
---
cold light, naturalize, research project, dancing swords, grove tender, vanish, mukla, or even things like lotheb or mana wraith to make it harder for them to dump their hand 
---
Lol, I did the same with the warlock weapon for one game and then ditched it.
---
Did you also use black cat? They all banned flamewaker and i just won with black cat, arcane missiles every time. Babbling book wasn't really useful because they died too quickly. 
---
Thrillho Manastorm
---
5 years? I started 6 months ago and knew I had to craft him the moment I saw him. 
---
Leeroy is Hearthstone to me.
---
You‚Äôre so boring that you can‚Äôt think of a better deck than Baku? Wow. 
---
Any theories on why it puts Tinkmaster in a deck based on Dr. Boom, Mad Genious?
---
Bloody wanker, learn how to fucking read
---
You said 
---
&gt; Also even shaman is not a deck that needs a buff
---
and I replied
---
&gt; It wouldn't be a buff, no one would run that card.
---
I don't care if you came up with some random bullshit suggestion for odd shaman, I was referring to your affirmation that "even shaman does not need a buff".
---
Now please go find a shovel and stick it 3 meters up your ass.
---
holy shit
---
I would avoid that unless I were trying to argue specifically against the relative cost of Hearthstone versus other games using that business model... But I'm not really interested in that. Some games give more for your time, others less, but it's beside the point, all of them stand to benefit by calling it free, and the least I can do is not play along.
---
i doesn't seem to be doing very good but it's tier 3 according to vs https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wild-vs-data-reaper-report-16/ making an aggro deck would be cheaper and better i think.
---
Blizzard obviously need to make money on content so I do think that they should be paid for I just wish that after a long while they would be placed into the shop for me to just buy. I'm Disabled so leaving the house hard never mind go to a fireside. (I really wanted Nemsy) 
---
I also would have liked Rastakhan but at that time I could not afford it I would have if I could have.
---
I was super excited to see TWO cards glowing gold last week... until I saw Gonk the raptor and Halazi the lynx.
---
In the minion portrait on board it totally reads as a hunchy troll with a mohawk. 
---
No lol
---
So a leak? 
---
Yeah this one sucks to play against 
---
well ramp was fine before UI, so they destroyed ramp for 1 card.
---
Tell me how I can get a shaman card in my warlock deck
---
No dust benefit to crafting cards gold if you already have them, but if you want them gold, go for it. 
---
I must be aewsome then when my Opponant concedes I sometimes win in 0 turns
---
Crafted metaltooth leaper and the gorilla for this, easy 100 gold. I've been thinking about playing some wild for the hyper aggro decks like pirate warrior or something faster. 
---
i've been playing HS since beta and never opened a golden legendary until this year and my first one was THE GOLDEN GOD, this video has validated my existence
---
I can take a picture of the part of the screen that shows mana count and spend all my mana on turn 4 also.
---
What would you ban?
---
I‚Äôm sorry, this is **literally unplayable** now.
---
8 6/9 Battlecry: play all of the battlecries that you and your opponent have played for the last 10 games.
---
This is pretty neat. I wonder if the same thing happens for like the scroll thing and zerus
---
I would rather they just buff the original Millhouse. He's one of my few legendaries I've gotten from the classic packs and I can't help but feel sad I have him instead of something actually useful. 
---
4-0 with this deck so far, seems pretty good:
---
Shooting Star
---
Arcane Blast
---
Flamewaker
---
Black Cat
---
Most people have banned Flamewaker which is fine because Cat and Shooting Star carry
---
Mill Druid: Naturalize, Coldlight, Branching Paths, and Spellstone. 
---
Only deck I lost to was a control warrior that ran Dead Mans Hand. Super fun to play. 
---
At least Mana Wyrm won‚Äôt feel as bad now.
---
**Totem deck:**
---
[Totemic Might]
---
[Totemic Smash]
---
[Flametongue Totem]
---
[Thing from Below]
---
I think you will find he spent the Mana then took the photo
---
Dusting all but a handful of classes is a horrible idea. You'll get very little and make any long-term engagement with the game nearly impossible. You've only just started. Your plan will likely ensure that you'll quit fairly soon.
---
Is that possible?
---
I want the entrance sound to be like annoyotron but instead of hello he says " AAAAH AAAH AAAH"
---
photo is 0 cost lol
---
I beat this 2-0 with jadex3 rogue +hallucination
---
But ramp also limits design space for any future non-UI, strong, druid cards.  You basically couldn't design anything super powerful at 8-10 mana in druid forever because ramp would make it too good.  Killing ramp now because of UI also futureproofs future druid design.
---
This is fucking dope. Concept art is my dream job. 
---
There are two legendaries for each class, but the other mage legendary is also not Rhonin. It's Khadgar.
---
Priest is an EVIL class, so they won't have "good" legendaries. The other defender class is Druid.
---
I still think ‚ÄúBUY ONE!‚Äù is the funniest shit ever.
---
Shame i only hear that said in single player runs, started playing in Kobolds
---
Vereesa, not Alleria.
---
1. Alleria Windrunner is already a cosmetic Hero for Hunters.
---
2. Vereesa Windrunner is the leader of The Silver Covenant and wife of Rhonin. The Silver Covenant is the high elf faction residing in Dalaran and are opposed to Horde presence (The Sunreavers) in Dalaran. Rhonin was the leader of the Kirin Tor before his death at Theramore.
---
As for Sally Whitemane and Calia: Calia has no relation to Dalaran, I'm not sure why she's come up. Sally Whitemane features in her Four Horsemen form (Inquisitor Whitemane) in Uther of the Ebon Blade's Hero Power.
---
I personally don't think we'll see Turalyon or Calia in this expansion, they seem like ones you would keep until a more fitting expansion, like one based on the Burning Legion, or Lordaeron, or the undead.
---
Thank you üôè 
---
The true *believers* already have him in gold **praise yogg**
---
it just takes one good deathrattle inorder to make her into a good tutor
---
It was definitely unclear. I luckily put together a demon zoo deck. Soulfire, dark peddler, imp gang, and Malganys. Malganys got nixed. 
---
So this is how hs rebirth‚Ä¶ with thunderous applause.
---
Cards can gain bonus stats under the quest's effect!
---
I feel really sorry for you then
---
Is he new? Why have I never heard of him
---
First time I saw the deck I banned the mystery card which I assumed was Radiant Elemental. I mean looking at the Grave Horror it is obvious they want to cycle spells a lot.
---
Is it safe to assume whizbang is banned?
---
Tried replacing Myra with Mimic Pod. At least I have something to do early turn and 17/17 bunny is scary
---
This video has made me regret dusting my golden gruul . 
---
Still have a normal one but man I miss the old one 
---
Ban Malachazaar's Imp and its much worse. 
---
Best deck is Edwin Van Cleef, Pogohopper, Shadowstep, and Counterfeit coin.
---
Ban Edwin? Prepare for a bunch of Shadowstepped Pogohoppers
---
Ban Pogohopper? Prepare for a ton of coins and Shadowsteps on turn 1 for a big Edwin.
---
Literally went 10-0 and never made it past turn 4.
---
If they ban doomsayer this kind of just dies to every other deck
---
Any idea who the Dalaran druid will be?
---
1/3 ^8
---
Hs as esport is a bad joke 
---
If you like hooktusk, check out even rouge. Lotta fun before it rotates
---
It‚Äôs not effective at all tbh. Just plays a little trick on the mind. You see keleseth, you remove keleseth 
---
:O
---
\&gt;:D
---
I think because a lot of people don't play Wild, they don't know this combo.  As soon as I see Molten Giant in Paladin I look for Thekal.  Even if it is the hidden 4th card.  (That's why I like the ban rules of the brawl)
---
But now that Rogue knows better.
---
Isn't this Slimer fron the Ghostbusters?
---
Mech Hunter. End of story. 
---
 * Mechwarper
---
 * Galvanizer
---
 * Metaltooth Leaper
---
 * Your Mech of choice here. 
---
I'm a simple Smorc. I go Zillax.
---
Maybe you want to randomly buff your board with Enhance-o Mechano. Maybe you want some card draw and get yourself Jeeves. Annoy-o-Tron? The possibilities are literately every good mech.
---
It's gold Jerry, GOLD
---
I played jade shaman and jade rogue, Baku warrior, fatigue warrior, mech hunter various combo decks...
---
But in the end discard aggro warlock seemed the most consistent.
---
Succubus, Fist of Jaraxxus, Silverware Golem, Darkshire Librarian. It works pretty well no matter what card gets banned, and the lifetap let's you fight your way back against even pretty chunky minions since you're never running out of cards.
---
there will probably be a second stream.
---
90% of the collection. Basically every card back starting December 2014. Excluding golden card back and excluding that American college esports league 
---
I know Hemet is meme tier tech choice, but EMP OP is straight up unplayable. 
---
I pulled it off once with Hobgoblin. Just once. 
---
according to new trend its the best(or more versatile) version with Giant Anaconda
---
I mean... yeah, duh.
---
In a game mode where you have access to a deck comprised of only three cards, this is obviously going to be *way* too slow.

Warrior and Warlock seems possible. Hagatha has no direct conection to shape shifting / worgens. But rogues are "loosing" all their secrets with the rotation, kinda difficult to add secert interaction card, except they will get "Secreter Plan": Discover a secret from another class and i doubt that they will get a new spellstone because schemes and spellstones both are "upgrading".

Pro tip : the cards did not start in your deck so leyline manipulater is gold
---
I won with Glyph, Sorcerer apprentice, research project and Flamewaker. Turn 6 I goes infinite and started to mill half of the deck and goes to fatigue. Won win the "few" damage spell from Glyph.
---
Did you lose the match?

I loved my dragon pala with this guy (Dragon Consort), was amazingly good, as its not just for this turn, but whenever you want.

It is literally the only solo adventure that's given me so much trouble that I have to. Not even the Arthas challenge was as silly as this. I'm glad you had fun man but it's terribly designed when the enemy can just end your run with zero counter play.

MTGO is the older client. It was made to mirror paper magic 1:1, with trading, buying, selling, real drafts, release events with large player pools, no daily quests or free card rewards and not many ways to build a collection without paying. But since you can trade/sell, you can "cash out" by selling your collection and recoup some of your invested money. 
---
MTGA is the newer client. It has a better interface, flashy graphics, is easier to build a collection, modeled after other online games with generous card rewards, daily quests, and multiple currencies. However your collection has no value as you can't trade with players, so there is no way to recoup what you spend on the game.

I went with Mind Blast, Holy Fire, Mind Vision and Crystaline Oracle - Nothing like using your opponent's card's to beat them!  
---
Went up against a rogue who's entire plan was to play the opponent's class's cards and then Yogg them. I flipped that on them promptly - I don't care if they ban mind blast.
---

Now we need a shrek card game, the possibilities are endless.

---
Yogg was not fun at all, he almost caused me to quit hearthstone before he was nerfed.

A card that basically turns any game into a coinflip is not fun, it is not skillfull, it is not anything other than bullshit.

---
The powers that be know of the aesthetic annoyance here, too. They either don't care or have higher priority issues to resolve. 
---
The discard deck is pretty bad. I have faced it multiple times and never lost with my rogue deck of swashburglar, defias, eviscerate, blink fox. Just ban the draw 3 card and since fist cant choose target you build a board and win. I imagine murlocs would beat it for the same reason.
---
Good point. I'll try that!
---
Sorry to say, but we don't talk about luck in this very skill-based game. Don't undermine your ability to find your outs!
---
The jealous you harbor should be let go.

Golden whiz is the only golden card I ever crafted. Fun for the first few weeks of an expansion to test out the new cards, also to flex on other player with your golden coin when you go second.

It's fucking Blizzard. They've gone downhill for ages now. Once the best company, now one I don't trust anymore. Not as bad as Konami, or Bandai Namco, or Ubisoft, but pretty awful these days. No proper balancing, no thought put into anything, bugs like this still exist for ages, etc.

But why does this matter? Doesn't Block by definition means "Block all communication with X person" ?

So it's time to start saving up gold.
---
Who was in the final and who won?
---
Aside from being distributed in wings, they don't really have much in common with the old adventures. They're basically just expanded versions of the solo content we've been getting since Dungeon Run. There won't be any exclusive cards locked behind wings, so the rewards are just there as an incentive to purchase. It's ultimately more about the solo content.
---
Neat idea but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll work with the secret package, especially with two of each being included. Having, say, one of each and including five so that Subject 9 draws all secrets from the deck for you to play at once would increase consistency.
---
I was happy for the memes when I got him but then was immediately sad
---
I did not remove him I only blocked him.
---
One would assume, block will prevent a person from communicating with you. At least that's how it works everywhere else (In Steam for example)
---
It's amazing how poorly people use the ban mechanic.

I'm sorry you had to find out this way but weve been playing a shitty mobile game this whole time

Divine spirit/ Inner fire is not a one turn combo, I hate wall Priest as well don't think i'm trying to defend that bs of a deck, but you are wrong at stating that is uninteractive, you can pretty much interact with their strategy by trading/removing all their high health taunts, this is a hard thing to do in a tempo deck but hey aggro can have counters as well you know?. I hoped for them to move divine spirit to the hof but for some reason they didn't, i guess they spect the deck to be inviable without shadow visions, so just be patient. But unless they reprint cards like fungalmancer tempo strats would be weak as well. If the next expansion is not impactful enough (seems to be a really impactful one) the meta will be Masquerade Hunters and tempo shamans.

was this an arena match?

Also worth noting that it is a Standard rotation: all of your current cards can still be used in the Wild format, in single-player modes, and in many of the Tavern Brawls.

---
As of right now, the strongest Mechathun decks are taking big hits from rotation. I'm sure they'll still be around but they may be a lot weaker than their current iterations.  For example, warrior mechathun and hunter mechathun exist already but they are not very good.
---
Personally, I dont think there's gonna be any truly viable mechathun decks. but of course we have to wait and see whats printed.

play on mobile then.

If you're not going to provide the curtesy of conceding when lethal is presenting, why should I provide the curtesy of making it as quick as possible when you had the option to make the it the quickest?

Yep
---
It's probably a villain Locked up in Violet Hold
---
Or simply a faceless card related to Priest
---
So I guess that a card will be revealed in this video since we should get one right at this moment. 
---
Also both videos (this and the one from the reveal schedule) are currently unavailable, they must be same ones.
---
Grats!

---
Pretty meh card. Probably won‚Äôt see play unless Enrage Warrior is good but I doubt it will
---
Trash is way too tough on it.
---
Seems like a more control variant of blood of ichor which saw play in tempo decks.
---
Seems like it could be strong. 4 mana 4/5 is a solid stat line, plus the mech tag for mech synergies, and is late game removal for basically anything.

Yikes straight to the "I've got no credibility so I have to ask him what his rank is as if it matters" card. I hit legend every season on multiple regions, if that actually matters to your narrow-minded understanding. 
---
What you don't get is that it's Rexxar on top of everything else in the hunter's deck. Once you have Rexxar up you just slowly gain card advantage every turn. You're drawing twice every turn with Rexxar, whereas you only draw once with Warrior, with limited card generation tools in its deck. 
---
Whatever, go ask around and you'll come to get it once you get laughed at for making such jokes. 
---
I agree about hungry crab and gollaka being lazy/uninspired but I wouldn't exactly compare this to Chief Inspector. At least Chief inspector is a rare with better stats and IMO has a better battlecry in the right match up. Chief inspector is at least a playable card on tempo against a class that doesn't use secrets. This card is horrible to play on tempo against anything but the rare mech paladin or a deathrattle hunter/rogue that is running the mechanical welp.  TBH I don't understand why this is an epic but maybe the coming rotation/expansion will make sense of it.
---
You could make a pre deck sure, but usually you see people seeking or help medicine to avoid that...

Oh damn my B, didn't realize it was all minions, thought it was just friendly. I would like to revise my opinion, seems good now

They changed it because it looked like a mech even tho omega defender isn't a mech. Since this card is actually a mech there's no problem.

Wow! I like that they‚Äôre bringing back Omega- I thought it was a cool concept from Boomsday that wasn‚Äôt printed on enough cards. Not sure if this card will see any play but it looks very good on paper, especially in Arena
---
it just seemed like it wouldnt be good at a higher mana cost.
---
team 5 probably playtested it at 2 mana and was too strong
---
Not sure. They could add a card like curse of rafaam, increasing its damage the longer you hold it?
---
I have an iphone 6 and it definitely crashes ALL. THE. TIME. It had been sort of fine until the last update, when partway through games the app becomes so laggy, that in order to play 3 cards it uses up my entire turn. I'll crash at the end of a game sometimes. Or maybe when I hit "brawl" and it finds a player, but I crash. When I reopen the app, it tells me I was unable to reconnect to the game. Or maybe I'm going to create a deck. Randomly during that deck creation the app will crash. Or when I'm disenchanting some cards. That will set it off sometimes before I have a chance to hit the mass disenchant button.
---
I have an iPhone 6 (not plus, just the 6) and feel like I've always had issues, but never this bad.

Thanks for posting. Without you, no one would have ever know this card existed.
---
This curving into zilliax is a good point I hadn't considered.
---
Welp, this card seems horrible then. Rafaam, meet my good friends; fan of knives, whirlwind, warpath, and consecration. 
---
Of course, but Cruel Tasmaster is unplayable, so it'd need to be a lot better to be good. The differences add up.
---
Spirit of the bat/Witch's cauldron work well. 
---
Nice, soo knife juggler egg zoo?
---
Nah, they're not much better. Spare parts would be useless in today's meta compared to 5 years ago, so obviously Lackeys are evolved to fit the power creep. Doesn't make them good. 1/1s with a small pool of situational effects are not good.
---
\*10\* damage? man thats alot. I thought with just 5 damage it would still be damn good. 
---
Comparable to slam and I would argue it's better since lackeys seem pretty strong. Also it doesn't actually draw you a card which is important in a control warrior deck, instead it generates value. I can't see this card ever being just a dead one in your hand like slam sometimes is.
---
They've been around and will be around forever with many overlooked complaints.
---
Also comes out of \[\[Omega assembly\]\] and the discover a mech hero power
---
Maybe. Unless we see some "minion numbers matters" cards coming this expansion though, it just feels *really* awkward. Grim Rally doesn't seem to be enough personally.
---
This at worst is a mech-Yeti and slowly becomes Mech-crowd Roaster but being a Mech can me used with some neat magnetic cards 3.5 stars.
---
Combine this with Grim Rally and/or Demonbolt in a Midrange/Token Warlock deck, and this card can create some scary swing turns. It doesn't fit in any current archetypes, but that doesn't mean it's a bad card.

Yeah literally every AoE will wipe them unless they get buffed with Grim rally
---
If I asked my parents about this, they'd tell me to get another job.
---
&gt; playtested
---
haha
---
Hell yeah!
---
Yeah, seriously. Also makes me wonder what Rafaam and Hagatha could bring. Main thing with LoE was Discover (which is still around) and Reno effect.
---
Could also just be Rafaam being the Golden Monkey, but he says in the video "bring a card *with* them" and only showed Forbidden Words.
---
Worgen would make the most sense for Hagatha, since Rush is still around.
---
I bet Dr Boom gonna discover this card a lot
---
Controlling warrior success was highly correlated with Tank Up.
---
And Fiendish Circle is already a worse Imp-losion. 
---
Rafaam's callback is indeed himself.
---
Remember that you have to pay 1 more mana for the lackey effect though. I'd argue the +1 attack and rush and the summon a random two drop are cards you probably don't want out of this.
---
Good card for Gadgetzan Auctioneer for a possible mecha'thun decks. If this actually becomes a thing I'mma link back to this comment and say 'called it!'
---
Just you wait unti have 10 mana!
---
In other words; you have nothing. Okay, fair enough.
---
I suppose unacceptable causalities would be things like going back into time to kill your grandfather.
---
Nah he is not dead he just lulling the defender into a false sense of secrurity the fact that most of hin fit's in a matchbox is merely a Flesh Wound
---
The link is dead, so I‚Äôm removing this. The video has already been posted as well.
---
Lv. 1 gear, tbh.
---
no one can take his candle...
---
Hagatha i could see either echo or the shift ability some of the worgen cards had. Togwaggle would have spellstone. Rafaam i could see something similar to curse of rafaam called like curse of E.V.I.L.
---
You can also just play a 4/5 mech on turn for and ziliax on turn5 for big heals
---
Rafaam himself is the callback card (Elise/Golden Monkey)
---
They go away once your MMR increases.
---
dragon warrior is pretty solid right now. people play a crowd roaster 7/7/4 bc deal 7 damage, they would definitely play a mech variant with a 4/4/5 deal 10 damage WITH RUSH (from Dr. Boom) not to mention between this and the light the fuses mech, warrior removal from omega assembly is going to be b-a-n-a-n-a-s
---
that was actualy funny. thanks for the laugh
---
Lmao how are you comparing it to Walk the Plank when there‚Äôs Assassinate. 
---
Ugh, that card. Between the 5 damage battlecry and this Omega assassinate on a stick, good luck ever sticking a board against control warrior.
---
both words conveyed a specific meaning I wanted to include, (a) their changes were inspired by boredom implying it was unimportant but they had nothing better to do and (b) they were themselves presumptuous people who thought they had the authority to steer the whole language just because they were fancy and had nothing to do. originally I wrote this as two separate clauses but combined them specifically because it was simpler so yeah it was fairly on point with my overall message here but thanks for trying 
---
&gt; "farther" and "further" don't, in fact, sound the same when spoken. 
---
I didn't mean the words are homonyms, I mean if you replace them for each other in any given sentence it doesn't sound jarring to a native speaker. this (along with ambiguity) is a possible reason for a language rule existing, for example it's not technically correct to say "old little lady" or describe the noise a clock makes as "tock tick" but these *feel* wrong to us for some reason, so if somebody was learning English for the first time these are the sort of things that would be taught. I don't believe anyone really cares about farther vs. further, neither of them ever 'feel wrong,' they're barely even distinct words, farther just emerged as a variant of further probably because it made sense to people that it should contain the word 'far.'
---
Nah yours is better because of the cost
---
Holy wrath, 25 cost tiger, 20 cost giant. That 3 mana 34 legendary which turns all health to armor.
---
Well, at least fucking Defile is rotating away...
---
https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/1108784093402198016
---
And now it's good too.
---
It‚Äôs not comparable to Big Game Hunter and you are clearly a dirty constructed player because BGH is bad in Arena. 
---
Great arena card. Probably good control warrior card
---
I 100000% agree this is a shitpost. Just wanted to say something haha
---
Id say add me but i never ever win
---
sure, same playtesters said webweave is too strong for 5 mana. Here, I'll help you on the name - [[webweave]].
---
Here's a [word cloud](https://i.imgur.com/Vr1H7HN.jpg) of this comment section. Great way to identify patterns and trends.
---
That's hilarious. What's your decklist?
---
On turn 10 you can play this and zilliax magnetized to it :0
---
I'm guessing divine shield + hand full of 1 mana +3 attack cards + card draw. Doesn't work well against any kind of real rush. 
---
What would you recommend?
---
It has already been conifmed that Rafaam himself is the callback card for LoE. His battlecry is a reference to golden monkey.

Yeti on suicide watch 
---
Warrior keep getting these cards that require you to damage a minion but has barely any cards that benifit from that damage in a significant way - 1 star
---
I know, I‚Äôm trying to be patient haha
---
Make a thread like I did.
---
but aren't their much better things you can do while going off with Auctioneer than shuffle cards that won't trigger auctioneer? Rogue isn't exactly hurting for cheap spells.
---
I thought healbot was ok because his stats were terrible but Zilliax is just an auto include in so many decks rn 
---
3 mana 7/7
---
While Discover is certainly the safest choice, how is this distinctive from other cards with Discover?
---
This is actually a really good point. There are a lot of situations where you're warrior against OTK and you have to try to rush the enemy down. Draw this turn 10 or later and you're probably sad.
---
are dumping unused cards from old expantions?
---
blizzard definitely tested it at 2 mana, which means that either:
---
- it was broken at 2 mana on its own as a general pick
---
- they‚Äôre printing more wide board/token support this expansion and this card was too good with the supporting cards
---
Aviana + Glinda?
---
Wait, that's illegal!
---
In my one match against the deck, that was my experience. Edwin was hidden, so I banned pogo hopper. And though my opponent got a 12/12 Edwin on turn 1 and did some major damage with it, all of his momentum died when Edwin died. One of the swingiest games I‚Äôve had yet in this brawl.  
---
Yup, warrior still has town crier too, so it's going to happen a lot.
---
Imagine an announcement a week before the expansion. Cards like Fiery War Axe, Nourish, Hex, Ancient of Lore are unnerfed. People would go crazy.
---
First of all, how dare you.
---
looks meh compared to other schemes
---
What about Multi 21, tho? Why did you overtake Webber?
---
I can believe it happened, it's just super /r/cringe
---
Nice card! But I hate it, since I hate to play against zoo haha
---
Seems less scary than the other schemes at first glance
---
Do the imps get stronger or do you just summon more?
---
Don't know if you put this into a deck but it's a good buff to Omega Assembly
---
With the Hex nerf being a simple mana change, I just assume that Blizzard didn't change it on whatever they use to playtest/show off unreleased cards.
---
Reminds me a lot of \[\[vilespine slayer\]\]. Conditional removal on a body. Vile spine requires comboing, while the requires 10 mana. Combing can be done before turn 10, but this is 4 mana and warrior already has mech synergies. This card is really strong
---
Will be a 2 of if control warrior is a viable deck
---

5/3/4 | Combo: Destroy a minion.  
---
That Talanji lol
---
I also hate nearly all the tech cards in this game, they‚Äôre so unbelievably swingy and poorly designed with a few exceptions 
---
I wear them when working out. 
---
I'm gonna buy the new expansion simply because the auto deck builder feature is really cool but more and more I have had to convince my two other friends that still kind of play. to continue to buy in.  
---
This time around they are both completely out no matter how much I try and sell them on it.  I don't know a single person that even does dailies anymore and and at one point I knew 5 people.
---
Blizzard always does this.  They rest on their laurels giving only the minimum because they are on top then when shit gets dire they finally step up but by then everyone has bailed on the game. 
---
I thought this was the custom Hearthstone subreddit at first and thought this was overpowered, but I love Mech Warrior and will definitely be running this!
---
Its like juggler unleash without charge
---
Goldorak??
---
Inner Rage is better with both of those cards and it never saw much play in Control warrior decks.
---
Hi! Nickname and battletag? please
---
Give a random friendly minion +1/+1
---
Dont add people off reddit..... haha jk
---
Even if the mana cost upgraded, 7 7/7 demons for 7 is pretty good
---
That deck sounds awesome. I can‚Äôt work out if you win or lose if I ban thekal and I‚Äôm playing one of the stupid aggressive decks (hunter crackling razormaw, mind blast, sorcerers apprentice Mage. Etc) because obvious you can‚Äôt do anything till turn 5, and in most cases you‚Äôd be dead by then right?
---
blood of ichor is probably closer and that card was pretty good
---
I, intellectual, got Zulljin week after crafting [[Subject 9]] for some halfassed secret hunter deck, and my first response was "huh, what an useless slow card"
---
HenryDaWound#1316 NA trading 80g friend quest. I'll show but you go 1st please. Got ripped off last time
---
I wasn't sure about that either but even if it were, it would still be worse than Muster for battle. Just not strictly so. 
---
Not that I care much about heroism, but uh... when do we get to meet the heroes?
---
Are there heroes?
---
HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA HAHAA

Each player has a deck of 4 cards. You each ban one of the other players cards then your deck is filled with 10 copies of each of the other 3 remaining cards that your opponent didnt ban

three free legendaries of your choice... pretty nice!

Aldo kinda looks like some early League arts (these would be Ryze, Wukong, Morg and Gragas)
---
At this point it may be a sign
---
Seems like worse [[Blood to Ichor]] in general
---
If it survived one turn, you feasibly could have an OTK of sorts. Would be more for the memes I would imagine, but two shrieks, 2 schemes, and the coin or some other 0 cost card. That's 24 damage in one turn. Doesn't seem practical, but who knows? 
---
No cards left, BAM bust out 200 imps bc the game glitches out

---
1/-/- | Deal 1 damage to a minion. If it survives, summon a 2/2 Slime.  
---
I think an unidentified card is more likely than a spellstone because Rogue already had a spellstone but never an unidentified item.  This is the same case for the Forbidden mechanic with Priest or the Omega mechanic with Warrior.  
---
yeah but blood to ichor was very good. and im betting lackeys are going to be good the whole year
---
Oooh thanks! Sounds like fun. I can‚Äôt seem to get my hearthstone to start. Kinda feeling like I‚Äôm missing out :(
---
I think this is going to be really pretty horrible to play against when Warrior discovers this.
---
None o y‚Äôall appreciate a good pun asmh
---
Cool take. I use circle of healing and northshire as I don't have wild cards. I feel like light of naaru is better.
---
Super underwhelming
---
They could have played amara and then jaraxxus later on (weapon is still a 3/8 so it might have been played recently) as he resets your health and armour and leaves you with 15 max health. But it is the less likely scenario here
---
Yeah this is terribly designed. It has no connection to the Rafaam card in the set, no connection to Rafaam‚Äôs character at all. What were they thinking? This just makes me sad.
---
Thanks for posting the source! Missed that comment 
---
This is an easy 100 point card in the arena. Absolutely insane.
---
* How would she? Are you referring to when/if the Priest managed to add a second copy of the card to their hand/deck?
---
   * In which case, it makes perfect sense given the wording on the card as the second copy could not have started the game in the Priest's deck.
---
* A dead minion cannot attack. Additionally, allowing dead minions to attack would make the card into a five mana Twisting Nether at best, and double the length of time the animation takes to resolve at worst.
---
Ah the legendary [Tinkmaster Overspark]
---
Yeah forgot about that Transform for a sec there.
---
I KNOW, I can‚Äôt even log into my blizzard account on mobile so I have no friends
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs quite as strong as Ritual, but Knife Juggler is still played at times, most of the heal package is rotating, we already have Grim Rally, and holding this card doesn‚Äôt get it to the same power level as Ritual, it gets it stronger. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a powerhouse, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of room to be worse than Ritual but still playable. Particularly in the first set of a year.  It summons demons, too, which Ritual didn‚Äôt. That could be relevant with something like a new Crystalweaver type card. 
---
I've had fun with my Warlock deck:
---
[[Curse of Rafaam]]
---
[[Gnomesferatu]]
---
[[Renounce Darkness]]
---
[[Imp-losion]]
---
Bans vary, but idea is to load the enemy hand with Curses and Renounce around turn 7 if it isn't banned
---
Don't try to climb out of "new player ranks" (50-25/20) too quickly, rank 20 is where the real competition starts and you'll get crushed a lot by people with bigg collections and best decks and the game will become significantly less fun.

---
amen
---
Bruh moment
---
How is no one talking about this lmao
---
Maybe once you'd hit the summon 7 imps they'd start getting +1 attack per round
---
It was streamed on wesg_hs.
---
yeah I'm pretty sure it's a joke
---
Interestingly enough, if you Mulligan quest, your opponent can discover it with curious glimmerroot, that's not what happened this particular game, but it does infact work
---
Damn. Can't argue with you there, but warlock has access to this card.
---
Its wild its pretty fun. I found the best decks dont rely on single cards as they will get banned. I ran egg druid with devilsaur and nerubian eggs and mark of the lotus and branching paths, that way no matter what got banned my gameplan would still work
---
Pretty disappointed with the Warrior cards. I‚Äôm of the mind the warrior shell is gonna be: Rush package, dynomatic, zilliax, Boom, omega assembly. 
---
And neither of these cards replace anything or make their way into the deck. The lackey ping is nice, but slam is nicer. 
---
Pretty shit cards revealed the past bit here. Cmon Blizzard, show us the good stuff. 
---
They already said this was a mistake 
---
Ya playing a dead format for a living would definitely force you to be creative. I don‚Äôt how he does it. 
---
double prophet 8)

I'd view it more as tech, and worst case either a ping or an acolyte trigger.
---
Youtube worthy 
---

I don't own any wild card and I don't own many standard cards either so I skip mody of the create your own deck brawls

That was my assumption, thanks for the clarification.
---
Totally agree
---
No I called it :)
---
Prepare to lose every game. Any opponent with half a brain will pick Thekhal and leave you without any play whatsoever until turn 5.
---
yeah, otherwise he could catch a cold
---
I don't see how this could beat any of the crazy aggro decks I've been playing against.  Like the hunter decks with little beasts, or the jade rogue.

Rafaam is definitely Thanos. Next expansion will be some sort of Darnassas Avengers that‚Äôll end in a snap. The last one will be Hearthstone: End Game.
---
3 mana hireek. Nice. 
---
I've always wanted to know how this card interacts with healing rain, but never bothered to try it. Anyone know?
---
Which is bullshit because it‚Äôs Taiwan.

Make that 23 mana as he will have 5 mana crystals.

Im running kyrtstal smith kongor and ring the bells after a few runs, it seems unbeatable

Good post, probably took a lot of time compiling.  I wish the Calendar was active with the reveal times like past expansions.  Though I did lose sleep seeing one would release in another 30 min and stay up for it.
---
This post is gonna get removed because mods don't want images other than low effort screenshots.
---
Naturalize ban and you lose to fatique, gg
---
If Fungalmancer wasn‚Äôt rotating I would see potential. Maybe some synergy with Grim Rally. Otherwise this card is pretty average. 
---
How does this beat a full board of mechs turn 2?
---
Divine shield is also a pretty important qualifier, but this card is pretty close to destroy target creature get a yeti for 4, and if you can't wait until 10 you still get passable 4 mana tempo
---
Maybe it's boring to you but some people like to play the game more than they like to think about deck building, or even worse, deck optimizing.
---
It's a Yeti that you can't really play until turn ten. It's decent. 
---
CRUSADES IN THE DAYS OF RAGE!
---
No lol. They just ban your combo.
---
It‚Äôs all aggro. Jade shaman, discard warlock, murlocs, even mech hunter is better than that combo 
---
I always thought it was from KMFDM. I didn't realize it was older then that.
---
&gt; Weird how they didn't bring something back from GVG but chose to do Boom's recent expansion.
---
Considering there are still more than 100 cards to be revealed I would hold off on making sweeping complaints like this. 
---
Aviana Glinda is just fucked up holy shit
---
You don't play this in zoo, you play it in a yet-to-be-a-thing token lock archetype.
---
Zoo doesn't really want a board of 1/1s, it needs those board spaces for medium-sized threats. And fungalmancer is rotating.
---
It could have been Add 1 card from your opponent's class to your hand. Upgrades each turn!
---
It has to be 3 Health at once iam Pretty sure. Healing Rain heals 1 than 1 again and so on.
---
Does nothing.
---
Superstone: Smash of Brothers
---
What if this is "As seen from above" ? 
---
really? I don't remember paying for her.
---
I didn't until I read the comment actually. I literally thought it was suuuuper funny after realizing it. That's the honest truth. But if you wanna be mean that's fine dude
---
Op as heck tho
---
Well it's a mage secret at 2 mana so it's not a secret. All mage secrets are 3 mana. It is also extremely wordy and a 3 mana resummon any minion the opponent wants possibly with 1 health is really really bad. It would see no play.
---
Shit you're right, that's like, the whole point of the OTK deck.
---
You don't know how sweet that is, rush warrior is an amazing deck but the odd/even plague ruins it, because it's boring to play, boring to play against. Rush would lose good cards like grommash, Keleseth, blood razor and Lich King, but I think it'll do alright post rotation. Rank 6
---
ITT Jealous players who can't afford or are not willing to pay for a hero portrait
---
If building a deck of cards in a card game is a chore might I suggest a different genre of gaming because deck building is fundamental in a card game. To take that away and play with premade decks goes against the genre. 
---
You're down at the catacombs with your girl, and this guy slaps her ass. What do you do?
---
Except they ban Whizbang 90% of the time
---
The orcs from that anime "That time i got reincarnated as a slime"?
---
I guess that's true. I was already using Amazon Prime and Twitch Prime so it felt like a bonus to a service I already used. But the people who bought the service to get her, definitely paid for Tyrande.
---
Yeah this is super high tier for sure in arena. Great on curve and great late game. You sacrifice absolutely nothing in terms of stats for the high upside 
---
I like the occasional deckbuilding Brawl
---
Slow down!
---
Truth
---
Yeah, beginning of last year I would have about 6-7 friends playing Hearthstone daily. Now I see about one that goes on just to do quests or something. It's sad
---
That pyro topdeck must've felt great
---
4 cards is the absolute limit.  
---
The zenith was that two card brawl
---
If your collection is too small to play without crafting cards, waiting is better.
---
I played thief priest vs deathrattle priest in wild yesterday and Thaddius ended up being summoned like 9 times that game. 
---
About 950,000 subscribers.
---
I Personally enjoyed my cheap elemental shaman but any rouge deck with pogo hopper is automatically good. Also just look through some posts and people have been sharing their decks. A popular one to get posted is 1 hp Paladin with molten giants.
---
whats ur 4th card, that list looks real meme?
---
My favourite brawl ever turned to be the one with 6 unique cards deck that refilled when you drew all. Let's say that 12/12 Van Cleef turn 1 was pretty good and even bigger on later turns.
---
Basically a different type of Mana that you draw.  Like lands in MTG.
---
Dad legend is ‚Äúlegend‚Äù for people without enough time to grind to legend or are bad at the game.

---
Finally! The mechathun combo we‚Äôve been waiting for!
---
This is like how I only play Mystery Heroes in Overwatch
---
More like Sorcerer's Apprentice on steroids.
---
That is why I quit the game - it is just so repetitive due to the lack of different game modes.  
---
I agree, and feel the same about witchwood
---
He is making fun of you
---
I'm happy you liked your purchases. I wish Blizzard provides even more cosmetic customization, but picking heroes and card backs is still fun.
---
Thanks.  Will give it a try. 
---
Yup. This is the make or break expansion for me. 
---
With the ‚Äúold mechanics returning‚Äù theme in this expansion, it feels like they know it too. I could even see this expansion being made to soften a blow for a hearthstone shutdown, getting the Heroes of the Storm treatment. The game is stale. It hasn‚Äôt been popular for 3 years now and it‚Äôs dead on twitch and Reddit. It kind of sucks, because it seemed to always be in the ‚Äúfuture potential‚Äù stage, but it just never moved out of it. People got fed up with the crap and quit. 
---
Sorry if this seems overly pessimistic. I enjoyed this game as well, hit legend a few times, I have played for 4ish years. I would play for hooours. I‚Äôve played against players like Naimath, Ant, Hotform. It was really fun but my interest has increasingly dwindled as the game stagnated. It became repetitive. Boring. Oh well. 
---
The death of a game is always a sad thing, and I‚Äôll always remember hearthstone for introducing me to the world of strategy/puzzle/card video games. 
---
I feel like this going to end up on hearthstone circlejerk now lol, but oh well
---
I‚Äôll come back on rotation other then doing quests saving up gold I don‚Äôt play much anymore
---
That's what friends are for
---
Good to know.  It used to be garbage if I recall correctly 
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk just posted this lol

Thanks for reminding me this game exists. I dont play anymore. But hey.... at least its not fortnite or minecraft.

The part that is fun about the constructed brawls is that they develop a meta and it's interesting to see an entirely new meta develop out of a seemingly simple game.  For instance the "pick 2 cards" and your deck gets filled with those cards was so fun.  It started with people doing like radiant + mind blast things and murkspark eel + flametongue and eventually really weird decks like shield block + upgrade! developed as a response that beat OTK decks and still had pressure.

The great part about limiting your play time to 30 minutes is you only disconnect 15 times.
---
Understood.
---
Mobile players feels this
---
People downvoting you getting wooshed
---
Happy cake day
---
Exact same for me 
---
I'll definitely look into it, I hope Warrior gets enough dragon synergy to push it to Dragon priest levels of amazing. 
---
Congrats on win. I‚Äôm glad to see people dealing with wall priest. Because of its low mastery level it‚Äôs becoming more and more common on ladder and is honestly a very oppressive and uninteractive deck.

Cathedral Gargoyle is rotating out.
---
Deck code plz
---
no memeS, with an S. we're allowed one. 
---
Greetings from /r/all, can anyone explain this meme to me?
---
Oof
---
It had a free trial back then. You had to cancel it before next month, though (if you didn't need amazon prime).
---
Another advice is : if you don't have opened any of those packs yet (Un'goro, frozen throne, kobolds), you might want to open at least a few. You have a legendary guaranteed in the first ten pack. If you don't plan to play wild it will give you easy dust with those legendaries.
---
Wow, that is accurate
---
Yeah fucking hell /u/Multi21 try harder next time smh 
---
I used naturalize, forest guide, mountain giant and ferocious howl, so no matter what I have either hand druid or Mill druid which are both terribly strong in a just 3 cards format 
---
&gt;\&gt; LOL I like how you immediately dropped the inflation arguement when I proved you wrong, and you're still ignoring my point.
---
Ha, I dropped it because there‚Äôs literally no argument to be had‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never paid $100 for a Mario game. No one has. End of argument.¬†  
---
Yes, inflation exists. Doesn‚Äôt change what people paid for it.¬†
---
&gt;\&gt; Mario was a bigger investment for a kid back then compared to buying a game today. People expect more features, longer and more support, but they want to pay less.
---
You‚Äôre completely ignoring that the competition and market is exponentially larger today than it was back in the 80s, but OK.¬†
---
Besides, that‚Äôs not uncommon in tech-driven industries. Computers cost less and offer more features now compared to that time period as well‚Ä¶what of it?¬†
---
&gt;\&gt; That's absolutely false, Game prices have stayed constant. Their value has only gone down due to inflation, unlike everything else where the price has increased to match inflation. Chocolate that costed a nickel then doesn't cost 3 cents now, and if you did that would be crazy.
---
Yes, game prices HAVE STAYED CONSTANT. As in, people used to pay $50 for games decades ago. Not $100.¬†
---
Can you not see how you‚Äôre just contradicting yourself? Probably not I suppose. 
---
&gt;\&gt; You can complain that games have too many transactions after the fact,¬†*or*¬†you can complain they don't have enough content. But you can't expect developers to give you more of both. 
---
Nice binary strawman argument. 
---
Truth is I can expect that supply and demand will create a balance in regards to cost and value‚Ä¶ any other assumption on your part is absolutely pointless and meaningless. 
---
If developers continue to create bigger games in an increasingly efficient manner, that's what will dictate content and pricing. 
---
&gt;\&gt; Game developers need to pay for those million dollar games somehow, and saying "just sell more copies" is a bullshit argument in an age where people want to play games for years.
---
Ha, no it isn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ the only bullshit argument here is yours.¬†
---
Ever heard of a game called Red Dead Redemption 2? It sold three-quarters of a BILLION dollars in THREE DAYS!
---
Guess how they did that?¬†
---
***JUST SOLD MORE COPIES.***
---
&gt;\&gt; They aren't buying new games all the time, they're buying new content for old games.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äúall the time‚Äù, but people certainly are still buying new games en masse.¬†See paragraph above for details. 
---
Just hit ‚Äûdone‚Äú it will auto create a deck. Works 50% of the time for me. Other 50% I have to adjust or netdeck.
---
Yeah, the part that follows after is pretty cringy. But I just quickly googled up the article as it's still good summary of what happened until the first twitter embeds, instead of, you know, writing it myself.

This was the old art for omega defender...
