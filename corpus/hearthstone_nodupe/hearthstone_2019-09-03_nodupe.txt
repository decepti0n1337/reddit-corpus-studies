I love the idea. I do think there could be a bit more tweaking to it since I feel like there are a few too many balance changes, and some are a bit much, while others are too little.

Hey, man.
---
I started playing this deck today, and I am 0-9. It doesn't work, at least not at my rank.
---
Yeah, I believe they did a golden legendary for the big bundle.. I got a Prince Liam that I memed for a couple days before dusting him.
---
The issue then is "You added 15 minions to your deck, but your board only has 7 slots (6 with Marsh Queen), so you're dooming the majority of those raptors to destruction."
---
I really find it funny how people are framing it like this is an amazing deal.
---
They axed Adventures which cost only $20 to get all 45 cards, including Legendaries and duplicates because 'reasons' like Adventures didn't mix up the meta enough even though they were fully in control of how many cards they could include within the content package.
---
I disagreed with their decision, but I bit my tongue because at least they baked it into Expansions with free packs and sometimes free content (e.g. Arthas skin).
---
Of course, then they decide to re-monetize the content, except instead of giving us a fixed set of cards like they did in the past where you didn't have to spend a crazy amount of money to get content, they now give packs and a single guaranteed Legendary. 
---
To really underscore the disparity of what's being offered, an Expansion is 3x the size of Adventure. Yet buying this single player content won't get you a third of the cards of SoU. It couldn't be more clear their decision to axe Adventures wasn't about the dev reasons, it was just about the fact that the packs model has a much higher upper limit for spending as compared to Adventures.

###*Yawn yawn YAAAWN!!!*
---
^^***yawnyawnyawn***
---
That’s because you’re comparing two very different things. The only similarities are superficial.
---
All of the dragons turn into humanoids I believe
---
Which is execute's mana cost...so...
---
Except when this used to happen to me (a year ago) it was usually a bot :(
---
What’s the point of comparing the two when they’re so completely different? Old adventures weren’t optional content that was disconnected from the main game. They *were* the main game. Regardless of how you feel about adventures vs expansions, they have virtually nothing to do with this new solo content.
---
Literally never has worked for me. I even give them a second chance by ending my turn early and they always keep roping
---
Yep! 3 day ban to start out and if they continue then permaban that shit. 
---
This is why society needs prisons, wish we didn't, but it's fucks like this that make it so we do
---
First I play barnes
---
I actually won my first 3 rumbles in a row and was wondering why everyone was complaining about it. Then on my next run I ended up against the triple deathrattle priest shrine.
---
I had one guy with nothing death my 10/10 taunt then onyx spellstone my 4-12 taunt and summon like 4 big minions. Another guy summoned 7 locust then cast stormbringer lol.
---
Usually when you rope them back they give up after 2 or 3 turns.
---
The only things that have ever been locked behind a paywall are hero skins and card backs. All adventures and the Dalaran Heist and presumably Tombs of Terror can be bought with gold.
---
How come its not viewable in the shop or in-game?
---
Mate, you are on 3hp against a full board. What were you expecting? Millhouse, Cho and the concede button?
---
i remember quite clearly there's no golden legendary for witchwood prepurchase
---
Probably missing something, but how does that work? Each corrupted blood shuffles more into your deck, so just one mischief maker isn't good enough, unless you play it when you're in fatigue right after hakkar dies. Also, if your opponent's deck is also just 1 blood, wouldn't mischief maker just swap the two bloods?
---
i didn’t even get the “you left your last ranked game” message. Also, my stars seem to be where they were beforehand
---
I think his major problem is that the death knight cards weren’t universally good. In fact, depending on your deck, some of them were horrible. So you’re playing a severely understatted minion for a payoff that might be a dead card.
---
so the part of and more refers to the adventure where you can earn more packs?
---
Don’t forget that pretty sweet card back
---
But isn't it inconsistent？
---
Malygos and Elise can be both in your hand and  Dreampetal Florist may hit Elise.

There isn't a game in existence without some level of bugs.
---
Since Zephrys is AI, and this is an AI bug, let's compare AI to AI, shall we.  Here's a pro brood war match from 2007 (9 years after Starcraft came out in 1998, so plenty of time to patch):
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaycLeeq9lE
---
Yeah, the bullet that is being fired out of the Reaver goes in all sorts of nonsense directions, sometimes blows up on nothing, sometimes starts moving away from the target it's trying to reach, in one case bounces all over the screen.
---
(Granted, Starcraft fans got used to shit AI, and the esports watching crowd loved the chaos, but comparing apples to apples Zephrys is much more ambitious, and much more accurate than the kind of AI Blizzard made in 1998).
---
Laughs in the amount of times I've watched these mages get doubled Overflowed.
---
And ranked. More people like to play seriously than just pros.
---
it will, but you can buy that at the "lower price" when it's released.  the only thing you're getting extra if you buy this preorder is the 1 guaranteed legendary and the card back.
---
Other people than pros play this game.
---
Haven’t checked it out, but is it the same copy paste adventure we had the last 3-4 times?
---
*Noooo dickhead, this one causes your hero power to change when you kill certain minions.  Clearly different...*
---
Fact remains, you can play around your opponents deck to give yourself a better chance of winning then your opponent plays their get out of jail free card. But thanks for your stupid comment.
---
That's the point. u/jamesspornaccount meant that Zephyrus had no way to save this fucking mess anyway.
---
It doesn't work. I tried it as soon as I opened the quest and just retried it to make sure. Even when I was at 15 health and had Amara heal me back up to 40 it didn't count for a single tick of healing for Obelisk. 
---
It should work based on the card text saying "restore" and Amara kills you if you have Auchenai Soulpriest. But it just doesn't work.
---
Oh my God, I have just realized, that for a 15 EUR, I can buy GTA5 on Humble Bundle... and Blizz is selling a really small amount of an extra content for the same  price. I guess, that a non-bundle price will be a 15 EUR.
---
Ayy I just finished the same thing today too, congrats!
---
She counts for healing with Auchenai, but she does not work with the second quest. I just tested it again to make sure.
---
That was rage inducing and i wasn't even in your shoes.
---
GRRRRUUUUULLLLLLLLLL
---
No, she just sets your health, she won't help you complete the quest.
---
I wish I were surprised that, barely a week after nerfs, people are already bitching about a deck that was too bad to play pre-nerf as if it is and always was the most overpowered thing ever.
---
Highlander mage still better, but i think Quest druid pack  a lot of fun.
---
100% agreed
---
That is why I am so sorry.
---
&gt; I know this is kinda over reaction but when I see resurrect priest in wild I feel like I should uninstall the game.

Do it.

I wish that roping multiple times and in a row would reduce the duration of other turns
---
Well, is it your Win condition or a supplement?
---
that well played is legal grounds for murder,
---
check with blizzard, they will give you your opponents home address and a murder weapon.
---
9 mana 13/16 is never a bad play
---
I really doubt they will give 16 packs for $20 on top of the adventure giving 16 packs by itself.
---
Because you don't have to purchase this at all if you don't want to. If you only care about the cards, this is obviously a bad deal.
---
This "reprieve" you're talking about had its own drawbacks. I take 3 expansions a year any day on account of the fact that it consistently provides a higher standard of fresh gameplay than adventures tend to.
---
Are 3 expansions more expensive? Sure.
---
But I personally think it's worth more on account of having a better impact on the meta each release.
---
Whether it's value enough is debatable. As it stands, Hearthstone is obviously one of the most expensive video games you can play on. But as a card game? Pretty damn good.

i also got fucked by a double box in arena, both times clearing my board

Actually, turning a blind eye on anti-consumer practices is *exactly* the way you have to go.
---
The whole "vote with your wallets" thing. If everybody turned a blind eye, didn't give a shit, and didn't buy it, boom. Anti-consumer practices led to anti-profit outcomes.
---
The problem goes two ways: people taking the bait of anti-consumer practices, and companies who are encouraged and enabled to commit to them.
---
If we were talking about the sales of bread I'd be with you. But we're not. This is Hearthstone, a video game that is already reputedly very expensive, no matter what point of time you've looked at it. So don't buy into what you don't perceive to be value for money.
---
But it is Zidinrys
---
If you get enough animations going you can skip your opponent's turn. I think the infinite shudderwock combo in wild is the easiest way to do this
---
B...Buttt the Gandhi i knew nuke like a mad man
---
SaddestSmile#2106 EU
---
If you pressure them it'll slow down
---
When you use a card, the card appears on the left to show the effect and such, and be better to read I guess? anyway, you can click it to end the animation faster, its not perfect since some cards have some loooong ass animations but its better then waiting an hour.
---
Gotta play the odds and play it safe
---
The "16 packs and more" has my interest. Suggests that you're likely to still be getting additional packs for clearing each wing of the thing? This is Blizzard so maybe a pack a wing? Bringing the total to at least 21 packs for the price if they stick to five wings.
---
That's absolute horseshit. Rexxar wasnt even run in aggro decks, in that meta the "aggro" decks were really midrange decks for which something like rexxar is perfectly appropriate. And even then it wasnt that big a deal, as it was slow as fuck, all it did was fuck over control decks that wanted to do nothing until fatigue - like a midrange deck *should*.
---
And yogg wasnt remotly that strong either. All it usually did was clear the board. Kinda like a far less controlled or reliable zephyrs now. "50% chance to win" is complete nonsense. People just threw a hissy fit after a few rare highrolls in tournaments decided like 1/100th of the games played...
---
or just not have animations take your opponent's timer away. the fact that something like Reno into Bittertide Hydra can skip your opponent's turn, because the animation takes so long, is fucking stupid of course. but I don't know if people realize that EVERY animation does this to an extent, just not on such an extreme level. if your opponent plays a card and immediately ends turn, while that card's animation plays, it takes up at least a few seconds of your turn where you can't do anything. as long as turn timers work this way, there's always going to end up being ways that a significant chunk of your turn can be eaten up by animations.
---
It’s not a pretty picture. I don’t like doing it!
---
150 packs is not enough to get or to craft ALL epics and legendaries. Also average quest reward is NOT 75, it's [around](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/80p5mm/simulation_the_postnewyear_new_average_gold_per/) 55-65. Definitely not 75. So you are getting less then 150 packs. 
---
ps. And of course we ignore arena, its a major time sink and you have to be really good. And I find it boring.
---
temporarily I've fixed it, but I'm not sure how.
---
After checking/unchecking full screen a lot, I moved the window to the left (because it would not sit to the left and always let a bit of light through), then I made it narrower, then maximised and it seems to have stuck.
---
But I'm sure I'll be back to where I was next time.
---
generally speaking deaths don't resolve mid-spell, e.g. deathrattle minions don't spawn (some exceptions like Defile which basically casts itself multiple times)
---
your disguise has a very punchable face I guess

And what result do you expect? If anything this makes me want an unnerfed yogg even more.

You can change the email it's attached to no?
---
Have you read my reply at all? I was asking about the preorder advantage over the final adventure price. I've never talked about packs or everything else. 
---
Considering the info we have so far the 16 packs are rewards from the adventure that you'll be able to buy anyways without the preorder at a lower price. Now, what is that lower price? 15€? if so this preorder basically is selling you a legendary and a card back for 5€ and that is not convenient at all.
---
I just opened this in a pack... and would very much return it for another random legendary.
---
Nobody includes e.g. \[\[Bull Dozer\]\], after all, so I don't see the incentive.

Dang, I read your title that it would include the full adventure and 16 packs, that would have convinced me to buy this immediately. But it is actually "**earn** 16 packs", as for: by playing the adventure, and I'd expect that I can do this as F2P with gold, too. So 20 for four wings (2800 gold), a card back and a random legendary - no thanks.
---
Exactly. Hearthstone has many problems that are directly correlated on the way the game is structured. When kripp talked about the giant + twinspell dup combo, he said how the problem doesn't really relies on how much mana It costs, it relies on the fact that the interaction is broken by itself (play something for cheaper, dup it and get two things of the original cost). But blizzard just went for the Mana cost change. This interaction is the same case, and it presented itself also with nozdormu and shudderwock in many ways. And still, instead of changing how the game is structured to avoid future problems, what did they do? They changed how nozdormu works and sped up shudderwock. This problems will never cease to appear until they are addressed as general problem instead of specific cards problems
---
 we've established you can't lead a civil discussion and rely on personal attacks, insults and made-up accusations.
---
Fifa
---
You have a lifesteal minion dont you? You do.
---
had this exact choice before at 3 life as well. this seems like a pretty minimal AI change to have it not give cards that will clearly lethal you.
---
From the sound of it the reward will be the 16 packs mentioned in the bundle, notice it says "earn 16 packs" which means you're not just getting the packs when you buy the bundle but will have to earn them with each wing.
---
I wonder what it is about "Zephrys" and "Rogue" that makes people misspell them. Like, okay, Alexstrasza, that's not an easy one (hell, I have to check it every time), though it does have an abbreviation. But Zephrys? And, uh, Rogue?

Oof that's a big rip cos it'd bad awesome if they did work simultaneously I'll research about this

---
Obviously there are more, are you dumb? I didnt say "there are three". I said there are "like 3" simply to state that the amount is very small and the system is really basic.
---
The ONLY thing you're getting special out of this bundle is the legendary and the card back.  The text mentions you will "**earn** 16 packs and more" which means that the packs themselves should be coming standard with the lower priced adventure as wing rewards on top of whatever else they likely have hidden as the "and more".
---
Going out with Hellfire is strictly better than concede button. Zephrys knows.
---
Zili has over 50% play rate i beleive siamat is strong to zeph is cool but those decks are more expensive
---
&gt; are you dumb 
---
I am actually smart and educated. I think people who ask "are you dumb" for no apparent reason are in fact, may be dumb. 
---
&gt; like 3 
---
I am not a native English speaker, but saying "like 3" means for me a number around 3. A number of 12 is definitely not around 3.
---
A realy slow start is what they pay i think you just have a bad matchup
---
&gt;I think it was magic or something who disallowed stats from being collected on winrate on a large scale. 
---
Wizards of the Coast strong-armed the content-creators that were attempting to collect data by threatening to cut off their official support. Driving traffic to the site with preview cards and sponsored events were worth more than some aggregated statistics.
---
Banning collecting statistics isn't really something you can just do. Its either sue HSReplay and hope they can't afford to fight a case a judge would probably toss out immediately or start banning players found to be sending statistics for violating the ToS. Either is a PR disaster waiting to happpen.
---
yep, legend should give you more rewards. But Blizz is stupid, says it will  incentivize grind.
---
rank 5. It's 500 dust.
---
The best explanation I have for quest paladin is that at some point during the development process the devs swapped the paladin and priest quests because the latter was op, this makes sense if you consider the cards available, the ones they released on this set and the class identities.
---
Just a FYI. Classic and Basic cards only. Time Out! Isn't part of those sets.

You on the other hand might wanna get your shit together and stop this farse. The amount is irrelevant. This is all about the "hidden quest" or "achievement" system being terrible since the early days of hearthstone. Its a shame they didnt push it more.
---
Literally just a worse Counterfeit if it's not generated
---
Why not Highlander Druid and Quest Mage?
---
&gt; Now with moving a lot of those legendary slots to class legendary cards per set, people complain the prize increased because there are less autoinclude cards.(let's not forget we only have 2/3 more legendaries per set than before, not 9 as many people say. GvG has 20 while SOU has 23 for example) 
---
Yeah, the problem is that they increased the number of legendaries but didn't also increase their drop rate. It was a hidden price increase.
---
zeppuku
---
Zboulderfist ogre
---
&gt;You used to get a lot of playable cards in a full set for that amount of money. Now you get very few in a partial set for the same money.
---
You used to get *nothing* because there wasn't anything that filled this role prior to Dungeon Run. That's my whole point. You're comparing these two things because they're solo content called "adventures" but the two offer completely different content that plays a completely different role in the game.
---
If you skipped old adventures, you were severely limiting yourself in regards to the main game. If you skipped Dalaran Heist, you didn't limit yourself at all. That's because it's side content. It *is* a significant distinction because of how accessing it affects (or doesn't affect) your experience with the main game.
---
That’s when you know they’re a sociopath.
---
nigger kike faggot
---
Can CW after boomnerf still outvalue it? That's good news ofc. But very unexpected. They got craploads of removal for sure so guess they can contain the onrush from t5 and handle it.
---
I used to play nothing but jank homenrew decks that were on the greedy side but ever since Whizbang came out thats all I play now.
---
Well shadowflame guarantees at least 3 damage, if you target Zeppeli.
---
Zapdos will die to hellfire anyway, so in this situation it seems that shadowflame is just better in every way.
---
Makes sense and its quite unfortunate. I personally like to add people either to ask about decklists or have potential quest buddies.  But more often than not you're right, most of the time there are a lot of trolls and etc online.    Unfortunate, but it is what it is.

Comfortably. The removal in that deck is ludicrous. I've started running nomi solely for warrior match ups. Win rate against them has gone way up since.
---
An unbelievable rip off compared to what we used to get in adventures.

Don't remember that at all eh6y tf are you making shit up?

yes, i have played for solid 2 years on my phone.

ah okay, now I see it

I've seen better, but only because I usually play her in fatigue with Nomi and Floop. 
---
Highlander is too weak imo. I've tried a few variants, but they all don't produce the results of a pure quest deck.
---
Oops, shame on me.
---
Hunter quest is better than priest quest, what...?
---
Unfortunately only 7 Damage * 2 = 14 Heal (I was at 2 life when I cast Storm Bringer)

Given those played rates might be nice to somehow tweak the Mage, Hunter, and Warrior quests.

I got paladin quest as free quest, was about to dust it but I held on to it, paid off , I use quest paladin and it my favorite deck

Mother of highrolls... I was going to ask about the poison giver guy, then I realized that this is the brawl
---
\&gt;16 packs
---
Uh unless they're not giving away the 1st wing for free anymore this is a lie, you'd be buying 13 worth, as you'll be getting 3 packs from the 1st wing.
---
try to buy the explorer bundle you got a few more hours before expires. It should give you a lot of new cards to play.
---
Why mage quest is weak?
---
Part of the problem with these stats is that the OP is posting data from All Ranks. This means that archetypes that are easy to build and play are skewed to higher winrates than those that may present more of a deckbuilding and piloting challenge.
---
Since there are many more players at lower ranks than higher ranks, the data skews towards the expected winrates for less experienced players.
---
“I give up.”
---
i'd say that the nozdormu very complicated otk is cheating, since it resets your time to everytime you play him
---
What other decks qualify as one trick pony?
---
I feel it's balanced and not too dangerous to be honest. A lot of cards are insane when they get the right setup and opponent, that does not make them broken. Aggro with early pressure does a fine job of keeping it down.
---
SALUTATIONS STRING POOPERS
---
Specifically, unlike other combo decks, it lacks the inevitably of "I draw my whole deck then go off". It can *only* go off if it draws the pieces *in order*
---
The fact the generated Zilli and Zephy are swamped irks me more than it should.
---
Yeah that part all makes sense, I just don't understand the bit about how you used to be able to use gold.
---
OMG, I've never seen someone use "bated breath" correctly.
---
A zombie is defined as a revived corpse.
---
A mummy is a corpse that has been preserved, especially by embalming. A revived corpse, which has been preserved - by mummification, as is observed - is both a mummy and a zombie.
---
Nozdormu's her dad so that makes sense
---
Playing against Quest Pally is so weird because you can easily crush them but if they get a taunted egg up you do not win that game lol
---
There are currently two different versions of Zoolock with &gt;50% winrates.
---
Personally I think they're overkill. Nomi is usually enough of a failsafe. I only put in Elise when too many warriors are ruining my day.
---
Control Warlock is a bit of a mess right now but Zoo is doing pretty okay...
---
Thank you Zephyrs, very cool!
---
well i think i cant send them anymore as anytime i send a request win or lose i'm ghosted
---
oh well...
---
Think if there were more cheap weapons like nozths first mate, it would be pretty good.
---
AFAIK, Wild wasn't a thing when OniK released.
---
How am I whining?
---
I think the point is that a (pretty vast) majority of cards obtained through LOE were the equivalent of pack filler or niche substitutions if you didn't own a card, but the ones that were played widely were very meta defining which is why people have a rose-tinted view of the adventures. You're guaranteed value, yes, but only because of a handful of cards.
---
The professor in this scenario presumably has a rule against it. You are breaking the rule to gain an advantage.
---
What's your definition of cheating that doesn't include that?
---
Also I use a deck tracker and don't think it's cheating the analogy is weak.
---
Uldum packs...
---
Got a list? I figure I should try it before I gone it into dust.
---
Not talking about the literal core experience that defines the content and provides hours of entertainment? 
---
Sure buddy. Thats how you'll convince us.
---
There’s no goddam y in Zephirs.
---
Not just that, but it's just cheaper to buy packs for the rewards
---
Blizzard has a secret black market where you can buy luck.
---
Good point, I missed that initially. Turns out the deal is only just barely better than the last solo adventure purchase
---
And it's freaking easy to get to 5 in wild. Standard is a grind...
---
I'm having a blast with Hunter quest. Surprised to see it's in such a low % of class decks comparatively.
---
"Your opponent left"
---
Oh for sure.
---
Honestly, I'm happy that adventures are gone in a way. Sure, every card for 2800-3500 gold was nice, but there were a few bad parts, like:
---
-No class legendaries
---
-Too many neutral cards
---
-not enough cards per set
---
Adventures didn't work because they couldn't shake up the meta enough without adding absurd cards like LoE did. 2 class cards from an expansion meant your decks weren't going to change unless you got cards on the power level of tunnel trogg.
---
Some people don't think netdecking is fun.
---
One time I was playing against a Warlock who burned Lord Jaraxxus (Eredar Lord of the Burning Legion!!)... I added him out of pity and we played a proper game.
---
I lost the rematch but it was a good laugh lol
---
yea, its definitely better then the last expansion, as here you get 16 packs + a legendary for 20$ or the gold equivalent. So its better then buying packs.
---
Even putting aside which is more or less fun than the other, getting 45 brand new cards including some very good ones still in use today is objectively a metric fuckton better than 16 packs. Even if for nothing else than the fact there is 0 new reward, just more packs of an expansion that has already been out for a month.
---
thanks :)
---
still more interesting than - i played 10k hours and made finally legend, no friends to share with so i do it here because of million hs players in the world the sub cares for me so much hitting it to the front page -
---
But you just kept hacking minions onto the board when you were just playing spells.
---
From my experience, no, using formulas that are provided obviously isn't cheating, but not every formula that would be useful is necessarily provided, and "hiding" pretty much any writing during an exam is usually considered grounds for cheating.
---
warlock quest in wild is actually kind of fun
---
not that competitive of course, but fun, esp after I added Feugen and Stalagg in place of morrigan lol
---
It's honestly my kinda card! Dirty rat is probably my favorite card since pre-nerf Illidan. But I freaking love this guy, it's good more times than it's not. You never play it against big paladin and you just gotta be careful against rogues who might be sitting with a a wrapped golem or colossus of the moon clogging their hand. Other than that, I can't really recall not being at least fine with the result.
---
Did you beat him?  CLEARLY cheating!
---
I feel like we had this convo before. It's an empathy thing, some people just don't want to do deal with extra negativity. It mostly comes from expectations of a match. There is a reason why some many love the autosqulesh feature .
---
Honestly I've gotten good value out of cult master but I think you are right and it is the fact that Hunter was never design to have draw. This is also why I think the 3 mech was included. You can basically nickel and diming the draws.
---
I also don't think boommaster was is like a must to finish the quest and also it is meant as a post quest finish spike. There were enough games I won without ever drawing him.
---
I think the biggest challenge in this deck is to understand how to keep your hand size decent while working your way in quest completion at the same time not dieing. But I find most of the tools there in the deck in surprising way.
---
Alright, we're on the same page then.
---
So would you say that 65% does not match the definition of the word "most"?
---
This is the best argument when people ask "WhAtS tHe PoInT oF bUyInG a NeW aDvEnTuRe?"
---
Its definitely me. Do you have a guide or something that you use? The only reason I was upset is because I spent that much dust on a low tier deck when I could have crafted something much better (faster to lower ranks) for half the cost. I ended last season at rank 7, so I started this season at 13.
---
Unearthed Raptor comes to mind.
---
&gt; One was basically essential to playing the main game. The other is not.
---
You're kind of making the opposite point than you intended. Being essential to the game means it had good rewards. Being irrelevant shouldn't come at the same price tag.
---
You're going to spend *something* on this game whether it's time or money. 2800 gold for 45 cards guaranteeing 0 duplicates and full playsets is massively, massively better than just getting 28 random packs. If you're not capable of saving up 2800 gold in 4 months, this really isn't the game for you.
---
Can i see your deck please?
---
Or attached magnetically to a good number of your minions, or buffed by Armordillo.
---
But Wild Ranked doesnt matter. Reasons why Blizzard will never make a Wild Tournament. Wild will always be this way, and Yogg isn’t even the most disgusting nonsense in Wild, so let him be unnerfed and he’ll probably see play in a few decks.
---
But I'm loving the expansion so far
---
Please keep in mind that being mad on reddit doesn't equal to not spending money on the game. I prefered the old way (even if it had its flaws), yet I still preorder expansions.
---
He's referencing this post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cz30xo/got\_this\_from\_a\_brawl\_opponent\_blocked\_me\_after/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cz30xo/got_this_from_a_brawl_opponent_blocked_me_after/)
---
People become more and more disillusioned with the state of the game and take it out on the community.
---
*there are
---
At this point, Rogue is pretty much mostly represented on Wild ladder in the form of Odd Rogue since that is a top Tier 1 deck whereas Kingsbane Rogue is around Tier 3. Playable, but unclear what advantages it has as a deck over Odd Rogue.
---
Pre Leeching Poison nerf, I really enjoyed playing Kingsbane with  an anti-control deck (as well as a fun little deck to play in Single Player Adventures), but because it's impervious to weapon removal, it's really annoying to play against. It has the same degree of inevitability as playing against Jade Druid.
---
it would actually be a good thing for tournament mode. clock management is a reasonable skill, and magic shows the chess clock system works. if anything, it's better for tournament play, because good players will save up time for complicated turns, and then there'd be less roping out at critical points in the game
---
Always keeping Mage down, ugh
---
I got Siamat too!
---
They could have just changed how many of any given card type (neutral/class cards/legendarys) includibg the total ampunt instead  of removing the entire model for the greedy as fuck one we have now
---
Yeah, it was called water rogue. It was a fun variant that is pretty commonly used as a good example of why a meta is never 100% solved.
---
That’s because warrior as a class right now is extremely efficient at maintaining board control through the first 5-6 turns. It slows down after that until it ramps back up again on turn 10. You can play almost any archetype and  beat a lot of the meta decks. 
---
1 mana - 1/3 that gives armor and is mech or a 1/2 that draws a rush minion.
---
2 mana - flunky or hero power.
---
3 mana - snip snap or another 1 drop that is a mech or that draws a card
---
4 - mana either the 2/5 rush +3 attack this turn or the 3/2 rush reborn.
---
5 - Dynomatic or ziliax 
---
Warrior is so strong against Aggro  so the only decks that reliably beat them are greedier decks or mid range decks that curve out perfectly with over the top damage to finish them off.
---
If at any point they fall behind they can clear the board or reduce minions down to 1. So yeah, a quest center warrior will feel strong because the class as a whole has some of the strongest and most efficient ways of maintaining board control.
---
Which explains how it saw 0 play afaik in TGT... When a deck was literally built around paladins playing 5 secrets on turn 6.
---
Druid quest is fine. They can just avoid printing Choose One cards that are too powerful, and voilà. Shaman quest on the other hand... it's no secret battlecry is the strongest keyword in HS, and one of the most popular. It's going to limit design space significantly on that front until the next rotation. They will have to be really careful with the entire Lackey mechanic as well, or it could get out of hand really fast.
---
It’s certainly the first I’ve heard that making a fun deck playable is bad game design.
---
Foul Elemental should be a battlecry, yes?
---
I mean I enjoy Civ 6 a lot more than Civ 5 so for me it's absolutely the better deal.
---
If someone liked Dalaran Heist and wants more of that style of gameplay but with a new flavor, then it's a good buy for them
---
There's also no reason to buy the Iceborne DLC for MH World when you could just play the base game over again
---
Oh man.
---
I think a lot of why kingsbane is tier 3 is because a lot of people dusted kingsbane after the nerf and probably had odd rogue mostly built. Both are pretty serviceable for the grind cause they provide quick decks. 
---
I think kingsbane is a more fun deck than odd rogue, plus depending on your build you can win faster than odd as well.
---
Because people largely read by looking at the first and last letters of a word+word length. 1 letter switches are hard to find unless you're actively looking for them.
---
In Zephrys case, Zephyr is a word and Zephry isn't, so it's even worse. Rogue vs Rouge is also not helped by the fact that Rouge is an easy way to typo Rogue while being a real word.
---
I absolutely agree. There are all kinds of “unfair” cards, but none that are as unfair as playing Nozdormu against a handicapped player is.
---
Same! Although i play a little of the other classes, my rogue collection is still the best and my rogue wins is more than double my second highest class (druid). And the best part is, ever since i started in KaC, Rogue always had a tier 1-2 deck so i always have somerhing to play
---
I believe a lot of what people hated is losing the PvE aspect. Now, PvE is still there.
---
Otherwise, I'm not saying adventures didn't have their upsides. I'm saying that adventures weren't inherently better or worse than what we have now (although I do dislike the fact that F2P players *had* to spend 2800 gold to get specific cards, but that's fairly marginal).
---
I do love a good meme deck
---
Zayle was utter shit.
---
Deathwing was corrupted by the Old Gods.
---
Is this the controversial Big Priest everyone was talking about?
---
I could add "coming soon" next time, this was a post with infos early available (that I just updated with new informations). The release date was already confirmed before (it even was a top post on this subreddit), so I wasn't thinking anyone believed the Solo Adventure is playable right away.
---
But now it is, not the adventure but the bundle, like the title says.
---
I'd rather have the rando legendary, honestly. Zayle is a curse in my card collection.
---
The card back is only for pre-order my dude. Says so on the youtube video description.
---
Even without the adventure, it's better value than preorder or (up to date) bundles. Hearthstone has crazy low return on money invested, but it's the best deal we got, possibly ever.
---
Explorers you didn’t have to buy packs though, the whole set was 20$. They complaining about the loss of adventures and how they switch to an all booster pack system, as opposed to 2 expansions and 1 adventure each year.
---
So the 16 packs aren't all Saviours of Uldum?
---
There's no free wing also?
---
tfw someone wants to DUST reno
---
The sad part is that 15$ is worth 16 packs, period
---
I opened a Golden one.  No surprise here that it's the lowest.  It's legitimately terrible.
---
Unlikely to occur in the wild meta now, only aggro kingsbane is good.
---
What deck u playing?
---
He is the chief agent of the Old Gods
---
There's only one deck to play him in, but that deck is and should remain good. Up to you.
---
There seem to be mention of "intro missions" on prepurchase page.
---
Honestly I'm okay with the new name. Dr. Boob is coming to destroy you with his bonhonkalahoogs
---
Thanks.
---
One of those 16 is a golden Classic pack, which has decent dust value. If you pre-order you also get a random Legendary.
---
That all said, it's $20 USD, not $15.
---
Gatekeeping much?
---
3500 or 2800 if the first wing is free.
---
I got golden Colossus in my pre-order bundle. I mourn with you.
---
2 years
---
15 dollars for 16 packs is already a good deal. Add in a free adventure, regardless of how shitty you think it is, and the deal is even better
---
You are 100% right and I’m a dumb ass! xD
---
The proper term is exploiting bugs.
---
There was a bug for example where using [[Tracking]] while [[Acolyte of Pain]] &amp; [[Wild Pyromancer]] were both on your board would essentially perma-freeze the game for your opponent and give you a free win. Blizzard ended up banning some accounts that used that exploit when they rushed out a hotfix for it (when decks designed specifically to exploit that bug started to infest the ranked ladder).
---
Exploiting bugs is against the TOS &amp; EULA.
---
**League of Explorers:** Costs $20 and you get cards that became meta defining and necessary to any competitive collection
---
**Saviors of Uldum:** Costs 0$, 2 free legendaries if you get 10 packs or more with saved up gold.
---
The second is way better for people who don't spend anything, like myself. Honestly fuck Adventures.
---
I played one last week at rank 4 and it destroyed me.
---
Good point. Chapters 1 and 2 have the same release date so I'd bet 1 is free making the whole thing 2800 gold.
---
Just play casual then friend request the first person you play against, there’s a high likelyhood that they will accept your request and play another game.

One hex is 4 mana so that is worth 12 mana
---
The quest doesn't really synergies with mountain giants, cause either your not playing the quest T1 or your not playing a giant on T4.
---
I play the quest with a shufflelock deck that uses the RoS rush puppy generators and I'm having a blast.
---
Last game I had 8 cards left in my deck, so I Eleck (0 mana), 4 mana portal dude, 6 mana portal dude then Rafaam (also 0 mana) for bunch of legendaries in hand and 20 in my deck.
---
I lost, but it was a hell of a ride!
---
Flesh out LOL!  Try Slay the Spire its the exact same price.  THAT is fleshed out solo content.  I think your standards are really low.
---
&gt; Then why compare them as if they are by placing two completely different things side by side and implying one is better than the other?
---
To focus the discussion on the number of cards/packs
---
&gt; But OP left out the main thing you get with new adventures, the actual gameplay.
---
Subjective as I mentioned in another comment. No matter how much you don't want to believe it, the main content is subjective to each person and not everyone buys/plays the content for the content itself. 
---
&gt; You proceeded to do the same thing. This is what I meant about turning off your brain. You stopped at the word adventure and didn't even realize you had completely neglected the main content.
---
Again, nobody is neglecting the "main content." You have your brained turned off the point where you don't want to listen to anyone, and just want to talk down to everyone like you're the smartest person in the room. You didn't even read the bit you quoted
---
&gt; To compare the dollar value of each in terms of what cards you get.
---
You didn't read a damn word of that b/c you don't want an answer to your question b/c that would require you to turn your brain on. 
---
Let me dumb this WAY down for you using a different example to where even a turned off brain such as yours can understand b/c clearly this is extremely difficult for you:
---
You want to buy a car. The number 1 thing you care about is gas milage. You drive a lot and a car that can get good gas milage is important to keep the cost for driving low. 
---
You go to a dealership, look around, and see a few cars that interest you. A salesman shows up and curates you around to a few other cars. Each that have a MUCH worse gas milage than the ones you were looking at before. 
---
The salesman uses your brainless logic and says "The main content here is the quality of the materials used in the interior and all the cool features. Gas milage isn't the main content here."
---
You respond "That's good and all, but I need a car with good gas milage b/c I drive a lot."
---
The salesman pumps out his chest "You just read 'car' and turned your brain off. You can't look at the gas milage for the price of the car b/c you're leaving out all of the features."
---
You again respond "I'm not interested in the car if it doesn't get good gas milage"
---
The salesman retorts "You're missing out the main thing when you get the car, the actual features. You proceed to do the same thing and it's what I meant about turning off your brain. You stopped at the word 'car' and didn't even realize you had completely neglected all these features!"
---
Finally you say "I care about the gas milage. That's what I'm interested in first, and it's what I want to consider as a priority when I purchase the car. Not the features. The gas milage. So I'm looking at the price per vehicle and seeing how much gas milage I get for the price."
---
As the salesman scoffs "You are so stupid. Turn on your brain."
---
I'm talking about what's being displayed in the game app panel, the actual game. There was a rough ad with zero info.
---
I had to come here to get details and read comments to understand more. 
---
Thanks for the infos here. I just hope that I won't fall for this scam like I did last time. I feel like a pig that's being molested by purposefully misleading marketing promoting supra low effort content for peasants like I used to be.
---
Yikes, I'm happy I can take a step back now from my denials in puke with pride.
---
That's the new player tutorial I think as it also requires you to have unlocked all 9 classes
---
Your enemy's greatest strength is also their greatest weakness. - some chinese proverb probably
---
Boulderfist ogre: Who are you?
---
Armored goon: Im u but better...
---
Shut the fuck up Donnie
---
I mean you got swamped by a big board while you were running a deck with little to no aoe.
---
You were sort of asking for it.
---
Most people didn't actually think the quest was weak, they were just annoyed at how terribly designed it is. Because the only way to complete the quest is to play Reborn minions, and literally all of the Reborn minions printed (or that likely will ever *be* printed) are in this one specific set, that makes deckbuilding around the quest *very* linear and leaves essentially no real room for experimentation. I'm mostly a Wild player, and the quest is simply never going to be good in Wild because I don't want to gum up my deck with sub-par Reborn minions when I could be doing any of the other billion strong things in the format.
---
To be perfectly honest, I'm *still* pissed at the design of the quest. It's a cool reward, but more than any other quest the way you finish it is so linear and boring, and is unlikely to ever receive more support in the future.
---
On mobile...I'm surprised you can even log in. Even the actual website is messed up, so luck of the draw I guess. But I'll try to verify whenever it gets fixed, nice informative post.
---
Do we know what the gold cost will be yet?
---
Though, I would say that $15 is not worth 15 Uldum packs, now.  It would be worth 15 packs of the December expansion, because I haven't opened 60 of those yet.
---
I miss having an adventure vs another expansion
---
If you pay the $20 you can save your gold from then to get more packs for free in the next expansion
---
I don’t know why people don’t get that
---
But is it really worth the price tag for these incremental improvements? No offense but for 20$ on steam you can get a lot more than just a rehashed game mode.
---
Just play casually until rotation, or get out your credit card
---
Mech Hunter is one of the strongest Hunter decks rn. According to hsreplay Mech Hunter with 6700 Dust sits at a comfortable 57% winrate. Same for Murloc Shaman with ~4000 Dust, also at 57% Winrate.
---
So please check the stats before you call decks "Rank 25 jank".
---
This shitpost is clearly not to give blizzard feedback, let's at least be honest with that. This is a meme just for people to get salty on the comments. I can ignore it for sure, but then the only thing I get is more shitposting for a game I like on the subreddit for the game. So clearly I am not supporting blizzard, but rather pointing out how outrageously wrong this low effort content is. So please keep supporting it.
---
Cause little ol' salty boyz - unlike blizzard - definitely need your support.
---
Yeah, that's awful. With that many cards and that much set-up, you can just OTK them with Shirvallah or Uther DK with about half the set-up and far lighter deck-building restrictions.
---
There used to be a deck where the win con was nozdormu plus a bunch of oppressively long animations as the win con (joust, curse of rafaam, etc...).  It was really cancerous when it worked.
---
You criticized my reading because you didn't realize I was responding directly to your most recent comment and instead assumed I was responding to an earlier comment I had already responded to?
---
And still ignored how your comparison to a completely different game in no way applied to my argument?
---
I had litterally just crafted this deck to try it out and this was my 2nd game using it, the palli before did the card which swaps a spell with a minion cost so turn 3 he got a full board of 6-9 cost minions, off the top of my head what aoe could of even stopped this?
---
I'm pretty sure anything under 60% WR is jank.
---
I agree with you. The game is more annoying than fun.
---
Seriously though is there anything I can do? My free quest was shaman and I crafted priest’s (because it’s fun) but both my decks are trash because I don’t have any of the good cards from any sets, not even the basic set
---
I am not a fan of choice. It introduces so many paradoxes. But its necessary in many areas.
---
what else
---
Yes, 3.  You get 12 SoU + 1 classic Golden for the other chapters.
---
Maybe rafaam is the plague Lord, and they keep the surprise for the finale.
---
$15 for 16 packs and the adventure is probably better than paying an extra $5 for a cardback + legendary.
---
Barely true
---
Just make sure you always buy the newest set that’s out. They will stay in play longer but they rotate out yearly. Keep up on your daily quests and it’s not hard to f2p
---
It feels bad that they lowered the cash price of the adventure but it still costs 2800 gold, for objectively less rewards than last time (Zayle, as shitty and useless as it was, was still something more than we get this time).
---
&gt;I’ve heard a lot of discussions saying the best way to get dust is to just buy boosters.
---
Well, I mean. *Obviously*.
---
I think salad48 covered everything else ^
---
As a Paladin?
---
Wild Pyromancer into Equality.
---
Mage can Frost Nova into Doomsayer, or Blizzard.
---
Warrior has Warpath or Brawl.
---
Shaman could scheme.
---
Warlock can Hellfire.
---
There are aoes to deal with this shit.
---
Is it that hard to screenshot?Damn
---
Um .. people do make decks with them? Brann, Reno, and Finley all go in decks today. That's a pretty awful counterargument.
---
The point of new content, especially paid content, is new cards you can use to make new and interesting decks. This is literally paying for something that used to be free. Even looking at it as 16 packs for $15 is still a loss because we're a month into the expansion.  I wanted those 16 packs a month ago. I wouldn't just outright buy 16 packs today for $15, or $10, or even $5. Anything I wanted to make I've already crafted.
---
While I agree with you, the paladin quest is quite uninspired, the majority of people on this sub were saying it was garbage. It’s def not garbage in standard but it is boring to play
---
So is it better if I get Saviors of Uldum packs or Basic Packs? I’m missing like 70%+ of cards from both
---
yes haha
---
and yet I pay the same amount of gold and get the same amount of packs but nothing as a replacement for Zayle...
---
I have; it's literally a coinflip, unless you're playing the version with Rafaam which turns into more of a diceroll than a coinflip.  Sure you can highroll into a win or two from a bad situation, but odds are you get literal jank that you can't work with and get overrun the turn you play (or the turn after) Rafaam.  Fast decks aren't fast enough anymore, and they have nothing to take them into mid-late game (read: past turn 5).
---
Also getting legend with only 55% winrate?  I'd think you would need 60-70% Winrate to get even up to rank 5 in general.
---
Get 10 packs of every set first because you get a guaranteed legendary. Then you can play Knights of The Frozen Throne for a free Death Knight legendary which you can dust if you don’t play wild. Also there are a couple of one time quests that you can google up (some of them give 300 gold and such)
---
Apple owners gotta show it's apple

Funny story, a few years ago a guy added me after I beat him with some standard beast Hunter deck and accused me of cheating by playing three copies of [[Houndmaster]] which I clearly didn’t do. I thought it was funny until two days later when he didn’t stop hounding me with comments like “So who in your family works for Blizzard and gave you cheat codes” with 18 threats to report me to Blizzard before I finally deleted him. Wish I’d kept the screen shots.

Something went in and never came out...
---
Also, bran left the tomb
---
At least originally, Elise picks cards randomly until she's either filled your hand or copied everything.
---
I believe there was a Blizzard comment on Reddit a while back that said the copying is going to be leftmost first once the next major patch comes out.
---
I'm guessing the next major patch will be either when the preorder for the adventure hits the store, or when the adventure is released.
---
No thanks lol
---
Litteraly unplayable. No immediate board impact.
---
Nice
---
What is ToT?
---
I think aggro(and similar no counterplay) mechanics are unfun and shouldn’t exist in a game like Hearthstone that has such minimal board control in many classes, and they havent kept it to a minimum
---
The loss of those adventures was the biggest hit against F2P players in the history of the game. And the outrage wasn't even that big.
---
Yeah. I hope there’s enough content in this to justify almost the same price for basically having less than half the stuff in Dalaran Heist available*.
---
*based entirely on class availability. Hence me saying that other content could balance this out.
---
Don’t emote or anything unless you “Well played” a mistake they made. Roping back until they quit and then giving them the same respect ends the roping for me usually. Or just win a 40 minute game and they will walk away the tilted one.
---
For what it’s worth in top 1000 legend people usually always accept and are genuinely very nice. I think I’ve had the most positive experience chatting with players in hearthstone than any in other online game.
---
good river crocolisk
---
No free golden card this time like Zayle, Shadow Cloak?
---
&gt;Fun cannot be in and of itself the only reason you play a game.
---
Maybe that's how you think, but a ton of people play games just for fun. 
---
If the fun you get from playing tombs isn't worth $20 to you, then you aren't the target market! Which is fine. Not everything is for everyone
---
What dumb laptop do they have now that apparently has the logo on the keyboard?
---
Time is money though
---
Kibler makes a good point.  Though I see both sides, that could get really expensive really quick.  Why not two full expacs per year with two or three full adventures? (ala league/night in karazhan).  Hell, Why not keep the current schedule and make the adventures full on adventures that award multiple legendaries and class cards like they used to?
---
ToT? Well maybe the new adventure?
---
This is my problem as well.
---
It's fine if other people see value in it, but for me, I really don't need anymore Uldum packs.
---
And going the gold route is just as much a waste, because if it is 700 gold per wing, I am now paying double for the packs. Both outcomes are just a waste for me.
---
And considering what you are getting, a reskin of dungeon run... It's a pass for me. not even a hard decision to make.
---
All you really do is swap out the 2 waggle picks and the thing that let's you draw 2 pirate and combo with it a weapon. You add something like a shadow step to either speed up the quest via blink foxes and henchclan burglar or Leeroy when you have lethal.
---
He once talked to a guy who had met someone who was related to a guy who had an uncle who worked at blizzard 10 years ago.
---
Hearthstone became too expensive too keep up. So I quit. It has been maybe a month since I quit. I have played this game since closed beta. Playing everyday and doing your dailies is not enough anymore.
---
&gt;I don't like that they reduced the amount of free PvE they're giving out when that was the caveat to increasing the cost of the game by eliminating adventures in the past.
---
Right, I'm being willfully ignorant yet you believe *that*?
---
And again, the free wing of Dalaran Heist alone had comparable content to some of the older ones in their entirety. They don't *owe* us anything. You don't have to like it, but the false comparisons people are making won't change anything.
---
So $20/2800 gold for 12 uldum packs, a golden legendary pack, and if you order now a legendary
---
Also 4 more dungeon runs... 
---
Not sure if it's worth the expense. Especially with how unsatisfying it was with rise of shadows having to wait a month for all the packs
---
Tombs of Terror
---
*it stops the emotes or it gets the rope again*
---
Dude, do you even read or write only? Read the first sentence in my reply. And then please answer
---
It's like those 'funny' memes that draw a red circle around the obvious.
---
&gt; anyone who's been playing the game for longer than 2 years knows that there used to be an alternative that was clearly better
---
No there wasn't. There was nothing in the past that filled the role the solo content we've been getting since K&amp;C has. The old adventures were an alternative to expansions, not solo content.
---
Same thing for Reno.
---
These are honestly just sad
---
Wow- anduin. (You new here?)
---
I just run quest paladin, and named my deck “fuck warrior”.
---
(Sadly quest paladin struggles with aggro warrior, so the name isn’t always true).
---
I get that. But if you own all the legendaries do you get a duplicate one, or do they give you a golden copy?
---
Quest Druid is middle of tier 2. What’s the issue?
---
Token druid I feel is under represented atm due to the popularity of quest druid but yeah mostly this. If you want a good midrange deck brann hunter is a good one.
---
There were not that many cards where Brann shined. Brann into Drake could work and it was great with Healbot. He was nowhere as universal as Loatheb, maybe Thalnos is a better comparison.
---
Do we know whether "after release" is "after the release of wing 1" or "after the release of wing 5"?
---
Do you play Tess and Academic Espionage?
---
All the popular lists I see have cut those cards, but those are the most fun cards in the deck!
---
SMOrc my IQ is low SMOrc my deck’s really wack SMOrc i press button SMOrc get +2 attack SMOrc
---
I started later and don't complete all my quests and can build multiple meta decks every expansion. Perhaps the problem is with how you manage your resources.
---
I get fucked by warriors all the time so
---
you didnt even try to make it look remotely real
---
Nexal#2159 on EU willing to trade, can go first.
---
This is correct, since the first chapter is free the finale is unlocked after completing the others.
---
Yeah I can understand that.
---
The real take away is the people rather 100% of a small mass of content then 20% of a large mass of content. This is ground zero of HS pricing issue through out it's life.
---
Neither. OP is making a false equivalency comparing the main content of one thing to the side content of another. You pretty much *had* to invest gold or cash into old adventures if you wanted to have viable decks. You don't have to invest in these new adventures at all to have viable decks. It's just a fun, completely optional, side mode.
---
You don't have to be a blizzard employee or rich to call out OP's BS or to be fine with the new adventures.
---
It's not.
---
Blizzard's (Activision) business practice has lowered your expectation over the years. The game hasn't gotten any more expensive to develop, the content is shit and rehashed every expansion, and the meta is the same bullshit rock paper scissors it's been for the past 3 years.
---
This game is quickly losing its player and streamer base.
---
It’s really worse for the game. Free to play players don’t get meta defining cards, restricting the amount of people who can enjoy the game to its fullest extent. With less competition, the game becomes less challenging. More packs is a much better deal gameplay wise
---
TunaF15#1275 NA 80g you first
---
I got both Warrior and Warlock. The Warrior one isn't bad, it could fit in an aggro shell and might see play once Boom and all the mechs rotate. The Warlock one is hot garbage, though.
---
Actually, i don't give up, cause I'm slightly drunk with nothing better to do. Now, please explain thoroughly, that how exactly could an answer that says "definitely not, my bad" to your question about the deal, can be interpreted as "yes", and therefore deemed questionable. Please, do tell because I'm really at a loss here.
---
And after you have, and got no more space to dodge anymore , i insist that you answer in detail my question about arbitrarily assigning values.
---
Or else i will be inclined to think that you're a windbag.
---
Nice!
---
Very cool art!
---
At 5 you very rarely see fun decks, it's almost always top tier meta decks cus most people are pushing for rank 1. As for the skill, it feels like very little skill is involved in most of those games and ends up being a rock, paper, scissors as to who has the favorable matchup.
---
And budget hunter was what first season of the game lol. The goal is always spend money. If you don’t like it don’t play.
---
They need to fix the 1st vs 2nd winrate problem in arena first.
---
First person i've seen apart from me who uses RotW. Actually an insane card with all the new cards hunters got
---
well they went with the route that made them by far more money
---
in the end its all about money, everything else doesnt matter
---
Even then, that deck still has enough good match ups to win a decent amount of games.
---
I think it's boring, but it's not the worst.
---
Yeah, Boom just destroys quest warrior.
---
Rank 15 is five ranks higher than rank  20. But it's also five ranks lower than rank 10.
---
Rank 5 has meme and tier 3 decks too. Once u hit 4 stars or rank 4 it's all tryhard
---
Definiting?
---
Not my taunt deck, noo!
---
This, I got a Paladin as a free quest on my main and a golden Paladin quest on my alt and was going to dust both of them but after playing/watching some quest paladin it is seriously fun. Don't regret my decision to keep both of them
---
Sounds like LOE was a money grab.
---
That's not true, rank 5 is where people play meme decks. There is no point to pushing for rank 1 or legend if you already have a cardback
---
That's pretty good actually
---
Waiting for the trollden video where someone swaps the top card and gets their opponents kingsbane.
---
DrStrangelov#1969 on NA to trade 80g quest. Play yours first. Online next few hours until complete
---
Dungeon still running
---
What I do is go face man, works great
---
Play wide board then savage roar.
---
Welp, first adventure I won’t buy. Really tired of the dungeon run like content. Peace!
---
4 20 blaze it
---
Completely agree, there is just so much synergy with almost all beast cards, I particularly love playing a dire frenzied timber wolf with a discounted tundra rhino, trading into my opponents taunts and watching their reaction when I play a 2 mana spell that ends the game. It is also insane with Deathstalker Rexxar. Played a lot of games where my opponent conceded after me reviving two powerful zombeasts. It just gives hunter so much more board presence and forces the opponent to continually play around it if they know it's in your deck.
---
Yoi get the 16 packs for beating the solo adventure. Buy it, it's a good deal
---
Gee I wonder why they rotated Old Murk Eye
---
You get a legendary and a card back for spending an extra $5
---
Yeah, in wild, its even better! I use it with the plague of locusts to help pop the wuest and then hero power. A lot of value in the card
---
Lack of innovation
---
Yeah well my dad owns Blizzard.
---
I don't understand people like this who add you after a game and then are just rude or idiotic. It's not like their life depended on HS. Just move on to the next game.
---
Yeah thats the joke, I dont own shirvallah, but if I let hs autofill me an empty paladin Deck, he still tries to build me the Deck. Which Makes no Sense obviously
---
Good friend eh. Noob. I have an uncle
---
This game is a joke now
---
The issue is that people have different play styles and you can apply a similar argument of being helpless to every archetype. 
---
“I don’t like control since all they ever do is remove your board constantly. I literally can’t do anything to push damage since it’s always removed. And then they just draw their win condition eventually and it’s just a shitty, drawn out match where I had no chance.”
---
“I don’t like aggro, no matter how many times you clear everything they keep pushing face. It’s a fucking mindless deck and you never get to stabilize since they always kill you before that point.”
---
Yeah well my uncle owns the internet. Say bye to Reddit. You think you can post here? Think again, degenerate!
---
All I've played since Uldum launched is 4 different versions of Battlecry Shaman. I'm still 2 legendaries off of making Highlander Hunter and 1 Legendary off of Highlander Mage so even a month later,  Battlecry Shaman is the only fun deck I've got.
---
The higher your rank the more people will play around your stuff, and there will be fewer  misplays
---
Inb4 opponent plays Millhouse manastorm as a pharosis tech.
---
Fifa gameplay  has been the same since 94 and i don't see them complaining.
---
No, more, my Rogue deck for example was a kingsbane/c'thun deck. Block my c'thun buildup and kingsbane ramps, block my kingsbane ramp and my c'thun shoots up
---
Literally Unplayable.
---
done
