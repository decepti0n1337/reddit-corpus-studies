Unnerffing is also buffing
---
---
---
- there's 5 dragons in the Hunter Highlander, including the new class ones. You don't necessarily have to have a ton of dragon synergy with them since they're all good by themselves which is what Highlander decks are all about- consistency. 
---

---
- Elise is not in Druid Highlander because there's a lot of expensive minions and you wouldnt get too much value from her. Because there are 3 ramp cards, I focused less on early minions like Scalerider and more on swingy mid and late game minions. 
---
- Evasive feywing isn't as bad as you think, especially because it's a good 4 drop to follow your curve of 3 drop dragon synergy cards, and is really good when buffed. Firetree witch doctor is overrated IMO because with the full amount of cards in a rotation "random" effects of cards have a high chance of giving garbage. 
---
-Shield of Galakrond is more defensive which is good in this rogue deck so we can stall to get value from the Waxadreds. 
---
- I admit I overlooked Sea Giant in Galakrond Zoolock and think that is a pretty good inclusion
---
Before calling something unoptimized perhaps ask why certain choices are made the way they are.  However, I appreciate any and all criticism as long as it is constructive. Hopefully this answered many of your doubts!
---
Such RAW power.

Wait what

Because Thijs invented it back in the 1840s?

While they look like amphibians, murlocs have gills and are indeed fish. They are amphibious but amphibious fish are not unheard of (look up mudskippers)
---
Grizzled wizards hero power exchange would have expired by the next turn so you can‚Äôt use 8 dmg?
---
I have your update, they aren't doing jack shit. blizzard does not care about their players, they care profit. they are way to lazy to do anything for such a small group of people. They will wait and let you suffer.
---
No because undoing a Nerf requires them admitting that the Nerf was not the correct solution. By calling a buff 6 months later they can just stay they're addressing game balance
---
I have never claimed it wasn't good. It is just not nearly as powerful as you seem to think it is. At its best it facilitaded tier one decks, which is a sign of a very good card. But compared ot cards such as Barnes, Mechwarper, Snip Snap, or pre-nerf patches, it is quite tame.
---
It is a card that for the most part wins you games you are ahead, if the opponent is either reliant on a board in order to interact or is unable to remove it, so you can use him to burn them down. Being a win more card, makes it easy to overvalue it.
---
I agree their model is somewhat predatory. But I also think many players dust and recraft cards which makes the cost for playing a lot higher. You would be surprised how fast your collection can grow if you have a good arena game and only dust duplicates.
---
the fact that they leave a gamebreaking bug for so long just proves how little they care.
---
For a little bit of context, the left image is of [[Zephyrs the Great]] being played. The right image is of a rare board interaction on the Rise of Shadows gameboard. These two lamps are identical.

Tasty fins death rattle  points to it being food for dragons, not people
---
Me and my freind got to a few million-something. it autokills the minion after a certain stat is reached. then we both stopped playing the game after learning the hard way how horrible blizzard treats it's players
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Gotta love the empathy here.
---
Good job dude.
---
You probably tied for 4th.  If you tie for 4th, then you get averaged with 5th.  So basically, you finished in 4.5th place which means you'll get either a small minus or a small plus depending on the overall lobby mmr.
---
You have a good point, but you can definitely refine this more and it‚Äôs in warlock so it‚Äôs never terrible
---
That would be true if Blizzard did not print any combo card. Patron Warrior is harder than any combo deck nowadays.
---
Who else read this as him killing himself?
---
Charge cards by themselves are fine. The problem is that charge interacts with other cards in really toxic ways.  If Charge as a mechanic didn't exist, it would open up a lot of design space that is currently locked away behind the existence of a 1 Mana charge minion.
---
‚ù§
---
Without the danger of being punished by an infinite sound the bells combo, Millhouse may finally be meta.
---
Freeze mage was the only example, because it was a super slow combo that relied on stalling.
---
Modern combo decks will get to their combo before the warrior gets much armor, and well before DMH warrior does anything at all.
---
Of course reducing the "item price" if you will on its own reduced profits... but generally as a cost goes down people with lower economic resources are able to participate in the market for that item at a reduced price. This is econ 101 and not to detract from the point you are making because it is an important one, you can't forget that economics is not such a linear study to correlate the reduction in price of an item with a decrease in revenue. 
---
I think that online card games where cards can't be traded are a lot less tied to the concept of "collection" especially when wild exists.
---
We also may simply have different philosophies in what we enjoy about the game which if true I readily accept. I play Overwatch a lot when I can, even though I don't care about cosmetics and only care about gameplay. I also don't care about rank- what I care about is enjoying myself. The thing I do care about is winning, which I will admit is related to a grind, but in a very abstract sense if you're winning to think of it in a certain way. 
---
I'll say that if I had the whole hearthstone collection I'd play it more than any other game as I would have the resources to create infinite decks in standard or wild and I could enjoy whatever I wanted to make. I love solving problems and balancing meta-fun matrix is a wonderful problem to have witch is only fully allowed with a full collection.
---
Wait, what happens if you grizzled veteran twice with spirit of the shark or shaman quest? Do they keep your hero power the next turn? Or does it swap it back twice the following turn?
---
&gt; This is why I usually ignore Hearthstone friend requests. 
---
This is why I usually *accept* Hearthstone friend requests. Watching some poor bastard fume over a children‚Äôs card game always makes my day.
---
&gt;y. They'd have to recoup their losses from somewhere else if whales could get the same amount of cards they used to for the cost of a pre-order. If they didn't convert free players, they'd never make up the loss. And with the current balance of the F2P economy, they more than likely wouldn't entice nearly enough to make the transition.
---
Remember that if more people buy the product, then lower price can still be good for company. Even if its not explicitly, I can imagine players boycotting in the future to ''artificially'' lower profits and create incentives for lower prices.
---
The deck should be called ‚Äúfight fire with fire‚Äù

no this is a known bug from several patches back that they still haven't fixed
---
Especially if you can afk more often lol
---
I think the biggest difference is the investment requiered for both. If rng screws you over in BG, you just roll the die again. But in constructed where you spent a ton of time/money to build your deck, it feels pretty bad.
---
i don‚Äôt think it works now
---
How is it otk
---
You get 9 mana on turn 1?
---
Don‚Äôt worry i left my arena run at 0-2 a month ago, this meta is unbearable.
---
Really missed the writing on the old show
---
What
---
I dont know much, but I think he was a paladin alongside Uther, but was wounded or something by the Lich king, so when Arthas died Bolvar took the helmet to become the new Lich King so that he could control the scourge instead of letting them run rampant without a leader, then froze himself. Hence the "there must always be a Lich King" and his play line in Hearthsone being "with this last act of sacrifice.
---
New Day 1 meta confirmed, Expired Merchant Galakrond OTK.
---
Exactly. Also, when you realize you‚Äôve lost a game of constructed, you‚Äôre still compelled to play it all out for several more turns, at least until the opponent CLEARLY has lethal. The matchups are polarizing.
---
On the other hand, there are so many comeback mechanics with BG, that when you realize you‚Äôve lost, your game is done and you can already move on to the next game.
---
It makes BG *feel* better to play. It‚Äôs simply more fun and respects your time more. I‚Äôm hyped for the new expansion, but man, I just don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôll actually play versus BG...
---
fr, 8 health is literally unplayable
---
ya know you're being downvoted but i'm not sure that's fair - the, 'small indie company,' meme is pretty played out nowadays and hasn't really fit the company for quite some years now.  i'm not shocked if someone doesn't get it/know the meme.

Unlike Jaraxxus: you need to have executus die, your hero power is random, you don‚Äôt get armor.

I didn't know Bloodsail Corsair was part of the standard pirate package. I also noticed the lack of a mention of Dread Corsair when referencing this pirate package. Interesting.
---
That didn't happen though. I had minions on the board both times.
---
on turn 2 you give them life tap, at end of your opponents turn, majordomo dies and opponent gets die insect! replacing the life tap that you gave to them, when it becomes your turn again, you gain the die insect! permanently. and your opponent is now 8 health max + whatever hero power they had prior to combo.
---
Rewards for a totally different game mode.
---
New heros and hero powers for the adventure I think are more appropriate. Personally I would like to be able to collect cards from bosses and fill out an adventure exclusive collection. 
---
And theyre not as shit to play because you draft your deck as you go. Literally 90% of the fun comes after the boss dies. Actually fighting the bosses is resident sleeper and always has been.
---
agree to disagree
---
I think it is because, whereas Reckless+Snip Snap was 2 cards, our current one was 3, so perhaps they thought it wasn't a big problem
---
I've played about 25 games and only been offered Edwin once and Rafaam and Sylvanas not once.  Keep getting offer Wagtoggle/Rag/Lich King type choices.üôÑ

thank you!

i need to fix the filter with obs on the mic im using, too much noise reduction, but im glad you enjoyed
---
lol this card art is literally the god chronos from smite.
---
Yikes
---
Rewards for constructed are less about making adventures more rewarding and more about creating a paywall to enjoy constructed.
---
Tea keep him very young
---
bro wtf that shit made me spit out my water... goddamnit
---
First one or two years I didn't pay anything to blizzard. I have started paying for the expansions, from the first E.V.I.L. expansion, but only for the single player.
---
I have never felt the need to actually buy card packs, because you can make a descent deck with very little, and you can fairly easy grind dust for that one card you need, or something.
---
It's the best F2P game I have ever played, cause I really didn't need to pay anything, to have fun! And with the new game mode battlegrounds, it's even more fun (and free)
---
I will recommend the solo adventures though, very well made
---
The combo would also have been available in Standard where decks are vastly weaker and less able to clear an early board of 20+ attack minions or to rush down a combo deck in the first few turns.
---
I know, but I'm just saying this might be why they delayed
---
ok
---
I'm missing my N'zoth, Yogg Saron and many other cards. These were cards I owned. I don't know what happened
---
It‚Äôs all coming together
---
Your luck and mine are twins
---
Zephys has a set list of things to look at such as player hand size, board state, opponents hand size, etc. 
---
He isn't coded to see lethal by hero power because the card doesn't consider opponent hero powers. Sure, maybe this should have been a factor for him to consider, but expecting zephyrs to see the literal perfect card is a bit unreasonable. 
---
I completely agree that being at 1hp should influence his picks, but you have to consider how the card is programmed I  order to get the best effects from him.
---
Thanks for your thoughts!
---
I agree in that there is quite a bit of variance in the effects, which I'd hoped were balanced due to the fact they were symmetric. These were just some ideas, and could probably use some refinements. (Note that the rats generated by Infested can create triples, so it does more than just 5 gold.)
---
I don't think this would be behind a paywall (more likely, you need to win X games), but if it were, the players without Anomaly Mode wouldn't really be at a disadvantage. Anomaly Mode is like the Casual format of Battlegrounds; you can't play against non-Anomaly players with Anomaly Mode, nor can you face Anomaly Mode players without Anomaly Mode. Furthermore, the games don't count towards your rank.
---
Thicc
---
Golden Rivendare + the 2nd deathrattle guy gives most of his board +16/16. Golden rivendare does some crazy things. It's not the strongest yet but it's stronger than it lets on.
---
Yes

Priest Galaktond seems to crash the game for your opponent.
---
Thanks for posting your decks! The problem I have you with your Dragon Highlander Mage deck is the same issue I see with a lot of other people, there is just too few dragons initially (you have only 6 before discoveries, and 8 is really the minimum threshold). I haven't had time to go through your video to hear your thought process on the deck unfortunately :(
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
[This](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/dragon-highlander-mage-7/) is the Dragon Highlander Mage I created, although its not perfect by any means. I'm still not quite sure about a couple of different aspects of the deck, and I really won't know until testing, such as how many dragons make Frizz Kindleroost worth using, and how cards like Cobalt Spellkin feel in a Mage deck.  I feel like Big Ol Whelp is almost mandatory in dragon based decks, and the high roll of mountain giant + conj is still way too good to drop. That is also the issue I have with your cyclone mage deck. 
---
[Here](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/elemental-cyclone-mage-2/) is my versions of cyclone mage. The real issue I had when making this deck was that I really wanted to put Frost Nova in the deck but could not work out what to remove. I'm still a little concerned that this deck wont be able to survive long enough against aggro.  Mana Giant is insane is this deck, and was one of the reasons I decided that banana buffoon might still be worth using.  As mentioned previously, mountain giant + conj is still way too good to drop so I ensured that I kept it.
---
Done, Pleasant experience, would recommend to a friend :D
---
very addictive and frustrating. thread with caution. able to play being F2P but will be tempted to spend. will be enticed by artworks and fancy cards and cardgame plays, but after will feel buyer's remorse and sunk cost feels. fun maybe 10% of the time.

Even with preorders? And saved-up gold? How can dis be?

---
Alright m8. You're clearly just an ass whole. Your first response to everything is to be a dick. Nice man. Pls don't bother responding. Ain't nobody want to talk to an ass like u
---
No dragon rogue? With Galakrond, I assume that it will be somewhat consistent to get a good number of draconic lackeys. Then you just need Waxadred, big ol' whelp and some other stuff. Extra SI:7 agents are nice.
---
Most people can tolerate certain level of rng. Nobody who says they hate rng means it quite literally, or else you would be playing chess or something. Now battlegrounds seems random as fuck, but positioning, adapting to your recruit pool (a huge part of bg that most people don't think about and forces archetypes) , and making assumptions about your opponent before you face them all matters.
---
I firmly believe bg is more strategic than constructed hearthstone, even among all the seemingly rng involved in the game mode.
---
Not to forget about the legendary you can craft to test out 2 new decks per class (randomly chosen) each expansion. These decks are usually not as good but go for a new core theme of the expansion and you can have great fun with this for just 1600 dust
---
had to rage-quit instead. So much more Hearthstone-like üòÇ
---
I think the best counter argument to this would be that despite all the RNG rolls, you have enough options (positioning, buying/selling, short term vs long term strategy, evaluating opponents, changing comp etc.) during a BG game to ***consistently place top 2***. You can't do that in Monopoly. It's not Monopoly. But, it's not Chess either. And that doesn't mean it's bad.
---
Same
---
sounds weird but if it's no big hassle play a friendly game in tavern brawl. play it out until one of you reaches 0 health. that's how i completed that quest back then. was a big surprise. read that it worked for others too back then.
---
You clearly don't see the weaknesses of said quests. Since you mention one that I actually use, i.e. Druid's Quest, it is actually fairly easy to outpace in the early game with an aggro deck. Besides, the Quest deck also relies on getting the cheap cards early on to profit from mana or it will just have to hero power and pass.
---
I think that instead of ranting about something, you could be looking for ways to understand counter plays. Additionally having everything predictable, implied by your desire to remove 'luck', will make the game boring with nothing to spice it up.
---
On the idea of secrets, they are not 'luck' either, because there is a fixed set of secrets that can be run and you can take into consideration what the enemy could be playing to best counter you or to protect themselves from your attacks.
---
Bottom line, it takes some practice and patience which might serve you well in life as well ;)
---
there are no funny webcomics
---
Not the other guy but I guess it could work with Galakrond. Very unreliable tho.
---
Did you find your glasses?
---
This poor innocent soul... if u try to hunt murlocs for food... well i hope at least u got some garlic with u so at least u taste better
---
9 years for one shitty throwaway gag is 45 times its normal recommended lifespan
---
That's lucky for sure.
---
I got what you got in 106 packs minus the Golden legendary. You definitely got lucky
---
And to echo what the VS guys said, Shaman Galakrond is basically all in the battlecry since the actual Hero Power is kinda weak in the late game. So it would probably be fine to use the quest to double it's battle cry for 4 8/8s with rush. After that you can also use Shudder to do it again for the 2 8/8s and if at that point you haven't won then it's unlikely you'll win at all.

The fire emotes to the left only shows up at the start of your turn the coin could be from last turn as my phone shows the last turns left over coins for a second or two when I first start my turn on mobile
---
rank 5 is not a grinding rank lol, especially not in wild, but yes, there have always been bots at rank 5 in wild, they used tobe murloc paladins in the year of ungoro, and before that, they were pirate warrior.
---
Multiple are posting their in game problems in this thread. A lot say they have the game crash because of Galakrond and at least one's even saying Anduin caused it.
---
Zeph is run in non Highlander because his effect is insane and can win games on his own, also the decks that use it can draw so fast that the cost-benefit of adding him actually pays off.
---
Now regarding the crusader, what‚Äôs 5 random paladin cards going to do for you besides adding little extra value? Random paladin cards (considering how bad they have been on  the last few expansions) are going to be below average most of the time, also it‚Äôs a dead draw until you can make it work, neutrals are a HUGE factor in a deck, read the vicious syndicate report and go to the paladin section, they explain it better.
---
I always liked CW but can get too boring at times if the matches are long, I like either Highlanders or Control, I was trying Mage but too many Shaman and Rogue that don't let me get to late, with Paladin went far better tbh
---
I'm confused on how the devs overlooked this.

I can understand that this will come off as snobbish, but I'll instruct you to go back, read what I said. I was really clear. If anything was unfounded or ambiguous I catapulted for that. Again, make sure you read whole comment. Treat claims as what they are not what you want them to be. Be aware that I am making pretty specific arguments. Those arguments are not necessarily what you want them to be and if you respond to arguments you think I'm making or claims you think I'm making but haven't actually been made then you are straw manning or failing to address points at all.

1. Sometimes the best way to counter something isn't to react to it.

   1. You counter Explosive Trap by trading first then attacking the hero or attacking with a weak board
---
You can't match with the same person twice in a row, otherwise it's random. So it seems to be working as intended.
---
Maybe. They could have a battle cry effect maybe too ? ‚ÄòUpgrade a random minion in your hand‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not sure how it would be implemented but I think with some thought it could be done really well.
---
Megasaur to give all murlocs poisonous is a bit too much. Toxfin is enough to give murloc the poisonous archetype.
---
They tend to close Arena a few hours before the expansion drops so I wouldn't start one any later than Monday.
---
I've been playing almost the same time as you but never reached legend. I live up to my name. As well I did come from FPS background I didn't play many card games growing up. I do somewhat make it to rank 6 or 7 but that's it. The reason why I don't rank high is that I still make stupid mistakes. Congrats on reaching legend.
---
Yea, I completed mine without even entering arena.
---
And I enjoy the aspect of changing a card or two as I climb the ladder, seeing what works and what doesn't.
---
Refreshing again and again for a good minion from Bob feels more frustrating to me.
---
No hate to BG, I think they made the closest thing to Autochess they could with Hearthstone's mechanics, I just prefer Arena and Constructed.
---
Invoke and C‚Äôthun buffs work very differently. If you don‚Äôt currently have a Galakrond in your hand, deck, or in play, Invoke does nothing. This shouldn‚Äôt be any different.
---
Almost
---
It‚Äôs also the nature of the constructed ranking system.
---
When I‚Äôm at legend rank, a bad beat doesn‚Äôt bother me too much because all I lose is ranking, which is functionally similar to Battlegrounds rating.
---
But when I‚Äôm not legend? It usually means I‚Äôm trying to get to rank 5 for the monthly rewards, and every loss means I have to win *that* many more games (especially if I breaks a win streak). To compound the problem is I would love to experiment and play new decks but until I‚Äôm at that rank 5 floor I‚Äôm basically locked in playing some cancer meta deck. So now I‚Äôm not only hating the deck I‚Äôm playing, but the other guy probably hates me for playing that deck, *and* every loss just feels like I‚Äôve wasted a bunch of time.
---
The real problem with hearthstone constructed is the Star system. The whole thing should be thrown out, given a pure ranking/rating system like at Legend, and monthly rewards being determined by something else, like for example, get 20 wins in a month, play 50 games, complete 25 daily quests, or something.

Can't get em before the expansion goes live

Which could still be coded to hit stealth as well. There is no precedent. Actually there are big minions that attack everything/ on spawn which I believe attack stealthed minions

Dude u need to separate this. I see your problem now. Decide if u want to play competatively (3-legend) or have fun (25-3). U cant have both. How can u expect to play for fun and still reach the highest level of skill? There will be best decks ofc but lets assume baku just disappeared. Now something else is best. And then counter to that deck is best. You cant stop this. All you can do is play what you want, do your best and see where you can go with it. If you are good enough u can hit legend with anything. I. Am. Not. Good. Enough. Some. People. Are. So either git gut, complain, or simply enjoy what you are offered
---
I no longer feel confident doing anything other than clearing quests or playing solo modes on mobile after being burnt by shitty performance. The thought of playing control on my phone gives me the dry heaves. 
---
E: moto g5+ so not the newest heh.
---
Congrats, only one time I could persuade me to grind to legend, probably continue it only because I had such a crazy WR, I went 81-30 with HealZoo, I honestly dont know if I was lucky or just played well, everyone said that Druid was the Zookiller, but went 15-3 vs them.

He's all talk. He accused people of having a lack of imagination yet he's incapable of presenting his own arguments and has repeatedly demonstrated he doesn't understand how the game's F2P economy works.

Is the date correct? You can edit it, if not. By default the date is set to about 5 days out as that's how they recommend doing it.

Also, pretty sure the time zone it uses is PST. If you're in CST with me then they're 2 hours behind us, but otherwise you can try to Google ("your timezone to pst" without quotes).

Maybe for the first days, then it becomes a sweatfest.
---
I have barely seen any murlocs late game in my past 15 games yesterday
---
I actually figured out what I was missing. I had to click on the profile button down in the bottom left, hit the arrow next to my name, and then there was a button for fireside gatherings. I couldn't find anything that mentioned that or indicated how to activate it
---
Rat King is still decent, but I don't think he's even top 5 right now. I think at least Yogg and Derryl beat him quite easily. Personally, I'd also pick Shudderwock and van Cleef over him.
---
Pretty creative :)
---
For sure! Just find something that you love playing and you'll get there eventually! Just try to read the meta overall and what are the best decks that you love playing and are actually consistent. If I can make it you can too! :)
---
Thank you! I guess I was always too scared of higher ranks and always gave up at some point, but so happy of finally making it for the first time!
---
Hey MadMeow, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Didn‚Äôt feel any worse than Hare and then Evolve... zzzz glad that‚Äôs died.
---
Thank you! When I was in rank 1, the only deck that beat me with Warrior is my favourite Highlander Mage, that one hurt lol, at least the rest were aggro and although they were close could finally make it!
---
Gotcha.  Thank you for the explanation!
---
I mean i assume super aggro prolly beats it considering they are basically a mana behind for 4 turns or whatever. I don't think I have had issues beating them with super greedy vslue decks either since they have no early pressure.
---
If you want to grind for gold use the fastest deck possible and play in casual mode. Wild is very effective for that, use a mech deck (paladin or hunter) and if you're not winning in the first 5 rounds, concede.
---
Also some brawls a good for this, the actual brawl if you have the cards for one turn or 2 turn kill decks go for it.
---
But yeah, don't let the grind kill the fun. If you think this is boring, just stick to daily quests and play some fun decks.
---
heres my theory: gib moni plz
---
He's quite possibly one of the worst. Without the second health you still lose to the other heroes that have strong early game and his hero power is just negligent in late game
---
He's like the worst early game hero. But still better than lich king, queen tog, etc
---
100$ for 3 mins?
---
I want to work for 1% of that.
---
It's like getting a victory royale in fortnite while having played since season 4
---
&gt; Wtf do rewards on reddit even do?
---
Nothing.
---
&gt;is this guy using real life money for this?
---
Most likely. Could also have gotten shitton of awards themselves and now spreading around the gold you get from those.
---
I had to scrap that quest as well. It's the price for not touching the game for 2 months. Well worth not playing a single game vs evolve.
---
Whizbang in wild is probably about as strong as zayle in standard
---
Work for 5h nets you 50 packs. Grinding for 5h nets you 50 gold. The moment you stop playing for fun, but playing to grind for gold, you should just stop. Its such a waste of time.
---
You have to spend reddit coins to award a post. In this case, the 5 awards available on this sub cost 3000 coins in total. The best reddit coins deal is 40k coins for 100$. Even if they are only buying that, it still costs them 7.5$ to give all 5 awards to a post. 
---
All the awards do is give the awarded person some reddit coins and/or some duration of reddit premium. The cheapest one (the silver award) doesn't give them anything.
---
He would attack first as he had more minions.
---
I collect 70 gold every day ( quest+ 3/6 wins, now 60 is more common so I only need to play 3, I usually end up playing more tho but around 70 gold per day is a good estimate), I am at 100 packs right now and works for every expansion, doesn‚Äôt feel like a grind at all of you enjoy it of course
---
[https://imgur.com/a/wOsVo4g](https://imgur.com/a/wOsVo4g) mine too
---
I was actually wondering what the hell was going on with posts with 0 upvotes having shit ton of awards
---
He could be an amalgam... oh god
---
Yeah and no other hero is as strong as him and it's painfully obvious. He's a gallywix on steroids who wins most games he's in. His one weakness is putting something like a vulgar homunculus first and even then the investment was just 1 mana so it doesn't matter if you get that anyway.
---
I don't play battlegrounds that much but i have never gotten 3 heros to choose from. Did they change something?
---
Might want some shadow word:deaths and/or dragonmaw poachers, dragon decks are going to be very popular atleast during the early days of the expansion.
---
Kripp can‚Äôt play for shit.  Wut drugs u on?
---
I play barnes
---
Low effort post here. I liek cards. I  also once put a stone in my hearth.
---
It‚Äôs also Australian dollars, so subtract like 25%.  It‚Äôs closer to $45 US (which can still be a lot for some people, not saying it isn‚Äôt).  It‚Äôs also not really necessary to get a second 40 pack, so subtract another 10.  You can also get coin backs from Amazon, so subtract another 10% - making it around (and very approximately) $30 US a month.
---
Weird that the one expansion with a ton dragons in it doesn‚Äôt have any 10 mana minions since dragons can normally be that expensive.
---
I did the third right away, but it took months to get the motivation for the rest. It was just too much work for a pack
---
Darth Vader is a murloc now?
---
So basically I‚Äôm new to Hearthstone, just downloaded it today and I am honestly having a blast. I had mage unlocked and I added a few cards and it gave me an error, so I switched to Rogue, added a few cards and gave me an error. Then I switched to Shaman, added a few cards and didn‚Äôt give me an error.. I really like Rogue and wanna play it but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong..
---
He could be an amalgamation of awards actually.
---
Playing Whizbang means playing sub-par standard decks that can't compete at higher ranks. Trying to play those in Wild sounds not very promising
---
And then another one will take up the legacy of the 2nd award guy and so forth, for ever...?
---
What is this Brawliseum? First time for me
---
thank you! i really tried to make something entertaining in regards to opening packs, i was holding on to them while thinking of something to do, because i thought if i get anything cool out of nearly 50 packs i want to show it lol
---
yes... I value HS gold higher than money. üíÅ
---
Who cares about 4tj place.  If you‚Äôre not first, you‚Äôre last.
---
How long are you going to be doing this? Might join if you're still hosting in an hour or two.
---
So I‚Äôve kept track of the number of packs I‚Äôve opened for every set since TGT.  I also try to get enough packs until I have close to everything (obviously counting dust).  I actually think 250 is a fair estimate, if you buy the two preorders because it gives 2 legendaries.  
---
For SoU, I‚Äôve opened roughly 240 packs.  I need 14k dust to craft everything I‚Äôm missing, and I would get 10k dust if I disenchanted my extras.  So I would need about 4K more dust, putting the number just north of 250.
---
The no dupe legendary thing significantly lowered this amount from before, when I‚Äôd need an extra 100 packs.
---
Like top decking.
---
Arena style but using one of ur regular decks (play until 12 wins or 3 losses)
---
Award guy is apparently loaded
---
Invisible rogue-warrior
---
Seeing as I haven't really tried to finish quests and took ~1 month breaks this last expac, I'm pretty happy to have 1900 ready to drop
---
You can set up a Fireside Gathering and open packs before expansion if you want to.
---
I genuinely think they need to rework poisonous. It just makes stats and buffing irrelevant, especially with divine shield. How about making poisonous minions doing quadruple damage to enemy minions instead of instakill?
---
Not sure if you meant 11 - 15 or vice versa. Either way it‚Äôs pretty funny.
---
I really like running beasts as george, you can throw divine on your hyena and avoid taunts until late game
---
I was waiting for the "I have no time for games" line :D
---
Thank you, good luck to you as well!
---
yea i did, was kinda unlucky with the legendaries tho but got a lot of dust now.
---
**TL;DR:** Lightforged are crusaders who defend the innocent from the main universe, Lightbound are fanatics potentially indoctrinated into serving the Light under those with corrupt tenets. T'paartos before Yrel Blizz plz.
---
___
---
I'm not sure how much they'll continue to push Pure Paladin, but seeing as it will become notably weaker next expansion by nature of the card rotation (meaning Paladin will go from having the greatest amount cards it will have in a Standard rotation to the least amount of cards) I can see a Legendary Pure-Paladin addition being completely reasonable.
---
Yrel seems like the best choice, even if she is a Lightbound and not a Lightforged. And yes, there is a difference:
---
***The Lightbound:***
---
The Lightbound is the name of the collective of Light-fanatics on *Alternate Universe* Draenor following the defeat of the Burning Legion and death of Archimonde there. At the end of *Warlords of Draenor* (patch 6.3) when Grommash Hellscream, Yrel, and Khadgar banded together with the champions of Azeroth to defeat the left hand of the Burning Legion (the right hand being Kil'jaeden, who would fall in 7.2 and the head being Sargeras, who would be captured in 7.3), the Azerothians would return to their timeline which was based 35 years ahead of Alternate-Draenor's.
---
Some time later in patch 8.0.1 the Bronze Dragonflight would (inexplicably, because Battle for Azeroth is poorly written) assist the warmongering Horde in acquiring new allies. Eitrigg, an old-school veteran of the Old Horde and adviser of the New Horde, would assist an emissary of the Horde (hint: you) to venture back to Alternate Draenor... but things had changed.
---
While the Draenei and orcs had bought their own peace for a time following their *collaborative* defeat of the Burning Legion on their world, the Naaru, literal embodiments of the Holy Light, would begin to preach more and more extreme lessons to their devout followers. Yrel, a young Draenei who throughout the course of the Warlords of Draenor expansion had risen through the ranks and was given a literal symbol by (Alternate) Prophet Velen just prior to his death and became a central leader of her people, would also become the High Exarch of this Lightbound coalition.
---
By the time the emissary and Eitrigg had returned to Alternate Draenor, it was no longer 35 years in the past. Instead, it was the same present-day for them, with a much different history compared to what our Draenor looks like today (long story short: gone to shit because Ner'zhul blew it up by accident). The Naaru's teachings ran deep in an indoctrinated people. You may have noticed that I haven't referred specifically to the Lightbound as "Draenei," and that's because not all of them are.
---
Indeed, Alternate-Grommash Hellscream's own son (who is almost certainly not just another Garrosh Hellscream, since Garrosh's mother is dead in Alternate-Draenor and even high fantasy can't bullshit its way out of having an alternate-Garrosh Hellscream born of the same father but different mother) has been converted to join the Lightbound forces. And he is not the only one: orcs captured by the Lightbound, who appear to genuinely believe they are striving to save their erstwhile allies from heresy and corruption, will either become purified and join the forces of the Light, or die.
---
So you see, the Lightbound are almost a bit like the Tau of the Warhammer 40K universe. Not necessarily a single race, but embodied by a similar, pervasive doctrine that seems to, at least partially, overwrite and overrule its followers' own rational thinking.
---
Oh, and they pushed all of the non-Lightbound orcs off of Draenor by Battle for Azeroth, which is why they're now chilling on Azeroth.
---
***The Lightforged:***
---
The Lightforged are notably different. They are meant to be a part of the coalition of the universe's survivors of the Burning Legion who have been saved by the Light and are set against fighting the infinite demonic army for all eternity. It just so happens that a "coalition of the universe's survivors" includes nearly exclusively Draenei as far as any representation of the Army of the Light goes: including audiodramas, in-game, and novels (no offence Blizzard but Warcraft world-building is kinda lacking).
---
There are a few notable members of the Army of the Light, and hilariously enough none of them are Draenei:
---
1. High Exarch Turalyon, who underwent the ritual to become Lightforged after 40 years of service to the Army of the Light (hence why he rocks that silver hair), and had fought for them for around a thousand years before being reunited with Azeroth and his son, Arator the Redeemer.
---
2. Alleria Windrunner, lifemate of Turalyon and mother of Arator, former Ranger-Captain of Quel'Thalas and sister of Sylvanas Windrunner, is also deeply rooted into the cosmology of the Warcraft universe now that she has delved deep into the dark powers of the void. While she had learned to wield the Holy Light and even wreath her arrows in its power after only a couple of years, she parted from the Golden Army after approximately 500 years when she was forced to use shadow magic to save herself and Turalyon from their infiltration-mission on Argus, which had gone terribly wrong. Over the next 500 years she would seek out and even save the Locus-Walker, a powerful master of the Void who had seemingly resisted the shadow's whispers, and through his teachings would become more adept at wielding it *and* even save Turalyon's life from a powerful Man'ari eredar assassin known as Eradication.
---
3. Lothraxion, a member of the Army of the Light for thousands of years, after serving the Burning Legion for thousands himself. For anyone who doesn't know Lothraxion: he is actually a nathrezim, a dreadlord, just like Mal'Ganis or Tichondrius or Balnazzar. He had died multiple times in service to the Burning Legion but, as per his immortal demon soul, was always able to return to serve once again. Except... he once had a run-in with the Locus-Walker, who had pulled him *out* of the Twisting Nether in order to kill him (if a demon dies in the Twisting Nether, their 'home-realm', they die permanently), and had proclaimed that he had a destiny to fulfil. It would appear the Locus-Walker was correct, as Lothraxion would himself become suffused with the Light, possibly being Lightforged himself, and serve as a trusted commander of the Golden Army, even being a confidant of Alleria and Turalyon. He too would be saved by Alleria when she returned after her 500 year sojourn with new powers over the abyss. And unlike what you might expect from a loyal servant of the Light who has served for millennia, he, like Turalyon, had trust in Alleria even after her apparent fall to darkness. He's the ultimate bro.
---
With this said, there is the fanatical element of the Lightforged represented in two different ways. The first was Xe'ra, the Naaru Prime, who had led the Golden Army of the Light and who held an apparent fixation on a fulfilment of "Light's destiny." If you do not follow the path the Light had set out for you, you were an enemy, or at the very least unable to be trusted.
---
And in Battle for Azeroth, you find some Lightforged combatants that use some conventionally extremist language when beginning to fight the Horde. The basis of the Lightforged being extreme, however, is pretty bare. Xe'ra is dead, slain by Illidan Stormrage, and they are led by Turalyon, who tolerates and trusts Alleria Windrunner, who wields powers Xe'ra would regard as anathema to the Light. Lothraxion is the ultimate bro and hasn't made an appearance in Battle for Azeroth, and I'm not even sure any of the Lightforged Captains present themselves as particularly extremist, either.
---
Oh, plus they are in the same faction as literal Void Elves, so there's that.
---
In any case, it is clear that there are "purity" themes associated with both the Lightbound and the Lightforged. The difference is that the Lightforged seem to have generally altruistic and benevolent tenets, much like the humans' Church of the Holy Light, whereas the Lightbound seem to be more... possessed by the exultant need to spread their views and way of life to others. One is fundamentally rife with bigotry, and the other is a genuine defence of the innocent that may occasionally overstep its bounds at least a little.
---
This isn't to say at all that the Lightbound Yrel cannot fit into the "Lightforged Paladin" theme. I will, however, suggest that before we add Yrel, we add a much more candid and deserving character as a Pure Paladin Legendary.
---
My man, ***T'PAARTOS!***
---
Thank you!
---
Thank you! That's an awesome accomplishment, I hope I can do it too someday!
---
I know there is an app that changes your location so you can set it to an ongoing fireside address and just play the people over there. I know you can google it for all the details, it's how I got nemsey and open my packs early.
---
I think award guy is a blizzard developer that is working together with Reddit to keep the community in check so that future rants will be softened significantly.
---
He's also Chinese.
---
Thank you!!
---
they give you crap minions and you can make triples off the cards pretty easily and use that to generate higher tier minions. There really is nearly no downside. How this got released in its current state is beyond me, it‚Äôs like no one tested this out.
---
That's correct I've never purchased runs.
---
Right? It is not that the voice actress sounds bad. It just sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom that was large enough for a little echo...
---
Y
---
Obviously, the stats are doubled to 12/12 and +6/+6 on a Golden variation. The effect would trigger before any minions attack, if both players have them, whoever is attacking first would have theirs trigger first too (though with no other Start of Combat effects, yet, this is largely irrelevant).
---
The idea of the card is it's a tech choice like Zapp, powerful against certain boards whilst weak against others. Full board of Divine Shields? Great. No Divine Shields? Abysmal.
---
If the game is like a job when f2p, it's gonna feel like a job when paying as well.
---
Wont work, the game use it own date, the game cant pull back a mode that no longer exsists
---
If I'm just going for quests or tavern brawl and I see a priest I just concede. By the time I get in a new game and finish we would have been on about the 4th turn.
---
Whizbang the Woeful.

And how do I know that now that cards are removed?

Shaku was a card that came back temporarily for the doom in the tomb even (the one with N‚Äôzoth and Rag) and that rotates out a couple days ago. He‚Äôs been put back into the hall of fame I believe
---
No, because no money

So?
