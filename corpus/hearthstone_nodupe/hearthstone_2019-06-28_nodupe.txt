Added you

---
---
Yeah, that would be strictly better.
---
Still convinced it will be a Halls of Origination or a Mogu Vaults themed expac, seems fitting the LoE would go to those places.
---
My guess for the 3rd will somehow be involved with Rag (maybe kelthuzad, malganis, kazakus, lich king, jaraxxus, one of the old gods ((hopefully yogg but probably c'thun)) aswell) they will be the real evil villains of this expansion. Pipe dream but i totally think they will bring rag back for sure.. they have to at some point hes too iconic and a cash cow

I actually asked Mike Donais on his recent streams about time stuff, and he said the infrastructure isn't there to have Nozdormu mode or tavern brawl.
---
I have 4 wins in a row going first.
---
Lol, I dunno if you actively managed to to that, but huge congrats.
---
yes.
---
Why does r/hearthstonecirclejerk even exist at this point?
---
Interesting how everybody sees the Legendaries as belonging to different classes. If I had to guess, I would go:
---

---
Druid -- Elise (night elf + she "commands the plants in Un'Goro to assist her in fight")
---
Paladin -- Finley (Paladin used to have a Murloc theme, unlike any of the other classes)
---
Mage -- Reno (no duplicates was made more of a Mage/Priest/Warlock thing during Gadgetzan + Reno is featured on the Mage Spell "Forgotten Torch" much like Rafaam was on the Warlock's "Curse of Rafaam")
---
Hunter -- Brann
---
No problem! 
---
When struggling between picking ‚Äúto‚Äù and ‚Äútoo,‚Äù think about it this way; are you going somewhere or are you talking about a lot of stuff? 
---
I have *too* much stuff. 
---
You use ‚Äútoo‚Äù when you‚Äôre describing having a lot of something. 
---
I am in *too* much pain. I have *too* many video games. I am writing *too* much. 
---
Think of the extra ‚Äúo‚Äù as being exasperated. ‚ÄúUGH! I have *TOO* much homework!‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúTo‚Äù is generally used *to* connect two different nouns. 
---
I go *to* the store. I listen *to* the man.  
---
And of course, ‚Äútwo‚Äù is a number!
---
Can I just say that I haven't noticed the length of time between expansions because of how well they did this set. Good job folks
---
Thanks I conceded every time I got close to five this month and hit rank 2 last season to ensure I would be guaranteed a shot at doing this!
---
Don't get me wrong he's a douche but he's a bit right tho why are you playing casual with your full blown meta deck? I hated ppl like you so much when i started playing back then and practicing in casual mode.
---
NINE MANA NINE SIX!!!!!
---
Time to start hoarding coins
---
Damn, I didn't realize legend was in the top 0.25%.  I'm trying to get to top 5% in smash and it's been such a trial... I guess the fact that HS is F2P is a big difference, but still
---
Y'know, I think I'd love this. Like, the "Hearthstone Logo" is what I usually want on a card back... but a card back that looks like the Card Packs?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I would absolutely start dropping money on Goblins vs. Gnomes and Mean Streets of Gadgetzan packs to get those card packs. Same for this one. Or maybe a card back that looked like that floating city card that Rafaam picked up in the trailer. This would be epic.
---
&gt; The discard mechanic is a warlock thing and they're trying to keep it class specific .
---
or demon thing, which illidan is one. It sounds like something he'd do. Lorewise, its just weird to asscociate illidan with flame of azzinoth. Surely they are his minions in Black Temple but i bet nobody would relate to them first.
---
Skull of Guldan, Metamorphosis and mana drain are way more recognizable.
---
I run her in Prelate Paladin. I have two rushes, two lifesteals (okay those four are really just two minions but w/e), and I love tutoring deathrattles. It's a good deal.
---
Heres a version in shaman i have had 7-1 success with, winning from both first and second.

No.

Theory on Class legendaries:
---
Elise: Either Priest or Druid.
---
Brann: Hunter (only Hunters wield guns IIRC).
---
Reno: Rogue.
---
Finn: Either Shaman or Paladin (where the murloc tribe usually shows up).
---
People saying that it‚Äôs feelsbad to get it and not as good as the big dragons, if I was a new player I‚Äôd be praying I get brightwing, all of the other dragons are either far worse (Dwing, Noz, Onyxia) require really high dust cost decks (Maly, Alexstraza, Ysera) and on top of it all brightening is arguably more fun because you play it more, get cards you don‚Äôt have and it‚Äôs also far less of a hindrance in most decks than say onyxia in token Druid
---
I'm imagining the Yugioh intro now

---
and the deathrattle summons only 1/1 fewer stats.
---
No, they will release it in August, the same schedule that they've done in the past few years.
---
what if reno was reprinted exactly the same? would it work in standard?
---
I don't know, The Beast is a core card in my "Big Priest, but all the minions suck" deck. It's potentially the second best Barnes pull after Majordomo.
---
The Beast was my first packed legendary and I was so pumped to get him. After using him in Hunter for a few games, I removed him from the deck (and eventually dusted him). Then I knew why people hate the card.
---
i don't really remember deck that well, but i think it was an inner fire deck. that guy was really hard for the enemy to get rid of permanently, so it always gave me a target for the combo.
---
yap i am thinking to try mechatun deck shrinking ray and wild pyromancer
---
True.
---
League of explorers..? oh my gosh! so excited for this one, I wish they released it earlier so I could see it being used in wcg or hct tournaments.
---
i still see a decent amount of OTK and deathrattle priests, wont be completely obsolete (rank 7 - 4 wild area)
---
The EVIL team has five members (Rafaam, the fortune teller, Dr Boom, Togwaggle, and Hagatha), and the League of Explorers has four, so that would make it up to an even nine to match the classes. It'll probably be something like:
---
- Druid = Elise
---
- Hunter = Brann
---
- Mage = Reno
---
- Paladin = Finley
---
As for the third expansion, it'll probably bring in some big third-party antagonist (I'm thinking Nefarian, Kel'thuzad, Ragnaros, or Deathwing) to mess up both sides' plans, possibly forcing them to work together or at least hold a temporary truce.
---
2 of my first 3 legendaries ever are here!  (The Beast and Millhouse)  The other is probably not far behind (King Mukkla)
---
beat me to the "beat me to it" comment...
---
Can we start referring to the original Illidan as 'the unprepared'?
---
Now you can stop playing!
---
Somebody do this please
---
I was just wondering the same thing
---
Modern problems, require modern solutions.
---
I play wild for fun, ridiculous combos. Not because I want to win in one stroke, but I just enjoy seeing my idea for a combo either come together or fall apart. _Horribly._ With that caveat, I'm enjoying...
---
- Astral Tiger Druid will forever be near and dear to me. Spiritsinger Umbra remains one of my best crafts ever and I smile every time Undatakah hits the board. Loved Dollmaster + draw 3 cards in that deck before they nerfed Nourish.
---
- Kobold Illusionist / Malygos Rogue edges into the unfun "I want to win in one turn" category, but still ends up being a lot of interesting decisions to get to that point.
---
- Quest Mage Voltron is every bit as awesome as it sounds. I have no regrets about crafting Mimiron's Head.
---
- Wrathguard / Treachery / Glinda / Mechwarper / Zillax / Wargear works with 1 Thaurassian tick and never fails to entertain. Trying to include Fel Reaver and infinite Scorp-o-matic as an alternate combo didn't work out so well. It turns out that Fel Reaver can't cause fatigue.
---
Imagine being so 14 that you‚Äôre using ‚Äútriggered‚Äù unironically
---
They enforce a meta. I hope they realize people hate this before we end up like HotS.
---
This is very unlikely - because some people continue buying each bundle and pack they can get.
---
Wasn't there also 4/7/7 and Totem Golem that went stupid well with Tunnel Trogg around the same time?
---
Oof
---
Mana wraith is... an interesting choice, to say the least.
---
Other than that, this is a pretty regular darkest lock game.
---
IIRC it was the other overload cards that went with it, namely 4/7/7 and Totem Golem (the latter of which helped make a 0/5/5 taunt)
---
It was just synergy all the way down
---
We'll always have Paris

[Something like this?](https://hearthcards.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/00/6b/31/05/006b3105.png). Maybe the Hero Power can be something like Summon 3 Silver Hand Recruits since he's a prominent member in the Silver Hand Order and would fit thematically.

no... wtf

F for Regis for crafting Golden Celestia
---
Yes, that is of course the reason why this isn‚Äôt a consistently reproducible otk
---
It's very straightforward. If minions trade, each deals damage according to its attack stat. The same applies to your hero if he attacks with a weapon.
---
I think you'll be fine with this very quickly.
---
Why is this on this sub?
---
Could have sworn Trump had a run where he faced Alchemist Wendy 3 consecutive times.
---
WAS OP during beta.
---
When yeti was meta.
---
Times have changed

I would definitely test it for a month or two

Would you explain [this move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3SpMadmST0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=767) to me?
---
He's using Dragonhawk to attack directly, in which the special ability is that it gets to attack twice BUT...because it is sitting adjacent to Direwolf it gains an extra attack point, raising it to 2. Attack twice with an attack of 2 would deal 4 damage, correct? How come the health drops from 22 to 20. Shouldn't it be 18 instead?
---
Wowhobbs is single handily saving cho from this position

But even if you only ever buy the smallest available release bundle and nothing else, this is still a better deal, no matter your current collection.

I am not.  What is the reference?

OMFG STILL, I THOUGHT THESE POST DIED OUT BUT NOOOOOO, SOMONE HAD TO RUIN IT AND PIST SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN POATED 30 MILLION TIMES!

If it was 4 mana.
---
aswell as tuskaar totemic (before it got nerfed), I remember a time where people ran card for card standard midrange shaman in wild and it still demolished everything.
---
I just need the Milhouse and I'm 5/5!
---
Mech Hunter is one of the strongest counters to warrior right now.
---
I'll never apologise
---
where is the 14?
---
Would be perfect if they nerf mech hunter and conjurers.
---
If HS had a service like that would you seriously think it would charge only 10$/month (120$/year)? Right now if you buy the pre-release every time it will be around 200$/year you'll only have all the common and rare, but only 15-20 epics and a handful of legendary. If HS had this service I think they would charge like 100$/month (more if you want to add all single content)
---
...I may have completely forgotten about Lady in White lol. The other two you mentioned I'm not convinced were specifically printed to push the combo. Arms is a solid buff in a class that's had solid buffs before that isn't much different in design from other buffs in a class whose hero power inherently synergizes with buffs. Mosh'ogg is a neutral card designed to be a giant wall with the high health, taunt, and divine shield which inherently synergizes with buffs. Ysera and Hecklebot have high health but that doesn't mean they're specifically meant to synergize with the combo.

She will ALWAYS be boss #9 of chapter 5.
---
The best way to deal with her is to have some sort of mana cheating going on (robes of gaudiness, togwaggles dice, ..). Because she tries to steamroll you early game. She is very powerful in the first few turns, and if you dont clear her secret-synergy minions then they are getting out of control. This is why you need to have great turns 1, 2 and 3. 
---
Beware of splitting image secret, always attack her weakest minion first. She has no board clear or removal, so as soon as you basically gain control over the board, you can be quite sure of a win.

You should delete all your friends so you have that 0 at the start.

For me that would be impossible.
---
Tavern brawls mostly, but I've missed a lot of quests lately. These days I don't have that much time to play HS so when I do I'd rather play something I enjoy instead of spending my time doing quests just to get some gold.

I really wish we could do quests in single player though :(

she is a faerie dragon, and faerie dragons have 3/2 stats in hearthstone
---
Very hard to narrow it down to one thing.  I would say the following are all factors:
---
\- Able to play to their outs
---
\- Finds the right balance between playing around cards and willing to take risks
---
\- Knows the meta, knows how to play all types of decks, knows how to play vs other types of decks
---
But I guess the #1 thing would be
---
\- Can think 4-5+ turns ahead and can think of lines of play that lead to victories in tough matchups that other players would not
---
Wasnt that fixed
---
Couldnt you just have played unranked?
---
Noice
---
Edwin is core to standard
---
Leeroy is core to standard &amp; wild
---
Ziliax is core to standard &amp; wild but standard rogues stopped running it for the time being
---
Toggle seems to be core to standard
---
I would start there
---
However if you are at the higher ranks I would personally only craft leeroy as you can use that card in so freaking many decks you shouldn't ever regret it.  Once you hit rank 20 and start playing net decks then you can decide what you want.  Just use the higher ranks to play fun home made decks.  Just my opinion ofc so do whatever you want :).
---
I like how they dealt with things, but some things could have worked out better. The cards, while better designed than average, weren't particularly exciting. The Rise of the Mechs mini-expansion added some broken shit in SN1P-SN4P and Crystology, which is so evident that I can't imagine it's an accident. The Heist didn't have the depth or challenge for repeated play.
---
But they're on the right track. Just saying that a bit more inspired designs and balancing would be nice.
---
i honestly dont care the deck is utter cancer and completely unfair and unfun to play against. I dont even go in the format anymore due to that 1 deck
---
I dont get it
---
Knowing what cards your opponent has with high success rate. Whenever I see a long fatigue game with toast or kibler and they say exactly what the last cards im always impressed, even more so early game when they play around multiple card combos. Deck trackers make it easier now but they did this in old videos when they weren't around.
---
Depends on your play style.  Miracle mage is by far the most competitive decks of those though many players dislike its play style, it is definitely broken, some players really enjoy it.  I wouldn't do cubelock it's not that great and very expensive.  Ancient one rogue is strictly casual.  Mecha'thun warlock is tier 3, personally I think it is a fun deck to play though it can get hard countered by other decks and struggle vs aggro if you don't draw well.
---
I finished with the "stole a card" shrine... then I tried to find the cards that duplicate it. It was easy at the final boss, when I stole like half of his deck...

Have you tried finishing the tutorial?

I started playing yesterday and now I'm playing free chapter on adventure mode. I'm facing 7th boss and my question is if I lose a match do I have to beat all bosses again?
---
789 wins and no 12 win key, what's going on there?
---
Kriduard#2156 EU, 80g quest trading. 
---
I'll show, you go first please.
---
Try kibler‚Äôs spell damage mage. It‚Äôs so fun to play people are caught off guard with it.
---
Can you imagine if we still have this in standard. I mean i know it didnt see play during standard but getting it on cylcone mage would be huge.
---
You have OCD don't you lol
---
Shush shush shush... I can only get so erect!
---
It wasn‚Äôt a mirror, he was playing thief priest, which is why he has priest cards.
---
Maybe try two Owls and Barista as well? These inclusions worked wonder for me against Mech Hunter and Conjurer Mages and even helped to win a few games against Mech Paladin. I did cut both Dynomatics for it, because they didn't help me much against Mech Hunter.
---
The climb was so damn easy this time, I even didn't plan to hit legend at all, but with the Barista-List I destroyed all the Mech Hunter easily.
---
Good luck for your last push!
---
What makes me sad when this happens to a class, is Blizz will just put them into irrelevancy as soon as possible. Though their track record has been a lot better lately (hunter are still good, and there haven't been to many offenders as of late.)
---
You could do it on 3 with pirate warrior its not impressing
---
Not playing asap. Looking at all options of play.
---
For sure. I'd argue it was worth coin+Deadly Shot Turn 2 on a buffed Northshire Cleric (and I don't think anyone will argue you should have used Deadly Shot Turn 3 after it was buffed a 2nd time). Northshire is arguably the best 1-mana card in the game because it can be a card-drawing engine, and you should prioritize eliminating it.
---
Your plays definitely had merit; developing your board is important. As you get more experienced with the game, you'll be more familiar with which classes are the most dangerous when you leave their minions alive; for example, Priests and Paladins specialize in buffs, and Mages have Conjurer's Calling, so they can turn almost any minion that stays alive into a much bigger threat.
---
They call it 'maintenance mode' we call it 'I reported this bug half a year ago mode' stopped playing half a year ago after I realized this.
---
I think big priest is one of the easiest opponents in wild. 
---
I play darkest hour warlock and mill Druid.
---
Dalaran heist has been great. I'm nearing 10 attempts on the Heroic chapter 5. On a side note yesterday I lost to Kadgar on 1 hp. On turn two I forgot to attack with my minion and missed two damage. No exaggeration, i only remembered when I was half asleep last night and it caused me to bolt upright in bed
---
Maybe not nerfing warrior could be fine, but please give more tools to other classes. It feels really bad when you have to try to set up 4+ board reloads in hopes that warrior just uses all of it's brawls, and warpath before turn 10. I don't enjoy playing aggro mech hunter , but I enjoy warrior having a dead turn 5 with dynomatic.
---
#Ham1575 on NA
---
adding any friends for spectate quest
---
This was a strong priest opener so winning was probably gonna be unlikely. However, I think holding the deadly shot on T3 was not the right play. I would have played that tot clear the 5/7 and follow up with companion plus shimmerfly or marked shot depending on the opponents turn. If he develops a second threat youre gonna need lucky outs from some random spells. Playing an animal companion into a 5/7 seems weak, because he can just clear it and heal back up while developing. Him not clearing the Misha was also a mistake IMO. Hope that helps

Yep yep yep!

Kinda getting tired of that Togwaggle character in like the 2nd (or 3rd?) expansion in a row now. Could we have some new character introducing the expansion instead?
---
Doesn't matter.
---
That was then, and we are here, now.
---
You mentioned the problem being that not all classes have access to hero cards. That's not entirely true as the cards are simply too powerful. Even if both players have them in their deck the games are decided based on who draws it.
---
You were always visible when invisible....
---
‚ÄúUh oh.‚Äù
---
But now you can be seen without any Problems. Before it was stealth like.in most other games.
---
And a partridge in a pear tree.
---
Big warlock is a fucking dead wild meme dude
---
How did you topdeck Pogo if you played the Golden Monkey?
---
Honestly he should go to Wild and be replaced with another legendary. Not because he‚Äôs OP, but just because he‚Äôs that bad of a card. At least Millhouse and Nozdormu are fun.
---
Art is a great form of expression!
---
You can still try it!  It's the BEST adventure experience in the game!  Truly feels like a fun adventure!
---
Yeah I run into alot of Bm ppl in the lower ranks like from 20 to 7 ppl think there hot shit because there beating you but thx goodness I'm at rank 4 and haven't seen any bm players in a few days....when they bm me I rope every turn out....its only fair
---
Its closed there too
---
yes, that's why all the people in tournaments are millionaires

Tweet this at purple, the symmetry will certainly give him an orgasm.
---
first time?
---
On heroic, with every combination - so there are 180 in total.  
---
Yeah wing 3 is a bit unfun sometimes.  And f\_ck Jepetto.  Seriously.  Wing 5 i haven't had TOO much difficultly with so far.  Feel free to come and check out the stream if you like :)
---
Yeah I foudn that guy, but he's only in wing 5.  It's a bit disappointing I guess.  Plus he's not very subtle.  The murloc easter egg was neat - you had to keep him safe, and there were no clues to suggest that's what you had to do.  Plus it was a unique treasure, and a pretty sweet one at that!
---
Echo and twinspell cards are overcosted to compensate for value since they 'add cards' to your hand.
---
Extra arms is actually above curve for a twinspell.
---
The main reason the game hasn't broke is because Priest is ass lmao
---
No but usually he does some stuff before killing himself
---
like killing you instead
---
Thanak you for listening! :D
---
Oh damn never got 2 golden in 1 pack
---
Hoot hoot hoot hoot
---
That's debatable, since you also get the flexibility of twinspell. It's not as clear cut or obvious as you're making it out to be.
---
It can take up to 24 hours before this will go away. I guess you tried to pay with a connected cdc. The transaction is still pending but will bounce within 24 hours. Had this several times. You'll get through mate!

r/expectedthanos
---
just out of curiosity: what is your wing 5 heroic win chance?
---
I've completed it with paladin and warlock but hitting a wall with every other class (50 failed runs maybe?), especially without the gaudiness bonus.
---
Something something perfectly balanced
---
The ability to use different strategies within the same game and knowing when to switch strategy based on probabilities and risk/reward ratios.
---
Most of the game are still decided purely by RNG (card draw and deck design), so basically before the game even starts, like a rock/paper/scissor game, but when the games are close I think that's what matters.
---
Please take your meds.
---
Me hoping the aggro deck I‚Äôve managed to stall until turn 12 topdecks anything other than Leeroy. 
---
Topdecks Leeroy and kills me.
---
...but then the boss appeares who really thrives with that anomaly and shows you how it's done :D
---
50/50
---
The defile puzzle is especially nasty because it's so obvious that you have to set up a defile and you can start working out parts of a chain and just keep doing that for two hours without actual progress.
---
I looked at blizzard support, and they said log out of account, restart device, log back in.  
---
It didnt work, so I'm kinda stuck here : (
---
I had this happen once, plus a normal epic. Couldn't believe it was possible
---
Praise all be to Yogg.
---
Nefarian has been hinted at. They said this year there would be ‚Äúnefarious evils‚Äù.
---
It's getting closer! A month and a week or two away!
---
Priest has the most and best board clears in the game right now.
---
"No one can prove or disprove" that Brode "personally disagrees with some of the decisions about HS's development".
---
However, it sure is odd that the game was left languishing for years under Brode's leadership, and suddenly got a whole lot fresher upon his exit.  
---
Also, he could probably afford to leave Blizzard after years of what I can only assume where he made major bank, at least in terms of what most pleabs make.
---
Pull up a chair!
---
Root for my girl Yuqi yay
---
Because Finley will be a choose one card
---
It's way overtuned. It didn't need twinspell. Blizzard will probably let it run its course until the next expansion drops, then evaluate it from there.
---
maybe we're all just autistic

It could also be that since the player base has waned they are allowing for bigger shifts

Cool dude I‚Äôm a mech hunter too
---
Especially in a control match-up where he elysianas when there are 6 bombs left in his deck
---
Perfection
---
I saw this happen in a highlight reel but it didn't show that it was a screamed card as far as I remember anyways, glad this is a wild only bug. Might mean awhile before its fixed though...
---
This is too true. OP you must've been through a lot ;-;
---
Prismatic lens really is core in this deck that needs all the card draw it van get. Apart from crystology it's the only card that draws 2 cards.
---
The chances of drawing exactly shirvallah and holy wrath with lens are very low.
---
Secondly you need the 2 holy wraths in very few matchups (warrior), against most decks 25 dammage is enough so you can have one wrath stuck in your hand.
---
And if you have enough card draw and didnt draw shirvallah or both wraths yet and don't need to play lens right now, you can just wait.
---
"I'm not done with it, and I'm still not done with it..."

FTFY

it actually brought me back to playing the game, its a nice change of direction that blizzard took.
---
In wild, maybe.
---
Enough for me take the time to make this meme lol
---
April 2019 winning 5 games in play mode got you that card back on the deck that Togwaggle peeks at. ‚ÄúCard of Shadows‚Äù
---
It makes me feel like I am wasting my time playing. I play the first 4 turns and get the mage down to 16hp then he puts out a giant. I almost remove it... then he splits it into two 7/8 taunts EVERY TIME which effectively stops my advance and ends the game.
---
The consistent ability to transform the giant into a giant with TAUNT is bullshit.
---
Agreed. Priest just needs one decent Basic/Classic AoE to make them playable. People have suggested Excavated Evil, which I think is the best choice, but Psychic Scream and Lightbomb are options too, albeit far more powerful ones.
---
Shuffling cards into a deck triggers it (but not every time). Typically when the very next card you draw is one that was shuffled. Entomb and scream are the worst offenders, but any "shuffle a card into [a] deck" can cause it.
---
But that‚Äôs the thing you don‚Äôt have to do it. It‚Äôs just something you choose to do. Do you really get emote spammed every single game ? As I said before maybe it‚Äôs because I get emote spammed 1 out of 50 games or so. Even when they do it just gives me more desire to win and focus on not making misplays. I understand that a fair amount of people would use the feature, but I just don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs so high up on the list of wants is the point I‚Äôm trying to make. Again Id rather see something added to the game to make it feel like you earned something. That‚Äôs why I want achievements added. Personal I don‚Äôt care if I have to make two extra clicks ever few games.
---
I bet there's a curve-ball. We don't get 'league of explorers.' We get league of explorer imposters.
---
If something annoying happens in every one in 10 games and it could easily not happen with the click of a single button forever, I‚Äôll take that option, thank you very much. 
---
The better question is why you seem to be concerned about it, as adding this feature does not in anyway take away from anything else in the game or prevent them from doing anything new
---
I'd almost call LoE the best expansion ever. ALMOST.

If I post a link to an article will you read it and learn for yourself or will you expect someone to simplify and dumb it down as much as possible so that you can understand it?
---
Well done for getting to legend with it. Any other cards which you could consider? Maybe to replace Leeroy?
---
Thanks for the info OP!
---
TIL this subreddit is filled with folks who don't know about Reservoir Dogs and like to get hyperbolic about the smallest issues.
---
Outjerked again i guess
---
I remembered it the same. At the start of that expac I ran Renolock a lot but after whatever nerfs happened at the time (bad memory) I remember playing a lot of dragon priest mirrors. Too many secret agents.

&gt; I've been spending the last 8 hours at work thinking about how I can make that vid into a new meme format.

This would make zero sense to someone in the 90s
---
While kangor really is a good card, it isn't necessary for what the deck is trying to do. Also it is a card that only sees use in this specific deck and it rotates in 10 months so since you are on a low dust budget I think it's a low priority craft. If you really want to play this deck at full potential you will need the second balefull banker. Thalnos on the other hand is the more all round good card that is really good in this deck but also will stay in standard forever so it might be a good investion.
---
I feel like everyone in the Hearthstone world are characters made by people who are hanging out in the tavern.
---
[Big Priest is *by far* the most common deck at EVERY RANK.](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wild-drr/wild-distribution/)
---
But go on...
---
So here's the basic strat.. flood and burn.. drawing takes priority.  
---
You can use tech in the portal overfiend (6 mana 5/6) if you would like.
---
One banker is usually good, but sometimes 2 is nice and can be used on Luna in a pinch.  Best if you are near the end of your deck before you shuffle your last 3 portals.  Goal is to have one or two spawn as you run out of cards so you can Nomi, trade the last portal fiend, and baleful banker in one turn.  Sometimes you can get these combo pieces for 1 mana which makes it easier.  
---
That is the final win con, but using portals to fight for board and basically always taking your minions on board to face should have them on edge and trying to remove constantly.
---
Final thoughts:  the deck isn't that good, but when it works, it works.

EU 80g quest. you show, i'll go first.
---
I had this happen today, cant remember which boss did it but I know it was the 4th in the citadel. Possibly Wert..?
---
Clearly I‚Äôm not concerned about it, I was just trying to inquire why people want that feature so much. I see this posted nearly every time an new expansion is on the horizon. It has nothing to do with not wanting the game to get more quality of life features but more so why the desire for prevalent when there is a plethora of other things I‚Äôd rather the dev team spend time implementing into the game. My entire first post was just purely to get why, I agreed with a few of your points and they are reasonably but from my experience I never thought that it was a top priority.
---
I understand it's a tech card. My point is that it is a bad tech card for the meta and in my 90 game sample pool I have yet to see it to good use.
---
A man of the people
---
Just got the app installed again, this time on ipad. It‚Äôs been at least 2 years since I last played, probably a bit longer but I can‚Äôt recall the card sets. In the past when I have taken longer breaks I‚Äôve always gotten the returning player experience with some freebies and missions designed to refresh my memory and get me back into the game. However, this time around I was thrown right back in where I left off, with only some information on retired sets, what kind of year it is (dragon) and some legendaries to compensate for Hall of famed cards. I guess I don‚Äôt need more freebies, but it would be nice to get up to speed and I was looking forward to play the memory refreshment games if you know what I mean.
---
I guess my question is, has anyone else recently come back after a long break and how was your experience? Did they remove the feature completely or is the ‚Äùreturning player experience‚Äù limited to a number of returns? Either way I‚Äôm excited to be back and I‚Äôll probably start with the new adventures.
---
Cheerios!
---
You are not immune to propaganda
---
Honest to God I could care less about the meta at  Legend rank and here's why.
---
- A low Legend, people play trash tier decks because they have nothing to lose
---
- At high Legend, there are so few people playing the same stuff, that you can easily a homebrew a meme deck specifically made to counter them and go top 100 with it.
---
It's no surprise that upon thousand of Twitter decks that work in top 50, top 25 top 100 Legend Rank end up never being played at rank 5-1 and for good reason.
---
I get it, i just feel that wild is what it is. It's not really a legitimate competitive format, just a shit show. But maybe that's just me, and HCT, and worlds, and grandmasters, and blizzard, and the pros. Yes they have the wild open but i mean.... 
---
I'll just go sit in the electric chair now, have at it
---
Awesome dude
---
I don't get why:
---
Is a mage card. Hordes of creatures or sacrificing minions have never been the mage's style.
---
Ony costs 3, even unsleeping soul costs 4.
---
Is a twinspell.
---
Can be cast on enemy minions as removal in a pinch, which is quite effective against buufs and magnetic.
---
Brilliant.
---
Sweet! Mind sharing?
---
Guys.           
---
This means more them .02% of players use Hemmet.            
---
            
---
Also, would like to see if Wild differs much.
---
He was *okay-ish* for a very very short time when naturalize was still standard and you could do a wonky fill your opponent's hand with shit and mill druid
---
The order for this unlikely scenario would be:
---
Battle cry
---
'whenever you play' triggered effects
---
Minion dies
---
Play dragon inner fire priest in wild. Only costs like 2k dust and is quite strong
---
Maybe it‚Äôs just nostalgia talking but I loved Blackrock and Naxx. Things were simpler back then. Also, Kel‚Äôthuzad‚Äôs card intro dialogue.
---
You. You‚Äôre good.
---
Seriously. You‚Äôre awesome at this.
---
I think an awesome solo adventure would be the exact same as this except with the League of Explorers in the E.V.I.L Gangs positions, and they take back the city. That would be epic
---
I used to run a control priest otk deck in beta up through the first few expansions. I can only imagine the control available now. I just loved letting people think they won, then turning the tables. Had one guy actually stalk meIRL and threaten my family because I pissed him off to much with it. Them he found out my families a bunch of gun toting psycho 1%er bikers and I was training MMA daily. We all had a good laugh at his expense, after untying him.
---
Kind of doesn‚Äôt count, but Undertaker Priest was also really good and I think it actually had a positive win rate against Huntertaker.
---
I‚Äôm amazed at the stuff this sub upvotes sometimes
---
a high effort post
---
It‚Äôs when you draw the top card of your deck hence the name top deck. For example if you‚Äôre in need of drawing leeroy Jenkins to win the game you‚Äôre hoping the top card of your deck is leeroy. You‚Äôre hoping to topdeck leeroy.
---
Don't know why Un'Goro is in B tier. It was the most fun expansion for me.
---
We need another Dr OP!
---
kripperoni is pretty off here, but i'm assuming he's rating based on arena
---
Just put it on 4 mana. Then i think it's balanced.
---
Did your opponent cast psychic scream?
---
Nice, I really like his casting, always with a sense of humour and always that big draw.
---
So EU pairing with Scottle, have find some time this weekend to check the matches.
---
my secret-anyfin welcomes the board clears. just no taunts, especially the statue.
---
ah, the oldschool way. The times where while playing Priest mirror the first one to play Ysera would probably lose as it gets stolen right after.

you can get to high legend with a basic budget inner fire priest... priest are ok in this meta
---
Oh yeah, this can definitely win some games, but it's a bit niche.  SW Horror combo is a bit more versatile.  It can clear wide boards or Yseras.
---
I always knew Leeroy is murloc
---
So it's not exactly a bad tech card, but rather a bad meta to use this card as a tech.

This is amazing! What makes this better or worst then Shaman murloc?

I love how if I‚Äôve ever posted non-gameplay content here it gets removed.

---
Forget that quest rogue had to be nerfed .....3 times.
---
Shadows is S tier and RR/KnC/GvG should be lower.
---
Well yeah, but MtG never quite took off in the digital arena until after HS. I played MtG with my friends back in highschool. It was great. My cards are either back at my parents or with one of my siblings. And one of HS' strengths is the fact that it's more casual friendly.
