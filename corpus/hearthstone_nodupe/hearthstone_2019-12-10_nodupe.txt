---
No, the *other* cheek.
---
I have one available you still need an 80?
---
Thank you too!
---
Have a great day/night!
---
Everyone is in the same boat so I see no need for this change.  
---
It would just benefit players who get back to the shop even more than it currently does also.
---
Haven’t played hs since the expansion frozen throne.
---
What’s the best class to take fully advantage of this new expansion? Do all classes get dragons!
---
Also Instant Dragonqueen Alextrasza, followed by kronx and maybe ysera.
---
Discoverable!
---
You gotta craft them to know what they do!
---
Now seriously, I expect this to be a bug.
---
Gotta be a bug would be silly not to know what cards do before you craft em
---
Are we getting the usual run retirement when the set launches, did I miss it when they changed the sets a couple days ago, or neither? I haven't seen an in-game reminder like usual.
---
I always seem to be a week behind the top 200 MMR. Got within 100 points when 200 was 6.3k. I'm 7.1k but top 200 is like 8k T_T.
---
whoaaa...
---
[GOLDEN COMMON!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuLZTKBUhUE)
---
So its probably not worth it to spend my dust to craft this guy on DoD release and isntead go for some other much needed legends? How long until the next expansion is released and this guy is removed?
---
Make this game faster, please. Also, the screenshake.  I'd love it if there's an option to turn off screenshake. It's fine in standard mode, but in BG where eventually everything is gonna be huge, the screenshake is kinda unecessarry. To me, at least.
---
How do we access heros to buy?
---
welcome to karazan, while youre here, can i interest you in one of the 10 expansions that have released since.
---
Definitely what I'll be playing day one.
---
&gt; They were surprised by how people will camp at lower levels and be happy with finishing 3rd / 4th in order to keep leveling up.
---
This works tho. I usually stop leveling at four and just find buffers for my board. That is assuming I get a triple and roll a Lightfang/Brann/Junkbot. I upgrade to T5 when it's at 4-5 gold only.
---
I don't aim for #1 finish. Top 4 is good enough for me.
---
Ever heard of a card called [[chillmaw]] ?
---
#[Chillmaw](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/7/78/Chillmaw.jpg)

#####*Chillmaw is a level 82 elite frost wyrm circling northeast of Ironwall Rampart, south of the Shadow Vault, north of the Valley of Fallen Heroes. Riding Chillmaw are three elite  Cultist Bombardiers who spawn shortly after Chillmaw is aggroed.*

Honestly this guy gets around, he's in [MTG](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=473156&amp;type=card) also
---
this card is so bad
---
They don't change text.
---
They do not. See Mechano-egg.
---
No they don't. Test with mechano egg, it can still be attacked, but will skip it's turn if it hasn't been buffed higher than 0 attack. The 0 attack minion only attacks if it's your last minion, even then I can't remember if it attacks or your opponent keeps attacking till the egg pops
---
You'll have probably 4 months of usage with him in standard if you crafted him today.
---
Do what your want man, but you are really going to spend 90% of 8000 gold on packs for one set? I don't think it's very efficient, because you can get all the commons and most rares from 100-150 packs. I guess if you want every card this set without having to craft it, that's one way to do it. But I would spread it around more. I've been playing 4 years completing most dailies and not even FTP (I usually pre-order smaller bundles and buy pack deals), I only open \~150 packs per set!
---
Copypastestone
---
[deleted]
---
Agreed, bagurgle gives too much stat and consistency. Not least because you can discover it off of the other murloc
---
Oh nm then. I just remembered seeing a mechano egg attack and guess It was just last or buffed or something.
---
It's just as likely as getting any other legendary.
---
But if you DO have them all from one set, you can improve your odds of getting a particular gold legendary from that type of pack by disenchanting the regular version.
---
The next legendary you open in a pack WILL be that legendary and COULD be golden. If it's not golden, disenchant it again and wait for the pity timer again.
---
Not smart if you keep buying pack after pack, cheaper to just craft, but for classic packs that we just keep getting it can help!
---
Legion td for warcraft 3 was the first I think
---
Small player base.. maybe!?? I Play everyday got almost instant games and never meet the same.. so it fine and healthy.
---
You could only buy the adventure for gold if you had the first wing, AKA if you played hearthstone when it got released. If you didn’t then you had to buy it for cash in the bnet store. 
---
The only new thing is now you can view and buy it I game aswell as in bnet store.
---
Cheers. Gonna test!
---
But there are rewards for ranking to a given level in any class, and earning a Quest card for that class would be reasonable seeing as how it's basically an upgrade.
---
Why there is only room for 3 quests in the log is a question for another day, because that seems like where it should be mentioned by the same reasoning that a Quest is generally something you were going to do anyway but if you do it enough times there is an actual reward that is not stymied in statistical probabilities and finance.
---
PENETRATES!
---
It doesn't attack even as your last minion. If both you and your opponent only have zero-attack eggs on board, it counts as a draw -- this has happened to me once.
---
Our hero!
---
and we shall never speak of Cavern Dreamer ever again.
---
Isn’t whiz bang rotating out?
---
Do u stream? I’m stuck just under 7K can’t seem to crack it. Would love to watch someone who’s the best at this
---
Feels you mate
---
The problem is not Coldlight Seer!!! The problem is Megasaur!! Divine Shield specifically!! PLEASE don't not nerf it!! Brann as well. Right now the 3 best cards in the game are Brann, Megasaur and Primalfin. Yes better than Amalgam, Cobalt, whatever else. The nerfs are so simple, Brann should be tier 6, Megasaur shouldn't offer Divine Shield and Primalfin shouldn't offer a minion from a higher tier than your tavern. I don't even care about Primalfin they don't have to nerf him, they (will) need the tier 4 help anyway, but Megasaur needs to never give Divine Shield. That's the MECH identity, not Murloc! Murlocs are poison! They are invincible now because they are a combination of mechs and murlocs, and they're also the best at abusing the best card in the game(Brann). I don't know why Brann wasn't nerfed with Lightfang, I cannot believe it, obviously he is being nerfed in the next patch no way around it. But Megasaur needs to be nerfed too! Please!! I don't want another meta with invincible murlocs! And the big ultimate problem is Megasaur giving them divine shield!!!! Not Coldlight Seer!!!
---
You are free to go.
---
You think I'm bragging about ten wins because I'm superior? Get your fuckin head checked mate lol wow
---
Maybe we'll get her when the adventure releases
---
This is an interesting interaction.
---
When Elise copies Floop, the copied Floop stays as the previous minion. (In your case Malygos) Only the original Floop changes to Elise.
---
This is because the copied Floop doesn't "see" Elise being played as it was generated by her battlecry.
---
Yeah, but I'm fine with that. It's been a while since they've had many fun Rez options. Meanwhile, it feels like Priest gets a new way to use Rez to cheat things out every year. And a rune to bring back a fallen Ally not once but twice has great Shaman flavor.
---
whizbang will still be updated with the latest deck recipes each expansion after he rotates. good luck staying interested in playing the game while putting all your dust towards "real decks" as a new f2per.
---
nah, lve tried everything and have submitted to fate-
---
blizzard is a small indie company that cant even get things right.
---
Alrighty
---
No lmao, the safest craft is after 2 months and the meta settles. Let’s be real here, in this context, I mean cards that can be crafted day 1 and used in several archetypes, like alex and kronx.
---
I have posted my problem in a bug report. Thank you!
---
I love galakrond's baby arms
---
Hmmm interesting, I've never played magic or watched it, but I'm listening; what should I look for?
---
Nani?
---
What in God’s name
---
Done with Kacpi#21527
---
Exactly. Kronx devastation can also be game changing.
---
All classes get dragons! Five of the classes are getting a Galakrond-based hero card, for free for everyone.
---
Wild mode is great. Don't be intimidated by the meta, since you can play whatever you want until you get to rank 10. Don't be intimidated by the "cost" as wild mode is cheaper to play then standard in terms of dust. (More good rares and epics to use instead of legendaries.)
---
Rich kid is getting bored ?
---
So, this is Bob from Overwatch too right? I cant be the only one that sees the resemblance. Please someone tell me I'm not crazy, I've never seen anyone else even mention the connection. I feel like I'm loosing my mind.
---
Bot, over and out.
---
Galakrond has saved Hong Kong
---
This is kinda playable in wild...
---
give me the gold robot
---
And 1 health
---
Ah, the days of Young, when we laughed at garbage.
---
The first time we saw nzoth visually represented was his card art I think.
---
Everyone goes for Murlocs , I think I am done with this mode now. It got boring real quick
---
Hot damn, that's a nice looking pack
---
Yeah iirc Gadgetzan was delayed a few hours on asia server...
---
Must be referring to the legendary card you get in your first 10 packs if you havent open a single pack from that expansion
---
So people who didnt have any packs opened for the wild packs that are now in the store get a legendary in their first 10
---
New hero’s will be released tomorrow
---
You clearly don't understand. I will let Kripp explain it to you:
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/CulturedSpineyTofuGingerPower](https://clips.twitch.tv/CulturedSpineyTofuGingerPower)
---
Explanation starts around the 33 second mark.
---
Whiz bang me
---
This is a really bad time to be talking about crafting. I am NOT crafting anything till at least February, and for a lot of good reasons.
---
They explicitly said they will not do that.
---
Crackling is probably OP so long as Hydra is still in. I think we need a murloc nerd more than a beast buff. Or just an entirely new set of options really.
---
Good looking shop. 
---
And confirmed that the legendary rule in first 10 packs work. 
---
I opened a legendary for grand tournament and GvG in the 5th pack. 
---
Had never opened these packs before.
---
Ive played about 35 games since patch and i havent seen him as an option once. Probably wont at this point before hes nerfed
---
I think some of these points are similar thing that could be said for many hero powers - I already admitted is hero power was top tier but being that murlocs are super strong his ability to steal them throughout the game, not just late game, makes for insanely strong boards the entire time - late game stealing a T6 minion is pretty fucking broken... but if it wasn’t for murlocs being busted, another T1-3 minion would be good, getting a T4-6 minion almost broken.
---
Ya, Zayle disappointed me because I was expecting his decks to actually be okay or at least fun. Honestly like most people I thought he’d have a few uncollectible cards balanced by not being a very good deck.
---
Whizzbang on the other hand is fun to play because Blizzard makes a couple decks that aren’t terribly off of what the standard meta becomes.
---
There isn’t one.
---
btw thats how triplet works in other autobattlers
---
Donating money is more useful and can actually make a change. But I guess using it to gild posts and comments in way better
---
&gt;Ad hominems that aren't accurate.
---
I wonder why Blizzard is imploding these days.
---
Boomship, malygos, mechathun, inner rage, inner rage, whirlwind. Plus empty hand and deck.
---
I have 8 (voted for Rust Buckets) packs.
---
And that can’t be done anymore because of Echo changed.
---
This is a good and frequently overlooked point. Appreciated.
---
Hey Y'all, 
---
1) I was wondering if there it is possible to get a triple-triple of a minion in battlegrounds, basically you have two golden minions can you go for another triple off them?
---
2) I have Wizbang and Zayle, is one hero stronger then the other?
---

---
The fact that it requires you to play the rest of your deck and hand first means that the cost of the number of cards required for the combo decreases, because you need to play every single card in your deck.
---
Lul
---
Ripped Keegan Michael Key
---
If it costs one you get the one coin back no matter what minion. If it costs two you get one coin back making it cost one. If it costs two you get one coin back at the minimum. The thing is no matter the minion you get it may or may not be beneficial to you + the inevitability that the minion can sell back for one coin.
---
Some fool mucked it up and now there are 12 silvers

---

---

---
What in the name!?
---
The Lightfang change has zero chance of happening, if only because of how wordy it is. Also, that's not how you use a semicolon.
---
Maybe run some high value cards and some non dragon big drops, not necessarily Dragons. Just out control your opponent
---
czihihong said that it wasn’t any of the mods. I trust him.
---
Ive definitely heard of them doing this.
---
Aha, that makes sense! I spend longer than I'd care to admit trying to figure out how it was 40 times more likely.
---
But yeah, I agree with your points; it's a great card that'll make some *really* great Trolden highlights, but it's certainly no Zephrys.
---
Malygos, Wakeldred and possibly Goru still kinda iffy on waxel but I love rogue so I feel like I’ll try and make it work regardless. I got a golden DW and I’m not a warrior player at all so it’s a free leggo. I’ll see what I get for my freebies for buyin the bundle and go from there.
---
Problem is if you kill a token minion turn one you have two free coins for next turn plus the opportunity to upgrade tavern
---
&gt;You got this, You're way ahead!
---
Literally last with 9 remaining health
---
Speaking of Kazakus....I have a theory that he’s actually Kronx Dragonhoof
---
The prerelease event typically ends sometime the day before the expansion release
---
I'm pretty sure you can get all commons, rates and 90% of epics with packs and dust you can craft any legendary you need
---
As long as you don’t go Highlander
---
Honestly you should be able to only be allowed to put 7 minions on the board but have the board space for 8 or 9 units.
---
Have not seen a murloc with stats like this before. Wanted to see how high I could get it.
---
XD
---
Ok great, thank  you.
---
Tf
---
Hopefully I don't have to craft too many legendaries, I always craft a couple in gold though.
---
Okay? I think it's pretty well known what whizbang does
---
Ok finally
---
This isn't unique to Hearthstone honestly, people that play games competitively but at a low rank are usually pretty annoying. Just ask any League player what it's like to play in Silver 
---
It's the anonymity mostly I think. When nobody can hold you accountable for being a douche there's nothing stopping some people
---
The nicest combo in the west
---
3 months and two weeks longer than most legendaries I craft
---
We need some kind of Harth VS Bob themed Tavern Brawl.
---
I mean, Murloc's just can do everything and they out-scale so easily early game. I just don't agree with Megasaur being in the pool for much longer, considering every lobby I am playing around 5.5k MMR is nothing but Murlocs.
---
11 11 30 11 13
---
How loooong can this go oooon
---
Quest Shaman is a tier one deck idk what you're talking about with all the quests being weak lol
---
Quest shaman is't tier one in the full game.
---
Well, obviously, I shouldn't have to deal with it anywhere, but lower MMRs shouldn't be this competitive.
---
There's more to expansions than their spotlight cards.
---
Unplayable on smartphone
---
bruh just stat wise this expansion eclipses basically everything we have had in the past, there’s more than just insane looking affects, so many cards are just straight power creep.
---
Not really because invoke cards are also useless
---
No you clearly don’t get that we are trying to kill wild
---
Oh that's cool
---
takin this too serious m8
---
We don't deserve a man this good.
---
Did you watch the video?
---
like downgrade to malygos and upgrade to nozdormy heheh
---
I hate that "older phones" bit. I'm on a freaking iphone X that's less than a year old and I constantly run into animation lag. I've run into games where the next combat starts before I have a chance to see the tavern.

If the Cobalt Guardian has enough attack to one-shot the murlocs, then it's straight up better. Worst case scenario, even trade of 2 hits for 2 hits. More reasonable scenario with decent board positioning, it trades at least 3 hits for 2 hits (it's easy to virtually guarantee 1 divine shield refresh at a bare minimum, if you have a taunt with divine shield and minibots deathrattle). Absolute best case scenario, it can theoretically almost solo an entire board of divine shield + poisonous murlocs, with minibots / Security Rover dudes taking care of some divine shields.
---
On the one hand, mechs have less battlecry buffs than murlocs, and even fewer AoE buffs, so it'll be tough to get them big enough to pull that off. But on the other hand, you can concentrate all the buffs on 1-2 Cobalt Guardians, and there's Sensei to help things, while murlocs have no perma-buffer other than Lightfang (much rarer, and nerfed to only give 1 HP)
---
However, even if you have enough attack to one-shot murlocs, lack of poisonous means it will be almost impossible to one-shot a massive Brann-powered golden Annihilan. And because it can't get (nor would you want to give it) windfury, it's also weaker against cleave. So it's not exactly a straight up upgrade, but still, I do think Cobalt Guardian is *theoretically* the best combat unit in the game and better than a fully decked out murloc, it's just a lot costlier to get it to that point (dozens of buffs to become competitive vs being almost full power the moment you get poisonous and divine shield)
---
I've been theory-crafting the weirdest deathrattle deck involving Apothecary and Waxadred the last couple of days. Basically, instead of thinking deathrattle, Apothecary is basically a battlecry Gnomish Inventor on steroids if you focus on its battleecry.
---
**Most typical Apothecary theory-crafting looks like this:** 
---
Apothecary -&gt; Whelp/Waxadred -&gt; Trigger with Blade/Vial, hope you don't draw all DRs before that
---
**My gameplan with Apothecary** 
---
Play Tempo - Shark/Apothecary -&gt; Refill with Barista and draw until Waxadred kicks in
---
Not going to try to get smart with Necrium Vial or running just the bare number of Whelps/Waxadreds. Just gonna go tempo and squeeze in the Apothecaries over the previous Shark/Gnome draw options.
---
Is this the mysterious gifter that's been running rampant for the past month? What a legend!

---
Questing and Lifedrinker/Shark are interchangeable setting up different scenarios for victory. 
---
I chose Lifedrinker for heals vs. aggro, but questing will provide more pressure vs slower decks. Both variants are capable of 18+ points of burst with same support cards. Despite running Galakrond, this is an aggressive deck. Not gunning for 4-invoke, just Galakrond for the multiple cards that allow for 18+ damage burst next turn (scenarios inside post).
---
Depends on meta, i"ll adjust the speed of the deck sliding between tempo (chip damage) and more consistent 4-invoke Galakrond (more burst). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Note 1: I'm specifically avoiding adding dragons to avoid Dragonmaw Poacher, which I believe every deck will run for the first 2 weeks. 
---
Note 2: I'm starting to believe sap is essential for the meta and will make changes to insert it.

But the original classic ones can,just putting it out there
---
The reason why I don't include the part where Brox wounds Sargeras is because its veracity is questionable after so much lore development. This is the same time period when Azshara pondered whether she could end up marrying him, and when Mannoroth, when told not to back-chat by Queen Azshara, realised that it would take the likes of Kil'jaeden or Sargeras to best her arcane aptitude.
---
The point being that Sargeras as a celestial being and a titan with so much might that he can *literally cut planets in half* wasn't at all founded properly yet. It was 2004, more or less the release of Vanilla WoW. We didn't get to explore the Titans much at all until Wrath of the Lich King, and even then their exact nature was unknown to us.
---
So why I would not say that Brox didn't cut Sargeras, or even one of his avatars, and wound him with the Axe of the Cenarius, I can only reasonably speculate that:
---
1. Sargeras wasn't focused on Brox, especially since we know how badly he wanted to reach Azeroth and how much more of a priority it would have been.
---
2. Sargeras' wound was the equivalent of a paper cut, which did far more damage to his pride than anything actually physical.
---
This isn't to detract too much from Broxigar's achievement. He is one of two mortals *in known history* to have actually done something like this, the second one being the original wielder of the Aldrachi Warblades, Toranaar. 
---
But I can't tell you how it *really* happened because so much has changed that it makes me question the accuracy of this particular line of story development in *The Well of Eternity.* It hasn't been explicitly retconned, but by strong implication I reckon that Sargeras was papercut by Brox as he was berserking into a legion of Demons and that Sargeras put an immediate end to him out of rage, but Brox was never the original focus.

Literally unplayable
---
I’d be tempted to go for it and then just start another.
---
Honestly a lot of cards in the Classic set do not see play in competitive Hs anymore with a few exceptions, if you have not done so, you should purchase up to 10 packs of each set until you get a legendary from it because you are guaranteed a legendary card within the first 10 packs of each set.
---
thx alot.
---
There are five classes with a Galakrond card. You’ll receive one copy of each for free when you open your first Descent of Dragons pack. 
---
I don’t know what you mean by “fraze invoke”.
---
I really like Malygos too, but people seem torn on the cartoonish clash/aspect of it. I think it looks wonderful, great colours and momentum.
---
The only thing I don't understand why Galakrond Shaman named "Control"? Board centric gameplan, no Hagatha, no Elysianna, midrange cruve, and the most strange, not a single AoE/Hex. It is clearly Midrange Galakrond Shaman.
---
I deadass think getting 5 golden legendaries in a normal pack are way higher chances than winning jackpot.
---
Considering one of Rafaam's strengths is the massive tempo he can gain from a Turn 2 Minion-Purchase + Hero Power, he's the kind of Hero that may be able to "stay on top" for so much of the game that a Health total decrease may not even be that effective when he just BS high-rolls.
---
So nerf the Hero Power.
---
Also, heroes start with 40 HP, not 30 HP.
---
how do you even get rewards on Reddit? Never got any myself.

All fantastic cards too, which you hardly see in multiple legend packs, congrats!
---
Let's do some quick math here:
---
You are guaranteed to open at least one legendary in your first ten packs from each set. Statistics have also shown that the average pack is worth ~100 dust, though this number is likely closer to 90 when legendaries aren't taken into consideration. 
---
100n (gold spent) ≈ 90n + 400 (dust recieved), where n is the number of packs opened
---
Even if it takes you all ten packs to get the guaranteed legendary, you'll still be getting a net of ~300 dust at that point, so I'd say it's a good deal if you're just in it for the dust.
---
I don't know how this compares to just buying packs for the new expansion, however.
---
yes, it's worth buying packs 1 by 1 until you hit that legendary.  it's more dust than you get buying standard stuff. That being said, do it after you get a decent DoD collection.
---
Isn't Invoke the new fraze as battelcray or deathrattle that does something? But you can only invoke Galakronds?
---
Sounds legit, with zero fact checking because I'm lazy.. You solved it
---
This one makes at least some sense
---
Battlegrounds is already huge bleeding wallet for blizzard since there is almost no cost associated with playing it.
---
I do believe that whizbang and battlegrounds are same in the eyes of execs.
---
There are neutral totems and demons too.
---
Was becoming Hi'reek part of your plan?
---
it say it right there available at rank 25
---
How do i get rank 25? You mean like.. level 25? 
---
Also the December pack.. aren’t we in December?
---
I have an insane amount of hatred for him in the battlegrounds... 
---
Me: Tier 5 and refreshing 10 times not finding Mal'ganis or ANY other demon when nobody else is running a demon comp
---
Him, at least 3 times in a single turn: YoU ShOuLd HiRe A MiNiOn WhIlE YoU CaN!
---
oh really thats sick! thanks for the tip
---
Also Thank you for your help
---
And it says right there you'll need to wait until later this december to open the other
---
My favourite is Murozond
---
will the pack from the arena be saviors of uldum or descent of dragons?
---
Dont go too mad about triplets. Its great but a lot of the times its better to keep 2x amalgam or 2x cobolt than get a triple and ruin your composition. A lot of people force it and its just a bad move many times.
---
If you want to increase your chance of triplets, you have to basically:
---
- roll
---
- luck out on Rafaam hero power
---
- use Brann+primalfin lookout
---
- keep yourself on a lower level / specific level so your pool of possible cards offered isnt too wide and you have a better chance of getting the cards you want.
---
- freeze your board rather than buy into a triple right ahead if you can level up + get the triple next turn, you will be offered a minion from a higher tier, giving you a better chance of getting a triple/better minion to go with other cards in your comp
---
Nothing else to do, its RNG.
---
I'd be fine with them coming back, as long as we won't see the jade mechanic coming back.
---
Oh okay. Do we have a specific date for later or not? Thank you
---
Noice
---
This is too confusing for me, please remove more deckslots
---
Someone hook up with MatPat
---
should be available at 2am aest
---
Madame Goya already shows up in Dalaran, which is even Warcraft Canon I believe. I´d love for the Gangs to return, Tri-class cards were really cool. Though I´d be surprised if they brought Kazakus back without a no-duplicate thing, and I´d be surprised if they printed another highlander enabler while Zephrys is still around. Between LoE and SoU(/DoD) were 4 years, so I wouldn´t expect they Gangs soon.
---
The date to open the pack is Dec. 10 but they don't release the update to open them till later that day.
---
so if i didnt buy the warrior hero yet, im out of luck ? well at least i got alleria and medivh
---
He made an Arena review a couple of days ago
---
No mech mage in standard, you will have to play Wild, which I don't sorry :(
---
Oh ok Thank you
---
Thank you
---
No, if you just play Standard, a Standard legendary will effectively be worth 1600 dust rather than 400. So opening \~4x the packs will break even on just the legends, while you're filling out the rest. Only do it if you're rushing towards some very specific.
---
I think the OP refers to the new solo content, and whether it will be worth saving gold for it. What we know is that the upcoming adventure of DoD will once again bring new cards into the game, and it's very likely they will shape the meta, so I think it's safe to say it will be worth buying it with gold. However, the adventure will probably not release before a month after expansion release today, so it will likely be enough if you safe a bit more than 2k gold until then.
---
I saved up about 3500gold. Most of it is reserved for the solo adventures. Wonder how many packs I can afford and will they be enough.
---
Go to play and then hit ranked you'll understand. Yes we are in December but they ment December 10th
---
The packs are locked until you reach Rank 25 in Ranked Mode. The idea being that this way you can play and Rank up against other people who only have access to the Basic and Classic cards and aren't completely stomped by tuned meta decks and by that same merit, can't do that to other people. It's a bit like how in other games you can't join the competitive mode until you've proven you have a decent grasp of the basics.
---
It depends how much of the classic set you have.  
---
Some noteable legends to craft are: Leeroy Jenkins (Classic), Zilliax (Boomsday), Kronx Dragonhoof (Dragons)
---
I think it's actually now the 10. December
---
Yes this interaction always worked like this. I couldn't think of an example from top of my mind, maybe someone can provide it.
---
This is the highest power level set we have seen so far. So you probably can't go wrong with just spending all your gold on DoD packs. Then don't spend any gold and save up until the next expansion drops. You will pick up classic packs along the way from tavern brawl
---
I literally built a Highlander Dragon Mage deck on HearthCollect, then logged onto Reddit and found this. And we don't call it Pure Paladin: We call it Paladin Paladin. You captures every card very well, and I feel the same way about most cards, except that you can combo Priest Galakrond with that "Battlecry: Summon all minions from your hand that didn't start in your deck". Also, how about Handlock now?? Other then those, very nicely thought out and very true
---
So you didn’t check what you were about to buy it’s the shop’s fault?
---
Also their first comment : "Are you the guy giving awards to everyone?" was a really sneaky thing as clearly they knew that wasn't the case
---
It is okay don’t worry! Nope I didn’t understand, I think a little miscommunication went between us.
---
We'll miss you 💜
---
i agree, its kinda greedy of blizzard to charge 30$ for them each when og players get them for free
---
Don’t think i’ve ever seen that many rewards on a post 😐
---
Don't do that.
---
MeddlingMage#2695 NA 80 gold quest exchange. You go first, I can show on request.
---
No dragon would befriend Togwaggle so he made his own
---
Given there are multiple posts about this on the front page I think people are complaining.
---
The boosting below 6.5 probably messes that up with enough time/games.
---
Just removing Toxfin out of the pool of murlocs available to Primalfin's discover would significantly improve the gameplay. It's fine to have 1 or 2 poisonous minions, but lately all I ever see at the top is a wall of poison with divine shields.
---
Yup meant the adventures that are up in the new shop, thanks!
---
Maple#21429 on NA. You go first.
---
Technically yes, but Hearthstone isn't picky like that. If it needs a requirement, it's always an "at least"-requirement. (Except if that requirement is 0/"no", like Mecha'thun or To My Side!)
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I couldn't start a new arena run just now (EU).

TIL I’m in the bottom 20%
---
i didn't even once said i want to get all the cards, ever since i played open beta i never even came close to getting all in expansion maybe except adventures. Yes as i said i am not super competitive but winning is obviously way more fun than losing, and i want to build deck with actual cards that i can have fun with and win. In this expansion there are some staple legendary cards that u can't build decks without, for example u cant build galakrond without 6 mana dude. As i said the problem is, i can not get any cards for a month and play game like a job not having fun and get 35 cards, or play game normally and not get these 35 cards which may change the game a lot and i will be left behind, as a result i don't have fun again. What's more, i like to build jank decks sometimes for example i built glinda highkeeper ra deck in doom in the tomb, in this expansion i won't get any of these luxuries. You have to understand that i am not like you, i can't just mindlessly grind and by no super competitive i mean i value fun over winning but i still want to win, i play like t2 decks which i enjoy mostly.

I'm consistently rank 2-4 with demons, but eventually get steamrolled by Megasaurs Murlocs. I'd still consider demons pretty good, at least as Jaraxxus or Nefarion.

and gives them more $$$

i think she will just give you a non-standard card.

ok boomer
---
Doesn't Whizzy give standard decks in wild? I agree with ATWindsor. That would defeat the purpose of Whizzy...
---
Nozdormu is insane? As in you would be insane to run it right?
---
You aren't seriously saying that card is amazing.
---
If you want a cheap 8/8 on turn 4, run the new Dragonmaw Poacher. Odds are most people will be running dragons.
---
really? haven't seen a single one and i am visiting here every day, guess they must have been downvoted by whales.
---
HAVE YOUU SEEN GALAKRON WARLOCK LVL 3 ...
---
I hope so, because damn it’s good social marketing
---
The power level of wild decks are often ludicrously higher than standard decks. Look at what N'zoth and evolve alone did to Standard.  
---
More power to you though, if playing at a disadvantage is fun to you.
---
or 4
---
Guess I will do that. Thank you!
---
1. For one more mana, you get a better version of the effect and two more health on the minion in question. For the decks that would want such an effect, Doomsayer is just better.
---
2. If a deck concept is capable of reaching tier two, why is that terrible?
---
3. If you want a four mana 8/8, just play Dragonmaw Poacher. The ten mana ramp for both players could do everything to lose you the game as it could win it.
---
4. Unreliable? If you're playing Galakrond Priest, you're playing at least six invoking effects, and by the time turn six or seven comes around, you should have seen enough of them to enable it.
---
5. Sure. It should be a good card, but I really wouldn't call it insane.
---
Wanna play sometimes and Trade quests ? Add Deniz#2162
---
Are you on a mobile device or a computer? I can't remember whether it cost that much when I bought it ages ago but I do remember it cost more on my iPad than on my laptop at the time. 
---
I do seem to recall it costing $25 (AUD) though so who knows. But that might just be how much it was in american dollars and I'm misremembering.
---
Only had to get to tier 5, had a 4 triples I think to get the 3 megasaurs. I pushed to tier 5 quicly as I just had heaps of murlocs so I needed poison/divine spirit to start winning.
---
Out of curiosity, I just went to check my bnet account transaction history to see how much it cost to purchase. The dollar value is not listed due to me purchasing through the apple store (which if I recall has an extra 'apple tax' applied), however what ever the purchase price then was only for wings 2-5 as wing 1 was free for quite a while (maybe until TGT was release?).  
---
It's entirely possible that the new price reflects the purchase of all wings, and also may be that there is a discount applied to the now current price if you had received the first wing free back at launch.  
---
Either way, I'm regret looking at my past transaction history on this game. Oof.
---
Incredible
---
*Add a random* ***Legendary*** *minion from Wild to your hand.*
---
It surprises me that people are complaining. Does nobody remember how much we loved the adventure format way back when? You got guaranteed cards for your gold instead of gambling on often shitty common-infested packs. And now you can disenchant the bad cards from adventures too! The same advice was given to literally every new player back during the Naxx/BRM times: buy the adventure wings with gold, they're worth it.
---
Which book is it?
---
The last adventure set was three years ago now. A lot has changed at Team 5 since then, and most of the discussion around Galakrond's Awakening is pure speculation anyway.
---
Even then, gold pay-outs have increased enough in the last couple months that you can spend everything on DoD packs day one and still have enough to almost buy the wings as they come out later on in Janurary.
---
If you play on a budget of at least twenty dollars an expansion, just save that money and spend it instead on Galakrond's Awakening like I will be.
---
Candles are a part of my religion
---
I can consistently go high legend and don't think I could be a successful streamer.  
---
Being good at the game is a bonus sure, but nobody is going to want to watch me silently play hearthstone. And I wouldn't want to put on an act whenever I'm playing.
---
As a Paladin player - im not having fun since they nerfed equality. I hope DoD bring some fun.
---
Its as if it fits the warlock theme :O
---
Hand Warlock, Mecha'thun Warlock, the upcoming Dragon Warlock, simply Control Warlock, and so on and so forth in addition to the decks you listed.
---
Got those already so don't know about those

Too bright to see play.

like my post says, often times you're only offered 1 star cards only when u upgrade
---
Istabfruit#1248 na 80g trade. I show then you go first
---
I have often been asked for early budget decks, and while I prefer my budget decks thoroughly tested, free Galakronds were just too good to pass up, so I wrote about them in some detail for Hearthstone Top Decks. I hope these decks will prove useful today!
---
Not really worth 100 gold considering that Galakrond is dropping soon.
---
Who has said that ever? Even when it first came put everyone knew murlocs potential with megasaur, the new murloc buffer gives them the ability to get there more consistent, no one said they were weak
---
No
---
very constructive feedback here
---
Thanks very much
---
ok
---
On T3 tavern your level up costs 3 gold and you have 5 available. I like to level up 100%, otherwise you are getting too behind. That gives you 2 gold, and keep in mind you likely have the extra minion from the previous hero power use. So you plenty of options, roll+hero power, sell a minion/token to straight up buy a minion, or whatever is best in that situation, but level up for sure. Anything beyond this point is impossible to pinpoint, too many variables.
---
That's absolutely amazing. Good job!
---
why would you think this is worth sharing?
---
It's better (unless you like losing potential gold).
---
I didn't said they were weak, but I always thought beasts were stronger... I was wrong
---
Welcome to Reddit. Take a seat at the front
---
Agree with this. Also looks like the coming expansion is incredibly powerful and therefore will likely dominate the metagame.
---
I'd say you're being silly, but considering he started doing this at the start of the release weeks window, and then finished just before the expansion actually comes out... I don't think it's too crazy to think it was a part of some marketing budget.
---
Ah, the launch. Getting a curator amalgam or lightfang. Those were the days.
---
This post about 200 but total $1000-2000
---
It depends on how good you are at Arena and how you feel about the slower pace of acquiring cards that comes with it.
---
Ideally, you want to have opened the vast majority of packs you open from a single set before you start crafting cards from that set, but you can't really do that with Arena if you want to start playing constructed when the meta starts to form.
---
A good compromise might be playing Arena the first couple weeks while the meta is being figured out, then switching to spending the rest of your gold on packs so you can start crafting. The only thing you lose out on there is being able to mess around with budget decks during the unsolved meta, but that's not everyone's cup of tea anyway.
---
Yee Ik i just play it for fun then I start meming till I it rank 20
---
&gt;Specifically so people spend more time playing Hearthstone then they would otherwise.  
---
if someone wants to complete a quest as fast as possible not being able to concede at 15hp just means they hit end turn a couple more times. if blizzard wanted quests to get people to spend more time playing hearthstone they wouldn't have changed them to ones that can be completed with much less time investment or even by just queueing and going afk. the changes to quests show pretty clearly that the only objective blizzard is concerned with them accomplishing is getting people to log in every day.
---
I have thought of HS as one of the greatest games of all time for years.  I still think so and am excited for the expansion.
---
Well, look, my point is that no one should have to deal with insane boards like this, but from my experience watching other players, the lategame boards in higher MMRs are generally stronger than in lower ones. Despite this, this is the strongest board I had ever seen, even after watching a lot of high-level Battlegrounds, and he didn't even have Divine Shield on his giant murlocs.
---
Reddit standard time. Gotta love it.
---
Well, maybe not everyone have that many gold and dust?
---
Finished editing the other. This one will be/is done properly before i submit :)
---
Bosses. (Basing this off hero power only bc i barely remember)
---
Naxx1- anub rekhan just summons minions. Faerlina is beaten by aggro. Maexxna could be fun, depending on what you want to beat her with
---
Naxx2- Noth is meh, he just gets free tempo.  Heigan makes you think about positioning a little.  Loatheb has upgraded hunter hero power, prob aggro
---
Brm 1. Grim guzzler is fun deckbuilding. Dark iron arena is just tempo. Thaurissan is a fun change of pace, especially the times you survive his hero power
---
Brm2 - garrs a change of pace, baron geddon you just aggro down. Majordomo/Rag is good fun, and the only 2 heroes fight
---
Conclusion- brm first two wings for bosses
---
On the app im pretty sure its just there as a worded event

2 years sound good. Can't wait !
---
Essentially it reminded me of “energy” mechanic from MTG except instead of spending the Red mana, there were cards that checked if you had them or not. So like one guy you'd play would say "Battle cry: turn one of your mana crystals Red" then another guy would read"If you have a Red mana crystal, Deal 2 damage" or "If you have 3 Red mana Crystals, do X" sort of thing. Essentially just doing a visual effect on your mana to keep track of what effects you're able to trigger on other cards. Mike says in the article the main reason they scrapped it is because it was hard to see on Mobile, as well as the fact that the payoff wasn't visible to the player other than the crystal turning a different color. For example, hand buff lets you see the upgraded stats right in your Hand. Jade stuff lets you see the upgraded Jades as you play them and you can see them grow each time. They wanted the Red mana stuff to fit the same vein as that but decided it didn't show the player enough payoff when you were playing them so they scrapped it.
---
I know what you mean by taunting boom bot, you can also leave egg untauntdd in preparation for Zapp, but the issue is when the taunts are dead and you're hoping kangors procs, you're in a 1/3 situation with baron and 2 kangors, that's extremely high risk and subject to a lot of variance also really sucks dick if it gets sniped immediately after taunts are down because you're 100% dead at that point and guaranteed to also take an exorbitant amount of dmg.
---
For that reason I think Deathrattle is B tier due to how inconsistent it is,at least mechs and murlocs aren't subject to one unit being totally vulnerable for such a period of time.
---
Of all the expansions *this* is the one you chose to boycott because of filler cards?
---
I do God's work lol.
---
Seriously flip the photo. His chest is a butt.
---
Yeah okay. I got to Legend multiple times, with both aggro, control and combo. The game has little strategy. But you can keep thinking that those few decisions you make are some huge strategic gameplay.
---
you cannot keep 2x Amalgam as Rafaam. Since at some point you will get an extra and it will ruin your comp.
---
Sure, and 10 pacific is the standard time, but who knows what's the timezone they heard it was in. You should specify what time you are talking about when talking about stuff like this.
---
Pretty sure a while back they implemented a system where you are not going to get a duplicate legendary until after you have collected all the legendaries from a given set
---
And which one is funnier to play? I never played any of them
---
Just how and why didn't you open a single pack for 2 years? do you just play arena?
---
Really? Deathwing looks gross. Like grima worm tongue in armor lol. I’d rather the hero be the actual dragon version of deathwing lol.
---
He has 5 attack with his Claw if you fully invoke him! Still not enough, though.
---
Its not possible because seeing what legendaries you got is just an animation, the cards are determined and picked as you launch the game, the only way this is possible is if you somehow got every legendary before getting the preorder ones, and rolled that 1/20 or however many legendaries their are
---
The golden version looks elusive by default
---
During her release they mentioned there will always be a "wild pool" that will be updated as things rotate. Her pool will always be from there, which makes sense. I don't think she needs to be changed, but her flavor does make sense to remain in standard.
---
you're complaining that you're no longer required to win 3 games to get 60 gold, just play 3 games? you shouldn't have any trouble simulating the old quest requirement then.
---
Your variance is super important to do the math. If you get 4 or 5 wins every time you'll get way less gold than if you go 7 wins and  2 wins every time. You just get way more gold for 7+ wins. With 3100 gold for arena, id imagine you actually get 60 or more arena runs. Which is over 60 packs. If you average 80 gold per run the effective cost is 70g. So you get 3100/70g= about 44 runs
---
There are some trolls in this sub that pretty much downvote everything. I wouldn't take it too personally.
---
Why preorder when you can just use the gigantic amount of dust to come?
---
What the hell happened here?
---
As Osborn pointed out. It’s important to get the most recent expansion. And each card pack set you open has a 100% chance to drop a legendary card with your 10nth pack opened. Most players recommend that you save gold after opening ten packs for the next expansion release as you will get the most out it.
---
I remember during the old gods card reveal stream, ben brode attributed ~60 other people when he was told great job on the expansion, no idea how accurate that was though
---
Honestly...Procrastination , was too lazy at 60 packs and it just kept getting worse. Today someone showed me a thing called auto key presser so I decided to open them and play ladder again.  Last ladder deck I played was maly rogue with necrium vials and otk pally with Uther and beardo
---
This person started giving every award to a bunch of posts
---
I don't think that's what a retcon means.
---
Makes sense, sounds like you might need to get one preorder per year, just to get the critical mass of dustable cards.
---
The League is the best one IMO
---
Good on you. I hate mods who sticky their own personal comments and ego because of it. It's a small thing but I appreciate you doing it!
---
To be fair, he is Swedish and his English is incredible for being a second language
---
An illusion?!  What are you hiding...?
---
Biggest problem, there’s so much text on the cards.  You really have to invest time studying the cards to become familiar.  It’s difficult to get a feel, in game, for what a card does just by glancing at it.
---
Sure, but he has 14 dmg on board and 6 if C'Thun is active meaning only two (one if super lucky) of the Disciples needs to hit face for lethal. Playing Shudder on this setup will most likely mean he loses most of his board making it a bad idea for now.
---
Yes, opinions are subjective.
---
slut dragon
---
So around 11 CST *sigh* I have been grinding out so hard to get free cards and all sorts of stuff and I have to wait another hour and 10 minutes lol
---
Exactly, nearly 100%.
---
The best art of the expansion is violet spellwing. Gonna craft it golden if I can, because it just looks so cool.
---
It’s an old meme, sir, but it checks out
---
Battlemaster is the only demon that can get a large health pool, and that's offset by how abysmal demon buffs are.
---
Close to release creating arena runs is disabled so if you already didnt start it might not work.
---
Wrong. It's 6 PM UK TIME, so 12 CST
---
Thanks for the biggest laugh of my day.. Well done.
---
My bad.
---
Noon Central Time.  So, 2 hrs from now.
---
Mindblown
---
With new rotations we adjust cards based on how we feel the meta will affect them. Example: Heavy taunt meta, heavy control meta, synergies, etc.   
---
This meta obviously being dragon focused, we've increased synergy cards slightly to reflect the anticipated meta. We've also made adjustments around taunts and deathrattles to name a few.  
---
You won't see sweeping changes in scores because predicting metas is not only difficult, but can be very misleading. Making large tier score adjustments would be confusing to the average player especially if proven inaccurate.
---
So, running through my thoughts/disagreements.
---
**Neutral**
---
Big Ol' Whelp: Azure Drake back in the day was a 74.  It might be lower, but considering the massive difference between a 4/4 and 5/5, I expected the Whelp to be mid 80s at least.
---
Fire Hawk: This card is consistently going to be a 5/3 or 6/3 on curve and through most of the mid-game.  I figured it would be around Frostrider levels (which has its own problem in the late-game as well).
---
Cobalt Spellkin: There are a lot of good one-mana spells, and even the bad ones are more bad because they're situational, so getting them out of a fairly statted body seems fine.  I had it near 80, but I thought it'd be at least around 70.
---
Wyrmrest Purifier: When I did the math, this card was on average a net positive.  If you assume that the average card in your deck is worth 60 points (there's disproportionately more bad cards than good/great, so if you took the best card each time it'd end up around 60), then anywhere from 50-70 is basically a wash, similar enough in power levels.  Using Druid as an example, the # of cards above a 70 is 28.  The # below 50 is 19.  So on average, you have a 60% chance of that card you Purify to be better than a neutral from your deck.  The RNG is a factor, but the effect screams net positive to me, enough to at least offset the RNG and make it average. 
---
**Druid**
---
Strength in Numbers: My logic behind it is, while it is extremely slow, the massive tempo swing (not to mention high-rolls) you create out of it is so strong that it overvalues the slowness by quite a bit.  On T5, if you play a 5/5 and draw a 4/5 with this, that's a 9 mana swing that is extremely hard to handle (see the old 5/5 Corridor Creeper or 4/4 Nerubian Prophet coming out at 0 mana creating a similar swing).  And, for a 1 mana card, I'm not investing all that much into the card for the effect, so even if it whiffs, I don't lose out on all that much.
---
Secure the Deck: Similar thoughts, for a 1 mana card that will reliably put 3 cards in my hand, I'm fine sacrificing tempo for the effect.  3 claws for 1 card is much better than 1 claw for one card.
---
Embiggen: Think you guys are massively off on this one.  Constructed decks with this card are already insanely strong, and even with the massive negatives it has (screwing up your curve if played too early, being a bad draw in the late-game, slowness to get the effect), I can't see this being anything but a great card, and I had it + Faceless Corrupter on my Will Get Nerfed list.
---
Ysera: I've come around a bit oon the card stewing about it, but I still think its just extremely slow.  Its 9 mana for an 8 mana body which does nothing the turn its played, and while the portals are fairly reliable (you've probably drawn half your deck at that point, so its maybe 50% chance to go off), there's a lot of medium and low-statted dragons it can summon.  I'm fine with a slow card being 1 mana, I'm much less fine when its 9 mana.
---
**Paladin**
---
Nozdormu: At its absolute worst, it's a 4 mana 8/8, which nets you 4 mana, and for half a turn gives your opponent 5 more mana than you (going from T5 to T10), so in the exchange you lose 1 mana for half a turn before the effect goes back into your favor.  And you can plan around it via mulligan and keeping heavy cards and such.  I can't see it being anything but great.
---
**Rogue**
---
Candlebreath: This seems high to me.  You're likely not going to have a dragon to proc this, and as Rogue you'd much rather play the dragon before proccing this.  The majority of time its just going to a much worse sprint.
---
Necrium Apothecary: Is the score under the assumption you're not going to get that many death rattles?  Cause I'd easily take the 2/5 body with a deathrattle over the extra card from a 3/2 (Elven Minstrel, rated a 75).
---
**Shaman**
---
Storm's Wrath: One of the things I always hated about SHaman was how I could generate large boards then end up do nothing with the boards.  I don't see this being anything but insane, maybe not Storm/Maelstrom levels, but high 70s at least.
---
Cumulo-Maximus: I assume this is based around Overload Awkwardness?  I compared it to Blazecaller (70 vs. this a 71), while being cheaper (5 vs. 7 mana) with a much easier to achieve effect (Being overloaded since your overload affects two turns).  The overload does make things awkward, but the card is just so strong when it goes off.
---
Nidhogg: Another card I see the upside vastly overshadowing the downside on.  With any semblence of board control you're getting 9 mana out of a 6 mana card, and possibly 13.  Plus with the split bodies, if you put this down with a taunt, your opponent needs at least 3 attacks to take out the eggs.  Could be me overvaluing the tempo upside vs. the card being mediocre if behind, but I love these swing cards.
---
**Warlock**
---
Rain of Fire: Warlocks have a ton of AoE, and Whirlwind in Warrior (more useful due to Enrage/Execute synergies) is only a 43 there.  This can go face, but I'm just curious this being over 50.
---
Abyssal Summoner: I guess I'm more bullish on hand size than other people with this.  To me its not all that hard to maintain a hand size of 5 with this card, especially with the tap.
---
Crazed Netherwing: How much is being bearish on dragons for the score on this card?  I would assume your assumptions are similar to what myself/The Lightforge came to on Dragons in the set (between 5-6 offered, realistically 3/deck, which in my experience was enough to justify picking Duskbreaker when it was in the 1st bucket), and Warlock has an easier time achieving synergies due to its hero power.  The Lightforge was real high on dragons but down on this because of Warlocks having too much AoE, so I'm more interested in how you came around to 74.
---
Damn bro that’s crazy but nobody asked
---
I really like that one too actually.
---
Don't open them. Try contacting support first. If it doesnt work you'll get some dust in retern i suppose
---
Blizzard *has* officially recognized the first ten pack pity timer.
---
Thanks
---
What's with the tangerines lol
---
Seconded.
---
Thanks!
---
That's my average bg opponent..
---
Idk I found the storyline a bit stale...bosses were pretty okay, but I liked Karazhan more (not in terms of cards, though). I liked that disco aesthetic and found the bosses more enjoyable
---
Large if accurate
---
Grats!
---
Yes, At least in my country. People likes to add fruit to piñatas (besides candy), and tangerines are one of the most common of the season.
---
Right now that’s the case more often than not; I think everyone in the games I played last night went Murlocs. My thought is to focus on out valuing them early game with or without an emphasis on Murlocs - I’ll take them if handed to me but I won’t waste many coins early on fishing for murlocs I just want the beefiest minions I can get. If you can build murlocs early great if not nbd you can still deny them marque pieces where you can (especially amalgam). I sometimes will buy toxifin or the shield mech even tho I know I can’t use it just to deny someone else of it. Your board will develop based on these decisions and mid to late game you can start focusing on higher octane synergy or tribes.
---
When the whole group is going murlocs they are fighting over resources (only so many in the pool since minions are shared) and these resources early on are not that strong so if you can ramp up your tavern quickly you stand a good chance at killing them (or they start killing each other) before they get those valuable poisons and shields. 
---
In the end, You only need to be top 4 - very important to  remember that as 4th place is still a win and just like any other card game some player might just “draw the nuts” and outright win 1st place but that doesn’t mean you lost.
---
The biggest problem to Rafaam is that you can delay the upgrade on turn 2 (take a minion + hero power instead), then leverage that tempo gain to ramp up to tier 5/6 incredibly fast while gaining desirable minions.
---
I'm adding Depth Charge to all the lists I have that are already running Doomsayer. In particular, I think it will shine in combo Mage decks that run Frost Nova, and combo Warlock decks that run Curse of Weakness.
---
If you play depth charge on an empty board, your opponent will probably not play minions. Thrn the following turn you can play doomsayer, then another depth charge... you can lock down the board for ages.
---
Why not check?
---
18 UTC. You can check the sidebar for this stuff.

Wow, this one works amazingly well in 3D. And the execution is super high-quality. As Mecha-Jaraxxus would say...**IMPRESSIVE**.

Yea

  I thought this was special hearthstoneflake, I want a half a win because I participated.  Why am I not being compensated playing the game?

---
This is amazing! I had been so confused about him that I avoided picking him even though everyone was saying he was top tier. Previously I had read things about staying low tier in purpose to amass tokens but this method makes way more sense!
---
While I get what you’re saying, the Deathknights didn’t have a set mechanic tied to them with multiple cards in the set based around them that do significantly less without a Deathknight in your deck
---
WaaAaAAH GolDeN common...
---
I love this reply, but Albatross shuffles two 1/1s, not three, so it's a 45% chance by Turn 10 (sample size 7), and a 35% chance by 8. Guessing that only half of games are still competitive by Turn 10, this becomes a 22.5 % chance that you'll delete a draw before you lose. And that's when you draw it on 3. The odds go down when you don't draw it on 3, pretty sure (yes, smaller deck, but fewer turns left in game).
---
So I don't think a 22.5 chance of deleting a card draw is worth the 99% chance of deleting a hero power for one turn, myself.. but I don't feel super strongly about it. Good to get these odds on paper! I technically know how to do this but rusty as hell.
---
Budget or overall? Out of the budget decks, I like Zoo the best. It does not have to make any significant compromises, unlike pretty much every other budget deck. I also like Rogue and Shaman.
---
Overall, I expect Shaman to be very strong. It has so many promising variants between Galakrond, Token, and Overload, that at least one of those should prove to be strong in any meta.
---
Evolution works in weird and mysterious ways
---
If you're absolutely never going to play wild in any way at all and u don't care to use those cards in single player content then yes you can dust them. No point in keeping them if you're never ever going to use them. However I'd be careful about it. As you may one day want to use those cards
---
It's not just that reason. [Zzeraku](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Zzeraku) is not only literally warped in, but he himself was warped by the energies released by Ner'zhul tearing apart Draenor through a hundred portals, as have been all Nether dragons.
---
He also has a very interesting story few know about, but let's just say he was involved in the creation of the Twilight Dragonflight, albeit against his own will, and is "indirectly" responsible for Malygos waging war against all mortal mages.
---
Did you go face?

Lol, in ros I burned my dust on res priest. I still cringe at the moment.

What if he spent the remainder of his money gilding people on reddit because he was going to die 😢

How is doing things like increasing daily quest rewards twice, changing the way packs work so there's a legendary card within the first ten packs and you can't open duplicate legendary cards, and generally being more open to pretty substantial launch of expansion bonuses being more greedy?

In Russia we eat tangerines in the christmas season.

Galakronds pirate aggro
---
do yourself and the meta a favor and don't watch streamers or go on deck building websites for like a week. I know you will anyways, but don't.
---
What server ?
---
No they cant do that because of money. In the expansion following descent, they’ll most likely add in a version of whizbang. I mean look at zayle shadow cloak for example.
---
Yeah but i cant, i dont have visa or paypal

I am not convinced those wings are sufficient to generate lift.

---
i'll trade you my quest for your quest. 160g for both
---
I can't wait for the dozens of comments and threads of people complaining about others not playing new cards as if everyone should have collected the entire set and have built brand new decks the day a new expansion comes out. /s
---
The art team is killing it this expansion, huge step up from Uldum imo. The warrior Galakrond, evasive feywing, Fate Weaver, etc. Top notch stuff 👌
---
The sun will rise in a few hours no matter where you live. The sun isn't close to its death currently.
---
For the last few weeks what this has led to is me rerolling to try and get my classes to align, and once I have 3 full quests going into casual or Tavern Brawl and AFKing for 3 games to quickly bank my gold and get back to battlegrounds.
---
In fairness that was down to evolve more than anything else, and I'm sure I'll complete my quests in an appropriate way now that standard is playable again
---
You need Divine Shield for the ‘poisonous mirror’. Technically, if your murlocs are large enough (which Bagurgle certainly helps), you don’t even need Poisonous to beat opposing comps. 
---
So, Divine Shield is actually the important one (which is why Nefarian is so good, as ripping off Divine Shields in the Murloc match-up is insane).
---
It just a visual bug
---
I admitted that I was bitter about being told he would be available early and by Blizzard screwing up and not allowing me to play him all the way up until expansion.  But yes, no big deal, first world problems.
---
correct me if im wrong but i think u/builderbob93 is saying the pack reset is not every 40 packs on a cycle. It is every 40 packs \*after opening a legendary\*
---
Where?
---
Well congrats for you then, enjoy!

My first guess it's russian art, because tangerines is thing here at New Year.

Not everyone is a deckbuilder, and not everyone can afford to experiment. Some people want to see deck ideas from players who *are* better at that sort of thing so they're not just stumbling around in the dark.

32 packs 4 legendaries 1 of them being golden so sick !!

Untrue. I started a run on Saturday, played to two losses, and got my rewards this morning.

Unlucky dude, at least you have dust? That’s a good trade off right?.. RIGHT...?
---
108 packs, 8 legs. Did they increase the drop rate or something?
---
Wtf i got 3 in 81...
---
Yeah, and I tried it on my Mac and get the same useless Exit Game button.
---
I opened 56 packs and only got 2 legendaries.
---
My friend opened 106 packs and got only 4 legendaries.
---
This has been the worst pack opening for both of us. Did they nerf the drop rates? I'm missing a quite a lot of commons and rares also, more than usual.
---
So, how far away is a full golden collection?
---
Right because we have oranges 24/7 now. But in the 50s it wasn't that way.
---
Well, I opened 169 packs and recieved: 10 legendaries, one of which is a golden Deathwing, Mad Aspect....but I don't play warrior

Hehehe thanks :)

*But yes you can probably buy it with gold as well
---
Same! idk how to buy heroes on mobile.
---
Got a good amount of legendaries (6 out of 93 packs) but all the worst ones, which is too bad but could be worse. And yes, I got **Shuma** first, but at least it is not my Golden from the pre-order.

I think all of EU are shut out.

dunno about mobile dude, just wanted to post this, hope someone helps you.

Have the same issue tried everything re-logging 20 times, uninstalling and reinstalling, launching on mobile and pc, waiting for 30 minutes. Nothing worked submitted a  ticket but it seems hopeless.
---
I opened 125 and got 6 legs. Fuck.
---
On NA, haven't seen anything about them having issues.

I opened 6 and got 2 legendaries from one pack, both pretty shitty tho veranus and kaahrij. Not disappointed tho
---
Where did this bingo card come from?

Hunter will continue to have an extra skin available to it for anyone who wants it as it has for the last several years. Meanwhile Rogue might as well have never had a skin in the first place for anyone who started after The Witchwood.

Agreed. Sad I set the afternoon aside for this.

Close your battle net and restart HS a few times. Worked for me
---
Otherwise there are steps to follow on the blizzard forum
---
I just opened a Goru, and was a bit disappointed because I've been discenchanting my tree cards.  Then, next pack, I got a Golden Alextrasza!!!! And this is all from my free packs.    I'm not even upset I have less than 1000 gold to spend.

Damn!

1. Nobody “mains” a class in Hearthstone. Play whatever you feel like.

2. The new expansion dropped literally 43 minutes ago. Nobody has any suggestions. Play whatever you feel like.

120 packs 6 legendaries, but included Frizz and Alexstraza. 
---
Crafting two legendaries (Maly and the Galakrond tutor) let me build Highlander mage, and Galakrond shaman and priest. Also got my embiggens, but resisted the urge to craft new Ysera.
---
Happy playing everyone!
---
How old are you? Thinking rank 20 is mid rank and not knowing what the Qs are would make me think you’re somewhere around 13 maybe?
---
I didn't state anything like that, read again the comment...
---
I just say the card is OK while drawing 2 cards and afwul just using it for drawing once... And the point its that that combo it is awful just to drop a 7/5 that you need to draw and (kill or cheat the Deathrattle) and the draw and play stawaway before u draw the candle. Just losing a lot of resources whit a really bad tempo to achieve so little so go read again.
---
Well, I just did it, I was using my touchpad on laptop and didn't notice that I bought uldum ones. No way I can change them, right?
---
They’re updated for me. I’ve been using Whizbang and playing with all the new cards.
---
You got more Legendaries then me and I opened 125 packs...
---
winning no divine shield, did you rank up all the way to 3k?
---
You have to hold down the button for like 2 seconds
---
Are you Internet Explorer?
---
Wow I'm sorry did that just say malygos "absorbed them" wtf
---
is it always 5 mana as well?
---
It's better in the case where you buff it up then faceless it on the next turn though.
---
Yes, that is well above the curve!
---
Good idea... But... It's winter vale. I got my Christmas lights all up on my card back.
---
Playing her now and yeah it's the same for me.
---
They've said in the past they don't want to because of how keywording it would obscure the distinction of who can target it and with what, especially if they print more cards like Shimmering Courser down the road.
---
Yeah everything you get is 5mana
---
So just a completely different game mode?
---
Me neither
---
132 packs, 100 from preorder.  23 from gold, rest from freebies.
---
7 Legendary (I kinda wanted Deathwing, I'll have to craft him).
---
25 epics.
---
Shit ton of rare and common duplicates.
---
I could have sworn this was already possible? Or only on iOS?
---
Kronx looks awesome though. And if you already have Galakrond his abilities will be golden!
---
Wow did they really give you 3 legendaries for 110 packs?
---
"You can run, but you can't hide. I'll find you, even in your deck." -Firebat
---
Seems you made a real difference to this wee sub. Godspeed to you, Whizbang. You truly were wonderful.
---
I really wish they would add dupes protection after a certain point
---
130 packs, 12 legendaries (1 golden alex from preorder) and 3400 dust
---
Not sure if you can make an exact deck with those cards without crafting more legendaries but you could always try budget versions. For galarond shaman I imagine you need the battlecry quest. But since it's a new expansion no one knows which deck is the best for sure yet. I would just play whatever then wait  2 weeks before making a decision
---
Wow those are good ones! I crafted golden Alex just now so I don't get a normal one and regret not having golden. Ysera is probably my 2nd choice after looking at them
---
Lmao dude the expansion just came out. Tiers won’t be settled for a couple weeks with this new amount of material.

27 packs, 1 legend, and 2 epics. FML.
---
Legendary was the Druid treant guy.
---
How keywording will obscure anything? For the sake of reducing those 2 lines into one keyword and there's the visual effects also.
---
Something belonging to Pirate Warrior or Pirate Rogue
---
Idk I mean it happens a bit too often, I'd like to see more rates sprinkled in. Usually it's 4 commons and one not common lol
---
Opened 65 packs and only got two legendaries including the one you get in the first ten. First and last time I bought packs for sure.
---
"Play X games" is great, but I've learned that you shouldn't play aggro decks for that quest. The last one I did I had to play 5 full games for it to count my 3 games played, because the others were over too quickly.
---
Needs more Jade Golems /s
---
Bro that’s cool but I didn’t ask
---
*  Mindflayer Kaahrj 
---
*  Valdris Felgorge 
---
*  Golden Ancharrr 
---
Those three are all great legendary cards
---
Got malygos. Was hoping for murozond for wild tog priest
---
I got Deathwing and Frizz, as well as opening Zzeraku.
---
Have you got a list anywhere?
---
Probably just lucky.
---
For me it was K&amp;C
---
Did I understand you? The Hero Power is not animated, is it? This happens every time when Blizzard release a new hero... it will be fixed in a week, I hope.
---
There are definitely more than 5 bad results.
---
but on the other side a streamer did the analysis and said it's roughly around 50-60% chance to pull a favorable or profitable outcome.
---
But it was literally the only card back anyone had for a while so I hate it now, ha.
---
Once you get all legendaries for an expansion you can get duplicates.... you don't just stop opening legendaries once you get them all....
---
Lackey
---
Just needs Patches
---
I don’t want to make your day any worse... but I’ve been invoking allll day.
---
Same here, the rope never came so I restarted the game just in time to watch my opponent kill me
---
Twice now, my game has broken when someone played galakrond. It's broken right now, and it was a priest galakrond, but last time it was mage.
---
You can tell he's a pathological liar because Tupac isn't actually dead
---
60 Packs from Pre-Order, 62 more bought with gold
---
* Goru (free golden)
---
* 6 legendary (Ysera, Chenvaala, Alex, Waxdred, Bandersmosh, Kaahrj)
---
* 26 Epic
---
The pack opening gods were not smiling upon me today
---
By moving the text from the board to a tooltip reminder. It sounds silly to people who have played the game for years or know it inside and out, but Hearthstone is built around casual simplicity, and keywording an ability that doesn't work the way new players might assume it does or which could work ever so slightly differently from another *version* of that ability can obscure its effect.
---
There isn't much to gain from keywording it anyway. They've even had effects grant that exact ability.
---
I opened 160 and got 15
---
They managed to make a Pirate Warrior more oppresively retarded than the patches version. 
---
This deck is so absolute trashly designed and forced I cant believe people play, let alone pay money for this game. I tried to play hstone again after almost a year of not playing and holy shit. At rank 15, 5 Pirate Warriors in a row and even with Reno mage with clears and zephrys and 20 heal I still have no chance. They deal 12 damage per turn with just weapon.. 
---
And there is no counter play. You cant destroy their weapons because they have a 4 mana 4/2 equip a destroyed weapon. Cant play a taunt divine shield because they have a 2 mana 2/1 silence a taunt (how absurd is that?). 
---
I feel sad for anyone playing this sad game.
---
There seem to be a large amount of glitches with Galakrond currently.
---
And as [I've already pointed out elsewhere,](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e89p7e/with_the_release_of_dod_there_will_be_more/faa36j6/?context=3) that's not actually much of an issue because:
---
1. New players can quickly learn what Evasive means after one or two plays.
---
2. There are already "loopholes" in existing keywords like Taunt, which has to be targeted by attackers but not by Battlecries or Spells.
---
It's not an argument whatsoever against Evasive being a keyword.
---
no, you are just lucky!
---
Imagine it in Caverns rogue...
---
Unfortunately, your submission was removed because it is a pack opening.  
---
All pack opening submissions should be added to the [Pullsday Thursday pack opening threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=Pullsday+Thursday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).  
---
They are stickied to the the subreddit every Thursday and allow you to show off your crazy or unlucky pack openings.  
---
Yup, nothing worse than getting a triple with 5 seconds left on a phone and having to freeze the board because you dont have time to wait for the animation and play it. I've lost several top 3 or top 4 games because I got that badly needed triple with 5+ seconds left and had a golden sitting in my hand when the match started.
---
no way, bronze gatekeeper is.
---
At least this expansion comes with 5x free Galakrond legendary cards. Even if it does suck that RNG bit you this time!
---
eyy got same :)
---
It's all about luck, I just saw a pack opening with 5 legendaries in 166 packs
---
I’m at 4 legendaries in 84 packs (which given that a legendary is guaranteed in the first 10 packs is a bit below average; average would be like 5 legendaries).  So...no.
---
I still see a lot of players have it probably unaware they do lol
---
Yeah, for arena to me it looked like Walking Fountain for 2 less.
---
&gt;Rewards that encourage playing, not just playing
---
Sry hs. You're a bit late on this feature. Should've added it 5 years ago when we first asked. Why would I go back to hs when there are so many other great games out there. Halo reach only costs $10 on pc with all dlc content free. full campaign, huge multiplayer, so much customization stuff it's not even funny, literally thousansd of unique gamemodes, mod support coming ect. what does $10 get you in hs? 10 pack of witch you will probably only get a dozen or so cards that are really playable. the hs hype train has come...and gone to the freking moon
---
Especially if I Heart of Vir'naal first
---
I like it as well. I am curious though. Does anyone else just q up and let the game idle in the background to complete the play quests? I imagine I'll be playing standard a lot more now that the xpac has dropped, but when all I cared about was battlegrounds I did this a lot and just tabbed out and would check it 30 minutes later.
---
It s funny reading that u are missing stormhammer e scion of ruin cause, out of 188 packs, those are the only couple of class epic i found xD (80% of my epics were neutral .-. Multi multi multi copies of neutral epic)
---
Kind of except it's always a 5 mana 5/5, as opposed to Zerus who's cost and stats would change to macth the actual card
---
MTGA is so much better than hearthstone its not even funny, even f2p model is better than hearthstone and these guys are thought of to be greedy, learning doesn't really take that much time if u got above 80 iq really. I bet in 20 games u can play decently magic and understand all the keywords.

---
79 packs and 7 legendaries. As a f2p, this makes me pretty happy!
---
I don't recall Leeroy ever being run in Priest, but I'd surely play a deck like this is if it's ever successful. Leeroy is the coolest card ever despite being such simple design.
---
Shaman rocks ty
---
it sure makes playing my jank decks less fun...It would be nice to have an even playing field.
---
I opened 10 packs and got a legendary card. His name is galacronkd and hes my favorite card.
---
I've opened a whole 13 packs so far so the best I can do is a janky Galakrond quest shaman that, in a few games, you'd never know there were new cards in it.
---
Found your YouTube channel like a week ago, and you're the first person that got me interested in wild lol. Just wanted to say that your videos are awesome and keep up the great work!
---
Wait, they really have a 2/1 silence a taunt? Which card is that?
---
I love him as a card in general, even without the hilariously goofy art.
---
Yes, he is busted. But he's also a busted Midrange option, and Midrange nearly always thrives *only* when you have insane cards like this to support it. And Midrange is one of my favourite decktypes to play in hearthstone, the back-and-forth of it.
---
Descent of Dragons seems to be "Fight broken stuff with broken stuff," and while it's almost inevitable that something will come out more broken than another and may end up feeling toxic, crappy, or woefully boring to play against, I have to say I'm having a ball right now trying a variety of decks, even if a lot of them include this Big Card Draw Boi and Evasive Wyrm. They're super strong and we've seen how bad ubiquitous neutral cards can be (Sludge Belcher, Piloted Shredder, Dr. Boom, and Big Ol' Whelp's weaker, older cousin Azure Drake all say hello)... but when there are such powerful class themes running in different Galakrond decks, Highlander decks, and anything other you can look at (Pirate Warrior, Rush subtype in Hunter, Battlecry Shaman, Pure Paladin^(which I don't think is that good), Spellslinger Mage, etc)... I have to say that it is really appealing when you just have a powerful guy like this to help facilitate so many of them.
---
I just had [this game](https://imgur.com/FwjEzUH) with a "Dragon Warloke" deck, which I don't expect at all to be good enough as the meta settles. Look at the history tab: the opponent just played Alexstrasza into a 0 Mana Kalecgoes into a 0 Mana Blizzard into a 0 Mana Nozari. On Turn 9.
---
And yet, I counter with a fully Invoked Galakrond giving me that big board, and I'm able to clear the Alexstrasza with a weapon swing + Nether Breath. Damn.
---
(If people are curious to know how things ended: they used a 0 Mana Puzzle Box the next turn and drew their entire deck from Myra's. RIP)
---
So yeah, lots of fun with this expansion so far. I love powerful Midrange options, and while I would never have advocated for the printing of Big Ol' Whelp previously, its in a card set where its power level is the norm.
---
I really hope this is a joke, just in case its not: The card literally says: Draw a card...
---
7 legendaries 130 packs oh and pirate warrior is op
---
50/50 it either happens or it doesn't
---
Grow up, hearthstone has 0 relations to WoW lore, other than using it’s characters ...
---
Yeah, especially since the current plan is to have the same Winterveil cardback as last year...
---
I upload mine deck I’m using for now
---
Preorder goldens were Frizz and Shuma, and I got three in my pack openings, both rogue class legendary and Kronx.
---
I made my own, but need to revise it. I had an overload subtheme but decided to go full Galakrond quest. That's not to say the overload package is bad, you just really want to commit, it think.
---
There's nothing you can do about it. It's the nature of card games.
---
Me and my fiancee opened 51 packs each.
---
I got 3 legendaries: Nithogg, Golden Nozdormu and Zzeraku.
---
She got 4 legendaries: Dragonrider Talritha, Golden Moruzond, Nozdormu and Golden Alexstrasza.
---
Kinda happy this round!
---
188 packs ... 10 leggs: kronx, shuma, veranus, waxadred, malygos, deathwing, nithogg, mindflayer kaarj, YAAANCHARRR, Goru. Tbh i got almost alla the legg i wanted and i didnt get ones i disliked (exactly the opposite of Savior of Uldum) 
---
Fun fact: out of all epics i found, 80% were neutral ones. I got multi multi multi copies of all neutral epics D: (+ 2 scion of ruin, 2 stormhammer and all the druid epics)
---
ily solem
---
That's absolutely hilarious
---
Does Executus do anything with armor or is that up to the player to remove it before this otk can work
---
Calm down
---
There are other ways to deck yourself — Myra’s unstable element, draw shenanigans, “remove all cards from your deck that X” effects...
---
Close it fully then reopen it quickly like shut it down
---
Nothing is more frustrating that duplicate epics?
---
Imagine being a free to player who can only open a limited amount of packs on day one.  
---
Making a realistic wish list of which class's cards you want to open the most of.  
---
Every expansion, without fail, you always open the most cards from your least favorite, least played class... with your favorite class always getting the fewest cards, forcing you to use your minimal dust on getting even the common cards from said favorite class because disenchant dust ratio is gross in this game.
---
Imagine that.
---
That's my life every expansion.
---
I bought her so haha fuck you.
---
I would like to see your list :)
---
Cry me a river. If you give so much weight to the opinion of a streamer, maybe you should just stop watching. I agree that it is kind of an entitled opinion, but he is not wrong. If you wanna play against new cards, old decks just aren't as fun.
---
Sweet, now we don't have to do this ever again
---
funny story, i couldn't figure out how to do the multi-purchase on PC this morning because of the icons being in a new location
---
Yes, i have an image posted here:

---
Idk where else. But mandarins can only be bought around Christmas time in Canada. It's become a Christmas thing like eggnog.
---
I did open the pack and did receive those heroes so this much be a glitch. It’s nowhere to be found.
---
Well, it's the one Team 5 uses, so that's ultimately all that matters.
---
double tap on the 1 pack 100 gold icon on the top left
---
How do you even manage to make a website that slow in 2019
---
Because thats what he does
---
Maybe but from my experience cyclone mage game should either end quick and if you dont end it quick, not even that herobpower can save you
---
We found out we are getting attacked, it's not just "the normal traffic" we get from here, fixing this is actually not that easy. Messaged the mods tho to unsticky it till we fix the problem.
---
The argument Team 5 *used* before they shoved the term "Evasive" down our throat.
---
Fun fact: if you give a Charge minion Charge, it can no longer Charge.
---
I got one legendary the dragon that puts 7 portals that summon random dragons 🐉
---
I just think it’s silly how it counters my deck so hard that it’s basically impossible to win.
---
If you opened 58 packs of a new set, you would have at least two legendaries.
---
Also, why not open the rest before complaining about it? I had a streak of 38 packs with no legendary today but ended up opening the average number expected once I opened all of them.
---
The website getting currently attacked and we can't really do anything about it, we will get this post updated tho!
---
What a woot pack¿
---
The website getting currently attacked and we can't really do anything about it, msged the mods tho to unsticky this.
---
Thanks, your videos and streams have always been great.
---
Can you do another Treant Druid for #teamtrees, or play the Obelisk Priest combo with Grave Rune? Sorry for asking.
---
Same here.  Priest Galakrond crashed my game, had to disconnect because I was stuck forever.
---
maybe you can destroy all zombeasts including the ones in your opponents hand
---
The website getting currently attacked and we can't really do anything about it.
---
It's one card in their deck. And it's not like we're in some refined meta. You're making extreme assumptions off one bad game.
---
He’s pretty good tho
---
Na all good here. 200 packs opened and all legendaries pulled. Never been this lucky. Also gone from rank 8 to rank 5 so happy today
---
Opened 260 packs, 160 from preorder, 40 from gold, 60 from more money spent.
---
The list of legendaries I got is below: (in pull order)
---
descent of dragons legendaries:
---
preorder:
---
golden veranus
---
golden valdris felgorge
---
packs:
---
zzeraku the warped
---
golden murozond the infinite
---
shu’ma
---
kronx dragonhoof
---
dragonqueen alexstraza
---
dragonrider talritha
---
flik skyshiv
---
ancharrr
---
dragonbane
---
golden nithogg
---
goru the mightree
---
golden ysera unleashed
---
nozdormu the timeless
---
malygos, aspect of magic
---
frizz kindleroost
---
waxadred
---
I'm guessing it doesn't have enough data for the new set.
---
It’s infinite waxadreds though. Isn’t infinite anything a bad sign?
---
You got DC’d. Playing Galakrond while you’re already Galakrond will DC your opponent. It’s a bug that’s been known since the fireside gathering.
---
Just play arena instead of buying packs, You can get like 350 gold worth of rewards, thats 200 gold profit, it's easy to keep up if you keep playing, like every game
---
Yea, that hits pretty hard. But for me the best card(s) so far are the shaman invoke cards. You just clear everything until the dragon comes out and you win the game.
---
[r/doggohate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/doggohate/) on the other hand...
---
Not that broken just cause they attack first
---
Anyone know how to open decent of dragon pack on mobile?
---
you have to wait a few days
