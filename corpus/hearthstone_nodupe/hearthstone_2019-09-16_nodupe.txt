&gt; there are too much cancer card

---
Such as?
---
---
---
Or SOME dragon archetype.  Sad that there hasn't been an effective one in the year of the dragon.
---
I usually didn't have much trouble with priest. Avoid littering your deck with bad cards is probably the best bet to start. Other than that, I always went with Dragon priest and did fine.
---
I consider mage to be the hardest without cheesing it.
---
Dragon Warrior is playable.
---
Turn one minion on each side into The Collector: eat a nut. After eating one of each nut Add Soul Collector to hand. All other minions become types of nuts. Each different but having and effect, lifesteal, reborn, windfury, etc.
---
Soul Collector: he runs in front of your opponents car, they die, you win. Squirrels are evil.
---
Whoa. My time has come.
---
Wild. Ironically I liked secret mage more when it was more burn cards and an underdog deck. I could rank up quick with it against most decks that didn't get a good start. I'm trying to figure out the right Even Warlock build for the meta at rank 9 because I'm really treading water against all the Reno Decks.
---
I haven't played Standard in a few months since I discovered Wild, and I have had crap luck with my packs from the newest set so I can't build many of the fun looking decks.
---
I like Arena, but I suck at it, so it's just more economical to use my gold and cash on packs.
---
I think people were fatigued from playing the same RoS deck of bomb warrior eventhough it is still quite good. I have matched against a couple of bomb warriors recently with my highlander hunter and felt absolutely neutered.
---
There’s no way you’d make this play if you hadn’t tested it before, as risking your entire game in Zephrys giving you what you need in a fairly vague situation is not gonna happen in a tournament setting. The practice and preparation put in really shows here.
---
Lots of the same combo deck showing up for priest.  Makes sense, if it works, why not play it?
---
Also wow that's a lot of Snipsnaps.
---
How am I the one getting downvoted? Do people on this sub understand basic math and logic?
---
He said blizzard ruined rogue based on op's ranking that states that rogue has 46.1% winrate.
---
On the exact same website, all rogue lists but 3 has above 50% winrate. For this to happen, it means the lists that have below 50% winrate must have too small a sample size. And this guy is arguing that even 400 games is not enough. How does that help his argument?
---
Aside from that, every single class has decks with even worse winrate. When you evaluate the strength of a class, you look at their strongest decks, not their weakest ones because there will always be people who play bad meme decks for fun.
---
It's not even about the downvotes. It bothers me how bad people are at arguing and interpretting these winrate stats and making these terrible conclusion.
---
&gt; I really want a thief priest core set lol
---
Oooh, that would bring a LOT of complaints, maybe more than the DS/IF combo.  Thief priest is one of those decks that people hate losing to.
---
Sort of like complaints about the 'discovered by' meta, but so much worse.
---
I meant that the best-performing version is literally tempo rogue with quest and 2 clever disguises. Tempo Rogue already played Vendetta. And if youre running underbelly fence and Tess, youre running the all-in quest version. Which performs significantly worse than the version Im talking about. And that specific all-in version is an easy tier 4 at best deck. Its the one that has losing matchups to everything.

You don’t have to do this, just put the card down and we can talk about this
---
I love rogue more than any other class, it's my most played one by far (my next 4 most played classes don't add up to the games i have with rogue) , it's not ruined. It is not as strong as it was for sure, but rogue has been strong for the longest time and more consistently than any other class, it's ok for valeera to be weaker for an expansion or 2
---
Have you tried submitting an appeal though? I agree It doesn’t make sense that you’d get banned because blizzard’s card says ‘not less than 1’ but they didn’t actually make it that way, but it is still exploiting the function for the combo.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/166944
---
It’s so much more fun picturing the Deep Ones as Murlocs now. Reading Shadow Over Insmouth again, and all I can hear is mrglglglglglglglglgl in my head lol
---
Hasn't Wild had a huge issue with people using macros and/or bots to play more sn1ps than the client would normally allow?
---
This is getting out of hand. Now there are two of them!
---
You generally pair it with Azalina Soulthief to get a copy of the swap card, so if they swap, you just swap again.

I'm surprised there is so much love for a cheater. There is no way you didn't know what you were doing was wrong, now you need to pay the price.
---
Blizzard cs is actually really good. If you have a legit grievance, it often is resolved.
---
But, there are lots of people who cheat and cry about it once they are caught and banned. Everytime, for example, blizzard puts out a ban wave for people who bot in battlegrounds, there is a huge amount of posts in forums of very angry people who insult blizzard, when it turns out they actually were deserving of it.
---
fuck you blizzard  
---
Sayounara.
---
Grats man!
---
It's an exploit and is against ToS.
---
I've done the same thing but with Shaman decks
---
Are you guys looking at nerfing the combo?  It’s not a very fun deck to play against. No other combo deck can kill you turn 6 nearly as consistently.
---
Sarcasm.
---
For a priest specific keyword, do you think something to do with not attacking could work? Not sure what kind of effect would work there but it's something that hasn't been implemented before.
---
Perfect XD
---
That’s a terrible example. When your license is revoked/suspended, your car still belongs to you to do with as you please.
---
Then shuffle all minion tribes randomly so Murlocs become Mechs...etc
---
This reminds of Pokemon, pre-2017 VGC. Having a Your Turn timer and all actions happening in your turn is so much better and fun to see now.
---
FUCK
---
Snip-snap was a mistake
---
Terrible example, you can sell the card if your license is revoked.
---
So blizzards response should be to fix it, not ban him.
---
The guy above was being sarcastic. 2 games is in no way of proving innocence but I don't want to come off as someone who's already made a verdict on the OP. I'd like to see how this pans out.
---
The other reply is wrong, people have figured out an upper "APM limit" so to speak for how many SN1P-SN4Ps you can play in a single turn and his vastly exceeds that, what CNBattleWolf uses is a modifier to the game that removes summon animations (which is what limits the SN1P-SN4P combo) and allows him to build, like, 70 of them in a turn.
---
OP is pretty much at that humanly APM limit and shouldn't have been punished, at the very least not while CNBattleWolf isn't.
---
Is that even that efficient?  Let's say someone cheats using program XXL33THAXXX, they know that the program was detected.  That's really the only reason for the ban.  And it's not like bliz would give specifics on the program beyond "You were using this".  
---
It's obvious that they got banned for the cheating program, but not how the program was detected.  But Blizz doesn't need to add any info like that into things.
---
&gt; Playing as many echo cards as you mechanically can is the whole point of the card.
---
I think the 'whole point of the card' from a design standpoint would be playing as many as you have the mana to afford. Hearthstone is a card game, not an action shooter, so I don't know why "card with echo for 0 mana" is even something that's allowed to exist.
---
Here is a twitch VOD that captures what OP is referencing when he says "Extended time bug" https://www.twitch.tv/videos/477567142?t=02h35m26s 
---
It is an extra lengthly turn that occurs when your opponent has played an excessive amounts of cards prior. Hiddenpants the player in the VOD stops at 28 because he's confused and don't want to play into the nonsense of his opponent "CNBattleWolf" a notorious cheater.
---
I only play arena, doesn't bother me. I enjoy it fine enough.
---
Transform all minions in both players' hands into Tinkmaster Overspark.
---
&gt;If you really didn’t cheat and use other methods to slow/stop the animations, then you shouldn’t be banned
---
So just to clarify what *do* you consider cheating then?
---
But why? Fuck supporting these guys if they will just shit on you
---
&gt; Even if he was legitimately cheating by using mods or whatever, I think a permanent ban is excessive especially if it's a first time offense.
---
Is it? Is it really? What do you expect to happen when you make the decision to install hacks for an online game?
---
Oh yeah! Very good point!

Not just not focusing, but literally competing in another game tournament at the same time.

He was on stage competing in a professional tournament, and yet he chose to play another game at the same time.
---
I'd say it's bad play from Seiko and Blizzard; Seiko for trying to juggle two tournaments simultaneously, and blizzard for not caring about a player in a live tournament playing another game.
---

/legal
---
There are many other subreddits that would better serve your drama needs.
---
Well I disagree for the following reasons
---
Absolutely none are, as playermovement and action while possible to restrict by server, still leaves room for unfair advantage. However lacking all restrictions like in this case is bad gamedesing: you shouldn't be able to send and get trought actions to the server faster than what is restricted on clientside.
---
It's a case of bad desing not because any exploit is possible, but because in this case possible.
---
God Blizzard in the second half of this decade has just been a treat. Fantastic.
---
Seriously though, sorry to hear. One of the most frustrating things these people do, whoever is in charge of banning and then responsing to support tickets regarding bans, is just completely shut you out and deny you the basic fucking knowledge of what you did wrong. I dunno who the issue is but it feels weird. Almost like an abuse of power. Like, wouldn't most people who work on a game see the benefit in people having the opportunity to learn from their mistakes? Guess it doesn't hurt their bottom line though. Hopefully soon we can get the gaming industry to a place where we as consumers force accountability in situations like this.
---
Blizzard is well known for being pieces of shit what else do you want?
---
Hey buddy seems like not a lot of people here to cheer with you but big congratz (: hope u can dig more of them 12 wins
---
You think you don’t need them, until you see a cool deck with them in it. It’s your choice at the end of the day but from personal experience I have regretted dusting legendaries so many times.
---
Stay with it. Don't come back. I did the same with league of legends and now I earn 3k in a month because I have some more free time.

"Lets kill mech hunter because of a combo deck !"

They could just make it so it maxes at 3 uses for the game...
---
Saw a quick video of this garbage. Reminded exactly why I quit Blizzard games.
---
Congrats, next goal is the 12-0.
---
Lol this is my roommate no joke
---
Well if you modify the client so you can skip animations and play more cards faster that's a pretty clear cut TOS violation **and** cheating.
---
You can argue Blizzard should add hard time limits and not rely on client side animations to balance pacing of "unlimited" combos, but either way it's hard to have much sympathy for players who modify their client to get a competitive advantage.
---
We're trying a few things to see if the bot responds. Hopefully we find a fix soon, but in the meantime entries will not be accurate. But sure, I'll get everything up properly before the weekend.
---
Holy shit this should be higher up. I thought OP was bullshitting about that part. The guy in the VOD actually ended their turn before a rope even appeared, affraid to be "abusing" something the game client simply allowed.
---
I am pretty sure that legal team of blizzard are familiar with these situations. Thousands of people are being banned every day. I am 100% positive that this is bullet-proof.
---
Yeah, you are right. Its better that we don't own the shit we pay for.
---
Good, now do something useful with your life
---
Thanks &lt;3.
---
Still the best game I've ever watched. I wanted them to win so badly and I couldn't have asked for a better way for it to happen. Too bad they didn't win the finals, but that was a great set too.
---
"Don't cite the deep Magic to me witch. I was there when it was written"
---
But to be fair,  you can't craft any cards with gold
---
They changed their set up you will be allowed to buy packs with gold for rotating sets and historic not having daily wins is a good thing to me, it means that people wont take it as serious and many can use it to play janky decks and not top tier ones

This reminds me of when TFT was having some drama with players calling for other players to be banned for abusing bugs. Riots response was along the lines of "if the cheat exists in the game its our fault, not the player. So why would we ban anyone?"
---
Admittedly TFT was in beta but I still feel blizzard could learn a lot from this.. Sorry you lost your account dude. F.

How? It’s literally just a 2 mana 2/2 with a simple effect? Should it be Discover a non-warrior taunt minion? You’re trying to solve the symptom, not the problem.

Where has blizzard said that it is a bug. Secondly, why has there been no fix of this bug. They have released multiple bundles in that time, but haven't fixed a bug that people knew could be an issue before it was officially released.

I dont think a small indie company like Blizzard would have enough budget to hire another employee
---
That is a feature for the mods. They can decide if they post as mods (making it green and more visible) or as normal users.
---
Devolve
---
Ahh yes a man of culture
---
Blizzard doesn't hire such competence. If they did, then these issues would get solved before they resort to banning people for playing the cards blizzard printed and coded
---
But the option to remove animations isn't in the game. That's a hack.
---
Question is, did you report this bug to Blizzard and put it clearly on display in your streams? If you did not do both of those things or at least the first, i can understand why they issued a ban. 
---
In the end you tried to gain a advantage over your opponents who played fairly with an exploit (not trick or bug) you kept to yourself.
---
Glinda + another neutral magnetic minion.
---
Fuck APM mechanics in a turnbased cardgame.
---
Well, sounds like you abused the mechanic knowingly that it was not a feature.
---
Sounds harsh, but you had it coming.
---
Blizzard and their love for terrible animation times makes no sense. I've been playing quest hunter and the quest completion animation takes almost the whole rope. And reborn animations are really slow as well. Plot twist (a card that is 5 months old now) still pauses for a few seconds (as if the game has crashed) before shuffling.
---
I want to say that I am something of a Blizzard fan boy. That said bans for bug exploitation in online games are the most stupid trash sign that a company is total bullshit. A big and experienced  company, that made wow and Diablo and starcraft, unable to fix a bug in a card game, that bans people who uses that bug.
---
"But fixing a bug in a game is very hard" 
---
Oh ffs I know some coding shit and in 2020 you have a shit load of ways to locate a bug in a code. It's hard to fix it if it's hard to repeat (Look at Aurelio sol's stars bug from league of legends, happened once during a major. Props to the guys who solved that), but this one is a known and easily repeatable bug, and there is no excuse from a company as big as blizzard to ban people for using a bug they do know. 
---
Hope this guy gets unbanned. 
---
Sorry for my English but I am Italian and angry.
---
Nozdormu has always been broken tho. It's partly because the server cannot know how many seconds it actually takes for a client to render the opponent's animations (it depends on client performance), so it's impossible to precisely calculate when a turn timer should be started.
---
It was standard Reddit circlejerky joke, you'll get used to it
---
No, not trying to say that. More like "Hey we forbid access to your 1800€, but we won't tell you why". I call that stealing.
---
Maybe they have evidence, maybe they don't. It's not like the guy that lost 1800€ knows ... (if he is telling full truth ofc)
---
Just trying to say that "it's online game" is not good enough reason to just do w/e you want (on both sides ofc). Ofcourse going full law process is unreasonable, but imho "You broke a rule, bye" is not enough.
---
That would cost a raid tier.

Mechwarper is not a problem.
---
Control warlock could play kobold librarian into a defile which cleans up most of the paladin's board, leaving one mech still alive with low hp and only able to do 8 damage the next turn assuming no other buffs. Paladin is in topdeck mode and board state shows that the opponent was not hit at all the first 3 turns.
---
Blizzard is still silent. This Sniplock issue is posted here many times for months and Blizzard didn't say anything about it. 
---
In the post you are referring to, that player most probably got banned because his turn time got longer due to the opponent's play with a lot of animations last turn. That makes them able to play more Snip-Snaps then in a regular turn time.
---
Let's say we are playing. Normally I'd play 25 Snip-Snaps. But you played an insane Shudderwock turn and animation compensations gave me 1 more minute. And now I can play 40 Snip-Snaps. Assume Blizzard banned everyone who can play more than 25 Snip-Snaps. That makes me banned for Blizzard's fault for which I didn't cheat.
---
This is why we need official response. And gilded posts are easier to be seen.
---
Yes, make priest a pure control class with light/shadow themes and a vague win condition. This is what I loved about priest when I started playing, unfortunately the glory days are well in the past for those who like control in this game

Exodia what requires only three pieces, requires no setup, and can go off on turn 5. Yeah not a even close to what we know as exodia.

Hey dude, I'm not a Heartstone player, but I had a similar experience with blizzard after being banned for playing Torbjorn in overwatch.
---
&gt;Your account has been closed due to a violation of Hearthstone's policies. After re-reviewing your case, we can confirm that the evidence collected was correct and the penalty imposed is adequate for the offense.
---
Blizzard is bluffing you. There's no "review" of any suspension, it's automatic. The tech support is instructed to bluff you, they barely know why you're banned. It's sad that so many people fall for this bluff. You merely got reported enough to be a statistical outlier, that's it. See pic: https://i.redd.it/9c1rqydnhtl31.png
---
 In the end I got my account back by searching in a legal platform a lawsuit in their name and contacting the lawyer that represents them and threatening to open a suit. Probably one of the only ways to get rid of a suspension in any Blizzard game. The other way of doing it is screaming in social media until it becomes a PR problem, which seems to be somewhat working better for you than for me. (blizzard admins just shadowdeleted my posts when I tried posting about this).

The worst part of Ice Block is how easily Mage can discover spells, especially in standard.    
---
Cabalist Tome and Primordial Gyph could allow a player to cast even 4 Ice Block in a game, and could you imagine what would have happened in a meta with Magic Trick  and Mana Cyclone?  
---
Mage also has a lot of tools to draw the secret at the right moment, like Arcane Arcanologist and the new Ancient Mystery.  
---
Tl;dr: Ice block is much more consistent than Time Out.

---
I get what your saying here, but we don't really know that he's not innocent. The reason for this claim of mine is because I personally know that when 2 players playing sniplock meet each other on the ladder the innocent player also gets affected by the cheating mechanics of the cheater. Most players are prolly not aware of this and just tries to get as many bots as possible on the board before roping. If Eddetector was caught up in a match such as this he most likely wouldn't even be aware that he was abusing the cheating mechanics in the first place until it was too late and he managed to get too many snips on his side of the board. 
---
We should always be careful with pointing fingers like this unless we have rocksolid eveidence on the differ. 
---
Until we all see and learn about the nature of the evidence from Blizzard regarding this players abuse of the game's mechanics I plead - not guilty.  
---
I myself, and many other players like me that roam the wild legend ladder every month has encountered this player many times, so far he has never once cheated against me. Considering the fact that he has spent countless of hours to hone his skills over 5 years in this game and making regular purchases through Blizzard at a total value of 1.800 euros, he is by far a strong representative of what we all should consider to be a legit and respected HS player. Not some piece of the earth scumbag that deserves being banned due to so-called "evidence".

Programming is so easy! I don’t know how this blizzard employees who put countless of hours into doing work haven’t been able to identify what’s causing said bug and fixed it immediately.

I mean, programming just takes a few seconds as opposed to making a bundle. So they are probably just organizing some marketing scheme instead of pouring even more hours trying to fix a bug.

It has been by a blizzard CM that he has been cheating and those 2 replays weren’t it.
---
Let’s hope that he lives in Europe
---
Blizzard is not (intentionally) banning you for using your whole turn when it is a little longer cause of a bug.
---
At the moment there are quite some people that use Snip-Snap-lock while altering the client to get rid of animations so they can play 70+ cards per turn. Either OP got banned accidentally since Blizzard thought he was doing the same or he is not telling the whole story.
---
Why ? The deck is only good if you pull your mechwarper on turn 2. The deck is not consistant enough like odd pally is
---
&gt; People exploit a bug intentionally
---
&gt; Doesn’t repair it since programming is extremely easy and only takes a few seconds to solve a problem
---
&gt; Bans players
---
Mike, what’s the holdup? You’re banning people left and right, but not the player mentioned above. There’s overwhelming evidence to show that this is taking place, so I ask, what’s the holdup?

---
Gimmicks like animation roping are things that made me quit this game. Why is apm a thing in your strategy card game? If you want a limit on how many of these I can play in a turn fucking write it in plain text on the card. Why is nozdormu a card? Why does the timer even run down if a player is taking actions?!
---
Dude, the guy's being a douchebag in the first place. If he loses his account because of it, that's on him.
---
A big part of exploiting is that you intentionally trying to reproduce a bug and take advantage off of it.
---
Besides the fact that a player is not supposed to check if he played 25 or 30 cards because he could maybe abuse something we can also see in one of OPs VODs that he even stopped playing cards after he realized he could have an overly long turn. Unless OP is not telling the whole story a ban for exploiting this is bullshit.
---
Well, you admit to using a bug, either after it happened, or you knew beforehand. I'm not certain you should be allowed an unban.

However, I suggest you try some other card game, like MTG Arena, Gwent, or even attend a prerelease event for the new MTG set 2 weeks from now. It's quite obvious that you were burnt out before, or you are at least burnt out now, and if you keep forcing yourself to play HS, you will just hurt yourself.
---
So take care, do what's best for you.
---
Plenty of people come here lying to get a large number of people to support him/her. Then all the white knights go up against the big evil corporation by spamming their twitter, email, and other social media. In hopes they get their account back. 
---
I’ve been playing Blizzard games for over a decade now. I’ve seen a ban get over turned only a few times. Blizzard doesn’t take band lightly and only band when they have undeniable proof. 
---
Instead of hoping on the bandwagon against blizzard I support them in their bans. I play by the rules and I expect my opponents to do the same. I’m happy that blizzard has my back.
---
Often it's fucking obvious that it's an exploit. This kind of questioning distracts from the argument.
---
I know, right ?
---
Blizzard did come out and say he was abusing game mechanics.
---
Agreed. At some point there should be an appeals process that is handled legitimately and not by a minimum wage housewife who doesn't even know the basics of the game so they couldn't even be expected to know what is being appealed
---
This is straight up unfair
---
Animations are a part of the game, as it's digital. Would you remove animations from CSGO, LoL, DOTA, etc?
---
being a douchebag = you deserve to lose everything you have. doesnt seem very reasonable to me. youre a douche yourself if you report people in hopes they lose their account just because they offended you.
---
This is scary. I’ve spent a lot of money on the game. The wild antics and abusive mechanics make me think the player did something to deserve it too (i’ll guess we’ll know soon enough) but what scares me is Blizzards response. No explanation or further recourse. Either you go viral with it or kthx bye. 
---
It really shouldn’t be like that. I’ll think twice the next time i’m thinking of spending money on this game.
---
YouTube is a content platform not a game. Afaik you can't cheat in YouTube. You're comparing apples to oranges....
---
I wonder how they could do this. Do they have one expansion where the expansion is just a "new" classic set? or do they release an updated classic set for each class with every new expansion? IMHO, the classic set should basically be free, but a lot smaller, and just charge for the expansions.
---
Don't forget that THIS TIME, they will hear the players and communicate more.
---
Lol my mobile client is chrome remote desktop.
---
Right, yeah. I've articulated my point of view, I've explained everything, and I was ready to agree to disagree with you. You refused to discuss, shifting goalposts or outright using ad hominems to deflect any sort of debate. But keep telling yourself that you're some sort of defender of reason. I've wasted enough time exchanging pleasantries with sociopaths like yourself over the Internet to know that there's no sane or meaningful discussion to be derived from their nonsense.
---
Sorry, but you're getting blocked. It'll be a relief not to see your Blizzard shilling all over the comments where you usually spew your garbage. Whatever vomit-inducing tripe comes out of your gullet, I won't see it.
---
A) there is a problematic deck inside the game
---
B) that problematic deck abuses  or at the very least stretches out the limits of the game
---
C) Some people see A and B and decide to willingly abuse them
---
So, you have 3 problems. Blizzard fixed the one that is easiest fix, with starting with C. Now, there are other things to do as well, but those take time, testing and money. Don't be short-sighted. Even though C might have the biggest effect on the community, it's still the most minor of these 3 issues, and is the easiest to fix.
---
Bug Abuse is still a bannable offense in the game, read the TOS.
---
Personally i would be ok with that, but reporting people ia too much of a hassle. Plus, i am amused by how butthurt people get when they get highrolled.
---
RemindMe! 9 hours
---
everything you have = your hearthstone account
---
nice logic there
---
Listen, you can be an asshole if you want, I don't give a fuck. Just be prepared to face the consequences for it, this isn't some sort of sixth-grade playground. People have the right not to be insulted or disrespected, and if you're too much of an idiot not to act like an uncivilized child, then you're gonna get reported and banned.
---
Turn 1 holy smite face
---
Lets say your friend gets killed. The police catch the killer, but the next day he/she is released. When asked about it, they tell you that there might've been other killers out there that were not caught, so it would be unfair to punish the one that was caught without punishing the ones that weren't caught.
---
Doesn't that inverse logic sound weird to you? You cannot punish everyone, but if people do something wrong so blatantly in the open, you should at least send a message that this behaviour is not accepted. Whether you disqualify, penalise or sanction him.... I dont care, but something should be done.
---
&gt;sociopaths like yourself
---
Haha, that says everything about you right there.
---
&gt;your Blizzard shilling
---
When in doubt, call them a shill. That's definitely not the sign of someone who has no idea how to properly discuss an issue. Never mind that I repeatedly tell people it's not worth putting any money into Hearthstone, just accuse me of being a Blizzard shill so you don't actually have to engage in an actual discussion. Smart move.
---
It has been... Blizzard have refused to make their client any better and haven’t addressed client timing even though this has been an issue since Nozdormu. Fucking classic!
---
I vote no to this. The real problem is the combination of Magnetize and Echo.
---
That's the malware talking
---
Depends on how decent your collection was before you stopped playing, and if you’re playing to be competitive. Combo priest is cheap deck to make and is a tier 1 currently, just fairly tricky to play.
---
personally yes. but most humans have something called empathy. how would you feel if youd lose your entire account just because of something you said? weather hes a douche or not doesnt matter. words should never be a reason to lose money imo. maybe if its racism or homophobic behaviour you could have more of a reason to report him but reporting someone if he calls you a poo poo brain or something is laughable.
---
Gj mate. I got my first 12 wins a couple of months after is started playing, but considering how much i sucked back then i must have had an outrageous deck, and must have highrolled 12 games in a row. I think it was somewhere in my first 5 arena runs ever
---
Played against the same dude. Thought he added me to say gg like the usual case. Nope he hopes my mom gets cancer
---
&gt;Little heavy on 7 drops, otherwise your child has a masterful understanding of drafting on curve.  Future 2033 World Champion?
---
Definitely! He even picked a Brazen Zealot over a Kodo and a Cube, I thought they were scarier. It won me one game when it went unchecked and I protected it with a taunt. I am nont even sure I would have picked it..
---
He has to learn synergies: I will let the dragon roaster with no dragons slide, but the spirit of the tiger with basically no spells hurt me.
---
I really doubt that. Team 5 have posted on this subreddit many times over and Donais even commented about the Snip-Snap exploit during the weekend. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/d42xj4/blizzarddont_ignore_our_voices_please/f08tqnu/
---
That's a good line and similar to the one I took. I would be nervous about what zephrys would offer on 5 mana there, and if he would give the swipe or brawl or any board clear at all (since he didn't give nether or flamestrike on 8).
---
This is real life. There is real money at stake for a service he paid for. He can certainly challenge it in courts for example and at that point they would be forced to show their evidence. It would be the same as any case were one party paid for a service but did not get it from another party.
---
If you could do a thousand damage a turn (which is not possible with the time limit) then the game would still reach the turn-limit because you made a dent in that kind of armour.
---
Wow blizzard doing something shitty? I thought only origin support is that bad
---
nikolas#2811 eu 80g trade i show you , you go first
---
Yeah seriously, Even Shaman is a Tier 1 deck (has been for over a year now) and can demolish most aggro decks.
---
It's damn near Force of Will at this point and it's just fuck ugly.
---
13 damage?
---
Not really, no. The only thing blizz lawyers would present in court is a copy of ToS, which, I'm pretty sure, gives them a cart blanche on banning your account for anything, probably even at will.
---
Not useless, some standard Token Druids use it.
---
Heh
---
&gt; cosmetic microtransactions
---
In Hearthstone? No, bud. Cosmetics are hidden behind big transactions.
---
No need to use devolve, Blizzard will ban his account any second now.
---
Because you could’ve just made your own comment instead of replying to mine. You’re not addressing my point. And you’re not expanding on my point you’re pivoting to your own. So why do that in a reply when you could have just started your own comment thread
---
You could always mess around with the solo adventures some were completely free and the rest give you the first wing for free.
---
Firebat is a member of Grandmasters, that’s how. I’m assuming there’s a contract he had to sign to be a participant.
---
it should mathematically be as you describe, but the number presented don't support this, again seeing as how the total percentages don't add up to 50% times 9 for each class
---
How would you "fix" the dust system? I've only ever seen people propose obviously unrealistic changes or slight changes that would more than likely fail to stop people from complaining.
---
I would gladly accept more dust, cards, gold, etc. (assuming it isn't balanced by making the game less F2P in some other regard), but I don't think we'll ever see an end to complaints about the game's economy no matter what Blizzard does.
---
Are we talking about the same Acti-Blizz that did Destiny 2 launch? If so I\`ll take my experience over yours any day.
---
I do that with the wife from times to times, I reckon my best was 7-3 but I mostly do 3 or 4 wins. She does not like this game or even play it but it is fun to pick together while trashtalking designs we dont like and she will sometimes ask me randomly how the draft is going with her cards. I love it
---
S1np Sn4p should had never been released in the first place..
---
Considering that the offers are generally of same power,the base power of your deck is totally depending on what RNJesus gives you. You can only make it slightly better by choosing the synergies.So no surprise here.
---
Oh Yeah, in a game where cards are randomly generated, people being unluck to get a card that have a 20 second animation just played bad right?
---
Animation make this game really pretty and good to watch, but instead of simple adding the animation time for the player playing the card, Blizzard choose to just let the player rope.
---
This is a TURN based game, player should not rely on luck or APM to make plays.
---
Just noticed I didn’t quite answer ur question there, sry bout that. Yes, I cud change how i frased the question, give it better wording. Don’t know I can edit that now post-post.
---
Blizzard is being completely ridiculous...
---
I don't play this game until You get Your account back.
---
#blizzardwakeup
---
It has, at least a dozen times so far.
---
Actually I have had good luck in the matchup. I tech in Hagatha for control matchups then I hang on to an angler until 10 mana and just try to refill the board more than they can clear it. Anglers generating anglers is a godsend and the odds are way higher when you are using 8 mana to generate murlocs. I used to try and burn them down earlier but starting on turn 4 they can answer your board with incredible ease.
---
Haha ggs. I love burgle rogue. Surprised you got it to R3!
---
Never play Magic Arena, the game itself has a far worse economy than Hearthstone with the developers seeking to make the format where your cards that rotate out dead as can be while denying any chance to redeem old cards, imagine playing Hearthstone if it simply deleted every card which rotated out.
---
What's funny is that HiddenPants had Plague of Flames. I wanted to see that boardclear.
---
It didn't harhar. Been like this for like 2 weeks. Gets more hilarious each time its posted though.
---
Must be nice being rich enough to afford a computer with internet access so you can be a dick to people online. Considering there are so many people starving all over the world.
---
I love you
---
Same here, but just a zhilliax or siamant or this 2 mana spell demege draw a card can make a huge difference on success of your deck. And I as a complete beginner can't afford such cards, not even talking about one or two epics to try out my idea.
---
It's subjective based on what you think.
---
If someone alters game files to make the game color blindness friendly, I don't think they should.
---
This is the same case: if someone is handcapped that they can't make a play because they can't get the high APM necessary, they are just fixing the game for their needs.
---
"But these guys are using it to get wins!" Blizzard own fault for having this kind of thing on their turn based game.
---
F
---
You can squelch your opponent.
---
The free golden Sn1p-Sn4p everyone received cannot be disenchanted or crafted. We have see this before, with C'Thun and Marin the Fox.
---
Almost as if reducing costs on an infinite minion is problematic... geez...
---
Maybe their saying thank you for playing
---
Spartanz920 #1907 Trading 80g quest, you first.
---
I like the wildcard concept in MTGA, but last I checked you can't disenchant cards and that's a whole other problem I have with that macroeconomy where other then buying packs you essentially get stuck with hundreds of useless cards
---
the answer is somewhere in the middle
---
I think the argument lies within how you are defining skill vs others definition.
---
HS players with consistently high win rates is a good argument for skill. 
---
A good argument for lack of skill is the “me vs a pro” argument:
---
We can use me since I’m a average player at best. I make it to Rank 5 commonly, sometimes 12 wins in Arena. Never grind Legend or spend 8 hours playtesting tech choices or studying meta statistics etc. I don’t have consistently high win rates or anything that would lead you to believe I’m better than the pack.
---
Take one of these high win rate top players in the game you mention, and I will still win (guessing) 30-45% of my games against them.
---
Now we do this same test in other games.
---
Starcraft 2, LoL, Counterstrike. The number of games an average player can beat one of the best players in the game is close to 0.
---
It shows that comparatively, HS takes very little skill.
---
I came here wondering the same thing, I want that card back! :D
---
It should give you extra time if you are using your time performing actions. Maybe it shouldn't be a system like bloodbowl 2 in which during animations the timer doesn't run cause it could lead to abuse, but the way it is today seems like bad design. It feels like the timer was poorly designed from the get go and in all these years we made so little progress outside of shorter turn 1s and hotfixes on specific problematic interactions.
---
I think a "2 for 1" system would be great. You should be able to dust two rates and be able to have enough dust to craft one rare. They got it right with dust values for dusting golden cards. 
---
You should also be able to dust a card of a certain rarity and have enough dust to craft a card of a rarity below the one you just dusted. I think this is the case for everything except Rare to Common.
---
It's a simple change that could go a long way.
---
The F2P system only works if you're heavily invested in the game and focus on a single class. You need to actually play fairly often to clear those daily quests, and dust cards that you know you won't play in your 1-2 decks that you use. 
---
If you want to play Hearthstone casually, you kinda have to pay (which really doesn't make sense. It should cost more to play more, not cost more to play less).
---
Similarly, you shouldn't have to minmax your dust by keeping cards that will eventually get nerfed for that 100% dust ratio, and dust those cards when they're nerfed since you can always re-craft them, as well as crafting Wild cards pre-rotation just to save on dust cost... They're all behaviors that really have no place in Hearthstone, it's a card game ffs not a collection simulator.
---
if the reason to not solve problems on this planet was that there would be more complaints afterwards, then nobody would ever do anything at all anywhere
---
[reckless experimenter]
---
Yes, fun AND interactive :)
---
You can always hide them as well.
---
🦀Blizzard is powerless against bot clans🦀
---
blizzard would never openly admit that 75% of the cards they are making are filler cards
---
Look at the bright side, we're still more functional than magic arena
---
Thanks! He has also built constructed decks that we play together in casual. It's been a lot of fun!
---
bro 😎💪👈👉

* Community warns about potential exploits in the snip-snap
---
* blizzard prints it anyway
---
* players exploit it
---
blizzard: \*surprised pikachu face
---
This is why I love devolve and like playing Even Shaman although the deck feels a bit overplayed at times but devolve+maelstrom avoids all kinds of degenerate shit
---
Until they'd actually start making interesting cards. they could say that they print interesting cards instead of packfillers to lure new or retired players to this game, itd be a cometely different and much more fun game. And common, it can't be this hard to print an interesting card! I don't care if its underwhelming, print it there are no models, just a pictures with already existing game mechanics.
---
How could you know that
---
This is blizzard’s fault I think.
---
You know that you can play up to 11 of them (with coin) in a normal Standard game, right? This is an absolutely retarded solution to Wild-only problem.
---
notpenysboat#21931 EU 80g trade
---
I’m glad I stopped playing Hearthstone two years ago. Game gave me nothing but frustration anymore and was sucking my wallet dry with it’s ridiculous pricing. Skipped one expansion or even two? Well good luck getting back into the game without spending a fuckton of money. 
---
Seriously, screw HS.
---
Omfg how did you find this out? Actually insane, berry cool find dude, you're great!
---
Cmon.
---
Bu...bu... bu..... wild....nerfs in wild....
---
I wish they'd just use the balance hammer there a bit more freely - I don't care about the 'integerity of my old decks', and i've been playing since beta.
---
You can clearly see - with the way card design is shaping going forwards - wild is going to be become an intolerable cesspit. Meta swings two ways - Either degenerate reliable turn 4 lethal aggro decks are dominating or boring ass mana cheating decks like Big Res Priest. The opportunity to ACTUALLY PLAY OLD CARDS, even ones that should have improved with the additions to the game....evaporated.
---
Let's keep wild healthy.
---
Old Warcraft fans sob in the distance
---
And you can never get back the money you invested in the game....seems wrong...very wrong.
---
Same thing happened to me today.
---
Must be a little glitch
---
&gt; GunZ
---
Now that's a name i haven't heard in a while, i could never get K style down even though i practiced the heck out of butterfly. Out of curiosity, what was the "game mechanics being used in unintended ways" in this case?
---
A shame pal, I stopped playing seriously a few years back since I discovered Magic the Gathering (in paper). Maybe if you want to keep playing card games can give it a try (my favourite formats are Draft and Pauper). 
---
Sorry for the screw up, I would be quite angry and I barely put money, only time in there wich I mostly enjoyed except some quest here and there. Hard to imagine what it's like.
---
Nice! I am always afraid to draft secret synergy but when you get enough of them its really good.
---
&gt; but that even if something's good, we wouldn't know it simply because we don't have any data but our own.
---
But that fact remains no matter what. If Blizzard changed the system tomorrow, you'd still not know anything about the data they're looking at (they're not going to release that, with good reason).
---
So they might make changes to make the system perfect, but you'd never know. And lacking that knowledge, you might still complain.
---
So would you admit the possibility that Blizzard has looked at the data, found that the current system is the best and that's why they're not "fixing" anything?
---
It would work even if you did shuffle the minion into your deck - you'd just need to attack before shuffling.
---
You got any examples of that? I'm asking out of curiosity, not cynicism.
---
Endvora#2690 EU 80g quest I show you go first
---
What is exodia mage
---
Just makes it better, you have to be lucky to draw all the singletons and only keep the duplicates!
---
i don't think it would be difficult to clarify in this case. if they made a statement, most popular deck trackers would adjust themselves according to it anyway so no one would be in danger of getting banned. like if they say "showing which cards left is ok, pogo stat tracker is not okay" trackers would adjust accordingly. just an example.
---
IMHO only LoE is worth it, the others only have one or two legendaries that actually see play. LoE is a really good value though.
---
Haven't played in a year or so. What's that minion on the Warlock's side?
---
Then the card would be completely OP. SN1P-SN4P is pretty close to being playable as a 3-drop without echo (see harvest golem), making that a 2 drop would be terrifying.
---
Blizzard even allow it at some official competitive events.  The people who say they were banned for using deck trackers almost assuredly were all cheaters.  This may include some people who were cheating by using deck trackers like Velen Sight that identify your opponent’s likely deck from matching its cards played to a list of meta decks it references; more likely they were running bots to pick up gold for wins.
---
The fact that hearthstone is ANY bit F2P is enough for me. I used to play competitive ygo and that shit was expensive. In fact before video game ccg/tcgs there wasn’t such thing as F2P. Personally I think that the dust system is perfectly fine. It isn’t very newcomer friendly but budget decks do exist. Also wild is much cheaper than standard in the long run so there’s always that.
---
I know it's a "feel bad" card, but it is something that can be played around. 
---
It's also a useful neutral tool for classes that have poor AOE or decks that want to be heavily minion-based.
---
Don't apologize. This needs to be said (over and over again) because people refuse to accept it. No request that is tantamount to "make less money" will ever be implemented and it's not because Blizzard is being (anymore) evil (than any other corporation).
---
I find it very upsetting that Blizzard won't issue a warning before going for the hard ban.  You can spend tens of thousands of dollars on this game, find and use an exploit that *they* haven't addressed, and lost 100% of your investment in an instant.  It's really mean.  Really fucking mean.
---
&gt;The dude has been playing for 5 years, showing dedication to both Blizzard, the game and players, investing lots of time and money in their game 
---
So people that pay money should be allowed to cheat?
---
Delete snip snap. Literally everyone would rejoice.
---
Could I bother you to talk about it? I've seen posts hyping MTGA as a HS alternative for some time with a lot of people saying that it's "easier" to build a collection. What do they have in place of a dust economy and why is it worse?
---
I used to buy the 50EUR packs early in the game, one or two every release because I did not have time to play every day to earn at least 5 packs per week from gold. I am on and off the game, currently playing consistently for half a year, so I open 7 to 10 packs a week, but honestly if I look at the state of my collection, it looks like I play once a week for half an hour. If I wouldn't dust my goldens and every card that hits wild after new release, I would be barely able to build 3 semi-competitive decks. Usually I have 3-4k gold saved before new release comes, so few days in I have opened 50 packs that I would have bought years ago, but I feel like I get a lot less out of them. And is also why I refuse to pay for the cards now, I usually pay those 20 EUR for the dungeons only. But opening 50 packs and get multiple copies of fivedusters is really no fun.
---
I like the creativity but they will have to create 5 cards, hide it from collection manager etc. This makes it quite a bit harder to implement than "echo limit of 5".
---
Wow...You're the best human on earth.... And here i have been manually keeping track of the last 3 adventures with a boring ass excel sheet. This is unbelievable, and You made it look so freaking good. I'm truly shocked with all the effortless garbage that makes top of the front page, that this isn't WAY more popular.
---
What lag issue?
---
Easy fix to me that would nip a lot of shit in the bud is making is so that you can't play the same card more than 15 times in the same turn. 15 fireballs, 15 snip-snap, 15 sound the bell, whatever. If 15 uses of a card doesn't get you there, then we just say "too bad" and it isn't a viable combo, rather than getting into APM territory. 15 would simply be one more than the 14 that already triggers for some limits like number of knife juggles, number of defile ticks, etc.
---
Hey dude, what exactly did you enter in bluestacks to make it work? I'm not having any luck.
---
Not sure how that works. Board flood decks are not inherently unfair at all. MCT has an awful inherent RNG thing to it where the outcome can decide the result of the match; this is especially the case whenever board flood decks have board-flood reliant big bodies, such as Sea Giant or Frostwolf Warlord.
---
Even in smaller instances between taking a Taunt or Rush minion compared to a 1/1 (1/1s not being terribly uncommon at all with Lackeys being so ubiquitous in recent metas) MCT can have massive ramifications on a game based very firmly on chance.
---
And also, plenty of people have rightfully pointed out how you can't or really, *really* struggle to play around MCT when facing against Quest Shaman.
---
I have no idea where you get the impression that the thing MCT works against is unfair, rofl. MCT isn't terribly unfair, either. I don't mind the design of the card much, I just don't think it should stay in Classic. Same for Rag and Sylvanas.
---
Yea it isn't just their analysis - its what collectible card games have been doing forever.  Honestly I think HS's pricing is much less exploitative than a typical mobile game.  Much more along the lines of how CCGs are priced and F2P players can get a good amount of packs as well.
---
Totally agree. Thank you.
---
Pity timer?
---
Isn’t it more likely that Activi$ion just pulls the number of employees on the game, invests less into it and lets it slowly die while milking it for what’s left of the player base? That seems to be their business plan typically.
---
Would he disappear immediately if he was banned or just get locked in his current position until someone passed him?
---
I found these \[\] you are missing them.
---
Wow, at this stage of the meta and with one loss to spare?
---
I only ever got 12-3s
---
Congratulations!
---
Blizzard isn't making improvements for anybody.
---
It's been the same game since the introduction of brawls.
---
nah. 
---
there uncommon cards that cost more than legendary cards, in other card games. sure, the chase cards cost alot on the second market but it is still cheaper than gambling with packs. and then you get the added bonus of janky but rare cards being cheap af. 
---
currently hs acts like nozdormu is as valuable as say leeroy. which it isn’t.
---
I spend way more than I should on shitty games like hs. The issue is I don't even have an interest in the game itself anymore.. it's just garbage at this point in my opininion.   Maybe one day they'll fix it, but then I'll be so far behind I'll shrug and say meh, not worth it anymore.
---
This!  I have tried getting my friends into hs, but every one of them cannot make it past the initial grind.  The game just isn't fun when at any given point a new player is missing 4 - 7 sets of cards.  Heck, you don't even technically start with all the basic cards.
---
Not sure if that is correct,  if you count the first at 10 maybe, buy without the first at 10 I'm pretty sure you do not hit the pitty time 2 times in 50 packs. Not sure though.
---
This. Please?
---
Lmao they still give normal cards for 12 wins at arena...
---
the only reason people suddenly think it's unfair is because with the shaman hero power it can steal 2 minions. the people who want to whine about it can't admit this though because that would be admitting the card by itself isn't unfair.
---
Basically they're removing the animation from their client allowing them to stack it many more times than should be possible for a normal player who would have to wait several seconds before the animation resolves before playing stacking the card again.
---
Which exactly bug is he abusing?
---
5 turns later, warlock still wins with Guldan.
---
Just returned to the game after 3 years... got to rank 10 w big spell control mage pretty easily... and I’ve been stuck there due to playing v these decks! They’re insane! What do I even do to beat them other then playing devolve shaman
---
With the latest expansion £50 didn't get you enough value for money imo. £50 is an entirely new game but the amount of cards I'd have gotten wouldn't have given me anywhere near that much content. Which is why I opted not to pre-purchase this time around.
---
I think blizz has lost me.
---
What are you talking about? Go back and re-read this comment chain. I never said "complaints were a reason not to find a solution" or anything of the sort.
---
The original comment this chain stems from was someone who responded with something that missed my original point that there's an issue with the difference in terminology used by Blizzard and certain players. When I clarified, a different guy came in saying "that's not a reason to not solve problems on this planet," which again I never said and even agreed I would be happy to see the change.
---
Aside from him accusing me of saying something I never did, he escalated what he assumed I was saying about a game to being about "problems on this planet." That's a bit hyperbolic don't you think, especially considering he's accusing me of something I never did?
---
So basically the enemy can’t play any cards until their timer runs out?
---
Honestly I didn’t even read your comment besides 1 word lmao. I was just going through your profile and decided to respond to your most recent comment haha
---
Yeah this happened to me too. Plus I don’t know if anyone else is experiencing this but when the Dungeon Run bosses die, sometimes their death sound procs twice
---
Gonna post the same answer that I gave you in one of your other comments. You can make whatever assumption you want regarding to the intention behind my post, but there's no ill intent whatsoever behind this post. There is nothing dishonest about this post. 
---
"Not really, I thought he would have gotten banned days ago, but then I hear lots of people jammering about how he is still not banned and that other players not associated with being crooks are actually getting banned. And it stirred me up a bit, hence the post."
---
is december "soon" for you?
---
i mean, i guess.
---
That's why I'v disenchanted almost every card in Wild now. Since I don't play Wild, I can (almost) always be on top of the current meta in standard. Takes a looong time to disenchant them all, lol, but if you don't play wild, its a good way to get a lot of dust.
---
The exploit is only available to those who use 3rrd party stuff or change text files. 
---
Anyone banned for that is fair game for Blizzard
---
So, you're comparing something purchasing a copy of Borderlands 3 to acquiring a card collection within a CCG? 
---
Yeah... Nope.
---
Rag, Sylv abd Azure are fittable into almost any deck, in no way MCT is the same
---
Going into the game code and turning off animations.  That's cheating.  Pretty simple.
---
It is dishonest. You've written the post as though you have knowledge of them not being banned, yet it is just an assumption for you. Like you said up in this context, you did not know. You were behaving as though they haven't been banned, when if you weren't dishonest you would have behaved as though you don't know if they've been banned.
---
I don' t want to go too in-deep about the black market of the card games, but I' m fairly sure that the cards itself are under copyright and you couldn' t sell them, it' s just a gray area that people work on and industries usually don' t care because the playerbase that does so is very limited and it' s beneficial to them.
---
IMO, Hs craft system is the most democratic system ever. Every card never lose her value, and each one is always the same. If you played Magic, you should know that 75 leggendaries each year on Hs is almost none, comparing it to the numerous expansions, pre-made decks, exclusives, ecc.ecc. that  easily surpass the 100 watermark, and need to be x3 or even x4 copies.
---
I could make the exact same example for Hs too! If you manage enough your resources, Hs can be insanely cheap, expecially because every card in HS value the same as another card, and nothing lose value, being the ecosystem of the creation of the cards only between you and you alone.
---
Again, with values under my hand, only for doing an extra deck in Yu-Gi-Oh NOW, I need 150 worth of dollars, if not much MUCH more. In comparison, I get 3 meta decks for HS of I disenchant everything.
---
Reminds me of HL2's default pistol pre-patch, where you could hold right click and press left click up to 18 times to queue up the shoot commands.  Then when you'd release M2, it'd quickly execute all of the queued M1 commands nearly instantaneously.
---
Easy early-game shotgun!
---
Brilliant.
---
But stick around for the 7pm news and they will add a new bundle. They must think bundles are features
---
IIRC, HS binds animation speed not to realtime, but to playspeed on video card. So, one could force videocard to play them at 100500 fps, which is done without modifying any files. I've just got nvidia that fast. 
---
Unless Blizzard fixes buggy expectations in THERIS code, this will be repeated, in one or another way. Not that I indulge him, but this guy just mechanics that are already broken, with or without him doing it this particular way.
---
&gt;next to no evidence of Eddetektor cheating
---
Oh really? You can see all of Eddetektor's games?  Blizzard can.
---
There is more to it than that
---
When talking about ways to improve crafting I think people should focus more on epics than legendaries, at least for now. It rarely feels too bad for me to craft a legendary because of the no duplicate rule so I know I can craft without too much regret. I always **hate** crafting epics though because I know that whenever I craft 2 epics for a certain deck my next pack might have that epic in it. Crafting epics can really add up and punch you in the gut.
---
That could excellerate the problem, but it would be nice in most cases.
---
So if you want to be competitive and not spend $200+ every expansion, you can only play 1 deck and you have to wait several weeks to see what actually rises to the top, and hope that there aren't any nerfs that destroy the 1 deck you can afford. Solid plan.
---
oh god, I feel like I should know this!!!
---
sorry
---
Why? Have they not tested the value of the international coin? 
---
If 2 pack for me is £2.99, is that based on 29.9p per card in the UK market. 
---
Compare that to 2 packs for $2.99, for 29.9¢ per card in the US market.
---
Average Weekly Earning in the UK are currently; £466 per week in real terms, as of January 2019.
---
Average Weekly Earnings in the US are currently; $908 in the second quarter of 2019. Women had median weekly earnings of $814, or 81.4 percent of the $1,000 median for men.
---
This means in pure hearthstone cards, the average American earns a whopping 3,036.78 cards per week! That's just over 1.5 ***[GOLDEN LEGENDARIES!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvm7OkybJxA)***
---
Therefore; there is an argument that cards should be equivalent to £1.53 per pack, or 30.6p. 
---
The more I think about this figure, the more I ponder of yonder days, when I'd buy a pack of Yugioh cards for £1.99 from my local store, and unwrap that all-too-easy to get off wrapping and find a shiny holographic beaming at me. It's like that now, only I dust it for the meta legendary (RIP Golden Lord Godfrey).

---
Well I'll give him props for the ballsiness ... I think.
---
Thank you for your insight, no further inquires needed.
---
It would still be the same game lol wtf
---
could be worse, ya know.  ever check out MTG Arena?  yeah the starter decks are nice and "every pack contains at least &lt;the HS equivalent of 1 epic and 2 rares&gt;", but that matters very little since:
---
* NO DUSTING at all, instead you get "Wild Cards" and dupes give you (very very slow) progress toward "The Vault" for a few more WCs
---
* each rarity of WC is its own currency:  you can't trade &lt;one Legendary&gt; WC for any number of &lt;Epic, Rare&gt; or Common WCs
---
* many of your &lt;Epic&gt; WCs are needed just to make sure your decks have *the right kinds of mana* to play cards on-curve. Instead of "+1 mana every turn automatically thru T10" in HS
---
* did I mention, no dusting? That applies to every card you ever acquire, they stay in your collection forever, so you don't even the option of "dusting all your rotated-out cards to build new Standard cards." They're about to implement their equivalent to Wild format &amp; it looks like an even bigger shitshow than HS Wild
---
* They also pump out over twice as many cards per year as HS -- 4 sets per year instead of 3, and bigger sets (200+ cards, compared to 135 in HS).
---
Yet despite the multi-layers of stinginess, hardly a day goes by that someone isn't at the MTGA sub singing its praises ... because "at least it's way cheaper than Paper Magic"
---
which actually is kind of lame since there are a bit more than [a few instances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AtUpiZw_JY) where that limit is easily reachable.
---
It depends on the game. Usually if it’s AAA and doesn’t have multiplayer it will have a lot more than 20 hours of campaign. Like Skyrim or Witcher 3.
---
COD, Battlefield, Destiny, Gears, Borderlands, GTA, RDR etc all have online MP. Tbh I don’t follow them much either so that’s all I can think of off the top of my head. But my point was if you know the game lacks replayability then wait to pick it up cheap in a steam sale.
---
reno mage isnt even close to the most powerful deck and its 20k dust
---
One thing I think people who've never worked in the game industry miss - the people who are doing the design work and trying to "improve" the game are almost never the same people who determine the money stuff.
---
I remember being in a really similar situation - I was working at a AAA studio that was trying to break into the mobile game market, and we were owned by a larger game company, the same way Blizzard is owned by Activision Blizzard.
---
When our game was finished, the head designers felt like it should cost 10-15 dollars, and then you get everything just at purchase. Our producer felt that was too high and gave us no room to sell DLC, so they suggested ~5 dollars for the game, plus microtransactions where you could buy more characters.
---
All through the project, I felt like the head designers and the producer were more or less "in charge," so I figured it would be one of two pricing models.
---
Nope. Our parent company informed us that the game would be F2P, with almost all the characters locked away as purchases. On top of that, there were a million other silly things - energy and whatnot - that they wanted microtransactions for.
---
Let me re-emphasize that this was at a AAA studio with 20 years of name recognition. You'd think that our designers would've had some say in how the game made money, but (from what I understand) it is almost universally someone else's decision.
---
The only reason snip snap is a problem is because of Magnetic. You're hard limited at playing an echo minion 7 times by board space in every other case.

I keep having a moment's panic of "Shit - I did complete the quest, didn't I?"
---
Dont have a best buy here. Only small stores with employes bugging you constantly
---
It's actually more fun because you get to see those crazy niche decks you didn't have the dust for, or getting to see them salty which is far more fun
---
This is a top class nonsense and the best limerick in this thread for me.
---
But the difference here is skins do nothing for the gameplay. You can easily earn any champs you want. The same isn't said for decks in hearthstone. Riots model is fantastic, to be honest riot is miles ahead of blizzard in so many aspects. Competitive scene, community and communication, updates, content, game modes... Blizzard are shitters in comparison. That's not me being a fan boy, it's just how it is. Riots not perfect, and balance is often a big issue, as is mishandling punishment for players but at least they try.
---
I think the dust issue is comparable to riots ban system, nobody will ever be happy with them because the devs viewpoint is prioritising other things than what the players do.
---
thats because: sn1p sn4p bannable=client modification that allows you to play more cards than you should, 95 million armor=perfectly ok, can be pulled in any device without prior modifications.
---
You don't have to modify game files to get linecracker / armor up that high. Plus there are a number of options to deal with that combo, particularly paladin otk and mecha'thun.
---
you said in the original post someone who got banned for playing 30+ in a turn isn't cheating, now you're saying the max amount that can be played without cheating is 25. which is it?

It's not "balanced around animation times." It's just not balanced. They printed a turn 3 infinite damage combo and are cool with that.
---
And Blizzard knows this, they ban these cards from Tavern Brawls all the time.
---
Ah right, fair point.
---
Turns out I’m just dumb.
---
Just make spacebar into the "skip all animations" key. Then fix 0-mana snip snap.
---
Snip snap.  3 mana 2/3 magnetic (can be played as a buff on mechs), echo, deathrattle: summon 2 1/1 mechs.
---
Did you just assume powerchicken’s gender????

You are admitting that you haven’t watched my evidence as well as commenting in the very same comment, where you are admitting this, that quote «The examples being shown can be done without hacks».  Watch the evidence then come back. He plays for about 7 mins in one round. It is cheating no matter how you look at it.
---
Ça va ensemble
---
I don't play OW. Someone want to give me the summary of that drama? Haha
---
This is just a well disguised "gib moar free stuffs". Of course it's a popular idea, everyone wants more free stuff.
---
Something I have found is that just mixing it up and playing less popular decks often confuses the opponent.  I just randomly made a Steal Priest deck this weekend after not seeing it nor playing it for a long time.  I always thought it was super fun.  My opponents seemed to respond as if I was playing Resurrect.  Suffice to say, I won more games than I expected to.    
---
I wish others would mix it up more in both casual and ranked.  Seeing the same decks  all day gets so old so fast.
---
Players with something+"pants" in their nicknames are very often hackers in every blizzard game. Some years ago blizz banned like 50 at least overwatch players with pants in nickname. Now whenever i see someone with this type of nick i feel instant disgust to them. Dont hack guys.
---
Neutral cards that see enough play over time. That is exactly how they are the same.
---
The difference is the severity. Which is why Azure Drake, Sylvanas, and Rag got cut out so much sooner.
---
Is there any particular reason why it isn’t legal? It doesn’t seem *that* crazy if it was a hearthstone card
---
not the guy you responded to, but check out my comment ITT where I go into some detail about MTGA's systems. (as context I've played it since May of last year, before it left Closed Beta)
---
I like this. How long have you been waiting to use it?
---
Not needed just ban people who cheat.
---
Can you share the decklist please?
---
I mean, [[Mass Dispel]] would set the board down to only 9 attack, and then from there, [[Excavated Evil]] just leaves two 1/1 Flying Machines.
---
There are other metrics to be measured when it comes to this though, such as the player experience and their overall happiness which, in the long run, plays a factor in whether the player will want to keep on playing and keep inserting money into the game. So not only does lowering the prices attract new players who could potentially become competitive and buy all the cards, it also keeps the regular ones interested.
---
The flip side is that there are no money rares in Hearthstone.  You'll never have to shell out $400 for a playset of Jaces/goyfs/bankslayers.
---
And you did nothing for five turns? Like not using animal companion on three?
---
[removed]
---
I gotta disagree. The meta pushers are always gonna be the type of people who have almost every card and sink the most time into the game.  They’re gonna be the ones who know the strengths and weaknesses in the top decks and go from there. Highly unlikely that some guy who can barely afford playing is gonna break the meta.
---
Or marked shot. Ugh.
---
I have made an updated version of the deck that I am finding the best results with.  Currently sitting at 62% winrate (yes it was from 20-&gt;low teens but its just a fun deck)

\# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

Luck is also involved. My first 12 wins was a 12-0 wasn't with a completely insane deck either, obviously was very strong. Took several dozens of 12 to get another 12-0.
---
Maybe but it is an old game so harder to attract new players especially when ranking absolutely requires a fat wallet or extensive meta knowledge. Safer and more lucrative to focus on whales with 50+ pack bundles even though the whales know 2 or 3 months later a number of them are gonna be banned from standard play.
---
I'de be fine with 200 dust for crafting Epics. 
---
Commons and Rares are easily found or crafted; Legendaries have the x1 limit and I would guess the average number of Legendaries in a decklist is about 4/5, which is understandable; but Epics always fuck everything up. They are very rare to find in packs and expensive as hell.
---
This comes from a 5-years FTP player (most of the times, I just bought Karazhan and pre-ordered Rastakhan) who has a solid collection so that when an expension drops, I go for those Legendaries I want or I know I will need eventually.
---
Hello again. Not sure if/when you’ll read this, but I’ve enjoyed this tavern brawl so much that it’s the only way I’ve played this week. Ive completely skipped arena and ranked because I’m having too much fun and I think the new randomizer you’re using is a huge part of that.
---
But what about that Paladin deck that uses Zephrys to get a Sorceror's Apprenctice so that it can OTK with infinite copies of Sound the Bells on a Stonetusk Boar using Apprentice + Faceless
---
Kingpolo#1725 NA - 80g Quest Trade. You go first. Thanks!

Could you imagine if the actual reason tournament mode never happened was because they didn't have anywhere to put the button on the home screen?
---
Like they're sitting in a meeting going *"You don't understand! We already used all four spots!"*
---
As someone who has played both, I disagree strongly.
---
Beginner decks start you out with some good cards (that you actually own, as opposed to Hearthstone's beginner decks) wildcards are *massively* better than dust, and the fact that you are guaranteed 1-1.5 packs each day just from your dailies makes the ftp grind way easier. If you're good enough to go infinite, drafting is more effective for expanding your collection than arena is too.
---
Rare lands are a bitch and you need full playsets if you want to play anything tri-color, but it still isn't enough to balance thing in Hearthstone's favor.
---
I prefer the mill deck

This is confusing, they should use the same rules as Auto-Chess qualifiers for consistency.

So many people playing this deck with success which is why we're seeing a lot more combo priests too.  
---
Glad people are countering with that instead of fucking control warrior, please don't let that become any more common.
---
not elegant
---
People seem to forget that Hero cards *actually* display the hero power. They totally can do it, and they did it during Frozen Throne (and with recent Hero cards) but nothing for quests, and generated cards.  
---
More deck slots would be too confusing for new players, but not saying what Ysera's Dream Cards do is fine. This logic is beyond me.
---
If Ican give you some advice, get all the sleep you can while you can. Took us almost two years to get back to a somewhat sustainable sleep schedule
