Warrior is best in my opinion
---
---
---
Assuming the warlock plays defile on a 0/1 and some other dude the turn it comes out. That's a horrible play. If you're arguing against defile, Blood Imp is still better, because it's basically guaranteed to get 2 hits off (one on the turn you play it, and then another the next turn), as well as more potential procs if the warlock doesn't have a way to deal with it. Blood Imp will net you more stats overall than a base 1/3. The only time Defile comes into play is if OP does blood imp&gt;hp and rolls the 1/1, which is also a really shitty play.
---
Ya most likely lol, just one of those moments once it happens you feel like telling someone lol, playing on a tablet, dont record my games sadly hehe.
---

---
I also realise how mundane the post was once the thrill is gone 30 minutes later lol
---
I really don’t deserve someone else’s money for being a douchebag, but I appreciate it
---
Yes, you're in the minority.
---
now go in your toki folder and masturbate
---
Nerfs or not - I'm taking a break from Hearthstone till next rotation. So what that Druid/odd pally lost a few percent in win rate? It's still the same old shit. There have been no actual changes to the game for far too long.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Are you my last 9 consecutive opponents?
---
Then why make the thread if you know the answer? 
---
This thread has evolved into a whole different topic.
---
It was great that nerfs happened but the specific nerfs were pretty bad. Leeching poison was pretty good, though. They just destroyed druid. It went from the best to the worst class in the game. That's quite the overkill. Nerfing just nourish or wild growth would have been enough. Nerfing some of the cards that rotate would have been better since druid will just have nothing good post rotation. They straight up murdered shudderwock shaman for some reason. Yet cards like keleseth, cube, any of the hunter cards were left untouched. Worse, genn and baku were left untouched. Sure odd paladin sucks now but all the other even/odd deck is what most of the meta is likely going to be for an year.
---
don't overlook that the 1 attack means it can act as a ping without more setup, and kill it off when you're ready to land that 2 hp
---
Face hunter before 4 of its cards were nerfed was pretty common. 
---
Knife juggler
---
Leper gnome
---
Arcane golem
---
Abusive sergeant
---
Am I missing any?
---
Because they didn’t comment on the buckets and blizzard probably thinks that the bodybuilding pool is not for handbuffs but simply having a bunch of guys on board. 
---
The value!
---
its almost like theyre all the same and thats the point
---
Oh so you know him too
---
Actually very cool content from him
---
And his french just like me which somehow makes me proud
---
At least you stopped at 30 damage :)
---
No sympathy for clone priest players
---
One health doesn't matter at this stage in the game either. The only way you're killing the warlock is by hitting it with bigger dudes. Warlocks still have TONS of healing built into their class, along with a hp if they play guldan.
---
Play aggro or transform it
---
Zoo warlock
---
I'm jealous
---
I used to play a lot of evenlock and no getting the giant was suprisingly rare but twilight drake i could get out fast most of the time.
---
But even in the best case where you get giant on turn 3-4 it really depends what you face but most of the time you faced aggro decks who just smack you in the face from turn 1 so by the time giant is out you are at sub 20hp and sometimes around 15hp..
---
I dont see how a hunter can be compared to this? Evenlock get and got dumpstered by a lot of things unless its a very slow deck but hunter just crushes anything and everything in its path.
---
Conversely, it was only included post-WotOG because the possibility for t4 Fandral + t5 Nourish was so strong that it'd just win you games outright. Aside from that, Nourish was only ever run as card draw, it was very rarely used as a ramp card until after UI was added
---
:(
---
I was expecting another shitty "honest cards" thread but I already started laughing my ass off at the second card.
---
But then it wouldn't be infinite, it would just be until the boss died.
---
My point exactly
---
Do it my man
---
Zoolock in 2019 omegalul
---
Even playing a standard deck feels a lot more fun in wild considering that you won't be playing against those decks. So while your deck may not have the most variety, your opponent's may.
---
You have 2.5kg saved up, you just won another 325g.  An arena run is 150g, which means with your winnings you can do another two runs.  If you keep breaking even, even with shitty reward rng, you will still be able to go infinite.  Arena is probably THE best way to get packs w/o having to spend actual money.  Just by this screenshot, it seems like you're a pretty good arena player, so you'll keep getting a profit in gold.  
---
Like I said before, you know how varied the rewards are in arena from run to run.  If that's a big enough of an issue to you, why not quit doing arenas?  Why would you come to Reddit to bitch and complain, instead of just brushing it off as "shitty rng" and continue of with your day?  You already know what kind of commitment you're making and that you have a chance to low roll your rewards.  At the same time, you won't be on here showing off your screenshot if you get a super high roll on your rewards.
---
Honestly I just prefer to hang out around r/competitivehs for having discussions with people that actually play the game and are focused  on theorycrafting. 
---
This is mostly just a meme subreddit at this point.
---
So grizzly into highmane into hp grizzly into devilsaur? Nice curve
---
What is this client...
---
I guess not enough people went to Lepercon
---
I don't really get this complaint. You can usually tell which Hunter you're playing by turn 2-3, and it's pretty easy to clear 3/3s, run silence to deal with deathrattles etc. If you play a slow deck, mid-range can finish you quickly if they get the right cards, but I mean lots of decks can. It doesn't feel that op. Rexxar has been out forever, I don't remember much complaining before. And if nothing else, a majority rotate out soon.

&gt;People will cry about their cards or dust for 1 day
---
And some of them will quit.
---
I hope team5 nerfs more often, but I also hope they are a little more generous to compensate (they won't be).
---
So is everyone finally realizing how bad Loti is?
---
There are potential solutions to some of these issues though more formats (game time is emphasized because of ladder design) and making the game less expensive (limits options of budget players, penalizes experimentation). Obviously blizzard isn’t interested in these options at this time but maybe this is because we keep celebrating when they do anything instead of fixing the real issues.
---
9-mana pool has just as many bad rolls as 8-mana (haven't done the actual math on good versus bad). Dragoncaller Alanna 3/3 isn't that much better than Hir'Eek.
---
Give them the benefit of the doubt on turn one - they may have been distracted while in the queue. 
---
Rope them back on your next turn to see how they respond
---
An honest accidental roper will probably quick-play their second turn and you can get on with the game as normal.
---
A genuine asshat roper is generally trash at the game and won't want to waste 45+ minutes with an opponent that will also rope and still beat them. They'll probably concede.
---
Yeah I don't really record while I play so this was the best I could manage.
---
I usually concede when I'm at rank floor as well, the only difference being that I actually tried to win but failed, horribly.
---
I rather play the role of the final boss.
---
What OP said isn’t necessarily wrong, just that there are cards in-game where the minion dying is part of the spell. Like Poison Seeds. The best example that comes to mind is Reincarnation. 
---
I'm not sure how the card is "not that bad" when it literally has one of the worst deck winrates and played winrates on HSReplay for commonly played Priest cards.
---
The creatures need to die during the resolution of the spell for there to actually be room for the treants. Poison Seeds is an exception to the rule, but not for the reasons you’re thinking. 
---
Just you wait until he has 10 mana.
---
Wrong year bro
---
But this isn't standard
---
MORORN
---
Usually I only lose against spell hunter with it. Every other game I have a pretty good chance to win
---
I can't remember a time this wasn't the case for that sub. The only use I got out of it was impressive or funny highlights, never any discussion. Kinda the reason why I never learned anything about the game from reddit.
---
Not dead enough 
---
Second rule of HS. Never apologise for smashing the player who breaks the first rule.
---
Worry not, I'll get around to it. I'm not done by a long shot :P
---
The idea is to play Surrender and then drop Mojomaster so that you're not 3 mana behind anymore. But by the time you can pull that off you're probably already dead, so...
---
Zilliax 100%
---
The point of surrender to madness is that you need to start playing topdecked cards that do stuff or else you'll lose on tempo. Normal cards are too slow, expensive cards are too slow. Taunts, removal, anything to claw back from the now-behind position you have found yourself in.
---
I'm still working on a good decklist but I think the card has potential as a tempo priest archetype. If you play on curve, it doesn't matter what that curve looks like lol.
---
Zerek, Master Cloner. I like the idea of the card but he is way too slow in practice.
---
“None shall pass.”
---
What you said was dumb and confusing. Deal with it. Think of something more clever next time.
---
Oh yes you’re right. I thought you were talking about bringing your mana back to where it was, not equalizing it with your opponent, that makes much more sense 
---
If Malygos is their win condition then they're playing a slow deck. You better be playing a faster deck and kill them before they can finish you.
---
Whats the deck list?
---
But just one sleeve?  Now it’s marked!
---
Sorta reverse but I instacrafted Hadronox when Cube came out cause I thought it had taunt and I was ready to fuck kids up with infinitely reviving taunts. I was real sad when I realized my folly. Little did I know the Hadronox  cube dream was real I was just a little early to the party...
---
That’s weird. The normal interaction would be to leave the minions at 3, so it’s likely a glitch.
---
No he’s fake
---
Hehe its fair advice like this that makes it tougher to choose!
---
:D thanks im just teaaing, the reddit 8 ball is saying all signs point to zilliax :D
---
The biggest attracting factor to geddon was what you mentioned, it wont rotate out
---
Was hoping for a meme that made all attack and defense 0 and text was unplayable outside arena. 
---
It's a month into the expansion. Of course it's yet to prove anything. Lol, Awaken the Makers didn't see real play until a year after it was released, after multiple expansions. Yes, I played Auchenai Soulpriest back in those days, and now it's one of the worst played winrates because, by my point, times change.
---
Professional players call a lot of cards garbage upon release which doesn't back your statement that it's the worst card priest have ever had. (Which is why I said it's "not THAT bad".) You can dig up a bunch of videos about how streamers have been wrong before, so just because you throw out a bunch of names, doesn't mean too much.
---
If giving minions +1/+1 with Keleseth is worth it, then giving minions +2/+2 looks "good on paper" as well. It doesn't need to be good this expansion. It might not ever be good. But I guarantee you someone, especially Zetalot, will experiment with it in the next 5 expansions, and that warrants it enough slack that it can't be the worst card ever for priest.
---
If only you had a Hunter of Old
---
This comment is a little confusing. Can you put it in simpler terms?
---
What’s the name of that guy that did this against Kripp?
---
But that's what friends are for! So you can complete quests with them.
---
Yeah, all the druid cards were balanced around ramp. And now....
---
It's actually pretty decent.  They run amani berserker, and +2 spell damage is really nice sometimes.  Not that it's a good deck or anything, but still.
---
Also sees some play in OTK shaman.

Thats a simplified way of seeing it.
---
But just with playing experience its not a clutch card nor necessary, for the very few times it comes through, its so dissapointing to top deck that when your opponent is at 3 hp and youre top decking, vice versa its horrible to start with in your hand if you never pull an abom.
---
Those factors plus the fact its rotating out doesnt want to make me hone my skills playing the deck with that card in it as a draw

---
&gt; The common explanation why Blizzard hasn't changed older cards that now have keyworded mechanics is that "Cards that interact with that keyword shouldn't work with that card but will when you keyword them."
---
Can you link some of these explanations? There are numerous considerations when choosing to keyword mechanics from older cards, this is not one of them. Peter explains some of their thought process and reasoning behind keywording (for present and past/future sets) in detail [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7arq1f/peter_whalen_confirms_that_yshaarj_rage_unbound/dpdpb5m/).
---
&gt; Wickerflame Burnbristle does NOT work exactly like Lifesteal
---
I'm not sure what you mean here. How are the mechanics of Wickerflame (and Mistress of Pain) different from Lifesteal?
---
Never even thought about  unleash the hounds thanks a bunch that is actually exactly what I was looking for, while I agree baku Hunter is meant for face and unleash the hounds would be great for that it would also assist in clearing the field/relieving some of the overall board pressure
---
I want to see some statistics showing how frequently players lose after doing nothing but hero power on turn 3, because I feel players doing that are going to lose quite often.  I suspect that you see Millhouse as such a horrible play because of the HUGE way that Millhouse can swing a game.  Nobody talks about the times that playing Millhouse worked out, you only hear about the times that he swung the game in a very bad way for the person playing him.    
---
In other words, I suspect you are suffering from confirmation bias.  You think playing Millhouse is a bad decision, and that belief is reinforced by the fact that you only ever hear about the times that confirm your belief.  I'd love to see some actual statistics, because I just don't think playing Millhouse in this situation is bad more times than it is good.  
---
There are plenty of spells you could have in hand that wouldn't be that bad to have Millhouse played into on turn 3 with nothing else on the board: Lost in the Jungle, Potion of Heroism, Consecration, Humility, Hand of Protection, Blessing of Wisdom, any of the secrets, Dark Conviction, Equality, Holy Light, Flash of Light, Rebuke, Prismatic Lens, Hammer of Wrath, Shrink Ray.  Your opponent would not only have to have a spell, but it would have to be a particularly good spell.
---
I don't think the odds that Millhouse fucks you over are as good as you think they are.
---
If that were to be implemented poeople would constantly disconnect, and even if they made a really gpod detection system, people would just disconnect their ethernet cable from their pc or router

you know what i mean

i clicked on this excited to see the funnyies

then i remmebered i havent played in monthes and had no idea what the cards did so non of the jokes made sense

Like swatting insects! 
---
Like swatting insects!
---
It was a power creep in arena tho
---
It's not really true, though. Spellserker can just be played as a 2 mana 2/3 with upside after surviving a trade, but evolved kobold is always a 4 mana 2/2. That's a pretty significant advantage.
---
Wait, what the fuck? Do you actually think that the leeching poison nerf was good? It was one of the most inelegant things ever. 
---
i dont even have that button
---
and then they can heal back up to full with a bunch of bullshit. armor is unbalanced at this point
---
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
---
they should make her set hp to 20 or something then. seriously, armor is bullshit now.
---
Uh nice. How is the deck working out? I play a cursed crew like deck but without graymane 
---
/u/Mutatiion no reply to the above comment?

Savourai#2218 EU trading 80g quest
---
Graal should have the card text: "plz dont silence".
---
Free to Play
---
Uh, yes? Unless you want longer queue times. The difference between one or two ranks is almost non-existent.
---
f2p btw
---
The thing is even if you perfectly topdeck 1 into 2 after playing StM on 3, you still lose on tempo because your 1 drop is a really good 3 and your 2 drop is a really good 4, when your opponent can play 4 and 5 mana cards and you wasted 3 mana playing StM. It's better to play it on turns 9-10 where mana crystals doesn't matter, but at this point it's hopeless, because you already lost by playing a terrible priest deck. 
---
The drawback is so freakin huge, that the card wouldn't see any play even if it gave your minions +3/+3.
---
Yeaaaah it’s cool and all but it really doesn’t look like him tbh 
---
No just f2p
---
Real question: is that allowed under Twitch’s TOS?
---
I don't know how it is on desktop, but on mobile the ads are super annoying. Back button doesn't work properly, super ugly etc. I don't mind ads too much (I could very well live without them, don't get me wrong), but executed like this I would actually stop using your post. Sorry.
---
another one of these..............
---
ok so your saying the ads are too annoying on mobile? well i guess than i change, i don't want to something like that,
---
Yeah but you don't really play evolved kobold as a 4 mana 2/2, you play him for the spelldamage.
---
cards that transform every turn now lose all buffs (and I guess debuffs), so if say you get shifter from unstable portal it will be full cost when it transforms.
---
I feel like we should all stop taking Priest too seriously in this game and just see it for what it is; a meme.
---
That's not really the definition i think. I believe its more like :"he situation where updates to a game introduce more powerful units or abilities, leaving the older ones underpowered."
---
(From wiktionary) and that seems way more reasonable 
---
Couple days ago, a guy came into BoarControl's stream (BoarControl is British and has the accent) and asked "What is 8 PM priest?"
---
After chat had calmed down after that joke, I came up with the very worst joke ever...
---
What do you call it when you rope out playing Topsy Priest? 9 PM Priest.
---
Why is this absolutely riddled with ads? Its impossible on mobile.
---
the game was lost and then I cried.
---
LOL fam so lit im dying xD
---
I used that card once after i got it. Nice dust 
---
Maybe one month I will be lucky enough to have...  
---
Well, a lot of opponents like this so I go rank 20-legend
---
They could have won 0 or 1000 or more games with it so it tells you nothing. Some people like to get legend then don't try hard while someone else really tryhards and with different skill levels even in legend there will be different people at most ranks with the exception of the top 200-2000 players. 
---
The same way you counter any combo deck. Hit them in the face until they are dead. Either that or play Odd Warrior to tank up or Paladin with Thekal to get over the 30 health cap.
---
Nah, its just a really strong deck, people who play it dont suck unless they lose like half of their favourable matchups, its just how the meta works. Spell hutner isnt cancer though, its mainly just how stale the meta is, it was all druid last expansion and now its all hunter, could use some diversity.
---
On one hand they make a ton of these cool cards which are basically useless, because they need something to stick that won't necessarily do so, and then you need to set something up that won't necessarily be drawn and then perhaps if your opponent doesn't have an answer you could conceivably win. 
---
But on the flip-side of the coin they make these completely transparent "play this while that in one round"-effects and you either cheese out an enormous board, win the game outright, do 40+ dmg or get 10+ ahead on fatigue.
---
Now I respect that there has to be power differences on cards, but I'm sure we could have fun cards that weren't useless and strong cards that aren't soul-crushing if not directly countered. 
---
The difference is that zoo has a different win condition than AE rogue, it's more of an aggressive deck. Soularium also only costs 1 mana, so you can definitely find a turn to play it (it's basically free) to dig for something. It's also even better in wild with cards like [[Malchezaar Imp]] and [[Silverware Golem]] played in zoo. You can also just play it before a doomguard or soulfire (if you have a big hand) if you want better discards.
---
With Tess the problem is that she takes your whole turn usually.

I'm not quite sure. And I suppose neither are they and maybe that's why they are not being touched at all. You could maybe change the upgraded hero powers but there isn't much room to change it. And that still leaves genn. So no idea really. I was hoping Blizzard can figure it out.
---
after time out it should be mojomaster, with the text "fine, you?"
---
no card's functionality ever got changed

Craft millhouse, not decks. 
---
It was interesting how the class you pick impacts both what you and your opponent play. Although in the end you just pick whatever class you think has shitty cards. I did like starting with 3 mana, that was a nice touch to make it so the start of the game is less of a bore, but in the end it's just another "here have some random cards" brawl which I will always find tedious and not very exciting.
---
4/10
---
im still not a big fan of Odd warrior 
---
Nice one
---
Played the matchup a lot from the Spell Hunter perspective. It's generally not correct to Tracking because at best you're getting Rexxar 3 turns earlier but get 3 deeper into fatigue so you're not really accomplishing anything. In his case however it was probably correct because he is dying to the board and his hand sucks
---

---
It works that way with both Gahz'Rilla and Scaled Nightmare
---
No I'm saying all those options are bad regardless of the mana cost.  An additional savage roar in a class that's known for having a strong token archetype?  12 armor in a class with an incredibly strong late game?  Draw 2 cards in a class that usually just wants to cycle their deck as fast as possible?  
---
Ok now lets compare.  A conditional single target removal in a class that......already has single target removal?  Spell damage +1 in a class that......doesn't really care about spell damage +1?  An extra swipe that can't go face........or a worse Crypt Lord in a class that doesn't really play Crypt Lord?
---
The big difference here is that ALL the options in Branching Paths are desirable in Druid.  Virtually NONE of the options in Loti are desirable.  Flexibility doesn't mean anything if none of the options are actually good. 
---
Easy
---
These are two different games it seems like, and OP is referring to the fandral Loti interaction that everyone figured out before Rastakhan’s launch. 
---
Good i fucking hate Druids
---
Indeed, this has been confirmed in Hearthstone mythbuster videos.
---
Midrange hunter is a good deck to start as a new player. There are a lot of cheap midrange hunter decks out there but keep in mind 3 of the oldest expansion is leaving standard in April.
---
The quality of this thread is decreasing, we’d better silence before this gets any corny.
---
It's impossible to predict that kind of stuff anymore.
---
I'm gonna agree with the other guy and say once a month would be nice. I understand that you want to minimize invalidating people's decks, but just from my personal perspective, I find that it takes about a month for me to get bored of the meta and stop playing.

I'm surprised you got more upvotes than the person you were replying to, considering that you don't actually seem to be completely correct looking at your other comments.
---
As long as you have all 4 on board, with the (non-disabled) hero power, you win.  Doesn't matter how they get there.
---
Which isn't correct.  You don't need to hero power out the last horseman.
---
if that happens  then it will become like odd hunter, low win rate. Anyway i am unsure why all the baku/genn's hero powers aren't balanced, like look at odd warlock vs even warlock.
---
I use the PURE JANK! version for drafts :) 
---
To be honest, you should not have even played your tracking against warrior.
---
I'm hearing both I  this thread
---
Watch thijs’ video hero power + tripple horseman wins the game. Its not the hero power’s active skill (summoning horsemen) that wins the game but rather, its a passive skill of the hero power. So as long as your hero power is summon a horseman, you can play 4 from hand and you win the game

You don't like golden cards I take? I also play arena and random golden cards that pop up in drafts serve as a reminder of previous victories and feel "earned". Something like a golden Dragonslayer would be completely useless for a constructed player but I get to enjoy this card a lot.
---
Thanks
---
It's still okay at least.
---
Clone priest is good
---
Please don't take this wrong... What  do you do with your life?
---
How do you have the time to play that much? 
---
Yeah thats exactly what im saying. But that deck is still pretty bad. It does have enough cards to make that engine work, its just needs like 2-3 more cards that can fit the archetype and maybe make it viable.
---
For lategame, a 1 mana 9/9 is nothing when other decks can perfectly deal with it with a 3-5 mana hard removal (deadly shot, sap, walk the plank/vilespine slayer, shadow word pain, syphon soul, execute/dragon execute...), or 7/8 mana AOE hard removal (twisting nether, psychic scream, vanish...). Or just comboing you and winning there (mechathun druid, malygos rogue, DK OTK paladin...).
---
Also, all current hunter decks are built to be able to win before turn 10. They get past turn 10 if the opponent managed to slow them down. Surrender to madness priest doesnt have any way to effectively slow down hunter, and even if it did, then it has to deal with the onslaugh of zombeasts.
---
So yeah, I know how the deck should work, but its still a **very** bad deck, untill it gets more support.
---
Easy.
---
Kill, Marry, Fuck
---
You can read about it [here](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Uther_of_the_Ebon_Blade).  I'm almost certain it's a passive check.
---
Who uses tracking before any of these are drawn?
---
I'm talking more in a sense of Kangors Endless Army mechs. Huge invested mechs. 
---
&gt;invest the time
---
Then they become no longer a casual player and dropping cash doesn't really seem very worth it as a casual either since they aren't investing much time into the game to begin with.  It's easy enough to build a single usable deck with what you are given each season as a casual but then becomes extremely disheartening if something your deck uses becomes nerfed.  (These sorts of casual players are necessary for F2P type games IMO)
---
Warrior is the most popular class in Arena at the moment according to HSReplay.net. But still this is pretty nuts.
---
Well, that wasnt the case before the nerfs, so what is your point?
---
Just one more question. How do you mulligan with it?
---
Before the Saronite nerf, I had a decent Bwonsamdi / Surrender deck going that relied on loading your deck with 1-cost charge/taunt minions thanks to Spirit of the Dead, playing surrender and then pulling them out with Bwonsamdi. A little too slow/greedy for the meta, but was able to pull off some big plays.
---
"it is expected that one class or multiple classes are more popular than the others" is an absolutely correct statement (note that I already added nuance to your statement: it is also possible that multiple classes are far more popular than the rest, it doesn't need to be just one). Following that with "it's just hunter this time" in your title is a complete misunderstanding or misuse of the previous statement. 
---
There is no judgement in the first statement, there is however judgement in the latter. "It's *just* hunter" implies that it's somehow not an issue. However, since the first statement doesn't judge, you can't validly derive judgement from it either, even with the added information about the current meta. 
---
So you've made two mistakes (well, three, but two important ones):  
---
- your "hard to swallow pills" aren't hard to swallow, they're a (mostly) correct statement that anyone can easily agree with. It's a direct result from the complexity of the game; there can't be perfect balance.  
---
- your title incorrectly uses this acceptable statement to say something that the statement doesn't allow. You can't say it's "just" hunter this time, because the only way you can say that is either when **a**)it derives from the agreed statement (which it doesn't, because the agreed statement doesn't judge the state of the meta, it only  aknowledges its existence) or **b**) this same state of the meta has happened before and was approved of. this isn't the same as the previous times however (again, because of the complexity of the game, two metas will never br identical.)
---
The nuance you missed here is the difference between the nature of both statements, where one is an observation of the current meta (and all others), while the other attempts to judge the current meta. An extra point of nuance is bad use of the meme, where it is supposed to state something that is true but people aren't willing to admit, while you used it for a statement that anyone can easily agree with.
---
That’s pretty cute
---
Uhm no I have golden cards, almost all besides the legendaries.
---
Druid would like to have a word with you
---
He's not saying that the 4th horseman must be from the hero power, he's saying that the passive effect "win the game if you control four horsemen" is disabled by mindbreaker.
---
With the same dead meme title
---
This is over years. 
---
I know it's not hard. I hit it 2 times so far but lost interest later. But even with deck as fast as odd rogue and over 70% winrate it took some time to get all the games in.
---
But yeah it's definitely possible over 10 days as you said. Arena is the real time killer for me. 
---
Lul Remember when Amaz called Zerus the best control card ever
---
&gt; Furthermore, 'DIE INSECT!' as an additional win condition can be quite annoying because of the 8 RANDOM damage each turn which can cause some frustrating loses, especially if you're not playing a minion centred deck. 
---
It was designed specifically to beat "not minion-centered decks," ending games before you can assemble your combo or drag a game to fatigue. On the flipside, it typically takes at LEAST eight turns to complete the quest (plus another to actually play Sulfuras), giving opponents plenty of time to prepare.
---
Normally aggro wins over control but many warrior removal tool are relies on armor so it make odd warrior op so i think your state is correct nerf hero power is corrected choice if only one nerf is implemented but not sure it will make the class playable or not
---
I never claimed to be good at it. I dusted my packed Keleseth a long time ago because I don't like the playstyle. 
---
Can't blame the Hearthstone team. Blizzard's CFO told them in spring that the company's main priority was to save money, and that decision lead to HotS' eSports scene being shut down.
---
A "true" OTK in that regard would be hilariously broken.
---
On mobile I can see minions “highlighted” randomly. I always assumed that was my opponent targeting or viewing my minions... maybe I’m wrong?
---
The thing is some mechs in boomsday had megnatic keyword and you can easily build a big mech so you had this card to supposedly counter it. But then you ask yourself why not just run silence or even big game hunter that will do a better job overall and not just against mechs.
---
Yes hunter is very popular, no it's not too powerful. Play priest, paladin or warrior and farm them until you reach a rank with a more stabilized meta. And next time you want to make a post, check beforehand to make sure that 20 identical posts haven't been made just this morning. 
---
What's your justification for Hunter being over 30% of the ladder?
---
She is technically right. The best kind of right.
---
Just because there’s a lot of them, doesn’t mean that they’re oppressive or the very best decks.
---
he got it from sindragosa
---
Yes, mryagut and other steamers have been playing it too, and vs said last Thursday that it could be the next big thing. 
---
100% Rng win, and thats ok
---
Play control priest. End of story. 
---
A new set almost always brings in new meta decks or drastically changes the power levels of existing decks. Combine that with the rotation, where pretty much every deck is losing its core cards...there are no "safe" decks to craft right now.
---
Odd Warrior and Odd Paladin will *probably* see some kind of play because the hero powers are so strong, but we have no idea what the meta will look like. It's possible that something forces Odd Warrior to tier 4 (although I doubt it will be that weak).
---
The best deck to craft right now is probably the absolute cheapest deck you can still enjoy. Save your dust for three more months and build whatever tier 1 deck you like in the new meta.
---
To answer your question though, I think there was a "spell priest" deck going around that looked pretty fun. Grave Horrors, Seance, Banana Buffoon, Extra Arms, Questing Adventurer, Wild Pyro, Acolyte of Pain, etc. Definitely off meta, but that deck is only losing like 2 cards.
---
Isn't it too slow to beat hunters ?
---
No it is not.
---
It’s a pretty easily countered deck, and you can punish them for using the weapon too early before flurrys and slams. I have a positive winrate against it with non-quest odd warrior, all you need to do is cube a direhorn once they’re just in hero power pass mode. I also run one copy of mindbreaker because I’ve found it to be a good tech against a lot of decks (hunters concede when I play it after they rexxar on 6)
---
I can only see the hero power being that much of an issue for control decks, in which case you are asking for polarized matchups.
---
[Here you can see how your deck is doing against Spell Hunter or any other deck! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/sGgJfbZ) 
---
Spell hunter is a difficult matchup for deathrattle hunter, but deathrattle hunter is much better at beating control decks than spell hunter. 
---
I'm sorry but that's literally how all of life works. Business, education, etc, and of course gaming. The meta changes and you either spend money to catch up or get grinding. I've spent $5 on the Welcome Package and have enough playable cards to have a few competitive decks... including Hunter. I'll never make Legend but I have fun with what I have
---
Zero mana minions were never a thing and this surprised me mildly. I always figured they should exist and just die at the end of your turn (excepting buffs).
---
There is a lot of design space for this. I'm sure it will appear eventually.
---
It’s not a good matchup (check hsreplay statistics if you’re ever unsure). Generally, hunter matchups have historically been faster is better. Aggro wins vs midrange, midrange wins vs control (LUL) and deathrattle and aggro smashes control and deathrattle.
---
I’ve tried to tech in flare and other cards but the matchup really never gets good. If you’re meeting a lot of spell hunter, I’d suggest you to just stay away from deathrattle.
---
Also, try odd mage with gilneas inspector and doomed apprentice. I got to legend with it this season by hunting on all those spell hunters.
---
Hunter is not good at everything, its just popular.
---
Its not even that good in terms of winrate, deathrattle hunter is the best deck but then there is a lot of other decks before the next hunter deck. Also, the most popular one by a big margin is spell hunter.
---
It has very good anti aggro tools with their board clears, voidlords and lifesteal package, but I think it looses to cube hunter. Hunter is less popular at higher levels than it is on average. 
---
FWIW, some people do like the odd warrior gameplay. It's polarizing, but some polarization is healthy (in order to have a diversity of play styles, as opposed to a diversity of classes or a diversity of card choices, which are also important).
---
When you had the quest rogue / odd warrior tightrope where polarization was at the very heart of the meta, that's where it's a real problem, but that's not where we're at right now.
---
Potion of Madness, entomb ,psyshic scream

If the intention is to complete one's collection, then opening packs from the latest expansion would likely benefit the most people. As I've said, your suggestion really only benefits new players, most older players would have no desire in getting old packs and would avoid playing those weeks. By offering packs from past expansions, you'll create significant variability in player participation and more or less discourage a significant portion of players from playing certain weeks. If you really want packs from past expansions, then just buy them with gold. You seem to think the current system needs improvement when most of the playerbase is satisfied with it. 
---
It was a problem for a week because it got nerfed, seems* like you forgot about the leeching poison nerf?
---
Mainly for the memes
---
This is great, thanks for actually posting a video. Would the paladin have won if the rogue killed the mindbreaker?
---
The thing with Doomerang is that the damage source for that card is the weapon itself, not the actual spell, which causes it to trigger things like Poisonous and Lifesteal; in that case, it would make sense for Doomerang to not be affected by spell damage because the actual spell doesn't do any damage. 
---
With that in mind, if Velen did work with Flurry (which could very well be the case, not that I've ever had the opportunity to try it) it's only a matter of time before we get a Trolden clip where the Warrior kills himself with it.
---
I just don't spend any dust to craft a Hunter deck because I have a feeling that class is inevitably going to get nerf. I'm having more fun with Warlock anyway.
---
That’s why I don’t run it in my deck
---

Bloatbat with any type of poisonous/lifesteal/rush/stealth is absolutely bonkers
---
Proably for karma/cool screenshot etc. since he as infite player doesn't need much gold anyway. Can also make opening video if he ever wants to. And he can have run already going and it's likely that he'll get 80g from it anyway for next run.
---
Immune to counterspell, too OP
---
The only solid use I could find for her is an OTK. I've seen people play Young Dragonhawk and Spirit of the Shark turn 9 and play Prep double Crazed Chemist on Dragonhawk for 17 x 2 (windfury) but Dragonhawk gets pinged too easily being in a rogue deck with the threat of Coldblood. I personally use Raging Worgen with Sunwalker (to protect Worgen) turn 9 and Spirit of the Shark Crazed Chemist Coldblood backstab (on Worgen for the windfury +1 attack while damaged) turn 10 for 16 x 2 assuming no taunts will be played. Any thoughts or ideas for better substitutes?
---
You are. Most of these posts are pretty bad, but I enjoyed yours so good job!

EU trade 80 gold quest
---
It was pretty decent during the Boomsday meta, from my own experience with it. It’s just that it’s currently outclassed by the OTK decks, though there’s a decent change it’ll rise to prominence again once those decks lose some of their big combo enablers with the set rotation.
---
Look also at the decks that have arisen since the Druid nerf.  You think Springpaw could possibly see play when Plague was in the meta?  It might as well read "1 mana: summon a 1/4 Taunt for your opponent".  And the various shades of Priest tend to do nothing against Druid due to armor, or they're slower combo decks than Druid.  Same with OTK Paladin, it's like Druid but slower and less resilient.
---
Or look at the tournament meta, which is very different from the ladder meta but nonetheless is an index of power levels.  Druid was in all or nearly all lineups because it was the most powerful thing to do.
---
Rexxar goes into a bank.
---
Bank manger says ‘good morning sir, how may we help you today?’
---
Rexxar leans over and growls ‘I hunt a loan’.
---
Your opinion is respectable and kindly stated but I don't think you could represent the average player. I play since the beta and I don't have classic collection completed and I would never give up the dust even if I had the entire collection :D
---
Harder to swallow pill: this is because Blizzard doesn't know what "balance" means.
---
I never said nor thought you were trying to insult me. I just had a different view since VS syndicate shows that cube hunter is better than spell hunter.
---
Inb4 someone stitches King Krush onto Young Dragonhawk
---
He's giving us the necessary information, which he would have had in-game anyway.
---
Sent a request DerpyDolphin#2900
---
Caravaggio was playing it in his control OTK pally during KnC it was excellent with call to arms and there weren't many classes who couled abuse it
---
Just came across that way, sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
His hand doesn't do anything and you can see on the sidebar that the opponent played a Harvest Golem and Security Rover on his turn. If you don't Tracking you're basically just passing with very little chance to naturally draw into something good
---
That seems the most likely. If you're anywhere near infinite but not buying packs it's hard not to amass tons of gold.
---
I average around 5-6 wins per run and stopped opening or buying packs around Un'Goro. I currently have 17465 gold and 222 unopened packs.
---
&gt; Anyway i am unsure why all the baku/genn's hero powers aren't balanced, like look at odd warlock vs even warlock, or even hunter vs odd hunter
---
Because some classes have better odd / even cards than another and some hero powers are better than another which lend to various classes being better with odd or even decks.
---
A dragon that generates so much value, and probably this is an arena game (is the place where dragon roar is played the most) so its so much value and card generation just with a dragon roar imo
---
You are too late for making this
---
The thing that gets me is that in the past, the complaints about the top decks were all about the lack of interaction. Machine gun priest, maly Druid, togwaggle Druid, and so on. 
---
Hunter doesn’t have any crazy armor gain, over-the-top kills, they just want to hit you in the face. Sometimes they need infinite value generation to get there, sure, and maybe 12/12 of stars on turn 5 is hard to deal with sometimes but smacking the face with minions is really the way hunter gets wins and that’s pretty interactive. 
---
There have been much worse metas for sure
---
Same. It's in every deck but its just not worth it.
---
What's your average, OP? I'm only interested if you have strict tracking. Don't care for "I think somewhere around" numbers. Most people estimate very poorly what their win average is. I always think I'm between 6-7 but my tracking of my 531 arena shows 5.83? Was 5.86 but things haven't been going well since last bucket change.
---
Slightly different speeds but the same overall game plan. They want to throw some beasts and/or secrets on the board and use that control to smack your face. Then if that doesn't work they Rexxar as a one-card wincon or Zul'jin for a last push. I think it's worth restating that when they Rexxar it feels like playing against the same thing regardless of the original deck.
---
Hunter?
---
*gasps*.... Are you projecting? 
---
I play spell hunter. Very fun if you get the spellstones charged. DK rexxar saves you alot if you get him. Some spell hunters run DK Rexxar and Zuljin.  Unfortunately we didnt get much in Boomsday or Rumble. baited arrow and wing blast if you want to use those. As a warning, spell hunter is going to die horribly next expansion unless they release things that can help it survive. We lose dk rexxar and the hunter legendary weapon. 
---
People just want to complain. If they nerf hunter, odd rogue will be the next.
---
*"who the fuck though that a 2 mana 2/2 weapon as hero power is balanced??"*
---
*"baku is destroying the game since WW i fucking hate rogue it still uses the same cards wtf"*
---
Supercollide face -&gt; eternium rover -&gt; magnetized ziliax -&gt; flurry -&gt; ??? -&gt;millhouse -&gt; yes
---
Game design is carrots and sticks. If something is overused, adjustments can be made to punish using it or reward using something else, the game designer absolutely owns the responsibility for a dominant strategy in their game.
---
That and maybe Beryllium Nullifier. Having a neutral way to deal with him in case Mech Warrior got crazy would help classes that don't have stuff like Vilespine, Freezing Trap, Scream, etc. 
---

If you are playing on EU you can add me: Mint#2174.
---
From my experience there are so many things to learn that you cant always ask on reddit, better add people who know what they are talking about. Best of luck =)
---
Giving away free EV seems like a bad idea if the goal is to go infinite
---
I apologize too, its true I wrote it in not a very correct way, so now that I re-read it again it really looks a bit aggresive. My bad.
---
I feel like in a match where both players are equally skilled, the Hunter is favoured. It is definitely a matchup that goes to fatigue and Rexxar outvalue boom. 
---
That’s what i think @ 90% of the posts on this sub and i’m glad someone said this.
---
About 2
---
Still though those apps aren’t perfect. I use heartharena and I would have good decks if i just picked the best number every pick. That said there are times where the best numbered card isn’t the best card in your deck and you have to be able to recognize that if you want to get into the higher wins. 
---
If people still play WoW in 2019, I see no reason to worry.

---
Here is my play test of the interaction between both cards. Velen only triggers in the damage dealt to minions because the armor spent is not consider as damage. Hope it helps for your next games!
---
The hero we need but don't diverse, thanks sir  
---
btw, i love ur username 
---
I mean, you know what Velen does, right? It's quite obvious. 
---
Exactly my point, it's dumb and should be bannable that you can install a plugin that will make you a good deck in arena every time
---
Win 3 games with priest and reroll the warlock quests
---
&gt;Well spell hunter/beast something hunter were merely a tier 2 deck before the nerf, 
---
True for Masters Call Hunter, but Spell Hunter was Tier 1 before the nerfs largely due to Zuljin.
---
&gt;Deathrattle hunter is a newer deck which I admit is overpowered af but it wasn't really a problem when the nerfs happened. 
---
I'll go out on a limb here and suggest that Deathrattle Hunter was stronger than any pre-nerf Druid deck, even during Boomsday. But even if you think that's going too far, saying Rattle Hunter wasn't an issue at all before the nerfs is simply laughable.
---
&gt;Plus the meta isn't even bad 
---
Lol
---
&gt;less than 1/3rd of the players are hunters 
---
Could have fooled me.
---
&gt;and it's not like they crush the other archetypes, it's just that they're very cheap to craft.
---
Yeah dude, Hunter is only seeing these absurd levels of popularity because of how fun and interactive the class is to play. Certainly not because of high win rates across all skill levels.
---
Who *doesn't* love mindlessly shitting out secrets early game? And vomiting the correct high value zombeasts into your hand with DK Rexxar requires a level of skill other decks could only dream of.
---
&gt;we haven't had a meta this healthy (low power level, even some homebrews work) in years.
---
Yeah man, I remember the days of early witchwood before they nerfed Call to Arms, where one class (Paladin) dominated Tier 1 with at least three decks.
---
It was so annoying and cancerous. [Thank goodness we don't have to deal with anything like that anymore.](https://i.imgur.com/InAw81u.jpg) 🙄 
---
Thanks!
---
70 gold and infinite arena player ? Arena costs 150 last I checked.
---
Your roomate has obviously never played Hearthstone a day in his/her life if he/she doesn't think it's possible to get that screwed by RnG.
---
What the pack... 
---
I need more Odd Warrior mirror mathcups. Ok it lasts a bit long but it feels like you are playing chess. Trying to get every single value you can, FeelsGoodMan
---
Yeah i kenw this interaction would go as this but i recently made a post that arised some controversy on Velen's interaction with reckless flurry and just wanted to probe how the worked
---
What's your opinion of the class tier list? Normally dont play arena but sick of missing cards for competitive
---
He was playing that yesterday, yes, but he hit Rank 1 with a Mecha'Thun list.
---
well 2048 x 100 = 204800 so yeah, quick maffs
---
You have to play around more stuff and can’t netdeck is what it boils down to in my opinion (not the guy you responded to)
---
Well I did 60 damage to all minions thanks to Velen's effect while having only 30 armor
---
you're short about 200 thousand and 2400 gold then
---
no, that's not his point lmao.
---
and he's right. i agree with heartharena like 85% of the time, but it picks the best statistical card not the best one for your deck. if you want to be consistent at 12 win runs, you can't just blindly follow the heartharena picker.
---
I have a pretty high win rate vs Hunters, you can easily stall out the game with Voidlords, removal and Gul'Dan and get through your deck before they can kill you.
---
Tempo tempo tempo.
---
You need an average between 55 and 6 to go infinite. Over 6 is definitely infinite, my average is between 6 and 6.5 and i'm infinite. 
---
19 armor for a possibility of onyxia being good in a game seems a really good bargain to me
---
Concede button  
---
Ohh I stopped watching before that. Thanks!
---
This sub sure always finds something to complain about
---
There was a post earlier showing the history details of reckless flurry. It showed the hero taking damage equal to their armor
---
Mind Control Tech.
---
Please Hall of Fame this card.
---
Playing around it is miserable if your hero power makes minions.  Not playing around it makes it a massive RNG swing (the difference between stealing a 1/1 and stealing a 6/6 is a 20 stat board difference decided purely by RNG).
---
Also not a fan of Mech’a’thun.  Just straight up the most boring combo.  Maly you could play around with enough armour.  Also playing mally with no spells on the same turn is sometimes correct.  Shudderwock was often a reasonable play with no combo, and in some matches you play it early without the combo just to stabilize.  Mech’a’thun does one thing and one thing only.  You win or you die.
---
Would i be able to add u?
---
I see. The point I was making is essentially that you don't tracking just to find Rexxar because even if you do end up getting him '3 turns earlier' is that you're really not because the only reason you want him earlier is to make more Zombeasts before fatigue kicks in so even *if* Tracking gets you closer to making Zombeasts you're at best getting closer to fatigue the same way, so you actually don't get more turns to make Zombeasts.
---
tl;dr Tracking, Odd Warrior, bad.
---
But sometimes you choose to not play around cards cause you’d lose if you did.
---
Which takes you back to standard level strategy.
---
I feel like I must be missing something, sorry. I’ll read some comments and come back
---
What are the actual odds of this happening?
---
They aren't and that's the thing. Extremely specific destruction is not going to work if attached to such costly understatted minions.
---
Even if mechs (or GvG era beasts) were powerful, those card would probably not see play anyway, since gutting your deck with such inefficient and matchup based cards is straight up worse than just play your usual deck.
---
This card is Epic probably because Hemet was considered the worst legendary ever at the time.
---
Same. 20k gold and only play Arena, other than the five monthly wins for the cardbacks. I wish there was something more you could do with gold. Even being allowed to give it away would be awesome. 
---
If you want to be consistent at 7 wins you can’t unless you just understand the game well
---
What’s your opinion on deck trackers and looking up decks online? That ban-able too?
---
What?
---
Tracking takes 3 cards off the top, so you pick one card out of the 3 that you were going to draw in the following 3 turns, the other 2 are burned.
---
You need 7 to always get at least 150g as reward. Add dailies and some of the 7 wins giving you over 150 and you don't really need a 7 average for infinite.
---
Problem is the mechs arent big enough to warrant single target removal
---
But the goldens...
---
Dailies have nothing to do with infinite. Infinite means unlimited. Infinite in arena means an average gold reward of at least 150 gold. Daily quests might mean you can play as much arena as you have time for with a sub 150 gold average reward, but that does not mean you are "infinite" in arena.
---
This won't be perfect but think of it this way.  At the start of the game you have a 27 card deck missing just the 3 from OP's pic, and now we need to shuffle the 3 special cards in, which we will do one at a time.
---
1. The first card can go anywhere.
---
2. The second card needs to land either immediately before, or immediately after, the first card.  So there are 2 spots where it can go, and 29 possible places we can put it.  2/29 chance to put it in the right spot.
---
3. The third card needs to land either before these other 2 special cards, after these 2 special cards, or directly between them.  30 possible places it can go and 3 of them set up OP's screenshot.  So 3/30.
---
2/29 * 3/30 = 6/870
---
That is a 0.6% chance to get these 3 legendaries lined up in a row like that.
---
Once you manage that to happen (which is about once every 167 games) you THEN need to manage to play Tracking at exactly the right moment.  If you have just one copy of tracking, you only get a 1/30 chance of playing it at the right moment, so you'll succeed once every 30 attempts (and each attempt, remember, requires 167 games to set up) so you'd manage this about once every 5000 games.
---
Add a 2nd copy of tracking so you can get double the attempts in, and now you'll pull this off **approximately 1 in 2500 games**.

He doesn't even have enough gold to enter another arena run. As someone who only plays arena, if he gets a bad run, then he's forced to stop playing for a couple of quests. If he actually bought packs with gold, then that was a waste of gold, because he doesn't open the packs. It is literally, by definition, a waste. 
---
Also, mentioning another option without mentioning that option? Nice.
---
I'm thinking that the code is hidden through the use of the cauldron card or one of the different witch bosses in witchwood monster hunt. Some of the interactions or emotes could hold the secret. 
---
Looking at this list, there is at least 4 witches

the boomship would summon them both and give them rush
---
Study? Isn't everything known?
---
I play Odd Warrior occasionally and its shocking how many odd paladins or hunters need to think so hard about playing their spellstone or click their hero power. I usually just attribute it to someone is salty and trying to waste my time. 
---
hemet's fine.
---
I dunno man, I see why you would want to play the new hot meta deck, but I feel like if you do you shouldn't act like it's not justified that rng takes a big fat dumb on your head once in a while. That's just the universe balancing things out for your oponent. Also, what did you choose? 
---
Can I get a link to the video? I can’t find it
---
Can’t get those reliably.
---
that's a pretty specific achievement but congrats!
---
And 70g even worse. Sorry tho.
---
I'd stop playing for a week.

The devs probably assumed that magnetizing mechs will be much more popular and since it was a new mechanic they wanted to push, they didn't want the tech card to be too strong.
---
If mech warrior was a strong thing, this would be great against Beryllium Nullifiers.
---
That name is amazing, I love you &lt;3
---
That is impressive.
---
either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives
---
God forbid the Spell Hunters and Odd Rogues get a little annoyed by a deck that's actually fun to play. I feel so bad for them!
---
How much dust?
---
JRuss#11794 NA trading 80g quest. you go first.
---
Warth  
---
The real ones will know 
---
Wow, that tilts me and it's not even my wins.
---
if you play around everything you lose, and choosing what to play around is basically %s combined with considering their impact. remembering cards isn't really "skill" in this context either.
---
Homebrewed a deck to top 500 Legend last month, never spent a penny. The welcome pack would do nothing for me as my classic set is missing like 3 epics atm.
---
You thought this was worth a post?
---
Man, it's like he didn't read your post at all.
---
40 dust packs do appear the most often, that's true. But the average dust value still remains 100.
---
surprised nobody is saying rotface; oondasta in arena is basically a worse charged devilsaur, unless maybe you're running hunter. Rotface feels like the most consistent option here. 
---
Tbh getting Rexxar this late it reckon you'd lose the game, you are 2 cards further in fatigue and haven't had big minions yet so I guess your opponent would have his Shield slams and Lancers in hand. When he gets Dr. Boom it's over most of the time.
---
This comes from an experienced Odd Warrior player. 
---
Thanks for posting a power of two
---
Wondering what you should put in a deck to make Corpsetaker good?
---
**UNITY. PRECISION. PERFECTION.**
---
Which is simply the most commun unique pack, not the average.
---
Between a golden rare, a pack, and 70g, which would you want more? The golden rare is guaranteed 100 dust. The pack is, on average, 100 dust, but any individual pack most likely (around 3/4's of the time) has 40 dust. The 70g is less than a pack's worth.
---
I don't play arena, but I suppose you could put it towards arena, and if you're good the 70g would have more value.
---
With all three hero cards of the last set, the hero powers are upgraded but I wouldn't say they're broken. Zul'jin especially. If you're playing Zul'jin it's not for the upgraded hero power. So I think it's fine to have upgraded hero powers but not have them too high like they are with the death knights. 
---
I agree. So much, in fact, I nominated him for best card of 2018 in the sticky thread

Just did this on my iPad Pro, super easy and looks awesome now. Thanks!

Right you have to decide what you want to play around at any given time, you may know percentages of cards but you still don’t know what they have. I know basically every card to play around in standard(especially if it’s and odd or even deck) and remembering cards is definitely skill in this context. And it’s a skill you have to have in arena or you’re not hitting 7+ wins
---
Second Update: After finishing the run I probably would’ve picked Elise. A lot of the time I found my self fishing for good draws in the super late game and the extra Un’goro pack probably would’ve helped a lot
---
Hell yeah 
---
That's a lot better than we usually do!
---
Click it very hard.
---
Well, honestly, the pack, yeah. I see your point.
---
One card vs one card And hero power-value is fine, 3 mana card vs 2 mana and 2 mana HP tempo Is fine. We will see him winning tournaments in no time. He sees plays where everyone sees HP end turn :-)
---
Edit: 3/6 dude, way better turn by warr.
---
1/25 * 1/25 so  .16% chance for it to happen
---
I like arena the most because you get to play with cards you wouldnt otherwise.
---
It happens when you dust duplicates
---
No worries. I just think back to a recent post that talked about this sub and how there is never discussion, and I think it comes down to people feeling the need to shut down people instead of trying to help them understand the struggles vs X deck.
---
And I was having an off day yesterday, no harm done though ;)
---
and odd warrior just can't win against Rez Priest. Or any OTK decks for that matter. It is a stall out the game to fatigue kind of deck. It just doesn't have enough threats. The only way to generate threats is to boom ASAP to keep generating mechs, but then you lose out on armor. I have managed to beat one rez priest in my encounters, but that was because he played really badly and didn't get the combo from spellstone (like the only time for me lol).
---
I understand the meta btw. I can always make it to rank 5, even after taking 4 months off lol. I just keep getting good  matchups followed by priest to always end my streak. So I am just going to switch off. It isn't working, and sometimes you need to get lucky with matchups to get anywhere (when playing a deck like odd warrior).
---
See that's where they are clever. They only said the Cauldron didn't have any interaction, but you can drop the ingredients in the potion to the right. Never said anything about that O.o
---
Why did you reply twice and slightly differently each time? Apologize!
---
cause most of those cards are Hallucination
---
Emerald. I've been playing Secret Hunter since Beta and no bandwagon is going to make me hate having a second secret-synergy class card in a trap class. I waited all of Hearthstone for this card Yoggdamnit!
---
You’re right. It’s around 102.71 dust per pack. 
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics
---
It’s important to keep in mind that’s the average dust per pack, not the median dust per pack. 
---
You’re going to see a bunch of 40 dust packs when you open packs, but these are offset by the dust from packs that contain legendaries or golden cards (or even golden legendaries). 
---
another secret thats broken on 144fps &gt;:(
---
r/unexpectedharrypotter
---
Or at least let you pick class first then let you pick from the 3 shrines that class has
---
I did that golden teeth trick before knowing about the actual board secret, but i couldnt recreate it. :( What's the trick?
---
Infinite value from just one card is ridiculous. Other heroes require building around, Rexxar is something you just throw in there to win slow matchups. Yes, Uther will be better in late game, but the whole deck is built to do that, Hunter is often an aggro deck that gets free value generator for late game.
---
You know something is wrong when the most heavy control decks get outvalued by a secret hunter deck.
---
5 Army of the Dead, nice.
