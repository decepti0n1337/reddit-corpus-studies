Those poor Control Warrior players. Just trying to play an honest an skillful deck and then getting absolutely slapped in the face by a ridiculous RNG play.
---
---
---
As if the Sac Pact Jaraxxus mechanic needed more opportunities to occur.
---
Strawmaning what exactly? The dude above me (and below RiZZaH) clearly misunderstood RiZZaH's question. Am not refuting anything here.
---

---
That's also a weird way to express jealousy over internet points but hey, you do you.
---
So if i complete my quest that i have gotten today (the 6th) i Will recieve the saviors of uldum quest later?
---
Yes, it‚Äôs just you. You are a genius. I seriously don‚Äôt know what this subreddit would do without you. This post deserves 69k upvotes for its creativity and originality.
---
You seem bitter.
---
Good. Long live warrior, the most skillful and interactive class.
---
Play Zepherys
---
Wish for Auchenai Soul Priest
---
Kill
---
That's great and I understand it, but the problem is crippling one archetype without adding any new way to play it when it wasn't meta defining. Do you think it has been a good decision that an slower Control Paladin has had less tools all this time to try?
---
It can‚Äôt be fetched by call though? You play secret keeper and contender, which are the reasons the deck is good, and they break call, and there‚Äôs no way 3 mana tutor 1 is good enough, even with a 4/7/7
---
Yes.
---
Because I like playing Mech Buffadin. And not having to roll in a bloody Equality combo because it's just that good is a nice feeling. Not having ^(1)/8th of my deck built for me is a nice feeling.
---
He will forever remember how you've treated him. On his last day his last tear will fall while he's thinking of that terrible moment in his life.
---
It‚Äôs a generated card though, so more like discard 1/2 a card.
---
You're a more optimistic man than me, but I applaud you for it.
---
Which is why I run a Control Warrior deck I built myself with quad silence for all that Mech bullshit and double Supercollider to shit on Cyclone Mage when they highroll.
---
It certainly appears to be Tree of Life after Auchenai Phantasm (The healing = damage this turn spell, but attached to a minion).
---
Avenging Wrath isn't guaranteed. 6 could go face and 1 into each minion, leaving up a 3/1 Zilliax.
---
Agreed.  
---
Zephrys will end up being so strong in plot twist warlock just from all the discoveries.
---
Fair enough, but my point was that big cards with huge effects shouldn't be automatically pushed aside just because they are slow.
---
What‚Äôs there to be bitter about? It‚Äôs an obvious and known fact that Dr Boom isn‚Äôt all that strong. It needs a small buff. Read my above comment.
---
Yeah the dude below rizzah attacked a straw man.
---
 Internet points only matter in so far that the silence or boost an opinion.
---
Lol, this post won't age well.
---
I didn't ask for upvotes, I wanted to know if anyone else had this issue. :)
---
Play Warrior. Either Bomb or Control. Shits on everyone.

You know, the worst part about this isn‚Äôt that you‚Äôre the one thousandth person to post this crap, but that you‚Äôve beaten 178 Dalaran heist bosses, which only includes that wing. This either means that after 178 bosses, you still can‚Äôt beat an easy ass adventure or you spend all your time doing the Dalaran heist over and over again. Sad. Just sad.
---
Same. When this game is on its last breathe, we're getting a diablo expansion or something to that effect. I have 0 evidence to back that up but I'm calling it now.
---
I would assume so. You're way ahead in time zones, the expansion isn't going to come out for at least another 16 hours (I think).
---
America trading 80g quest, Muzz#1640 (will be online for the next hr or 2)
---
Not being dishonest at all and you are being too aggressive for a calm discussion. They actively nerfed a card so we cna talk a reason. Also, it was a tool that could be used with the cards they release still. Expansions are made in advance but then why nerf it at that point. I'm basically begging people to just explain why my perception about equality is wrong if they disagree. I'm not fighting someone here.
---
Tiny fraction of cards that are playable until they are deemed inconsistent ...
---
The reaction here is obviously related to the cost issues, seems as fair a place as any to bring up the actiblizz greed.
---
Mogu Fleshshaper

People are sleeping on it. Super nutty card for Quest/Overload/Aggro Shamans which auto wins you all the games vs other tempo decks. Between Hunter, Rogue and Shaman, there is so much minion spam that you will get it for free around t3-4 which is an insane tempo swing those decks probably cant deal with. Think about how strong sea giant is in spam vs spam decks. This card comes out even earlier and has an immediate board impact. Disgusting.

Ehh but the lackeys are better than 1 mana cards. it‚Äôs like if you discover frostbolt off magic trick. Would you count frostbolt as half a card?

And people usually downvote me, when I'm saying here (or at other hs subreddits) that Blizzard are laziest company which cares only about money. There is no way full time working team couldn't achieve this goals for 5 years. It's lack of funding, lack of care, lack of interest.
---
Thank you kind strager for this picture, I will save it to repost it 3 years later.
---
It‚Äôs actually straight up better than Boom. I know I‚Äôm going to be downvoted for this, but only microbots and sometimes drone delivery are better, most of the time this is better AND more consistent, and that‚Äôs if you only summon 1 4/3. If you summon 2 it becomes miles better than Boom. The problem is that everyone is looking at Warrior as a control class, and not just a class.
---
Boom is better for control, but the quest is better than Boom, and it even has more consistency in that you always start with it, and you always summon a 4/3, where with Boom you sometimes just deal 1 damage to the enemy hero.
---
I used to play a Druid deck that had nothing but cards that gives you armor. No win condition tho.
---
It ended up being that they could end a turn with five Shudderwocks, aka 30 damage, but I was being healed by Mistress of Mixtures and ending up with 3 armor per turn. IIRC there were a couple of times I had low health, but those were the turns I‚Äôd kill a Shudderwock and get fully healed. I‚Äôve already repressed some of it haha
---
You need to construct additional pylons.
---
At that point they become essentially direct damage and very hard to balance.
---
Djinni of Zephyrs was a LoE adventure card, so refunds wouldn‚Äôt really apply here anyways. I guess it would‚Äôve been nice though.
---
Johnnypark#11512, NA you go first.
---
F for our much deserved and needed achievement system
---
I mean, replace the lackeys and shark with lich kings, sneeds and rags and maybe you have a point. Turn 8 is pretty late game for a wild deck.
---
While these are very cool: fuck card backs.        
---
Useless rewards that we can‚Äôt even really showcase
---
Is it possible to learn this power?

Do you really? Is that automatic?

You rocked it man, great costume!
---
Planning on saving gold until the next expansion. Is this wise? I'm P2W on a budget.
---
Silence pleb, if you want your opinion to count, be a streamer with a million followers.
---
But seriously the game has slowly been sliding downhill in that little by little every new release is less exciting because the meta is set in stone at the very least, one week after release, and after that you can play the few viable decks until you burn out in them, then try a few fun but unviable decks, burn out on them, and just play to complete quests until the next expansion. Also each new expansion seems to cost more then the last.
---
How would this effect [[blastmaster boom]]
---
&gt; Try something like Zephyrus in a physical TCG.
---
What? That's very easy', in fact, it's easier and stronger.
---
You just let the player add any card he wants from outside of the game to his hand, just like the Yu Gi Oh Duelist of the Roses mechanic:
---

I can understand where you're coming from, but this effectively destroys Blastmaster Boom and makes it pointless.

Ny question is: What happened?
---
I mean, wasn't that one of the perfect opportunities for it to appear, aside from the 1 floating Mana? Two of the enemies had Reborn, one had Deathrattle and one had an ongoing, persistent effect. All three sound like "buffed" minions to me that need to be "debuffed", AKA Silenced.
---
Does the game not consider Deathrattles as "buffed" cards, the same way a minion was actually buffed with, say a Spikeridged Steed?
---

Kilbler and Shiro are the some of the best parts of hearthstone! Why don‚Äôt they have a card yet?!

It's in the sidebar mate - roughly 17 hours from now
---
Also how often are immune or take 1 damage at a time even present lol
---
(I‚Äôm not entirely sure what you said but I‚Äôm pretty sure you meant classes/races that aren‚Äôt compatible in WoW) I put them there so it‚Äôs easiest to see what is the most likely to be received, it‚Äôs not necessarily saying that we are more probable to get a Draenei rogue because they‚Äôre both lacking, it‚Äôs just highlighting the fact that they both are lacking. I honestly would love to see someone like Yrel take the place of hearthstones Draenei, however being that we already have so many paladins it‚Äôs kind of unlikely. We could totally get an undead rogue though, which would be awesome and very befitting.

bloodfen is Zephyrs, arcane golem is dune sculptor, boulderfist oger is reno, corehound is siamat
---
You play Pyro, heal yourself, Play Zephrys and guaranteed to get fireball, fireball face, hit face. That's it.
---
I think reborn didn't even need an effect, it should be treated like a normal deathrattle. Maybe they could have made the deathrattle symbol a bit spooky and it would be fine.
---
My guess is it will be the mid-cycle card released, like Sn1p-Sn4p was.
---
You keep going against facts. If there's someone who knows what each class's identity is supposed to be like, that's Blizzard.
---
Not trusting their idea of class identity doesn't make much sense, because they choose what an idea of class identity is supposed to be. Plus, I believe they're making a very good choice of representing each class with their strengths and weaknesses. Rogues don't have aoe, priests don't have face damage, warriors have very little card draw, mages don't buf their minions etc.
---
&gt; idk if i would really consider this idea of bomb warrior to be face damage spells.
---
It's literally "Battlecry: do x damage to the enemy hero". When you send bombs in the enemy decks, 90+% of the time they already have one. Especially if you have equipped Wrenchcalibur and/or have Elekk on the board.
---
I'm getting a bit more aggressive because you're ignoring objective facts.
---
Hagatha for a hand full of spells + Shudderwock for the battlecry again seems pretty sweet!
---
It seems like Zephyr usually gives offensive options for lethal, not defensive options like flare
---
KT scaled nightmare simulator
---
This is amazing art!
---
And I too can't wait for tomorrow, I have so many decks I want to try and keep changing my mind on which one to try first.
---
The heartbreaking thing to me is Hearthstone is leaching developers from some of the other Blizzard games and still does close to nothing. It's pretty pathetic.
---
Wild Growth isn't played because now it's not a card you paly in literally every single druid deck. It's a card that you can afford to play only in some decks, and those don't exist in the current meta for different reasons. Aggro druid decks aren't supposed to ramp and Druid is palyed exclusively as an aggro class rn.
---
My friend texted me this morning about this. Shame that it happened to some people.
---
Your account is 3 min older than your post.

that enrage warrior is spicy
---
dude, why are you being so toxic? im just trying to have a friendly debate. everyone else has been able to make their points without being an ass. and auto-lose is a hyperbole, i thought that was clear. and actually, highlander cards kind of are meant to be the main way to win games. that's why there's a huge deck restriction around them. it may be less obvious with the new cards, but it's more clear when you think about the original highlander set. and the point im trying to make is that it's unfair that a certain deck doesnt even have to try at all to completely counter the two best cards in your opponent's deck, two cards that also require a very large deck restriction.
---
Made 4200 since the announcement. Friends list is on farm. :)
---
"Why silence all these minions when you can kill them?  It't not like silencing that taunt will get you lethal."
---
In all seriousness, I'm not sure if Zephrys actually knows about the Egg's deathrattle, or figured it wasn't a threat since Thijs is at nearly full health.
---
That's three (since you forgot Bash) cards out of five years worth of card design, all three of which are from the very early stages of the game.
---
That's hardly anything compared to the direct damage spells.
---
May have been in the pool of cards he could discover there but got unlucky
---
Not to mention I'm sure there's MORE ways they can spice it up or make it more interesting. Hearthstone's a multi million dollar game, it can come up with more variety than just dungeon run
---
By the way we made a couple small hot fixes to Zephrys today including changing when you get weapon destruction (Harrison) to be more accurate and Silences/Mass Dispel will appear at the right time more often.
---
Maybe if Silencing them would either prevent opponent lethal, or grant player lethal, neither of which was the case.
---
Murloc Raider. Coming from MtG, 1-mana 2/1's were historically insanely powerful, and I thought the murloc tag was a massive upside.
---
Murlocs *were* pretty good in beta, but Murloc Raider wasn't really part of that...
---
&gt;"Doesn't have to try at all to completely counter"
---
Yea dude this is why I'm not bothering with treating this like an informed discussion.
---
Every idiot on the run has noticed. Are you gonna post tomorrow about the lackey?
---
i dont disagree with their entire concept of class identity, im saying theyve done a poor job representing it and keeping it accurate in many cases. for example, i remember the point being made that shaman wasnt supposed to have good card generation, but they have great card generation currently, some of the best in the game. and bombs already are battlecry: deal x damage to the enemy hero, it just isnt immediate. and there's no good reason to keep it aggressive. keep it civil, man. i dont see anything im saying as ignoring objective facts, im sorry if you see it that way.
---
I started playing MTG Arena on Christmas Day and my god, Bo3 with sideboard is just amazing. I can't believe Hearthstone never had this.
---
I think I'd play HS again if they brought it in. I haven't played since Rumble, but... I dunno, I still have a love for it deep down.
---
Warrior Quest.  Not OP I guess, but Warrior has a coherent tempo deck now and the Quest synergizes perfectly with Overseer's Whip.  I think it will be a deck, which is a lot more than other people think.
---
I thought the reasoning was because they had been nerfing the aggro cards and the basic set and had left the control cards untouched so they needed to bring the power level down to match the other nerfs

Haha I mean I used to love Hearthstone and then took a huge break, came back last expansion and loved it and so far this expansion also looked fun so I was debating going all out or nah and wanted to know the thoughts of others although ended up getting the cheaper version
---
Yeah plus I basically only play hunter so I don't really need the ridiculous amount of cards for other classes
---
Secret mage, it's like the ultimate mind game
---
If there is something that's become clear to me, it's to never underestimate "Army in a Can" cards and Tip the Scales is one of those. In my theorycrafts I legit run Finley with no plans to use his battlecry just because having a 2/3 murloc is better than the other options.

The fact that it‚Äôs so hard for the cards to move up or down a bucket makes initial bucketing by Blizzard the most important process in balancing the arena. Frankly they have all the tools but it is obvious that these tools (initial manual bucketing, microadjustment, manual rebucketing) that can improve the arena experience is severely underused and misused. Please notice us, u/iksarHS
---
Yep! Probably did about 5 or six of them through the month
---
 I just disagreed with you and you started crying about how I hurt your feelings. You don't have to lie to kick it fam. It's okay. You're a sensitive little deary and I should have let you down easy.

That's okay pumpkin. That was a great idea, but the adults don't really need your helpful imagination right now. Try again though, maybe your next fix will make it to the fridge!
---
(See now I'm being rude, because you're doing this whole victim thing, so why not?)

It's not. OP installed Android on their Switch, allowig him to play HS and in the process, bricking his console into a very very bad and overpriced tablet.

I will be playing Armor Druid in wild. Honestly people should concede once I gain 1252 armor.
---
I was doing spitball math on this today, and the average quest being 50g and you playing 10 games every day at a 50% win-rate means that you will have, over 120 days, 4500 gold from quests and another 2k from wins.
---
Seeing a number lower than 6500, especially after the fire festival which gave out way more gold, means that you didn't really play that much and missed quite a few quests.
---
If you get 100 gold a day on average (quest + playing for 3-ish hrs), you should have about 12000 gold saved up. I am at 7k having missed about 6 weeks of playing intensively and missing quite a few quests.
---
My conclusion has always been the same - if you don't start from 0, you can play HS for free on the margin (meaning free as far as new cards go) as long as you actually play HS. 70 packs doesn't get you very far, but it gives you a solid base of Commons and Rares that the few gaps you need to fill will be quite easy to find the dust for.

priest isn't struggling to heal; it's struggling to tae 12 damage.

BWSnake#1746 NA Trading 80g quest I show you go first :)
---
Embalming Ritual is a really good card and I haven't seen *anyone* talking about it.  Priest now has access to the burst warlock had with the Thaurissan + leeroy combo, with less setup.
---
Leeroy + embalming + wretched reclaimer is 18 dmg for 9 mana, and reclaimer and embalming are both good standalone cards.  Don't need to combo win against aggro? Wild pyro loves embalming ritual.  Use the combo on your Zilliax to break aggro's back. Cast ritual on one of your guys, trade everything in, cast vargoth.  
---
Card is sleeper IMO.
---
Pshh. I wish priest would struggle to take damage. The game's gotta end somehow
---
Yeah I didn't really play at all other than if it was to complete quests, definitely didn't miss any of them though! Busy with Uni/internships/work. I definitely think it's possible to be F2P!

8/5/6 Beast | Battlecry: Deal 5 damage.  
---
Thanks mdonais!
---
I'm hoping the new card that swaps the top card on each deck helps in the matchup. It should activate your highlander card when applicable.
---
Up to now there is only one single game mode that is being continuously developed which is standard constructed. Wild constructed and limited are ignored. Streamers seem to have a hard time entertaining viewers and motivate themselves. Tournaments are monotonous. Are they still wondering why viewership goes down season by season?
---
Pretty much every deck i make
---
It can be upside too, acolyte of pain on turn 3.
---
Only Classic and Basic cards are offered.
---
Just check YouTube and twitch for all the major streamer testing the deck. They all had different varieties but basically they got the quest off by turn 5 and at that point every turn is more and more board floods with reborn/mechs.
---
You know a deck is a broken when the streamers stop laughing and start getting worried that the card already needs a nerf on day 1.
---
Hogger still insane.
---
I really don't know how people can miss the link between re-using characters and mechanics and it being the 5th year of hearthstone.
---
Usually every 5  years is a milestone that calls for celebration. To me, I just see this whole year as a celebration of hearthstone.
---
I have no issue with reusing characters and mechanics. This year, considering everything, they get a pass. Next year, let's talk about this seriously if it is still an issue.
---
If you were counting money 24/7. You probably wouldn't give a shit either.
---
Oh, you are completely correct. Let me edit that. Thank you.
---
I find it bizarre that people actually spend money on this game when the devs and the designers obviously do next to nothing that we want.
---
Reno was great
---
I try to run Hakkar in almost every control deck play.
---
Spell Paladin? Sometimes he doesn‚Äôt hit that 25 to face . Hakkar will ensure one of us dies faster .
---
Burgle Rogue? I got a bunch of random stuff in my deck , but it‚Äôll be bigger than yours...and when that blood hits, it‚Äôll hit hard.
---
Bomb Warrior? My version isn‚Äôt about those silly rush cards ...it‚Äôll hurt you , it‚Äôll hurt you deep. ( it‚Äôs also wildly inconsistent ever since I decided to cheese in the 10 summon a copy of a minion from your deck )
---
Mage? A 1 mana 9/6 is pretty spicy 
---
Rafaam Warlock? Who doesn‚Äôt want more legendaries 
---
Shaman? Whether it‚Äôs muck morpher cheese or the spell that summons him from the hand , I‚Äôll introduce you to a new friend .
---
Hunter? If I had more dust I‚Äôd run one with some nine lives but Hunter typically doesn‚Äôt struggle with death.
---
If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail!

---
Imagine having deal 3 heal 3 as hero power and replacing it.
---
I quit playing after MSoG. So glad I did, the lack of updates and care for making a complete experience makes it pretty obvious it's just money grubbing Blizzard/Activision at this point.
---
I think the Quest is going to change that. If there's one thing they have, it's a ton of Battlecry synergy. Being able to do that twice for your entire turn for 2 mana is going to be nuts from a burn or value scale. Hagatha Hero card may be benched, which says a lot.
---
But hey, we got cosmetics
---
top notch stache TBH

And Harrison Jones.

Mecha'thun/Zoo Warlock will be a tier 1 deck and so will Bomb Warrior as a result.

Be honest you can tell just from the art
---
my proudest fap
---
I mean you could tell also from the expansion logos
---
But it's not difficult to understand, that if you are interested in getting your player base back, you probably need to push the game's limits way higher...
---
You throw in old mechanichs, ok. But you should give more support to them (ex. Highlander) instead of making worthless pack filling legendaries, especially in a crysis period like this.
---
This choices are very risky now, imho.
---
Malygeese :D
---
True, you're killing hand size, but many argue, you just keep the quest for a cyclone turn.
---
Murmy will break wild
---
You‚Äôre thinking about it all wrong. You don‚Äôt have to play a highlander deck if you just draw your entire deck before your combo!
---
It's definitely powercreep. Hunter and Paladin might be two different classes, but Subdue adjust both the Attack *and* health of a minion to 1, while Hunter's mark only adjusts the health, for the same amount of mana.
---
Advantages include being able to leave a Subdued minion on the board instead of clearing it immediately (for example, you'll usually use both of these on a large minion, such as \[\[King Krush\]\] or something similar. If you can't kill Krush after using Hunter's mark on him, he can punch you for 8 damage on your opponent's turn. Meanwhile, you don't need to kill him right away while he's Subdued because he can only deal 1 damage instead of 8.
---
Considering both cards cost 2 mana and the effect of Subdue is strictly better (in the vast majority of cases) than Hunter's Mark, it is absolutely powercreep.

9/8/8 Beast | Charge  
---
There are few reasons why fleshshaper can be better than giants therefore warrant seeing play.
---
1) Fleshshaper is 3 mana cheaper which is a lot. Situations where sea giant will be 6 mana fleshshaper will be 3 which makes him a lot more playable when youre playing against a deck with a lot of clears. 
---
2) It has rush so you can immediately get a good trade in.
---
3)We have the quest now. Quest makes every "summon x" type ability to trigger twice, which makes going wide much easier and allows you to play fleshshaper or giants faster. Honestly with the quest being a thing sea giants might return to shaman
---
Before the cat, many rouge players were consider jar dealer for combo activator.
---
Oh... the playful sprites guy. He comes one day in each expansion with his gang and prevent everyone from playing for several hours
---
Will ranked season reset too? Just started playing again yesterday and wanted to get season chest before it reset. Or maybe I misunderstand how that works.
---
I mean in 2018 it hit 100 million registered players. It‚Äôs safe to assume the game is still in the 10‚Äôs of millions of active players. It‚Äôll be the most popular game on Twitch tomorrow. So it may have peaked in 2018 but it‚Äôs not dead by means.
---
Yeah, it is a better stated titanic lacky.

If you have multiple bombs in your deck, can Tortollan Primalist show bombs as 2 or 3 of the options? Hopefully they have to be unique.

Isn‚Äôt it safe to expand on beloved ideas that are game defining. Hero Powers&gt;Quests&gt;Most other Legendaries.

---
Maybe mecahtun pally could be a thing?
---
Holy wraith Paladin is super favored against mage. The particular matchup is a huge reason to play the deck.
---
The card Anka is obviously ridiculous, the problem is that you need a good Deathrattle deck to go with it, which is much more doubtful atm.

Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt
---
People absolutely realize the potential, but i think a lot of people are just overrating the quest reward. 0 cost cards are good, but drawing more cards when you've already drawn a bunch is not that great. The warlock quest looked pretty weak in the pre-release streams. I think the deck will stay inconsistent until blizzard gives warlock a way to tutor plot twist. The deck falls completely flat if you don't draw a plot twist relatively early. A minion that draws a 2-cost spell from your deck would be a great addition.
---
I think desert spear is better than what others are predicting, but i also think if i want to play desert spear i want to use its strongest synergy, being masters call and dire frenzy. You can desert spear on 3, swing on 4 and summon a locust and immediately dire frenzy it,shuffling 3 1 mana 4-4 beasts with rush and then tutor it out with call. So i think the best place for a card like this is an all beast, quest hunter type deck where i can get the synergy both from it summoning 3 minions and the fact that its summoning 1/1 beast rushers.
---
yes
---
High Inquisitor is good. Onyxia rarely ever sees play in top tier decks. It‚Äôd be better if you could shoot for a class Legendary. They all see play regularly besides Warlock and Shaman.
---
You don't even need the quest. I've seen boar control pull of" some nutty things. The deck is just delay with taunts and heals with the new reborn stuff can be done a lot easier.
---
Honestly, a second Vilebrood Skitterer seems perfectly reasonable. Otherwise you're probably just looking for any midrange or big beast to replace her.
---
I mean... Quests are ok.
---
But I dont think Zephrys will be enough to make Highlanders stick in the meta. They should've added something more to support the archetype, especially for EVIL Classes.
---
ooh, stop it you - I am gonna blush! :D

---
SzaQ#2683 80g quest share, EU
---
Sorry bud already finished
---
No quest. You win from death rattle and board filling value. Kibler's deck is a good example of how to play it.
---
I just don't see how a game like this can ever really be competitive. Try a deck building game for a more competitive feel.
---
Turns out it IS possible in get but your need to start over.
---
Casual has mmr, if you are facing nothing but netdecks it means that you were using netdeck too in the past or are exceptionally good player that keeps &gt;=50% winrate in junk vs netdeck games.
---
Can't wait to see the flavour text
---
Eh, perhaps not the only skill...  but as an old school CCG player, I find deck building to be one of if not the most important skill.
---
I find netdecking stagnates games and actually hurts them in the long run.
---
But that's neither here nor there.  As I said, I understand why people do it, even if my opinion towards the subject isn't very kind, and do not condemn people for doing it...  
---
Just find it highly boring to face an opponent and know after seeing a couple cards, or even just their damned hero...   And knowing exactly what to expect...
---
Last couple actually. A bit of queue to get in but no DCs and no lag. And having it at 7pm instead of past midnight feels good.
---
you*
---
Knowing what your opponent is going to play is not equivalent to having an answer for it. Turn 5 flood the board with aggressively statted minions in an aggro deck can be GG by itself.
---
Also, theoretical immediate threat of 14 damage with 2x [[Murloc Warleader]], 2x [[Bluegill Warrior]] and 1x [[Grimscale Oracle]], so it's not always a "5 mana with no immediate impact".
---
It's a strong card with the mana cheating, but I sadly don't think the meta will allow it to see play. Warrior has 4 cards that answer it on T5, which in and of itself may well kneecap Murloc Paladin/this card's viability, since it doesn't have the strong refill of Token Druid/Murloc Shaman. It's the very definition of an all-in play; time will tell just how that pans out.
---
So when does it launch in Moscow?
---
When he was released there weren't any big spells that benefitted from his effect unfortunately

In wild, if bomb warrior makes the leap it's not unreasonable at all really. Decks are allowed to have counters.

I actually think it has real potential in mech bomb hunter. Just snip snap alone can give you 9 ticks of progression towards the quest. Explodinator another 3. Flatk another 5 and these are just the cards I  can think of off the top of my head with a bit of tweaking it could be even better. Skipping turn 1 isn't the worst thing either, mecharoo is the only 1 mana minion the deck runs witch gives extra ticks of progression towards the quest btw. The hero power just puts your opponent in a real awkward spot too clear the bombs take damge, don't clear the bombs take even more damage.
---
Why are you rank 20 ?
---
Better art than the original from SoU, lol. Cheers

Outjerked again
---
It‚Äôs a card game where you do literally nothing. No skill. No thought. Nothing. You‚Äôre just some shmuck putting cards in play as they come within mana and basic common sense constraints. 
---
People play this game ‚Äúcompetitively‚Äù. There‚Äôs esports. A ranking system. 
---
It costs exorbitant amounts of money to keep playing. The user base has largely left, and its blizzard milking the same pool of shmucks every 3 months. 
---
And those who did leave, all left to play a game where you do equally as little in a deluded ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù format. Auto chess.
---
Why? Because this is the dumbest community in existence. Not hyperbole. Not exaggeration. Hearthstone players have officially passed construction workers as the dumbest segment of the human population.

---
Well, this is the second time they've done it, and they've intensified it since last expansion. Hope it doesn't become a habit.
---
Interesting thought, because he only uses info that both players know about so no cards that you have in your hand. But your opponent can know you still have the coin in your hand, right? They probably coded him to not check which cards are in your hand at all, but it would be really cool if he could take into account cards like the coin, broodmother, flame leviathan etc.

I agree that the hunter quest might be slept on. Bomb hunter could make use of it, it has 1 turn one play so this would help it do something on 1. Between all of the summons and death rattles like snip snap, explodinator, and flark it can definitely help close games, bombs become bigger threats because you can pump up their attack.
---
It has, but I don't know how well it works when hs is losing interest of players. Wild especially could be susceptible to unfair pairing because player base is smaller. Btw. Tavern brawl has mmr too.
---
Evasion is also played in Maly rogue, although it‚Äôs a very off-meta counter deck

In a data driven world I imagine they have the way to check your overall arena winrate. So when they finally decide to do the rebucketing it would be nice if they at least didn't take into consideration picks of players who lose more than win, because they clearly have no idea what they are doing.

what archetypes does big priest push out of the meta? the meta in hearthstone has always been balanced by decks like big priest that beat control but lose to aggro. without them what would be left? just control farming aggro, which quickly removes aggro from the meta too leaving only control mirrors.
---
[[King Phaoris]]. Board fill minion. People thought N'zoth was the weakest god card. Filling a board with him proved them all wrong, concidered the best god and most played god card nowadays. Bloodreaver Guldan was also getting shit becaus hur dur only doomguard is good demon in standard. Well we saw pretty quick that was wrong to. And that was before K&amp;C.
---
Seems nuts on a deck with good amount of spells. Especially controll type of deck like Mage (or Priest in some expansions).
---
But I think it will be extremely good on Druid if there quest becomes popular enough. Some complain Druid doesn't have many 8+ spells. No shit, but does that really matter as a druid? You want a full boar eatherway unless it's a Aviana or Mechathun combo.

10/5/5 | Battlecry: For each spell in your hand, summon a random minion of the same Cost.  
---
Casino mage, two variants, as many random effects as possible.
---
The "competitive" one has some decent control support cards, and revolves around witchwood Piper and yogg.
---
The pure rng has only cards that discover or give random cards. Malchezaar, yogg, Elise, Cabalists time, rag, etc
---
Do you really see it as being that much better than Divine Shield?
---
classic
---
Inner Fire combo priest.
---
Was very popular here in Serbia.
---
I really hope you mean the cartoon one though :)
---
You are wrong, he was going OP with elixir but the druid was denying him, as he had fallen into it as a kid.
---
Best classic legendary by far

Qameow#1201 NA looking to trade 80g. You go first but I'll show mine beforehand :)

I am fully aware :-). I will probably craft at least five legendaries to reach that 15.
---
Porta#2434 - EU 
---
80g quest trade - I show, you go first (check my history, I am not a scammer).
---
they should have released it at 2 AM or so in US so they can have when they wake up and so could us
---
Is there a point in opening that many? I opened 163 and got all commons and rares, most of epics and half of legendaries - I'll propably have more than enough dust from those to craft missing ones.
---
(yes, 163, you read it right, there were some payment shenanigans and I got double pre-order packs, support said it's fine and to enjoy)
---
Oger is still OP. No card is anywhere near as sexy.
---
Evro#2609 EU, you first. I have traded here at least 5 times.
---
Yeahhhhhh imma get up probably 6ish so i can buy packs with gold on my pc, open them on the train ride into work on my phone, then weep until the end of the day.
---
No you don‚Äôt know how to evaluate the legendaries you got. You got some of the best legendaries at low ranks. Sure once you get to rank 15 or so you will see more refined decks that will make you want to play more of the net decks but currently the cards you got allow you to play a board centric value game and this should allow for you to have a greater than 70% win rate to rank 15 and make it all the way to rank 10
---
Tesspionage with a pinch of Lackeys and Zarog's Crown
---
Daily quest and Legendary quest are not connected in any way. 
---
Well ... if i go to sleep before 8 pm, then next day i will get a legendary quest and a daily. But I'm pretty sure i can handle that tremendous task of not falling asleep after 8 pm.
---
Millrogue, without a doubt
---
Since when?
---
Is the update out?
---
just play arena and get that in dust instead and you craft whatever you want day 1 instead of slogging thru hundreds of packs (although i guess its fun to open packs so maybe just do you)
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you (came back after a long HS ‚Äòbreak‚Äô).I‚Äôm conflicted whether to purchase 28 packs (preferably RoS) or purchase the whole wing. I have two accounts anyway so I‚Äôll save up gold on my alt account for Dalaran Heist and 28 packs on my more competitive main account. 
---
Dalaran Heist is fun as people say. Zayle can help you form a complete deck if you don‚Äôt have one.
---
Razakus priest. Aka machine gun priest. I know it was op but it was so satisfying to play.
---
But all i want is:
---
1. Unity.   
---
2. Precision.   
---
3. Perfection.
---
It releases 12 noon Central time, Idk what timezone you're in but you should be able to figure it out from there
---
I already have Zayle, so I don‚Äôt really care about Golden Zayle (except maybe for dust if you can dust it), so I think i‚Äôll probably go for packs
---
Think positive. You will never ever pull him again (as long as you don't disenchant him).
---
&gt; Do you want decks like inner fire priest to be able to bring back massively buffed minions?
---
Sure, why not? Most buffs are shit and not worth using anyway. And there's always the option to silence the buffed minion, either before or after, since most resurrected minions wont have charge. That said divine spirit needs a nerf either way.
---
I feel like the link to the launch timer should be the relevant link for the original post, not the link to Twitter.
---
Thanks for that.
---
Renolock
---
I've been having the same problems and I'm running off of WiFi at home. It's extremely frustrating.
---
Damn that sucks. I used to watch him 3 years ago (before face reveal even) and his videos were the funniest. He will be missed.
---
I'd have to agree with Squash here, honestly. Blink Fox is a very strong card that saw a ton of play in multiple different rogue decks. I'd consider it a 4-star card. The reason being that it doesn't fit the criteria for the 5-star rated cards mentioned in this thread:
---
It wasn't meta defining, people didn't build their decks around this card &amp; it wasn't a staple in all rogue decks.
---
That being said, this could've been settled in a much less condescending way. People can provide examples &amp; try to get others to see from their point of view without being rude, but I digress.
---
This. For new players doing the 50-25 grind, legendary cards aren‚Äôt going to make or break your experience. They‚Äôre cherry on top stuff at that level. It‚Äôs much more important to learn resource management, hand reading and appropriate board control / minion trading.
---
Pick a class (mage and hunter are good for beginners) and play as much as you can with those, learning basic strategies and deckbuilding skills. The cards will come.
---
What server
---
No
---
But you can open packs?
---
it's still excisting no? only one legendary of the same name allowed?
---
Tinkmaster is way too strong as neutral removal. All that needs to be done is printing a new card that gives the opponent bad minions while being useful enough to not be a terrible card in other matchups.
---
Typically on very understated bodies. My point is this cards would become either exact copies of those or become unbalanced, you're no longer opening design space.  With nightblade 3 face damage on a stick is priced at about 1.5 mana. That's a huge shift for any of the existing bomb cards.
---
Android is running of an SD, so easy to reboot back into the standard Switch loader. I'm planning to have a separate SD just for Android which I can swap out.
---
EU
---
Oh damn, so I lost my chance, right..
---
I know it's super old now, but.. Handlock. You know, back when *one* 8/8 on turn 4 was considered a threat. Psh, modern decks with their fancy *two* 8/8s on turn 5. Back in my days..!
---
It was just super fun and challenging to play. Not only did you have to consider your hand size at all times for Mountain Giants, but you also had to use your health as an active resource in every game thanks to Molten Giants. Often times your main goal was to *lose as much health as possible as quickly as possible*.
---
Yet, at the same time, not lose so much health that you will die the next turn. Which, in turn, meant you had to know exactly how much damage your opponent could to do you at any given time (and this was at a time where all kinds of decks had all kinds of burst damage, yet there were barely any OTK decks).
---
And then there was the mirror, which usually felt like some kind of game of chess. You need to lose health quickly to play your Moltens before the other guy, but that's your opponent's game plan, too. Which often meant that neither was actually attacking the other with the minions they had on board. Which you didn't want to play because you could draw your Mountain Giant. ..but you didn't want to play more than one Giant at a time because of Shadowflame. Also, while you wanted to lose health, at the same time you didn't want to tap too much because the game was almost guaranteed to go into fatigue, and being one or two turns closer to it than your opponent meant almost certain death. It was all surprisingly tricky and loads of fun to play.

Mean tbf ..... when i was seeing cards released i would theorycraft a battlecry shaman because shaman is my main class and have most the cards so i like to top up and create a good shaman deck 
---
Seeing streamers play with their early access i realised like 20/30 cards i thought be great in the deck were used by streamers. 
---
So does that mean if i go in with my own crafted deck, youre just gonna think i cant think for myself because good can be identified by multiple people 
---
Casual is more than playing bad decks.
---
This might have been a stupid answer
---
If on NA: ShadowKiller#12566
---
That's what the innkeeper is there for.
---
Decent opener, but I prefer turn 2 coin &gt; Thekal &gt; Molten Giant &gt; molten Giant for 19/20 worth of stats on board on turn 2
---
The last thing this game needs is more hero cards..
---
Completed with me
---
I was actually going to mention handlock. I never played the deck but watching it at the pro level was always so fun.
---
Shadow Essence also creates copies of minions from the deck, just like Barnes.
---
Wdym?

[[Tracking]] shows multiple bombs, though.

1/-/- | Look at the top 3 cards of your deck. Draw one and discard the others.  
---
As all things should be
---
On your side of the board, yes.
---
I feel that this is the way the game *should* work, with a visible graveyard and discard pile on top, but what you're suggesting is huge changes to the game's mechanics and flow to a company that have taken 5+ years to bring out an official tournament mode.
---
Plus on top of that they're very aware that their main playerbase only plays for very small windows infrequently and doesn't keep up with any changes (why they prioritise nerfing mana costs because it's the most obvious change) and this is a very large change to the game as a whole that only benefits wild since standard's balance is designed with the current system in mind.
---
From a game dev perspective this is one of those things that seems like a simple and easy fix but it would likely be the biggest change to the game they've ever done mechanically and it likely wouldn't be received very well.
---
If you're at a Fireside Gathering yes, hence the yellow icon on the top left of OP screenshot.
---
Press L to pay respects.
---
Though in saying that , it can work in your favour if you have transformation cards (so basically mage and shaman) 
---
As you hex a big thing, not only does it get rid of the big thing from the res pool but adds a frog. 
---
Do that twice and the frog is the most common outcome. 
---
Then theres 3 frogs ready for the next res.
---
Quest decks
---
Maybe odd quest too in warlock
---
That's a really poor way of evaluating a card like this. Obviously this kind of a card would make other Reborn cards better.
---
It‚Äôs big brain time boys
---
D; Noooooo! My fun deck is ruined!!!
---
Pens all the way
---
It works
---
What about cloaked huntress secret hunter?
---
Think of the cards created by Bob in the newest single-player content.  It's a completely different card.
---
I only know about these two characters because I took 3 years of french class, how big are they?
---
On this note I think Face rogue will be really good this expac.
---
New good 1 drops
---
An 8 dmg 3 mana weapon
---
The new plague maybe
---
All the usual strong fast rogue cards like backstab deadly poison evis and edwin.
---
And sandtrooper like you mentioned.
---
This will be the first deck I try and I think it will kill people real good.
---
I live in Colorado so they‚Äôd be real
---
Awaken the Makers for sure. I played loads during Witchwood and then again during Rumble when I couldn't bear anymore Odd and Even decks.
---
By the end of the rotation, there were a few of different builds you could make with Mechs like Pinata, Ringer, Zilliax and even the new Shredder if you wanted to go way outside the box. The Dragon package was strong as well of course with Duskbreaker being so broken. 
---
It defied fatigue with Archbishop and then with Seance and Zola/Banker you just keep setting your health to 40. Man, I loved that deck.
---
I still disenchanted it the moment it rotated.
---
Last time we were not, so we expect all quest cards to be not part of the arena, including the neutral card that interacts with them (since C'Tun cards are also not available in arena). As far as I know there is no official announcement by Blizzard regarding this but people were not able to draft quest cards during the early access streams.
---
ThTs kinda what I‚Äôm thinking also
---
Blunts&gt;pens
---
lol I think that‚Äôs the choice tbh
---
I mean you could get a friend and you both make a classic Handlock deck and play against each other
---
French here. No need to say, but when a new book of the serie is released, it makes one of the titles in the TV newscasts. I got all my albums from when I was a kid, and now my kids read them. :)
---
I know I just I havnt been keeping up with it like I used to and I work a lot and stuff so I dunnooooooo
---
Quest Tess Rogue for sure
---
Reno shudderwock shaman
---
Naw I know I have trees tho already
---
That's great, but in a week I will have forgotten it and the next time I will need the knowledge is who knows how long away. They are pretty hard to keep apart if you're not used to needing it every day.
---
Decklist needed
---
Hey u/adwcta, this is probably not the most relevant question, but why is Mortuary Machine's rating worse than Desert Obelisk's one ? I'm juste curious about how you algorithm works.  
---
Although the Machine's effect can be devastating (definitely worse than Fel Reaver), it's an 8/8 body, while Desert Obelisk is just a waste of 5 mana. Or do you explore all potential interactions (inner fire), which actually make it better than Mortuary Machine ?
---
No, because the cards are forever changed and you can't play with the old versions any more.
---
Give me some good software to do It easily and I could have some ideas :)
---
But give me also time :'(
---
What? No
---
I really like Fel Reaver Warlock
---
Ur gonna have fun opening the packs and then sad when you realize you got nothing u wanted, the pens last a month and make hearthstone way more fun
---
Are we not going to talk about op username?
---
What kind of engine/ai is on that 0/2 taunt?
---
I‚Äôm not necessarily saying Zephrys would be ran in Control Warrior, I‚Äôm just saying he has much more powerful applications than simply filling out a curve or providing a board clear. He can also function as a finisher, which is very powerful for a class like Warrior that often has to go for a passive fatigue strategy
---
Lucky you. Choice is easy then imo! Carts all the way üôÉ
---
Seems pretty solid, if you play it right. I could totally see myself holding this because I really want to drop the effect, rather than just playing it out as a 3/2 when you ought to.
---
I honestly don't know what the reborn aura looks like yet, I o ly know that its blue and invasive thanks to this sub. Guess I'll have to wait until tonight.
---
Same, but since 2015.
---
You can use Shadowstep and Pandas to get 4 perfect cards.
---
Fatty boy that can't have the threat he wants ?
---
Joke aside, that was mine too. I still have 2 cupboards full of those comics (Ast√©rix, Tintin, Gaston Lagaffe et tous les autres).
---
Sure thing. All goldens are on a separate pity timer. It's easier to see with epics. Pay attention as you crack your packs.
---
That's not true.  During their inn-vational tournament yesterday a Priest player (forgot his name) had potential lethal vs Trump's Hunter deck.  Zephyrs gave him the option to take Pyroblast, which the player obviously could not have played that turn.
---
The player had a Cairne on the board that he buffed to 10 attack with the Priest quest hero power.  He took windfury instead and his minion got destroyed by that new Hunter secret before he could attack lol
---
R/wooooosh but idk how many os go in
---
[That‚Äôs right!](https://m.imgur.com/r/HighQualityGifs/o81kzo8)
---
can do archmage vargoth with a mindblast or two for 10-15 damage burst from hand. it could happen
---
As I mentioned in a reply to someone else, I think Face rogue will be really good this expac:
---
New good 1 drops (Murmy, cat, maybe sidekick, maybe jar dealer)
---
Sandtrooper
---
Maybe some sticky reborn minions like temple berserker, candletaker, generous mummy even?
---
And sandtrooper
---
This will be the first deck I try and I think it will kill people real good. It will definitely take some tweaking though.
---
Quest Druid, Zoolock with a focus on lackeys and Tekahn, maybe Reno Hunter, Quest Rogue too I guess
---
Where did you hear that?
---
When will people stop with the Barnes meme? It's not a good card in big priest, it adds a 3/4 to the res pool and makes shadow essence worse.
---
That said, making them have the stats of the dead minion is not a good idea as there are way more decks than big priest that relies on resummoning dead minions and does't make the deck worse in any significant way, most minions just lose 3/3 and the only minion with more stats is Y'shaarj which will give more problems than just the stats, Rag still hits for 8 as well.

Everyone is trying out all these New quest decks and playing Control oriented decks.

*You used the wrong formula, but got the right answer.*
---
Blizzard servers will thank you.
---
Just release the expansion already!
---
Lmao yeah dude go for it
---
Whizbang.  Want to give the meta at least a week before spending dust.
---
Agreed.  I love the quests.
---
Blizzard could literally choose random proposition out of the few that keep floating here and it would be a positive change.
---
Hearthstone does absolutely track the graveyard, that's how res cards know what has died. Just like barnes summons a copy from the deck zone, res effects summon a copy from the graveyard zone. There is just no UI for the graveyard and all res effects are effectively "summon a copy" instead of "summon".
---
Incidentally this is also why things like Barne's 1/1 effect are lost, because this follows the usual rule that when cards move backwards through the normal zone flow, effects are removed.
---
3.5 hours from this post.
---
Except the mage opening beats yours. Mirror images and rays of frost keep your giants down, while the mage sets up their own BS or just rushes you down
---
Random target
---
Ah, true! I guess you would have to hold out and remember to not grab all the perfect cards in the same turn. A bit worried about duplicates, though. Gotta be careful having two Pandas in there.
---
Save tha mahknee, be blessed for the time being :) I got about same Gold let‚Äôs enjoy

Right? You could just use PW Shield and Stormwind Knight instead of Amet and Boar, it's already in the game. No one's doing it.
---
Not cheaper packs, but yes special quests
---
He's not as essential to BP as most ppl say he is, but saying that the deck is better without him is a rly bold claim.
---
Truth. But he‚Äôs also saved the best for last.
---
‚ÄúIt ended up being that they could end a turn with five Shudderwocks, aka 30 damage, but I was being healed by Mistress of Mixtures and ending up with 3 armor per turn. IIRC there were a couple of times I had low health, but those were the turns I‚Äôd kill a Shudderwock and get fully healed. I‚Äôve already repressed some of it haha‚Äù
---
Copied from another comment thread 
---
Tl:dr, shudderwock loop could only deal up to 30 damage a turn to a 33 hp opponent, and the process of shudderwock looping fully healed both players
---
Yeah that‚Äôs my logic. I would rather spend money on hearthstone then consumables that are used up just as fast as they are bought.

I wish. Out here on the east coast, iOS always updates way later, and people complain ‚Äúwhy is everyone able to play and I can‚Äôt?!‚Äù I will be pleasantly surprised if that is not the case. More likely, I will be fighting to stay awake just to munge together some Tier 6 deck while I fall asleep in the middle of my first game.

Great, another "Deal 2 damage" power

Is it really, though?

The art needs a heavy nerf
---
Yikes

No haha. Every time you press a key blizzard knows. This is some serious shit
---
why
---
Got me to rank 10 as well.
---
I started at rank 5 though
---
I've said it before and will say it again, Barnes is not the problem.  Look at Barnes in Big Rouge and Spell Hunter.  It does not auto-win you the game.  The auto-win in Big Priest is 2-mana resurrect.  That is the card people should be screaming for nerfs for.
---
&gt;Instant Win
---
 Instant Death
---
It's 50-50
---
*jaina voice* amazing
---
4 mana 7/7 is MUCH better than a 6 mana 9/9
---
I managed 3.5k but only saved since beginning of July! Gonna save hard for next expansion :D
---
Barnes isn't the problem in this deck. Eternal Servitude is. I actually like when they play Barnes because at least if I kill both Barnes and the cheated target I get a chance for him to whiff on the Resurrect. Eternal Servitude is just inevitability because they are going to be resurrecting exactly what they want.
---
Why are you simba?
---
oh yeah. forgot that it got rotated to standard. RIP
---
Same mentality I had. I say every $10 I spend I should enjoy the game for at least an hour. I'm pretty much done on the big spending, got most of what I needed to catch up on the old expansions and should have a good enough dust reserve to craft what I need this expansion.
---
I've definitely got my money's worth and rarely feel as let down compared to when I hosed my money on poker stars. For the rest of the way I'm only buying special bundles, solo adventures, and gold mining my way through the rest.
---
That looks like a fun deck. 3 flamestrikes? I can almost taste your opponent‚Äôs rage.
---
No computer or what?
---
Xice#1138 NA - Trading 80g quest - I will show - You go first.
---
Yeah Op is either new or is just cherry picking examples to fit his narrative. Cyclone Mage wasn't deemed to be good till like 2-3 weeks ago and it wasn't even discovered till half way through the expansion. Heal Zoo is a fantastic example aswell. We can't predict what the meta will be day 1, especially this expansion with how many archetypes there will be.
---
A 4/4 rush is good, but it doesn't advance your win condition against most decks. It can give you decent board trades, but I'd rather have something that directly helps me win the game (and which I can also use for board control if I need to).
---
As for a slow hunter deck: midrange hunter was tier 1 just a few weeks ago, and it's still really strong. That's not slow unless you're going for the OTK with timber wolves and tundra rhino, and you only do that against control decks where it's your best win condition.

2/4/4 | Battlecry: Enemy spells cost (0) next turn.  
---
I mistyped in my original comment. I meant:
---
As far as the game is concerned, why would this revived minion not have the text it had when it died? I think of the custom minions (like zombeasts) that revive with the text they had when they died. 
---
I think a better solution is to summon the actor, then place an enchantment on it. That way the effect is there when it‚Äôs alive, but the effect is gone when it is silenced or resurrected.
---
Oh God, I forgot they only crippled Patches after rotation. I‚Äôm guessing they are hoping to have games last at least 6-8 turns (and still be anyone‚Äôs game), which is why Giants and patches had to go. Barnes is currently deciding them by a turn 3 / turn 4 summon and a turn 4/ turn 5 Rez, which is why I think he could use a nerf like this one.
---
That was my plan as well. Catch up on what I missed and now saving up my gold. I‚Äôm only going to get bundles with hero‚Äôs and solo content. I love this game do spending doesn‚Äôt feel  like a waste. And pulse this pre order round I was lucky and pulled 10 legendaries.

TYSM for that haha I missed this comment!!

Oh it's definitely weird spending hours editing yourself into The Lion King. After having done it, I can confirm that.
---
True. It'd have a way to get back onto the board if another priest plagues you.
---
!remindme
---
I agree on the whole "BP is fine"-standpoint you're coming from, but I don't think Barnes original intent rly considered resummoning. He was meant to summon an actor pretending to be a different minion, a small guy who does what a minion in your deck does. This one still does that, what goes into the graveyard rly isn't important for the flavor of barnes.
---
Drinking alone is all I have left
---
Overload

Is there a way to get this decks in before release? Would like to set up a bunch of the ones I'm interested in and then see which ones I have completed after opening and give them a go.

I don't think this fixes much nowadays. This still allows the turn 4 14-15 in spell only decks, and imo the annoying thing in bp for midrange/control decks is the endless walls of unclearable high value shit from turn 7 on. Bp if they would still run him at all would just not play him versus control to not dillute their pool.
---
What does it mean then? We use data for most things for a reason. The fact some people throw a hissy fit that they lost to some deck and are frustrated at the moment of posting their opinion doesnt mean there is a problem that needs solving either, let alone anything "unhealthy" or nay other meaningless bullshit buzzword term that people use to pretend their opinion has more merit than just "i dont like it". 
---
Now i dont play wild, but balancing the game based on peoples emotional yelling on social media, on who shouts the loudest that something is "unhealthy", "toxic" or the fan favorite "limits design space" is the absolute worst possible way to go about it. Hearthstone has already had way too many nerfs based on little more than fads and emotional outbursts.
---
Agreed. This is similar to what u/Rettun1 suggested, which could certainly work instead of my proposition.
---
and that's the major issue is that they've just let it happen for so long now.
---
I don't know where they're getting this "People have fun with big priest" idea from, as I asked on reddit a while ago and the only impression I got is winrate.
---
And dat Kobold Lackey!
---
Blizzard allows a variety of applications (deck trackers and other add-ons) to integrate with hearthstone. My guess is that it has something to do with that too.
---
Drawing secrets is great because it stops you drawing secrets (at the start of each turn). Subject 9 is poorly statted but don't underestimate the tempo benefit of 1 mana secrets.
---
It does switch off a couple of secret-loving cards, but those weren't gonna be hugely powerful in the late game anyway. I would consider running both Subject 9 and Prince Liam, to hopefully play one of them fairly early and stop topdecking secrets. That said my experience is with Secret Hunter, not Paladin, so maybe I'm wrong here.
---
Hey like they said, free 400 dust
---
Damn bro good stuff! What luck I'm guessing you had 133 packs? I'ma be at around 120 with gold, Amazon coin, and bundle and I'm praying to God I pull 7
---
God I cant stand grimy ass midlife-crisis people like you, posting something thats been posted 100 times already, just move on with your life and stop complaining about the community of a childrens card game.
---
Obligatory https://youtu.be/7It5DWk3CoA

Wait a minute, it is not N'Zoth ! It is Ozumat !  
---
Consistent enough for Team 5, you shall pass.
---
*Cries in broke*
---
Because he's basically calling himself the king. Kinda like he's blowing his own dick. You know?
---
They're trying to get the stolen city of Dalaran back from the League of E.V.I.L.
---
Getting it out on turn 4 is more than worth the Overload I think.
---
Geeze these are almost all completely broken and unbalanced
---
Yes and yes.
---
True, the real issue is the amount of cheap resurrect spells they have and the unbearable amount of stalling they can do with Taunt minionsa, Greater Healing Potions, Psychic Screams, Mass Hysterias, Spirit Lashes etc.
---
Honestly though like why doesn't this exist?
---
TIL
---
Not only are you wrong but even if you were actually right, your opinion would vastly be in the minority. The purpose of hearthstone is to play and attack with minions.
---
Kripp had 1-5 scale but said that 1* and 2* are really close.
---
Czech guys had the same scale as Kripp.
---
Trump had very similar to Kripp with difference in that 1 will never see play and 2 just in some weird decks.
---
Rest used 1-4 so it was easier to convert to that.
---
Furthermore most of the 1-5 scale were like 1* totally unplayable, 2* might see play under weird/very specific circumstances. 1-4 scale combines this under 1*
---
lol yeah that's why they've never nerfed cards in wild. Wait...
---
It's generally better without him, it's just that that removes the feelsbad highroll potential.
---
Dude. Read what you just typed... outloud. And ask yourself if this is how I should act.
---
Because Blizzard hasn't changed it yet
---
There's a hunter deck that runs Barnes into Ysarj and Sylvanas that runs like 4 ways to trigger her and several ways to copy her, super fun to troll them with. Highly recommend sitting at rank floor and keeping big Priest players out
---
I refuse to use any of these on day one.
---
lmao, people downvoting you for correcting your own spelling mistake. Reddit is a funny one
---
Only around 20... considering buying the prebundle while I still can, but I also got like 14k dust or sometbing
---
What I'm looking for is cards to be placed against other cards of roughly the same power level, which applies to both class and neutral cards.
---
When I talk about underbucketed, I mean a card that is better than cards its against.  So, Wrapped Golem being better than all the 5th bucket cards.  When I say overbucketed, I mean a card that is worse than the cards it is against, such as Beaming Sidekick (1 mana 1/2, give a friendly minion +2 health).  Sidekick is a fine card, but because its always against better cards, it won't be picked nearly as often as it should, and thus be effectively a card not in the game.  Golem, on the other hand, will be picked too much and well over-represented in Arena.
---
From the example in the other reply, your example is true when presented with cards that function similarly (see all of Rogue's removal being in the top buckets leading to an underepresentation of removal), but when presented with cards that serve different functions.  With Fireball/Polymorph/Flamestrike, as an example, if any of those cards were presented in the 5th bucket, you'd pick them every single time, because even if you had too much of one of those cards, and its value dropped drastically, its still better than the cards from that bucket.  When presented against each other though, its a more interesting pick based on personal preference and what you want your deck to do, offering up much more choice.
---
What you say with it only affecting neutral minions is incorrect as well.  Violet Wurm is considered one of the most underbucketed neutrals there is.  Yet, due to how decks work, you really don't want too much late game.  So if you already have a few lategame cards, Wurm may be a never pick because, as good as it is, you can't afford to pick another big card over a mid-ranged card.  This affects its total pick rate and leads to it not being picked enough to move up, even though it's effectively an autopick the first time you see it or if you don't have any lategame.
---
Very doubtful, as I have played MTG since the nineties and condemn the netdecking practice there as much as here.
---
It's not that hard. Cards that are overpicked should move up in a higher bucket, cards that are underpicked should move down in a lower bucket. This ensures that they are matched with cards of a similar power level instead of being an auto pick / auto non-pick in the bucket they are currently in.
---
Oh yeah I do remember that one! It was kinda funny because some people kept trying to kill me instead.
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple. I play Barnes...
---
https://www.xkcd.com/244/
---
It could really be argued either way. Your logic is that it was called `Travelling Healer` when it was changed and therefore `Travelling Healer` is what was changed. However, `Travelling Healer` no longer exists, if you were to search for it you'd get a null reference. It the card that is now `Traveling Healer` that had its name changed (to what it is now).   
---
So, it depends on how you think about it. If you think of it from the point of view of programming you could say that the card name is the variable name for a variable of type card. Let us imagine a Card variable named y.   
---
i.e. `Card y = new Card()`   
---
If I was to come along and change that to `Card x = new Card()` then y no longer exists so me saying I changed the name of y makes no sense.
---
Bloodsworn Mercenary is a top rated card? I feel likes its over rated. Sure in some situation it can summon a big minion but on average or curve its just gonna summon a damaged 2 drop.
---
In the previous meta, if you missed 2, you would miss 3 and basically lose right there in mage. Now ppl can afford to take it slower because there are stronger 3 drops back like tar creeper or stoneskin basilisk.
---
Against Even Shaman, Lightbomb is a thousand times better than a bad Hellfire. If you go and check on the highest win-rate decks, no one is running the shitty Hellfire anymore. 
---
&gt;Thanks for the down vote though, really shows your understanding of the wild meta üëç
---
Lol
---
&gt; https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14xZdVXbhmkb6QAaqpdpfjsn0hFg0gZUwBRzVMIoBRGM/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Just came across this while googling. What exactly do all the tables mean?
---
You must not play wild
---
You are wrong. They had to change Reckless Experimenter before SnipSnap was added to live because everyone noticed it was easy to OTK with.
---
The devs don't catch everything.
---
You're definitely right about Pinata, but I'm not totally convinced with Totem. I feel like getting more than one Lackey off a totem will be really strong.
---
Darker than they‚Äôve ever been...
---
Good idea to kill big priest, but I feel like Barnes isn‚Äôt the only problem, and it‚Äôs probably better to nerf other cards or maybe blizzard should stop supporting the archetype with new cards every expansion, then it‚Äôll likely die out naturally.
---
Lmao downvote hell for having an opinion, not attacking anyone. 
---
"I disagree, get downvoted into the dirt!"
---
Morons who cannot have civil discussion.
---
No. There was a bug where the new set was available. But the full set change over happens today.
---
Ducklist plz
---
People said the same thing about the first Quest Rogue nerf and that was still enough to wipe the deck out of the meta until it received new tools in later expansions.
---
Deathwing was the first legendary I crafted (as a f2p player as well) and I can't say that 1600 dust was well spent. I just couldn't imaging anybody being able to deal with a 12/12 without any minions. 
---
Also, I know this isn't really what you asked, but I thought Hunter was easily the best class because you always win in 15 turns. Little did I know, I'd be right once Baku Hunter was a thing and you could win in 10 turns
---
I think the fix is much easier. "Minions summoned by Barnes cannot be resurrected."
---
Done. Now Priest actually has to work for it.
---
Or maybe blizzard can nerf the warrior and make this class unplayable... it isn‚Äôt funny at all to play against warrior
---
But it has been:  We already know what the buckets looked like and what will be in each bucked with a lot of certainty.
---
He should be confident:  He and the others who analyze this sort of thing have been mostly right in predicting what will and has been broken about Arena.  We, you, and Blizzard should listen to them.
---
Nah they nerfed raza and patches shortly before they rotated
---
I still remember back when [[Mistress of Pain]] and Auchenai Soulpriest would cause an infinte loop. Fun times.
---
I expected to be downvoted, but I'm not spending any dust on new cards until the meta settles, so figured I might as well get some easy wins against all of the people testing out highlander decks in the meantime.

I believe he is asking for people to provide him some. Not sure tho
---
Deathrattle Rogue and my 35 Legendary Hunter say hi.
---
&gt; That‚Äôs like cutting pre-nerf yoga from old gods Druid because you ‚Äòdon‚Äôt like inconsistency‚Äô even though it will win you games that no other card in hearthstone can way more often than it‚Äôs a brick.
---
The reason Yog was a strong "I win" button was because you pretty much only played it in scenarios where you would otherwise lose. If Yog flops, well you were going to lose anyway. If Yog gets value, then you go from being behind to being ahead or at the very least even.
---
Barnes can win you the game at the start, but if you don't draw him, he has a very good chance of fucking up your Shadow Essence and all your res spells in games that you could actually have won if you just didn't have Barnes in your deck in the first place.
---
&gt; If the SOLE concern was something as subjective as fun, why is the suggestion centered around making the deck objectively worse?
---
a) It's what they did to quest rogue 4 times now. So there's precedent.  
---
b) Hopefully idiots like you will stop playing the deck if it gets so bad that it isn't worth playing, so wild can actually be enjoyable again.  
---
c) What makes the deck unfun is it's huge highroll potential. Playing a LK or Rag on 8 is fine and balanced. Rezzing 2 on turn 5 is horseshit. This would eliminate the highest of high rolls.
---
&gt; No one is fooled by this. You have fun when you win and feel bad when you lose. Stop crying over a T2 deck lmfao
---
It is literally the #1 complaint about wild for over a year now. Not exactly in the minority here.
---
Here's to hoping for a timely nerf of CC to 4 mana
---
Now I‚Äôm going to be disappointed when this doesn't happen.
---
Giving all mechs rush alone is amazing, his hero power really pushes it into annoyingly incredible
---
1. Use gold on Arena 
---
2. Have average of 2 wins bc bad at arena
---
3. No gold, still no decks
---
4. ??????
---
5. Profit
---
I always hoped it would be undisclosed. That you would need to find an item/card drop that would teleport you to it similar to the animated video. Some shrouded in magic ‚Äúalmost legend in the wow universe‚Äù style myth. A lost city kind of place that people think you‚Äôre crazy if you say you‚Äôve been there.
---
I see no reason that a golden version of Making Mummies wouldn't produce golden 2/2s
---
Jan‚Äôalai in Warlock too
---
It should be the same time as everything else.  The update was already loaded in a few days ago.  I've logged in day 1 on my iphone the past few expansions and it was always right on time.
---
I found out it‚Äôs actually my connection
---
Thx
---
lol this is great
---
You require more vespene gas.
---
Simple answer: you can on tablet by double clicking "1pack@100 gold"  button. You can't on a phone - for some reason blizzard never enabled it. The only exception is if you can force hearthstone into tablet mode on Android phone. It's possible on i think Android &gt;=7.0, there are settings to increase dpi in developer options. There was another method to do it by editing hearthstone configuration file but blizzard disabled it in snip-snap update because people used it to get card backs and packs i guess.
---
Translation: waah wahh big priest was mean to me in wild
---
Why does he need to be WAITING TABLES....I'm sure he's working very hard to achieve his dreams.
---
The real OG hero!
---
Why do you think Big Priest is a combo deck? 
---
It has multiple high-value minions and multiple ways to resurrect them. Big Priest does not rely on drawing most of their deck to get a specific combo.
---
The rule for res is that cards traveling forward keep enchantments, backwards loses enchantment.
---
deck - hand - field - graveyard is "forward"
---
not arguing what should be, just saying why it works the way it does
---
The writers do a bunch of stupid shit like Thrall shining a laser pointer into Deathwing‚Äôs eyes to make him crash, this is par for the course.
---
Thanks for the reply man, I‚Äôve just checked and it ain‚Äôt up yet, just worried because the Dalaran thing was like 16 hours late for iOS last time.
---
Priest is the only class that can take advantage of the 1/1 after it's gone, unless you're playing some awful druid deck with Witching Hour or an even jankier hunter deck with Revenge of the Wild.
---
Barnes would balanced if when the 1/1 dies it could never come back. He'd be a yeti with a huge upside, befitting being a legendary.
---
It makes no sense priest gets such massive additional use out of him.
---
21min
---
And I had to purchase the current expansion packs too
---
No one has fucking played it.  NO ONE HAS FUCKING PLAYED IT.  Yet he talks as though they are assholes for giving their best guesses?  Seriously fuck this guy for being a contemptuous prick.  His position isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúthese buckets may be wrong‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúthese workers are assholes and morally deficient pricks for getting these buckets wrong (even though I don‚Äôt have a clue)‚Äù
---
This is a great solution, great effort on increasing the flavor while solving a problem!
---
Dafuq? Never heard that before! Thanks for answer!
---
Sweet thanks dude
---
Good bot
---
That's probably all of your luck allowance for the year though ;)
---
Wow congratulations bro! I don‚Äôt know if they changed something for this expansion but I noticed I have way less doubles than for the previous ones. I got a lot of epics too, most of the one I wanted. Did you notice anything similar?
---
Why not play Quest Rogue?
---
As someone who plays Big Priest in wild, nerfing Barnes isn‚Äôt a huge issues. I don‚Äôt even play him..
---
What the heck.. I've only opened 20 packs and got like 3 Quests. I want minions not quests.
---
4 legendaries and 1 golden legendary for 23 packs, feeling super lucky right now ! Got the mage quest, the priest quest, the hunter quest and the warrior quest, + a warlock legendary, so... A lot of possibilities, I guess!
---
Those mechanics are for minions only, not spells (mass dispel etc.) You can check everything I do directly from the code. That's the reason I made it open source, so other people can understand if those stats and numbers are correct.
---
How do you know? The card just says control 3 and do 5 at the end of your turn, so it‚Äôs each card doing 5?
---
50 packs and 7 total legendaries! (one free quest and one golden legendary).
---
I played against as double Frost bolt, double Ray, double Nova cyclone Mage. I don't know if that counts as freeze mage instead, but it seems there's very little substantive difference.
---
Yeah i know ,i never dust legendarys, only golden cards.
---
I don‚Äôt, 45 minute tank up mirrors can fuck off.
---
Isn't the secret mage weakness to wide boards relevant because it means they get to take the board and never lose it, which means game over? Secret mage tries to take the board, get damage in and then finish them off with burn once they lose the board. If they lose the board too early, they don't have the reach to close the game. I don't see how a defensive secret helps.
---
Wow no kidding, my question is why did they give one class a passive and the other one and activated.
---
53 Packs 
---
2 Quests - Paladin and Hunter
---
FML
---
So, anyone else feel like the legendary drop rate has been increased?
---
That's my plan!
---
Desert Hare, good pull, man.
---
Well, this is the first time I've opened a notable amount of packs without obtaining all the commons in a set.
---
Maybe the two preorders canceled each other out.  ;)
---
Opened 133 packs. Got 9 legendaries. 
---
Raid the Sky Temple was free quest. Free gold legendaries were Untapped Potential and Vessina. Also got gold Armagedillo and Supreme Archaeology.
---
On my last pack I pulled a golden Hack The System. Feeling pretty lucky.
---
My golden legendary was Siamat! Best card in the set baby!
---
BEETLEJUICE
---
Here's another way to do it to avoid any inconsistencies:  
---
Barnes' text:  Add a 1/1 Actor to your hand.
---
0-mana 1/1 Actor text:  **Battlecry:** Play the role of a random minion in your deck.
---
95 packs, 3 legendaries, and multiples of the same epic. Not happy at all.
---
Better contact Blizzard!!!!
---
It is weird, because I got a deck from old rotation too. It was a mage deck with 2x Power of Creation so it was an old RoS deck for sure.
---
I also got something that looked like old hunter deck with a lot of 1 drops, Halazzi and Highmane.
---
Checking in bros
---
About 5 hours to go
---
What are you even planning to potion of polymorph in wild? A firefly?
---
Damn man that sucks. I‚Äôve always been in the same boat as you and had to dust a lot to make current decks. Got 9 legendaries from the 50 pack pre order this time around. There goes all my luck
---
Yes you get a free quest for logging in within the first 30 days
---
Each one does 5 damage
---
That's not a value control deck. It's a fatigue deck.
---
There are 5 silence minions in standard rn.
---
Keeper
---
Hoot hoot
---
Spelbreaker
---
Librarian
---
Shieldbreaker
---
Check your collection and filter saviors of uldum
---
Because one is clearly more powerful than the other. There is a limited amount of Choose One cards, whereas there are countless battlecry cards (many are some of the best cards in the game).
---
If there is an arena update and you have an opened arena run you will get a free arena ticket and reward depending on the amount of your current wins. 
---
So it may be better to stop playing at 2 losses if you think you might not win another one.
---
Free quest is warlock. Pulled Elise. No pre-orders, 17 packs.
---
I got extraordonarily lucky this time, got 4 legendaries not counting the quest and I still have 4900 gold to spend. Once completing the quests I'll keep opening them until I get the next legendary, then start saving for the next.
---
At least you can draft a golden one in arena
---
I‚Äôve preordered every expansion, and it hasn‚Äôt happened once.
---
Lol it's just WoW's anti cheat that checks to see if you input a keystroke or not. It's why multiboxing programs replicate a keystroke and dont auto perform actions, to avoid bans. Calm your titties.
---
[It works!](https://i.imgur.com/2mLfDCv.png)
---
How can I copy this link on mobile?
---
Got Zephyr on my [second pack](https://postimg.cc/WtQTP7ZK) of three.
---
I filtered it by SOU and by legendaries, and still no golden.
---
Let‚Äôs go, free quest shaman. Golden legendary Siamat. Finley in the within the first ten packs. Got Zephyrs after that.
---
I was waiting for you to show up.
---
I've regretted crafting a regular copy.
---
How much gold should you save for the solo adventure
---
Yeah the mirror.
---
200 packs. 130 from pre-order, 60 from the store and 10 from gold. I'm not including any packs that Blizzard are going to give us because I'm not sure how many we get.
---
83 packs before quests From Bundle
---
Free Quest - Hunter
---
Bundle Golden Legendary - King Phaoris
---
Legendaries Pulled - Octosari, Golden Zephrys The Great, Dark Pharaoh Tekahn,  Lock Quest, High Priest Amet, Sir Finley of the Sands.
---
\[1985 Dust in Duplicates\]
---
2800
---
It's literally impossible to get only 3 legendaries in 95 packs.
---
I got octoshit, colossus and the other super high cost neutral legendary that spawns minions with the cost of spells in your hand. So fucking mad. All other legendaries were quests..
---
Cyclone Mage is even nastier geesh
---
Hell yeah
---
Opened 155 and got 11
---
What happened to barnes? Does he still make a 1/1 of a minion?
---
It went as so: Jeweled Macaw gets generated from Infest, which gave me Blink Fox, which gave me Astral Rift, which finally generated Kun and Moorabi. But, of course I was too late.
---
70 packs 7 legendaries 2 golden zephrys and pala quest seems pretty good i guess
---
I think you are right about that. I will check it once again to see what is going on there. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Reborn paladin. Reborn paladin everywhere.
---
I opened 89 packs and got all the Commons, most of the rates and the average amount of epics and legendaries
---
I opened 180 packs and got 6 legendaries. I also didn't get my pre-order golden legendary... Do I just contact customer service for that?
---
It‚Äôs a card for some esoteric combo that someone will put together, will depend on duplicating them, shuffling into the deck, and then cheating the mana to not have to pay for them. 
---
Someone will figure out a way to get 6 of them. It won‚Äôt be pretty and it won‚Äôt be something you can count on working 9 times out of 10. 
---
Also it‚Äôs just pack filler
---
I was joking, try reloading your client, also check your collection, maybe it just didn't popup.
---
probably either quest mage using with the only card that isnt a spell being yogg, or a quest druid list using every one mana choose one spell.
---
Jesus christ that's an annoying policy. I just shouldn't have bothered posting here.
---
Got Warrior quest free, pulled Paladin quest on first pack.
---
That was the quest I got as well lol
---
Entirely possible. I finally got some luck after pre ordering every expansion that‚Äôs come out and got 9 legendaries off 50 packs and unpacked 2 of them golden. I‚Äôve reached my peak
---
Nice, I hope that good luck continues for you! While Siamet isn‚Äôt as strong as Zilliax, he‚Äôs just as versatile so I‚Äôm excited to try him in lots of decks and see where he fits best.
---
It's a disaster, game is ruined, we are doomed.
---
F
---
Both work right?
---
You need to share it to an email or text message and then copy and paste the deck code that way
---
Why use many when one word good.
---
This seems kind of busted, but it was amazing to be there to see
---
This would be such a great fix for wild players. Only thing that bothers me is that [Blood of the Ancient One] checks for name not effect so that probably kills the üÖ±Ô∏èancient one meme :(
---
so any idea where the "free golden legendary" would be for me? I feel like there should have been a free quest just for logging in, and a free golden legendary for doing the pre-purchase.
---
If you don't like the 3 options, you can opt for a random spell instead.
---
10 legendaries in 83 packs. feels good. 2 golden legendaries (one from preorder). 1 double legend pack right after a legend pack O.O #we'regonnaberich!
---
Re log probably
---
There‚Äôs no such thing as a value control deck, decks need an actual win condition to actually win. And getting to 9 mana and dropping Ysera was boring as fuck.
---
83 packs and 3 legendarys game is a robbery.
---
This is like the Gunspire Sudden Genesis meme decks that got made a while ago. I loved those, I love this. The *PEW PEW* aspect is so satisfying
---
Is this possible on mobile?
---
You didn't actually read his comment.
---
I'm not sure why, but my alt account can't seem to craft this card. Like I search up Whizbang and nothing is popping up. Maybe because I'm in new player ranks?
---
Also got 13 legendaries after 133 packs, all quests except Warlock, Phaoris, Armagedillo, Vessina, Colossus and golden Octosari OMEGALUL. Not a single highlander card but I'm not too sad about it.
---
None of the links work fro me. Anyone else having this issue?
---
83 packs
---
Golden legendary - Tekahn (warlock)
---
Got quest for Druid, hunter, paladin, and mage (4/5 classes that I play, the last being warlock).
---
Pulled Siamat and Reno also
---
Feeling satisfied
---
Hm I don‚Äôt know. I have two accounts, one preorder. I have not launched the client yet on my preorder acct but my F2P account received the hunter quest
---
Waiting til I get home to open packs when connected to a pack tracker, otherwise I could tell you
---
So much intelligence in here
---
site is dying (cause of the traffic I guess)
---
I can feel your pain
---
The one from June
---
How? Maybe in America, pretty sure apart from international schools Proper English is taught well for South Africa, India, Australia and most parts of Europe
---
Finley is the only one I wanted and I got 80 packs and still didn‚Äôt get him
---
Lonerwise#1945 NA 80g quest trade. I'll show and you go first.
---
zoo lock doesn't have any new cards..
---
Hit the 40 pack pity timer...for mage quest
---
That was my guess, wasn't sure.
---
let me know when you log in how that worked out. I may have had an issue because the game "reconnected" when i logged in and i may have missed out because of that?
---
I would have.  You could have stopped and started a new run, just spam pick if you don't want to do any more matches.  Although I don't know when the cut-off time was.
---
I love it! I love the theme, I love most of the cards, I love all the possibilities and the high power level. This is my favorite set since like...Knights of the Frozen Throne.
---
I got Zephyrus and Siamat goldens from preordering.
---
Now, a year later, I can feel slightly redeemed for getting Celestia and Whizbang golden from the Boomsday preorder.
---
10 cost Al'Akir via Splintergraft?
---
I feel you, got the hunter quest after 36 :(
---
[My first ever double legendary pack and one of them is golden!](https://i.imgur.com/y3lhxYx.png)
---
Also try going in your collection, sorting to Uldum only and searching for legendary. See if it possibly just got added to your collection and you didn‚Äôt see the prompt about it
---
Opening 41 packs and getting one legendary is robbery goddamn it
---
Thanks again for your hard work on this! Every expac I‚Äôm looking for your posts :)
---
Go play aqainst a druid that gets the quest off on turn four and tell me it's not as powerful as the shaman one.
---
I'm not advocating the shaman one should be free I'm advocating for the druid one to have an activation like the shaman reward.
---
Tracking isn't discover.  Tracking is purely DRAW.  It just looks sort of like discover.  So, similar to, say, arcane intellect, it can get you two of the same card.
---
I opened  Reno and the Mage and Hunter quests from like 30 packs. I should consider myself lucky, but both quests are literal horseshit in wild and I only play that. Here's hoping that one of them somehow breaks standard and gets nerfed so I can disenchant it.
---
I got druid for free and this out of my first 10. 50% isn‚Äôt bad.
---
59 packs, all from coins
---
5 legendaries, one from free one given
---
Druid, mage(free), warlock quest, siamat and pharoah dude
---
Feels pretty damn good, no pity timers at all or close
---
I didn‚Äôt get mine
---
Brilliant.. Nearly 70 packs and not a single Legendary minion. I only got a bunch of quests..
---
yep, i was just wondering the same, that lead me to this topic, i have no golden legendary for preorder, only those 3 i got from opening packs
---
Nice.
---
Free quest: warlock
---
Golden: Siamat
---
Pulls: Brann, Reno, Mage quest, Colossus 
---
Looks like I'm dipping into my 24k dust
---
I preordered and still didn‚Äôt get the golden legandary
---
good idea, thanks! was the quest you were given on F2P account golden? Mine was.
---
I mean I am happy I think that my site is dying, it means u all enjoy what I am doing :D
---
I got the warlock as my free quest but I least I opened Zephrys. Only opened 13 packs so far
---
Expansion hasn't even been out an hour and you think you already know if a card is going to be good or not. The card could surprise you, don't be such a baby
---
I got the mage quest :(
---
No it was ordinary
---
Yes, I meant in America.
---
Did anyone get 2 free quests? I got both priest and warlock. Obvi not complaining, just wondering if this is common
---
I feel your pain brother
---
Fuck off
---
80 Pack Preorder + 3 Free Packs + 17 Gold Packs for 100 Packs total

---
Rare : 63/72, 6 Golden, 45 Duplicates
---
Epic : 24/54, 1 Golden (Desert Obelisk, of course), 2 Duplicates
---
Legendary : 7/23, 2 Golden (Both Hunters), No Duplicates
---
2355 Dust from duplicates
---
My free quest was Priest's quest, and I got a Golden Brann from the preorder.
---
Priest : All Cards
---
Druid : Missing Quest and one Epic
---
Hunter : Missing two Epic and one Rare
---
Mage : Missing the Legendaries, two Epic and one Rare
---
Paladin : Missing the Legendaries, one Epic and two Rare

---
Warlock : Missing one Epic and both Legendaries
---

---
Neutral : Missing all Legendaries, got 4 Epics (including two of the same and one golden being Desert Obelisk)
---
Kinda worse than last time. I'm still floating gold so I could go for more packs, but I think I'm good for now. Will play Hunter and Priest for sure, also aggro self-damage Warlock to see how it performs early on.
---
No, because Traveling Healer never existed, Travelling Healer did, so it's impossible for them to have changed Traveling Healer.
---
[oh yah](https://i.imgur.com/SNNoSjQ.jpg)
---
I'm thinking of putting this in my midrange deck in place of Savannah Highmane. Have you had much bad luck with what summons for your opponent?
---
I got no quests all minions....
---
The way I do it on IOS is hit the three little dots that let you "copy text", then I paste that into a messenger app and then I cut out the deck code from there.
---
Been trying him for a couple of games, yet to see a new deck.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cmtyds/regiskillbin_desert_obelisk_lethal/
---
Got Octosari and Collosus of the Moon as my first two legendaries... , but at least I got the rogue quest for free, plus a Finley and a golden hunter quest (though the hunter quest looks like it might be difficult to use/complete).
---
Did you preorder a bundle? Your 2nd might have been the legendary reward from the preorder

Because he doesn't know what he is talking about.
---
Been like this since I was bored waiting for a patch about 7 years ago and actually read one of the WoW ToS agreements. They basically have full access to all your computer as long as Blizzard anything is running.
---
Honestly, I opened so many extra Mummies and Assassins, I can just dust the extras to craft the Thrashers, even with the terrible exchange rate on dust.
---
There are some versions that run one frostbolt as a tech card, never saw somebody using two - maybe guy was missing some cards. Freeze mage drops cyclone package, runs blizzards, Kalcegos, alextraza. But it doesn't really matter, it's not like it's going to change your feelings - from the other side of matchup: it runs only 4 giants and two conjurers, so often it is missing one or another, can't freeze drop giant and cc in the same turn until late in the game so often can do only two things, struggles a lot to defend from early aggression. So apply lot of pressure, don't care about value, kill single giants if you can't setup lethal from hand. I know still frustrating to lose but maybe it will help a bit, cheers!
---
That there needs to be a "open all" button on the packs screen.
---
I got golden out and to be honest I think I might just dust it for Druid one. After all I don't put any value on golden cards so that would be no net loss of dust for me.
---
[removed]
---
133 packs
---
All Quests except Warlock (1 free Hunter, golden Shaman and Warrior from preorder)
---
Phaoris, Colossus, Vessina, Armagedillo and golden Octosari (of all things). Also 31 epics most of which duplicates.
---
13 legendaries and 31 epics, above average luck for 133 packs.
---
There's this new card that's costing me games. It's called Dr Boom or something.
---
Well I refreshed my client a few times, and got 2 golden legendaries.... not sure what is happening.
---
Hi, is there a reason for not using the keyword "echo" on shaman's cards **unstable evolution** and **witch's brew**?
---
it seems just echo mechanics.
---
Could be a discover a random affect with a few others being; reduce the cost of all cards in your hand by one, +5 spell dmg, deathrattle take control of a random enemy minion.
---
I refreshed my client a few times, and it ended up giving me 2 golden legendaries.
---
I got the Warlock Quest.
---
Then opened a King Phaoris in a pack, but then disenchanted it because I really wanted the Druid Quest and was 400 dust away.
---
Then crafted the Quest.
---
-My Story from the last 6 packs
---
That reward is so bad. During TGT you could just play Wilfred Fizzlebang and achieve the same thing. No one ever bothered.
---
At least Mage quest has some great meme potential. You could have pulled hunter or warlock quest.
---
That's Ozumat in case you wanted to find the full art
---
This sounded like an intro to a Youtube video.
---
42 packs, I got the Shaman Quest. :(
---
mine too, but i did it myself right before the expansion dropped
---
Lol that‚Äôs what mine was.
---
I got mage.  But my first legendary in my free packs was Warlock.  Good thing I play arena almost exclusively.
---
It's simple. I play barnes
---
So whats a must have Warlock card in this xp?
---
Glad you figured it out, what did you get?
---
Same here.
---
No I think it's possible. 
---
You're guaranteed one in the first 10 packs, and then you're guaranteed a legendary every 40 packs at worst. So if you had the absolute worst luck, you would get a legendary on pack 10, a legendary on pack 50, and a legendary on pack 90.
---
Octosari can very easily see play and so can King Phaoris, not sure why you're mad..
---
Golden Priest Quest, Golden Anka, Golden Zephrys. Wow.
---
The random doesn't matter if it deals enough damage to clear your opponent board and kill them though.
---
My fianc√© who plays on my old account and I buy packs for constantly, has pulled 5 Golden legendaries over the two years we‚Äôve played. I‚Äôve pulled exactly zero and I finance her game. Feels bad man
---
Hey HeadWright, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
I opened the new paladin quest, so I'll probably have to try it at some point, but yeah...not looking forward to it.
---
https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/when-cards-go-bad-2002-01-28
---
Druid quest and vessina.
---
not only that, but you're going to straight to legend. Congrats
---
I got the rogue quest as my free legendary and Sir Finley as my first legendary so it's time to mess around with new quest rogue
---
Firebat‚Äôs deathrattle deck doctor priest list was actually competitive last month. I made a few adjustments for the meta I‚Äôve been in, and the new set: 4 and 0 so far beating token Druid, pogo rogue, big zoo warlock, and some sort of thief rogue:

Epic rng i would say
---
You can't even figure out how to assign a flair to a reddit post. Nice flex.
---
Not with any deck I'll ever play.
---
In Europe i am trying new decks, and a bunch of fucking losers are playing tier 1 deck in FRIENDLY , bomb Warrior , zoolock , and conjurer mage , Is there a reason to play that on day one or players are getting more obnoxious with the past espansions?
---
I did pull warlock quest....my three legendaries were warlock, mage and shaman quests (which is by far the best one I pulled)
---
80 packs, 3 legendaries...
---
I got a golden Unseal the Vault sooo... Can everybody be as wrong about this hunter quest as last one?
---
Wait the druid isn't called Akvavitix in other languages?
---
I knew I'd seen a lot, but SEVENTEEN?!?!?!?
---
Wait for a couple of weeks and dust the hunter quest  it's not very good. Get a quest that you like/a highlander card if you're into that.
---
I got golden reno soo that means a free legendary of my choice ! Right ?
---
&gt; Both are valid American spellings.
---
&gt;
---
[https://imgur.com/zHMlnif](I just knew I would get this PoS)
---
I opened exactly those two... Didn't exactly want the Pala done :D
---
That's the average.
---
In 53 packs opened two legends (priest and mage quests) but 16 epics. Free quest was rogue. Preorder golden was Siamat! On the whole, I am pleased with my purchase.
---
Oh yep, I'm dumb lol I pre-ordered.
---
So sick of these class specific versions of Dirty Rat
---
got sir finley first legendary
---
never draw him in last 5 game
---
Opened 3 legendaries in 28 packs, and I think I got very lucky.   
---
Apart from the Legendary Priest Quest, I got Zephyrs The Great (yas!) , Raid the Sky Temple (Mage quest, is it good?) and Elise the Enlightened (Druid legendary). So far so good!
---
not sure, actually just got him in a game against a mage who fireballed me down to 10 health and was clearly about to pyroblast me
---
There are always some people who play tier 1 decks when new expansions come out, primarily because they just want to farm wins when people are experimenting. It sucks, but if you lose some games in a row, the casual MMR should hopefully start matching you against worse decks. I'm not touching ranked for now, until I have a chance to play with the new cards first.
---
Not enough minerals.
---
Kobold Sandtrooper. It's a beefed out leper gnome. I have plans for a priest embalming/psychopomp deck utilizing this little guy. Dead Ringer, Shadowy Figure (Duplicate the reborn from embalm? Great!), Vivid Nightmare, Wretched Reclaimer..... Mass Res if needed at the end. It looks pretty gross honestly.
---
Is the rogue quest good? I was given it as well.
---
didnt think I would be excited for this release, I was wrong haha
---
I think that makes him a super high skill card because you have to decide what situations you want to play him.
---
So unlike Yogg, Puzzle Box doesn't stop casting when it kills a hero? Inconsistent but I love it.
---
[[Keeper Stalladris]]
---
[[Oasis Surger]]
---
[[Power of the Wild]]
---
YUP, reloading the client works, it gives all the "welcome to SOU expansion" intro! thanks for the tip
---
You get the guaranteed one in the first 10, and then pity timer is 40 packs so that's a guaranteed 3 in 90 packs, and then in theory 4 in 130. Get your facts straight, my dude.

How bad is it? :( I got it from a pack
---
I opened 13 packs but I'm playing arena to try and expand my collection plus get SoU packs. I really wanted Wrapped Golem but only got one copy. oh well
---
Only on tablet! Mobile phone unfortunately not
---
Have you ever seen Kibler?
---
give me money to afford a new expansion deck and I‚Äôll play it instead of Bomb Warrior
---
48 packs, 2 Legendary minion, High Priest Amet and Vessina. Yeah me...
---
No, Obelix‚Äôs fist was more OP.  Current version is needed version.
---
Gotta be rank 25 before you can craft him
---
It only works with spells
---
Keeper Stelladris only works with spells.
---
No, just play the arena again normally, your compensation should already added
---
Thanks for the reply , i was confused , didn't know the mmr on casual was a thing
---
Opened 19 packs in region #1. Got the Hunter quest as my login reward, then got Paladin and Warrior quests later. Can't complain about 2 legendaries in 19 packs, but I wish they were something different. Didn't get any epics I wanted, so had to craft two Puzzle Boxes of Yogg-Saron and two Tortollan Pilgrims.
---
Interesting
---
""working""
---
I am a masochist so im in!
---
gross
---
Np, good luck with your packs!
---
haha i kinda expected this would be the case
---
I just took a 20 min crap break and opened a few packs from the toilet
---
Restore 3 health. If a minion also give +3 +3. So yes
---
Yea for sure.
---
In the mirror, both players usually try to get ticks from thaurissan to enable nzoth+ banker
---
Why though?
---
I just think that barnes should be put at 6 mana so that he basically do the same thing as shadow essence
---
It's too late
---
That's just a day 1 feeling and meta shift.
---
RemindME! 14 days "Or is it?"
---
Nice tip... If I had more than 900 gold it would be very useful!
---
Vessina might be nuts in aggro overload shaman. Craft a Likkim and try it!
---
ah the best part of the rng in this game without a doubt

ahhh right! Facepalm!
---
Zephrys is already infuriating. Opponent always gets the ideal card thanks to number-crunching datacenters instead of player input.
---
51 Packs:    
---
59 Rare 4 Golden    
---
11 Epic    
---
2 Legendaries (Octosari and Armagedillo)    
---
Free Quest: Warrior
---
Damn this sucks, I got Meme cards not actual good shiz
---
Mage Quest baybee, Yog be praised!
---
Pun intended?
---
Yeah, they've said that when you lose, your ranking goes down, and if you are on a losing streak, your ranking goes down even faster.
---
Because if Barnes summons the Actor, its Battlecry isn't triggered. Battlecries only trigger when you play the minion from hand.
---
that dust tho
---
In the past cards that replace your hero power had to be golden to give you a golden hero power, regardless of whether you have a golden hero for 500 wins, I presume that is the same with these quests
---
I got the pre-order, and I'm going to spam Bomb Warrior just to trigger OP.
---
Newsflash - there will always be net Decker's. Even in casual mode..
---
That doesn't mean you can't experiment. Infact seeing netdecks is good. That lets you quickly figure out how to adjust your new home brew decks to fight the meta.
---
Incoming nerf next month is when you'll really cry
---
I have quite a bit of dust left. Just have too look up what to craft. Thanks for the detailed answer helped me out quite a bit
---
6 legendary cards, not bad.
---
56 packs on main, 3 legendaries all quest: Druid, hunter, paladin. Got shaman for login.
---
Other accounts: 52 packs, got vessina and dismay, free login was mage quest.
---
So....okay luck this time, first time going f2p since I‚Äôve returned to game last nov.
---
150 packs opened. 11 Legendaries, 2 are golden. (Not including the 3 freebies)
---
Not bad I suppose.
---
Yup, edited.
---
It's what happens when you Mindgames when your opponent has no cards in deck
---
Wondering that also.  Apart from free quest, I got 2 in 67 packs, ugh.
---
after rank 5 anything goes baby
---
It‚Äôs a scorpion, need I say more?
---
I am literally watching Kibler play plot twist warlock and he has had it done 5 to 7 on a number of games already
---
Teach me your ways
---
You got it from Mindgames bro.
---
I've opened 8 packs so far. I didn't buy either of the bundles. I opened 7 rares, 2 epics, and 1 legendary. The free quest I received was the priest quest, so I'm glad about that. The legendary I opened was Anka the Buried, which I am not glad about because I have no good legendaries that can be played in rogue.
---
I keep entering and surrender and i am looking for some decks. Right now i got dragon warrior but if you create a warrior deck. Dragon warrior is not recommended...
---
Retarded man... The conjurer's calling pool for 10 drops just got significantly buffed
---
Barnes is not the problem.
---
Yeah I was going to bed and had a big dumb moment. I also tried replying to myself but apparently actually didn‚Äôt reply to myself. So I have a random comment on here saying something like ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not keyworded as Discover, mb‚Äù.
---
I think i got that mage deck too
---
Just got 24 packs for gold ... And got 7 legendaries + the free one O_O
---
hoyhoy#21560 EU, 80g quest. I can show you, you go first.
---
I've been getting 20 minions out pretty easily.  Usually by turn 7 or 8.
---
If you don't care about cheapskate like me than why did you make an entire forum post talking about how you hate me
---
That's how is supposed to work.
---
Damn i would like to trade i got golden hunter....
---
Plague also works as weapon removal so because of that imo it's a 1 off in most decks. At worst they remove a couple 3 health minions. Not really a huge deal if you're removing a mountain giant or taunt to push face damage for instance.
---
I think it would be worth it in a deck where you only run 2 copies of a few key cards and the rest singleton. That way you can play him after drawing those specific dupes. Bonus points if you play a few dupes before slamming down Zeph
---
I opened 43 packs and got 7 legendaries, two of which were golden. What the fuck

Just played against it. It's oppresive af
---
Probably to force newer players to actually learn about deck building. If it was available it would basically be rush to 1600 dust asap
---
Some people simply cannot afford many cards. Some people really like reaching legend, and right now is the easiest time to do so. Some people just like playing good decks, but aren't good deck makers.
---
And some people would *love* to make good decks, but can't just casually craft a deck with 3 new legendaries and 6 new epics on a *hunch* that it might good, when in actuality it might be complete garbage and none of those cards will ever see play.
---
Not to mention, soon enough you'll be playing against plenty of bomb warriors again with your fun deck. And it's swim or sink at that point. Either your deck can compete or it can't, and either way it's not bomb warrior's fault.
---
*Darkness Rises.....*
---
It is to make the card text evenly dispersed on the card
---
This expansion has many cards that counter combo decks, it looks like combo deck will entirely disappear as long as this expansion is in standard.
---
This quest is a ton of fun actually.
---
I bought 6 packs cause I‚Äôm saving for solo adventure and opened 13 Packs (6 bought + 6 quest + 1 arena)
---
I got Shaman Quest as freebie
---
+
---
Siamat from first 10
---
Anka The Buried from Arena pack
---
pretty good start I‚Äôd say
---
I pulled less than that from both perorders. Feelsbadman
---
Working as intended friend.
---
Makes sense. He says 'wish', not 'discover'.
---
Thanks a ton!
---
54 packs, 2 legendaries. The Warlock lackey one and the Siamat. Free quest was for Warrior. Feel pretty salty right now
---
Wait what? I had an Edge before this and never could. How?
---
Both events are occurring simultaneously in effect.
---
Colossus gang
---
6 Leggos in 77 packs very pleased with my haul. Plus a free golden and free Shaman quest. Got both Warlock Leggos which I was looking forward to playing the most.

---
&gt;all 4 quests
---
There are 9 quests total. Did you mean the 4 you wanted?
---
Between my preorders and the 28 packs I opened (161 total), I got 15 legendaries, 5 of which were golden (the 2 golden legendaries from the preorder and the 1 freebie counted). Best pack opening I've ever had!
---
the first zephrys gave me removal and the 2nd gave bloodlust for the win.
---
Done
---
I picked up the Rouge Quest, golden Siamat, and Sir Finley inside of 10 packs  (along with 4 copies of BEEEES!!!). Pretty good imo
---
I got hit with the mage quest as part of a cyclone turn 5. Thought I finally got a non-quest game.
---
Same here. 63 and two legendaries -- the pally quest and Reno.
---
I get the same feels. I usually win bcz of Edwin 1 out of 8 times I play him. Most other times he gets silenced, sapped, or destroyed by spell.. probably gonna replace him this expansion with more burglar cards. The 3 drop spot is already jam packed in rogue
---
That's actually good on the legendary front I'm pretty sure.
---
I'm waiting for the highlander deck with only epic spells and legendary minions. Obviously you can't run a full deck of legendaries cuz there's only 1 spell and 1 weapon per class I think, but all epic spells plus full legendary minions would be hilarious for the 30k dust deck
---
Someone told me massive AoE or board clears.

73 packs - 8 legendary.
---
Brother got 4 legends from 93 packs.
---
Me vs brother - 1:0
---
GG,WP,EZ
---
Sorry bro :*
---
That‚Äôs my point. I have small numbers and don‚Äôt feel I need to supplement it with cash. And can still thoroughly enjoy the game.
---
All you need to do is win 6 games
---
I feel you, and I appreciate the tips. I was doing my best to do that, but he also pulled a ray of Frost from a magic trick and a cone of cold from the cyclone. So when I had board it was, sea giant + Ray 1+2, into cone of cold, into Ray 3+4+5, into 1 Mana Alex conjured into dig day + muncher that got zilliaxed (also 1 mana) and then dropped a 0 Mana giant with Frost bolt + Ray 6, into Nova. It was unreal. Obviously he had Luna's a few turns earlier. I just wasn't able to apply the pressure to get the job done, had him at 6 health before the Alex conj zilliax play.
---
I picked up Hunter quest and **golden Zephrys the Great!** and haven't even opened my 84 packs yet!
---
Same.
---
I have been using him and have only pulled a new deck once. 
---
My guess is it's bugged atm and he's currently pooling from the 2 old and the 2 new for each classes. You might have just got unlucky.
---
wtf. You're joking right?
---
Baking soda I got baking soda!
---
72 packs, 4 legendaries, 13 epics.  Golden Priest quest.  Got Zephrys too but none of the class highlander options.  Not my worst luck but still not good luck.
---
Played my rolled over arena run and the free ticket and received another legendary - High Priest Amet.
---
So that makes 4 legendaries and 19 epics in 83 packs. I guess I can't complain but I usually see more legendaries in less total packs.
---
Are you facing the aggro or the control version?
---
I‚Äôm only wanting a basic one cause I seem to be getting rekt by everyone I play

Always the same deck, no variations so far. Running the same deck as the streamers were using this week/today.. So I'm not sure which classification that is.
---
CUT!
---
31 packs 6 legendaries.
---
If you‚Äôre willing to spend money/resources omit the deck you make doesn‚Äôt workout, by all means.
---
It's weird that it does this for Hero cards and not Quests.
---
The madman did it...
---
113 Packs opened. My free quest was Hack the System and my golden legendary was Unseal the Vault
---
Opened: Untapped Potential, Activate the Obelisk, Bazaar Burglary, Octosari, Colossus of the Moon and King Phaoris.
---
[deleted]
---
They actually fixed the card so it works as it does right now some time ago.
---
I really hope he gets rotated to Classic even though I know they strictly intend not to...
---
They are not bad. They may not be tier 1 but with the possible exception of the Priest one they are certainly not "laughably worse".
---
i agree quest shaman is so far not good I keep on failing with the deck. From my experience so far quests are kinda bad
---
Mill druid ;_;
---
All battlecries trigger twice is pretty good...
---
Quest Shaman and Quest Druid already made sure that I hate this expansion. Cause it looks like there's not nearly enough boardclear to deal with all the pressure they can easily put on board over and over again.
---
1. Rogue has consistently been the recipient of one mana minions that replace themselves in hand. Paladin has not.
---
2. That could have really been given to any of the EVIL classes.
---
3. Again, that could have really been given to any of the EVIL classes.
---
4. Rogue has had much more of a deathratte sub-theme than Warlock has since at least League of Explorers with Unearthed Raptor.
---
5. Priest has also had a minion buff sub-theme since at least Goblins vs Gnomes. Additionally, more cards in Priest give random buffs than in Paladin
---
All of those cards are in at least a justifiable home
---
No, I can complete the quest pretty quickly already and since this is a meme deck I go the more fun route of discovering. I also have pretty decent stall as well, the frost novas, blizzards and barrier do a pretty good job already.
---
Freebie: Shaman quest
---
20 packs opened, 2 legendaries, both quests for paladin and rogue and all i wanted was the warlovk quest and his legendary :( :(
---
The rogue quest is good
---
Please explain that armour ;)
---
Props to the opponent for not conceding before it could go off
---
Yea I‚Äôve paired the quest with heal Druid elements which if nothing else feels pretty good against a lot of the aggressive decks
---
As I‚Äôve stated multiple times: I like to meme to the HARDEST degree and pull off the stupidest win conditions. 
---
So I‚Äôve been playing [[Mogu Cultist]] Priest since the second the expansion dropped, spent 8,000 dust on it. It ended up being a [[Magic Carpet]] Priest with [[Cult Master]], [[Augmented Elekk]] and [[Spirit of the Dead]]. And what ends up happening is you just get to add multiple Mogu‚Äôs into your deck, draw one, give it rush, kill it off, add more Mogu‚Äôs into the deck, draw one, etc etc. 
---
First I tried a control/combo priest with Mogu and that didn‚Äôt work. I just got slaughtered by Quest Priests. So I went tempo/Aggro priest with it and it‚Äôs doing okay, even against Quest Priest- just don‚Äôt attack them. 
---
I will say I‚Äôve only played the deck 10 times and it has a 6/10 winrate. But. THREE of those wins SHOULDVE been a Mogu Cultist win but my opponent conceded. 
---
I‚Äôm calling it a win. I‚Äôll continue to optimize the deck. I‚Äôll make a Mogu Cultist folder when I pull off my Mogu combos just like I did my Blood of the Ancient One folder. At the moment it‚Äôs empty though because everyone concedes.
---
I hear you, that sounds like a good balance.
---
I've been F2P since Naxx, managed to save up gold for 40 packs. Got 7 legendaries, including 2 golden. Most of them are only good for dust, but I did get Zephrys.
---
Out of all the expansions this is by far my luckiest pack opening!
---
uhhh mind explaining?
---
You just have to build a smarter control deck and play smarter
---
Thanks, that's probably it!

And we needed to see that because?

Rank 24 plays.

Brilliant idea! Just put 3 obelisks into your deck. Then you don't have to worry about copying one.
---
Too busy playing TFT to care.
---
Gratz!
---
You're the reason my brain cells are dying....
---
I got 4 out off 26, 1 of which was golden
---
Shocking actually. He added me after and said "fucking gay ass deck."
---
I mean, you‚Äôre just wrong. I don‚Äôt have time to play a Bo17 with you right now, so you‚Äôll have to take Vs‚Äôs data for now. Both are low skill decks so don‚Äôt even try to tell me the data‚Äôs inaccurate.
---
Just time.
---
Yes it is good but disgusting is really the Word for it?
---
Magic has been around since the 90s and aggro is still very much a thing in that game as well.
---
I think it‚Äôs a good sign they‚Äôre moving some of the memey, awkward cards to epic. Still not the best feeling though I agree
---
ayyyy same here!
---
This was the best expansion pack opening since I've started playing (since early beta).
---
106 packs (80 pre order + 2 from tavern brawls + 24 from gold).
---
Got 9 legendaries (11 including the pre order bonus and freebie). Two of which are golden (three including the pre order).
---
23 epic (1 golden and no cards over 2 count, so no duplicates thankfully).
---
Bunch of rares and commons.
---
18 Golden cards in total (1 of which was the pre order).
---
I think all my luck has run out. Maybe in another 5 years or more I'll get a pack opening like this haha.
---
Edit: forgot the freebie legendary
---
This really wouldn't do anything to "fix" big priest. Hell, many current decks don't even run him any more, opting to use Vargoth as a better turn 4 play instead that doesn't muddle the Rez pool.
---
people talking about dr boom or omega assembly or devastator needing a nerf, no unknown entity is the real problem card.
---
The availability of *tested* netdecks at release is a pretty new thing to the game. It won't "always happen" if they stop letting streamers play the cards early.
---
Streamers would still be putting out lists for day 1, but they would be less prominent on ladder because they're still pure theory. A unique experience was removed from the game. Why would you tell someone not to complain about that?
---
You get a free quest today, not golden. Prepurchase is any SoU legendary golden.
---
Zephrys was my Golden Legendary from the preorder. Almost makes up only getting 6 legendaries in almost 180 packs.
---
hacking the system isnt this good.
---
150 packs (100 from gold 50 from pre-order) got 12 total legendary's 2 of them golden! (1 was a guarantee golden from the pre-order the other one was just luck!) Best haul ever!!!
---
You have a nearly identical opening to me. Even had one pack with a double legendary. Well done.
---
Everyone complained about Aggro in RoS too, and look what happened, like 6 of the 9 classes dropped off the map with pro tournaments playing resident sleeper decks and one tempo-ish rogue deck.
---
Wait until you see the meta revert back to mage and warrior. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs really going to kill the player base.
---
How are you getting 20 minions out easily by turn 7?
---
XDDDD LOOOLIM DYING 420 BLAZE IT
---
Of course. Though it's still a bit disappointing to get one of the harder to fulfill quests.
---
&gt;Generally, you dont cast bombs.
---
Then WTF does "cast when drawn" mean?
---
lmao that was my golden card from the bundle. I think I will be using it to craft zephyr.
---
They dont hab the teknology
---
Gotta start rejecting them *taps temple*
---
also sorry for that hero power, yall get the idea.
---
Double Bees on Linecracker into double Earthen Scales.
---
I got him in a pack and disenchanted instantly
---
We will find out in the next few days/weeks
---
Nice
---
Duel palladin
---
Good thing for me I like the pack purchase sound so i love hearing it 53 times in a row.
---
Omg crazy. I can‚Äôt believe this has never happened before.
---
.
---
Oh wait. It‚Äôs been posted every 15 minutes for the last week. My bad. 
---
Search bars are cool.
---
Holy scrap
---
You got a list?
---
Based on the fact you're running low on cards, gotta go with Subject 9 here.
---
52 packs (preorder + tavern) and I only got 2 legendaries :( probably my worst opening yet. feelsbadman.
---
the only thing worse than lowrolling in game is lowrolling pack opening
---
Decent theory that it parses the totem as "minion that can't attack" and doesn't consider it working with bloodlust
---
Yes
---
but one of those is guaranteed in the first 10 packs.
---
Got the Priest quest as my free one (I'm loving it, have yet to lose a single game with it) and Octosari in my first 5 packs
---
&gt;It's the fact it is undeniably the least fun deck to play against in the entire history of hearthstone.
---
In a world where Bomb Warrior exists, this is just laughable.
---
Also: Pirate Warrior, Patron Warrior, Mill Rogue, Mill Druid, Jade Druid, Quest Rogue, Quest Mage.  Just off the top of my head.
---
THis is the list I'm using: AAECAR8E654Du6ED+AibhQMN7JYDgAeHBK4GtQPFCKSIA52lA+/xAuaWA+miA5ipA/mWAwA=
---
I think this is the best solution I have seen so far. Another thought I have had is changing the cards that cheat out minions so that instead of summoning a copy, you summon the minion as a 5/5 or whatever.
---
That was awesome
---
Quick question: When the Activate the Obelisk quest is achieved, does it immediately replace your current hero power, or does it rather produce a spell which, when cast, replaces your current hero power?
---
When they get rezzed, they come again on the buhne to receive applause, not playing they‚Äôre role anymore but as the person of the actor. Great stuff!
---
That‚Äôs awesome that‚Äôs like really lucky
---
Ooooh.. you got me good. 
---
Once again, another response that reflects how weak minded you are. Insulting me doesn't make your shit post and whiny rant any more reasonable. If you wanted someone to pat you on the head and tell you Hearthstone sucks and it's not your fault you suck, you should have whined to your mother... not cried on a public forum.
---
There is a post stickied for this at the top of the front page.
---
I got about 7 rounds into fatigue before my malganis died for the second time then I followed
---
80g quest you go first; taxidermista#2390 EU
---
I came here to be him if you two didn't. Also let's not forget about Malygos not being Malygos.
---
Go into a game, play one card then concede. The other guy will be so confused.
---
He's kind of like Zilliax in the sense that he can find his place in almost any deck. Put him in any midrange or control deck and he's a great card!
---
To be fair I got a golden octosari so it's like I got the quest of my choice...
---
I feel lucky actually I only had 37 packs to open got the above travesty and king phaoris, dinomancer brann, dark pharaoh tekahn, zephrys the great, and making mummies as my free quest...
---
It felt so bad though.
---
Hack the System, King Phaoris, Unseal the Vault, Octosari
---
Does this happen at high ranks cause I rarely see people do this.
---
It also was going to be an actual card. He had Deathwing's stats and effect but was replaced because DW is more popular.
---
This has been suggested since the beta, they're never going to do it sadly
---
Do all end of turn effects always happen simultaneously without deaths resolving in between?
---
All 7 Ra blasts occurred before the Mechanical Whelp deathrattle resolved putting the 7/7 on the board.
---
2 legendaries in 54 packs including the guarenteed one in the first 10 packs. Damn this game sucks
---
I guess you haven't ran into me yet playing a totem meme deck.
---
I built a tempo quest shaman this evening after trying a couple of other decks and quickly climbed from mid rank 5 to the top of 4. Feels nutty strong.
---
I literally started with a load of cheap bttlecry minions and all the lackey generators and then chopped what wasn't working for the thunderhead overload package, vessina and a single bloodlust. Tops out at shudderwock for the reload with former champ being the next most expensive card.
---
I've not tried it as a control style deck, but i feel like Hag might still be better if you aren't playing aggressively.
---
No it's just an arbitrary low-level staff in WoW.
---
I think the 2 card combo of Linecracker + Bees is only potentially ridiculous part. Leaving a Linecracker alive vs. a druid, you may as well concede (or hope you have plenty of taunts). If it gets at all popular (which I doubt) I'd guess Bees gets nerfed to target enemy minions only.
---
A wild-only 11-mana/3-card crazy armour combo doesn't immediately concern me. I suppose in wild it eliminates the taunt counter (by putting them to an impossible life total).
---
Was this done using whizzbang decks only?
---
56 packs opened: 3 legendaries (plus 2 legendary quests), 14 epics, and 1155 dust leftover after disenchanting duplicates.
---
Yes please I forgot what the quest does I gotta go look it up on the internet? That's dumb.
---
This was also the first deck I tried out. Can confirm that it is fun. Turns out it‚Äôs quite hard to win with.
---
How did it feel?

Tbh I agree. I think it would help if it was a passive similar to druids. But yeah, it plays very slow/doesn't really seem too strong. Having more fun with a totem deck and murlocs.
---
I felt exactly that bummed when i opened that useless legendary hunter spell that summons three minions from your deck they attack random enemies and then they die.....
---
They did, when those decks were knew. They all phased out the dupes (or other 2 drops for keleseth) as the decks were actually played, because of how bad it was to have dupes.

No mercy for hunterbabies
---
You‚Äôre guaranteed 1 legendary in the first 10 packs, but after that the hard cap is somewhere around 42 packs. So unfortunately it‚Äôs not a glitch, you‚Äôre just experiencing bad luck in this case. If the game wants to be a real bastard, you may not see your next legendary in another 15 or so packs.
---
Honestly I think it‚Äôs a sleeper like not in the way that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gonna be amazing but maybe around tier 2-3

Less meme than highroll. If you can get the Lens onto the Tip The Scales, you just win. Otherwise, it's a subpar deck.
---
Blizzard mafia manipulated your chances for legendary 
---
Iirc: every 50 packs is one legendary guaranteed + 1 in the first 10 packs
---
So you got fucked by our lord and saviour RNGsus

idk i guess cause i play mill rogue with sap and vanish and things, and combo decks that can usually quite easily stall out and then nuke the opponent (maly shaman and freeze mage) that big priest is just kinda a pushover in wild imo.
---
4 legendaries (1 golden) in 63 packs. 8 epics, ~1500 dust
---
This but without the /s
---
They are just cosmetic. But with cards that generate other cards, or decks in his case, if the original is gold then the cards generated will also be gold. So whichever deck Whizbang gives you, it will be completely golden.
---
This one! To the top!
---
Some of these Zephrys plays feel sooooo good. My personal favorite is anytime there's a perfect Cabal Shadow Priest board.
---
More like 200 damage
---
Drake? Like the male duck?
---
The italian is the absolute best
---
I regret purchasing the last one even though it was praised by hearthstone Jesus. The only original trait was Bob imo
---
I‚Äôm sorry, Darius
---
But the card back requires pre-purchase
---
Finally a community I can be a part of \o/

He gave me lethal against a warrior with bloodlust :)
