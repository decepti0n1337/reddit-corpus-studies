Fun fact. Deathstalker rexxar is the card with the lowest "played winrate" on [midrange hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/9yY8wN03828HotSNfIHDD/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) , [Spell Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/XrZWvuuIDzDXOzADcdbSDf/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) as well as [Secret Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/46sk6X0f3K36xQ9FiOgw9e/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD)
---

---
Only in [Deathrattle Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/uXI0G2gUSR0thbhQ9at0rd/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) its not at the bottom regarding this metric.
---
Of course these statistics have to be taken with a grain of salt since there are a lot of factors that are important and the winrate of a card is not the only metric that is important to look at.

It’s... beautiful

Playing kids and people taking a shit tends to be easier.

If you've been playing for a month, you shouldn't. You can probably already throw together something half-decent. Really try to avoid spending money outside of welcome bundle when you're new. Pre-orders are okay if you're sticking with the game. Absolutely never buy packs regularly, as it's horribly inefficient,
---
I guess that's a way to discover new decks. 
---
Forreal tho, if you need to put down a game to progress your life. I think you're doing life completely wrong my man. 
---
You put in your work and time. 
---
In your free time, you play your games. (New concept?)
---
If you have a spouse that looks negatively on games and you like them, you're doing life wrong. 
---
You need to just take some time and grow up. Appreciate the art behind games. Just because you get tired of a game, doesn't mean you can't be interested in another. 
---
I own a company, work a second job, make the gwop and play the games. For me it keeps me off of substance abuse. 
---
But just rethink your steps mate, and don't pawn it off as progress your life...because that means the games were interfering with your life, which they never should and that shows irresponsibility. 
---
But have a good time jerking off and watching football on the weekends !

This part:  
---
&gt;Its skill cap is very high, born out of a very complex playstyle that requires often unintuitive decision making.  
---
At least you give a nice solid reply and I can understand what you are saying but I still feel what I quoted is hyperbole as you can only do what you can do based on RNG and your decisions knowing your opponents deck.  
---
Granted I was a bit over the top with my comment but it was tongue in cheek (this sub or perhaps even reddit sucks at trying to comprehend this)  but I'm trying to reconcile the "very complex" playstyle as though this deck is so much hard to pilot than any other deck that has decisions to make depending on the matchup they face.  
---
Aggro/midrange? Clear board, pop minions out as appropriate (many of which include an aspect to assist with the clear/control) and push face damage as you can or just wait for the inevitable mind blast and/or alex setup.  Won't always go to play due to RNG but it's RNG ... what can you do.  
---
Combo - as you say race them down, try to disrupt as best you can, getting on bard with minions is tougher but you still have your trump mind blast/alex combo if you've managed to restrict them.  
---
The likes of Warrior well you're probably fucked either way from the armor gain so it is what it is.  
---
I'm not saying it's a simple deck to play but I don't know if "very complex" is inherently correct since it's all still the correct decision at the correct time.  
---
Never seen so maybe "non minions" on the broad before 
---
I remember when I had no idea a meta existed, and I was just making my own decks with the cards I opened from packs. Highest I ever got was Rank 17.
---
Then I finally crafted Jade Druid in KotF, my first meta deck. I was so surprised how well it performed compared to my old crappy decks. Finally hitting Rank 15 was so satisfying.
---
Good job, op, and good luck forward!
---

That hunter who goes t1 pass t2 secret t3 secret t4 coin spellstone is just waiting for you to reach those 5 stars. 
---
"Do you have the artifact?"
---
No doubt he was BMing (and probably also sniping). He seemed like a fairly bad player though (not counting the BM-plays)
---
tell you what, in honor of not making unnecesarry posts ill update only if i get to legend, i mean i dont really post that much about milestones but in order to not contribute to the bunch of unnecesary posts ill do that
---
Of course, that was obvious from some of his plays. He played poorly most of the game though, even without the hard BM-plays.
---
I didn’t know that! That’s cool
---
So what you are saying... is I should play hunter and continue to push odd paladin back into the meta... and the cycle repeats itself XD
---
Cool. I will give hybrid hunter a try.
---
For me, the easiest strike to do was the Druid one that refreshes my mana crystals when ever I gain armor. Since Druid’s hero power gives me armor, the deck was just full of inspire minions and  other ones that focused on hero powers. 
---
How has this been up for an hour u/DeviousKat

If you go by HSReplay odd mage has been tier 2 for quite some time.

Woah, TIL

This is changing my whole perspective on shit
---
Oh, of course...I must be more tired than I realized today.
---
It's fun at least - I've got odd pally too and all other hunter decks but the hybrid with dire frenzy is most fun.
---
"Do you think this dragon looks like this other dragon?"  
---
"Do you think this robot looks like this other robot?"
---
Thanks, I understood card game metas as I play competitive yugioh and the such but I didn’t really understand hearthstone until I started watching a lot of it
---
That’s like saying you can use Corpsetaker as a vanilla 4 mana 3/3.
---
Except not even, cause corpsetaker is usually not a key card, so if you draw all its activators you still have other ways to win.
---
Really? I've gone 12 wins at least 20 times including a 12-0 and I've never gotten a legendary. Old rewards system and new. Obviously it happens as evidenced by OP, but I think it's very rare.
---
Whenever you boil down any deck to its base archetype, you'll only ever get four or maybe five: aggro, midrange, control, combo, and zoo, which could at times be mixed in with aggro.
---
It was a joke buddy. But while we are on the topic, you CAN use Corpsetaker as a 3/3. Or Maly as a 4/12 beater, such a good stat line.
---
Yes ofc, but that doesn't mean one can reason everything with "so people buy more packs".
---
Like rly, some legendaries suck so people buy more packs? One could just as well say that legendaries are strong so people have to buy more packs.
---
cool

Wild Malygos Hunter. Recently brewed it and man is that deck fun. But I have a special place for my Jade Rogue list. Been nurturing that list since Frozen Throne dropped
---
It seems like anubs DR should just be 'put a abub into your hand'. Much simpler than whatever wierd code they ended up going with.
---
The flappy birds I face tend to have an attack of around 1,400, so that seems accurate.
---
While I think you're joking, didn't the Ungoro leak originate from there? Or it was someone saying something on twitter, but 4chan dug it up and signal boosted it?
---
there are 6 legendaries there bud
---
Well, it's an Ant Eater Eating Ant. And yes, the art is horrifying. 
---
unfortunate that this is a healthier meta state. thanks for the information though!
---
And yet the latest VS standard report stated that Secret Hunter was pretty much dead. Nice that you found success with it, love when that happens.
---
And it’s also the reason why people need to take reports and statistics with a grain of salt.
---
I tried it myself but with medium success. I do much much better with regular Spell Hunter or the new Hybrid Hunter that’s imho much more fun and powerful all around than secret/spell.
---
I wouldn’t craft Rexxar now a days, it’s rotating in a couple of months. It still remains the most powerful DK available, it can totally carry games by itself. But decks can also work without them, Midrange is a prime example of that. If you are having success without him, I say don’t bother.

Those are good stats in yugioh, actually. 2200/8000*30 translates to about 8 attack in HS, just in terms of face damage. The bigger problem is that removal is hyper efficient - easy, no cost, 1 card clear all enemy monsters
---
It doesn't have to be a magnetic mech to magnetize, but Arcane Nullifier cost more that 5 mana and venomizer is a hunter card, meaning you can't discover it. (Discover only works for class and neutral cards.)
---
Hearthstone information content has such short shelf-life
---
[[OMEGA AGENT]]
---
Omega agent, the one that summon 3 copies of itself when you got 10 mana?
---
It's warlock card ,not neutral.
---
Without **any** hero power. Completely blank space.
---
Haha, knew there must have been a flaw in my thinking. Thanks
---
And a little side note, if I had Velen. I would replace it with Countness. She is just there cuz I needed 30 cards and  I figured a bit of carddraw couldnt hurt. 
---
I thought you were talking about beryllium nullifier. Thats in wild, where the mech pool is so massive that getting arcane is super unlikely considering GvG and Bombsday, but even so, there is always E.M.P. operator if its ever too strong
---
Right, but how did the Warlock deck get UE?
---
MILLLLLHOUSE MANASTORM! "Just you wait until he has 10 mana 😏"

I traded my golden cenarius for warrior DK. My only regretted legendary craft.
---
I think you have never opened packs from this sets. The first 10 pack of every expansion contains at least 1 legendary card.
---
Aquaman Tie in?
---
if you have alot of warrior cards there is a quest warrior with the DK that works great rn
---
the problem foe reaper has, is how slow it is. you won because of a greedy misplay. your opponent didnt clear the foereaper even though he could.
---
oh and i think foe reaper is kind of cool in a dr. boom warrior. rush fixes the biggest problem the card has.
---
Says what stats?  
---
I usually get him through the deathrattle of a silver vanguard that's played on the turn prior. Zilliax' rush lets him attack immediately in that case.
---
Was hoping to sneak into the wild EU leaderboard but sadly not. Based on the numbers it's looking like i'm somewhere in the ballpark of 150th, just need one really strong finish this month to jump me to the bottom of the 100! 
---
Gold, Stars, Wins and satisfaction from knowing I dodged AoEs, went through taunts and didnt waste damage on unnecessary trades, sparing the life of not only my minions, but yours as well.
---
Yeah, you’re playing Hybrid Hunter. I’m using the same archetype but slightly different list.
---
No snipe, Flare or Eaglehorn.
---
In those slots I run Rexxar, Candleshot, and Timberwolf.
---
I used to run a Flare as a tech myself a few weeks ago, but I’m not finding that much mirror matches anymore. Timber helps closing out games even faster.
---
It’s a different story on NA, I’m getting a lot of priests, odd warriors and big spell/odd mages, so Rexxar helps a great deal on those matches. It’s infinite value generation is just too good to pass up.
---
Sometimes you just don’t curve perfectly, or have spellstones in hand, that’s where comes in to save the day 😄 but I can totally see your list working perfectly fine too. 
---
Hence why I said I personally do not recommend it. They gutted too many core cards and offer little help to remedy the situation.  This has completely invalidated playstyles and homogenizes deck types into preset builds themes based on their synergy carss which they allow to continue forward. I just dislike that there aren't more core options and that this close to the season change rotation they completely demoed styles of play. Even if standard got raped deck wise wild could have kept those options. I never was saying others aren't enjoying it either, just giving my opinion. They over nerfed, undercompensate and ruin complete playstyles which leads to less variation. 
---
Oh man that's spicy 
---
Drawn WR is hardly important, played WR is. Especially since people say it's weakness is playing it and diluting your deck to avoid getting the Rexxar or what not.
---
I think the difference, is being able to build a deck where you have a good collection and when you don't. Imagine all the rank 5 people playing brawl and the rank 20 people got to play against them. I'm not sure if this is the case, but you end up with a case of someone having better cards then you and you end up feeling a bit hopeless.
---
Honestly, it just come down to people have their own preference. Some random brawls are good and others aren't so good. Some people are willing to throw dust to craft a deck for a brawl, some have been playing the game for so long they have quite a large collection. For many the brawl is just a way to get a card pack, for others it is to get to play with new cards they never get the chance to play with. 
---
So to wrap this all up. You'll have a time when there will be a build you're own deck brawl and it will rotate in an out. Someone is going to be complaining as there is no way to make everyone happy. So 50% of the time sounds fairly reasonable. 
---
Sometimes I get high blood pressure because I get too much salt from people who have to cry about people playing the decks they wanna play.
---
Usually it's just enough to make it tasty though.
---
Ranks on ladder, bruh. Perhaps some people enjoy grind in games, and playing those face decks feels like grind to me. I am playing face hunter, but I get bored after 3-4 games. And the reason I am playing this deck is it costs literally 1k dust and get things done. 
---
I am not willing to put money into this, so I am just patiently waiting until I have enough cards/dust to get a fun deck I could really enjoy.
---
Holy wall of text, if you expect me to read that please learn some formatting or a tldr at the very least.
---
Someone's salty.
---
Yeah this is my contender for *"the worst brawl ever"*.
---
Oh man, I love when people BM all game because they get cocky and think they have the win secured, and then RNG blesses you, and you own them.
---
I would pay good money to see their faces after the intentional sarcastic “Well Played” -you BM’n SoB- 😄
---
This is a very common misconception from players who have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of the game but little to no understanding of medium-high level play - believe me, there's just as much if not more strategy and decision-making involved in playing an aggressive deck as there is in playing any other archetype. 
---
I completely dig the underwater aesthetic, this has been on my wishlist for a while.
---
Do you have undertakah? He can resummon himself with silver vanguard andnprelate, plus plated beetle for infinite armor. Prelate, lynessa and steed usually draw out their silences.
---
I've been playing a bunch of prelate paladin, either I haven't found a very good list or it's just not very strong. What kind of cards do you have in there?
---
Sounds like you mainly play control? I mean their deck's win condition is your to lose your life total. So what is your win condition? Just sit back and let nothing happen for a long time? 
---
This is pretty disingenuous.
---
Their stated reason for not updating Deathstalker Rexxar was not to do with balance at all, it was to do with workload and upkeep of translation etc.
---
Also, there's a difference between wanting to have Deathstalker Rexxar be kept up to date, and wanting Deathstalker Rexxar to be a one-card deck in Control match-ups. I love Deathstalker Rexxar, but you're an idiot to try and marginalise people's concerns about its power level.
---
these posts should be a bannable offense 
---
I actually love random cards. I enjoy the swing they bring to matches and the occasionally unplanned amazing plays that they can generate.
---
Then again, I prefer to play casual matches, with ladder progression as a secondary concern.
---
Pro players and ladder toppers can probably take the heat, but I still kinda wish they'd stop complaining about the kitchen while taking it. :-/  
---
Unfortunately, this isn't TF2, so I can't say "Just go to a server that removes random crits and bullet spread and petition valve to include a casual-mode option to feature random-less servers." I mean, I'm not even sure what that'd look like in Hearthstone... a tertiary ladder that removes whatever percentage of every given deck has random effects in it?
---
&gt; Horizontal variance, not vertical variance.
---
Where do these terms come from? They are oddly fitting.
---
I would never play that in constructed. It’s a fun card to play on the brawl because people most likely mulligan por minions to get board control early game, them having impactful spells on turn 2/1-coin, it’s not likely.
---
(Though some guy had Call to Arms in the mulligan, that was a fun game =p) 
---
When you play since 4 years and have not been legend once because you love playing against the meta and have fun. But one day you know you must change your strategy. Forgive me.
---
It's like the community is made of... different people with different opinions.
---
(See also: why Smash Bros. tournaments should always have All Items on and allow maps with crazy environmental effects, or at least not autoban me when I request the option! :-P )
---
If a character has an available attack but doesn't use it it gets unfrozen. You can test this with any minion, if it's available to attack don't attack and freeze it and it will unfreeze when you end your turn.
---
Check out thijs. He created a deck without Baku and with the warrior DK. 
---
Interesting. I can see that being fun. The fact you don't know what you will get. I just feel those brawls feel so much worse when you lose because of RNG. I am sure you enjoyed it lol, but your opponent probably uninstalled XD
---
I forgot about spikeridge. Yeah, fair points. I just think the problem with some DKs is the infinite ability.
---
Well their effects were a lot worse in the card game. 
---
If there are great ones. Right now, the deathrattle pool wasn't great. Thus the spellstone is not used.
---
And yeah you can play around secrets, but a lot of the time, them getting 4 3/3 wolves with the spell stone is almost impossible to deal with. Freezing, venom strike, all these only give your opponent more tempo.
---
Sure, I use the same one as Kripp. Search evolve every turn shaman kripparrian and you will find the decklist within the first 30 seconds of his video
---
&gt; There is practically no deck in the game right now that plays a purely damage oriented gameplan.
---
Except when people want to be cute and play Odd Hunter. Now that is pure SMOrc.
---
He wants hugs and positive reinforcement.
---
Lol “if you are good enough”
---
just doing some isometric exercises, care to join me?
---
;) works 50% of the time 100%
---
No no don’t craft it.
---
I find it more frustrating to play aggro in today's meta, so much anti aggro tools and the wriggle room you used to have as aggro is much lesser now. 
---
Anyone complaining about aggro should try and experience it themselves. 
---
Harrison is a safe craft because it'll take over from the 3 Mana ooze in odd decks when I rotates out next expansion. Yes there may be another odd card that does the same function but Harrison will still serve a purpose 
---
it is a neutral classic card that is always nice in weapon metas, so even if you dont need it now you can use it anytime in future
---
I am sure they played many decks during those four years -.-
---
Wait for the rotation and more support in april, then it might be viable in standard but so far its an autolose vs any other rogue type
---
Harrison Jones is a nice to have card. He is and was in no way ever a must have or a card i wouldve crafted. I packed him a long time ago and the times i used him and he was better then having an ooze can be counted on the fingers on one hand. 
---
Also since he is classic you will eventually unpack him one day through tavern brawl and quest packs anyway.
---
As a side note I peronally think they need to UNdo the Star total changes from Ranks below 5.  but thats me. so I rarely get past 18 anymore just cause the Added volume of games needed.

i member
---
The thing is, you can kill the initial shudderwock
---
Why BM during brawl.  Its legit random.
---
It is something in other card game such as Magic the Gathering. The card Platinum Emperion is the first that comes to mind. Other cards like Teferi's Protection are even worse in that regard as it, in Hearthstone terms, gives everything the player controls Immune except even destroy effects wouldn't do anything to their board for a turn.
---
At the very least, it still is worth experimenting with it in a limited sense.
---
btw what to mulligan?
---
I'm slightly pedantic here, but I don't like the framing of the Fiery War Axe nerf in the article. Fiery War Axe was a Warrior staple, not Control Warrior exclusive. It was used as a two-off in anything, but some Patron Warrior builds, which still used it as a one-off. This card would have dictated Warrior early game forever, if it wasn't for the change, and it didn't excactly felt good to play against it. Fiery War Axe made it so that, if the Warrior population was high, you couldn't play many non-sticky early game minions, because you were going to get 2 for one'd, leaving you at a massive tempo and a slight value disadvantage. The only good thing about Fiery War Axe design was that it wasn't that likely that the Warrior had it on two, but if they hard mulliganed (and they should have in a decent amount of match ups) and found it, you were behind with your minion based deck. That's a dangerous card to keep around and nerfs were justified. The nerfs were just wrongly directed, imo, but that's partially because of Team 5's design philosophy regarding basic cards.
---
The rest of the article is fine to good. My only other nitpick is that Team 5 doesn't use the design space argument all that often as implied.
---
EU, I show you go first

https://comic.playhearthstone.com/en-us/forest-for-the-weary
---
Only because the Mage class was propped up by it's agressive archetypes at the point of the nerfs. Control-ish Mages are still okay, just not as present. Mage will also likely not be in as much of a rough spot as Druid with the next rotation, unless there is some great disparity between the expansion class cards.
---
Hard to eventually out value your opponent when you’re dead.
---
Spaghetti code or perhaps a paradox, cheat death returns it to hand but so does its deathrattle. Logically, it should return it to hand and then transform it into a 6/6 but it sees those two as different events so only the first one occurs, in simple words: HS went derp and decided to only do the secret
---
well, the game might be aids sometimes, but overall it is fun.
---
This is why we need to be able to counter, there's nothing worse than passively sitting there while you get pounded into the dirt.
---
I don't enjoy brawls in general. They aren't part of the competitive format, they don't rank you up, and past one win they don't give you anything. 
---
Unless a brawl allows for some really fun decks, I don't want to do the work of building and tweaking a deck to get my pack and leave.
---
&gt;  I prefer the skill that is also involved with building a functional deck. 
---
I would ask why you play, since it is impossible to build a deck better than the one forged by hundreds of thousands of games of data. The main skill of deckbuilding is admitting you aren't good enough to build a deck before using the data. 
---
Ah yes heros, I forgot! Those should be purchasable as well. 
---
I agree, this game could be far better monitized while also allowing room to fix the in-game economies for dedicated players. I'm unsure why so few if these changes have been introduced.  
---
It's a really flawed concept IMO. You can't dedicate 50 cards of an xpac to highlander decks, meaning that the archetype had to be encouraged with few (probably legendary) cards. To reward players for such a restriction, there's two ways to go. Either you make insanely busted minions, like we've already seen with Reno and Kazakus. This leads to an inordinate amount of draw RNG. You draw Reno against aggro? GG. You didn't? Also GG. Coin-flipping Reno decks lead to some of the dumbest, most frustrating, least interactive gameplay in the history of HS. The other round is not very pretty either. That's where you reward players just for having the deck built a certain way, like Baku and Genn. This avoids the draw RNG, but is incredibly hard to balance and severely limits card design space. We've seen hero power upgrades lead to very samey and polarising games. If you're aggro, you can't really compete with 4 armour a turn. Both Pally decks are so consistent every game feels the same. While you don't necessarily have to affect hero powers, anything that might be viable is almost definitely going to give problems.
---
Not to discredit priest, but leaving up an 8/7 on the board when you are at 15 hp is a very different situation to dying at 30 which he also showed in the video, felt like that clip didn't belong there.
---
No market for horror in China?
---
I thought we were talking about playstyles and not individual cards.
---
What about it?
---
This makes me want to play again 
---
It's illegal or something to show zombies 
---
HOW THE FUCK
---
Not always. People hated e.g. cubelock and razakus and big priest because of their highroll potential.
---
People don't like decks with consistent power levels that win games, people don't like decks with highrolls that win games, people basically just like winning games and so they hate every tier 1-2 deck except the one they're piloting. 
---
Sorry, what I meant was I like when I stonehill into lich king into death gripping my opponents mechathun, but I hate all the random cards that allow me to do that because there is a bug where the top half of the screen can play them too.

In that case, you're partially right. It's not that the it turns them not yet viable, it's turns them from viable to completely not viable for a long time until more cards get introduced and something broken gets added.
---
Actually 
---
no
---
The problem is that they basically went for neither audience. The general public glossed over it as just another CG fantasy movie and the hardcore Warcraft audience didn't give a crap because they butchered the story. They honestly should've just told the story of Arthas' fall and, if successful, built the other movies from there.
---
No, I did not draw into my remaining removal fast enough.

Yeah and I would’ve been rank 420 legend if u played the same deck

the easiest one is the warrior shrine that gain attack = armor.
---
Have you bought the bundle yet? I haven't, but I heard that is the best bang for your buck with the classic set that won't have anything rotated. You also get a dragon legendary.
---
You’re thinking of the dragons version. The cloning gallery version destroys odd warrior unless they get extremely unlucky 
---
How did you not get that lol
---
If you mean the 5$ bundle, then yes I have. It looked like the best way to spend 5$. But after that, I'm completly lost. lol.
---
I won’t it’s just a milestone for me because I got before to rank 12 ( long time ago) but never to rank 11 
---
sure here you go, they always have it in the video description as well

I already built it yesterday, liked it a lot and actually hit rank 5 for the first time ever
---
So whats the balance? Its VERY hard to design a card which rewards a deck building sacrafice that doesnt feel horrible to lose to the draw rng of. The closest id argue is spell hunter. TMS and the weapon give the deck just enough of an edge that it distinguishes the deck while not being tilting to lose to. Even then, the rewards are kinda weak - the spell hunter core without those 3 cards are used to better effect in secret and hybrid hunters.
---
Now all you need to do is burgle shirvallah
---
good bot
---
Wrong, it's 50-50 either it happens or it doesn't 
---
Yeah same, brb e-mailing Blizzard to ask for more random cards.
---
Or just wait for radiant elemental to rotate out
---
Its a great deck in control matches but not fun at all against aggro decks in my opinion.
---
I don’t feel the game got boring when druid had access to ramp each expansion just like I didn’t feel it got stale because mage had burn. These are the things the classes are supposed to do. The interesting part was what they ramped into. What things they could add in with those standard tools. 
---
 By weakening those core mechanics you need to constantly introduce a new steam of them to keep the classes alive and define its role. Priest keeps getting board clear after board clear because of this, but I don’t feel that they fundamentally make the game more fresh for the class. Priest playing light bomb isn’t more interesting that dragon fire potion or mass hysteria. These are more cosmetic differences than substantial ones. 
---
This is what ben brode talked about I’m not needing to release frosty bolt and icy bolt and icy frosty bolt from one expansion to the next. By having this core of cards and not needing to keep reinvent them, blizzard is freer to play around with new themes and ideas without worrying about stranding a class. 
---
The game becomes more interesting with new interactions or archetypes, sure, but when new cards are basically new coats of paint on old effects it doesn’t inspire players as much. Sometimes new cards, like psychic scream, even make the game less interesting because of the power level of their effects. 
---
And, of course, if a class is too weak to see play, well that’s not very interesting either. 
---
So you don't discover a rogue weapon, including kingsbane, with higher chance than another class's weapon. 
---
My bad. Done. I would have flaired it "advice" but since that ain't one, I just chose what i felt suited best. feel free to edit if needed.
---
That is never an option.
---
Now is probably the best time to start. Standard is at its largest size, but you won't really need to concern yourself with catching up with the current Standard since it'll rotate around April. You can however take advantage of this by getting the guaranteed legendaries in the first ten packs of every Standard set. And since they added the new beginner ranks, you get around two dozen free packs that make getting those legendaries a lot easier.
---
So, between the guaranteed legendary in each set plus Classic, the free Loa you'll get for the Rastakhan's Rumble promotion, and the free death knight from the Frozen Throne solo content, you can easily get nine legendaries while you work your way through the beginner content. That'll give you a nice jump start for when Standard rotates.
---
sometimes when i'm feeling especially salty and just lost my 5th game in a row to Rexxar/Big Priest I will rope the 6th guy when it's another fucking Rexxar/Big Priest
---
Yeah, this is clearly the reference they were going for. Just goes to show how many kids play this game, even xzibit is before their time.
---
Thank you! Good luck to ya!

Hey, Trashcan, what did old lady Semple say when you torched her pension check?

---
Chose warlock with some decent cards. [Which of these legends is best?](https://i.imgur.com/OyloLtX.png) 
---
I don't get the **parentheses**
---
Hakkar is actually pretty effective in fatigue decks, if you have ways to protect yourself from its effects. But as a 10 mana deathrattle it's pretty hard to make it work consistently.
---
Agreed, the power level on both Rockpool Hunter AND Gentle Megasaur are simply higher than other cards.  
---
Vanilla stats, tribal tags, AND a conditional beneficial battlecry?  Strong cards, period.
---
I see someone paid attention at math class. 
---
Its either Ysera or Jaraxxus. Not sure which one is the better pick but I would personally go for Jaraxxus since its a strong win condition.
---
Then it wouldn't even work on new expansions
---
Unfortunately its been a bug for a long time.  Best bet is to type "new" into the search bar and it will restrict the collection to only cards with the notification.
---
You can also do:
---
mana:odd
---
attack:5+ finds minions of 5 attack or more
---
my favorite, though, is to hit crafting, then type "missing legendary"
---
There's a strange correlation between how *control* and how expensive a deck it
---
Mage : ice block
---
When a friendly minion dies resolves before Deathrattle. Deathrattle is not resolving before the minion is dead, like finally. Since the minion didn't die but was returned to hand, the Deathrattle didn't trigger.
---
forgot to what?
---
When was the last time we got any clear alliance/horde minions or spells?
---
Hunting 
---
Cool. 
---
Two mana fiery war axe was awful, whether or not you drew it to play on turn two was a huge deciding factor in every warrior game, it was the OG keleseth with no deck building requirement.  
---
You're conflating unrelated things.  Pirate warrior has never played execute and patron warrior was so streamlined that some lists only played one fiery war axe.  Those decks existed because of, respectively, grim patron, strong pirates, strong mechs, and strong dragons.  
---
There was a metagame where warrior was the problem class, much like hunter now, and it had a ton of different good decks.  But it was also stifling everything else, so execute got nerfed.  In the current metagame there are two verisons of control warrior (odd warrior and odd quest warrior), and warrior is definitely not in their best state.  But strong warrior decks in the past existed because other good cards for warrior got printed, and that will continue to be the case going into the future.  
---
I love all of hearthstone.  The issue I have with some pre-built brawls is that within an hoir or two there tends to be a SINGLE deck, mayyyybe two, that dominates everything else due to the brawl conditions.  If you don’t play that specific deck, you’re just gonna lose everytime, and if you DO play it, it’s still a crapshoot since the opponent is most likely playing it too.
---
the only time you'll get more value is with bundles and preorders.
---
I believe the company will favor less dust refunds of more aggressive balancing. Cause money. 
---
I think the April rotation will be critical for this game - speaking as someone who used to enjoy playing it. 
---
That kinda ruins the irony though
---
I see it like once every 20 games, pretty often. 
---
Bitch fit? I just spent a lot of time and gold on my classic collection, and don’t want that time to all be wasted in the end if I don’t get any dust back of other proper compensation.
---
I think Hellfire fits Warlock better. It's in more decks and has the iconic 'harm yourself' drawback. And Rogue is for me Backstab or Eviscerate :) 
---
Even with hex or polymorph they can get 1 velen off gallery and then play it, then you've got nothing for their maly or statues
---
&gt;please learn some formatting or a tldr at the very least.  
---
Simple request.  
---
i take anything. Even a dwarf priest skin.
---
Probably the same time he always does, he's got a pretty reliable schedule
---
Board space or an opponents effect triggered the attack. Has to happen on your turn even if an effect makes your minion attack theirs. 
---
The attacking minion w/ overkill does not need to live for the effect to take place, however in this case, since the summoning of the new minion happens BEFORE the old one dies, if your board is full, the summons fails and then your minion dies.
---
mage flame strike cuz arena 4 me
---
A six-pack forged in blood and fitness powder.
---
Obviously you have to take it in the context it's used and clearly Dire Frenzy isn't just an I win card ala Mind Blast.  
---
Point stands they can have an opinion on their favored hybrid priest but the stats so far don't support it or dismiss it as being the better deck.  
---

né is a word.  
---
Because like I said. I enjoy building decks. I see people make crazy decks and I say "I wanna beat that".
---
I love messing around with different combinations and interactions. I may lose a lot, but that is just part of the process. PLus, sometimes it isn't about making an entirely different deck, but taking an existing deck and improving it. Knowing what card would be great with the current meta
---
I don't think hearthstone actually counts as a word. It is more like two words mashed together to create a proper noun.

You are not the only one. I despise this deck. It is stupid to me that it flat out wins just because of RNG (turn 9 and bam. They have all the pieces). And people always tell me this is rare. I kid you not. 85% of the time against Rez priest, they kill me turn 9. It is stupid.
---
The other day I did an 80g quest trade where the other dude played fucking odd warrior, and slowly. Karma got them on the rematch - I queued up big rogue and my opening hand was Barnes and the three coins. They actually rage quit, and we had to rematch. All I wanted was the gold, man.

Casino Mage is probably my favorite deck I’ve played (beating out Control / C’Thun Warrior).  It reminds me so much of my Commander deck I made in MTG, which was about causing chaos and RNG’ing the entire game and not really necessarily winning the game (it can if it has too, but that’s not the goal of the deck, as it ran like five creatures total that all provided ways to create ridiculous-ness).
---
Any deck that allows me to be my inner Johnny, I will play.
---
That seems to be the general pattern in the WarCraft universe. All men are totally jacked, even if they're peaceful scholars who never get any exercise, and all women are totally hot, even if the males of their species look barely humanoid.
---
The same reason why spirit singer umbra doesn't give you two copies of the (6) mana 6/6. Pyros is a unique card, where instead of putting a 'new card' back into your hand, it returns itself, as a different card. The interaction is weird to me, and I've never understood why it was written that way, but it is.

The difference between the druid meta of last year and the current meta is that druid had almost no weaknesses. Druid had great armor gain, great draw, great removal and spreading plauge. Hunter has really bad draw and can’t restore health or gain armor outside of minions and basically only has tracking as viable card draw. When the DKs and Rhok’delar rotate out hunter is gonna lose a ton of essential cards which is almost gonna make the spell hunter decks unplayable.
---
This post almost feels like you’re just complaining to complain. Like come on are secrets suddenly a problem or have they been buffed secretly because i can’t recall hunter secrets being a problem earlier. And what does it matter that you meet the same deck twice? Shouldn’t it be easier because you can learn from past mistakes and already know their deck list. There is always going to be a class with more meta decks than the rest. If you nerf hunter another class is going to take it’s place. 
---
I will not be trifled with!
---
Me again. Safe to say my Spell Hunter deck I used to use with Rhok'delar would pair very well with Zul'jin? Didn't really look at him until this afternoon. 
---

I am! I might use Rastakhan if I had him, but I don't.
---
Not going back to Thrall any time soon though.
---
I think so, not sure though 
---
So far I have completed full rumble runs with 8 different shrines, and I have to say that I had a lot of fun with the rogue stealth shrine. I played a tempo deck with plenty of pirates and some deathrattle synergy (such as unearthed raptor and necrium blade). Essentially what i'd do is trigger my shrine's deathrattle (give all friendly minions +2 attack) to then attack with my shrine into an enemy minion and kill it off for an additional attack boost. Combine this with several other consecutive deathrattle triggers and some good team mate cards and you're all set. 
---
This tactic also has the additional benefit of triggering any deathrattle you gave your shrine from your chosen shrine upgrade card, such as lowering the cost of the cards in your hand by 2 or drawing a full hand. 
---
I’m so high i thought that was a sentence
---
Hunters strong but fine. Petition to get rid of OTK decks!
---
Incase you're not reading other comments some knowledge for you: cheat death returns it to your hand. When pros dies, he doesn't go to death an generates a token, but goes to your hand and transforms itself.
---
Hence it can't be returned again and does not get transformed into a 6/6/6.
---
Yeah he slots right in
---
Am I missing a joke? What is wrong with Tyrande?
---
Thank you for posting this because I thought I was the only once noticing that every single deck is the same and that the cards aren't random.

Start of turn triggers on minions always trigger first I believe.
