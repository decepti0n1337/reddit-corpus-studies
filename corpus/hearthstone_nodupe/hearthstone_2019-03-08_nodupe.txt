considering that we don't know any of the new cards, it would be hard to know the new recipe decks

---
Ah I didn't know that!
---
I already did this analysis when the 5 Wing Adventure was released but I assumed Golden Zayle could be dusted.  You basically need to open a lot of new expansion cards from your packs or highly value the PvE content.
---

---
This is [everything you get that has real gameplay value](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/20NJS1QNU2JU1551306604231.jpg) outside of PvE.  The dust to gold ratio is roughly 1 to 1.64. (*see below*) (*e.g.* 1 gold is equal to 1.64 dust)
---
* 15 new *Year of the Dragon* packs (1,500 gold)
---
* 1 Golden Classic Pack (Average of 469.8 dust with minimum of 300 dust.  So 293.6 gold)
---
* ~~[Golden Legendary Zayle](https://www.pcgamer.com/genn-baku-and-doomguard-sent-to-the-hall-of-fame-as-hearthstone-heads-into-the-year-of-the-dragon/) (1,600 dust or 977.4 gold)~~
---
* PvE Content has zero equivalent value.
---
* Also, if you don't purchase all 5 Wings, you don't get a Golden Legendary Zayle or Golden Classic pack and lose 1,294 gold outright.  So only buying 5 wings makes sense.
---
#####So for 3,500 gold (or 2,800 gold if you got the first Wing free) you get an minimum equivalent gold value of 1,793.6 gold. ~~(This also assumes you can disenchant Zayle)~~ 
---
&gt;**Note**: In Hearthstone, a pack is worth about 163.7 dust if you keep your Legendary.  And 102.8 if you don't.  Because you always get a new missing Legendary (since Un'Goro), it is almost always 163.7 dust per 100g spent on a pack.  (*See* [B137 on Best Pack tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYuukT1O3qdvbSfpUAbJMJLYkusXclc-Rivd-uMy6g0/edit#gid=269921972))  Numbers are based on over 33.3k packs collected where packs opened were over 40. (*see* [B153 for data set](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hcH6U79Uk8xSQhqMqu93sSZoNwMq1E4dw-CHFSTMenk/edit#gid=579362856)).  I also assume the golden pack rarity rate is the non-golden+golden drop rates.
---
Yup. I'd never let anyone with a golden priest portrait near children.  
---
But if I ever need executioners or torturers, I'll just play some HS and find an opponent with a golden priest portrait to recruit. The real difficulty is getting them to accept a friend request after the match.
---
Well yes, but actually no
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
&gt;Yeah, looking at the percentage of dust value you're missing from each set would be the most useful, but obviously unlikely to be implemented
---
because it would be the most direct indication of how little dust buying packs gets you unless you're lucky
---
... that wouldn't be a tutorial then. 
---
RIP 6 mana cards
---
Yep, literally posted there 7 days ago.

https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstonecirclejerk/comments/avsgoi/classic_jaina_confirmed/
---
So people concede? So people play purposefully poorly? This is destructive to how the game should actually be played. Terrible idea. 
---
Which will probably cost you more than you gain if you aren't running otk or get it done on your first free run. 
---
Between such a significant rotation, the expanded single player content, the changes to Arena, and what they've been saying in the AMA about more events and giving players other stuff to do in between expansions, I'm okay with there not being an entirely new game mode this year.
---
Oh thanks I will look into that. 
---
I never bother with mine but will probably set it to random when they add that so I never have to think about it again.
---
I think (s)he mean that if you care about "spending money right".

JUST BUY PACKS.

don't buy adventure you will just waste your time.

---
Blizzard let’s make people gay but take away their titties
---
Something with spells specifically based on the last reply.
---
It may just be something like: If you control another copy of this minion, do X
---
Fair enough, I just hope all that is enough to make a difference because I'm quite bored of "meta" play in general.  
---
Perhaps it's just the current meta that is the cause of this - guess I won't know until after rotation settles down.   
---
I was a pretty new player after the last rotation so I'd have to ask others who had been around 1-2 years+ when the last rotation hit if it really freshened the game up for them?  
---
I thought the spellstones were very unique.  They helped to expand and/or define class identity and created more deck building possibilities.  Similar to the function of the quest, it *generally* forces you to build your deck a certain way i.e. play secrets, elementals, murlocs, etc.  
---
I would like a card function like this but with a broader "quest" that would allow for less linear gameplay.  The results of the spells would likely need to be less powerful but one example might be a mage minion that is a 0/2 with spell damage of 1 and cost 3 mana.  Gains +1 spell damage to a maximum of 3 for each turn in your hand.
---
i honestly like it.
---
 will there ever be a archievement point system?
---
Less hurt more surprised. I've had people spam emotes before, but never to add me to spam swear words in the chat.
---
Holy fucking shitballs how did you do that
---
Good summary.  Thank you.
---
I'm nowhere near as down about the game as you are and I already primarily play other games at the moment so why on earth are you still playing?  
---
Ehh... Tarot cards are literally designed to cover everything. Anything and everything is represented by one tarot card or another.  
---
I think it just goes with the narrator being a fortune teller.
---
Honest answer:   
---
&gt;will we ever see a change to how things are currently handled     
---
No, because then Blizzard would make less money from players buying packs and pre-orders.  
---
Actual answer:   &lt;silence&gt;       
---
Blizzard is not going to give us more free gold, free packs, or dust.  They value profits over player happiness in this case.
---
Thank you for this. Upvoted 
---
It's almost like this game mode is unbalanced as fuck and showing the meta in a nutshell. Brawliseum shouldn't be part of a tavern brawl to begin with. It's so common
---
&gt; If you're complaining that this Brawl is terrible and shouldn't be here, ask yourself if you ever play the Tavern Brawl more than just to get your pack.  
---
The problem isn't so much that it's a tavern brawl but it's brawliseum. Something quite rare that many people look forward to and with this incredibly bias brawliseum it's ruined that opportunity for many.  
---
Yes I know. But it’s even more so in this tavern brawl because there are certain decks that are way superior because of the nature of the mode, so if you didn’t craft a deck that fits perfectly into the mode, you won’t win 
---
Lol, I should have thought my meaning was quite obvious.
---
If you don't want the adventure.....do not buy it.  Spend your money on something else, either some other game or some other way to buy packs.
---
It also seems to be related to spells, so I guess it will be some kind of spell that casts twice. Maybe the second time is one turn later, similar to MtG's Rebound Mechanic.
---
I.e. should have just been a regular tavern brawl as it had been in the past.  
---
I prefer the monthly leaderboard over one per season, since i want to have a goal in arena every month and this would lead to playing less imo.
---
I love this brawl so much I actually bought one with money.... to get lots of wins and get free packs.... 
---
Most of those sound more like suggestions than questions.
---
i gotta ask though; where is it said that a character who has a card can't be a hero? 
---
If everyone's playing "the deck," then the person who brings the counter should have an advantage. I wouldn't judge the entire format on early results.
---
Why drain soul, drain life, curse of weakness? Wouldn’t librarian and other cards be way better?
---
I didn’t feel like typing “can we expect... in the future?” 
---
The various dungeon crawl single player modes aren't new? 
---
Malygos is often used in low-winrate OTK decks (Malygos Rogue, Malygos Druid, Malygos Shaman...). If you like those, might as well craft him. Alex is fallen out of favor because of infinite value grinds that Hero Cards offer, but she used to be a staple in control decks just to gain health advantage. Wouldn't recommend crafting it right now, but after the rotation she might come back.
---
I believe they mean they won’t be releasing a new hero portrait with this new standard year, as they had with Lunara and Maiev, but they will still release the hero cards in the expansions
---
Brann is another card though. I'm not saying that it's the same keyword (it matters for keyword synergy cards, like brann), but on itself, it would work the same way.
---
I was around in WoW when the original plague was happening, and as a level 30 character at the time it was a nightmare to navigate but was very cool to study and observe, especially in retrospect. I only play Hearthstone casually and don't really pay attention to releases, events, or patch notes, so logging in and getting infected with the card back on my second game was a pleasant surprise that gave me a giggle and a dose of nostalgia. Well done, Blizzard.
---
But thats my point, I don't think they are. If they had to equip it most people wouldn't interact with this after receiving the card back and the numbers would be skewed the opposite way. This was the most honest way of doing it. Since the Hakkar blood infection incident had a 100% chance infection rate this is the most accurate depiction of that they could of done in hearthstone. Plus the numbers aren't inflated. Things just get that large exponentially. If everyone was playing at the same time it would of only taken an hour or so.
---
I thought it was Malto the Blizzard Hearthstone guide 
---
I logged on as soon as I could on the day it went live and got it on my first game.
---
I really hate this change I always looked forward to the new hero skin every year like Lunara and Maiev. 
---
Its Malto cause hes appeared often as the guide put out by blizzard for adventures 
---
So similar to Roaring Torch or Rin's seals and Extra Arms?
---
Or someone besides blizzard bought the domain and redirected it themselves
---
I don't know much about game development so just assumed they had have more stuff in the works outside 'Improving the core experiance'...
---
"We've talked about it but nothing is planned for this year" is sort of discurraing for a game approaching the 5 year mark. Just implementing the new 'Specialist' format as a new ladder would have been amazing... 
---
Maybe I'm expcetiung too much? :/
---
Surprise it's Orphea 2.0!
---
I just updated the post to where everything’s inna question format, Hope that helps. 
---
Double spell: If you chose to pay twice the mana cost, you get a special effect?
---
I'm against merging regions. I play on 3 different regions (europe / america and asia) and I like that I have different collections and different cards so I need to build decks differently.
---
That's 2 hints already
---
what if it's just a water elemental
---
I feel like having an ultra powerful dragon from WoW on the team could ruin the flavor for it like if Nefarian wanted to he could escape a lot of things and steal a lot of things easily.
---
4 mana 7/7
---
Yeah, it should be. It’s just weird how it gives me the option to log-in to my blizzard account , which I do, and  then I close the window and it’s like nothing happened, as if I never logged in. And when I try to pull up the window again it doesn’t load. I tried logging in with my email but it said something about how the in-game browser didn’t support JavaScript which I guess I need but I don’t know what I can do about that.
---
at roughly 1 pack &lt;= 100 dust value, this can also be viewed as an extra 200 dust value, no?
---
I just wanted to say I think the three expansion story idea is fantastic, so many expansions like Un’guro or MSOG have really cool themes that can’t be fully fleshed out in just one expansion.
---
Yog sorron
---
So...it's netdecking, but with Blizz analytics backing it?  Sounds like a powerful tool. 
---
Not really correct, since the more infected players there are, the chance of an infected player running into another infected player you can't infect again increases e.g. when you get to 50 million players, half the players you meet will be infected already.
---
Not the buff we need, 
---
The bust we deserve
---
Anyone who has passed middle school algebra shouldn't be surprised by this. It's basic exponential growth.
---
I really like Brawliseum, as long as the first run is free, and there is a way to practice with the new rules before entering. 
---
I'm the same way, except I didn't play religiously until a few months after release so I'm missing a few. How would you feel about taking the WoW approach and re-releasing them but with a palate swap?
---
Justiheart Truecar
---
So playing the same deck again and again is not repetitive? 
---
I understand the pain, but honestly if you can drag your card onto the board multiple times you can squelch multiple times .. And welcome to the world of muting HS .. 
---
(s)he = they, weird isn't it i learned it not to long ago.
---
Huh.  I'd never thought of it that way.  Good point!
---
The fact that there were so many questions shows people are still very passionate about the game they love, but also shows how much better this game can be...
---
If it was more than 5 cards, I would agree with you. But I honestly don't see how 5 cards is enough to be able to make your deck beat your counter.
---
Let's take the classic freeze mage vs warrior. What 5 cards will allow freeze mage to all of a sudden win that matchup?
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;$100 worth of packs nabbed you 70% of a set.
---
A little generous there, aren't you.
---
I think Echo was one of the more interesting single-expansion keywords. Flexible, really elegant, cool flavor, works on both minions and spells, and not so strongly entrenched in the expansion's theme that it'd be weird seeing it elsewhere.
---
And while I think there were plenty of lessons to take away from Genn and Baku, I think being able to start the game with a different (but not strictly better) Hero Power still seems like an interesting space to explore.
---
 charrrrge \*
---
Well it's easy to say that until you see a new game mode or feature.
---
For example, Puzzle Rush was added to Chess.com a few months ago and it exploded in popularity of the app, whereby Grandmasters got hooked. It's probably my favorite little feature of their app.
---
DotA has always had custom games which had limited popularity, but a small group of people from China made AutoChess and its exploded.
---
Point is that new addicting games can come out when people put their mind to it.
---
I want Dragon Kazakus, is it finally time?
---
Few expansions ago, i think it was Mike Donais who said  they are no plan on making hero card available each expansion, only if there is something for that expansion to celebrate like witchwood evil master Hagatha and Boomsday Dr.Boom.
---

---
No cards that affect hero powers affect boss hero powers. 
---
I didn’t get any packs yet :(
---
&gt; And they've mostly moved away from WoW characters in Hearthstone
---
Oh please. That's a lie. Plenty of famous characters show up constantly. Last expansion had plenty of famous legendaries and even the new shaman hero was from WoW.
---
Chromie also appeared in the Arena set
---
It shouldn't BE the competition though.
---
If I am going to watch people play hearthstone, I wanna see them play skillful/decision heavy games. Not draw fiestas and one sided matchups (3 games in a row - again, theoretically)
---
Again, this is all speculation, if the game stays as polarized /gets worse, I think it will impact this format. Otherwise, like I said, I am skeptical.
---
My thots are plagued

Could be millhouse, I got him in a pack just yesterday and so did my friend as well within an hour span.

I’m dumb. Worth reposting? 
---
but if you restrict RNG to some specific cards it is just some cancer deck, that naturally comes with a class that got tons of mass removal :/
---
i love to play wild, but in higer ranks you always run into big priest all the time and it's lame that you can play only 3 classes that can counter that kind of RNG (shaman, mage, warlock).
---
but the worst thing is, you need really hard luck to counter it, thats why big priests winrate is so high....

I am very disappointed that there is not going to be a new hero as there has been for 2 year running. I understand that we will get other heroes but I really had my hopes up.

This is a mechanic in Shadowverse too. I can't remember what they call it.

They meant hero portraits a la Maiev and Lunara, not Hero cards

---
How?
---
Don't thing Kazakus is a genuine dragon, just has a form of one.
---
Here's a decklist--it's not the one I used to go 12-2 with because your brawl deck gets deleted after the run is over.  Just started a fresh run (3-1 so far) and I'm experimenting with a bunch of untested tech like Faceless Manipulator and Vilebrood Skitterer and Dragonmaw Scorcher that were not in my 12-2 run.
---
The core of it is pretty simple though--run Alextraza, run Boommaster Flark, and then run 2x Stitched Tracker to find Alextraza and Flark.  Fill the rest of the deck with a mixture of high value board generators and face damage.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Why bother with odd? Is it just that it’s common with this deck to have 2 mana leftover, so free damage?
---
Same. I was hoping for either a new game mode or a reworking of the Classic set and we're getting neither. I haven't played HS in a few months and it looks like that's gonna continue for Year of the Dragon.
---
I accidentally did a run with a  mecha'thun druid that didnt include mecha'thun. I actually got a win from a druid that auto-conceded faster than me. I bet he did the same thing.
---
I would absolutely love Kazakus to come back
---
The amount of players that cared enough to change their cardbacks once but do not care enough now is probably in the millions
---
I'm not the world's leading authority on the English language but both your corrections sound wrong to me.
---
Yes.
---
No
---
From what I understand, you might be better off making a new account. The new player experience has been expanded quite significantly and you’ll get a lot of cards and packs as you level up. 
---
If you’re quick about it and grind it out you could save up the dust to make a few key hall of fame cards as well and make some dust off of that. 
---
What
---
I received the cardback upon login as well. That's like 4 people in this thread who were part of the exclusive 200. It's hard to believe that it was really 200, especially if it was spread across all regions.
---
Marketing
---
It doesn't introduce ambiguity, it doesn't sound funny to native speakers, and as you've even pointed out its use in this way is commonplace both among the general population and among noteworthy writers. There is no reason whatsoever to consider it "technically incorrect," you've just tacked that onto the end arbitrarily.
---
I hate this one class getting a hero thing. I feel like all classes should get one, doesn’t have to be every expansion, but when frozen throne came out, it was insane fun with every class getting new hero’s and created so much crazy combos
---
Just looked it up. It's "Enhance."
---
The new cards don't really need to be great. Basically everything relevant to the current meta is rotating out. The Year of the Raven cards are going to see new life no matter what the new expansion looks like. 
---

Not worth teching against them tbh. Tog Druid is unwinnable either way and a 7 mana 4/6 is going to lose you far more games than ones it would even give you a slight edge in.

---
Where is it indicated that Ashmore is a dragon? (I'm not saying she's not, I've just not heard anything about that before.)
---
Mindgames was changed for the better, though.  The shadow of nothing used to kill itself.
---
Something like echo, but the 2nd time you play the card, it has a different effect.
---
that reminds me, I played a really fun beast hunter with violet worms, tundra rhinos, hyenas, lots of board buffs, and lots of rush minions. 
---
I still don't think it's fully solved, but yeah miniature warfare gets solved quickly. I think people have yet to discover how busted Druid is in this brawl, Turn 1 Ultimate Infestations off of Grand Archivist is absurd, and Druid has the ability to produce large boards more quickly than any other deck, includeing Rogue. You can struggle against Rogue's more interactive draws where they get a lot of Prim Drakes and Vilespines, but you can pretty easily run over most other openers, and you actually have the ability to match their grind. I have yet to go less than 7 wins on Druid, and would heavily recommend it to people who don't like Rogue mirrors, or want to try one of the more busted linear decks in the format.

There is nothing to collect in this game other than card backs, or golden cards.  One of those cost a fuck ton of money.  This game does such a piss poor job giving players stuff to do and collect, it just rides on the WoW lore and the blizzard name.  Which I might add is a slow sinking ship.  
---
I mean, wouldn't The Arch-Thief be a perfect fit? Rafaam seems to be an ideal candidate. 
---
That's almost the same as echo. Perhaps there will be conditional double casting, like if you're holding a dragon this spell casts twice.
---
sauce?
---
Wait... 27 damage is an OTK now?
---
Look at the tavern brawl that is happening right now.  You like dying to Malgos OTK almost every game on turn 4.  Its a waist of time. 
---
Don't do it man. It's not worth it. Please, I'm saying this for your own sanity 
---
I hope its a card similar to Ticking Abomination
---
When they removed adventures, the cost of the game also went up.  We got free PvE content to compensate.  Now they're taking away the free PvE content as well.
---
I add ppl that play Yogg alongside. If I ever play warrior DMH Yogg sounds like an option to me.
---
The cost of the game went up how?
---
he bonemared the alex. Also spirit of the shark does not have rush
---
Baku n gen/odd n even were best decks but r hofd now as a Baku player idk wa to do too XD
---
yup, you and me both. 
---
sounds just as polarizing to a meta as baku and genn, was in the year of the raven, i wouldnt expect any more mechanics that siphon us into two big deck archetypes ever again, unless they plan to hall of fame cards a year early repeatedly.
---
Looks like a so lazy idea. No ?
---
N’Take
---
Ah, seems like there is a misunderstanding  
---
I am not meaning 2 cards with a powerlvl of greymane and baku, rather loreheavy funcards like "For the Alliance" vs "For the Horde"  
---
Cards that players can have fun with in meme decks for a weekend before the complete expansion drops
---
&gt;If creating fun decks is a painful process, players will leave and we know that.
---
Creating *every* deck is a painful process since every class potentially has at least 3-4 decks to try. It was always like this and it only getting worse with every additional set of cards released. So yes, dust return ratio is very greedy imo.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ayipdz/zayle_shadowcloak_can_only_be_crafted_normal/ei15908/
---
This which is now edited to suit.  
---
I probably overstated better value as I figured anything close to 1:1 was better value for getting content also and access to quests if they include any.  
---
Guessing the original was 2,800 vs 2,771 as I assumed the first wing was free (perhaps I misread this somewhere).  
---
“I personally think the meta is fine right now”
---
I'd try Magic Arena first, I'm having more fun there than here currently.
---
Shocked Pikachu face
---
Im not much into Warcraft, but in D&amp;D you can do Twinned Spell. Maybe thats something new?  
---
Much like Electra, you can cast a spell twice (pretty much Twinned Spell).
---
For those: get out from home and take some sun!
---
It's probably Medivh, but Kael'Thas would make me reinstall.
---
Just get lucky and find Togwaggle on turn 1 and azalina before turn 5. Maybe in rogue with elven minstrils to tutor. And then a buttload of spells that don't do much.
---
Every knowledgeable fantasy games player fears being anywhere near  an animated chests...
---
&gt;When we do this as a Tavern Brawl would you rather it be a regular brawl or what we call Brawliseum (meaning it is 100 gold to enter and you get rewards based on success)?
---
A regular brawl. Lot of people enjoy brawl because they don't need to build a deck (lack of expensive cards). Brawliseum is fun but it requires to build a deck, it can be tough for new/casual players.
---
Hoppor gang reporting for duty
---
I have all the season card backs and I really don't mind the idea of letting people unlock the ones they missed.
---
Annoying how they nerfed Jaina but not Valeera,  at least FL Jaina is still unnefed 
---
You didn’t say that
---
Its unlucky that I dont have Alextrasza yet, is worth to craft her?
---
I use cardbacks as hints for my opponents as to what type of deck I'm playing.
---
For example, I use the Boomsday Lab cardback (the one from the puzzles) when I play my mech warrior or my mech hunter, I use the Lightforge cardback when I play my Overheal Paladin.
---
It's a fun way to toy with your opponent indirectly and in a very non-obvious manner.

Dire mole mount could be my most favorite HotS mount.
---
The Recast idea makes a lot of sense thematically because you can only have two copies of each card (except when you have Shadow Visions, haha).
---
So skimming over the bullet points there was 0 specific information given on any upcoming card, mechanic, game mode, nerf, QoL improvement, single player content, or literally anything. Absolutely 0 actual relevant information?
---
If they aren't going to actually provide specific information, what is even the point of doing an AMA? They should have gone for an AMABWWAI .. Ask Me Anything But We Won't Answer It. Bullshit PR stunt whose only objective seems to be to sell a promise without actually telling us what the fuck that promise is.
---
\*Posts comment about how Malyrogue is worse than Spirit of the Shark Rogue in comments of a post showcasing this\*
---
Damn, that's some good insight there, I would have never guessed the deck with the highest winrate would be the best one.
---
Did everyone receive their packs already? I voted for Bunnyhoppor, but no packs for me yet..
---
Someone did not play during pirate warrior era.
---
Happy cake day 
---
Should've played around emeriss from devolve
---
Could also be GONK Druid
---
This also goes for GONKing
---
I play at all regions. I received them at ASIA server like 12 hours ago, recently at NA, still nothing at EU.
---
Do we know the release date of the next expansion? 
---
30x Snowflipper Penguin
---
It is also possible that Zayle could change your hero into one of the 5, each having his own deck, without actually adding them as actual hero cards to the expansion. Although this might be stretching it a bit too much. 
---
Team 5 Reasoning:
---
"So we made another Dr. Boom expansion."
---
"Yes."
---
"And players liked it."
---
(Lying to self.) "Yes"
---
"TOGWAGGLE EXPANSION 2!!!!"
---
This might be unpopular opinion here but I would of been furious if you're grammatical skill is equivalent to 5-year-old rather then an adult on /r/hearthstone. I could care less if it was /r/FortNiteBR or /r/Minecraft tough. Grammar's meaning has been diminishing lately but it's importance is still relevant.
---
Technically, Forked lightning and Multishot are spells with 2 targets(random), and aren't very fun to play. I'd hope it will be more like Rebound.
---
It dissapointed me a bit too. Atleast they were honest but some features (such as a new, fresh game mode) would really, really revitalize this game.
---
Also chose Bunnyhoppor, no packs yet. How many packs are we getting?
---
I would love that. One of the big missed opportunities with Whizbang was that you got a non-golden vanilla hero portrait with your random deck, when having a Whizbang portrait would have been so much cooler.
---
Yeah he kept shuffling those plague scientist guys But I did win in the end 
---
#Me2
---
Also his battlecry would fit in the red dragonflight really well and the Singleton condition is shared with a disguised dragon
---
Probably Prince Liam since they're playing odd paladin
---
"do nothing till turn 8"
---
where can I buy 1?
---
Oh hai there Billy boi.
---
I'm pretty sure that's about card backs that are no longer available, like seasonal ones. They should be able to give it to you if you had it and it got deleted by a bug. 
---
Yes you do need a lot of luck to counter their nuts, but them having nuts in the first place requires them to be lucky too.
---
Also I don't rly agree on the "only 3 classes"-part. My exodia paladin is doing very well against big priest, control priest is almost a direct counter and kingsbane rogue is the worst big priest matchup out there.
---
No idea regarding hunter, druid and warrior tho. But I could see mech hunter being fast enough and warrior and druid having sufficient removal tools.
---
I always bet on the korean
---
Gonna be Ava or Milhouse 
---
This one works really well!! Thank you 
---
They have to save a class for the next expansion
---
Obviously control rogue clearing the board with cheap shot and double prep versus odd paladin.
---
It's a bug. Just restart the client. 
---
Nothing impressive about this hand, you can't even combo it until you have 8 mana.
---
&gt; Also, based on my very limited knowledge of WoW lore, dragons in humanoid form have glowing, pupil-less eyes,
---
That's only the Dragon Aspects, and only until the end of Cataclysm.
---
That I can agree on, but you can't deny that it was clear sarcasm.
---
What’s the point of cardbacks? It’s not like you actually view yours outside of opening packs. They’d need to change the way decks are positioned on the board for that to matter.
---
Why would they do that?
---
You are literally sayng because they work half as reliably, it makes you mlre tilted? Shouldnt ot be a good thing for you that they have inconsistent draw, it fucks them much more than you
---
Just rank 23 plays

This is actually [[Giant Sand Worm]] clearing the board with 100% efficiently.

8/8/8 Beast | Whenever this attacks and kills a minion, it may attack again.

He was big priest, I didn't need to do the full combo. I started at turn 6 and snowballed after that.

Filthy midrange hunter reeeee

God this sub has really let itself go.

Good bot.

This is incorrect. We outright see him do so in-game several times.

"Just you wait until I have 10 mana!"

Ahhh right I was thinking of khadgar
---
Playing a Priest? Account-Wide Mind Control. 
---
This Brawliseum made me think that we should have a weekly Brawliseum, with new rules every week. Stuff like only Commons/all minions are ALL tribes/smaller decks/etc.
---
Uh... that would be the tooltip for the keyword.
---
It's bold in the context of what we've been getting so far story-wise. Besides, working for Magic doesn't necessarily mean it will work for Hearthstone as well.
---
If it is a current character returning, who would make the best Fool? Milhouse Manastorm springs to mind, but that's more about card design than personality. (Although, with how he acts during the intro to the game...)
---
🙋🏻‍♀️
---
Fuck hero cards. Not all are bad, but I'm ready for resource management again. 
---
Grimy Goones man... Legendary outlaws? Oh forget it!
---
Got four for this!
---
Yeah Control Paladin needs some love now. RIP equality. They keep adding mediocre heal cards. Shirvallah OTK could be good again if it could survive. 
---
What is the list and how does it deal with rogues explosive starts (shark totem and/or bonemare bounces)?

Yep. $20 for 15 packs basically, or 2800g for the same 15 packs if you go the f2p route. I actually prefer the paid solo adventures, because at least I know what I'm getting.
---
Taunt has no effect on characters that can't attack the taunting character. So the Frenzy minion could still go face even if your opponent had a taunt minion.
---
Yep all my games with the exception of like 4 were completely decided on luck of the draw
---
yeah it looked like pasta to me

Netdeck for rogue doesn't include lifedrinker, which is essential

---
I might have to do that. I can watch the story when a streamer plays it and it sends a message
---
In my experience if they let US choose the card, it would something gamebreaking
---
Alarm o bot, gastropod, vicious fledgling and big minions.
---
Your talking deathstalker rexxar right? I would have to craft him when I get the dust but I've been after him too
---
I suggest waiting 10 minutes or so before accepting: if they're salty now, they will have calmed down and usually be willing to have a friendly chat
---
I'm not familiar with MTG history, but how does the game continue when Platinum Angel is cast and its effect is not countered? Let's even say both players cast it. Now what? A tie as the only logical conclusion?
---
NA Felix #13296
---
Top deck adapt into windfury...I deserve the salt lol
---
Use Mecha'thun for Warrior. Look up the deck with Malygos, The Boomship, double Inner Rage, Whirlwind. It makes it quite easy. Otherwise you need a lot of luck for Warrior.
---
IIRC they’re unlocked in that order as well
---
Yup, DK Rexxar. If you're going to play Hunter in Wild it seems like a good investment. I still don't own it myself, but I still might craft it after it rotates out of Standard next month.
---
No, it was Reno, Brann, Finley, Elise.
---
When the random card back feature comes out, I will switch it to that.
---
But really, I am just too lazy and don't remember to change it until I am in the middle of a game. 
---
If they were planning something like a need mode they could just say we have plans or something. They don’t need to announce it.
---
Sounds good but require a lot of work and patience. 
---
He is starting to believe
---
newbie here, how is this possible?
---
The point is that its really the only thing you can collect in this game, other than golden cards.  So for people that like the aspect of collecting card backs to show that they have been around for a while Blizzard has just put the middle finger up to that demographic and said now were just going to make all those card backs available at a future date.  They have done such a poor job with adding things to collect or do in this game that blizzard is about to shit on the only thing that old players have that new players cant get. 
---
True if you're doing regular screenshots then a more permanent solution would be better. For me taking a pic on the odd occasion works fine as it's so rare I need to do it.
---
Dude! You were clean for two years !!! What are you doing ?
---
So if you're not playing the game, why play the game?
---
EU here , still nothing on Bunny's packs
---
I get so far and fucking Mass Hysteria just shits on my face.
---
What was he thinking though? Was he really banking on both Green Jellies attacking each other? Seems really greedy. Holy Nova seemed better.
---
Yes but for people who play Wild nothing has changed.
---
Weapons weren't really crazy, and only like rogue and warrior quests were really tier one
---
The 'new' meta will be solved within 2 weeks and the game will go back to sucking.  New cards have come in and old cards have rotated out multiple times.  It doesn't shake up the meta that much  and the fundamental gameplay remains exactly the same.  Anyone who has played since beta is burnt out of that.
---
They don't seem to get it.  Blizzard have been able to operate above the fray and in a bubble for many years because they were so beloved and could do no wrong but that isn't even nearly the case anymore.  They need to snap out of it or they will just be left making new cards for a dead game.
---
80g trade NA
---
Dysk1ddy#1222
---
U go first
---
Thinking about stopping a run at 2 is a good thought, but only do it if you really have no intention of playing the arena between now and the rotation.  
---
It sounds like from your question that you might be a low-volume arena player and that your question really is whether it makes sense for you to keep playing arena at all, not just this one run.  What I would tell you is that while there is some boredom with the meta lately because it hasn't changed in so long, it is actually pretty good, with all classes having decent chances.
---
Also, it's not a horrible idea just to take a break for a bit if you're on a losing streak, but not too long.  If you wait until the next day then it's likely you might forget some of the synergies or the outs your deck has.
---
I'm saying we don't need another human female mage hero when we already have one. We have no undead heroes, or draenei heroes, or tauren heroes, or goblin heroes, or worgen heroes, etc.
---
We don't need yet another female human mage when we have so many other options.
---
Good job my guy. Hagatha (the boss) is a bitch.
---
I'd be amazed if it was the same stuff but improved, usually it's the same stuff made incrementally worse
---
&gt; My question was focused on what would keep someone in the game, though. 
---
The biggest game-changer would've been the casual Tournament mode. Give it a fee and placement rewards and boom - PvP experience reinvigorated.
---
why not hover over and show buff list?
---
Would you agree or disagree that this will be a bigger meta shakeup than we’ve seen since the year of the mammoth? And a game with resource management as a skill for the first time since before Un’Goro?
---
I get what you’re saying in general but I think applying it to the upcoming rotation is silly. If nothing else changes in the year after that then yeah I’m with you, but focusing on fixing the bread and butter game mode before shifting to introducing new ones makes sense to me. 
---
Him complaining about bad RNG could become annoying if it wasn't so hilarious
---
Magic Arena is in beta but has 6-8 different game modes already. Hearthstone's lack of game options are a joke.  Why can't we play the new tournament format in ladder?  Why can't they offer a constructed event where only 3 random sets are legal?  Where is a singleton mode? 
---
&gt;The day they eliminated adventures was a clear message to the community - open your wallets or we don’t want you here.
---
And to think they justified it by saying adventures didn't shake up the meta enough because they didn't contain enough cards....instead of, you know, ***actually designing bigger adventures.***
---
lol you dont seem too smart
---
Developers should be able to do more than one things at once.  Decks will always be warped around the classic set so the archetypes cannot change much because the same core classic cards are always available.  Rotating out a few sets doesn't change that fact.
---
**The last one against Azari was nuts!**
---
unless ppl stop giving money for nothing this is kinda the trend that's going to continue.
---
There are tier lists for this you don’t have to waste time asking people on Reddit lol
---
Let's face it.
---
It's the same complaints all the time here. And we all know - and have known for the 20+ years - that MtG is the granddaddy of all modern CCGs and has all the mechanics already in the game for the last two decades, that you wish HS had.
---
Multiple modes and ways to play. Card mechanics that are just barely starting to surface to HS. A ton more "screw your opponent" stuff and of course "screw how he's trying to screw me" stuff too.
---
You wanna play with just el cheapo commons? You can. You want to go all big wallet status? You can. You wanna just march to your own drum? You can. You wanna see deck creativity for once?
---
It's all there.
---
Implying that the game needs to be 'saved'. Do you really believe Hearthstone is even close to that level of tanking? 
---
[I choose death!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-GLkAe_J-4)
---
They’ve been steadily chipping away at the problematic cards from the classic set. We’ve seen more balance changes in the last 6 weeks than we used to in a year. Clearly they’re rapidly increasing the pace they make changes. 
---
Nothing to do anymore, but you've played for 5 years. 
---
The AMA made me glad that I moved on from hearthstone to Magic Arena.  It's funny that a game in beta has more robust game modes than a game that has been out for 5 years now.
---
Interesting recipe, thanks.
---
- I will not change my name, it starts with E and I am okay with it
---
- I randomly add people after good games or just some battletags I came across here on reddit or at hearthpwn
---
- I do a regular work, so being online all the time does not suite me
---
But I can partially confirm your recipe, there is one player (I do not even know if it is a male or female due to the elusive battletag) who gave me around 1000 gold per year just by 80g quests.
---
Making a great meta read is part of being a good player and should absolutely be rewarded in tournaments.
---
Solid, I barely have ppl on my friends list that play anymore.
---
Moder problems require modern solutions. /s
---
That was such a great card. The pinnacle of hearthstone design. 
---
Nice edit. No, not everything is sexist. Stop accusing people of it if you don't know what it means.
---
If you expect anything from Hearthstone except new cards 3 times a year you're bound to be disappointed. 
---
On the other hand, since my expectations are so low, 2018 was a surprisingly good year for the game.  Lots of events and sales, and way more balance patches than usual.  I can happily ignore the AMA because the changes they announced to arena and the willingness to axe problem cards show me that while features aren't a priority for them, fun is, and that's the reason I still play after all these years. 
---
They say this every year. They disappear every year. Why you still believe?
---
Gang gang
---
&gt; Rhastakhan’s Rumble taught us about how big we can go with combat, and  the value of player choice and tracking. I’m super glad we were able to  react so quickly to community feedback on this.
---
I know this thread was for yesterday so you may not even see this, but I just wanted to chime in and say thank you for this!
---
Rumble Run was very frustrating before the changes (to the point where I went back to Dungeon Runs), and the changes helped massively. I love Rumble Run now! Great job!
---
&gt; The honest answer is that we haven't figured out what the next Hearthstone game mode will be.
---
Tournament Mode would be a good start....I honestly don't know what to say anymore. The game has been out for almost 5 years and you guys still don't know what to do? 
---
Does Team 5 not have brains?
---
And for anyone thinking "Ah, that can change": No. This is not a problem of Team 5, it is a general Blizzard problem. A problem that is plaguing WoW for nearly 15 years. There it always goes like this:
---
- Alpha: People tell Blizzard an idea they have is shitty and won't work. Blizzard responses that we have to wait until it is fully fleshed out.
---
- Beta: Nothing has changed, more people are arguing that it won't work. Blizzard doesn't change anything.
---
- Live: Idea is implemented, people are fully rioting. [Blizzard](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/431/201/40f.png). Promise to communicate more and listen more. Repeat ad infinitum. 
---
Yay. Go go go 
---
If it doesn't involve designing cards for a new expansion or selling said cards they are all talk.
---
Blizzard has said the exact thing Thompson has said since 2004 on WoW. The fact that you give them ANY benefit of the doubt is a joke, they have 15 years of proving you wrong. Blizzard gets essays worth of class design feedback, releases a WoW expansion with broken classes, and then proceeds to straight faced tell the community "Well you should have given more feedback in beta". We FUCKING DID, the dumb cunts chose not to read it/do anything about it. 
---
It's almost as if it was all just for publicity and not really to connect with the community... 
---
&gt;We've seen this done by the team time and time again. Communication ramps up, promises are made, and yet five years later we're still in the exact same spot.
---
They're usually pretty reserved when discussing any feature that hasn't been officially announced and confirmed. And I suspect it's not helping matters to interpret the few positive but noncommittal responses we do get along those lines as "promises".
---
In the Sunwell Plateau raid there's a dragon Madrigosa who is resurrected by invading demons to be the Skeletal Dragon (Felmyst)[https://www.wowhead.com/npc=25038/felmyst#comments].
---
Not sure if there's any lore tied to it but there's also a (Feldrake)[https://www.wowhead.com/item=79771/feldrake] mount from a tcg code.
---
Same price means about 6% inflation since 2014.
---
I smell a price adjustment coming...
---
We'll be paying attention to data and community feedback for the upcoming adventure as well to make changes of a similar level if needed.
---
Honestly you can blame old players (and not the devs) for that. Old players have given a lot of feedback on reddit and forums that they would NOT be okay with discounts for wild cards and they might even stop playing. Even if it's not the majority there are a surprising number of people that spoke up about it
---
I think it really seems that way because most of the posts here (that contain text) are negative posts. People who are happy with the game don't post (or at least not nearly as much). The same goes for things like yelp reviews of restaurants. I know I'm incredibly more likely (unfortunately) to post a review if I had a bad time to warn others than if I had a good time. People naturally speak up when they are upset, and if they aren't upset they don't contribute much.
---
I for one only lurk on this Reddit because once in a while posts and news come up that I wouldn't have otherwise known, but it's a huge uphill battle to 'enjoy the community' around this game. It happens with all games, so it's not HS specific but damn. It feels like every player who is actively willing to discuss the game is negative about it (people adding you after game, complaining posts etc). Even the posts that are people just being positive about the game get shit on because they are blizzard shill/whale/ignoring the facts/rose-colored glasses/not hardcore player/not f2p etc etc etc.
---
I honestly find more people who vocally like Hearthstone on /r/hearthstonecirclejerk than here.
---
Just my 2 cents. 
---
The majority of the art is outsourced but there are good artists on the team, the thing I think they do best is the sound design; you can practically play the game blindfolded because the sounds and VO lines are so distinct and memorable.
---
They have literally said this in every ama for the last 4 or 5 years.

You got mana flooded or mana screwed. It happens.
---
Hm. What are the reasons they wouldnt like cheaper packs?
---
Blizzard: I can’t BELIEVE we haven’t thought of that! 
---
*increased pack price by 25%*
---
Team 5 has to earn the players trust first. The WoW dev team has been saying this year after year, yet communication has gotten worse. If you honestly mean it then I think it will be great for everyone, but Team 5 doesn't follow through then they will lose more respect from the playerbase.
---
But Wrathion barely showed up in WoD. And you'd think the dude who talks about the Burning Legion would have shown up in Legion, but hey what do I know. 
---
Oh! Thanks)
---
What was it at the end?
---
Are you being sarcastic? Because it sure the more posts of this we have, the better.
---
Things change when shit is hitting the fan everywhere.
---
I literally haven't seen this reposted once, other than the time I posted it about 2 years ago.
---
4800 dust
---
I don't get people like you. You act as though it's not acceptable to be visibly upset that the game you've invested into for the last few years isn't turning into what you wanted it to be.
---
Obviously everyone here that's frustrated loves this game. Most people are begging to give Blizzard *all* their time and money and they refuse to satisfy their veteran players with the tools and progression factors they need to be happy. Instead, they do scummy AMA's right before a set drops to instill false hope(and entice you to pre-order) by teasing and talking about things they full well know they have no plans of ever making.
---
Who ended up winning anyway?
---
I understsnd your optimism and over the last 5 years they have made small changes.  But in the grand scope this game has generated over a billion dollars in profit in its life cycle.  There are 3 formates (Wild, standard,arena) 2 of them have been around since day 1( standard, arena), the other was forced into the game because they had to (wild).  For a game to generate hundreds of millions of dollars profit can you honestly tell me they are doing a fine job adding features to this game?
---
People said Wild would simple be abandoned but people refused to listen and belieaved Ban Brode.
---
Wishful thinking ignoring reality.
---
The best way to make friends in this game is to add everyone, and no matter what make sure you type GG as the first thing you send. If you're pissed, you probably won't be after. If they're pissed, they probably won't be. 200 friends in no time.
---
It's pathetic. I have spent so much time and money on this game and I want it to be good, but they just REFUSE to develop the game, and I am WAY past the point of new packs keeping me interested. We should have a client that isn't bloated or buggy (on any platform), achievements, statistics, built-in deck tracker, fucking auto-squelch, and that's just QOL. The ladder format is badly dated and not fun. Endless best-of-one grinding for stars at a 52% winrate with the same pool of meta decks is TIRED. 
---
We  need new game modes. We need more reasons to play. We need better daily rewards. We need to feel like they are trying to make the game better rather than just adding cards and spouting some PR bullshit a few times a year, but that is what we get. I am so disappointed in this game. That AMA basically just affirmed that nothing is going to change. This game is fucking dead to me.
---
The problem is that they have very obviously taken the stance of "minimal effort, maximum profit"
---
They are investing the absolute bare minimum into the experience to reap the highest possible reward.  This may be easy to classify as "smart business", but it's really not.  Being so apathetic about investing in improvements and expansions to their game shows players that they don't really care about the experience.
---
And if they don't care, why should we?
---
8pm? PST/PDT
---
&gt; You act as though it's not acceptable to be visibly upset
---
?
---
I literally told him to make a post about it lol
---
It was a huge letdown.  If this is the quality of the increased communication they mentioned, I won't hold my breath.
---
The effort to profit ratio must be crazy. Hearthstone is one of the most profitable AAA games ever and it's literally a mobile card game that has largely stayed the same beyond new cards and severely lacking in what most would consider basic features.
---
There are some old reddit threads about it... you should look around
---
Yeah these pictures are always taken on the opponents’ turn
---
You can get up to 10 “gifted” to your account. I did it back in the day through shady survey websites but they took like 3 minutes each for a pack and you can use disposable/temp email accounts they don’t have much of a filter. 
---
All of these: https://disguisedtoast.com/articles/288-how-to-save-money-earn-free-packs-and-gold
---
You can use an emulator on your computer for the iPhone/Android/galaxy ones. 
---
And the welcome bundle is worth buying even if you never buy packs otherwise. 
---
You get a guaranteed legendary in your first 10 packs opened of a set, so make sure you do that for the sets you haven’t opened a legendary from yet. 
---
Some of the adventures/solo content give packs, KFT does for sure. Do those if you haven’t already. 
---
Otherwise, best way to get stuff free in this game is getting really good at arena. If you enjoy arena you can build a damn near full collection F2P over time. 
---
Is this what they told people in the secret hearthstone development meeting with all the streamers?  I really hope it was more than that. Why they're not telling the rest of us is beyond me.
---
Fixing existing modes of play is so ambiguous it hurts.  
---
How are people so stupid? This chart doesn't show all the results of all the control mages who got 9th to 224th place.
---
Lol, k.
---
Whoops. I also forgot about something in Europe called the VAT. And also there are some form of tariffs which cause the price of American-sold goods to skyrocket in price.
---
Just stop Buying Blizzard Products
---
people who have been playing this game for 5 years will not stop playing if wild cards become cheaper. maybe a few cry babies will hold that much of a grudge but most will just complain on reddit for a month or 2 and keep playing every day like they always have.
---
From what I’ve seen (outside of this as well) he’s got a chip on his shoulder and acts as if the world owes him a favor.
---
Yeah when I mentioned art I was thinking of the whole presentation of the gameplay. I've played other card games, but HS is the only one I've really enjoyed watching on Twitch for that reason. 
---
They built an entire expansion around Dr.Boom who was no more than a minor NPC in WoW and had little actual characterisation in his GvG appearance. It was only his infamous power level that lead to his character being expanded on later on. The same could be true for Patches. 
---
Just curious what language did you use?
---
Except helping new players is actually profitable as they can become new longtime customers
---
You're referring to [this clip](https://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/clip/PlainPoisedNikudonPogChamp).
---
Since I already wrote my dumb Mass Hysteria Simulator (see my top-level comment somewhere here) I thought why not throw this scenario in there, too? So I did.
---
Here are the results of 100,000,000 more simulations of the first Mass Hysteria (before potential Geist revives):
---
    Chance  | Surviving Minions
---
     46.59% | No Survivors
---
     17.27% | [Ghoul 2/2]
---
     11.36% | [Necrotic Geist 5/2]
---
      8.64% | [Necrotic Geist 5/3]
---
      8.64% | [Grub 1/1]
---
      7.50% | [Necrotic Geist 5/1] [Ghoul 2/1]
---
Now things would get trickier since there are multiple scenarios where the Geist survived, so there's different starting states for the second Mass Hysteria. Except, if the Geist took damage, it will always die in the second Mass Hysteria. So let's just go with the Geist surviving on full HP as it did in Kripp's case (which was an 8.64% chance) for now. Another 100 M simulations on that case give us the following outcome (again, before potential Geist revives):
---
     56.80% | [Necrotic Geist 5/1]
---
     43.20% | [Ghoul 2/2]
---
So, it's actually pretty likely that the Geist survives the second round if he started at full HP.
---
But we can do better. I didn't have to change a whole lot to just simulate two Mass Hysterias in a row with the Geist tirggering its Ghouls in-between if it survived. So, another 100,000,000 simulations of the whole thing, i.e. casting a second Mass Hysteria if the Geist survived the first one and summoned Ghouls. Once more, this final state is before the Geist summons the Ghouls.
---
     65.45% | No Survivors
---
     21.01% | [Ghoul 2/2]
---
      4.91% | [Necrotic Geist 5/1]
---
&gt;All we can do as consumers is speak with our wallets.
---
I stopped giving Blizzard money last year, and I have no plans to ever do so again. It's pretty easy to do, so I encourage everyone to join me. 
---
What is AMA?
---
Any idea what it costs in cash to get that?
---
My god man. Ok i hate aome broken shit in the wild format with Barnes Priest as the main offender but cmon u almost ask for wild to be like arena. Bunch of card minions stats going against each other
---
I switched mine back but it's clear that a lot of people don't really pay attention to their cardbacks. The good thing is that it blew out all of those that still had the Winterveil cardback. It's like taking your lights down after Christmas, people!

AMA from companies or celebs are almost always PR, i mean i dont expect anything else, they always dodge hard questions or give vague PR-friendly statements.
---
Not even a "feel good" lie, like when a prostitute gives you a compliment, you know its a lie because its her job, but at least makes you feel better, and you want to believe it, same here, tell me things will improve next year, the game is dying, Rumble was imo the worst expansion, the game will never recover if the same thing happens next expansion.
---
"Blizzard" and "disappointing" have been used in the same sentence a lot recently.
---
While they didn't say a lot I wanted to hear I still appreciate the effort.
---
They hardly ever acknowledge that Wild exists. If I would've known years ago that it was going to be a neglected format, I would have quit a long time ago. 
---
Now I just browse this miserable subreddit hoping that someday the REAL Blizzard will come back and make this game live up to its potential.
---
Based on the title I thought somebody broke into your house while you were playing 
---
Java because that's &gt;90% of what I use at work, so that's what I'm most comfortable in. But it really shouldn't matter much. If I was fluent in R, I could've probably done this in a fraction of the time and LoC.
---
I think that we got a reasonable amount of info. Bear in mind that "we aren't planning on doing that this year" is information. It's not the information that you may want, but it still counts. 
---
Pick a different game, this one is on the way out.

&gt;making a thread in r/hearthstone asking how much is 1600x3
---
* Makes the older sets look less valuable
---
* Makes them feel they were 'overcharged' when they bought the cards
---
* Makes it look like Blizzard is putting new players above those who have been around and have built up their own substantial collections
---
Whether avoiding those possible feelings is worth making Wild even harder for a new player to get into is a reasonable question, but those are some things they are keeping their eye on.
---
I just play shadowverse If i want something similar to HS. At least even tho some metas are really garbage they  update periodically so the meta keeps moving.
---
I'm gonna hit you with some big truths, right here, right now:
---
- Any game. Any video game, after a few years of being live. Is going to get boring. It doesn't matter what franchise, what branding, what it is. 
---
- Everything you said here. Literally everything, point for point, has been said by someone, about something, stretching all the way back 20 years. HS didn't exist, but you know what game did? Yes. Magic: The Gathering. You could just substitute "Blizzard" for "Wizards of the Coast" and there you go. The exact same things have been said and here we all, all over again.
---
- It's fun to be depressed and negative. I get it. It's the favorite thing to do here in this sub, to hate on the game. The interesting thing here is that nobody wants to do the logical thing and *try other games* and broaden your horizons.
---
Again - if you are angry, depressed, negative, ask yourself once again - why are you here? Why do you bother?
---
You could be grinning from ear to ear, playing Magic: The Gathering and singing its praises(ya ya I know I know, what did I just say above), instead of sullenly being all pissed off at HS.
---
"That is definitely something that is on our radar, and has been a topic of discussion recently at HQ. There have been talks about how to handle this moving forward, and we feel that there needs to be something done."
---
Erm, you mean buying packs? Depends what you get and what you disenchant
---
I'm not sure if you can craft a plain c'thun, before the last rotation you got it opening your first old gods pack. I don't think they've changed it
---
What cards? Only demons or like any card?
---
Ha! Just this reddit thread.  See the recent AMA about achievements.
---
*&lt;insert surprised &lt;insert character&gt; meme&gt;*

How come when i ask the same questions I get 100 downvotes 
---
Expansion is a month away. There is no loss in updating the decks before that.
---
MTGA is awesome and constantly getting better.
---
That's the human race lol
---
Fix old cards, old mechanics, old texts, old interactions OR focus on new cards, new mechanics, new keywords, new interactions? 
---
He’s asking for all the oppressive decks to be toned down
---
You ask me, Aviana was always going to be a problem AND Psychmelon has never seen play since. They made the right choice.
---
They aren't working on anything, stop being so gullible. 
---
Shhhhh don’t let blizzard know.
---
Yes, actually realized knowing when to keep an opponent shire up is a key strategy (ideally at low health).  Especially the high health ones, like Warrior's attack=armor one.

 Brawls, especially of brawliseum type, tend to be like that. Once meta deck has established, most of people are playing it. That's why I love random stuff brawls, they are always fun and unpredictable. But that's just how the game is.
---
They are nothing close to a monopoly, players have a huge amount of choice especially in the last year.
---
Welcome to Magic the Gathering. I hope the game brings you lots of good times. 
---
Waaaaaay too much work for me. But hopefully gonna help others.
---
I don´t think that would be that much work to fix a few cards. :-)
---
Umm, what you're saying is bs. Nobody is calling anyone a Blizzard shill, and these 'negative' posts are literally required or else Blizzard wouldn't have to give a fuck if there was no impending threat of people leaving. We need to keep them in a leash, or else they will monetize the game even harder to try and squeeze us completely dry. 
---
It probably won’t see play now due to the recent nerfs to druid but a 4 mana tutor 4 cards from your deck is absolutely broken
---
You make a great point when you say how they continually ask 'What would you guys like to see?'  
---
It comes off as so sincere. But the reality is they know what we want. The game rakes in millions of dollars, but new items can't seem to be added because they technology isn't there or they don't want to confuse people...  
---
Where are in game tournaments?  
---
Why can't I see achievements and what I could earn if I complete them?  
---
Why can't you release Tavern Brawls synchronously so the EU doesn't get hosed out of nearly a day?  
---
Why does your pre-release package for the card back sell for $50 when we all know you're just a glorified mobile game?  
---
Their art work and animations are top flipping notch. But their development and growth just depress me.
---
I'm so much happier playing Magic Arena.
---
Most people playing mtg know opening packs is negative EV and value tends to go down after rotation.
---
As soon as the world realizes the genius of my Orzhov Elenda Divine Visitation deck, they'll all pay.
---
I’ve been playing a Gronk Druid that does pretty well against it. Averaging about 8 wins 
---
Considering that a majority of the actually fun decks are being killed off with this rotation, I'm getting Witchwood vibes all over again.  I don't see this new meta being actually enjoyable.
---
I mean, that is kinda focusing on one little bit and not looking at the whole right? They did talk about other things. And though they put a spin on it they didn't give false hope on some things clearly people think they want like more game modes ( they are going to focus on existing modes being the spin way they said it). 
---
Also, the game has changed over the years. They make changes (nerfs) more now than before. They changed arena. They are spacing their content better throughout an expansion.  They are trying a new format for competitive. They made the new player experience better. 
---
If you don't want to vote with your dollar that is fine. But to say they promise things and don't deliver on anything is a bit of confirmation bias. 
---
Now that is not to say they have been the best. There are some easier things to implement that they haven't. Achievements, giving or selling the already made troll champion skins, increasing gold (though I wouldn't be surprised if that is not their call just like I think pack pricing is not their call). 
---
&gt;Hearthstone is now completely free and everyone gets every card every expansion" there will never be a change everyone will agree on. 
---
Ironically that change would probably cause more players to quit than any decision they have ever made.
---
I'm NA in Blizz's time zone and I haven't gotten mine yet...
---
4 classes not represented at all is yerrible
---
MVP (minimun viable product) is the newest shiniest bussines model in the video game industry, just spend enough to milk the most out the few who actually spend. basically leech the most loyal till the go.
---
It's just a silly move on their behalf as it deters purchases. 
---
Maybe they feel not offering dusting of the card will = more packs purchased.  
---
those are good solid legendaries that look positioned to have  good years next year too. congrats!
---
You chose a strange way to phrase your agreement. 
---
I don't think Hearthstone is yet in a place where a format between Wild and Standard is necessary or even desirable. 
---
I know Extended became a thing in MtG about at the same time in that game's life as Hearthstone is in now, but Hearthstone neither has the reserve list or any card even approaching the power level of pretty much anything on the Legacy Banlist
---
&gt;So... what we see is the game devs believe improving on the current formats in a number of ways is a solution to what the "community" in general is looking for.
---
Really having my doubts on this one...
---
&gt; I actual think the community overlooks that this is a mobile game primarily.
---
Says who? Why can't it be more than a toilet distraction? 
---
I mentioned sandbox mode because that's what's needed to come up with a new format. 
---
The devs have sandbox mode. 
---
We don't
---
Just gotta change your name to start with "aa" now.
---
&gt; Hearthstone may not be a dead game
---
When the meta incorporates new cards from the upcoming expansions, it might as well be a dead game for anyone who decides not to buy in with gold or money.
---
Don't listen to the others, spending your dust now will be a complete waste in 1 month. If you want to be smart, you should invest it into golden copies of the cards rotating into the HoF to get free dust. Only craft golden copies of one's you don't own, though. 
---
Haven't even clicked on it. I figured it'd be the same old song and dance. Agreeing with us that new features would be cool in a roundabout way that never means there's a shot in hell they'll spend the time to implement anything new. From op and these comments sounds like I was pretty spot on. 
---

---

I understand your point. The MMORPG market has completely different dynamics, and we can assume (I don’t have the data to back this) that the average player spends more time in WoW than on HS, hence the resource allocation. I think Blizz has a done a good job at penetrating the market, but too be quite honest, I just don’t think I see HS taking the next big step that we are asking for, simply because the card-playing market has been completely tapped. It’s a niche market. Look at your recent success stories, whom are they targeted at? Fortnite – children and young adults. We are calling for this shift in resource allocation from Blizzard when Blizzard knows damn well if they contribute more than 200M in resources (current COGS and OPEX) to Hearthstone, they may spending a lot on resources in a market that is already squeezed. It’s a Catch 22 and I understand why Blizz executives are being cautious; they have WoW Classic and the new WoW Expac (3Q20) that are going to be strong tailwinds for the company, so I don’t think taking resources from there is the right answer. It will be interesting to see what the card market is like in the next 12-18 months. 
---
if we also don't need another male human mage, wouldn't it make more sense to just say we dont need another human mage?
---
The "if" is the important part;
---
Thing is, people who play wild need to buy a lot less packs. 
---
Even in standard, I have a decent collection (not all the cards, but I have quite a lot) and if I look at a deck that "cost" 12k dust to craft, more often than not it just costs me like 3k. Because i have most of the cards already.
---
If you play wild, it's even worse (from Blizzard's perspective), because decks have a lot more cards that you already have, so you need to craft a lot less of the new ones. 
---
So wild is a lot less profitable for Blizzard, hence why they'll never invest too much into it/will never try to make it more popular. Standard is way more profitable to them, because people need more cards at every expansion. 
---
"Can you upvote this please?"
---
Based on what's going on at other studios at acti-blizzard as well I wouldn't put much hope in the sweeping changes people constantly expect. The shell of HS will stay the same, as it has done for 5 years, and they will put out the expansions and keep doing only that, until it no longer makes money and acti-blizzard shuts it down
---
If you are purely looking for cards... just buy card packs...?
---
No. We, the players, did during the Kobolds and Catacombs solo content.
---
AMA is an abbreviation for "ask me anything." As a noun it often means "an event during which a person will answer questions from an audience."
---
It's not that we don't like hearthstone. It's that the game judt has so much more potential and the devs just won't put any actual care into the game at all beyond pumping new cards out.
---
This. Haven't played hs more than a couple times since mtga came out. If blizz doesn't want my money wizards can have it
---
I originally started Hearthstone back when PsyStarcraft was playing it before he disappeared, so I've been around it since shortly after release.
---
I haven't enjoyed the game since The Old Gods expansion. I had always pressed to get rank 5 each month but once that expansion hit, I just couldn't bring myself to rank up anymore because it was just too time consuming &amp; frustrating.
---
As the expansions pressed on, I just hated the game more and more. Each loss felt crushing, and each win I found myself still bitter. I kept playing though because of the sunk cost fallacy (which is what the game aims for). I would log on to do the daily quests and usually either stopped or played a few more extra games until I was sick of it.
---
Eventually in October 2018, I just woke up (literally) one day and uninstalled it immediately. I haven't touched the game since. It's just not fun anymore, no matter how I tried to enjoy it. The newest expansion is the first one I didn't pre-order, buy, play, anything.
---
I haven't played it since, and I doubt the game will ever change and that I'd ever return to it. Just an insurmountable pile up of issues that they either do not address or extremely slowly. The biggest for me are the constant useless animations where I am waiting rather than playing (shudderwock is probably the biggest culprit before it was sped up, but theres plenty of others like elementals healing hero when you're at full hp). I don't care to list all complaints as I am just over it at this point.
---
I still lurk the forums sometimes in hopes that things change, but the game has so many broken components that the dev team only focusing on their release schedule (and continue to produce rage-inducing cards) that I doubt the game will ever return to its former glory.
---
There are people that do this. Anyone who has decided to skip a console and buy the next one, because it'll be backwards compatible. Anyone who, as you stated, only buys things when they're on sale.
---
If Wild packs were cheaper than standard packs, then some new players coming in might choose to only buy wild packs. Or standard players would buy wild packs just for the dust. Or players would just wait to get new cards until after those cards rotated out of standard.
---
Perhaps the alternative would be to make crafting wild cards cheaper, but leave wild packs the same price. That would encourage new players to continue buying standard packs, and provide an incentive for players with a large part of their collection cycling into wild to actually try the format.
---
One of these days, Lucy is gonna leave that football there and then we'll get to kick the ball. They can't possibly keep pullin' that football away, THIS IS THE TIME! THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO KICK THAT FOOTBALL TO THE MOON!
---
I thought it was pretty helpful. They’re clearly saying “what hearthstone is right now is what it’s always going to be. We’ll release new cards and do occasional balance changes but fundamentally the game is fully cooked and won’t be changing at all.”
---
If you’re happy with that great! If you’re not happy with that at least you know what you’re getting and can stop hoping things will ever change.

They also do that for Aussie prices, raise them in response to the exchange rate but never lower them when it reverses.

I know what he meant: Something different from what he posted. They teach us in English and logic class to *not* do that. This is an objective fact; it's not up for debate. But whatever, you're a part of the mob and the mob is emotion, not reason. I'm sure you'll feel you "won" this exchange.

This brawl is the single greatest thing this game has put out in at least the last 6, maybe 12 months. I've gotten over 1000 free gold, a bunch of packs, and for the first time in nearly a year had a ton of fun playing.

I've logged more hours of HS since Wednesday that I think I played in all of February combined, maybe including January, too.

Different strokes I suppose.

---
MTGA is really fun.  And for me, so far, the new player experience is fantastic.
---
I'm not to the point of making my own decks yet, still just playing with the ~12 preconstructed decks they give you for free.  Actually I'm still unlocking some of the decks, so every day when I log on there's a big new reward for me.  Once I unlock all the starter decks, I'll have to use the cards I've banked up to modify one of my decks to be better.
---
Seriously, I recommend anyone who reads this, just go play MTGA even if you don't think you'll get into it long-term.  It costs nothing to try it out, and the first couple weeks are very fun.  I can't speak for anything besides the new-player experience in MTGA, but so far it has definitely been worth my time.

I think the bigger issue is that Wild is a nightmare to balance and the balance of new cards can't take Wild into account because it would be far too difficult.
---
You know what's really sad? This game is dying. Sure it has its whales and its twitch players. But check this out. 
---
PAX South this year had ZERO hearthstone. Not even a casual tournament. When I went to PAX in 2016, hearthstone was all over the place, huge tournaments all over. Now...nothing. 
---
But it doesnt matter. As long as you have a few whales, and a couple 1k regs...you can bank. That's what casual gaming is, and sorry to say...hearthstone is a casual game. 
---
If we didn’t like the game, we wouldn’t feel so hurt by all the problems we see. 
---
Does Zihi give you 5 full crystals if played turn 1? This looks amazing, I never thought about using it.
---
Could you elaborate? Because imo pirate warrior was WAY worse than this
---
Blizzard hates him! Find out how he made 200g ever day working from home with one simple trick...
---
Who the hell expected wild to be supported? Balancing 6 sets in standard is already difficult enough and people think that Blizzard would somehow be able to do anything for Wild?
---
It’s not in the deck
---
Final stats for the bug: 2 mana 21/21
---
Genn and Baku are not healthy for Wild.  Odd Rogue/Pally and Even Shaman were the top 3 decks in Wild this entire year long.  Sure, they nerfed those decks for now with the lastest couple of balance patches, but if they don't continue to nerf odd/even cards then Wild will begin to suffer again.
---
I've been hoping for a competitve mode with custom rules since a long time ago. There are lots of old deckbuilding brawls that lets you try a bunch of creative strategies to counter the meta. Was really glad to see a Brawliseum for a custom rules mode.
---
Although, this mode might not be the best to be made competitive. The strategies boils down to whoever managed to kill their opponent fastest, by getting your broken cards early on.
---
The spell summoner brawl, the 10-mana brawl, the odd minions/even spells brawl, etc would've made a really interesting brawliseum.
---
That's bullshit and you know it. There are plenty of changes/additions they could make that would make the community majority happy.
---
Note that mana wyrm was nerfed tho so I'm not sure if this deck is as good as it used to be.
---
Activision &gt;.&gt; Force Mike Morhaime out so they can run all their bad ideas without any internal fight. Coincidentally, Diablo Immortal gets released at the same time and things continue to get worse. Is Blizzard going to turn into one of those meme game companies that end up ruining everything they touch.
---
Please Blizzard, start caring about your users.
---
Not blizzard´s fault you fail at f2p.
---
25g less than a month from a expansion with a huge rotation, gl winning anything by then.
---
It’s all about buffing the Spirit immediately 👌
---
I understand that, the guy I was replying to was saying that Alleycat was the wild card, and I said it was not in your deck. 
---
Secret pali, ubdertaker hunter etc. There was worse stuff before
---
Some incentive to play dungeons or adventures?  
---
 
---
Jesus Christ what a bunch of clowns.
---
Don’t get so excited. They say every year they will improve the frequency of communication but they never do.
---
Nah, Rogue wins if they're good unless Priest gets god draws. I've played this match a ton both ways, it's always fun though like you say. Rogue deck is built to cycle far more than the Priest deck. If Rogue gets a lucky Lyra or Prince Benedictus or similar card, they can pop off hard on the Priest. 
---
I got that one too. And somehow managed to complete it.
---
They don't have to be hero cards specifically. I just mean that whenever they release some new kinda legendary jazz, it either ends up being SUPER POWERFUL or super weak. Either way one side is getting shafted.
---
Hey now, Tetris players are scary.  I don't fuck with Tetris players.
---
Came here for Huntertaker... that shit sucked.
---
Those werent the entire meta, they were broken cards and yes some really bad archetypes.    Clearly there have been horrible broken/uninteractive decks in the past.  I am talking about the across the board though, it's never been this bad and this stale.    Taking every class in to account. 
---
It’s a mage, so they run polymorph, a lot at these ranks in fact.
---
There are also a bunch of different book of spectres mage decks, these usually run at least one spellbreaker.
---
It’s not uncommon in a world of deathrattle hunter and clone gallery priest. And wall priest. And even some cubelock at some ranks.
---
Totally fair, I'm glad you're enjoying it. My main point is netdecking ruined it but if you are finding enjoyment and success through that all the best to you. 
---
I have been doing this for years my friend ;) Now everyone has the tricks of the trade.
---
The only great plan to fix hearthstone would include it being recoded from scratch. That's the biggest limiting factor here. The second limiting factor is the game itself can only be so much because of the fundamental design of how the game works.
---
I'm actually not unconvinced that the giant hole in it's chest is a cloaca
---
I was going to axe the same thing 
---
Exploiting friends for money like a true capitalist.
---
I have a little tear in my eye. They grow up so fast...
---
Jesus Christ no. Classes have limitations on their cards so they can’t abuse them. Can you imagine a prep+psychic scream or resurrection+grommash? It would be hell. 
---
Not here yet...
---
Considering how henchmen are going to be a thing in the next set's pve content I wouldn't be surprised if there was an easter egg for playing hench clan thug against a certain opponent. It would basically be just a brief quip from the boss similar to how Splintergraft is repulsed by playing woodcutter's axe against her in monster hunt. 
---
People just don't understand vote with your wallet. It is the easiest it has ever been to be a smart consumer, from availability of endless information on products to the on-demand access to a trillion alternatives. The only thing HS is doing clearly better than all other digital card games is it's polish, which has remained as unchanged as the rest of the game all these years. So you are 100% correct in the fact that innovation does not make Blizzard money, the things that make them money do (lol). The cool board art and full voice acting for every single card are great aspects to the game, and unfortunately all it needs to maintain its place as a cash cow.
---
It's not healthy to lament these things, though. Yes, Blizzard can keep just snail pace nudging HS along, and while that feels like a betrayal of how the free market should work, its the free market working as intended. Access to alternatives doesn't guarantee HS must be at the cutting edge of digital card tech and mechanics, it guarantees that if HS in a shitty state you can play something else. The current dev care and pace is below what I would accept for a game I play constantly, so I just don't. Some tavern brawls and arena now and then, cash in my rewards a week or two into an expansion while hyping myself up on all the reveals and cool streamer content, get a couple weeks of grinding and self experimentation in. The amount of content that I can successfully pull value out of is only so much, but that's fine, Ill do something else or play something else outside of that.
---
For context, I'm a beta Destiny fan. The game came out and because I am a smort boi, I did my research and I was much less surprised and hurt by the reality of the content to be found. Regardless, it perfectly recaptured the grandeur and gun play of Halo all while telling a sick Mythic story entirely outside of the game (I just happened to enjoy this), so I was hooked. For me, this is Destiny's "HS polish". Now, that was like 5+ years ago. The only way I can maintain a love for that game the way that I have is that I stop playing when I have to, I have skipped some DLC and bought others after waiting for reception. HS and Destiny both call for a grind, so you can fall into sunk cost fallacy or convince yourself to suffer through some of the grind to reap worth-while rewards, but you should only allow that so much. Currently, I'm pretty 'on' Destiny at the moment because it's in a great state atm. That state being a seasonal release staggering, perfect for being 'on' a couple weeks consecutively every couple months. I'm currently very 'off' of HS, as it has been in rough shape for years. If it was my main game, I'd be tearing my hair out.
---
Trade with another person that has the same quest. 
---
You get 160g in total.
---
If they don't have 2 mana they will not use it
---
Opinion: this is every Tavern Brawl
---
3 or 4 don't remember. 
---
Custom in what way? 
---
I agree, i found it very practical when i learned it, but in this particular thread i think it's not so much rejection against the word but me trying to casually impose a grammar correction (that ended up not even being a grammar rule) in a discussion about the value of a hearthstone expansion, seing the bright side i learned something new which is nice.
---
I thought of doing that aswell, that was around kft release, everybody was running lich king. I read his name, and changed it back to english... why would they even TRY to translate lich? 
---
I might change it for a bit to see how different it is now,  but man lich king got me pissed off lol.
---
Dude, I fought that goddamn deck last night with my black and white vampire deck. It was one of the most insane games I ever played!
---
I was literally getting hit for 40 lifesteal damage a turn towards the end while dishing out 45. I topdecked just enough to stay alive and whittled him down over like 10 turns as he had gained over 100 life during that time.
---
It's at times like that I wish I could add people as friends to talk about it, lol. We'll get there!
---
4000 Dust
---
Some ideas that would be good as permanent modes:
---
60 card decks, no duplicates
---
Best of 3 with 10 card side-decks 
---
Commons and rares only
---
I've invested heavily in Hearthstone and am hesitant move away.  I do share the same opinions that Hearthstone has gotten stale.  
---
In terms of price to return how does MGTA compare to Hearthstone?
---
Is there a mode similar to Wild mode that let's me use cards that have rotated out?
---
How much money would I have to spend to have 2 or 3 competitive decks?
---
As a heads up, you double posted the top 10 from standard, and didn't post the wild one.
---
wrong bananas... 
---
This game needs more hype.  Similar to magic as you say, f2p friendly, and has a huge amount of account-level interaction (for lack of a better term) with faction leveling and all the rewards that come with it, and the huge amount of achievements which they keep adding to with every expansion.  Draft rewards monthly in addition to rank rewards.  Not that there aren't problems, I mean it exists, there will be problems, but I feel Hearthstone needs to learn a bit from their competitors.  Alternatively - I thought MTGA was a let-down. :shrug:
---
It's a game ending! ~~for the person who plays it~~
---
It's a marketing stunt like literally every other AMA you see on /r/AMA done by celebrities. Fuck that.
---
I don’t think it’s inherently flawed at all but it’s annoying it has to cut into the tavern brawl slot for everyone who doesn’t want to do it.  I like the arena structure way more than climbing ladder, but enjoy deck building more than drafting. Brawliseum is my main candidate for a new permanent game mode, ideally rotating format like the new Arena
---
I've heavily invested in Hearthstone as you.  How much money would I have to spend to have 1 or 2 competitive decks and in terms of pack rarity how often do rare cards cost?
---
So this is mostly (60% to be exact?) the same as if you went to HSReplay and sorted cards by deck win rate.
---
It’d be cool to map this against a Pareto efficiency chart with mana, health, attack to suss out the strength of card text relative to base stats. Then you could rank the keywords’ strength, or just find out which free form text is strongest.
---
Do the intro for Knights of the Frozen Throne solo adventure. It gives a legendary Death Knight card for completing it. It will help you win games on the ladder. 
---
If you want to it to be strictly f2p player, you can totally be that. I started playing this game 5-6 months ago, I haven't spent on anything apart from the welcome bundle. 
---
If you can afford it, do buy it. It gives 10 classic packs and a legendary dragon for 5 dollars. Which it totally worth it. 
---
Keep a track of the packs you open in the beginning. Every expansion will give a legendary card in the first 10 packs. Also it is worth noting that three expansion are going out of rotation at the start of next month. Try to avoid buying a lot of packs from those. 
---
Watch a few basic videos on YouTube on deck building. Don't waste much dust on crafting cool cards like I did. I wasted a lot of dust. Only craft cards you want at the moment. 
---
Once you get the hang of the game, you can craft anything you want. 
---
After you have a couple of decks made, start by playing ranked games. It gives classic packs after every 5 levels, I think. So you will get a lot of cards to build decks.
