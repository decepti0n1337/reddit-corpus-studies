The Echo vs repeatable has been brought up a lot, pretty sure its intentional, it just annoys me. Same for recruit. Why not do it all one way. Doesnt matter which way, just do it the same.

Who said this? This is like, week 1 hearthstone bs
---
But you dealt 1 dmg to it?
---
I am just glad that hearthstone has such a great community that can post advice about hearthstone it has helped me as a new player get better at the game.
---
Ha, this threads toast
---
Kalecgos would say **Millhouse Manastorm** the first spell you play each turn.
---
Wow!
---
Blizzard and the Hearthstone community are awesome people! :D good luck everyone
---
GL to everyone :)
---
No, check last moves beside. I dealt 2 dmgs and won that match.
---
LEEEEEROOOOYYYY JENKINS!
---
There is literally no world in which attacking first is the right choice.
---

---
Explosive trap? Dead.
---
Freezing trap?  Waste of mana and by attacking first you miss lethal by using 2 hero powers.
---
Snipe? Safe #1
---
Misdirection? Dead.
---
Venomstrike Trap?  Miss lethal via hero power 50% of the time.
---
Wandering Monster?  Miss lethal, die.
---
Rat Trap?  Safe #2
---
Snake Trap?  Miss lethal via hero power 75% of the time.
---
Why didn't he hit the button first!?!?
---
At least in explosive trap case you hit draw.
---
In Freezing trap case you have a second chance at lethal via the hero power.
---
I would like free stuff!
---
Cool idea.
---
Sup bliz love the game
---
Obligatory.
---
Thank you Blizzard

Comletitivehs is an even bigger joke of a sub than this one.
---
You wouldn't know them, they go to to a different subreddit
---
“whats with all this couch psychiatry?” says the guy spending hours posting about his overwrought analysis of emote use in a wizard poker video game
---
Holy moley I checked the subreddit on the right day. Willing to discard my deck and replace it with 2x copies of 5 random prizes plz.
---
Actually, in the current meta I don't think you even expect a mage to have a board clear really.  Normally you would absolutely hold off here due to blizzard/flame, but vs all the conjuring mages out there that rarely have aoe, you really don't need to play around it too much.  You are more worried about them getting double taunts from a giant or their 8 mana spell, stopping your ability to get damage via the board.
---
Welcome to the great tournament!
---
Stay awhile and listen.
---
My point here is maybe the community should reflect on their perceptions. They have chosen to perceive things in a negative manner absent any other data. This is an awful way to live life and maybe if more people perceive well played as the literal words it could become a larger influence. Instead I am being told that the communities negative perception is right and more people should follow that.
---
Hearthstoooooone

(:
---
Also if you're a new player, you really should NOT, and I mean it, try to netdeck during the first month or so of playing. You will get frustrated very quickly because 1) you won't be able to actually craft anything, 2) you won't really get to understand the strengths of each card and 3) you will not get to enjoy the thrill of playing a deck you figured out yourself. Deckbuilding is a big part of the fun in this game, don't spoil it :)
---
And as everyone said, your collection will naturally grow over time, but fairly slowly for sure. Always dust your golden duplicates (dust &gt; shiny). I would advise, if you ever get to open trash/meme tier legendaries (such as Nozdormu), to dust them if you need the dust. But don't dust your commons and your rares!
---

I have no idea what to say that hasn't already been said here. But congratulations to our community on hitting this amazing milestone!
---
Win a giveaway. Ez profit.
---
Is it weird than I don't like playing certain classes because of heroes appearance? :) Don't want to be judgemental, but I just don't like playing Horde characters lol! Also I don't see myself playing Warlock and Mage. I was always a Priest / Warrior / Paladin in my WOW days, so I guess I'm stuck with those, haha!
---
Thanks!

---

---
Hell yeah free stuff
---
I stand corrected! However, there is evidence where I can confirm that they deliberately chose not to include echo on Unstable Evolution because it's not quite the same and do in fact have different interactions

Yes very similar topic, only difference is teabagging has a bad reputation so I can kind of understand the resentment while being offended by a "well played" at the end of the game seems like satire.

I've been playing Shaman mostly this month (along with some mid range beast hunter). I try to get rank 5 each month for the golden epic, but play very casually. This month I got up to rank 2 with mid range elemental shaman. I've done the legend grind before, and I'm pretty sure you could get to legend with enough grinding with mid range shaman.

Let's go!
---
I've been back and forth on this. Before the final blows seems kinda rude but if you do it after the final blow the opponent barely has time to react to it.
---
Sweet
---
But what if you're playing Sir Annoy-O?
---
Wooooooo!
---
LEERRRPOOYYYY JJJEEEENNNKKKIIINNNNSS!!!!
---
This is awesome!
---
RNG gods bless me
---
It'd be insane against random opponents.  Simply impossible 'if the perfect counter deck was being chosen after winning a few matches because they're f2p'.
---
I think he meant boardclears/removals being interactable (or the lack of) since they’re all played straight from hand, as opposed to board-centric decks where everything is layed out openly on board fairly for all to interact with.
---
I got double Emeriss because of Barista Lynchen and got them both from Rafaam
---
#freeshit
---
Warrior isn't as good as people think. The deck is weak against fast decks and it's obliterated by some tempo decks like khadgar mage. Against aggro if you draw poorly once and you start with a mediocre hand it's game over. If you don't draw your clears reasonably early(which are not even many, the deck has 6 clears) then it's also gg. Against decks with big tempo plays such as big shaman and summoning mage and against mecha hunter it's again gg.
---
I feel like people(at least in my rank which is r1-r5) have built decks that obliterate warriors. These decks have their weakness but they can easily hold their ground against other decks as well. How I see it, the more the meta involves the less warriors we'll see. Arguably decent deck but without some good taunts they have a weakness to be exploited, which is the tempo weakness.
---
Hope i win, been playing HS since 2014

Good luck everyone!

I don’t win things so this is perfect! The new expansion is a ton of fun!
---
I think the problem is when you win/lose a game like really badly, like the game wasn’t even close. Even in real life if you’re absolutely beating someone with no chance for them to win the rules of etiquette kind of change and it’s best to just say nothing at all unless they say it first.
---
It's mega-cheap too.  The deck uses like four rares, rest is commons, with optional legendaries if you want.
---
Missed the mech value from hero power on last turn... amateur mistake.
---
Huh? I don’t get it
---
Zag zag

This Giveaway is going to be BANANAS! Good luck everybody :)

Excellent idea! Super cool. Hope I win.
---
Wow gl all 😁
---
Echo differences can be due to the effects of specifically echo cards and the new cards. eg. [[Mistwraith]] is not triggered by Witch's Brew.
---
IMO on keyword ordering. The most important ones should be at the top. [[Mosh'ogg Enforcer]] is a taunt minion. Its identity is more about taunt than divine shield.
---
[[Zilliax]] is firstly a magnetic minion. Then it's a Taunt/Rush/Lifesteal. It's stating Magnetic as a separate keyword to the other three because it's of more concern to the person playing the card, it has those other three affixes or you can Magnetic those other three affixes on. eg2. [[Missile Launcher]] magnetic is listed above the other effects.
---
[[Al'Akir]] is foremost a Charge minion and used as such. Having that listed first makes sense imo but all the affixes are roughly similar in value for the way he's used.
---
Congrats and best of luck everyone!
---
Woohoo Hearthstone!

Hope I win this giveaway. Great stuff!

That user has a LOT of posts in The_Donald, so its not surprising really.
---
Rogue is high-variance.  If you draw the Miscreant, do you draw the combo tools?  If you draw the combo tools, do you draw Edwin?  If you draw Raiding Party, do you draw both your weapons first?  If you draw Togwaggle, do you also draw Lackey enablers, that you can play on curve?  Etc.
---
Yes, Myracle has a lot of redundant cards, because the deck is built around having as much burst damage as possible at all times.  But the gameplan also depends heavily on draw order.
---
Also, in my experience, taunts are really necessary.  There's not enough lifegain in the format to do without them, for most decks at least (warrior is an exception).
---
"2" and "two"
---
top level comment f2p btw
---
Good luck
---
Who else loves Hearthstone? 
---
“Heh, this guy’s toast”
---
You being insecure and unable to deal with what is common manners in real life does not make the emote system a mistake.
---
"Two" vs "2"
---
One uses the numeral 2, the other spells out two.
---
Ohhhhh my mind just automatically process it into the same thing
---
[removed]
---
Duel! is kind of a dumb card.  It's playable but not good, thankfully, but if it ever is good then it's just "do I win or lose on turn 5?"
---
"2" vs "Two"
---
Gimme that bread
---
Hello, fellow humans.
---
nerf everything
---
PLEASE This needs to be done.

It needs a few tweaks, minor cost adjustments and lower the appearance of a few cards in the discover options but otherwise a vast improvement.

Hi

This is an entry.  Pog

You must work for blizzard. :)

I don’t think disenchanting Lucentbark is a good idea. It may not see any plays now but Heal Druid truly has potential and they may introduce new cards to support this archetype more in the future.

“Small chance though”

go go Hearthstone booster club

4 phones and an iPad haven't had this issue for me or my group of friends who play. It's not just my one single instance. But I guess the 4 of us are just lucky this widespread bug hasn't happened to us? Frankly you kinda went into attack mode without being provoked.

Hooray for 1 million! Good luck to everyone!

Congrats on the milestone. I’ve been playing since the beginning in 2014 and here to support another year 🎉

Hearthstone is my go to game when bumming around after work and socially a great way to keep in touch with my brothers (interstate).

Thanks for running this giveaway! Good luck everyone!

Sense demons actually screws you over in cube lock where you DONT want your voidwalker to pull a 1/1 or Gul’dan to res a 1:1.

It would be a nice buff to the only deck that uses this card.
---
Ya this pack is mine

Congratulations! I hope the community continues to grow positively.

There’s also the wild mech hunters, who can really ramp the board fast and hit hard. Last time I checked it was still a (very cheap) tier 2 deck

Awesome bud, appreciate the help!
---
A top level comment
---
A budget deck can also mean a budget version of a meta deck, i.e. a deck that isn't optimal because it runs cheaper cards instead of slightly better but more expensive cards in some slots.
---
Thank you very much for the chance Blizzard and wish good luck to all nice people here around!

Top level comment.

Let's do this

Isnt it the same with the upgraded hero power from Rogue? The knives have/had the TGT logo even if upgraded by Baku
---
I'm not sure about that, I'd have to check
---
Hearthstone.. Best game ever!!! Good luck!!!
---
blizzard devs: hearthstone is meant to be on pc. it wont run well on all mobile devices.
---
also blizzard devs: i hope you all got phones that can run diablo!

I saw it pass by when researching for this post, but didnt find it huge enough of a deal since i barely see those logos

I’ve gotten to the point where I’ll just force close the app and re-open if there’s a gap of more than like twenty seconds in the action, to pre-emptively avoid one of these disconnect screens.

Which is ridiculous, but still.

I cant tell if you’re mad at the meta, mad at Blink Fox, or mad at the Blink Fox meta.

#How to Get Better at Hearthstone
---
#1. Find the best Deck to play
---
&gt;The most important thing for your first climb is to pick the most "overpowered" or "Tier-1" deck.  This will mask a lot of your early mistakes as you learn to play at a higher level and reduce the time to climb.
---
If there is a recent [Vicious Syndicate Meta Report](https://data-reaper-report.vicioussyndicate.com) I would use that as a primary reference.  [Hearthstone Top Decks](http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/?st=-HCT&amp;class_id=&amp;style_id=&amp;t_id=&amp;f_id=&amp;pt_id=1&amp;sort=new) keeps a pretty good curated list that is great between meta reports.  And [Neon31HS has a good Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/neon31hs?lang=en) that lists as many Legend decks as they can. *(Overwhelming but very thorough.)*
---
* I wouldn't use sites like [Hearthpwn](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks?filter-is-forge=2&amp;filter-unreleased-cards=f&amp;filter-show-standard=1&amp;filter-show-constructed-only=y&amp;filter-deck-tag=1) because they use clickbait stats and are often more fun/memes then competitive.
---
* I would [only use HSReplay if I had the premium service](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i) or wanted to find my opponents deck.  This is because they only show the winrate across all ranks.  So while a deck may show a 65% winrate across all ranks, it might have a 45% at 4-Legend.  You just don't truly know the best decklists (Also, doesn't capture breaking decklists because it requires 10 different submitters with at least 400 games.
---
* I would consider using decklists off /r/competitiveHS because they do a good job curating there and stay away from clickbait titles.  The plus side is sometimes you can find a guide along with the list to help your mulligans and reduce the learning curve.
---
* [Finally, you can see the strongest deck archetypes over the past 24 hours by using VS Live](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/data-reaper-live-beta/).  It tells you the 5 best decks for Legend, Rank 1-4, and 5-14. (*and its free*!)
---
#2. Identify Your Mistakes
---
&gt;You can get better playing hundreds of games and teaching yourself or you can speed this up by watching your replays, hiring a coach, studying other player/streamers, or using a premium service ([HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i))
---
######"Actively" study Replays
---
If you don't want to study your own replays, you can find high [Legend replays for your deck archetype at MetaLegend](https://metalegend.com/).  Before the player makes their move, make your decisions on mulligans or lines of play, say it aloud to commit yourself, and if the player does something different, ask yourself why.  Be harsh on yourself if your line of play deviates in the slightest.
---
######Find little known streamers to ask questions. 
---
There are lots of streamers who are Legend and never hit the front page on [Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Hearthstone). Scroll down and find high ranked players with few viewers. (Look for Orange Diamond signifying Legend rank) They are a lot more interactive then the "top streams" where you have to make a donation to get seen and are probably playing purely competitive decks. (Instead of "fun" decks).  Alternatively, you can donate money or subscribe to a popular stream in hopes of having them answer your question. *(You can give a free sub with Amazon Prime)*
---
######Discord isn't a bad option either
---
You can join the /r/competitiveHS discord channel from their subreddit sidebard and there is a channel called ["Team-Up"](https://discordapp.com/channels/172846449854382081/458609710346534912) where you can voice chat with other players as they climb.  Even if you can't get free coaching, maybe just hanging out with a better play would help you learn.  If you don't want to voice chat, ask if you can add them as a friend and just spectate them.
---
#3. Learn the Mulligans
---
######Use a Premium Service like HSReplay for Mulligans
---
&gt;Paying for services or a coach can reduce the learning curve/time.  But is entirely optional and unnecessary to reach Legend.  
---
I don't think this is needed but the extra step besides studying players/replays is to pay $5/month for access to [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i).  Here you can look at the best performing decks at Legend and see their mulligan winrate percentages versus specific classes or decks.  
---
Knowing the right mulligans will increase your winrate by at least a few percentage points.  On this data alone, I think the Premium service justifies its cost for at least a month or two to fully learn and identify the correct mulligans for each matchup.   It's also useful to identify the underperforming or weakest cards in the deck as those are viable options to cut for tech cards.
---
######Find a Coach
---
Instead of [HSReplay](https://hsreplay.net/ref/PPYx6i) you might find someone on the Hearthstone Discord (as mentioned above) who is willing to spectate/teach you how to play their deck.  Or you might offer to pay someone to teach you the ins, outs, and mulligans of a specific deck on a site like /r/HScoaching. It is up to you.
---
good luck guys
---
Yes I’m having fun with my favourite card,  Blink Fox.
---
MTG also doesn't allow you to hover over a card to see the tooltips. In traditional collectible card games, not knowing a keyword requires you read through the rulebook, which is a massive disruption if you have a set with a lot of one time used keywords. 
---
In hearthstone this problem doesn't exist, since hovering the card shows you the full text.
---
Good game.
---
they're doing this on purpose at this point

Thank you Blizzard,  ver cool

Whoop hearthstone!

Very very nice
---
And Omega agent is one stat below par in exchange for getting to be 12/15 of stats. All of the Omega cards are strong at 10 mana. The problem is that warrior has easy access to big removal and aoe removal in spades at the same time. !remindme one year and I promise you this card not be that big of a deal.
---
Wow
---
Easy hoodie!
---
The warrior mirrors run 2 of the 3/8 that pulls out a minion and they can get more from boom and the omega card. It's an instant loss if mechathun or the galvinizer get pulled. I don't know of the decklists but I'd say probably 20-40% of the time one will get pulled by fatigue.
---
Cool

I've had a rough day. Free stuff would be nice.

Like any other version of big priest, it can clear the board if it's weak enough, which makes it passable in all matchups. It can always lose to control warrior if he draws both brawls and supercollider too.

Have been playing since beta, it's nice to see that the game is still alive and strong after all these years
---
thanks
---
Comment!
---
Yeah consistency in this game is basically nonexistent, especially in their terminology. They often alternate between "battlefield" and "board" for no apparent reason.
---
"If you have a Mech/Beast/Dragon/etc." type of card texts don't specify where said cards have to be. Should they have to be in your hand, board (battlefield?) , deck, where? If you can't bother keeping them consistenct, at least clarify the most basic things on your card texts ffs. That's the most important role of card texts. That's what they are there for.
---
These are only a couple out of so many problems the game has with texts and inconsistencies.
---
Packerino?
---
When Barbabus (from druid quest) makes all minions cost 0, psychmelon NEVER draws cards. Therefor it does not use original face value.
---
N i c e !
---
Heh, greetings, traveler.

Good luck!

Very nice. I am always very happy to see people older than me being even remotely successful in competitive games. 
---
I'm 28 myself and I already see the struggles of adulting.

Finding HS was great for me, because it's still a competitive game, yet not as time-consuming as League of Legends (I used to be diamond but I quit the game by the time I got my M.A - not enough time to stay relevant).

X-cost cards and cards that cost X are not the same AFAIK
---
Gl i guess ?
---
People try to win in Ranked. Just jam Casual until your Casual MMR stabilises and you play people at your own level. Just learn the game from there. Don't bother getting the optimal deck. It really doesn't matter at that level. Just play a consistent, preferably minion-heavy, deck.

Meanwhile your opponent is having an anxiety attack the whole game because he effectively have -40 health and he could lose whenever you end your turn.
---
I can’t sympathize with you because Bomb Warrior is not a fun deck to play against no matter what its winrate is or what deck I play against it.
---
The only counterplay to bombs is armor, playing elisyianna, keeping 10 cards in hand or force draw them so you can heal in portions. Neither is viable or early enough and the bomb warrior could just easily add in more bombs.
---
Well met!
---
Thanks for everything you guys have done, I play the game every day and don’t know what I’d do without it, keep up the amazing work ^-^

Rotation increased the quality of the game by a lot. What really baffles me is that I’m not even motivated to log in for the daylies lol. Anybody else feeling that way?

Had something similar. High rolled and smacked a warrior with my AlAkir with two of Ysera's nightmare buffs on him for lethal from almost full health out of nowhere.
---
Added him to say how lucky I was and he said no problem and that it's fun when stuff like that happens and we wished each other good luck on ladder .
---
Lovely stuff
---
Very nice!
---
It's a good deck if you're good. It's a terrible deck if you're bad. 2200 is pretty cheap though.
---
Countess Ashmore should be changed to state specifically that it only draws minions I will admit that. 
---
Countess Ashmore works exactly how the card reads. It draws a Rush card then Lifesteal then a Deathrattle.  I don’t think most people are going to assume it uses a hidden code instead of just doing what the card says in the order the card says
---
For a moment there I forgot the taunt has more attack if it's the only one on board.. haha

---
Hi there
---
I play token druid and I think it even existed in ungoro. 
---
 It depends on what deck type you prefer.
---
There are good aggro decks currently but also good control ones.
---
If youre looking for aggro:
---
There‘s like tempo rogue or token druid
---
If youre looking for control:
---
Big shaman or control warrior or mech hunter
---
Go to hsreplay, there are good stats and infos about every current deck ;)
---
I'm in charge now!
---
Thats funny if you go to tournament in the usa i dont see them putting chinese or spanish or french or whatever on their screens and posters? Why would you expect any different?
---
By fire be purged!
---
O.O interesting
---
They could also bump the cost of the Hero Power to 4 mana. I get it, it's random. With Rush on Mechs it should be fine though.
---
Been playing everyday for a couple years now
---
Blizzard, will you bomb or pass?
---
It's happened to me multiple times, I always thought it was my wifi though.. have I been deceived??? lmao
---
Always midnight as far as I know
---
Congrats r/hearthstone
---
We're gonna be rich!
---
Its also an instant loss if they pull out an elysiana or panda, so this isnt a good reason to run elysiana over mechathun
---
Im Innnn
---
just give me the goodies!
---
Handbuff warlock lol
---
I'm just glad quest rogue is no longer a thing. Every time I saw that crystal core prepped followed by two stonetusk boars I wanted to ram my head into the wall.
---
Summoner Mage isn't a bad counter you know.
---
New'ish player.  Casual amount of play over 2 weeks now.  After spending the first week struggling around trying to create a deck from the cards I owned - which resulted in a totally laughable deck.   I then followed an online budget Hunter deck - which I've managed to now craft up - and it got me to Rank 16 before the reset yesterday (I believe I could have got a tad higher, I was still winning more than losing - I just ran out of time).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My question is quite simply really - I like this Hunter deck, I like playing it and I am aware it can be improved by crafting Legendary cards......but I also feel I want to play other decks.  I'm never going to spend much or any money on the game, so should I just keep playing the Hunter and trying to improve the deck.....Or should I follow another online class and craft another budget deck for variety.
---
Basically a Legendary card costs 1600 dust (I think) so I can save and make a improvement to my hunter.   Or I can save dust and create another budget deck of another class.
---
I actually have beaten Priest on my 4th try (RENO RAZA KAZAKUS) but I've barely beaten Rogue. It took 80 bosses

---
Sounds good.
---
Token druid is strong currently, i usually get to rank 15, but as I made this deck I played much more, because it‘s so fun. Now I‘m at rank 5. So if I can do it you can do it too ;)
---
I fucking hate this card, there’s not much point in playing control without this card, and I don’t have the time to play 25 minute long games
---
free loot 😀
---
I had the same idea with dollmaster! You should consider swapping ysera and/or malygos for alexstrazsa. Alexstrazsa let's you close out games when you have 4+ lucentbarks on the board. 
---
I'm not sure if adding in a baleful banker is good or not, but basically it can ensure your dollmaster+ juicy psychmelon always hits a Lucentbark. So it's like 2 lucentbarks in one.
---
As for the healing, I've noticed that burst healing of 5+ is usually more consistent than smaller amounts. So if you have stalladris, that's 2 more heal 5's, and ancient of lores are surprisingly good.
---
Hunterace don't trade go face
---
Let's go, thanks hs team!
---
My Dragon Control Shaman deck have a decent winrate against Control Warrior.
---
Playing multiple Elysianna battlecries is overrated. If you get powerful enough cards from her the first time you don’t generally need a second go if the Warrior used up his removal (brawls and warpaths)
---
And who are you to decide what players should play? Are you that arrogant you want the other player to concede because you think they have no chance of winning?
---
Thanks for giving back to the community, this encourages me to come back to Reddit more often.

Here’s to hoping I win something!

Yeah, also Master's Call, completely forgot about it
---
Savage Striker's battlecry can *only* target enemy minions, while Savagery can target *all* minions, since it's not specified in the card's text. I'm guessing Savagery was meant as versatile single-target removal that can hit your own minions if need be, not some Enrage Druid synergy card lol

Sense Demons was from a time when Blizzard wanted every card to always do *something* when it's played, even if it was something as minor as giving you two [[Worthless Imps]], or [[Mindgames]] giving you a [[Shadow of Nothing]] if your opponent had no minions left in their deck. Forge of Souls (and Ice Fishing) only cost 2 mana because they *don't* have a "consolation prize" like Sense Demons does. If they removed the Imps, they'd likely have to reduce the cost to 2.

Warlock is my fave class but I always get the meme ones of warlock legendaries. I didn't get Rafaam, Jeklik and Soularium but I got Fel Lord, Hireek and Morrigan. I mostly unpack the paladin legendaries and HS developers like giving palas good stuff so it feels good.
---
Sure, why not.
---
Good luck y'all

If it’s not Boulderfist Ogre artwork then I don’t want it!

If I bought the 40 pack bundle, which set should I buy? I’ve purchased the newcomer bundle. I know that a lot of good decks right now have rise of shadows cards, so would that be my best bet? And what happens when rise of shadows comes to a close in a year? Cards are obsolete??

Honestly the quality of production looked awful on twitch, the venue choice, the quality of hosting, the level of attendance...

I couldnt believe it was the HCT finals... They seemed to really dropped the ball

However, they will see asian markets as the growth markets and nothing will get in the way of chasing dollary doos

Not really. Boom gives you a hero power that isn't dead and gives your mechs rush. The tempo loss is won back quickly. As you could see it also allowed him to deal with a Nomi to some degree. Meaning that with Boom a 3 Nomi clear is actually somewhat realistic. Boom's just that good.

Omega should have been used differently. Doubt it made the difference.

That sub ain't to everyone's taste but at least it's fucking gameplay related posts I can see from time to time and have a half decent discussion on deck building, climbing ladder, metas etc etc.
---
Heya Thanks for the giveaway blizzard &lt;3
---
That's the price for playing crutch decks. Unfortunately, we have to pay it.

Worth a shot.

Top level comment!
---
&gt; I did not do it since I knew that if I shared my experiences about the event it would not be broadcast, and if I didn’t shared them, then I would be lying to the viewers by giving the impression that everything was fantastic.
---
Why not? Honest feedback, even negative one, is very useful for the organizers and might help someone in your situation down the line.
---
Congratulations congratulations your first two paragraphs have confirmed to be that you decided to be the latter; an ignorant, delusional keyboard warrior.
---
&gt;The idea that hearthstone doesn’t have a lot of competitors is purely ignorance on your own path. Let’s see we have Animation Throwdown, TES: Legends, Magic Duels, Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links, Plants vs Zombies, Card Wars Kingdom, Ascension, Marvel Battle Lines, Clash Royale, as well as a variety of other smaller online TCGs so hearthstone is clearly preserving in the face of a multitude of competitors
---
You didn't need to waste your time to type that, because before you even did I already check on the history of online TCGs and yes my sentence above still stands. **Hearthstone does not have much competition**. Do you need to read it again to maybe get a little sense of what I'm talking about? Need to read it 5 more times? Ring any bells? Or did I have to embarrass you some more to point out that these title do not pose significant competition to hearthstone. Btw you may want to touch up on your "copy paste from wikipedia" -ing skills with the inclusion of plants vs zombies and clash royale being an obvious stretch from what we are talking about.
---
&gt;Now as for the article you linked it’s completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. The article talks about the importance of design philosophy and each color needing identities and new mechanics. These are all things that Hearthstone has oddly enough already. It doesn’t have a thing to do with pedantic differences in the order of keywords on a card which is what I’ve been talking about the entire time which you may be too arrogant to understand.
---
Also try to read more than the first sentence of the article maybe? I know reading is hard for you but come on, you aren't even trying.
---
With a reply like that, I don't think I have to add on any more from my previous point. It's seriously hilarious.
---
I'm gonna be rich!
---
oh great.
---
Mage all the way!
---
The problem with two stickies from Blizzard in a row with "1,000,000 subs" in the title, is that I didn't notice the first one had been replaced with a new one.
---
Why arent the shirts for sale online?
---
I don’t know what a top level comment is, but please pick me ROFLMFAOOL
---
entering contest
---
Just feel like it's been a known since the game was made that HS does not use overly accurate/wordy card descriptions. But honestly it's a design choice rather than an issue. They don't want the cards to be as intemidating to new players as MtG and u cant really fit too much text on cards if u want the mobile experience to be good. So, they use as few words as possible to get the pint across without confusing the player.
---
beep boop
---
When will the new solo adventure be playable?
---
Uhhh free stuff is cool but idk if it's already done
---
Oooh
---
because my favorite card, hum hum, is wholesome
---
Wish me luck! (Noone will lol)
---
I know we give you guys “constructive criticism” very often, but we really do appreciate what you do. Thanks for making hearthstone such a great game!
---
You either scheme toggwaggles or you win turn 6. To win turn 6 you need perfect draw, including Deckhand on 1.
---

---
I'm just hoping I win something
---
I got my first one with a druid, I think. I use that card back with pride.
---
Yes
---
The problem with two stickies from Blizzard in a row with "1,000,000 subs" in the title, is that I didn't notice before now that the first one had been replaced with a new one.

Very cool indeed
---
Please Blizz, I don't ask for much
---
Blizzard rocks!
---
That one is pretty interesting, like it could easily say that it gives the minion charge, which it does. I remember getting my Dirty Rat stolen by inner fire priest all the time with potion of madness and getting insta killed z.z . I guess the "gain control 'until end of turn' " text implies that it gives charge cause how else would u take advantage of the minion for just one turn, but that maybe stretching a bit much lol

This was your fault. SIM cards are dirt cheap. When you're in Asia you really need to think ahead. Especially in a Chinese area. Not saying I would not have made similar mistakes, but I am surprised you didn't leave to get a Sim card so you could listen on twitch.

Appreciated.

I often well played when I'm winning because I want to acknowledge that it was a good match. I really hope people aren't interpreting that as me taunting. Also I wow and well played a lot moves mid-game that really swing the board, like a literal well played, but wow I tend to save for stuff that really surprises me or is just ridiculous rng. Like, I was recently playing a match and I had a 16/16 quartz elemental that got brawled twice on boards with 4 minions and it lived both times. Whoever that bomb warrior was I'm so sorry, you didn't deserve that.

This is the only game I’ve played since 2014 or whenever it was incepted (is that a word?). All the fantasies I’ve had about rocking some hearthstone merch and using that as a means to meet other players would finally become a reality. Between a shirt, hoodie, and a wallet there’s a chance you could openly invite conversation about hearthstone into your life everyday.

Druids have so many tools but warriors should be able to win

Cards move into wild once a year.  Cards that are in standard stay in standard for 2 years.  So RoS cards won't rotate out until April 2021.  Personally, I would buy classic cards to build up a strong base but buying RoS is a good choice too.

It is a problem. Recently, many people have been suffering from silent disconnects, myself included. The problem isn't our wifi connections. Essentially, the game will disconnect, but no notification will appear. In other cases, you'll get the notification. Playing on my laptop is no problem. But playing on mobile, results in several disconnects per game. Ultimately, rendering the game unplayable.
---
Awesome, I'd love to win.
---
All the spell based tools we got in witchwood/boomsday for priest were balanced around radiant elemental, so its just too slow for the benefit you can get and recurring villian doesnt provide a big enough payoff against removal as opposed to whelp for instance. 
---
Paladin can pull it off but thats because of their weapon that makes buffing the villian super easy.
---
It’s really nice to see the Hearthstone developers being so involved with the community and even hosting giveaways.
---
Asian countries are all like that. They don't give a fuck about foreigners. Thats why I have always thought keeping the tournaments to America's and Europe only.
---
Hope the bot does I've seen 100 of these posts.
---
So, you say that, but the new Tezzeret's static ability is "Creatures and Planeswalkers you cast have affinity for artifacts." Affinity for artifacts nowhere else in this set.
---
A win would be a great bday surprise!
---
Ah, here we go again
---
Guessing he is just doing it so he can shield slam your turn 4 giant maybe? That would be my only guess. Still a Chad move.
---

---
Comment.
---
Goodluck people!
---
Good pick!  Hunter is the best starting class and is going to give you a really strong starting point.  As free to play you can definitely field top tier decks but it is going to take a lot of time to build up a collection.  You should definitely try other classes as playing any one class gets old quick.  I would check out as cheap alternatives silence priest and Murloc shaman.
---
Sure. But at least it's not meme filled shit posts. It's not a perfect or great sub by any means. But at least it tries to have some effort of talking about the game instead of memeing about it.
---
Woohoo!
---
He's a buy a box promo that only enfranchised players dropping $100 on cardboard would see, and is very notably *not a draft/sealed card.*

---
It's been happening A LOT recently, at least on EU. It's gotten to the point where I'm surprised if I go a few games without DC. 
---
The most annoying thing is that sometimes you will get disconnected without knowing and without the game notifying it. So you just sit here thinking "man how long is that jackass gonna take to play" until at some point you realize it's definitely taking too long and the rope still isn't there. You restart the game only to find out that you skipped your turn and basically lost the game. 
---
As another user said, you basically have to restart your game if the opponent takes more than 10-20 seconds of inactivity, "just in case".
---
Deck builder is broken in wild, or was last I checked. Pretty sure blizzard has confirmed it. 
---
Works fine in standard though, if you try similar cards there.
---
New-treants! Lol I see what you did there!
---
If it's not too late I'd like to enter as well.

Is it related to certain mobile carriers or something, or have I just been that fortunate to never experience this issue.

---
Still part of the set and anyone who decided they wanted to look at the whole set online would see "affinity for artifacts" on him. Just because not everyone would own him doesn't mean they wouldn't see him.
---
A hoodie would be super awesome considering that it’s still been snowing in Michigan. Thank you for offering this for us all. :)
---
You could say that mountain giant is doing double time and getting double pay
---
Golden players and players with legend carbacks are not always good. Play around with different budget decks and watch the meta snapshot. If you have friends who play ask them to spectate it can help a lot. It took me a long time to get good and I still misplay often.
---
literally unplayable
---
Just trying my luck!
---
Whaaa? People can still win? The Pandaria card back is still my favorite one to use.

May yog smile upon us

Yes hello thank you

---
Congrats!  &gt; Available to receive stuff here &lt;

When was this?
---
Literally unplayable
---
That is quite a narrow-minded approach to designing card text. It should be readable to people *picking up the card to read it in a casual setting.*
---
I would thoroughly enjoy some cool stuff from you guys
---
let's go
---
Give me some goodies!!!
---
Haha I guess, i was thinking he wanted to shield slam anything I played to keep board control(?).
---
Can I get some packs? :D

People are missing the point here. Where on this (JOIN US AT THE HCT CHAMPIONSHIP)[https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22927850/] blog post does it mention anything about needing to speakers and read Chinese to enjoy the event? They are clearly marketing tickets to an English speaking audience with no disclosure that there will be literally no accomodations for them until the final day.

Lets go boys! Yogg time

I think it’s about postage. I’ve won a giveaway once on another organisation and when I have them my address they said I’m not eligible. But they were ok with it being sent to a youshop address.
---
I'm honestly unsure. I'm with a mobile carrier called "three", in the UK. As I mentioned before, my internet connection is pretty good. I can play on my laptop, with no problem. However, as soon as I play on mobile, I disconnect constantly, with both these silent and non-silent disconnects.
---
I have hope
---
Roll the bones!
---
I wish to win!!!
---
Merch! Merch! Merch!

Basically it just has set templates for high winrate decks.  Then it takes your cards and matches them with a template and exchanges "similar" cards out of the template for the cards you already put in.
---
The autocomplete has no knowledge of anything Hearthstone beyond that.  For instance, if you put in a 7 drop into a druid deck last expansion, it would give you Togwaggle druid with Azalina missing for the 7 drop you put in.
---
Certainly better than it used to be, but far from praiseworthy imo.
---
Fair play Team5, fair play
---
Bring back gallery priest qq irl
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not disagreeing with your point, because the first time I read it, it got it confused with convoke since it doesn't have the reminder text. I was just pointing out there are holes in the example you gave.
---
Thanks for the contests!
---
ha ha yes
---
does this count
---
Interested to find out what that hoodie looks like!

give prize please

s of the following items and if you are selected to win, you

May the Elder gods grant me darks advantages in this competition!
---
Thanks for appreciating the community! This is a wonderful way doing that! 
---
I'm in 😊
---
I understand your frustration, I’m Canadian but Quebec can’t participate because we have a rule to protection the participant. I hate when that happen.
---
My only complaint is it makes hard to call you Nazis when you're being so reasonable.
---
No, only to you.
---
The year of the dragon is upon us!
---
Yeah summoner mage is a good deck. You’re not gonna beat a board full of 8/8s, so you’re best off trying to apply early and mid game pressure. Play around mind control tech and voodoo doll as those are their only hard removal and “AoE.”
---
Gamer time :)
---
I want me some swag 😎
---
I forgot to mention I am NA so I wonder if that has any bearing on the DC issues.  I wish you the best of luck on ladder though!
---
Lets get some packs
---
Oh I’m sorry is Humble not in your extensive vocabulary?
---
if you were in the position where literally any card would have given you the win, you probably shouldn't have played that lackey
---
Neat
---
Woooohoooo
---
Yizzle
---
Thanks for the opportunity
---
Well, why not ?
---
Congrats on the milestone!!! Here's to 1 million more!

That's a lot of subscribers. Hopefully we'll get more of them in the near future.
---
There's always a possibility to SMOrc him down before he can get Dr. Boom, but it's not consistent. There's also the option of leeroy + scheme + wonderous wand (from heaistbaron), but it's not consistent. The overarching point is: the matchup is bad, so your best bet is your opponent having a bad draw (so you can have a chance at a 10/10 edwin on 3 without it getting executed).
---
Stuffz for free? For a game i love to play? Hell yeah! Good Guy Blizzard!
---
Nah it's actually not even that good vs control warrior since if the warrior draws 2 brawls he only needs a way to deal with 1 Nomi, which is quite possible especially with rushing mechs. Nomi priest is really good vs token decks and can sneak in a win vs almost anything with its' explosive turns.
---
Thanks for doing this!!
---
hm might as well throw my name in the hat. Thanks!
---
Insert comment here
---
Horribly favored vs warrior. Just works as a good rogue/aggro counter
---
Lol, a lot of western countries don't give a fuck about non-native speakers either.
---
I'm totally gonna win.
---
Ready to get this t shirt
---
i like hearthstone more than the amount of eggs laid by chickens

I am getting cold ... Maybe a new hoodie would help. Thx Blizzards ^^

I attended a Chinese only Gold event in Nanjing China back in 2016. It was free for attendees. My wife and I were definitely the only Westerns there. Made for easy viewing. They were actually really accommodating. There was a sign showing how you could win a card back and someone came over and explained it to me. Then the host at the entrance said he would hook me up (ended up not working cause I think it had to be an Asian account). Everyone was really excited to see us there- in general the Chinese is that city didn’t get many visitors. It took place in a hotel so the WiFi wasn’t a problem. The atmosphere was great. I’m sorry you experience wasn’t similar! But as I tell my wife, “Low expectations are the key to happiness.”

If Witches Brew is cast by something other than the player you'll get a copy in hand.

If an Echo card is cast by something other than the player you won't get a copy in hand.

Woah
---
KAZE NO YOU NI
---
I would've liked the pun better if nutrients were actually a thing
---
Honestly your small point alone is more compelling than OP's
---
Ha! This guy's toast.
---
That's not the point
---
Yep if you attended an event in the US, there would be a 0% chance there is mandarin language anything anywhere.  At the end of the day, op should have contacted the organizers in the first place to see if they could accommodate him.
---
I want those tasty packs
---
Well, good luck everyone!
---
Doing your homework is what op should have done yes.  I bet they organizers might have helped him if they knew he needed it.
---
Good luck y’all!
---
Even potion of madness not mentioning that it gives the minion charge? If the card did exactly what it read, why would anyone bother playing it? To get a single EoT effect? Not every one of these are justifiable. Maybe intentional.
---
Thanks blizzard!  Great idea.
---
Thanks! ;)

I think it’s awesome that you guys are doing this, and I would love some hearthstone swag.
---
&gt;I dunno this post just rub me the wrong way it sounds like a douchy foreigner that thinks he is Entitled to everything.
---
Man, calling someone paying hundreds of dollars to attend the international world championship of Hearthstone 'entitled' for expecting to be able to understand things or participate in things. Everything is just entitlement when it comes to gamers I guess.
---
I have no idea how your post is upvoted. Stay classy /r/hearthstone.
---
Unless it's something massive like League of Legends/Dota/CS finals (for example) or IEM, the venues for esports events are a bit of a grim reality. It's easy to think that "it's just a stream", but most of the production budget gets put into the broadcast - which isn't wrong since that's where 99% of the viewers are - and that shows.
---
Basic things like seating, refreshments (water), bathrooms and international support are then left on the lower end of the budget allocation spectrum. Then there are the venues that just weren't designed to house that many static people for an entire day and the air tastes like sweat halfway through.
---
Grats on 1mil!

Ooh nicee

All we can do now is pray

Is your mom a part-time artist? Geez she's good. Tell her I said hi!

PLEASE GIMME THX

That used to be a real move vs face hunter but in the recent meta I can’t believe that is worth it. Pinging on turn 4 is only doable if you don’t hero power his face. Seeing that I would just ping his face turn 2 or 3 and giant lives unless he commits both slam and execute

Hope I win

VEGAN GIVEAWAY OMEGALUL

Plz

I wish yogg smiled upon me
---
My first comment specifically said to have different wordings in standard and Wild so your 3rd and 4th paragraph are completely irrelevant.
---
I don't see why Witch's brew wouldn't thematically fit with Echo considering it's Hagatha's 'throwback' card. Unstable Evolution is similar, although to a lesser extent, both could definitely get Echo without the keyword seeming out of place.
---
And as for Recruit, that's a fair enough difference, but I'd say it's a small enough difference that they could simply choose one of them and then merge the keywords in Wild
---
Hand space on turn 1? Lol

Neat. I'm in

Top Level Comment. PogU
---
This is exactly the opposite of my experience when traveling around the world.
---
In my experience, when in an Asian country they have a lot of signs/menus/etc translated, albeit often poorly, to English, and if you try to communicate with them in English and they're not able to accommodate, they're apologetic and embarrassed about their inability to use the de facto international language.
---
Whereas when traveling in the Western Hemisphere in Europe and South America I've seen from tourist-facing infrastructure not only a lack of effort or apology, but often a sort of smug arrogance like, why should we use or learn English, you're in my country.
---
But... yogg can’t smile, like physically?
---
Greetings friends. Congrats
---
I just comeback to play Wow and Hearthstone again, from a long pause.. I must win something!!

I hope I

Oh look at that

Hearthstone.

Thanks, Hearthstone!

Southeast Asia is very hospitable and while they might not have everything for you, they'll try their hardest. 
---
Maybe you have negative experiences, but a bigoted generalization that "asians dun give a crap about you" is such an unnecessary kneejerk.

Well met

Hi Blizzard!
---
For real.. I closed hearthstone after it said my opponent left in arena, since that means I won.. come back to see that i lost my last arena match due to a disconnect
---
Wowie
---
Because Blizzard is an American company? If they want to expand their brand internationally, fine, but to completely ignore their home country is pretty stupid. Might as well move the whole operation to China if they don't care about English speakers.
---
I wonder what language do you speak when someone visits your country. English or their language?
---
Gonk time
---
What a great initiative! I think I'll take it!
---
I love winning contests almost as much as i love blink fox
---
So they piss off the 0.1% that are from non Chinese speaking countries.  Seems fair.  Is WiFi uncommon in China?
---
Gratz, enjoy :)

Why did you cut ranks out? Embarrassed that this is probably at rank 5 and you cant even reach the low ranks with rogue?

They have to accept your friend request too

I never win anything.

Yup i pushed like 3 ranks in wild

To be fair, they don't put anything in Mandarin when there's an event in the US or Europe, but Hearthstone is a game from an American developer and publisher and all its main marketing (Blizzard streams etc.) You'd would expect them to better accommodate English-speakers even in foreign countries.
---
Depends on the country I guess. When HCS was in Amsterdam, I'm pretty sure English is all you needed.
---
Awesome!
---
DIE INSECTS!!!! Wait, no...sorry...i meant to say LIVE INSECTS (and pls give a hoodie...)!!!!

I'll enter.

What's a top level comment?
---
Ya once ppl have favorite decks companies either tend to nerf or add synergy (or both) until it's clear that the decks are basically being printed rather than just cards. I will say tho if you find just the right recipe you can still win with homebrew decks. Actually climbing the ladder tho is way faster with a tier 1 deck.
---
Aloha, Blizzard.
---
Good blizzard
---
You should contact the support
---
Well played!
---
(No BM)
---
I enjoy raiding!
---
If a Chinese company hosted an event in the US and advertised it to people in China, then proceeded to have everything in English, that would be pretty fucking stupid. 
---
OP shouldn't have to put the work in to be able to understand everything at the event, they should already be accommodating him since they're an American company who advertised the event in English to Americans. Why not just say "Hey btw if you don't know Mandarin don't bother coming" instead of pulling a bait-and-switch?
---

I was just making a point that there is a spell consistency in hearthstone where numbers indicate the value that is changed with spell power. 
---
I have never tested this with dark bargain but it could be a thing - pure hypothesis.
---
Thank you so much for doing this!

Is that like patron level? Because I hit 26 for that

I like free stuff and hearthstone!

Hello! Hello! Hello!
---
The one where he “drew” blink fox from his deck was funny because it was a play on words. None of the others have ever been funny
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Same. I've had more shadow disconnects where it doesn't reconnect and have to restart the client.
---
I like stuff.
---
I'm in :)
---
As another reference point, Zilliax was common in many decks in the last meta while Flark was basically just considered a fun card, if he was considered at all. I opened him on Day 1 of Boomsday and played around with him for a couple weeks. I had forgotten that I had him in my collection until this deck surfaced.
---
It is likely that Zilliax will remain relevant all year while Flark will probably fall out of favor again. Probably.
---
fucking tired

I have my hopes up despite my astronomical chances of winning. #OH BOY!

Some of them reward packs from the related expansion, most of them just a card back. The new one will reward some card packs, but it costs to unlock.

Must be a bug you gotta contact with the support I guess

What does this have to do with reaching low ranks?
---
Didn't you think that you put yourself in a losing position just because you were holding a card that you can't play? It is dogshit in every way. You need actualy cards to beat token druid or rogue, you don't need that card vs control matchups, becase it holds no value.
---
I’m almost sure it’s to slam a turn 4 giant
---
Anything would be nice. Never won a giveaway before.

I think I still qualify

how LONG can it go ON?

Praise Yogg

You don't need to open massive amounts of packs to get Harrison. He could be in any pack. And he doesn't cost any more than any other legendary. All legendaries cost the same and have the same pull probability, so why in the damn hell can't a F2P player have Harrison? I had him back when I was F2P.
---
Is this thing on?
---
The only place in Europe where this is true is France and then the rural parts of other countries. You go to big cities in any non-France European country and most of the people you meet will speak English better than the average American does.
---
That's not what I said
---
nicee niceee
---
The whole point of hscj is to make fun of people here. Trends have to start here or hscj doesn't have anything to talk about!
---
Not the best pun since "nutrients" doesn't work in this context. It's close-- you could have made it work with slights tweaks to the punchline. However, the true answer is because of Savage Roar. Many aggro decks are able to flood the board but druid has a solid finisher that is often able to do ~20 damage in one turn.
---
I like hs and I like free stuff. Yay
---
Yogg take the wheel, boys!
---
Alright, let’s do this! Leeeeroooy... oh wait, yeah that’s a good legendary. I want charge meta back :D thanks for fun times and congrats on 1kk subs! :)

I would like a prize.

With my luck I’ll win the girls wallet.  Still gonna rock it though.

[HSReplay can answer that question](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#includedCards=52715%2C52627) - they exist, but they're not very popular or very successful.

THAT'S INCREDIBLE
---
Add a Test Subject to generate extra spells?
---
Oh yes. The glorious Classic and Basic sets definitely didn't have any card packages. 
---
Ice Block, Ice Lance, Alexstraza, Frost Nova, Doomsayer, Frost Bolt, and Blizzard definitely weren't designed with each other in mind.
---
The same goes for Murlocs generally. The certainly weren't designed to get used in the same deck from the get go. That was just a coincidence.
---
Shield Block-Shield Slam was something that surely was created entirely by accident as well as Acolyte of Pain and self-damaging synergies.
---
Same goes with Northshire Cleric, Injured Blademaster, and Circle of Healing. All a player discovered combination.
---
(Also, there weren't any dragon synergies within the classic and basic sets. that only got released with Blackrock Mountain)
---
Really though, all decks from the vanilla age of the game were still pretty much "designed" by Team 5. It's more that the player base from that time was so much smaller and the knowledge base of that player base was so much more limited than it is now it feels like Team 5 created "all" classic and basic cards without each other in mind.
---
thank you

Oh you.  Leaf Druid alone.

Oh no😂

Everything was in English. There was a bit Czech language as well but less compared to English.

The Witchwood is a rotating set that has already been released with less than a year left in Standard. I doubt replacement cards will be inserted into the set like they were in the Classic set.
---
Even then, three of the classes that are short one card out of about sixty are doing just fine.

Usually I'm not one for salty posts but I started to run into these warriors at Rank 10 and they are everywhere now. This deck really does have a bit too much going for it. It's hard to handle no matter what deck I try to use against it. 
---
I have a top teir deck for every class and I have yet to find a good match up vs this Warrior deck.
---
It's awesome - best tracking (-device) indeed!!!

It's functionally identical to affinity but they are not the same. For instance, a hypothetical enchantment with "your creatures with affinity have haste" would not affect it.
---
Congrats boooiiiii
---
Ty. Likewise.
---
 So , thats it?
---
A nerf to Tempo Rogue will also be a nerf to Control Warrior.
---
Hearthstone Heroes of warcraft ? More like Heroes of the tavern !
---
This may be an aspect that not everyone considers: Blizzard really really cares about the number of lines that it takes to write down a card's effect; to be precise, they don't want to be bigger than 4. This consideration does not justify small differences like "it", this" or "he", but that's the case for Scourgelord Garrosh's "adjacent minions". In the end i's not that big of a deal, but I see OP's point
---
Whoop

Thank you Blizzard!!!

When does Blizzard usually release new patches for nerfs? I opened some rogue cards that many people are saying would get nerfed soon so I'm hoping for some full mill value to build a fairly optimized deck. I was planning to main rogue first but now I'm not so sure with the possible nerfs and dust is rly valuable for me so I can't afford to make a mistake. Could anyone speculate the effects it could have on top rogue decks? Thanks in advance
---
No one to share with, but been playing since launch. Never been higher then R10 before. Might go for legend this season! Playing mostly Thief Rogue, Aggro Druid, and Nomi Priest. Switched to Bomb Warrior but only after a losing streak to recover stars then back to the others.

So, I don't like your example with Landfall. I thought about it with War of the Spark when I saw Evolution Sage. With Tireless Tracker it would have read Landfall - Investigate and for Evolution Sage it would be Landfall - Proliferate. I feel as though they did it that way so it isn't just two keywords. We've got Landfall in Zendikar, Battle for Zendikar, Worldwake, and Oath of the Gatewatch. I know those take place in Zendikar, but WotC generally doesn't use the same keyword two sets in a row.

MTG Arena and MTGO both tell you what keywords do. Most paper cards also have reminder text for non-evergreen keywords.
---
there is a difference if i a shitty player complains and actually good player complains. The good one atleast knows what he is talking about, seems like you need to spend less time here and more time playing rankeds so your ego does not get hurt
---
If you can always predict what is coming, then why don't you play around it and win?

Thank you based Blizzard!

I still play HS today but every expansion I pray for a return to our old power levels. I think they are waiting for the hero cards to phase out along with the expansions they're from, and they're going to bring them back down and slow the game down.
---
It's so boring having to build a deck that has an insane win condition because the other win conditions in the meta are retardedly strong. I can't just build a good deck with a strong curve and solid tech cards. I have to have a ridiculously overpowerful combination in my deck like Khadgar + Power of Creation or Chef. 
---
I don't think the boredom argument holds any weight because things don't have to change for them to still be fun if they're good enough in the first place. Plenty of games do not alter their gameplay drastically to keep their players entertained. You run the risk of losing what made the game fun. I think that is why we're seeing a collapse of the competitive scene along with many notable figures stepping back from the game despite earning a living from it
---
It's too different from Vanilla Hearthstone.
---
So much this, this 'one deck' stuff is wrong. Play arena IMO, nothing teaches you the game fundamentals that you describe better. Patience. Then you take what you've learned there, with the knowledge of the popular meata decks of the time to ladder, watch your homebrew climb, slaughtering all the tier1/2 netdecks piloted by misplayers, all the way to rank 3.... where it starts getting hard.
---
Is there a release date for the Ros solo adventure?

Great work, but your comments on Shadow Madness and Potion of Madness are incorrect.  When you gain the minion, it keeps its present state.  It doesn't gain charge.  If your opponent plays a minion, passes turn, and then you steal it with Shadow Madness, it can't attack.    
---
The minion keeps its state when stolen.

Oh I almost missed it yikes
---
Everyone get in here!

Yahoo thank you :)
---
Yup. And it's probably the one card keeping Mech Paladin out of Tier 1. It's basically "Silence and Destroy this minion for one turn" and absolutely destroys me.
---
&lt;3 Thank you!
---
Wow 1mil crazy to think how far this sub has come. Long time lurker for years. Congrats mods!
---
Congrats! Make sure you have fun now!
---
No I mean like for example when you play the lich king you get “death knight cards” and ysera gives “dream cards” these are both different class cards that have a different background and get replayed with Tess, I am wondering if there are any more examples of this and I think the addition of more classes would break the game massively
---
Except it's very clear that the healthy came after the "nutrients ≈ new treants" because:
---
- Nutrients don't make things healthy.
---
- Treants don't make deck healthy.

They're just vaguely related concepts that make it seem like the pun makes sense, when it's really just saying "hey, look how these two unrelated things sound similar"

I would be happy if I win something

I’m sick of this meme, but that was too high effort to downvote

love you blizzard!

I've been using 1 Youthful Brewmaster and 1 Banker...I like it because I can rescue a battlecry/rush minion in matchups when I don't need to shuffle Elysiana twice, but I guess you hit fatigue one card earlier that way.

There is nothing more entertaining than waiting for 3 minutes for a rope that will never appear on your opponent's turn only for you to realise you are actually not connected to the game and your opponent is probably 3 turns ahead already.

I think he made a lot of questionable turns, of course I dont know his hand or anything, but If I recall he brawled like a 4/8 twilight drake, an ooze and a messenger raven.

Stealing a minion with mind control or sylvanas  is also stealing a minion, but it doesnt keep the same state

Heyooo!
---
On one hand, sure I get what you're saying and yeah it's too bad that things were how they were.
---
At the same time though? It's a shame that none of your Asian friends told you or warned you(maybe you don't have any?) that well...this is how things were very likely gonna be.
---
This is Taiwan. Their primary populace is going to be their own. Foreigners aren't going to be catered to. The organization that did all the things with the event were Taiwanese and it's very much a Taiwanese event. I could tell even from the stream really that with all the signage being in Taiwanese, literally everything about the event is Taiwanese.
---
Honestly with such a bitter taste in your mouth, I'm not gonna bother if you enjoyed Taiwan. As a foreigner it was probably a horrible place to go to and you'd never recommend anyone to ever set foot there. You wouldn't have enjoyed the food, the surroundings, the culture, nothing. You were a stranger in a strange place and nothing more. You came, you looked around, felt out of place, angry that all this travel money was for nothing, and left.
---
This is one of those reasons why personally I don't travel alone, or at least have a friend who lives in that country to show me around and/or help me out. In my case I would be probably a lot more fortunate because well...I'm Asian and so I'd be able to get around a lot easier and even if I can't read the posters or this and that, I wouldn't be angry about it. It's Taiwan being Taiwan.
---
So yes. I'm disappointed for you, sure. But I'm not surprised.
---
Nice strawman bud, I clearly outlined why War of the Spark is a bad example. It's like saying that Battle for Zendikar has landfall and so it's proof that landfall can appear in any new set as a semi-evergreen (ignoring that it's the same plane).
---
In other words "You correctly analysed why the basis of my point is flawed and I'm salty about it."
---
Congrats on the 1,000,000!
---
Best comment in here.
---
Mage is an issue when you lose the game on turn 4 to kadgar and 4 mountain giants
---
lol, why even go to these? they are boring enough to watch online.
---
I was there!
---
Savagery vs Savage Striker aren’t the same bc the latter only targets enemy minions
---
Spell shaman makes mince meat of them.
---
Commenting! Good luck!
---
I low key think mecathub warrior is the way to go right now: beats aggro with control package and control with mecathun payoff. Only problem is that I’ve had mecathun Yeet-bot’d out of my deck too many times to be hurt again
---
Nice pack. A gold leggo and 400+ dust
---
I would love to win, please!
---
Yep
---
You play wild so you can BM your opponent when you highroll a turn 3/4 combo that somebody else showed you? Cool life.
---
Tron is a good modern deck - little expensive though.
---
Lifesteal + Deathrattle
---
I can agree with recruit but those repeatable each the  cards might as well be echo... they don’t even belong to a class that can benefit from having the echo keyword lol
---
And he provides a ton of removal and board control. Still can't win mirrors.
---
Awesome giveaway! Thanks Blizzard!
---
May RNGesus be with us all!
---
BRING BACK BRODE
---
Just in time!
---
Yeah because it's an even card. Weapons project was always basically a 2 mana 2/3 weapon.
---
Loving it so far. Hit rank 5 yesterday for the first time in about 4 months. The best thing? Did it playing a homebrewed tempo warrior list. For awhile now it has been net deck or nothing with the insane power levels so being competitive with something of my own creation is soooooooo refreshing.
---
7 mana 4/4
---
GLHF, I will take that, as you wish, aerhhhhhhhh
---
“I’m sorry, little one”
---
Also "Discover " is an ungoro keyword I think? why is this exempt from replayable this turn -  I'm sure they can come up with other longer bullshit wording of it
---
UGH
---
Its ok since u have 3 oozes in your deck
---
Commenting to enter.
---
I miss having to play 5 druid decks in a row!!! Bring it back!!!!
---
The sorry emote was pretty much exclusively for bm imo. I prefer the wow emote because it can be used for bm but can also be genuine. 
---
Im never sorry in a game of hearthstone.
---
And people wondered why I posted that...

In my experience I mostly face the same netdecks in wild casual that I see in ranked. Odd paladin, big priest, kingsbane aggro rogue, quest mage, cube lock, etc.
---
Honestly I see more off meta/homebrew decks at the ranked floor than I do in casual.
---
Murloc 4 life
---
Insanity!!
---
Anybody know which class a win as either Rag or Nef counts towards for quests?
---
When you look at the ppl that keep trying to push that meme you will only find them in some weeb/cringey/meme subs...I mean it's nice to have a clear picture of ppl that try to meme things to death but damn...it's one walking stereotype after another.
---
Hey I'm running murloc shammy as well, and I like the look of this.  What're the belligerent gnomes for though?  Why not Amalgam?
---
He is scared of that ooze so he can use shield slam on it. I know what u are thinking but he can just use coin for that next turn but he wants u to know that so u play around it and not play your ooze
---
"Just head to the locker room"  most people don't get that bitter about losing.
---
Or in my case a memeworthy deck
---
Toight!
---
Here's hoping for some sick hearthstone art!
---
GL bois
---
Power of creations screw your book of specters over.

Ravens are ok since you dont have a turn 3 play besides using the coin or mountain giant, though i havent played with them yet

Nice.  I'm at 65 packs and 2 opened legends.

Tech Undataka to get a second?
---
I thought you printed keywords so people learned what they were and you could make less text on a card.
---
If a new person comes across an old keyword that’s not in standard, you can hover the card and it’ll explain the keywords.
---
Not sure why they stopped printing the older keywords.
---
They should add a keyword “dictionary” to the game, maybe with some other rules.
---
hehe, fixed
---
Good luck everyone.
---
Leeeeeeeeroy jenkins!
---
Pretty please Blizzard
---
Just checked and the odds of this comment winning are about 1 in 368. I guess it's worth a shot!
---
Yea i was rank 2 1h20mins in. Had a hot streak of wins
---
What the fuck is this fucking shit
---
Been playing Hearthstone since the day it was released (I was invited to beta but didn't realize until the game launched, lol). So a shirt would be cool!
---
At least I have chicken...
---
What did it cost?
---
Hello HELLO hello!
---
I used the previous posters stats as my baseline.  I didn’t come up with 99.9%.
---
RNGesus, I only ask this one thing of you.
---
I love Toast
---
so far today I played once as Rag, and barely won; then played once as Nef and barely lost.  small sample size, I know, but it seems to indicate neither deck is OP OP over the other
---
Nice giveaway, hope I win :-)
---
I don't have that problem.
---
Do you have that problem with other games?
---
Priest took me a full pre-nerf Razakus build with Reno and the doctor boom boombots with double deathrattle to complete. No duplicates or anything and I had perfect draw. That deck was easily the strongest deck I’ve ever played in the game.
---
To be fair for the keywords not being re-used its common pratice.MTG for example  does the same thing when printing reference cards to mechanics of another set. Everything yeh, it is just poor planning.
---
More like pay2play.
---
It didn't take me a fraction of the time you spent vomiting this shit post out of your mouth. I would offer a tic tac, but I can't even get close on account of the smell.
---
like 99% of tavern brawls it is completely fucking retarded and only played to get the one free pack
---
Accicents, they happen, ya know?
---
So just a comment huh. Sounds easy eno... *Messes up comment*. Oof. Better luck next time.
---
Ah~Looks soooo good 😳
---
Lmao
---
Basically true, except the chance of that happening is very low..
---
Good luck to everyone! Hope I win :)
---
More than likely he has a shield block so he only has to have a little armor to be able to slam
---
Rafaam is class restricted though. Sure if you like playing warlock it’s great but not everyone does, especially since the only viable warlock deck is zoo right now. Elyssiana is good but you lose out on your deck and put yourself into fatigue much quicker that way. Unless you have a way to bounce her back to your hand it’s insanely hard to win with her.
---
That's the most specific "i suck against Bomb Warrior so Blizzard needs to print a card that helps me" post we had so far.
---
Bomb Warrior not only dropped hard in popularity due to Mech Hunter being way better, they also can be outplayed by half a dozen decks WITHOUT tech.
---
It could be a card like destroy any cards in your deck that didn’t start in your deck
---
Mech hunter bro. Try it. People understimate it but if you play your trackings wisely you will win most of the match ups.
---
He can be amazing but can also suck the big one.
---
Silence is a basic mechanic which is a counter everyone has access to. For those one off games where you get a huge VC on turn 2 you typically burn all your gas making it big.  If it sticks you win, if it’s dealt with you lose.
---
Also sometimes having VC in hand feels super bad when you can’t effectively activate. 3 mana 2/2 tempo is soul crushing.
---
Shaku is a neat replacement idea but I like VC where he’s at now, totally fits the rogue feel of ‘cheat to win’
---
Woop Woop!

I like that idea better. Would work against Hakar too.

But there are birthdays more common than others 🤔 jk

thanks for calculating the odds tho lol
---
Can you link the mage deck you used?
---
Conquest bad, specialist good
---
Holy Man, congrats... BTW the dude u played against was "only" rank two I would be mad
---
I've never hit legend but is the rank 5 boss about as hard as the legend boss? Some months it takes me weeks to get past rank 6...
---
I went to AMS for last year world's and the experience was amazing!!!
---
So it probably had to do with the fact that it was in Asia... Or maybe it was a Ben Brode effect??? 😀
---
But what's strange to me is the not free WiFi part... That, I really don't get.
---
Good bot
---
Would love some hs swag :~)
---
I have no time for games!
---
I am not buying packs cause I want to use my gold for the solo adventure. I want to crack packs! ;\_\_;
---
Yes please.
---
Still, would have understood with rank 1 but 2...
---
9 out of 10 games I play are against bomb warrior. I’ve not faced a mech hunter at all. All I encounter are Conjuring Mage and Bomb Warrior. Maybe a tempo rogue here and there.
---
Thanks for this
---
Sign me up. Thanks!

No changes to "Classic/Basic" sets.

You what mate?

Thanks Blizzard!

Plus coin doesn’t really do anything for him if you think about it unless he coins boom on 6 otherwise a giant has more than 5 hp so dyno doesn’t do anything he won’t need brawl if he slams the first giant before you use your spell on it even then brawl isn’t good better to have the armor to slam it cause even if you bird on 3 he still had the armor with block to kill it on 4
---
https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/deck-library/mage-decks/conjurer-mage/alex-conjurer-mage/
---
It makes sense, playing kalecgos in a deck which hardly runs any spells is kinda weird. You'd just pay 10 mana for the 4/12 body and 1 random free spell.
---
They already said they are going to release it mid expansion to avoid the staleness in the game during that time. Even if they do have it finished now or not, they wont be releasing it now because its not optimal.
---
I feel that Bomb Warrior, albeit still prominent, starts to dwindle down in the meta. The win rate is also not that much higher than other deck types in current meta.
---
No. Generally speaking, there is skill gap between those ranks. Not a big one, but it's there. Also, there are no win streak bonuses at that rank so you can't get to legend from rank 1 4 stars like you can at rank 6.
---
Reaching legend is a huge grind and the people who undertake it on a monthly basis are generally better players than the people who get to rank 5 every month and just stop or play for fun the rest of the month. Just because they play a lot more games.
---
Based on the past, I think they'll announce it a day or 2 before it's live.
---
r/ludonarrativedissonance
---
NA?
---
Nice, so I basically cannot play any other Control deck because I lose to Elysiana Warrior.
---
10/10 meta

So our response to being plagued by meta-decks in the non-meta space is just giving up?

---
Has there been a event comparable to this in the USA or other english speaking countries? If so how was their setup for non english speaking people? Id be surprised if it was any different. Honestly tho this all sounds like I would expect at a event, in Taiwan.
---
there are already so many ragnaros cards, yet somehow I can't disagree with anything you said.
---
He's the first legend player of the month, he wasn't legend before the game.
---
He was rank 1 playing against a rank 2, and won to hit legend. There weren't any rank 1 player queuing at the same time.
---
Like swatting insects!
---
Poor choice. Rag is the better one this time around
---
Gotta Go Fast
---
*Whoa
---
But Rag is way better...

Started yesterday. Following the guide...
---
How do I track
---
&gt;**Beat the Expert AI:** After beating every normal AI Hero (including Mage), *Expert AI will become unlocked. They have better cards but you want to beat them at least once for the 100 gold.*
---
Does the UI show whether I've beaten the Expert AI?
---
Let's do this!
---
On the glass half-empty side, it also has the effect of making it much harder for people to finish buying packs for an expansion and craft the cards they want and then forget about the expansion.
---
The singleplayer content contains a significant chunk of packs, which heavily throws off any timing on when to stop buying based around the pity timer, forcing players to decide between:
---
 1. crafting early and potentially opening duplicate cards they crafted (or missing the chance to receive from packs in the case of legendaries),
---
 2. or else waiting until after the singleplayer content is all released, missing the ability to craft and play a strong meta deck in the first few months of the expansion.
---
Easy to see why Blizzard would like this, but kinda sucks for players.
---
Rmemeber the before times? When we used to like this game?!
---
That's what a lot of people have asked for since I've been here (4 years now). It's been a common request.
---
At the very least, they should change the mode name to "Unranked", so new players don't get confused. Many new players stay in casual for too long playing matches and end up get curb stomped by older players, when they should be playing ranked.
---
Not much replayability. Boring after the first few.
---
It does suck that even if we planned to get the adventure from the start, we still have to get our packs later on. Packs are a lot more valuable at the start of an expansion than a month in, after people have already done their crafting.
---
yes, pls
---
Doesn't require legendaries.
---
Lol the fact you have a device to post that means you handled it better than I would have
---
Quick, someone tell this one to Firebat, Hearthstone World (dad joke) Champion.
---
oh, sorry, on NA =/
---
Depends on what you’re facing, but with perfect play yeah probably. But if you look through the comments you’ll see I recommend changing the deck slightly if you don’t have ZJ.
---
(I need to read the post, before commenting, first...)
---
Would love to!
---
Am I doing it right?
---
Tonight, a tale of glorious **OGER**
---
Unfortunately it does not :(  
---
I just used to go down the list in order.  It can really suck if you miss one (it happens) and you have to start beating them again until you find the one you missed.
---
That’s what they think but really they’re just giving people a bunch of time to farm gold and get it for free.
---
I definitely would have dropped real money for it day one but by the time this comes out in another 2-3 weeks there’s basically no chance I pay them for it.
---
Love the kids downvoting me. And you morons still wonder why you get bullied and beaten up in school.
---
He is wasting server performance on a game at which even bots are better than him.
---
You're right, it's not an excuse.  There's no need for an excuse.  It's just a reason, as valid as the reason to bring any other deck into casual.
---
You are throwing away your card though to reroll.  This means you also have 1 less favorable spell for Zul'jin to cast.
---
We'll get some kind of mid-meta shakeup in a month or so. 
---
It will be real minor though. They tweak a few cards by adding 1 mana to them. Don't expect something huge.
---
Yeah, I'm in that boat.  I just wanna reset my pity timer but I know I still have 15 more packs to open over the next 6 erso weeks. My biggest thing is just duplicate Epics.  I will feel upset if I open an Epic I already crafted in the next 15 packs.
---
I've actually seen the physical goods giveaway sticky, but somehow completely missed this one. Can somebody link me with the actual thread for this one?
---

Is there a contest for longest climb to legend? Because I'm about 5 years in so far.

Lets just wait to know the release date before jumping to conclusions.
---
So if ranked decks can be played in Casual and casual decks can be played in ranked (ha), why even bother with two modes? If Blizzard is never going to take steps to make this game less inherently hostile to anything non-meta or homebrewed, everyone should just be ranked for every game they play.
---
Can you tell me how im on phone cant brose the comments
---
I hate Mill rogue. With a passion. During its hay-day I auto-conceded to every rogue I saw.
---
It greatly improved my enjoyment of the game.
---
I'm just saying that it *is* a valid option.
---
Infinite value though.
---
;-(
---
This was posted on r/art on my account I just thought people here would like to see it.
---
No MCT seems kinda weird
---
You can go into casual with any deck, I see no problem with that. I do think that matchmaking should be focus more on decks than on the players.
---
Yes. Apxvoid’s list doesn’t use him.
---
Now you just need a headcrack for infinite damage!
---
HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO WIN IF NEFARIAN PLAYS 7/7 1ST TURN AND ALL I GET IS A 5/1 ON TURN 2.
---
Weid, I dont have that hard time against warriors or mages (unless magues highroll 4 giants by turn 5). Mech hunter is hard for the deck, yeah. Rogue depends if they dont get their sap soon and have to kill your big taunt minions trough damage, so then you can ressumon them with kangor.
---
I dont run the secret package though, i think its really bad. I go full out in mechs and some handbuff synergies for early explosiveness. Getting some 5/20 taun divine shields by turn 5 is pretty common.
---
coin mountain giant is a big move

---
It'd be nice if those rules were explained by the cards, even if it was hidden text until you hover over them.
---
Tempo rogue, actually
---
True, but in principle I still think mad genius needs a nerf. We should have left hero cards on that power level in wild.
---
Nice. Good burn. You're a real winner.
---
Except most decks currently run weapon removal. Sword of justice is such a large tempo loss to play in the first place, having it removed is that much more of a tempo loss.
---
lol @ Warrior being mad at anything. It's autopilot my dude, l2p.
---
Also if it makes you feel better, Druids are ass at higher ranks.
---
I already told you why
---
I'm super excited for the solo content, I can't wait! I loved dungeon run and the witchwood. I have gold saved for it, but I wouldn't mind spend 20 bucks on it, without an rewards. I think the lackluster reward system is there to give players like me something along the new game mode, and to make players like you not feel like you need to purchase it.
---
Wow! Almost a dead on replica. Nice job!
---
Probably anybody not past rank 5 I'd imagine. It also seems those million token druids are concentrated at lower ranks too, as druid is tied for 7th in terms of my opponents over 250 games.
---
Paladins are very common at the moment and run this card too. Not to mention Hunters generally buff other mechs as well with it.
---
All in all, this post simply misses the mark of being funny as does nearly every "honest cards" these days. I miss the time when they were actually subtle and actually funny.
---
Mage op pls nerf
---
Rogue needs some kind of nerf. Anybody who plays seriously at higher ranks either believes that or plays the deck and doesn't want it nerfed.
---
Or a mass ressurection
---
Yep, 14
---
I am in your boat sir. People just dont want to acknowledge paladin as a class
---
watch out, Toast will tweet about this hate thread as well.
---
If they're going to use a keyword a reasonable amount in an expansion, then of course they should use the existing keyword, that'd be absurd.
---
In the case of your last example, if it was the only card in an expansion to do so, yeah, I'd rather they write out the effect than use the keyword, just as they did with Witch's Brew. It's better game design, in my opinion.
---
Do you even know the English vocabulary? Casual means that they don't put their rank at risk, and people are free to do whatever the fuck they like. lmao I cannot believe you're thinking like this.
---
Isn't that true of most 1v1 competitive games?
---
1st of the month starts and ends a season. Chest depends on rank. But at least a new card back style.
---
No.... it typically takes a few weeks.
---
How lol
---
No packs yet. They should be here by the end of the week.
---
Idk where exactly the event was in Taiwan but when I was in Taiwan (2015)I was able to use my phone with the T-Mobile plan and I didn't have to pay extra. I had my data available as normal along with making a hotspot.
---
Oh I'm sure, but still not unreasonable to expect.
---
Season resets every month. The chest gives you rewards based on your rank and a card back for the season you participated in. Nothing special.
---
Does anyone else find it really cheesey when people post this kind of stuff? Like, is it that interesting that people are nice out there? Should we post every single time you have a nice encounter? Isn't that just sad? Or is it just easy Karma.
---
You'll find a post about it on the frontpage when they hit
---
For me he was the first golden Legendary ever
---
Well, i hope he reads my descriptive comment then or watches the video.

More like 5 Mana 5/7 Charge; Deathrattle: Deal two damage to enemy hero.

Jup. Besides Taunts and throwing all against the Edwin, Token Druid has nothing they can do about a 12/12 Edwin.
---
Yeah, who knows. OP could have been talking about a catholic priest, or the city of Baku, or even being the third turn of a car race-.
---
Context is obviously out of the question here.
---
thank you! I am a brand new player (2 weeks into the game) and got lost on what I should do. This comment helps. I really enjoy building my own deck and see its synergy works at the low level play. at what point you would suggest I start building a meta deck?
---
Assuming your deck has exactly 4, 1 in 30!/26!
---
Has there ever been a meta that Leroy didn't have a place in?
---
Panik#1520 NA 80g trade, you go first Ill show.
---
oh swell, I guess we've solved the Mystery of the Missing Hearthstone Emote. thanks heaps
---
You could cut the boom scheme and a banker for sweeping strikes and a scrap hound. That will gain you more armor/health than boom scheme ever will and is a lot more versatile.
---
is there someone on thwitch I can go watch that plays a lot of rogue ? I want to get better st playing lacky rogue
---
I mean there is always a decent amount of luck involved and i think his rating scale was also more on the extreme end.  
---
This comparison is obviously not perfect.
---
I'm very new to Hearthstone, so please bare with me. Does this mean you're number one in the world as of right now?
---
- I screenshotted your deck, hopefully I'll get there eventually... 😋
---
Goodjob man!
---
Ragnaros was mine. Still salty that they rotated him out.
---
Assuming you didn't have any more left in the deck: about 0.00365% or 1 in 27405.
---
as far as aggressive decks go, at least tempo rogue is different than the others (put small stuff go face repeat) but yes the ladder is devolved basically into those 2 decks and miscellaneous midrange deck that high rolls against warrior but loses to sap. 
---
&gt;game is now hugely reliant on drawing the right card(s) for that particular match up
---
this is why every single tutor card (unless I'm forgetting one) has been played in some competitive deck at some point of time: card draw is so expensive (mana, card space, takes up entire turn, etc.) in HS that most decks can't afford to spend an entire turn doing it so when you get cards like the mech bear, arcanologist, mad scientist, etc. they see heavy play because they mitigate the randomness of drawing.
---
Then what should they do? if it hits too soon it get overshadowed by the expansion. Actually I think it would be great if we get single player mode BEFORE the expansion with mode exclusive cards but it would be a mess to make it synergistic with the cards that would be released later
---
Misha ate it
---
Valar morghulis
---
Usually it's 1 nerf per expansion, the last expansion had 2.
---
I expect that classic and basic cards in tempo rogue, bomb/control warrior and token druid will be hit.
---
Elisyana (the legendary deck refiller) might also get hit, so might Barnes or another wild big priest card
---
I also expect a nerf to an essential basic or classic card for priest or warlock
---
20 games played 8 as Rag 12 as Nef. 100% winrate for rag, 0% winrate for nef. And i really tried each time.
---
meanwhile a player finds me on twitch by the same username and DMs me calling my deck truly and utterly idiotic and that I'm lucky his deck was the worst matchup for it.
---
Same, getting an announcement for when it's coming in another week is getting ridiculous. We're looking at a month or longer after the release of the expansion.
---
Legend!
---
Did you have to post it here then?
---
I hate that I got Jaraxxus golden instead of a really garbage one. It's not great right now, but it's potential makes me not want to dust it.
---
Announcement of an announcement
---
I find odd how they never stick with well received schedules.
---
Just go leeroy infinite on warriors, firebat style
---
It does create an awkward situation for those of us who want certain cards from the new set, but aren't sure yet what we might open.
---
Ohhhhhhhh so you are a warrior player, warrior is pretty unbalanced tbh. No class should be able to shuffle thousands of cards that deal damage when drawn in your opponents deck then summon a 7/7 and 6 boom bots for 7 mana
---
That could have been a reason too, but that is just speculation. We don't know for sure if releasing dungeon run a month after K&amp;C's release would have really increased revenue for blizzard.
---
Most consistent combo since knife juggler - swashburglar - 30 shadowsteps
