Trading 80g quest on Asia, I'll show/you challenge first

This deck already exists in standard and it has been tested by me to hit legend. This secret deck has not been discovered by ladder players yet but I’m willing to share with you the deck list! 
---
The deck list is:
---
Silverback patriarch x2
---
Master’s call x2
---
Dire frenzy x2
---
Good luck and have fun hitting legend !
---
Thank you :D now i can finally get it out of my head
---
Last one we got was 5/5/5 [[Elise the Trailblazer]]
---
&gt; I wish it was a lower mana cost so it was easier to use.
---
I have a feeling it probably was at some point during playtesting, and was absolutely broken as a result.
---
&gt;The weird 3 hour period where we waited for the rope and then the lethal puzzle just drew the event out longer than it felt like it should have been,
---
This actually wasn’t supposed to be part of the puzzle. The puzzle was supposed to START when the “rope ended” this beginning our turn. The lack of communication was the problem, since we assumed the puzzle was supposed to start 3 hours before it actually did

Fun fact conceal doesn't work with obelisks. The obelisks "deal damage" which breaks their stealth. I built a deck once that tried to abuse ragnaros shots in stealth.... It didn't work how I had hoped.
---
&gt;Win rate is a testament to skill floor not skill cap
---
That's basically what I'm saying?  95% of people couldn't play grim patron well, because it's hard to play well.  The floor on that deck is actually pretty bad, yet it was still considered the best deck in the game and literally warped the meta.
---
it's really bad, but it's not boring
---
Being made of paper I don't think it could work as a toy for more than five seconds.
---
I might be too scared to pull a doomsayer. That fucker has traumatized me too many times about summoning 2 drops.
---
If it works like the other cards with the "if you control X amount of X" wording then it should trigger when you have more than 3 Obelisks
---
And the award "Worst card in the expansion" goes to...
---
vargoth isn't important to the list but he isn't bad either so it's up to your preference. if you have sn1p-sn4p i'd probably run it instead.
---
Hi there. You appear to have been shadowbanned for some reason. Being shadowbanned means other users can't read your comments unless manually approved by a moderator, which is a bit of a hassle for us, and a hassle for you if no moderator is online to approve it for you.

Please contact the reddit admins by modmailing /r/reddit.com ([click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&amp;subject=&amp;message=)) to resolve this matter.

Fun fact: if you see a lot of any character in `abefghnqruvy`there's also a really good chance you should apply rot13 if you expect your output to be in english.

no, you need to concede 10 games in a row to restore balance to the universe
---
Yeah. Though I don't think Blizz wants a lot of strong otk decks in the meta after complaints about those in the past. This combo seems pretty memey, but I like the design of it. It's a unique mechanic, and just the fact that it inspires so many people to ask HOW DO I MAKE THIS WORK shows that it creates an interesting challenge for players, even if it ends up sucking.

MINECRAFT

It would be smarter to first know what you want to craft and then disenchant as much as you need dust for it. If you want to be f2p the best way is to start saving ALL the gold from the beginning of the next expansion, 39k dust should be enough to survive it - its about 2-4 meta decks. If you will be doing all the quest when yet another expansion comes you should have enough gold for about 80 packs. Buy it on the first day of expansion and start saving again.
---
The base concept isn't quite bad, but you'd need to rethink basically everything else around it to reach a reasonable proposal. It can't give *unlimited* free Arena runs, even for a short duration, because that would amount to near-infinite value (even at $100 for a week, if you have enough time to click it all, it'd still easily net you a lot more packs than any of their pre-oder bundles).
---
It *could* give a reduced gold price on Arena entries for a certain period, or a fixed amount of free runs for a price, or a boost in rewards, but either of these ideas would need to be carefully balanced. Either of those options would essentially amount to more or less directly buying gold for real money.
---
In any case, this would change very little for top Arena players (they consistently make a net profit out of the game mode already), and it would essentially be a real-money Arena ticket bundle for players with average or below average results (not the most exciting thing; especially since it already baffles me that you can even buy an Arena entry with real money at all, let alone that it costs like 3 bucks).
---
I think this subreddit is just in an overly-critical mood lately.
---
Correct
---
Each one deals 5.
---
It's a joke since it's never been possible before. Lighten up.
---
is this card trash? yes
---
will i do everything in my power to attempt to break it and make an incredibly stupid combo deck? also yes
---
"If you control 3 of these"
---
Does that mean equal to 3 OR greater than or equal to? lol
---
What do you mean? Rouge has been a class since the game was created?
---
Your comment made it sound like it’s 15 damage that isn’t random, so I said it’s random damage.
---
Also, when you compare cards, you kind of have to compare everything about them, not just one part of them. That’s just not how it works.
---
The problem is all the different meme builds I would like to try to make this card work will cost just as much as a top tier meta deck. 
---
Experimenting with bad cards, especially decks built around gimmick epics and legendaries, is just too expensive. 
---
If this were Magic or something it would hardly cost anything since prices are based around power level. But in HS the best and worst legendary cost the same.
---
from a competitive point of view this is bad.
---
from a meme  / fun point of view this is a challenge to get working for some sort of OTK.

3/4/2 Beast | At the end of your turn, deal 1 damage to all other minions.  
---
rag, innervate, drakkari, break twig, faceless, faceless.
---
Can do this right now, and it is 48 (+1 including twig) damage plus the 8/8's are bigger than 0/5's.
---
With one tick of Thaurissan you can do Hero Power, Kobold Totem Dude x2 and then Windshear Stormcaller for 2 Al'Akirs
---
Wait that takes like 9 board spots.
---
This card is bad.
---
No offense, but you should’ve known better that Reddit was going to get an amazing card. It was 100 percent going to be a meme card. The last one we got was Shifter Zerus.
---
If this were 1 mana lower this would be used in wild. It would be fucking chaos lower than that. It's bad because it has to be.

---
So did you still win? Or did he find healing?
---
Right. But the point is he probably wasn't trying to off himself.
---
Yep, the need to be able to clear 2 obelisks to have 0 more triggers (and leave you with the opportunity to make more). They can also kill the drakkari to pump it down to 20 damage in the next turn. I can't imagine this is good, but it warrants some attention at least. Deathrattles (sn1p-snap) and reborn minions destroy this combo though. You spend you're entire 20 mana developing it, and you get to do 1 damage to interact with the board from the weapon swing.

---
Obelisk Druid T1 deck.
---
your point?
---
I don't think this will be played in Wild. Warlock doesn't lack removal options, and this interferes with your Voidcallers and Gul'Dan boards.
---
Lower skill level ranks have more players behaving like children who dont know how to either lose or win with dignity. Whodathunk.
---
The best move would’ve been to just use your hero power on yourself
---
Not sure what kind of warlock deck this would fit into, but the card itself is 5 stars.
---
Implying similarly worded cards behave consistently.
---
Jokes aside, i would also expect the same.
---
I seem to recall similar vibes running up to the last few expansions as well. There does seem to be a fairly well represented crowd of the “terrible expansion predicted from ~20 cards” and “cards that I can’t currently be competitive with suck” crowd, but that seems to be a cyclic nature of the vocal community this game tends to attract.
---
I have high hopes that there will be new and interesting interactions, and I look forward to new decks popping up.
---

In a vacuum this card is absolutely incredible.  It guarantees killing your opponents best creature and lays down a huge body.  That is a might tempo swing at almost any stage of the game.  On curve killing your opponent's 5 or 6 drop and leaving this behind is quite impressive, and possibly game-winning.  However, as of now Warlock doesn't have good minions in the 3/4/5 slot for a midrange deck, and not not enough healing to support a control deck.  If it gets anything good (particularly the latter) this card will almost assuredly be a 2-of.  5 star card in a vacuum, perhaps only 3 if Warlock doesn't get support.
---
Emoting is fine. Emote spamming typically means you are, at best, a child.
---
Big priests emoting wow for every overcompensating minion they summon, for example, is a pretty good indication they are stroking themselves while playing the game, and that's just plain disgusting.
---
I've only ever seen 2 mechs generated with the delivery drone, and it's Omega Devastator and Boom Reaver.

Very good card that i'd argue is better then [[Siphon Soul]] as for 6 mana they both kill minions, but this leaves a 7/5 body on board, though you do take a hefty loss in health, and if I had to guess the average health you'll end up losing playing this card will probably be 5 or 6.

If you're playing zoo, surely you'd just play demonbolt right?

That's a human.

I know this sounds pedantic, but in this case it’s really not the same thing. I think this is a good card, but a 4 mana 7/5 that gives you an option to play obliterate later or not at all would be nuts for a lot of reasons. In this case, the whole is definitely different from the sum of the parts.
---
That’s so RNG based though. Getting Tundra Rhino to be the one that goes to 0 mana.

Too unreliable
---
Hasn't he stopped playing Hearthstone?
---
OTK unless your enemy is a warrior, floods the board, has a few divine shield minions, or kills you before you even get to the combo.
---
so 75% of all meta decks maybe even more, because your combo is wild only
---
You know this card in like a big priest style deck would be super fun. Probably a 0.005 win rate.
---
Worst card of the expansion so far?
---
I got so ungodly salty when someone killed my Loatheb with their 5-cost Forbidden Words while they were at 5 mana. Guess sometimes you can just spend mana you don't have.
---
So I play Barnes, summon a copy of Desert Obelisk from my deck, bring it back...
---
Urgh it was in there, but I think a later edit erased it when I was adding the art since it had the previous version "cached" (I'm editing on two devices). Thanks.
---
It might be too slow for most Evenlock builds. But the last Evenlock I played had the 2 mana 4/3 demons so maybe slower lists might play it.
---
If you were going to run siphon soul, you run this instead 100% temp and removal is better than healing and removal 99% of the time.
---
I’m told 9am is correct.
---
That's unclear, but I took another look at [Star Aligner](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/File:Star_Aligner(89842).png) and it doesn't say "exactly" but only works with minions which have *exactly* 7 health, whether they started with 7 health or got buffed or damaged.
---
Based on that, I don't think it's implausible to assume that this card only works if you have exactly 3.
---
I think this will def see play. You won't be paying 15 mana, it will be in some kind of combo,.Control board, Fill board, end turn and win.
---
This looks like an Arena card. Though it lets you punish Warlock even more by slamming face in Arena.
---
I feel like if Warlock had a singleton thing going on this expansion this would be in the deck. And who knows if we end up getting a super control fatigue Warlock this expansion we might see this thing. But I can't really see this fitting nicely into any of the current Warlock decks. If Warlock gets some healing this will be actually good all the time. You can play this and Nethersoul Buster on the same turn to kill a Mountain Giant and play a 9/5. Which is cool.
---
am I missing something? you didn't even use his hero power
---
Why do I see mecha'thun warlock
---
In arena, for sure. I guess it is less restrictive but Inwould rank them pretty much equal in constructed.

Battlecry (destroy?) a friendly lackey and summon a 5/5 demon? I haven’t studied German in, like, 7 years, but that might be it.
---
Battlecry: Destroy a friendly lackey to summon a 5/5 demon
---
It's correct
---
Sea Giant?
---
Rabble Bouncer?
---
In most cases it's far better than Big Bad Voodoo, which is already an okay-good card in decks like Big Shaman
---
And the point is it's unfun to play against BECAUSE of how easily the current Mage package can drop Giants....
---
Thanks ♥
---
This is correct
---
yes exactly that. destroy a lacky to summon a 5/5 demon
---
Steel rager isn't bad either. Wtf is this post?
---
One day, Crystology will go away but sense demons will always be there.
---
Destroy a friendly lackey and get 8/8 stats for 3 mana. Ehhhhh busted much?
---
That's pretty nuts if Warlock gets another good lackey generating card.
---
That's broken as hell lol. Good for Warlock though as they needed some cards like this.
---
For four mana you can summon a 3/3 a 5/5 and get the benefit of a lackey.
---
Nice edit on the name of the ANCIENT ONE!
---
Shaman and Druid drop giants more easily and if a mage drops giant on 4 you should already have board control since he’s been pinging
---
3 Mana 8/8 Meta
---
i love this card design since its pretty balanced and the art is absolute fire
---
Yeah, seems pretty good
---
Reading german cards as a german makes me glad i play the game in english.
---
But not everyone is trying to grind ladder. Some people *only* play for fringe fun interactions.
---
Battlecry: kill a friendly lackey to summon a 5/5 Demon. and the Card will Probably be called E.V.I.L Summoner
---
Broken as fcuk already
---
Even if they don't, it might make zoo run cable rat just for the consistency
---
This is instantly one of the best cards in the game, if not the very best. Move over Flamewreathed Faceless, as we now have our first four mana 8/8.
---
How about make Mountain Giant cost something like 8 and have the text costs (4) more or something.
---
Or even change Horror to 11 cost(or 13 costs (1) less), idk these seem like the only ways to practically change Giant or Horror to make CC worse but still good.
---
You seem to be having some serious reading comprehension problems. It's okay, you don't have to comment on everything.
---
Pretty good. Only problem is that I can't think of anyway to reliably get a lackey out on turn 2, so can't see this card being played turn 3
---
Warlock and Priest will get one if I remember correctly, Rogue won't becaus that class already is busted enough.
---
One of two things must he true:   
---
1) the wording on forbidden cards is wrong  
---
2) this is a bug
---
Ehhhhhh s'busted
---
Getting way ahead of yourself there.
---
This requires set up, you need to spend Mana in previous turns to get a Lackey in hand, which means you need that Lackey generator in hand as well.
---
Not only that, but there are still quite a few cards that are better than this.
---
Holy Brode, this is busted. Considering how warlock struggles right now, I like this card.
---
Would be more balance with +2/+2 for an additional 2 mana actually ..
---
Zoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
I wasn't expecting a German reveal to *not* have the English card so I didn't stand by for this. Will edit with the English card as soon as I have it.
---
Pretty sure you wouldn't take 60 damage unfortunately but at least Brann would set it to a 61/5
---
Me too. You play fun and interactive 46/46 pogos? You get countered by fun and interactive freeze. Perfectly balanced
---
Here's the sales pitch: A demon is what you lackey.
---
Adding you memedesimo
---
Oh no... Poor you, I can feel the pain from here...
---
You will die cause of 35 damage
---
Nice
---
OSHate#2219  
---
80g trade EU
---
If you have two drakkari enchanters, do they add an extra instance of end of turn effects?
---
e.g. 3 obelisks with 2 drakkari for 45 damage
---
He’s saying the card is too slow in fast metas. So it’s not about the card killing you, it’s about them killing you before the card gets dropped. And even if you find time to play it, the best target will be a 2/3 murloc.
---
Random enemy. That whisp will definitely get otk.
---
Warlock doesn't have enough healing tools so I wonder if this card will see play. Seems like too much of a down side.
---
49 damage
---
Sick tempo obliterate
---
More like lets hope it does. Warlock has been in a bad spot for a while and needs a boost. Even if its an aggro one. Besides, if many decks can deal with mages T4-6 giants then this wont be that much of a problem either.
---
&gt;**reliably** get a lackey out on turn 2
---
But can you feel the rage of ten thousand years?
---
In a way this is like giant on turn 3 lol
---
Move over 4 Mana 7/7 Here comes 3 Mana 8/8
---
Are you saying this would become a 4 mana 7/7. That seems pretty weak. They should buff it with some overload.
---
This seems super power. It's a weird draw 3 for 3, and while the randomness could make it worse most Hunter cards are pretty good so you'll be happy with what you get most of the time
---
This card is insane. A random hunter secret is okay at worst to insane at best, a random weapon has very good odds to get what you want with so few of them, and the real variance is on the random beast. I will be day 1 crafting this in golden. 3 golden cards the price of 1.
---
Ok but it does seem like a very Hunter card.
---
[deleted]
---
fool, you fell for one of the classic blunders
---
I like it. It's similar to soul siphon but you lose health instead of gaining it and you get a 7/5 all in one. I'd say that's pretty good value.
---
oof
---
I'll hate it when it's used against me at least twice a game
---
Depends...
---
Right now, yes. But if there's powerful enough non-Beast cards for Hunter to use, this may become more useful for them..
---
Especially since those non-beast minions have a good chance of being generated by this....
---
But right now, in this current meta, and the theorycrafts we can make of the Uldum expansion so far, it's not as powerful as Master's call, not close.
---
Master's Call is efficient enough to make Hunters cut 2 Houndmasters and Houndmaster Shaw for it....
---
Is it possible for him to get the basic totems from this? I’ve never seen it happen in all my runs.
---
It's a screen overlay with a decktracker.  That number shows the pogohopper buff value, although I think the sharks have thrown it off
---
Decent but also overrated.  You want to be drawing cards from your deck, not adding random filler to your hand, and this is already contested by 
---
* Animal Companion
---
* Deadly Shot
---
* Eaglehorn Bow
---
* Kill Command
---
* Master's Call
---
* Nine Lives (sometimes played)
---
* Spider Bomb
---
* Unleash the Hounds
---
* Ursatron
---
* SN1P-SN4P
---
Actually some tier lists dropped it to t2, but it's still a hell of a deck.
---
2 secrets, 2 weapons and 2 beasts (because of zul'jin) for 3 mana. God damn that's value.
---
4 mana 7/7 was too weak.
---
no
---
One could even use [[the White Lady]]- what am I saying, no one has ever played that card.
---
twice =/= trigger once more
---
mecharoo / murmy -&gt; evil genius -&gt; coin lackey + this is now easily the best curve in the game, ridiculously strong card
---
I don't think that Blizzard goes into cards going "yes, let's have this do x, but have it be a bad card that's never played". We're talking about design philosophy here - if they consistently didn't want card generation for Hunter, the class cards would've looked very different.
---
A 9 card combo is historically really poor unfortunately : (
---
It's something from HSdecktracker program. The next pogo the opponent will play will be a 35/35. (The pogo's on the board are higher because of shark, but the tracker of the pogo's is currently 35/35).
---
Not to mention this can generate Dire Frenzy, Gladiator's Longbow, defensive Secrets etc, which make this even further better in fatigue than Master's call
---
And RNGing this from Thief Rogue would be so nice!
---
German is a funny language
---
Card looks awesome. I keep getting excited for CTRL Hunter, unfortunately the hero power does not support this. May see play in a spell focused deck?
---
YES
---
Sure but control decks care a lot less about tempo than other archetypes and this minion works against a control deck in ways that Siphon Soul does not. First why should a control Warlock care about gaining board advantage on turn 6 when they are most likely going to kill the entire board on turn 7 or turn 8? Secondly this card is actively bad in control v control matchups since control decks tend to run big minions which means taking a lot of damage. Control decks care a lot about their life total in control v control matchups since it figures into who dies from fatigue first.
---
According to their article, a limitation is an aspect that might show up in a class, but are limited in both power level and number of cards.
---
This, Master’s Call, shimmerfly, marked shot, and arguably Zul’jin- I think all of these are pretty good cards, and at what point is the number of cards no longer limited? 5 playable cards in one class on a theme is a pretty big number for Hearthstone.
---
I think there have been plenty of interesting/fun looking cards in this expansion. People are giving it a hard time because of the league.
---
Value Zuljin Hunter, bois! New meta!
---
Objectively better than double muck morph into two slightly better Al'Akirs
---
I remember deathstalker rexxar
---
It's secretly bad with Zuljin, you want a nice empty hand to Master's Call up your Dire Frenzy beasts.  You already finish the Zuljin turn with a full hand almost every time.  But in a non-Master's Call deck, like Mechrattle Hunter, this could be good.
---
From the Class Identity blog post:  
---
"Here’s a brief look into how we currently picture each of the classes:  
---
 Strengths: These are the things that a class focuses on and excels at.  
---
 Limitations: These are aspects that might show up a few times in a class, but they are very limited in power level and the number of cards.  
---
 Weaknesses: These are aspects that a class either doesn’t have or struggles to achieve effectively."  
---
"Hunter: Hunters use their wit, ferocity, and an army of beasts fighting alongside them to destroy their competition. Although they lack in defense, their aggression allows them to push through before they need it. A well-timed Secret or Deathrattle can help them gain clutch advantages against their opponent.  
---
 Strengths: Beasts, face damage, Secrets, Deathrattle  
---
 Limitations: Card draw and generation, board clear, Taunt  
---
 Weaknesses: Healing"  
---
Priest and Warrior similarly list card draw as a limitation.
---
Poor Lakaien :(
---
This is nutty in Renolock
---
Anything with Mechs is good (mostly Paladin and Hunter). Tokens in Druid, control in Shaman is very fun but they also have Murloc stuff, Control or Midrange Warriors exist, Spells/Conjurer Mages, Spirit of the Shark shenanigans is the best you can do in Rogue rn. There’s also some Beast Hunter synergies with spells and Zuljin, Zoo or Plot Twist for Warlock (Zoo is like Tier 3 but I find it very fun and successesfull in the current meta). Priest is pretty garbage unfortunately as it’s my favorite class, but I’ve still been trying a lot of stuff, from Zoo Priest with Bomswandi, “Big” Priest with Ressurect stuff, Mech Priest with Spirit + Inner Fire, etc.
---
Crystology is definitely better IMO
---
If there was a combo Hunter, Tracking still occasionally would have a downside by removing a combo piece..
---
Crystology lets you draw your draw to draw more draw to draw and draw and draw and fatigue turn 10....
---
No, but really, it's mulligan winrate is bonkers for both Mech and OTK Pally, better AI a lot of the time in both decks for 1 mana. If not, at least very close to AI
---
Youre not weighing health enough, it s only still +2 in value like vilespine not thaaaaat bad
---
In a class that isn't doing great at the moment.
---
Secret hunter will definitely play this, an extra random spell can make things more difficult for your opponent to play around and the deck is perfectly happy playing it a little slow in the mid-game.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
Images you can hear
---
Despite ppl saying it might see play i think this card will be trash and will see few to no play at all.
---
If i had to give it stars it would be 0.5 stars
---
I hate both these decks so much I don’t know how to feel
---
As soemone who has run longbow in midrange hunter when i am missing a legendary its surprising useful. Not good enough to always run, but sometimes 10 damage to face over 2 turn is worth 7, sometimes 7 mana is worth to kill that taunt in the way. And being immune means lifestealers don't heal from it. You are right, its far from a dud.
---
You don't have to have those cards in your deck, though. Master's Call only works in a specific type of Hunter deck - that's what calling a card conditional typically means. This is just a pseudo-draw 3 that works equally well in any Hunter deck.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And while you describe the fact that it generates specific types of cards as a limitation, I would argue that factor makes the card considerably stronger. Since those card pools are relatively small, the effect is a lot more predictable than typical random card generation. If you need a specific card - say, Explosive Trap, or Tundra Rhino, or Eaglehorn Bow - to stay alive, you can play this for a small but significant chance of getting it. Especially when you consider that there will often be multiple cards that can save you (e.g., Explosive Trap, Freezing Trap, and Misdirection can all potentially save you from being dead to the board; any weapon you can afford will do if you just need to be able to clear a small minion like Khadgar; etc.).
---
You play zoo too? Or Tokens?
---
I put Longbow in my Spell Hunter deck instead of Rhok'Delar a while back, Rhok was better but Longbow wasn't even that bad tbh.
---
AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA
---
I will like using it 4 times in a game thanks to zul
---
Part of the problem with the quest approach is that combo decks often want to cycle their deck quickly to get to their win condition before their opponent. Also, there aren't a lot of 5-attack minions that the combo Druid shell naturally runs, so you're replacing a lot of cards to make the quest work and hoping that you draw your deck in the right order.
---
Too op, but using blizzard's logic, might be printed.
---
At first I thought it said "Add a random Hunter, Beast..." I was like wow, we're just adding entire classes to our hand now
---
This is amazing. Hunter's biggest issue is card draw/generation. This solves that issue nicely. I predict this will be included in most hunter decks.
---
One of warriors listed strengths was taunt, but they currently have no taunt minions hmmm
---
I wouldn't really say that the similarities are striking... It has a completely different effect.
---
I've seen some custom HS cards that are much closer to this, but it's nothing new. Hundreds of new cards are added every month so some will obviously be similar to the official ones.
---
To play devil's advocate, this card was very likely already fully designed before that post was made. Blizzard is like a year ahead in terms of what expansions they are working on so prepare to make this joke for the next couple of expansions.
---
BEHOLD!
---
So its not just any random card, its a card that Blizzard specifically responded to.
---
Link to each one of them pls

7/3/8 | Can't attack. Whenever this minion takes damage, deal 3 damage to a random enemy.  
---
&gt; Well you can just chose not to play it against combo decks ? 
---
No. You would play it in combo decks in order gather the combo together faster. If that combo requires multiple non-legendary cards, they'd just wait until they've drawn one of them.
---
&gt; there aren't a lot of mill in standard. 
---
I'd rather not give them more tools if it can be prevented. If Mage is ever able to duplicate Research Project or receives more effects of that ilk, then a Mill Mage won't be far off if they also gain access to a card that reads "burn half of your opponent's deck"
---
&gt; Standard desperately needs support for highlander. 
---
There's only one deck, *one deck,* that really could turn off the singleton rewards. While Bomb Warrior still looks it'll still be strong in the coming format, one bad match-up is rarely enough to keep a deck from being viable on ladder. Right now Bomb and Control Warrior lose badly to Mech Paladin. Depending on who you ask, those match-ups are about three to one in favor of Mech Paladin.
---
Plus, there's still a neutral reward that has as of yet to be seen.
---
Hunter doesn't have many bad spells.
---
Art is totally awesome!

Is this effect really worth being an epic?

I mean....starving buzzard is a card you can get from this.... Thats why i said thats where the real variance in power comes from. Some times you get Highmanes, king crush. Sometimes you get buzzard....

It would be painful to kill a Ysera with this.
---
I have played almost exclusively control since beta and one of the most important things is, a body that has no effect isn't helping anything.
---
When you talk big bodies in control, you want Lich King, Ragnaros, Voidlord etc. You want a scary big dude on the board. This guy is a 7/5 which means he will most likely trade down, meaning he'll die to a cheaper spell or minion. In control you want value so you want your minions to trade up or at least protect your face while you set up a board clear.
---
Talking about tempo, yes tempo is very important but control decks also most of the time have a niche win condition that they're waiting for while they control the board. In warlock that might be dropping Jaraxxus, giants or maybe a doomguard combo. So one 7/5 minion isn't gonna contribute anything towards your win condition and as I said, it'll most likely trade down anyway because single target clears aren't that effective.
---
Soul Siphon is good as a single target clear because you can use it on something like the Lich King without taking 8 damage and you even heal yourself which makes it tons better against control matchups and even better against aggro because you can't afford to hit yourself for too much vs aggro.
---

Swift nerf. Unless Hunter is meant to be top teir still
---
Strong card that enable new warrior archetype (tempo/aggro). I'm all for it !
---
That artwork!
---
Doesn't need too, but he usually kills something and gets hurt when he's played, so being able to copy a second one can still be pretty nice.
---
[[Grommash Hellscream]] nonsense is probably the most obvious but it might be better in a mid-range rush deck than in big warrior.

Anyway, this is strong enough that it will see play at some point.

---
Or anything fun lmao
---
Brings back memories of “You face the might of Taldaram, Mortal!”
---
Making Tyrande available again.
---
"Limitation". I'm the first one to say the class identity items are generally awful, but nothing in that criteria suggests Hunter should never have access to card generation, just that their access is limited, conditioned, short-scoped, scarce. Ironically enough though, this card is the "freest" of the bunch.
---
Ayyy Warrior with damaged minion synergy. 
---
Cross that off the old hearthstone bingo
---
Good job with this post. People will search this is google and hopefully they stumble upon your post.
---
Still extra value with Spirit of the Rhino
---
More like Dozing Marksman + Inner Rage on curve into opponent killing it with Frostbolt and you getting 2 for 1'd :)
---
Single target [[Sudden Genesis]] on a stick.  Definitely seems playable, especially with reborn minions as they are "damaged" when they wake up.
---
Flavor fail. Everyone knows packs have 5 cards not 3.

---
It's cool to see damaged minion support, especially one as seemingly strong as this, but I am hesitant to call it  amazing. If it does see play, it should see play primarily in Tempo Warrior decks.
---
Pretty sure he says ”Tremble before Taldaram, Mortal”
---
If only we still had the Garrosh DK. 
---
Really, the only one that never saw any play, but would’ve been great in a self damage deck.
---
&gt;Unless you're talking about fatigue, but how often do your Hunter games go into fatigue
---
Every single time that you play Zul'Jin with Masters' Call and Tracking in your deck. That's my point. 
---
Right now, if Zul'Jin doesn't close the game for you, it forces you into such a fatigue level that it closes the game for your opponent. Currently, the meta cannot realistically answer your hordes of 5/5 Rush, so you don't care, but if the meta shifts to a more controlled pace, you will most likely have to drop either of those cards (I'd argue it's probably Masters' Call because Tracking is just stupidly good).

5/-/- | Summon copies of your damaged minions.  
---
It does depend on the situation, but if you want to go reductionist silverback patriarch could be better than both of these cards depending on the situation. Generally, hunter doesn’t have problems running out of value due to a max of 10x 5/5 with rush and 12 dire frenzy beasts (that’s why it matches up well vs control warrior). This definitely seems like a fun card though.
---
Whip warrior is a great tier 2 off-meta deck.
---
This appears quite strong.  Gladly, it appears to move away from Control Warrior though.
---
Can't wait to use this to summon a second Grom
---
Haha, I was just digging to find my old post when I saw this! Discover instead of random for the premium of 2 mana, but besides that, it is exactly the same.
---
the hell are they trying to do with warrior
---
I love it
---
copied from previous thread:
---
It's cool to see stories like this!  Reminds me of the old Finley story that appeared in custom hearthstone that eventually became a thing in Ungoro.
---
Probably my favorite of the expansion to be honest. Compared to New Reno she should be Legendary.

turn 10 armagedillo+inner rage+thia card seems good

Well at one point Hunter had the best card draw engine in the game with Buzzard. They've been woefully inconsistent in the "limitations" of the hunter class...
---
Um, [[Silverback Patriarch]]. Checkmate, atheists.
---
I'm inclined to think you played the 2nd twinspell or your hand was full.

Anything is good with support. Doesn't make it inherently good. If they printed a card that said "if you control nat pagel at the end of your turn, destroy the opponents hero", nat pagel would be "good"

---
3/1/4 Beast | Taunt  
---
That doesn't say much.
---
It's because if it was too good it would take over the meta with various obtuse "copy" decks and have a boring af win condition.
---
I wouldn't necessarily want decks like face hunter or pirate warrior to become popular again, but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't miss the days of counter queuing them. since they climbed so much faster than other decks, they were everywhere. building a gatekeeper deck to stop face race players from ranking up is one of my favorite hearthstone memories. I'd hit the rank floor at 10 and concede to every non aggro player since my deck had no chance of beating them anyways. my only job was to hold the door against face hunter.
---
Compare subreddit and twitch numbers to other card games.
---
The new warrior legendary has both taunt and buffs taunts?
---
Mountain Giant Hunter confirmed OP
---
yeah it's probably like this
---
Ironic.
---
Same guy that did Lady Ashmore and archivist I think.
---
How so? How could they prove damages or loss of income when these custom card designers are doing it and posting it for free?
---
I'll play this when I randomly get it from my Rogue burgle cards
---
To be honest I think everyone agrees that pre-nerf Charge should absolutely not exist anymore.
---
Only situationally good. Against agro 7 health on Mal daddy is quite poor especially since you likely don't have other demons early.
---
Yeah his/her version is definitely weaker although their different, that version will actually effect the game the turn it’s played (more health, weapon to attack with) and there’s some merit to that where as blizzards version is really just a refill. 
---
His/her version could be situationally more powerful.
---
Damn, card truly is too broken
---
Remember when Team 5 tried to make balanced cards?
---
I got legend a couple of times using rush warrior w/ Garrosh. It was absolutely gamewinning against odd pala
---
Great, more cards that just feel shit to lose to.
---
I think Elise will be at her best in some sort of old school style malygos moonfire Druid, drawing most of your deck till you no longer have duplicates and then using Elise to get extra moonfires or floop or whatever for the combo kill, might auto lose to bomb warrior, but could potentially do well against the rest of the meta
---
Let's see which one is more likely
---
A. Blizzard did this convoluted shadow nerf to a tier 2 deck and nobody noticed it for 2 weeks except you.
---
B. You are mistaken.
---
If it’s becoming a 9/9, let’s make it a Mech. Then, instead of Overload, it can destroy itself at the end of the turn if it’s your only minion.
---
You'll put this in every single Hunter deck(unless there's some new card like [[Spiteful Summoner]]).
---
This is normal rarity but Desert Obelisk is Epic? Someone please explain.
---

7/4/4 | Battlecry: Reveal a spell from your deck. Summon a random minion with the same Cost.  
---
As someone who played a good amount of memey mechathun lock in wild that would indeed be too strong. (The reason I use the demon package is because I found that fighting for board early is best with minions rather than spells since most agro decks can re develop easily, and this card also thins your deck quite fast)
---
No, it's not dying. No, it's not P2W.
---
The game isn't seeing the numbers it had a couple years ago when broken sets were coming out, but when taken in context, that isn't the game dying. Card games go through cycles.
---
I was thinking of masters call. Whoops.
---
Why's that?  Do they use over-complicated terminology/grammar?
---
Ive taken out muck, he was a weak point and so far the few games ive played without him have gone better. Replaced it with the 3 mana discover a spell, next spell this turn reduced by 3. Im still having trouble finishing people off but its a work in progress. Ill be looking up some shaman decks later as well as any advice i get here.
---
They need near infinite value to compete like everyone else.
---
Das ja sowieso, Knirsch ist ganz sicher nicht die sinngemäße Übersetzung aus dem englischen Crush
---
die namen sind kompletter bullshit
---
Can't say you give priest bad cards if you give priest no cards.
---
Houndmaster Shaw as well. He's amazing but due to master's call he rarely sees play right now.
---
So the theme this expansion is "let's just print as many busted cards as possible"?
---
Unconditional destroy a minion and take damage equal to its health will see play regardless of the body it has, and this one has a fat amount of damage. It's a 2 for 1 minimum, if you are going drop for drop you win the game off this if no answer. They drop their 5 drop, (after you dropped your 5 drop) and you murder it while answering a 6 drop and using your board to clean up the rest of theirs.
---
Obelisk + Inner Rage + Coin + 2x Bloodsworn = ~~15 damage to your opponents face~~ easy kills on 3 of your opponent's 1/1's
---
Well bomb hunter is technically better than beast hunter by the stats but masters call essentially makes beast hunter possible. Without masters call the dire frenzy “midrange” beast hunter simply isn’t even on the map.
---
You’re right that I think a deck this card fits really really well in is secret hunter. For one it gives you a secret. Second It gives you a weapon which 1/3 synergize with secrets. And that deck notoriously runs out of “stuff” to play until you play zuljin.
---
I'll comment in a reddit thread about it.
---
This in late game on berylium nullifiered mech is my shaman nightmare.
---
Yay, now you have two useless minions instead of one.

Isn’t that the same with Priest?
---
Really don’t know the type of decks they want players in Standard to build with the mishmash of cards they have since Witchwood.
---
Pack it up, they will say that
---
Its what they did with molten gaints:
---
They nerfed it from 20 to 25 mana then buffed it back down to 20 mana and HoF'ed it.
---
Totally gonna try it
---
I think Dane is gonna love this one!!
---
Same, most priest players I know are control players and hate combo, but hey, blizz thinks we are combo players since that's the only option we have now so wth.
---
Other than the obvious Mecha'Thuun combo, I'm thinking Deathrattle rogue again with Nozzle Crawlers, Mech Whelps, Da Undatakah, and maybe even Hakkar for meme points. But we still need a replacement egg though...
---
The fact this is a 3 drop is ridiculous

I want chaos in Hearthstone, that's all I want. I want to have that sense of anyone being able to build a powerful deck if they're skilled enough when it comes to the understanding of the game. There were times where I made original decks that did well, and that's the most rewarding experience I've ever had with this game(for example I got to legend with worgen warrior WAY before it got popular, it was just my own deck idea and it worked super well). But that just seems more and more improbable now, especially with  so many combo enabling cards being nerfed and the powerhouses of the sets being something that doesn't require any creativity, like Zilliax or Blastmaster Boom. The online format is both Hearthstone's biggest boon, and it's killer. There are so many people playing and sharing their high winrate decks that the meta becomes super stale super quickly compared to the old days of TCG. This is the case with TCG in general, since they're information-based games and the internet gives hella information. But with Hearthstone, they have so much potential power to fix this issue, always make things fresh.
---
The sets could be lower in quantity but more frequent in releases, we could have WAAAAY more nerfs and buffs, hell they could even do the set rotation method they're doing with Arena right now. Even make more powerful cards that people need to be creative with. I'm tired of blatantly overpowered cards that you just slap in a deck like the Dr. Booms, I want more cards like Prismatic Lens. But they just don't do it, I don't understand why they let the game get stale. And now they're paying for the consequences. In hindsight, there are SO many ways this game could've continued not only thriving, but growing. There's still no replays, still no serious tournament mode, and most of all the devs don't want to shake the meta up. The saving graces right now are arena, and arguably the single player content(honestly with the exception of the Boomsday one they feel pretty samey now). But they don't do anything substantial about constructed, which is the biggest audience of the game.
---
Honestly, I hope one day we get a sequel to this game, instead of milking this sad cow until it withers away. A big talented team to work on it from the start, no more spaghetti code. Those features we want like replays and a proper tourney mode, need to be there from the start. Actually being able to play on mobile without deleting the battery, and not crashing on every device. And please, a more active balance team and more frequent releases or big changes with the card pool. I don't understand how the devs don't do everything in their power to prevent the meta from getting stale. Hell while we're at it they can even add more classes, since they don't have to compensate for previous releases, which has been their biggest issue.
---
Then check back at 10 like the livestream said. Don't try to shame me like having a couple hours before work is some extreme privilege. Asshole.
---
Until someone doesnt kill pyro and they uninstall :p
---
Bruh 1 mana mecharoo bruh
---
I read the German title several times trying to understand it as English before I realized the rest of the card was in German too.
---
Mechathun won't activate if you have a board of minions, so the rest would have to be spells. Unlikely to be very good, since you're probably running deathrattles like loot hoarder etc
---
You know, maybe they were telling us they were limiting new cards to those 4 things? Hue.
---
You can just play the mechathun last
---
Éqbwdu
---
Definitely closer to his in-game model! Very nice!
---
People left their credit card to all employees!?!
---
WHAT?!? That’s truly an open ended statement.
---
“New England isn’t having it 😄
---
Seriously, I thought they were at least gonna reveal a bunch of cards, but nope, a single one.
---
Has it ever been consistent? My memory is failing me here but I can't recall a single time this class has remained within a theme/archetype going from one expansion into another
---
Yep, that was my "plus" part. Makes it pretty unlikely this card would enable a combo.
---
Shadowform support
---
Rogue’s back everyone! Yayyyyy....
---
Throw in a deranged doctor for some healing
---
Why all warrior cards are epic ?
---
You forget silver hand recruits/dragon/hand buff
---
I can't roll my eyes hard enough at how serious this is to you, as if finding out about the card tomorrow would change anything.
---
Mecha'thun is not even on the same level as the other two. It's one of the cards that I regret crafting the most :(
---
Had someone in New Orleans do it. Oops
---
Would Expired Merchant (incoming SoU Warlock rare) be good in this budget deck?
---
The lich king asks that you stop stealing his spells.
---
Nah, we need more self healing. Maybe 1 mana restore 5 health to your hero. That’d help
---
Yeah she did the same thing on one of my runs too.
---
tired of these murlocs with their stupid faces.
---
Quick, make a post that's shitty to get easy and fast karma
---
I could see this fitting in a mech/deathrattle rogue if it ever becomes a thing. The deck was pretty viable a couple of expansions ago. Esp because of necrium vial and blade. Dropping this on turn 5 into mech welp and vial seems like a pretty nutty turn 6.
---
Looks like a day one craft, at least for me.
---
truth be told
---
Could be good, but the statline worries me. Will test when set comes out
---
What really? Where did they confirm that?
---
Nope! Remember mechathun priest? It works!
---
I can’t think of any good situation you would want to just increment an enumeration. I think it’s much more likely this is an intentional change. 
---
It’s worth mentioning that noz isn’t a great mechanic in single player since AI isn’t realistically limited by the turn timer.
---
Personally, I like single player stuff a lot if I’m multitasking since I’m not time pressured, the times I’ve had noz dropped i would have just lost the game had it only been 15 seconds per turn.
---
Maybe - and this is just a thought - they should stop printing cards that generate **three cards out of one card.**
---
For all classes. It's getting ridiculous. At what point do we get punished for using resources in this game?
---
yeah i never thought id see nomi as often as i do on high ladder (which is rarely but still)
---
2 mana deal 5 to the face.
---
for the love of god, can paladins go back to being control (not combo) or dragon. geeze, stop with all the aggro stuff
---
Conjurer's is the problem. You get the giant on 4 (or 3 if your deck is built around it) as a reward for not doing anything else. Giant is not the issue. The issue is that Conjurer's turns this high tempo card that is really meant to pressure other slow decks and get down a big body against aggro into a win condition.  
---
  
---
I think the simple solution is to take away twinspell from calling so it doesn't stop slow non Warrior decks from playing the game.  
---
But the real answer is to not print what is essentially a 3 mana cube plus activator which adds itself to your hand. Especially after seeing the power level of cube.
---
I feel that if blizzard could easily nerf conjurer mage by adding another 12 mana giant type of card with low stats but a strong battlecry. Like 12 mana 4/4 “for each ____ played this game reduce the cost of this card by (1)” and “Battlecry: gain +1/+1 for each card in your opponents hand” or something
---
Just play it like miracle rogue with auctioneer
---
Thats the order i was sayin!
---
Why karma exists?
---
I use only ocasionally
---
i just like how there are several options here, op new legend
---
Late game **fisher** FTFY
---
It was still a combo, but sort of combo control-y.
---
It didn't aim to OTK anymore, but rather double massive burst with 2 anyfins.It was the second anyfin that was the big deal
---
Stomped so hard till it cracked open a couple of Murloc eggs.
---
Very true. But in a weird that silences the naysayers who go "HS is JAMMING ARCHETYPES DOWN OUR THROATS".
---
Well there you go naysayers. You can't make that claim anymore when we're getting only a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and nothing really concrete.
---
I honestly can't remember the last time a new priest legendary saw significant play.  I think in the entirety of the game... Only Vol'Jin and Lyra were half-decent.  Everything else has been pure garbage.
---
Catrina Muerte - meh.
---
Princess Talanji - trash.
---
Bwomsandi - trash.
---
Confessor Paletress - trash.
---
Temporus - trash.
---
Zerek, Master Cloner - trash.
---
Herald Volazj - trash.
---
Lady in White - trash.
---
Chameleos - trash.
---
List goes on and on...
---
Give it +3/+2, would see play
---
Friendly reminder that [[Necrium Blade]] and [[Necrium Vial]] are still around...
---
Me, October 2018: Health is the most important resource in this game, and this class recovers it better than any other. I'm sure it's a winner! I'll play it exclusively!
---
Me, today: aw.

5/-/- | Trigger a friendly minion's Deathrattle twice.  
---
Saboteur doesn't necessarily ruin it (you probably have other spells you'll need to dump from hand before playing mechathun), scorpion *maybe* though
---
How to empty your hand?
---
Rogue mains are hating Blizzard right now.
---
Is there a new card? If so, does anyone know the name? Thank you.
---
But the gem is visible in the picture already
---
Why not 2 faceless? Excuse my ignorance
---
Looks good but maybe a win more card? The name is literally BM
---
I see this card as more forgiving for his passive as well as drawing some demons that do damage to ur hero
---
It works differently than that.  Allow me to explain:
---
End of Turn:
---
Missile Launcher goes off, killing Voodoo Doll and Mechathun.  Both of them are dead, and their deathrattles both trigger.
---
Since Voodoo Doll dies first, it resolves first, killing the Missile Launcher.
---
Mecha'thun dies second, but since the Missile Launcher was not met when it triggered, it doesn't resolve.
---
Toast had tried something similar in a Deathrattle Priest deck using Voodoo Doll and Reckless Experimenter.  See here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwCFXqMN5Ek  (starts at 6:20)
---
Somewhere Dane is polishing his Sneed vigorously.
---
That deck was so cool
---
The handbuff deck is also really fun to play. It got me to legend easily this month. I do agree, though, that the Glowstones are not good enough. I swapped them for minibots.
---
&gt; want to keep multiple dead cards in hand until turn 8?
---
[[Leeroy Jenkins]] and this card both provide positive tempo, and can be played on their own merits. *Some* aggressive decks are also happy to play [[Inner Rage]] for value.
---
Being able to threaten this if the game goes long while having the pieces work on their own is a powerful strategy.
---
It's not so much that it loses the reborn effect, and more than it gets flagged as "reborn".  Since Faceless copy those flags, he won't get reborn. If you reincarnate it, it dies and get summoned again. If you use it on a non-reborn minion, you should end up with the reborn copy at 1hp and a non-reborn minion at full hp. If you reincarnate a reborn minion, you'd end up with only the full HP non-reborn copy.
---
The combo potentials are insane!
---
thank you for your service Lambo
---
I've found niche uses for all except Chameleos and Temporus. You're right. They all fall flat.
---
U will die from fatigue

5/6/2 | Charge. Battlecry: Summon two 1/1 Whelps for your opponent.  
---
Most likely it will work like twinspell, where the post-reborn minion loses the text. I imagine that bouncing those will not have reborn
---
Another filler
---
Lol the reveal video was 1 hour 1 minute 1 second, 1/1/1, neat.
---
Not to mention redemption.
---
I wouldn't put this into a rogue deathrattle deck in wild tbh. You already have ways to get 1/1:s out earlier with Barnes and Kobold Illusionist, and this would just dilute the Barnes pool. By turn 5 you'll only have 2-3 deathrattle cards in your hand anyway unless all you do is draw in the early game which is usually a bad idea in wild. If this sees play it's probably in a combo deck like Mecha'thun instead.
---
IMO the best one we ever had, that always saw place, was Raza, and that got nerfed to death. 
---
Shadowreaper Anduin, got nerfed with Raza, but still saw play.
---
Velen by default, but got nerfed when they HOF'd Mind Blast.
---
We cant catch a break
---
People who hate the Standard Hero Cards call those cards Death Knights. But, if you call those card Death Knights during arguments, they dismiss your entire argument on that basis.
---
Either stop calling them Death Knights. Or, even better, don't bother arguing with people on the Internet, lol.
---
New Murloc Legendary has everything to do with the aggressive gameplan. Which deck used Sir Finley? Pirate Warrior, one of the most aggro deck ever existed. 
---
Paladin has now its own Sir Finley, like 8/9 hero-power can be used for Aggro/Minion combat, only 1 is a pure Control hero-power.
---
Dragon Paladin was so far I know never really good. Only Warrior and Priest made good use to it.
---
Your right. Edit to read neutral cards from murloc shaman.
---
Why does it bother you so much that people are complaining about an event that was advertised? I didn't enjoy the event that was advertised via Youtube, so I complained a bit. 
---
Why are you taking it so seriously?
---
Fatiquing people with rogue without coldlight seems incredibly questionable
---
That's correct! You can look up frequency tables for any language and isolate the most common characters (or, more reaslistically, the most common 2- or 3-character patterns) and rot13 those to find patterns to match against a frequency baseline in your text.
---
If you don't know the output language, this is a quick way to automate checking many languages and get a set of potential languages to work with.
---
i appreciate your service
---
o yea this big brain time
---
That's pretty funny. Seems like it's still missing some assets. A lot of times if it still has stuff to download in the background you won't have sound but can still play, may be similar.
---
Does it say "downloading" when you go to the main menu? If so just let that happen. If not, may just need to re-download to get those missing assets or whatever is happening.
---
Fuck wild I guess
---
https://youtu.be/m-R4FJj_vxk
---
Can’t wait for the savage combo prismatic lens into this swapped cost with a crappy murloc
---
I feel like the power level on this card is going to end up nerfed by a mana. Too bad it's not worth much dust
---
I mean, presumably even if you don't kill it you still have a 10/10 on the board that kills the enemy in 3 turns if they don't kill it
---
I'd definitely play a 1 mana Gral the Shark
---
The devs put it pretty simply IMO: Reborn works the same way as Divine Shield
---
So if you copy a minion without Divine Shield, the copy will also not have a shield.
---
However, if you resurrect or bounce/replay a Divine Shield minion that has lost its shield, that copy will once again have its shield on the new summon.
---
People are talking about degenerate combos, but this just looks like a solid drop in any deathrattle rogue deck where the deathrattles are more important than the bodies. Which is all of them. The only question is whether, as a one of, it's enough to make a deathrattle rogue work.
---
Deathrattle synergy Rogue legendary. 5 Mana 5/5 is decent, the effect is hard to evaluate. Anka is best with a filled hand and with deathrattles that are impactful. She also enables some combo potential as she makes your highcost deathrattles playable with Necrotic Vial or makes them backstabbable, so things like Mecha'Thun for instance.
---
Yikes unlucky :c
---
Play this card
---
Get your board wiped
---
Go into fatigue 
---
?????
---
Profit
---
It would just be a mid range tempo
---
You run imps like the 2/4 when it takes damage summon an imp, or rafaams scheme, or doubling imp.
---
Gives you a few options for EVIL genius
---
Im missing dollmaster in the entire plot twist deck :(
---
They won't
---
I see the point you're making, but Dog didn't play Mana Cyclone in any of the three decks he used to win the Las Vegas Masters Tour
---
At this point, it would probably be easier to list the class themes Paladin *doesnt* have than the ones it does...
---
I actually got a golden celestia, disenchanted it after a month, and then opened another normal one not long after. Blizzard why
---
This card looks out of place in this set.
---
Why are people calling it singletons now instead of highlander?
---
Why not just Mecha’thun?
---
It won't show up in a typical game, but it will definitely show up in a Trolden video if this card is played in any deck (since people will try out highlander decks).
---
There are way better ways to do that
---
Inner fire priest can do 15+ damage in one turn if they start the turn with a 1/1 on board, so this has synergies with inner fire as well.  You're forgetting that board clears are at a premium.  Khadgar mage invests a bunch to create a big board that is tough to clear, and does no damage on that turn.  Is that also a bad combo?
---
Eh i feel like there might be a mechathun combo here
---
Even the simpleton player from WoW or Warcraft 3 knows that Paladin can resurrect fallen soldiers. Lore wise a Paladin is nothing more than an athletic Priest.
---
I think most people on this subreddit are dumb as shit or just mindlessly upvoting whatever seems right, barely playing this game at all.
---
This is a huge power play, but I don't think it has enough support just yet to be a high tier deck. Right now only the Whelp has a broken deathrattle; the others are mediocre at best. If we have one more on the same power level as Whelp, Deathrattle Rogue will be around tier 2. If there are 2 more, it will be tier 1 easy.
---
Why are you getting downvoted for referring to our lord and savior [[Bolderfist Oger]]
---
Fortunately, there's also shadowcaster rogue. Now you can get a 1/1 minion without using shadowcaster!
---
All the combo stuff is fun but won't be where this cars finds a home. More likely you just play tempo warrior and drop this whenever you can get the extra rush/charge/berserker
---
Two bloodlust Shaman, prior to getting the cards it received in Rise of Shadows (and it isn't as if Murloc Shaman is tier 1) was plagued by jank hands that reduced the consistency of the deck while also being a consistency issue if you ran only one copy. It's more bearable now because Shaman can make more minions with less cards spent. Murloc Paladin does have / will have good card draw which should counterbalance janky draws running top heavy stuff in an aggressive deck but that only makes the issue of blowing up your own deck and running out of resources more prevalent. I guess you put Nomi in the deck as a finisher? Maybe if your opponent has spent so many resources the hope is that by that point they can't kill two boards full of Murlocs and beat Nomi. Just a guess.
---
I think the archtype needs way more support than this to fare well on ladder. Sure it can beat Control decks alright, but the trouble is withstanding aggro and tempo decks. There are some really powerful tempo cards in this set somfar. The Plague of Murlocs also will hurt a lot.

6/6/7  
---
In wild, you can run 2 minstrels, hemet, anka, mechathun. In standard, ashmore and jepetto can help if your deck is low in minions.
---
So crazy of a plan, let's do it. It might even work! (For half a sec)
---
It's been more problematic than 90% of the HoF cards since beta. Really weird they haven't
---
I don't know.....I played through the last Highlander meta I didn't even realize that the term I used had shifted.
---
Love your version so so much &lt;3 Fantastic work!
---
I agree, give us some decent 1-4 cost minions. Allow for a tempo oriented strategy that allows for some board control + hero power utilization.
---
I love how this is a more Wild centric expansion!
---
Control Hunter FTW!
---
Though the HP doesn't support Control Hunter, it definitely helps to keep the pressure on for It, setting up a win condition. If a hunter can live long into the game and use their HP often enough, it's likely that they'll be able to out damage them.
---
Don't let control hunter be a dream
---
make it a reality 
---
Sincerely, A control hunter lover.
---
Yeah people keep bringing up Mechathun but my first thought was a deck with Whelp, Cairne, etc. and Necrium Vial.
---
Let's GOOOO
---
MY EYES ARE OPEN.
---
Hell yeah, this in wild will be amazing
---
So Recruit is making a comeback.
---
beautiful
---
Who's next?
---
Deathstalker Rexxar disagrees.
---
Tbf early game weapons for rogue tend to hurt rogue as they cant use their hero power.
---
I dont agree with the other guy but, its also common for people to come here looking for validation. Talking about how bad your opponent is and nameshaming it is very common, so its normal for people to start thinking its fake most of the time, and its just for the attention.
---
In any case, responding to your post: No, the time can be used to think about your future plays. Thats the time every player has, and they can decide to not use it entirely by passing the turn. They are not breaking any rule or being rude by simply deciding to use all the time they have avaiable. Maybe they do it on purpose, maybe they are lagging, but its inside the rules and its a time margin that its there for players to use.
---
And dont post names here along "bad things" those players may have done. Its name-shaming and its forbidden in this sub (and in most other gaming subs) because of harrasment problems. You are mostly being downvoted for that.
---
It's a common card so that newer players have the opportunity to use this card, and potentially play other cards that they don't have at hand.
---
I don’t play hearthston, but I play a lot of tcgs. This card seems broken as fuck, +2 card advantage for three mana is broken even if it’s just random draws.
---
I used to beat them up with Mech Hunter, back when I cared about Wild. 
---
They can still highroll though. Pulling out Statue with Barnes and keep rezzing it usually results in a loss.
---
So I listen to my brother and you also and I go to Asia Server, because nobody axe a question there. My brother give me his alt account so that I can start to practice odd rogue and tempo cho azalina mage. I go to rank 15 with 83 % winrate. My goal is to be master of Crack mage. It give you rush when you play it, why can't every deck be so.
---
Isn't Redemption the OG Reborn card?
---
Sunstriker#11754 NA 80g Friend quest I show,you go first.
---
&gt; uming that 1) combining effects is comparable to drawing and playing them and that 2) card creation is equal to card draw.
---
I'm sorry I thought the topic was Boulderfist Ogre compared to BoK and River croc. Why is the most powerful part of BoK not relevant to the topic?
---
M’rgl
---
As a new player, the queue time has been pretty bad. At high ranks, Im usually able to find a game in under a minute. In lower ranks (rank 19), it takes 7 minutes to find a match. Just a reminder that if you experience long queue times, its because the game is trying to match you with other new players.
---
The game is not P2W but its Pay to Experience. If you don't want to spend any money, you can make a fairly decent Mech Druid or Mech Hunter deck with mostly commons and rares, which can carry you to rank 5 with some practice. I have made at least rank 10 with minimal effort and play time on multiple accounts where I have spent no money. So with dedicated effort, its not hard to be F2P legendary by doing daily quests, special events, or arena.
---
I don't think the game will shrink. TFT was an unexpected competitor that came out so it will defintely force Blizzard to try new things. As far as their attitude goes, it seems like Hearthstone is one of their products which generates the most revenue.
---
Oh I see some c++,no?
---
Just missing concede
---
Looks like a solid card. Crazy in Arena too.
---
Edit: It fixed! The next time I started the app it solved itself. Strange. I had this problem for almost about a week.
---
I absolutely like Dragon Priest, especially in KFT. I was REALLY hype with RR because they were releasing a lot of Dragon synergy and... Priest went to the copy/value route. Although I'm playing Dragon Mage CC, I miss Dragon Priest.
---
So the recruit keyword is gone just like echo it seems.
---
TL;DR - They are shit at making their own game and couldn't care less about you or anyone else that plays it as long as you pay. Blizzard make EA look like a charitable organization.
---
What about forsaken
---
Divine shield is really it's only unique flavor. Everything else overlaps with other class flavor.
---
!= Reaches far much further than just c++
---
Take a look at the classic Succubus
---
oh wait...
---
Implying highlander isn't still used as a pop culture reference.
---
I thought we all decided to stick to Reno even though Highlander made more sense, then people started combining highlander cardnames to name priest decks and it kept going downhill.
---
Streamer: ok next turn lethal  
---
opponent: Places finley from fishflinger and gets warrior hero power to evade lethal  
---
Streamer: \*\*Can't kill opponent and dies next turn\*\*
---
Those deathrattles will be 1/1, so they can be killed by the majority of spells you run.
---
Forsaken are the result of the Lich King’s necromantic powers.
---
Just rub the 4/3 girl that makes your hero immune on your turn
---
How else will I know when to go dislike his videos without subscribing?
---
Narrow enough to slit our wrists rather than suffer the shitty cards priest gets this expansion? Yes please!
---
Out jerked again
---
Majordomo deathrattle + some repeatable hero power shenanigans
---
Seems like a nice idea. But have you thought of mechs and Dr.boom? This is the worst part about warrior, every good idea looks at the current warriors decks and go like, ok there's no reason to run this except fun
---
Paladins can resurrect forsaken, can they not?
---
This is going to be so fucking disgusting in wild T\_T noooooooooooooo
---
Shadowstep is still a thing and is more powerful to use in the way you're describing.
---
Part of me does miss the deck to be honest. Had disenchanted the warleaders when they were needed and only recently recrafted them. The deck’s so much worse than it used to be, the equality nerf pretty much killed my version of the deck.
---
I actually played that deck back when it was standard and yeah it's kinda meh but it's stupidly fun
---
We had some effects like this before in rampage and blood warriors, I'm gonna be doubtful on this one. Having hurt minions that survive the enemies turn are usually a mistake of your opponent.
---
Nah I’m talking about having a board clear for a mechathun rogue
---
Please no. We do not need this buff. Its already an insane card in wild. 2 mana will be ridiculous. Its played in almost every warlock deck.
---
I do also want to point out that priest does have a 3 drop who summons mummies when you cast spells, so there is some precedent set for that kind of flavor.
---
It would be absolutly stupid to put that many Murlocs in your Mechathun deck just to be able to thin it with this card...
---
Because mrmgllmrglgl
---
Prismatic into turn 5 scales is going to win games vs aggro.  Add the anyfin later on and you finish even control decks off.
---
If this hits anything it's pretty much guaranteed to be a strong play though. Everyone is thinking about homerun combo potential, but I think this fits into any warrior deck as is, especially with Dr. Boom giving all mechs rush and the opportunity to take favorable trade damage. Like say rush an Omega Devastator into a token and then drop this on the remaining body to get a 3/3 + 4/4 for 3 mana. That's still pretty ridiculous.
---
So 2x Emperor -8 mana on 4 pieces.
---
Combo cost 18 mana. Becomes 10 dmg is 30 with empty board or insane luck.
---
Too bad, I’m upvoting you!
---
I’m just highlighting a custom card from over 3 years ago.
---
This is going to piss me off so much. Already hate murloc decks.
---
You don't get the rank icons on mobile, just names.
---
Call to arms has 8 other targets besides blue gills and doesn't pull warleaders. Worse case scenario is you just don't play finja if call to arms grabs the blue gills and you have warleaders in hand.
---
Ah cheap board controlling spells and a few legendaries to high roll into wins. Yeah that deck sounds familiar to me.
---
There are drawbacks with every system; being forced to take cards in a 3-card package in that way is the foundation of progression in the heist/dungeon run formats. Slay the Spire takes a different approach; you can tell the consequences of both systems.
---
Not really Jerry, probably a cosmetic connection your mind *mistakes* for thematic.
---
Rogue draws hella fast even without myra. I dont think it's as a big a problem as you might think.
---
This is way better than any guide i have found so far. It is great that you went into detail about each match up. Obviously muligans are different for each match up but most guides say ‘this or that card’ is the best to get in muligans and leave it at that. Also very valuable insight into playing reactively. Thanks for this.
---
I don't know about this one... Seems kinda too strong considering the current zoo archetype.. lackeys are not hard. They're adding (more than likely) more generators, and they are already able to pump out 6 lackeys at the least using cable rat and the warlock 2 drop. Seems insanely strong due to consistency level.
---
What I meant was: few weeks ago it would make the "best" deck out of all your cards. Now when I autocomplete it's different every time. Not totally different but there's a lot of variation now.
---
well yes. Mechathun decks only work if they arent the meta. If they are, you just tech around them and BAM!
---
Nine Lives Hunter featuring Sylvanas.
---
I mean, I agree. But I still see Northshire Cleric getting the axe.
---
There wasn't a formal succession ceremony but Arthas sure did become King of Lordaeron very shortly after he killed his father.
---
At the same time, it would keep Boom and Hagatha in check. Infinite value doesnt mean much if I just get to win.
---
Hi i´m Mr. Meeseek Look at me!!
---
Check twitch.tv/theohs_ last two days he is playing a lots of what currently is called freeze mage in top 100 legend.
---
For the love of Christ - I don't know why the hell Blizz keeps printing Murloc cards for Paladin.
---
Your welcome to your opinion but I can't imagine any situation where 2 random cards is ever better than 3 random cards.
---
Plus its a joke my dude, try to lighten up a bit.
---
So basically what you were telling me is it that I never have to run a weapon in my hunter deck ever again? I don't see any reason 2 directly you run a weapon instead of this card unless you are running secret Hunter and specifically want eaglehorn bow.
---
I hope so Im going to be playing hunter.
---
SILVER MONKY SILVER MONKY
---
Tbh I’d like 3 mana charge. Without emperor in standard it’s really difficult to get crazy shit going at 3 mana, and wild is way more broken than Worgen OTK.
---
Imma gonna thoughtsteal your hunting pack... 😈
---
What’s deranged again?
---
Totally agree with you there. Paladin has been the most inconsistent in terms of theme
---
Watch out for this man!
---
Exactly.
---
I think you may be lost.
---
You are correct, StS is great in that it often displays the negative aspects of your choices. Also, in terms of balance, fatigue is a pretty big factor, especially in the early encounters. With StS recycling all but exhausted and power cards, the drawback of fewer cards isn’t really an issue. I don’t think it would be broken as you’d have to balance for fatigue and consistency of your decks.
---
Myra’s won’t trigger bombs past your hand limit, plus bomb warrior means nothing if you play in wild
---
You put the mecha'thun in the deck as a backup plan for when you face odd warrior since 42 isn't even enough to break their armor.
---
What priest needs isn't a win condition, it's disruption so that priest can win in fatigue.
---
See that's weird because I also copied Dane's list straight from his video description once and it did not have Barnes at all.
---
&gt; 2 random cards is ever better than 3 random cards.
---
Two random cards your opponent chose to put in their deck VS three random cards from three subsets of cards (one of which can be a total crapshoot). On top of that, different classes value different effects at different costs.
---
I feel like rogue and priest have had the burgle identity kinda diluted between them when i personally feel like rogue deserves it more and priest should be more of a buffing/value oriented spell class.
---
In the matchups when you simply don't need all the damage Finja is just insane. In other matchups you just never play it, but in any case Finja is just too good not to run it.
---
No, you can go to the Blizzard store and unlock it.
---
Huh. Maybe he made minor changes after the video? Or maybe you just picked the one time 4 months ago when he cut Barnes for a bit?
---
Oh right, derp. Don't mind me.
---
It's over garr I have the board!
---
Now this is the hearthstone content I subscribe for. Also r/lostredditors if this wasn’t on purpose
---
*Hunter's Pack. Ah shoot, can't edit titles.
---
I can't even LOLer than seeing this thread
---
Never! We can always......... Aspire for more! :rimshot: 😎
---
Single accounts are capped at 5 a day I think.
---
Does this combo with cards like \[\[Gral, the Shark\]\]?
---
Neither was spell hunter, neither was 1-cost minions, neither was any form of control hunter

8/8/8 | Deathrattle: Restore 8 Health to your hero.  
---
So, almost all average to amazing... except for starving buzzard. Even then if you are running a beast deck it’s not terrible to get it.
---
I think it's a different guy, I remember the thread you're talking about.
---
That bar isn't too high to begin with.
---
1 hour / 1 minute / 1 second
---
this one actually got me.  congratulations i guffawed.
---
Ok okay i see what you mean now. Yeah, but still I find myself flip flopping between one/two call to arms one/zero finja. Running all three feels very bad because 2 of them become dead draws far too often
---
I think it's also technically against blizzards terms of service, so you might get banned if you're not a huge part of the community
---
Gladiator's isn't good enough to slot in a deck but 10 immune damage is far from a dud.
---
WHAT WHY DOES HUNTER NEED THIS MUCH VALUE??
---
This is really strong, but I don't think it's broken.  You need to have a lackey on board and your stats are split.  In early game its easier to deal with 2 decent minions than 1 huge minion a la Mountain Giant.    
---
The nastiest I see is a T2 cable rat. T3 lackey, coin, this guy.  Thats 3/3 &amp; 5/5 on T3.  It could be busted, but its a 3 card combo minimum, so it might not be tier 1 (lackey generator, lackey, this card).    
---
Who knows?  In 2 months I might be raging at my phone when this drops on me.  xD
---
What video ?
---
Inner rage has seen plenty of top level play in the past.
---
When memes dont make sense, its not funny
---
Yes because you are the only one that could have thought of this , using an enraged warrior legendary minion with charge with a new warrior card that synergies with damaged minions 
---
Upboated and gilded
---
Then that'd be on the player ultimately~
---
And draw each of the combo pieces before you myra's, to be safe.
---
Emptying your hand isn't so hard, though. Run tunnel blaster and some other deathrattles
---
Holy shit
