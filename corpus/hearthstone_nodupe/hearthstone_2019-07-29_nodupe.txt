Yeah I agree that they should keep free legendaries free at any point in time into a rotation. I don't get why they think it's bad to give it to new players passed an event. If anything it incentivizes them to keep playing.
---

---
As for everything else, not sure what to tell you. If you're a player that can almost reach legend, I feel like all the things you are complaining about should've been obvious to expect. It's unfortunate, but what model could they possible put in place for someone who played before and is now returning? 
---
I could see reasoning in the idea of giving all the legendary quests players received from each expansion that is currently in Standard. Like, there were a lot of opportunities for free rise of shadows packs this expansion. I don't see why they couldn't give the quests for Witchwood, Boomsday, Rastakhans, and RoS. This way any new player has a chance to get like 10+ packs from each expansion. I seriously doubt this would affect sales for blizzard in a negative way. If anything, it would get new players using the new cards and want to buy and more.
---
---
---
"good luck"
---
Even that has flaws though. Decks built around a certain synergy or payoff are draw dependent to a degree.
---
Why? Guaranteed (good) cards, guaranteed legendaries, singleplayer content. The price of old adventures is the same since launch (5$ per wing).
---
Is that expensive?
---
Compared to other games? Maybe.
---
Compared to prices of packs and normal expansions? That's a great value deal.
---
It is isnt it?
---
Also, these cards are probably being played much more often in a positive game state.  I think this is an example of correlation != causation.
---
I disenchanted both my Ultimate Infestations because I was thinking why would you ever want to draw 5 cards, that's bound to overdraw!
---
What’s so impressive?
---
What are you talking about, Krush was always one of the worst classic legendaries and only got played for a little while recently
---
1. There's a thread for that
---
2. U didn't even include Ur battletag
---
3. Your account is hours old, u want people to go first despite creating a new account here and not even reading the rules? Not to mention the whole thread sounds like a weak scam attempt
---
This is absolutely gorgeous! Great work!
---
If a card is 5 stars its shaping the meta though. 1 star implies that it's so unbelievably trash that it will never see play in any meta. If Blizzard ends up pushing this tempo identity for priest then Lazul could be a pretty good part of that deck
---
The "*prediction of the near future*" part is when he does the first [trump reviews before the meta is devoleped](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvEIxIeBRKSiFjMBxpQOud8d5X4Resdeb). This is the re-review and the stars are for the current ongoing meta. Dont think trump does more than 2 layers of reviews (unless some big patch happens during a season).
---
Yes it is. People saying stuff like "you can unpack another millhouse if you DE him": then you disenchant him again. Plus if you don't have many classic legendaries its very unlikely. I would personally d/e pit lord, millhouse and gladiator's right away. Batterhead is played sometimes in fringe decks like muckmorpher shaman, plot twist warlock and Big paladin. Betrug is only played in plot twist warlock, so I'd consider disenchanting him as well. But since the expansion is coming so soon, you should actually wait to see if your cards find some use.
---
Aggro shamans and pirate warriors have shaped not just the kft meta but several metals before that. Hyper aggression was the norm. 2 mana cards were HIGHLY valued at that time. You are just being super greedy if you think you could survive with a single 2 cost card in your deck. The was the rationale for not expecting it to see play. And it was correct. It saw no play because you are indeed being super greedy trying to get away with a single 2 drop in a pirate warrior meta.
---
The nerfs made way for a slower meta that made keleseth possible. If people though keleseth would not see play whatsoever keleseth would have never taken off. It's because people recognised keleseth had value after the nerfs that keleseth decks started to rise after the nerfs.
---
I guess, however if it is always good to draw in a specific deck then the card is just good imo. Even if it is a deck catered towards it. Like how prince-2 decks were highly synergistic of him, and thus he had a high winrate (since he was bonkers).
---
Read my examples again. I'm talking about cards that reward you for having beasts and non-beasts on the board. These would synergize with the first two cards you have listened. Being able to make more different types of decks that aren't purely beast dominate, like you have mentioned with Master's Call, would be the goal of such cards.
---
compared to other games? sure
---
compared to other Card games? Hell no.
---
In Games like Yugioh or Pokemon (the Cardgames) you pay up to 70-100 Euro for a new Meta deciding Card. Check how much the Top Meta Decks are worth.
---
I'm with ya, i think the predictions were good for Keleseth for the expansion launch. If the nerfs never happened, Prince 2 would've never seen tier 1 play.
---
Just getting into some Hearthstone, it's pretty fun actually I think.  Hope I get better. LOL
---
Its from rise of shadows. It came out somewhere in the middle of rise of the shadows not from the first day of release
---
Well yeah, it wouldn't hurt to get the quest for the free legendary... But I did expect that and most of the time you get a crappy legendary anyway.
---
What really bugs me is snip snap, not only it was free but it is also extremely powerful and ubiquitous.
---
And with that 3000 dust I don't even get to choose what i want to craft, because apparently Ziliax and Snip snap are mandatory.
---
compared to other games? sure compared to other Card games? Hell no. In Games like Yugioh or Pokemon (the Cardgames) you pay up to 70-100 Euro for a new Meta defining Card. Like Dr. Boom. But you also need 3 Copys of it. 
---
Check how much the Top Meta Decks are worth.
---
*Great is the weapon that cuts on its own*
---
Congrats on your first 12 wins!
---
But then they would cut the solo content for garrisons
---
In terms of the year's total, yeah.  I missed two cards being revealed apparently, so my count was kind of off.
---
Not a bad card but seems mild
---
If you use emperor wraps to make a 2/2 clone of a minion does it get divine shield and taunt as well
---
damn i never realized that shield bearer is 1 mana LOL
---
I really don't believe team 5 has any intention on releasing a thoughtful, logical,well thought out design for ALL 9 classes.
---
They really just have to pick a few to make a well designed set for because imo, the schedule is a nightmare for them. They have to make over 350 cards a YEAR...and we all know the size of this team...it ain't big enough to create balanced/well designed cards in large quantities. 
---
That's why priest is a complete and utter dumpster fire. I have no clue wtf they are trying to do for that class...and now pally is added to the "wtf is my identity supposed to be again??"
---
 KaihatsuJai#1909 Asia server 80g quest trade.  I show, you go first!  (Bump, still waiting!)
---
not a single player will include this card in their constructed deck
---
So over-costed, why can't this be like +5/+5?
---
🤔
---
Blessing of Kings at 4 mana is pretty fine at the mana cost for more aggressive decks as it can effectively be a +4/+4 with charge that doesn't require board space. At 6 mana this is not going in an aggressive deck especially since some of that mana is going to rather defensive keywords. 
---
What this card can help do though is Trade very efficiently. A divine shield on a rush/charge minion can be very powerful as you decide what you run into allowing that divine shield to be worth 4-5+ health instead of 1-2 health. If you have a minion already on board ready to attack Pharaoh's Blessing becomes Argent Commander + taunt + combines it's attack with the minion on board allowing for even better trading. 
---
Is this a worse Spikeridge? Well if you are just looking at the stat total and when the guy dies you get another taunt then yes. However Spikeridge is also a LOT worse when it comes to buffing a minion already on board to trade efficiently with. In terms of stats Pharaoh's is more aggressively stated and trades in summoning a spikeridge for a divine shield. Worse for protecting yourself defensively, but a lot BETTER if you are trading proactively against a mid-big minion allowing you to remove a threat instead of just hold against it for a little longer. 
---
Have sticky minion, play this on it, get a favorable trade and keep the 4/4 buff with taunt.
---
And make it an 8/8 instead of a 7/8 so that it’s basically one of the giants
---
The only semi-viable deck with him is mage, ice block and ice barrier keep you Alive and closers drake makes the game ‘interesting ‘
---
Hard to see the R but it is there
---
Woof
---
2 more mana over Blessing of kings? No thanks
---
Interesting. maybe this makes sunreaver warmage and the spirit playable in pally now but probably not
---
Kings is +4/+4 for 4 mana, so this is two mana more for Divine Shield and Taunt. *Could* see some play, maybe in Arena, but definitely doesn't seem to be as good as Kings, and Kings isn't even run in that many decks.
---
Since it's a copy, like faceless, or prince taldaram, it does get the DS and taunt.
---
Who not just play doomsayer then
---
It's all fun and games until you face a shaman that's using the murloc plague.
---
This card is going to be absurdly broken in Arena.  Even if you stick it on a 1/1 recruit, you can trade it into most minions.  Even a 3/4 minion, if you stick this on it, will trade a kraken.
---
if i have to think of any reason it would be that pally will get support for all those archetypes over the new few sets. Until then it will be as useless as a beach ball made out of pure lead.
---
Fun fact Shieldbearer was a key card in the original incarnation of Zoo back in beta - with all the buff/auras in the deck you could reliably attack with it most turns, essentially giving you a 1/4 or 2/4 Taunt for only one mana. So many people clowned on Reynad for throwing the card in his Zoo until he demonstrated the power of Taunt combined with a ball of stats in a board control deck. 
---
It got phased out pretty quickly when GvG hit, but I still think it’s pretty cool that a card everyone summarily judged as garbage at the start eventually became a part of *the best* deck in Beta.
---
Fireball and pyroblast in standard😭
---
At best, its a slightly better BoK. DS and taunt aren't worth 1 mana each though with the  power level of some of the more recent sets.
---
Hey, just some quick feedback - the Hearthstone logo you are using is the old one. The correct one is available at this page:
---
[https://blizzard.gamespress.com/Hearthstone#?tab=logos](https://blizzard.gamespress.com/Hearthstone#?tab=logos)
---
&gt; Or Troggzor. That card was sooo strong.
---
I day one crafted him because I was *for sure* 100% that he was going to be the new meta.
---
Disappointed in hunter reveals?  Hunter has been T1 for like the past year.
---
Another big reason is probably because there wasn't as significant a meta shake up, and the nerfs/buffs didn't necessitate a big re-review.  I'd imagine at least.  Nerfs changed the meta, but not like when dark pact got nerfed.
---
It's probably work between 5 and 6 mana just from comparing them to previous buffs, though the power of Divine Shield does go up the higher the stats of the minion.   
---
Paladin has gotten a lot of different tools that don't clearly fit into a single deck this expansion so we'll have to see whether this card makes it there in constructed, though I'd wager this is a good enough card in arena.
---
I dont recall shitting on anyone. The title is "Never lose hope in a 0 2 deck" and my response is "Why would I? It gets me easier opponents"
---
Magnetize a less powerful sunwalker
---
The four horseman OTK deck was so fun last season, and its 'identity' was pretty spot on. I wish I could make a more competitive wild version.
---
Not solely due to hunter cards though. And you must also be under the impression that I enjoy typical hunter builds...
---
[removed]
---
He rates the cards based on how much play he thinks they'll see, 1 star means &lt;1% play, 5 stars means staple in a T1 deck, and all the values inbetween have specific meanings, so lots of cards are 1 star just because they won't see play.
---
Pharaoh's Blessing = Blessing of Kings + DS and Taunt for 2 mana.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We miss out on The Don's Blessing in MSOG,
---
Can't wait for The Emperor's Blessing.
---
id do something like play 5 battlecry minions. for the rest of the game your hero power pilfers.
---
Maybe I’m just interested to see someone else’s take on the deck?
---
Wanna see me get down vote bomb?
---
Wanna see me do it again?
---
Are you talking about [this Basic Mage deck](https://disguisedtoast.com/articles/268-starter-basic-mage-0-dust)? If so, which cards did you swap out and for what?
---
Also what rank are you at right now?
---
Battlecry minions is already the Shaman Quest but I like where your reward is going.
---
What's a Priest? never heard about that before.
---
Tell him they're going all-in on Deathrattle rogue.
---
Quest: Play 5 Deathrattles. Reward: Hero power: your Deathrattle cards have Echo this turn.
---
Seeing as the quests are limited to being once a day I’d say yes, or you could just do both
---
Depends. Lots of people work full time, so they can afford to have the free time doing want they want. Depends on how far your money goes.
---
I'm thinking of Spirit of the Tiger. I'm thinking playing that new 5 mana 4/2 stealth reborn and then slapping this on it next turn and smacking. I'm thinking complete the quest and then play this on a minion and copy it giving the 2/2 copy divine shield and taunt. I'm thinking Sunreaver Warmage. And Prismatic Lens.
---
Cool I really appreciate the help. Thanks so much.
---
Most streamers does evaluate card in a vacuum and you are welcome to check it out. What trump does is different because he is evaluating the card while predicting the immediate future meta and that, IMO is more interesting then just evaluating the card in vacuum.
---
depending on how bad you wanted to make the card the quest could involve bouncing minions back to your hand.
---
Yes because that’s the information you have at the time. Any card could be broken with a degenerate combo piece. Like a card that says “if you have an angry chicken win the game”. If you want a reviewer who just says “this card has potential” for every card, then watch pretty much any other youtuber.
---
Could work. But I don't have Doom, i have 1900 dust rn but i will save for Saviors Of Uldum
---
The art looks straight out of custom hs
---
Its much better. I think people are underrating this card a bit. Sunwalker you drop the minion asleep. This in the best case basically gives you a 4 4 divine shield with charge and lets you actually use the divine shield as you desire which is very good. Its mostly a better Argent Commander cause it has more health and taunt that needs a deck with sticky minions. Which of course dont know if will see play but its very close to it IMO.
---
The quest is “destroy ten minions” and the reward is the hero power from the Dalaran Heist “deal 2 damage to an undamaged minion”
---
I'm so sorry you chose to get back into this game. May your ladder matches be blessed with no warriors, rogues, or hunters you brave soul.
---
I agree to a degree.. But the main advantage of seal is that it's +attack and divine shield which lets you trade-up into almost anything. If it gave +health instead of attack it would significantly worse. 
---
+health/taunt/divine shield isn't a great combo because it all gets countered by hard removal/silence/transformed. In that case you basically pay 3 mana more than SoC to do nothing
---
Vanguard is definitely worse if undatakah is the sole reason you’re running it. If you want to run vanguard, fine, but then you should also run lightlord or tirion, and then you have the same problem on the other side of drawing undatakah before you can play vanguard, which means sometimes you pull nothing.
---
On another note, this makes your curve heavier and you’ll lose to aggro. You know what else makes you lose to aggro? Playing a 7/3/3 for no reason. The reason meat wagon is better is because you don’t need to be winning to play it, just not behind.
---
Ok, from what freshair18 replied to my post it looks like something is going on, didn't know about it - sorry. What should have happened at last to my knowledge is you should start at rank 20 (50 is only for new players, after reaching 15 for the first time you can't drop below 20, if you never reached 15 you can drop to 25 max). You also should receive bunch of quests for returning player [returning player experience](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Returning_player_experience) 
---
Maybe you should try to contact support?
---
Can I fuck the guy in the artwork no homo though
---
Oh I really like that hero power
---
Lmao I got bored of league and got back into hearthstone this month too! Crafted token Druid and got to rank 4 for the first time
---
Congrats! I'm yet to achieve my 12
---
As said in another comment, I would agree with that argument if the reaction was less severe, but no one thought this thing would ever in any universe see play basically.
---
And I still think even without changes it would have seen play, specifically in rogue.
---
Alright this expansion has been a joke and there’s no sign that things are getting better. I’m not buying this expansion and am gonna take some time away from the game.
---
No one can make an accurate prediction with so much missing information so there isn't any point in rating cards on how we think they'll perform beyond the immediate meta they're released into. That's not a problem though because ratings for future cards will still be influenced by the presence of older cards.
---
I think the problem is in referring to cards as being "X Star" cards outside the context of the immediate meta. We can't predict that with any meaningful accuracy and by that time we already know how good they are so there's no real point in referring to them in that way after reveal season.

Holy wrath paladin is tier 2 also. It just may not feel like it since bomb warrior wrecks it though.
---
yeahhhhh
---
and if you don't agree... compare it to spikeridge steed
---
Neat deck. Hybrid Secret/Mech hunter?
---
It's a fine metric for measuring the strength of certain cards against certain other cards in the same deck.
---
If one cards has a 90% winrate and the rest of the cards have a 20% winrate, then that one card is probably a problem.  But if all the cards in the deck have a 90% winrate, that's not a card problem, that's a deck problem.  The deck is too strong.  Or in this case, the button is too strong.
---
Don't play that much so how is this unbalanced ?
---
And not only that but Ancestral Healing is bad. So I’m not too excited about this.
---
I literally saw this and thought “no way is taunt + divine shield worth 2 mana”
---
it kills all the minions on the board for just 9 mana how isn’t that unbalanced
---
I was ahead of my time.
---
Thank god, immortal prelate decks were hands down the most annoying deck to play against right before rotation.
---
Weaker in some ways but stronger in others. Against high attack minions that would normally destroy spikeridged minion this is way better. People are really downplaying the divine shield but it basically acts like a spikeridged death rattle since you should be using this to destroy a minion.
---
ive been playing since beta testing and still havent gotten 12 wins. lots of close calls, disconnects on mobile, and unfortunate anal reamings at the last match, but no 12.
---
Yeah. Just pick the right deathrattle minions to die per whatever match up. Just seemed to always out value/tempo control and bomb hunter. Vargoth and shaw are great when they stick or in combos, but they are best as decoys to get rid of removal spells
---
Fap fap
---
&gt;Murlocs are vermin... Murlocs also buff each other, which doesn't feel aligned with Paladin's focus on military hierarchy...
---
Buffing is a major part of Paladin's identity. How is the fact that Murloc's buff one another not in line with Paladin?
---
&gt;Paladin has armies, Murlocs have hordes.
---
This is the height of taking flavor *way* too literally. If you're looking for this kind of distinction in flavor, you will always find something to nitpick in card games.
---
&gt;Druid: Murlocs are aligned with Nature, and are swarmy, both of which match Druid.
---
This is vague and general as hell. Druid's swarms tie into the class' focus on growth in various forms. They rarely directly work together to make the group become greater than the individual the way Murlocs do in Paladin which is much more in line with that class is about.
---
&gt;Hunter: Hunter also goes wide on the board at times (Alleycat, Springpaw, Unleash, etc) and often snowballs (like with Hyena).
---
Hunter has all kinds of Beast synergies, not just swarm, and they're a much broader tribe in general compared to the mostly small Murlocs which is a key part of their tie to Paladin being about the weak being made stronger as part of group.
---
&gt;It's clearly not ideal, is it?
---
It's perfectly fine. "Secret" is just an easy to understand name for a very broad mechanic. Almost all of Paladin's Secrets are tied to protecting, buffing, or debuffing minions which are very Paladin things to do. And they're the cheapest and therefore smallest Secret effects which makes them far less damning in general when your opponent runs into one so it's not like they're tricking the opponent so much as they're reacting in a defensive way. Again, finding issue with the mechanic entirely because of the name is such a narrow view of flavor.
---
&gt;Making quasi-arbitrary decisions that don't entirely fit together hurts the integrity of class identities. Murloc Paladin isn't the end of Hearthstone obviously, but it doesn't help.
---
There's nothing arbitrary about it. It all makes sense philosophically, mechanically, and even flavorfully. Taking everything almost entirely at face value is a guaranteed way to find fault in just about anything.
---
There was a hiccup with the Japanese weekend reveal last weekend, the logical guess would be that it was at least partly due to that.
---
It's much harder to get in touch with people to fix things on the weekends. Traditionally they've scheduled fewer reveals on weekends BUT in the past 2 years of reveal seasons there have always been *a few* every weekend, so this is a bit of a departure from the norm.
---
Good times!
---
my man you are on that GOOD shit.
---
And half of them in this expansion belong to Paladins
---
You are belittling their achievement.  I know it's hard for you, but don't act stupid on me now.
---
I would lot call it unbalanced when it cost you 9 mana and your entire turn and 9 cards to do so ....
---
Which you would need to have in your hand
---
Like Shaman during the previous cycle.
---
Oh right, yeah that's very true. I guess this probably best with something like Zilliax or Convincing Infiltrator then.
---
Fireball was lethal without the Nova/Doomsayer guy.
---
What are you talking about? It has no synergy with Undatakah whatsoever.
---
Reborn cards don't trigger their Battlecries, obviously.
---
More ammo for Big Priest if they wanted to tech this in
---
Pretty much a good way to improve the rez pool for rez priest. Sigh

Lazul is mediocre and will rotate without seeing any play. Mark my words.
---
Amazing
---
When you give Paladin a Reborn quest then give Preist more reborn cards.
---
But plot twist is a Warlock card...
---
Is he though?
---
Reborn on prelate is awful. Comes back as a 1/1 and clogs your deck with garbage.
---
Yes
---
How you passed those warriors barriers? I'm on 4 and lose 5 stars in a row to warriors with such druid.
---
&gt; You poor baby, your goofy card game art doesn’t have tits anymore.
---
Did i complain?
---
Because no one cares about the screenshot if they don't throw in the "BM spam" story.
---
Yeah, but the thing is that it has no Deathrattle at all :p
---
There's Cairne, Mechancial Whelp, Convincing Infiltrator... maybe Zerek shenanigans too (you'll end up with 2x 5/5 with Reborn that can be further cloned next turn).
---
Vargoth says Hi
---
maybe. It doesn't do much in the way of making the pool better, nor does it have too much value, since it's just adding a 1 heath safety shield to a rag or smth, making it not too bad in general.
---
That's why there is a rotation each year. Maybe not currently, but Blizzard could decide to introduce a slower year by having faster archetypes not supported at a specific mana cost or aspect of its shell. 
---
At the time Prince Keleseth was dominant, most classes had no playable 2 drops outside of the classic set, i.e Knife Juggler was between best and third best 2 drop for most classes.
---
One word.
---
Garbage
---
I remember being so angry I got all 3 princes as my first legendaries. It ended up being great. (Except prince 4. That is kind of useless)
---
Aww man
---
Yeah I literally just realised that the reborn copy would not have any buffs on it at all because it only keeps the enchantments when going back to the deck. My bad
---
Might target an enemy minion though. You generally only want to Vargoth spells that for sure will target an enemy / do a friendly only thing.
---
&gt;Spikeridged Steed was quite possibly the best 6-mana card ever printed though
---
It was not, and it is not close. Spikeridged Steed was busted in arena, but not in constructed at all - we've had many cards that have outperformed it in all brackets of skill. 
---

---
I think Rexxar is more versatile, but yeah point taken.
---
Uh. I agree with you man. I was referring to whoever downvoted you.
---
And the second dev comes in, slams his hands down on the Paladin card discussion table:  
---
ARE YOU NUTS?! ...We can't let Paladin see the light of day. Make sure every card in the set actively works against every other one for them. And give them the murloc explorer then make the other Murloc synergy card unplayable with him just to screw with them harder.   
---
Meanwhile, back at Warrior:  
---
Let's also make it a mech. It's not like it'll be put in a deck if it's too costly, so this'll never be a problem, right?
---
I have a feeling these phases are a symptom of their design process (6+ months in the future) and insufficient testing.
---
They think that after the newest unreleased set goes live, a class still needs more support, so the next one gives even more support to something that is decent. And if they really mess up, they'll do it for the third set too.
---
This is my theory on why Shaman got multiple sets of extremely good cards during Shamanstone.
---
Sure, but this is better than the average mech, and will improve the quality of the pool.  Also two 3/6 rushers is pretty sweet for a random generation
---
Taunt
---
&gt;I don't like playing the game, I just like opening packs
---
Thanks for that pal.
---
You are either trolling or really dumb, i cant tell
---
So, assuming we don't just wanna sacrifice Dr. Boom on the altar of balance, what can be done to make Control Warrior slightly less oppressive?
---
I think it could be possible to make a small change to Dr. Boom himself which could help. Delivery Drone could be "Add a random Mech to your hand" or maybe even "Draw a Mech from you deck", to make it much more important to build for mech-synergies. 
---
I wouldn't cry any tears if OmegaLUL got a nerf either. Less Attack, maybe a mana raise.
---
Just play standard control warrior. They are the longest games and very steady and consistent.
---
\+4/+0, shield, taunt for 4 as an alternative BoK maybe.
---
Mech Hunter is only relevant if Mech Warrior is relevant, because Dynomatic wrecks other board centric-decks. Similarly to how Mech Paladin is only relevant because of how hard it crushes Warrior.
---
Zilliax and Snip-Snap will still see play, but that's it. And that would be super boring, because a weaker warrior means stronger Murloc Shaman (which can run Hagatha! which actually comes down with enormous tempo on the board) and that further wrecks Mech decks. Believe it or not, Warrior is actually fine, except for having the best 1 drops in the game right now.
---
1. The DKs have rotated so comparing it's power level to them doesn't make any sense or free it from nerfs
---
2. Comparing boom to rexxar is not it. Giving all mechs rush is top 3 best abilities among all DKs period. Take away the death knights and you're left with something way higher power level than anything else. 
---
The fact that people complain when they get the deal 1 damage to all enemies (aka enemy board wide jaina ping, the "worst" one) is telling. Every single boom hero power power creeps another hero's hero power and they are mere extras to the broken passive. Zuljin is one big swing turn in a class that tends to struggle to get to late game. Hagatha has ONLY a passive and can easily get your hand clogged with trash overload spells.
---
This card is the primero example of blizzard going too far with "flavour". This 7 mana card starts doing its work as early as turn 6, and gaining 7 armour for 2 mana is insane, not to mention he's the only hero card that gains 7 armour on play for no reason. Yes... He's a 7 mana "do nothing" the turn you play him, which is practically no issue for warrior who has a very easy time clearing the opponent's board, and the rush effect means you can quickly start regaining tempo next turn.
---
Yup. On the pic i attacked with alakir, but other minions have also 1 atrack.
---
Thank you, I'll give it a go! :)
---
Seems like it’s your opponents fault for not clearing a mech with a full board
---
Thanks for the kind words. Just to clarify, wouldn't my review system be more favorable for something like Hadronox because it considers the long-term impact as opposed to the immediate lack of support? 
---
That said, I remember being super wrong about Hadronox, I thought it would always be way too slow.
---
Could you get reborn minions from other classes? Like the warrior taunt reborn minion? Or is it coded in a way where only neutral/rogue class reborn minions can be generated? Anyway, its really good.

Hey, I appreciate that you actually took the time to read my post - most of the people responded addressing points that I really already addressed. I do want to say that I 100% agree with you about Trump being an awesome content creator, and seemingly a pretty cool guy too.  I wouldn't have cared to write so much if I didn't like his content.
---
I think you're ultimately right in saying that there should be some balance between the two systems, and it's also important to remember that ultimately Trump is an entertainer so making risky calls on the effectiveness of cards makes sense, especially if he can justify it how he does.
---
You’re right the second body being pingable is a big deal, however being a whole mana cheaper than belcher is also a big deal. Also I would say this is definitely on par if not better than tar creeper (at least for aggressive decks) as you’re getting that +1 attack on your turn on top of the extra “Deathrattle: Summon a Tournament Attendee” to protect your smaller minions.
---
If you like that , see the rogue card
---
I've got 1.5k just from not buying packs for a bit

It feel like reddit is where the teenagers on facebook migrated after their website turned into the nursing home of the internet. Now almost every sub have people using cute pet / handicaped familly member / random feelgood story to get those sweet fake internet points, at least on facebook the people seeing those kind of post were relatives so I can understand why they would give a fuck but the people on reddit are random internet strangers, it's baffling to me to see those post reach the front page ever day.
---
And bomb warrior only wrecks it when the paladin doesn't play perfectly, or when the bomb warrior has an amazing draw. 
---
At high level play often the best play for warrior is to hold onto one wrenchcallibur charge, an elekk and two clockwork goblins, to attempt to OTK after thr first 25 damage. Then the paladin uses his second banker to shuffle in an extra banker and the warrior's OTK isn't viable anymore.
---
Well yeah it is probably better described as a discounted sludge belcher. But sludge belcher is the best taunt minion in Hearthstone so don’t sell this minion short.
---
Neither do these? Wdym

I like how people here (to paraphrase) basically say "It's not spikeridge steed" to imply the card is bad. As if spikeridge steed wasn't an absolutely bonkers OP card with an insane powerlevel.
---
A card that's a good deal worse than spikeridge steed can still be pretty good in the current meta.
---
Thx, i hate it.
---
Also, it's a mech. So this thing is going to have rush. Twice.
---
Aggressive decks loved Tar Creeper because it was so efficient, being one Mana more expensive is quite a tax. If this card were a 3/6, it would be broken, but that's what would make me think it was more on-par with Tar Creeper.
---
For defensive decks, that -1 Attack relative to Tar Creeper is the "deal breaker" that puts it out of the running for me. It doesn't trade up with Underbelly Angler, Coldlight Seer, Warleader, or Dread Corsair, SI:7 Agent, or Lifedrinker, or Eternium Rover/Clockwork Goblin, or Ursatron. That is a lot of 3 Health minions that can come out by Turn 4 that can attack into this without dying compared to Tar Creeper. It also means Titanic Lackey will protect a minion entirely from the first or second body of this one. 
---
It's a strong card, there's no denying that. But in the context of Zilliax's existence and 3-Health being a valuable (though not necessarily definitive) health total for a taunt minion, I don't think it compares as well to the two Neutral taunts we're comparing it to.
---
We'll be able to see based on if it sees play in ~17% of decks. That would be Tar Creeper's deck-inclusion rate. My guess is it will be more like Saronite Chain Gang; respectable, but not a default.
---
Amazing statline, 2x of in all my rogue decks. Also has some inconsistent synergy with [[Underbelly Fence]]. This will see play in all non-miracle Rogue decks until it rotates for sure.
---
The issue is - you could play Beneath the Grounds/Fal'dorei Strider on curve. This card will be useful only in the late game (or mid game if you got your class legendary on curve and you go for DR value gameplan).
---
TOO SOON, EXECUTUS!
---
YOU HAVE PLAYED THE QUEST TOO SOON!
---
Ok, for everyone relating this card to a Mogu Cultist deck: I am pretty sure that Togwaggle's Scheme is way better to make that deck work and I doubt that you would run both cards.
---
This card is meant to be put on high-cost/impact minions. Leeroy looks like the prime target for it, as someone already mentioned.
---
Remember when Rogue's 3 card board clear sounded bad (4 mana 3/3 that gives poisonous to Pyromancer + 1 spell).
---
You can literally chunk your opponent from 42 over 2 turns with 6 cards now - Myra's, Leeroy, Prep, This, Prep, This.
---
Any neutral heal effect that is printed in SoU and the next expansion will have to take into account this degeneracy.
---
If we can get this down to 1 random card into this card in shaman that would be sweet.
---
“We believe Warrior should be focused on defending itself through taunt minions in addition to its normal removal, not just endlessly clearing the board.”
---
Leeeeeeeroooooy JENKINS
---
The cat is a rogue card womp womp
---
Warlock atleast has had good cards for Zoo, Aggro
---
Don’t forget the hof’ing of divine favor which killed all potential for aggressive paladin strategies.
---
Same as how they give rogue great payoffs for playing control but zero cards to actually play control with
---
Because it would see zero play if printed at 2 mana.
---
Can you guy please stop saying "rotated to Wild", every card is part of the wild format the moment it came out, saying rotating out of standard make much more sense. Sorry for the nerd rant.
---
&gt; but in terms of synergy/mechanics (to make money).)
---
Yeah the game was definitely more fun when you just put the objectively best minion for each mana slot in your deck, and every deck shared the same 25 cards. But then Blizzard had to fucking ruin it by improving the game, making decks diverse and making decks more complex than just playing cards that have a green border.
---
Fuck Blizzard, they make the game fun just to make money.

---
Is anyone in blizzard reading this thread?
---
If I have a board full with minions and one of them is [[Spirit of the Dead]], and I give it this rebort spell to the spirit, and the opponent cast a boardclear spell (example, Twisting Nether). Will the reborn Spirit of the dead shuffle in all my dead minions, including the original spirit I casted this spell on or will it not shuffle at all?

With 2 cards left? Yeah no way paladin will be even playable. It would have to be dr boom levels of powerful to make up for all the unfinished and outright useless cards we have been given this expansion.
---
At least this being a paladin card it would have made the quest maybe useful if the other 2 cards were also reborn minions. But no, let's give pally a bunch of random shit and not make any of it good enough to even consider building a full deck around it.
---
Yeah first impression is that's a Belcher reprint. Slightly tweaked stats but made up for by the cheaper mana cost.
---
Nope. It is run because its flexibility. Mostly for cycling. 1 attack bonus on Hoarder doesn't mean jack shit for an OTK deck so might just run Thalnos for flexibility of having 3 damage consecration once in a while.
---
Except when standard became a thing cards like Malygos had always been unplayable or meme, but there has been some metas since then when a Malygos deck was a serious t2 deck.

[[Myra's Unstable Element]]

She said "Well Played" every time she froze ny minions or destroyed them.

Geez not every card that is good and sees play needs to be nerfed. Zilliax is one of the best designed cards in a long time and is really REALLY fair. The card definitely doesnt need a nerf and most certainly doesnt need to be in Hall of fame.

5/-/- | Draw the rest of your deck.  
---
Interesting thing to note is that it doesn't say friendly minion, so you can shuffle enemy minions into your deck, too
---
fine i'll just go back to magic arena then
---
Blegh, second Shadowstep. Well that complicates the combo slightly.
---
I would assume so just like giving two ancestral spirits so it would basically spawn two minions with 1 health
---
As much as I would love this... He won’t be.
---
Like what? The only one I can think of is evil recruiter and plague of flames, which may not even be run in zoo considering you have to give up you board which you spent all your resources building. Most of the cards seem seem to be leaning towards midrange, with the quest trying to push plot twist warlock, a control deck. Sadly, I have a feeling that warlock will continue to perform poorly. But we never know!
---
I think you forgot to prep the Shadow so you could Prep + Shadow on Ra as well...
---
If you manage to go into this turn with a loot hoarder on board that you can trade off, you could end the turn with 4 Ras!
---
Idk how easily most decks can just set up a board to deal with 18 damage with charge...
---
You would play the combo in fatigue though. It’s simple...
---
Play your first Mogu Cultist
---
Play 2 x Death’s Shadow on the Cultist
---
Wait til next turn...
---
Draw and summon 6 Cultists
---
Play your second Cultist and summon Ra
---
Boom! 4 card fatigue combo in a class w Myra’s
---
You could add faceless or banker for more shenanigans as well.
---
Name one.
---
That's what I said: it needs a high-mana minion on board; I didnt say it had to be yours....
---
Then again: if you're copying your opponent's minion something probably went wrong and you're making a desperation play. If this card is in your deck then it will be because it aligns with your win condition and you dont want to copy something from your opponent.
---
But dont worry: we'll see some Trolden clips where this play will actually win people games.
---
Unless it works in the same way as Twinspell does after being cast and loses the keyword on rebirth. Though I don't think that would be the case.
---
Guess I'll use it on Zerek. Could be fun.
---
Like?
---
I dont think rogue has improve any...it sucks as usual
---
Oh yeah I loved OG shudderwock too but he was game-breaking in a literal sense. Glad he got patched
---
Druid recently too, the heal, gonk and treant  archetype
---
It would be more a last ditch effort to win the game than an OTK if you used Myra's unstable element the next turn after this with the idea being to hope to get 3 x Leeroys and sap( if the enemy has taunt)/eviscerate/etc.
---
If your opponents holds back multiple taunts it's  easier to brick than Nomi, yeah. But that also means you have to deal with fewer taunts the rest of the game, on the final turn you have full Mana to sap/evicerate/whatever and you often don't need 24 damage so you can run 1 Leeroy into a taunt.
---
Though thus definitely isn't a (competitive) primary win condition. Similar to Nomi in that sense, not sure if there is a meta where you ever run both.
---
Yes but anka and mechatun are dead cards in your hand, these are playable regardless of the situation
---
&gt; I'm not sure why you continue to call my stance superficial, when I have provided rich descriptions of why murlocs flavorfully do not match Paladin and you have not contested them.
---
You can come up with a rich description for something even when taking a superficial view of it. It doesn't make the description accurate just because it's detailed. And I've contested them repeatedly by explaining exactly how Murlocs match better than any of your other suggestions.
---
&gt;But you still have yet to explain why murlocs feel right in Paladin.
---
Again, I've explained this repeatedly. They're small and weak on their own in a way that makes sense for their tribe compared to the others which need a lot more diversity in their size and abilities. They make one another strong when played in a group which highlights a major aspect of Paladin's identity in a way that other minions and tribes don't *because* of that aforementioned need for diversity.
---
You're clearly just ignoring things now to the point you're  claiming I never even refuted you and making me just repeat myself so I'll end it here, but the only problem here is that you're taking such a dim view of identity that you're inventing reasons to be upset with the game.
---
&gt;true. also why so cartoonish?  
---
they didnt release marrowgar on kotft for this? disapointed  
---
shame on u blizzard
---
Reborn wouldn't stack, no. That's why this says "after your opponent plays" and not summons.
---
Thank you!
---
He rates cards on how frequently they appear in the meta. Meta defining cards and cards that are tent poles in tier decks are 5 stars. Cards consistently played in lower tier decks are 3, or if it’s a really rare and/or poorly performing deck: 2. 1 star cards are cards that see no play or almost no play in the meta in which the set being reviewed is the most recent. 
---
If priest sees no play or almost no play in the meta at *that* time, they are 1 stars under this system. 
---
It’s his review style. You can disagree with it, but this is how he does *his* reviews. I think it’s the best way to do it.
---
I think this works similiar to twinspell, after minion with 2 reborns dies it comes back with 1 hp and 1 reborn less.
---
At its worst it'll be an 8 mana 1/1 when it gets silenced/sapped.
---
You might be right. I was probably expecting them to carry a new version of Miracle Rogue.
---
Yes.. lol
---
Doubt it will happen. They've been censoring cards now to appeal to wider audiences.
---
It wouldn't necessarily burn them. By the time you can get the combo going, you probably wouldn't have much cards in your deck and hand.
---
You'll probably keep 7 cultists in hand with a prep, shadow of death and mira.
---
At the end of the turn, all you got left in your hand is mira and you only put 3 cards in the deck. If your deck was empty before getting the Ras in the deck, you basically win with Mira unless you're up against a class with lots of armor.
---
Loved the monkey island reference
---
It has been confirmed that it does not stack by Peter Whalen. It's like Taunt, Divine Shield etc.

Even with the big misses, I don't think there would be nearly as many people convinced Trump is terrible at rating cards if they understood how his scores worked. Probably the biggest meme in that regard is "One star because Priest won't see play" which is the perfect example of how his system works.
---
If you play this you have to self damage
---
They could just say ‘deal 2 damage to yourself draw 2 cards’
---
Hi people, I wanted to get some likes so I found a boring game of mine and wrote some words here. Hope you guys give me a like.
---
-“You’re a moron and I am not one.”
---
-“Raise CC to 5/6.”
---
Pick one.
---
Yes, he makes some mistakes, but Trump is actually impressively accurate. 
---
People don’t watch him for mistakes. That’s bullshit. People watch him because they value his insight and find it interesting.
---
Ah shit, here we go again
---
Same seems pretty good already
---
Nothing. I've been playing since early beta and this dude is wack.
---
Depends on if Reborn can be stacked, though in theory it should. Reborn as a keyword is effectively a specialized deathrattle, simply shorthand for "When this minion dies, summon the minion again with health at 1 and the Reborn keyword negated." The way it's described, it's not the same minion returning at one health, it's a new minion being summoned with a new condition of 1 health and Reborn negated. So... \*In theory\* it should stack like you can stack deathrattles on any other card, and work just like casting \[\[ancestral spirit\]\] twice on a single minion. 
---
But hey, Blizz may have other ideas on what's logical.
---
I just cant believe so many people are still playing it. Like, what is wrong with them? Do they enjoy it? Are they that desperate for gold?
---
As a F2P your golden cards are much better dusted if they're useless.
---
No, they won't get nerfed and you won't get your dust back, because if they're useless, they're not going to get any attention.
---
Only keep the golden cards you will consider using in a deck. Sure, you could craft any legendary for a dusted golden one, but if it gets nerfed or hall of famed, that's a lot of dust.

2/-/- | Give a minion "Deathrattle: Resummon this minion."  
---
No need for sprint probably. I think the card text for shadows will be like all cast when draw, and therefore include draw a card. After myra, wait a turn and win on your next turn or play a novice engineer and win on the spot... Maybe
---
I play wild too and find it more fun, but come one, the decks arent that diverse
---
1 mana card generator that passes the vanilla test and potentially gives you another class card. It’s gonna see play.
---
I think they were asking if a minion could be reborn twice if it has reborn naturally while this is in play.
---
Oh yeah, that combo that’s identical to stormwind knight + pws instead of just playing Nomi, brilliant.
---
i'm hoping so, but I assume paladin was meant to be weak this expansion. Either that or we somehow missed a combo that will make paladin t1...somehow.
---
You're right, it SHOULD have that functionality. I would fully expect it to actually.
---
10% times 100% is 1000%. Blizzard pls nerf
---
The true question however is “can it keep up with a high rolling big priest?”
---
Luckily they have all these health gains and board clears lying around so they can easily play control.
---
Taunt Warrior just got rather solid support. This guy comes up really late, but you get at least two Fen Creepers by playing this card, which would be not great, but annoying to deal with. Hitting a single buff effects on this guy, though, makes him almost into a Bog Creeper, well two Bog Creepers, and that card was almost playable in Standard and pretty nutty in Arena. Hitting more than one buff effect seems insanely powerful, so this card will at least be experimented with. This guys only problem is that he would have to sit in your hand for a while, so he receives handbuff effects, and comes out at turn 7 at best. Taunt Warrior will probably survive against aggro until turn 8, but this might be too slow against Mage or combo decks.
---
They are both useful statistics to to know. I mention that in another comment.
---
Sure, I'll check him out.
---
For those saying this is bad, think of it like a [[Time Out]] that protects your minions as well as your face and then shuffles another one into your deck. So it probably wouldn't have a place in a tempo oriented deck that wants board presence but more into a combo deck that just wants to not die.
---
Tell that to Zilliax....
---
If you take zilliax away there would be very little change in the meta. Genn and baku were HOFed because the majority of top decks revolves around them. Most decks today would be find without zilliax he’s just a fantastic complimentary piece.
---
Back to the office!

i think a rating system based on net value is not only statisticially easier to maintain consistancy (card A's stats are better than card B so card A is better), it also is more valuable for rating your entire collection. Trump basicially just rates these cards for the upcoming expansion and which archetypes he thinks will see play, which is completely void when the next set comes out. if you apply this to your entire collection and then the new set aswell its easier to see which classes or archetypes might hit the sweet spot of enough inherently strong cards or lose the most from rotations.
---
I KNOW for sure though, I can see the future...
---
wait, the only vision im getting is that the mother of your children, and the mother of my children...
---
*is the same woman!*

Your opponent eventually needs to deal with Tar Creeper. This is more like Frost Nova because the opponent can wait a turn for the Taunt to go away.

It improves the pool as a whole though.

3/4/2 Beast | At the end of your turn, deal 1 damage to all other minions.  
---
There is a pretty neat combo you can pull off with rogue but i‘m not sure if rogue has enough control to support a combo deck
---
BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE TAR CREEPER THO
---
This card is REALLY powerful with the new Rogue Legendary, Anka the Buried. It's a late-game plan, but cheating out a 6 to 10 mana Deathrattle with Anka, then playing it and Shadow of Deathing it, means later in the game you'll get full-size Deathrattle Minions for free. And, of course, you can Prep this card too, and you can still even use:
---
(1) mana Deathrattle + (4) Shadow of Death + (5) Necrium Vial, so you get tempo now AND later.
---
i already know that this Card discovered by eteral lackey will decide to many games
---
That isn't correct. If we are talking about empty sets, we aren't considering possible elements, as we don't know what that is like. For example the set of numbers lower than 0 but greater than +1 is an empty set, and there is no way to think about possible elements. It gets really unintuitive too and messy because that could raise different standards for different situations. The "from false everything follows" is true, but not the full story.
---
Consider this. The negation of every true sentance is false, and the negation of every false sentance is true.
---
Also if you say that every element of set A has property X, then the negation of that sentance says that there exist an element of set A that doesn't have property X. See how that will always be false for an empty set? In an empty set, you can not provide a counterexample to anything, so again, every member of an empty set has every property.
---
Pogo! Many other options too, but Pogo!!!
---
Sunwalker is 4/5 Div Shield for 6.
---
Gotcha, pity.
---
If Control Warlock is good...we’ll see.
---
One big taunt can soak up 6-12 of that damage, so it's definitely not super consistent.
---
RECURSION
---
It’s a reference to the WoW boss fight too!

---
I posted the flavour text in the stickied post as well. Great flavour all round.
---
&amp; Underbelly Angler
---
I actually play Warlock mostly, Warrior is boring af for me.
---
I read that as "At the start of the game, shuffle this minion into your deck." and was confused until I reread it.
---
I agree. The downside of not being able to stick on curve is a big one, but I dont think it's impossible to imagine this seeing play in that deck. It'll have a hard time finding a spot though.
---
yeah that's what I was thinking but usually if you wanna stall like that you'll usually want to not draw it again later when you need things like your combo pieces but maybe it's good enough in something like control shaman.
---
Even longer games for control warrior..
---
I like the flavour of the cat giving you mummies and cats make sense as Rogue cards, but it's slightly weird to have a reborn mechanic like this for Rogue as of now. 
---
1 Mana 1/2 is okay, the beast tag won't matter, but it might help that it replaces itself in your hand, if handsize matters in Rogue. It's also a good combo activator for 1. The reborn pool has some big variance, you can get the 10/10 colossus,  a puny (but probably more tempo) 1/1 Murmy or something in between. There aren't many class specific reborn minions, this might have been interesting in Burgle Rogue otherwise. I don't think this will be put into decks.
---
Psychopomp isn’t a reborn minion, it rez’s a minion with reborn.
---
i dont understand what is the crazy interaction?
---
But it's hardly valuable information or a difficult call to say "*If* Zoo sees play, Evil Genius will be a great card in the deck." Anyone with more than a basic understanding of the game should be able to come to the same conclusion.
---
Meanwhile, until the card does see play (if it ever does) there's no way to verify the accuracy of the rating. What's the point of applying scores that often can't be measured?
---
Why do people still try to push some kind of copycat Priest? it has never and will never work because the class has no support for it. Rogue has cards to support that archetype, Academic Spionage, Spectral Cutlass, Underbelly Fence, Vendetta and Tess Greymane as a Finisher, the only thing priest have is Talanji, and you need to hold your cards in hand and go all in leaving you with no resources as a backup.
---
Yep. You would charge pre-nerf molten giants for free and then panda them and play them again. 7 mana 32 damage combo
---
Would you play a 4 mana frost nova that shuffeled itself back to your deck. I probably would!
---
There are a lot of 4 drops that are bad against a board of giants. Lotta 5, 6, and 7 drops too. Doesn't make them bad cards.
---
Well, the big cards that you get frustrated at, are the ones that finish you off, not the ones that get microadvantages in the game or even massive ones like Boom does...
---
Cards like Crystology, Boom and Master's Call(this is a bit of a lesser extent), are often underrated in terms of their power level because they aren't the cards that beat you in the way that Leeroy(maybe this is OP, arguable), Edwin(not OP, only situationally good and we're in a BGH tech meta), Zul'jin, Devastator, Brawl, Holy Wrath, CC and Kangor's Endless Army do.
---
Boom instantly gives your Mechs an ability that gives them an average of 1 mana's worth more than they usually have(depending on the card), apart from those which already have Rush. Each of its hero powers is pretty damn good, with Delivery Drone being amazing. The ability for Warrior to easily generate Mechs makes this effect even stronger and this effect often decides games
---
Warriors have a much higher winrate when keeping a 7 drop than a 4/10 drop in Devastator. Boom has one of/the highest(haven't checked but used to be the highest in both) Drawn and Mulligan winrates, and it's a 7 drop. That says enough about its power, the topic about its nerf is debatable but I'd say it needs a slight tone down, not huge since it's carrying Control Warrior, but big enough to allow Control Warlock, slower Druids, a slower Paladin deck(that isn't combo) than Mech Pally(midrange) and maybe a slower Priest. Any nerf to the card would help with a slower Shaman, but I think that may just be good enough after this new expansion. The other 4 have no chance because of Boom though...
---
Boom is unhealthy for the Control sphere in its current state, it needs at least some change, as it's too useful of a tool in every single match-up and wins games by itself...
---
The nerf must not be big enough that it kills Warrior, though(as much as I hate playing against it.)
---
"shadows" is ambiguous. They could even be silenced for all we know.
---
Tar Creeper is way better than this card.
---
Myras has been dropped in rogue since the last nerfs
---
Before disenchanting you should have an idea of what the dust is for. That is, you want to be crafting cards for decks.
---
Golden legendaries are tokens that can be redeemed for the legendary of your choice. Getting trash tier golden legendaries is great for this reason.
---
Unless an epic is being played in the meta I would almost certainly disenchant it, if I needed the dust. When deciding to dust cards you need to take into account time as well. By disenchanting early you get more time with the cards you craft. By waiting as long as possible you maximise your dust. Personally I think it is better to be less efficient with your dust and value the time you get to play the cards you craft. Waiting to get non golden epics before you disenchant them is only worth it if you would actually put the card in a deck.
---
If you can't build a good deck cause you are missing staple cards, then dust all your golden. You will have way more fun when you can play with better cards.
---
I would not keep betrug as the only deck he is played in is very expensive. I doubt you are close to building that deck, however if you are, and want to play the deck then keep him.
---
Don't forget you can use hearthstone deck tracker with hsreplay to find out what decks you can build, and what you can build using different amounts of dust.
---
Oooh shit. 
---
Screw Dr. Boom Mad Genius &amp; Omega Assembly
---
Pretty sure not even talanji is necessarily useful in those types of deck, she is used mainly with the priest shrine and bwonsamdi to draw all the 1 cost cards shuffled by the shrine.
---
You could always follow it up the next turn with a Mass Dispel.
---
hes not predicting whether itll see play ever, hes just rating the card in a vacuum. if the specific class or archetype never gets good in the 2 year rotation then even a 5 star card could never get out of meme tier.
---
The moment i read conjured in the name, i thought it's a conjurer's calling in a stick or another CC support.
---
Silence + Lackey + Coin = permanent 3/12 Taunt minion on turn 4.
---
Obelisk is better at hitting minions and bypassing taunt, leeroy is better at hitting face and removing specific threats.
---
From my experience playing a version without Faceless, (haven't put in Tirion, not sure if that's the right choice) and 1 Lens, I still crush Control and Bomb Warriors...
---
Most of my losses are from really bad RNG. I'd estimate I win at least 2/3 of the time, my guess is 3/4. It's a midrange deck, so it's favoured against Control and if you can pilot it well, it's good against aggro too. However, its worst match-up is Shamans, which I'm sure make both you and I want to die.
---
FREE FROM THAT BLASTED TAWARRRRR
---
Silence was another option I thought about, especially since last set had a lot of silence cards. I dont like it since priest has no draw without major drawback.
---
10 mana Baine, Shadow of Death. Not a terrible play.
---
Actually YES.
---
Definitely a unique card and one that could find a place in control decks quite well
---
It’s neutral.
---
&gt; Or taunt warrior provided it keeps hand buffs.
---
That only happens if it mentioned in the card text, like with [[Immortal Prelate]] or if you have an aura active, like [[Crystal Core]].
---
If your deck is empty that's the same thing.
---
Neither, had no idea what to put on the title, "fun" seems more appropriate.
---
That’s why it has 2 Health when every other card to ever exist with a similar effect has been a 1/1/1.
---
The academic espionage of the expansion.
---
Ok, true.
---
It just seems like the answer is no :/

5/-/- | For the rest of the game, your minions are 4/4.

Wait till deck empty, cast this on king krush, next turn summon 3 king krush for 0 mana
---
There's definitely a different mentality with Trump where he reviews the meta as much as the card itself which I often disagree with (eg "good card but X class won't see play so it's a bad card) 
---
But I enjoy his reviews a lot
---
Congrats ;)
---
What do the characters in your flair mean?
---
&gt;straight up better variation of Witchwood Grizzly
---
If Witchwood Grizzle died after a turn, and didn't cost your opponent any board or health?
---
I think that any deck that wants to go long could run this if there exists any room. A decent play on any turn against aggro and a good play vs control when your hand gets full. I really like this card
---
How is it condescending? Newer or less competitive players might not be aware of the potential of certain effects, but most players who play regularly or at least somewhat competitively can typically understand potential. When such a large number of people can recognize that, it doesn't do much good to devote your entire scale to such a vague concept when more detailed, measurable metrics are possible.
---
If I remember correctly in China they have a “no cult” rule. Bones are heavily associated with cults there so it has to be changed.
---
Can work with lens in an aggro deck.
---
Frost Nova specifically gets better with more copies, and odds are if you played one you'll want to draw another. Arcane Intellect into Frost Nova is a fantastic late game play. 
---
Playing this back to back for a few turns means your opponent either starts attacking it (negating its downside) or stops playing minions (giving you a massive tempo boost and even more time). However, the fact that it only stops 10 damage makes me think it won't hold up unless mage gets a great combo deck
---
The company isn't going full China. The art changes were made to appeal to children, not Chinese. This art change is one of the few in the game, and they're usually relegated to the Chinese only client of the game.
---
It's also neutral

Looking to trade 80g quests. I'll show my quest, you go first.
---
Not quite sure I see the anti-fatigue value.
---
Fatigue is only relevant in control matchups. And in those matchups, well, your opponent will simply kill the minion before it's your turn again. And then it's dead.
---
I think it's great that silencing it has a downside, as well as an upside.
---
I agree with this but your judgement of Standard is wrong IMO in some ways.
---
Priest has Nomi Priest and Silence Priest
---
Mech Paladin hit Tier 1 I think a few weeks back and has consistently been Tier 2(got Rank 4 with it last season.)
---
OTK Pally is Tier 2 I'm pretty sure but it's in meta for sure
---
Zoolock is in meta and I think it's Tier 2...
---
Mage and Warrior both have as many decks as Paladin and Priest, Druid has one(unless you count Heal Druid)
---
And yeah, I love that you can play Control Rogue, gonna play a wacky Mogu deck next exp...
---
And Combo is better represented because Blizzard hates combo decks....
---
Rotated Naturalise when Mecha'thun, kinda Togwaggle and Hadronox(not combo) were the only ones that really used it, nerfed Equality(only 3 decks running it were Even Shaman which was rotating in 2 months, Shirvallah and Uther OTK Pallys), nerfed Wild Growth when only Hadronox(again, not combo) and combo decks(Malygos, Tog, Mecha'thun) were the only decks using it, nerfed Saronite Chain Gang simply for Shudderwock(honestly, Heal Zoo was weaker than Odd Rogue and Odd Paladin at that time, it wasn't for this, and they could've nerfed Keleseth) and now also Vanish(less significant and Mind Blast(super significant getting rotated. In addition, they rotated Ice Block, printed cards like Saboteur and Hecklebot etc. All this shows to me that Blizzard doesn't want combo decks in Standard, but can't show that by nerfing OTK Pally, as it's not Tier 1..
---
This sort of only leaves OTK Pally as a combo deck, and I guess Luna's Mage. OTK Pally is mainly draw and a few strong Control-combo expansion cards, Luna's has a combo with Alex and Tony but in general is just a bunch of minions that can benefit from the buff, CC and a Cyclone package.
---
The ongoing censorship in this game is so depressing... I am actually considering not to preorder because of this issue. Poor little secret keeper..

This will be the new Myras unstable element meme deck, get the shadow of death in your hand, Myra your deck away. Next turn Mogu shadow shadow and then next turn fill your board with cultists, shadow step mogu ra win.
---
Or something.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk will never be able to keep up
---
I can't agree with old Dr. 7. Now blastamster summons sometimes 6 bombs and it is not considered THAT busted. Back when there was less busted cards and combos, I agree that boom was a very good card. But now, "very good" is not enough.
---
Play  this in priest turn 4, silence it for 0 mana, next turn double divine + topsy/inner fire = *insert cropped rank 1 legend*
---
You don't even need to kill the Anka. Just play her with Mecha already on your hand before you unleash your combo.
---
Seems good with the rush lackey too, that's 4 damage to a minion and leaves a taunt behind
---
This is really nice design and seems strong too. Will definitely see play probably in Wild as well. Gonna be funny to see rogues evolve their miscreant into this card too with the evolve lackey.
---
What warrior deck would ever flat play this, lul
---
Just wait till theres like a neutral legendary that has a battlecry: grant a friendly minion reborn on a prelate/undatakah
---
Are you hiding your 2 Nat Pagles, 3 Chamelos and 2 Lorewalkers behind the history tab?
---
""Strictly better" status is not dependent on creature type. More generally, such comparisons between cards are made independent of any particular board state. Therefore, because of the sheer number of possible gameplay circumstances, for any given "strictly better" card, there is typically some imaginable set of circumstances in which it is, in fact, inferior to another card that would otherwise rank below it. This fact implies that a "strictly better" card might be more accurately termed "typically better", and that distinction sometimes confuses newer players. However, "strictly better" is well understood among experienced Magic players, and is the prevailing description of such a relationship between cards."
---
Before anyone pitches in and says "THIS IS HEARTHSTONE, YOU DUMB MUPPET", be aware that most of the terms in modern CCG's originates from MtG and should be used in the same context to avoid confusion in my opinion. You can continue being pedantic because that's what literacy expects you to be, but I will continue describing myself as a dumb Muppet even though I haven't even lived in Sesame Street.
---
If you had to assign specific animals to each class, you wouldn't choose domesticated cats for Rogue? Putting aside all things like Cat Burglars and such, they are stealthy, elegant animals with a hidden vicious side. I can't think of more fitting animals, except arguably snakes.
---
&gt;You clearly don't play rogue.
---
I've hit legend with miracle rogue and have over 1.2k rogue wins in ranked. Even if doubting the number of rogue games I've played, instead of actually trying to understand the points I made, was a good argument, it wouldn't hold.
---
&gt;Well statted one drop which can activate your fence/vendetta on turn two is super powerful.
---
I see you only got as far as the first sentence, so I'll restate the second one: "The only rogue I could currently see this being slotted into is burgle rogue".  
---
I'm not arguing activating burgle cards isn't good, I'm saying you don't play this card in miracle - or autoinclude it in any rogue deck for that matter.
---
&gt;Even has shark/waggle synergy &amp; can easily be bounced to activate combos &amp; generate even more value.
---
Shark is garbage by any measurable criterion. Bouncing cat and generating value is useless, you could just play good cards and win instead (note that I'm not saying cat isn't good).
---
I really thought this would be a paladin card. I thought giving a good minion reborn and then coping with emperor wraps was the value they were going for.
---
But that's not the stated goal for the vast majority of reviewers, and it's also a terrible way of determining what you should craft or disenchant. And reviewers like Trump already mention this kind of potential and future cards to look out for even when they end up giving cards low scores. You don't need a score to understand which cards have potential and which don't.
---
&gt; it's not awful  
---
It is awful
---
The only Hunter card making any list is the new Secret if you are playing Secret Hunter. Maybe the pack.
---
No other cards make a competitive list.
---
Doesn't break it, the text is just a bit misleading, it shuffles copies and then buffs those copies while they're in the deck.
---
Bruh. Try again
---
u/_al1s4er_
---
bruh 💯💯🙌🙌🤣
---
Get the new 10 Mana reborn legendary off this lmao
---
i wouldnt go that far, it being legendary and often the only out to heal out of lethal range for many decks makes it kind of volatile if its top 15 or bottom 15 in your deck, but its definitely a fair card.
---
Two commons coming only. Underbelly Angler is a rare and the other effect you talked about is also at least rare or epic. We might get another common Reborn minion, that's like a 2 mana 2/2 or 3 mana 3/3 with reborn.
---
This is a card that goes into a tempo deck, so more often than not, the 10 mana legendary is also a bad result. That's like 20% of the reborn pool so far so it's not insignificant.
---
Who is*
---
Also, that's a hilarious name and cool art, card ain't bad either. Why haven't I seen this before?
---
edit: checked the comments, nevermind. At least somebody actually put the expansion mark on his fake
---
why 2 health
---
It's still uninspired but it's a lot better when you can at least choose your random card.
---
You can’t run that card without Rush minions in your deck.
---
Not really comparable to gang up as it isn't really adding cards to your deck, since they are 'cast when drawn'. It is more comparable to beneath the grounds or whatever that 4/4 anub thing was called that shuffled spiders
---
Oh boy 1 mana card generation. Can’t wait to see this in every rogue deck.
---
The mech part makes this next level strong.
---
So who will be doing the reveal instead of Toast later today?
---
Yeah but it'll suck if they're forced to play average neutral minions instead of more powerful class cards, and 7 is quite a lot. You have to dedicate a big chunk of your deck to completing the quest
---
Regis states his goal as reviewing a card’s potential, so that’s his review philosophy. Some people (myself included) enjoy this approach. I also like Trump’s approach. I see value in both.
---
Yet
---
If you can get Ra then use this on it after myras it's 60 damage next turn.
---
If he has he hasn't really spoken about it or reviewed it with his audience whatsoever.
---
Not necessarily. Even if he or someone else perfectly called the eventual meta, that doesn't mean it would take shape immediately.
---
This is exactly me LUL
---
Well you could always follow up with silencing their minion that's been given Reborn, or even use it as a bait for the 9 mana Plague card.
---
The amount of times I have gotten ridiculously excited for a card reveal only to realize it's from /r/customhearthstone...

4/1/7 | Your minions trigger their Deathrattles twice.  
---
I really feel like this whole expansion is cards for wild with some few random junk tossed in for the standard players, cause I actually love this expansion so far.
---
ancestral is a lot stronger because it gives the minion full hp back compared to reborn which is only 1 hp and has no deathrattle synergy.
---
Of course man :(
---
Except these cards are fair while Big Priest is bullshit
---
gift of the wild helps plus Milligan for forests aid
---
They're summoned though...no battlecry. They wouldn't even make future ones better as it's pogos played.
---
Zero, on paladin? That would soft lock a deck with no buffs.
---
Hunter hand size is not an issue. Any Zuljin deck is going to already be running Unleash Beast, and either things like Dire Frenzy or Secret Plan.
---
Hunter Pack is not as good as people want it to be. The class needs better tempo, card advantage is not really needed right now.

---
Interesting take. The more I thought about it I think your right. Against aggro I feel like the opponent will not kill into this and just let it shuffle back.
---
Why do you don't pick arcane explosion to your deck?!(lich king)
---
Yeah cause playing uber greedy decks should have zero downside
---
NA 80g trade, WildFire#1309
---
Then again, if the copies work like the ambush cards, you wouldn't need Myra at all since they draw themselves. So once your deck is empty, you get the copies and you win next turn. 
---
It's not an absolute OTK though.
---
I guess you could use Myra to either draw your cultists or to empty your deck once you got all necessary cards in hand.
---
In the end, it's true, it's just a matter of perfect draw and staying alive.
---
The cards getting outclassed are control-style value generators. In the early stages of Hearthstone, Malygos saw play at what was essentially a vanilla 9 mana 4/12 with a situationally powerful side effect. You put him on board and hope he stuck a turn for your spells to kick in. 
---
In that function, Malygos is completely unplayable in modern Hearthstone. The reason he has a place in Standard is because he enables OTK combos, which often run cards that are completely crappy as a standalone card.
---
Combo elements aren't really judged by mana efficiency as much because they are often literally the only card in the game who can give you access to certain effects.
---
Hunter. Whatever it is. hunter
---
SneakyTurtle#180327 ^ sorry misspelled
---
surely in a fatigue matchup players will prioritize killing this
---
I think people are underrating reborn, if reborn decks are a thing then they'll 110% run that 2 drop that heals adjacent minions to full
---
With this it's unlikely to have the 2/5 AND the extra 2/1 die on turn 4 and the following turn you can follow it up with the heal dude and at that point you're doing really good
---
Just frostbolt, it's that easy
---
Plus a sap!

---
Yup, frost bolt's always reliable. Too bad you have to be lucky enough that you even have it in your hand.
---
you are an anime protagonist
---
Silence also removes the taunt though so it becomes a standard 3/10 minion that costs two cards and four+ mana.
---
Yeah it's not really a fair comparison. Whenever people talk about zombeasts they imagine big lifesteal taunts but in reality they weren't always that big or frequent. When rexxar came out he wasn't that good, it's only when his beast pool was changed did he see a lot of play. I guess what I'm trying to say is that last year certain mechs didn't exist for boom to utilise. For example, omega devastator
---
It dominated in unicorn silence priest, Brode Jr beat Kripp with it
---
Nice Killer Instinct reference.
---
That's what mulligans are for.
---
When you play a greedy deck, sometimes you have to hard mulligan for removal. It's called being realistic
---
And of true, makes the artstyle changes all the more insidious
---
I would say probably 7k
---
Idk but so far this has been my favorite card printed.
---
Pyromancer as well
---
The effect is a drawback to balance out the very high stats. You couldn't pull off a Divine Spirit/Inner Fire combo because you won't ever get to attack with it since it get shuffled into your deck at the start of your turn. Silencing it removes the taunt but also lets it stay to attack with.
---
Not true. The Shark totem works on Pogos when it specifically says it only activates battlecries twice. I don't see any reason this wouldn't work. And either way, you have plenty of options to get them back into your hand/deck.
---
I know ?
---
Yeah it's also mostly just against decks that get in the way with cards like taunt that are an issue but warrior has those AND dumb amrour gains
---
Fantastic design on this card, I think it will see play, especially in priest that needs that stall to get to the turns they can actually do stuff
---
Definitely right. People are exaggerating this card to the extreme.
---
The core cards of Buff Priest, [[Zerek, Master Cloner]] and [[Test Subject]]. Getting any minion to stick in this deck for [[Extra Arms]], especially with [[Radiant Elemental]] and [[Kabal Talonpriest]] in Wild is insane. Also has great synergy with the new neutral Neferset 2 Mana 2/3.
---
i guess the easiest way to make a highlander paladin viable, is buiduilg around the upgraded hero power being your win condition. first, choose the cards that can make you draw faster, so you can consistently find sir finley.
---
cards as cristalize, loot hoarder and that 4 mana draw spell + monter will  be in the deck
---
with that in mind, to take advantage of using your hero power every turn, you will need heal effects / taunts and removal.
---
with those 2 main packages in place, you can choose your alternate wincon and use the remaining slots to place it.
---
buff cards, mech sinergy, deathrattle synergy, burst otk. you choose.
---
if you have any deck build right now, mind to share? paladin is the classe i most play, and i´m not very excited with th cards shown by now. (i have around 4k wins with paladin)
---
100% agree. Zilliax is cancer
---
Someone has been reading Solo Leveling.

Good call, and this is neutral!
---
Any class with strong board clear or combo could consider this when building
---
Those days when a 2 (!) mana 1/2 novice engenier that does draw a card was considered overpowered and therefore nerfed to 1/1.
---
This indeed. Anyway the fanbase of toast should include a lot of ex hearthstone TFT player. Which is actually a damn good reason to give him a reveal. This way some ex HS player can be granted some attention for the game again.. Stupid complainers..
---
Reeeee
---
I'd like to see you handle a whole community spitting acid at you blaming you for all of their problems. Tell me it's not a big deal when that happens.
---
I feel like they don't want to pick a class identity for Shaman, Druid, Rogue and Priest.  If a card comes along that is OP they give it to Druid.  It is has a random effect they give it to Shaman.  If it is bad they give it to Priest and everything else goes to Rogue.
---
Reborn Reborn Reborn Reborn Reborn
---
I'm an idiot, I originally created my post for the card reveal in another language a little earlier. I failed to realize it shuffled itself and not a copy.
---
The 1/1 reborn would be one of the better pulls off of this. It's a combo activator and another sticky minion to push dmg
---
I have time for wild games
---
Maybe as a one of.  But that's a really high value card to close out games, as opposed to playing redemption
---
Pogo would be ok but only if you can return it to your hand because battlecrys likely won’t go off.
---
Because in this instance, the secondary details are important. At one time, Toast was a major Hearthstone streamer. As of now, he is burned out with the game. He doesn't find enjoyment in playing the game anymore. These card reveals are meant for the community to get involved with the game. Toast is no longer part of that community. As such, giving him a card to reveal is both insulting to streamers who are still supporting the game, and to the community in general because Toast is, probably, no longer affiliated with Hearthstone anymore. Also, of course Thij is not going to create drama over a card reveal. It does him no favors in complaining about it. All it does is create bad blood with Toast and more importantly Blizzard. Regular players/redditors can complain about it because there is nothing at stake for us complaining. We aren't connected to either streamer or blizzard, as such nothing to lose, only gain by calling out unfair practice.
---
I have every card on EU, just in case someone doesn't have a na alt account. But that's not hard to do anyways.
---
This card, treachery, plot twist??? Sounds really good
---
You can use Desperate stand on reborn minion and it will be cooler than reborn
---
Well you also just spent 4 mana to gain no tempo while your opponent has a really strong minion in play
---
Those are auth servers, shared among all Blizzard games afaik.
---
This card looks strong @10 health.
---
So many Gruul
---
Kind of like Time Out for paladin
---
Cake day
---
Lol I'm also not a twitch streamer that makes a living by literally being a public figure.
---
&gt;a whole community
---
Lol jesus christ it was maximum 1 or 2 hundred people on this sub. Oh no, poor Toast! Even he has 1 million+ Twitch subs and makes like $800K a year by being a streamer, a few guys on reddit were angry that he didn't get a card reveal! This community is so *toxic*!!!
---
Usually control decks want to draw their cards not shuffled ones, if you play this on curve from turn 6 onwards you will have to draw an additional card to keep up, that kind of effect straight up lose you the game most of the times. I don't think the card can't find a place but you need a ton of draw to support this, something like the warlock quest, but I don't this is a tar creeper that had a huge presence in the meta.
---
When is the final reveal stream?
---
This card in wild with Sylvanus or Kelthuzad would be mind blowing.
---
I don't mind really. Had you not responded I probably would not have noticed. :) 
---
It does seam that Activision is banking on China to save their revenue with ever diminishing numbers... and that's a big fuck you to everybody else. It also gives an even more pronounced feeling of how marketing guided the development of this game is. Even the buff update felt marketing driven.. instead of trying to help weak classes and improve the game, they concentrated one set to make it sell better.
---
[I'll leave this here](https://youtu.be/1wsdWAWQqdU) and hopefully people will eventually stop bitching about the whole Chinese censorship shit.
---
I respect your opinion, but there are quite a few I personally will want to craft lol. I for sure want:
---
Dark Pharaoh Tekahn
---
Sir Finley of the Sand 
---
Untapped Potential
---
I think if the Lackey generators are strong enough that Tekahn will be a monster. Finely is just fun looking. Untapped Potential has... potential. That's all I'm saying lol
---
Yeah, it's weird, people keep celebrating new years at the wrong time...
---
super bad. 5 8/8 used to be good when power level is way lower but now it doesn't make the cut.
---
Which is really just card draw, albeit from a limited pool, to technically be defined as a tutor it must search your library for a specific card. 
---
Masters call can be used as a tutor although, in Joybuzz Hunter it is used to search your library for Jepetto. 
---
So maybe I’ll disregard my earlier statement.
---
I get your point but it's kind of a misleading statistic. Krakens, Mammoths, and Ravens aren't tribes but Dragons are. So of course there's always going to be more dragon cards printed than any other particular species.
---
Come on, why Chris Sierra? He doesn't add anything to the stream
---
Well put.
---
Might as well play regular control warlock with the mecha'thun finisher. Token decks don't do well late game and having cards like Godfry and defile in a token deck really fucks you over. Also having Soularium in this deck is way to risky because if you end up drawing your core cards with it you're screwed.
---
If you think Spikeridged Steed saw more play in standard than Sylvanas did and Gadgetzan Auctioneer has, you're wrong.
---
In wild, the same is valid this day. Spikeridged Steed is one of the best cards in arena ever, but that was mostly because you could get 6 of them before brackets were a thing. It does not equal the other cards in constructed.
---
Ooo you can even draw it for 0 Mana with the Quest
---
Not to mention mechathun priest! Experimenter+crasher+ 2abominations was terrifying the day 5 boomsday meta
---
So you're defining tutor as draw 1 specific card from your deck? Like tracking?
---
Oh no! This children's card game has a mummy with two heads in it! We must ban this game as the occultist propoganda it is, before it infects the children!
---
I like your design more. Not OP IMO.
---
Good against aggro -- you can drop this and you either freeze your opponent, or it's a 3/10 taunt for 4. Frost Nova for 4 is probably not great, but it's not the worst against aggro. Hopefully you have a clear to back it up.
---
Good-ish against control. It offsets fatigue or eats hard removal.
---
Probably bad against midrange. Bad against combo. Bad in combo, since you want to draw your combo pieces instead.
---
Freaky, and I likes it.

9/8/4 | Deathrattle: Return this to your hand and summon a 4/4 Nerubian.  
---
So your telling me, what rogue got in this expansion is merely another combo enabler and a sticky minion.... No synergy with deathrattles nor archetype.
---
Your shitting me bro...  rogue finally has a one drop but rogue will fall farther out of the meta. All we are gonna see are more warriors, and now secret mages and battlecry shamans. And your telling me rogue got a "cOmBo EnAbLeR &amp; sTiCky MiNiOn" or I pull the 10-drop reborn that sticks in my hand until I'm dead.
---
Blizzard proudly announced:
---
"Powercreep: The Expansion"
---
Yeah and the problem is that you need to have a minion stick on the board for it.
---
Otherwise BoK would be one of the best cards in Paladin while in reality it was usually not played
---
You got it in the wrong language dumbo. You can’t battalgia when you’re gonna giocate.
---
No
---
How is this a frost nova?
---
Micheal scott*
---
Sure he can be wrong, **but he can also actually be wrong.**
---
And even better, **he can be right, too.**
---
His star-system for rating Hearthstone cards is utterly practical. It's an actual objective metric that you can use after-the-fact to compare with pre-release reviews.
---
Another reviewer might say "Anka is a five star card, amazing depth and ability to combine with powerful, expensive Deathrattle minions to create insane combos or just cheapen those really powerful effects. Like Jepetto and Shudderwock [both who I absolutely also rate five stars], Anka is a card we'll keep revisiting every expansion to look out for new combinations."
---
Now, what I just said is not inherently *wrong* at all. I personally think Anka, like Shudderwock and Jepetto, are the kinds of cards you'll keep heartily in mind as every set cycles through, thinking "How can we use *this* with the new cards?" I think they're *amazing* design.
---
But in the end, it's also just as possible that Anka 'the five star card' never sees anything beyond Tier 3 play. Even in his *entire* time in the Standard rotation.
---
There are two "problems" with Trump's reviews, and the both stem from the fact that he evaluates based only on the immediate meta following the card release. He does not factor in:
---
1. Subsequent card set releases. For a card like Anka or Shudderwock, this is extremely important.
---
2. Not so much a problem before, but now Team 5 spicing things up with buffs and nerfs, and being much more rapid with nerfs, means that the reviews tend not to last the entire card set release.
---
For the sake of Trump's reviews, I say "problems" quote-unquote because Trump can't actually do anything about these points when making his reviews.
---
However, maybe some content he could make in the future would be to go back and reevaluate certain cards in the current or upcoming meta? 
---
I just decided to go back to Trump's reviews for Boomsday, and [you know what he originally gave Zilliax? 2 Stars.](https://youtu.be/gqzdm3OeplA?t=3466)
---
Even that was well-off by being 5 Stars. Zilliax was seeing play in just over a third of all decks eventually, beating even Fire Fly (~25%) or Tar Creeper (~17%).
---
And now, with the rotation over half a year later, Zilliax is now ***seeing play in over two thirds of all decks.***
---
Somehow I feel like his 5 Star re-review of Zilliax doesn't do justice of just how much more powerful it is even now than compared to release.
---
Yeah but I just want to make a mur'thun deck and warlock got randomly selected
---
Everything is bitching to you isn’t it
---
Paladin main here, can confirm! Very high thinker
---
I don't really see the point of rating cards individually when the rating is based on whether a top tier deck uses those cards or not. A card can be very strong (like Hagatha's Scheme or Never Surrender!) but just not fit in any current deck. If you're going to rate cards based on decks why not just make a video about the set as a whole and try to predict what the new tier 1 decks will be and what cards they'll use if that's what you're basing your rating on anyway.
---
Players: Will **YES!** Paladin get more synergy?
---
Blizzard: Way ahead of you there buddy
---
Just shut the fuck to. Nobody asked for your opinion.
---
AFK is actually the perfect counter because there is no way to kill Tak
---
Why wouldn’t it
---
Lol just use double Eviscerate
---
yup
---
It stops minion damage for a turn.
---
I say sub out galvanizer for loot horder
---
Clever. I'd add more murlocs though, so it's your plan A.
---
I always liked the idea of these cards. but with how tempo oriented Rogue is, I find it hard to use?
---
I like it because its Choose a Minion, not Choose a Friendly Minion.  If you could figure out a way to Shuffle a strong enemy minion into your deck without losing too much tempo, you could get some fun outcomes.
---
I wouldn't craft anything for it, but if you have the cards you may as well try it and find out.
---
It was downvoted after he cancelled his reveal was around 800 upvotes I think when I saw it

4/4/4 Mech | Battlecry: Gain Stealth until your next turn.  
---
Technically no they haven't. I'm talking about actually naming the Spell, not just having the same effect. Otherwise we could go back to the Basic Set and say Elven Archer casts "Moonfire."
---
Lol dude read her card text and then delete this comment.
---
That sounds like a sensible nerf so I highly doubt Blizzard would go for it.
---
Not *bad,* but the high variance between 1 mana 1/1 and 10 mana 10/10 will make this card feel... not so consistent.
---
Cool, it's finally there.
---
Yes!! This news just made my HS day!
---
&gt; Just because something isn't entirely new doesn't mean it's 
---
&gt; inherently bad or boring. The vast majority of abilities in every set &gt; can be argued to be variations of older abilities.
---
I am in no way attempting to say that any of these things are bad or boring.  I also intellectually understand that their approach to things like Quests is mechanically different this time around.  
---
What I am saying is that the set lacks the *feeling* of something new and exciting.  I like callbacks a lot, I just prefer that they are mixed with more "new stuff".  Most sets dangle something shiny in front of you and I get this feeling like "I can't wait to play with that!".  This set leaves me with a feeling of "I've already played with that....."
---
Raiding Party Rogue was arguably the best deck in Wild before the nerfs (and certainly better than Mill Kingsbane Rogue) and it didn't even run lifesteal.
---
O shit.
---
You don't really want to silence your creatures the turn you play them. It's much better to silence them during a turn when you can actually attack with them. If you play this and silence it, any removal is a 2 for 1. It's kind of like playing a creature and playing Blessing of Might or Blessing of Kings on it immediately.
---
I'm not saying that this is terrible in Silence Priest, but this is a very serious drawback.
---
No. I clearly intended to ruin everybody's card reveal (which I could have enjoyed as well) 12 days before it should have happened because I'm such a criminal mastermind. The card will still be in the expansion  so what you could do ,instead of complaining inside an old post, is wait, you dimwit.
---
I'll take a 30-40% chance of activating other class synergy on turn 1.
---
the sign says no ~~Homers~~ ~~Millhouses~~ Dragons, we're allowed to have one  ~~Millhouse~~ Dragon
---
*Millhouse Manastorm intensifies*
---
That's why I said "technically," since it was prior to the Standard/Wild split.
---
seems ok if you are running fatigue and need to block damage/stall a turn, but it won't see play and is basically useless
---
Around 24k :P I always buy between 60 - 90 packs and save the rest
---
NICE
---
I feel like 4 Mana may be too much to pay for something that may not have any significance for a couple of turns after it's played.
---
The only 5-drop currently warping the meta is Loatheb, because it keeps Tempo Quest Mage and Big Priest in check, the two decks actually warping the Wild meta.
---
You have to silence this the turn you play it, or it shuffles back into your deck at the start of your turn....
---
you know... we cant have nice things cuz people keep complaining... i want another kotft or k&amp;c power level expansion, cuz all this cards since the witchwood are just... not fun
---
Silence priest has some buffs. It's very hard to call anything for priest, since only 1/2 their cards have been revealed.
---
I know it's just a comparison, but it's much worse than frost nova.  
---
If your opponent can't clear it, they don't attack so the 3 attack means nothing.  
---
If at any point you draw it and they can easily clear it, since it's just a minion, it also kinda does nothing.  
---
Frost Nova's value is that it's reliable. This card is more expensive and frankly not that reliable for anything really. Doomsayer is much, much better because it's cheaper, has better toughness on curve, and actually threatens your opponents minions so it can't be ignored.
---
Fatigue hasn’t mattered for years at this point.
---
Idk what decks are going to be good or not but I know for sure that I will just continue playink lucentbark druid. Maybe with the quest
---
-sigh- we're going to have to deal with this a lot-- aren't we?
---
Well, it's not because of the card itself, it's because DisguisedToast said that he wouldn't have revealed the card many days ago and they didn't update the reveal calendar accordingly.
---
They made a lot of people wait for no reason, and they knew a lot of time before. Unprofessional.
---
I agree it's probably not exactly what you want, but as a pull off a 1/1/2 minion it's way better than getting Totemic Might off Swashburglar.
---
Well yea because shamen counters it by have class silence effects.
---
I learned very early that dusting anything other than golden versions or extra cards is a bad idea all you get is diminishing returns. I can make every single competitive deck in wild and standard and all I've ever bought are the expansion bundles and that's it. I even took break from hearthstone after Un'Goro and came back in time for boomsday project and I've already gotten my collection back in good shape.
---
Potential Nasty two 5/8 with taunt and rush on the turn after Dr.7
---
My point was that this *is* new stuff. Like with Highlander cards. There were only five cards so far in the game's history that had this kind of condition. Pretty much anything they do with it is guaranteed to be different as a result, especially when it's part of a meta with completely different sets.
---
It just seems like you're ruling them out because we've had Highlander cards before, but that seems kind of arbitrary in regards to how old or new a set should feel.
---
If you're running sunfury protector on that deck you're doing something even more wrong.
---
As far as I know it has not been confirmed. Reborn looks like the kind of keyword that would last a single card set, one they're not too intent on constantly revisiting.
---
However, they may revisit it in the last card set of this year since all card sets of this Hearthstone year are "tied together." Not unlike how they're adding a Lackey and Lackey generators in Saviours of Uldum.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing some more Reborn next card set. It's an interesting keyword and one that the Paladin Quest *requires* to be completed. So some additional support could be very useful and justified.
---
The two ideas also aren't necessarily both true for all people.  Given Toast's massive viewership I thought he gets a card, of course, despite not much caring for his content.  But Thijs not getting one was a goddamn travesty.  Its not like there isn't a card from the card dump they will have at the end that they could have given him.
---
Give a link to some of the alternate art or you're spewing bull
---
Give a link to some of the Chinese art or you're spewing bull
---
How is priest Evil ;(
---
Give a link to some of the censored Chinese art or you're spewing bull
---
They usually keep keywords within expansions, at least ever since Lifesteal was introduced. So most likely not, unless they plan on the final expansion of the year being a combo of the first two where they have Reborn, Lackeys, and Twinspell Cards.
---
But the Year of the Kraken *technically* didn't have that card. The Year of the Kraken was Whispers, Karazhan, and Gadgetzan.
---
Daniel and The Cooler Daniel
---
100% agree.  This needs twinspell or needs to cost 5.
---
No that is anubisath warbringer, which is a clearly terrible card :/
---
Anubisath Defender is a 5 mana 3/5 taunt which reads "If you've cast a spell this turn, this costs zero."
---
It is basically like a better version of the 4/4 elemental which got played in all the druid decks.
---
But you have to silence same turn, which means you're spending the silence on a minion that may just get removed. Witchwood grizzly seems a lot more useful.
---
Tunnel Trogg also says hi.
---
Warlock cards need to be severely nerfed due to lifetap. Can you imagine a murloc shaman with life tap?
---
I mean there was Mechathun or Zilliax. Also Elysiana. There's more. They are also more flexible since every class can use it and tinker around with.
---
Toast seems to react more to what people say about him than other popular streamers.
---
Blizzard posted a "reveal video" for this card on youtube a cuple of hours ago for some reason, this guy probably didnt see this card when it was revealed so he thought it was a new card.
---
&gt;Does anybody know if the "Shadow" cards have a mana cost attached?
---
[Shadows cost 4](https://youtu.be/FSDzW0ZTtuA?t=107)
---
tunnel trog was a class card and didnt gain health, hes was a really dumb card, but it doesnt even get close to the og insane 1drop
---
Except Direhorn Hatchling isn’t good against aggro. If you’re playing a 3/6 taunt on 5 you’re probably going to die soon. 
---
This card lets you stall into turn 5, where the control classes often have board clears. 
---
This card isn’t direhorn hatchling, it’s its own card. It’s good against aggro, and potentially makes a control matchup better
---
Yeah, in control vs control you have dead draws of removal. You also have dead draws for tools against aggro. That doesn’t make it a bad card.
---
Since some people at the time argued "why not rush over charge"
---
The issue was hitting minions, not the marginal 1 or 2 face damage. It's "I play a 3/2 with upside, my opponent plays southsea and trades in patches" that's a lot of tempo for only 3 mana.
---
Kind of reminds me of Doomsayer in terms of stalling a turn.
---
Honestly not as crazy as you may think.  Hand rogue is pretty off meta, but there are enough cards that generate cards or draw cards that you can curve out with board development into a mountain giant on 4 or 5 or a really beefy twilight drake.  Furthermore cards like the trickster or tanglefur mystic give a decent (if inconsistent) chance of getting a class card to activate a vendetta for all those times your blink foxes or henchclan burglars are hiding.
---
That said, yeah, hand rogue is not a tier 1 deck by any stretch.
---
And they hide it less each time, too.
---
Each reddit post is not a personal offering to you.

This card kind of scares me in Pogo Rogue. That deck is almost viable and having a powerful stall tool like this could be what pushes it to the next level.
---
I was planning on doing it as BM but he dipped
---
you had the stream on right?  Did u just yolo the knife for the memes? Or you did u want to just skip the krip?

&gt;  I was trying to make a control warlock/handlock list work and it just didn't have enough survivability. 
---
It just means that you failed. I often heal back to 30 with my Warlock decks, courtesy of Sn1p-Sn4p, Zilliax, Countess Ashmore and Summoning Portal.
---
Yes I agree but he often had to be BGH'd
---
Can you imagine the look on that guy’s face when four patches jumped out of his deck turn 1
---
A good way to find out would be to start playing the game a bit and decide for yourself if *you* like it.
---
It's worth it for people who like it and enjoyable for people who do. We're all different people tho ...
---
Learn to form an opinion on things for yourself would be a good way.
---
Do I like it ? Yeah ! Do some other people dislike it or don't care ? Also yeah !
---
beer's 2$ in here (at decent bars nonetheless) so =&gt;  3\*4 months actually\*2$=24$, I prefer going out then support activision world domination schemes, thank you
---
Really cool design. I can envision a world where the drawback is too strong for general use, and most decks are okay with holding off a turn for auto-removal. But I can also see a world where you effectively just spam 4-mana 3/10 taunts with more copy generators, maybe this is actually the stall tool rogue needs to make its control payoffs work. Or maybe you just run this as is in a control shaman list since it curves perfectly into most of your mac daddy AoE removals. Or you run this in silence priest for another cheap big guy. Or maybe a 4 mana 'hold up' early game is just good enough. Or who knows, it's a cool effect that I imagine might find other uses on a really overstatted taunt minion, I think this will definitely see a lot of play early on for experimentation, and it might turn out to be great and stick around or he might just vanish out of our decks as quickly as he vanishes out of play.
---
What do you mean by slower? You can play myra’s on turn 9, and combo on 10
---
Yea that definitely 100% didnt happen
---
Gotta start from turn 1 as burn shaman
---
u cant say any of thos eas an actually high power level. u cant compara any of those to rogue quest, any of the dk, or for example the warlock weapon, or voidlord, or cube, or saronite or stonehill defender.  
---
yea some of those are good, but they are not high power level, or interesting at all, except restless mummy and the 7 mana shamam clear.   
---
thosoe cards are medium to high power level, mostly medium, theres nothing interesting or exciting.  
---
Also forget the sir finley, any of the no duplicate decks are fated to not see the light of the day cuz bomb warrior
---
Things get localized but the source stays the same. When the source is changed for the American market just to sell things, I think that is wrong as well.
---
Disenchant some garbage cards and Craft Whizbang. you will have a lot more decks to play
---
The ones that are left are not human skulls
---
That guy's body language is intimidating. 
---
Good this isn't a kids game, oh wait ...

---
At first I thought it meant “shuffle a copy of the card to your deck,” got a bit confused till I checked the comments
---
Upvoted because you had golden Runespear.
---
Meanwhile, there are magic players who would die to go to Ravnica for the 4th time :D
---
I wonder how often these will be like 5 in a row of this same card
---
You have bested me.
---
I could swear i've heard the flavour text as a verse in Philip Glass's opera Akhnaten, not as cat-like obviously, but pretty nice!
---
Read my comment again, The first two rows are quotes, first one from top comment, second one from you. You agreed for some reason that the combo is slower and is a 3 turn combo, which it isn't. The top commenter can't count, you can but still agreed for some reason by starting with "exactly".
---
The big problem with Thief Rogue is that all the synergy cards that get boosted by playing cards from other classes are 100% useless in the mirror so it's basically an auto-concede.
---
It’s different when you’re the underdog that got popular. We watched him go from nervous not showing his face to popular streamer that’s throwing jabs at kripp. With any fan base you’re going to have that spectrum of fanatic to the people that miss his old content what drew people to him in the first place. Which will attracted haters as well. Does he deserve the shade he gets? Nope. There are way shittier people out there than the guy having fun playing a game.

Icywind#1337 NA 80g quest trade.

I'll show, you go first.
---
What about the skulls on the guy’s knuckles?
---
&gt; People say this is bad
---
&gt; People don't actually know whether it is bad
---
&gt; Therefore, it is "all but guaranteed" that it will be good
---
You took a big logic leap there between two and three.
---
Very probably the best 1 drop for arena ever.
---
A little late, the event is almost over.
---
Was hoping that since we were crossing to mtg I could then cross to fortnite. 
---
Fruitless effort, oh well.
---
Please, explain for us what that would look like.
---
I swear I read conjurer mage..
---
I guarantee you'll be playing arena, this will come out on turn 1, and your terror will grow every turn as they don't play the generated minion all the way until turn 10.
---
Then cursing. Then violence.
---
Great arena card
---
Found the pleb.
---
How much did you invest in this game :D
---
Oh I completely agree that Taunt is one of the best keywords to pair with Reborn. Heck even \[\[Righteous Protector\]\] should be a good reminder of how annoying it can be to have to use two attacks to get rid of a taunt minion.
---
Basically I'd say the top tier keywords to go with Reborn are Taunt and Rush/Charge (as you say, it's the ability to get double use on the same turn that makes it good). Bottom tier is Battlecry because it has horrible anti-synergy. Middle is kind of everything else (I'd legitimately forgotten Windfury was even a thing).
---
Deathrattle might be good too, although I think Reborn DRs probably pay a premium.

1/1/1 | Taunt Divine Shield  
---
In arena that card is at least fine, and it very well might be straight up good.
---
"Silence a minion then give it Taunt/Rush"
---
Very minor correction: Whizbang is still in for this next set (Saviors of Uldum) *and* the following (December) set! 
---
And then it’ll still be standard-legal until the first set of 2020 in ~April.
---
Frightened Flunky is not better than saronite, is class specific and 2 health is 2 easy to remove
---
Don't forget that there's a pity timer for pack openings now! Meaning that if you never opened a pack from an expansion there will always be a legendary within the first 10 packs. Then after a legendary the timer resets and it goes to 40 packs.
---
Meaning for every expansion that you didn't open packs yet opening 50 packs GUARANTEES 2 legendaries. Since you get 1 from the first 10 and at least 1 from the next 40.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk wants to know your location.
---
Top rp in a card, I love it! And some anti fatigue if they don't respect the stats
---
*YOU GREEDY DIRTBAG*
---
Do you have complete collection?
---
No, this is the circlejerk sub.  If you want to read more serious discussion, go to r/hearthstonecirclejerk.
---
Tbh if I had money to spare I’d have all cards golden, playing with my golden Whizbang alt feelsrichman
---
Congrtz for being rich!! Really impressive
---
I mean I just can’t stand his entitled attitude.
---
He seems like an ok human being but the way he talks to and addresses people upsets me and so I don’t like him.
---
Has nothing to do with reddit.
---
how much have you spent on the game?
---
But he has all the legendaries golden. Which others could he possibly want?

We have technology

Did ya win

Bonus:

The real reason Jar Dealer is important? Jar Dealer predicts Deathwing for the next expansion.   
---
Hear me out guys: 
---
What do Jars hold? Jam 
---
Where does Jam come from? Fruits 
---
Where do fruits come from? Trees 
---
Where is there a lot of trees? Un’goro 
---
What does Un’goro have? Dinosaurs 
---
What are dinosaurs? Reptiles 
---
What else are reptiles? Dragons 
---
Who is a Dragon? Deathwing 
---
Boom, Deathwing confirmed for the next expansion.
---
I know this is a shitpost, but describing these cards as "sexy" is weird.
---
Wait wtf
---
We may have reached peak circlejerk.
---
i don't see what this gets you in arena. at best it sets you up for a large removal turn 5 (starfall? blizzard with coin?) against aggro decks, which are a minority in arena play. and even if you're clearing the board, it's probably better to save the card resource and play a higher value minion that has a chance to survive if they choose not to trade.
---
Not sure how Dane is comparable to Toast or Thijs.
---
How is that op?
---
Oh, its deffo possible, just not who op thought it was.
---
Is this irony?
---
The thing I like about this is that you don't have to go all in on this, it could just slot into Tempo Rogue as a combo finisher.  Play aggressive, keep your opponent on the back foot.  Play Leeroy + Shadow of Death, attack for 6.  Next turn Myra's and attack for 12-18 and have 5 mana leftover for other shenanigans
---
id do set hp to 15 but not cap it probbaly.
---
Saviors comes out in less than 2 weeks and that Reno card is hoooooooooooooooooooooo looking okay.
---
KIPPER#21172 EU 80g Trade, you go first :)
---
Yeah, what's wrong in showing some furry pussy???
---
Yeah, obviously I disagree and find these posts way more annoying.
---
Do you actually have something to say orrr...?
---
Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica
---
I just got Merc 280 11 matches in a row.
---
its such a slap in the face for them to take away cards because they are off theme and make a whole fucking blog post about it and put out random off theme crap for paladin  and this
---
Also rush minions you put in your constructed deck will always be better than a random reborn card. That being said I think this card is still very strong.
---
Yeah, after I said that I went up against them, lost, and now I am seeing a lot more of them. (not that bad though)
---
When you Tess the wock and then the wock casts the Tess it's joyous.
