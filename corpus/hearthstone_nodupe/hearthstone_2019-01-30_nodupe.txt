Amazing isn't it?  The sorry emote still exists and you can hear them with Mayor Noggenfogger

---
15 damage is very, very relevant for a warlock. It’s unlikely that he can answer the 3/4 on turn 5/6 from hand some it’s a 18 vs 8 face damage
---
Yes, so glad he attacked with one of the big guys first.

Revenger#2317 EU looking to trade 80g quest, I prefer you going first but I can show proof. Check my comment history to see my past successful trades.
---
10 is a rank floor, so people like playing jank.
---
Talking about no accomplishment, your mom delivered a child and it turned out to be you? FeelsBadMan
---
still he won
---
Because dungeon run is actually fun to play XD
---
It's the only time it has worked that well for me. I just got it from the Hydrologist, couldn't have worked out better.  
---
It seems it was that good of a change after all...
---
I thought it was going to be good, but it's has been actually kinda boring.
---
(op, you wrote two times 2018, just to let you know)
---
And then you have people complaining about how not listing the person was confusing and a bunch of people in the comments explaining the stuff that would be let out.
---

---
It's part of HS's history, and it was a pretty significant event.  Now if he's gotten better since then I'm sure no one will complain, but it's something that happened, and he has to live with the consequences.  
---
I guess I get a completely different feel from it.  Since this is a series of HS history, it only seems right to include the details as much as possible.  
---
yea this is the only reason I'm not really complaining about it being used again and again. At least it's enjoyable. Some improvements would definitely be nice though
---
Still see play
---
feelsbadman
---
I wouldve snap picked Marin, but thats because I tend to meme a bit too much in Hearthstone.

People doing that in the comments would be fine. A mod doing it in the original post is different.
---
Oh. Do I still get allá the packs?
---
After rotation we will need a millenial one with patches, veteran, dire mole, firefly, corsair, keleseth, flappy, tar creeper, south sea, chain gang, scalebane, leeroy, creeper, bonemare.
---
All true, but his biggest impact was early board control. 
---
L
---
Shoot, thanks. Yeah I just do it cuz its fun, but after so many tries I'd like to win now lol. Don't want to try another hunter til I beat it with Toki, haven't given up yet!
---
I prefer the dust+gold
---
There’s also another spell in one of the buckets that destroys every minion on the board and creates one mega minion with all the combined stats. I already used mine earlier in the game but it could have been useful for later, as an answer to obvious lethal on Toki’s side. Keep an eye out for that. It’s called Amalgamate
---
But that's ridiculous. Oh that game's only going to be broken another 2 months, why bother fixing it. Because hunter's broken and rexxar doesn't rotate for another 2 months.
---
If the intent is calling out and encouraging witch hunting, then yes.
---
In this context though, I will strongly disagree with you, as this is one of a series of posts about the history of the game rather than something along the lines of "Hey yeah this guy did a thing four years ago"
---
Wow i think gilneas is sufficiently protected now ;)
---
Okay. Like who gives a fuck about wild though? This was possible in standard anyway for a bit and it wasn’t that interesting then either. 
---
If there was a way to make it work in standard after the nerf then I would be interested.
---
Because I’m tilted 
---
but why, whats the benefit of that system. I understand how what i'm suggesting wouldnt be feasible for time and complexity reasons, but elimination brackets would give the players the same amount of playtime, they still get their hours, but because there are less players streaming at the same time we wont have a situation where popular streamers such as Firebat and Kibler are sitting on only 500 viewers, the viewerbase wont be as spread out on different channels. And it would be easier to follow for viewers. 
---
I think it is still worth a mention in a mechanics focused glossary, as it does help to describe a set of minions rather than having to say "the pool of the minions which have died this game". 
---
the chest heaves

Damaged golem has always been a 2/1 from what I recall

AMazzing#1566 - 80g trade NA
---
I might be seen as cute or otherwise attractive, yes. But you will always be seen as repulsive and vile. It makes me happy, since i'm sure you wont be reproducing. Makes for less ugly and stupid people in the future. Have a nice night jackass.
---
In arena?
---
No, in hunter you go for raptor hatchlings. In priest you can go for plated beetle.
---
It's interesting that you added the shark belt buckle halfway through iteration.
---
I understand if you can't talk about this, but did you know that Rogue had a Shark motif before drawing her art?
---
No worries.  there is a sale now 30 packs (10 of each new expansion) for 20 dollars.  If you are willing to spend the cash.
---
Though it would be fun, I would rather just get more cards each expansion rather then a new class. Firstly, I feel the current nine cover all the bases. And, if we got one more legendary for each class (or, they could just stop printing trash, example Dr Morrigan, and just print cards for already exciting decks that desperately needs them) then so may new decks would be possible. I really loved gimmick decks like Freeze / Evolve shaman but they are barely playable 
---
Hijacking top comment to inform those who may not know that if you enter “artist:Dixon” into the in-game search function it will show all the cards that Matt has done the art for. Make sure you filter for “All cards” or you might miss some of my personal favorites (Wickerflame Burnbristle and Finja!)
---
So do Argent Squire, Novice Engineer, and (somewhat) Defender of Argus.
---
&gt;but those of you who play ranked know what kind of a net-deck aggro fest it tends to be.  
---
Cute how you single out aggro when that's quite far from the truth in recent times.
---
Stopped reading once the bias was obvious.
---
How is that going to make money for blizzard though?
---
Sounds african to me
---
Isn't keeping a Google docs excel a pretty efficient way to go for real time results?
---
An hour long video ... I'm definitely going to watch that!
---
&gt; While they can argue that these cards were unhealthily good in so far as they were so often played, removing them ramped up the number of new cards needed each expansion to stay competitive. This is not a neutral change.
---
Except they gave full dust refunds for the hall of fame cards, AND you get to keep the cards as well.
---
I have an amazon fire tablet and sometimes even prefer playing on that rather than my computer. 
---
Agreed. The fewer cards one has from those sets the more value they are getting.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
How do we feel about only getting one golden card for these events? Always thought it comes across a bit miserly. As someone who plays Arena I like getting golden copies of bad cards. 
---
Nicholena had the best individual score with 12 - 12 - and 7-2 didn't even get to finish her last one. Very impressive.
---
There was no other 5-drop until Naxx came out ^^^NaxxOutBTW and then you just added Sludge Belcher.
---
While i agree that this card was broken i wont agree its straight better then Polymorph, because in 50% the opponents "sheep" was a 5/5.
---
I think the most important difference between the prenerf-tinkmaster and cards like polymorph or hex was that the tinkmaster is a neutral card and can be played in classes that had hardly any good removals at that time like druid.
---
what a win condition
---
No that’d be so broken. God I wish it was 2/2
---
Seems marginally better not to clean your quest log on February 2, but to start saving your best quests now, things like the 100g or 80g quests so you can carry them into February 5. 
---
This is a lot of feedback, so I hope I cover everything in enough detail. Three great suggestions on the new terms, although burn needs disambiguation. AoE is better defined by your definition. Alternate win condition is a barrel of fish, and I didn't know I kicked a hornets' nest. I am going to deal with that one later, just because people are entrenched in both camps. Virtual card advantage considers the quality of resources, when value is considered. Fair point, on soft removal Aldor Peace Keeper and Dark Conviction are good examples. I think I need to get a better word to describe the relation between mana costs and stats. 
---
How long can this go on
---
Forgetting [[Ticking Abombination]] which is an asymmetric aoe but only your side 
---
Followed shortly after by "first times"
---
Looks like concrete for some reason lol. I'd like to see this as well though. 
---
Congrats OP, and also I applaud your patience to pilot a control deck to legend

Who/what is team 5

Try to avoid casting kill command before Zul'jin.  
---
If you have 1600 dust in Mammoth cards that you don't use you could look at crafting Rexxar, but he will be wild only in April
---
It's very well done, captain hooktusk is my favourite cardart out of the expansion
---

---
At the end of the month people play wacky stuff. I saw a Murloc Druid at like Rank 8. Now that’s ambitious.
---
Really? I was leaning towards doing that! But Maybe I'm just using Zul wrong?
---
I don't know what's worse. How much of an ass you are because you dont like a post on the internet, or how you have your head so far up your ass you think the downvotes are for not liking a post.
---
Hmm. Alright! Thank you!
---
Yup, climb to rank 5 in the first couple days and then have fun since 5-legend is a slog. 
---
If the kings bane rogue get its draw cards, Even Shaman is still favored, the core card is Myra's Crystal to literally draw the nuts

If you're going to post quiz questions tonight, could you make the answers less obvious through more complex interactions like Flare and Counterspell or at least post them all at once?

It’s the studio that makes hearthstone, blizzard the developed is split it 5 or 6 teams that each works on their own game.

1 is WOW

4 is overwatch

---
I’m a regular artifact player, and that description made me say “oooo I want to play *that*.”
---
Yes please i am wondering this too.
---
I may be late for this, but I'd suggest a description of deck archetypes. Mostly a clear separation between what people call *Aggro*, *Zoo*, and *Face*. I'd say they're all probably the same, going for strong early game plays and out-tempoing the opponent with lots of cheap minions and face damage. It's just, the existence of different terms for probably the same type of play/deck can be confusing at times; why is ZOOlock called that and noch Aggrolock? And such. 
---
In Patch 9.2.0.21517, from October 2017. They buffed Counterspell such that canceled spells no longer trigger any 'whenever/after you cast a spell' effects.
---
Downvote the post, report the post, hide the post, move on.
---
You're literally just making the sub worse with your shitty comments on shitty posts.
---
Akali’s Horn... the run was pretty easy :p
---
Before rank 10 you are facing exclusively net decks or nonsense comprised of whatever your opponent has in their library.
---
The closer to legend you get, the more frequently you will see unique tech choices, or variants of established decks, or the odd truly unique deck that, piloted by someone who’s practiced it (and indeed designed it) performs at a T3 or even T2 level.
---
You needn’t be concerned with it; just play well and remain curious so as to avoid tilt, which, especially if you’re entering into ranks you’ve never reached before, will cost you more games than anything else.
---
Just expect that, eventually, decks will start to belong to the player rather than the meta. It’s not common but neither is it rare; after a certain point, everyone you encounter is at least good enough to modify, if not actually construct, their own deck. Don’t be intimidated; just because you’re not familiar with a deck doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.
---
Few classes really venture too far from established archetypes, so even if you don’t recognize the deck, you can probably reasonably guess it’s win condition(s) and which techs most likely support it.
---
Play your deck to it’s strengths and let your opponent deal with the tried-and-tested won conditional you’ve brought rather than worry about playing around their arcane wincon.
---
Ah I see, I'm only playing on iOS, too bad.
---
Damn sorry man, I got glass knight and a golden talanji.

Why the downvotes? He is right

Brilliantly done! I had to watch 3 times to fully understand what u did

Reminds me of those drawing tutorials that go "Ok, so you start by just making two circles and a line.... then you draw the whole thing and you're done.
---
&gt; This is why you should never - and I mean NEVER
---
You're taking it too seriously. 
---
Is there a list with the arenascores of all 60 people? which people had the best 3 consecutive runs?
---
but they are able to copy your deck that way? I never knew.
---
But getting to rank 5 is no small feat. 
---
It's free, more casual, addictive and much more stream-friendly.
---
I think it's a fun card, it's the first one I crafted when the expansion released, and I believe it has potential to be competitive after rotation.  
---
Thank you!
---
It’s not really realistic to say no.

Could you not spam this subreddit with your shitzy caps lock questions?

This early in the draft you can pick cards specifically for Oakheart, so here Oakheart is insanely good. And deck tracker is even available on mobile, why would you play without it?

I don't think it matters what I reply. It will get downvoted. I am the enemy of the people.
---
I hope you have a lovely day :)
---
We already have powerful decks that don't run hero cards. There's no reason to think Shaman, Warrior, and Hunter will dominate post rotation simply because they have hero cards and the others don't.

Yeah playing mech hunter often times you get blasted by defile and you cant play around it because of mecharoo.

Tbh this is literally just because of the Arena tournament. If it weren't for that it'd be the Dota2/MTG/LoL after 2 hours of playing HS
---
I’m not seeing an issue

Yah.  Great.  Abused broken crap.  Nicely done.  Your parents will be proud.

Slightly unrelated but I'm thoroughly enjoying turn 1 water elemental with Coin and Next elemental you play costs 2 less
---
I dont
---
Love your work Matt, thank you! Is that a self-portrait you've sneaked in on Sergeant Sallly (top right)?
---
There is no relevant cost associated for Blizzard. Yeah, they need some people to translate the game when they launch it in a new country. But otherwise there are no shipping costs, they don‘t need to build or rent stores and they don‘t need to hire a relevant amount of staff. 
---
Average income in poland for example is roundabout half of the average income in germany. Yet packs cost the same.
---
Can always rely on Thijs.
---
Gratz! I was hoping to hit legend for the first time today, but my power is out :( 
---
twitch rivals stream vods or each streamer streamed on their channel during there event so their twtich channels will have theirs as well
---
How did you get your first art in the game? Were you discovered or did you seek out blizzard?
---
I was going to say he can still OTK with Velen lol, then I saw the second grip xD
---
This just makes me wish I’d not disenchanted a lot legendary cards in the past because that deck looks like fun to play !  
---
I miss Rag too :'(  ^(fuck Sylvanas)
---
Upvote for play. Double upvote for Arrested Development reference
---
How come you all have these cool and insane turn 1 plays? My T1 is usually just pass. Even if there are quite a few 1 drops waiting in my deck.
---
Well, I'd go for double Prince-2 into a somewhat disgusted concede on my part.  
---
Of course there are good decks, but the Death Knights take them over the top.
---
Aggro decks will find a good way to beat them, but in the fatigue game, all control decks would be in a huge disadvantage.
---
As it seems to me they are not pricing based on their costs, so the cost is irrelevant. Again the product is not a polish one it is an American product therefore the premium price for countries who has lower purchasing power. 
---
Same, I always used to buy pre expansion bundles when they were still at £35 but I  can't justify spending £50.
---
I mainly play arena now and get by with the free stuff.
---
yup topsy apm priest was very popular in the meta made popular by dog. 
---
Tunnel trogg into opponent's concede.
---
Thanks for the reminder dude. 
---
&gt; If you open 30 packs you're more likely to be under 100 dust/pack than above it. This is a fact.
---
Yes, but the average per pack is still 100. Image 33% chance to get 1, 33% to get 10 and 33% to get 100. The average is 111/3 even though 2/3 of the people would get less than that. What you are referring to is the median value, but everyone else talks about the average, or the expected value, which is more relevant for buying decision.
---
What a great idea. I'd love to see someone run something similar on the EU server :D
---
My problem is that it's a bit too late, and many ideas that could have been used for a new class, are already taken by other classes.
---
When you create another class in a game, most of the time is not original and is just a mosaic of some other classes. But you can't say this out loud in a WoW subreddit or you will get witchhunted
---
All the casters need to take a break at the exact same time so that you need to have a 30 minute gap in any commentary? I don't think you quite understood the OP's comment, Dan. 
---
The OP wasn't saying that you can't take any breaks.
---
Instead the idea is that every caster gets their needed break, but they don't all take it at the same time, allowing for a continuous feel to those watching the stream. Some casters could take their break earlier, some take it later.  
---
Makes for a much better experience.
---
When I made the jump to digital painting, I took my old brushes and some black acrylic paint and filled sheets of paper with brush marks, smudges, toothbrush spatter and other mess. Then I scanned it all. That was about 20 years agio, but those are the brushes I still use. Most of the painting is done with very simple brushes though, very similar to the Dry Media set in Photoshop.
---
It's because of the +4 spell power
---
Yeah, this is the same dilemma (?) I'm in. I don't really feel like pumping out my hunter decks until April, but I'm not gonna invest heavily into rotating decks in. Kind of a weird spot to be in.
---
It depends on currency. [Rastakhan rumble prices, you can roughly compare this bundle to the first part of the list (bundle #1)](https://i.imgur.com/A7wKx9y.png)
---
Just FYI you can pay in dollars on the US store and it's cheaper. Not encouraging you to pay but if you do may as well save a bit!
---
$20 in US
---
+5 and then doubled, actually.
---
(copying this comment to you to) -
---
No whale by any means
---
And the Velen doubling the added spell damage.
---
I'm guessing the casters said something along the lines of him and Kripp averaged 7 on their 2nd runs as a team (Kripp went 11, Zeddy 3). At that point they were definitely still in the running for a great finish
---
That’s because they have to send the cards halfway around the world
---
I remember rhinkjng immunity can stop this card from killing you and using it at 40hp it hit him only once then killed me
---
to trigger people like you :D and free time
---
I'm not joking btw. 60 packs will cost you nearly $100. It's ridiculous. 
---
because blizzard probably should be charging less in that area but just hasn’t noticed?
---
Oof yeah i forgot it double spell dmg...
---
To be fair, you're minimum wage is more than 2.5x ours. 
---
&gt;Where did you get that from?
---
He wants adjusted price in Euro not because Europe overall has a valid reason, but because of his country.
---
&gt; OP is clearly talking about Eastern Europe (it's in the title), where each country has its own currency.
---
Nope, he's talking about his country using Euro. Not Poland.
---
&gt; Poland we already pay in PLN (our national currency), we just pay the same or even more, depending on the current conversion rate, as we would pay in Euro. We're 2-3 times more poor than the western Europe but we pay more for packs, where's any logic in that? 
---
Now, that would be an interesting discussion. But is different from the discussion of OP, because it's a different currency.
---
&gt;If you aren't already spoofing your IP to look like you're from Brazil, Argentina or whatever, there's nothing in introducing the same system to Eastern Europe that would make you do it.
---
The difference is the people would assume is more difficult to do that because a different currency. Whereas the case brought by OP is same currency, different price tag.
---
Well, I can imagine it's a struggle for you guys, bit still here in switzerland we pay I think 50CHF (more or less the same in euro) for 40 packs and i think thats INSANELY fucking much for a collecting card game with cards tht will be outdated pretty soon so yeah thats why i left hearthstone, its just too expensive of a hobby
---
Shouldn't it be 9 cards? Otherwise you burn the ransom and then you lose your deck abd die to fatigue
---
And having them be 3 health.  He must have had the shrine up, because they should all be 3/2 Chicken/Mastiffs.
---
Sorry used them all up!
---
Can you hit legend rank 1 with sorely charging 26/6 shudderwocks?
---
If you already owned a Lady in White, that means you also owned every other legendary in the set, otherwise you cannot open duplicate legendaries. Why did you spend $20 on a bundle of which at least 1/3 is not useful to you, and then complain?
---
Need shieldbearer to sop up the 3 damage from the meteor, otherwise you kill one of the little dudes.
---
I paid 30 euro for the New bundle.
---
- From Denmark btw.
---
So basically subsidies the poor players? sounds like welfare.

---
Inevitability is a commonly used term to define who's the beatdown in a matchup. I've heard it on streams etc. so I think it's good to have it.

It's called Deck Tracker (or Innkeeper, depending on your preferences). I personally use Deck Tracker because it has a lot of customisation options

I live in South America... everything is expensive.

I don't think Blizzard nor any company cares about how much their product is worth across regions. If it's too expensive for some of us, we are not the targeted audience.
---
&gt; I don't see everyone spoofing their IPs to look like they're from there.

Alternatively, play the quest. No one wants to play against someone obviously insane so they will concede.
---
Why are you here then? 
---
I still enjoy the game and have been for 4 years, with some up and downs of course.
---
But people who think this is a down moment should remember shamanstone, druidstone, undertakerstone, patches/renostone.
---
Compared to the average wage and prices of goods, packs arent that expensive. Take OP's example, a fresh loaf of bread from coles is like $2, about equal to one pack if you buy only two at a time. Our average wage is $1500 a week while his apparent above average is not even that for a month. I'd agree that it seems expensive, but to be honest I think comparitively we get a pretty good deal.

Hello Hearthstone Daily Moments 
---
I’m having Zelda flashbacks. Do NOT mess with the chickens!
---
How did you know ? Was his Dane's opponent live streaming or something ? Because I looked in the video's comments section and no one seems to know what that last card is \^^ .
---
Hunter x hunter ~_~

What is your channel name?

Ill try to put it it in a polite and eloquent way: Fuck off!

Looks more like a Goblin

The concept of a Hero Power is something that's fairly unique to Hearthstone as compared to MtG, from what I know - and it's always been kind of a problem. That guaranteed 2-mana play can be a real challenge to balance, and it gets ridiculous if certain cards exist.
---
Hell, this type of thing is the main reason people complained about Hunter for so long. Because of its uniquely limited Hero Power (with perhaps only Warrior being as weak at a base), it had to be immediately shoved into a very specific type of deck for very long.
---
Well, generally for card games, Hearthstone's pricing model is about average.
---
Thanks! 
---
Seems good.
---
Each darkness played increases the value of each previous darkness because more candles means your draknesses get procced faster.
---
If you have salt in hand, you have to rub it in nicely
---
Actually don't mind the post. Because there ain't anything l. 
---
IMO deathstalker Rexxar is unimaginably imbalanced. There is functionally zero reason not to run it in a deck, and that single card, irregardless of the other 29 cards present in the deck, allows hunter to compete in control situations. At least the other death knights of similar power need some sort of synergy to allow them to shine, see frost lich Jaina isn’t nearly as powerful without other elementals in the deck, or Guldan’s battlecry is useless if you haven’t played any demons. 
---
Got one for wild?
---
Almost exactly my thoughts. While I'm glad they banned the eggs, cause that was bs last time, it's astonishing how the more powerful deathrattles are straight up ignored. Maybe they'll expand the ban list after a couple of days.
---
Heroes with strong deathrattles, such as Hunter and Priest (and to an extend Rogue) are pretty much king in this brawl. Personally, I think Priest is stronger, simply because unlike Hunter, Priest can summon as many deathrattles as he wants thanks to \[\[Resurrect\]\], \[\[Eternal Servitude\]\], and \[\[Twilight's Call\]\]. I'm serious, summoning a bunch of \[\[Obsidian Statues\]\] is probably the most annoying thing a player can face against.
---
On the bright side, \[\[Arena Treasure Chest\]\] can finally see some use and not just some throwaway Arena card.

5/-/- | Recruit 3 minions that cost (2) or less.

Kindly Grandmother is played **very** early and probably was very dominant in their playtests (yes, I think they did test it).
---
That's no comparison to turn 6 cards
---
Toast had food poisoning and really struggled.
---
Don't eat thai food before a big event!
---
Interesting to see that Whizbang decks have a 55.2% win rate... I didn't realize the deck recipes were that good.
---
Good job keeping your phone charged
---
Who hurt you?
---
This reminds me of the Kripp lethal when he uses meteor on his own board to give his minions +1/+1.
---
I love these kind of plays dude, what's your twitch channel. Insta follow for this clip alone :D
---
here he goes being sensitive again
---
It read as a BM to me, sorry if that wasn't the intent. But I would have Wowed, but saying Thanks it sounds like you are thanking the person for helping you win. It reads like when people say Thank You for conceding. 
---
\&gt; Play Mage
---
\&gt; Fill deck with 19x Freeze cards (include 2x Frostbolt, 2x Ice Lance, 2x Freezing Potion), 2x Fireball, 2x Pyroblast, Sylvanas, 2x Ice Block, 2x Vaporize, and 2x Polymorph.
---
\&gt;Freeze Void Singularity and burn face.
---
Deck is about 30% winrate, 100% trigger rate.
---
NOTES: Use Freezing Potion and Pyroblast together to freeze the Void Singularity on T10 and do 10 face DMG.
---
Only use Sylvanas when they are completely out of answers or when you have absolutely no more freeze and are close to death.
---
Save AoE freeze for cube plays.
---
***shh...***
---
Maybe because of all the even shamans and the same reason as for deathstalker
---
\*7/7
---
That was 100% BM, but I think this is one of the rare situations where it was justified. It was ridiculous RNG, and it literally deserves a thank you. OP could not have won on her/his own (at least, not that turn). OP only won because of the inadvertent aid of the other player.
---
RIP Totalbiscuit, got me into hearthstone in the first place
---
Completed with Neoterzial#2816
---
With what cards can I replace cards that will rotate out? eg. fire fly
---
[removed]
---
This is fair! I never use the emotes and usually ignore them, so I didn't really think TOO deep into the context. 
---
You're kidding, right? Saying "thank you" as you win a match is the most BM thing you can do with Hearthstone emotes.
---
Great to see legendaries from the classic set standing strong still. Malygos, the combo king Leeroy an aggressive finisher and Thalnos, solid value and includable in so many deck lists.
---
I was replying to the person who said their hero power triggered three on this boss.
---
too bad opponent concede those
---
i can summon 2 rag &amp; a bunch of stuff with shudderwock
---
Well TIL that Immune actually means “immune from damage and status effects” not “immune from damage” like the tooltip says. 
---
Summoning Spiritsinger Umbra from your hand, while it has the 4/2 buff on it (so it’s a 7/6 Umbra)
---
If you search google with the phrase you tried on reddit, and add reddit, google will usually find exactly what you were looking for.
---
I usually mimic disguisedtoast and Trump's decks
---
ancient watcher and humongous razorleaf should be auto-includes. 
---
&gt;  Jaina is an auto include in any deck that doesn't seek to end the game before turn 9 
---
You see how that at least requires some deck building constraint, unlike Rexxar. Yes if you are playing a slow deck or maybe even some combo decks, Jaina is insane but I don't think she is as busted as Rexxar. 
---
Rexxar is 6 mana compared to NINE, leaving room to use your hero power and be flexible, unlike Jaina. But I'll ignore that aspect if it wasn't for how not bad Rexxar is, in any situation. Like how you said Jaina cannot be in aggro decks like (recently killed) Burn mage or Aggro Odd Mage, the same cannot be said for Rexxar; build any deck you want: Aggro, Midrange, Combo? and even Control(lol) Rexxar is a no brainer for that deck because it comes down so early and wins games/turns around games by its self, especially right when aggro decks are prolly about to kill you, unlike Jaina. 
---
Now I wouldn't be so mad about it but yes they do have strong decks and this game doesn't make it easy for everyone to have a huge swath of decks to choose from otherwise I'd expect decks like even pally to be everywhere. My problem is I only mainly have Mage and Rogue cards (i guess was a poor decision to do) and when hunters can be so flexible to beat my tempo deck with spellstone, then with ONE card put my control deck on the back foot, that does get me a bit salty. I'll say now I do like Jaina, but if speeding up rotation for dk's meant no more dk Rexxar, I'd happily give up dk Jaina.
---
No unstable evolution for kragwa, unlucky
---
I agree, Rexxar is often too low-impact vs aggro decks. It’s not OP, it just gives hunters a chance when they are almost definitely going to lose without it. And with what you said about nobody including cards that decrease win rate, I’ll have to disagree. I play Starving Buzzard and Dire Frenzy in my midrange hunter, both as 2 ofs. Why? I don’t know.
---
Same with mechathun druid, if they cant kill a minion you can just let them fatigue
---
Oh, so now you're saying you don't have to play minions to win games. Great, glad we can see eye to eye. That's the crux of the problem with Jaina, your deck is almost entirely removal, which is a problem if there's nothing to remove to generate water elementals.
---
Thanos is a sleeper in every meta. Never a game changer, but always good. 
---
Yes. Literally anyone who's played those decks understands this.
---
At least in Hearthstone, the worst Legendary card in Hearthstone has one-fourth of the value of the best. In other games with a secondary singles market, that's just not possible.
---
Idk how I missed that...
---
For sick Liam value

No, none of those cards will improve the deck.

Son, just because you don't have money doesn't mean you're owed something for free. 
---
What a man builds with his own two hands is his art, his craft, and a man demands what he deems his art is worth in payment. 
---
You don't get to decide how much his time or his skill is worth, he does that, and you can decide whether to buy or not. 
---
Texx is such a nice streamer and very good too, I don't know the other guy. 
---
it may be because generally before, theyve only bannes specific cards (like whizbang)
---
This is the thing with all these videos. I often find even the hardest lethal because I know there is one. But in live games I miss lethal frequently and only realize after the fact that I could have done some cool things.
---
shadow damage, coin, shadow damage, 1 cost, shadow damage, silence, shadow damage.
---
I think it was a joke about a fake leak that claimed the next set would be called "Secret of the Seas." Star Aligner's multiple references to the number seven and the popular phrase "seven seas" may have been what they were going for.
---
Really? Dang :/ Well, thanks
---
It's EducatedCollins - He was Texx's partner in the Twitch rivals brawl.
---
They got together after to play a few more arenas when this play came up. It went back and forth between "passing couldn't possibly be the correct play for 4 turns" and "I think the best play here is passing again to try and get better mossy value"
---
Passing 4 turns wound up being the perfect play.
---
I'm currently having huge success with Deathrattle Rexxar. The 2/2 mech that kills a minon is just insane here.  2 Freezing Traps, 2 Deadly Shots, 2 of those mechs and 1 Sylvanas gives you so many huge swing turns that it's nearly impossible to lose. Cube is insane on a different level.
---
Production teams can’t be on the entire show according to state law of California where they are entitled to a 30 minute break. Therefore, no one will be switching, doing audio, directing cameras, putting on graphics, and running the show. Hence, having a caster in that slot there would be pointless.
---
Big priest is a tempo/control deck, like handlock. It has combo elements, but isn't dependant on cycling to a single win condition.
---
All i see is that over 1/5th of people are playing hunter and practically all with rexxar!
---
2 of the same class hero cards on the list, well balanced!
