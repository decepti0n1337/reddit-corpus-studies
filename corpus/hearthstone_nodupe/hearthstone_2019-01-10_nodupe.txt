whats the pity timer?
---
---
---
I like how winning only one entire run already earns one the cardback, but future runs don't really offer anything else. After the KOTFT adventure unlocked Arthas, I kind of wanted to see Rikkar being unlocked as a reward for clearing the Rumble Run with each loa/class.
---

---
What do you think? It seems like Rikkar is already a full-fledged hero. Will we see him again outside of the Rumble Run?
---
Surprised nobody else has mentioned the fact that "None of the above" is there twice on the promotions question. Seems a rather silly oversight for Blizzard to make.
---
Completely useless decks 
---
It'd make sense if it was a pack from what the content is based on but yeah it's probably a classic pack. I could see either way though. 
---
They don't know what you won with prepatch. It starts fresh as of today. 
---
Hmmmmm different usernames also different pictures, i dont know what to tell ya bud its a huge coincidence
---
Punny
---
In Tournaments, yes. And that's the intended gameplay by design.
---
Doesn't mean we haven't tried all types of crazy stuff with some opaque card backs at home, tho.

I have all nine, because when I first started playing, I wasn't very good at climbing ladder but I had the time to play a lot of games.
---
Hunter was the first, and I got it because it was very fast, so I won two games, lost two games all the way to Rank 15.
---
Warlock was the last, it was during Un'goro, when Warlock was dumpster, and I did it by playing 1000 Questlock games in Wild over a three-month period.
---
So nobody should feel intimidated when facing a Golden Hero, or a Legend cardback. The first just means they've played the class a lot, which doesn't mean they're good at it. The second means they reached Legend once, but it could have been four years ago. What matters is that they're the same rank as you, which means that right now, they're the same as you.
---
If your unlucky like me when you open 39 packs without a legendary you have a 100% chance to get one meaning I opened 40 packs and got 1 legendary and I am now at 35 packs after that. Meaning I am extremely unlucky.
---
The artist is happy to know you like it! 
---
But that means that, say it’s the Secret or the Divine Shield or the Armor Mana one, you have to beat the entire run to get it basically.
---
You get a golden portrait even if you're not good, but played for a long time (so you got enough wins). It means they're just playing longer than you HS. It doesn't tell you anything about their quality (only quantity).
---
Have had HS installed for 4 years or so on my HDD, uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, never had any issues
---
As many other people suggested, having a new format with random sets each month would be a fantastic addition to the game. Considering they've been listening to the community recently, it wouldn't surprise me if this Brawl was a test to see how the community would react to such a format.
---
Not everyone want to explore what can be done within the confine of the brawl's rule.
---
Heartharena.com. Input is entirely manual but can be as simple as win total or as detailed as class faced and coin/first. 
---
Or "whenever your opponent equips a weapon, reduce that weapon's durability to 1"
---
I think op is just using random article to indirectly gain view for the betting website. Today, he posted one directly promoting it as betting website.
---
So fucking what? I don't give a fuck if nobody plays it. Just because it's under represented and doesn't have a circle jerk like control warrior does, doesn't make the argument less valid.
---
The combo works, just because it sucks across the field doesn't make the combo less combo. 
---
With that stupid reasoning, OP shouldn't complain either if his deck magically had lower win rate, because all of sudden ( it's normal for a bad deck to lose?)
---
On my pc hearthstone tries to run in double resolution which tanks the performance. I would check that if this is an issue for it. Other than that I am not sure why this is an issue, the game seems to be poorly optimized overall :/
---
Yeah that makes sense. I myself dont play super tryhard either, though I have played consistently and that has helped my card acquisition. It also helps that I play exclusively control and then only Priest/Paladin/Mage/Warrior, so I've been able to dust some other classes' cards to solidify the base there.
---
Copying a 3 year old deck makes you so much more original than copying a current one.  I'm sure that typing 'mech' into the search bar took all your mental abilities.
---
Unfortunately only the first sentence was /s.
---
It's random. The only controllable aspect is if the horseman it would generate is on the board, it creates a different horseman instead.
---
I play wild so I would keep any good legendary but I would dust bad ones (Moroes, Maexxna, etc.). 
---
Maybe, but there are a lot of weapons that would do nothing on or even help. At least a higher percentage compared to minions with stuff like Explosive Runes and Snipe.
---
It's not a joke and you're simply defending a lack of clarity as though it were a feature. I'm glad that you don't mind parsing icons in the sidebar to puzzle out what the posting is talking about, but that doesn't mean that the rest of us should feel happy about being required to do so when a few words are all that's required. 
---
People like the OP.  Mech mage is hardly an original concept.
---
The saved money will never be put into improving the game. This is Blizzard cutting costs.
---
Yea I got the 19.99 value pack in december and opened 30 with no legendary...so I feel you 
---
Unity
---
That's not dissimilar from my own setup other than that I'm running an i7. I suppose you could try reinstalling it as some are suggesting. 
---
The technology isn't there yet. 
---
i still play chess. i think the last balance patch came before my parents even met. 
---
I expect Blizzard to Hall of Fame Baku and Genn either at rotation or very soon afterward.
---
Baku and Genn decks are already problematic for the meta.
---
The ones that don't lose anything significant at rotation (work it out) will go beyond problematic into meta-warping territory.
---
They either see that now or they see it when it happens, but they can't ignore it.
---
&gt; Blizzard didn't kill HOTS and they're still patching it and releasing stuff for the game 
---
If the only announcement made for HotS was that the competitive league was cancelled, people would still be (rightfully) pissed given the context however many would continue to play and attempts at third-party tournaments would be more compelling. Instead, Blizzard also announced that they were reallocating people from the HotS team to other unannounced Blizzard projects (read: mobile games).
---
This second component of the press release is what really drove the non-pros away from the game. Yes, Blizz will continue to release content. But only what was already half-baked in the product line. If they do any new releases from that point, they will exclusively tie-in with other Blizzard events.
---
I know your post was really more about HS but I'm saddened by how Activision-Blizzard killed my favourite game overnight. 
---
Yes. It's a plugin developed by NetEase.
---
There was no lack of clarity tho. Looking at the sidebar takes a second and is one of the first things you look at when you see a post that's clearly not about the board. And seeing how the majority here had no trouble figuring it out, you're one of the few. 
---
I'd love to see hs take a page from magics design and create blocks of themed expansions instead of each expansion being one and done. It would allow us to get more support for our favorite mechanics like echo, discover, rush etc.
---
They might also just not have sent it to everyone. Even sending it to only 5% of the player base is more than enough of data.
---
Actually it's a replay.
---
Oh thank you so much for the links, it was actually pretty interesting to read since I haven't seen anything like it before. And I guess I'm pretty okay with the result, yeah, it's not as good as buying the packs for real money, but I don't play arena so I don't need gold constantly.
---
And I'm actually pretty sure I didn't open any tgt packs before, as well as the gvg ones, but I did get two legendaries from them. And I did open the old gods and the gadgetzan ones so that might have been a bug or something indeed.
---
Rotation takes candleshot, razormaw, flanking strike, rexxar, spellstone, dire mole, deathrattle the deck, and probably some other things that don’t pop to mind from hunter. 
---
While I agree there are balance changes that could be made right now, I wouldn’t hold your breathe for them. I’m thinking farther ahead 
---

The writing was on the wall as soon as companies started making games "The next competetive XXX genre" And pushed for "pro" leagues. When true to form pro gaming was coming around, hardly any of it was sanctioned officially by the makers of the games, and the makers sure as fuck werent catering to the professional crowd.  
---
Nowadays games are made so that theyre never wildly out of balance so pros will never be turned away, and the casuals are just people that pay into the game so pros have viewers.

It's a shame because it would be sooo easy to implement as 99% of the back end stuff is already good to go.
---
Thanks for the awesome Arena Update.
---
Regarding the Rumble Run, I thought the power levels were partially on tone (If my deck could handle Zentimo as the final boss with Prince Keleseth ON THE OPPONENT'S FIRST TURN, then any hard deck could be beaten), but I appreciate the boost to synergy rewards towards our totem (tried and failed on the Battlecry Toad several times because of this).
---
If I/we may ask, who was the greatest offender among the Troll Champions? Zul'Jin with his infinite value? Jeklik with her overwhelming pain deliverance? Or was it Voone and his 40/8 Shrine aiming at the players' face?
---
&gt; Well the reconnect in hots is worst in class but the GUI out of game is next level compared to league.
---
From my understanding this was a result of limitations of the SC2 engine the game was initially built on. Reconnect has gotten better but it's still leagues behind parallel games (ability to spectate other game in-client live, instant reconnect etc).
---
On a more serious note, I know Greece has been a flash-point for leftist thought and activity, how would you describe yourself politically? What about Kripp?
---
Thank you, bot!
---
Hey thanks man I actually ended up getting Genn on my 4th pack! 
---
Too bad I don’t play wild
---
Thanks a lot. I actually pulled Genn today and immediately when to this guy’s channel where he has two budget decks made using Genn. Don’t think I’ll craft Baku for now as Even seems to be working out quite well but thank you for showing me this guys channel! 
---
Golden Don is totes worth the dust.
---
I imagine the reason they came to this conclusion is because there's really no incentive to do the Rumble Run except the card back for one win. I know I saw several complaints about this, especially considering how hard it was. So that difficulty and no real rewards would certainly lead to them concluding that packs as rewards is better than free.
---
Remind me! 6 years
---
It’s 2025 and the game is still running like shit on modern computers.
---
How
---
Rotation also takes a lot from Even/Odd decks to a lesser extent, though. As we saw with Odd Paladin, nerfing or removing a single card can radically change the power level of a deck. And new expansions can easily push non-Even/Odd decks by printing good cards and synergies outside of the typical dynamic. If Crowd Roaster was 6 mana for example we'd see a lot more Dragon Roar Warriors I feel.
---
No but they do mislead. I’m only rank 5 and not an expert but I haven’t played against an even paladin in my last 40 games. In that same time I’ve played against 5 even shamans. Even paladin does not have a win condition and was a decent deck 2 weeks ago but it is bad now.  
---
Keep going mate, if you can get 11, you surely will get 12 wins!
---
Not going to lie, huge nostelgia factor, I completely forgot about my old deck, like Vol'Jin which I loved and the 3/5 that gets +2 atk when a character is healed. So happy to use them again
---
You're not wrong, but I think it's necessary as it's to compensate that for all the times that we, the gamers, have implicitly sent the message to developers/publishers "Yes, I enjoy getting rammed from behind because I will continue to buy DLC, spend money on lootboxes/microtransactions, and otherwise keep shelling out money".
---
For every 1 of us that understands that yes, game companies do things for the interest of the game companies and that no, not all decisions are in the best interests for the consumer, there are 99 other people spending mountains of cash rewarding companies for these anti-consumer behaviors. IMO, if repeating the "this is bullshit -&gt; cause not everything that is good for the company is good for the consumer" talk even changes 1 of those 99 people's minds to stop spending money, then it's worth it.
---
This deck might be OK when the rotation happens but as of now the other deck list with brewmasters and Zola  is just better 
---
Iiiiiit's... not. It's never been oppressive, and is a fairly small part of the meta as it has many counters and takes a very long time to pull off its combo. I get that people like to complain about stuff, but complaining about OTK pally is kind of sad tbh
---
Would there be any way to have an indicator on which shrine the enemy is using when the fight starts? Particularly on the mobile client, I have short window to spot the shrine one the darkened board and identify which one it is from the graphic and mana cost, before the board is entirely covered by the mulligan selection.
---
This was ESPECIALLY problematic at the start of the expac when I was still learning what all the shrines did. Previously the single-player bosses listed their special hero power on the ready screen, so you could tap it and find out what it was before the fight started.
---
I'd like to be sure what I need to mulligan for with each shrine. For example with Hooktusk, her thief shrine needs to be destroyed basically on turn 1 or 2, so I mull hard for any removal. Her stealth shrine requires an early AoE moreso than the others. The spell shrine can afford to mull a little slower.
---
With Thekal, I don't particularly want a 2HP 1cost in my opening hand against the damage shrine, since he'll just Bloodclaw and swing for 10 face damage to myself. However his spell shrine needs to be destroyed ASAP before it snowballs, so I DEFINITELY want a 1cost.
---
With Zentimo, his bcry shrine MUST be killed on turn 1 to prevent triple Keleseth. The other two can afford to be a little slower
---
With Malacrass, is he spell damage? I'm expecting a massive AE or Shooting Star straight off the bat, so early minions aren't great. Is he hero power? My 1HP early minions can be tossed. Is he Freeze? I need to mull HARD for removal for his teammates, since they win the game for him.
---
And so on and so on.
---
The real question is is there Room for Lord Godfrey at some point next year? 
---
Stuff like max 30 mana worth of cards and such 
---
Used it from rank 5 to 3 but I can't seem to climb with it anymore.
---
That's weird as shit I run it on an ancient 128gb ssd, an amd phenom II, and a 1gb graphics card from 5 years ago and it's smooth as butter. 
---
50/50. Blizzard made a statement about it lol
---
Oh, I just got the joke. Let me downvote myself real quick.
---
If you get into one of these companies more often than not it’s a salaried position. So overtime and long hours is a regular thing all too often. The industry does prey on young people, the need for “passion”(notice how often the word was used in the Second Dinner announcement video). 
---
This was my first ranked deck as a new player, it's the perfect starting HS deck imo. 
---
Appreciate the re-balancing Paul, previously Rumble Run felt more like the Heroic Modes for the old adventures - overly punishing.  Which, isn't necessarily a bad design, as the new style of single player content is seemingly based on the Rogue-like genre, and anyone who's played those type of games knows that some runs (sometimes MANY runs) end ignobly and quickly thanks to RNG.  That's just how the die roll sometimes.
---
Unfortunately, having played a few games of the re-balanced mode, one of my biggest problems still remains - BS swing turns from the AI.
---
The idea is for the player to kill the enemy shrines as fast as possible.  There's no real strategy at the start beyond "how can I push out damage and board control ASAP to take the shrine out."  
---
The big problem comes when the enemy shrines return, you essentially need to pray that either they're holding a bad hand or will play somehow un-optimally (i.e. Zentimo is overloaded from the previous turn, so he can't unload on you when his shrine returns).
---
So far in the new runs I've played I've had Jeklik play Cataclysm when her Shrine returned, which wipes my board and fills hers up on turn 4 - essentially impossible to come back from.  The only reason she wasn't able to stop my run a third time is because she discarded her Cataclysm spell. Funny story, but there's nothing really engaging about it. 
---
Then, next run, Thekal immediately buffs his revived Divine Shield shrine with Sound the Bells - I had gone wide anticipating this, but the quality of my minions just wasn't enough, putting the shrine way out of reach of even my wide board to kill. A few taunt minions and additional buffs later and my side just gets grounded out.  I saw it coming, and there still wasn't anything I could do about it with the hand I had.
---
Maybe there were small differences I could make in my plans so that those swing turns aren't so devastating.  Perhaps it's part of the design that there be a third or fourth try and THIS time I'll try to find a way around it.  
---
Certainly, taking the ally cards out of the early pools was a big push in the right direction, and I do appreciate the effort - but I gotta be honest, overall I'm finding the power-spike for AI shrines to be more frustrating than fun.
---
FWIW, perhaps the better design choice would have been to make the shrines permanent for each side.  That way the encounters could be balanced with the consideration that these power plays are constantly happening - no more EZ mode vs the AI when their shrine is dead and then "OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING!!" the turn that it comes up. 
---
Additionally, this means the player is always playing their Champion fantasy, not suffering from "dead turns" when their shrine is out.
---
I get that the intent for the Rumble Run was to be analogous to the "give and take" of a boxing or MMA match - sometimes you're on the offensive, other times you're on the back foot and need to adjust. Which is a great intent, but it just seems that the RNG nature of Hearthstone's card draw and the buckets the player is offered make this a much better idea in theory than in reality.
---
What kind of reasoning is "people keep gravitating to the same classes/shrines, so we made it a random pool of 3 (that actually at this point only one will be random, but whatever go buy packs or something)" 
---
Of course I gravitate to the ones I like. I want to play the things I want. If I want to just relax and play any other solo mode it's allowed, but for some reason they don't want players to get freedom of choice in rumble? We're playtesters not happy with getting to try a class/shrine over and over till they won? Or just fuck you players, that's why?
---
What's the reasoning why player freedom was a bad thing? Cause with people asking for it, and you guys admitting that it originally was that way, you guys not seeing that players want to choose class/shrine instead of a pool is to me as stupid and tone deaf as your fellow blizzard employees saying "do you guys not have phones?" 
---
Sounds kinda botlike but idk
---
Still absolutely shitty knowing that they could just let us choose class/shrine and not letting us because fuck you that's why. 
---
Rumble run changes? Maybe should have playtested beforehand. Making changes to single player content a month after it released?   
---
Too little too late in my opinion. It either frustrated  those who tried it and won't come back (I mean .. are casual players even going to know that Rumble Run changed? )) OR some of us (like myself) defeated 100+ champions, got the cardback and are done (because it was so frustrating).  
---
Without changing the structure (like being able to pick your hero or shrine without randomness) or reward (for completing it will ALL the shrines) .. seems pretty pointless to change it now.   
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Harder to complete the quest. Your win rate goes down significantly.
---
Blizzard playtesters ... world's finest
---
Hi, thanks for posting this and lurking. I have a question for you:
---
I've really enjoyed Dungeon Run and Monster Hunt. Each has provided me with dozens of hours of fun. So why is Rumble Run so short? I think it took me 2 hours to finish. That wasn't remotely possible on the other two.
---
I like the format alot, but it's just such a short single run through that it's hard to get excited about it. Why not make it 9 different classes ala Dungeon Run, or at least with 4 different champions ala Monster Hunt?
---
Rumble Run clear :) Thanks!
---
Too confusing for new players
---
Honestly I am still having a hard time believing that after Kongregate.com...and that’s also why I have no idea if Unity is still bad.
---
You can do duo class hero power, 90 cards, can be from any class., and start at 10 mana. Let’s call it Chaos mode.
---
It's personally insulting since the reasoning for it says that they obviously have the ability to give players the choice of class/shrine, but didn't want to because people kept playing what they wanted to play and fuck them for doing that I guess. 
---
I think he was making a joke, historically reno players have always been seen as this sort of deck whose people that play it are enlightened or something, better then aggro (percieved to be brainless) combo (percieved to be unfair, which to some extent totally is), r/hearthstone loves the control playstyle which I also do, but OP was making a joke where big priest players are degenerates, whereas reno priest are honorable because they play one of the best control decks of all time.
---
Also, reno isn't even that bad, there are so many decks nowadays that crush it in infinite value or if they dont draw reno and board clears against aggro then GG. In MSOG the meta was either aggro pirate warrior (which honestly was truly broken and had no business ever being made in the 1st place) or be able to play hearthstone and play reno decks, with some wierd jade decks in between.
---
Add 1 health or attack to Silverback patriarch! Please!
---
Leeroy Jenkins is an amazing card and will always (unless he gets nerfed) be part of the meta. With that said, craft decks and not cards, so I would wait until you have a deck you are making that he goes in. If you are currently playing a budgeted version of an aggro deck and need Leeroy, great! Have fun climbing :)
---
This Brawl is why they should just rotate expansion in Arena .. or even make "blocks" like this a rotating (but ongoing) event. 
---
Uggh. Please no puzzles. That was the only single player content I haven't enjoyed.
---
The Dungeon Run formats have been so much more fun.
---
Because they've already revealed that they had the ability to let players choose class/shrine, but didn't want to let players pick their favorites constantly because fuck them.
---
Because it’s funny as fuck to see people rage after they lose.
---
In both dungeon run and witchwood they gave the option to pick a class and keep at it. It gave me the choice to play something I wanted to (if I want to just play for fun) or to try and finish the run with a class I haven't beaten. The freedom of choice was, and still is, my favorite part of those runs because when I have limited time to play games, I want to play something I want to play.
---
Their reasoning for taking the choice away from playtesters could be understandable to me if they wanted to make sure the testers actually tested all the shrines and interactions. But because they took away the ability to choose what you wanted to play as a player, they now have to "fix" the problem they made in the first place so people could try and "master" shrines.
---
If they had let people choose what they wanted to play in the first place, instead of rejecting player choice, they wouldn't have even needed to make changes because players would *already* be able to play and master the classes/shrines the player wanted to master.
---
It's not a mountain out of a molehill. It's me being upset at a shitty company decision that they're already trying to "fix" when the solution that many people have been asking for was there the whole time.
---
Out of curiosity, which were the most dificult bosses?
---
My point is it would have been swell if they made a deck out of those to choices to use.
---
They should anonymously "suggest" what the new content will be before the expansion drops to get acclimated to community opinion of it, and adjust accordingly.
---
"What if they add a mode you have to beat 27 times to 100% it and also the game doesn't keep track of progress for you" would have been downvoted to oblivion.
---
there are different localisations of HS
---
"I don't know what you're talking about..."
---
Always runs fine at 60 fps on my RX 470, one of the few games that still does.
---
Done!
---
Not everyone has infinite dust to adjust to the meta 24/7
---
Why would anyone want to play with a shrine they already completed? 
---
Too bad odd warrior is 12k dust average
---
Oh this isn't odd Paladin. This is, uh. It's Divine shield (Bolvar), Prince Liam, Secret Paladin. With val'anyr. 
---
It's got Secrets, with Secret Keepers, and Mysterious Challenger. The secrets can be Prince Liam'd though if I'm up for it. As for Divine shield it has the new legendary (I just threw it in) from Boomsday where you have double healing, it's a 1/2 with Divine shield. And Some Divine shield spells as well as Tirion. val'anyr for the lols, and Uther Death knight.
---
It's pretty fun. I don't know about Odd Paladin, I've only built an odd deck once or twice to mess around with friends. I only play with decks I build and Genn and Baku limit me too much.
---
Too much dust, not everyone has money to throw around.
---
&gt; We worried that although you'd get to know the quirks of these characters really well
---
What quirks, though? Their hero powers are the regular class hero powers, and their shrines are the same shrines we get to use. There's really nothing unique about them. The Dungeon Run and Monster Hunt bosses had quirks. These guys are just reskins of the default class heroes.
---
It's such an easy concept too. Just pick 6 different expansions and rotate through them every month. By the time people netdeck it to death, it'll be time to rotate again. People with small collections can keep playing arena or standard, but everyone would really enjoy this breath of fresh air. 
---
But that doesn't change the fact that this "fix" to allow for playing what you want to (from an extremely limited selection) didn't even need to happen if they would have given players the freedom to choose a class/shrine and experiment and explore on their own. 
---
Did the same yesterday when I went to clear some space for my SSD. Thought shifting HS to HDD was a good idea but it was a nightmare. Im rocking with a 1070 as well and ever since HS is on HDD it lags and freezes constantly.
---
no, he is asking if something can build a deck from the cards he has in his collection.
---
Why does the dust refund ever expire? Doesn't it punish players who don't login often?
---
Outplay is probably a strong word lol.
---
I had a warlock quest, so I selected the first 30 warlock cards I had available, won my first game and beat the quest.
---
Hearthstone is 85% luck if we're being honest with ourselves. 
---
It’s possible that it’s as deliberate as a cry for help, but it often depends on availability. Suicide isn’t nearly as often the planned, write a note scenario that media makes it out to be - its often a really impulsive decision. So using what’s available makes a big difference. Stuff as simple as having a gun safe with a combination lock drastically decreases rates (as doing a combination lock in the midst of emotional distress isn’t the easiest thing)
---
I don't think Genn is that bad. At 10 mana, your HP is basically just your starting HP since even + even = even.
---
&gt;I imagine thats the point. They want players to log in often and play often
---
You will straight lose to pretty much anybody with a built deck though.  It's viable the way something like wiz bang is.  Meaning you can get wins, but at at stupid low win rate basically unless you luck into others doing the same as you.
---
If it’s not complaining, what is it? 
---
Yeah that was the only thing I was hoping for. 
---
Ohhhh now I see it. I think I made a missplay

Reading is something you can only get with time played. Knowing what decks are current in the meta, what usually gets played on what turn, response cards to your actions, etc.
---
After you put thousands of hours into something you end up just getting a second sense for it.
---
It's always funny when a streamer runs into a non conventional deck. They get confused and it throws their game off when they can't make the calls.
---
Many people use hand trackers, and they keep tabs of what their opponent hasn't played in addition to what they could've played if they had it.
---
So, let's say you are playing against Mage and they could've wiped your board turn 6 with a blizzard, but they don't.l, even though by all measures it would have been the right play.
---
Over the next four turns they play their next four cards they draw, going into turn eleven you know they don't have blizzard.
---
This wasn't the perfect example. I don't do this bc I play on mobile and mobile doesn't have an app.
---
In addition, when you know the meta decks, you know what people will keep. So you can have a good idea what people might have if they don't mulligan, for instance 
---
No, that’s for brawl 
---
What's so special about a 1/1 that makes it legendary?
---
Just let it go man. They experimented with stuff, people didn't like it. 
---
They reverted. 
---
Let's move on.
---
When you hit a certain rank you start seeing a lot less decks in the meta. When everyone is using the same decks you learn what's in the decks. When you know everything your opponent can do in response to what you do, you kinda get a feel for what they have in hand
---
That was the poor decision. 
---
I feel you mate, this game has some much potential to be a even greater game but they just keep keeping it at a low level with no new features for competitive such as tournament mode, replay system, match history, collection tracker and so on. 
---
I've been playing for years in the hope of that kind of features but i already lost hope, now im having fun in other tcg's but it pains me to think what this game could've be.
---
I keep playing to do my quests once every 3rd day but i lost so much interest that at this point i should just quit.
---
Why?
---
How can you tell this isn't ranked? Mobile client doesn't show the difference between playing Casual vs Ranked iirc. If they were truly conceding because they were tired of seeing the combo, they would've conceded the moment the Quest was played turn 1.
---
Also, Wild Priest is probably the most annoying stuff the game has to offer, in any form. I say that as a Priest player.

So you're saying [you attack its weak point for massive damage?](https://youtu.be/OdGLvM6F6YE?t=53)
---
Turns out the point is not to simply never surrender, but always assume your opponent is an idiot and might have misplayed. 
---
It just pushes the most competitive players towards a goal, helps the community and helps to develop the strategies, everyone wins for having a healthy pro scene even if most of the players don't care that much to watch it.
---
Holy hell that's trash
---
As a hot tip, I have found EMP Operative really helpful in combating all the mech nonsense. People get so greedy stacking their Magnetic stuff onto itself, forgetting that it is a card and you can really blow them out with it.

I have 5 out of 9. (Even Shaman, Secret Hunter, Odd Rogue, Odd Paladin, Odd Warrior)

I could probably make one or two more with the dust I have now, but after that I'd have to spend more money. I'm trying to avoid crafting cards from the sets that will be rotated out in 3 months.

Yeah, I'm not really happy with the overall result, but it's not that bad because those packs are from wild and you can not buy them with gold normally, we can just imagine that I've been buying them with gold for like two months, I guess it's pretty fair.
---
I feel like it’s unlikely to happen with the old sets but possible for the new sets to be done this way, with the next rotation instead doing this. Blizzard probably won’t shuffle back nax and GvG as many newer players won’t have any of the cards, and as some of the old ones will have gotten rid of them as they thought they would only play standard. 
---
 I keep dying to mech-Hunters but I don’t really care about that. I just try to play may Tess- Rogue and some games I got lucky and when you have survived the (about) seven turn the fun begins! The top card that have carried me to survive is probably [[Witchwood Grizzly]]!

We shall go on to the end. We shall fight on the board, we shall fight in fatigue, we shall fight to finish the combo, we shall fight with growing confidence even though we face obliteration the next turn and we shall never surrender, and if, which I do not for a moment believe, this this deck would run out of spells or is met with a counter play, then our sheer force of bluff would carry on the struggle, until *My magic will tear you apart!*

Happy Cake Day teniceguy! Whenever you find yourself doubting how far you can go, just remember how far you have come.
---
Yeah you seem to have exactly the same thought process on this than I do. It's crazy to think Tavern Brawl was the last gameplay update we had.
---
I have actually already made peace with the fact that this deck is dead after the rotation. The deck loses Steed, Stonehill, Lynessa, Potion of Heroism, Uther. Unless the next expansion has a boatload of Paladin control tools this deck will be even deader than it is right now.
---
You can nerf Baku hero power without nerfing justicar though. I play justicar in wild, and he's completely fair. Half of my games I don't even get to play him, so games do feel different.
---
I don't mind genn and Baku right now, but in another year if left unchanged then I'm pretty sure I'll be tired of seeing even shaman/warlock and Baku pally/rogue/warrior.

---
But I'm not saying I will craft undatakah I'm saying ill think about it. Gotta find the list first and compare it to mine first to see what changes because I already find the list I run to be pretty tight and greedy, so i dont see how you could change it to make it greedier. 
---

---
Okay. Could you hit me up with your current list? I won't be able to craft everything rn but I wanna see if I can make some janky budget version for fun. 
---
Well there's inevitably gonna be a superhero themed expansion some day...
---
I know what you're saying. I'm not ignoring it. I'm not too blind to see what you're asking. I just want to know how far you would take this "Getting to choose how to have fun in my runs" logic of yours. You do get to pick a class of a archetypes, but you dont get the focused synergy that shrines provides. I'm legit when I say I would like dungeon runs to have a roulette of 27 archetypes that gives me a different starting deck and possibly comes with the first treasure already attached. Does that mean I want dungeon run changed to that? No. They both have their places. 
---
I've been of the opinion that Dungeon run is the best one out there, and I wish Blizzard would implement a singular "dungeon run" mode with no frills that players could learn how to better play the game, something I think Dungeon run does far better than Monster/Rumble. And then constantly update it with new bosses, updated buckets, refined treasures, bigger treasure pool... instead of reinventing the wheel every damn time. Refined experience beats having three similar-but-different-gimmicks. 
---
And yes, I've played wow. Grinded 100 Exalted Reputations on a single toon even. I'm not confused when I'm indecisive on who to pick to start a solo adventure. Sometimes I feel like doing a run, but I dont know exactly what i want to go for. While there are criticism of that method, I did like how the rumble just makes you go "Fine, Ill go outside of my comfort zone right now and try to get a great deathrattle deck going." 
---
Nope, EU.
---
Also just started work, so I'll be gone for a good 7 hours + getting home after that
---
You say you have zero wild cards but bought wild bundle. Get your story straight.
---
Best tavern brawl ever. Limiting card sets and playing with old expacs
---
I managed to get 8 wins, I think I got really lucky that everybody had low tempo decks..
---
I also have played for four months and if you payed 1000 dollars and were able to craft only 5 meta decks, I have no clue wtf you were doing with your dust. Not going to claim the game is cheap because god knows its not, but if you have the complete classic set, that is you being retarded and is no one elses fault. Classic set contains millhouse, lorewalker, nat pagle etc. There is no reason to ever keep these cards. You also mention not having any wild cards but you purchased the wild bundle? 
---
I dusted them all immediately after buying them. This means I have none. This is not difficult to fathom.
---
I feel its just as likely to happen with the old sets. If you disenchanted GvG cards, that's not my problem. I still have mine. Because if we say that the set shouldnt be included due to the chance of people having DE'd their cards, that means Whispers of the Old Gods would never be in the rotation. And then I would have a very sad Yogg.
---
Your device's files doesn't include the card he played I believe or is corrupt or something along those lines.
---
&gt; We always prefer to experiment, try extreme ideas, and get feedback rather than play it safe.
---
Sorry, when have you *ever* done this?
---
It's much nicer being able to wipe out things like Firefly in a trade than having to target the 1/1's because of Level Up.
---
&gt; I tell everyone not to play Hearthstone, just as I tell everyone not to buy bitcoin (and I've been right).
---
I play HS nearly daily, spendt arround 200-250€ per set and yet: I didn't advised any of my friends to play it. Rather the opposite: Friends see me play the game in bnet-messenger or on my phone or just hear me talk about it, get interested in the game and say they are would like to try it out...
---
an then I tell them how tiresome the game is for beginners, how much you would need to grind to even get one good deck as f2p or how much you would need to spend (tbh: I even underexxagerate my expensen) and to no surprise the interest in the game wanes.
---
Yeah and a filing market usually has low prices. Not a huge surprise there. In some developing countries the money you need to live is 10x less than what you would need in a developed country but no one would call their economy good. 
---
Ranks were introduced more than 2 weeks ago so you should have started at rank 50. There is an option to skip to rank 25, maybe you used that unknowingly?
---
I don't know what brawl you guys are playing but it's mechs and mechs and mechs. What's fun in that? All of my games consisted of fighting mech decks. 
---
I think he had like 39-40
---
absolutely save for future expansions
---
Seriously? Don't think this is gonna play but still  doubt
---
If you already have a large collection I'm not sure the bundle is that great of value (best expansions are from 2017 anyway &gt; not in the bundle).
---
I think targeted crafting is probably a better way to get into the format, especially if you're not sure.
---
Nope. Next question :)
---
If it comes like an additional format there is no problem. My concern was standard being like that which rotates every single month
---
Call it Safari, like 2-3 standards sets and 3-4 wild sets, every month with different sets.

---
classic Richard, badmouthing anything without any filter and then backpedaling when there is need to do business. understandable and sure, his audience watches him for the first part.
---
also, arguing that casters need to criticize players as they do in esports where significant part is physical execution (not hitting shots, bad positioning, etc.) is pretty shortsighted, and that's regardless of if there is  supposed "inn atmosphere" or not. not every deck is 100% straightforward, and you may not see players true strategy, so bashing him before it becomes apparent makes fool out of caster, not player.
---
also, it is not like caster never bash players - remember poor hunter play during HCT last year? it was from one of Chinese players, like picking keleseth from stitched tracker and playing it and obviously not getting the buff. casters were making fun of player even next day...

lol, yeah, why on earth would I choose what I want to play with if I can do this stupid shit :D

5/3/8 | Whenever an adjacent minion takes damage, this minion takes it instead.

I’ve posted about this idea before, I think Blizzard is testing it with this brawl. All we gotta do is show our support for this format and they might seriously consider it.
---
New people would actually HAVE to spend money because they won't have wild format cards.
---
Yep. Like, it's downright bizarre that wasn't an official answer. 0_o
---
I think they are also using this brawl to experiment future formats and hopefully re-evaluate the way rotations work. Personally, I start loosing interest around this time and just wait on the rotation.
---
*And* you've got the biggest penis, and everyone claps when you enter a room.

&gt;Why are you even here if you think Hearthstone sucks?

Because that's not what they said. They said competitive hearthstone sucks.
---
Tournament mode will never exist unfortunately Ben Brode promised it would be in the game within the year (2018) and he left Blizzard shortly after.
---
Nah, this mode needs a really complete collection, since each month you’d need new cards, particularly without a classic set. So really, it means more income for blizzard. Only problem is a potential splintering of the player base but going from 3 modes to 4 shouldn’t be too bad, and I think HS has a big enough player base to take that without being hurt by it.

I for one really hope odd warrior doesnt get nerfed. As someone who dislikes aggro decks its been nice to have a good anti-aggro deck to play. Control priest and big spell mage never quite felt good enough imo.
---
Odd warrior did it better, and its actually very fun to me. In a game where zoo can lethal on turn 4-5 there needs to be decks to punish that. People on this sub like to say aggro punishes combo decks, but aggro should also be punished by decks like odd warrior.
---
Why would I care if my opponent is having fun or not? All I care about is whether I have fun or not.
---
Just played it now and it was crazy not being able to use cards I've relied on so much in Standard...but having to look how best to use unfamiliar and rarely used cards was so refreshing...seeing your opponent being confused as you are is hilarious!
---
The problem with the mode is that you are talking about taking old expansions out for a few months, so crafting the cards would not be a great idea. 
---
New players get completely screwed, even harder than in the current ladder. Just because we have 5 years of cards doesn't mean that the guy who started a year ago will. That's why it's much more pay-to-win. 
---
You're speaking from the perspective of someone who has been playing for years. This kind of game mode would likely alienate new players even more than now. Constantly shifting set of cards that they don't want to craft because they will be unusable in 3 months? Pretty rough.

I don't agree with your throwing of unions under the bus - bad unions do exist, there's no denying that, but so do good, effective ones. Bad unions can be taken over (since the leadership is elected) or replaced, you can't do the former with your job and often neither the latter. Unions exist to try to correct a power imbalance between employer and employee and while they're not flawless, they certainly shouldn't be discarded as a whole.
---
I should say I have no idea what unions in the game development space are like.
---
Dual class arena needs to come back more frequently 
---
One advantage of the previous expansion is that you would see the cards in action, against you, before hand. So you could saw their use, strengths and weakness; it was easier to think "oh yeah, looks fun, can't wait to incorporate it in deck X". Now, you will open dozens of packs and wonder what to do with all those cards.
---
There are some problems with this. 
---
1- You are again splitting the player base even more and that can get dangerous for games. With wild and standard already splitting the player base but for a rather good reason since you'd probably lose a lot of players if you only had standard and there would be blatant power creep to keep the game fresh if there were only wild. 
---
2- This would be quite horrible for new players who would in no way have enough cards to switch decks every month. At least with Wild you have the option of building a deck or 2 and play it for a while.  This means that your player base is only people who don't like current standard, and also don't really like wild. This would lead to a fairly small player base for the mode and thinning out the other ladders too. 
---
If it's just so that old players can have fun trying out new decks they could have a week once a month where they pick 3 different expansions and let you use those cards.  
---
r/whoooosh
---
It's between Zilliax and Shaw for sure. Both are among the best legendaries for Hunter in Arena. I'd probably rank Shaw as the best legendary for hunter overall. You don't really want too many lategame cards as hunter usually so picking one as your first pick might not be great when your other options are so good. Especially since Oondasta is a pretty mediocre high-cost legendary imo.
---
What
---
This isn't guaranteed to go infinite. You have to have 2 Shudder/Grumble at the start of a turn (one can be on the board) in order to go off repeatedly on a turn. Every time you play one of them, you get the other back into your hand, meaning you'll always have 1 of them in hand. But at the end of the turn, if you only have 1 in hand, you're relying on the one on the board surviving to next turn so you can bounce it back and continue the loop.  You can increase the odds by getting some successful Zola triggers to increase the number in hand, but it's not a certainty. 
---
Regardless, even if this were infinite, it's still vastly more complicated and slow than old Shudderwock Shaman. You have to get Grumble in hand before you discount it twice (which also means you're running a couple 2-mana 1/1 elementals instead of something impactful). You have to get Eureka, Shudderwock, Grumble, and no other minions in hand. Then you spend a turn bouncing something to hand, and the next turn you play 2 Shudderwocks.
---
In the old version, ordering didn't matter. You played your Battlecry minions whenever you wanted, and then you were set. That's so much easier, and is the difference between a strong deck and a meme one.

It's odd because Whispers was the successor to the classic set. My guess is something similar to Ungoro, an adventure of sorts. Main characters are traversing through a new landscape to save X item. I expect to see Reno and Sir Finley reprints coming this year, a new explore mechanic similar to Discover, but this allows you to search for specific cards at cost or by limitation. The game has been moving more towards buffering of decks, so an entire mechanic allowing you to buffer specific spells, mana costs, tribe tags, etc just makes sense to me. 
---
I was gonna post it but u beat me to it. Wrong hero, guy’s right.

Not really. Implementing one officially could to those who think it's a form of cheating look like the game is in some way supporting the act of cheating.
---
No fuck off stop posting garbage hahaha
---
Aye, that is my point. I always open way more than 100 packs over the course of an expansion.  All the preorder does is front load your card acquisition, but in the long run you are buying a pile of dust at the end.

You also have to keep in mind the fact that the Druid is in fatigue while you have plenty of cards left in your deck
---
I think you mean"D-D-D-D-D-D-Dual!"
---
The thun druid is pretty cheap
---
Dormammu, I've come to bargain
---
How does it being stupid prove your point? What because a dog is stupid proves your point about cards being different.?
---
?
---
Reno decks are still pretty decent in wild, at least warlock, and there're several other reno decks.
---
Hunter has spell hunter and cube hunter as big decks, and a midrange version with beasts that has popped up and is strong.
---
Odd paladin and warrior and rogue are still things.  Even paladin and Shaman are also good.  
---
Priest has a new deck which uses a spell that summons a 1/1 copy of all minions in your deck and uses resurrect spells with stuff like mindblast.  Dragon control priest is back again.
---
Rogue has a new pirate tempo deck which is neat.
---
Paladin now has an OTK deck that works consistently with the death knight, and another that uses holy wrath, though the former is generally better.
---
Warlock still has even control and cube available.
---
Mage has big spells and odd mage due to a new minion in the latest set.  Tempo mage is still kind of a thing.
---
Shudderwock shaman is dead due to a nerf to saronite chain gang where it summons a 2/3 saronite and not a copy of itself.
---
Druid got nuked to oblivion with wild growth and nourish both increasing mana costs by 1.
---
Mecathun decks  (warlock, warrior, priest, and druid are the current decent ones) that work via a 10 mana card that is "deathrattle:  If you have no cards in your hand on your field and in your deck, win the game" though none of those decks are that powerful.
---
Leeching poison got nerfed to a one turn only thing, so aggro kingsbane rogue with pirates is now a thing in wild.
---
Big priest still is a thing in wild.  Mech hunter is a new deck with the second expanion of the year adding in a fair few mechs and metaltooth leaper finally has time to shine.  
---
Finally, if you're thinking of crafting something, craft Zilliax.  It may seem unassuming, but it's really good in most MR and control decks for some board control and lifesteal.  It's like azure drake but defensive.
---
But I never play mage in all these years I used to play HS. Except quests etc.
---
Wow I never noticed that. I guess the copies lose their gem for some reason.

Hey anrwlias, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Yup
---
Yeah they are just literally random cards. No attempt to make any kind of coherent deck, so you'll just get destroyed by absolutely everyone. Not really an option. 
---
I fully sympathize with the druid hate and absolutely support the nerfs. That said, fuck Hunter. That class has become so damned oppressive. It's nothing but a gigantic bag of solutions.

Okay so first of all, the deck IS BAD look at the winrate for it. And Armor gain isn't something specific to Warrior, Druid almost does it better, mage has easy access ran in a lot of decks, and can even randomly generate it. On top of a lot of random decks running things like Beetle or Hero cards. if the deck is completely centered around dealing 30 damage and no one dies to it then it's fundamentally BAD.
---
Lol guys "literally unplayable" what a funny and not at all over-used meme lololololol.
---
Honestly shut up mate.
---
Okay but imagine if you needed to craft a bunch of common cards from the old set, like mechwarpers? And then the set rotated out of use and you just spent a bunch of dust on *commons* because you didn't play when that set came out. That's more the situation I'm talking about. Let alone needing a legendary or epic from the set. It wouldn't feel good.

The percentage chance of pack 20 being your first legendary is 6.2%, and it then dips down to 4.8% for pack 22.  Either they have the weirdest coding ever, or there is some statistical noise in there (I'm leaning on the latter).  For pack 7, it's 5.1%.  
---
The droprate does not significantly change until pack 30.  So in conclusion, bite my ass.

Thanks for the advice but my org only does "new racketeering price matching" any new threats that put money into the org they match into a number Swiss account. Also we recruit from within but you have to do your own hiring by taking out your Superior. It's cut throat but hey that's business.

&gt;One of the things we experimented with—and heard great feedback on—was about the earlier pack rewards for the Rumble Run. Previous Hearthstone missions awarded packs via quests for completing content. For The Boomsday Project, we gave packs out without a quest to celebrate the launch of the expansion’s missions. **This time around, we front-loaded the rewards and gave players three extra packs on launch day instead of during the Rumble Run. We felt that packs might be more interesting to people during the initial weeks of the expansion.**
---
&gt;As many of you have pointed out, this decision just made the missions feel especially un-rewarding. It’s always more gratifying to earn packs by competing a quest, rather than just being given them. Going forward, we’ll keep this feedback in mind for the launch of new single-player content.
---
It was right to give out packs early. They shouldn't change that.

At the time, this move easily won me the game on turn 8. I would have had to wait 3 turns, and the way this shaman way playing, I probably woulda been dead.  
---
But had I know I was going to post this for giggles, I would've done it for the kicks.
---
I don't either, but it at least is a contributing factor.
---
But going first with limited board clear options + mechs snowbally mechanic with mechwarper and magnetic... Its still a decent brawl but would have loved if they left some of the classic cards in the pool.
---
I beat my son.
---
One of these big green men is...different.

---
Some guy ripped a radiant elemental off a menacing nimbus on me and proceeded to spam unstable on 3 different monsters. Needless to say I got otk’d on turn 4 
---
It plays Ysera which can generate very powerful cards as you know, Dr Boom which can generate even more large mechs to pressure, and large dragons, but since combo decks run 20+ survival tools and a couple of combo pieces they just clear the board every time, much like a control deck, but they win from their hand, on their turn, with no response from the opponent.
---
&gt; We feel bad for knocking Dog’s Warlock decks and we would like to emphasize that we really respect him as a player. He is one of the drivers of innovation in the game, and we also agree with his fans that he should take off his shirt.
---
Finally some quality insight from the DataReport team.
---
Thank you for your tips  kind stranger :)
---
Yeah I somehow doubt that's what's gonna happen.
---
If they thought spreading plague etc. were the problem they would have nerfed them.
---
They have a list with the top 20 most problematic classic and basic card and every other balancing update or so they cross one of these off the list.
---
That's why wild growth and nourish got hit.
---
One guaranteed in the first ten packs of Classic and the six Standard sets, one Death Knight from the KFT solo content, and one Loa from the RR promotion still going on. There's also Marin, but you can't disenchant him and he doesn't see competitive play so I didn't count him.
---
Thanks for the list im trying this one out for sure :)
---
Yeah thats really good with Warrior because the extra shitload of armor that LK gets is completely irrelevant in the face of a full board of gigantic dudes. Same for druid but you go jades instead of normal dudes.
---
We're ultimately talking about the cost of the game, but you're refusing to accept that you play in a way that runs counter to how most play the game which isn't nearly as expensive as your way.
---
Esso#1710 - NA - Trade 2x80g. You go first please. Will delete this comment when matched.

For priest, an alternative to Mechathun is Big Priest. Just beat him with it first try.
---
I'd love it, but I don't have any wild cards, so it ends up being super lame
---
As an only classic player i hated it. I have dusted every wild card i have had, so this was not that fun. 
---
I responded in more detail elsewhere in the thread, linking to it here:

---
Its a no brainer Shaw pick he is one of the best legendarys. Zilliax is good (but no Shaw). Oondasta is a average at best as a first pick.
---
Sure, Reno is easier in wild today than he was in standard when first released. But he isn't consistent. Renolock and Renopriest aren't guaranteed to get that full heal before an agro deck kills them. And having 30 different cards makes your draw very inconsistent. You can't likely predict what you'll draw each turn.
---
I personally like Reno decks. Renolock has been a staple of wild for quite some time, but it's not so good that people aren't trying other kinds of warlock. Evenlock, Cubelock and Mecha'thun Warlock are all viable decks at the moment.
---
And the real 'powercard' of all of these decks is Bloodreaver Guldan, not Reno.
---
Philpereira7#1830 America, you go first

Ah true true. Was Majodormo League of Explorers? 
---
&gt;The droprate does not significantly change until pack 30.
---
Mate are you mad at yourself for changing the topic? Lmao. 
---
Please clearly specify whether you personally support nerfing Baku or not. It will help a lot of people in the community here decide whether they should hate you or not, whichever way they lean.
---
I am scared that these year finals might be the last time we see official competitive Hearthstone for the last time.
---
Thats where the low level memes are. The REAL memes are here at this hearthstone subreddit.
---
Ah, i see. 
---
It’s fine. It sets each players mana to five. I run it it even warlock and even Paladin 
---
I don’t remember to be honest 
---
I think their lack of answers to any combo decks like exodia, mech cthun, hakar... As well as the rise of hunters which brings rexxar.
---
I love control and long games, but even I don't want to spend 1/3 of my games facing rexxar as he builds a beast every single turn and I lose in fatigue because he gets lifesteal and charge shit for free.
---
After rotation my friend, then standard warrior will shine. That's when I'm coming back to standard. Until then it's wild only. 
---
SNOOZE INSECT! 
---
LoL that’s a good one 
---
I was quoting the user in the original post, and it's pretty clear the big spike happens after pack 30, or more specifically pack 28.  Pack 22 is still 4.8%, park 25 is still 5.6%, pack 27 is still 6.0% (either 26 or 27 is an outlier since there's that weird spike there).
---
Boy for someone quick to insult and quicker to brag, you sure do love to be pedantic when there's a chance you weren't exactly right eh?
---
On my birthday of all days for my fav format &lt;3. Looking forward to it. Not nearly enough data gets released from wild for my taste, but it can't be helped. 
---
This is great. Pretty clickbaity, but still, it looks like I'll have to watch a few of these games for sure. Really want to see that Shaman and Warrior deck, which are really off meta. I'm also wondering how Azalina does in odd Mage. What decks does it want to tech against? Mechathun, Quest rewards, Zuljin/Rexxar?
---
Alternatively: [[Spirit of the Dead]] a [[Silence]]'d [[Majordomo Executus]], then when you draw it you just need to play [[Shadow Word: Pain]] and [[Amara, Warden of Hope]].

By good you mean broken lol. Will be in the dumpster for the rest of the year, unless Baku or genn can redeem the deck post rotation somehow probably. If the current cards don't cut it, then the new less powerful ones (probably less anyway from the past 3 sets) will not either.
---
oh that. Good way to slow the drood down unless they have biology project
---
Yeah, much better, but Majordomo costs more. I don't think the cost makes it worse doe

Here is the answer, sort by suicide column or look at the graphs under the table:

Compare to somewhere like the UK where guns are just not really a thing - usually even most criminals don't have them (or just use replicas). It's a staggering difference.
---
Here’s what I used:
---
Warrior: Kelthuzad+Public Defender+Big minions combo; creates an impenetrable defense against the last stage (be sure to kill all but one Soul) then just stack on big minions or watch him mill all his cards
---
Shaman: The hardest one for me personally, use Evolve Shaman as his handicap condition does not affect cards outside your deck
---
Rogue: Used Murlocs+Leeroy
---
Paladin: I play Divine Shield Paladin with Fledgling and Murlocs
---
Hunter: Spell Hunter
---
Druid: I used Taunt Druid featuring big Taunt minions
---
Warlock: Reno-Lock
---
Mage: Lackey+Mana Bind+Murlocs+Stall+Frost Lich Jaina
---
Priest: A random deck with Shadow Word: Horror

What the fuck are you talking about? Okay, first, no, my friends and I did not dislike it an play it all the time, so stop thinking you know me, boy (saying because you are acting like a child). Second, I have seen the numbers and they do not surprise me in the slightest. I think you need to learn to stop assuming things, stop insulting people, and learn to face facts that the game is struggling.

Epic article
---
No, I understood fine. Your follow up comment had absolutely nothing to do with mine. I’ll restate mine a little more simply for you. 
---
&gt; obviously, the more cards they made legal, the more diverse the new meta would be.
---
This statement, made by you, *is not true* 
---
Also check out HSreplay for deck lists and stats 
---
I guess in reality, there are two non-competing reasons that make Odd/Even decks good.
---
1) Low card pool emphasizes a consistent strong hero power.
---
2) High card pool allows the decks to not play terrible cards, whereas normal decks never need to play terrible cards.
---
So Genn and Baku are good both in low-card and high-card environments.
---
I would hope that events like this could finally push Blizzard to selling complete sets (GvG, TGT) or even blocks (Year of the Raven, Mammoth, etc) as they rotate out. These sets would give 2 of each card (1 for legendaries), non-gold, that cannot be disenchanted. If you purchased the set and had any cards from it, it would give you the dust for disenchantment and switch the entire set to unable to disenchant. This would allow new players to "catch up" if they wanted to play older formats like Wild.
---
Odd mage and aggro-odd mage are bottom of the barrel t3 decks. 
---
Absolutely a problem! /s
---
I've been playing Secret Hunter exclusively since the balance patch. I still find it to be very very stong in most matchups, including vs any non-deathrattle Hunter when played correctly. 
---
What makes the Hybrid Hunter build so much better? Is it more proactive? Face damage? 
---
I see it still is over 51% winrate so sticking with it wont really hurt, just legit curious. 
---
Obviously 10-mana cards have to be kind of ridiculous to see play (see N'Zoth). UI doesn't need any prior setup of cards played, and the main thing that makes it so good is it removes the one major drawback of ramp, which is card disadvantage. Doesn't matter that you used 2-3 cards to ramp when you can make it up with 5 card draw on a really good card. Also, 5 mana do nothing is literally the opposite of tempo.
---
I remember when Murloc Paladin was the best deck in the game or at least top 3-4 for nearly a year uninterrupted, and yet nobody played it.
---
&gt; Shaman will stay out of the dumpster, but it sure is boring. 
---
&gt;  How are we going to fill our talking space for Shaman over the next 4 months?
---
Why can't you just say "Even Shaman continues to do well as one of the best decks in the game" instead of throwing that cringy stuff every week? Even Paladin, Even Warlock and honestly any Even deck is equally boring given the nature of a streamlined curve, I don't understand why you hate on shaman every single fucking weak.
---
It's almost as if Spreading Plague, Defile, and whirlwind effects in general are essentially gone from the meta? And that Odd Paladin counters a class which is nearly a third of all played games?
---
I have many cards, got 4 legendaries and 1600 dust from disenchanting. Then additional 600 from golden cards.
---
So you are way off.
---
Those are the mana costs, not the damage. Didn't even need to use coin.
---
It’s time to D-D-D-D-D-D-Dino
---
If you don’t get it, that’s fine. It’s a smart joke, only smart people would get it.
---
Why do u wanna hide smth from ur wifes? That's fcked up. 
---
This is absolutely the way to go.  Formats with limited card pools tend to get solved faster so rotating them monthly makes a lot of sense.  They should make it a monthly ladder.  You could limit it by sets like this brawl, and you can also limit in other ways:  Singleton format with 50 cards (Ban Reno and Kazakus and Raza), Pauper format (Commons and Basic only), Tribal only (80% of your deck must be one creature type) lots of options with this.
---
Because it wasnt the best number one deck.. but VS would say it for a whole year that it was. Now they are doing it to odd pally. 
---
I totally forgot about that! I definitely haven't.
---
Thats accurate. We have a year of fun. But we all hope the better for this company.
---
No immunity from instant death effects. Same with ice block same with time out.
---
I mean... increase the new player "care package". Offer them more cards, from all manner of sets. Or, allow people to buy bundles with gold instead of currency.
---
These are some thoughts I had. ALthough, if they wait too long to implement this game mode, the damage will be greater.
---
I see this mode as the same as Wild. Some people play it, others do not.
---
Look at his name.
---
To me the weirdest deck is Zyrios's Mecha'Thun Warlock. It doesn't run the Bloodbloom/Cataclysm combo, so it appears his plan is to play out all his cards then play Mecha'Thun + Dark Pact.

Well no, Hunter, Paladin, Warlock, Priest and Rogue could definitely still have very strong decks. You could play Rogue and Paladin decks with neutrals only and they'd probably still be better than Mage
---
Oh! wow hahaha... 
---
But hs will survive. Its funny. I will leave when other company, prob chinese, buy the IP.
---
Still plenty of people hold onto their wild cards and that number only increases with each expansion as more cards become wild. And if the first four expansions are absolutely essential people can buy some packs, adventures, or simply craft essential cards.
---
pretty much said it, shadowstep is good because it's so versatily, works as a combo enabler and to repeat the effects of those minions
---
It really works incredibly well, as long as you cant afford vilespines you can run assassinates instead
---
Quest discard lock had a brief run in the first few days of booms day .  The new legendary is good with it

---
As a note, the last shrine has always been the one you just lost against.
---
Playing big priest? Yes absolutely you are.
---
I think it would be a lot of fun to have a rotation system, but I think blizz would have to be AGGRESSIVE with the new player experience. Like give out 20 packs for free for the old expansion or something. I dunno. Not that they would ever go that far. 
---
It would be interesting for the first round, but after that the people with more friends that can scout other matches have a huge advantage.  It also places a huge disadvantage to having your match streamed 
---
Somehow sounds sexual...
---
TBH with the amount of people that are leaving, I'm actually happy. Maybe they will create something new, away from Activision. 
---
I want the next Blizzard North, people creating games out of passion, not just for revenue. If that means this Blizzard as we know it will dissapear, I'm ok with it. 
---
Is hunter really that big of a problem? I play warlock and all im seeing is velen maly priest every single match which is much more tilting
---
They did, they just didn’t announce it officially. 
---
nice :)
---
&gt;As far as what Team 5 themselves thinks on the matter is largely unknown. No one on the team has ever made a statement on it nor does the terms of service mention anything on the matter as far as I am aware.

A couple of years ago Ben Brode answered someone question about the tracker.

Plot twist, bennie was playing hunter 
---
A deck can be effective but underplayed for several reasons. Many players find aggro paladin to be quite boring to play. The basic concept of the deck has remained the same for years. Swarm the board, make obvious trades, refill with Divine Favor, repeat until out of cards or opponent dies. It doesn’t do anything spectacular and the reward of playing optimally is minimal compared to other decks.
---
Cost is another issue. IIRC murloc paladin was a rather expensive aggro deck with multiple epics. So many players were turned off by that as well.
---
Replaced by control priest style decks, oh yay.
---
After all this I still somehow believe Heathstone will/can be the "digital MTG".
---
I mean, even if you continue pumping three expansions a year and absolutely nothing else, people will still play it, especially with mobile market in place and everything. And it's not like MTG is doing anything more than that and people play it with passion since 90's and pay like hundreds of dollars for a single deck.
---
I'm more worried about HS's simplistic design and what more can they bring to the table to keep the game fresh and exciting for years to come. It's been like 5 years and I feel like we have already seen everything.
---
It won't work, you have to have been friends in the [Battle.net](https://cBattle.net) client for a few day grace period before you can send gifts.
---
I mean, a lot of bad cards get good runs in the first few days after an expansion. Doesn't mean they're good.
---
Someone bringing the card to a tournament well after the release is a whole different story. 
---
Yes, you can play any old solo adventure as long as you own them. If you buy it now just open it up and it will be there.
---
What's win condition of control priest? can't out value Rexxar DK, Jujin as well. 
---
It's got a pretty high play rate at the moment, which can result in streaks of multiple hunters in a row. Its not the most oppressive class ever or anything but my god is it boring going 5 or 6 identical games in a succession.. I doubt I'm the only one whose been less inclined to climb the lower ranks lately because of it.
---
Rush/recruit warrior decks are lots of fun but not overly successful (yet?).  
---
The control type warrior decks (odd/quest) are just so fucking boring and long to play even people who play them most likely can' be bothered trying to ladder with them.  
---
There are only so many hours in the day after all.
---
I get the point you’re trying to make, but looking at the broader history of nintendo, they’re a company that has survived explicitly through drastic change to their business.
---
They started as a playing card manufacturer, but through some obviously drastic changes, they’ve become on of the worlds most iconic video game companies.
---
No companies are truly static. Not the ones that seek to last through the decades, at least.
---
You can change your methods as a corporation without changing your core values. Plus, before the release of the Switch, yes, people really did think that Nintendo was dying, and that they should sell off their IP's and pivot to mobile development. 
---
And it's for the exact reason that people believed that Nintendo didn't do enough to change. But they did. And look where they are now.
---
Damn. And damn Blizzard from preventing me from buying the bundle within the app. Grr

Back with another **infographic** to see what current decks will look like after the rotation.   
---
As you can see **Even Shaman** won't get hit too hard by the new Standard year. Because of the loss of Corpsetaker Argent Commander, Vicious Scalehide and maybe even Al'Akir won't make the cut in the future. Losing good cards like Saronite Chain Gang and Lich King will also hurt the deck, but it can still function without those. A great Basic and Classic core supports this kind of minion-heavy archetype.
---
What do you think? Will Even Shaman survive the reset? Thanks for your feedback!
---
cant

Am I the only one who doesn't think Brode leaving was a death kneel? 
---
On the one hand, he was clearly a huge part of the foundation of the game and the success its had from the beginning.
---
But also as a core initial designer of the game, the imbalanced state of the Classic set is in no small part due to him. 
---
As Lead Designer, the team were glacially slow to balance cards (i.e. six months to nerf Yogg Saron), and made some very puzzling nerfs.
---
And once he became Game Director, he oversaw one of the biggest decisions in the games history with the abolishment of Adventures. To add once he accepted that role, the team barely added to the game outside of expansion content.
---
I don't want to put all flaws of the game on him because surely not everything is because of him, but I almost feel like people do the opposite which is ascribe all the success and golden years on Brode but then overlook all the issues that were around while he was in charge.
---
I think this mode would be good for Blizz too. Even cards not good enough for Standard might be needed. For Example, EMP Operative is very strong in this brawl. 
---
they showed off the deck, explained their choices of cards and how to improve the deck with more dust and then played a game at decent legend level to demonstrate how to play it. they had almost a mirror match and kinda explained their plays. I suggest you should watch it when you get the time, I can't really explain it quite as well. They didn't show off the whole legend grind, it's a fairly concise video
---
Brode got Hearthstone rolling and he was a good PR face, but I never got the impression that he was very effective at managing the size of a game Hearthstone became. 
---
Who knows what challenges he faced within the company, but Hearthstone was not exactly blazing ahead with new innovations in 2016-2017, and the effects of the immense power level of their expansions during that time is still felt in Standard format today.
---
Game mechanics updates - which I interpret as fixing technical debt within the game - started in late 2017, quite late during Brode's management of the game, and have continued to this day.
---
From that perspective, it makes perfect sense for Brode to have moved to a new startup, where he can use his strengths in the front-end of innovation and not worry about managing an existing major product.

Wow congratulations i have never seen anyone on reddit as petty as you are. And that is an accomplishment. 
---
You couldn't even use my real comment because maybe someone could agree with that. 
---
I am impressed. 
---
*And not for 1 second was he able to see that his post might not have been as genius as he thought.*
---
Scroll of Wonder doesn't count toward the quest completion though.
---
The game has grown more generous with gold and dust since the switch from adventures, but I'd also propose that what you're suggesting (more playable legendaries) would only make the game more expensive. I think the current amount is in a nice sweet spot where you don't have to own significantly more legendaries to be competitive and where the meta doesn't revolve around big swing turns as much due to all the legendaries seeing play.
---
If that's the case, then outside the first week of any particular month, the player numbers would be even lower than Wild's. It would be a glorified Tavern Brawl.
---
I understand the post has been edited, but his one of his points was that it would be an alternative to Standard with a lower barrier to entry compared to Standard.
---
I believe this will definitely remain a strong deck.  Stormbringer and rain of toads as well as spellbreaker are already great additions to the deck.  While corpsetaker was definitely a power move, there are still plenty of good 4 drops to take their place.  The deck has always been playable without Kalimos but it should miss lich king quite a bit.  The big question will be - is blizz gonna give (or are there some neutral already) 8 drops to re-up the deck's late game, or will it be forced to turn into a more aggressive build with more 4 and 6 drops?  Finally, hagatha is going to be one of the few hero cards in the game, and obviously will remain very powerful.
---
Thanks for making this.
---
I've been playing Spell Hunter ever since KnC came out and now people tell me I'm some garbage meta hunter player lol
---
While Nintendo still has a very good reputation, they haven't adapted very well to the "always-online" world that we live in now.
---
&gt;But not as bad as uninteractive combo decks.  
---
Just as uninteractive minus the combo.    
---
&gt;But at least those are better than braindead aggro decks.  
---
Aggro decks are great matchups and at least offer some interaction.  
---
&gt;But at least thats not just mindles midrange arena curvestone  
---
Even better matchups offering even more interaction and trading.  
---
&gt;But as we all know the true archetype for real intelligent hearthstone lovers are control decks...  
---
Control decks are not fun nor interactive to play against, give me the variety of hunter decks to match against any day.

How does encountering Paladins and Hunters on ladder mean the game is for whales? Odd Paladin has been pretty cheap all year long and several Hunter archetypes are cheap as well.
---
I find it confusing when people refer to themselves in the third person, confusing still when they admit exactly what was wrong with them in that same sentence. But I do must agree, nothing so far that you’ve said has been anywhere close to ingenious. 
---
Keep trying, buddy.

Better luck next time.

Shoulda played faster.

I mean it makes sense since my opponents always get huffer. 100% huffer spawn rate against me. When I try to get huffer, 0.1%.

man I will probably get hated for this but pirate warrior was a lot of fun and probably the strongest deck I've ever played.
