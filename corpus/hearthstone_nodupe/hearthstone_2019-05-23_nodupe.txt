What a sad day.
---
---
---
I had it happen on XR. I just deleted the app and reinstalled it. It worked for me, maybe try it?
---
I could play 4 more pogos and and have a full board
---
Surrender to madness would be fun tho
---
I got the same thing happening to me on day 1. Restarting the game, reinstalling, and playing on a different device do nothing. Just gotta wait for blizz to release a patch for it.
---
What about if we don‚Äôt play on pc?
---
I just deleted the app. Clearly isn't a high priority to blizzard so I'm not going to waste time posting on their forums and everywhere else (especially not here since people just downvote it) so I give up. There's other games out there
---
I packed a golden elysiana do you think its worth it for me to DE to get that juicy 3200 dust?
---
Tf. I‚Äôm on a train I can‚Äôt reinstall!  Wtf blizzard
---
That is your opinion and you are entitled to it. But that is the game design reason given.
---

---
Personally I think it is valid.
---
Playing since BRM, 0 Pyroblast smh
---
180, not 540. They don't treat each pairing of hero power and deck as a unique combination. So if you finish with Recipe A and Hero Power #1, Recipe A will be checked off no matter what Hero Power you select when going back to that chapter as that character.
---
So, you'd have to play 4 runs at minimum to get all Hero Power and Recipe checkmarks for a specific character and chapter. Multiply by 9 to make it all characters for a set chapter, then by 5 for the number of chapters.
---
4*5*9 = 180
---
Coming back after... a... a while. Any advice for someone who's sort of new again? I think I last played around the time either Kobolds and Catacombs or Mean Streets of Gadgetzan came out(whichever is more recent).
---
I do have Zayle's Shadow Cloak, so that dos give me a few recent decks to fiddle with, but I'm having some trouble remembering how to build my own(playing a lot of MtG in the time between has also muddled up my skill at it).
---
Do aggro decks still exist? I keep having 15-20 minute matches with priest and shaman and going until someone dies due to fatigue, which makes me think either I'm having weird matches or using a wonky deck.
---
It is a big app, so maybe reinstall when you get off the train and somewhere with a good connection
---
Fair, but force tank is still probably better there because of the Divine shield. I think oblivitron will summon any mech from hand, not just deathrattle ones.
---
Getting paid to donate plasma?
---
It isn't, you're just drawing your 1 drops on turn 2
---
It is still very much playable. Remember when rogues ran two coins? Well prep is much better than coins.
---
It's a terrible reason. The UI literally explains all keywords. It's a bad reason.
---
Kurama007#1219 80g quest trade NA
---
Do you have a decklist for thief rogue?
---
Underrated card in my opinion. You can‚Äôt undervalue ‚Äúmagnetize‚Äù in this meta. Works superbly against Token Druids. Magnetizing deathrattle mechs can change the tempo drastically. I liked Animal Companion, but running all-Mech deck(with exceptions of Defender of Argus, Harrison Jones and Leeroy Jenkins) it works much better for me.
---
I know. It‚Äôs just stupid that App Store doesn‚Äôt have an update and that I have to totally reinstall to get it to work.
---
It literally took me one minute to figure out what the difference is between these images. I should get some rest.
---
It‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt have better player/developer relations and relay time and time again a same message like a bot.
---
‚ÄúHE KNOWS NOTH-INK‚Äù!!!
---
A hand full of 4 mana 12 12 lich kings qorks rather decently
---
Quick, someone tell me the cost/stats/abilities of both bolvars without looking it up. I think its impossible.
---
Would at least make your draws slightly better for the rest of the game
---
I wouldn't say so. Nearly every tech card produced is almost never used. There were times that not even Swamp Ooze was used and that's straight baseline stats. The way HS ranking works, teching just isn't beneficial to the overall climb.
---
I just got my reward today of 100 gold for collecting all classic cards.
---
Actually did get 2 of those from Archivist as Shaman in the control matchup. Poor warrior didn‚Äôt see it coming, especially with Shudderwok clearing the board again.
---
Upvoted for invisibility
---
That‚Äôs why I stopped playing lol, but maybe the next patch will spice things up a bit I‚Äôll probably come back for a couple weeks before I get bored again and the new top dog deck is everywhere
---
Tempo is basically every turn you want to drop a thing and kill uour oppnent‚Äôs thing, actively fighting for board each turn. Common examples are backstab si, killing a thing/things and putting a 3/3, wagglepick corsair, whacking something and getting a 3/3, and pretty much sap + any minion or prep + spells + minions. 
---
Miracle decks are characterized by having explosive turns which they completely flip the board or play a ton if cards in one turn, which generally requires cards like auctioneer, luna, apprentices, lyra etc. These turns generally require some sort of resource buildup, like drawing cards beforehand with ai or maybe getting coins with gilded gargoyle or tomb pillager. 
---
These are pretty general archetypes, and decks can have a good deal of overlap, think of how cards like apprentice, prep, and sap fit into both ideas.
---
What if it was 5 mana 3-3 Battlecry: Silence and destroy a Mech.
---
There's no such thing as "panic disenchant". Unless you plan to play it right now, you SHOULD disenchant it, because there's literally no reason not to.
---
I thought you only get full credit for the first 2?
---
Everyone shares a card in Zilliax
---
*cries in tempo rogue*
---
Ah, thanks. Bathroom math isn't my strong suit lol
---
shooting the screen
---
I guess it's true this is just educated guesses, so there's no point in further discussing this point until we see the full extent of the nerfs.
---
Although going by the early data, Elysiana's deck winrate has increased to an all time high after the nerfs.
---
The hunter quest at 0 mana and double battlecries was hilarious
---
What deck did you use? Im using big shaman. Im rank 8 right now.
---
I think people choose the decks they enjoy but with heavy influence of how fun they are. I played tempo rogue over token druid and control warrior because of the memes I could pull off with Togwaggle's treasures and turn 7 Nomi's. I'm gonna try for some less-meta, meme decks now like thief rogue bit I can't imagine it being as good as it was before rotation :(
---
Dust and repeat
---
Druid took the biggest dip of the century from having like 22 tier 1 decks to 0, and it took 5 months for them to come back with token Druid (which is their only prospect)
---
Man I could never handle so many deck slots and new players can't either!
---
I had this issue earlier and just had to delete the app and download again from the App Store
---
I got a similar thing with "your spells cost health". Got my archmage anantios to cost zero mana and killed the final boss on turn 1.
---
Ahh i see. Thanks for the ideas guys. Ill think of doing that myself. Im sitting on a few thousand dust as is right now so wouldnt need to always dust anyways.
---
Hell yeah brother, cheers from Iraq!
---
Had set so both Antonidas and auctioneer were always in my hand turn 1 so that plus quest meant pretty much instant board control
---
I used Tempo Rogue, the last games were post-nerf and I didn‚Äôt have any of the legendaries. A better bet would probably be anything that can counter Bomb Hunter, I‚Äôve heard post-nerf it‚Äôs being played more.
---
The statue golem guy
---
Makes sense.  'Murloc Muncher' is good for a generic minion, not as much for a legendary.
---
Only if you're absolutely confident that at no point over the next two years you'd like to play a control deck.
---
Although if you're one legendary off a meta deck, then I'd agree that it's the correct decision.
---
i beat  mech hunter today with my autocomplete rogue deck :P
---
Warlocks could do that for over a year now. It wasn't a big deal. (WW echo legendary plus portal up plus skater boy)
---
Hmm I may try this I need baron though to make it really viable
---
If only they made decent rogue cards that could compete with the evergreens.
---
Elemental wrath baby. Let those fire flies wreak havoc!
---
A movie you should probably see now available on Netflix
---
I've still yet to get arthas.
---
That guy had no personality
---
When I saw this, for the first time in my life, I got an erection.
---
I mean, again, that's stupidly far off when I just throw out 32 neutral mechs - it's not like the class discover bonus is 500 times more likely or anything.
---
Anyway, 1 extra is what I said (sometimes 0, sometimes 2-3). Assuming you find both OA, Boom and hit the Delivery Drone twice (takes about 10 turns after Boom). Which isn't the case in the vast majority of games against anything but control.
---
The app from the store is only the first result, the .exe isn't related to it.
---
It honestly feels super rushed. Between missing/incorrect voicelines and buffs not working correctly, it's like they completely skipped QA.
---
These spot the lethal puzzles are getting so hard. Can someone explain to me?
---
2/3 less or 1/3 as much would make more sense than 1/3 less.
---
Conjuring 4 mana cost when?
---
He can almost craft big rush warrior.
---
Truly these are confusing times.
---
I think it's complaining about OP taking a photograph of a monitor instead of taking a screenshot.
---
This is a good way to play, don't worry too much about min/max your dust.
---
‚õè HOW LONG ‚õè CAN THIS ‚õè GO ON ‚õè
---
Congrats! I‚Äôm still stuck on Warrior üò≠
---
Like shit i got my first golde nlegend and i started playing a couple months after launch. It was goblins vs gnomes off arena...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Flame Leviathan. Worst golden legend ever
---
I played better the week I installed(rag cardback) than now. I get so agitated by the clunky animations that I make sloppy mistakes that I instantly realize. Having to hoover over the cards to know what they do actually distracted me from how horribly the game is implemented XD
---
Playing since GvG. No such luck.
---
It's conjurer fucking mage that is terrible to play against
---
I've been playing on and off since 2015 and still have not gotten a golden legendary. I've packed a golden epic and countless legendaries, but I would love to just get 1600 dust just like that.
---
I disenchanted this card
---
Why is this getting down voted? üòÇ
---
I hate land screw or land flood...
---
&gt; three times more
---
It isn't red though.
---
Wow! Nice!
---
I‚Äôve been playing consistently since 2015, I don‚Äôt spend a ton of money but I get the presale on most packs. I pulled my first golden legendary last week
---
Why mention that it's "post-nerf" ?
---
*adjusts nerd-glasses*
---
Um actually...
---
F12 is the Steam hotkey for screenshots. Hearthstone uses the Print Screen button.
---
*exit nerd mode*
---
Wow! How in the ever loving fuck did u get that?
---
Come to think of it. The 9 mana should've been obvious. (i thought it wouldn't be.) This was my 1st game after nerf and I wanted to try if Elisiana was still viable.
---
I‚Äôm getting the same problem on mobile. PC works fine though.
---
Edwin will always be good, and leeroy fits into every aggro deck ever. Only the myras is really in danger of not finding a home
---
I would assume 12pm ct
---
Yes, but 2 card combos and 4 card combos are very different beasts.  
---
That said, I feel like they really need to look and decided if they just want to turn SN1P SN4P into a twinspell minion or something.. or at least make it inherently the case that echo cards can't go below 1 in value.
---
Do you think so? In ladder I agree absolutely, it seems like a 5 mana Golakka Crawler, even though people can get greedy with magnetizes every once in a while.
---
However, how is it in specialist format? People are already running "side-decks" with 2x BGH versus things like Giants mage. This card could see play there without an issue, and buffing it to 4 mana might make it too oppressive  especially with the mech buffs coming.
---
Hehe also had a golden prep, 1600 dust for it felt NICE! I did DE my Elysiana though, can just craft it back when I need it!
---
Dusted 2 preparation 2 days before the nerf announcements. Im triggered.
---
Updated and match logging screen looks a lot better now. 
---
Just a suggestion maybe to change the toggle to plain Won / Lost or Win /  Loss. When selecting who won right now  it reads Player Did Win in both Defeat / Victory which might be confusing. 
---
Thanks anyway I‚Äôll use it more after the update.
---
It‚Äôs my home wifi without firewalls so I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs not working.
---
59% and counting apparently.  https://hsreplay.net/cards/#text=zilliax
---
Guess the people running this deck didn't get the memo...
---
https://hsreplay.net/decks/ZX1K16v7ZCe4LQYhjw69uh/    
---
From https://hsreplay.net/cards/49184/zilliax#tab=recommended-decks which I think could be broken as I've had issue with that page in the past only listing 1 page worth of decks. Still good enough to find a zoolock with 51% and 32K games under the belt.  
---
Incidentally that makes it the 2nd most popular zoolock deck though a bit down on winrate over the traditional deck as it stands.
---
Yea but the meta has already changed, what match-up does it help against? Only other warriors right?
---
You may know this already, but if you type ‚Äòextra‚Äô into the search bar of your collection, it will only show up cards that you have more than 2 of.

They are pushing mechs harder than ever so no. He will rotate and that shall be that.  
---
Personally I'm already sick of magnetic mechs so not looking forward to some of these buffs.
---
Upvote for doctor boom
---
Why definitely? 
---
Warrior has been performing well since the nerfs, so if anything she'll rise.
---
Just one piece of advice. Try pressing Windows + Shift + S and see what happens...
---
But what ‚Äúnew playstiles‚Äù? Pogo maybe?
---
unfortunately, all the nerfs made the cards weaker, but not BAD.  Miscreant should still be in nearly every standard rogue.  Raiding party is still a 4 mana draw 3.  Prep is still a solid tempo play.  While you are correct you should DE if not using them, none of these magically became so bad you wouldn't want them in your rogue deck.
---
You gotta wait for the meta to settle my guy people probably forgot there were 6 other classes in the game during the last meta
---
Rank 15 ... what do you expect really?
---
No, the only deck limit i think is that you can only have 60 cards your deck at once
---
And we continue the nake rogue cards unplayable..
---
Cheers to a 1 Mana backstab and a 3 damage 3 coat evis in a few months!
---
meanwhile mages are making 16/16's on turn 4
---
Lol let's buff millhouse so only the first spell next turn is free.
---
People played (*3 mana*) BGH just for Dr. Boom
---
You don't think they'd play E.M.P. for Ziliax if it was cheaper?
---
Have been a lazy player and my highest rank is just 4. Net goal is to collect all the classic cards :) thanks guys.
---
You just win 1^(st) prize of the slot machine.

Nope just kidding 0/1 its a *fuckin* frog

---
I agree coulda gotten something better than Harrison but nozdormu is sweet!
---
And I thought I was doing well with my 12!
---
Nothing like turning a steaming pile of commons into an epic!
---
&gt; obviously played winrate doesn't say anything about the power level of cards that are usually only played for lethal.
---
Oh, so you are capable of critical thinking?
---
That's good. Maybe then you'll realise that played winrate isn't the be-all and end-all of a card's power level.
---
&gt; so what point do you think you're making with your false premise that "played winrate always correlates to how OP a card is",
---
I was using your ridiculous logic and applying it to a different situation to show you how it's ridiculous.
---
And it worked.
---
&gt; something i didn't say 
---
No, you just ignored deck inclusion rate entirely and went straight for played win rate as the sole determining factor even though any superficial look at that statistic shows you that good and powerful cards don't always have the best played winrates.
---
&gt; the desperation to "win" at the expense of responding honestly to the facts in front of you is as sickening as it is self-defeating.
---
A fact is, it sees play in nearly 60% of decks.
---
That is a fact you choose to ignore. It's one you obviously choose to ignore when you go to the played winrate and then say:
---
&gt; says all that needs to be said about how not out of whack it's power level is.
---
So yes, if you want to hinge your entire thought process on played winrate, go right ahead.
---
Pyroblast needs to be 11 Mana, in that case.
---
But you've clearly shown you're not that stupid.
---
So, don't be so desperate to win that you knowingly use stupid arguments. It's self-defeating.
---
Thanks.
---
So I played murloc shaman just now and got to a point where my board was full and I got the turn your minions to legendary minions spell card through hagathe. 
---
Now after using that I noticed that the tess I got had 1 attack and 6 Health. 
---
Is there a reason for that or was that a bug? 
---
There were no attack reducing cards used!
---
After buffing everyone with bloodlust she suddenly had 9 attack.
---
I‚Äôd be so happy, free dust!

1 Mana Spell - "Discover a quest reward."
---
He was mistaken for the violent warden.
---
Nah, he could have used a Simulacrum earlier in the game and then just played Zola for the hell of it. A little less viable than this strat, but still playable.
---
GRAND CHAMPION!
---
Sorry no real answer for the deck as I am new aswell but there is hearthstone for Smartphones and tablets aswell so if you want to play you probably can! :D
---
I do appreciate that they edited the arms to be consistent with other magnetic mechs
---
F
---
it's because after the norman invasion a majority of the upperclasses were of french stock and they were also the people with access to the stuff that would go on to define language - after the 1100s what could be considered old english (a lot of which at the time was very similar to norse, no prizes for guessing which invasion that might be due to) was phrased out in favour of language that, as you say, leaned more heavily on french/latin roots.

obviously, when arguments stop, accuse of whining. i should be actually glad i got you to step down from that faked civility you normally post here with

&gt;So they've already gotten their money's worth out of you.
---
yes, that's how it works /s. hs devs must be so glad players that only want to excuse their behavior dont actually make strategic decisions, because revenue is down no matter what your excuse is, but you think it is ok for players that were buying stuff from them simply stop.
---
\&gt;  you jumped ship 
---
see, exactly from a playbook, what number of fake argument is that? stupid excuses about "nostalgia" run out, have to accuse opponent of not playing the game, only still being on the subreddit bashing devs. oh, poor devs, that some players are not 100% ok with everything they do.

hey, mister common sense 101, no other whale stopped paying, but 50% less revenue is because nostalgia, right?

It's as sad as post-nerf Patches screaming "Yaaarrrggg"
---
So are they gonna remove the prep tax on the cards too?
---
there's not enough time even on PC to pull this off
---
also why would you want this hotfixed, without the time restriction any deck with two mechwarpers and a zola'd mechwarper along with literally any mech on the board can OTK you in wild
---
Which is really stupid by the way, because a considerable amount of warrior mirrors end before the second Elysiana.
---
Nope because I want to keep her Golden. I crafted her day 1 in Golden alongside few other Legendaries because I loved the card effect, and despite not even using it that much I still want to keep it.
---
I appreciated time and effort you put on this.
---
Note to self: try to draft a copy of the darkness before trying the swampqueen trick.
---
We need a card type that can get stronger based on how much mana you want to use on it.
---
I want to know too
---
Seems fine.
---
We already know, its GRUUL
---
What great options...
---
June 3rd
---
Looks like a potential wow boss.
---
&gt;Blizzard confirmed they would not be modifying already-existing cards to have the updated keyword because the mechanics are not completely identical to Echo. 
---
&gt; I don't get the reasoning behind this.
---
Its easy. First reason they said at that post is, that repeteable this turn and echo work diferent with certain interactions. For most of the normal gameplay interactions they might be the same but not when combined with things like zuljin/yogg or similar. Just like charged devilsaur ability is the same as rush but doesnt work as rush, and specific interactions with recruit and summon from hand effects is what allowed deathrattle hunter to exist, while if he had rush it would not be possible.
---
Second reason they stated in other posts is that echo is a mechanic in the year of the raven. Once it rotates, if the year of the dragon has a card with echo (like witch brew) then it would probably be the only echo card in the entire year. This could confuse players that see there is a keyword, but that its not even used outside of that card. They said they can consider making it evergreen or something if they ever decide to make many more cards with that effect (like with lifesteal or poisonous) but since its not the case, they are okey with calling it "*repeteable this turn*" in this specific card. In the case of SNIP SNAP, it has echo, but it could have *repeteable this turn* if he didnt have so much text already. Since he could nto have all those effects wihtout using the keyword, they used it. They can use it eventhough its outside of WW expansion since its from the same year (year of the raven), but probably they would have used *repeteable this turn* if the text effect wasnt that long.
---
So, everything is consistent as what they have been saying since WW expansion.
---
Sheesh that's some bug.
---
maybe its more that the design team has finally changed enough since brode era they can actually get these things through
---
Problem is, it just feels terrible to play against. If there is turn five (or even turn four with coin) and the priest has some sort of board there is a chance you are just dead with no counterplay. Compared to other degenerate combos (e.g. Raza, Shadowreaper Anduin) this one is a lot cheaper and more consistent to pull (Two Epics, and a legendary that gets tutored turn 2 or 3)
---
Even the Shudderwock combo required more set up and that one got nerfed, so I'm pretty confident this will no doubt be getting the hammer. I already tried discussing in another comment how I would like to get [the interaction fixed without actually getting Reckless Experimenter nerfed for no reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/brdxwq/comment/eod5xgw)
---
in the risk of being dumb for asking this, what is the origin of that meme ?
---
Blizzard isn't the only company that needs to crackdown on the windows store. There's some straight up copy paste stuff in there.
---
you get slightly less packs than you would with gold - if you like pve then its worth , if you dont it isnt.
---
if you pay with actual money its definitely worth because of how its priced.
---
But it can‚Äôt summon a 7/7 and destroy one of your minions when it dies.
---
Having busted treasure combos almost requiered for beating harder bosses. And later wings gonna be harder.
---
"I wonder what this does."
---
Heal druid will probably be tier 2 next expansion where they will print more cards to support it. Right now its not that bad if u get your combo off but needs early support. Nourish and wild growth nerfs also killed druid late game as a whole
---
Congrats my poker cards aren't that good.
---
hearthstone is very regularly in the top 5-6 what are you on about?
---
Okey then, if you have the dust to spare.
---
I am just too used to seeing people say stuff like "im gonna craft luncentbark golden because heal druid looks fun" and then "this game is too expensive wtf I need to pay just to have 1 meta deck", so I just wanted to give the obvious advice of dust management. Golden elysiana does look gorgeous though!
---
This dungeon reeks with magic!
---
Needs more Lava Burst.
---
i don¬¥t think echo magnetized minions will work like that for long, at least if this impacts standard.
---
The 5 minute snapshot is probably the most useless feature on the entire hsreplay website.
---
I had one play prep, counterfeit coin, pass last night, so I assume they are just morons.
---
Holy dust, this card is so good.
---
except you can't pull off the OTK because the animations don't allow it
---
She's a keeper!

it rotates out of arena on the third

Ok, this deviated from the mean a bit, by 4 damage. But how were you expecting to get back into the game from this point, anyway? I see nothing on your hand which has much of a chance to kill the opponent.
---
Yeah, I know. But I spend a lot of money on the game and always craft several Golden Legendaries each expansion!
---
How about: "Deal 15 damage split across all minions, freeze them. If minion is already frozen deal no damage to it".
---
I think you mean counter to mind control
---
There should just be a toggle that lets you choose if you want to play vs meta decks or not, where meta deck is defined as anything in the top 3 tiers of Hsreplay tier list IMHO.
---
Ohhhh i see, yeah that‚Äôs a good idea, although I haven‚Äôt really been keeping track of how many of each class I vs. but I do vs a lot of mage and a lot of warrior. Maybe I‚Äôll chuck a 2nd deadly in mine too. Thanks for you help

slightly off topic, does anyone know how to calculate the odds of drawing a single card (of which you do not possess 2 copies, say  a legendary like keleseth) in the mulligan phase? with and without coin?

going on a losing streak from rng or only facing your hard-counter going from 4/5 Star Rank 6 with Win Streak and dropping all the way back down to almost 10 really demoralizes someone, ya know?

This has been posted several times, it does not work on solo adventures.

Except it pretty clearly is a year of the raven mechanic, even if it didn't show up in other sets before.  It's a keyword constrained to the year of the raven and rotates with the rest of them.

Some heroic boss used the spell that vanishes his own board, letting me put him on 3 health. Next turn he plays  vanish, and that wasn't a top deck... I won't buy this expansion as it was just so stupid to play.

That solves very little. You'll have your pogos, it's not about having pogos in small numbers. It's about comboing them that will win you the game.
---
Fair enough then I agree with that. I personally keep all common and rare goldens that I find, but epics/legendaries depend on how interesting they are. Gold Far Sight went in the bin, but a golden Muckmorpher is a keeper.

You can craft whizbang on your main account. Please be aware that whizbang is craftable only when you get to rank 25.

This was my preorder golden legendary and I'm torn.
---
On one hand, it always makes sense to dust nerfed cards because you could always recraft it for no loss, and I've never used it anyway. On the OTHER hand, I think it's one of my favorite golden cards and I think it's weak/situational enough that I'll have trouble justifying recrafting it later, so dusting it feels pretty permanent.
---
what bot, is there a sub for pics that warm my hearth? It seems that this indeed is thewrong sub

Is it even possible to get that much dust as f2p? I managed to scarpe some dust for a decent shaman deck, other than that i'm climbing with whizbangs shitty decks.

Makes sense. You ping the creature. It marks it as "getting damaged by heropower" and by acidmaw. When the creature dies it will summon  a water elemental since it was marked by hthe heropower

I don‚Äôt really think Hearthstones ladder mechanic really directly equates to the skill of the players at a particular rank. This is just my observation. What typically happens to me is I‚Äôll end up on something like level 9 when the season ends that kicks you down to 11. I‚Äôve been rattling around in the 15-5 territory lately and I‚Äôve found that the games are MUCH more competitive in 10-15 especially lately. So you kind of get stuck in this quagmire of good players caught in the same trap, and people with meme decks / off meta jenk that pops off occasionally due to RNG killing streak potential.

I definitely would like to add a search field. It‚Äôs on my todo. In the meantime, the fastest way to create decklists is to import them.

Yeah, it's a bug that's already been reported [in the official forums](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/game-stuck-after-shifting-scroll-secret/6220/2) a few days ago. It has to do with chameleos and/or shifting scrolls copying cards and leaving the game hung (immediate task termination and reconnection seems to fix it most of the times).
---
Its a gold card that GIVES YOU 10 NEW GOLD CARDS JERRY!! ITS GOLD JERRY!
---
That statement is just plain wrong, 99% of warrior decks bring at least one bounce for Elysiana
---
itll still be +15dmg burst, doesnt need to be OTK. And the combo with mech squire+experimenter+snip snap would make it so it'll still be a huge body at end of turn, so you have to deal wit it or be TTK
---
not the hundreds of pounds worth of cards
---
mobile is such a mess
---
It‚Äôs a 2 card OTK‚Äî just 1 Reckless Experimenter makes this cost 0. So past turn 4, if you ever leave a mech up you lose the game. Hardly ‚Äúmore time than Glinda mechwarper‚Äù.

They wont give more deck slots, but they may take them away!!

BE REBORN IN THE CURSE

Should I craft Zayle as well or is Whizbang superior then Zayle?

If all he has is 1-2 drops, the game won't last past turn 5.

Sorry I didn‚Äôt read the rules. Thank you!
---
Yet, it will only let me have 1

I've had the most success with Mana cheating, with the one that randomizes Mana cost or the one that makes the left most card cost 2 less. Also had success with the all minions +1/+1.
---
They all have rust with rocket boots! I absolutely loved this interaction.
---
&gt;like you agree that he is at least a contender for top with those 2 
---
No, I wouldn't. Out of the twelve hero cards, it would maybe rank fifth after Deathstalker Rexxar, Frost Lich Jaina, Bloodreaver Gul'Dan, and Shadowreaper Anduin each in their own respective times.
---
Drop Spirit Echo, Doomhammer, Primalfin, etc., add more neptulons instead
---
One time I got rogue dk power and cast over powered twice, on the second one he cast it again. That turn got incredibly out of hand
---
I thought is was a common occurrence. It happened to me probably in \~10% of my runs with different bosses.
---
I fill the 18 slots constantly without paying money because many of my decks just aren't optimized. If you make homebrewed decks, theres plenty of potential for new fun strategies.
---
You and me both mate. I think ill quit the game for a while. It was the only deck i had fun with

First Aid is definitely the pick here...

My last heroic run Khadgar carried my ass on a couple of games that were all but doomed. 
---
  
---
Although he really liked to same my totems from death and put them into the deck again. thx I guess.
---
Currently, I have 1 deck for each class in each format. I'd like to at least get 9 more slots.
---
Reason being is that I fight my friends a lot, and use the share decks feature so they can play actual decks against me and it's a lot more fun that way.
---
I have played Heroic so far yeah. And i'm sorry if you don't like it bug RNG is still the main factor. Why do I need to write everything 3 times? You gotta get lucky with the cards you get offered, you need to get lucky with the treasures you get offered and you need to get lucky with the result of your choices. 
---
I wanna see you consistently beat heroic mode with the worst chocies possible. It's just like arena. The best arena players in the game often failed cause of a god awful deck. "skill" (if you can even speak of that word in hearthstone) only gets you that far.

Different brawls appeal to different people.  Personally I dislike just about all constructed brawls, but I also know that plenty of people dislike the crossroad style ones just as much.  And I LOVE Crossroad brawls.

It's amazing, T2 being able to pump out Zombeasts or Horsemen, even Water Elementals.
---
Almost guaranteed win for a lot of the runs
---
My first or second hunter deck got the elexir that shuffles 2 1 cost copies of minions you play into your deck. I only picked \[\[ursatron\]\]s after that and won the run easily with infinite 3/3 boards and deck
---
&gt; Oh you must be new to Hearthstone PvE Content
---
I am playing since beta, so I am well aware how bullshit heroic used to be. Even with copying the most upvoted, most cheesy decks by others, you had to try some bosses a million times to get the necessary cards before it is too late.
---
But dungeon runs are entire different beasts. While it still remains a card game, thus has RNG, it is nowhere near az unfair as old heroics used to be, and if you make an effort to construct the right deck and pick the right artifacts, then it is not hard. And even if you don't get the most overpowered artifacts, you can still play around the ones you chose, ie. if you pick the 2 mana echo card which transforms your minions into random legendaries, then you can aim to flood the board with minions as your win condition. Now, if you pick that treasure and then keep picking 7-10 mana legendaries for your deck, then yes, you will lose.
---
The problem is, you sound way too burnt out, and while I understand why, as I still have 'nam flashbacks of unnerfed undertakers, buzzards and jades, the new solo adventures have a lot of player agency. It is delusional to think that you can't beat them, jsut by pure luck. It doesn't even require too much thinking, ie. you pick toggwaggle's dice, then you obviously go for high cost minions. You should also opt for the Candles and Toggwagg, as they are amazing boardclears, and they got your deck covered for swarmy bosses (2x2/2 treants, totem girl), without picking 5-6 flamestrikes or so.
---
Now of course, if you are not aware of these things, or just too proud to pick a boring "deal 3/4 damage to all enemies", because another treasure sounds more fancier, then by all means, but you are just falling into a noob trap*. The answer is not RNG, it is knowing your bosses and your artifacts. Hell, you can now even backtrack on your mistakes on the bar, something you could have never done before.
---
*of course, if you just want to have fun, then I can totally understand picking a fun artifact like golden candle, and I am totally cool with that. Just don't blame RNG when it won't win you the run.

That actually doesn't sound that strong... You need to wait at least until Turn 5 to be able to play Hagatha + Horror every turns. Maybe if you had a couple Elemental Destruction or Volcano or something, but I feel like this simply was hard carried by Robe of Gaudiness being completely busted.

Yep, it was! It kept my Dagwiks alive, for longer, and it saved me as well!

The average HS player is a terrible, terrible casual. You aren't able to beat the average player. Do the math.

mana cheating, perma rush, good spells... there are more than a couple ways to do it really. It's just that as with other "Dungeon Run"-style adventures, you need an unfair advantage to deal with unfair advantages.

Well well! Where is that bullshit excuse that "Echo" was exclusive to Witchwood?

Big Game Hunter has exactly the same stat/cost ratio.  6 stats for (5).

As a returning player, who has no cards of the current year but has the classic set nearly complete, is it a good idea to invest in mechs? The new freebie legend seems pretty strong. What are some key cards to craft?

At least you get the first turn. Usually when I get her it is from evolving or summoning a random minion where you get no benefit.

It's good advice regardless.  You'll get far more decks out of your dust if you finish the ones you're already close to completing rather than picking a deck you saw and building it from scratch.
---
Personally I don't think OTK is gonna happen because they'll change the card. Even if it's not a true OTK it's still not really helpful for the game to hit for 20 damage or whatever it is in one turn.
---
Then you get the blade storm power and you're like, well this is... Ok
---
No problem. Enjoy it!
---
Yes
---
There's plenty of 3 mana 3/4 tech cards, but they're usually class cards. That's usually in decks that don't want to play different/any 3 drops though.
---
You can craft cards with dust.  
---
And cards have a certain value and those values have different dust cost:
---
Common(white):  40 dust.  
---
Rare(blue): 100 dust.  
---
Epic(purple): 400 dust.  
---
Legendary(orange): 1600 dust.
---
And those values have refund cost: 
---
Common(white):  5 dust.  
---
Rare(blue): 20 dust.  
---
Epic(purple): 100 dust.  
---
Legendary(orange): 400 dust.
---
And every card has a golden  variant that have a higher cost  and refund value (if you are new  don't craft these).  
---
Btw:

r/dontdeadopeninside
---
&gt; A tech card is not usable with ANY deck, any class.
---
This applies to literally any card.
---
You're again not making a strong case.
---
&gt; That's the point of a tech card, is to directly counter some specific decks. There's almost always a chance for MCT to have value.
---
The same for E.M.P Operative, but you seem to be selectively splitting hairs.
---
&gt; If your opponent doesn't have 1 of 2 Mech decks, the card drastically goes down in value.
---
The same can be said for MC Tech.
---
&gt; Yes, you can say that "well, Zilliax is in a lot of decks", okay, and? Zilliax isn't some unstoppable threat 
---
Because "unstoppable threat" is the barrier for which a counter card must be run and for it to be considered "tech"?
---
I guess Acidic Swamp/Gluttonous Ooze has never *ever* been used as a tech card, then? 
---
You tell me to get my head out of my ass, but you're the one using these ridiculous arguments.
---
Oh, and FYI: Weapon destruction very often only snaps away "half the value." 
---
&gt; If they're Magnetizing, that means they're running 1 of 2 decks you're teching against.
---
One of three. Again, this is future tense because we're considering the *very near* future of a meta with buffed cards.
---
I don't see why you choose to ignore that. Well, unless you're seriously intent on being *that* disingenuous. In which case, get your head out of your ass.
---
&gt; so you're not fooling anyone by trying to factually say something unpredictable.
---
I never tried to state it as a fact. You can continue to use the least charitable reading possible, but all you've done is make me clarify again and again *and again* where you're either being ignorant or being woefully poor at interpretation or understanding.
---
So, for the third time in a single comment. Get your head out of your ass.
---
There are three powerful contending Mech-oriented decks that can come through over the next meta. Paladin, Hunter, Warrior. Beyond that, Zilliax sees a lot of play. I don't even care to speculate what a Combo Mech Priest would look like, though I can say with a good degree of safety that Coppertail Imposter would be an easy turn-around on E.M.P Operative even if the latter card were buffed to be only three Mana. So that's a moot-ish point.
---
Even so, three decks. Plus the ubiquity of Zilliax. Three decks is a lot depending on their collective popularity. And when E.M.P Operative is able to be played as a 3 Mana 3/3 -- just like Gluttonous Ooze or MC Tech -- it stops being a "Tech card" in this meta, and is just a good card. In the case that Mech Hunter/Warrior/Paladin are prominent, and *especially* in the case that they are some of the strongest decks in the meta, E.M.P Operative is as much of a tech as BGH was in Goblins vs Gnomes.
---
As in, it isn't. It's just a solid card all round by that point.
---
Now, you can keep your head in your ass and act like I see myself as some farseer, or you can take the explicit confirmation that this is just an opinion on the chin, stop ignoring extremely valid *and relevant* points I've raised, and stop trying to utilise awful arguments.
---
If you want, anyway.
---
But I've said all I've wanted and needed to say on the matter. So if you're not inclined to do that, I'll just have nothing more to say.
---
Judging from this subreddit I'm sure the "Wondrous Wisdomball" will find a way to make you lose a game.
---
Sn1p-Sn4p will be part of the Boomsday Project and will rotate with it, so it will rotate at the same time as Witchwood. 
---
Witch‚Äôs Brew will rotate after Witchwood so it seems Blizzard is ok with using Echo outside of Witchwood as long as it will always be in standard the same time as Witchwood.
---
So can I not get Zayle without paying money? When I try to unlock the full adventure, it only gives me the dollar option, not the gold one?!

I've literally used him twice and went 8/8 both times... he is a golden God. With that 100% anecdotal evidence, how could anyone deny his affection?
---
I got him too in golden. Love the deck
---
Today I was on the last boss of chapter 2. I had two fireballs and 1 health left. Boss had 9 health. I cast the first fireball to his face and look in horror as another one starts flying right at my face without me casting anything. As I died and the screen faded away, Khadgar appeared and spoke his last words.
---
"I am gonna cast that again. AT A RANDOM TARGET!"
---
I've had that happen to Blizzard but then when I played it, it did the damage four times so not too bad I guess.

Thanks, [Captain Obvious](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/6mda1q/the_captain_of_the_day/)!
---
Yes this system is needed to remind people thay this is actually a multiplayer game and some people appreciate or hate the actions or decks you play
---
Good thing or bad thing? Did not understand. 
---
Did you come from rank 50?
---
Exactly lol. The most I've seen is like explosive shot or something.
---
The day I spend money on reddit, you will be the first to get an award
---
I love it man, I love the card art
---
Not to mention there are several kinds of carts, dessert carts, fish carts etc. I feel like this was just put in to make the 'random modifier' runs a bit harder if you get this on one of the other wings.
---
It‚Äôs a lot less misleading than a rating system where you have to filter out junk votes. 
---
The data from play rates can also presumably get them data on quest clears, time played, etc to get a good idea how truly popular a brawl is.
---
Got a gold Pyro. lulz

&gt; Just because you can't see a reason for doing something does not mean there isn't a good reason.
---
No I understand the reason, and the logic behind their reasoning was sound but the end-result arguably didn't seem to justify it. They've since contradicted their original reasoning and now their new updated reasoning is so niche that it doesn't really seem like it's much of an argument at this point - it's just not justified anymore. The whole "we don't want only one card with a keyword" argument is what they're saying now, because they threw out the old "we only want to use new keywords in the set they were designed for". My point isn't that they're contradicting their current logic, it's that they've thrown out their previous limitations with keywords before and they could very easily just do it again for the sake of consistency.
---
&gt; Discover is a mechanic they tend to use a little of each set, so highly unlikely. 
---
And that wasn't always their plan. People liked it so much and it had such a good effect on the game that they kept it past LoE. Again, that's literally my point.
---
&gt; Not sure why you are bringing up buff cards. That has nothing to do with  the original question, and is irrelevant to reason for not using echo  on witches brew. 
---
Of course it's relevant. I'm discussing PRECEDENT. The devs have changed their minds on very fundamental design choices. Buffs have literally never happened and they have never given us the impression that they would ever happen until now, and in fact they have said they preferred sticking to only nerfs and if a card could be buffed they could instead print a new card to fill that role. They changed their minds, and the precedent is that they aren't restricted to the design choices of the past.
---
There is no reason not to keep keywords active (they could print more Echo cards, for example). In fact, the logic behind removing Enrage was that it wasn't used that much and then they went and printed MULTIPLE Enrage-style cards without the Enrage keyword. They added wordiness for no reason.
---
Also, currently there is only one card with the Poisonous keyword in Year of the Raven.
---
It will look super good with the may 2019 card back too
---
Now, that's the right way to look at it!
---
yeah hes pretty easy. I got the dalaran commander or whatever that summons 1/4 defenders of dalaran and he was actually pretty tough. Deck full of taunts and warrior removals
---
3 attack means it can pull itself which seems intentional.
---
More like "Any less is inadequate. Any more is of course absurd. I'm a mage, I did the math."
---
I remember that too
---
What is... fun?
---
*There must always be... 17 Lich Kings*
---
Beautiful
---
Yep, if you throw enough overpowered cards at an archetype then it is sure to work.  That was exactly my point.
---
Oh snap you're so right. Beautiful.
---
Depends on their passives and if it's anomaly mode or not. If he has left most card costs two less and the anomaly is cards cost 1 less each turn, that's a relatively early Lich King. Not the worst.
---
That's gotta be hard to play. After turn 8, though, shit just gets out of hand, because that's, at base level, 34 1 drop lich kings if you somehow managed to play ALL of the lich kings at their base cost. 
---
That's a wild fuckin board.
---
Yea but i know that it would annoy you.  
---
Sorry for that.
---
Nice.
---
I think you both missed that his Lich King costs 0
---
This is true. If you dont have those this would kill your curve and you could find yourself losing control of board from the gate
---
For me he was more annoying than hard, kept filling my one open boardspace with 1/1s so I couldn't empty my hand, the 3 carts are obnoxious and boring tbh
---

I agree with your comments. I think Arena is so much more of a complex game than HS will be any day. I‚Äôve been playing Arena for about a month and I‚Äôm still coming across decks I‚Äôve never seen before. The vastness of different decks is amazing unlike the standard HS decks. I think HS is going to take a big hit now that Arena is out. 
---
Plus, Arena they are always updating and adding new cards every quarter do it doesn‚Äôt get stale.
---
Having Jepetto as the final boss helped with that :)
---
Alright so I'm a bit lost as to how I'm supposed to build my collection. I currently have one viable deck, which is a mech hunter. This means I can complete hunter quests alright. However for any other class win quest I have absolutely no clue how I'm supposed to complete them.
---
My collection is really small which means I can't really make a deck that can win for any other class, but I can't efficiently earn gold to buy packs to expand my collection. This seems like an endless circle?
---
Of course I can complete the quests against friends but there's gotta be another way, right?
---
Do I just craft really cheap decks and hope to win like 1 out of 10 games to complete the quests? I would be really happy about some advice about what to do.
---
I am very surprised that unidentified contract is played more than daring escape, since bounce effects are common in rogue decks already. Priest and Hunter were so close with Hunting party and EVIL Conscripter. Also, I know you used multiple parameters, but was eager underling extremely close to winning for warlock? Also Vargoth for neutral legendary.
---
WHAT DID YOU DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I'm not f2p but not a whale either, just a sucker. My only classic golden legendaries since beta are Nozdormu and Millhouse.
---
small dudes was already shitty in the other wings cause the -2 attack dude is basically instant game over
---
Drustvar Horror is the "Choose Two Spells" 5 mana 5/5 that comes from the new Hagatha legendary.
---
I had chosen a Heal Spell and a Burn spell, so thought it would be a good option to fill my deck with.
---
No.
---
During gameplay the tooltip says "Cast another spell and another spell."  It does nothing, not even cast random spells.
---
So I ended up with 26 five mana five fives in my deck.  Queen Togwaggle proceeded to summon them and beat me in the face with them.
---
Sure, if they _only_ looked at play rate, then a Brawl like that would produce misleading data.  However, I suspect they can also look at things like, win rate per side, average turns per game, etc.  A brawl with a high play rate where one side concedes 60% of the time within the first 3 turns is much better data than thousands of "0/5 this brawl sucks" survey responses.
---
Probably because it transformed into a different card
---
Stupid sexy khadgar!
---
Interaction. Card(s).
---
The rag vs nef one was the first brawl ever, and they did buff one of the sides when it came back later but it wasn't SUPER unbalanced.
---
that + an artifact that benefit it the most
---
And we are looking for feedback! We being both Asmo and myself (editor) are looking to bring you guys the best content that you enjoy in the most comsumable format as well. Right now things are fairly bare bones and basic, trying to test the waters and see what people enjoy more. If you have any feedback we would love to hear it, both in terms of the actual video content and how it's edited as well as the general direction that the channel is going. For now we are promising that we will be uploading *daily* content and making sure that we won't let our current audience down (albeit a fairly small one on the youtube front).
---
Just wait till next patch!
---
Rogue needed to die so Murlock Shaman and Token Druid could come back.
---
Rogue was actually one of my better matchups as Priest.
---
I think his stance on not buffing bad cards "because new players need to understand they are bad" is pretty convoluted. Bad cards in the classic deck should serve as a baseline for comparison, yes, but that doesnt mean we need bad cards for the sake of them being bad. They can serve as a point of comparison for statline or effect and maybe are generally better, but a card should not be put in the game if it's only purpose is to serve as a reference, because why add something you never intend a player to use.
---
Why is Eudora's voice acting so awful?
---
Same! One day he will be back.
---
Sometimes lucky üòâ
---
Squashling is TERRIBLE in the streets of Dalaran wing, which is the wing Priest was released in.  Seems a little odd to me.
---
honestly i thought he was stealth nerfed and even was like "yup thats fair"
---
Yea it hard carried me. I just wanna have some fun. At first I filled my deck with "DIE INSECT"s and the gaming is boring as the board is quickly filled, so I decide to do some Hagatha shenanigans.
---
That would be cool to be honest. Have a one boss that is pulling the best deck from legend every week/month and boost it a little bit (for example starting with 3 mana). Powerlevel of Dalaran is already high so it could be beatable.
---
Thank you Khadgar, very cool!
---
If you would spend dust crafting Zayle then yes, otherwise no, but bear in mind that Zayle won't be unlocked (for people who didn't spend $) until a couple weeks from now.
---
Also Zayle is pretty trashy and you should just craft Whizbang instead.  In summary, no not worth it unless you like the PvE.
---
That interaction is kind of wierd. Your starting Hagathas will cost 3 but other Hagathas you draw and the Horror you assembled cost 2.
---
So I realized this after I started reading people‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt know how many bosses there are and it seems like each boss has a bunch of different reactions to each class and multiple different cards. Maybe at some point we can split them up to each different boss. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be online at some point though.
---
You have a lot of heal.  Have you thought about squeezing a Lucentbark in there?
---
Like a non-vegan Kripp
---
Nice 107 health!
