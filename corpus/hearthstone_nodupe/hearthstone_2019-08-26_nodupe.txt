It seems to suck regardless. I want to be closing the game out by the time I get the hero power value I need if I'm aggro.

In wild I'd rather just run Finley, Steady Shot or life tap are probably just upgrades over this anyways.

NA 80g quest trade, Applojuice#1851. I'll show then you go first.
---
No, that’s not how hitting the turn limit works in HS. It always gives a tie no matter the life totals at the end.
---
On ladder that tie just results in neither player gaining or losing a star (I’ve hit it a couple times).
---
In the tournament I believe they said it gives both players a win.
---
I'd still say it's no stronger than other rewards.  If glyph originally cost 3 it would probably still see some play but wouldn't be the auto-include that it was while it was in standard.
---
i've been playing since nax and that has never happened to me...
---
Crybaby much
---
These were given away for free on conventions (well, stripped of their WoW loot cards) when the license ran out. People could get hundreds of cards for a dead CCG for nothing.
---
&gt; I saw the joke and then I laughed at the joke
---
PW in wild runs Finley for a proactive turn 1 play and hopefully the hunter hero power (or mage or Druid).  It doesn’t want this card.
---
Thanks! Its a thing I've been wanting to get into for a while. I played Magic for a couple months and got the app for it. Sadly they removed it from the Google play store. So I came to Hearthstone.
---
When druid lost it's combo/midrange build, these big simple minions just were unplayable.  Both died along with the FoN nerf.
---
I exclusively play whizbang, and quest warrior feels like one of the better decks for me. It feels more consistent than either quest druid or quest priest, although it doesn't hit quite as hard against t1 decks
---
Minions summoned off random effects never trigger their Combo or Choose One effects but spells can.
---
I mean that's standard play for a Control Warrior right.
---
Netdeck top deck then whiff.
---
+1/+1 per golem, can interact with them before opponent removal, easier completion, don't have to pay 5 mana for portal, and no discarding. also this quest has superior support than discard quest ever had. all warrior needs is a windfury weapon and it would be decent.
---
It doesn't need to be at the top and I have all the time in the world for ladder , I don't have a life. Also believe me I know the thief cards come at a tempo loss, that's why I felt like the quest reward should've been something to heal you for like 3 for every card you play or an aluneth type effect where it draws three cards at the end of your turn, anything to either keep you alive or something to draw your academic espionage cards. Thanks for giving me your honest opinion, have a good one may you blessed with golden legendaries.
---
Generic advice to anyone entering the meta for the first time, you don't have to drop real money to run real decks.
---
There are incredible tools for finding what decks you can make for cheap. Go to HSReplay.net, link your Blizzard account to them and download Hearthstone Deck Tracker. Yes, its a legit site. Hundreds of thousands of HS players use it daily. Once deck tracker is up and running, open my collection in game and HDT will upload your collection to HSR.
---
Then go back to HSR. Go to 'decks' and sort by name. It will list every deck it tracks and how much dust you'd need to spend to complete it, as well as the win rate of the deck and the number of matches recorded. Look for at least 1k matches, preferably 5k.
---
From there, dust bad cards and make good decks! If you have a question on a particular card, look it up on HSR as well. Anything used in less that .1% of decks is a pretty safe dust and you'd be amazed on how much dust you're sitting on.
---
Specific advice to you:  This isn't a one-sized fits all question.  The best option is as dependent on what you've opened from YofD as how much is required from YotR.
---
Quest Paladin would also be a possibility, although the other guy was right about Quest Priest, as it's the cheapest Control/Combo deck.
---
What?
---
I'll check out quest Paladin as well. I feel more at hom with Priest and Mage right now.
---
murloc paladin
---
Your comparison powers are a thing of beauty.
---
I saw it once, and I was so intrigued, I let the person play it out and win so I could see what the deck does.
---
Had so many classic legendaries that had to be dusted for some decent decks and now when i look at decks that need some of those classic legendaries a schmall tear runs down my cheek.
---
Replace "Overload" with "Choose One" in your example.
---
Summoning a Druid of the Claw using Eureka? No Choice. Yogg casting Wrath? There is a choice (albeit a random one).
---
Overload, Choose One, Combo, they're all in the position where they mean subtly different things depending on whether they're on a minion or a spell.
---
Human psychology does.
---
I got hunter and opened warlock. Feels bad man.
---
Well then maybe you should stop talking to yourself and find some other people to discuss this with
---
Upvoted for the deck name. 
---
I’m gonna try it later too. 
---
Thanks my man
---
Hahaha glad you like it :) Good luck in your games
---
Thanks, I'll destroy you last!
---
Powercreep is a hell of a drug
---
Sure. You know, it's funny because when I play, I actually never think "I wonder how the other guy feels about me taking time to think". I literally think because I just want to win. So I use the time to really make sure I am doing my best. Some decks I agree, you don't need to take turn 1 to think. Which is why I used my quest druid as an example. Because to put yourself at a 4 turn tempo loss is big. If you aren't planning it out, you will seriously fall behind.
---
People who get pissed off are way too sensitive. Open a youtube tab or distract yourself if you seriously can't hold out for a minute. Geez
---
I mean, its their own fault. If you hate the Deck, why bring it to the finals. You have to expect a mirror match
---
Yes. I love CW. Been playing CW consistently since dr. Boom came out.
---
i mean, that's a 1 hour+ loss, but thats what you get for playing cw
---
Too many murlocs and rogues on standard to have fun.
---
I love those two too! I know Zerek's often just a worse Cairne but those matches where you can get Zerek to stick around like a bad smell are fantastic. Talanji can give huge swing turns too, especially if your opponent isn't prepared for it.
---
I would love to see a graph of the include rates of every classic card over the history of hearthstone. Is that data on hsreplay or anything?
---
When the Arena meta lets me I’ll play attrition Warrior or Priest because I enjoy living on that edge of “can I go one more turn before clearing the board?” but in a solved constructed meta I’m not a fan because you’re basically just jamming your repetitive board clears periodically knowing you have more in the bank than you need.  Mirrors are always interesting no matter what deck you’re running, however.
---
Spreading Plague was nerfed in practically a month and UI was never a problem
---
Ahhh, now we're raising the steaks!!
---
True I may play it a lot more after that. Also I think the nerf is Tuesday.
---
Its today,just checked
---
I wonder if Zephyrs would have given windfury before playing the faceless (at 7 Mana). Then he could have doubled the windfury and had 32 damage out of hand.
---
Please tell me Thijs was playing Brightwing in Quest Shaman, because that is a great idea!
---
I would have actually liked to watch that, both them are very good. Dota internationals distracted me
---
I believe it was!
---
or mind control priest
---
Oh ok.
---
Because it can tilt people and increase their winrates by a few percentage points.
---
deki#2854 EU 80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first

I love this clip, the way he says Bullshit is so satisfying
---
The real sickos are the players running Brewmaster so that they can play Elysiana + Coin + Brewmaster in the mirror where they go second.
---
I think Hearthstone mostly does a good job of creating that Rogue feeling within a card game.
---
I am a low rank player and I HATE when people do this.

---
That’s why Highlander hunter runs sandbinder, because you have two elementals, Siamat and Zephrys and both are cards you would always want to have.
---
To be honest I am one of those. If I see someone doing that in the first turns I just concede.
---
Highlander rogue is pretty fun, but not that competitive imo. Even though he has lots of bounce back effects like shadowstep, wagglepick, brewmasters to make full use of Zeph, he lacks in classic highlander support and lacks in tools to survive until late game like healing or board clears. 
---
And yeah your definition of highlander is right, 1 copy for each card.
---
Priest will become my favorite class if they ever HoF Divine Spirit. I really don't like that combo and for a while most Priest decks have relied on that as a win condition. I really love the healing aspect, the shadow magic, the control over minions, but I need more varied win conditions to personally enjoy Priest.
---
 To be honest I am one of those. If I see someone doing that in the first turns I just concede.
---
yeah those pros were always giving the biggest advice
---
Only way to achieve that is a golden Reno. Not sure if new one counts since he just wants to have fun.
---
Besides live tournament games? Imho never.
---
No, he said he wanted to use an Elise he unpacked..
---
How? Then in 3 days?
---
Throw in a Togwaggle's Scheme (to use with Tess in control matches) and another Pharaoh Cat and remove Violet Haze and Pilfer. Or just look at the VS list for Quest Rouge, it's what I've been using. 
---
By the decks very nature (random cards from other classes) it's going to be a bit inconsistent. 
---
One of the biggest problems, as you've mentioned, is that your deck has a lot of early minions that either rely on getting other classes cards to be active or require combo. Don't be afraid to just use these as vanilla minions. Rouge is all about tempo but cards like Clever Disguise are more value orientated. It's difficult to balance the trade off sometimes.
---
I packed this quest and I'd like to make a deck around it, but a lot of the warrior weapons are epic and I don't have them. It seems almost every warrior epic sees play
---
Cheating spells is already powerful enough. Overload spells are already powerful enough. Cheating overload spells without the overload cost would be super broken.
---
Wasn't an insult, just an educated guess.
---
No. Nerfs go live today.
---
When?
---
Reno
---
He surely wasn't meta, but did see some play in Even Paladin before Call to Arms was nerfed. And that was probably just due to Even Pally being bonkers broken at the time that it could run a dead card like Millhouse and still be successful.
---
holy shit that hurt my soul
---
Love shaman too. First deck I got past 15 or so with was a Grand Tournament shaman using inspire buffs to a big board and finishing with bloodlust. Added in trogg and totem golem along with other overload when that came round.  Then a bit later played an elemental based deck for ages and now playing a wild quest elemental shaman (very unlike normal quest shaman - no shudderwock as the elemental battlecries often don't work with it and anyway I don't own it)
---
I had three this morning. I guess I took yours.

Maybe you are just unlucky or they reduced the chance to get one, bit 60g quests still exist - I got one today.

Simply put: no. It lacks any real win condition other than control, and as a control deck it's way too weak.

What I find funny is that the nerf to Extra Arms will not stop this from happening. It also won’t stop a 2/28 Ahmet from creating 4 28 health minions, all ready to inner fire you out of the game

---
Two things: 
---
1. Murloc  
---
2. They aren't played because they have less solid matchups and generally don't fit into a conquest format as well. They're tier 2 decks because on average their winrate on ladder is good. Conquest however isn't about average winrates.
---
I'm just saying Negativity Bias is a very real thing.
---
What the actual fuck?
---
What would you use the dust for?
---
Oh, that thing... Well, yes but... yes...  
---
I actually would just do Pogo + Zilliax anyways... a 13/12 divine shield, taunt, rush, lifesteal on 6 mana is pretty good
---
"Oh you have a 5th Omega Devastator! Haha that's so great well done"
---
If the murloc decks are not stopped with hungry crabs, then the meta will be worse than before.
---
interesting, i don't have access to it at work, does it run the quest? ( so my free legendary might be usefull )
---
How positive are we on pitty timers? On the Uldum packs I for sure had 32 packs from gold and have gotten 1 pack every week day from quest gold. I usually don't play too much on weekends. But I still have only got one legendary + the free one. Does crafting reset the timer? Is there some where you can check your pitty timer progress?
---
He tried... He really tried
---
3 of those decks are getting nerfed within a few hours
---
I would really like to hear from people who log their quests long term. I'm especially interested in comparison of avg before and after +10g changes. Most older threads about avarage that I saw were using simulation based on equal distribution of quests that never was confirmed as valid.
---
You can take a tier 1 deck (say control warrior right now), replace the least needed card in the deck with millhouse, and still perform well (to the point that this new version would be considered tier 1). That doesn't make it a meta card.

---
I had a better time with it last expansion (consistently climbing to rank 5) than this one, but I've also only played a few games of murloc shaman this expac.
---
In my experience, any coherent deck has a great winrate when your climbing lower ranks. So since your rank has been reset down from not playing, you should be able to play whatever deck seems fun to you for quite some time.
---
Small correction, Y'shaarj already saw play in big druid in Un'goro, just before big priest.
---
Disenchant it, and sit on the dust for a week or two in case it's still good
---
So just had a game where I roped turn 1. You know why. I had to decide if I wanted to use my coin against a priest or hold it for a later turn tempo play.
---
I had Druid of the Scythe, so my thought process was, do i hold coin and hope he plays a minion I can kill, if he's aggro, or do I just use the coin.
---
I had to really think about it because what if I use the coin and then he has a minion and extra arms. I basically lose. So in the end, as the rope was burning, I made the decision to hold the coin. But I used my turn to plan out the possible outcomes.
---
A lot on this sub seem to not realize that hearthstone still has some skill and decision making. Turns 1-5 are usually the most decision based lol
---
any idea when nerfs are going live
---
Awww muffin. Buy some packs so you can make one deck.
---
It saw no play at 7 mana until they buffed it, so it may very well be unviable once again.
---
Just disenchant it, at worst you end up recrafting it without losing any dust.
---
I AM the meta!
---
Was mostly when boomsday released iirc? So you could reduce the cost of azalina and play both on the same turn. Otherwise you had to overdraw them so they couldn't ransom.

LF 80g quest trade on euw ign: Nick#26686
---
Good luck man! I believe it'll be much easier for you as a returning player to get back into the game than for me back then. It's true that there are many things to learn, but believe me there are like only 30% or 40% of them that really see play. So don't worry too much about that. There are sure a lot of RNG involved right now, and I don't like either. But I think that's what it takes for a card game, so I'm not so triggered by that :p
---
 
---
Actually I'm looking to play other cards games right now. What do you think of MTG? And do you recommend other card games?
---
Search extra in the bar. It brings all the copies of cards you have more golden in so you can do it that way. Doesn't take that long
---
The drunk pirate rolled a natural 20.
---
He's powerful for a specific purpose, but as a player with fewer cards, you might want something more ubiquitous.
---
He's worked most often in Druid, so if you play a lot of Druid, you should keep it. There's even a decent Druid OTK deck that uses him right now.  
---
That said, the decks he goes in are usually expensive, and it's hard to substitute cards from a combo deck without suffering bigger losses than other kinds of decks would. And you might go an expansion or 2 without him being in a strong deck (he sits unused in your collection fairly often).
---
That's all for standard. If you play wild, absolutely keep him.

I fielded this same question on r/wildhearthstone so I'll leave my same response where I go change by change down the list here ( u/mjc9806 is reasonably spot on though) :
---
If you read the Thoughts and Observations section we explain the following in regards to Big Priest:
---
"Secret Mage’s extreme prominence in the meta has also pushed Big Priest further down the tier list as well, and may fall even further in response to the upcoming August balance patch that will nerf Barnes to 5 mana."
---
Big Priest is at its lowest point it's ever been in the power rankings. The slight nerf to Barnes is only going to push it lower over time. In our discussions and formulation of the tier lists, we concluded that it's already not worth playing and is only going to get worse from there.
---
Luna's Pocket Galaxy and Conj. Calling doesn't have the format warping effect on Wild compared to Standard. The reversion of the LPG change will have a VERY minor overarching effect on the meta. LPG was only run in a select few Reno Mage lists. The overwhelming majority of Reno Mage lists weren't running LPG in the first place so outside for a select few people, it's business as usual in the grand scheme of things. Conj. Calling has been seen in one Reno Mage list in the past few weeks and a few Secret Mage lists. The community has heavily favored versions without it. So again, business as usual.
---
Priest lists running Extra Arms failed to make a blip on the radar in the past two weeks in any significant fashion. Which is why we pushed it to the side for this snapshot. The reversion of the buff to Extra Arms stands to give a nudge to cement that as well. Of course, there are success stories from archetype experts like Haze. But very few pilots are able to replicate his success.
---
The nerf to Dr. Boom is another interesting nerf. There are many people of the opinion that Dr. Boom was actively one of the worse cards in Odd Warrior lists already. You were only running it because you felt semi-obligated to do that.
---
I made legend with control shaman this season, mage was surely the worst matchup. I am also very excited for the future of this deck.
---
I’m all about that minion combat myself and Druid does it pretty well. I also love their versatility when it comes to armor, healing, buffs, spells they just have a lot of options. All that matters is how good those options are.
---
I think this is just incorrect. There was only one druid deck, midrange/combo druid and this card was a staple of it. There hasn't been a good midrange druid deck since force of nature was nerfed. The closest thing was jade druid which already had a midrange taunt card, although they occasionally ran this. 
---
This card is not a good example of power creep.
---
On this week's episode of card does exactly what it says it does...
---
This high roll was literally talked about when the card was introduced
---
I hear ya. I personally think they balance control cards with aggro cards pretty well in Shaman but this particular expansion does seem to be mostly aggro.
---
^saved ^the ^best ^for ^last!
---
&gt;Hand was full so it only added 2 of the 3 minions triggering one's deathrattle.

Every time I look on info about new game it's always "made from ex blizzard/mtg game designer" I swear. It makes me wonder why they quit such huge games and decided to make their own games which 80% of them die year later. They probably thought they are too smart for mtg that they can make their own better game
---
There was a thread last week from a guy who was asking how far someone can climb on a F2P account who just so happened to drop a link to that game in his OP then proceeded to repeat the answers people gave him with added negative hyperbole. When he was called out on it, he said that wasn't his intention and he eventually removed the link, but it was extremely suspicious.
---
We are aware of the double copypasta and are working on fixing that. Thanks for the heads up!
---
During our writing and observation period, Shudderwock and Reno Shamans hadn't had any significant impact on the Legend-ladder meta. You'll see from snapshot to snapshot that some lists come and go. It is very likely that there will be more conclusive findings about Shudderwock Shamans and Reno Shamans in a few weeks. For the time being, we weren't confident in placing the two archetypes by going off isolated success stories as our only data sets.
---
It was added into the classic set together with other Cards like Brightwing and Whitemane on July 1. when they rotated Vanish and other cards into the Hall of Fame.

The big thing with tech cards like Skulking Geist is to keep in mind that you're playing it for more than just Jade Druid. Yes, it's at its best in that matchup. However, it has major implications against Combo Priest, various Warlocks, Quest Mage, Odd Warrior AND Jade Druid.
---
I typically advise people to tech for a spread. Not one particular matchup. Geist is hitting a fairly wide spread on the ladder right now.
---
1- Literally a non-issue. You're talking about 1/20th of a pack that will in all likelihood give you 40 dust and 100 on average. That 5 gold is valued at between 2 and 5 dust. Relax.
---
2- Part of the reward structure i you're going to not get very many wins.
---
3- In every conceivable way a non-issue. Plus, if you have to leave a game early on 2 losses and next time you log in, it's nice to already have that gold available.
---
4- Annoying but total non-issue.
---
Literally 3 of the 4 things you mentioned are literal non-issues with the 4th being of no importance. Their time is much better spent elsewhere.
---
The issue is that most people are just unwilling to learn how to play the deck against CW and are unwilling to adapt their playstyle in order to beat it. Thats the main reason it has a sub-50% winrate against CW. according to hsreplay when in reality it can easily beat CW.
---
Its funny because they know the ONLY reason that you would play their dogshit card game is because you might get a bit of money out of it, so they keep harping on the "real world cards" that will have "monetary value". Pretty sure the gas money that it would cost to drive to the store for card sleeves is worth more than the cards themselves.
---
I do stats for a living, I'm not confused by them.
---
thanks but I still dislike your choice of fun
---
It was indirectly nerfed multiple times, but the one that killed it from competitive play was changing how Faceless Manipulator worked. Before the mechanics update, copying a 5 attack minion progressed the quest, now it doesn't (unless you somehow handbuff your faceless to 5 attack).
---
We have playback now?
---
I mean, that's just one of those where you never pick them due to that possibility.
---
I mean both CW and LPG Mage are a favourable match up for highlander hunter already. I'd say it will get weaker, cause now there's going to be more super aggro and midrange decks.
---
I wish these were the actual problems in the game
---
It's something that's been obvious for a while. Priest players are sick of the combo, non-Priest players hate losing to the combo, and the combo has actually become viable in recent times instead of a gimmick. The devs outright called it a problem card. With Mind Blast getting tossed in the Hall of fame, it's pretty clear the devs don't want Priest to have anything resembling a combo finisher.
---
I had one today. Win 3 brawls. Just bad roll/reroll luck for you.
---
The way the quest triggers makes no sense. The golden monkey doesn’t trigger it when it replaces your hand but Rafaam does
---
Well, duh.
---
Murloc paladin is usually a very good way to quickly aggro the lich King it takes a few tries however but it eventually works
---
As a mage main I cannot wait for this nerf. Winning off turn 4 galaxy is just incredibly boring.
---
I wouldn't blame the app bug on the engine.
---
Username checks out.
---
rank 5
---
 I have no idea what the fuck the devs actually want for the class.  Divine Spirit is definitely on the chopping block at this point.
---
Harrison was never "useless" though. It's always been seen as a playable tech card.
---
If you really wanna do it, you may need to craft some cards. IF you google "Hearthstone Arthas 9 Classes Speed Run" you will get numerous videos. Some are better than others in explaining the deck. Here is a reddit post about it from some while ago. The part with Paladin has a fair amount of swearing, so be warned about that: 
---

---
Hilariously, except for 1 card that isn't 100% necessary to this combo, this is all basic cards. This is Priest in a nutshell - a class that, for 80% of the lifespan of Hearthstone, has been using the same win conditions since launch.
---
Savage
---
well at least they are much less greedy then blizzard I am gonna try it out instead of this shitty greed game blizzard made mark my words hs will be dead in 3 years put a reminder I dare ya
---
It was actually not jade druid, but all the meta decks that were nerfed by changing classic cards like warleader
---
But mobile does have a deck tracker...for Android at least.
---
Have I got news for you.
---
I paid $20 to join the beta of the Hearthstone killer directed by the creator of Magic: The Gathering.
---
Would not fall for it again.  The imps were cute though.
---
Good news. Boom, Conj Calling, Extra Arms, and Pocket Galaxy will be nerfed in an hour or so....
---
The problem is the expansion cards for Priest since Witchwood haven't been great. Even the Combo Priest deck currently has *5* Priest cards not from the classic set... And 2 of those 5 were just nerfed back into uselessness.
---
We all live in 2019 while this guy's still in 2018.

Hangelos#2599

That is an epic card you filthy liar
---
You just lost to another mage, didn't you
---
Disregarding the point that you missed them nerfing some cards today: i think we should hit prismatic lense, and some of the early game of warrior like the new 2 2 taunt or our best 1 3 mech body. Its crazy to think that moat people believe dr. boom is the only problem card when control warrior is able to outtempo midrange decks with a very powerful curve that supports good early removal either in the form of drawing restless mummy or tanking up armor to enable shield slam. Pair that with a bunch of aoe and 4 lategame removal focussed minions and you have a very potent control deck even without dr. boom (atleast IMO). Prismatic lense in the other end is one of those high variance cards that i wont ever like. together with tip the scales or king phaoris you can do some crazy shit with ut that unless you outtempoed them or you have some early board clear, may as well win them the game. This is mire me personally disliking this aspect. Kripps suggestion to make cards have the playing cost as onboard cost also sounds great to reduce powerful mutate turns early on in shaman decks and to get rid of the problems surrounding mountain giant and summoning 4 7 8s once and for all. This would also allow them to keep calling at 3 which is honestly a fine place if giant is a 3 / 4 drop when you play it on turn 4
---
Dr. Boom is bs in standard, he's pretty weak in wild.
---
&gt;Address the "5" gold in arena rewards
---
How the fuck is this a problem.
---
Fuck warrior
---
Man fuck our school system
---
yeah, I'm interested too
---
That image looks fucking cursed
---
Cool a response from MD!
---
This reaches the turn limit, I'm guessing?
---
And it sucks that one top deck can completely change a game but that’s how it all works. Same reason I stopped playing poker it’s not fun to lose to luck.
---
I love playing against warrior because I play thief preist and I literally just become warrior with plague of sand and mind control, then if all else fails it's also a mechathun deck.
---
Think it’s still viable without the decoys? What would you replace them with? I just don’t wanna spend 800 dust on this deck tbh
---
I'll start off by saying I've never played wow and I know none of the lore and all knowledge I have is through buts and pieces I've seen here and in hearthstone.
---
I've heard a few a few people suggest it might revolve around Deathwing since this is the year of the dragon and all. He apparently has ties to the Tolv'dir which Dark Pharoah Tekahn is one of, and maybe Madame Lazul since she is kinda the one weird off character from Rise of shadows since she wasn't really a big deal in the expansion she came out in. Some have theorized that Deathwing will be such a big threat that the villains and heroes will have to team up to defeat him.
---
I've also heard it might involve the resurrection of the old gods which would also involve Madame Lazul. This theory could also involve deathwing since I believe Deathwing is corrupted by one of them and tries to destroy the world. Again I know almost nothing about the lore of WoW and no one knows anything about the upcoming expansion but these are just a few things I've seen here and there that could provide hints for the next expansion.
---
Pocket Galaxy -&gt; Mecha’thun
---
Barnes -&gt; spare dust for now, will craft back if he’s still good
---
just Siamat, but I dont want to craft him if the deck wont be worth playing, I would maybe craft an aggro warrior then eg.
---
What the hell kinda BP deck is this?
---
Doing 52 a turn u can't kill him before turn limit right? Just wow :O
---
This sub isn’t just for standard tho. Yeah he should crosspost it but there’s no harm asking here
---
How does he clear? His hand is Zilliax, Brawl, Armagedillo, Flunky and Devastator, and only has 3 mana.
---
Decoys are actually prett, big deal, but you can try without them. They are good because they are basically duel nr.2 and makes use of big card stuck in hand.
---
Free packs for NA when
---
It's actually a really good card mostly used in OTK combo decks. In fact I'm willing to bet it's one of the next classic set legendaries on the chopping block to get hall of famed.
---
Hearthstone at its best
---
Seems to slow, by then you are likely to have draw most of your big minions you’re looking to hit with Galaxy.
---
Well, control warrior for example, is an almost impossible deck in my experience. I simply don't have gas enough to pressure them. :)
---
The card will still do what it did before is my point, you are correct. People genuinely want the card to be reworked or destroyed, that's clearly not happening here. The community is just overreacting to something they expected and didn't get, which is silly but it's whatever. I'm just saying, the card will still exist and do what it does, so until Boom rotates out, he'll be strong.
---
Light bomb was easily the best board clear they ever made for Priest in terms of balance and design. Scream is dumb. Mass Hysteria is insanely RNG. Lightbomb in Classic would fix a lot of Priest issues. Problem is that nothing can fix Priest hero power except a rework.
---
siamat is almost a definite craft this expansion. he’s played in 3 tier 1 decks. reall not a bad inclusion in anything.
---
Well I didn't know that. Cool
---
u don't have guts do u noobs
---
Then his mistake was at deck building time, or just rng. The reason priest has been taking off is because it punishes these slow start control and quest decks.
---
Until you realize that it was designed by people
---
Yeah, combo priest could get on board VERY early and stop you from getting your board from rolling for the damage needed before finishing off with charges.
---
Have you got the full list
---
This is true. Cards vulnerable to it that were good (Giants, Rag, Boom) saw play regardless, and those that were bad didn't see play even after the nerf.
---
Just come play wild! Mind Blast priest is still a strong deck
---
Siamat is worth crafting even if the deck doesn’t make the cut tbh
---
wait 24 more minutes from this comment, mb then it comes !
---
for aggro match ups, but not in ctrl wars
---
dude ur playing battlecry shaman u deserve it
---

---
I agree with most of your points. Control warrior has been strong for a while, but will it be oppressive with a 9 cost boom? Maybe; I still think boom will be used, as control warrior has enough stall to make it to 9. I honestly think boom should have lost the armor up option in its hero powers. I do agree that the cost of a card should be locked in at what it is played for.
---
If boom leaves warrior decks, though, I think control warrior will be back in line with its historic power level. I am not sure further nerfing will be needed.
---
Yeah, but that it’s quite different from calling someone an idiot without watching the cards he has in hand.

Yeah, thats true, but I have also a huge pile of legendarys to craft for other decks, where sadly no Siamat is needed and I need a serious ladder deck, so I dont wanna complete a deck, if it wont be good then\^\^

---
do people actually smurf on hs with how expensive everything is?
---
Haha no problem!
---
Yeah this seemed bugged to me.  Didn't show Lunas or extra arms and Booms mana cost wasn't highlighted
---
I just logged in and its live now for anyone se wondering
---
I see, that explains it. :)
---
It said they cost (0) so what did you expect
---
I was expecting 10 free packs what a disappointment.
---
What a surprise...
---
It's going to feel weird disenchanting Barnes since he's not from packs, but it's hard to deny 1600 dust. If I ever feel like I need him back to complete my collection I guess it will translate back 1:1.
---
I crafted a golden pocket galaxy because I loved the card so much... fucccccck
---
it's fun when you draw the good cards, otherwise, not.
---
SELF DESTRUCT!
---
Nah, trust me, it is rather good and satisfying deck.
---
I already have it :)
---
I wish they'd fix that interaction
---
/r/competitivehs couldn't figure that out, either; the fools were convinced it was a tempo card.
---
Where do people keep getting this idea now? If warrior can drop boom on 7 against an aggro deck theres a 95% chance that the aggro deck already lost anyway. Two extra turns dont mean a thing.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
COME TO MY AID!
---
If you have lots of time and no money I suppose that you can earn more gold by playing several accounts.  More daily quests to do.  You could have one account for each class and do 9 daily quests a day.
---
They said "about an hour" like an hour ago....
---
Live in NA as well
---
What is this, the 3rd update they've made to him? Exciting to see that they're committed to making quick updates!
---
Zephyrs just getting better and better. Next step: Zephyrs designs his own card
---
They aren't refunding the dust?
---
There's a wild taunt warrior floating around in wild with funky and stonehill and sulthraze :D
---
You'll still have all the mana to play him before you have a 50% chance to draw him. Effectively, this reduces the overall value Boom can produce in matchups where he matters by somewhere in the real of 5-7%. Bear in mind that the best followup for Boom- that being shield slam to pay back the tempo loss of playing him- is still very much doable.
---
Bullshit, because i keep going against 2 mana arms and 5 mana galaxy
---

 Kaj#1240 on EU looking to trade the 80g quest. I'd like you to go first please.

Literally would not impact me a basic standard player who spends ~$20 an expansion. The first two seem kinda petty sure the rewards aren't great, but I doubt those changes would impact much if the player base. The last two are bugs who knows how hard it is to fix.
---
Hyper aggro devs haven’t existed in a long time
---
Had this happen to me last night lol it was actually the card that completed my quest after I had such horrible draws. It ended up winning me the game.
---
ah fair enough; warsong is a meta-defining card tbh
---
I would be salty if that happened to me. What are the chances? I would like to see the math numbers on this.
---
Is Barnes the first nerfed Adventure legendary?
---
Should i disenchant Lunas?
---
so free.....
---
Yes, I was just wondering how it would be technically possible to craft such expensive decks without ranking up above 25. But I forgot about purchasing packs for money.
---
Yes, it feels very wrong! The whole point of the new Rank 26-50 system was to make it a better experiance for new players, but if it's like this, then what's the point?
---
I think that the rank floors I read about on the wiki is great as well, I think this as they don't have a rank that this is matchmaking through casual play(?) even if I play ranked, as casual is locked for me. Anyway, it's a bit disheartening but I'll probably chug through it. :)
---
Why not turtle it and keep it in pocket for phar summon?
---
Wow I didn’t even notice Whitemane. Is it played at all in competitive decks? It looks like a good inclusion in battlecry shaman or res priest
---
time to try it in my shudderwock deck  
---
if it wouldn't cost 400 dust :/
---
This really needs to happens for the longevity of the game.
---
The people who pay Team 5’s pay check are no longer new players but the existing players. Existing players will leave in droves if the player base goes down hill.
---
Team 5 would be shooting themselves in the foot if they did not do this. Honestly, Whizbang should just be a reward for getting to rank 20 in ladder.
---
Yes.
---
You can re-craft him later(you can't craft more cards than you can put in a deck)
---
Barnes nerfed. thats so awesome!
---
Since always?
---
I think this will definitely be a craft.
---
That was probably the best possible come back, well played
---
Even if the opponent had lethal, Barnes getting the minions you described would probably stop it
---
Even tho Its in my highlander deck? What should i replace it with?
---
Dayum, I need to not disenchant extra stuff.
---
Holy sh where did you get that?
---
It's really slow and you have to have a lot of shit on the board for the battlecry to be decent
---
Yes, since if it ends up still being good (it wasn't when it was 7 mana before so it probably won't be now) you can just craft it again with the dust you got from it
---
Antonidas is a great staple card so it's not like you wasted dust there. And Reno/Zeph are so good I'm gonna try to make something work it's just so much fun. 
---
And hey if you dust Luna's at least you get some dust back on your investment so it doesn't hurt too bad
---
It should be craftable, iirc all Wild adventure cards are craftable.
---
You smell like a leper gnome!
---
it's big brain time
---
Oh boy, just wait until you find out that you draw cards from your deck in a random order *every game.*
---
It's almost like it's an inherent element in the design of card games.
---
That IceFireSong guy in the comment section is really not happy with those changes...!
---
correct- you can't craft more cards than you need, not that you ever want to. 
---
Of course you can craft him again for that 1600. The only "downside" is that I often don't end up playing cards that are nerfed caz I used the dust elsewhere/ don't feel like re-crafting them again.
---
Impossible to say if that's a problem without knowing the game state at the time and what it offered you instead.
---
If you fail to see the difference between drawing a random card from your deck and summoning/casting random cards feom the whole game, across all classes, you are delusional beyond help.
---
Convenient glitch monkaHmm
---
This post has never happened before
---
bye bye golden pocket galaxy
---
Why isn't Barnes a 4/5 now, If the problem was the 1/1 coming out too early and not that a 3/4 and a 1/1 on turn 4 is too strong?
---
Please commit don’t
---
&gt;I mean, you dont get to tell me what I want??
---
Calm down, I am not attacking you.
---
&gt; edit: wow, someone doesnt agree with me, downvote him! (by all means) 
---
You don't get to tell me which comments I downvote!
---
And extra arms and Luna's are not even shown. Some poor peolpe are not going to realize it
---
That doesn't really help because quests are random and you need to get every class to level 10 to unlock Arena. 
---
Like yeah once you're rank 25 and starting to push into Ranked, that's a good strategy, but from a purely new player perspective every game mechanic forces you away from just maining 1 class/deck.
---
I got golden lunas, fuck yeah I'm DEing it!
---
True mate, just not used to running him. Yet I've got Zeph for a few other decks.
---
Haha I already spent that dust on last pieces of Highlander Hunter. That's my problem. Spending all the time!
---
Thanks for the chat man wish you all the best going forward.
---
Removing the early boom nut draws is pretty significant but not really the main impact of this change. Not being able to boom hero power the same turn is pretty huge and means he has literally no impact on the board the turn you play him. It also makes boom shield slam plays impossible until turn 10 which was often how you bridged the gap to your omega devastator turns. 
---
I don’t think this change makes warrior trash tier or anything but people are really underestimating the impact this nerd will have.
---
I bought one a couple of years ago at game in the uk
---
I have a golden Pocket Galaxy and it's been very strong in my Highlander deck. I really want to craft Zul'Jin and the Shaman quest because they are the only cards from those respective decks I'm missing but I'm not sure if Pilgrim and Sandwich make LPG OK still in my highlander deck. 
---
Choices...
---
Never
---
Didn't realize we were in an argument, but thanks anyway.
---
Disenchant it....if you want it back later then re-craft it
---
Because not letting us use our Wild cards at all is too obvious of a ripoff.
---
K
---
I'm keeping him. I use him in a Big Rogue deck and I think that he's still playable for it.
---
DE him now and if you miss him redraft him for free later
---
Death to the stormcloaks
---
That is overwhelmingly satisfying
---
God damn it I use "extra" all the time to DE dupes, and I *still* botched this.
---
It's still silly its set up that way. What's even more ridiculous is that searching "Extra Arms" doesn't show you Extra Arms.
---
For fun. It was supposed to include stupid shit like this
---
Draws 5 in a row anyway
---
I feel like i need to ask what rank this is, i've been playing the same deck at around rank 2 and oh boy it doesn't look like this
---
Greetings friend. I never thought about running both Fleshshaper and Inventor because of the mutate synergy. Might have to give this list a try.
---
Booooo!
---
I don't play wild but had a Barnes so that makes me happy as well :-)
---
Go Jalexander and fight the good fight.
---
Yes, but I don't think the nerf will solve the problem of Big Priest. To be sure, it *will make the deck worse,* but the deck is only Tier 2 anyway. The problem is that it feels terrible to play against, and I think a better prescription is to make cards that counter what BP is doing (as in more transform and reshuffle effects as opposed to destruction).
---
I wouldn't even pick it at turn 10 if kael offered it... card is dead now.
---
From 10 to 5.  I know it gets a lot more difficult from 5 onward.  My winrate just didn't look quite as crazy before the nerfs went live.
---
chasing tail is neither illegal nor immoral. if i were him i would start filing a lot of lot suits.
---
It’s RNG to an extent, the spells cast have random targets
---
Weren't we supposed to get a dust refund for the nerfs like when they rotate cards to the hall of fame
---
This option actually existed for a short time during the Rise of the Mech update. A new tab was added above standard cards called "featured cards" which displayed Snip Snap and any of the newly buffed cards. I'm not sure why they chose to remove it...
---
That's cuz Boom is not a value card, he's 100% a removal enabler. Mechs with Rush is how you stabilize against aggro. Normal removal package is simply not enough half the time. Aggro will wreck Warriors if you don't draw enough normal removals.
---
Wow didn't know today was nerd day, happy nerd day fellow nerds
---
Mojomaster Zihi is key to beating this deck. No Zul'jin, no refill.
---
Aww, look.  It's trying to communicate.
---
Ahh that explains alot. My winrate at around rank 5 with this deck was like 79%, but as you go further down people really start to get good at playing around secrets.
---
I think Boom will still be strong
---
Continuing the behavior after the woman tells you to stop certainly is.
---
Make Togwaggle rue the day he was born
---
I used tempo mage and hunter decks on my alt. Lots of good classic/basic staples in those classes, plus I packed Jan’Alai which is a pretty lights out finisher in those ranks.
---
No, it would just offer fireball instead
---
I was in an area with poor internet connection when I posted. REmessit  probably posted it multiple times bc of a glitch or something.
---
Big priest isn't actually a super powerful deck, the issue is that when you high roll with it, it is *extremely* powerful. You can potentially get 14/15 stats on the board with coin turn 3, by doing Barnes &gt; Y'shaarj &gt; Y'shaarj. And even without the super high roll, Barnes is an incredibly strong turn 3 or 4 play in that deck.
---
 it's almost here bro  http://oree.market/yourmother
---
I'm curious, why does the 2 more mana cost make it "unplayable"? Especially if you haven't drawn the big minions it's used for by then?
---
Hi curious, why does the 2 more mana cost make it "unplayable"? especially if you haven't drawn the big minions it's used for by then?, I'm dad.
---
Dat Twinspell value!
---
100% difference. in wild delaying a power play by 1 turn has huge implications. for example if against aggro you could just die, and against a similar deck they get their power play off before you and have initiative. i'm almost certain barnes will be cut from most lists.
---
MOM SAID IT WAS MY TURN
---
No? Golden rares cost 800 to make
---
I don't think there is an easy solution though. You can make it so typing one of the words like extra or cost both searches for cards with the word as well as using it as a keyword, the problem is that specially for extra, it would suck searching for extra cards to DE and unintentionally dusting extra arms.
---
In a perfect world you have a better ui similar to what we always had for mana and classes but better and more expansive. I think a good compromise is having commands that will never be confused with card text, like having them in between slashes like so "//extra//" and have somewhere within the collection where it tells you about the commands. It's not as easy or as intuitive, but it works more consistently.
---
That being said you may want to hold onto Dr Boom

The murloc is a bipedal, amphibious, semi-intelligent, aggressive race residing along coastlines, lakeshores, and riverbeds. Murlocs possess bulbous bodies, large mouths lined with rows of sharp fangs, and slime-coated skin. Individuals range in coloration from turquoise to darkish grey, while their heights vary from 3-1/2 feet to 6 feet. Depending on the variety, murlocs may lean towards a closer resemblance to frogs or to fish; the iconic green murloc, for example, has coloration similar to the red-eyed tree frog.

Though murlocs are relatively new to the Eastern Kingdoms, it is increasingly believed that they are actually a very ancient race of Azeroth. These creatures have been moving in-land steadily from their oceanic dwelling places and inhabiting more areas of Lordaeron. This move in-land has resulted in them adapting to fresh-water lakes and rivers. Their supposed intelligence has been debated. Some argue that, since their guttural language is impossibly difficult to decipher, they have limited intelligence. However, their use of weaponry and uncanny fighting abilities imply a rather sinister racial intellect.[4] Additionally, D.E.H.T.A. representative King Mrgl-Mrgl discovered, after he had learned their language, that the Winterfin tribe of murlocs in the Borean Tundra of Northrend are as intelligent as any of Azeroth's more "civilized" races.

Murlocs tend to dwell in amply-populated coastal settlements, and it is unusual to find individuals wandering too far from their compatriots. Players looking to engage murlocs should be wary of their surroundings; the creatures often lurk out of sight beneath the surface of the water. This tendency, coupled with their large social aggro radius, can often lead to larger pulls.
---
Murlocs organize into small tribes and larger clans. The clans can muster their tribes into a fighting force when needed for invasion. Rarely, clans may join each other to form larger forces.[3]

Hunting (i.e. grinding) murlocs can be profitable, given that murloc fins are an essential ingredient in a common broth. Slimy Murloc Scales are often in demand with expert leatherworkers for use in crafting fine armor. Murlocs carry clams consistent with their level, as do most aquatic creatures, which can contain various grades of clam meat and pearls. It is possible that all murlocs use clams as currency, as the Winterfin murlocs do. In addition, certain murlocs command hefty bounties because of their tendencies to terrorize coastal commerce and fishing locations.

Packs come with it? Cool. Do you know which kind?

Agreed on that score

Ben Brode and Shiro one song

Holy fuck

this is true, people downvoting are such a mystery to me: DO YOU GUYS JUST SIT ON YOUR DUST FOREVER AND NOT MAKE NEW CARDS
---
Fireball is likely the answer given the parameters you just listed. The situation where Shadow Madness is  the perfect card is still a fair bit more complex.
---
Reroll quests that require wins. Getting each class to 10 doesn't take long even when losing.

Patches can have a big impact over the meta, DE and waiting at least a week for the meta to resettle a bit would be smarter if you want to have the best deck for the least amount of dust. Maybe the impact of the nerf isn't as much as we thought due to other meta changes and you can recraft it for the same amount of dust. The only reason not to dust it is if you know you want to play the card regardless of winrate.

1/1 Zephrys op

That’s my plan. I normally only play mage, but since they fucked the only tier one mage deck since Goblins and Gnomes, I’m going to make the shittiest no skill face deck (hunter) and just be cancer like everyone else now.

Evidence exists. You're defending a serial creep.
