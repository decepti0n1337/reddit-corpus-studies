Remember to bully Rafaam by putting cutecat before alley cat.

---
---
A bad taste in the top players mouths perhaps but the majority of players either won't notice or see it as a means of an opportunity to catch up.  
---

---
Ideally the whole concept of the MMR system is flawed as it currently stands though the normalization they mentioned may certainly help.
---
I hope this isn't a circlejerk prank
---
But a little gate keeping butt hurt with earning heroic naxramas card back when it first came out.
---
Now it's less harder with the new packs.
---
Not if you are unable to play xd
---
I have like 80% winrate with OTK Murloc deck without anyfin. I just run taunts and card draw minions and even if I draw prismatic into prismatic I still have a decent chance of winning the game straight up. Only thing that fucks you is drawing old murk eye or rawing warleader without coin and you can potentially win those games as well. If you prismatic into a murloc u kinda screwed tho.
---
This makes things kinda interesting, because now they are actually functionally different as opposed to just using a keyword.
---
Do you think we'll see both versions in the future?
---
More like take my Runestones.
---
It's beta. They should just reset it.
---
Some people will be pressured to buy them before they're "gone for good", then if they want they can make a big deal about bringing them back later.
---
Still better for grabbing golden cards than straight up crafting them for old sets. That would be the only reason I did it
---
It's true
---
The team is working really hard and doing lots of stuff. 
---
We love Hearthstone and we love making people happy by making fun stuff for them to play.
---
We will make mistakes, and accidentally ship bugs and sometimes it will take us a while to get it right, but as all that happens we are trying to do it right and make it fun.
---
Hopefully our actions show how much we want to make Hearthstone great.
---
This change actually makes it easier for newer players to catch the top as the top players take a far larger dive for losing and less for winning (where they are facing players with larger MMR gaps).  
---
It is better than what we had before basically.  
---
I imagine as it's beta MMR doesn't mean anything now and too many people are putting arbitrary concepts against it.  The best period allows them to play around and see what happens all extremes of the MMR spectrum.  
---
No point resetting now when we are still in beta and you need the standings as they are to test and figure out what is going to be best in the long run outside of beta.
---
Oooh thx for answer
---
Don't lose. ;)

Awesome! Wait, what class? (nothunternothunternothunter)
---
And the adventure, that seems hype to me assuming the cards are usable everywhere
---
I didn't really see these combos too often, I think I only lost to the infinite snip-snap twice during the entire time people were complaining about it (and only once to something similar with Sound The Bells which was a bit of a fluke.) Heck, I think I had a lot of situations where the enemy Warlock could pull off the Snip-Snap thingie, but still couldn't win. I'm kinda sad this danger isn't lurking out there anymore...
---
...buuuut I also recognize that a lot of people were actively stressed out by this, so, happy day to you folks! Enjoy your new, safer world.
---
I got it the first time around and I say fuck anyone complaining about it. We had it for two years longer than everyone else, that’s our reward for getting it the first time around.

I don't know, unfortunately. I think the skin is cool but I've no intention to pay for it. Look around on the subreddit or the playhearthstone website, you'll probably come up with something.
---
I mean I agree with you that I like to play a variety of decks but I guess if the dude just REALLY likes Priest and is only going to play Priest anyway then it's cheaper to play that way
---
Appreciate the info.
---
I wouldn't say it's crazy as it is at best an extra +3/+3 per turn if you use all your coins just for buffs, and if you have an open slot. Come late game your coins might be better spent refilling looking for triples or upgrades unless you already have all your pieces.

---
Yea, 3 full expansions and 3 required in between expansions.
---
Gotta pay every 8 weeks now... feels like a confirmation of the price of the game having more than doubled over the years.
---
You don't have to wait. They're all in the client. There's a check box in the crafting menu that says "Include uncraftable cards." You can read the flavor text of every card.
---
Or you can look in the official [card library](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards), but that doesn't have every card in the set yet.
---
I see you mixed up a lot of the other invoke descriptions as well. Don't mix up Galakrond's Battlecry (written on the card itself ) with Invoke/Galakrond's Hero Power (seperate effect).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;**Priest -- Galakrond's Wit**. 。。。。the Priest version of Invoke "destroys 1 random enemy minion" and a fully buffed Galakrond will kill 4, which would be most if not all of the other player's board。。。
---
Priest Invoke - adds a random priest minion into your hand. "The destroy 1 random minion" effect is a specific card called Timerip that happens to have invoke as well.
---
&gt;Reminder that the Rogue version of Invoke draws a card &amp; reduces its cost to (0),
---
Rogue Invoke = Adds a random lackey to your hand, does not reduce to zero. 
---
&gt;The Shaman version of Invoke summons two 2/2s with Rush, which means with a fully upgraded Galakrond, they're *bloody 8/8s* with Rush.
---
Shaman Invoke = Summon 2/1 with Rush. The 2/2s upgrading to 8/8s are Galakronds Battlecry, not invoke.
---
Or Alleria. Lol.

Evasive is good. Elusive is for people who don't own a dictionary.

My first game of Rafaam I immediately got the curators amalgam because he had buffed it up and placed it first on turn 3. Allowed me to run 3 amalgams on board and beef em all up to hell and win.
---
Then damned if we do and damned if we don't.  
---
I personally don't give a shit about MMR anymore once I remember we're in beta.  Not sure why the majority of players would in a system that has previously fundamentally rewarded playing more games.
---
Not me, as of 2 hrs ago. 
---
- Mobile only player
---
Thank you!
---
Interesting. So I could just dust the ones from classes I don't usually play, so in the off-chance that it happens again they probably wouldn't the ones affected.
---
same
---
Pity timer for wild packs?
---
You raise a good point. Edwin works on units already on your board and can buff them round after round.
---
But Rag has the Elemental tag, yet no elemental synergies work on him when played as the hero.
---
So what's your point?
---
Very good. Upgonked
---
Well this will make tomorrow more fun.
---
Is it LEGO-compatible by any chance? )
---
Blessings to you.
---
This has been the best day in HS history for a long time! I just bought all 3 discounted heroes to show you guys I appreciate the effort! heck yeah boys
---
It would be REALLY nice if they removed that stupid interaction. Literally no other card in the entire game is countered as hard as this. This goes beyond a simple 'hate' card.
---
yes like with the old adventures
---
I’d say the vast majority is safe to dust, unless you find enjoyment in having a huge collection regardless of their playability. Also like I said, Blizzard gives you free copies to use for the event if you don’t own them yourself, so don’t worry about it too much. :)
---
Concede button intensifies
---
Huh never realised lol
---
Fair point and I imagine no doubt Team 5 are looking into something like that (stopping the huge gaps at least) with their comments around normalization.
---
This is the correct answer based on the past.  Don't think they announce times so we don't swarm the servers opening packs.
---
Yeah, and I'm sorry that they did, because I'm just not a fan of the old adventures. I think that this isn't a step in the direction that I'd like the see the game take. Ah well.
---
lol it wasnt nerfed. the deck was straight up destroyed. thank fuck
---
Glinda's "entire point" was to enable you to play multiple copies of a minion over the course of a turn, more so than you would feasibly be able to otherwise. I don't see how the change has killed the entire point of the card.
---
"Yes Yes Yes Yes" oh my god
---
This may be for all mobile. Getting problems in iOS. Will give it a try.
---
Go ahead, summon another! Nobody’s looking.
---
idc what anyone says, I always love the censoring everything with eyes gag
---
Looks like someone created this card specifically for the memes....and it's already working wonders! lol
---
https://twitter.com/Zanananan/status/1166026356997742592?s=19
---
That's fair
---
This made my day
---
As cool as reckless experimenter was, being able to quickly reduce a card's cost to 0 is pretty always pretty dangerous. It never looks like a dangerous effect until it suddenly is, and experimenter is the perfect example of that. The card was basically unplayable, until it was so obviously broken they preemptively nerfed it.
---
I think the effect is just as interesting after being nerfed, just less abuseable.
---
There's always a tier 1 warlock deck. There still is
---
Tbh i think they had to make all these changes with League's card game coming out. They'll have competition for once really and it shows with their current output of stuff
---
I thought this card got nerfed because of the mecha'thun deck. What deck used snip snap and this card?
---
That would be noob and dumb and under 3 years old.
---
For everyone else should be fine
---
I would like someone to please ask this at a HS panel and not yield the mic until they’re forced off, and just keep insisting  you’re entitled to use your entire allotted turn time to ask the question. Cuz that’s how it feels.

&gt;With this update, players on low-end devices may experience degraded performance. We’re continuing our efforts to address this issue and optimize Hearthstone Battlegrounds
---
I don't know about that "low-end" part, my Pixel 10 was pretty solid running Battlegrounds before and now it's unplayable. The early game wasn't so bad (by which I mean bad but playable), but by round 8 or so I was starting every turn at the rope. And also everything was slow and laggy, so figure maybe 5-10 seconds effective. By round 10 I literally could not take actions - the timer ran out before the tavern finished loading.
---
What happened was I evolved some random minion into a 10 drop and it happened to be him. So I played Barista and got two in my hand and then played both and then shudderwocked. Needless to say, I won.
---
that is all players. They are tons of casual players who play a couple games. So they are all between 4k-4.3k
---
Yes on desktop and mobile and it still lets me queue with them. My opponent had them too.
---
Y’all laughin, but now my echo sea giants deck guarantees rush on the big swing turn cuz of this!
---
OH NO!!!!!!
---
WARLOCK GOES FROM FIVE COMPETITIVE WILD DECKS TO **ONLY FOUR**!!!!!
---
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE MESSLY OFFERINGS OF RENO LOCK, CUBE WARLOCK, MECHA'THUN WARLOCK, AND DARKEST HOUR WARLOCK?!?!?
---
# WILD SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A TIER S WARLOCK DECK ON TOP!!!!!!!!!
---
Zayle didn't change in Uldum, why would is change for Descent of Dragons?
---
The hero balance is pretty wild right now so removing the worst or best heroes helps make the game seem less instant lost from the start.
---
Shadowverse implemented a similar system, though the cards didn't come with expansions, they were just added to the pool of cards from the expansion. Hence it was called a "mini-expansion", and while everyone loves the new cards, people HATE how expensive it makes the game.
---
I expect f2p players will decry the same thing of the 3 expansion, 3 adventure cycle after long enough
---
Spell paladin definitely wasn't player made, it was pushed not quite enough during rhastakhans rumble, particularly with their spirit and loa. And while other classes get kinda one off archetypes and concepts, they get way less of them. And with recruit warrior for example, they've been continuing to support it (in the form of bug warrior), eureka shaman wasn't really an archetype designed intentionally, it was just one card, and spell hunter got a decent number of support cards accross multiple expansions, with a hero card, a legendary weapon, and lots of just good spells. Dead man's hand warrior again wasn't really an intentional archetype, it was just one card that people built a deck around. Paladin has been absolutely getting the most one off archetypes, and they often only get a couple cards. Seriously, look at 1 health paladin, or the new pure paladin. 2 or 3 cards each, and that is true for many other of their archetypes. Mech has been getting more support, but it's all over the place and doesn't form much of anything coherent. You've got kangors army which supports big things, then lots of smaller mechs, you've got reborn mechs to mess up the pool with, and now they're getting a wide board aggro sort of mech. Heal paladin is probably the most cohesive kinda, but it's also just been pretty bad in general and had probably Judy gotten worst this expansion, with not having any chance of being dominant because of plate breaker.
---
yup, our exclusive club is over :(
---
I still don't get it...
---
Yeah it's the first time I've seen my OnePlus drop frames for literally anything, hope they is this as an excuse to polish the whole HS client
---
They just have to bring reckless experimenter back.
---
So, any Midrange oriented deck playing Zul'jin is a variant of Spell Hunter?
---
Wild also doesn't matter in this discussion as Spell Hunter does not exist as a competitive archetype in Wild
---
But that's just a Mecha'thun deck. It only has the one strategy. Nothing too different from all the other Mecha'thuns
---
A better version of the shitty version of token druid we have now? Or a better version of the actually good versions of token druid we have had in the past? A deck with more power than current token druid isn't very impressive.
---
My guess is it’s similar to karazhan where you win specific cards based on winning specific wings, karazhan was awesome
---
I have waited 3 years for this very moment
---
They've been more generous with events and rewards this year because sales were down two years in a row and they're starting to have competition.
---
Even so, the gradual shift from expac--adventure--expac--advtr; to expac--expac--expac; to expac+advtr--expac+advtr--expac+advtr,  drives up the cost of the game by quite a bit.
---
Additionally, sets are now designed heavily around the two legendaries that each class receives, so if you're Druid this expansion you're very likely either crafting Ysera or you're crafting Goru, because all the other Druid cards synergize with one of those two.
---
Not to mention that meta shakeups are more frequent now, which makes the game fresher more often but also requires you to revise your decks and craft new cards if you want to maintain competitiveness.
---
So a lot of factors have made the game more expensive over the years, while only a few have made it cheaper.  I think that Blizzard would like to push up the cost of the game further, so it's up to the community to prevent that from happening.  Voting with your wallet has been proven to work, based on the recent moves to restore goodwill after an extended exodus of the playerbase since 2017, so that is certainly good news.
---
How good of an archetype it is in wild doesn't change the fact that you could make a full, cohesive, spell hunter deck there because there are enough related cards. And no, not every midrange deck with zuljin is spell hunter, but decks that run like 80+% spells and zuljin are. I have made decks like that myself, and they're not bad. They are similar to spell hunter of old, just with a couple solid minions mixed in.
---
Hero is so broken
---
The change didn't affect the mecathun combo at all. It's just that Ticking Abomination is gone.
---
I feel like one or two problem cards is not enough to warrant leaving the meta stale. I didn't enjoy this last event because of one card, not because of the concept. There just needs to be more thought and playtesting before they do one of these. If you think back to the KoFT meta where it was Keleseth in all tempo decks I feel like the attempt to mix up the meta is better than letting the meta become stagnant.
---
Same question?
---
Old adventures you could buy with gold and specify the wing, so didn’t have to pay for cards you didn’t want
---
&gt;If this all ends up being too expensive for the average player I would favor them going back to the old Adventure-Expansion-Adventure Modell completely.
---
There's no chance of that, they are doing this instead of that.
---
I do not see a problem with it. It is not like you play Kazakus in a ton of different decks or try to shove Inner fire into other archetypes.
---
WutFace
---
I'm really disappointed how little publicity this is getting. I watched the first game yesterday on Twitch and there were 500 viewers.
---
It's a pretty important milestone of Olympics recognition - it deserves better.
---
Time to go back to Anduin if every pleb is gonna have it
---
A lot of turns selling that junk minion for one more refresh that you will have to freeze anyhow isn't great.
---
This turns those turns into a +2/+2
---
Oh, I'm not saying there's a problem with it. It's a viable deck, just not fun for me. There's no point for me to play if I don't have fun. It doesn't take too much in my opinion to pick a top tier meta deck, play it to its strengths, and play as often as possible in order to reach a high rank on ladder. It just takes hours and hours.

[FuFtgameFoff]  i hope one goes far im out im through fucking with this bullshit im taking my daughter and we are done.

---
You’re right. That’s not what I meant.. I think that they fixed Luna’s relatively quick. I do appreciate the initiative they’re taking. However, I knew that the wild event would be shit before it was announced. If it had lasted as long as the event did, it would’ve been amazing. But personally, the fact that the meta was left UNTOUCHED in Standard for months despite of all the backlash is worrisome. I lost all will to play Hearthstone. Battlegrounds is the only thing I’ve played in a month. At the end of the day, I think that these events (at least the aforementioned two) have been more damaging than anything else.. Arguably, it would’ve been better to leave the meta alone.
---
Her emotes are alright, but none of them are as good as "Wow."
---
I appreciate your honesty and genuinely agree with you! I should have either deleted this post after realizing or even better, I should have read the MechWarper text first! Good stuff mate!
---
Company making money off of expired stuff? Yea I believe it.
---
Nothing like a gigantic dump of the old meta decks to really hammer home this "fresh" change in the meta.
---
interesting = confusing as hell but I don't really mind
---
Looking at the new store page seems like such a hassle though.
---
Crashed my game entirely.  Literally just a black screen at present.
---
Who wore it better? Britney Spears or Garrosh?
---
Yeah how dare someone ask for the opportunity to give Blizzard money?
---
You lucky bastard!
---
yes, i forgot their name. thank you.
---
You likely did. Basically hearthstone has been rotating cards into the wild format to keep standard fresh. I.e. You may have had sylvanis but she was only playable in wild. For a short special event (ran from Halloween ish to present) a handful of "old cards" were given for free to everyone to play in standard, and now they are gone. Any of the ones you owned previously you will still have, they are just only playable in wild.
---
&gt; It isn’t a surprise when you take a look at ‘x meta deck’ in Shadowverse and it costs equal to or considerably more than a Control Warrior deck in Hearthstone these days.
---
You can only compare them in such a statement when you take the economy into consideration.  
---
I've only ever managed the tutorial of shadowverse but what is there equivalent "dust" system like?   
---
If it's like for like then yeah ok, fair point.  However if they were giving back double the value you get in HS then it's night and day difference and the 35 cards we get from the adventure won't matter too much.  
---
The other points we'll need look at when the cards drop is if they a) can be dusted and b) do we still get free packs from "wings"?  
---
If no packs and no dust then it's far worse imo to what we had before (well depending on useful the cards are in the meta).  
---
If you can dust and no packs then is the value worth more than the packs?  
---
If you can dust and get packs then that would be awesome and I'd be happily surprised.
---
Thank you very much.  App is literally unusable right now.  (Just a black screen.)
---
Well they couldn't test on Android because they all have iPhones.
---

well ya considering how many millions of players they have who didnt even log in or log in once and only played 1 game of battleground etc.
---
Big Ol’ Whelp is my favorite. I love how adorable this fella is while resting and cleaning his/her eye. The idea of a fat, enforced, and seemingly defenseless baby dragon is adorable.
---
Fuck off commie.
---
Ah, I thought it looked a bit strange...
---
Haha thanks, I always picked night elf because I liked to make new characters and unlock achievements by lvl 4 instead of lvl 10 like everyone else, and I liked hunter because animals are cool and I liked buying ammo.  I was a weird kid, but I don’t know what you’re mentioning, are night elf hunters noob meta picks or something?  I never really played the game with meta in mind.
---
wow the way shadowverse does it sounds really bad lol. but the way blizzard does is also bad. first it was expansion-adventure-expansion. then they changed it to expansion-expansion-expansion. then they added adventures back, which don't give anything. (by anything i mean any new cards). and now they are squeezing in adventures which gives new cards and keep the 3 expansions. that's a big increase in cost. and considering adventure cards have always been "must have", everyone has to spend money/gold on it. i assume it's gonna be something like 700 gold x 4-5 wings. this basically means 35 less packs for f2p players who use saved gold to buy packs, since we now need to keep some of the saved gold for adventure.
---
Combo Priest and Murloc Shaman are back baby!
---
Not updating for me on PC either. Can't even play the game because it kicks me saying update required when i launch. Clicking "Check for updates" says the client is already up to date. Tried reinstalling but that didn't work either. 
---
NA also.
---
...?
---
Yea it sucks the other mid expansion balance updates were free and this one will cost.
---
More like... GAY'dan! Ha! GAYYYYYY!
---
No, but for real, it is great to see Gul'dan finally be true to himself. He can lifetap into his soul, but it takes a real man to tap into his heart &lt;3
---
They already left standard, they left this patch today.
---
&gt; People said they'd never do classic before Blizzard ever commented publicly about it
---
And then proved people they were right....?
---
I didn't get your point.
---
True, but as long as your opponent has at least one mob on the board, you can sac your treant and clear the way. Regardless, as the other comment said, [[Force of Nature]] is a better  enabler with Aeroponics.
---
Wait so there are cards gated by forced adventure pve purchases again? Ew... If that's true that sucks, I hate having to sink my gold into PVE modes I play once when I could just get packs and play my preferred way...
---
That is not the point it is more the fact that it is more content you need to buy. Imagine having to pay gold for the wild return stuff. This is exactly that.
---
And they printed a anti dragon card that makes dragons mostly irrelevant. It is too risky to play them in the early and mid game and late game he is probably sandbagging 2x 8/8's with rush for four mana each.
---
I just want to thank you because people like you who treat reddit like its a formal debate never cease to entertain me
---
&gt; These statements started before blizzard said anything.
---
Yeah, and when blizzard said it they just said "told ya!".
---
That is not true as the cost of HS went waaay up. Also a lot of events give less then there older counterparts.
---
*Laughs in free legendary every first 10 packs
---
If this is like the old adventures and the cards are good, it's much worth than buying 7 packs
---
Very nice
---
The same selfish people who will complain if student loan debt is forgiven because *I already paid mine*
---
For the record, so did I, and pray others get the same opportunity
---
Not even brand new phones. I'm playing on a Galaxy S10+, which is pretty much top of the line, and still have big framerate issues in later turns.
---
You use Rafaam before combat and you get the first minion that died from your opponent. So it's kind of random what you get, good opponents might adjust their positioning before combat to not give you stuff that's too good.
---
unearthed raptor was more 3rd jade card.
---
but rogues 2jade cards were weaker /Slower then others and other classes have extra synergy aswell.
---
who's that?
---
Aggro is not a four letter word. Try it sometime. You get a lot of free wins from people with hard-ons for control decks wasting resources inefficiently because they don't understand what a bait is.
---
Shadowverse packs are extreme overpriced. Like 90 bucks gets me 50 packs. That is fucking ridiculous and not to mention that each expansion releases 3 legendaries. It’s one of the reason I actually want to quit the game because how hard it is on the wallet
---
Thanks!
---
And also there's the fact that basic cards are made to be subpar on purpose. They're basically just "Use it until you can afford a good deck" cards
---
This is incorrect. When the change rolled out it applied to sets you had already opened as well.
---
Knowing Blizzard, they'll probably revert this nerf long after it goes into the Wild pool to get praise for "actually doing something with Wild from a balance perspective".
---
I think what they did is a great idea
---
The old adventures are back. The nostalgia.
---
There’s still too many trash heroes and murlocs are taking over.
---
HiddenAKN#1361 NA trade 80g, I show you go first.
---
Rafaam is actually broken. What were they thinking? The power would still be OP at 2 mana and balanced at 3
---
Wow it was all a big masterplan
---
&gt;edit: some players are literally losing more mmr for 2nd than they gain for 1st.
---
Lol. This signifies a problem with their probabilistic model. MMR systems were originally designed for low-luck games such as Chess, where a stronger player almost always beats a weaker player. In Chess, if a strong player loses to a weak player, it means they were massively overrated, so their rating should decrease a lot.
---
Battlegrounds, obviously, is not like this. No matter how good you are, you can low-roll and have no chance at 1st. But it's hard to reflect this in the probabilistic model. The distributions most commonly used, the normal distribution and the logistic distribution, underemphasize the role of luck in deciding games between players that are far apart in skill. (This is *especially* a problem for the normal distribution, because of its thin tails.)
---
sylvanas isnt that great. And Rafaam is tier 0 SSS +
---
They will be craftable, but most likely only to those who bought the Adventure (either with money or gold). So either way you’ll need to get the Adventure and then it’s up to you to keep or dust the cards.
---
This is just going based off the classic style Adventures from back in the day btw, this could change but we’ll have to wait and see when we get more info.
---
It's more that there's much more support for control and combo than the last few expansions. With the exception of a few big boy legendaries like hakkar and Nomi, we got almost zero big boy slammerino cards.
---
True
---
she is below average
---
Believe me I tried my hand at aggro. It is just not fun for me to play.
---
List?
---
Believe me hs price point is way more generous then sv. Sv has 4 expansions with 4 mini expansions that that force you to get more packs of the packs you opened already and you are not even guaranteed to get the leggo you want cause you can get more then 3 copies.  I would prefer this system 100 times when what shadowverse does cause at least you are guaranteed all the cards in the adventure
---
It's correct, but then Id have to forego playing arena to flesh out my missing collection from the card exoansion just 6-8 weeks prior.
---
I’m with you on Violet Spellwing. Interestingly, the same artist happened to do two more of my favorite pieces of art this set: Envoy of Lazul and Stowaway.
---
Aside from those, I think Ramming Speed is a terrific illustration, and I really like the way the shaman cards Invocation of Frost and Storm’s Wrath capture the set’s theme.
---
Which ones are trash?
---
How much gold is the new expansion
---
No fellow human, I am human just like you. I spit hot fire and blow everyone away when I enter a room, just like all humans do.
---
I like when he says 'thats what I would have picked'. Really bob? Did I have a choice?

Agreed, also people need to learn to play around his hero power and not just give away your really lightfang/brann to the rafaam.
---
Sounds like the only pleb here is you.
---
echo isn't in the same field as "repeatable this turn"
---
I was just thinking about making this meme while my client was updating and here it is lol
---
I never got the chance to play that hero which discounts the tavern😭
---
Maybe you should spend less time being concerned about what other people have.
---
there were many different ideas thrown 1000x
---
Wasn't she behind a $50 paywall before?
---
Saviours of Sanity
---
I mean r/Amish is a rather popular sub, so it’s not all downsides.
---
Oh my god. For a week I’ve been 200 points from top 200. Chasing. Every. Single. Day. I was 50 points out yesterday morning but had a bad day and dropped 100 points. Today I finished 4th place twice and lost over 20 points each time.
---
I'm not that high of a rank
---
they nerfed Echo, and glinda gives echo to things. If anything you should be questioning why not all echo cards are getting a refund, and the answer is simple: they were never used in a "reduce cost to 0" scenario
---
We're getting more hearthstone content, and it is coming in the form of an adventure, which people have been clambering for for quite a while now. It's better that they release this in place of another dungeon crawl and look at the community reception to it to better figure out what to make in the future.
---
It's about fucking time tbh
---
Now add all the other basic qol shit we've been requesting for years.
---
I actually lost access to a lot of cards i was using earlier for this tavern brawl. Feeling pretty pissed about it
---
Echo cards can no longer cost 0
---
Well the update hasn't taken my regular ones.
---
They want your money. Only then can you see stats. For some reason.
---
Thanks, I didn't know about that
---
What a stupid change, never play this game again. Blizzard destroyed everything again
---
Well not sure how Underlords did it since I never played the game, but in TFT (Riot's autobattler) ladder has always been 99% about skill and 1% about time played (after the first month at least). An easy proof is that the guy who finished first on Europe (West server which is by far the best EU server) in season 1 also finished second on his smurf account and that you could reach top 50 of any ladder in the world in less than 100 games played if you were good enough. The rating system on HS battleground was definitely pure garbage though and I hope it's going to be better now and that Blizzard is going to do something similar to what Riot does at some point.
---
Why not?
---
eh. i'll get packs with gold when expansion releases anyway. sucks for people who only play bg tho.
---
I built a big priest deck and was shocked to see 3 janky ass regular decks that seemed like someone copied their standard deck code to the tavern brawl. wtf.
---
They will not be added to any set, you cannot open them in any cardpack. You will get 2 copies (1 for legendaries) of after completing wings.
---
Only those people who **buy** that content will therefore have access to these 35 cards. Pay to win, if you will.
---
No one ever talks about Khadgar :(
---
Anyone knows why NZoth is missing from the collection?
---
How do I know if I am Shadowbanned?
---
Sub 5k gaming omegalulz
---
Yeah so? Isn't that a way to remain friendly even though you're angry?
---
I can't find Nzoth anymore in my collection..
---
This is just so amazing that I don’t even know what to say other than fuck YES!!
---
0s turn at round 5 I conceded cause unplayable now. Why is hearthstone so goddamn demanding on connection and performance?
---
It works for private gatherings. Not only does it say that on the gatherings page for the event, but it also worked like that last expansion. It is most likely not up yet, even though it says the event starts on Dec. 6th. It probably won't be active until 10 AM PST.
---
Log out of reddit and go to your username account page. If you're shadowbanned (like HelicopterBenjamin is), it'll show the "page not found" message.
---
Shadowbanned comments and posts show up on mod queue so we can see them easily. Some of them are clearly bots/spam accounts and we just dispose of them. If the accounts look like normal accounts, we usually drop them a note to tell them.
---
P.S. You're not shadowbanned.
---
It's a build that you have to survive for a while and high roll to pull off and there are several counters to it.
---
I'm not a fan of the knee-jerk reaction to always remove powerful things from the game. Powerful things are what makes the game fun.  If you remove this comp then some other comp will be the next thing everyone complains about so you have to remove that as well. Having multiple powerful late-game builds is a good thing. If you can pull this off it *should* be powerful.
---
Ever heard of Warcraft TCG?
---
I always thought this should be Echo.
---
Can someone explain this to me?

well then so does unstable evolution

And I told you other people’s collection doesn’t affect your own gameplay. You didn’t cancel your prime since you got Tyrande. Lot of people are paying the exact same sub for prime as you, and they are probably paying for packs and other cosmetic items in Blizzard games. Just consider this as an appreciation from Blizzard and not Twitch.
---
Happened to me before idk why or how
---
i clicked just for that thumbnail.
---
Man that really sucks! Hopefully they'll figure out what's wrong soon. I would be real salty if I had that many hero skins I couldn't use
---
he can always sell it
---
So now we will have to pay for adventures too, which is bad.
---
That's kind of stupid. But you go ahead and let what other people do dictate what you do.
---
So you admit to being a pleb?
---
Won my first game with Sylvanas, it's really quite good
---
Since other guy didn’t really read your post:  a golden legendary counts as having that legendary. 
---
If you disenchant golden Captain, then your next legendary will be Captain (but obviously probably won’t be golden).
---
You make an excellent point, wow
---
Is it me, or is this comment incredibly childish?
---
"Oh no.. I don't want to share this special toy with the other children"
---
In patch notes they said some devices will experience this.
---
For some reason I though non-echoed wisp would also cost 1
---
Love that the destruction of free speech and slowing purchase numbers have motivated to you to sooth the fan base with shit that was clearly easy to implement and we have been asking for for years.
---
its on wild,team 5 rarely care about card design distrupting wild untill its too late
---
Has been happening to some people for past month or so.  Just close and reopen HS to get them back.
---
No more?
---
"GrEeTiNgS
---
Then you didnt get the point of having different portraits. I personally use Maiev cuz i love her and i prefer Malfurion over Lunara so i use malfurion. The point is playing with a hero you like .
---
The light shall burn you!
---
True, and i guess pretty much everyone agrees that rafaam will be balanced at 2 mana hero power.
---
Uh. Yeah. Already done that several dozen times. Not working.
---
Waste of resources.
---
"I had this toy first. I don't wanna share... *waaah-waaaaah*"
---
Typically cards cpming out means some of them shouls be meta or its a pointless investment.
---
Uh
---
NO! NOT AGAIN!!!!
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!?!?
---
You can also only play against other unpatched people, so it’s always fair.
---
No
---
Oh no. How will I ever cope? I’ll have to cry into my 3200 dust for the next expansion
---
aggro, it always aggro ... pirate warrior stormhammer hunter and mech paladin paladin
---
as for new decks, i feel like treant token druid(kind of existed before but is so much better now), dragon highlander mage, dragon paladin, galakrond shaman, control dragon shaman, tempo galakrond warrior, and tempo galakrond rogue will be the main standouts in terms of strength, they all seem very solid.
---
For fun decks, i'm hoping waxadred rogue will be good, and i'm also going to try to make a galakrond otk priest deck that uses fate weaver to discount leeroy, embalming ritual, wretched reclaimer, and grave rune for a 30 damage combo. who knows if it will be good but i think it'll at least be fun
---
There will be an abundance of Pirate Warrior day 1 to ruin the fun of new undefined decks, feelsbadman
---
I miss the times when adventures gave you cards.
---
Totally agree, he's like the Dane of Standard, with more snark and less expression
---
No, wrong mummy whoops.
---
Finley would be my guess! I'd probably take her over the nerfed Mech lady-gnome as well. That said Wagtoggle surprisingly isn't actually *that* bad, before the update the few stats that were available suggested they had a reasonable win rate and average placement for a mid/low tier hero. Higher than some of the more popular mid tier heroes that It's just such a dull and low-impact hero power.
---
Making people insane... I think annoyotron took that spot already.
---
Rat-king and AFK can still be OK. Pathwerk pretty much bottom of the pile for me now though. 10 extra HP just not a big deal.
---
Well it's in wild so who cares.
---
Nice work.
---
Let me ask a question: why did you leave the card float on a black background? Couldn't you enlarge the card?
---
Holy shit C'thun would need a lot of number tracking.
---
Now that there are both 3 expansions and adventure things are worse now.
---
But adventures are far better for a budget player than a full-set. It's much cheaper and gives you a lot of guaranteed strong cards, and legendaries. From a pure math stand point (Gold to Dust), adventures are just better. 
---
And if you do actually want to spend money, then adventures were the first thing you would want to buy, better than the per-orders even. 
---
Also dust and gold are one to one in value. And every pack you buy of the same expansion has diminishing returns because you are more likely to run into duplicates (a problem adventures don't have). So you should really only be buying packs at the start of an expansion, crafting what you need, then saving till the next.
---
oof
---
No I haven't, and I didn't know this. So this makes my warning void basically :)
---
Cool, DNP since the update. Tnx
---
do you please sell this to blizzard so i can buy this legitimately?
---
yeah, but no cards were directly changed this time. this was a change to the echo keyword. we didn't get a pop-up for the discover change, either.
---
Especially since they tend to include a decent number of legendaries.
---
\*/s
---
I know that but me not enjoying the new content wont change anything. I dont care about politics.
---
I can't count that high.
---
W8 isn't they used to be a sound of bell otk along with zephyrs to get a sorcerer apprentice?
---
You can hover over your deck and it tells you how many cards are in your hand.
---
I don’t know where you are from but private use is generally not an issue
---
I like the idea for rolling fireball, but seems just a straight upgrade from flame lance.  /s
---
I’m pretty sure someone copied the idea for rolling fireball. How lazy of the creator to just copy and past with a very minor difference!
---
Honestly, I would probably stick to Wild. Your old deck may not be Tier 1 anymore, but you can probably craft the 5-6 new cards to add to it.
---
Trying to create a standard deck now just 4 months before rotation seems like a waste of resources.
---
It's probably not 3 expansions and 1 adventure. It will be 3 expansions and 3 adventures.
---
arena is the worst advice you can give. Only very skilled players can go infinite and even then its NOT worth the time.
---
A first glimpse of what the top new heroes look like after the patch. Please keep in mind that the sample size is still pretty low, so things might look different in a couple of days.  
---
For reference, here are the [top 5 heroes before the patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dzi9ng/firestone_best_battlegrounds_heroes_by_average/).
---
And the usual caveat: this gathers the data from players across all MMRs, so it might not reflect the tier lists from top players you see here and there. I'd really like to provide a better breakdown of stats per rank, but I don't have enough data for now.  
---
So if you'd like to contribute, please [give Firestone a try](https://www.firestoneapp.com), especially if your MMR is 6000+ (you'll also get some achievements in the process).
---
It's not so unthinkable that someone couldn't come up with it at the same time using the same ruleset. After all, two people invented calculus at the same time.

But by then the deck would probably be worse than the normal version of Shudderwock
---
Think they meant you get all the galakronds for free
---
Which iirc is true
---
The reverse MTG circle: digital back to physical
---
Most likely
---
When he came out, I had to ask somebody from my family if they had an IOS device that I could make a purchase on. I was lucky enough that somebody just bought a new one at that time
---
That's because treant is not a tribe but a specific minion(which might have a different art sometimes ig.)
---
Where did you get thede made? Or how? What kind of paper/printer/service was ised for this?
---
I bought the bundles because of the new hero portraits
---
Well, by that logic it should also be a Silver Hand Recruit and a Lackey.
---
The game has... a degree of satisfaction that it’s THE REAL CARDS IN YOUR HANDS YOU CAN FLIP THEM OVER SHUFFLE THEM FLEX THEM OH YES, the drawback is doing things manually like placing buff tokens, shuffling copies into your deck, remembering when your secret triggers... You also can’t build your deck; I’ve printed four decks with a couple of cards for each to swap out. It’s definitely not a replacement for the app, just an indulgent variant.
---
&gt; Oh yeah, like adding 3 new adventures per year you need to collect to keep up. 
---
Which has not been announced. On the contrary both the blizzcon panel and todays announcement make it seem like that adventure is a 1 time thing to celebrate the end of the year of the dragon and the finale of the current storyline.
---
Decent card quality, no need to laminate. I could buy sleeves for them all, but I don’t even do that for my other card games.
---
I hope it finds no peace
---
This is a nice table. I've really wanted to get back into Reno decks and this may do it, especially since I loved dragon Reno mage back in the day
---
oger
---
You are using less than instead of greater then. The way you've listed these, murloc is worst. Also, deathrattle isn't bad, but it doesn't have an easy natural build path (and still requires amalgam support).
---
How often do you get an echo card to cost 0?
---
They’re screen caps from the pc game. About 180dpi on the printed cards. The blurriness is there but almost unnoticeable. 
---
Can’t share the files though sorry, Blizzard would cook my feet and eat them.
---
Golden brann is still 'tilted' even after getting new dragons patch
---
That's not how much damage you did to a hero. That's how much damage you did in the battle lol
---
This might be the best patch Blizzard has ever done in hs. Psyched to play around with new battlegrounds meta
---
Give him stuff that deal dmg to him when played. Like only that.
---
Oh that makes way more sense. I thought its a bug that counts my stats as dmg to a hero instead of the actual damage lol
---
I decided Wednesday night I was gonna finally plug through and finish chapter 5 of heroic Dalaran Heist. Got the Sound the Bells combo, and it was my only strategy ... my desk was mediocre at best, I couldn't get decent pulls or treasures otherwise.  
---
Finally got through all 11 bosses, decided to take a break and return on Thursday to finish off final boss 12. 
---
Imagine my ~~surprise~~ rage when I went to combo on turn 4.
---
Thats really cool! So does it play like an actual boardgame/cardgame? I’ve always wanted something like that
---
He finally managed to win with jaraxus demons though. That's an achievement
---
This is correct.
---
I think they're 140 person team now.
---
Can't happen soon enough
---
Are you able to open packs now?
---
Agreed
---
The developer dilemma, do you adapt community ideas into your game when they're interesting enough, or do you avoid doing it so you don't get called out for copying community ideas.
---
yeah I was disappointed by that as well. I get limited size of mobile (both storage size and display), but I thought I'd get to see a record of every place I finished for each character. 
---
At the very least show me total number of times I've placed in every spot.
---
Vior#21833 trading in EU, I show and you go first. thanks
---
What about druids with 3k armour?
---
Highlander Mage is looking good indeed. Maybe it i'snt a super competitive deck, but I've always loved the Reno decks because of all the variety they can present in different games.
---
Awesome!
---
Mine still hadn’t updated as of like an hour ago
---
Yea, that's the only possible solution lol, i though i had them maybe...
---
They're not that small anymore. In a [Q&amp;A in January 2017](https://youtu.be/CDbIaA_ro0Q?t=2110), they mentioned that the team has over 70 members. By now, it may have grown a lot more.. And then there are likely a lot of contractors for art, music and voices.
---
But it did fuck up the sound in my game
---
Oh that's pretty good, but I'm wondering if it'll confuse new players
---
Unplayable on a razer 2 gaming phone
---
Mad at what it used to be. It was only bad because mage is bad right now. I put it in a memey quest mage and it was still able to win games or create huge swings for me
---
Guys, it's literally coded as different keywords
---
Sound the Bells was also problematic, though not as much as Snip.
---
Why isn't there a stat for total games played?
---
Thanks! I made them and I’m heaps happy how they turned out. They look as good or even better than the ones in some of my board games. 
---
Tokens were printed on a colour printer, no cool tricks there. Printed token sheets were glued to 2mm thick cardboard with spray adhesive. The cardboard is from an art shop, and would be used by art &amp; design students to mount their assignments. 
---
Hexagonal tokens were cut out with a metal ruler and a scalpel. It took a dog’s age and never want to do it again!

Circular tokens were cut with a homebrew was punch, a short bit of metal pipe with the rim of one end sharpened with a lathe. By a friend of mine who is an industrial arts high school teacher. I’ll post some wad punch pics in the near future.
---
Oh wow you’re actually in this subreddit. Must be close to a set release
---
Had forseen this to.
---
Oof
---
also me. I abused it to during final boss fight in chapter 3. Both players will be destroyed and you will return to fight him again. Kinda like the 0 mana Hearthstone card lol.
---
If you’re in a special tavern brawl area yes. But you can view cards in the crafting menu but you can’t craft them yet, you can just see them
---
&gt;One stupid design is all that's ever really needed to push an already functioning deck into being completely degenerate or forming a completely degenerate deck around it. 
---
Yea, but you could say this for literally any deck. Given enough support, any archetype can be good no matter how dumb it is.
---
I crafted dreadsteed
---
Me: "It's small, but it's literally infinite in value!"
---
\\\*craft\\\*
---
Me, deckbuilding: Wait, where is it?
---
I think the game doesn't check immediately at the start of the round.  This happened to Kripp on screen, buying or selling ANY minion will trigger the triple.
---
Hi :)
---
Exactly the 10th after the expansion goes live and the new store is updated. Historically you could buy the expansion in the webpage, but since the store is gonna get updated with the expansion my guess is this time you will not be able to do that.
---
Tbf Azure Drake is probably fine to come back now anyway, there are already good 5 drops in the game now, not every deck would play it.
---
Awesome, right? 3 games with druid and you get 180 gold, boom.
---
Cards were printed and die cut professionally, although the cut quality varied a bit. The corners were cut by hand (not by me) with a corner cutter, which you can get at craft and stationery stores. 
---
Tokens were all cut out by me though. Very tough cardboard, it joked my fingers for a while!
---
What competition lol? Despite other card games existing in the market, none of them compete with hearthstone. Not really. They're different games for different types of players. Most of this isnt even that new, but what benefits they *are* adding, are purely because player numbers are dropping from people simply getting bored of the same stale and expensive game.
---
Thanks now I want it all :)
---
Outjerked again.
---
gonna look into it thanks
---
just a bummer that this way got ruined, crafted a couple of epics for nothing now :/
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I tried this out and it seems I got farther than normal as my settings and friends icons appeared on the screen as well.
---
Sadly, they weren't clickable and I was still trapped at the doors =(
---
Problem with coating/laminating is that it increases the card thickness to much, making it stand out during shuffling. Pencil is ok if the user is careful, and I make sure they are...
---

I’ll just flood imgur and drop a link in reddit land then.

---
I didn’t know I wanted this but now I *really* want this.
---
And reddit comprehensive reading skills as usual with you it seems. Notice how I said 'next' card or mechanic. I'm saying that Reckless Experimenter as it was could still have cards come out that become a problem. I hold the same opinion for most mass discounting cards.
---
Are they already glossy enough as is for dry erase?
---
Exactly what I meant.  Like after T6 or 5 minutes into the game should be enough?!
---
I have no idea what this is post is about, but at least it's horizontal.
---
No it didn’t, the combo was to make them cost 0 with Generous Mummy and Treachery.
---
Good idea tbh...
---
I had not seen the Priest legendary yet, so I took the bait, hook, line, and sinker.
---
No worries, I’m glad I saw this. I was upset I couldn’t get my event started this morning!
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
which ones?
---
No, just a mild gloss. I wouldn’t let any markers near them!
---
'tis human nature to be excited about new things. In spite of this, I've gone from hyped to unhyped already this time around.
---
Literally until tomorrow we had the worst meta in the history of hearthstone for two months because they didn't want to make changes before the new expansion. How the fuck can people forget these things so quickly?
---
No, minion =&gt; card, but card =\&gt; minion
---
They couldnt because updating the game is a long process and they admitted that they were in the wrong by not acting on it earlier.
---
Adventures also are better containers for value when it comes to the enfranchised player. That gold spent on adventure wings will be gold better spent relative to gold spent on packs.
---
I still personally do not like the adventure model of expansion releases. However, if the adventure cards are craftable along with being given with the purchase of the adventure, most of the problems with the model will be resolved.
---
But how will people know I have Twitch Prime now? :(
---
No 4 mana 8/8 set mana crystals to 10? Disappointed

Same. Wasn't until I saw the Warlock Legendary that I knew.

If you bought Amazon Prime just so you can have a jpg in Hearthstone then you're an idiot
---
You ain't never had a friend like him.
---
I mean if you're good at arena you become an infinite player and make gold in arena...
---
Funny thing is I usually try to, but often the armor just obscures so much of the pose and figure.
---
Yeah that makes sense.
---
Wow!  Well done!  I love seeing stuff like this, both the 100% completion and all the stats tracked.
---
So was Brann the most powerful overall?
---
no all people are girls because of the x chromosome
---
&gt; Thanks for explaining all the ways zilliax is different, like I didn’t know. I was just saying zilliax is a neutral card in a bunch of decks.
---
So are Novice Engineer, Bloodmage Thalnos, Leeroy, and plenty from expansions themselves. I personally see no problem with a card being popular, especially if it's an expansion card. You also admitted you're inflating how much he was played, I didn't see him too often especially when Mossy was in almost every deck thanks to Plague and aggro being popular. All of this is moving away from the original point. If QR had never been a thing, Giggles would never have been nerfed. I put my alternate universe time travelling credibility on the line with that statement. It would have been popular but very techable so not a problem. The defining reason for its nerf was because of QR.
---
Weird one. Did you copy a deck code that has a hero skin you currently don't have unlocked? Can you link me the deck code?
---
People are bad dancers. That's all I'm seeing here.
---
Big Ol Whelpo
---
You must be new to the game then (get a ton of freebies as the start) or grind the hell out of it. I played Shadowverse daily for a year and was able to have multiple meta decks until they introduced mini expansions and pushed more legendaries.
---
Once the mini expansions made it clear that keeping up was going to turn into a chore, I quit.
---
this is not an RTS, theres only so much a good player can do to seperate himself. the game IS about grinding, guys thinking they are something special at 7k mmr are delusional. "he picked amalgam on 3 and totally ignored grandma and minibot, he is a next level genius".
---
lmao blizzard is never gonna unnerf blade flurry it got the warsong commander treatment and it's staying dead
---
yup, its going to ruin the 4k experience
---
Damn man nothing else really to say other then this looks amazing. We can all see the effort you put in and good job.
---

As if he's going to click that and read shit himself. He knew he had to patch the game literally today, chose to ignore the patch notes, didn't take a to look at the subreddit for a second which also would've done it and submitted his lazy question so somebody else can do research for him
---
Nef disagrees.
---
Don't tell the others, but I'm rootin' for *you.*
---
Try putting in a ticket with Blizzard. It would be good to do it now before the new expansion releases.
---
What are you even talking about. Yes patch notes happen every expansion... it’s not like they would give patch notes out before the patch is presented. The Silence is proven again and again to be the best coarse of action. And when the silence leads to a patch like this. Then what’s the damn problem honestly? We don’t need Developers acting like news tickers telling us what they are working on because for all the “good will” it would do to get an insider look at up coming things all it would take is for one broken promise and shit hits the fan. Internet people suck and let me tell you as someone who has to create things for public consumption/critique its 100% better to stay silent than defend every position or action you do.
---
Small Indie team. Likely.
---
This. A deck's hero overwrites your favorite hero if the favorite was set after the deck was created. Please try remaking your deck once favorite hero is selected, or, manually change the hero on the deck.
---
The cards Shadowverse adds are ONLY the two highest rarities. And they're added to the same packs you already purchased 2 months earlier, so then you have to either hold back the first time around, hoard the packs you get in between, or waste your gold on a diluted pool. You can craft but you need 3 copies of the card generally, so it's really expensive.
---
Adventures would let you target cards without having to worry about pulling ones from the previous expansion. What SV does is super anti-consumer.
---
This year is already over bro.
---
Not sure how accurate this can be, especially comparing it to the HSReplay chart that just came out.
---
It's virtually impossible not to get top 2 with Rafaam. He hires good minions for 1 gold. My last run with him I literally got 3 Goldrins for a total of 3 gold and I wasn't even tier 5.
---
The only way you lose with him outside of just getting god awful rolls is against a battle hero power enemy like George or Nefarian.
---
Is it really just people picking him and then playing terribly? If you use his power every turn starting turn 2 (or 3 if you didn't get a Homunculus) I just don't see how you get less than 2nd or maybe at worst 3rd.
---
Mine crashes on my iPhone as well, usually only in the later stages of a game.
---
Only explanation.
---
“We don’t have the technology”
---
How long...
---
Originally Hagatha's Scheme was Doctor Boom's Scheme, but they decided Shaman needed it far more than Warrior.
---
How?
---
Didn’t even know someone could want this to happen.
---
Bandersmosh is fantastic
---
Yeah there are synonyms, but those lose out on synchronicity with the name "Silver Hand Recruit" unless you rename those too. And if you don't, then you have to fit the new tribe into the hero power text some other way. Neither option seems ideal.
---
make a fireside gathering for yourself.
---
Did you earn the 3 free packs that were given out during Tavern Brawls? 
---
Maybe they decided to give them away for free to those that didn't win them in TB.
---
then what was hagatha's scheme?
---
In the forum where... no.. It was a shitshow... Obviously ..
---
I mean, they have updated art for other cards, so I'd give it fifty-fifty.
---
Is it just me or is this the most buggy Hearthstone has ever been?
---
I didn't but I felt like it was pretty rare to see.
---
Thanks a lot Chriss, you rock!
---
Would be ok if you were Daryl.
---
If you have res https://i.imgur.com/V8DP55T.png
---
nithogg was also my first one!
---
It hits a lot of the same buttons of poker for me. A lot of RNG, but over a long enough time that evens out and skill becomes a factor. Because there is a much smaller set of minions and effects that skill is more to do with considering expected value on the fly than it is to do with an encyclopedic knowledge of cards and their interactions, something I would struggle to keep up with in regular HS (which is one of the reasons I no longer play it).
---
I'm not particularly good at it or anything, but I enjoy that kind of stuff.
---
And Daryl is much more difficult to play well
---
ive been trying to make good deck with her and bloodsworn mercenary for a while

I understood that reference!

80g on EU squirtalert#2407
---
No, it's a problem with changing the mmr system but not resetting ratings.
---
Had the old system been going the whole time these issues would not occur because mmrs would be closer together.
---
The math is such that more luck in a game just means mmrs end up closer together; it doesn't mean you need different parameters.
---
What this guy said x100!
---
Thanks so much for the kind words, much love friends &lt;3
---
Yeah the fact that it's targeted is definitely a huge boon, especially in the late game
---
Oh, so Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, thanks.
---
Bob has been cheating on ya'll. He specifically told me he is only rooting for me ;)
---
What’s that. Tournament guess gift? Nobody reminded me this time. Shit.
---
😂😂😂
---
This. I’ve had Rafaam twice and done pretty well both times, but there’s plenty of people happily putting Lightfang or Brann in 1st position against me which is not smart if you’re trying to win.
---
This may have something to do with why I tripled Lightfang without buying any of them from Bob.
---
Prepping for the afterlife is like preordering. You do all kinds of stuff as payment, but you don't know if it'll even be worth it till you get there.
---
Rat King is still super good IMO.
---
I think s/he was going for a precision vs accuracy joke but I dunno about the rest of you, but any callbacks to high school physics tend to be more “meh” inducing than “haha”.
---
I didn’t say that I knew the lore. Never played World of Warcraft but I did play the original Warcraft 3 when it first came out. I’m enjoying learning about these backstories through Hearthstone and the gracious people on Reddit.
---
Yes.  Please.  Would love to be able to play some death knights without having to worry about shit like we had with big priest and snip snap decks that take over wild for months to years before they finally get nerfed for the next bullshit.  Would give more incentive to buy wild packs and craft wild cards too.
---
is that what it is, I honestly don't know
---
U paythe shitout to catch up or u don't
---
hmm yeah, true, evolve and nzoth were pretty bleh:/
---
Tavern wise it's neutral. You pay 1g and can just sell later.  The potential for tripples is pretty high and getring thingss like brann and lightfang later in the game are decent if people arnt counter placing against you, not to mention amalgs (you can even get curaators amalg) meaning you can focus on buff minions. Not to mention early game teir up quicker or building a wide board quickly
---
Nah they didn’t when cthun was released and they were doing well that year
---
I think you get those on the 10th when logging in
---
100% probability. This is because everyone will get 2 copies upon release.
---
100%
---
Shield of Galakrond is being given away at the same time as the Galakrond Hero cards.
---
&gt; At very high MMR, you’re more likely to matchmake with other players that have an average rating above or below you.
---
Sorry what? Am I reading this right? That sentence makes NO sense.
---
You mean as a high mmr player you're more likely to be matched with people with a lot less mmr? Then why is there the word 'above'?
---
Sure, but it didn't take me 5 years to fix it. There is a reason why i'm so good at my job, it's because I think speak my mind about issues and make sure my code is futureproof. Good practice, yknow.
---
How are you able to do it? Also the 10th is when you get Shield and the 5 galakronds.
---
That's a big buff to Shirvalla
---
OMG I can finally counter SN1P-SN4P with Even Shaman!
---
Oh nevermind, it's already dead.
---
You people are no fun :)
---
And yet I’m still obsessed with keeping my first place ‘at least’ a fourth of my top 4 placements...
---
I made a card that stole weapons and was hit with -6
---
What I’m saying is they could, and someone definitely wanted to. Sometimes the voices of reason within the company do win. But only because the reasons for something pro-consumer satiate the greed of the higher ups for one reason or another.
---
Yeah, although I don't think the devs have any control over prices/freebies. It's probably all on the marketing team. I think the game has taken a hit recently in the player count which may explain the increased generosity.
---
pointless moves? the time it took you to write this comment you could have looked up the information yourself.
---
Ah, my apologies, I just realized that you were replying to a comment that got deleted.
---
Her left hand hehe...
---
Yes she though it look bad with ice in the left one
---
This is a buff for devolve in wild, now u cant get rekt if you devolve a 1 cost minion in to target dummy and the opponent magnetize a lot of minions on him
---
Yes, I understand why people are angry or sad. That doesn't mean it isn't childish though.
---
Battlegrounds are to Hearthstone what wannabe Hong Kong is to real China?
---
You would be too when you’re previous jobs were serving villains while they ransacked your home and then being in a desert attacked by plagues...
---
... only for your new job to be serving 8 of the meanest villains to exist in Hearthstone lore (and Daryl).
---
You can host a fireside gathering and open the packs. You can't buy new DoD packs or use dust to create new DoD cards though. Also DoD cards can be used in the fireside gathering only (till 10th).

Rolling for minions and heroes is a slightly less potent gambling fix than opening packs.
---
Sure, future proofing is great and speaking your mind is definitely a good way to get ideas verified or challenged to the point of developing a solution plan. None of that is being questioned here. However you gotta understand that not everything can be done perfectly when you have timelines, technical debt is always something companies struggle to pay it out. Just because a developer is forced to code badly due to deadlines or poor management or design requirements doesn't necessarily mean the developers themselves are the problem.
---
Did this ever happen?
---
Wait this is actually something that blizzard needs to see
---
&gt; A Legendary costs 3500 dust to craft and refunds 1000 for a disenchant. A Gold (Epic) costs 800 to craft and refunds 250.
---
So slightly better than HS but with a ~50% increase in pack size that's quite a lot better.  
---
&gt;You definitely need to pay if you plan to have multiple meta decks each expansion. If you’re lucky you can manage 2 meta decks an expansion as a F2P, but you’d have to put the effort and time in for that. 
---
Fairly similar to HS also.  
---
&gt;I would argue that is significantly more value than random packs because even though you don’t have the high roll potential with back to back Legendary packs, you have guaranteed values of dust you can get for crafting the cards you need if you don’t want some of those specific cards.  
---
You really' cant make that comment until we know the value of the cards.  We know a pack is roughly 100 dust on average (iirc) so we would just need compare the 2 dust values.
---
I am very convinced that this was done on purpose, knowing that the added cards would make the current standard toxic and unplayable so when Battlegrounds were released everyone would RUN to it. 
---
And it seemed to work pretty well. Notice that at this same time the wild meta was JUST AS toxic with Sn1p lock, a deck which for some time we knew was a problem.
---
Someone doesn't comprehend what a beta is .
---
The hell 3 different people trying to talk to me? Who the fuck are you?
---
No it wasn't even that, it was an interview were blizzard was asked why their games were split into multiple region (eu / na / Oceania ...) and he day he would love everyone in the world to play together with no lag but the technology isn't there yet to do that. Then during a big sc2 tournament one player had a big problem because of lag, and the commentator (I think it was day9) jokingly said the technology isn't there yet for a proper LAN and the meme took of.
---
What is this meme called anyway?
---
Legend, 5-mana, Platinum
---
LOL
---
Because you have hard stats on the amount of people playing BG right? Lol.
---
These are the login rewards for Descent of Dragons launch &lt;3
---
Bramm is pretty great to double your chances to roll divine shield with the megasaur though.
---
Got 2 golden legendaries, Malygos and Alex. Seeing as my fav deck is Highlander Hunter I’m pretty happy!
---
There’s a Rafaam strategy? I felt like I was using him mostly for token generation (and a lucky snipe for the soul juggler triple)
---
You can open them if you join a fireside gathering
---
Oh snap! How does one do that?
---
Platebreaker
---
Mess wondering why I got those
---
Depends how it is balanced, really. When does it heal, how much does it cost, and for how much?
---
My biggest issue is that they didn't keep their promise on the duration.
---
It was announced as only lasting until the end of october 30th... but they somehow forgot that and just let it fester. Don't announce such an event for a certain time and then overdue it by over a freaking month with no explanation or announcement of its extention.
---
I'm curious actually, does Blizzard have special demands for how you deliver your artwork to them when it comes to golden animations? Do you have to deliberately make several layers and give them an editable file, or do you just give them the finished artwork and they work out how to animate it themselves?
---
A statement can be true but still be rude and condescending. Those are not mutually exclusive.
---
Are the Rafaam players hitting themselves in the head with a hammer while playing him?
---
Its dangerous to go alone, taaaake thiiis
---
If it evolves can it rush again?
---
Yeah same here. Just another missed opportunity. Would be fun to try something new with the old meta.
---
I thought the special brawls were till the 30th and they said the event was going to last till DoD dropped. Maybe I am wrong but that's the impression I was always under, and they cut it short by 5 days if anything
---
*Sheogorath is gone. Maybe I kidnapped him. That would merit a death sentence!*
---
I Will check that, thank you
---
Ok i was scared to death.
---
Like an active power you can use during the auto battle?
---
Minions don't take damage in tavern phase right
---
Shaman was only a strong class, not an oppressive class, before evolve was introduced. Mogu is fine.
---
Your comment made me laugh more than it should
---
Unfortunately, your submission was removed because it is a pack opening.

All pack opening submissions should be added to the [Pullsday Thursday pack opening threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=Pullsday+Thursday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).  
---
They are stickied to the the subreddit every Thursday and allow you to show off your crazy or unlucky pack openings.

by the way, did they say something about golden galakronds?
---
14 out of 167 packs 1 golden legendary on the 10th I'll be getting 2 golden legendaries for pre orderings so 16 total not including the 5 free ones they give you I'll still need to craft some for highlander mage
---
There's only about 35 murlocs total.
---
Opened 5 legends from my 107 packs - but one of them were golden so I’ll take it
---
Just search up Mogu Cultist Warlock and there's bound to be a lot
---
I don't have the right cards so I don't have the list on me.
---
&gt; They should have brought back cards that didn't see play in the past that might have had the chance to shine now.
---
And then people bitch that the meta is stagnant and nothing changed over the course of four months. Bringing back strong cards to shake up the meta is better than bringing up weak cards that do nothing.
---
Just for a little clarity on your stance - are you just trying to explain the actions of the Chinese government?
---
I think you can set an unlisted fireside at your place or use a fake gps to an existing one
---
the joke is Kibler is "the father of dragons"

you're never happy with any meta so your opinion should be disregarded

You can’t buy packs with gold before the expansion is released, and you obviously can’t preorder after release.

2/1/4 | Taunt Battlecry: If your opponent has 2 or more minions, gain +1 Attack.  
---
Well then TIL. Makes the event even more lame.
---
Yep! If you evolve minion, It's like the previous minion was destroyed without triggering it's effects/buffs and instead the game will "summon" a NEW copy of a random minion from that evolve pool (whatever mana It is). Example: If you attack with **Shirvalah** (you'll heal 7 HP), then if you Evolve or Devolve (somehow) him, It'll summon a new and fresh copy, so you can attack once more and heal another 7 HP.
---
I thought Deathwing was being added?
---
Wow. 168 packs here and only 8 legendaries. I am super sad...
---
It's more that they did almost nothing to improve the game until finally, *finally* after two years of declining revenue, they decided to grant some small requests that the community has made, in exchange for taking away the free solo content and raising the cost of the game again.
---
Praising team5 for giving out Tyrande makes no sense to me.  They said they'd give out Tyrande so many times before, and honestly I don't think they planned to do this year until a short time ago (even though they said they would), because it's a lame promotion that doesn't have much to do with Tyrande or twitch or anything.  You click a button in-game and get Tyrande.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining that they're doing it, but given that team5 has repeatedly failed to honor promises about making Tyrande available again, it doesn't seem like something praiseworthy either.

God forbid they up the power level of a card game over time

The account is also only a week old.

No I am me.

We both have old accounts with post histories on different subs why would anyone think we are the same person?
---
I put a \\ through the second =&gt; but I didn’t escape it so it didn’t show.

Minion implies card, but card does not imply minion

Someone could still take curator for the free amalgam to start buffing immediately.
---
Also, if you have a Floating Watcher on the board at the end of the combat phase, you won the combat and won't take any damage.
---
Community response is amazing. Love it that you're doing this for the players.

Bob is a hoe

I like where you're going with this. Keep up depression.
---
I pulled two golden ones, pretty content with that lol.
---
It seems extra bad with Sylvanas's hero power, too.

My ideal solution would be to show the simplified ‘how many of each buff’ list on the current UI, and add a sort of ‘advanced view’ feature that would show all buffs in order, perhaps with a new popup window with a scroll bar so it can elegantly display lots of buffs. But of course, Blizzard adding complexity to the ingame UI is probably a pipe dream.

Is that an argument for or against it being a bot?
---
what's the name of that card which destroy the opponent's armour?
---
At high MMR it's even worse, 1st place is +30 and last place is -300.

Aight, mb

Finley is far from OP which makes your perfect game even more impressive!

Okay, good.  Because I was starting to get really confused.

It's Ellon Dust, the legendary billionair player who managed to craft an entire deck in saviors of uldum

They nerfed echo so that the echoes can’t be cheaper than 1 mana.

14 is insane. Including the free 1 in 10 you get to begin with, that's 1 out of every 12 packs. Didn't even get close to the 1/40 pity timer.

I dunno man, she even got the snaggletooth. That's advanced weebing

Someone on the Subreddit linked to a dev stating it was a bug. They're working on a fix.

It's kinda like you prepped for years and years, finally got to the location and

I agree with you. I think lich is really strong but if you don't play her properly then you just kill yourself quicker.

ALL GENDERS.

Turning a flag on or off on a card should be easy to hotfix in theory, but you are probably right and they don't consider it worth the extra effort to push out a fix for one single card that will be fixed in 4 days anyway.
---
Come to think of it though, the issue is probably that the flag is set for the expansion as a whole, rather than on a per-card basis. That would be a bigger thing to fix and even less worth the effort.
---
Same thing has happened to me. I just mulliganed the quest and moved on. I assumed its because the event is over?
