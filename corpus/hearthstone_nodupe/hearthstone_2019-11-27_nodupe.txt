Kings of Wild are Secret Mage and Snip-Lock. Big Priest has taken a large dive, and is around tier 4.
---
Thx for the feedbask, Noz is in the deck as it is a cool new dragon that fits nicely into the deck but i'd be happy to remove him. Presuming they fix evolve shaman before the Descent the meta should move slightly slower. Also so many descent of dragons cards aim for a slower game plan which is where this deck should shine.
---
I didn't get a chance to use my free ticket to play the Brawliseum before you disabled it. How come I get no compensation?
---
Ok, but based on a quick Google search on "plot hole" definition, I don't think OP is using that phrase correctly O.o
---
No problem, from what I've seen on here the 3 goldens don't combine.

New?
---
Lol they were so hopeful
---
Really? Last I checked warlock didn't get a new weapon. I'm confused. This is very clearly not real. Methinks you should delete this because posting created cards during reveal season is a very bad move. It's basically taboo.
---
I play Barnes
---
The EVIL classes get 3 legendaries, the League of Explorer classes get 2 legendaries. Confirmed by the devs.
---
Nothing to compensate, hunter have had an extra legendary since TGT, the Devs just wanted all classes to have 2 non-Galakrond based legendaries since Galakrond is free.
---
The last time this was used was with c'th and it did target rez pool
---
Jesus Christ....
---
Blizzard making that preorder look appealing tn ngl
---
King of the Goons.
---
I never said the complete card is real, i just said "it" is real. As the new released card has a unusual effect, which this card also has, im obviously refering to the effect.
---
[Fatecleaver](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Fatecleaver) anyone? I guess no one plays Arena...
---
You made a ‚Äústart of game effect‚Äù which is completely and unbelievably different to putting this effect on a high cost minion
---
Wait why the fuck is this a rogue exclusive? This is the card everybody needs to counter shuffle decks... of which ROGUE is a huge culprit.
---
Guess what? I got 300 gold.  Thats why I always start a brawl even if I never get a chance to play / finish it.
---
it didn't, since someone just killed warlock

I got the 300G lol.
---
Alley cat doesn't even have tooth jewelry. Ugh.
---
Current ranking system is broken, try not to obsess over that number. I sure hope it's just a placeholder for something better.
---
&gt;  the meta should move slightly slower
---
Not really. I intend to limit my crafts in the first week and start immediately with Galakrond miracle rogue and Galakrond Zoo Warlock. On top of that, Mage and Hunter will go fast as well. 
---
Your deck is mid-rangey but lacks the tools to stand up vs aggro.
---
No. From the top of my head, it's supposed to be \~12.5% at T2 and \~9% at T3.
---
I know there are people who work hard on the animations, but a fast mode would be something I'd be interested in. Some card games like Slay the Spire have a fast mode.

Is it bad I'm not even convinced this is good in current HS?

Anyone else also receive a free DoD pack too?

Evenlock just got an interesting toy :D

Specific question that doesn't really matter
---
If this card targeted, say, bloodfen raptor, does that mean bloodfen raptor wouldn't be able to spawn from piloted shredder/a dead minion would summon?
---
I thought this was a customhearthstone post and was like: that's way too much. Holy cow

No, it's not the same. Maybe the HS codebase is unmaintainable, but it's very unlikely that the underlying cause is unstructured control flow, which is the actual meaning of "spaghetti code".
---
Cool, I didn't know. I just honestly never tried launching it with Battlegrounds, because i assumed that displaying your own comp isn't very useful :D I'll check it out.
---
I work a lot everyday and don't have much time to stay on top of things that go on globally I saw what Blizzard did only just in the past day or two and was so appalled cancelled my sub and was wondering if there's a small chance I could get money back given that it was only very recently that I purchased something that isn't out yet.
---
That, and the state of Standard and Arena is at it's worst.
---
Thanks!
---
Well, if you're playing rogue, you won't be offered the new Deathwing as it's a warrior card.
---
But now imagine it‚Äôs Nozdormu and completely ruins their turn while they‚Äôre chilling at their lunch break.
---
This guy gets it! A green splat on attack of a poison minion and a purple "life link" channel connecting characters damaged via a life steal effect to the hero during attack would be way clearer and wouldn't require any extra animation time.
---
Same issues with things like "on damage" effects. The old frothing berserker spasms are just confusing. A bunch of minions all get damaged from an AoE, their health drops (sometimes to zero) and then everything hangs for no apparent reason while a little lightning icon pulsates ten times before everything starts moving again and minions finally actually die. Surely some red glowy lines that appear *during* the damage phase would be 100x clearer.
---
Direct counter to Sathrovarr?
---
I think what it means is once you choose the dragon it doesn't display it to your opponent, thus a secret to them
---
He is wondering why it explicitly states that the discovering process is secret, when it usually is. I think.
---
Hand Swolo
---
Are you kidding? At 3 mana this would be beyond broken, not a gimmicky tech card.
---
\[Sprint\] is like a joke.
---
Thank you father
---
actually its the opposite, buying this early is like buying wrath weaver which guarantees you lose your first few fights and it shoehorns you into buying deathrattles early
---
Actually IIRC Fatespinner transforms on play, so the jury is out
---
That's just on the youtube side of things, probably much much bigger on Billibilli and Youku and all.
---
Does this destroy copies from your own deck as well?
---
It's equal to your current amount of cards in hand, not your physical hand. Example: IF you have 4 cards in hand and play this then you will summon a 3/3 demon. It's a very slow card. The text can be confusing but it's the same as \[\[Astromancer\]\]
---
What the hell
---
New players may misunderstand how it works
---
Besides, what‚Äôs the harm in making everything consistent? Is t that just part and parcel of improving and polishing the game?
---
1 Mana 1/1: 
---
Draw a card. 
---
Discard it.
---
I've never played any others or don't really know what you mean by "Level 3," but getting 3 of a kind automatically transforms the 3 into a Golden minion, so far there's nothing beyond a Golden minion
---
Seriously don‚Äôt know what their plan is for next year. When you power creep that hard there is no way to stop it until the set rotates out.
---
/r/HSbattlegrounds/ was made before /r/BobsTavern and /r/BattlegroundsHS (/r/Battlegrounds was for other purpose) 
---
The owners of /r/HSbattlegrounds never did anything to promote the sub. chicachib made /r/BobsTavern and a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ds18is/havent_seen_a_battlegrounds_subreddit_so_i_made/) about it and kept the sub active by posting relevant info there so it kinda became the main sub.
---
That was it actually! Was wondering if 3 goldens of the same transformed even more

"ones you reached 5500k players know what to buy from the pool, so good luck getting the good ones if you are not the first lucky one to find them. "
---
I'm not sure I fully understand this. There are 24 heroes, and everyone is assigned 3 before the match starts. If you didn't preorder, you only get to choose from 2. Sure, some heroes are better than other, but it's not like you're trying to pick against others in some sort of draft style.
---
I'm just under 6000k MMR, with only 2 hero choices a game. I'd say at least 60% of my games are top 4, and that's really all you need to rank up.
---
Some of the meta is shifting into hyper-aggro mid game, with people trying to push a win before late game strats get online.
---
Personally, I feel like the OP cards they put into this set is just to get back players after the HK controversy. Why else would Blizzard give out 6 free legendaries (and good ones at that)?
---
the timer is a fixed amount of time which is shared between your battle time and recruit time.
---
hence, if your battle consisted of deathrattle creating tons of tokens, your recruit time will have much less time. if you paired with non token opponent and you have minimal token producing creatures, you'll have a faster battle and therefore a much longer recruit time.
---
it's a dilemma, which i think hs should fix by fastening the animation, especially the token deathrattle, they takes a damn long time to animate.
---
But...why?
---
I can't believe how wrong you guys are interpreting this card. It does not delete all the cards, only minions. Spells will still be there geez stop criticizing :p
---
Maybe. But the thing is it was a choice one had to consciously make. it's the same with regular secrets in hearthstone, a lot of the time it's blatantly obvious what the secret is, but very rarely you can lead your opponent in the wrong direction or something that is unexpected, or they may simply make an obvious mistake.
---
For chromatic egg though, the "secret" isn't really as impacting. They are given 3 random choices and they have to pick one. Even if they planned a certain outcome it's not guaranteed that they will even reach it. The fact that they have to adapt to the random nature of chromatic egg throws away more information that your opponent would want you to catch onto.
---
Why shudderwock?
---
Ah, wondered what that was for
---
Best case is 3/2, since isn‚Äôt fairy dragon a dragon?
---
Its early game so it's fine, and 1 triple and its reward should keep you going till you can tier up to t4. Depends on the situation though.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a few seasons so maybe everything‚Äôs changed but I feel like this could just be a 7 4/4 draw 4 and it‚Äôd see a lot of play.
---
Have you forgotten last week's Brawl?
---
What are time zones?
---
This card is pretty cool! I‚Äôd imagine it will see a lot of expirimentation in greedy decks, but I don‚Äôt know that this effect is good enough for value decks these days. Loving the set so far
---
it is in beta plus these auto chess stuff dies down fast. Underlord died pretty fast
---
you overestimated how often people read card texts
---
Bombardment !
---
Zola's back and has a new fetish.
---
This is super strong with the Priest dragon thstcrefuces card cost. Play the Priest dragon, play this gor 1. It could allow huge cost reduction for combo cards, if you can find a game winning combo.
---
Was it always like this? Or am I just crazy?
---
Yes, the Deathrattle is hidden from your opponent but it is shown to you.
---
You want them to put a paywall into battlegrounds when they are trying to get people to beta test it for them? The answer is simple: "Its not finished"
---
First you let the kids sample it if they get hooked then you charge them
---
&gt;the minimum support to not be completely broken
---
not to be a downer, but at this point even this is more than i expect.
---
lol you can literally calculated when you get legendary you do know that right?
---
Woo nice observation. Meaning a priest can get 4 or more ticks off
---
Eh, I'll stick with what works for me.
---
I luckily watched reveal article when they briefly opened it for some reason(checking maybe).
---
It will be re-revealed around 30 mins later.
---
*"These 19 little cuties must be purged!"*
---
*"How can you even consider that? There's got to be some other way."*

Just add a few explosions and some finger guns and you are probably not far off.
---
Big brain comment.
---
Yer a wizard, ~~Harry~~ pushkin2584.
---
The point doesn't really stand at all though, since a single Shudderwock can be incredible in its own right, and hasn't been a win condition unto itself since the Saronite Chain Gang nerf.
---
It's a powerful addition to Battlecry Shaman and will continue to be so, copied or not.
---
Basically the egg summons a **Bolderfist Oger**.
---
Laughes in Nozdormu.
---
I think it's more poetic than "Anti-Christ". That's all. :P
---
Been happening a lot to me on pc, but not mobile.
---
Secretly discover?
---
What is wrong with the timer?
---
Me when I play this card and it hatches: Brightwing. *maybe* faerie dragon if I'm lucky.
---
Opponent when they play this card and it hatches: Deathwing (both variants), Kalecgos, Waxadred, vanilla Ysera...
---
Ahh, dont put this card into your deck maybe lol
---
Seriously, this card at first glance is an anti aggro card. But aggro gameplan is to constantly face dmg you every turn from turn 1-2 to kill you turn 5-7. Assume you play this on curve turn 2. If the aggro player cant damage you on turn 3, you just may win the game anyway. If you play this card latter than turn 2, it is even more useless because if the aggro deck cant damage you on turn 4-5 they have no chance anyway.
---
Vs Control like I said, a early 3/6 not gonna do shiit
---
It's running out of time.
---
This is for voting in battlegrounds brawl... but i get 3 saviours of uldum packs...
---
I got 300 gold, and I had also never started my run. I had entered into the brawl screen before it was removed, though.
---
Oh so you think that only the people who entered the brawl get rewards? That's kind of unfair tho, I'd think that those who didn't even get a chance to enter would deserve it more than I did..
---
quest galakrond sound so much like a meme i love it
---
Fuck yeah.
---
I'm too excited
---
As opposed to Gorgonzola . . .
---
I feel cheesy now . . .
---
Wholesome art 10/10
---
Get out!
---
Heck yeah, after the 9 cards wicked skeleton combo, what's next  ?
---
&gt; This card after Galakrond or Akali is outright madness.
---
Right? The potential is certainly there, it's just a bit of a shame you absolutely have to play a Galakrond deck, otherwise Restless Mummy is straight up better (3/2 vs 6/4)
---
:)
---
 that's why then xD
---
There's going to be enough good dragons to satisfy that requirement
---
You know what, you're right
---
Yeah. I'm living in a foreign country and can't buy packs in USD, and I'm not just gonna start over from scratch because that would suck, so...
---
Next level RNG
---
 
---
ShadowStorm#214651 NA. 80 gold.
---
You get karma by contributing, not begging
---
Even though it‚Äôs cheaper, it still comes out slower than Restless Mummy.  If it won‚Äôt for the dragon tag, this would have just been a worse restless mummy but I think it will find a place somewhere.
---
This with [[Akali, the Rhino]] is dang tasty, wonder if it works with the shrine too with all copies getting protection?
---

I completely agree with you lmao, when i started reading this comment tree and people were whining about cleave and poisonous i thought, ‚Äòumm, have they not played against divine shield, wind fury, poisonous Murlocs before?‚Äô.  Apparently we are the only two lol.  I would much rather face cleave than that shitshow - and it happens quite frequently the higher up you rank so it‚Äôs not THAT rare to see.  Especially since the murloc buffs.
---
Asia's leaderboard caps at 149.
---
The video has nothing to do with time or connection, he just misplayed.
---
Well hello
---
Lighten up, buttercup.
---
May I suggest adding a clarification that this card does not trigger Battlecries upon hatching nor does it offer a full pool of available Dragons, only Neutral and class-specific?
---
I can already see a lot of combo plays for that card i can't wait to try
---
Just because
---
Jaraxxus being technically a minion and a hero only ever does things that hurt him. There‚Äôs no beneficial synergy even where it would make sense.
---
Probably not, since Galakronds are Hero cards,not minions with Dragon tag.
---
Also probably not, for the same reason. On one hand Jaraxxus is a minion with a battlecry, so Sac Pac makes *some* sense. On the other hand if they would work and affect the opponent's Galakrond negatively, either everybody would "tech" those cards in if Galakrond decks turn out to be good, or nobody would run Galakrond decks because they know in advance that people have teched against them. Blizzard wouldn't gamble on this. This set is way too overpowered, they wouldn't risk their new shiny cards not being played.
---
Hitch the movie
---
FOR ONLY FOUR MANA?
---
This spoils my habit as a thief rogue of using Augmented Elekk to shuffle 30 or so copies of Zilliax into my deck :(
---
So clearly you shouldn't be using HSreplay for this.
---
Wait, what happens when you kill a flik with a flik
---
Won‚Äôt the last flik played not disappear? Battlecries trigger before the minion resolves on board so unless it‚Äôs still considered ‚Äúin hand‚Äù when the battlecry happens, all but the last flik should be removed
---
OBLIVION
---
When you give yourself award, do you lose money? Sorry if it's dumb I have no idea how reddit awards work.
---
Also if Galakrond buffs this, you get a 3 mana board fill of 7-6's
---
Isn't that a warrior spell tho ?
---
Wonderfully empty*
---
And in true demon fashion, I remained at 5 health for about 5 or 6 rounds after getting Mal'Ganis.
---
Why bracket Nefarian?
---
Except mobile was [apparently](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e21ovq/new_card_valdris_felgorge/f8t2ell/) one of the reasons they scaled it back from 15 to 12.
---
What happens to your opponent if you Invoke twice, play Akali and it draws you this? 
---
Will your opponent get banished to the Shadow realm or get imprisoned in the salt mines till the end of times?
---
it says *wherever*, the inter-dimensional space a minion goes through when going from hand to deck is still *somewhere,* it's simple quantum mechanics
---
I'd completely forgotten about the leaderboards. Nice shout.
---
True, but that could be a positive thing - allowing more targets for necrium blade/vial in your deck while not lowering the chances that the new Necrium Apothecary will land on your most powerful junk. We'll dutifully experiment with it before inevitably cutting for better cards.
---
maybe a name and art change?
---
Rogue's second best right now. As others have said, you're going to want Edwin, but feel free to try the deck without him in the meantime.
---
why do you care?
---
Does China have a larger proportion of Wild players in their region, or just more players in their region in general?
---
Oh man, is this real ?
---
Made my day
---
I noticed it, but are they implying that we hold our cards by balancing one on each finger? Is that why the hand limit is ten???
---
In wild there are 2 Deathwings.
---
With early and late game dragons available, this card is almost always good, probably broken.
---
Yes - https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/1191062771355414528
---
Correct. So if you draw this card with Galakrond's battlecry and give it +4/+4, you'd summon three 7/6's with rush for 3 mana.
---
Nah that's just yer mum
---
Battlegrounds needs to be deleted) full random mode) we have already arena,standart e.t.c
---
Hey what if i don't care about BG and love meme decks ?
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
It's not a bug when // is in front of it.
---
Your opponent isn't going to trigger it without taunt so it's more like a surprise than a mind game.
---
Rafaam, no idea how he‚Äôd work tho but he‚Äôs definitely one of my favorite hs characters and I wanna see him put into bg
---
Wholesome artwork
---
Then you're in the wrong sub regardless.
---
That's what I thought!  Like old rafaam.  
---
6 star minion. Can give a minion +10/+10 or something
---
yeah but i didnt even get the packs
---
First Epic Egg!
---
Not helpful
---
Nefarian was also specifically strong at taking first place which is logical. He's not super strong, but if he manages to push to late game, popping all divine shields is an overwhelming advantage assuming you can get into late game where that becomes critically important.
---
With 3 coins?
---
oh ty, i will check it out
---
Nice.
---
Probably rarely sees use. Most of the time your done before going into fatigue
---
its a bug, it shows you dont get anything
---
What's your problem? Sub not catering to your every need?
---
I guess it‚Äôs possible? :&gt;
---
Coincidentally [Bouncing Flask](https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Bouncing_Flask) also has one of the longest animations
---
But its fun?
---
Nah, it's just that you're too pushy
---
Dane plays fun decks, not meta decks.
---
Excellent, I think we‚Äôve got a perfectly balanced card! Now we just need to wait for a set featuring the Old Gods and their whispers.
---
I would think not
---
I‚Äôve had the the bonuses since the first day of closed beta and it is super OP as you‚Äôre virtually guaranteed to get at least 1 good to great hero option every game.  I‚Äôm actually very interested to dive into the stats bonus once it opens up in December.  Particularly if it breaks down specific usage of cards since I want to see just how much my winrate has improved after avoiding tripling up my amalgams and making crowd favorite a priority.  I know it‚Äôs gone up dramatically since I was constantly finishing second and now have won nearly 20 games in the past few days (I only play for a couple hours a day or so) but hard figures would be nice
---
if it would be dragon, there would be probably some games where you hear just whateverthisguysayswhenheissummoned and whateverthisguysayswhenheattacks and whateverthisguysayswhenhedies
---
Unless you get a 4th 2/1 on turn 2. Then don't sell the 1/1 as having 3 1/1s count as a golden
---
Hearths...done
---
Do you see a token and don‚Äôt have a token? Freeze
---
Do you see a token-pair from your turn one AND another strong unit? Freeze
---
Do you see a triple?
---
Freeze
---
Are you Sindragosa? Probably freeze
---
The beauty of this game is just how complicated things can get on the simplest of turns, and the turn 2 freeze or not freeze is a great example of this complexity. In other words, it‚Äôs probably up for debate, and definitely depends on the situation. 
---
Despite this general guide, you can probably justify doing either option in almost any scenario if you know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
You can invite one for the moment. They stated they are adding an option when you can invite more than one.
---
It gave me the 300 gold notification but didn‚Äôt actually give me any gold
---
Nah. It's cool to have separate subs for separate specific aspects of the game- like wild or battlegrounds so you can have more in depth discussions there regarding those; but, this is the sub for Hearthstone which encompasses the whole game, including Wild, Arena, Standard, Tavern Brawls, and, yes, even Battlegrounds. So it makes no sense for this sub, the Hearthstone sub, to start cutting out parts of the game to cover.
---
is there an actual date for when or just when the new expansion hits
---
It takes time (around 2 weeks after the event). It's normal
---
They don't have to mess things up if they just brought back in more innocuous but interesting cards that could just be fun to play around with in Standard. Evolve was clearly a bad idea, but even the other strong options I feel dont come anywhere near as close as problematic as Evolve was, for a short time at least. Evolve is stupid busted with the Hare.
---
Priest is getting the weakest part of the set, I'm kind of worried. I guess I'll keep playing BGs..
---
I assume nothing, similar to Carnivorous Cube.  It just becomes a body with no deathrattle.
---
I think they backed themselves into a corner with the time thing. If they only did it for a week then people would complain that they crafted decks around the cards only to use those decks for a week.
---
I'd think *probably* not but for example your Jade Golems grow by 1/1 even if the golem itself doesn't get summoned, so some things do seem to just track whether particular cards have been played.
---
Fatespinner didnt really have "mind games", if anything it was terribly designed and barely played because either choice leads to the same consequence most of the time - remove other enemy minions by trading if possible before killing the spinner.

Neither have I. But I know people who did...
---
Swashburgler gives cards from your opponents class as well.
---
&gt;I like to meme but even I wouldn't play this. It's too risky for a chance of a high roll on a 0/3. 
---
Yeah, this will be a card for rank 15 and up (which I'm not hating on...that's where I spend almost all my time).  It is definitely risky.  I haven't looked at all the dragons that exist (so far) and added up the odds, but I assume that like a "get a random legendary" type of deal, there's a decent chance for some bad outcomes.
---
BG is the main game mode and Constructed should make an alternative sub. Maybe you can call it r/RNGSimulator or something.
---
I think we all know what three of the cards will be...
---
&gt;shudderwock can‚Äôt zola itself
---
Idk if that's a good example. No card can use its own battlecry on itself.
---
It's Zeddy. He likes to play ~~cancer~~ degenerate decks while complaining about other players who play those same decks.
---
Yeah, don't let it get to you bud. Games like these happen. Thankfully evolve is rotating out soon.
---
After you played it, it summons every card with tribal tag 'Beast' which died this turn.
---
I *know* they're going to monetise it even more than they are now. I'm telling OP not to work for Blizzard for free because Blizzard as a company does not respect its community anymore.
---
Thanks
---
How dare you? You took away out futur
---
Oh shut up with the melodrama.
---
People are allowed and should make constructive ideas. You're not doing anyone any favours whining about it.
---
I believe it would still destroy itself, wherever it is kind of means wherever. Like when a secret does damage when your hero is attacked, you get attacked to activate the secret but no damage is taken if the minion is destroyed that attacked you
---
I think I got my 3 packs late last night.

Thanks Hearthstone team for making things right!

If Blizzard hasn't *already* had these ideas (and more), then they need to hire new marketing people.

I just read through this entire thread and my impression is that you have little to no self awareness and that you should take some of these suggestions to heart. Just an opinion from a third party who had nothing to do with the conversation. Have a good day!
---
I do on average 7-9 wins as well. You get sometimes lucky. I almost didn't achieve this 12 win , I survived like 3 times with 1-5 hp and made a comeback. If I wouldn't topdeck better than the opponent I would have lost. But it may be as well that I played legend and the knowledge helps a bit more.
---
If you get consistently to 7 wins thats pretty well done. I'm very happy when I make it to 7 wins. Above is a bonus

---
I don‚Äôt see how that can be a viable deck... you‚Äôd be juggling between having enough dragon synergy, invoking galakrond, control, valuable mechs for dr.boom... i can‚Äôt even define how such a deck would be. Control? Aggro?
---
r/ArenaHS
---
Is there any explanation as to what a "good" rating is vs bad?  I know everybody starts at 4000 and it seems most of the "really good" players are between 5300 and 6000, but beyond that I have no clue what's decent and what's bad.
---
every time PepeHands . Can't stop arena til it's gone.
---
The end is coming!
---
Those take a bit to get going and can be beat down before they get their infinite value. I prefer to not lose turn 4 no matter what deck I play
---
Personally i see this more in a alexstraza, new deathwing, brightwing, dragons roar, war master voone type deck. But that‚Äôs a clear Dragon Warrior (imo) not some aggro/control hybrid

Hey Brutal170, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Yea I mostly do arenas, too. I think I also got just 1 Epic so far
---
Fuck man why does Ysers Unleashed have to have quite literally 0 synergy with highlander decks, highlander dragon druid sounds and seems like a blast to play
---
He‚Äôs the only one with any decks.  Everyone else plays battle grounds.
---
Aggro warrior performs okay in all matchups, but doesn‚Äôt excel at anything in particular. Which means there are no very bad matchups, but no very good ones either. It‚Äôs just a mediocre deck. Control warrior is the opposite with matchups either being a complete stomp or they steamroll you. Every time time you queue it‚Äôs like a coin flip to get an almost guaranteed win or an almost guaranteed loss.
---
And it‚Äôs heavily reliant on RNG...yay.
---
I might be wrong but don't it make more sense to sell back the pogo instead of triple them? This way there are more pogos on the pool?
---
Would this only trigger once per turn, or could something like Cyclone Mage spit out a couple 5/5s in one turn?
---
Yeah. We really needed to give decks that were already throwing Zephrys in for the late game a reliable way to produce threats in the late game, not just an answer.
---
Bah, more highlander shit. Can‚Äôt afford all them legendaries.
---
Alex is rallying the resistance against Galakrond. She's also leading the Explorers to battle. The Highlander effect on Alex and the favor of the card is great. And yeah, "add two cards to your hand" is kind of boring, but **they cost 0**.
---
[This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e1o7ib/theory_alexstrasza_could_be_a_neutral_highlander/)
---
The point of keywords is that they become intuitive and easy to understand once you see them used once or twice.
---
Changing them in Battlegrounds doesn't really help much. Charge attacking first should make sense and should apply to Old Murk-Eye, but that is the single exception to what is otherwise a very intuitive system that they already have in place.
---
Beyond that, I just don't know why you're complicating things so much with weapons and spells and what-not. What is had now has plenty of room to be expanded upon and changed, there's no need for big sweeping additions like this.
---
Highlander rogue just got a lot cooler. Getting 2 zero cost cards synergizes so dang well with combo cards. Heck, your Edwin turn is looking extra good right about now.
---
This looks like it is going to be a really fun card.
---
Give dat man a medal!
---
With 2 highlander cards they tend to be good enough, with 3 it gets pretty crazy.
---
This is totally wack.
---
Sometimes I feel like there are only 3 Nightmares total, and sometimes just 2.
---
Then I see this mf has gotten 4 and I just die.
---
I don't think he said OP
---
I wonder whether there is going to be any non-highlander decks in the meta or not.
---
they removed the bonus appearance rate of class cards within your discover choices.
---
How is it dead if it's good?
---
You mean "Light's Wrath"?
---
A joke, but the two did have the same quests in WoW to obtain in legion.
---
dad plz
---
In Kobolds and Catacombs...!
---
This card will be an auto include for highlander decks, but the problem is that highlander decks are not super strong at the moment, and this card won't help them. 
---
Against control, this card won't be the tipping point to push highlander mage / paladin / hunter enough to outvalue priest / warrior, and against aggro this card is kinda dead. If this card were to absolutely slaughter control, than that would be a different matter, but as it stands it's just a big body that might bring more big bodies. 
---
The only other way I see this card being relevant is pushing dragon synergies in highlander decks, but well have to wait and see on those.
---
Just hit airplane mode when the timer is at one second and you skip the fight entirely and get 120 seconds
---
I'll love to farm this girl in my higlander rogue deck
---
It just puts a bunch of stats into play at a point of the game where that's not that powerful unless you've already been generating earlier in the game (which a highlander deck won't). This will not see play, just as much as Krul didn't see play.
---
You missed the chance to record what actually happened, but you went and posted it anyway. Cool
---
Of course this is the card she gets. XD
---
EDIT: And as many people guessed, it‚Äôs a neutral highlander card!
---
Looks like Reno's back on the menu boys!

Not sure who you're referring, though [I gave it a shot](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/e1o7ib/theory_alexstrasza_could_be_a_neutral_highlander/) a day ago as well, even though I couldn't nail the effect. Still, wish it could've been a bit more interesting but at least now we have a lot more dragons and interesting dragons.

Nice work yo!!!

Terrible card by design. These are the cards I hate the most in this game. This card can give you a 0 mana [[Faery Drake]] or a 0 mana [[Alexstrasza]] / [[Malygos]] or even a copy of itself and two other 0 mana dragons.
---
This just feels so bad to play against, not actually evolve shaman level, but it's the same direction, super high/low roll RNG cards.

9/4/12 Dragon | Spell Damage +5  
---
Explorers? Any class can be highlander, the best Highlander class was even Warrior before N'Zoth / Evolve meta. This is just a neutral legendary.
---
Even without the highroll on average it's a really good addition to highlander decks
---
I used Hearthstone to destroy Hearthstone
---
Very powerful. If every class gets an explorer dragon that discovers a dragon as well as a powerful dragon? Sounds you'll end up with something bonkers fairly frequently.
---
This is actually really big for cyclone mage. Now with flame walkers, there is this as well. I look forward to playing this in it. Secret mage match up will still be arse though...
---
I also got a triple triple which unfortunately doesn't triple
---
Thanks, buddy! Happy that I got some things right.

Dragon breeder ;)
---
#‚ÄùMY JAWS THAT BITE, MY CLAWS THAT GENERATE INFINITE VALUE.‚Äù
---
This card is much, much better then Nefarian. It's slow as in it comes in the late game, yes, but then it's as fast as you can get. The Dragons are free and can be played immediately for a tempo swing (if you get atleast decent Dragons), while Nefarian spells cost Mana so you wait an extra turn and get middling value in the end (most spells are not that good).
---
Look at the colour on the right.
---
The reason why I hated it was that I could use any of the cards with whizbang :/
---
Just 24 more cards until I can make a 30 highlander legendary deck
---
Jeez what a card!
---
Alright, dragons, I guess. Haven't played dragons in a while, let's go dragons. Dragons aren't that good, but alright.
---
The worst outcome of one of the most high variance cards in the game is not as good as a card that carries deck archetypes by itself (or just about by itself in Explorer classes)? Who would have thought?
---
I know, but it's probably most likely that you'll see it in the already established classes with class Highlander legendaries then in the other EVIL classes. Remember Zephrys, afterall, neutral but mostly seen in the 4 'good' classes since they just have even more support.
---
It's the graaaaand... tournameeeent!
---
Agree 100%.
---
I feel like card dev team is out of ideas.
---
True but, it's a 3-mana 2/5 minion so you're not giving up tempo like you are with dragon soul.
---
But it also doesn't last the rest of the game like dragon soul did. I don't have high hopes for this card making cyclone mage good.
---
I didnt realize the kobolds and catacombs priest weapon didnt make the cut into rose of shadows cyclone mage. Color me wrong.
---
Yeah sounds terrible... why is anyone confused as to why it‚Äôs a dying format?
---
Pretty sure there is a 1/1 Dragon Whelp for 0 mana in this expansion.
---
Hey at the absolute worst its 9 mana 14/12 in stats, if thats the worst thing i can expect, sign me up
---
So, they already revealed both Rogue legendaries, which means they aren‚Äôt giving the 3 classes that don‚Äôt have them highlander cards, but they are printing a new neutral. They really want Reno to be the only viable control deck in wild, don‚Äôt they?
---
Nothing illustrated this better than the recent battlegrounds balance patch actually making the game mode even more random by shifting the focus onto early game aggression. Sure it used to be "whoever gets lightfang wins" but that's still the case anyway, now there's the added layer of early game RNG where the people who got the snowball units get to gamble on getting a Lightfang and the people who didn't just get obliterated out of the game. 
---
So much needs to change about that game mode that I don't even know where to begin. Before the patch it felt like Blackjack; 90% luck but an element of increasing your odds. Now it feels like there's almost zero skill expression and there's almost no correlation at all between playing well and doing well.
---
Is it just me or does Alexatrasza's wing perfectly align the wing from the card's legendary border
---
Of course
---
There goes the question if Highlander decks are competitive, the answer: yes
---
Even if you only get 2 Faerie Dragons, it‚Äôs still not bad for 0 Mana and everything upwards can be strong or strong squared
---
Gotcha!
---
I mean the absolute worst low roll is what... 2x faerie dragons?
---
9 mana 8/8 + 2 3/2 untargettables is still a pretty solid card.
---
I mean even the worst out is pretty good
---
Oof
---
There are low rolls and high rolls, but on average at minimum it's a decent amount of stats. At best it's going to have a bunch of crazy effects.
---
My question is if this would see play in reno decks in wild, which typically already have a lot of value
---
Dr booms scheme... 2 stars!
---
Kazakus is definitely stronger
---
This card seems very RNG-dependant and we will probably get a lot of pack fillers dragons as neutral commons and rares, which would bring its value down
---
Imagine getting [[Veranus]] and [[Dragonmaw Scorcher]]. Or imagine getting [[Faery Drake]] and [[Nightmare Amalgam]].
---
Pretty fun stuff for competetive play. Not.
---
I come from a long line of Kings.  Our history has been passed down orally.  But I can assure you the death rate of jesters was between 72% and 97% in all of our kingdoms's history.
---
Yeah I'm a sad boi I just want them to all go back to constructed cause I really had battlegrounds, but it's a hit so gotta give them that.
---
I mean it's the current meta that's thrown all the streamers off. They're all sick of shaman simulator. Plus why wouldn't you stream a popular new game type?
---
a few of the cards ruined it for the rest of them; I love nzoth but can understand the frustration and without nzoth, evolve, and a few others I think it would have been fine
---
sylvanas and rag stick out to me as having been powercrept out of being too op for standard
---
Yeah, but since they're added to your hand rather that just being summoned, it means you'll be able to utilize their battlecries as well. Meaning you could clear the board with [[Crazed Netherwing]], a big threat with [[Crowd Roaster]], or just a couple of minions with [[Twin Tyrant]]. And since you'll now have *two* dragons in hand, you'll be able to activate a lot of the "If you're holding a Dragon" battlecries.
---
Yeah, it's not entirely consistent in terms of which battlecries you'll get, but it not *just* a big pile o' stats.
---
you mean dragonqueen into 2 dragonqueens

Shudderwock was just the final straw.  It was a pretty stable meta in the couple of years that I played, no clue if it's gotten better.
---
"And when the new expansion releases, battleground will be a "dead game" too." 
---
HAHAHAH haha.  Are you new to HS??  Within 2 weeks three of the top OP netdecks will be dominate and 95% of the cards in the expansion will be meaningless.  ESPECIALLY this expansion with the OP cards.   You really think people are going to stick around and grind that crap? 
---
My evidence is every single expansion in the last 5 years. whats your evidence to the contrary?
---
Idk, I don‚Äôt play as much as I did
---
In December Amalgam is getting nerfed from a 3/4 to a 2/2.  It will still be Tier 2.  
---
You can still expect to see plenty of Amalgams in the late-game, however the change in power will make it so that players are punished a little bit for taking them early due to having a bad statline, which makes it a bit harder to get to the late-game.  
---
Is that enough?  I have my doubts.  I still think it will be the best card in Tier 2, easily, but it will help a bit.  Right now, I think a bigger problem in the game is the ubiquity and ease of getting poison and divine shield in combination.
---
I don't get it üòë
---
Oh, I just checked your account. This was just a troll post.
---
Shouldnt have taken the bait. My bad.
---
Yes
---
That's the absolute low roll though. Has a 1/1225, or 0.08% chance of happening.
---
A lot of the time you're getting something much better, and more than occasionally you're getting a free massive minion, since the dragon tribe has a really top heavy distribution.
---
You are aware that playing a deck is not being a part of the problem. If you are a competitive player such as myself you are forced into playing the oppressive decks if you want to push for anything resembling good ranks. The responsibility of balancing and making sure no deck is too oppressive falls on the balance team and not on any given player. They are the ones failing atm and should be the ones criticized and not the player. The whole point of this post was to demonstrate how legend wild players we have late in the month because of the very deck I'm playing has forced so many out. Never hate the player for playing a Tier S broken deck, hate on the ones that continue it to allow for no good apparent reason.
---
So cool
---
And if your opponent can‚Äôt answer the one deathwing they die
---
Because it‚Äôs a great deal you should be honored that Blizzard has bestowed upon you the opportunity to purchase such a high powered cosmetic skin.
---
This will quickly be on the list of cards that need a Closer Look, aka nerf soon after release
---
Nice bait.
---
I'd prefer a design like, add two other legendary dragons to your hand.
---
That way it's always good, rather than whiffing sometimes, and sometimes being infinite.
---
You could even add "that you haven't played this game" to add a little more stability, while tying into the Highlander theme.
---
That's some strong competition to Galakrond decks; 
---
So far Galakrond looked like it could fit in a lot of decks, but (as it needs duplicate invoke cards) it won't work in Highlander.
---
That card is super RNG dependent, but super Highrolly as well; Lots of massive dragons out there.
---
I probably won't ever play this card (I try to have as little RNG as possible) but I already hate it for all the highrolls my opponents will get.
---
what do you think will happen DAY 1 with the new expansion??  has there EVER been a truly diverse meta.  just look that the cards announced, its going to be worst mana cheating then even big priest was with high rolls.   
---
HAs there ever, in the history of hs, been a period of more than 3 weeks(and that is the best example) where many new decks were all capable?   not just tech cards, talking entirely different decks.   nope  
---
People will be back to battlegrounds(a mode i think is horrible and boring rng btw) within ONE WEEK.  That is if they even come over to the expansion to begin with.
---
Yea, on high legend: [https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-type/highlander-warrior/](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/deck-type/highlander-warrior/)
---
It was the #1 deck on HSreplay for high-legend ranks after the Boom Nerf. Nobody talked about it, few meta reports but it was basically a sleeper deck for mainstream players.
---
Warlock and Rogue had also better HL decks than League Explorers classes (except for Hunter).
---
Yeah like your own shit
---
I like the hero power upgrade idea but the power level between these is vastly different. Life steal should never be added simply because it would make for infinite games. 
---
Some good ideas here but I think battlegrounds will focus on other aspects before resorting to hero power upgrades.
---
Doubt it, there is probably kangor shenanigans going on before this screenshot.
---
I was very confused until I realized it was [[Ysera Unleashed]] not the card in classic.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering that. So that‚Äôs how a tie is decided.

9/4/12 Dragon | Battlecry: Shuffle 7 Dream Portals into your deck. When drawn, summon a random Dragon.  
---
wow i see this as the only legendary i will open 
---
So lucky lol
---
If she hadn't got it I'd have been slightly mad
---
my point though is it is a "hit" because the alternative is ladder and people have just had enough of playing the top 3 decks over and over and over again and grinding.  people have been bored of that shit for at least 3 years.  same shit, over and over.  3-4 OP as hell netdecks and thats all you see on ladder mostly.
---
Confirmed which way, that it reminded them from the pool or that it doesn't?
---
I understand what you're saying. 
---
But I'm saying that high cost high stat minions almost never see play. 
---
Hearthstone is about cheating out minions OR high cost cards with crazy powerful effects. 
---
This card is obviously INSANE from a value perspective, but I don't think it'll see as much play as everyone is expecting
---
Honestly I liked the idea, a couple cards broke the game though. Obviously evolve was the worst offender but n‚Äôzoth with the reborn cards in standard was also pretty frustrating and while rag was fun at first he‚Äôs just too powerful a closer. Plus Flamewaker who didn‚Äôt bring mage back but made it very annoying and Kun who is just a touch too good in quest Druid.
---
Some cards i really grew to like though, Sylvanas felt like a really interesting swing card but not unmanageable to play against, and swashburgler was great for Rogue.
---
Isn't there a 1/1 dragon in standard that discounts a beast by 1?
---
I‚Äôve seen this film before.... r/howtotrainyourdragom
---
Yeah the HOF cards coming back messed shit up imo, I know others loved it. Next expac will be good though I think.
---
Can you evoke this on T1, coin a 1 mana spell and get the 5/5? Kind of like wishing for an Edwin on T2.
---
The only Explorer that hasn't really had a Highlander archetype is Druid, although they *have* used Elise and Zephyrs regardless. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a new Highlander Druid deck that uses the dragon package now though.
---
Wild is great right now *except* for Sn1plock
---
Yeah, but in late game you get often mor than 20 dmg and Nefarian is healing himself for max 7 life.  
---
When your enemy has full divine shield Nefarian get no healing.  
---
The upgraded hero power of Nefarian makes his Hero Power worth in each case, whether the enemy has divine shield or not.
---
Yea a troll post.  Is Twitch a "troll" too right now where every single streamers is playing battleground and ONLY battlegrounds. 
---
If you think these guys are going to come back to ladder and just grind against the same top three OP netdecks 1 week after launch you are mistaken.  They will all abandon it and go right back to battlegrounds.
---
Again, bet me money on it. CAN NOT WAIT to reference this post 2 weeks after expansion drops and every big streamer is playing battlegrounds.
---
3 mana 2/5 in itself isn't exactly bad though
---
&gt; on the second day of Open Beta
---
Alliestrasza who reveals an Alexstrasza card is really cool haha
---
Or it‚Äôs some tiny Dragon they‚Äôd rather hold for ‚ÄòDragon in hand‚Äô effects
---
Where does it say it‚Äôs getting nerfed? I‚Äôm surprised they would change anything but cost for cards in the actual standard game.
---
True! Adding them to your hand for 0 mana is preferable to summoning them in the vast majority of situations. The only situation when it's not is with negative battlecries, which dragons generally do not have (Deathwing notwithstanding).
---
Excessive rng is the reason I stopped playing mtg.
---
The artwork just looks like a baby dragon. I think it's supposed to be the same pterodon-like species as vicious fledeling a.k.a flappy bird.
---
Tripling up combines the cards into their golden version.

This comment deserves more recognition

Kronx is a lot worse if you‚Äôre not going to be invoking Galakrond. There‚Äôs probably only going to be 3-6 playable income cards per class, so it seems very unlikely we‚Äôll have a highlander Galakrond deck.
---
I've been playing since open beta and I want to swear that Dream cards had a different border at one point but I just quickly looked up [this video and it turns out that even in the closed beta it was just the hunter border](https://youtu.be/1iQwT897-As?t=332)
---
100 packs and play every day for a month straight and you should have everything you want to play with.
---
This is going straight into my reno-quest-DK-dragon-priest in wild.
---
Don't get me wrong, I loved the video, I liked the Outfit and the eerie feeling about the whole talk; and yes, she looks hot. But I would have loved to hear her talk about the card a little more. She is a good competitive player, I don't get why she wouldn't mention anything about it at all.
---
Where are the shaman cards??
---
It messes with me.
---
Mike Donais referenced it in a few posts from a week or two ago.  They're coming in December.  Amalgam is being changed to a 2/2.  They may have to change the name of the card, but the effect will be the same, just on a 2/2.
---
Thank you, I will hold off on crafting then until I know what I specifically need!
---
Feel free to apply if you think it‚Äôs that easy rather than shit talking people doing their job
---
Yes it is no longer correct. It was only correct for the second day of open beta where everyone was much lower rated.
---
Thank you both.  I will keep an eye opportunistically on older sets.
---
Ye it is lol, I reckon this is going straight in quest mage
---
to scam you.
---
yes, that's why i asked about current mmr.
---
ok thx, I was confused.
---
I expect there will be changes to amalgams once the game comes out of beta.  While I only have anecdotal evidence to back it up, I agree with you 100% that the winning board, either mine or an opponents, ALWAYS has at least one massive amalgam with some combination of poisonous, taunt, divine shield and windfury.  The most likely change is simply making it a tier 3 minion but even that may not be enough to stop its dominance in the game mode.  I‚Äôm actually in favor of removing it outright and this is despite winning numerous games on the back of an early amalgam or 2.  It‚Äôs just too easy to build around and takes away much of the forethought that comes with building a high tier beast or even mech deck where you‚Äôre constantly weighing whether it‚Äôs worth it to cash in one minion for another.
---
Windfury really doesn't do much in battlegrounds since a minion attacking and getting attacked are functionally the same unless there's minions with on attack or on kill effects. It definitely does not really counter divine shields since your windfury minion still gets hurt by attacking into a divine shield.
---
I wonder what her feelings about independence for Hong Kong are
---
Or khadgar/brann. 
---
Huh, golden khadgar or brann (plus 4 spaces...) means instant tells from token producers.
---
This is the first time that spoiler season is making me consider get the other bundle. Feels like I‚Äôll need every card of this set to play the game.
---
Obviously insane. Imagine two Alex's from one Alex.
---
Wow, this is the nutty stuff that makes me love Wild. Thanks for the link.
---
Damn, this just came out today so forgive me for not knowing that interaction!
---
It's simple
---
Thx
---
THIS... IS NO PLACE FOR MORTALS!
---
Tavern Brawl maybe
---
or someone else's
---
Came for the cards, stayed for the unconditional love.
---
even with u're edit u're still right still worst then mummy
---
Little weird to react like he did then ye.
---
7/7. Deals 1 more damage to, and takes one less damage from, Dragons.
---
That would be a terrible result from that card.
---
But it is way easier for mage to cast 3 spells in a turn than for a priest
---
&gt;yes, that's why i asked about current mmr.
---
Why do you need to ask about current mmr when he explicitly specified that what he was talking about is only for the 2nd day of open beta?
---
I don't think the same group of people asking for the cards back were the ones complaining. I never wanted cards brought back. I've always liked seeing stuff HoF'd.
---
She knows dae way.
---
\^oh god
---
Can we just replace that fat fuck Innkeeper with this suave soothing man?
---
odd warrior would not include the bomb package without access to the weapon. It would run the dragon package like it used too.  
---
even paladin would not run murlocs, it would be a highlander deck with normal midrangey paladin stuff, no combos. thats what even paladin did best, play solid cards on curve. 
---
 i am not even going to comment on odd quest priest. 
---
even shaman without flame tongue probably would not even exist considering evolve or quest shaman existing. vessina is good but when you try to build a deck, you realize how few ways there are to capitalize on your totems. seagiant, vessina... ? 
---
odd hunter - doubt it would be mech based. I would imagine it would just have an assload of 1 drops, kill command, unleash the hounds, eagle horn bow, leeroy.
---
evenlock- obviously i am sure you know that people would just play normal even lock.
---
and I don't know why you are sleeping on even rogue,it would be better than odd priest, shuffle evenlock, even shaman, and even murloc paladin.
---
Sorry to inform you he still doesn't. Playing a 4 mana 4/3 to copy slow minions is a quick ticket to getting yourself killed. Not to mention the variety of issues that come with duplicating, such as not actually gaining options and having to deal with hand space. We haven't seen all the cards in the set, but as it stands, there's nothing you'll happily copy.
---
Finally some dragqueens
---
and i fucking loved it. mmmm consistency. even decks were the best, hell i even played even druid and even rogue to legend.
---
Hand space is gonna be an issue and a full Dragon deck will not really be control.
---
Wow I love extreme rng cards!!
---
If control warrior is popular I could see it coming in strong since it'd essentially be add 2 or 3 removal cards to your hand.
---
People are gonna be mad when it hid itself and emeriss
---
often u see shirvallah into sathrovar into shirvallah so at least it'll deal with that
---
How the hell did your Baron Rivendare get Divine Shield?
---
Ehhhh I think deck diversity&gt;1 deck dominating
---
But battlegrounds is good, helping me save gold without needing to spend it
---
Thanks! It's admittedly unlikely and a bit wordy, but I wouldn't mind seeing something along these lines once in a while.
---
He wants tinkmaster to be played because he got it goled out of a pack.
---
I dont really play wild so I apologise for my ignorance.
---
I was talking about the shamans in standard. Simply put, just play warrior. Brawl and warpath are so good v shaman.
---
missed the friends guy and the skull still tho
---
Oh boy, kun-&gt;sath-&gt;floop loop
---
I wonder how many would downvote if it weren't anonymous.
---
FYI the number still changes when you change your battletag yourself. I've done it. Went from four to five :(
---
This is one of the card arts from Blizzcon.
---
&gt; We are putting a lot of work into improving this experience.
---
Except for Wild.
---
But then you have to play N‚ÄôZoth rogue. That‚Äôs boring as hell.
---
What are the mindgames here, exactly? They put a big dragon in it. What more do you need to know?
---
Same reason most black Friday sale prices aren't sales
---
i Play at 7 k mmr hmmm whats your rank.?
---
You're not wrong, but that's not really what I asked. *Data* to support this.
---
mmmm so dark pact and possesed lackey? Or what other warlock cards?
---
Remember that it also damages your minions so it's terrible for everyone
---
do the math for me plz on the chance u getting malygos and kalecgos and getting an aoe spell and comeback to me. and even then if that game happens to be vs warrior he'll just clear ur board. So u know what i still think this card i great design and won't be op
