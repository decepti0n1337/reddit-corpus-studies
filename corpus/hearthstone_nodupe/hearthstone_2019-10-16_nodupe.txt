And you seem to be missing the point that I never argued with the idea of freedom of speech, what I argued is that it gives you the right to say what you want without consequence, and it *does not*.
---
Article 19 of the ICCPR even clearly states that the exercise of the right of freedom of speech carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".
---
Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, **may not** be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."
---
-
---
I don't know why you keep arguing this, because at this point you're just seem to be argumentative. Nobody said freedom of speech or expression doesn't exist; what was said was that A) without laws to back it up, it's meaningless (see: China), and B) it does not and has never give you free licence to say whatever you'd like without consequence, whether that consequence be social, political, physical, business, or otherwise. Your only legal protection is against the government infringing on that right (see: first amendment), which is why businesses can fire employees over their opinions or conduct (depending on circumstance), Reddit can ban you, Blizzard can ban you, and other people can tell you to fuck off.
---
For example: I'm seriously tired of this conversation going in circles, so if you don't have anything useful to say, please go exercise your freedom elsewhere, or else I'm going to block you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. Good day.
---
That‚Äôs the point of the rule tho... it has to be broad so it can catch all of them not just ones say bother you or someone else. It‚Äôs a catch all so both part X and Y can be covered even though they‚Äôre on two different sides of the coin. 
---
It also keeps blizzard from being pulled into a side of an issue- wether you want to act as if punishing him makes them choose a side or not is on you- I know I don‚Äôt wanna be dragged into a conflict by any Joe Shmoe who attended my tournament.

Its far worse than you can imagine.  A middle ranked captain was known to have committed suicide after witnessing the barbarity he helped to muster.

You could cycle it 4 times at 10 mana, which is a combo that is still weaker than Ultimate Infestation on its own.
---
You could cycle more if Auctioneer sticks, but you have to worry about full hand, and decks would start including 4 damage removal if Auctioneer became popular again.
---
It's strong, but it's okay to print strong cards and idk if it's more busted than many other cards which have been printed in the past.
---
I‚Äôm very curious to how many companies out there are just keeping quiet hoping no one calls them out or drags them into this having them have to choose a side so to speak.
---
This isn't about Hong Kong being freed as it was. We know the history. We are not apologetic towards the British Empire. We do not support colonialism. We condemn the opium wars. This is not what this is about.  
---
This is all about the people versus a dictatorship. We support Hong Kong and their cries to be free, not because we thought they were free to begin with, but because we wish them to be free now. If the people of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chongqing or any other city or area would protest for their freedom we would stand with them as well. The same goes for Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Brunei, Egypt, Russia; you name it. In the face of oppression we will always support those who wish to be free.  
---
Human rights are not subject to cultural relativism. Human rights are not negotiable. Whenever and wherever someone is oppressed for their sexuality, their religion, for speaking out against their leader, for being born a certain color or of a certain cultural group, we will stand with them.  
---
There is no excuse. There is no history that can justify oppression. There is no cultural difference that will make us turn a blind eye to it.  
---
We don't stand with a country or a culture. We stand with the people. The people deserves to be free.

Because social justice warriors is usually used as a derogatory term. It's not bad per say, but involves people who are PC to the extreme while going around the internet thumping their chests on social issues with a sense of superiority and general unpleasantness. At least that is what it used to mean. I have a feeling we're moving past this though as more people are waking up to the very, very real social issues that are threatening our entire existence on this planet.

Oof, did not know that. This is why I usually avoid Twitter.

That does mean she was receiving death threats from the CCP, but probably not through Twitter. This is a shitty situation all around.
---
Don't apologize for teaching me something! Don't ever do that.

If anything, history is the thing I need to know the most about, because it's not something that interests me or is relevant to my day to day, and therefore, it would be trivially easy for me to maintain my ignorance.

Nobody cares about Hongkong- fakk nzoth

And wherever he is i agree with him. If blizzard wants to lick the boots of china, then they can do that in china and get the fuck out of the west.
---
Under an hour gets you a pack, under 40 minutes gets you a golden Ancient Mysteries.
---
Again, I really dont know.
---
I mean do you believe China is the greatest country in the world and anyone that is speaking negatively against them should be shunned? I doubt anyone that ever lived outside of their bubble would ever even consider it. I couldn't care less about the people in China, which is why I'm saying they should stay in their little world and not bother ours. Never considered myself as a savior, that's all in your head
---
I can confidently say that I'm not brainwashed because I can think about all sides of anything with rationality and reason, something that not everyone can do
---
Treason really shouldn't be a thing, but it is since the state needs to protect itself from rogues that backstab them for their own benefit
---
How can you write so much and completely ignore almost every single problem people have with China?

Obviously you must care a little since you commented.

I only need to think of living in a world like China to make me confident about the right choice.  Am doing my best to pull my money from China any way I can but the greed of American companies runs deep.
---
Such an extremely small sample size that in no way states how the entirety of the company feel. Also, with yes/no answers, that offers no options as to how strongly they feel that way. I actually feel that Blizzard was in the right to ban Blitchchung, but that they were way too severe in their penalty. So I didn't want him completely excused, but I didn't want the penalty to stay the way it was originally.
---
Still want that cheap stuff made in China? Of all Trumps failings, and there are many, standing up to China makes him a saint.

ITT: Yes, I can finally boycott Blizzard for not siding with Hong Kong by playing Riot's new card, and give my money directly to China instead.
---
Yeah exactly, I'm on an alternating BOTW, Odyssey, Mario Maker and Donkey Kong country atm. Really excited for Luigi's mansion too.
---
&gt; Those 3 cards were specifically removed from the sample size for no reason whatsoever, we also thought it would strengthen our argument.
---
I don't follow, what sample size? And who does "we" refer to here?
---
(As usual, you do you, people should do what they feel like doing)
---
Keep in mind, tho, that Hearthstone is a free to play game and it's not all about the money - or money from the players. They can use data like average users (monthly, daily, total active accounts the like to pretend are individual users) to keep their investors around.
---
Also, the game needs f2p players/grinders to populate the rank systems and reduce the search times for paying players (especially whales).
---
In other words, Blizzard is making money somehow if you stick around, even if you are f2p.
---
how it looks yeah, but its vastly different.
---
Hearthstone had essentially become my only game.  I'm a dad with limited time, and with the daily quests and the worry about falling behind, that daily session ate up all my spare time.  I'm not really one for boycotts, but letting this be the final push to just... *stop* has been freeing.

I can understand that, and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been considering.  It just is too uncomfortable for me to play Hearthstone right now, so I don‚Äôt.

That‚Äôs kind of the point of this post, I guess. To talk about how it‚Äôs awkward and uncomfortable to play more than decrying the game and everyone involved with it.

I don't hate it, but it is a worse version of the basic one so... why use it?
---

---
Appreciate the update!  Figured that was the case.
---
But many of the statements above are sustained campaigns that would require many thousands of willing participants to continue on even the smallest possible scale. In likelyhood there are tens if not hundred of thousands of people involved with the government pushing this brutality forward.  And, in America because of the freedoms we have, light is shed on the bad actions and so a path to outrage and justice is possible.  More over, we can speak out about the mistakes with out being "disappeared."  We can call trump a retarded cheetoo baby with tiny hands to his face and face nothing from the government... Although some of his citicen followers are zealots like the one that ran down a crowd and killed a woman... Who is now in jail for that murder. 
---
So, as someone from across the pond, it's not that mistakes are made.  It's not that the government does bad things.  It's that the government in China actively removes the checks that would stop these atrocities so they continue as a rampage.   
---
To put me in my place, I encourage you to inform me how some of these atrocious acts are condemned and corrected by the government.  And, much like any government in the world, course correction takes a whole so just look into the past and let me know some historical examples inform us how these will be prosecuted soon.  Is there any hope that they will be stopped and the people involved jailed?
---
Let's pretend I didn't care about China/Hong Kong and just want to stay away from that.
---
Western companies I deal with imposing stuff like China-style censorship or tailoring what I consume using Chinese government demands as the baseline worldwide is disturbing and I would be against that. And if they lose enough money, we could avoid or at least mitigate that, even if the Chinese dictatorship sticks around for a while.
---
And they laid off almost a thousand people last year because their record profits weren't "record" enough. Don't pretend the jobs are safe if they keep China happy.
---
Also, if they lose 10% of their Western Customers over this, it would be like losing China (Asia is 12% of their profits).
---
My guess it involves playing 3 brawls or something, so it probably doesn't make sense to push it out before the new brawl.
---
I personally stopped playing and uninstalled everything, even after spending thousands of dollars on the game (I regret nothing, like you, the game made me happy).
---
That said, we all protest in different ways (even this post is a form of protest). So we all do what we can to keep Blizzard accountable, even if it doesn't seem like it individually.

&gt; Which is why I'm deeply concerned about america's future. I feel like we've already completely lost control of our government. There are basically only two choices, and they both just want to further grow the government, just in different directions. There is literally no option to vote for if you want the government reduced. So it's just gonna keep growing and growing in alternating flavors, and we the people will just keep getting slightly less free year after year.
---
You're forgetting that in the US, you the people, control the government. You decide what it can and cannot do, and who runs the show.
---
The problem is that you, as a people, are completely apathetic and easily brainwashed.
---
&gt;The Democrats and Republicans have this unbreakable two party stranglehold on the entire system and they know it, so neither really seems to care what the people want anymore..what are you gonna do, vote for the other party? It feels like our problems are already far too deep to fix by working within the system, and that we're just gonna continue voting in a series of increasingly uncomfortable "lesser of two evils" elections as we slide down into authoritarian dystopia.

I consider myself an addict in the most literal sense. Like I‚Äôve done stupid stuff in the name of video games. But I‚Äôve given up on Hearthstone for good now. I still get the urge to install it and try that Kibler‚Äôs fancy deck I just saw but I stop myself. 
---
If this isn‚Äôt a good enough reason for me to abandon Hearthstone, I don‚Äôt know what else will be. It really puts life into perspective as to what extent can a digital game grow on you. This is where a line has to be drawn. In addition to the fact that I can‚Äôt support an organisation that sold it‚Äôs dignity for monetary benefits, it is also a stark reminder that life doesn‚Äôt put you in heroic scenarios to test your integrity but it‚Äôs everyday happenings like these that decide the type of person you are. 
---
I choose to move on, all the time and money will be spent somewhere else, somewhere more meaningful. Some where I don‚Äôt know yet but I‚Äôm glad I still I have the time to go searching for it. Good bye hearthstone. It was fun while it lasted. It‚Äôs time for me to stumble upon something just like I once stumbled upon hearthstone.

Yes, I did mean wouldn't. I personally find playing minion based decks with Mage difficult/boring. As I said, I usually go for some sort of combo with Sorcerer's Apprentice. Mage has the best spells, why not use them? Also, don't go into a run already having/forcing a win condition. Find one in your first 3-4 Buckets, Go for the ones that synergizes with your first and second treasure. Then pick a third treasure that fits the win condition.

I really didn‚Äôt care about any of this but now you just can‚Äôt seem to drop it. If you care so much about the Chinese being terrorized by their government or whatever why don‚Äôt you go fly yourself to China and start helping them cut down facial rec towers instead of acting high and mighty by posting tweets saying China is bad. That won‚Äôt do you or them any good except get other people on Twitter who think making an internet post is going to stop communism
---
I totally understand that. When you're not paying for the product you are the product. What I'm saying is, I love Hearthstone and (for the time being) intend to keep playing it. What I don't intend to do is give Blizzard my cash.
---
I just want to know what's the strategies they want behind this card? I can't imagine a time where I want enemy to have that much advantage.
---
There isn't *any* evidence.  It's just the story of one guy.  Why should he be believed?
---
That's true. I suppose really we are the ones in the tavern in WoW, using the heroes as our characters to play the game pretty much exactly like irl.
---
But looking at it the same way I was earlier, hitting the hero portrait with minions and weapons is just a way of representing taking damage and losing hp in the game itself, not the heroes in the "real world" of WoW getting hit by a Truesilver Champion or Leeroy Jenkins
---
Yeah I would say Americans won‚Äôt go too far with a boycott. However, for very good economic reasons China is on the way to a big collapse. Central planning will be their undoing.

Nope. She‚Äôs an ice mage canonically. Three specs of mages are ice, fire, and arcane. Jaina‚Äôs portrait is just her BFA appearance, but red. That‚Äôs why people are confused why she‚Äôs suddenly changed from frost mage to fire mage.

Hey I‚Äôm not aware of what happened could someone explain or link an article??! I don‚Äôt keep up with news and am new to Blizzard games. :(

Also the fact it deals in crypto means until they change that dumb decision I‚Äôm stuck exclusively being f2p on it.

you know they reduced the punishment why are people still talking about this

lol stop making stuff up.
---
I feel the exact same way
---
I haven't played Hearthstone in a long while, but this is the first post I've seen revolving it. Just for clarification, what's going on with Blizzard? I did some digging, but didn't really understand to what was going on. Can anyone explain please? Would really appreciate it.
---
Blizzard are being boycotted for their decision, not their association with Tencent. Were it not for their egregious rulings it'd be business as usual. IMO people would have a bigger influence by spreading the message about Hong Kong than trying to boycott anything with chinese investors in it.
---
Any recommendations for former mobile users? I know Gwent is suppose to come out on mobile soon but since things are up in the air I‚Äôll take suggestions
---
The worse skin by far
---
You‚Äôre probably typing this from a smart phone made of components primarily from China. I guess it‚Äôs better to bash some game company than to actually change your own actions which directly funds the very same regime you claim to despise. Nice.
---
People can do anything they want they are entititled to their hobbies. I'm not gonna post something like uninstal the game just to farm karma and such. Don't get me wrong I support hk and I hope that it will end peacefully for them. This is their freedom to protest and this is our freedom to enjoy the games we like. I am a free2play player since 4 years and still not gonna pay. People will probably argue that in a way I still support china. Well that's their thoughts and words not mine. I don't do micro transaction in ow and i still enjoy it. What sadden me is that in a way this situation is not helping the community, because people are now more divised than ever. People who try to sty neutral are being targeted by people who want to force some sort of agenda on them and I don't like it. 
---
Anyway, I do hope that trend kinda die down, still waiting for it. As BLizt said in his statement, if you want to uninstal or stay it's your freedom. I do hope that people won't harrass the devs because I do believe that not all the devs agreed with the blizz decision. I believe in reason, I have faith in the gaming community and I hope this situation just stop.
---
Ironically I have been playing the game more than previous as of recently. But not because of the new, more because I find the game fun currently. News don't effect how I play or enjoy my games, after all politics don't belong in my games and thus have no impact what-so-ever.

The fact it happened drew attention, not a loss in users.

Ah, well he only does the character for the jimquisition videos. His Disco Elysium review was high up on reddit the other day and it's a great example of him being completely serious.
---
And anyways, it might not be clear in every single jimquisition video but in a good majority of them it should be clear the whole thing is a shtick. I always have a hard time explaining it, but I think it's kinda like the character is too perfect of a galaxy-ego idiot to actually exist? And also his genuinely insightful commentary contrasts so much with the r/iamverysmart -esque portrayal of the character.
---
Hahaha joke's on you, being shouted at is my kink
---
^^^^^REVOLT
---
&gt; I'm curious about something I keep hearing, why throw out studies that were done because the organs used might have been unethical?
---
This is one of the biggest questions in bioethics. While I am not specifically a bioethicist, I'm a research scientist who has done a lot of work ON bioethics.
---
The reason being that... say an unethical scientist wanted the world to have this knowledge. They didn't really care about the _cost_, to themselves others. They just want the world to learn it, via their research. So they perform unethical human experiments, believing it to be absolutely justified either because the people themselves are lesser, and therefore there is no crime because "real" people are benefited, or simply because they believe that science _itself_ is the higher goal and that no lake of blood is too deep to wade through to place another tome upon the shelves of the libraries of human knowledge. They perform these experiments until they are caught, and give the knowledge to those who capture and punish or even execute them. Maybe they use the knowledge to barter for their freedom; take the blood from my hands, smear it across your own, read the pages I wrote with my quill dipped into the still-beating heart of an unanaesthetised infant dying of ischaemia. 
---
What you have there is the story of Joseph Mengele, the chief medical officer of the Nazis and right-hand man, scientifically, to Hitler himself. His subordinates bought their freedom from the Americans and the British by selling their research in exchange for liberty and immunity, but even had they not been granted their freedom we'd have taken the knowledge regardless, somehow. 
---
**By allowing the use of research learnt through the immoral slaying of innocents, we become those allied forces who sold their souls in exchange for knowledge bought with the blood of tortured children.**
---
Mengele had a fascination with twins, and would pluck identical and fraternal twins from the lines of mostly Jewish families in order to experiment upon them. The so-called "Mengele Twins" were subjected to some of the worst Nazi war atrocities; some were chained to chairs, forced to watch as a "negative control" while their siblings were dropped into frozen lakes, then forced to stay under until almost dead to see how long they could survive hypothermia. Others were strapped down and had limbs removed, then Mengele and his torturers would transplant those limbs onto the bodies of their siblings to see what happened. Some were deliberately infected with diseases like smallpox, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other lethal diseases, then left in a room with minimal rations to see how long they could survive when left untreated. The use of twins, Mengele believed, gave _repeatability_: a cornerstone of science. 
---
**All this and so much worse was done in the name of knowledge.**
---
Then, like fools making a deal with the devil, **we bought that knowledge from hands that not a day earlier had been holding down Jewish women before their babies were cut from their wombs just to see how long they'd survive without incubation.**
---
By using that knowledge, ANY knowledge, gained through that process... we legitimise it. We say "we will take this off you." We say that others who are so psychopathic as to believe it is justified are allowed to kill people in the name of bad science just so long as they're willing to die for it themselves - as well as the victims they murder. 
---
And quite apart from that, **the studies are rarely even scientifically valid.** They often have no repeatability even if we DID have less morals than them; they're uncontrolled or poorly controlled; they measure multiple dependent variables. The works. Often the studies _literally aren't even worth the paper they're written on_, which is a fucking travesty given what was spent to attain that paper.
---
###That's why we should never justify these "studies" by using them. Not ever. 
---
* It encourages others.
---
* It justifies war-crimes.
---
* It allows war-criminals to go free.
---
* **It's not even valid scientifically.**
---
Ahh, so that's why America has Trump.  It finally makes sense.
---
Can‚Äôt say it‚Äôll be the Hearthstone killer, but the game looked fun enough that I‚Äôll give it a try
---
Just researched and will not continue playing Blizzard games. Sad :(
---
Garrosh skin is the best one
---
Rules are rules and if you agreed to abide by them then you understand that if you break them you will be subject to the penalties. For instance you can't engage in civil disobedience and expect to have punishment waived.
---
China makes the best games.
---
Personally I enjoy the 1000 wins portrait for rogues. Granted it's not my favorite of the 9, it's certainly far from being Thrall or Rexxar levels of bad.
---
I generally find that shaman players have a few hot tactics they use to try and win. Thing is the classic deck encourages you to basically spam the board to win. Personally I tend to focus on elementals and overloads when I play.
---
Priest players suffer from the same restrictions in the meta. But none more so than rogues.
---
Don't be confLicted, a new hEArthstone update cominG to yoUr areEa soon ;)
---
Hardcore nationalism and isolationist ideals are almost always the beginning of a really bad slide into totalitarian rule and crimes against humanity that often follow.
---
You've just pulled numbers out of your arse to justify a point you're assuming, while having absolutely no evidence nor logic to back that point up; something you have to KNOW you're doing otherwise you wouldn't have known you needed to pull the numbers out of your arse. How can you be dumb enough to write that comment, and not realise it's sekf defeating?
---
Wish people would get this upset at our corrupt government.. 
---
It doesn't fit the narrative i guess /s
---
You not playing does nothing so just play
---
I have played league since season three and can say they do get involved about as much as Blizzard does. A few months ago they were supporting diversity by giving out icons in game. Riot also supports disaster relief every year through IMC. 
---
China is a very touchy subject at the moment. Most companies just want to avoid the conversation entirely.
---
Give me the feeling that people are protesting just to protest.
---
You want to protest, kill your own companies to make a statement, fine. I better see you fuckers voting for some REAL change in 2020 and not playing armchair protester behind that keyboard of yours.
---
üìû BabyRage HELLO BLIZZARD üìû BabyRage I WANT TO REPORT A BUG üìû BabyRage MY OPPONENTS ARE ALL SO LUCKY
---
Same I haven't opened the app once since the Blizzchung thing. I've been playing a lot since the beta.
---
I didn't miss a single meta since the beginning but this time I think I'm done with HS.
---
&gt;A people always deserve exacly the government that they have.
---
That would be the case in a democracy, but the Chinese Communist Party actively suppresses any political party that could possibly threaten it.
---
They've "disappeared" political dissidents, crushed grass-roots movements, and straight-up murdered groups which advocate democracy. There was a particularly famous example you might've heard of called the Tiananmen Square Massacre. The students there were actively campaigning in support of greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. 
---
The Chinese people deserve the right to democracy, which their brutal oppressive regime actively suppresses. You deserve that, I deserve that, everyone deserves that.
---
Every one and their grandpa have the best legendary at rank 20 atm, so who cares lol
---
What are you basing that on?
---
They could have made the free cards unable to be sold or traded.
---
Play eternal. 
---
Better in every way
---
Exactly.
---
I just pray that valve doesn‚Äôt do the same... i dont wanna boycott my fav games on steam
---
It didn't have to, but there were bots that did it. There were also bots that just maxed out your apm, whether or not yoy also cancelled animations.
---
I would absolutely play mtga if it was mobile.
---
&gt; Do not encourage others to target or take action towards an individual or organization.
---
You do know the UN definition upholds all of China's restrictions, correct?
---
Yes yes, well played.  
---
I will mirror all of this.
---
I play the pokemon tcg online and its pretty fun
---
Lmao yup
---
There is a term for your feeling: Moral Integrity.  I feel just like you.
---
I haven't played Hearthstone since the inicident, but i haven't deleted my account either. I am conflicted, I love the game but I hate Blizzard (the Chinese cocksuckers) and then there is the investment (or wasted money) that i have. 
---
What I have started playing since is MTG Arena, it's come on a long way since the beta and i think this is a game i can play in the long run and leave HS for good.
---
Well I see censorship and propaganda as separate things, the former is shit but the latter is strong
---
they also need to cool it with the otks over in shadowverse, way too many decks taking you from max to 0 when they hit 10 mana
---
idk , last time when was dual class arena was so fun , lots of op combos between 2 classes , now i receive to draft only minions and no combos . No removal spells and a lot of neutral minions. And also almost no card draw . If i lost early game i lose match 80% of time .
---
Did i defend it? I just said it's not exclusive to totalitarian regimes
---
And since they are starter cards, everyone has them, so why would you buy them anyway?
---
Why would people pissed off about Blizzard trying to appease the Chinese government, go to a game owned 100% by a Chinese run company.
---
Right on, buddy. Reminds me of what admirable said.
---
Team Fortress 2
---
Just wait for BlizzCon. In my eyes there is pretty much no way they won't dig a bigger even hole there. Even if a super cool-looking Diablo 4 is announced, I can't help but feel like the company like we used to know it is dead.
---
&gt; by the way, they let go of support staff and also hired more developers as a result
---
If you have a source for them actually doing it and not just saying they'd do it, I'd love to see it, I wasn't able to find the number of hires anywhere.
---
Yes, the impact of a single person‚Äôs actions are miniscule and overstating their importance should be avoided, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúliterally nothing‚Äù. Literally nothing would be continuing on exactly the same as before.
---
Meh, nice upvote fishing
---
Riot Games was majority-acquired by¬†Tencent¬†in February 2011 and fully acquired in December 2015.¬†
---
Tencent Holdings Limited is a Chinese multinational¬†conglomerate¬†holding company
---
You were saying?
---
Exactly, I have no love or support for what blizzard did in the 1st place but at this point people are straight up demonizing every single thing they do.  That's trying to instigate something from nothing and I can't get on board with that.
---
We can't get away from them though. A quick google search shows the amount of companies Tencent has invested in. If I stop playing everything they touched, even by a small percentage, I'm stuck with EA. No thanks.
---
Tencent somehow invested in Discord. Like, we can't run. We just can't. It's totally fine to be against Blizzard's way to deal with this situation but we're gonna reach a point that there's no escape anymore.
---
And the problem that created this mess in the first place were the excessive punishments of blitzchung and the casters.
---
Cool we are discussing another company‚Äôs card game here now...
---
If it has a new IP I would be interested. If it still using League of Legends characters and settings then I won‚Äôt be.
---
It's almost as if China was a capitalist country...
---
Never said I would, in fact I think this is a really stupid move by Riot given how much heat gaming companies that are making business with and/or are partially or completely owned by the Chinese market are getting
---
I'll definitely try it, HS isn't as much fun as it used to be for me and it's impossible to keep up with new cards onMTGA if I don't play every day. Hope this game will be fun, fresh, and don't feel like a second job.
---
Well Blizzard is an actual demon already so demonizing isn't that bad
---
I expected them to be wearing gas masks and holding umbrellas
---
Well played
---
I was saying,
---
League created a card game
---
A first person shooter game
---
A "street fighter" game
---
An action rpg/mmorpg
---
And on top of that an animated series
---
basically an attempt to end blizzard.
---
This is where I'm at. I'll launch HS every now and then, play one game and just feel gross and quit.
---
Sure bud, but you're on Reddit which Tencent also invests in, so go ahead and quit supporting them by posting instead of virtue signaling.
---
When you're outright posting the same thing everyday, why wouldn't that be spam and thus breaking the sub's rules?
---
Thanks for the update!
---
Are we also getting another free arena ticket?
---
Priest Anduin never needed a costume.
---
He was always walking around dressed up like Captain Crunch.
---
That playing a deck that can apply pressure before turn six.
---
Oh, I'm sure you know sooo much more than me
---
You're so woke OMG!! 
---
Your metaphor makes no sense. Also fuck your stupid karma farming post is shit and pandering. Leave the game if you want, but the only reason your posting about it is to look good. Why dont you make a post about every China related product that you're giving up alongside Hearthstone?
---
it's amazing how much better blizzard is at balancing now. they don't have to remove something from the meta entirely anymore, just reduce how prevalent it is.
---
It is LITERALLY impossible to prove you didn't cheat. You also can't sue blizzard because their ToS which you agree to gives them the right to terminate your account at any time for any reason. That ToS clause would be upheld, and they could easily provide evidence to support their decision, cuz guess what, that evidence exists or else they wouldn't have banned you.
---
Even if the evidence was flawed, there is no way to prove that for any specific case. Your only hope would be to demonstrate a false-flagging.
---
Of course it will have its problem - just like every single "live" game (in HS arena rewards right now can give you event cards... so, yeah small indie...).
---
Also, their rules/cards engine is way, way more complicated than HS so you can expect a bug here and there.
---
It‚Äôs a good day, glad you‚Äôre leaving!
---
I haven't looked into the game as much, watched like 1 stream, but you get attack/defense turns. And it's up to you to decide who your enemy is attacking, not up to him. I've only touched HS in my life, so I'm not experienced in other card games, (I did nolive that witcher 3 card game more then I played witcher 3 itself tho) so idk if this concept is something new, but it looks more diverse then the HS version of I attac u attac I attac U attac
---
We don't even know hes fully doing that either. All we have is his word.
---
I was a fanboy too but I was less enamored when they were bought by activision and where abusing it's workers through overworking, layoffs, and slashing employee benefits. That's when it was no longer the blizzard I knew to me.  Which is a shame since it was such a large part of my life and got me into gaming.

---
Literally no one cares. Let this clown fiesta die already. ANYONE ELSE HYPED FOR BLIZZCON????
---
If MtG Arena and a new digital card game designed by Richard Garfield can't instantly take Hearthstone, I doubt one made by Riot could do much more.
---
Plus, all card games are random. It's just that Heartstone wears its randomness on its sleeve.
---
Same.
---
I didn't play much HS anyway in the past few weeks, since Monster Hunter is my main game right now. I still did some daily quests here and there, but it really doesn't feel good to log into Blizzard launcher honestly.
---
Oh, it's plenty obvious you're trying to be funny. Lack of a sarcasm tag is not the problem.
---
I really feel like if they came out and said that they'd still find a way to complain
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I mean fucksakes, people were claiming the the J Allen Brack post was Chinese, and that they have Blitz's family and that's why he said he was okay with Blizzard outside of a few things
---
This is one horny story
---
1.) Rotation keeps power creep in check
---
2.) If price is derived from card rarity, it's not much different than what we have in HS right now
---
Yep!
---
Who exactly is Blizzard oppressing? You talk such absolute shit, your like a politician with your positive buzzwords that make you sound good, but mean fuck all.
---
That sort of things has been said a myriad times about MtG, and soon after MtG became bigger than it already was. Hearthstone's not going to be much different in the long term in that regard.
---
For what it's worth, I agree with you. 
---
But OP's post -- their supposedly meaningless act of protest that I have taken part in, (and which you, admittedly) engaged in -- has gotten us both talking. Discussing what can be done despite the direness of the situation. I find that to be worth something at least. 
---
And it appears we both agree that one meaningful change that can be done is via legislation. Not just any legislation. U.S legislation. And how can we affect legislation? By voting, by engaging in the democratic system, by letting reps know that U.S companies shouldn't be bullied by China. But you and I know that may not even work. But it's better than a seemingly pointless boycott of a video game right? 
---
But I can't do that. 
---
Why? Because I'm not American. I'm not from the U.S. But I am from a country, that has been slowly yet alarmingly affected by China's authoritarianism and obsessive expansionism. And despite all the misgivings of the U.S, I still recognize that the states (alongside its allies) has the power to at least push back against China's seemingly unstoppable growing authoritarian influence. My country doesn't have that power. We don't have that leverage.
---
And so here I am, voicing my discontent, in what little way I can (among other things I am already doing locally) so that maybe some well meaning American can see what we're both talking about and recognize what needs to be done (at least with regards to U.S companies and organizations). It might not be you, but it might be someone who's reading this very thread (in the same way I stumbled on OP's post). 
---
Because you're right. Reddit isn't the place to enact sweeping, lasting change. But as someone who has no voice in the U.S government, from a country that the rest of the world doesn't give two shits about, it's all I've got.
---
As for Blizzard stock rising, it shouldn' t be surprising. Neither should it be disheartening. Because I think some boycoytters are missing the point. The target isn't Blizzard. The target is China. The platform is Blizzard.
---
It's weird because TFT is so much better than Underlords in this regard. It feels open and airy, compared to Underlords' cramped and claustrophobic design.
---
wasn't hard for me, blizzard games suck in the first place
---
I'm sure you can go to more appropriate subs and talk about China and suppression of human rights, yet here you all are on a video game sub trying to shoehorn virtue signalling posts into the day to day.
---
&gt; A quick google search shows the amount of companies Tencent has invested in. If I stop playing everything they touched, even by a small percentage, I'm stuck with EA. No thanks.
---
And Riot is a 100% subsidiary of them. The choice is easy.
---
What's a good way to promote American business? By witchhunting and making non-issues into issues apparently
---
Same here buddy, same here.
---
Do you know what's going on?
---
I saw that too. So. from what is available to us the game is just Hearthstone with MTG battle mechanics where you can chose defenders to protect you.
---
For me, this is half assed MTG. if they don't implement reactive spells that you can cast in reaction to ennemy's action it will be HS with a non original twist
---
Yes.
---
Because it's been a week and they initially decided against punishment. That's what matters.
---
Not them, a week later, deciding to retroactively punish them in an obvious PR move just so blizz can stand there and claim they were fair. When they very much weren't
---
I love how most people ignore or are unaware of the Valeera portrait is the 1000 win one and not halloween ü§£üëç
---
Great post
---
Na you didnt, you also made a post so people can take turns wanking you iff for your bravery.
---
You have spells that you can cast to react if I understood whats going on on the streams correctly.
---
I don‚Äôt care....
---
Cool, now do rogue
---
Done, thanks mate!
---
I don't think some devs releasing a single SP game once every 5 years will satisfy who want to boycott Blizz, Riot or GGG with mostly online services
---
Eternal is literally just Magic but a little bit different
---
Sometimes you can avoid supporting these things and sometimes you can't. With entertainment products it's easy to avoid all together
---
Done thank you
---
ToS had a data breach a few months ago, maybe check if your email was affected.
---
Still shows how much China has an influence over Blizzard.
---
Blitzchung's situation: FKING BAN HIM AND TAKE HIS MONEY!!

---
AU: Eh, it's just a piece of paper. \*A week later\*, eh 6 months then

You're probably looking at a Paladin deck. [Mech Paladin](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/mech-paladin-13-legend-leta-uldum-post-nerf/) and [Jambre Paladin](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/cr9i79/top_20_legend_standard_hand_paladin_guide/) are slowish midrange decks that scale well into later in the game. They're not up to date for the event or top tier, but you could use them as a template for a deck using what you have available. Should be effective enough in the lower ranks.
---
You say that as if your stats proved anything. I've said why they don't.
---
Jaina definitely does use fire, but she's primarily known as a Frost Mage.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt take it away, but it shouldn‚Äôt be the reward for 1000 wins either
---
Or just maybe since it was some unknown college team rather than on a global stage they didn't feel like it was as urgent to process this disciplinary action? That's how the real world worls. You are just making the story which fits your agenda.
---
Well the only thing left for u is thinking that the real ppl behind this games aren't the suits. The suits are the ines kneeling to China. The ppl behind this games are gamers just like us that love their creation aren't happy about the direction the company has taken since the merger with Activision
---
I'm argue its my favourite console of all time, or at least in recent memory. Watching shows like E3 and seeing new games come out I'm very much like 'meh - that seems okay but I won't play it' watching the Nintendo direct I generally get excited at the games and 'think, wow, I'd play that", and from that point alone of making me want to play games its one of the best consoles for me.
---
Actually that might have been some misinformation, the newspaper headline says that but when I looked for a quote it looks like they just went radio silent BUT their next match was scheduled normally where Blitz was insta-banned so it was probably a fair assumption

Impressive, to say the least.

Alright then, I will give it a shot cuz why not, thanks
---
I wonder if this will be a standard for anyone who bring politics into Heartstone comp or any Blizzard comp. What if a Trump supporter says something ? Or a Feminsit ? Were does the line goes ?
---
Or both of u guys and myself don't know anything. So whatever we r saying are just speculation anyway. But the string of events that has occurred so far does put bliz in a very bad light as to bliz's motivations and reasons for their actions.
---
Probably a coding issue. Might accidentally remove your cards at the end of the event.
---
How much does Tencent own of Riot ?
---
Well, I liked MTGA it just felt a bit slow to start out as f2p
---
Riot is own by a Chinese company. Lmao
---
It's not capitalist if the state owns all ther major companies
---
VoR and anything else? I cant remember haha I have like 100 Emmaria Tanderis because I think that card is hilarious
---
This reminds me of posts people make before deleting their facebook page, only to return a few months later.
---
&gt; Even knowing that most of the developers behind it don‚Äôt support the blatantly pro-China action
---
The developers, artists, engineers, etc likely don‚Äôt have any influence on the direction of the company.  It‚Äôs the leadership that deserves the blame.  Most of the company is just trying to keep their job.  I suspect they are going to be losing employees over this.
---
I quit World of Warcraft back in 2017 because it was effecting my health and my job (TBH, my guild did disband, but instead of looking for a new guild I was able to step away from the game). It's not exactly to the same extent with Hearthstone, but I was skimping out on doing cardio here and there because I wanted to play HS. I think it is for the best not to get sucked into these types of games.
---
I emote well played when someone plays well 0.0 if they make a clutch combo happen, or a clutch spell, or like for example zephrys saves them at the last second, I say well played. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rude at all to try and be encouraging and tell your opponent they did a great play.
---
oh, alright. thanks for the info!
---
yeah, I guess that has to be it. It's just, last week we got the quest one day before the brawl, but honestly that was kinda weird, and getting them on the same day makes more sense
---
R u referring to the one year ban for blitzchung and firing the 2 castors?
---
Not lucky at all, our rights are not consequence of luck, they were won with blood and tears. And we risk losing them, China is the spearhead of freedom loss globally. If they win we all lose.
---
I read it from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International and the New York Times actually.
---
Mobile is working fine for me right now. It may be a problem with your install. I had something similar happen a while back. It was because some of the assets were missing/were on a corrupted bit of my memory card. The client has changed quite a bit since then so not sure if these will fix it but:
---
1) Try an uninstall, reinstall
---
2) If HS data has been moved to your SD card (honestly not even sure if you can do this anymore) then try installing directly to internal storage.
---
I assume so. However, apparently the numbers have not dipped enough for that.
---

Looking for an alternative to HearthStone? Try Gods Unchained

[https://godsunchained.com?beta-key=dmTqvySkgz](https://godsunchained.com?beta-key=dmTqvySkgz)
---
You can earn money playing it. I'm making approximately $1,000 a month playing it
---
yeah, i did the same - made a game of seeing how big i could make it until i realized that only up to 20 BFFs carry over to future decks
---
it's funny, the "LASTS FOREVER" thing is heavily emphasized in the text presumably to give people a sense of what they're committing to, but of course the short description is so unclear as to what the card actually does that it doesn't help. 
---
cool weird thing to get into for a few days but i'm glad the brawl is rotating now
---
You are correct it is not censorship if you can classify it with another word.

[Outsiders misrepresenting facts and twisting truths](https://i.imgur.com/KugKfP8.png) to fool the common people like yourself. Do you honestly believe there are no terrorists who happen to be Uyghurs? The "one million" in camps in itself is BS, and now the figure is up to 3 million. I don't understand how anyone even buys this crap. A little investigation and the whole thing falls apart.
---
And even now, you still have not proved to me that
---
&gt;  the government has convinced the han chinese that uyghurs are all terrorists 
---
and that
---
&gt; the population at large is in support of keeping the social harmony by treating the uyghurs as third class citizens.
---
OP‚Äôs post smells like quality pasta to me.
---
The trouble is the game needs a rework from the ground up, with the PC having a more robust coding structure and the mobile client being much liter. One of the reasons the game never really advanced to it's full potential is because of blizzards obsession with the mobile market and not taking the time to do things right.
---
I think this is the point and it is why I support consequences for injecting politics into Hearthstone, and most other games.
---
Even Overwatch I think I'd only really appreciate politics that coincides with Overwatch's "Anyone can be a Hero!" Mantra that defines its universe. It's a happy-go-epic Disney rendition of a shooter with a diverse cast of characters, and that sounds like spreading the love more than a political message to me. Overwatch has tread ground with supporting LGBT, and so is something I can imagine figures passing commentary on in, for instance, the Overwatch League (and they have).

But Hearthstone and Warcraft in general is so disjointed from real world politics that any effort to reflect or comment on it would be forced. This is especially the case in gaming, a place where many people often go to *escape* real world problems, not dwell and deliberate on them.
---
The only thing I can think of that makes sense would be "And don't forget to vote! It's so important that you do!" At relevant times like NA broadcasts coming up to Presidential election. Both because it doesn't take a specific political stance and thus is very unlikely to offend people, and because you can argue that it benefits the notion that Every Voice Matters - not a political statement but a Blizzard Entertainment ideal.
---
As much as I love Marvel and many of its cast, I found it distasteful how halfway through their "Save the day!" Video they go from "Be a hero and vote" to "Vote against Trump, who is. . ."
---
That kind of leveraging of fame and popularity is distasteful to me. I don't disagree with Blitz doing it because the stakes are quite different (he put himself at risk doing it, and did so fully aware there would be consequences) and because the message is near universally agreed upon (nearly everything political is painfully multi-faceted, but this seems like one of the most black-and-white scenarios possible). But "I'm famous and successful so I want to let my voice be louder than others" is, well... just not my thing the majority of the time. 
---
Certainly not when it's in unrelated escape media. Not in Hearthstone the game, not in the Starcraft GSL broadcasts, not in Warhammer 40K codexes, not in the upcoming Lord of the Rings series, and not in *most* MCU content (Dr. Strange and Spiderman as examples. But, Luke Cage and Black Panther are both phenomenal and given Black Panther's success, there is mad desire to explore deep political topics more. The great thing about having a Marvel Cinematic *Universe* is that it can be political in some areas and apolitical in others).
---
While I said I don't disagree with Blitz doing it, I also don't disagree with him being punished. He did break the rules, and Hearthstone is not a platform for politics - and I think it should stay that way.
---
Blizzard dun goofed hard though when their overly severe punishment could only be interpreted by so many people as a political statement in itself. Blizzard injected politics into their own game and not just injected politics, but took the wrong side. So don't misinterpret what I said as defending Blizzard as a whole. I'm only defending that Blitz deserved some punishment, and personally I think the new punishment is a fair one, it's just a shame it took such a dramatic error (and subsequent community backlash) to set it "right." And even then, the "No one believed that" lie of China connections having nothing to do with their initial decision *significantly* diminishes whatever impression of sincerity J. Allen Brack would have had.
---
Anyway, apologies for the rambling. I hope this is something a fair few people resonate with, though, and helps other people understand this kind of point of view.
---
I would imagine that liking China is aligned with disliking the CCP.
---
Jeez man
---
Add randomized delays between actions, add small, random deviations in the path to each point you want to move to, define target points in the middle of the portrait and send the mouse to that position plus a random offset. Now your mouse movements aren't perfect, you don't always click the same spot, and it takes varying amounts of time to 'think' about its moves.
---
I have also stopped playing Hearthstone. It's not much, but it felt like the least that I could do.
---
\*for chinese players.
---
Mate I know New York Times makes up fake news but I highly doubt even they have written an article saying you get your organs harvested while alive if you post anti-government stuff online lol.
---
The PR team should give us their salaries.
---
Its the same for me with Overwatch. Every time I feel like I want to play a game, it just makes me feel bad. Like, if I were to open the game, I'd just feel shitty about it.
---
It really bums me out as Overwatch was probably my most played game ever. But here I am not wanting to even give it a try.
---
Screw you Blizzard, you've ruined my perception of my favorite game
---
I actually deleted the game and left the sub, but if it helps you feel better then feel free to make fun of how I also don‚Äôt approve of Brexit.
---
somehow though riot managed to avoid committing gross acts against free speech for the sake of profits when they‚Äôre 100% owned by tencent while blizzard is only 5% owned by them
---
Hey so I 100% agree but what about the modern warfare reboot? Is that a moral grey area? Or can you buy it on steam? I only ever remember seeing it on the blizzard launcher and I don‚Äôt want it if it means I have to use blizzard.
---
reallife#1847 NA Quest Trade, I'll show you go first
---
Apple has recently started making some of their iPhone models in India and is looking to expand. Part of this is because India has laws that if you want to sell there, you have to manufacture a certain percentage of products there. I'm actually all on board with companies diversifying their manufacturing and branching out to other countries. Being held to the whims of just one country makes it hard to go to the bargaining table and say 'No'. But we'll see what happens. Pretty much every major tech company is in the same boat. It's impossible to not have something in your life that's made in China, especially if you use or work in tech, you are kind of screwed. Until more companies start diversifying their labor China is going to have a lot of say in what they do. I think this recent movement is going to start a lot of conversations internally with major tech companies.
---
Well reasoned post. And this is coming from a side thats vehemently against chinese interference in my beloved video game company.
---
Hmmm comes out right after blizzard drama hmmmm
---
Because it's disrespectful to the person submitting the artwork disregarding their effort as irrelevant and just seems to forcefully trying to derail the post topic for the sake of it. When there are other threads discussing the Hong Kong and Blizzard issue.
---
theres a 10/10 in the way of avenging wrath...
---
Literally the entire reason to play khadgar, for me nothing was more satisfying during ungoro than to hit them with ‚Äútime for a lesson insolent pup‚Äù just before fireballing everything it‚Äôs probably the most toxic I‚Äôve ever been on hs and I remember those days fondly
---
They just showed a clip of it on their 10th anniversary stream yesterday. It's definitely not a rumor.
---
GIBPE
---
It's not going to happen ):
---
You are referring to the penalty for mentioning  politics in their platforms?
---
Np :)
---
Conceptually, do you understand that what they've done is not "ban or not ban", "act or not act", but betray a trust and assumption of good faith?  This is why they can appear to do nothing to soothe everyone right now, not because people are hypocrites, but because they have lost the assumption of innocence and impartiality.  Now every action is viewed through that lens and that reframing is their fault.
---
What I find strange is that non of the production team were punished. In my opinion it is the producers responsibility to make sure content that is harmful does not air.
---
That's true, OP probably forgot that only those that fight *every* single injustice in the world are entitled to speak out about *any* injustice.
---
Yes I support it too

Very brave and powerful üôè

Yeah I had no idea brawl would just work

I can make more money by supporting a communist regime that is running a genocide and abhorrently violating its people‚Äôs human rights
---
Or, I can make less money but sacrifice no quality of life whatsoever and stand against those horrible things
---
Tough choice
---
How about let someone submit their cool artwork.
---
Oh another WoW killer. At least this one has great timming..
---
I know, caring about things and people is so 2000-and-late!
---
explain to me what the us monitoring activists, sanctioning us enemies and us extradition in hong kong does for the poor people there? there were previous protests in that city specifically about housing/food/water but this sub didnt care.
---
ive been fighting pro china trolls all week. they just wave it off and say that it's CIA trickery and the US does bad things too.
---
So you're saying people should just never argue with actions they deem unjust as long as there are written rules about it?
---
Because nobody except for some SJW‚Äôs care.
---
I am the common people too, just from the other side of the world. Your elite control the media and want to turn us against each other. 
---
All this talk and still no evidence. "An anonymous source", "an insider who asked to remain anonymous" or some other bullshit. It's clear that they're just making this shit up. They're just going for whatever sounds scariest to rile us up.
---
The American Government is scared. It's scared of a multipolar world. Now it's trying to manufacture consent to go to war. They did that with Iraq. They did that with Syria. They did that with Lebanon. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk\_Sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw)
---
 Japan is another one. Massive Yellow Peril in the 60s. China is just the latest in a long chain of many competitors.
---
Separating fun and recreation from politics is easy. I can still play the game, for fun, the same way I can enjoy a song from artist that's done something bad. I won't be buying his new albums (or packs etc in this case), nor will I recommend anyone to do so, but I'll still partake and use what I've invested in.
---
They just won't get another dime, stream views or anything like that from me. Their f2p model crashesh if everyone just plays, and never does anything that increases their revenue.
---
Is it on mobile?

Your inability to disable your caps lock key has convinced us. User name checks out.
---
Well your phone and 70% of your home is probably filled with chinese products so ehhhh
---
To be fair, to completely avoid supporting China, you would need to stop consuming anything from most of the major companies, because nearly each one of them has some ties to China (even if there was no scandal around them yet).
---
But I do understand that it might be a turn-off. I'm glad that the whole Blizzard boycott increased the awareness for stuff like that.
---
Blizzard's not consistent and will change their position based on public outrage, we know that. But taking a week or two to decide on disciplinary action is completely normal in sports, there's no reason to get outraged over it. And of course they don't want politics in their streams, that is why they're banning these casters and players.
---
I dont even remember how I got tyraande
---
That‚Äôs because the majority of their market is in China.
---
That said, if BlizzCon is a massive failure, it will definitely drop.
---
I honestly don't care what happens to Chinka/HK. However, the fact that AN AMERICAN OWNED COMPANY is sucking them this hard doesn't sit right with me.
---
Isn't Riot completely Chinese owned? I have a hard time believing Riot would respond better than Blizzard, but I'd be glad to be proven wrong.
---
I still love the game and Overwatch. I thought Blizzard‚Äôs response was fair when Blitzchung used their platform to state controversial political views. They were trying to keep a neutral ground.
---
I don‚Äôt really get the immense hate for Blizzard. I mean I do but I think it‚Äôs been blown out of proportion. I respect what Hong Kong‚Äôs people are doing but Blizzard shouldn‚Äôt really be punished for trying to keep a neutral ground.
---
yes, especially if this company is giving you a job and is treating you well
---
Maybe LGBT isn't controversial in America/Europe, but it is elsewhere in the world.
---
Right now the game is in the first testing phase. Closed beta comes out in early 2020, and the game launches later in 2020 with a mobile version. No mobile version throughout the testing phases and beta.
---
Bwahahaha! That‚Äôs hilarious!
---
Pretending to care about things for the sake of attention seeking is worse than not caring. 
---
Instead of making a big show about ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quitting this game I dont even pay for!‚Äù, let me know when you‚Äôre actually in the picket line in Hong Kong. Otherwise, maybe keep the hypocrisy to a minimum.:.
---
Is this a joke? Yea, I have some experience in the field. Randomization is a bitch and not something bot programs do. You need an external source for a program to truly randomize. 
---
I see you have zero fucking experience and have no clue what you're talking about. Keep talking out your ass. DAF.
---
I was noticing weird lag spikes thr other day and decided to run a wireshark analysis(I'm a total noob, don't judge pls). I noticed most of the activity was originating from a huawei device, so I turned off my phone. That didn't stop it, so I went a bit mad until I noticed my router is also huawei. Silly me.
---
He did violate the terms of service, regardless of his intention
---
Thanks for commenting. I have explained quite clearly in my reasoning paragraphs. People definitely have the right to argue, but they need to choose the right occasion to do so.
---
Except people are not educated enough to research candidates and simply vote party line. Meaning whoever the corrupt pricks decide they want to work with ends up elected.
---
Dude, what company would tell their face-of-the-company employees to talk about politics in their biggest marketing event?
---
It's the same reason why you don't see football casters going off about american elections in the middle of ESPN, it just doesn't make sense.
---
The whole Riot-is-censoring thing came from the casters abreviating the Hong Kong of a team name to just HK, which in the end wasn't on Riot's order, just them being conscious of that being a breach of the rules. Riot made a public statement saying "say Hong Kong, it's the correct name, just don't go around saying stuff about the movement because it's unrelated to worlds"
---
If blizzard reacted mildly to blitz, you can bet there'd be no controversy. The reaction came from the absurdly harsh punishment + the whole "puts blizzard in a controversial statement" bullshit their PR post said, which showed they didn't punish him for hijacking the interview for saying unrelated things, but because they wanted to suck on china's dick.
---
Yes, comrade
---
Tips from an internet stranger. I‚Äôll invest my life savings. Let you know how it goes
---
Check out Mythgard. It's basically Hearthstone with more depth, and a built in deck tracker (even on mobile!).
---
So I have mixed feelings about this, cause you‚Äôll remember everyone‚Äôs reaction at first to just the casters being fired. Amplify that by the whole production team? Should the person in charge of the stream have been fired too? I‚Äôd at first say yes, but then I go back to the three options I point out, and realize it was a situation that didn‚Äôt have a really good answer.
---
This. I believed from the start that they did not go into this decision easily. No option to handle this was the best.
---
Feel the same man. I played Hearthstone there and there but I grew very fond of Overreach since it released. I loved playing it everyday and just brought me joy. Now it just kind of sucks since I now have Overwatch on the switch that I just don't want to touch. I still think about my favorite mains but it just bothers me logging. Nothing feels the same anymore.
---
Does u/benbrode have a card game coming out soon? Seems like now would be a perfect time to make some announcements and capture some of these departing HS players.
---
Again even ignoring the actions of Riot themselves, you have to consider the fact that supporting Riot means supporting Tencent, who again, *directly participate in human rights violations in China.*
---
Do you understand how someone can put themselves in a position where two binary options are no longer the solution?  I want to be clear that on the following example the moral angle is irrelevant.  I'm not trying to equate cheating to what Blizzard has done; I just want the situational aspect.
---
Let's say I cheat on my wife.  Let's say she finds out and confronts me.  I fucked up, but now i have the option to own it, apologize, and try to fix it.  But I don't do that, instead I just deflect, ignore it, etc. 
---
Then a week later, I swoop in and say "Hey, look, I fucked up.  I want to be with you"
---
Would you be telling that woman "Heh, you don't like it when he denies it, you don't like it when he apologizes.  There's no winning with you, is there?"
---
Of course not.  His inaction for a week has tainted his response.  Most people would rightly assume he is just taking a different tack for selfish reasons.  The wait time *makes the response seem disingenuous and self-serving.*
---
Responses are always more complicated than "Do the thing or don't do the thing" and reducing them to that to try to point out some faux hypocrisy is to completely ignore the breach of trust.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, your entire post was incredibly well written. I was just asking the guy I replied to.
---
I have every card back and have done close to every daily quest since closed beta. I haven't opened Hearthstone in almost two weeks.
---
You could try YouTube
---
It's crashing a lot for me. But because I know instantly when it has crashed, I can usually close and re-open the game quickly enough to still take my turn.
---
I fund it most annoying with deckbuilding. Spend ages creating a deck, just choose the 30th card, and then it crashes and I lose the lot.
---
Indeed thats why i said they haven't fucked up for now. Riot also isnt as greedy as blizzard/Activision
---
&gt; You think too much as I'd this is actually going to go anything to Hearthstone. I mean the only real competition will come from whatever second dinner is making
---
this subreddit is crazy to me man, the fact that this is upvoted... you're saying no, the multinational multibillion dollar company isn't real competition, but the rag tag group of devs who have never published their own game are. just, wow
---
That's the thing, you don't fight the CCP trolls as they always debate in bad faith. What you should aim to do is win the audience. The goal of the trolls is to mislead the spectators. 
---
As long as you think you have managed to disarm the CCP trolls, that's all that matters.
---
I'm nearly sure that it was just a coincidence, but a pretty lucky one. The game had to be in the making for a while since it's already in a playable state (they definitely didn't start making it last week). Yesterday we had League of Legends 10th anniversary livestream, and I'm quite sure that they planned to announce it then anyway, because it was a perfect opportunity.
---
Definitely One Night in Valeera...
---
The new 100win portrait? It looks like new character to me :(
---
Ah, cool, so if it was legal to keep slaves then that would be okay as long as you treated them well?
---
You mention that the original contract spelled out specific consequences for actions that damage Blizzard‚Äôs image. Technically that‚Äôs true, but the actual punishment applied exceeded the listed consequences anyway.
---
 Yes, there was also a provision that allowed Blizzard to add any additional punishment they see fit ‚Äî but at this point you‚Äôve moved beyond the argument that they HAD to do it this way to stay in policy. They didn‚Äôt have to do it this way. They chose to.
---
There‚Äôs also a provision that says the entire thing is only defined in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion anyway, so suppose they chose not to invoke this provision and instead gave Blitzchung a 1-week suspension. Anarchy is not unleashed, no one assumes you can say whatever you want with no consequences, and no one says you overreacted due to Chinese pressure. Win-win!
---
I get pride pins, but are disaster relief contributions really something political? Isn't that just associated with human decency?
---
You‚Äôve hit the nail on the head, and with China having a growing middle class and population, while many counties in the west are having their middle class and population decrease, it‚Äôs not hard to see why a company would seek to do business with China.
---
*I'm* the boss now
---
It was lol. Sometimes I'm actually scared to play a minion against a shaman opponent because of mogu mutate.
---
here is some text from wikipedia to the eye patch, but you are free to inform you on other sites:
---
*More recent medical texts have often referred to the eye patch as a "pirate's patch" and writing in the Minnesota Academy of Sciences Journal in 1934, Charles Sheard of the Mayo foundation, pointed out that by "wearing a patch (The pirate's patch) over one eye, it will keep the covered eye in a state of readiness and adaptation for night vision".[13] This technique was explored during WWII by institutes such as the United States Navy.*
---
besides from this, i think you are the person who implies stuff. yah she has an little scar down the eye, but there are so many people with such scars in the world who can still see, so why should i imply, that this scar makes her blind?
---
Their squashing of speech in this instance shows me that, while they may not directly support communism necessarily, they are willing to be AGAINST democracy, freedom and human rights in favor of money. That‚Äôs condemnation enough for me. You don‚Äôt have to be holding the smoking gun if you gave someone a bullet knowing what they would use it for.
---
Appreciate the thorough response Emi. 
---
As much as it pains me I might hang onto them purely to increase chances of getting other, more useful cards. 
---
I'm trying my hand at arena and seem to be doing okay, 6, 5 &amp; 4 wins so far and of course opening Uldum packs from there so might bide my time and pray to RNGesus I get Amet from there.
---
The squashing of freedom of speech by punishing a violator of their terms of service?
---
Instead of treating Chinese players liberally and reasonably as democratic standards demand, they decided to treat the rest of the world using authoritarian regimes principles.  
---
Blizzard had two options. To turn back to democracy, or double down to authoritarianism.
---
Well yeah, we know the project exists. Tom Cannon said as much at Evo. That's why I said it's "basically a rumor." I was exaggerating, but it turns out maybe not by much from the stream. What they showed looks like a pre-alpha reskin of Rising Thunder. Tom was on Twitter late last night trying to temper expectations about how far along the team is. Compounding that, Seth Killian jumping ship just after the official announcement raises some serious red flags.
---
When Riot has a new design lead, maybe I'll grow a little optimistic. But for now, I don't have much faith.
---
Wrong forum ?
---
[removed]
---
Imagine playing any kind of competetive now lol
---
Out of all the ignorant criticism in this thread, this is probably the dumbest. Every modern game is a knock-off in some respect of other games. Dota was a knock-off and so was HS of MtG.
---
It says a lot about the people trafficking here that this was upvoted as much as it was.
---
Yea Guldan ain't working for me either. Been a few days now. Worked fine at first
---
And just because they deliberately halt any sort of attention to controversy on *their own* product, does not mean they are against democracy. They are against negative attention, and if it is subject to their own product, they are within their rights to halt it
---
It is also useful in web development as well.
---
You didn't even bother to take the 0.2 seconds to read the title, did ya?
---
I'm not surprised by the mental state you have arrived at given your spectacular ability to misinterpret anything that doesn't fit your agenda.
---
Yo blizzard, please go commit sodoku in a blizzard
---
Sincerely, the community.
---
Ok thanks so much can I still craft those cards
---
I'm not mad at all actually. Just using to colorful language to highlight the fact that you're an idiot and obnoxious
---
Also from that same post:
---
&gt;‚ÄúIn the years before advanced medicine and surgery, **eyepatches were common for people who had lost an eye**. They were particularly prevalent among members of dangerous occupations, such as soldiers and sailors who could lose an eye in battle. While stereotypically associated with pirates, there is **no evidence to suggest the historical accuracy of eye patch wearing pirates** before several popular novels of the 19th century‚Äù
---
And 
---
&gt;‚ÄùRahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalahimah, once the most popular pirate in the Persian Gulf, was also the first to wear an eyepatch **after losing an eye in battle.**‚Äù
---
&gt;‚ÄùThe proposal that pirates may have worn an eyepatch so that one eye would be pre-adjusted to below-deck darkness was tested in an episode of MythBusters in 2007 and found to be plausible, but **without any recorded historical precedent**.‚Äù
---
So yes. No good evidence. The scar is a clear indication of the hint of a loss of an eye
---
Not the squashing of freedom of speech, the specific speech in question (and also banning the hosts of that stream that had done nothing wrong) in favor of Chinese money. Again, well within their rights. But if they‚Äôre in such a vice grip in China that they can‚Äôt have one person say one thing against China (which they are, I again bring up the NBA who are currently in some shit for ONE comment made on twitter), this will only go further with them.
---
This is pretty well spot on. I doubt my argument will sway any in the, Blizzard must make a Anti-China stand, my goal here is to simply help try and explain why Blizzard did what they did.
---
I have mixed feelings about those clauses, cause yes, they allow Blizzard a broad protection from a multitude of problems, but it also opens them up to a lot of trouble. Like I said, the contract is quite asinine.
---
Man if the vita had the support the switch has... I wish Sony does the same thing for the ps5, I just perfect playing in handheld in my bed, but for the majority of people it can give them the option of playing on the TV. This reason alone was how I was able to finish my first zelda ever, and thank God because its my favorite game of all time
---
I assume you feel the same way about Nestle sentencing people to death by siphoning their water for pennies and selling it for billions in profit, or the sweatshops with young children that make your phone and shoes, or the media that fought for the war in Iraq on false pretenses and caused the deaths of millions of civilians. I bet you boycott all those too, and I‚Äôm sure you gave a shit about China massacring the Uygurs or any of their other actual human rights offenses before it could be used as a prop to criticize them for Hong Kong.
---
And if you didn‚Äôt well you‚Äôre just lazy with no morals or ethics and an absolute bastard of a person, aren‚Äôt you?
---
And now I‚Äôm going to receive a barrage of downvotes, because you can‚Äôt see that theres no difference between any of these other massive humanitarian issues that companies you support every single fucking day actively support and are involved in and Blizzard and Hong Kong.
---
Politics isn't so black and white; if you're in favour of democracy it does not mean you will attack communism, or vice versa. It's the malicious intent of individuals who bend political views to fit their offensive agenda, not the politics themselves. So to say Blizzard might be against democracy because they might be for communism is a bold statement, in my opinion
---
I think the point is you want to continue to be outraged and are searching for reasons, taking a week to decide on punishment is perfectly normal. Blizzard and blizzchung both said they were too hasty with him.
---
Commenting solely to make the algorithms push this farther up people's front page, awesome post.
---
Honestly Rend could be good
---
Yes you can!
---
Game always had some crashing here and there but nothing worth complaining about. I'm on a Moto G5 Plus so figured my phone was not the greatest. But after the newest update I can not play at all without it crashing or hanging or super slow animations and I can't get my full turn in. I uninstalled completely and re-installed but same deal. I deleted the game. Not sure if or when I'll install again. I even tried emailing the support email listed on Google Play Store, but that bounced an auto-reply that that email isn't checked anymore.
---
WoW (not similar to EQ at all), Diablo, Warcraft, Starcraft (well you could call it a WC knockoff), HS at least is a knockoff of a physical game and not a PC game, other than that they only continued their IPs, only new one was OW which was a knockoff but a good one at least
---
Well first, I care for the issue, but I do not have any ties to Hong Kong. It is not important to me. I have no obligations to support Hong Kong, but I do not stand for whats happening there, and Im not happy with how Blizzard stands with them. It doesnt take much effort to upvote comments, but cutting off the financial support i gave to Blizzard is not nothing. Im not claiming to be an activist. Im simply doing whats in my immediate reach.
---
I didn't notice it until you pointed it out and now I can't stop thinking about it. What is the thought process behind it? Do they want you to build a connection with the card?
---
&gt;THis is one of the most underated comments ever
---
They aren't figuring it out due to flaws with the random number generator itself. It would take centuries to detect a pattern in a good generator.
---
Next time post a sloppy photoshop meme that's been reposted 100x already. You will be swimming in karma.
---
What season are you even talking about? NALCS stats show only 86 champs played?
---
Yeah this is true. Once the deadline is past, the card packs will no longer be available to buy (except from other players in the new chests released today) and you will only be able buy cards from other players. The cards also will not be changeable after the deadline has past, which for this set (Genesis) is October 29th.
---
Gotta love retroactive bullshit.
---
It was a joke...
---
I will agree that Blizzard may have gone a bit overboard with the hosts themselves, but it seems like they're just wanting to avoid controversy desperately in favour of business; not a personal vendetta against communism or those people. And yes, western society depends heavily on asian and specifically chinese markets for global trade so any expressions against the government of those partners could risk losing those partners.
---
The Supreme Court is currently debating if it's okay to fire or evict people just for being gay. Don't know that I'd consider that "hardly controversial."
---
GAMERZ RIZE UP!!!!111
---
But I will need dragons and he kills only legendary minions, so I‚Äôm most situations it‚Äôs just 7/8/4
---
&gt;Well, LGBT is hardly controversial anymore,
---
...arguable, especially in China.
---
Keep telling yourself that Champ
---
I agree their initial reaction was too harsh, the prize money though was specifically stated in the contract. However, I‚Äôm glad they went against that, and gave him back his winnings. The casters, and this will get me some flack, but I was fine with even the initial judgement. Cause they were actual Blizzard employees.
---
I don't understand what that has to do with anything. Tencent has been dominant for a decade or more now. Are we suddenly boycotting it because of Blitzchung? Because that almost certainly had nothing to do with Tencent, which only has a 5% share, and everything to do with Blizzard. Ironically, the Tencent-owned companies in the West haven't done anything as egregious to protect Chinese interests as what Blizzard did on its own initiative.
---
Blizzard has pretty directly and evidently supported the Chinese government simply for the sake of catering to the chinese market
---
Tencent has had a pretty rocky relationship with the Chinese government in the past ~2 years, and to implicate all of its subsidiaries(a list that also includes supercell, bluehole and epic) as terrible companies simply because it's a chinese corporation is laughable
---
No, they didn't have any pro players breaking the rules. But it's pretty obvious their games cater to a chinese audience
---
Wizards Digital Games Studio? I don't see why they wouldn't have a pricing department.
---
Maybe they just conceded because they had the 200 gold quest and wanted the gold quick?
---
Tencent is the same company that suspended NBA broadcasts in China last week, and Riot Games literally just warned their casters and pro players not to get political during broadcasts.
---
The ‚Äúnegative‚Äù attention of allowing a Hong Kong native to try to bring attention to their plight? Blizzard WANTS to be an e-sport. Well, sports and politics have been intertwined for a long time. The Olympics in Germany in 1936 where Jesse Owens competed? Political. Kaepernick kneeling? Political. World Cup, ? EXTREMELY political. You want to be a sport, you‚Äôre gonna have to accept the baggage that comes with that and understand that athletes are going to use their platform. 
---
I‚Äôve agreed several times they were within their rights. But within your rights does NOT mean the same thing as being right.
---
I can't tell if you're joking. Yes, every company that is either a part of Tencent or doing business with them should also be on the shit list. That includes reddit. Not sure why this is laughable.
---
League had +-20k viewers when TFT came out, same thing is happening here. LoL streamer checked out TFT, now TFT streamers are checking out legends of runeterra
---
How did you manage to forget the eye color...
---
What's important to realize here is that while yes, Blizzard's choices after this happened were limited, this was a trap of their own devising that they've spent years working themselves into.
---
Blizzard could, at any point in the past, have chosen not to be so desperate to horn their way into the Chinese market. They could at any point have chosen to pull out and invest their attentions elsewhere. But, instead, Blizzard have explicitly and deliberately chosen a market strategy that involves kowtowing to a communist totalitarian dictatorship that routinely abducts and murders its own citizens.
---
No one forced Blizzard into this trap, least of all Blitzchung. They painted themselves into this corner and this incident is just the spark that set the powder keg they've been sitting on alight. It's a shitty situation for Blizzard, but that's no reason to be sympathetic to it. They can get off the damn powder keg and I'm sure the majority would applaud them for it if they did decide to distance themselves from China.
---
Ironic comment is ironic.
---
The event ending doesn't coincide with the wild cards rotating back out. That won't be until next expansion, likely early december.

Is beauty also not part of her character? Her having flowing blonde hair makes her more attractive right?...but it's not relevant to her strength? or her big blue eyes, or hourglass hip line...

---
if we actually care about \_human rights\_ we should only be talking about option 1.  everything else in your post is talking about economics, not human rights.
---
neutrality is fine until you encroach on human rights.
---
&gt;Option 1, another catchphrase I see people throwing around is the ‚ÄúStreisand Effect.‚Äù Where if only Blizzard had let the statement go, no one would have ever noticed. Hypothetically, maybe. Realistically, wasn‚Äôt going to happen. A Pro-Hong Kong statement made on an official stream originating from Taiwan? I highly doubt it‚Äôd have flown under the radar, it‚Äôs too perfect of a combination to make China chafe.
---
and?  from the point of view of \_human rights\_ China \_should\_ be chafing.  and a few dollars should be sacrificed by Blizzard
---
You don‚Äôt accept gay marriage?
---
There are certain forums for that.
---
"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity." I think this applies here. If Blitzchang said "Hail Hitler" and the casters supported that messege then the initial ban of a year and withholding winnings would probably be seen as an adequate punishment because Hitler is a shit person to everyone. However, its still technically a political statement no more 'political' than "Free Hong Kong" they just sit on two completely opposite sides of the public support spectrum. 
---
So one could say that the ban being lightened is actually a statement saying "we actually think some political statements deserve less punishment than others based on how publicly acceptable that political position is." And that's not exactly impartial either.

The problem isn't the buckets or the lack thereof. The problem is that these cards were designed around the basic and classic set being available. 
---
Arena was *boring* with buckets because it made the draft phase autopilot and that meant everyone knew what everyone else was likely to have.
---
Decks now are unpredictable it's just they swing from "terrible" to "mediocre" because it's more about whether you went 1 drop 2 drop 3 drop than what your drops were because there's basically zero spell removal in the format.
---
Fuck you blizzard.

Not in the US

Wow this is gorgeous. This would have been a ridiculous new portrait

The lawyers might have given advice not to confiscate prize money. But that's about as much as they're going to do. You don't hire lawyers to take over business decisions.

You think Tracer being gay is political? Is a character get being straight political? Are you against that too?
---
Priest, Mass Hysteria.
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs unfair.
---
By that logic everyone is indirectly supporting that regime unless you practice total abstinence from any goods or services that were produced in or in collaboration with China or even do so much as offer their domestic goods or services to citizens of China.
---
Further, your empathy for the people of Hong Kong matters nothing if it is expressed only in your choice of video game titles. Give me a fucking break.

Yep, last updates were a mess.

I gave up and uninstalled :(

You're putting words in my mouth. Cool it.

Dragon Quest XI has been exactly the heroin I was looking for.
---
I've tried it, and I just couldn't get in to it. The game mechanics just didn't interest me. HotS was fun because I had a group of friends I'd play a few games with just about every night, and we all enjoyed the team aspect of the game. That being said I'm probably gonna take a stab at it again because I am jonsing for a MOBA to play on the regular.

Now I'm reminded of the parody commercial of the guy slapping all the people at a back yard BBQ.

The fact that you had to ask proves my point. Clearly op lives in a liberal bubble where equal rights for LGBTQ+ folk in the US happened already.

Oh god, they really meant forever...
---
Or you just play Dota and play all the characters for free anyway.
---
Sounds like a personal problem.
---
The issue of adopting different policies for Chinese markets it global problem with all industries.
---
That being said... I don't want video games to be about politics. No one is saying this shots not important but put your dam pitchforks down when a video game company asks that game commentary should be about what transpired in the game not in the rest of the world. For me it's an escape and I don't want irl shit to encroach on it.
---
"Official" 3rd party is kind of an oxy moron. If you had 5 friends come over your house to play hearthstone for 10000 dollars that isn't an official tournament but blizzard sure as hell can't do anything about it.

Honestly same as a lot of people in the thread, just also include Hots.

Yeah I believe their latest update upped the minimum supported Android versions.

Funny how it's days after the fact they're only now saving face and banning "with consistency" (even though their stance on politics is inconsistent with gay pride events, which is now obvious it's just to seem like a Woke Brand and being pro gay rights is beneficial). Don't be fooled

What version of Android are you using? I'm stuck on 8 but havent been having many issues.

I mean y‚Äôall should get off reddit too since China has investment in it. Probably should throw away ur phone and ur clothes while you‚Äôre at it.
---
Right here with you buddy. I'm boycotting all blizzard games until I see a change to my liking. Which could never happen - and I'm OK with that. I'm OK never playing Overwatch again - never touching Hearthstone or buying another pack. I'm OK with never playing Diablo 3 again, or the eventual Diablo 4. I will stick to my principles here, because they're so much more important than games. There comes a time in an escalating conflict where you have to take a stance, you have to draw the line somewhere. 
---
For me this whole situation just reeks of the NFL's handling of players kneeling during the national anthem. I don't watch football either now out of protest. Blizzard reacted so heavy handedly that they've created their own PR nightmare and alienated a large player base here in the US and abroad. 
---
I'm not going to judge anyone else for their personal decision to continue playing or not. That's everyone's personal decision to make and theirs alone. But I know I feel dirty looking at the HS icon on my phone. I don't even bother starting the launcher now anymore at home. It's just Steam and the Epic game launcher now, with the occasional GoG launcher.

---
This is what you call "Between a rock and a hard place.". 
---
The **WESTERN** community seems to be basically asking Blizzard to cut all ties with China in a demonstration in favor of the HK cause (which most of them don't know what it truly is) and that they still value this vague concept of Freedom. 
---
To me it all of this seems hypocritical, like if suddenly the community realized Blizzard doesn't just make your favorite games but is also a business and seek their best interest in financial expansion and stability. Thus the actions taken against people that diverted the focus from their games. Blizzard never wanted to be dragged into this conflict because they are not a political party, they simply make games. They simply took actions against that which violated their rules but the community sees this as censorship.
---
Even in fan art she's nerfed :(
---
That's all I wanted to know. Thanks!
---
There are quite a number of rotten apples who manage LGBT and they are the reason why its controversial. If LGBT denounce them then we wouldn't be here.
---
I‚Äôd agree with you, if the two of them hadn‚Äôt been giggling about it. That to me made it sound like, to them, it wasn‚Äôt such a big deal.
---
I would argue, explaining that you wanted to uphold Blizzard‚Äôs policy on political statements, and refusing to take either an active role or participate in the interview would have also been professional.
---
yes
---
Blizzard is running out of feet to shoot.
---
~~i thought it was a Goose Game reference but TIL~~
---
You're the only one talking about some "fear of China" here. 
---
That must be some commie fanboy speak for "dislike of a government that systematically commits crimes on its own citizens" or at least a very weak attempt of a Riot fanboy to defend a new game by their favorite company, that just so happens to be made by 100% Tencent employees.
---
You choose which one you are, but since it's pointless talking to both of these types, please go and talk to someone else.

Thank you! :)
---
Love the lighting on this piece, very well done

can someone explain to me how the mechanic works for that card
---
Use international GMT time. Reddit is not USA
---
Absolutely amazing my dude, I find it much better than the 1000 wins artwork, it really has some movement going on.

Lol your still playing this trash game its your own fault bud give your balls a tug

The new hero portraits dont work. I selected any portrait i got as favourite but ingame you see the golden old ones...

---
4000 hours? those are rookie numbers!
---
Well the lawyers would have drafted the contracts, so they were likely consulted before handing out any punishment (you would hope)
---
People think that there should be a consequence for sharing political speech on a hearthstone stream. Atleast enough of a consequence to deter it otherwise it won't stop the actions.
---
I am never taking wisdomball again. Had a paladin deck with 3 sound the bells and -2 spellcost anomaly on heroic heist. I'm at the final boss ch 5 and even mulligan into sound the bells, but no early drops. First dude I plays gets turned into majordomo from the wisdomball because aRen'T LegEnDarIeS gReAT!? It gets killed before I have priority and next turn I get blasted for my 8 total health. I've never ragequit the app harder.
---
Not sure what you are on about. I'm simply saying I beat the new brawl in 10 mins and got those 2 golden cards. And there's no way I can go back in time to take those screen shots for you
---
Same, kind of annoying when it ruins your whole run.
---
\&gt;  if it's popular, they will change their ideas about tons of RNG in the game. 
---
What? Explain the logic behind this, as I dont see it. The use of RNG is a design choice, to let noobs win vs better players sometimes. It's deliberate
---
So there is NO 30 minute reward?
---
Obviously.
---
To me, it might work but only against Blizzard. If anything, Blizzard‚Äôs competition is more than happy to let everyone dog pile on them, and slip on by without being a target as well. Just look at Epic trying to win brownie points.
---
This is why I find it hard to be critical of only Blizzard, and expect it to impact more than just Blizzard.
---
There is no way to know this.
---
A fair number of people consider it bm and a fair number don't as well. Is it worth it to use it in such circumstances? I'd say no but everyone has to decide for themselves
---
I usee Lunara only because Malfurion isn't Golden yet... Malfurion also has better emotes.
---
But now I have Elise... which does looks cool. Not sure if Golden or 1000 Malfurion can beat it. I think Malfurion's Emotes might still be better.
---
Quite possibly, but I‚Äôd have to do more research to give a better response. Though I do thank you for the conversation.
---
Basically it's a tresure card that you pick after you win a couple of times. The next run you do of the brawl, your deck will start with this card (remember FOREVER). If you do the run with hagatha you can use her card to trasform all of your minions in your deck with BFFs. The next run will start with all the copies of BFFs you have acquired (eith a max cap of 20). When you play this minion it will combine with all the copies you have in your hand and deck. So basically a 1mana 20/20 if you did what i wrote. And you will end the brawl in no time
---
Wow, way to assume all the haters are doing the same thing, shill.
---
Meanwhile, I am over here, completely naked because I have forgone clothes, growing my own crops, and made my own iPhone using american metals and the synapses of defeated political foes.
---
Get on my level, protesters.
---
I offer my two cents:
---
Apoliticality is often executed politically in reality. Centrism is still a political stance.    
---
And the more influence you have as a person, a company, a people, the more representative you become, and the harder it will be to refrain from showing the direction you desire in politics.
---
See it this way: If your mentality is that you want things to stay the same, that is conservatism, not apoliticality. The latter is only achieved through a complete and direct statement of "I don't care about politics either way." and enforcing said mentality strictly by not punishing people for showing political stances. 
---
Blizzard didn't firmly stand upon neutrality. They were progressive in one set of actions, and conservative in others. And at such a dissonance, some people balk.
---
This fixed it for me. Thanks.
---
FREE HONG KONG, or these poor kids in africa who are in way worse circumstances and are dying every day but who cares about them right? FREE HONG KONG THO
---
If I‚Äôm reading the contract correctly, the issue of taking the prize money away was specified. I remember that being a point of contention for many.
---
Ive been building up to that deck for the entire expansion, dusting everything i didnt need for it, cuz I was content playing quest rogue and quest shaman (those were the decks I have) and I got impatient, but found quest rogue more fun than quest shaman, so I dusted my quest shaman cards cuz I was playing more rogue anyway.
---
Logically, the world in which Blizzard quietly covers over Blitzchung's pro-HK statement is less bad than the world in which Blizzard vigorously denounces the pro-HK statement.  The former is less extreme and should receive a less extreme response.  But you're right that there's no way to know for sure.
---
capitalism is only compatible with human beings as long as there is a morality that regulates it.  blind pursuit of money over human rights is incompatible with the humans who are the eventual recipients of this money.
---
pure capitalism will always lead to disaster.
---
blizzard could have chosen to self regulate itself by standing up for the HK protesters.  the ability to protest is a critical human right.
---
Afaik, I personally fall in a category where I want to have a casual experience like Hearthstone with more complex mechanics like MTG:A. But I don't know if it's a big market or limited to me and a few others.
---
I'd never even seen it until a couple days ago despite playing (and watching a lot of Kripp playing) since it first released. Now I've seen it twice. It's weird.
---
Does this mean that everyone who's supported Hong Kong or Blitzchung is up for a six month ban, or just those who did so on camera?
---
But Blizzard's policy doesn't state that they don't allow political messages.  It states that they don't allow messages which cause disrepute or damage the image of the competitor or Blizzard.  Covering up the interview could be seen as damaging Blizzard's image, potentially, thus leading to culpability on the part of the interviewer who didn't do their job.
---
Exactly lol. Might as well retire my run now.
---
What if I'm a person who does know what's happening on Hong Kong, I don't have a vague concept of "freedom" and I believe any company has the right to make decisions based on merit and not fall back on rules they created themselves? Am I still a hypocrite? Idk man, sounds like you're making a whole lot of assumptions here and your whole argument is based on those assumptions being correct. 
---
If any person or company says "don't talk about XYZ," and you do, so they punish you...idk what else to call that other than censorship. 
---
I also don't buy into the argument that any business is absolved of responsibility simply because they were making a good financial decision. The two aren't mutually exclusive.
---
I wonder how people would've felt if the views expressed were anti-abortion or Pro-trump.  How much you agree with a view shouldn't change your opinion on whether corporations should be allowed to prohibit a message.  Should cashiers be allowed to spout political statements at you?
---
And communism is a boogeyman word used by liberals &amp; ancaps alike to refer to every dictatorship they don't approve of when it ceases to be useful to do so.

Why do all new games have to be magic clones?  Don't we have enough games where the goal is to turn mana into minions with atk/hp and wails on an opponents life total?
---
It's easy: Every time you play a minion, one free speech dies.
---
I felt like this. *felt*. I honestly think reflecting on this situation that the banning was actually indicative of a severe tournament director that freaked out. Not because of "China" but because of his own incompetence dealing with something "unexpected". This person probably didn't even understand what the Hong Kong protest was or even understood what relationships China had. 
---
"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
---
Lol no they didn‚Äôt
---
That's dumb though.  The whole reason I want to play this is OP class combinations that I can't play any other time of the year.
---
And this is the Hearthstone sub.
---
I got it pretty consistently in my games with Brann. Saving it for egg works well since most of the bosses in this mode have small minions. I OTKED the final boss head on like T9/T10 just killing off my own King Krushes and summoning more.

Naturalise?
---
Then finders keepers no?
---
Ah well I was not aware of that in the books. That hardly qualifies her as being dominantly fire and needed to be depicted as one.
---
Mostly yes but I really don't like the design of the cards. They look too cheap and remind me of shitty card games. It contrasts a lot with the polished graphics in the rest of the client.
---
It's because the palm looks enormous. The angle you drew the pinky/ring/middle finger makes me think I shouldn't be able to see that much of the palm and thumb. If you imagine the width of her palm judging by where her pinky bone is and where you see her thumb, the palm just seems insanely too big. But please, don't take this the wrong way. You have amazing talent!
---
Looks awesome, is anyone else reminded of the new Elise skin the way she's posing?
---
Good, with the way you play you I'd rather you weren't in the game.
---
Seems fair.
---
Also no.
---
I feel the same way. I uninstalled as well. I used to watch YouTube videos and twitch streams of it pretty often, but haven‚Äôt watched a single one since. Dirty is the exact way I feel when I think about watching or playing it again
---
jesus, when the 15 year old game brings more people than current wow does, it says something about the game. Are you actually mentally handicaped? I love WoW, but i don't like how current wow developed.
---
If it‚Äôs so predictable, then why does Blizzard have to change their motto?
---
You make no sense.
---
Probably need to think through your arguments a bit more.
---
Just saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone in my analysis‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it right; the Chinese aren‚Äôt alone in their analysis either; does that make a case for them being right?
---
Stop your pseudo-intellectual bullshitting, and opinionated assumptions,
---
Being pictured as using a spell doesn't mean that this is this characters main trait. Anduin is partly showed as shadow priest in his portrait and in all of his history he's been in shadow Form like 2 times.
---
Ok your right. It's only valid if everything was hand given to me.
---
 Still getting used to thinking like a toddler
---
I never said anything of the sort.  It's not about 'supporting' or 'not supporting' LGBT, Libertarians would just consider the matter of who they employed or rented their property to as none of the governments business and being forced to employ or sell to someone as a form of oppression.
---
As long as you're confident you'll never play Wild, then yeah. I'd start with the least useful epics and legendaries first, to get the amount of dust you need for a craft.
---
That‚Äôs what balance is if they do good job we will see more decks
---
Im not sure I aimed this at you, personally.    
---
More of like an addition or extra thought to your list.  Your list seems kinda one sided to me.
---
Hearthstone strictly follows lore
---
They‚Äôd be fine if they withdrew the punishment for Blitzchung and the casters completely. Or if they never fucked up in the first place.
---
This looks sweet! Reminds me of Chandra from MTG, which is good thing!
---
Meanwhile, I still play HS and OW without a care in the world. I won't EVER let such silly things stand in the way. Sure, China is EVIL. But come on, do you honestly think you can somehow topple PRC with a simple boycott? Get real for once...

Already one to many

&gt; Communists in absolute denial and will be in denial forever because they want another bloody revolution to install more authoritarian communist governments all over the world.
---
No, it's because they specifically do not want that to be the result. If they wanted more authoritarian governments, then they would say "these governments are communist and we should institute more of them."
---
The point of saying "these aren't communist" is to say "let's absolutely not do that when we work towards communist revolution."
---
Your post literally says that it's not communist. Its current economic system is a socialist market economy aka state capitalism. Even if you think that "state capitalism" isn't a real thing, it's reductive to just say "communism" when clearly there are distinctions to be drawn.
---
This isn't about hiding anything. This is about not being reductive and actually thinking about the words we use as well as the ways they've been used and misused by others. Stop being lazy with your thinking just because it's easy.
---
You really are smarter than the rest of us, aren‚Äôt you?
---
I‚Äôm so glad you came into my thread to show me the light.
---
Those typical Resurrect Priest has pretty much no chance of winning against N'Zoth Rogue. I know very well since I was on the receiving end for a good while lol.
---
Literally got 40min 15sec bcz app was bugging out and had to exit after every boss because treasures &amp; card boxes wouldn't load
---
Not gonna run it again for a generous mummy lol
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre just a dramatic whiner.
---
I don't hate it but I've still got qualms with it.
---
Main thing I dislike is that the other portraits go a different direction with the character fantasy while Rexxar is still just a normal hunter dude.
---
What most people are on about is that the portrait is super cartoony and kinda an awkward style. It's bright and soft.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Does Price pool mean Prize pool? Or do I pay 75 euro to auto win?
---
Yeah - like beating up a retarded, one-armed toddler and then bragging to your bros that you "really showed him whos boss".  What a joke.  Of course, legend means NOTHING whatsoever in this game anymore.  Not with 100% moron-proof decks like Shaman, Priest, etc out there.  
---
Good job though.  \*\* Golf clap \*\*
---
And it displays his maturity in accepting responsibility for your actions as well as respecting rules in place. It was all pretty simple actually
---
They do it out of the negative sense... they "if you dont support us there shall be consequences" types
---
The title thing? I force close the app and restart.
---
That wasn't a real question, just wanted to know if he was able to, because if you do that, you will win in under 10 minutes.
---
&gt;Coincidence? I think not!
---
You just showed why.  Two teams... one puts up a pro-LGBT the other says "there are only 2 genders"
---
Ban both or ban neither... if you do anything other than that then you're a gargantuan hypocrite
---
It used be really good in mill decks. Because you can start a lot of draw and end your turn, and the animations would contiune through the enemies turn. Idk if they ever fixed that. Or if it was intended.
---
But essentially the animations wasted the players 15secs.
---
Wtf are you talking about ? Learn to read. He says that zephrys would be 9 mana very rarely, yet they introduced Thaurissan which makes that occurrence very common. So there's a problem with their logic yeah. How hard is that to understand ?
---
They're people.  People should always be against the imprisonment and torture of other people.
---
Valeera being a pirate is fucking awesome.
---
Dust immediately after BMing everyone you can.
---
Reno's HP seems pretty spicy against zoo / swarm decks
---
Wow.... Really put it into perspective for us. Interesting read and yea new voice lines would have been cool but boy 14 languages?! 9 heroes?! 38 lines??? GOLLY
---
Mine get crash almost all the time too, and it need update regulary (2 o 3 times per week).   
---
Anothe thing is it take so long to start the game (even more if i see data mobile) and I dont understand why bacause it's low low data consuming.
---
Jaina hasn't been a fire mage. Uther isn't Lightforged. Rexxar doesn't have a traveling petting zoo.
---
The 1000 win portraits are crazy variants of our heroes, some are what if scenarios and others are when they're at peak power.
---
I got my Gold TB Illidan the week they redid his voice lines. I wish he was viable.
---
What was?
---
Welcome to Santa's naughty list.
---
Pretty sure Kripp made a statement...
---
And I know Kibler did.
---
yeah, while your at it boycotting stop using reddit too because 5 percent of it is owned by tencent. Also maybe sell your computer and all the things you own because many of them are manufactured in china.
---
thats part of his claim that people across the political spectrum may agree with the notion of firing lgbt people based solely on their sexual orientation
---
Misha is the hero in hots, Rexxar just follows around like a good pet.
---
Lol even her hero power in hearthstone is a fireball.  Mages in Warcraft lore are not limited in the elements they can use.  They are technically not even using elements, they are using arcane magic to cast spells.  The magic users that deal directly with the elements in Warcraft are called shamans.
---
I hear a lot of people complaining about the voices, but weren't we all asking for just a platinum border for 1000 wins? This is pretty much that but even fancier.
---
(I want Valeera to talk like a pirate perpetually when you have her pirate portrait though)
---
Looks really professional!
---
The Blizzard rules say "social and political."  Also no I don't think lgbt is political.  Neither is the Hong Kong matter.  Human Rights are not politics.
