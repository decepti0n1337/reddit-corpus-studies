Never play another game again Kappa
---
---
---
I really like the idea of giving your hero divine shield. I also like giving priest shadowform cards. I don't like Twilight Mistress because the requirement is just unfun, but adding shadowform to hand is neat.
---
Nerd
---
How’s that? Guy is tormented by Charge. The counters to charge are taunt, armour, and heal. Those are his solutions.
---

---
What OP is mad about is that his preferred deck can’t deal with Charge. It doesn’t include enough taunt, armour, or heal. And if he can’t adapt that deck - that is to say if he does not know how to replace parts of his deck or all of his deck with cards that address Charge - then he’s not a good player. Alternatively he isn’t willing to do those things. In that case, he’s a bad player by choice.
---
Well done! I was a bit annoyed a while ago when I couldn't do the same, had to start from 5 and did not get to legend in time to try for a 66 or 666:  https://imgur.com/a/MfLcioh
---
And a few moments later... I MISSED IT! http://imgur.com/a/9MlhimL
---
Thanks! I use Adobe Photoshop
---
Leeroy is a classic card so it will never be rotated unless it goes to the hall of fame.
---
I would keep it, personally, it is a very good card when weapons are popular in the meta (right now). Zilliax isn't worth the craft IMO since it rotates soon, Leeroy is always good.
---
I had forgotten just how much fun it is. Glad I rebooted it wild style.
---
And still not legend :o
---
The real mind games start when you figure out that you can split-screen Hearthstone *and* Reddit in vertical phone
---
Not all start of game effects are OP. Baku/genn were OP for their effect and made degenerate from the start of game. But imagine if Baku/genn also upgraded your opponents hero power. You can argue it’s better for yourself because you create your deck around taking advantage of it, but really it would not be overpowered.
---
Still better than quest priest
---
that's bad luck man :/ unfortunately going right now for rank 5 is gonna be hard, everyone wants to get there before the season ends so there are a lot of try hards. I've been on rank 5 for 5 days just winning and losing constantly without even hitting rank 4. It's crazy right now
---
It is what it is :) hope you get better matches soon!
---
thanks man :(
---
Depends, if you running whelp this hand is god, the anubisath isn’t that great because there is almost nothing to buff.
---
Gala highlander rogue is super fun!
---
Commenting again cause no one showed up, BlackChocobo#11114 on NA.
---
I'll show, than you go first.
---
yea, same thing happening to me... i feel like im in rank 5 already, not even getting winstreaks anymore. win 1, lose 1, win 2, lose 1, win 1, lose 2 and so on...
---
baku and genn were conditional start of game effects. you had to axe your deck for it. so you certainly gave and took there. the winrate bump rogues, especially miracle type rogues have with going second should tell you enough as to why one should be careful printing this card. and i haven't even begun to talk about combos here.
---
I love Mia like the next guy but come on. Keep this stuff out of this subreddit.
---
I seen so much people keep saying haha murloc divine shield. I'm 7200 and all I encounter are mech and demons. Demons being extremely strong midgame that weaker tribe get beat fast.
---
Murloc need to last until 6 but it's hard.
---
I almost did it with triple bran with mech combo by selling all my mech and going murloc.
---
Honestly big minion is strong now due to poisonous murloc out of the factor and maxenna being tier 6.
---
Rn the meta in 7000 is demon mech and bit of beast. Minions with high stats work better now.
---
Man just today, two times i was 1 game away from hitting 4, and lost twice to pirate and galakrond warrior. then proceed to go into a streak of losing. I'm busy tomorrow and the next day so i'm done trying to hit legend. The next season i'm just gonna grind into hitting rank 5 and then play more casually. Not worth the stress
---
I assume they hard coded the twilight Drake interaction.
---
Fair point
---
I am loving this meta I have hit rank 3 with a couple different decks since nerfs. Thank god for tank floors.
---
I just quit matches where it lags out due to the timer not being fair. It means i stomp my MMR when i play and boring games for other people who get freebies.
---
I might be wrong on this but don't the watchers proc off the weaver when they are played? If he leveled up and played the Walker they would be 10/10 and 8/8, right? You are right though if he did play the watchers last turn, it would be the correct play. But to be so low after the 6th turn shows shows the issue with fast leveling. He's been playing behind all game and dealing 9 damage to himself through the weaver and homunculus doesn't help. So you are right, the issue is not that he went demons when he was low like I said, but that he went demons while also speed leveling and not focusing on board control
---
Hearthstone has needed a blanket "cannot find itself" nerf on card generation for years now. Things like Alex, Glyph, Stonehill Defender, Marked Shot, or whatever else should not be getting free rerolls.
---
That’s so dope! Where’d you learn to do this?
---
Still Tier 1 in most of the "tier lists" and pretty high winrate 
---
dont see any "way" better decks right now
---
Lmao no polarized matchups 😂😂😂😂
---
The decks being played at the rank influences performance, which varies, so no it doesnt perform the same at all ranks. People aren't really experimenting at ranks 3-1, which is where I saw almost no face hunters.
---
Wait, you really think PoisonFang is salty?
---
I don't know, do you get so offended by memes in real life too?
---
Just start doing everything else in horizontal orientation.

This just proves how completely deft, uncreative and out of touch literally everyone at Blizzard who has ever worked on Heartstone is ...
---
Great! Reminds me of Zeus from God of War 2.
---
I don't like aggro deck or combo decks, because I think they're both built on the concept of winning without your opponent interacting with you, which seems pretty crappy to me. I thus tend to think people who like these sorts of decks are probably assholes, because I don't understand how anyone who's not an asshole could enjoy that style of play, knowing that their opponent isn't having any fun. The few people I've met in person who liked those deckstyles have backed up this hypothesis.
---
That said, I do appreciate the need for a variety of deck styles in the meta, so I just tech against them. There's no sweeter feeling than playing a Skulking Geist against a Jade or Inner Fire deck, or pulling out a critical combo piece with Dirty Rat or Unseen Saboteur.
---
Sadly, it seems like most of my opponents in casual these days are resurrect priests, and my midrange/control decks have no chance against them. I'd actually prefer the combo/aggro decks, as long as they aren't Tier 1 decks.
---
Well, that just furthers my argument that the customhearthstone version is laughably bad.
---
But I notice this a lot in customhearthstone, people are scared of getting torn apart in the comments for being "too OP" so they overcorrect on their balance.
---
Never heard of him, been playing since GVG, hit legend most months and watch a good amount of hs content. I’m sure I stumbled across his videos at some point but scrolling through his channel just now there’s nothing in them that would make his name stick out in my mind other than the view count.
---
no one has seen any deck in grandmasters in forever because the last season ended 2 months ago. in that last season though tom60229 brought zoo warlock every week and finished top of his division.
---
The custom hearthstone discord is filled with images that could be part of the game if you didn't know any better
---
Have you tried the Highlander Galakrond Rogue ? Since you normall enjoy Rogue I'd give it a try. It is not as highroll dependent as the 2of DR Rogue but gives a ton of value and is generally a fun deck to play. 
---
I usually don't play rogue but this deck I really enjoy playing. Still learning it though xD
---
Dude, you are in a hearthatone sub, virgin comments are pathetically ineffective
---
Actually you can play around all these things... if you’re good at the game. 
---
Warrior: keep taunts in the way/have board pressure to force a trade/ keep your life total above burst level
---
Rogue: stay above burst range/ silence or transform high priority minions/ out tempo and keep board
---
Priest: I’m a little more stumped on this one as I’ve been climbing with him myself. Best advice is to play the long game and keep minions off their board? Punish their greed with big swing turns. 
---
Face Hunter: literally just don’t play into their secrets and go on defense. Once you outlast ~turn 8 you should be fine. 
---
In every single one of these match ups you should be caring about what your opponent is doing. Are they fighting for board to set up their combo? Are they trying to whittle my health total down to finish me off? Are they sitting back and just answering my precious turn? 
---
Also, what janky ass home brew deck are you running that **all** of these decks are a problem for you? If you can identify your opponents deck quickly in a match up you can figure out their game plan and then create your own that beats/out-values/out tempos whatever it is the opponent is doing. Try to, how do I put this...?
---
Get good.

"Play 3 games as a Mage, X or Y". Quest-Suicide.
---
Around the 30 i think.
---
you don't get to play the deck for 166 games and also complain about it being "unfun".
---
Idk you sound like pure noob to me, I just can't take you seriously.
---
Toxic?
---
They said to print a thought, not a wife, duh
---
This was hilarious! Did anyone have the link?
---
r/woooosh
---
I think making all the cards free its kinda too much and blizzard as company would never renunce to that large amount of money. But i really think the whole sistem should change cause its really expensive to get all the cards, and i can't imagine starting just now with all 6 expansions, its kinda imposible.

WELL MET!
---
Yeah especially since secret mage is still bonkers without aluneth.
---
There is no rule that dictates the number of 7 wins always need to be a certain number.
---
The decks I play get railed by most meta decks but this one aggravates me for some reason. Then again, before it was pirate warrior but what can you expect in the aggro/snip snap wasteland that is wild.
---
I'd rather they make constructed cards than demon-tribal filler.
---
Silver lining! What does Odd Warrior run? Sounds fun
---
I always liked Garrosh's pigtails
---
Most notable streamers are playing BG, don't think they are that much of an impact.
---
Truth is flashy, powerful cards are very fun to play and koft proves that. At least, I find myself playing HS more during these periods.
---
Now let's cast the original Colossus ..
---
Ok, well maybe not free that was extreme, but like much cheaper or a different system in general like less expensive, going back to the wing expansions where you get all of the cards over time by completing the wings, or SOMETHING cause spending a ton of money and gold and still not getting all the cards is frustrating even to someone who plays this game a lot...
---
What's the first picture?
---
Zephrys can't be expected to give a silence as for all he knows you opponents hand is full of spells and it won't matter. 
---
But he will recognize when silence means lethal. Either silencing an enemy taunt, or a frozen friendly minion. 
---
Really I'm getting sick of seeing these posts. What you may as well do is just put a Spellbreaker in your deck, and mulligan for it vs. Rogue.
---
Descent of Dragons is not doing great.
---
It’s absolutely random, welcome to Battlegrounds.
---
Proofs?
---
You mean the one time a discard warlock deck doesn't accidentally fuck itself into Oblivion by discarding all their cards that let them discard?
---
This is busted.
---
But how is it in the game it comes from? Is it just as broken?
---
It would be stupidly overpowered even at 10 Mana even without a body. This can reset any enemy board no matter what and most likely even *destroys* a good part of a nice and full board if their hand is full. Vanish is only ok because you can't really emphasize on all the tempo lost by your opponent so they have the time to reestablish their board.
---
As a 10 Mana 6/4 with that effect, this would be really really broken.
---
As a battlecry, with a body, it's busted and it would never be put into the game.
---
It’s the best meta we’ve had recently according to a lot of players, myself included
---
*facepalm*
---
I would take powerful cards &amp; combos (that don't outright win) over pure RNG bs like ragnaros or MCT anytime.
---
Wait why protectors dont have taunts?
---
If you get Brann and Megasaur, you can just sack your whole board, no matter how buffed, and go for late game murlocs. Then promptly lose after missing poisonous and never encountering other Megasaur, oh well.
---
Nah, if they have that deathrattle activator weapon or if they just simply have more minions on hand it's very much possible to win even if youre a bit behind with your Apothecary
---
I hadn’t played arena in a while . Drafted a what I thought was a good mage deck, first game played against someone that played Kindleroost on 4 and proceeded to play about 15 dragons (all of them great like 5 amber watchers or whatever) 
---
Yeah no thanks.
---
Hunter,face.
---
Couldnt give a single fuck about my winrate, I play arena because I enjoy it. This current rotation makes arena boring and games are decided based on early tempo dragon cards, or whoever has more of them. Good for you that you are landing 5-8 wins, I guess some people enjoy the shitty meta
---
You could've just loaded a game, go "Oops" and then immediately leave.
---
Then let it not be that good. But is what I wanted to point out, really dislike to read a player saying is good but this meta ruins good player's winrates or something, doesn't make any sense. I tried to insult the person's idea, not the person directly.
---
People arent really experimenting 7-5 as well where its all just pure aggro and u cant play anything else
---
Also a word of advice - if you're running Pack Leaders or Mama Bears, tripling Hydra also gives you two times their combined buffs - first for the second copy you play and the second for when you play it back golden. That's a huge value, far from negligible.
---
I've had games where going for second and third Hydra gave me not +2/+4 but +22/+24. That's quite a bit more than two senseis.
---
So. Context is important. People should understand when it's just a measly +2/+4 and nothing more and when it's not.
---
The quest log has never counted the number of 12-win runs. When it says "Wins: 12," that's just saying the key represents a 12-win run. It doesn't mean you've had 12x 12-win runs.

Oh ok
---
Gotta Roku tv and an Apple phone. I’ve found its very delayed or choppy during gameplay
---
The draft was always the most important part of being good at arena. I installed in GvG and went 6 wins on my first and 12 wins on my second arena. The same week I installed. Just because I used hearth arena to draft. I mean I was literally hoovering every card played to see what it did. 
---
Then a long time ago I stopped using drafting software and my win rate plummeted. I am just bad at making decks in general but find the game easy as shit to play. When I netdeck I often go undefeated to about rank 8 when I make my own deck I usually struggle to get rank 14 ;-)
---
Apart from the fact that Witchwood rotates soon, the value of the cards of the set is rather low, so you won't gain much if you don't open the exact cards you need.
---
What are the cards you actually need? Maybe there are cheap replacements.
---
Why so late?
---
I can only imagine the look on Curator's face when he went from (near?) full hp and a flawless run to being nearly dead in one hit.
---
Kobolds was fun because the decks were powerful but you were also doing insane things like swapping decks and calculating the perfect Godfrey. Maybe it's just because I prefer control and combo decks, but dropping massive cards on curve or 3 Mana 9/6 rushes just isn't the same
---
&gt; Paladin: it’s a fractured class that has attempted several different things with little to show for it.
---
Hmmm, I feel like I've heard this one before...
---
No, that would be your mother.
---
self-flicking in public, she should be ashamed
---
k.
---
I actually just got my first 12 win run going 12-1 yesterday after playing since release. Never been a huge arena player but I play when I can and I’ve been having a lot of success recently

Anyway, I prefer playing Wild over Standard, so maybe it would still be a valid deck option, isn't it?

Did it change to something else the next turn ?
---
Priest galakrond needs to reduce cost of minions generated by (1) or even (2)    Would help a lot
---
Imagine that thicc boi meets one toxic frog boi
---
&gt; The situation looks grim for Paladin. Its Highlander archetype looks like a dud. Its dragon synergy is weaker than Druid’s, so it has no chance to compete for tempo against the best classes with its handbuff mechanics.
---
Really agreed with a lot of the report aside from this point.  Saying paladin can't compete for tempo because the dragon package is too slow just completely ignores the fact that paladin has an extremely strong mech package that you can use for early game.  In my experience with a decent sample size at legend, highlander paladin is the best paladin archetype as it crushes warriors, hunters and mages and competes with shaman, handlock and rogue.

I know who hysteria is, also I dont know who hysteria is.

Calvinhi#1147 NA Tade 80G Quest. I will show, you go first. Thank you.
---
what app did you use to put those 2 pictures together?
---
Thanks. I've been checking pretty regularly all day - I'd given up on the decks I was using last night, and wanted to see a meta overview before choosing the next one.
---
69 updoots, nice
---
That was such a long time ago. It's hardly relevant. Design philosophies were much different back then. OP is talking about the recent years.
---
It can magnetize into itself, wich makes it very flexible and not a bad play even when not played on curve.
---
Its a great 3 drop too. A 2/3 that spawns 2 1/1s and threatens a zilliax follow up later is pretty decent to play turn 3.
---
Its also has synergy with token strategies since its sticky.
---
Its basically like zilliax before, even in non-mech decks. Its a good generic card, and thats why it is played.
---
Flikception
---
Resurrected minions don’t count towards the quest.
---
*shuffles away*
---
Translation: God is Flik
---
Mildly related, but a long time ago I remember watching a video of someone creating the slowest possible turn in Hearthstone, although I think it was done before any expansions or adventures had come out, so it was doing so using classic cards (could be slightly wrong on this point; at any rate, it was when Hearthstone was much newer).
---
They got a full board of Prophet Velen and Malygos out by abusing Mind Vision with Lorewalker Cho and Faceless Manipulator (against a Mage, as a Priest), and then filled the Priest’s hand with Arcane Missles. Just as the rope was burning out, the Priest played 10 Arcane Missles, and the Mage’s Ice Block prevented them from dying. The turn took 43 or so minutes, I think.
---
Again, I could be slightly off on some of these facts; this is all from memory, but I think it had the actual, Guinness record of longest turn in Hearthstone.
---
MMoltensGiañthi*
---
Strikes me as indicative of overall power creep
---
Treachery a Deathlord, demonbolt it, get mmoltensgiañthi from the pull.
---
Standard decks in wild have a good winrate because they are played at lower ranks against some low level decks and beginner players. If someone has a premium access to HSReplay maybe they will tell us what is this deck winrate above rank 10...
---
It's a lot more healthy for the game for there to be a bad class than an unbelievably unfun class.
---
Priest needs changes but that doesn't mean you should jump on bad ideas in the name of progress.
---
Shaman is not broken. I’m playing in top 200 na right now and haven’t seen a shaman player since top 1000. It’s all rogue with a few warriors, warlocks, and hunters.
---
I tried the albatross deck but there is so much aggro and so few decks that the 1/1 birds mess with that its 100% not wirth running.
---
Inspire cries in the corner
---
Galaxy brain plays
---
What about restore 2 health to all friendly characters? Works on minions and your hero.
---
Like an actual date? Or did he win a contest and that’s what he got?
---
I \*swear\* it was add a priest \*card\* before add a priest minion. I think it was incorrectly revealed like that somewhere.   
---
so maybe they changed it last minute.
---
Plot twist: They have Flik Skyshiv in hand from an earlier Weaponized Pinata.
---
You could just reroll once and then use your hero power.
---
The handlock deck list is giving me a 404?
---
I've always said that if you want to find the largest group of people who hate a multiplayer game, go to that games subreddit.
---
I faced this once. They smacked me pretty hard but somehow the next 2 people dealt with it and took that player out. I won that game but idk if I could have done it without the help of the others.
---
Looks like Kano
---
Even if you draw anubisath, you can do the combo with Anka. It  rapes slow decks like priest, even if they run silence and weapon removal and can survive against aggro if you get lucky with buffing lifesteal minions. It still a high rolling deck and you straight up lose if you don't draw well but the high roll wins evens it out.
---
~~One of the holes in design philosophy that Blizzard has(had?) for priest. The used to talk about how expansion class cards for priest have to be a lower power level since basic/classic priest is already good.~~ 
---
Problem is, priest in basic/classic is more spell oriented whereas they want to push priest minions when they make expansion cards(Zerek, Galakrond, res). They just seems to be spreading the class too thin imo. Too much of the “jack of all trades, master of none” going on.
---
Edit: I stand corrected on the first part. However I still stand firm on my comment that priest is getting spread thin on strategies that don’t synergies enough.
---
This might not be the best timeline, but it's certainly the weirdest
---
[deleted]
---
Like a copy pasta. The lack of line spaces and the rambling made me think it was along the lines of the Navy Seal speech.
---
In Wild I'd imagine Flicking your own Coldlight would be good up against Mill Rogue.
---
Edwin will always be a good rogue legendary and Siamat is good in a decent amount of decks but will eventually rotate. It really depends on if you plan to play rogue more or play a bunch of classes. As for gameplay, they are pretty similar value cards that can win the game by themselves, but I’d say Edwin is much more swingy and able to pull off wins much more consistently by itself, doing things like making an 8/8 or 10/10 on turn 3 while playing other cards that generate an even farther advantage. Replacing these cards could be done by just throwing in some kind of value legendary or card, from something like big old whelp or snip snap to even something like ysera or alextraza.
---
Card seems like fun but the voice annoys me.
---
Does that pathetic excuse for a dragon really say *"ouchy time"*?
---
Kangor is really good but you don't necessarily need him for Shirvallah paladin. But Baleful banker is completely 100% necessary for the deck, and is how you do your OTK combo
---
1 cost polymorph?
---
Exactly my feelings. I love metas where I can make a fun, strong, homebrew deck, and with th absurd power creep it feels like it's harder than ever. I got lucky with my homebrew deck but that's just because it's essentially rise of shadows tempo rogue but with dragons instead of pirates.
---
I've found the only truly nasty tempo destroyer is twin tyrant ... 4/10 body that deals 4 damage to 2 minions often totally swings the game.
---
It's in single player pve content.
---
...which everyone has equal opportunity to.   
---
Makes it a lot more interesting also than just playing on curve and winning which was what the previous meta amounted to.  
---
Some of the power swings now have evened things up imo.
---
I saw someone Flik their Zephrys to deny their opponent.
---
Am I the only one who liked that face hunter? Who missed it after the nerfs?
---
I stand corrected on the first part of the comment. However, my comments still stands that priest is getting spread too thin on strategies that don’t synergies, while we have classes like shaman or warrior that can pretty much play “good-stuff” decks.
---
How can the overall curve of win rates possibly move?
---
The data suggests otherwise. Since the nerf Galakrond shaman is now also weak against token Druid, deathrattle rogue, and holy wrath paladin.
---
edit:also hand warlock
---
That's dirty.
---
Me likey.
---
how are you supposed to play this warrior list?? in the warrior mirror the other warrior just smorcs you with chargers and it doesnt matter if you can copy scion of ruin at all
---
That wouldn't do anything. This statistic is a record of the most attack damage your minions do in one turn, not total damage across all runs.
---
Flik you guys in the bush!
---
Oh right!
---
I run a similar list with Barista Lynchen instead of Deathwing (provides more value if needed and... frankly I didnt want to craft Deathwing).  
---
GG
---
Yet still the player base is in decline.  
---
Seems subjective views like this don't apply to everyone i.e. the OP and myself included.
---
Exodia!!
---
And then appear a while later with an incredibly unfun control or combo deck that is their only viable option
---
It was decent when I’m standard. Haven’t tried it in wild myself
---
i've seen in wild as reno rogue; usually vs another reno deck, they kill their own value minion (reno or zephyrs) to remove yours
---
happened against me twice
---
Preps, then raids, then preps then raids, then plays waggle pick, two dread corsairs, coin, double backstab, and Edwin.
---
Only if it comes with an unnerfed Extra Arms and better midrange tools.
---
Wouldn't know, I play mage xD
---

Personally, I would have used the WTF emote

That’s the joke jimbo

Ok, that was my initial thoughts aswell from when I started watching, but it's just that I just watched "Dancing through the bombs" Kripparians video and at 11:25 he got a 12/5 and a 7/4 Cobalt while dancing on another in the tavern (also buffs the Cobalts in board with a metaltooth to 14/5 and 9/4.

The danced Cobalt ends up at 15/12. Tripples it and the end result was 32/18 which could only occur if all three units statbuffs minus the base stat of the third minion are added.
---
So that just made me wonder why some do it one way in the situation I mentioned before while other do it another.

It’s the best 3 drop in the game if you’re needing one

That's what I'VE been telling myself because Gala Warrior just seems weak sauce to me. Clearly I'm playing it wrong. I must also be playing *against* it wrong because I keep easily beating it we with just about every kind of deck.

This was in wild AND talking about SoU meta.

Agreed.

It's not that hard honestly. Someone has a golden demon that has health equal to how much damage you've taken. I have seen it 100+ with like 6 attack. Add in some divine shields and Death Rattles your gonna do a lot of damage.
