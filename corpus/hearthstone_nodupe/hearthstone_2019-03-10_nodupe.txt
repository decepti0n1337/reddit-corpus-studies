Wow, not a single common.

1. Better set design.

2. Better high mana cost cards at common and rare to support more diversity in budget archetypes.

3. Maybe a pauper mode.

---
 
---
Your being deliberately obtuse, realistically, MTG has limitless game variants considering it doesn't rely on a client to run them, again, people can easily create house rules by the virtue of the game being physical. 
---
Wild is better period. 
---
Exactly it tells a perfect story as to why he’d want to join this league of villains. 
---
Back in his prime he would terrorise the meta but now he’s grown old, he’s become useless and is mocked as a result. This has made him bitter and so is reached out to by the newly emerging evil group with misplaced hope that he might gain power to once again rule the meta 
---
Honestly he’s basically guaranteed a broken legendary next expansion 
---
My math goes:
---
1 Legendary every 20 Packs avrg.
---
If you dont own all legendarys of that expansion its about 300-600 dust.
---
So basicly 1Legend=20Bucks
---
A card can see play without being problematic or broken. It feels pretty fair after the nerf.
---
It's a worse Execute, but in a more aggressive class. Seems reasonable. 
---
What do you feel is problematic about it?
---
Don't play this game. Its requires alot of money to even have fun
---
Fair enough. Still, there's clearly more emphasis on making sure wild isn't a shitshow than their used to be, hence why it's also very nice that it's a pretty affordable format now too.
---
That does changes it indeed and since you would not lose weapon durability, it's crazy strong removal.
---
And if you play it on a board with few minions it's a big chunk of cheap armor.removal
---
Riot (tries to) listen, and when the community has a huge problem with something it usually gets fixed
---
Nerfs arent supposed to kill a card, so no problem here.
---
I find it hard to believe that after their "Wild Overview" video, but who knows, I really want to be proven wrong about this... Time will tell
---
He clearly hacked blizzard servers.
---
How many times would the Lord Godfrey effect continue to proc?
---
He played naturalize, so they actually drew three.
---
Play it perfectly, and you can potentially do over 100 damage with double Nat's.
---
MarkMckz is the man, he has the most creative decks I've ever seen in Hearthstone.
---
Everyone should check out his [Youtube Channel.] (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2WLo2xxhvPvuYBQVN_ecSw)  My favorited are the [Serpent Ward Quest Mage](https://youtu.be/4XcZRKbYngI] and the [Wretched Tiller OTK.](https://youtu.be/DbKrwGprl4U)
---
He also has a Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/markmckz
---
Inc Sacrificial Pact
---
But Don Hancho enables Knuckles OTK whereas Bonemare doesn't.
---
I think it's 18-20.  It was changed with Defile for the Dreadsteed (a Wild card) interaction.  And is sometimes used with Grim Patron (another Wild card) as a full board clear or make the opponent discard 6 cards (with Howlfiend)
---
or Spellcast -&gt; Damage Hits -&gt; Gadget 1 proc -&gt; Check for lethal -&gt; Gadget 2 proc -&gt; Check for lethal
---
I never thought it shouldve been nerfed,atleast not in way it did. Mana cost increase killed the card mostly,i think either buff being weaker or its own stats being bit weaker wouldve been far better nerf then upping its cost.
---
To be fair, half of the issue with Execute being balanced is that you can't play it in the best Warrior decks at the moment.
---
Altough that's true, that's not his point. The fact that an aggressive deck can turn into the best control deck of the game because of 1 card is beyond broken. 
---
Getting closer to WoW Babies with every idea here guys 
---
That thing is busted!
---
I pulled  40HP Ragnaros back when un'goro came out, where is your FIST now?
---
That's probably too much to put on a new player.  Which is why I don't include it.  Both knowledge of HoF and saving up 1600 dust (or large amounts).
---
The most ironic part about the Tyrande hero is that Blizzard would have probably made more money off of it by putting it right in the HS store, or attaching it to a pre-order, then the twitch prime thing.
---
I guess Activision-Blizzard doesn't really like money after all, since they didn't put up an option for players to buy the most popular hero skin in the game.
---
So it's not a failure because the goal was never to make people want to play it?  Seems like a pretty cynical argument.  But more of talking about how it shows people's desire to have a non-standard mode to play in.  If they were trying to decide if a 3rd constructed mode was worth creating, the track record of how the 2nd mode did would be quite relevant.
---
you lost me at coin
---
There are alot of bots out now
---
it would be basically useless at 7 mana
---
Lmao what an idiot thinking you get 36
---
They responded to that question a few years ago and said no.
---
There are a lot of ideas for things they could do, but I think the real challenge is in finding low-impact targets on the development team. I'm sure they all want the same things for Hearthstone we do, and they've probably been talking about some of the same ideas too; it's just a matter of finding the right ideas that won't cost them time working on the other new content. I'm hopeful ideas like in the video might be low impact enough that they're feasible to make, but still exciting enough for players that we'd want to engage with them. 
---
Thanks for doing this comparison. When you factor in the opportunity cost of not dusting all your rotating cards, is wild still overall more economical? If I dust all my rotating cards I’ll have about 20k dust to use on standard this year, but I won’t have that if I wanted to keep up with Wild. 
---
All of those Instant speed removal and combo disruption options didn't make it so Felidar Guardian didn't need to be banned.
---
And yes, I can still compare the two games in at least a very broad sense. If it's a fundamental issue in Hearthstone to have "seven" card OTK combos complete-able by turn ten, then what does it say about MTG when there are two card OTKs?
---
It looks like it isn’t upgraded, so it would only do 3 damage. And couldn’t combo Spellstone + Leroy + hero power because it’s 11 mana.
---
I don't care how good a deck is, I care about whether or not I enjoy playing against it. I honestly don't really mind big priest, as it can sometimes make some interesting games... But odd paladin? I've honestly never had a fun game against that deck.
---
Хахаха
---
What does this mean?
---
After playing strictly standard since beta, I switched over to wild last month and am loving it.  My secret mage has such ridiculous value with all the “your next secret costs (0)” minions soewing our secrets left and right.  By the time they deal with that you’ve got a nice hand full of damage spells to nuke their face with.  Plus, the two free game extenders thanks to Ice Block can really push you through to the win.  
---
My monthly summary email last month said I went 12 straight wins with Mage and 84% win rate, lol.

Pirate Warrior has consistently been a tier 2 deck for the past few months, only falling to tier 3 in the past few weeks or so. It isn't great and Kingsbane Rogue has kind of taken over as the best extreme aggro deck as of late, but that by no means makes Pirate Warrior a bad deck.

Well hey, any deck that can run itself out of cards quick and destroy their own minions for two mana or less can still play mechathun. I'm sure more combos will arise.
---
A rogue, for example, could use [[WANTED!]] to get a couple coins, then use those coins to [[Walk the Plank]] on either an 8 mana mechathun or [[Da Undatakah]] (after dumping their deck and hand, if course)

What about this one:

Not to mention there would have to be a rope for each player for each phase, either drastically extending the length of each game or not giving ample time for complicated decks to take a turn. To use mtg as an example, there's 6 phases per turn. If there was even just 15 seconds per phase for the rope to burn that would be 3 minutes of potential time per turn compared to the current 75 seconds. This could also mess with current sequencing plays, as combat would likely need to be separated into its own phase similar to magic, in order to give the opponent the proper time to play instants. It just doesn't work with this game, secrets and other persistent 'when your opponent does X' effects are as close as we'll get.

In what way did I use 'colloquialism' incorrectly? Really, please explain. Because I 100% did not.

&gt;Literally does not mean figuratively, etc.

Actually literally DOES mean figuratively. Its LITERALLY one of the meanings of the word now. It has been misused so much that it's now a part of the actual dictionary definition. Sucks, and whether or not that should be the case is a whole different discussion, but that's doesn't change the reality that 'literally' has been turned into a colloquialism.

Much in the same way, when people say 'broken' they don't LITERALLY mean 'broken'.

thats genn not due bonemare,id still be tier1 without it and without nerf wed have more decks.

Also the Marsh Drake might be unplayable later if you can't deal with the poisonous minion, here he has the 1/1's ready to clear it easily. 
---
spitefull was broken in standard maybe  but not really in wild. adn ofc it ended games when came down, cause its a finisher, like leeroy, or guldan in cubelock,or avianna or malygos. that was its purpose to end the game.
---
Lighter versions of warlocks seems really possible, you only need a sacrifice card and play your deck (similarly to the current druid). 
---
I also think there is room for slower combos including undatakah for example, and I'd be very surprised if there this is no other tools *printed* in the next 3 xpacs.

Everyone loses buddy, just the name of the game. Just dont see why you'd purposly set yourself up to lose is all. 
---
Come on, who upvotes these?
---
I’ve never really understood this part of the game. So each of our cards is actually magical, summoning miniature versions of things like the Lich King or a dragon? And then these little miniatures are attacking the other miniatures or actually hitting me in the face? And when a player loses, their hero portrait explodes... does this mean they they are killed with bits and pieces of flesh being sprayed all over the tavern?
---
Whenever you go out, the people always shout!
---
But like, how did this even happen?
---
Felt two was inconsistent, honestly I don’t know how I feel about the one but there’s been some games where I would thekkal and immediately heal back up to 30
---
&gt; Agree. It's solitaire, like almost every aggro. Combo mostly autolose to any pressure, which always feel very unfair.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Can't wait for rotation. One of my last opponents was an annoying Odd Paladin, which even emoted like a kid when he finished his T4 lethal, although there was simply nothing I could do. So nice...
---
They arent making you, just do your free stuff then dont think about it anymore 
---
&gt; I don't see how playing solitaire and hoping your opponent doesn't kill you is fun at all.
---
how you can tell someone has never played a combo deck in a single sentence
---
These deck doctor videos aren't edited down to just the wins, though, there are plenty of deck doctor videos where he just gets wrecked and can't make the deck work.
---
This time, he happened to get a couple soft opponents, but that's the luck of the draw, not Made For YouTube^(TM).
---
I can't stand Odd Paladin either. Tbh, I don't like the meta at all right now. Doesn't matter, that Otk is simply unfair, because we don't have enough combo breaker cards. 
---
Y’all forget the double doomsayer Alarmobot Mecha’thun wombo combo we good 
---
The problem is not with the card or the idea of it. The problem is Blizzards continual reluctance to add disruption tools.
---
There are a few in the game but they are too few to make countering combo with them as tools too unreliable.
---
Blizzard need to be less scared of such tech cards
---
whoops

Eh, loses 1 health for each card in your opponent's hand, it's not that strong.

Yes, crafting everything that moves to HoF will give you a dust profit. However, you only get dust from the amount that can fit in a deck, with golden cards taking priority (EG, 2x Doomguards, 1x Legendary). You do not get dust for extra copies.

It’s crazy that some of us thought it would be worse than Millhouse
---
&gt;Armani Berserker has seen play as a tempo option
---
I guess it came back into fashion.
---
you missed the point. The common is an example. If you never buy any wild packs from the store, you have to craft every non adventure card that you want to use, while in standard you have a chance to open it in a pack
---
That bit about weaker 2 drops is exactly on point. Keleseth sees no play in Wild because cards like Minibot, Haunted Creeper, Nerubian Egg, Ship's Cannon and Mad Scientist exist. The Standard list of 2 drops is much weaker in terms of good 2 drops so every time a new Aggro or Midrange deck appears people instinctively try to fit Keleseth in the list because the sacrifice of not running 2 drops is not that big of a deal for most classes.
---
Done, thanks Zoddly #1570 :)

Hunter is clearly god-tier now. I don't think cube hunter is issue. Problem is [[Dire Frenzy]], [[Master's Call]], [[Tundra Rhino]] package. These cards synergy are crazy powerful.
---
Mid-range hunter is false name. It's basically everything-well hunter. Early stage [[Dire Mole]], [[Candleshot]], [[Crackling Razormaw]], [[Unleash the Hounds]] pretty well control board. Mid stage He can do [[Dire Frenzy]], [[Master's Call]], [[Tundra Rhino]] combo burst face damage and finishing game. Late stage [[Deathstalker Rexxar]] this DK hero power anything can do. Big defensive taunt, AOE, Rush + Lifesteal easy burst Heal, Add charge burst damage. If add success [[Dire Frenzy]] to absolutely unstoppable even Odd Warrior spells, because It's infinite value.
---
"Mid-range Hunter" actual name is aggro burst combo control all mixed hunter.
---
Also people getting better playing Hunter day-by-day. DK hero-power provides 3x3 option every turn, a lot of synergistic combination available. This is not on-curve deck, a lot of skill intensive deck. I feel power-level gap has been widen.
---
I believe Team-5 should address this arch-type Hunter before Las Vegas live event. If They do nothing, probably We'll see worst Hearthstone tournament.

Where did you find the pattern ?

I didn't know you got a full refund when cards rotate out? That must be wrong. I know you get a refund when cards are hall of famed but that's like a couple of cards at a time 
---
I am actually starting to worry there won't be an announcement this week. If they keep spacing out the teasers they'll need Monday-Wednesday-Friday just for the teaser.
---
I unpacked Keleseth the time he became hot shit. I was not hesitant to craft Patches the same day for tempo rogue.
---
No I just mean for their regular dust value, so I can craft the hall of famers now. Sorry, it's worded a bit strangely

The only new thing in there is oondasta though. And he’s seen play in other non aggro hunter decks

best trash moment was the person who said:
---
&gt;In terms of bad legendaries I would go so far to say this is worse than Millhouse Manastorm because you can occasionally find an opponent that doesn't have a spell in their hand and millhouse can be good, while this thing cripples your deck before you start, is a tiny minion at only 2/2, and its effect is almost never relevant.
---
Yeah. LOL.  Spot on...
---
I was playing him in the brawlasium and it was happening a lot
---
I’m almost positive that’s how it works. Anyone confirm?
---
It didn't see any play until nerfs too.
---
Now somehow find a thekal and another amara for sweet 40 hp 39 armor. 
---
I get that, I just also don’t like disenchanting legendaries because it feels really bad for me. But there are some cards that are almost 100% safe dusts like moorabi. I still can’t bring myself to dust the little guy though lol.
---
Agree. It's solitare, like almost every control.
---
Aggro mostly autolose to any boardclears, which always feel very unfair.
---
Can't wait for rotation. One of my last opponents was an annoying Big Spell Mage, which even emoted like a kid when he boardcleared me 5 turns in a row, although there was simply nothing I could do. So nice...
---
&gt; means his ability has been "applied" twice
---
It means his ability applies continuously.
---
Defile *was* a 1-star card in the KFT meta, though. It wasn't until K&amp;C that it become the defile of today.
---
Fortune teller was in the Old God's trailer.. 
---
Hmm, keleseth was played during the expansion he was released in. I recall playing zoo lock with keleseth during koft
---
And more importantly, he correctly called "the Darkest Timeline".
---
Seems like a fair choice, they did start to just get heavily memed as opposed to more significant discussion.
---
Alright so now my goal is to get Ragnaros 6.9 which consists of:
---
-2 x Shadowform from Shadowform
---
-Blood fury from Jaraxxus
---
-39 armor from (Amara and) Thekal
---
-40hp from Amara
---
Y'all want anything else?

He said it was more of a fun theory then a one that he genuinely thinks that is the secret lore to the game.

Nice to see another vS report. But I’m quite intrigued seeing as midrange hunter, Reno warlock and odd warrior aren’t tier 1 or at least tier 2 decks. Odd warrior is an unappreciated deck, it does well against even warlocks and almost every single aggro deck. Because of brann and oracle the deck has a chance to win against the otk decks and sometimes find some interesting lethal thanks to it. 
---
Midrange hunter is still a pretty solid deck, the only bad match ups might be odd pally and maybe big priest. I’ve out tempo most aggressive decks and won against other midrange decks.
---
Reno warlock might just be good enough with the mecha’thun package. Its still a decent control deck that gives you a variety of options when countering the meta.
---
For this month’s climb I’ve been mostly playing odd warrior which took me around rank 2 almost rank one. Then I switched to midrange hunter to counter some of the greedy control decks and the even shamans.
---
And from rank 1 to legend Reno warlock has been doing its job quite well.  
---
Right now I’m rank 28 legend and the decks I’ve been using the most are Reno warlock and midrange hunter, haven’t used odd warrior much since there are a couple of control/anti control decks. 
---
10 hours!
---
I started using squelch 5 years ago, because the emote system is very annoying and barely brings anything but frustration. Have squelched every single opponent every game since then. Except those I forgot and was thus annoyed by.
---
Why do you think having to squelch every single game for 5 years makes me enjoy "emotional moments"?  It only reminds me how stubborn Team5 really is.
---
Part of it is also giving good cards to classes that suck at the time, and will still suck with that great new card.
---
Trump for example did not give DK Rexxar 5 stars for that reason, citing how Hunters sucked at the time. Now that Hunter is the king class however DK Rexxar is the best DK to craft by far.
---
A good example of this from the most recent set is Krag'wa, which a bunch of pros rated highly. Krag'wa would be extremely powerful if Shaman were a stronger class and the meta was a bit slower. But it's not, so the card isn't used too much, and reddit mocked some of the pros who rated Krag'wa so highly.

Aya is also based out of the Gadgetzan Museum of Ancient Artifacts, and artifacts seems to be a unifying theme between Togwaggle, Rafaam, and Aya. I believe Togwaggle even has a voice line mentioning Rafaam in Dungeon Run.
---
I'd say there is a difference between a card becoming more popular because the meta changed and a card becoming more popular because the deck it goes into got additional tools.
---
 Hadronox is a card that falls into the latter category but Keleseth is the former and its important to note that even prior to the nerfs that enabled its real glory days it was a functioning strategy that just wasn't quite as powerful as other decks at the time.
---
Calling Keleseth embarrassingly bad prior to launch was definitely wrong in hindsight even if you just look at the meta game that directly followed the KFT launch.
---
The reactions to Keleseth were more along the lines of 'why would you ever play this? 2 drops are too crucial' and not 'good card but there's better strategies out there' 
---

I'm Zappy and I've started streaming Hearthstone most days of the week from 8 am to 12 (ish) EST. I'm fairly consistent in my schedule and have no problem in going and explaining various Hearthstone mechanics or decks, as well as giving suggestions as to what some newer players might like to try and run. I also try to break down my plays and was just able to climb to 5 with zoo / hunter, and then in the same stream just hit 4 with a midrange questlock.  
---
Feel free to stop by and say hello next time I'm on at [https://www.twitch.tv/zappy9](https://www.twitch.tv/zappy9)!  
---
the other thing is you get stuff like defile being a 1 star card, where he tries to review the cards in combination with the meta, rather than looking at a card in a vacuum. 
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOU TURNED HIM TO THE DARK SIDE

You already posted this a month ago and it got good attention. Did you make the same post again?
---
Im not going to watch it.
---
I would like to think MTG Arena is also a factor; people are leaving hearthstone for a better game.
---
The only reason I still play hearthstone is because Arena isn’t on mobile. Me and my buds have even started calling it “PhoneStone” 😅

It’s funny you used tog as an example because that’s one that I dusted. But I wasn’t that upset because I’m not interested in playing Druid really.

---
No but they knew that Aggro decks were very strong.  (Pirate Warrior and Murloc Paladin).  Murloc Paladin was one of the defining decks of Un'Goro.

how was summoming portal putting your minions down to 0 cost? the effect says it wont drop them less than 1. [[summoning portal]]

I feel there should be a no dead horse rule. That if a meme is done and you done nothing to improve on it you should have your post deleted, then banned, and then fed to the lions.
---
We literally just got a nerf that hit Even Shaman and Odd Paladin, two decks that have been in the top of tier 1 for a year.
---
This comment is dumb.
---
I am surprised that this thing should be explained to some persons. I never disenchant extra card if i wouldn't be sure that this card is stays unusable in collection for long period.
---
Nice, I think I’ll post this one again tomorrow!
---
This memes are 2 years old
---
No, because I'm not playing. Try that, I guarantee 0 disconects.

---
So funny there are a few other ways to get random dragons and absolutely nobody runs them. Dragon roar comes around and everyone loves it.
---
So do we know for sure you can have a normal genn/baku and golden and you'll get the dust for both? I have the dust for golden legendaries (on top of the normals I already own) and want to get that dust then disenchant the golden ones. 
---
Can you do an AMA as one of the contributors to this sub's shit state?

I actually think it's the class with the most promising archetypes overall right now.

So far, hearthstone sales have only taken the form of preorders and limited-time bundles. Examples of the latter include the [Welcome Bundle](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/hearthstone-welcome-bundle) or the [Everybody Get In Here! Bundle](https://i.imgur.com/A4A3Zte.jpg) (no longer available.)
---
I’m F2P so I don’t have all the cards for the deck, but it’s the same as the pre-made “Wings of War” decklist, which is one of the ones available from Whizbang if you have that or just making a deck of warrior and looking at the pre-made decks.
---
Did you still win?
---
I do remember an Elemental Tempo Rogue being at something like 55% winrate.
---
Remember HSReplay was less popular at that time too, so high winrate / low playrate deck still existed.
---
(Jade Druid was better because Jade Druid was the best deck in the game at that time, remember the UI on turn 4 ...)
---
to be fair it feels like drawing Keleseth is unreasonably consistent for some reason
---
if you add 1 boar you have another really strong win condition (otk)
---
Nope. The boss deals 100 damage to your face if dorothee dies. I eventually won with an inner fire deck
---
Any combo that requires Tharussian ticks is not an OTK.
---
For the record, I *do* remember seeing a deck hit legend with Millhouse in /r/CompetiiveHS -- but that was because it was running Millhouse along side pre-nerf [[Call to Arms]], and CtA was so broken that 1) you could justify running a card that was pretty bad a lot of the time, and 2) a 4/4 hit off of it was basically just gravy, since 4 mana for a 4/4 is relatively reasonable
---
Millhouse sucks but I think that's an unfair comparison because you can at least do things circumstantially to make millhouse pretty not bad, whereas you're SOL for making a vanilla 2/2 playable (assuming you're playing Keleseth in a deck with other 2 mana cards)
---
Avoid rotating set; classic cards are essential if you're a new player, aside from that I suggest buying atleast 10 packs from Witchwood and Boomsday: if you haven't pulled any legendaries from those sets yet, you'll get a legendary in your first 10 packs. I think you've opened a few Rastakhan packs and have gotten your legendary. If you did, don't buy those for now. If you need any help, hit me up
---
Swamp dragon egg, frost drake (or whatever it’s called). Literally all these and then a cheap card with no restraints like deathrattle comes along and replaces them all! What a mystery this is!
---
Don’t buy any packs from Frozen throne, Un’Goro, or Kobolds and Catacombs. Those sets are rotating out of standard.
---
Congrats! I got my first Legend in Wild also and found the climb much harder than Standard. Enjoy it now that you are there. I suggest finding the memeiest of the meme decks and play those instead of meta decks :)

which makes you relize that even if it wasn't a legendary running 2 would just make it worse
---
At the time Rogue had just lost their best 4 drop (Tomb Pillager) and was struggling for any amount of sustain at all to help offset the cost of punching things with daggers. You weren't losing anything to include Valanar in a rogue deck, so it saw a not insubstantial amount of play in miracle rogue decks like that

Elemental Rouge was Tier 3 at the end of August.  (I think corbett had a popular list) The first week of September it preyed on new/fun decks up until Tier 2 (then the nerfs happened.)  But it couldn't beat Jade Druid (but neither could many other decks).
---
Isn't only un'goro rotating out when the next expansion comes?
---
So you don't play the game? Because I feel like there are more non-Keleseth rogues than Keleseth Rogues.
---
yeah, all day servers are bugged. y can play for fun - nothing to lose, try different builds ;) 
---
So I should just buy a s**t ton of classic packs? Won't that give me alot of duplicates tho?
---
&gt;15 packs from each expansion since that should give me most  
---
Lol, you poor naive person.  
---
Your best bet right now is waiting for the next expansion and doing some sort of pre-order deal.  
---
Expect this new set in April - anything you do now with anything from Frozen Throne, Journey to Ungoro or Kobolds and Catacombs will move to Wild then.  
---
So if you aren't going to play Wild you will want to avoid buying or crafting anything from those sets.
---
Can you do something about the "after x months I finally got _ cardback!" posts and the "look at my 6969 wins!" posts? With the card posts, there's something to talk about at least, but these posts leave no room for discussion about the game whatsoever. 
---
Not much sense in crafting an epic for a month. Great work on being able to beat this as you did! 
---
Mrlgmrlmrlmglrgrl
---
Okay, thank you
---
Yeah you're misunderstanding. It's in deck not in starting deck. You could have 9 other 2drops in your hand and he works just fine. Conversely, you could have a 2drop psychic scremed back into your deck and it would not work.
---
I run a dragon warrior deck with the potential for 5 boomships. It's brilliant. 
---
I always wanted a control oriented murloc shaman. A couple big boy murlocs (a nerf to murloc knight so it couldn't summon them if needed) and it could be a fun deck
---
Cute cat XD
---
It sais that if the game has good 2 drops, you don't want Kele. Agro paladin doesn't play it, kingsbane rogue doesn't play it, zoo doesn't play, the list just keeps going
---
And all you get for it is 25% of the cost of another legendary. Frankly my advice is just not to ever dust any playable copies of anything. Takes some patience, but you eventually get to where you can build basically any deck even if you're f2p.
---
You can finish it...
---
It's a meme lol, he knows that Naxx was out in 2014.
---
Dude you have no idea what you are asking. We used to have 9 deck slots and then, after years of research, they added 9 more. A lot of casual players where so confused that they quit. Adding more deck slots now would kill the game. Think of the casuals for god's sake.

How is this different that just having a rotating brawl each week as we do now?    
---
You're then basically asking them to develop a monthly brawliseum on top of the weekly brawl?  
---
Whilst anything new would be nice I don't personally want just another pay to play game mode.  
---
&gt;I think the success of the most recent Brawl is proof that there is large demand from the player base in nifty formats like these.  
---
Success? What success? You mean the large amounts of gold/dust that people who had access to the overpowered otk style decks earned?  
---
If I were to guess I'd say this would have been the least successful brawliseum in terms of overall population participation and total amount of games played but that's just my hunch.  
---
Normally on a brawliseum I'd pay for a few runs but this one was once and done, it was horrible.  
---
Except there are multiple things that can prevent it. 
---
Well done my dude, I recall this fight being an absolute bitch to beat
---
What good does tracking do in your opinion because i hate the rng of discarding 2 cards that i need for more options
---
If the combo *requires* shadow visions to go off on a turn before playing the combo, it’s not an OTK.
---
If the combo uses shadow visions as a way to speed up card draw, it’s fine. 
---
?
---
It absolutely matters, a card that is good in a vacuum has a significantly higher chance of seeing consistent play rather than a meta dependent card. It also will see play across a wider variety of deck archetypes, which allows it to be played somewhat regardless of meta. 
---
Purify is a bad card in a vacuum, that saw play in 1 archetype for 1 meta. Firefly is a good card in a vacuum that saw play in virtually every archetype in every meta in nearly ever class for 2 straight years. 
---
The absurdity of imagining a meta situation where firefly is 1 star is hilariously convoluted and forced. Whereas it's the exact opposite for a card like Purify, where to make the card competitively viable requires quite convoluted levels of support to make up for it's inherent weakness in power level.
---
I get you're being sarcastic, but I remember beating plenty of tempo rogues who opened with multiple keleseths -- seemingly because they ran out of steam

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
A few notes: 
---
*Van cleef and sherazin are not replaceable.  They are very core to this deck.
---
*Its not the easiest deck to pilot, but soooo satisfying when you get the hang of it.  If you remember how miracle worked during the conceal days, it’s kinda like that.  You have to know when to just kinda go all in on a threat and hope for the best.  It requires reading your opponent.
---
I just got a quest I can't even do 
---
So then my Five Tharussian ticks into two pyroblasts and two fireballs is an OTK. 
---
I was able to do it with the rogue steal shrine, and with good RNG you steal their really OP cards
---
Your definition would exclude many accepted OTK decks: mechathun (all the versions that use Galvanizer), uther OTK (either need to generate a coin or bounce guys), Anyfin (have to play murlocs), maly rogue (pre-play the weapon), maly druid (via twig or florist), etc. Now that's not wrong per se, but it doesn't reflect the common understanding of what the phrase OTK deck means.
---
I think the point others make when they argue that one Thaurissan tick is fine is that a) it cannot be prevented by an opponent (ignoring dirty rat, secrets, etc which could screw with your definition of OTK too) and b) it doesn't matter what turn it is played so long as the right cards are discounted. This second part is what distinguishes a Thaurissan tick from say a shaman board flood one turn and then double bloodlust the next.
---
The definition of OTK deck that I am aware of is: 1. the deck can do 30+ damage in one turn, and 2. it can do that damage with no minions on board at the start of its turn.
---
Yep, for all the complaints and constructive criticism we may give it really is a great value product overall when I think of how much engagement I spend in the game and all for free.  
---
So Happy Birthday Hearthstone. :)
---
Yeah but that’s pussy shit. It’s easy to say “may or may not see play” about every card, but that means you have no balls.
