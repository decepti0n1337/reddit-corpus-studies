What is so hard to understand about card games designing cards for different people? Just because you don't like playing that way doesn't mean others feel the same way.
---
---
---
You also don't need to completely destroy your own board. Yeah, Unwilling Sacrifice never saw real play as it is expensive, but a whole board, especially when it is wider than your opponent's, is a very high cost to pay.
---

---
They are overall incomparable.
---
Plus, if there's any deck that'll play this, it isn't Zoo Warlock.
---
IIRC they said Rogue wouldn't be getting another lackey generator because of Heist Baron Togg
---
LIGHT THE PYRES.
---
Nah it's awful in arena. Cards like Solider of Fortune are good because you gain a ton of tempo by playing a 4 mana 5/6 and the downside comes later, this card loses all the tempo it could possibly create by frontloading the negative effect which actually most likely gives your opponent more tempo than you gain.
---
Yeah I agree with you and I believe you can even afford to run the scheme even in a zoo deck just because the combo is so strong.
---
Plus sometimes the scheme is ok on its own, maybe even with a knife jugglerü§î

\#Velhomestre1496 I show. You go first. NA
---
Druid confirmed better than rogue
---
I don‚Äôt understand how they just type stuff for the card text. You‚Äôd think they would have a dictionary with actual lines of code that correspond to strings, so the card text is generated based on what it does...
---
Molten Giant Warlock in season 1 of hearthstone. Fill your hand, let your hero get cut down to nearly dead. Drop giants for free, give them taunt. Faceless manipulator. Glory days of basic/classic set standard play.
---
yeah I‚Äôm unfortunately kinda disappointed so far.
---
Rafaam's Scheme is not a card Zoo Warlock would want to play in any way at this point. Magic Carpet can't do anything with the Imps, and it takes four turns for the card to become decent.
---
Magic Carpet itself is a much better tool for Zoo to deal with boards wider than it has too.
---
Drowns to... life?
---
Back in the eighties...
---
If you concede, do you get opponents deck to?
---
Maybe summon X different beats?
---
the problem for me is that there isn't really cards to build deck around, there are just some archetypes and lets say 10 cards which fit that archetype.
---
Nah i dont see anything game changing here. I mean this expansion is as  you Said game changing. We have even more archetypes. If thats not game changing then i really dont know what op thinks is game changing
---
How about Nozari? A control card on par with Reno Jackson, given to the class with some of the weakest, most expensive control tools. This card doesn‚Äôt make any sense in paladin, because the decks it belongs to are so weak that you can‚Äôt justify running them aside from memes.
---
If his twin brother is also a 10 mana 10/10 then I am not sure mage can be stopped.
---
They did change the mosh'og or whatever they were called
---
Am I the only one facing and playing merc 14 rather than merc 280??
---
wow never seen this before
---
That's kind of a stretch. For one you need Glinda, otherwise, you also can only play 4 lackeys. Plus, you don't really care about the summoning, evolve, or taunt lackes.
---
I agree with no new archetypes but they are adding lots of versatility to the archetypes that do exist which I think is better since the old decks will still be strong, these new cards just force you to build your decks in more interesting ways. Warlock with more versatility in both zoo, demon and plot. Mage with spells or secrets, murloc getting more morlocks, the new cards add a degree of synergy that wasnt here until these cards were revealed.
---
Boring card
---
New to this sub, sorry if it‚Äôs a common post.

Malygos-lock has special place on my heart, as it was my first non-zoo/face hunter deck, back during blackrock. It was fun to play a midrangey deck, and it used the malygos which I got from my first ever 12 win arena.
---
I frequently struggle with huge blockades of boats when trying to assemble combos. Now I can sail in relative peace after playing this card.
---
This is true for every class except for rogue, exactly because of how insanely good starting with a 0 mana combo activator in their hand is.
---
I've hit legend and I'm shit at this game.
---
Checkmate atheists.
---
Imagine how OP this would be if any combo druid was a thing.
---
While unsavory to westerners, insects are a cheap and sustainable source of high-quality protein and nutrients.
---
You can have a rotating classic set so that beginners have cards while still getting rid of problems with longevity. I think people are exaggerating how "bad" kiblers ideas are for new players.
---
Yeah, but that's over multiple turns. I prefer Knife Juggler + Ethereal Lackey -&gt; Shadowstep for infinite damage in one turn :)
---
at the start of the year the sets rotate, so youll be caught up until the next rotation
---
Agree. I think there is a place for one copy of this card in the deck that includes Elysiana, mainly to dig for your core cards.
---
HUZZAH! Mercenaries 280 has been defeated! HUZZAH!
---
Time for fun we're
---
Gonna run ya throuuuugh
---
Too bad fa youuuu
---
Kazakus/Krul Warlock in KFT probably. It felt like a unique enough deck for me (I almost never net deck), but still reasonably strong to climb with 
---
What also comes to mind is that menagerie druid with Finja and quest Malygos druid, which is weird because I usually don't like druid that much...
---
And also a shoutout to C'thun rogue even though that deck sucks.
---
It's still all over right now. I just got like 6 in a row (and I have it too).
---
at 10 mana glinda + 1 lackey on hand is at least 19/23 worth of stats and some added value, depending on the lackey. doesnt seem bad for a 2 card combo that doesnt require a huge amount of setup.  
---
you can have 6 lackeys in warlock and you wont need to have them on hand when playing tekahn. generating them after tekhan should make them 4/4s too (at least the wording suggests it)
---
summoning lackey is the only bad one for comboing with glinda. evolve needs a minion on board before you start the combo, which can be annoying, but evolving something 4 times can be pretty strong. taunt isnt that bad either. worst case is, you buff your glinda. best case (when you already have a minion on board) you protect glinda vs minions.
---
You really only need to buff 1 lackey on the board or in hand for this to be a good tempo and value play. Anything more than that is just icing.
---
&gt;newbs only know the net decks
---
Oh, I see that English is your second or third language from your level of comprehension. To rephrase, when I said, "newbs only know the net decks", it doesn't mean that pro players don't know about them, it means that newb players only understand odd and mech paladins because they only play net decks. If I knew your native language, I would have translated for you.

People don't put Sprint in their deck because it is shitty, even moreso after it was nerfed.  People might put Overflow in their deck because it is good.  That is how hearthstone works.
---
You didn't respond to my point that Druid is designed around playing high-mana cards, while Rogue is designed around not being able to afford them.  Druid effectively has more mana than Rogue, meaning that its high-mana cards should on average be similar or lower power-level than similarly-costed cards for other classes.
---
why did you make the eyes open????

Its hard, realy hard i have almost 6 years of deck building experience and still, its realy realy hard

---
&gt;Bloodworm wasn't amazing to get off DK Rexxar, it was situationally good. It made your beasts too expensive for no immediate board presence unless you combined it with a charger, rusher, or a taunt
---
i run it in my dragon mage deck and im rank 3 with it
---
There are decks like mine (shaman sspells 150?) that beat the mercs 280 deck. I wonder if they give random new players in the brawl decks that counter the top decks.
---
"Choose a friendly minion. Add two 1/1 copies of it to your hand that cost (1)."
---
I've got 12 wins in arena with Goldshire Footman in my deck. Doesn't mean it's a good card.
---
If it was actually a stupid post, then there would be no need to waste time commenting in it. I can tell you don't play paladin since it requires high thinking.
---
Bad tavern brawls bring forth the worst in players.
---
70% winrate from what, rank 50-45? 
---
TL;DR Paladin sucks, you don't have any homebrew decks that are any good buddy
---
Can i get a link for that deck ur playing chief?
---
Amen.
---
That‚Äôs a stupid argument. Just because your posts has people commenting on it doesn‚Äôt make it any less stupid. Also not playing paladin doesn‚Äôt make you stupid because, as most normal people know, paladin doesn‚Äôt actually require high thinking.
---
It was more about being win more card. Zoo as a very board centric deck (there was a reason some people called it aggro-control) couldn't really play from behind anyway. The problem with gormok was that to often it was just 4 mana 4/4 and dark iron dwarf was better in situations when you had 1-3 units on board.
---
Those two Mana Binds and the Splitting Image I got off of Blast Waving his turn one onslaught.  Bad luck comes in waves, I suppose.
---
Yeah.
---
Turn 5? Not that special.
---
That board, on the other hand...
---
I'm a software engineer and I can see something like this *easily* passing QA. It's not an obvious mistake unless the cards are side by side, which they weren't necessarily likely to be often in their year long development process.
---
"Shadowgoden will remember this"
---
If you're gonna do plot twist shenanigans, you're probably better off just running Fiendish Circle since it does basically the same thing but costs one more mana
---
Disenchant it and craft something better.

I really don't think that's possible. Computers are *really, really terrible* at generating authentic human communication patterns. Each card's text is likely reviewed again and again by humans and iterated over multiple times to be sure it's clear and communicating exactly what Blizzard wants. No code would be able to determine what the card does and translate that to human language.
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of, but they usually give some freebies in the form of packs and special quests at the very least.
---
you must be new here
---
This card also saw play in even shaman in wild but it definitely was never staple and since nobody played it before it was too expensive to craft I‚Äôm guessing.
---
You must be talking about Ungoro quest shaman, which wasn't that great during it's time in standard, and I'd argue is even worse in wild. Murloc Paladin, on the other hand... Was crazy OP during Un'goro, and is even better with Anyfin in wild
---
It says "Cloned 1/1" for minions summoned by Zerek's Cloning Gallery.
---
Murloc Combo Paladin. There‚Äôs plenty of decks I‚Äôve played more and done better with but that‚Äôs the first deck I ever got really into in Hearthstone. Really liked how it worked and it felt great slamming down Anyfin and winning games with a bunch of Bluegills. 
---
Also love the older pally legendaries like Tyrion, Lightlord Rag, and N‚Äôzoth
---
Oh cool, thank you very much
---
Nah, you get 3 Rise packs every beaten chapter, and a golden legendary and a golden classic pack after beating chapter 5 on normal.
---
Note that these rewards are given if you either buy it with gold or real money, I did the whole thing saving and using gold.
---
Congrats mate.
---
Oh okay but idk if blizzard would do that. But sure that would be cool.
---
I agree. As fun as control games that go for twenty minutes to half an hour, nothing can beat the fun fast paced gameplay. It would be great to see a meta like that again. Only with the utility cards we have now.
---
Praise.
---
LOL absolutely not a staple... And there's a reason why it's super difficult to proc his battle cry.
---
This new board clear looks pretty serious
---
I can‚Äôt wait for the Sand Rager reveal, 3 mana 5/1 Reborn
---
&gt;No he wasn't. I played him a bunch and it's super hard to proc his power.
---
A million more on the way :)
---
This is awesome! I was going trying to find someone doing something like this with Deathwing, Dragonlord and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73akc1HdUUM).
---
How could they not know that 4 patches would destroy any early game over any other deck.
---
I made very good use of this guy in my aggro paladin deck. Which is, 2.5 years later, still very good in wild.
---
Zoolock was awesome with him in it and im pretty glad he was my first legend
---
I hope that happens because I keep trying to get a new deck but I‚Äôve faced 20 Merc 280 in a row.
---
I'd save the dust for something you know you 100% want post expansion. Wait till the Meta settles and I'm sure you'll find something you will want for sure!
---
lol what. A somewhat difficult conditional for a decently powerful effect should be legendary 100%
---
Those synergies are nice, and I definately thing the card is good, but I think 5 stars might be a bit high. I just don't think the card has the impact of a 5 star card on its own, and it all comes down to consistently having those synergies. For me it's a 4 star card
---
Ohh I see, the Shaman deck I had was at 0 wins so I assumed it was basically just a random deck I‚Äôd been given that hadn‚Äôt won anything
---

1 in 3 times they double conjurers a sea giant is not incredibly low. It will happen enough times for it to be an annoying thing to have to deal with. If they have both conjurers and use all 4 attempts on 8 10 drops then the chance they can hit this guy is 53%. I'm not saying it's going to be overpowered, I do think it will be unfun to come up against though. The chance is high enough for it be a relatively frequent occurrence and the power of it when it occurs is very high.
---
I think I‚Äôve seen enough for now. I‚Äôm deeply concerned for  you. I‚Äôm sure many others are just as lost as you. 
---
You need your reality to be real. You cannot entertain nuance or the possibility that something may be wrong about it. You must aggressively enforce it. These are not healthy  traits. . 
---
You have won nothing, because there was nothing to win. I was trying to speak with you in a healthy fashion...but, you just couldn‚Äôt do it. You became my progressively more unhinged and obsessive as time went on you became even more fixated on this idea of winning. Again, there was nothing to win today. 
---
Regardless,
---
Thank you for providing this insight for me and speaking to me. I sincerely hope you‚Äôll consider speaking to someone about your feelings. I really, really do. I can tell there is a lot more going on here, but I know you won‚Äôt engage in conversation.
---
It was an expansion in Wow. The best one might I add.
---
I gave it a go. Nice idea. Hopefully once a fair few have done it you will have some good results. I feel that time will tell for a lot of these cards however.
---
Is Shudder really that low? Thought it was better.
---

---
Thank you for finally answering a question I asked. It‚Äôs the first time. It‚Äôs precisely what I expected you to say. 
---
Every single thing you said today is what I expected from you. I did not expect you to be this obsessive and aggressive. 
---
Nothing that you have said about me is true though. None of it. It is simply a product of your imagination due to over fixation on news media and a rigid trust in their narrative. That‚Äôs the truth. You cannot accept that in your current state though. This is not how a healthy person operates.
---
Never saw play? He's one of my key cards in my ultra zoolock deck. He's been in plan since reliquary seeker was released.

Seeing as people in this thread can't see the difference between "when this minion is damaged" and "when this minion takes damaged" calling both enrage who could blame Blizzard?

They don't want to introduce a new tribe just for it to rotate out with the sets.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt play hearthstone at the time‚Äù been playing for 3.5 years now they were never cancer because of the ramp it was because frozen throne gave them broken things to do with that ramp if when you were at 4 mana they didn‚Äôt have malfurion no one would care because extra mana doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you can‚Äôt do anything with it, and because they just nerfed the ramp with no changes now a lot of the Druid cards are over costed. The only card that made druid cancer was jade idol
---
I... I don't think you know how this meme format works...
---
It wasn't obvious - we could have ended up with three decks in a stalemate, where each is a counter to one of the other two and countered by the third. Or we could have ended up with a few top tier decks that were close enough in power that it would take more than a few days for one to absorb the other.
---
Questing explorer isn‚Äôt better than novice here since the chances of getting explorer in the first 5-7 draws after quest is too low for the punishment of having a 2 mana 2/3. Either that or you intentionally use all of your mana to get the 1 draw if you get the one copy of it in your deck. With acolyte, wrath, nourish, and overflow you have on average 9 cards. That‚Äôs not enough. Crystal song discovers 2 combo pieces and is not meant for the final effect. If you get Elise, it would also count as either the floop or Elise combo piece. So it‚Äôs more of a 2 mana usually tutor something useful. The ancients are for Aggro decks not cyclone mage. There are lots of cards that you can single out in meta decks that are for specific matchups. Spell breaker in Bomb warrior, earth shock in Murloc shaman, or keeper of the grove here. Not every card is supposed to be useful for every matchup and that‚Äôs how highlander decks have played for all of hearthstone
---
I think the reason you didnt see him much is he was a niche legendary and Zoo was mostly played as a budget deck by players with low dust collections. He was absolutely a good legendary to put in Zoo at the time.

Exactly

No no no

Are there many/any cards you would see in a Spiteful Druid deck (where this 7 math matters) where that is the case?
---
That sign won't stop me because I can't read.
---
IMO, a major source of this brawls problems is that almost no other deck has any kind of synergy in it. A number of them literally run two clashing themes. Ignoring the extra Patches, Mercs is just a Pirate deck. ‚ÄúElements + Technology‚Äù is half elementals, half Mechs. There‚Äôs no way to make that a coherent deck, let alone one strong enough to beat a better put together, if technically suboptimal, aggro deck. This extends to other decks too: for example, ‚ÄúBattlecry‚Äù has a random Merloc theme too. 
---
Really, every other deck needs to be rebuilt too.
---

---
So, let‚Äôs say that Alice, the new player, puts together a basic card deck, and she runs into Bob‚Äôs Bomb Warrior. Bob smashes her, and she see that her deck is 0-3 0% - turns out that three other people had exactly the same idea she did. Also, it tells her that Bob‚Äôs is currently 54,678-46,279 (54.2%): deck win streak 7. She plays and win, and she sees that the deck she got from Bob is now 56,252-47,001 (54.5%): deck win streak 8. 
---
Track it all on the deck code level, so if a thousand people use the same deck it all counts for overall stats. Track win streaks on the viral chain of winners-and-losers level. Give people the option to resign their deck to try something new to break the meta.

Oh right lol, I don't know why Rafaam escaped my mind :p

I just did this last night as well! Did not think I would beat it with my crap battlecry/evolve shaman, but I had enough super high value combos, and Rocket Backpacks with a 2 Mana simean sphere to hold out through the early game.

I mean throughout this expansion cycle first we've seen Dragon/minion heavy mage, then people started making various itterations of Cyclone mage (for example I used to see Rabble Bouncers, Questing Adventurers and Astromancers and now noone is running them) and most recently there is Freeze mage. First few weeks people thought Mana Cyclone was a meme Casino mage enabler and that Dragons were the way to go, but now Cyclone mage is tier 1 and dragons are nowhere to be seen. Not to mention that pre RoS there was nothing like this deck, so your meme makes no sense whether we look at short term evolution or the whole picture starting from the beggining of Hs.
---
KFT was the most successful expansion in terms of performance, at least based on Activision Blizzard's quarterly reports. People can hate the power level of the DK's, but I'm with you, I'll take fun and excitement over boring, mediocre cards.
---
It's not in Blizzard's interest. They need to make money from pre-orders. And anything that reduces the revenue from pre-orders is ultimately not in your interest either, as they'd need to find other ways of making money.
---
Why is Akali so high rated? It seems like its stats make him not that good. Is there a deck in which it's that good?
---
Make the decks actually legal in wild (ie only 1 copy of legendarys, 2 otherwise)
---
Old gods. I‚Äôm a big boardgamer and have already seen the cthulu bandwagon and used to play wow a lot and apparently quit before there was any lame stuff like that in there and thought it was just super goofy in hearthstone and unappealing and unconnected to anything I liked about the lore. And chtun decks everywhere was pretty dumb.
---
I don‚Äôt even hate the mythos stuff it just seemed super out of place in hearthstone.

I wonder what the highest win total is.  I beat a Merc 280 deck with 112 wins at 1pm EST yesterday (7/26).
---
For some joust cards like [[Master Jouster]], the power level between winning and losing was incredibly disparate. A terrible 6 drop versus a better sunwalker. And you can‚Äôt ever reliably influence the outcome because a deck needs to curve, so it‚Äôs essentially rng whether you instantly lose or win.
---
King‚Äôs Elekk saw play I believe, because it‚Äôs a fine 2 drop and the upside is incredible as well. 
---
Overall joust is hard to balance because of its inherently random nature.
---
That trailer tho

Queen of Pain has more health, so I'd argue it's more useful in that scenario.
---
Yeah but you can beat 7 pirate warriors in a row and then lose to the 8th cuz of bad draws and then your deck is good as gone

What?

Its not that its good its just its not as bad as the others. Some variants of big warrior/bomb warrior sometimes run her as a value engine.
---
These aren‚Äôt even arena-style decks.  Theyre generated from card buckets that are in The Dalaran Heist and then the deck is named after the bucket that was picked the most (or given a duo name if there‚Äôs a tie).  The number is probably the random seed used to generate the deck.
---
Very poor wording from OP.
---
Why 4 minions when u can have a 3 mana 3/3 that deals 3 damage for just having a lackey.
---
Yeah that makes sense, but its not easy to grind for 7.5k gold and a lot of the time i feel people would rather just pay the money than do the grind, people are suckers for consumerism and whether they pay directly for the expansion or pay through gold, in the long run it will probably bring blizzard in more money than less, especially if people just need a little bit more gold and will just buy it. 
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
It seems you are saying the deck got better by adding more combo pieces.  That's interesting because typically card combos are considered worse the more cards it takes.  Also a lot of those useless cards are about survivability so I think taking them out could be worse.  Anyways good answer.
---
I played this in my Bolvar/Justicar control Paladin deck and it was great. My highest ranking ever (rank 3) was with that deck.
---
It was pre-nerf Patches trying to relive his glory days
---
This format has never made sense to me, but all right.
---
I'm afraid I won't get any sound notification no matter what since I play with the base sound muted. And also, my problem is I have absolutely no idea which file it might be, or if there is even a specific sound when you get challenged.
---
And I just checked the HDT thing, you're right there is a highlight option. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to help me much since it's only flashing the HS icon in the task bar. I'll try to find some external software that can interact with the task bar, that might work actually..
---
Woops, guess I misread it.
---
I really like both of those ideas actually :)
---
&gt; you have your deck in your hand.  
---
Lmao, truth there
---
&gt;I agree on Gadgetzan being the worst with you but mainly due to patches and the "pirate package " bullshit.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Jade Druid didnt become the widespread unbeatable giant it was until KfT rolled in with the deathknight, spreading plague and Ultimate Fucking Infestation.
---
This one from what I have seen of the cards so far.
---
Physical card games such as Yugioh have been at it for years. You could also create shops for players to sell or trade their cards
---
This is fuckin nuts
---
I dunno. I think the next card not being drawn is essentially one RNG card out of your hand that would have been there. Most of the time, your deck won't go to fatigue so the effect would be more or less equivalent imo.
---
I dunno what to tell ya then. I play it, it works out for me. I'll take the results even if it's a bad card.
---
I'm glad you brought that post to my attention because I probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise, and those proposed card changes were hilariously bad. 
---
That said, there's not really anything else that needs to be done about him/ his posts as far as I can tell. He obviously shouldn't pursue a career in game design, but overall he seems pretty harmless.
---
All taunt. Disabled enemy taunts as well.
---
I hated Gadgetzan because of the polorizing matchups and how Jade decks were so unsophisticated to build. I also hated Genn and Baku, they really made the game unfun. They felt like they limited deck building and creativity a ton, they were in so many decks, and they made future expansions worse because Blizzard had to balance around them
---
That‚Äôs just not true. Since the last patch, dragon mage has consistently had a higher winrate across the board than cyclone mage according to [hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/meta/?hl=en). Luna‚Äôs pocket galaxy buff helped dragon mage way more than cyclone mage. While dragon mage has a weaker early game, it has far more win conditions than other mage decks, and often dominates ~~warrior~~ control matchups. I would argue that cyclone mage is also significantly harder to pilot.
---
How normal people define good cards, cards that are good enough to be played often and when used, result in wins often. For example, [[zilliax]] is an amazing card because it clears, defends and restores your health all at the same time and even combos with mechs. It‚Äôs excellence is represented in the fact that it‚Äôs played in over 50% of decks and has a high winrate. Rumble‚Äôs cards are just not played very often because they‚Äôre bad. Basically the only good card in rumble is [[zul‚Äôgin]] and a couple common support cards like [[springpaw]].
---
You could easily add deathrattles for nzoth.
---
Witchwood, not for the cards, but for the Arena change. Before they made the 3 card selection for similar power levels, drafting skill was so much more apparent in arena. My win rate would vary from about 6-6.5 and i wouldnt even pick the best classes, just rotate around for fun.
---
With the same power level draft choice, people can literally close their eyes and draft a similarly powered deck. My win rate plummeted and this is when i quit playing last year.
---
If were talking cards, BRM is still my most hated for 1 reason; Thaurrissan. People applaud him as a combo enabler, but it was this card that single handedly KILLED combo decks that worked without him. Blizzard nixed Patron, Freeze mage and Combo Druid all during Thaurrisan meta, why? Because Combo decks were innately predictable and Thaurrissan made their limited combo potential effectively unlimited. I played at Legend during patron meta and the ONLY thing i HATED about them was Thaurrissan. With the number of cards in my opponents hand and his mana, i knew exactly how much damage he was capable of. Then he plays Thaurrissan and all that gets thrown out the window. Do I just hope he didnt hit combo cards and play normal? Do I play extra conservative and risk giving him time to draw more combo cards? Do I play faster to try and race him down but risk getting my board blown out by a clear? No fucking idea anymore because I have no idea how much damage he can do know and I just have to make a crapshoot.
---
So did they nerf Thaurrissan? No. They killed Patron, then combo Druid, then Freeze Mage. Then there were no combo decks at all in the meta that didnt rely on Thaurrissan until he was finnally and blissfully cycled out. While those 3 decks were based off standard cards, i really doubt they would have been nerfed until the next standard cycle if not for Thaurrissan and i dont think Blizzard would have been so cagey about making some new cards for obvious combi decks.

As an arena player playing since MSOG - probably KNC, followed closely by KFT. The power level was overtuned af and every game, especially in the KFT meta, was filled with the same OP neutrals(Gastropod, Tar, Deathspeaker, Hyldnir, Stonehill, Fire Plume, Saronite, Cobalt, Bone Drake, Bonemare, repeat), no matter what class you played against.

Yeah, my favorite deck too, but now unplayable, so sad

You have a 1/1 Scarab. You play a 2/1 Abusive Sergeant and make the 1/1 trade up.
---
You‚Äôve successfully gained exactly 1 attack on the board and nothing else.
---
That is not catching up, that‚Äôs treading water. Especially in the  mid to late game where their minions scale up and most of yours do not.
---
Haunted creepers and eggs do not win you the game if you have nothing else. Even with Abusive Sergeant and Power Overwhelming. And that above scenario is even assuming they can‚Äôt clear your ‚Äústicky‚Äù minions, which is usually very **very** easy for any control deck in the mid to late game that already won the board.

You are right about that. Jade Druid became oppressive after UI and SP were introduced. I believe it wasn't even tier2 before KFT

For the French bit, Canadian French people understand metropolitan French better than the opposite. Most of the words used in Canadian French are the same, but some of them have very different meaning or uses. Leading to some funny situations where the colloquial word for children in met. French means testicule in Canadian French. The informal grammar in Qu√©bec is WILDLY different. And the accents differ massively. Again, French speakers in Canada will understand the others better than the other way around. Also, they pronounce English words with PERFECTION. It's always startling.
---
But as a metropolitan French speaker who knows a few Qu√©b√©cois words, I believe there are many ways to make the French version much more Canadian.
---
I remember the stuff in Gadgetzan really got oppressive when the next set released. Jade didn't hit the ground running.

Memes are becoming too flexible and no one is comfortable expressing anything without a meme.  Expect memes to becomes as cringey as smileys within 5 years.
---
Its just randomly generated. "Mercenaries" refers to the pirate theme and "280" is just the number of that specific variation on the mercenaries theme.
---
From what I understand, every deck has a random "theme" and a random number to label that version of the theme. Where your opponents name normally is, the name of the deck is there.
---
Mercenary is the "theme" for the warrior deck. 280 is the version. 
---
Mercenary 280 just happened to be the lucky random deck with 200 Patches so it's super oppressive and won the meta. So your shaman deck with theme "totally totem" number 562 gets knocked out and you join the army of mercenary 280.
---
Ok whatever you say. You can never take board back as zoo. Got it.
---
But that usually leads to the opposite complaint of "forced archetypes." I don't think it's nearly as easy as people think to offer just the right amount of support to certain archetypes, and I don't think people realize how terrible the game would be if every archetype got the support they were asking for. There will always be unviable potential archetypes whether or not the support is there. I think in a game of nine factions as opposed to something like Magic's five, it feels a lot worse when potential archetypes fall short but I don't think that should be viewed as the major problem people are making it out to be.
---
Agreed, but to be fair the chances of a dragon quest seem next to none. 
---
I doubt rogue is a pirate one either based off the hints that a 45/45 Pogo can be easily achieved this coming expansion.

It is the 280th generated deck that follows the ‚ÄúMercenaries‚Äù theme. All decks in the brawl are randomly generated while maintaining a specific theme and are named according to their generation order

I agree that it would be better as a choose-card, however then the card becomes just a tax on running a card from an old expansion, which I also dont think is particularly interesting.

more like first person to play against it

This combo doesn't just automatically make you win versus every deck? Unplayable.

okay clam down Paladin you been OP again you CAN'T have anything
---
There's a list in the sidebar of this subreddit under Upcoming Events
---
It's also secretly automatically weighted against you since you lose ties. Which you don't take into account until you use or about 20 times and never win.

Patches.
---
Patchwork
---
what do you mean?
---
The Grand Tournament 
---
The neutral legendaries were niche , and the class legendaries were never seen outside of Paletress. 
---
Joust was an rng mechanic that relied on high rolls and inspire was a mechanic that relied on you using your hero power, 
---
It introduced the monsters known as Mysterious Challenger and Totem Golem /Tuskarr Totemic . This would mark the rise of Shaman Stone. 
---
It did introduce some cool cards which would shape future mechanics , such as Lock and Load ( which would lead to Yogg )and Burgle.
---
That would be way better than having the two split up, since ordinarily you'd need to first find Rafaam's Scheme, charge it up, then find Plague of Flames before the combo is useful. It would also free up a card slot, which is huge.
---
On the other hand, having them split up does make PoF more flexible with other cards like Fiendish Circle, SN1P-SN4P, Scarab Egg, etc... So I'm a little torn on which would be better in practice.
---
Awesome art, either way!
---
What the fuck went wrong with artifact?
---
I like licking toes. 
---
Did I do it right?
---
It hasn‚Äôt been good because there is nothing except that card that upgrades your imps +1 and deal 1 to enemy minions and darkest hour. The problem with the first one is it is a terrible board clear and the +1 didn‚Äôt matter cause the imps would all die or it is isn‚Äôt enough to beat other aggro decks. Darkest hour had a similar problem. They would all die before you get the combo off or it is just too slow to use on turn 9. This however is what it has been missing. The scheme had little to no support. Now you have a reason to play the card. Either darkest hour combo OR clear their board with this new card. It is a very effective board clear against big boards like giants or flooded boards like murlocs. Every new warlock card this expansion is making rise of shadow cards more effective.
---
This would not see any play at all. It was an optional card in a tier 2 deck for 1 expansion.
---
I don't know what I mean sry :P
---
Zola gives two, and if there's another that says "copy of" it will too
---
"Your deathrattles can trigger once per turn whenever a minion dies." Perhaps? Given the nerf, I think it would be fair to no longer have it limited to minion's deathrattles or on the deaths of friendly minions
---
I'm about fifty fifty at this point. If I don't care for the current standard meta I like wild because I feel like I can build whatever and it some what works. But if the standard meta is healthy I love grinding a metadeck and tryharding by researching matchups, mulligans, winrates and all that. Also I've been spending probably a majority of my time playing recently on heist, I seriously think it's one of the best things they've introduced to hearthstone. No turn timers make it perfect to play at work during downtime, plus all the different builds keep it fresh. (Also how difficult heroic chapter 5 is lol)
---
I think Nozari's a perfectly okay card to print - but it would imply that any deck that uses it need to look towards the late game, since you don't care about healing your opponent. When you look at the cards Paladin received for Dragon support though, the support is based around tempo and handbuffs (Dragon Speaker, the neutral Dragon cards like Crowd Roaster etc). Leaving aside the question of whether the dragon support is good enough to make a viable deck (spoiler: it isn't) Nozari doesn't gel with the existing Dragon support at all for that reason. In fact Nozari doesn't really fit with any existing Paladin archetype except maybe combo (although could be argued healing your opponent could potentially be bad here as well, especially if your opponent has armour) since Paladin has never received value and card generation to a level where you could compete with other Control decks in the late game.
---
I almost did that twice, though the second time I got 6 before the win
---
Yes, Zavas retains those buffs as well. But this is fine and according to rules.
---
When discards happen, a card is being moved from the hand zone to a graveyard zone/discard pool. But this does not happen to Clutchmother Zavas, because a triggered discard will be negated by her ability.
---
Read her card text this way: "Whenever you discard this, don't discard this and give it +2/+2." So basically the discard trigger resolves itself and all what's left is a handbuff effect. Zavas is not moved away from the hand zone and thus keeps applied buffs.
---
[Official blog post for further reading ("Copy A Card Rule Change") ...](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/21965466/)
---
Nozari would be playable if it only healed you, and not your enemy, at 10 mana.
---
Your getting downvoted but I laughed.
---
Finally. Rise of shadow cards really didn‚Äôt do anything to help warlock. This expansion is definitely helping the class and boosting the power of previously released expansion cards.
---
i started playing on the day when K&amp;C camo out but back then i didnt know that and was so confused with all the quest from mean streets

Nope, standard.

Not all versions run Luna, but yeah. Although zilli is just an amazing craft, independent of the deck.
