The first thing I said was it was way less damage. And no one is claiming this is going to be a legend deck. Maybe slow your roll there, buckaroo.

lol prep got hof'ed

Most of the people uses it to complete quests and, most of the time, they only have competitive decks available for a specific class. A very fell uses it to test off meta decks.
---
this interaction has been posted for the last  2 years. How is this anything noteworthy at all
---
In my opinion is better to craft a budget version of combo priest - a tier 1 deck right now.
---
I can't tell what someone's mulliganed based on hovering unless they are very specific in their movements. A lot of people hover all their carda or pretty randomly.
---

---
I honestly thought maybe you hadn't played in a while, since mulligans you used to be able to wait. Wasn't trying to be snarky.
---
Didn‚Äôt that get nerfed recently?
---
when you really want to see your opponent whole deck
---
I hate this game and don't play it anymore. But that was worth the time. What an amazing combo. WoW.
---
You can't mulligan after your opponent. This was changed years ago. Mulligans happen at the same time now.
---
Do you think it‚Äôb would be better, or on par with your budget rouge deck? I‚Äôm deciding between those two decks.
---
The issue was specifically that Battlecries trigger *after* the minion is played, so it never really made sense for the Quest to consider Faceless in the first place.

---
Yeah, the original plan for the deck was some sort of silence shenanigans, but i never used bwonsamdi and it was my freebie from rakhastan's rumble, so i went with it instead. I just never cut out the last two pieces of the silence priest. 
---
I don't have a lot of dust, but i went ahead and crafted a grave horror since i'm going to be making other priests decks as well that it'll be good in and just unpacked another sandhoof, so i will definitely be replacing Shadowquill for those two new additions. As well as cutting the unsleeping souls for 2 acolytes of pain. Once i unpack another tolvir i'll be adding it to the deck as well.
---
As for the penance, i'll probably test the deck out more and decide whether to replace it or not. It's been a godsend for aggro's bigger minions so far. 
---
Thanks for the suggestions! I might tinker around with cultists as well if i ever unpack/craft those as well.
---
Thanks a million, buddy &lt;3
---
I'm not sure what this post is asking. Why wouldn't you be able to get a golden copy and a non golden copy?
---
I went up against this deck I got him down to 400 armor but even with no minions on his side i eventually just lost to mill
---
It's the new quest for shaman which makes Battlecries trigger twice whenever you activate it. Mogu Cultist upon summoning the 7th copy will have them all destroyed to summon Highkeeper Ra, which does 20 to all enemies. The uncertainty came from whether the 2nd battlecry would go through given that the 1st Battlecry would have already destroyed the 7 Cultists, but just like Bogslusher, it procs twice, regardless.
---
Bruh not cool lol
---
I got two copies of non gold copies?

I understand the theory, but a bit of potential lost tempo is a far better outcome than an instant loss
---
[[Sn1p sn4p]] is actually a solid drop at 3, 6 and 9 mana. This is why people run that in their decks.
---
Nevertheless token druid will be just fine without it. Is your deck a treant based deck or a mech based deck??
---
If treant, you can add any treant synergy cards that directly affect the board. I would recommend [[landscaping]]. This provides more stats than snip snap on turn 3, but gets worse in the late game. This can be overcome with treant synergy though.
---
If mech, you can add any similarly costed mech to fill the spot. My choice would be [[harvest golem]] since it gives about the same stats on turn 3 as snip snap. The problem, again, is that if it is not played on turn 3, it becomes much worse since it does not have echo.
---
You can also try [[replicating menace]] for additional attack and stickiness. Keep in mind that it is not a good drop by itself though. It is only good if you magnetize it to something.

I think the actual solution is to give mage some sort of [[Lillian Voss]]-esque card. I play this quest a lot and the main problem is just having your hand filled with book of spectors, arcane intellects, and research projects. There's a lot of trash spells you cant even transform into something else because you cant play them. So just give mage a finisher card where you transform your trash into something else

Hey, this is my deck! :)
---
I have been playing it since Vargoth was released, I documented the "official" version about 3 weeks ago here:
---
[https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/3122](https://outof.cards/hearthstone/decks/3122)
---
Expect updates every expansion!
---
Special thanks to the [outof.cards](https://outof.cards) team for creating a special "Mill Mage" category just for this deck.
---
Shield Slam the Lifedrinker (a few turns earlier).
---
Could i get ur decklist? I haven't found a good and cheap one
---
Unpopular opinion here (I assume), but I consider that problematic too. It turns the early game into something of a coin flip. Did I draw the right board clear or minion that can deal with enough of them? If not, it's often impossible to win. And if I drew one or two on time, it's nearly impossible for the aggro / zoo deck to win.
---
In my opinion, a good card game doesn't allow luck to be that impactful. Of course, luck is unavoidable, but the degree of the impact can be controlled.
---
I mean getting a free brawl, multiple warpaths, Omega Assembly, or Shield Block all seem nice to me

7/3/7 | Taunt Deathrattle: Deal 3 damage to all minions.  
---
Probably a bug because if you have a rush minion it can‚Äôt attack other minions if there is a taunt in the way
---
This guy straight up just misplayed, counter on one is a terrible play because you can always play around it with coin.
---
Thanks!
---
How is Undatakah able to all four deathrattles?
---
It was likely with ancient mysteries
---
U will need to play 10 cards in ur hand, it takes time. If in ur deck will be a lot of low cost cards, u will suck, if element of mira wont be in ur hand until 9-10 turn
---
I‚Äôll try it. Do you have a replacement for zilliax?
---
Another cancerous combo, great to waste time of your opponent. I wish OTK decks didnt exist.
---
The best thing to happen would be: let whizbang move to wild and make it's decks wild exclusive and release a new whizbang-like standard classic card
---
So what you are saying is that it's any easy 15 card combo?
---
I'll edit my comment, sorry
---
you're right, i forgot about explosive runes.
---
Yup. Raiding party is a decent replacement as it fills a similar role (refill). And cold blood is similar to green skin (greenskin usually does 6 damage, +1 then +5 and it leaves a body) without the body and cheaper.
---
I know thats how they work, but it means amet‚Äòs card text is wrong
---
If you have any dust Williams is worth a craft
---
Actually, you still can kill Malchezar with sac pact. You'll just need Vargoth for this (spell from your hand won't work, but repeated by Vargoth it still works :))
---
It's not because you played the finkle, not your opponent. It didn't buff your cards
---
Classic reasoning from a new player, any information is better than no information. Pro players (based on my definition is a Rank 2 and above player) know every Secret for every class available, and a coin is way less valuable than your Quest. 
---
What OP did was definitely an outplay, his opponent was overconfident and took the risk. Besides, even if it wasn‚Äôt counterspell, he could‚Äôve dropped a 2-drop like EVIL Totem or something. And if he didn‚Äôt have a good tempo play, dropping a 1-drop would still be strong in a deck like Quest Shaman
---
Dude. My oppenent had the beast and amet and he summond the finkle for me. For the same reason khadgar gives double Finkle in the same situation.
---
r/HSpulls
---
Oh thanks
---
It was on standard. I played quest pally to rank 5, then quest shaman to rank 2 and again pally to legend.

---
I'm a casual play and I don't play ladder much but I'm rank 10, not rank 15. I also run all the cards you mention in addition to 1 [Storm Chaser]. I manage this by not running [Nightmare Amalgam] which has fantastic stats for a murloc but has no synergistic effect. For 1 Mana more get the same stats and a possible win condition on turn 9, or at turn 5 with a tiny tempo loss. This is especially fun against murloc pallies that use prismatic lens on turn 4 since their big swing is on turn 6 and mine can be on turn 5.
---
Git gud
---
[deleted]
---
Only 6 Legend ranks off, very nice!
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
It‚Äôs crazy to me how aggro warrior is less common than other aggro decks when it‚Äôs has much more favorable matchups than say murloc paladin.
---
Amazing. Thanks
---
The same can be said of any class. If the quest distribution is equal, then all the classes are brought down by the same amount and that should be a non-factor. Why do you assume Mage is the only class people quest with in your example?
---
No I just thought it was funny you were cherry picking while talking accusing someone else of cherry picking.
---
Murloc pally heavily relies on drawing [[Prismatic Lens]] to use with [[Tip the Scales]], in order to flood the board early on. If your opponent has a couple of board clears, you run out of gas and lose. If not, you usually win. You might have matches where Lens is in the bottom half of the deck and in that case it's a mediocre Murloc deck.

What does this have to do with Hearthstone?
---
It is an actual AI...? Zephers cannot play hearthstone lol
---
Barista and Elekk
---
Doesn't shudderwock resolve effects in between battlecries like Yogg did with spells? If so, he's an exception so probably not the best to use as an example.
---
Okay i looked into it and it seems like what you have is a preconstructed planeswalker deck! That's fine. It's already an actual deck. You can play it out of the box and its in standard format.
---
Unlike Hearthstone, Magic has a lot of supplemental products. You have booster packs, intro decks (which is what you have), commander decks, and lots of other non standard supplemental products.
---
I used Aggro Warrior to climb from 8-5 this season when the nerfs first hit. I figured aggro would be everywhere and this deck stands a fair chance against just about everything. Very solid for climbing.
---
I don‚Äôt really think he is one.
---
What do you mean by that exactly?
---
Let the AI cheat behind the scenes instead of cheat in front of you?
---
I really don't care about you not caring. Being agressive is extremely bad behaviour, almost as if one had had no good upbringing.
---
Every now and then, the stars align
---
Boy and girl meet by the great design
---
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
---
Same experience I had! Especially the possibility of a surprise 12/8 Grommash on turn 8 can save quite a few lost games, as well as the [Kor‚Äôkron Elite], [Inner Rage], [Bloodsworn Mercenary] combo, for which I have had the luck to play it several times.
---
The pieces all fit together so well, it feel like I‚Äôm playing old school Zoolock again.
---
Doesn't matter which deck they bring because if they are rank 30 odds are they make shitty plays. Let go of the tilt
---
Only? You've got the average of one in twenty, don't complain, some of us aren't so lucky
---
Can we make a category dedicated to ‚ÄòAdd Whizbang to the classic set‚Äô posts please?
---
Watch Kripparrian, he has a video on this deck
---
I think the easiest version is Quest Druid with Elise. 
---
If your Dreampetal hits either a Mogu or a Faceless Manipulator, you can summon two Ra‚Äôs pretty trivially.
---
If I won this, I‚Äôd also reach rank 5 for the first time, so maximum salt about whatever happened here...

---
Prolly just someone tryna get views posting to random subs
---
If you're a new player, don't try to climb higher than rank 10 until you've crafted a decent tier 2 deck. I'd recommend murloc shaman as your first go to meta deck, it's a solid deck that you can get to legend with if you grind hard.
---
To answer your question, it's not pay to win unless you're a new player with a very small collection and no dust.

Faceless the Ra? Is Ra's deal 20 a battlecry?

---
What's the point of milhouse manastorm?

Actually this makes sense. This was my first thought too.

Actually you wouldn't want to play high tempo minion if it's not counter spell, as it will be likely mirror entity and it will be better to just quest + 1 drop.
---
Lol exactly.

What a waste. Especially if don't plan on spending it

Can you believe this is a hearthstone subreddit? From the convo you certainly cant, that other guy is crazy lol, he referenced nazis and antifa in this comment section too
---
He could be hearthstone champion, he wont pass on a 80 gold or a pack for a match
---
I got downvoted so hard but comments supporting me are upvoted... I feel like a this guy bot spammed me but thats to much of conspiracy theory right?
---
It's literally the only secret that matters at that point. Even coin -&gt; Totem against that play is very reasonable, if it's not Counterspell.
---
Wow...
---
Highlander Mage is still doing alright as the best post-nerf mage deck, and Secret and Quest Mages are two of the best decks in Wild. Secret Mage itself could probably be built on the dust you may have gotten from the card nerfs of last week.
---
Even then, not all classes can be good at once.
---
Well, thx for info mate :)
---
Most of the people from my FL don't even ask anymore, they straight up challenge me as soon as I jump out of a game.
---
There's about 1 good card for every 14 in all sets of the year of the Raven. It is full of unplayable cards with a few good apples to make you forget about the bad; go to the gamepedia for the sets and scroll down by class and you'll literally identify about 1 card per class that is seen in any type of tiered deck in standard right now or even on the original releases of these sets. If 9 cards out of 10 aren't good enough to see play in any tier decks at any point in standard this far after their release I'm willing to call the cards in the year of the Raven overall bad.
---
Sounds great, I'll leave you to get that idea passed into them.
---
Go Wild dude, you can play Secret, Quest and Highlander Mage at their highest.
---
Do you want to play 1 hour matches?
---
Maybe been cleaner helps being healthier by having a non-threatened immune system therefore you gain health?
---
Viruses and bacteria are no joke even for Garrosh.
---
Same, and same. I completely agree that he was too powerful for standard, but a 7 Mana boom is very balanced for wild.
---
These are some really cool cards, though at a quick glance I think as a set, the synergy is dangerously high. There's a crazy amount of Pirate, Murloc, and Coin synergy. A little goes a long way in terms of making a theme interesting without basically telling players what to do.
---
Really cool ideas, though, and great flavor all around.
---
&gt;Reasonable solution: Make Boom cost 11 mana so they can only play it in half of their games.
---
There's nothing reasonable about that.
---
Nah blizzard wants your money theyd never add whizbang to classic even though it would be awesome
