Overkill is one of the few things that is a lot different because of the going over the target health, while cards that react on kill only need to max mob health
---
Archmage is useless crap. It just supports some archetypes, not creates new ones. Class legendaries DO THAT.
---
Honestly, I have no clue. I think it’s becuase ‘Boom’ is also a word so they are able to translate it. I’m sure Madam Lazul is still called Lazul for example. (Madam would probably be translated, though).

4 legendaries in 91 packs :(

Not a fan of the Christmas one, it's an alarming baby blue
---
Honestly, 12 packs are ok but it is super disappointing that you have to wait for them all AND that they're mixed. I'm ok with waiting a bit since I have a lot of gold, however, I can imagine how many player got annoyed by the fact that they can't open many packs on launch. I hope they keep learning from feedback.
---
If you enjoy making yourself feel like shit read on:
---
I haven't opened my 80 pack bundle yet but I logged in at lunch and got a golden kalecgos
---
The only legendary I got was a Fel Lord Betrug...... FeelsBadMan
---
Same for me, 7 legendaries in 200 packs
---
Loot hoarder, subject 9, hidden wisdom has been keeping me full along with all the ways to play secrets from my deck.
---
What add on is this?
---
dont worry I'm sure valve will make it right in Dota 3 after all they've never made a bad 3rd game in a series ...
---
I understand, doesn't really sound fun to replace my deck with random garbage hoping to outvalue dr.boom hero power and omega assembly
---
from my initial testing its pretty terrible. its just too slow vs the decks im facing at rank 5.
---
Bad bug hopefully blizzard refunds people who got them from packs after the rotation. Otherwise that would really suck getting Genn and Baku as your legendary after they rotated
---
Lol he's saying he's happy
---
Rafaam can add more than just 10 though. And I think he’s more fun.
---
Bad. You run out of gas quickly.
---
Reading this thread it seems like everyone's rng is really shit. I was just going to ask if they raised the legend/epic rate. Opened 25 packs, got 3 legends (1st was in 1st pack) and and 9 epics, one being gold, and only 1 duplicate. Seems like I got a wider variety of commons/rares than normal too. Side note, does anyone think Barista Lynchen is playable?
---
If you want a decent base for your deck, I made this. It’s been pretty strong so far. I don’t know why you’d want Malygos, but this deck features a lot of spells.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
He is better than a Death Knight in the sense that he opens up more options to a player who doesn´t have that many cards. A Death Knight gives you maybe 1 or 2 decks, and if it´s for the class you dislike or an archetype you don´t like playing, you are out of luck. 
---
&gt;he isnt a card that lets you build fun decks on release that feel interesting to play.
---
I disagree. He requires a bit more creativity (I know, it´s harder for some people) but if anything he opens up even more possibilities than a legendary for maybe 1 or 2 decks, because you can combo him with so many choices.
---
Whether that is interesting or not for you personally, sure, that is a personal opinion. But honestly, you could also get a random terrible legendary instead, would you be happy? 
---
So back to the problem at hand: You think that it is bad to distribute the packs over a few days. To that I ask: Would those extra 4 more new packs today help you *so much* with your quest to make a fun deck? Because that is all we get: overall 5 packs from the new expansion, the rest is from other Standard expansions (Witchwood, Boomsday and Rumble), with cards you already have.
---
Granted, there might be a lucky legendary in there for you. But the more realistic option is that you would just get 5 new packs with some new commons and rares, and 7 old packs with most of the cards that you have.
---
You should either have saved up more gold, or bought some packs. Those extra few packs today would not really be a gamechanger for you anyway.
---
fuck it i just crafted it GOLDEN
---
next expansion:
---
0 mana warrior spell: upgrade your schemes 500 times and change the art to one that fits.
---
blizzard: see, you mocked this card for being trash and now you want it nerfed? *evil laughter*
---
In all seriousness, i think it is not absolutely impossible you get the dust back. This card is so bad and it is so clearly a last minute pack filler that it is possible blizzard decide that it doesn't meet minimum standards to exist in the game. Unlikely, but not impossible.

Whatever works for you.  Ultimately, it's just a game.  I played WOW for years, leveled up, got all the high end gear, and went on guild raids that lasted hours.  One day I realized it had turned into a job, and I wasn't having fun any more.  That was the last day I played WOW.
---
Cant wait til Artifact gets rereleased in 2020 and again nobody will care lol
---
Great comment! Any other gems?
---
I know it's just an option for non warlocks
---
The only thing I want them to change is when you have your card back set to random and you open multiple packs your card back should change between each pack. Right now it only changes at the beginning or if you close and reopen the pack opening screen.
---
just a few hours, chill man...
---
The odd decks kinda took away alot of the variety of decks you could build,and streamlined the meta into a few game winning decks,which was a complaint among many youtubers,streamers and players
---
How can u get him?
---
Don't you also get the old arena cashed out? I haven't got any good or packs from it now that I think about it
---
Oooh thank you for that info, didn't know Tess would trigger bombs again -- Guess I avoid playing that against Bomb if I already drew a few.
---
F2P is the only way DCG's can possibly work, and even that's far from guaranteed. Valve was just way too arrogant not to see how their business model was doomed from the start.
---
"Yo yo yo The Junior Explorers head into the forest mapping it for us..." Such a sick flow. Literally rap god
---
You should probably uninstall and find a different game
---
I was pleasantly surprised. Almost conceded during the animation because I would have been dead without those bombs.
---
Disagree, having a lot of fun exploring new archetypes and revisiting ones past ones that couldn’t do well against the DKs. Maybe try building decks outside of the metadecks?
---
People will call me crazy but I swear to God they lower legendary drop rates on launch day because they don't want you getting a lot. Most people from the fireside gatherings are reporting higher numbers so that backs my conclusion
---
F
---
Yes I am the worst person ever
---
Mostly you just need cable rat, miscreant and the scheme
---
So many turn one concedes.
---
If he lost, he would have probably lost even harder if his opponent had 2 more threats instead of just armor.
---
Since there's only 4 minions in the deck, I assume it's to try to almost guarantee discovering Jepetto and then use that to get a 1 mana Malygos.
---
Deck code ?
---
I’ll try it out! Thanks.
---
Free dust time!
---
Just did
---
Turn 1 Bloodclaw into Turn 2 Coin+Hench Clan Thug is considered Hanging Dong with this deck
---
Thanks for the nostalgia, take my downvote
---
Additional trivia. Typing "There is no cow level" in the single player and campaign of original StarCraft and Brood War was a cheat to instantly win. In Diablo II there was a secret level, populated with cows called the "cow level."
---
Again listen to what I said, it made release feel directionless, I completed the quest and that was it, then I had just a few impactless cards against a ladder of people playing bomb warrior. 
---
And you obviously have never played with a limited collection, deathknights, quests, weapons, these were all far more fun to play with.
---
So much money is thrown at the game today that we would be ignorant to think the suits don't fuck with the drop rate on  launch day. Google patents by Activision and EA and you'll see patent after patent of predatory microtransaction behavior. I guarantee you they mess with it on launch day
---
117 common 1 golden = 635 dust
---
39 rare 3 golden = 1080 dust
---
11 epic = 1100 dust
---
1 legendary = 400 dust
---
total : 3215 DUST value in 35 packs ( 3300 gold 1 brawl pack + quest pack ) feels bad man
---
I’d suggest making whizzbang for your “meta” deck.
---
Never gets boring and his decks aren’t half bad. It’ll only cost you 1600 dust.
---
Yes!! I got like 5 in 20!! RNGesus really loving us today! I too had unpacked Moorabi and Nat, as well as Dr Morrigan and Myra...
---
it will grow with time
---
I beat a couple bomb warriors with a pogo rogue. Unfortunately I lost most other match-ups though
---
there probably isn't a plan to rotate out classic, as that's kind of the idea of classic.  you'll probably be seeing more and more new decks as we move forward, the main problem on day 1 is that some people just don't have the new cards, or enough to make a deck.  as for creative decks,  I'm currently running a weird otk goblin prank deck which I started running a few days ago for fun, and it actually turned out to be half decent, I won 23/30 games pre rotation.  it lost 5 cards, none of which were a part of the otk so I swapped out some of the cards and it doesn't run any of the new cards, I have dust so it's not like I can't craft myself decks but a) I prefer not to net deck as I like making my own weird decks b) I hardly have any cards to work off of and I'd prefer not to use my dust to make a whole deck
---
I think the update where cards would stick on top of each other in hand was much worse.
---
This is my second turn 8 OTK in a row.  Master's Call tutors all your stuff, helpless hatchling reduces costs and then Hunting Party doubles it.
---
That is not cool, it's always 40 and they usually do a pity counter of 10 on first opening on new expansion. I missed the last 2 or 3 but i wonder when they changed it.
---
ooohh, nice. And I will get him golden. I always wanted a golden hero+portrait.
---
i agree. he's definitely a lot of fun when an expansion is new, but once people start figuring out the optimal decks, and once you've started to get a taste of all the cards and can see which whizbang decks are ok and which ones are garbage, it starts getting old and perhaps a bit grating if you keep queueing in the bad decks.
---
It’s part of the Boomsday expansion. You can either craft it or get lucky and open it in a pack.
---
Each time I go back to my deck list it has more weapon removal, first Harrison now an extra ooze lol those wrenchcaliburs are evil
---
Your opponent played Rafaam, transforming the bombs into legendaries. That's why your Boom didn't trigger. Think a bit before screaming 'bug'.
---
When was it? I think I've missed it.
---
Fenrir16#1818 NA looking to trade 80g quest, I show you go first

According to the wiki, which also includes the fact that blizzard is required BY LAW to reveal pack rarity drop rates, its 1 in 20.  So... Based on the legally required information released i pity timered, and if the pity timer is indeed 1 in 40 then blizzard needs to fix their game.
---
Beta.  I'd also put the updates where your opponent could hard-lock you as worse.  Pyro/Mark and Radiant/Visions.

Such a good one too!

Rez Priest seems to require really good rng to be favored in the matchup. Handlock just gets stomped and token druid is maybe 50-50. It's definitely feeling like the deck to beat right now and im not sure how to do it.
---
The druid tree deck the previous expansion was actually pretty great...  Whenever i play whizbang decks,  i always hope to get that deck since its fun to play mid range decks, and its not as oppresive against the opponent

This reminds me of the long tradition of WoW killers "Aion is coming, WoW is done", "SwTOR is coming, WoW is done", "STO is coming, WoW is done", - member "we are not on Azeroth anymore", yeah well turns out they are not on the market anymore. It went on for years and years. Eventually the only one still standing with strong profits is still WoW, despite all failings and issues.
---
You can complain about the Blizz products all you want, but they do know how to put out something that will last long and bring in money big time (except for you HoTS, you go into the corner, you are adopted)
---
This is pure hyperbole. No one would get fired over something this trivial
---
They already had nerfed master of diguise and conceal.
---
And the fact that you think basic math is how you compare the various monetization strategies between the various DCGs on the market shows that you have little understanding of how to accurately do so. There are so many differences in the way they do things that simple comparisons do nothing but show comparisons between specific use cases.
---
For instance, without even diving too deep into this, you are using the prices of the most expensive pack option, which isn't the most sensible way to compare them. More importantly, you didn't at all compare that to the card prices in other games. And finally, you did not make any sort of comparison to how many of what types of cards a person would need when making certain decks.
---
These are three things that complicate the comparison you were just trying to make quite a bit that have drastic significance on what a final price may look like, and these aren't even scratching the surface in regards to how many variables factor into these comparisons.
---
Right!
---
That’s not how that works.
---
We saw gameplay of a lot of below par decks but those aren’t defining the meta.
---
prepare for a jeppeto malygos velen combo that works 3 times in a row.
---
He took 2 bombs next turn into his hand.
---
Same
---
Healladin works as an OTK imo with the death knight... Rip deathknights BTW
---
Lol emeriss is only good outside of hunter tbh
---
50% It either happens or it doesn't.
---
i would be more than happy, you get to pick any leg at that point vs getting anything else ande only 400 dust, this is a really great bug tbh
---
Damn lol after it was all done I had about 25k
---
As this is an issue that still hasn’t been solved, I think this meme fits here perfectly.
---
https://imgflip.com/i/2y6r59
---
Would still craft it since the effect is basically 18+ decks in 1

Read it again:
---
&gt; China is, by law, requiring games which feature random drops purchasable by money, to publicly release the drop rates/statistics for those random drops, effective May 1, 2017. This includes Hearthstone.[11]
---
&gt;
---
Blizzard complied with this law on April 2, 2017, by making a post to their Chinese forums.[12][13] The officially announced drop rates are:
---
RARE - At least 1 rare or better in each pack.
---
EPIC - Average of 1 every 5 packs.
---
**LEGENDARY - Average of 1 every 20 packs.**
---
And my comment:
---
&gt; Pity timer is 40... **20 is average**. So you got an above average rate of legendaries.
---
I'm guessing you don't know what a pity timer is? Pity timer means after you've opened a certain number of packs, your next pack is *guaranteed* to give you a pack, "out of pity". Otherwise, say you had a 5% chance to get a legendary in every pack. Same average of 1 per 20 packs. But you could theoretically open unimaginably large numbers of packs without ever opening a legendary. So in comes the pity timer. That does *not* have to be disclosed, but the link you gave (and clearly did not read) goes over the methodology that has been used to determine that the pity timer for legendaries is 40 packs, meaning if you've opened 39 consecutive packs of one set without getting a legendary, your next pack of that set is guaranteed to have at least one.
---
50 packs from preorder: $50  
---
10 packs from Shadow bundle: $10  
---
2 free packs  
---
35 packs from saving my gold over the last expansion  
---
97 packs
---
Got 7 legendary cards + 1 free one for buying the preorder
---
Also got 20 epics.  
---
Not bad for $60 bucks. TIME TO START SAVING THAT GOLD FOR THE NEXT EXPANSION!
---
I then opened another 70 packs that I bough and found another pack that contained 2 Legendaries....

Also OTK is my least favorite deck type so that's just a further kick in the balls.
---
I see some more cultured individuals. Murloc shaman is so fucking great and I love it. I’m gonna post my build I’m still working on it though
---
52 packs, 2 legendaries
---
Dude you don't knows who he is. Remember that some countries have a devaluated coin value. So for them a hundred dollar could be a lot more info their local currency. The fact that Blizzard doesn't have that into acount sucks, and many people that want ti spend Money on the gane can't cause it's too expensive. And if they make the effort it would be Nice that said effort is rewarded. 
---
True, it's a gamble but the monetization is way too high for some countries and the rewards are Noe on par.
---
MAYBE in a control lock
---
Simple: same way you did it in Hearthstone. By lying.
---
It’s simply not possible to get all the cards in Hearthstone as a F2P unless you’re Kripp. Blizz’s own data proves that.
---
Nice!
---
Uncultured swine
---
Thank you! I’ll try that now
---
That would require Mechathun be the final card in your deck
---
What are you talking about? You can’t open up a Ragnaros or Sylvannas, when cards move to Hall of Fame you shouldn’t be able to open them anymore
---
Oh wait nvm
---
I forgot about her, I'll add her in!
---
One pack and got a legendary priest card. Too bad i dont play priest
---
This isnt even beating a dead horse at this point, it's like picking on the small kid
---
Geez this post plus the comments have convinced me to save my money and gold for a few more months.
---
&gt;A pack is $1.50. A pack is 100 dust. Epic cards are 400 dust, aka $6.00. Legendary cards are 1600 dust, aka $24.00.
---
only if you are buying 1 pack at a time. you can get 15 packs for 20$ for example. HS is expensive if you need to have everything now, but atleast be fair in your assessment...
---
Buying at the best price (not including special offers) a pack is 1.17$. If you dusted every card from packs you purchased (not including the legendary you are guaranteed in the 1st 10 packs) it would cost you about 19$ per crafted legendary. Note that this is also just about the worst way to go about gaining a collection in HS. you are much better off just keeping the cards you open and dusting dupes/golden cards.

---
Honestly if you're trying to beat hearthstone... being greedier than hearthstone is not a good strategy.
---
My #1 complaint with hearthstone is that spending money on it feels like throwing money into a hole. And I've spent like $400 on it. But $50 should get me an entire expansion, not just enough to get started.
---
Artifact looked interesting when it was first announced, but it turns out it's even *worse* value-for-money than hearthstone. Fucking no lmao.
---
sorry, didn't know this sub is for pro players.
---
Oof
---
I played 7 games before work today and 4 of them were against bomb warriors (all running identical lists)
---
I opened 7 packs as f2p and got master boom legend on the 6th pack and a golden rare on the 4th pack. Also got several other rates and one epic.
---
RIP Frog the Jam.
---
Naw
---
I got 14 normal and 1 golden in 213 packs. Two of the packs had two normal ones. I definitely high-rolled this expansion.
---
I would rather run muck morpher memes all day than slog through the half-shudderwock atrocity from past expansion deck recipes that they are referencing.
---
To be fair, we got more dust value in this expansion than in Kobolds. 
---
For Kobolds we got a Marin (0 Dust value) and a legendary (400 dust value), unless it was golden (1600 dust value), I can’t remember.
---
In this expansion, we got a golden legendary (1600 dust value). 
---
You could make the argument we got even more value, four times as much even, with this expansion than in Kobolds.
---
Good? Probably not.
---
Fun? Hell yeah
---
So far I haven't lost a ranked game with it, but I'm not high in tier at all.
---
I tried it out in zoo and control lock. It’s not great but it’s okay. Makes for some fun games though.
---
That was a unique issue with tri-class cards being 3x as likely, not anything to do with rarity drop rates or pity timers.
---
Legit the best legendary in the game, made only better if it was evergreen
---
[There for a reason!](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bbafn9/rise_of_shadows_pack_openingrewards_megathread/)
---
Got one in my 2nd pack, too bad it's the murlocs cost 1 one :(
---
I haven't had a chance to play today but midrange murloc is the first deck I wanted to try, glad to hear it's doing well.
---
Have you thought about adding barista lynchen?
---
Here's my list if you wanna check it out: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/barista-murloc/
---
Rez priest is underwhelming. It loses to infinite value decks like shaman and warlock. Losing to otk hunter and bomb warrior as well. Does well against midrange and aggro but the meta does not work in its favor right now. I've been having good games with silence priest though. Haven't tried zarek priest yet.
---
Why wouldn't it be? It's just as much a Rogue card as it is a Druid or Shaman one.
---
Plus, it's interaction with one other card in particular does not make it broken in arena.
---
Can confirm it does not give any sort of notification on mobile but does on pc
---
In K&amp;C we were only given 400 dust value.
---
Marin (0 Dust) + Class Legendary (400 Dust)
---
In this expansion, we got 1600 dust value
---
Golden Legendary = 1600 Dust
---
So you could easily argue we got 4x as much value with this expansion than we did in K&amp;C. And on average, I’d always take a gold legendary over a regular and a 0 dust meme-ish legendary
---
Shouldn't downvote for proof, guys.  OP delivered and we all benefited from kug's request.
---
I opened 8 legendaries and 17 epics from 92 packs. Easily my best launch haul ever.
---
I've opened 65 of my packs.  Somehow, I've acquired 14 epics.  I also got the two Rogue legendary minions, Swampqueen Hagatha, and the Warlock rusher guy.   I guess your only choice is to buy 80 packs once more.
---
hm, but im not seeing MTG Arena in the picture.
---
Really cool card! Completely overlooked him last expansion. Just played my first ever match with a full golden deck :b
---
Would have been better if you had Leroy instead.
---
Same tho first craft this expanansion
---
Diablo Immortal will get $$$$ from Asia, doesnt matter that US audience did not like this.
---
did joey jump into ocean to get that cards back?
---
naw vargoth is pretty trash
---
Artifact as a concept was actually pretty fun, but it was marred by a large number of factors.
---
[One more for good measure](https://m.imgur.com/mJ8kk5j).
---
I honestly don’t know about that card need more time
---
What heavily aggressive creatures are they throwing out?
---
Imagine if they hadn't nerfed Dr Boom's scheme before release..
---
Hope you got some good ones at least. I got 3 in 50 but they were khadgar, swamp queen and the druid 2 drop so I wasnt too tilted
---
The one game that actually was a Blizzard killer is Path of Exile. Diablo 3 can't even remotely compare to PoE
---
2 golden blood of the 🅱️ancient one
---
Kinds interested in the deck you made too lol. But honestly the shark does match well
---
I'll respond to your points 1 by 1 
---
Oh no I dont get another useless jpg
---
?
---
Vargoth
---
First wing is free you can earn the rest with gold
---
The standard $50 for 50 packs still exists (you even get a legendary)+ I like the new hero
---
Really. You'd have to be a fool to not notice how much more expensive has gotten over the expensions. But hey, let them make that sweet profit on a game losing all it's audience, right?
---
Star Trek Online maybe
---
Don’t worry guys if bomb warrior is too oppressive in three four weeks time they will nerf the bomb damage.. my money is on 4 dmg per bomb
---
Would Vargoth double this or give the basic 1 armor?
---
Yes they make it easier for people contribute, so much so that it pushes people to contribute more. Thats their job. And I agree its a fine balance that in some games can feel impossible for a f2p player and a bad business model.
---
 I personally dont feel like hearthstone has been impossible for me to play as a f2p player, and I played when the rewards were fewer in between and all the adventures cost money (or high amounts of gold). 
---
But if you feel that way i would advice you to stop playing from now on.
---
 It is a ridiculous standpoint to complain about getting something for free because you feel entitled to more. It is greedy.
---
I dont want to discuss this any further. Good luck to you.
---
I had 27k but crafted some stuff.
---
Low
---
I made my own deck. I still got curbstomped by Bomb Warrior, Burgle Rogue, and well that was it because all I faced was Bomb Warrior and Burgle Rogue.
---
Just have to keep one on board ( shudderwock as their is the 4/4 battlecry gain stealth until next turn)
---
I would recommend taking out topsy turvy and putting in twilights call. Topsy doesn’t really Synergize with your deck because you’re not running divine spirit and the highest health minion you have is catrina at 8
---
Same rip
---
Where does that “1/20 average” stat come from?  I’ve never seen anyone back that number up, and anecdotally it’s closer to 40 for me.  Same when watching streamers open packs.  Source that for us.  I don’t believe that number for one second.
---
nobody beats the Whiz
---
If you can use the dust, go ahead. The chances of a nerf are tiny to any given card and honestly not that big of a payoff.
---
Hey man, I feel you. I felt the same when they plopped Mecha-Jaraxxus behind a paywall and I couldn’t afford it.
---
But I picked a single class to play, spent my dust wisely, and I was able to play a ton of different decks.
---
With my HOF dust, I just crafted Whizbang. We’re getting another version of him soon as a reward for the solo adventure... I’d recommend saving gold for that.
---
Yeah Witch's Brew into Krag'wa makes Control Shaman absolutely insane in fatigue. It's like Forbidden Healing on crack. Just happened to win a fatigue war against a warrior who had 70 armor. 
---
Also, Hecklebot and Shudderwock are a couple made in heaven.
---
ffs it hasn't even been 1 day. ofc things will look fresh after a rotation.
---
&lt;3
---
Welcome to the first day of every expansion 
---
Ps. I still haven't played against any warriors

2/-/- | Give a minion "Also damages minions next to whomever it attacks."

Hearthstone will kill itself the same way WoW is in the process of doing. The game is painfully stale, you can't really be a fan of CCGs and think HS is the pinnacle of good design, gameplay, and monetization. 
---
Since we're doling out dunkings let me remind you that at least 75% of you reading this only continue to play the game out of *sunk cost fallacy* + *WoW Nostalgia*, things that keep you chugging along in HS even though you don't enjoy it half the time.  You play a game for bad reasons, think about that.
---
141 packs, 10 legendaries and 1 golden legendary
---
Yes
---
Praise Brode!
---
Forget the OTK. Greedy Shudderwock with Hecklebots is the real deal.

I did exactly that with topsy turvey 🤦‍♂️ thank you!
---
Could not use it, it only appeared in wild, still seems as like it was unintentional.
---
Problem with mage is that it requires too much RNG. If you don’t overpower your opponent in 9-12 turns chances are you aren’t lasting a lot longer. I also think that having FLJ was the only reason mage used to be playable

Got 5k too. Finally was able to craft Zilliax! I'm pumped for the game again. Feels awesome.
---
Among my friend group autochess is very popular, while I'm the only one who has played actual dota 2.
---
I nearly beat someone in arena only for them to play the evil rat thing get the spell lackey and get mortal strike for lethal...
---
Something.
---
I think with charged devilsaur it's a little different because when recruit warrior became popular this card was played a lot for the face damage
---
A lot of the people who got 10k+ also spent 5-8k crafting cards so they basically just got the cards for free for wild.
---
Keep in mind that there are a lot more filler cards in MTG then Hearthstone. I still feel like it's easier to make a tier 1 deck in Hearthstone then MTGA.

---
Just finished my first night's expansion ladder run - climbing from **rank 24 - 16** (I skipped ladder this last season, so RIP rank) I played:
---
**Kripp's Bomb Warrior (removed 3/3 rush worgen for 1 swamp ooze)**
---
15W , 3L - One loss to big / silence priest because I didn't mulligan for a Brawl and couldn't draw one to save myself from the flood of 4/7's and silenced 5/6's. Two losses to Espionage, Spectral Cutlass Rogue. The first loss to Rogue I immediately teched in a weapon removal, which saved me against what would have been a few instant loses down the line. 
---
**Trump's Murloc Shaman**
---
2W , 0L - Fun deck, but after two games I got the feeling it wouldn't hold up the higher I got in ladder, and switched back to Bomb Warrior since I was more interested in playing that deck longterm.
---
So far, Bomb Warrior seems ridiculously strong, I spanked the few zoolocks / aggro pali's, easily outvalued Big Priests, spell mage, etc, but the mirror matchup - while fun -  did feel like my wins came down to RNG card draw (who got wrenchcleaver + elekk first etc). Didn't play any druid's, only 1 other murloc shaman, and no hunters. Espionage rogues however, were a serious problem and the absolute hardest matchup for me. It'll be interesting to see how it stacks up in rank 10 and below.

---
Is it just me or token druid really seems OP
---
? Why would a combo only possible in wild make shield block leave standard. And even if it was in standard that wouldn't mean shield block being hofed.
---
It was only a dead card in hand for 23 turns.
---
To avoid touching a standard card?
---
I had to close out my game and reopen it to have them pop
---
Almost all are playing all golden cards and mostly it's the murloc Shaman and agro mage Wizzbang decks I've encountered. Floated around rank 20-17 today
---
It also kills doomsayer for free...
---
Hey now, it's not abandoned, do you not have phones?
---
Yeah but Artifact didnt have a slow decline in players. The game hemmoraged players. It was only released 6 months ago.
---
Maybe you cast “Create Archmage Vargoth” on this turn.
---
Magic has always been around and better, it's just been absent from the digital market until now. I think of it as your successful older brother moving back after years in Africa and stealing stealing your job, home, and girl. And your response is to just sit there and do nothing.
---
I beg to differ with your hasty generalization. We have a veryhealthy Hearthstone community here in the Philippines but even the 50 preorder cardpack is equal to  about the 1/2 a weeks wage here. So people need to save money to get those packs. And I don't think my country is an exception in this in Asia.
---
Yeah, basically you give control warrior a real wincon besides fatigue. Everyone seems to be playing it at ranks 4-3, including me
---
Good point, but the Eredar Lord can have himselves on the board. Ha !
---
TWILIGHT DRAKE GET DOWN
---
Some of the new whizbang decks actually run tech. I think Harrison Jones is in some of them at least.
---
Contact Blizzard, I think you might be able to get some kind of compensation. You can contacg them ghrough live chat
---
&gt; Hungry Crab
---
Rotated out.
---
Playing cancer thief, bad manners man
---
Blame Blizad!
---
I mean, if he wasnt going to rotate it would be the perfect investment because even when he gets tired after an expansion you just hold onto him until the next and boom.
---
With only a year of life left, yeah it makes it a lot harder to justify over competitive cards
---
Maining Priest and Warlock, the lack of early clears was a bit jarring, but after adjusting I'm glad they're just in Wild now.
---
It's random. You will get one of blizzard's preexisting recipes. 3 possible decks per class may be chosen. You can view them beforehand by creating a new deck for any class and pressing on the corresponding deck list you would like to research.
---
Any suggestions?

MTGA will be abandoned long before it takes over hearthstone. Just like every other digital MTG adaptation.
---
I’m pretty sure Burglar just discovers spells. How did you get Nozari off of him?
---
I just got over half the cards in the new expansion (including 4 legendaries) by buying 30 packs using gold I made in the game.
---
Swipe face (4), play goblin bomb (2), Ysera awakes (2), trade, Hero power? 4+2+5+1 = 12?
---
That's not even that many warriors
---
It's actually so refreshing, great improvement in my opinion
---
They should make him classic next year
---
Oh wait did I put HCB? I meant Pilfer lol
---
It’s common knowledge. 
---
Spellstones don’t keep their intermediary upgrades either. However when they’re fully upgraded they become different spells (difference art and name).
---
Opened a golden Oblivitron in my second pack. Probably going to be turned into a Boommaster.
---
Hard mode: Don't open any of your rise of shadows packs (preordered or not) until the end of those five days.
---
Yeah, most people... Sure
---
Ehhhh I don't really think that's what sank it. 
---
What sank it is that it's expensive, and people are already invested in other games - mostly hearthstone. Personally, I thought the gameplay looked interesting but I'm not gonna pay $20 *just to find out* if I like it, and then start from scratch on my collection again in an economy that for some reason is even more expensive than hearthstone.
---
I’ve got 16 decks made on day one. Played 5 of them 😂😂
---
Nice work broski!
---
No it didn't...
---
Blizzard will now include past sets in arena in a rotating fashion. I believe we currently have mean streets and naxx.
---
Outstanding move
---
Can you explain to me what happened? What modding?
---
Eh that stereotype is very wildly overblown. Wild gets a bad rep because of the cancer decks like Big Priest and Odd Paladin, but I always hang out between ranks 15-5 and I hardly ever see any of those after the first 2 days of the month. 
---
In fact I'll rarely see the same deck twice on any given day. Most people playing Wild are trying to have fun with crazy brews and fun meme decks. All of the ultra competitive people generally either stay in Standard or hang out in the 5-legend bracket anyway.
---
Only for for one set. From the next after this it would be "Also damages minions next to whomever it attacks" again.
---
Hey now don’t forget about r/Lightseekers we sometimes get 15 viewers when a big streamer is online. 
---
Our 4th set of cards comes out this quarter :(
---
You use that card on an enemy minion, the new two ones summon for the opponent or for you?
---
Hearthstone is committing sudoku.
---
Disenchant and craft new one
---
Just to add some clarification to this. The bombs are cast, but you don't cast them yourself. They are cast for the player. Most cards that work off of spells that a player has cast or played, only count cards that were actually played from the hand. Not cards that were cast by other cards.

&gt;And that is mainly because they have years of paper cards and popularity backing them up
---
How about because MTG is a great game?
---
Good to know.
---
Check the maly druids. Both are the same and nasty as hell. Gepetto makes for real quick kills
---
F2P player too here. Just save up your gold/dust and wait until the meta stabilizes and craft a good deck
---
It kinda does tho.
---
Rng is strong with this one XD
---
i heard garfield insisted on this economic model though

If Arthas and Lich King counts then Ragnaros should too

ok then don't lol

“We have purposefully trained him wrong, as a joke.”

---
Playing that twinspell on a Cairne, previously discovered by power of creation, is my moment of the xpac so far lmao.
---
magic arena is the real killar
---
are you missing any core cards from any of the sets?
---
I dusted all of the few legendary I had (I started during Boom) to craft him upon knowing his existence, never regretted since
---
Yep. I just spent 12 hours playing variations on Togwaggle. Burgle seems to be the best shell, so Burger King rogue is up.
---
Why would they not be included?
---
Crafted even shaman and was working on odd paly next. Guess I'll be switching to wild soon because I won't have the cards or dust to play standard anymore.
---
The Wild Secret Mage is completely sans RoS cards. Yay for innovation?
---
What is the arena change?
---
They forgot to ban all the cards. Faceless summoner is also unbanned for no reason.
---
Way too early to tell what legendaries are going to be good in the long term, i'd wait at least a week before asking that.
---
Mono red aggro could easily get a game in in 10-15 minutes
---
My guess it's something with the coding. Like it doesn't notice Spell Damage. But rather that the card will deal more damage than normal and thus shines. 
---
As Hagatha's schemes doesn't even have a "normal" amount of damage and no limit really, one more damage is acceptable to that card and thus doesn't get the spell damage glimmer.
---
Nice. [You forgot one, though.](https://i.imgur.com/TcDWtWZ.jpg)

I‘ve only opened Classic and RoS sets so far. I was thinking about buying 10 packs from each set I haven‘t bought yet so I get a guaranteed legendary?
---
Shadow Word: 4-bidden
---
so why do i get three overloads? its both when you cast
---
Nomi
---
Obviously, hitting them dirty with chef nomi 😎
---
Blizzard is rotating the card pool in arena twice an expansion, so the card pool remains fresh and older cards will make an appearence again.
---
That makes sense..remember we will get some packs from older expansions in the upcoming daily quests
---
Arena no longer follows the standard cycle, and instead is going to be mixed up between expansions throughout HS's history. 
---
* Curse of Naxxramas
---
* Whispers of the Old Gods
---
* Mean Streets of Gadgetzan
---
* The Witchwood
---
* Rise of Shadows
---
So a completely different type of game
---
Win condition is basicly draw all your card and then pray to the god that enemy cannot hadle Nomi.
---
I have the hero boom
---
Opened 17 packs. Collected coins for them since the announcement of RoS. Opened Nomi and Bad Warrior Legendary...
---
 Why would you do this to me blizzard?
---
I just wish they wouldn't sell 3 packs for 3$ in the shop. That is the worst offender.
---
Yup do that first then figure what type of decks you want to play and build toward that. Wait for meta to settle
---
Jade was my fav, as F2P, playing jade meant instead of requiring 3 classes worth of cards I only needed 1 :")
---
Don't know where can I ask. 
---
Does Tess trigger the fantastic treasure?
---
This happens for me too. I'll send u an image
---
It is a good game, correct. I didn't feel the need to say it though.
---
there's pretty much nothing you could print that would make this card good without breaking the game.

Quite a few people are playing control / big shaman. All the overload stuff is coming into its own out of the mammoth shadow. One thing I've been experimenting with is a small murloc package (tastyfin, underbelly angler, scargil, ghostlight angler and warleader currently, but I may cut the warleaders and scargil may not be necessary (but sure as hell is fun)) in a more control orientated deck, because it provides a lot of value against other slower decks and you can pretty much stick up a board from nothing. Other than that I have some overload stuff and control tools, + a bloodlust to close out game with my murloc boards.
---
well i did play it...gameplay is shit too...because Garfield didnt help much in game development...he just pitched core mechanics
---
It is, because otherwise old school mtg players wouldn't play MTGA, that's the issue MTGO had.
---
I've several thousand dollars of cards here in my appartment, why would i spend that money again to just have a worse and smaller version of the same thing?
---
The moment it's very f2p-friendly and i can just do it as an added bonus to card magic, you can count me in. Aaaand that's why my friendlist is full of MTG players that play MTGA.
---
[Now with mint flavor!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yvit1jnercw)
---
Of course I opened both mage legendaries
---
I like new arena.
---
I am not saying anything against the new expansion its way too early for this :D 
---
But i think about the gut i played yesterday that there are cards similar to the old ones to clear or fill the Board.
---
Today my opponent played bomb warrior and I draw a boom for 13 times from my deck and overhealed them with Whizbang Shaman lol
---
You should have crafted the cards before the new expansions. They were basically for free.
---
How are the schemes in this? Feels like a very board orientated deck to be running them.
---
\- All
---
\- Cherrypicks examples when proven wrong.
---
Outstanding Move.
---
Yup.
---
Jesus Christ dude I imagine this is something you’ve typed up before but regardless thank you so damn much, cheers for being so welcoming :)
---
I guess, fun is relative. I don't see what is fun in playing decks you can't tweak, decks that are by default worse than an average one you can make yourself and you can't even choose which exactly you want to play.
---
I'd rather have 1-2 cheap budget decks than a Wizbang. But then, I do have dust for like 3-4 fresh and new decks, so that's what makes me satisfied. If I was really, like REALLY short on dust, Wizbang would be more tempting. If you are a new player who is still learning, sure, it's also a great card to make.
---
Wow...
---
There are literally no safe legendaries, there are ones more probable to see play (I don't know which ones) but I would wait to craft anything until a week or two in unless you want to experiment with different decks at the start.
---
Yikes
---
5$ *maybe* gets you 1/30th of a top tier deck in hearthstone...
---
Summoner was banned because it was a common class card so it would potentially show up everywhere, but not that the bucket system is implemented this isn't really an issue.
---
He can't do math
---
NA
---
Oh fair enough, I thought you were saying there are no answers to the boom bots!
---
My point is that board clears and board damaging spells are fine, however plague and scream punished you SO heavily for playing small minions that it just felt awful. Them rotating is so amazing for the game.
---
No i play on a windows desktop
---
Dhikalol#1439 NA I'll show, you go first :)

No problem, I have this sheet indeed saved up and update once in a while. If you play on EU you can add me for more immediate help ingame (Timboron#2929).

To be fair gwent is a really good game now, I didn't know anyone who actually believed that it could kill hs when it first game out besides maybe the most diehard fan boys of cdpr or the people who just have an irrational hatred of hs for whatever reason. 
---
At launch it was far to complicated to pick up the truly casual players. Before midwinter they had the gold immunity changes and that fixed a ton of problems with the game, then they released midwinter and royally fucked everything up.
---
The re-release changed everything and although the twitch numbers aren't great I feel like gwent has enough of a following to stay afloat and cater to the audience that doesn't like hs or mtga. I personally enjoy all 3 games for different things and options are always good.
---
Imagine to losing to someone with dr booms scheme...there would be a lot of cussing involved
---
Rexxar is gone now buddy
---
which region...?
---
Blastmaster Boom is way too OP. If you clear the board you get lots of damage and if you can't anything you put on board will also get lots of damage. Not enjoying this few games I've played. Classes seem very imbalanced.
---
EU
---
Are you new here? Blizzard has never even buffed a card, let alone changed it because it was too bad. There are absolutely awful cards in every expansion, this one's a common so it's really not that bad. Feels worse if you open an awful legendary.
---
Seems to me day 4 at least could have had 2 RoS, to preserve the symmetry between the raven sets. Idk. Do these replace our normal quests? Cos if so RIP me I was going to play arena.
---
13 packs 1 useless legendary here
---
At least in HS you can get cards for free, sure takes quite some time but still
---
fastest way is to buy packs and disenchant them for dust
---
Sorry for missunderstanding haha! My english is not the best :D
---
Yeah for me its the Hero changing Cards like Frost Lich Jaina that were very demotivating :)
---
It was not better. You had to pay to play the game on anything that wasn't casual mode that no-one took seriously.
---
Path never had more than 150k players. I'm pretty sure that Diablo 3 was a massive financial success with millions of sales.
---
I wouldn't be surprised that a nearly dead-D3 still has similar numbers than PoE, just because of the massive size of Blizzards IPs. Diablo has the potential to reach a good 8-digits amount of players, if they'd do it right.
---
Also Path will never get out of it's niche. It's heavily marketed and designed towards their whales and without dumping serious work-hours into the game, you barely get anywhere. On top of that you need 3rd party tools out of the wazoo and spend up to 50% of your time on various website etc.
---
It'll never be your "every mans game".
---
"You gigantic goose! " is by far the best.
---
what about other sites, like forums? Players could just distribute their data and such on those sites as well
---
8 mana 18/6 charge, seems balanced
---
and reddit, right?
---
Ye  I was sarcastic. It obviously doesn't say "Upgrades each turn" ;)
---
If this is a joke it's a really bad one
---
Not this month. This MOTH. I got the Glitter Moth from the pack that they gave out today. A card that is supposed to be in Wild is still in the witchwood packs
---
Look at the face of that snake, she's scared af cuz it knows that's so illegal that it should go to hall of fame immediately
---
There's a meme on the WOW sub-Reddit that Jaina's a Dreadlord in disguise. No idea why.
---
Is 20 the max?
---
It's a joke, because the coin already costs zero mana on its own
---
i mean if he don't play wild he don't care
---
"Its a busy night but there always room for another"
---
You lied to us hearth. You lied.
---
After i saw the 3 board thing i didnt even try the game. Im not playing card games to be 100% invested in every second of the game
---
how is someone this entitled to another person's enjoyment. lmao grow up.
---
I doubt that would do anything. They still clear just as well with just a slower gameplan. Which since they have more clears than any other class it would still work.
---
I got rid of a Loot Hoarder instead for an Ooze. I don't really miss the card draw at all, but the 3/3 Rush is just too good removal to give up.
---
PRIMATIVE.
---
It's also just the simplest way to format the effect. It was a prototype for the Rush mechanic, probably before the code for Rush was finalized, so just having it be a battlecry was the easiest way to make it function. Side-effects happen.
---
Arazael#1958 NA, trading quest
---
I'd say that it's mostly due to the introduction of Omega Devastator as a means for "big" removal in the late game (for which you'd ideally wanted to save the Executes anyway). That said, I've seen warriors run both, so it's not like Execute is a bad choice.
---
Shitpost. If you really think he a traitor for playing a different game, you’re a lame.
---
If that specific deck is popular enough it may be very well worth it. Same as I were running golakka crawler everywhere in the pirate meta. Because then the 1% become a lot more %.  
---
But as of right now, I don't see many decks in the meta that would take you to fatigue and thus making Nomi relevant.
---
My best results have been weapon removal, to try and at least reduce the number of bombs...but yes, it is still ridiculous.
---
Worst of it is the RNG. Boom is just incredibly more frustrating RNG card, not only because of the Boom Bots RNG (which is even worse because there is more of them), but also because of the RNG of drawing/not drawing Bombs before you play him. He can be a regular boom if you draw them before, or he can be an insane boom if you don´t.
---
Also the fact that they can get additional bomb cards from hero power as well as the Omega spell is just...too much. Had a game right now where my opponent got lucky by getting 2 extra bombs (hero power+Omega), shuffled them into my deck, and I drew them right after another despite my deck having 5 more other cards in them and my hero power ready for 7 armor. Exact lethal.
---
The entire thing is just incredibly frustrating to play against. And before anyone starts with cards like Rafaam as counters...please. Be realistic.
---
In wild we have Enhance-o-mechano.
---
It's not exactly what you wanted, but it will certainly lethal your opponent a good bit of times! Lol
---
I played vs 4 warrior in a row and lost all of them. I joined and played as a bomb warrior to win, sad but true.
---
On the other hand, people keep complaining about consistency in Hearthstone, and full texts are very evil when it comes to that.
---
Nzoth and Twilight Call are written almost exactly, and yet behind the scene they function drastically different. Here is how I understand it:
---
Nzoth is programmed to look at the list of entities that died, and check their base versions for a deathrattle. Aka: "Does it have Deathrattle written on the card"
---
Twilight call, instead of copying N'zoth functionality, decided to copy the Priest spellstone functionality since they were both spells that resurrects several minions and were made in the same expansion. Then it will look at the entity for a deathrattle flag. 
---
On the other hand, I can be guarenteed that all cards with "Echo" works off the same function path, and should assume that cards worded similarly but do not use the keyword have different logic that makes them react to cards differently, leading to uncertainty
---
RAFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
---
#SUPREME OVERLOOOOOOOOOOORD
---
I spent 0$ got 100 packs with ingame gold and got 77% of this expansions' cards. Totally good enough for several meta decks.
---
I think you're really on to something that toxfin is good enough in a list that happens to produce some murloc tokens rather than only in dedicated murloc lists.
---
hopen’t**
---
Hey MCYalmighty, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
Bomb hunter and bomb warrior are mechanically two completely different things. They are linked by theme only.
---
And entomb
---
What?
---
Best combo is Rain of Toads + Volcano
---
Rafaam is insanely good in my Controllock deck, but you should wait.
---
sent request
---
"When Drawn" is already only two words and perfectly describes the effect.  Adding a keyword for it would only shorten card text by one word and would make it less obvious what the effect is.
---
Isn’t an infographic vertical and longer than an A4 paper? Like the content though.
---
I mean, in theory I like the whole idea, because now Control Warrior has an actual wincon besides grinding out the opponent on fatigue. The obvious downside is, we do not really have that much of a counterplay for that (as it seems for now at least). 
---
The biggest problem is, that many of the classes were cut off a good ways of sustaining through it with the rotation. So in many cases you have this feeling of an inevitable death coming at you.
---
put emeriss that could be fun
---
It will pass quite soon. It's popular because it's a new archetype so everyone wants to try it, and it also works somewhat. It's still not as annoying to play against as odd warrior, this one's at least mortal to good old working class damage and doesn't require a special combo to win against.
---
How is that anti bomb? It has no weapon removal, no deck replacement, and only form of life gain is a single weapon.
---
All you have is deck thickening which won't stop them out valuing you with mech creation and actual minions. You have no real win condition against them.
---
We get them at 17 GMT, like the first one.

r/rareinsults
---
Given the control warrior meta currently, I'd say no. Maybe after a good counter deck is discovered and they die down.
---
We have an orange president! We are *soooo* progressive and stuff!
---
You should keep wild cards because you might want to play wild in the future, and your getting an absolutely atrocious deal thanks to the disenchant ratio.
---
So we get double quests? Color me satisfied.
---
Kids always complain about p2w because they are flush with time
---
Oh that's right. i totally forgot about the arena rework. Yeah i guess you're right!
---
I’d suggest that your friend should wait about a week, to let the meta settle and let new deck recipes be made. It would be wasteful now to make something that gets outclassed in less than a month.
---
Good thing I don’t play arena, I would be fuming if my opponent pulled this shit with me.
---
Was I supposed to get a free legendary? I got the 2/6 spell guy and that’s all.
---
Maybe "when you draw this", like Aranasi Broodmother. It could be called something like "Unravel" and would work in an Ulduar expansion if that's next!
---
I smell a hunter player
---
Just wanted to. No real reason.
---
Hahah yep. I played the same deck and won almost every game on Turn 5-7 otherwise it was probably a Loss
---
Right but at the time the only way to avoid those synergies was literally by coding it in differently, which is what they did for the next set of cards
---
I think it might have been a hilarious card if it had the mad bomber effect though. Hold it for 20 turns, and 20 1-damage bombs go out, hitting minions and heroes on both sides of the board.
---
Treant druid is still there, its actually still great
---
Pretty Big Galaxy Brain strat. Well played sir.
---
Blitzarddddd
---
No that’s if they are hall of famed like this post, if they are just nerfed then you can get full dust for as many as you own.
---
Fair enough. Dust is hard to come buy if you don't buy/save gold for packs, and you're probably better off spending the 1600 dust on a meta legendary or 4 epics.
---
What is your list if I might ask? I was trying to make the deck work but I either did not have enough draw, or the healing was insufficient (or I was at full health), or it was too slow. And I really don´t know what to add to the deck to solve it.
---
Plus a free spell, so OP
---
You sure we live in the same timeline? It’s totally opposite from diablo announcement.   
---
Ppl were hyped and say this will be a HS killer when artifact is announced. It was only when they say is pay to play then ppl have second thought, and finally totally booed when they saw the monetary way they squeezing every cent from players and not to mention the lousy view ability on twitch when it launched
---
Is Arthas really the Lich King? Didn't he sorta die or sold his soul when he drew Frostmourne?
---
No, it really is not.
---
Druid felt terrible for me yesterday, it can't remove anything or stall now.
---
Big priest
---
Don't forget Jinzo
---
I had a game like this once. Druid Deathwinged me and I had no gas left in arena. There was a piloted shredder on my board though. It gets obliterated and out pops a patient assassin. "I conceed to you."
---
"Wow." "Wow.".... (Kills of the remaining Feugen/Stalagg) "Thank you" - (Mind Controls Thaddius) "Thank you"
---
It's windu up here
---
Well it's played in one of the best decks right now, so yes?
---
“We’re in the endgame now”
---
Wow, a card does exactly what it supposed to do. How is this even worth a reddit post?
---
Ok now magnetize them all together
---
ah yeah, my bad.
---
4 mana vs 4 mana. not that strong.
---
Next turn brawl?
---
i hate how they used this wording that was already used for other things, kabal and possessed lackey should also trigger togwaggle
---
this is "kabal potions" all over again
---
I reckon they'll add him to Classic, seeing as there's a few legendary spots missing (Sylvanis and Ragnaros specifically).
---
He's also good for farming the 3 wins gold, as you'll likely face another Whizbang deck.
---
He also entices f2p players to buy packs so that they can play non-randomised decks, which is beneficial for Blizzard money-wise.
---
Is that how this card works? I thought you spend all your mana as it says on the card.
---
Best hearthstone time is during rotation and new expansions. Meta is completely ruined, everyone is still figuring out the best decks and you run into so many creative and different decks for the upcoming days. Whenever I ran into a druid last week, most of them either played Malygos or Mechathun, but today I saw some crazy lad playing the new heal druid idea
---
Honestly it's not just you. Almost every viable deck from before the rotation was invalidated. Between my deck building experience so far and what I've seen of other people's decks, people are throwing together some pretty clunky shit lol.
---
That said I definitely wouldn't rush to craft anything especially with so little dust to spare. Give it a couple of weeks, we'll have a good idea of what's going to be worth the investment by then.
---
But the coin is always gold ^/s
---
"Shadow" word
---
This wouldn't be so bad if wasn't overdamaged and then thrown onto a weapon.  Why could it not be like a boom bot where it deals 1-4 damage but instead deals 5 damage. I just hope we didn't trade odd pally away just to be swamped with bomb warrior for another year.
---
Your friendly neighborhood, Microwave
---
Just play Aggro LUL
---
isn't he always wrong anyway?
---
OK, apparently I unintenoally stole your ideea and posted it here, great minds think alike
---
FF14 is not a WOW killer. It is just a shelter for WOW refugees.
---
it would be cool to do that, han'cho as the paladin villain, aya as the druid villain and kazakus as the mage villain, then we would.only need a character for hunter
---
Ya dude, I feel your pain. That’s rough
---
Evergreen post.
---
Wtf no it's Bolvar
---
There are no "best decks" now. There is no "meta". There is absolutely no way you can make that argument after 1 day of experimenting.
---
I did not ask what the phrase means. I asked what it means for someone to have the right to get snippy, and then I asked what my rights are. Please explain, officer.
---
thanks peter
---
Is back? Where did it go?
---
Odd Warrior was Control Warrior.
---
You won't UI...
---
I adapted the token druid list with treants that I had pre-rotation, and honestly it feels pretty much the same. Then I built ramp druid as I do every expansion to be honest, and it seemed mediocre at best. I'm so sad that they hit one of druid's unique characteristics so hard with the nerfs to wild growth and nourish. However, the legendaries are pretty good this set which hasn't happened since witchwood.
---
Another name for Crab Meat which is not actually made of Crab.
---
Mightymouse#1933 - NA - 80g quest trade, both show
---
This made me sad, when it draws well it's a lot of fun to play.  If. It draws well.
---
Back to Combo and Resurrect Priest I guess. 
---
Sigh.
---
Warrior with boom up is at a disadvantage against a hunter with rexxar up. Source: past couple of months.
---
I opened 81 for now, but in the first 60 odd I pulled EIGHT legendaries, with three of those being golden!!! Along with my additional golden legendary from the preorder + Archmage Vargoth, I essentially got 10 legendaries (4 Golden) in 60 something packs. 
---
I've never been so lucky, and since I opened another 20ish packs after my last one of that batch, I don't think I'm far off the pity timer for another. What a start to the new standard year :)
---
That's definitely Yu-Gi-Oh.
---
maybe tech in ooze(s)/harrison? helps a lot with both matchups.
---
Why are you so concerned with how other people choose to play the game?  If you enjoy crafting decks, fine, not everyone does.
---
Just because Team 5 isn't doing what you think should be done with the Rogue class, doesn't mean it's not a good direction to take the class in.
---
If anything, I like their attempt to actually make Burgle Rogue into more than a "screw around with me" deck.
---
The opponent, apparently. OP had just ended their turn, and the opponent can attack for 24.
---
It is probs a coincidence otherwise it would be more known that’s my thought
---
Funny how that's also the coin's sound
---
Ye, it was a smart play, but i still won:))  bomb warrior is kinda crazy rn
---
Same thing happened to me
---
Nostalgia
---
Mecha-Jaraxxus is Jaraxxus, but rebuild from what remained of him after he was defeated
---
Funniest thing is when two steal rogues face each other... HELP ME
---
Whizbang is a good choice right now before we know what the best decks are
---
hearthstone is also an expensive game. much more people play with it than artifact regardless. its not a problem.
---
and i dont even understand the point youre trying to make in the second paragraph
---
Oh yeah definitely, the Predatory Instinct / Crystal Stag / 1 of Witchwood Grizzly has been incredible in my playtesting.
---
You’re wiser than me, I disenchanted pretty much everything!  But I’m one of those people who finds 1 deck I like, builds it, and plays it nonstop— for Boomsday it was Recruit Warrior!
---
Ancient of Lore is... unique.  You’re right.  As a card it’s not amazing, but it offers Druid something that no other card does— on demand healing for that magic number of 5.  There are no other cards available to Druid that heal precisely 5 or more.  You can try your luck with cards like [[Potion Vendor]] or [[Darkscale Healer]] to see if you can hit 5, but it’s risky and probably not very likely to hit it, especially if you have 2-4 dormant Lucentbarks taking up your minion spaces.  [[Deranged Doctor]] is close, but the healing being on deathrattle is inherently risky— if you play it while your Lucentbarks are dormant, you give your opponent a free turn, but if you try and play it proactively, your opponent can clear it with removal and then you’ve wasted your Lucentbark healing— and running out of healing to revive your Lucentbarks is a very real possibility for the deck.
---
If I were you I would try those cards out as budget options and see how they do for you.  I think you’ll notice moments, if they arise, where Ancient or Lore might have been better.  But it’ll give you some more time with the deck and you can decide if you want to play around with it some more!
---
For what it’s worth I’m pretty optimistic!  I dunno if they’ll keep specifically Druid healing as an archetype in future expansions, but Blizzard has not abandoned Lifesteal as a mechanic, and they’re constantly printing common cards with Lifesteal and Healing effects, so even if it’s not specifically as class cards, this is a deck I see very possibly getting some fun tools in future expansions.
---
I had a lot of fun with it, looked at the deck list thinking about crafting it and realised how expensive it is. So many legendaries and epics.
---
I think same as you I'll craft it as long as it isn't terrible.
---
[HSReplay.net](https://HSReplay.net) and their deck tracker does so well for cards, classes, and deck, but not really players beyond yourself.
---
I've never really looked into following streamers and top competitive players though, so I wouldn't know anything about tracking their performance.
---
Am new plz explain

8/8/8 | Deathrattle: Restore 8 Health to your hero.  
---
Yup
---
What do you use to survive vs aggressive decks?
---
I've had decent luck in the admittedly few games I've played with my Dragon Paladin deck against Bomb Warrior. Putting a pair of 13/13 dragons on the board with the ability to Twinspell some lifesteal means recovery from their bombs.
---
Played 3 games with the deck and won 2 but lost 1 where Archmage Rafaam gave him 2 copies of Emeriss just before he went into fatigue and I couldn't cope with the big legendaries he had left.
---
Don’t give up yet, aleast now you can play 4 mana for 1 armor.
---
I'm playing the deck without Oblivitron and it does indeed seem extremely powerful. It's still early but it feels tier 1 levels of powerful to me
---
But...what are the chances...of all the spells the exact 3 ... seems weird to me
---
Well, you were the dumbass that didn't know how it worked. You can do whatever you want, but it was weird.
---
Yes you did. From your opponent's perspective the game is being played normally. His turn didn't go for 10 minutes, you roped them because you couldn't play. You need to reconnect if this happens, it's a common thing in arena
---
Ban humans
---
Similar ratio for me:  120 packs, 4 legendaries...
---
I mean, you don't know what the meta is yet and even the early stuff like Bomb Warriors and Tempo Rogues with 60% win rates cost 12,000+ Dust each. 
---
So really, you have no idea if you can make any meta decks.
---
Why don't you run more of the dragon package?
---
Why shouldn't they be?  Rarity != power.
---
I dub thee: Poggers.
---
Mech hunter gang rise up
---
Do you mind sharing your deck ?
---
and here i didn't lose with any aggro deck (secret pala, murloc shaman, token treant druid) i tried yet...
---
You still dead tho 😐
---
I think Mass can rez the same minion repeatedly if it died repeatedly, but haven't tested it myself.
---
I was saying I was excited to get a legendary. It was a bad one (The Beast), but still, it was awesome to get one
---
You can. The issue is getting a board of murlocs in that deck. It is not hard to remove a bunch of 2 health minions. Especially in warrior meta.
---
Cant be targeted by spells or hero powers
---
r/dankchristianHSmemes
---
I’ve been toying with a similar Valuetown shaman deck as well. I’ve no idea how but I’ve been cruising through my wins, even against Bomb Warrior. 
---
My list is far from refined, I’d try to mix a bit with your idea.
---
Every time I fail to draw a bomb from my deck I think to myself: "Oh crap, they are all coming clustered together"
---
He went for the extra BM points
---
Get more
---
Nice
---
To all the deck with broken DK. Now its your turn. Why whining already. Warrior suffered 2 year almost dissapear on ladder. Now just 1 day and you complain alreay
---
i really don't understand why you were downvoted, first of all it's an opinion that has valid discussion points no matter if you agree or disagree. 2nd of all i think some of the things you talked about are fairly objective or even undisputable.
---
i really don't get this sub sometimes.
---
hope you at least had a decent experience writing all this down, even if it didn't lead to a broader discussion.
---
Get an iphone
---
Playing on an apple device
---
You should NOT disentchant any of them right now IMO. Nobody knows which decks will be viable in 2 weeks so you should be patient and just play mediocre decks for now and finish your quests for gold
---
Kalecgos makes your first spell each turn free.  The coin is a spell so no other spells will get the effect.
---
This was a common mistake/misconception back when Dr. Boom (GvG version) was popular.
---
The animation made it seem like the boom bots were summoned first, so Rogues would vanish them back into hand thinking they could mill Boom. Then they got a rude awakening the following turn.
---
THX.
---
On Toasts stream a couple days ago, a dev talked shourtly about it. He said that it isnt going to happen, because they want to print cards similiar to whizbang in future expansions. The card given to you in the single player adventure this year is rumored to fall in this category by enabling you to play the decks of the evil bosses.
---
The irony is the right Zoo might actually be Tier 1 again, but if you look at hsreplay, almost no one is playing it.
---
Reviewers: Rogue doesn't has Taunts or Heals, so you can't build a value, control rogue.
---
/u/brrrl:
---
I wonder if it works if you put lifesteal on to something after it has the cleave buff, as it might just be a sequencing thing
---
I think they said in the reveal video that the only one that is limited is Rafaam's Scheme, because it has the physical board limitation. All the others just keep growing.
---
 I, for one, think idea to run Smoulderthorn Lancer (a dragon synergistic card) with Mad Genius (a mech synergistic card)
---
Overload is not like that, its part of the effect of the spell. Doesnt matter who casts it, or how it is casted, the spell will do its thing and then do the overload part (that is, making the owner of the spell get overloaded mana crystals).
---
Same happens when casting spells with electra, zentimo, kobold librarian, yogg...
---
You dont cast the spell, so "when you cast a spell" triggers dont trigger. But overload is not "when you cast this spell your mana overloads".
---
Even spirit bomb and wing blast don't see play really and they're much better than shadowbolt.
---
Nah. Shuffle five Elekk’s and fill your board with them, so then you can shuffle seven times the amount of Zilliaxes (Zilliaxi?) with the second scheme.
---
&gt;Four damage specifically to a minion really isn't worth that much, maybe two or two-and-a-half mana seeing as Shadow Bolt rarely sees play.
---
Great, so according to that, Vendetta is top tier because it´s 0 mana, not two-and-a-half
---
&gt;The condition too also completely limits Vendetta exclusively to Burgle Rogue, and much like with Crystal Stag, the asks of making a real Burgle Rogue deck are pretty serious. For one, it's a control counter deck in Rogue, which has historically meant its weak to aggression. Part of the deck is also reliant of generating at least decent cards.
---
Not really. You do not have to commit to Burgle/Control Archetype. Orange got Rank 1 Legend with a [Tempo Rogue](https://disguisedtoast.com/decklists/5491-r1-legend-tempo-rogue) featuring Vendetta, simply because you can just activate it with a few cards like Fox without commiting your entire plan to it. 
---
&gt;maybe on the same level as a Zilliax.
---
Zilliax is one of the strongest cards in Standard right now, it´s in so many decks because it´s nuts
---
Is that from disenchanting wild?
---
Truth, and something that (legendary MtG designer) Mark Rosewater talked about a lot: players think that they want more complexity in a game than they actually do.
---
did you really need to use both apps?
---
Expansion releases are always such a disaster...
---
Too many bombs?
---
It depends on which tier 1 deck. The cheapest MTG arena t1 decka are much cheaper than the cheapest hearthstone t1 decks.
---
ice block is a very recent HoF, wasn't in the first group
---
THE 🅱️ANCIENT ONE
---
&gt;&gt; Void Analyst
---
&gt; This card is certainly not terrible. I think you underestimate that little demon.
---
I've played it a lot in Whizbang decks last season, and started out with a deck recipe before I settled on my current zoo list so I had it in for a little while.
---
Void Analyst has never, ever impressed me.  Handbuffing some (but not all) of your minions, and doing it as a deathrattle so you can't handbuff something and play it on the same turn (which you often want to do cause Flame Imp and Voidwalker cost 1), is...just underwhelming.  My experience is that it hits maybe 1 or if you're lucky 2 targets.  Maybe it's ok if you have an almost pure demon build, but that's certainly not where I'm at.  And a lot of the "demons" you want to hit with this aren't actually hit by Void Analyst in your hand, they're spells like Rafaam's Scheme, or they summon demons like Hench-Clan Hag.
---
The 2 drop slot for zoo is also pretty crowded for me, anyway.  For instance, I agree with the Whizbang deck that Knife Juggler and Dire Wolf Alpha probably belong in the deck.  But I also have Hench-Clan Hogsteed (which has good synergy with both Knife Juggler and Dire Wolf Alpha) Scarab Egg, and EVIL Genius.
---
I can see the theoretical potential of Void Analyst where basically every card in your deck is a demon, and it sounds pretty good on paper.  But in practice it was like...8 targets (void walker, flame imp, doubling imp, doomguard) two of which you play before Void Analyst anyway.  And now it's like...six targets cause Doomguard is gone.  I guess still 8 targets if you run Jumbo Imp.  That's...not enough targets.
---
Dingelingeling! Und alle Atzen singen
---
i personally cut cutlass and tess for a more tempo focused style using the burgle cards with toggwagle as the big value swing
---
Midrange bomb warrior has a 64% wr with 44k games played
---
Too bad it costs 14k dust
---
I, for one, think idea to run Smoulderthorn Lancer (a dragon synergistic card) with Mad Genius (a mech synergistic card). 
---
In regard to his hero power, it is highly inconsistent and you can not guarantee it will land on a useful effect.
---
"We are both ventriloquists and now we're upside down"
---
Crowd Roaster is just too expensive in my opinion and with x2 polly, x2 Rush Wryms, x1 Doll, the deck is good on removal. You could run a roaster though if you wanted too, though I think if you run 2 it'll be really top heavy.
---
And we know pros never miss on card evaluations.
---
yeah pretty much
---
Yes, but if this happens please can I get the golden whizbang back that I already dusted?!
---
I've played all decks, aggro included. Murlocs are just the most synergy required form of aggro, highest highs, lowest lows. They rely so ridiculously high on certain draws and certain drops that when they win, it's by a landslide. But it's so easy to disrupt and stop that.
---
&gt;$50 should get me an entire expansion
---
I know that not everyone shares this feeling, but a big part of what makes CCGs fun for a lot of people is that first C. Giving out complete expansions kills that.
---
Yeah. Just the sets that recently rotated out
---
And all the cuss words are nicknamed “four letter words” cause they’re mostly all four letters. God damn
---
I hope someone can dig up this clip. He was on stream with Toast for a while.
---
4/20 hue hue hue
---
Wait. Sit on this dust for a week. It might be hard to do, but you'll be better off for it.
---
On the opposite end of the spectrum, craft a deck which seems like fun and you really wanna play. But be warned that it may not be as strong or playable even 2 days later. This is a dangerous time to be crafting in general unless you've experienced new metas before and can make those calls.
---
Jaina didn't start the war in BfA, Genn or Sylvanas did depending on who you talk to. Genn attacked the forsaken fleet in Stormheim, an act of war, and Sylvanas invaded Darkshore and burned Teldrasil, again an act of war. Neither side paints the other as having started the war.
---
I have to say, I crafted whizbang for this expansion and I am regretting it. I understand he is allowing me to experience decks I wouldn't have the dust for, but all of the decks just seem so ... bad. One or two of the ones i've played seem okay, but the rest just seem to lose to everything i'm going up against. Maybe I just need more time to get used to the meta, but most of the whizbang decks seem to instantly lose to bomb warrior, which is the only god damn thing i seem to be facing.
---
I only tried a mid-range spells hunter so far. I just don't know how you can get any value from Malygos with only 1 mana left after playing him, because you have no way of cheating him onto the board, no way of reducing his mana cost or even your damaging spells' mana cost. Just play him and pray for your opponent to not kill him next turn? Plus it nonboes with Master's call (which I called To my side! in my previous post, sorry) like hell, making it a "discover a minion" for 3. It is working indeed, because 55% winrate as said on hsreplay, but it probably won't last long in my opinion. I might be wrong, let the future meta validate or invalidate this theory
---
I'm finding secret paladin to be relatively weak so far this expansion. Whenever I match up with one I get excited because I know I'm more likely to win than lose. Granted it's been it casual so maybe that's why they're so easy lol.
---
"Shroud" is the appropriate MTG one, since since you can't target elusive with your own spells or hero powers either. Hexproof is immunity to enemy spells and abilities.
---
As a casual player I find him extremely useful in helping decide which cards to craft with my limited dust.  He lets you "try before you buy", instead of "craft with regrets".
---
My F2P account says that the first claim is simply untrue. You can pour money into the game, but you don't have to. Artifact gave you no option to play for free.
---
I love that card in my opening hand. ANY minion. I think it got overlooked in the spoiler. 9/10.
---
When they spawn 6 boom bots, it is pretty tough. Yeah you can thin our your deck, but 6 boom bots is around 15 damage, assuming you take no direct attacks. Add in the bombs and I think most of the time that is a win. 
---
Once people start running counters (weapon destruction, replace your deck with "X" cards) it will likely die off.
---
It's time RAFAAAAMMM. thanks for the free legendaries Bomberman.
---
That removal is so broken spend all yoir mana to destroy a minion
---
He plays Booms Scheme! Get him!
---
My big healidan finds the bombs amusing. Was just messing with it a little yesterday, but the 3 mana tudor while running duel and massive minions (smallest minion curve on 5) is handling quite well.
---
I'm already sick of the malygos. Spell hunter spa ked my rogue.
---
Here you go.
---
https://youtu.be/GPAsYTzi-iI
---
The card says "**when this attacks** and kills a minion" not only "when this kills a minion". It will work like gonk if you give him windfury, but wont work if you give him the cleave effect since he is only attaking once, eventhough killing 3 minions per attack.
---
I disagree that MTGA is more generous than HS. I f2p both games and Hearthstone is WAY easier. You have to remember that a pack in HS is much more valuable than a pack in MTGA. Also, the Wildcards system blows chunks.
---
I think the expansion quests are different than the day quests. The last expansion quest was set at 19:00 CEST so today a the same hour we will have the next quest, maybe?
---
I laughed hard
---
If you plan on investing money in Hearthstone down the line buying the adventure with cash is probably more efficient. 
---
Edit: someone did the math. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b12ci7/cost_of_new_adventure_analysis/
---
I mean, the game has a 45 turn (per player) hard cap, doesn't it? 
---
And I don't think you can have more than 60 cards in deck anyway, so capping this scheme doesn't accomplish much.
---
Damn, I got 9 Zilliaxes last night this way and I thought that was pretty good.
---
The pricing model is only part of what killed it. The game is also overly complicated for a mass market game and it's not at all stream friendly. Someone with only basic CCG knowledge can quickly pick up on what's going on in a Hearthstone game. The same can not be said of Artifact.
---
Boring!
---
And we kicked all their asses!
---
It says "when this attacks and kills a minion", and you only attaked once (and also killed a minion/minions) so the effect is fullfiled and you get one proc  of +2/+2. For multiple procs, sweeping strikes doesnt work, but windfury will work.
---
The batterhead will also work exactly like gonk if he gets windfury instead of sweeping strikes.
---
You could always try running that 1 mana burgle card that was added to the classic set. Might be too mulligan reliant to be consistent though.
---
Hey ZZent12, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
Parrot was iirc
---
I think they said they're not against printing more rogue secrets, but they don't have plans to either.
---
 10 legendary and 2 of them were golden.
---
Almost got the entire set
---
They did an all-gold card reveal stream for Un'Goro but there were complaints. People said it was hard to distinguish which class the card belonged to or if they were neutral. (It was also harder on colorblind people, apparently.)
---
The welcome pack is at the same level.
---
Nah, i wont buy packs or anything with money. I grind quests from time to time, thats pretty good.
---
I had an opponent use Underbelly plus ghost light angler 3 times in one game.  It's like Giantfin but without running the quest and losing your ever-important turn 1 play, it's insane.
---
They're pretty cool. I'm really tempted to go all-in with them and craft Togwaggle.
---
Lackeys are some of the best combinations of flavor and balanced mechanical power I’ve seen so far, honestly. When I saw the spoilers I thought they’d be average or underpowered, but they feel great!
---
The issue is a lot of the the rogue decks that Blizz is trying to make work are slower decks with a lot of set-up, and yet, rogue doesn't have ways of healing and armoring up. If it's, say a thief rogue, they have to have *some* tools to endure, because before RoS, thief rogue got absolutely creamed by aggro.
---
Heistbaron is pretty bonkers, and with that amount of dust it's a pretty safe bet. Unless rogue becomes a meme once the meta settles.
---
Out of curiousity, what the hell is Lifecoach playing these days? I'm guessing MTGA?
---
And that issue is only compounded by the price of entry. I imagine the game makes a ton more sense when you’re actually playing it, so if you can’t try it free first you may get too scared off by the intimidating ruleset to risk $20.
---
Because then you can take a screenshot of it, post it on the internet with a caption or title like "I got X copies of this card opening only 300 packs lol" and the earn some internet points
---
It's one of the strongest decks Whizbang has to offer, just look at [these stats](https://hsreplay.net/decks/0StdnCGITZFC8e0CnUrQ7b/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) for the murloc deck
---
Yeah it's a pretty good "tech" card vs bomb warrior if you can call it that.
---
I generally agree.
---
Meanwhile my thief priest is crying
---
Be honest. If they we're able to hold a scheme in their hand for 24 turns, you were losing anyway.
---
Checkmate!
---
I kept playing because the secret was vaporize, I was hoping to discover Mecha'thun from the Boom hero power and run it in. This became my game plan from about 10 cards left as it was clear I had no other way to win past the Rogue value generation.... I didn't discover Mecha'thun.
---
Yes I lost
---
I had the most success with Deathrattle Mech Hunter in Day 1 by a long shot. It seems REALLY strong.
---
It's got competition: but the name of that competition is MTGA. I'm *glad* Artifact failed because of it's cash-up-front, no F2P business model. We did not need to send that message to the industry.
---

Opened 70, and 7 legendary cards in total.
---
No pre-order, so they have all come out of the packs.
---
it's so you can very easily tell if the card is a class card or a neutral card
---
Dang, it's almost as if new is attractive or some weird case like that.

---
Artifacts gameplay is great way better than HS, some of the QoL features are far superior but the rest of the game which actually brings you back to play besides the gameplay is trash, 
---
Being a dota 2 player isnt enough to make me go back to Artifact despite loving the fact the lore is being expanded with each card
---
Yes I have hagatha. I didn't know she'd be good in a murloc deck since she'd kill off all my minions but it makes sense with getting all the minions on board and with underbelly it's not hard to refill my board..
---
CCG PTSD, GG
---
You're so cool bro.
---
Yea, after playing 15 more games, I cut saboteur for zillax, indeed
---
Sorry for spamming ladder with bomb warrior. It's the only viable deck I have until I can craft heistbaron togwaggle.
---
You dont need a lot of dust, many wild decks are cheaper than standard decks if you start from zero, and having some cards from rotation already helps (even warlock for example, only uses genn and then 6/8 epics, thats all, and its the second best deck of the format).
---
If you want to play decks that rely on strategies that were released years ago, like reno decks, then yeah. But you dont need to play all decks of the format, you play the ones you have. And keeping baku and genn instead of disenchanting them for 2 copies of an epic card in a standard deck is clearly not a good idea, unless you dont plan on playing wild forever.
---
I like the uther hero card but it's hard to get a 4 horse victory.
---
I got 2 packs when I login yesterday, one from the tavern brawl and I believe the other one is the rotating arena reward
---
It's better than shadow word pain but worse than shadow word death
---
I got my rewards ceedited silently upon log in without any notifications. Chances are so did you, but you missed it since there were no notifications.
---
Sap is currently the card Vendetta has replaced, so comparing the two is fair. A tempo deck is made to attack the opponent's tempo, and the two general archetypes that care about tempo the most are aggressive and midrange. It is largely doing what is intended.
---
Also, you forget that combo costs two cards in hand, not one. Sure, a card is generated, but nothing is guaranteed about that card. Flanking Strike probably probably could have been made as as what you described if it came with the drawback of having to discard a card too.
---
That still is not to stay Vendetta isn't a very strong card, it's just pushed and not broken.
---
And..... what about the release date?
---
Heads up, Greater Healing Potion absolutely saw play in slower Priest decks, it was one of their tools to stabilize against aggro. The difference is you didn't need to wait 11 turns with it in your hand to use it.
---
Alright, thanks lad
---
poisoned blade found a niche in wild even rogue at least.
---
Dragon roar or another acolyte
---
Thanks mate
---
Who parked their car....... ON MY SANDWICH

---
Yeah I cut the saboteur for zillax
---
Better than Brainstorm in phoenix or dredge
---
Nozari was good only when i pulled it with thief rogue vs secret pally and i was 5hp. Opponent conceded :)
---
Hs still does better than most/all card games.  It can’t compete with some of the more popular games or streamers like ninja for an extended periods of time without an expansion.
---
Meow meow im a cow i said meow meow im a cow
---
I think the problem is I started at rank 9.
---
As you said, bomberman seems to be a really good deck. The whizbang decks seem to almost purposefully hamstring themselves though. I understand that they can't be too good, but it just feels like they're all sub par
---
Sorry, I did not mean to imply literally that they were similar in playstyle, was just lazily typing out that it's prolly the main killer of Artifact.  A free to play, rapid paced (card-ish?) game with similar RNG and strategy decisions as any other strategy card game.
---
Ah it might be that, I didn't notice anything credited upon login in but that's perfectly plausible. Thanks for the head's up, cheers.
---
A lot of words in the English language are pronounced differently than they're spelled.
---
Got a golden one and I’ve been running her in my bomb warrior deck (I’ve been playing a heavier control type to the other lists I’ve seen). It’s one me most of the bomb warrior mirrors by being able to remove all the bombs after they’ve shuffled in a bunch.
---
She’s a lot of fun to play with too, I have a feeling she’s going to be very good in control-style decks that care about fatigue (she’s been fantastic in renolock and Renomage to finish against their grindy control lists).
---
A 4/5 on turn 1?
---
I’m probably going to put myself as an enormous dork here but I actually spent several hours this week analyzing art and noting artists from prior sets to discuss with my friends after we collectively noticed the quality of art in recent sets seems to have gone down.
---
HAHAHAHHA think about it! You had to get 3 legendaries, so another dood could get his 5-6 legendaries.
---
I too enjoy playing a 5 mana card that summons 4 bloodmage thalnos. Lol that will happen to some degree during this expansion I bet.
---
Even when I was playing pre-goblins vs gnomes murloc warlock, I still wouldn't run \[\[murloc raider\]\]. It's just awful, I would run \[\[Dire wolf alpha\]\] before that card.
---
Its amazing. If your opponent gets any board control you can instantly wipe out the board and because murlocs are so cheap you can instantly have board control again.

I mean I'd even advocate making him a class on his own instead of a card. Even if it meant paying in game, gold or dust, or real currency all over because I do believe he's the single best designed card that promotes trying new deck ideas and helps F2P without making them pay for every card under the sun.

The run was 2-2 and I somehow won 10 games in a row.MVPs:jade claws(I think I had it like every game I won on turn 2), underbelly angler(even though I had only had the lackey murlocs still won me 2 games) and evolve(and master on Evo,had 3 games with on curve doppleganger + evolve)
---
Yup already noticed this myself. Running Double Ooze and Harrison. Helps with the mirror match up as well.
---
How has a new challenger been performing? I didn’t put that in my Reno Paladin list when I tried it out.
---
Why? Even as an aggro deck, you can sometimes win games even after 25 turns. But I wasn't playing aggro. Control vs Control go often to fatigue, so 25 turns really isn't that long.
---
That said, you're probably right that against the current Bomb Warrior deck, you're likely losing when it's turn 25.

2/4/5 | Can't attack.  
---
Well have you played RoS? You owe it to yourself to at least give it a go
---
Don't get me wrong, I was (I AM) a great fan of Sludge Belcher, and I'm really happy to see him again :)
---
Wait till the meta settles and see if there is a good deck with her before crafting anything.
---
If you dont mind her being bad though, then just craft it and enjoy.
---
Underbelly Fence and Vendetta are more consistent, proactive, and generally better at controlling the board than hoping Spider Ambushes are drawn. Plus, Raiding Party finds Spectral Cutlass, which does made it fairly easy to stall for Tess.
---
Mind posting your Token Druid deck list?
---
I swear it's broken on Battle cry minions cause every time I use it one copy doesn't change. like on the 1/1 that summons a 6/6, when I used it the 1/1 didn't change and it summoned another 6/6 some ridiculous rng if it's not broken
---
[[Scaleworm]]
---
Just pick whatever you like more. People need to stop thinking 108 and 111 on this score is a significant difference
---
You didn't have to pay to play in artifact, you could pay a ticket to be able to win packs or play without ticket and without pack-rewards. Game had (has?) different set of issues, but definitely not the high price
---
Shadow Word: Fourbidden is what they probably would call it if they wanted to go the meme route like with Wispering Woods and Dark Wispers.
---
keep up the circlejerk but at the end of the day, getting a good or fun deck or two can be done free and isn't as hard as it seems, although having to continuously try and keep up with standard has always been a nightmare even in MTG

4/4/4 Beast | Battlecry: If you're holding a Dragon, gain +1 Attack and Rush.  
---
Why is waffle pick so good? I thought it was trash?
---
Hilariously my murloc deck wins 100% of the time vs them.
---
Only the first spell can be targetable, the second is always non-targetable, to avoid this exact problem
---
That’s a good point.
---
But yeah, when Anyfin Pally could summon four of him with 12 attack each, he was preeeeeetty good ;)
---
also sucks how wins / losses are determined by turn 1 again. getting tired of this game.
---
Wym?
---
If you look at the decklist, it’s a wild deck with 2.2 million ways to spawn more than one
---
Or Rafaam if you're playing Warlock.
---
I haven't crated it yet, but I want to. I have already crafted the murloc shaman and I'm having a blast
---
Nice! We're on our way!
---
Hahahaa that one too, I love meme cards that somehow counter a deck.
---
Glad to see others are picking up on the viability of Lynchen! Are people running brewmaster for boommaster, too?
---
It's all I've played. It's fun but it's not good enough
---
Kovon#1854 NA 80g quest looking to trade.
---
Sick camera bro!
---
Make an account just for whizbang
---
I would have had a third turn, meaning 3 more ticks from Rag.
---
That is an extremely niche situation that maybe very few people would ever be concerned with. I know it can be generally decent advice to never automatically disenchant extra copies in case of a card change, but how precisely do you really need to know that sort of thing?
---
I don’t even care man. I’m already sick of facing this deck
---
r/iamverybadass
---
NO PLEASE GOD NO ANYTHING BUT THIS
---
Pogo Rogue gotta use that Witchwood Piper now.
---
Daring Escape is amazing to pull your pogo's and lab recruiters back.  Also the pickaxe weapon thing
---
I have, yeah. Lost a game because of it.
---
Tried to a chef nomi priest yesterday and first 3 matchups were against bomb warrior. Hard to get to fatigue when you have to go through 8-10 bombs
---
It might actually be fun though, since the meta is still being figured out.
---
I am aware, but how far ahead do you really need to plan for that sort of thing?
---
Blizzard killing it with the creative brawl decisions /s
---
So what you’re saying is any other armor card would have also won you the game, an even better armor card perhaps?
---
Unless you want rewards for actually playing the modes, which require you to pay in the form of real money.
---
At least I can do an Arena by doing 2-3 days of quests in Hearth.
---
Only 4, and I have played like, 50 matches
---
I’m trying running one copy of tog’s scheme in my deck to make copies of Hench-Clan Burglar for such scenarios. Also has the potential to be good against the likes of bomb warrior or control oriented decks where you can outvalue them with 10 extra Tess Greymanes or Captain Greenskins.
---
IT'S WISDOM JERRY! WISDOM!
---
Me neither. Right now I fear for Hunter cards. Most of my cards are Hunter and it's the class I use on ranked matches. That Jepetto deck may cause blizz to nerf something hunter related.
---
Ppl are basically playing Jepetto &gt; playing 1-cost Vereesa &gt; playing 1-cost Malygos &gt; 32 unavoidable face damage. There is also the possibility of 1-cost Alexstrasza to get the opponent with 15 health if you happen to have only 1 twinspell in hand.
---
I lose everytime to this deck pffff
---
But it takes 4 days and i did the quest by accident, didn't know it was a line of quests. I like free cards!
---
i've been playing mostly aggro/midrange hunter, since they didn't lose all that much
---
im honestly semi suprised zilliax hasnt been nerfed/changed yet and  will be if he leaves untouched  throughout the year.
---
Oh yeah, I think you're definitely at Whizbang's limit unfortunately :/
---
Right. Whizbang time again.
---
Mind shooting me the deck list?
---
They are going to print a different yet similar version of him every two years.
---
Can I see your list? Pulled Oblivitron and would love to do something with it.
---
what
---
How about the great shaman combo ! "The strom can hit twitce" &gt; coin &gt; concede ?
---
Sorry if I sound condescending 
---
But again close 
---
Thing is if you think of it one at a time 
---
The first one you have 2/ number of 8 drops 
---
Because it doesn't matter which one you get 
---
Can be either and still get the windfury package 
---
It's only on the second summon you need a specific one ( the one youre missing ) and thats 1/ number of 8 drops 
---
Hence the answer I put above when you times together
---
I’ve been enjoying pogo rogo as well! Glad to see someone else on the same grind. That is an impressive hand no doubt!!!
---
Because if you want to play with new cards you gotta spend that $$$$
---
Genn's masculine voice, oh fuck yeah
---
Welp
---
This is the first time I've been happy to see this brawl. Putting it out the day after an expansion launches means the meta isn't figured out yet and there'll be a bunch of new stuff happening in it.
---
Fun times!
---

He plays Tess rogue - pretty sure he's not worried about the deck just being a meme.

Control decks are known as "NO" decks for a reason.
---
If you want a hard counter, Thief Rogue should suffice.
---
It's brawliseum again
---
It's definitely possible but at the same time if it is the deck dominating ladder running ooze seems strictly correct.
---
My winner was [traveling healer] I got like a dozen of those suckers.
---
Why keep printing card like that when you can just put it in classic set.. Blizzard just trying to cash in nothing else
---
I mean, a) the deck is obviously quite powerful, and b) people like winning. Obvious conclusion is you're gonna queue into it quite a lot. Try to queue a deck that does well against it into it
---
__Dingelingeling! Und alle Atzen singen__
---
I added the pickaxe and the escape, and even the toy boy (everything's a battlecry, and even ziliax is good as a 1 mana 1/1). Forgot about the piper though, thanks for reminding me.
---
Yeah sorry my laptop is a little janky and doesn’t let me take screenshots.
---
 Lackeys should not be the main focus of a deck atleast right now but a support engine. Best deck for this would be rogue with Barron togwaggle
---
...
---
Brawliseum sucks ass, tired of it
---
Slay the Spire is a great game. I don't see it as a competitor to hearthstone, it's its own thing.
---
You mean Repeatable this Turn?
---
If you are not using it, install the deck tracker, it makes easier to figure the playstyle of the whizbang decks, but anyway, they are all t2 at max.
---
That sounds like a bug
---
I have no idea about the lore of WoW never having played it, so that was news to me.
---
Rogue seems insane! Lots of value generation through the lackey creators and the new pirate. Plenty of tempo minions and rush!
---
Renounce Darkness too please! Wild is a bad home for fun cards
---
Suddenly, bomb warrior isn't most annoying thing to play against anymore.
---
Well done!
---
You're probably right!
---
You act like people won´t already be netdecking Tempo Rogue or Bomb Warrior
---
And Zul'jin
---
I was playing wild vs rougue and there was 7 bombs in the deck. Mfer did prep sprint 2x and draw 0 bombs . I just alt f4 raged.
---
There's a difference between using money to buy an edge, and not being able to actually play for any rewards without spending money.
---
Even if Artifact is for building a deck, much MUCH cheaper than Hearth, I don't really like the idea of opening my wallet every time I want to really play.
---
I grew up when arcade machines generally phased out, so I don't have lingering nostalgia for that.
---
I'm one of those awful people who played jade druid and jade shaman. I still have all my jade druid cards even though I don't play wild, in memory.
---
When this minion is damaged
---
i dont hate it but it really shouldnt be a brawl at all.
---
You usually find armor gain cards and replay them, even if they run multiple sources of weapon removal. I haven't lost to a warrior yet - I drown them in card advantage, can't be fatigued and always have enough healing/armor gain to handle a few random hits for 5. Running weapon removal doesn't seem very good right now. What's it for besides Tess Rogue and control warrior? Most other weapons aren't that strong and/or only hit twice anyway so removing the second charge isn't that good.
---
I’ve been playing with the deck and scargill is good, but he isn’t insane.
---
He’s more just a good tempo play on 5 with any other Murloc than key to the deck. Wait a month to see the meta settle
---
 i see a pattern here
---
D3 was dead before PoE came out
---
20, and 4.
---
Sooooooo Murloc Brawl huh?
---
What value pieces does bomb warrior have besides maybe Boom DK and Omega Assembly if you're going with mechs? If you've outvalued tess rogue, you're playing awful tess rogues.
---
No special brawl for 200th anniversary this time(
---
Why?
---
Upvoting for visibility.
---
Unity 
---
Precision 
---
Perfection
---
Game was just a cash grab.
---
I experience the same thing here. Android OS btw
---
They did this last set too!
---
Oh wow, interesting. Honestly I myself have only paid close attention to a relatively small number of the cards’ arts from recent sets (though I don’t think this invalidates my first comment). I know that from early hearthstone (i.e. from beta/classic/naxx/gvg) up until a year or two ago there was significant *improvement* in the general quality of art. If you’ve actually studied the more recent art it in a way that I said most people don’t then I’m sure you’re qualified to say it seems to have got worse. I’ll have to have a look myself now!
---
Dog was playing last night rank 50 legend, and he was facing Rogue more than anything. Aggro Rogue mostly but meta changes at different ranks
---
This could well be a good play, if you don't have a good use of your mana on turn 9. You get out your 4/12, discover a spell, and threaten to have free spells on following turns.
---
Until the phrase I was like "I think this guy is refering to another thread what a nub"
---
To be fair, I ran Cutlass deck (without espionage) for the last 3 expansion, and 1 weapon removal isn't the end of the world. You can usually bait it out before unleashing everything. Two weapon removal is where it hurt, but that weaken the deck against everything else that isn't running weapon.  
---
The meta should balance itself out.
---
"Fanmade content"
---
So stolen content is fanmade now?
---
Never had been this much fun with this card as the MVP of this rotation especially for F2P players can initially jump in testing the new cards and to practice different playstyles as well.  
---
Really like in playing the pre-built decks so far compared to the previous expansions, without having to play against Odd and Even decks all over again.
---
Which is why I always roll my eyes whenever someone says how badly Blizz manages the game.  They've stomped the competition by an order of magnitude (plural for most) and yet some neckbeard says any idiot could do it better.
---
Man I got nothing, I just opened 3 packs including the quests. As a F2P I would hope atleast 1 week before this :(
---
Which game did it shit on?
---
Really cool interaction!
---
I'm playing Warrior right now, and i've already found Sweeping Strikes does wonders sweet with [[Oondasta]], [[Zilliax]] and [[Akali]] (I've still have to try it with [[Darius Crowley]]! XD).

---
I can finally play [[Living Mana]] again!!

---
Its even better with shudderwock. If they have something that can remove all your elementals then you play shudderwock after and boom they are back.

---

also its useless into all the rogues running around
---
Noob question here, does this basically make brawl this week the EXACT SAME as arena? I haven't seen this "brawl" before but it seems exactly the same...is there something I'm missing?
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat, I'm thinking about just conceding three times in a row
---
If you have limited dust, best to wait at least a week for things to settle
---
what happens when it gets silenced on curve
---
At this rate hs will be dead in 10 years!
---
Exact same as arena except with constructed decks
---
Artifact, or should I say Arrows the Game, wasnt even a great game.  It's meta was really stale even from the get-go, and it had nearly as much rng as hearthstone (albeit not necessarily the same kind of RNG).  Not being able to select attack targets or positioning for units is truly maddening, and there's basically 3-4 "good" heroes for each color that you are forced to run to play that hero, so most decks are almost the same.
---
or he's not piloting it correctly
---
I’m already sick of facing control warriors and I don’t even play Murdoch shaman
---
but with zero collection and 12k dust, you're only going to be able to build 1-2 decks anyway. that's not a lot of experimenting.
---
I actually like the wildcard system, dusting cards always felt terrible to me 🤷‍♂️
---
5 card pyroblast
---
I mean, it would be nice to fight some mid-level decks &gt;~&lt;
---
If a deck loses i never know if its hot garbage or if only meh
---
 The priest one doesn't count?
---
There was also no free packs and legendary, really trying to make Bank on this one
---
You construct your deck instead of drafting it.
---
When that happens all thief cards should just give random class cards. The entire game is so fucking stupid with 2 steal Rogues when they can't actually build up anything because it's the same class.
---
The difference is that you kinda know what secret your opponent already has casted this game but Vargoth tells it on the same turn you cast it :/
---
tracking does not hard counter bomb warrior. You're not going to fatigue anyway so all tracking does is reorder your draw order. You're more likely to tracking into 3 hunter cards making you 3 cards closer to the bombs
---
Consider crafting Whizbang. It randomly gives one of the deck recipes at the start of your game, making it a cheap way to play with a lot of new cards while you wait for the meta to settle and decide what to craft.   
---
It's basically 18 different decks in one card!
---
I'm in the same boat. I get more and more frustrated each expansion to the point where I'm debating not playing anymore.
---
Cry
---
It's probably one of the most polarizing cards in terms of being silenced or not. If you don't silence / transform it you're really in trouble
---
Does anyone else feel like the arena has gotten a lot more aggro focused? I haven't played enough to judge properly, but from what I did it seems like the removal of cards such as primordial drake, dreadsteed, phoenix tar creeper etc, as well as the addition of aggro oriented early drops from Naxx era made matches shorter.
---
Is this something that they will change in the future, possibly via tinkering with the buckets? (I haven't played too much arena before Rhastakan so I'm hoping someone more experienced might know)
---
Oh jeez, yesterday a rogue shuffled over 20 copies of [[face collector]]
---
I don't believe so. The deck has already enough massive value bursts. In my opinion the deck would be almost as good even without boom.
---
Does it still cast when played from hand though?
---
They said there’s going to be some throughout the year. Just keepin things fresh
---

3/2/2 | Echo Battlecry: Add a random Legendary minion to your hand.  
---
What a lame way to introduce the new expansion. I generally think Brawliseum is a terrible TB format, but it feels particularly uninspired at this moment.
---
Lol, don't know what rank you play at but I'm low af. I haven't faced a warrior in 20 battles, it's all shaman, hunter, and like one burgle rogue so far.
---
If an Arena was retired, gold and dust rewards were automatically added upon login, but the pack stayed unopened with the rest of the packs.
---
A more cynic view is that Blizzard hopes people will rush crafts in hope to competing in the brawlesium, having to buy more packs later when the meta settles.
---
But I agree with you.
---
I mean, I was with you for the first paragraph, but your second one is a bit annoying. Considering that Overload didn't work the way you said it does when the game launched, but spelling wasn't changed at all, you can't really argue that the person "didnt read the effect correctly" or that it's "how its supposed to work" 
---
It wasn't until Patch 6.2, during Karazhan, that Overload was changed so that minions casting spells for you would make you overload.
---
Zug zug
---
Same here... more epics MIA than Legs.  I'm waiting until I decide if I need more packs before I start crafting.
---
Played against it twice out of 15 games 🤷‍♂️
---
You bastard, now my brain hurts from reading such garbage. Thanks a lot.
---
I haven't heard about that. Do you have a source?
---
but on the other hand, many of us just used up all our gold on new packs. the first one being free helps, but...
---
There are no strings on me!
---
I need that card

---
You attack before the..
---
Yeah I guess I haven’t started a new HS account since my original in classic so maybe I’m being unfair. I just liked that I was able to pick up mtga and have a competitive deck pretty quickly without dropping tons of money, but maybe hearthstone is like this too now?
---
I agree with your assessment actually. I still don’t think the scheme is good at all, but comparing it to Branching paths is dumb. That card was way too good for 4 mana and I hope we never see a card with that much versatility again lol.
---
Lol.
---
You got Vargoth, plus the quest chain that started with the new year, PLUS the packs you'll get from the first wing once the single player content comes out.
---
Nice! But yeah, the 2 mana 3/4's, Mysterious Blade and Vendetta that got revealed later are all super strong early game. Sludge Slurper did get more murloc support though!
---
I just played against a token Druid who refilled his whole board every turn. Managed to remove all of it every turn. Then he died. The Warrior removal options are ridiculous.
---
I don't know what Atzen are but they are all singing.
---
I hate the Wildcard system because only one rarity matters: Rare. Uncommons and Commons are completely useless, I have dozens with no purpose whatsoever. Even Mythics feel dumb because I have like 15 unspent and nothing I want because I have zero rare WCs and every deck takes a bunch of them.
---
I’m at rank 19 and since 25 all but 5/6 of the matchups I had were control warrior and burgle rogue (80% warrior). I’m running a wall priest and token Druid so I can handle the warriors with the preist  but it’s still rather annoying for the token Druid.
---
PRIMITIVE

I just lost to a control warrior on turn 5 as i drew all 4 bombs they shuffled in the previous 2 turns. I am playing Khadgar Mage.
---
Tell me 5 damage is not OP.
---
In my opinion this is the worst brawl. At least with the others I don’t have to pay to play again.
---
It's already that hated, huh?
---
The well that’s some ~~great~~ abysmal timing by Team 5, asides from arena players who’s going to have any gold saved since the expansion launched *yesterday*? 
---
I get that they probably wanted to do this before all the netdecks come out, but Blizzard really should have announced this was happening at the start of the week.
---
I'm sorry, my comment reads ruder than it was intended to be. But I often read something like "Autochess is what Artifact should have been, the perfect Dota 2 card game!" and it makes me angry.
---
I don't say that Autochess is a bad game or that you can't get enjoyment out of it. I tried it for a couple of games myself and these people still have explain in what way DAC is a strategy card game? There isn't even a way to create a deck for you that you can draw RNG cards from, it's all complete random what gets offered to you (unless you reroll).
---
It doesn't feel like a card game, the whole game style fits better to a tower defense game.
---
[deck]1262002[/deck]
---
Just as god intended
---
Glad you could snake it
---
They want you to spend your gold on day 2.
---
20$ for 1 deck would be cheap as it is now.. Last expansion i spent 70$ i got 1 completed deck and some half finished, got even warlock and half hakkar/mechatun druid and warlock.
---
After that disaster ill probably never buy a pack again.
---
Hard to believe making hero power cost 1 would have that much of an impact. Or just making it a tad more powerful
---
I did!
---
He's supposed to be just that. Tempo is good, that's why 0 mana 1/1 is good.
---
Deathrattle Hunter is so far the bane of my existence with Bomb Warrior. I assume your opponent was full Control Warrior?
---
I didn't wanna spend 80 dolars for a skin lol.
---
Well that is 5 mana draw 5 summon 5 1/1s gain spell damage +5
---
But did you die?!
---
$20? lol
---
Damn seems as though I’ve been pretty unlucky
---
They tried to make a list of them all 4 years ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2lco0w/so_apparently_the_shattered_sun_cleric_is/
---
They used to grab whatever art they had, now they specifically have it commissioned usually, so I don't know if there are new ones.
---
Sorry but no
---
Yeah unless you’re playing a control deck I think 15 minutes is pretty doable
---
I'm at 6/14
---
When nobody has data supported net decks to rely on, people try obvious synergies.
---
I got free legends and packs for logging in for the past few expansions why would they change it now
---
Oh baby a triple!
---
akchyually, no u
---
I know Kripp, Tump or Toast mentioned it but can't remember which one.
---
Honestly, the only safe craft at this point is a Golden Whizbang the Wonderful.
---
Yes.
---
its funny because he used to piss so many people off lol
---
Yeah its really fun, but cant seem to really win
---
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought the "fluff" flair was for memes.  
---
  
---
Sorry for bothering! \^_\^'
---
lolz the star wars inspired picture
---
Probably the highest % of all deck archetypes, but i don't really mind it. Lots of other decks and it doesn't ffel oppressive to me. lost some, won some.
---
While it is very strong, we’re only on day 2. Many viable counters can appear. And hey, at least it’s armor up instead of tank up now. Better than rock paper scissor stone/hunterstone like 3 days ago lol
---
At one time, Dr. Boom, Sylvanas, and Ragnaros unquestionably the best legendaries in the game. They fit into almost any deck that wasn't pure aggro (and even Dr. Boom made it into those sometimes, depending on the deck's curve).
---
I'd probably use Oblivitron if I had him but I don't. I don't think he's mandatory for the deck though honestly. I've also though about Vargoth. I think UtH is very strong right now; thinking about adding another copy.

why would you put necruim blade with no deathrattle in the deck?
---
Yeah I noticed that after it uploaded lol
---
Supposedly the quests come out every day for a total of something like 12 packs from the standard-legal sets opposed to all of them appearing in a single day
---
You're aware that this is probably the best deck right now? What's the celebration for?
---
lolz getting the free one has to be depressing
---
good , if this is your first time playing on those devices , don't forget besides the cardback there is also free classic pack if you play a match(can concede) on iPad, iPhone , Android tablet and android phone so free 4 pack
---
Boom Eyes Green Doctor
---
5 damage per bomb is the problem. Way too much utility and control in this deck.
---
Agreed
---
this looks like a ton of fun
---
Okay, to be slightly pedantic for the sake of clarity *either* spell can be targeted but not both. So you could choose (anecdotally for sake of example) Feral Spirit first, and then Lightning Storm.
---
You aren't guaranteed a targets spell first, but you can only ever have one at most.
---
Some brain freeze you had there. Awesome play nonetheless.
---
&gt;However, the legendaries are pretty good this set which hasn't happened since witchwood.
---
So you think that Duskfallen Aviana and Splintergraft are better than Floop and Loti?
---
I haven’t gotten to this point in the game yet, I’m still spending my uncommons pretty fast trying to build mono blue, commons I don’t have a huge use for atm though, and my mythic rares I don’t want to commit to anything yet at least until after new set.
---
No that's not a warrior.  With that amount of armor it's clearly a druid.
---
Yeah, I was assuming you keep the cards. If you DE then golden gets more dust. I don't ever DE cards though unless I have duplicates, you never know when they might be useful.
---
Allways.. why have card laying around you never use. Rather spend it on cards i use. I only keep a few iconic cards like sylvanas and Lich king
---
Pogues
---
So, the card is working as intended.
---
you either miscounted or are making something up for attention, ill give you the benefit of the doubt and go with the former.
---
Does that mean you already have a full set? Why keep opening packs?
---
Well, if you disenchanted it and keep opening packs, it was possible.
---
I must be drawing too much cuase all I draw is bombs and no armour. 😩 And half of them running triple weapon removal no point in Cutlass
---
Ill atleast try with my homebrew midrange hunter but hot damn this is so ill-timed
---
already posted but still a solid text
---
It's on a Hysteria video...
---
He is just a free 1/1 pirate for better openers and makes draws slightly more predictable, that's it
---
Still can't kill the Druid in one hit..
---
i wonder if it is because we may get a new class?!
---
It was bound to happen. Shouldn't have DE'd it if you were going to open RoS packs. But, hey, you made a 400 dust profit.
---
How's that work?  Wouldn't he be covered under the no duplicate legendary rule?  Assuming you don't already have all the legendaries from the set.
---
my daily quest is also missing
---
The nearest equivalent is Un'goro, as it was a rotation and, unlike The Witchwood, there was a significant meta change (but still not as big as this time thanks to Jade).
---
Yes, if you look at the first VS report it may look as though the meta was solved on Day 1, with Pirate Warrior, Taunt Warrior and Quest Rogue. But move forward to mid May (Report #49) and it's a totally different picture. The Tier 1 decks were Murloc Paladin, Secret Mage, Burn Mage and Pirate Warrior. And this was before any balance patch. 
---
Secret Mage was so low-data on the first meta report that it barely got a mention, just a suspicion it might be good. The first Burn Mage decks didn't start until about a week after the Expansion hit, and were totally different to the later "solved" versions. Murloc Paladin was recognised early, but ran two completely different archetypes, swapping weekly in and out of T1, for the entire expansion.
---
Pirate Warrior was good at low ranks, but no longer T1 at high ranks, Taunt Warrior was down to T3, Rogue's highest deck was T3, Token Druid was still T2 but Jade Druid was low T3. 
---
So yes, the first meta reports may reflect the first few days, but after such a big shake-up (even bigger than Un'goro), it's by no means a solved meta.
---
Seems weird that new bugs pop up with Rafaam when he does the same thing as an existing card.  [[Golden Monkey]].
---
Everyone is greedy right now and doesn't want to play tech or conservative things like heals, just need exciting stuff. I'm sure it'll rebalance itself
---
Damn do you have link to the post?
---
Dreampetal and run a Faceless Manipulator? Possibly too many pieces for a combo that's supposed to be strong against Aggro, but might drain control out in a Specialist format.
---
finally they did this brawl at the right time
---
I had lethal on warrior one game, while I was at 13 life... drew the only 3 bombs in my 12 card deck...

---
VS's Hooktusk list may not be the best performing Rogue deck but its very strong and more fun for me. It runs Togg and Hooktusk. I'm not sure about the 1 1 3 rush weapon though.
---
I had a mage use it on a mechanical welp they got off an astromancer. So sad I stopped running vanish
---
11+ attack minions are safe.
---
Thanks! It was the wrong card graphic but the card name was right. Just fixed it!
---
The irony is that Cygames already gives the Jaina treatement to the 90% of the female cards, in theory to not scare potential players like the ones here, in practice an exercise of futility as we can see here.
---
To be fair, Arena isn't necessarily geared toward new players as it is. There's a lot that isn't obvious or intuitive about it going into it. If anything, newer players probably wouldn't know there was anything different about it now from any other time. I'd even wager that experienced players are more likely to end up confused, if they've been out of the loop.
---
I took bomb warrior to time with control priest.  He had 30 health 40 armor at one point.  Loaded me with all the bombs (extra off Dr Boom, Mad Genius), all the mechs...
---
I was a turn away from stealing him bomb stick myself (already stole a Blastermaster Boom) but alas, my Madam Lazul was a turn too late.
---
Either way, I just out lasted him....I used Archivist Elysiana to erase a couple bombs, but I mainly needed her to replenish my deck when it got low.
---
We're in waaaaaaayy too deep for a new class. They'd have to give it like, 500 cards right off the bat
---
Pie pie pie!
---
111 packs - 8 legendary dropped ...
---
I'm fairly certain I read that pool one includes *all* spells, and pool two only includes *non-targeted* spells.
---
BeardedHeckler used Tome of Intellect!  It's not very effective...
---
Heads up, the time to stop spending your gold is about 3 weeks after an expac drops. From there you can save your daily gold for the next one. I was able to buy 71 packs with gold from saving that way
---
Oh wow I forgot about this, does anyone have the original pasta? Shit was funny.
---
If everythig goes wrong, ate least you win on fatigue
---
I meant receiving 5 gold tacked onto any amount, because unless you already have an extra 5 gold it's just useless for a large amount of time.
---
I realized after reading this so mine is smaller. This is why the robot uprising will happen, we can’t even spell primitive.
---
Are you from EU? if so, I will go play big priest in ladder now. Hope we can play together!
---
Decent idea as long as I get back my 3200 dust for crafting golden Whizbang.
---
there aren't that many murlocs in standard so that's a very likely outcome
---
Next month it's my turn to repost this for free karma.
---
ZombieMonkey#1724 NA Trading 80g you go first, playing suicide warlock
---
Similar story here. Shuffled 5 bombs into a rouge deck. They play Myra’s unstable element and none of them go off. Like they just disappear.
---
whats next? some "after years of playing and constantly trying to improve myself, i finally managed to beat the tutorial" posts? get your shit together noobs and stop spamming this reddit with stuff that no one cares for.
---
I run those things in my bomb warrior
---
Pointless. You either have two copies or less or you are keeping many copies in hopes of a Nerf. Knowing the exact number would never serve a purpose beyond trivia. The way it is currently is best
---
Yep! Thanks for helping me out with that.
---
RIP indeed. I loved playing Mill Rogue with Gang Up. Healing for 80+ HP against Face Hunters was glorious.
---
**I WORK FOR KABAL**
---
Oh, flairs !
---
Oh you've stolen me lungs
---
It's a matter of preference, of course. Some people like that system but, to me, there are few things worse than having mana flood or mana screw, and I hate having to build in mechanisms into my decks that are specifically about trying to smooth that out. I've had far too many times where the game is, basically, over on the mulligan. 
---
That said, I do like the fact that mana comes in colors and the way that opens up design space. That part is very well designed. But the core method of obtaining mana just feels antique to me.
---
I felt like even before RoS, shadow priest was a deck which I run most of the time into.
---
As far as I know, you couldnt dissenchant Vargoth, just like you cant dissenchant Marin the fox.
---
die to 6 boom bots
---
This should be changed &gt;:(
---
Mtg funnily enough. Lots of people saying how much better it is to not have lands and instant speed.
---
I wasn't sure it would be worth it at the high cost, but I'm really enjoying it in a resurrect/big minion Priest. Flexible board clear and if it survives you can slap an Inner Fire combo on it for lethal the next turn.
---
The first time I dropped it with an Inner Fire to clear both of a Warlock's Twilight Drakes I knew it was a keeper.
---
ironic, he could attack other and even himself
---
Can i have a code for this deck?
---
I think this is a morally disgusting brawl to make after a new set came out that was insanely more stingy than all other recent hearthstone sets. This is just a cheap ploy by blizzard to get people who held onto extra gold for the single player to spend it so they end up caving and buying it a month from now. 
---
I honestly think this is scummy and predatory and more importantly goes to show that Activision blizzard truly is in dire straits in 2019 post “don’t you guys have phones?”
---
 Yeah same lol xD
---
But a new expansion just came out and they keep playing the same deck
---
To be fair, Mind Control used to cost 8 mana. There was only a 37 day gap between MC going to 10 mana and Sylvanas going to 6 mana, but a seven month period where it was 5/8, respectively.
---
Still crazy. I definitely built a Feign Death deck for her.
---
hunters arent scary. only op class rn is warrior
---
I lethal’d a Bomb Warrior with Hakkar’ Corrupted Blood from a Nine Lives’d Armed Piñata.
---
Hunter is weaker but the zane is still there.
---
Unstoppable toxicity
---
Not bad but quite casual.
---
&gt;Brawliseum usually requires and entrance fee, but since it's your first time, its on the house! Enjoy!
---
Then locks me out and proceeds to ask me to pay through an in-app purchase to unlock this brawl? What the fuck is going on?
---
I'm not the original guy and I 100% agreed with your first paragraph and that guy was way out of line to say that your logic was flawed. I just felt the part about "The wording says it, it always worked that way" was a bit much. 
---
I could go into a philosophical discussion with you about whether or not that change should've been in the Bug Fixes section, considering that users had no reasons to believe it was not working properly. But how about we don't, since we agree on everything else.
---
So, card working as intended?
---
Hmm, that's probably as I've only used it the once and I don't *recall* there being target spells in the second selection.
---
I beat Big Priest with Exodia Mage (\~80% of the time).  I posted a list yesterday.  If I remember, I will post it here later.
---
[I always check to see which commons are the last to show up. I'm tickled this time. ~100 packs.](https://i.imgur.com/JPZv3GA.png)
---
The thing people are forgetting is the team has changed a lot and the game is being taken in a different direction. This can be seen with how they are presenting expansions going forward and how they are scrapping some of the old things like hero cards
---
No shit, Vargoth and Forbidden Words are huge cards in it.
---
Just go some hyperaggro deck like Mech Hunter.
---
&gt; With Bomb Warriors running rampant the value won't be enough to survive.
---
That really depends on the ranks. I am only around rank 15 and and in 15 matches I haven't seen a single warrior. Probably more in the higher ranks.
---
This deck isn't actually bomb warrior.
---
That said, I'm very keen on hearing more about your deck. Do you have a deck code?
---
The problem isn't that the $20 is unaffordable. The problem is that $20 is more than most people want to spend when they don't know what the game is really like or whether it's fun to play or not. The purpose of F2P in games like this isn't so that poor plebs can play the game; it's so that people who have money to invest can try before they buy. Artifact didn't give people that option and it killed them.
---
Check in 13 minutes
---
I didn't get the quest either.
---
You follow it with a Floop + Faceless manipulator curve, naturally.
---
I’ve played 2. Only coming up against burgle rogue and pirate rogue
---
I beat this exact list with a Chef Nomi rogue. Hightolled that he didn’t have the 2nd brawl yet.
---
Yeah. That’s what I figured. Didn’t “Attack” just “Damage”d them. 
---
(“(...)Also damages the minions next to it”)
---
Btw is there a reason, this isn’t phrased as ‘adjacent’ minions? Tf is with all this inconsistency?
---
You probably have played a game against him and just didn't realize it. He doesn't show up in the interface so the only way to tell if you're playing against him is to watch what your opponents are playing and see if it matches one of his deck recipes.
---
If you've got a large collection then he's going to be less valuable to craft. Basically he just plays one of the standard deck recipes that you can find in the collection interface. Since all of those decks are a bit weak and could use some card changes you're better of making the deck yourself and tweaking it.
---
Toast called
---
Start of legion? More like start of mop lol
---
Which I honestly doubt. It got some pretty good cards outside of a SC deck, that it can probably survive as a good aggro/tempo deck. Togwaggle alone can be an absurd swing.
---
Yeah, it's actually amazing. Have been hoping they'd do some sort of wild-ish arena for a while, why not? Keeps things interesting plus lets me see a ton of cards I never got to.
---
Dyed fish nugget doesnt have the same ring to it though
---
Is improve morale really that good in the deck?
---
Even when i don't highroll the combo I've won from just flooding the board and playing Sea Giants and Jumbo Imps.
---
I tried out Impferno but i found it was too weak so it was cut for defile.
---
https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1246534-biglock-wild
---
Of course, the irony being that I had the same situation, 12 cards, 3 bombs.  I had lethal next turn, was at 13 health... Drew all 3 bombs.
---
Patches thins your deck, and if you don't draw him is a 0 mana 1/1 for tempo.  He is quite strong in the right decks.
---
Yup, as someone living in Poland cost of packs is way too high. Can't imagine how unfair it is for someone in Ukraine or Russia.
---
I think that it's because Valve just doesn't understand the modern digital CCG market... and neither does Richard Garfield, so maybe it's more ignorance than greed, but it doesn't really matter at this point. The economic model was a resounding failure.
---
I think it’s exactly the reason for the mechanic. If you’re here to steal from your opponent’s card pool, you have to make due with what you get!
---
There’s been variety implemented with stolen steel, hype-mon, and now hench-clan burglar. I think it really is good flavor to see who’s the better rogue when you both end up stealing boilerplate rogue cards
---
Came here to say this.  Cleave has been on the docket for a long time.  Doesn't get as much attention as poisonous did, but equally in need of an overhaul.
---
Valve has one of the absolute shittiest fanbases in games.
---
Didn't Team 5 say that the upcoming Shadow Cloak card is basically going to do this.....?
---
Saurfang or Varian would be great as warrior Heroes.
---
BAN WHIZBANG AND BAN THESE POSTS!
---
They've given up.
---
The plan right now is to milk what few whales remain before they put the game into maintenance mode.
---
Ben Brode knew this was coming.
---
I refuse to play hunter, but I think the mech hunter deck doesn’t run the legendary.
---
Speak for yourself. Shaman became basically a murloc class and my only win condition at this point is if warrior doesn't get their awful echo 1 tap aoe
---
Turn 6 with a Preperation in hand... Couldn't have a luckier result
---
I don't care
---
Im honestly already wishing the death knights back: the ammount of secret paladin decks and silence priest decks is just insane and absolutely killing my fun more than the death knight decks did.
---
I mean... voting with your wallet is the strongest way to make a point. Why should blizzard give a free hero when people throw money at them for a paid hero. I mean afterall Blizzard is a business and businesses exist to make money.
---
Unless it dies to 2x Hagatha battlecries, of course.
---
I upvoted, but the idea probably is they can make new cards that have the new deck recipes in that way when decks Whizbang rotates with comes out they dont need to fully redo them each time.
---
The next deck to hate is Kingsbane Rogue which although strong is just a regular aggro deck, all other decks in the format have clear weaknesses.
---
I agree with you and am a huge whizbang fan and hope it stays in standard. However, given recent trends, I can’t imagine someone turning down the chance at using “You’ll get the new whizbang if you drop $20 bucks on this single player expansion!” as a way to drive people toward that purchase.
---
Players get all the cool things about whizbang but Blizzard also gets some money.
---
&gt; draw the card first then burn it if there’s no space in your hand.
---
It may look like this, but the card is never drawn, only shown. They are instantly burned. Works the same on every card that says "Cast when Drawn". Worked the same way with Spiders.
---
I’ll probably try it out tonight, I’ll let you know how it goes
---
Lazul and cabal? Like shadow priest? I think I'm missing something...
---
Thank you for the idea! &lt;3

---
Does anybody know when the new adventure will release ?
---
A lot of people have had excellent results with forms of Lackey Rogue and Bomb Warrior. I've personally performed much better than I care to admit with Murloc Shaman.
---
This deck isn't too expensive and has been piloted to rank 1 legend, I've tried it out a bit, and even in my unskilled hands its producing good results:

They've definitely been doing some data testing with all the sets in the past year basically having different bundle prices, rewards, and free rewards. This is probably the test to see if they can give very little away for free and still have money thrown at them

Lazul's scheme will reduce the attack power on a minion, then you can permanently steal it with Cabal Shadow Priest. A 2-card, 6-mana mind control.

---
&gt; to burn out their 2800 gold
---
ah shit, I forgot that was coming up.  what's the price in dollars again?
---
I don't think that Tog is the star of Gallon's list, he's been very public about believing that Tog should actually be cut from the list to make it optimal. The real stars are how insane Miscreant + Lackeys and Waggle Pick are, they just boost the deck to insane levels. Insane enough to even cut hench from lists because of its anti-synergy with Pick.
---
By turn 8 you probably have at least 6 bombs in your deck. That's 30 damage alone. You expect people to blow up their deck on turn 8 by crafting a 1600 legendary? You do realize the warrior can still shuffle more bombs into your deck after that point, yes?
---
Give a man a fish he'll expect it everyday.
---
when the meta hasnt been solved
---
Oh shit, dude. I was thinking madame lazul. I'm slow, sorry.
---
Other 6 and 8 drops were trash though
---
Cairne didn't suddenly burst on to the meta just because they got rid of Sylvanas

There is no way they are going to let us know the ultimate fate of Whizbang until he's about to rotate out. We'll be lucky if they tell us at Blizzcon. (If there is one this year)
---
Which means there's one OP deck without a counter
---
True
---
&gt;I mean, that REALLY depends on the match and what you get. If the warrior has already played two Brawls, there are not that many ways to remove them besides execute/big rush minion. 
---
good thing warrior doesn't have executes or big rush mini-- oh..
---
&gt;Also, if you have Khadgar on board (from one of the lackeys) it gets even harder. 
---
wtf are you smoking
---
Also why do we still have 2 class legendaries? At first we had quests+regular legendary, then we had DKs+regular legendary, then we had spells+regular legendary, then we had weapons+regular legendary...
---
Now it's just "fuck you, just two class legendaries, because neutrals would make the game manageable".
---
that's 23 copies or am I dumb?
---
I'd assume because they get summoned *after* the end of turn "phase" has already triggered. I know HS doesn't exactly have phases but you get what I mean.
---
The question I have is whether they will die at the end of your opponents turn or *your* next turn (or neither)
---
Maybe I’ll tech one brewmaster and see how it flies. Is it worth it to run Harrison? Or are most people just playing 1-2 ooze?
---
You never know. Better to be safe rather than sorry
---
Yes i wasn't sure if that was the case. Last tavern I played with whizbang I got the same class for 7 games in a row
---
I mean it’s a good change to an existing mode, but certainly not the same as a new game mode
---
It’s deathrattle is basically shadowstep right? So it’s like a damage-dealing version of shadowstep?
---
I was waiting for this to happen lmao
---
I'm apart of that 90%
---
Move over friend. This isnt even the best pack in the minute you posted it
---
If you check the wiki article that you pulled that from, at the bottom it states that banshees are undead
---
I hope a truly complete version gets made with all of the stated corrections
---
ragingmunkyz#1732 NA looking to trade 80g quest. I'll show you go first.
---
Works just like the spooders used to.
---
It's like assembling Quel'Delar in arena. You just need to find the other half now.
---
Give us Rafaam for Warlock! 2 skins for it and both of them suck.
---
I think it’s fine because he’s severely understatted for a 5 drop but he has so much unity, precision, and perfection it doesn’t matter
---
I mean, isn't everyone getting the first wing of the new singleplayer for free? Doesn't that come with a free hero?
---
Yup same here, the meta will settle in 2 weeks and we back again to the new expansion waiting room
---
Damn, if i were i would ban this card forever
---
While I agree, I shall also poke fun at the frequency of this type of post:
---
[Circlejerk noises]
---
Shuffling 11 Greenskins into my deck as espionage rouge.
---
[His mother resurrected him before WC3](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Medivh#Resurrection). The WC3 version of him is actually him. There's afterimages of him in parts of Karazhan but he reappears at the end of the Legion dungeon.
---
I'm glad to hear that you took their advice. I remember blowing a bunch of dust on 2 legendaries to make a shiny new deck that was found to be mediocre within a week and a half. Right now I'm sitting on a bunch of dust and I'm still going to wait at least a week to craft anything (maybe an epic or two).
---
Yes, the mob tag in game. Which has 0 lore implication. There are only 11 mob tags in all of WoW and every creature, NPC, and enemy has to be categorized under one of the 11.
---
Wasn't he revived by Aegwynn though? She's stated to have saved up her magic literally for that reason alone and it nearly killed her as well.
---
Kingsbane and Runespear for me.
---
When people are buying them for $80, it's not wonder they decided to cheapen out on a bunch of stuff, especially with no improvements to the game whatsoever.

How do you find a standard player? Make any post and wait for then to remind you a card isn't in their format.

I just went 3/3!
---
Why am I so bad at this game?
---
z1nc104#1846 80g quest trade NA - You go first
---
You get a chance at a 2nd pack starting at 2 wins. (It's low though)
---
Even at 0/3 I get 1 pack and dust or 35g. Most of the time I get at least 5 wins so I'm fine playing arena.
---
I did that for years when my average win was only 2-3 wins. I basically looked at it like I was paying 15-50g for a chance to get more than just one pack.
---
But six packs of the current set is on par as we have seen in the past
---
So, instead of getting it by playing you get it by paying. Yeah, no reason to get angry if that's the case.

I haven't played since Ungoro. What are the new staple cards?
---
Mine opened automatically because I dusted and went through all my cards the night before. When I woke up pans logged in I had 5 new cards.
---
...And with that, the excitement wears off and the complaining begins.
---
Same $80 bundle as in TBP
---
I played a homebrew control shaman and had a really fun game against a bomb warrior last night. I had 5 bombs in my deck with hagatha hero power and about 15 cards left in my deck (bombs included), 10 cards or so in his. Played blazing invocation i got off hagatha, played the seaforium bomber i got from that, then played shudderwock to fill my hand up with minions (elementals, a lackey, horror) and just kept a full hand with hagatha hero power after every minion drop. Finally he had 2 cards left, i had him to three health but i had to dump my hand the turn before and was vulnerable to bombs again so i thought i was done for. Then he drew a bomb and died. I forgot about the one shudderwock shuffled in. That was a great feeling lol.

I said it in jest, not complaining lol

Eu or na?
---
Vargoth is disenchantable fyi
---
Except they are undead according some lore. Like the Christie Golden novel about Arthas. But WoW lore is incredibly inconsistent because it was written by several people, it is futile to argue if they are undead or not. Most evidence points to banshees being undead, so I'll stick with that
---
There are too many great cards leaving. This is hardly the time for celebration o7
---
DK Dr. Boom really doesn't come into play much.  If your opponent spends their turn 7 doing nothing but gaining 7 armor, they're probably going to be dead on turn 8.
---
I will play no game mode besides (wild) miniature warfare if it's available.
---
They should let us buy the other hero portraits too.

Thanks !

How do you spend your gold? F2p is very possible in this game

No way Arena. You have a better chance at finding women at the bar than going positive ROI.

Sure you can play arena for 3 dailies, but at some point dailies become chore, I feel like I have been moving more and more away from games with daily bonuses- they start to feel like some facebook games.

Man I thought heal druid was bad overall, but my list is *sooooo* much worse than that one. I totally forgot melon exists and was running a shitty witchwood piper gadgetzan package

I got 5 Legendaries from 50 packs, my best so far :)

Seriously I don’t get people. Currently for switch it’s been announced Mortal Kombat 11 is a 5 gb game with a 15gb day one update. The switch has an internal memory of 32gb and carts for it go above 32gb. So basically the company cheaped out bought the smallest cartridges possible and is forcing the consumers to delete a ton of stuff or buy an sd card.  
---
People actually defend this practice. Some people must really get their jolly’s out of being abused by corporations screwing them.
---
Especially since the powerful cards more or less only find new synergies in wild, so some of the oldest cards are still very evergreen.
---
If noodle decking doesn't work for you, I understand, but finding one that works half decent makes it all worth it. 
---
I do think that in the age of net-decking, the principal of bad cards being necessary is somewhat outdated. I feel like we'd see much more variety in the meta if every card that was printed was somewhat useful at a minimum, and underperforming cards were buffed accordingly.
---
Got 2 legends in 46 packs. Fuck you. Fuck blizz.

Who cares they don't do anything different. Vote for new hero powers!
---
Hearthstone and new ideas don't mix well. It would confuse the players. Be happy you got a few more deck slots
---
Hearthstone is made in Unity, which uses C#. [This](https://youtu.be/aPXvoWVabPY) video might be of interest.
---
Sad Gluttonous rotated, wish they added another good ooze type card. Corrosive sludge just isn't cutting it
---
I’m playing Maly Hunter right now and win most of the times against Bomb Warrior, it’s great to burst them with 2 Rapid fires and one arcane shot dealing 25 dmg.
---
This community is a flaming pile of dogshit full of buttfuck retarded children that only give a fuck about getting literally everything for free. The community doesn't give a fuck about anyone other than themselves, they just disguise their complaints as "new player experience" or taking a grand stand against a multibillion dollar company. At least blizzard is straightforward when they fuck me and doesn't try to pretend they are so fucking self-righteous about it.

*Hi human!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** unkiwii! ^(hug)
---
Teasing people is fine, but I think you decided a bit too early that he was the kind of guy that wanted to waste your time with monologues and not to engage in a conversation.
---
I mean, that first line he said was not the greatest opener to a conversation, that's for sure, but he had (somewhat) valid arguments.
---
And if you weren't in the mood/interested in conversating, ignoring him would have been a better option, "ok thanks" simply comes off as arrogant, in particular if the guy you're saying that to spent quite a bit of time into writing a lenghty response.
---
He was introduced in WC3 with a grand fake death. He's spent more time presumed dead than he has actually helping out.
---
Zuljin is a true hero card, it's just not infinite value. And its great with Unleash the Beast. Not every death knight card was infinite value(admittedly, they were usually bad). Still though, that's weird wording
---
Ouch..
---
LOL, look who got all precious. You OK, there? Nice fanfiction about someone you've never met. Again, GTFO and enjoy Bomb warrior before the nerf.
---
Because class legendaries are much more fun and agreed to be one of the best changes they've done. Fuck that Dr.Boom-Sylvannas-Ragnaros era of generally good neutral legendaries, or a class being left behind because their only legendary wasn't good. Their legendary designs are much better now.
---
even the common weren't bad
---
Its ok, at least they gave us a free legendary on log in like they always do :)
---
With those prices? Ya kidding?
---
For some reason they gave me another free legendary. Don’t no why but I didn’t question it.
---
You bought it? Lol
---
This community is a bunch of entitled fuckhead children

So is 4 legendary out of 80 packs outside of the usual odds? Because if it's normal, then you're still getting a better deal with the preorder. I got six legendaries from the packs, one of them golden. Plus the golden legendary for the pre-order.
---
best part is you realized this after watching them struggle to do exactly what you suggested.

Pretty sure that deck won't be touched at all. But since you facerushed to legend you probably know way more about the game than everybody else :*

Get a job or life dude.
---
Is it just that hard to fit him into a turn? Seems like him summoning a whelp or safeguard or mechathun would be a good way to cheat out something big. By itself it seems okay but with 9 lives it seems like it has a pretty bonkers high roll potential. If hes in your deathrattle pool and you have mechathun or mechanical whelp in hand you play out spider bombs, play nine lives into Oblivitron, and he either pulls himself plus a stat bomb or just a stat bomb, and then you have mana to spare.
---
Battlecry: Eat any bombs placed in your deck.
---
Just look for cards that offer a high level of consistency. Murlocs seem particularly strong right now. Hope your luck changes!
---
So you're going by "stonehearthed" now nerd? Haha whats up douche bag, it's Tanner from Highschool. Remember me? Me and the guys used to give you a hard time in school. Sorry you were just an easy target lol. I can see not much has changed. Remember Sarah the girl you had a crush on? Yeah we're married now. I make over 200k a year and drive a mustang GT. I guess some things never change huh loser? Nice catching up lol. Pathetic
---
Vargoth is actually really good with [[Heavy Metal]], [[The Boomship]], [[Omega Assembly]] and [[Dragon's Roar]]. I've gotten Kalegos from the latter, I've even gotten double [[Nozari]].
---
Golden Garrosh is great though!

Wait, what? It makes me an asshole to have made a good deck on my own?

---
Same. Although, it's hard for me to complain too much, because historically I've gotten about 1 legendary per 15 packs for the past 3-4 expansions, so my luck was bound to run dry.
---
That weird, was it always like that? Because I thought "draw a card" was a part of those spells and they auto casted on draw for free.
---
10-3 with malygos spell hunter , did not expect to get so far. See a lot of people not being fan of this brawl but I for one liked it (first time I played this one)
---
Normally I would say it's not needed; but it absolutely wins games against bomb warrior. They usually concede on the spot. 
---
However if you can spare the dust, I would recommend crafting elysiana. It's looking like an extremely solid card and in any control deck it's going to be a very viable option.
---
Congtats on your run! No idea why the message didn't show up, it's probably just a bug.
---

Was that from the preorder?
---
How is the new Dr Boom a better “”””design”””” 
---
than the old one? Putting multiple quotes because you obviously have no fucking clue of what you’re talking about.
---
Do you always pretend to have powers of premonition when you get this precious or just on Reddit?
---
spending all of you mana to remove one minion? seems really inefficient :)
---
Average is 1 legendary per 20 packs. He only got slightly below average if that counted the pre order legendary.
---
True enough, although discoring through blazing invocation is nice lol. Won a couple games like that
---
Yeah $80 for the new hero? PASS, throw in packs too? Still pass

Decently tinkered list.  Insanely fun, and so far has been able to beat everything I’ve seen.  I don’t think there’s any hard counter, but it doesn’t hard counter anything, either.
---
A few tips - hand size can mess you up.  Be careful.  Don’t get greedy with elysiana, except against Control Warrior.  Shudderwocking her battle cry is how you beat control warrior in fatigue because you will be drawing more. Rain of Toads is generally the best spell to get off of Hagatha. Rain of Toads + lightning storm or Rain of Toads + hex are probably the two best combinations possible.  Rain of Toads + Rain of Toads or Feral Spirit is also pretty insane...it’s basically a better Spreading Plague.
---
Its literally been like a little over 24 hours dude. How much arena have you played that you already know the meta? Lol
---
You pick the target. 
---
So you play Hagatha, you are offered any Shaman spell. If in your offer you were given a targetable spell, and you pick it, the next choice will not have a targetable spell.
---
But yeah, as soon as you drop the Horror, it is a battlecry and you get that little target to select the intended target you want.
---
No, Coldlight Oracle was the second rotation (for the year of the Raven) along with Ice Block and unnerfed Molten Giant. The original card (for the year of the Mammoth) was Conceal.
---
Don't know if the rates are changed but I got 2 Golden Legends, 5 overall and a ton of epics in less than 30 packs.
---
I didn't believe it until I looked at my stats page, but I actually have a 66% winrate against warrior (16-8) with my murloc shamen deck. 
---
But that's all warrior and not just bomb warrior...
---
Yes, to me he counts. It's a decent card, and can be dusted if you don't like him. Unlike C'Thun or Marin.
---
Got Murloc Shaman, opponent down to 3 LP, I have Bloodlust, all set. Opponent plays that mage card that summons 2 minions, booom SAFEGUARD. Next turn: Alexstraza.
---
Salty AF.
---
Ahhh, a petition. And an online petition, at that. These never fail to get things done and actually initiate change, right? 
---
I mean really tho... has a petition ever, Ever, in real life or online, Ever gotten anything done? That's a genuine question. I wonder the same about protests too. Both seem equally worthless and ineffective.
---
i had to look up just to make sure that silence gave control of the minion back to the other player
---
This pack is literally one in a million, so I think we can allow it.
---
I mean, he is an idiot. Getting like 3-4 legendaries per 60 packs is normal since launch. I would never pay 80 bucks for that.
---
not everyone plays every day
---
What Card game uses the EA logo?
---
No wonder the Buzzard is starving
---
I had someone jam Zilliax on it when I had them down to like 5 life. Instant gain 10, I had no clean removal so just had to give him another 20 double trading into it.
---
Auto lose if they draw the nuts
---
&gt; Clearly you’re someone who rushes on to net decks.   
---
Nice ad hominem attack.    
---
&gt; I can’t adapt because I don’t have the cards to make these insane decks filled with legendary minions.  
---
Rip, it sucks when you can't adapt:'(
---
My God...
---
Why would you screenshot a loading screen? 🕵️🤔
---
oof
---
Is OTK paladin the one with Holy Wrath?
---
I thought i was lucky opening 1 golden legendary and 2 normal legendaries in 17 packs. Jeez
---
I mean, it's what I was doing anyways...
---
Yep
---
well, they have the gnome warlock hero who I think is pretty rad! You can try getting her.
---
Loti still feels mediocre at best despite the ability to pick from 4 forms.
---
Who knew that 4 terrible choices makes the card bad?
---
I think I got my pack when I logged in, because I got a random extra pack for no reason.  Then I went to claim the arena rewards later and didn’t get a pack then; so I assume that’s what my free pack earlier was.
---
Maybe learn some self control before playing f2p games.
---
Yeah, that is brutal. Plus if you don't take it down, It might get Magnetized again.
---
You’re an arrogant prick.
---
But then if I adapt to bomb warrior I’ll just lose to everything else. You’re very mad about this aren’t you. Can’t you just see my point that it sucks to be playing against bomb warrior 7/10 on day 2?
---
Huh. Guess I was p lucky with 7 legendaries out of that..
---
Duplicated legendaries were the biggest fuck you ever, it’s great that they don’t exist anymore. I wish epics were changed too. It wouldn’t change the economy much for most people (I had something like 4 dupe epics) but it’s really shitty to open the same epic again when you are still missing a bunch of them.
---
Its fun to play, good, and expensive.  
---
Which means anyone who went all in on it is going to play the shit out of it cause they can't afford to pivot.  
---
Then in a month or so Blizzard can nerf something in it after all of the rest of us bitch about it for long enough. By then we'll praise them for doing so.
---
And all those people who crafted all the shit for it will now be forced to move to something else and spend again.
---
It'll be true eventually. When human civilization falls I guarantee you WoW will die
---
Because it says year of the Raven when it is currently year of the Dragon. Maybe someone at Blizzard will see this and fix it.
---
This is my spirit animal
---
What does this have to do with this:  
---
&gt; We got vargoth instead, packs came in form of the quests (more packs than usual if you count the packs from the other sets)
---
Yeah looks like a repost, seen plenty of these already on this sub🤔
---
I agree, but I understand why they don't do it for epics.
---
What's the point of Mecha'thun in XxFroBro45xX #197 Legend Bomb Warrior? 
---
Is it just a big body with rush? I don't see a reliable way to activate it.
---
Hmm you raise a good point. I might give it a spin in shudderwock. Problem is there are just too many good battlecries.
---
You like playing warrior?
---
Dr Boom: Mad Genuis (the Jaraxxus of Warrior, but better).
---
Zilliax
---
Hold off on everything else.
---
I either cast only one spell or just go all out because 50% chance to hit face
---
Call the police, you were robbed.
---
I opened 39 packs and get 3 legendaries, one was golden Rafaam I have so much fun with all of them
---
So you want a deck that's good against everything?O.o then wouldn't everyone be playing that particular deck then and you would complain again?
---
Bomb Warrior is 60%+ win rate, I've seen one hovering around 64-67% on HSReplay.
---
Nothing from last meta was remotely like that.
---
Odd Paladin was maxing out at 59% at it's peak.
---
No, that’s a different play mode. That’s heroic Tavern brawl. With the rewards being much higher.
---
3 legendaries in 91 packs so far soooo
---
4000+ upvotes but only 500 signatures...
---
[[Waggle Pick]] is good because it is generally drawn with [[Raiding Party]] which makes it a 4 mana 4/2 weapon with an easy to proc [[Shadowstep]] and a 0 mana 3/3 taunt in [[Dread Corsair]]. Despite [[Heistbaron Togwaggle]] having the highest pay off, most of the minions in your deck work well with the pick. [[EVIL Miscreant]] is one of the highlights of the deck with pick because he gives lots of lackeys which have good battlecries and actually help secure the board.
---
What about the people who don't want to play every minion is random and casts a random spell for the millionth time?
---
New expac expectation -&gt; bomb warrior, big shaman, handlock, silence priest, yeah baby here I come to legend taking advantage of the new meta!

Lucky you!

We "flipped out" because we didn't want to have to pay money. How is that so hard to understand? The monetization model sucked, and all they did to change it was tie it to a special promotion or a new expansion release (rare) or make it a part of a pack bundle.
---
The feedback this subreddit gave was "make the skins payable with gold", and the feedback they took away from it was "make us pay for more packs to get the skins"
---
NICE.

I might be a little arrogant but you're obviously a jerk and you and "the community" clearly don't have a counter-argument.
---
That’s a big benefit. A weakness in burgle rogue in standard is that you are basically choosing between playing pilfer which is pretty terrible or playing a weak underbelly fence on turn 2. Consistent buffed fences on 2 will make that card bananas in arena
---
Oblivitron is one of the higher winrate cards in Mech Hunter, which is currently just a hair below Tier 1.
---
You and me, we can shake hands. Most of my games I get the worst opening, mulligan it away to redraw half of the same hand again, the other player has his god tier opener and I always have my needed cards at the bottom.
---
For fun reference: I was playing bomb warrior and shuffled a total of 8 bombs in the other deck. When I was in fatigue, the other player still had 12 cards remaining in his deck. 8 of those cards were bombs....
---
Next match, I finally get a good flow with Elekk and shuffle a grand total of 16 bombs in the other deck and I get my Dr Boom out with a full board of bombs. The other player somehow managed to survive 14 of those bombs as a fellow warrior (I can't even recall how he managed to heal or armor up for that much) and in the end, he still won on fatigue...
---
Meanwhile, the entire internet is calling this deck extremely strong / OP, but I have yet to win a match with it, and due to the controll nature of it, each match takes at least 10 minutes just to end in another loss :(
---
But then Blastmaster Boon comes and fills the board with boom bots
---
I actually pulled Whiz out of a pack a few months ago and forgot about him. Played him for the first time last night with the new set. I thought it was a pretty awesome way to see some new cards. So, yeah, I'm on board with moving him into classic.
---
Yeah, if only I had a scaled nightmare!
---
My thinking?
---
The 3/5 is a mediocre stat line. And while it kills *some* large minions, those minions are most often used in wall decks that bring them back. And priest can remove the Kodo with a common 2-cost spell.
---
Compared to other 5-cost cards and removal tools that don’t have restrictions, the card is just very niche.
---
But they already have 1 Horde Warrior and 1 Alliance Warrior.  
---
Time for a neutral-ish Warrior.
---
Skillstone^^^^tm
---
So I have never opened 2 legendaries before in the same pack till RoS. Firs time it happens though, and it is on my alt account... except it was two golden legendaries ... pretty stoked considering it only had 35 packs.
---
Yep I have a feeling this is going to be the new hated deck.
---
It's quite powerful, good late game, good come back mechanisms, and RNG heavy (can hit all the bombs early and just lose).
---
A lot of people thought the bomb cards would be a mean but here we go.
---
Expecting a lot of weapon hate to join the meta between this and all the rogue builds so that may help counter it a little.
---
Stop it. Get some help.
---
Whizbang is boomsday...not the 3 that got rotated...
---
There's a Rafaam Zoolock hovering around 66% win rate on HSReplay after like 3,000 games.  
---
Just everyone is too busy playing Bomb Warrior to notice or give old man Zoo a spin.
---
https://youtu.be/AsYy3fEJlXk
---
This video was cool, and you have the two main legendaries, maybe this helps? Idk.
---
I've had a few good runs so far, only actually lost two games, my friggin tablet keeps crashing and I'm not sure why, not gonna play again until I'm on my PC again. SMH
---
Anyway GG to you, what loot did you get?
---
I was playing rush warrior before expansion and pulling in a good 60% winrate at rank 7. I think it has the most potential because of so many viable packages; rush, mech, dragon, bomb. A best of all control warrior is still a couple weeks away but finally warrior can flex. 
---
Warlock has become almost unplayable. Main thing that was till keeping Zoo afloat was Genn and Keleseth. Cube is gone, Discard never picked up, and the imp package seems terrible. Maybe some control warlock around Rafaam.
---
Secret Paladin can become a thing, I think it needs a solid midrange. It can lose steam pretty fast to control warrior.
---
It’s been one day into the new expansion. Chill.
---
Oh right, I tried once so far.  There was an event in my town, I went (which was awkward, because it was listed as a public event, but I showed up and it was a college campus... I snuck in when someone opened a door (I actually had my student ID from a couple years prior but not on me...) And NO EVENT.  I walked around everywhere, logged in, no one was playing near me.  I checked all the rooms.. was so annoyed.
---
I reported the event to blizzard, but never heard back.
---
😦
---
What's the best counter to Bomb warrior? It's all I queue into.
---
Mally hunter, what a time to alive
---
I’m glad you’re beating them! Hopefully it’s discourage them from playing it 😜
---
Oof another ad hominem attack

Had that happen to me a few times. They might be trying to avoid the 5 damage that comes from running [[Auchenai Soulpriest]].

Yeah, I figured a zoo would eventually pop up.  Zoo usually pops up after the first few days of the expansion

4/3/5 | Your cards and powers that restore Health now deal damage instead.  
---
I agree with you, Brawliseum just after release is amazing
---
charge doesnt give charge. it gives rush
---
Oh man, that sucks... They really should make it a little bit more obtainable somehow.
---
The rank 25 explains it. What's a wild card though? Like from an expansion that's no longer in the store?
---
Nefarian as a warlock hero would have the best lines, especially if they print Ashkandi.
---
I’ve noticed that the new Murloc shaman can really give mech hunter some problems though, but other than that the deck seems really good. Especially if you can get the oblivitron into whelp and get a ton of 7/7s
---
dang, people keep reposting this
---
Surely any reasonable person can freely admit than when the “counter” to a deck is to burn your own draw (especially when only one class can reliably do that), then *maaaybe* there’s a problem that needs to be addressed?
---
You didn't address my points you just called them stupid with no basis. Try to make a more compelling argument next time.
---
To someone else. I'm disabling inbox replies. I think after reading this thread more I'm really gonna have to stop going to gaming subreddits. They're just a nonstop whining fest with the same garbage again and again where people aren't actually interested in a discussion they just wanna cry about something. I went in more detail in another reply, and I think I'm just gonna give up. It ain't worth it.
---
Have a nice day.
---
let’s do some math. 
---
20 + 7 + 7 - 7 = 27. 
---
You have 20 cards in your deck. You shuffle in 7 cards. Elk shuffles in 7 cards (1 for each card shuffled). You draw 7 cards. You end up with 27 cards in deck.
---
Lol. Well, trust me, hunter has been better than it was last expansion. On more than one occasion I believe. But ***particular*** on the occasion of Undertaker Hunter.
---
No idea why you're being downvoted. Not everyone can or should like every single brawl. So if this happens to be the one you don't like then at least you can get out with your free pack very quickly. 
---
Yes this one isn't fun or wacky and is basically just ladder, but some of us actually like that because of the reward structure.
---
I respect you for this. However, to me, it’s weird you call it “fatal” everyone I’ve ever watched, played with, against, etc. calls it lethal
---
Oh shit that was me! One of my favorite cards to get off dragon roar for sure, that was a hell of a moment.

I swear to god I’ve never actually seen someone use the word “fewer” on Reddit. I’m pretty sure 99% of the people on here don’t know how or when to use it at all.
---
weapon removal, heals, deck manipulation
---
I don’t think I’ll ever get used to a voice that isnt Dan Green
---
People are acting like it is but it really isn't yet. There's plenty of other decks performing great in general as well and also some that counter is particularly well.
---
There’s a reason a hearthstone limits boards to 7 minions.
---
Why are you gay?
---
Ugh, I hate playing against Rogues. I haven't had a fun game against one yet and I really hope they don't become the go-to deck.

Ayy another dragon shaman!
---
I had an incredible game against bomb warrior last night as battlecry shaman. I stole their bomb thrower with MCT. Proceeded to bounce it back to my hand and play it at least 5 times, and pulled out a win when I was near the point of conceding halfway through the game. 
---
If you can't beat them... join them? I had more bombs in their deck by the end than they had in mine!
---
27 packs, (2/3) legendaries.
---
Oblivitron, and Arch Villian Rafaam, also I got Prince Liam from the quest that gave a Witchwood pack.
---
Pretty happy with my legendaries but I am a little disappointed in how many traveling healers I got (over 6).
---
That doesn’t mean that’s the meta. Those are just the top decks from the first day...
---
I got lunara for quite some time, but don't get how to use her, can anyone help?
---
I made this deck. :)
---
That’s really unfair to Gwent.
---
What are you spending your gold on? I'm f2p and bought 90 packs yesterday. I'll probably buy 75 for 2nd expansion this year and another 75 on the 3rd. The returns really start to diminish after that.
---
Just because weapon tech can be run in a deck doesn't mean it always will be. Plus, most of the popular Bomb Warrior lists currently do not (Control Warrior is but that is a different enough deck), and that deck is probably better off teching for aggression rather than pretty much only one of two popular decks right now that actually are playing weapons.
---
What's funny is that before koft, mind blast was unplayable trash.
---
&gt; reasonable
---
I don't see how, Blizzard would literally be throwing their money away. Card games are designed to be RNG based to get you to gamble on packs, it'd kind of just how it is, because it works. No I don't like it but you can't expect them to give you a full set for one lump sum, because then you won't keep buying more packs.
---
Not always, but every deck has access to weapon removal. If you're also not playing specifically against Control Warrior, you're probably going to be fairly safe.
---
As a player who is trying to use a slower version of secret pally, I appreciate this post
---
A lot of decks ran him without the corpsetaker package just because of how good he was. It's just a solid card.
---
I think what this comes down to is the more that someone has to craft, the more likely they are to have buyer's remorse, thinking that they should've spent their valuable dust on something better and blame themselves for not spending it more carefully.
---
Because this game's reward structure only rewards winning (a dilemma in the truest sense of the word), players are told by the game that winning is the only thing that will advance you whether that's in arena, ranked, or standard. It's thus difficult to justify doing something sub-optimal in the name of fun, because you're delaying your progress to that next pack, that new opportunity to make your collection more versatile, in the name of playing a deck that by definition will lose more games.
---
Then you either played the deck wrong or made a bad deck or got super unlucky I don't know what you want me to say. Midrange hunter is a known hard counter to control warrior.
---
The only useful criteria for word definitions is common use. If a misuse becomes common enough it's no longer a misuse. Every word you know was once "wrong".
---
Go to your collection where you normally see the cards you own. Now look at the very TOP RIGHT. There are two tabs, one for card backs and one for heroes, go to the heroes and set Lunara as your favorite Druid
