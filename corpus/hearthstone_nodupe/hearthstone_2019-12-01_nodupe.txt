uh what, this is a shaman dragon card.......
---
---
---
Lemme guess, SNIP-Lock player who thought they were being smart and skipping animation times.
---
Salty as a mug.
---
Helpless baby dragon- 1 mana 1/1 dragon. Battlecry: Draw 2 dragons from your deck.
---
Bonus points if opponent survives but your shudderwock then makes 6 copies of its self
---
Way too strong, def fake
---
I want to be just like Medivh!
---
Ye
---
What does it means with Snip Lock and Animation skipping?
---
Highroll doesn't mean insane or game-winning though. It means getting the highest quality outcome out of a number of outcomes.
---
I would greet back but you need to be quick since I usually squelch after 15 seconds or so.
---
I often do this but in casual.  For me what makes this a true act of kindness is seeing it done in arena lol
---
Makes sense. I know that now my post will look like me showing off that I understood all battlegrounds first time I've tried them (I'll just delete the post) I just thought it is very intuitive. I've got most things right first time I've tried it ( a few games) I sure watched some pros do it afterwards and they were doing exact same thing I did. I'm not saying I'm some strategic genius, I suck at arena and overall at hearthstone but I thought that battleground were very obvious if even as bad player as me found them easy. I'm not saying you're worse than me at hearthstone, Im just saying that I find battlegrounds easy
---
By 100 package to get quicker animations!
---
99% of the times when someone greets you when they have lethal is to add a little salt to the wound(then they kill you), of course most people won't see as 'common courtesy' to greet back.
---

---
If it was a good fair match, it's worth greeting before losing. The rest depends if you are in a good or bad mood.
---
And then you get Mal'Ganis.
---
Buff cards didn’t come my way very often this run.
---
&gt;  You don't play this in super slow Shaman decks
---
normal quest shaman or anything that runs hagatha usually ends up with a pretty full hand.
---
&gt; "ANIMATIONS: OFF" option
---
this. please.
---
3 years ago.
---
They should un-nerf Experimenter.
---
Definitely, my mobile is not visibly struggling with the animations but when comparing it to PC performance it's on average always slower. A lot of people have been reporting this on the official forums too, as the turn timer in battlegrounds often is an issue on the later turns when making use of such a device.
---
If I already have 8 cards in hand drawing 8 does nothing.
---
if its a ranked mode game its about competition and competition is mainly about winning, cause winning means improving and in an "greater" view it could mean more money(probably only at high legend in this game but first you need to get there)  
---
ofc there are always people out there that don't care but still play ranked, because its a better environment.
---
im pretty sure i frozen more than 5 when i get the hero buffing  frozen minions
---
I took my eyes off of the screen for ten seconds after I removed their Sonya and when I looked back they had a Lich King and ten mana. I didn't get disconnected and even if I did I don't know how that would explain it.
---
Then just make the game speed 2x for everyone.
---
I didn't miss it but I took the screenshot too late.
---
Don't hear it.
---
I mean... people feel the need to create low effort "look what the meanie said to me" posts after they add them knowing full well what to expect. Not much of a difference between this dude and OP, both looking for attention.
---
Hmmm he's not mirrored, so would this be his lefthanded twin brother?
---
We're not talking about an 8/8 for 8, but about the edge case where you randomly get the chance to play a 5/5 for 5. Burning cards on turn five doesn't matter in a midrange deck, and if your opponent hexes your five drop, that's not that bad of an outcome either. If it's turn 20 then you obviously just wait a turn for the card to transform into something else. That's the whole point after all. For some decks and situations, it'll be a high roll and for some it'll be a low roll. There's not much of a discussion to be had without an actual scenario.
---
People will force close hearthstone as soon as the combat phase starts in order to get more time than their opponents.
---
My technique is to reply "but I'm just a 12 year old Muslim girl playing on my dad's account - please don't swear." 
---
Proper ban bait.
---
Shes good if you go baron and have a huge death rattle package otherwise shes kinda garbo
---
oh yeah..that..
---
I've never seen someone in 3rd or 4th lose MMR, does that really happen?
---
That sounds like your hardware is trash my advice go to solo adventures and load a bot game inkeeper to fire it up so no issues and then take it from there also u need a 2gb ram on your device to run bg properly I have ipad 3 and it cant run bg iy will crash half way
---
I wish they just nerfed snipsnap instead
---
What?
---
If you're facing that in Casual, it's probably because you're winning too much tbh. In my casual level (in Wild too, to be fair, not sure it effects) there is a 50% competitive decks, 30% tier 3-4 decks, 10% meme decks and 10% new-player decks, which isn't bad!

I’d tell you but I can’t remember what it’s called. Or what it does.  
---
I also don’t actually know what any of the cards mentioned here so far so, and I’ve been playing since Naxx, so I’ve definitely seen them at some point.
---
I met a team on Rocket League once, I’m assuming they were down ranking because the season was ending, and they had us beat like 8-2. With 15 seconds left, they scored a goal, then voted to forfeit, so we got the win.
---
My current meme deck of choice is quest warlock without plot twist, just using mecha'thun as a wincon. Other decks I've done include murloc rogue and odd taunt druid
---
Nice
---
You queue at the same time and hope it sticks you together
---
Looks pretty cool. Think I'll give it a shot :)
---
This definitely ain't it chief, all I play in casual is shitty secret paladin or literal 30 murloc decks to complete quests. Anything with a semblance of strength goes to ranked because I'm not a hypocrite , people really are just cunts tbh, they probably concede streak to match up against shitty decks so they can feel better about themselves
---
Only a fuul would underestimate Gruul
---
You can play this one in highlander, for whatever that’s worth.
---
Actually, when I play sniplock I find that ~20% of my losses would have been victories had all my minions been 100/150. So yes, it would be a big deal.
---
Is there one for every class?
---
The real trick is to Dragonqueen Alexstrasza into original recipe Alexstrasza, then do this all at once. EZ.
---
For people unaware the Hearthstone portion will be on the 5th 6th and 9th, yet the players involved have no idea whether the Doom in the Tomb cards will still be in standard at that point.
---
Jia was getting kind of mad on twitter, because half the devs are saying the event ends on the 5th (with the major DoD patch) and the other half are saying the 10th (with the release of DoD). Imagine competing for a gold medal and the developers are too incompetent to tell you what meta you'll be playing.
---
I do miss the sorry button, actually. I get that it was easily misinterpreted or used for BM but there are so many times I honestly just want to say sorry.
---
You forgot basically all legendary minions from this set.

Everyone is on the Battleground grind.

Given this year's debacle, would &lt;Chinese girl&gt;  be more effective? Kudos on soaking up the insults in order to better the community.

Haven't tried it myself yet, but if this is a way to skip animations on the longest turns when it really matters, this might save you some frustration. More people need to be made aware if it works.
---
Sure that's exactly what I meant
---
What would this do? Allow you to permanently buff things like hyena and junkbot?
---
Cenarius is also not too shabby. 5 mana, gives you 2 2/2s or +1/+1 to your board.
---
He also synergizes with S-S!

What kind of combos in Pokémon did they have to nerf? I’ve only played with the starter decks and there were no combos remotely strong that I saw (and can’t really imagine any because there weren’t any great effects)
---
I had a similar run with Patchwerk just now.  Did ya win?
---
Wow! This is great how did you manage to make it so gross and horrible to look at?
---
What a coincidence, neither does this card, yet.
---
Actually, you very much do. Is Zapp good or a liability? Do you need to clear multiple divine shields? Do they have massive health that requires poisonous? These are things you need to remember about your opponents. You know who your next opponent is, so if you know their comp, you can optimize your recruit and positioning.
---
Or you can play at a lower level. It's your choice.
---
i think the animation overall should be skipped, it gets really frustrating to see 6 1/1 s attack a poisonous minion and having to wait for all of those animations
---
Dogs got it all man.

Good looks, great game play instincts, and a chat that wants your shirt off.

I read it as a satire and at least I'm entertained as I'm having my morning coffee. It's probably not meant as such, but a man has to keep himself feasted with amusement if the context doesn't provide it. Even with little imagination if that's what it takes.
---
In this example we have two fine gentlemen arguing whether the written phrase is a joke or not on a forum dedicated to a card game that's based on a video game filled with orcs, dwarves, elves, magic and a jolly good time.
---
It's good to have these light-hearted discussions in the midst of the current, more serious events such as mobile performance and the state of the standard meta.
---
Now if you'll excuse me, my cup of coffee is empty  and I have to tend to my civic duties.
---
since when are protoss stalkers called "mages".
---
Fuck off.
---
No one's saying you run two pyroblasts
---
the timer is shared by your battle and recruit phases.
---
so if you have a looong battle time, you'll have a shorter recruit time. and it works the same way in reverse.
---
there's no getting around it until the devs fix the animation problems in hs, the number one culprit is tokens and poison animation.
---
This is so sad and embarrassing.
---
I feel like it may be deliberate to just make the games go faster... either way, it's dumb as hell.
---
Is another mans potpourri.
---
I would suggest not do it. Because there might be a risk of getting banned if u do it again and again.
---
Great attitude, too. Jokes aside, he's one of the most pleasant and reasonable to watch streamers of any game.
---
Luna's Pocket Galaxy, the Mage spell that made you top deck a one mana King Phaoris on turn six.
---
First, you're on the wrong subreddit. Not saying that in a mean way but you will not get good advice coming to this sub. I highly recommend checking out /r/CompetitiveHS as it's the sub reddit for competitive discussions. 
---
That being said, evaluating plays is a difficult process, but that you're thinking about it means you're on the right track. First there are a couple of basics you want to make sure you're doing. 
---
Order: This is really important and something people mess up a lot, but in what order should you play your cards to most optimally make a turn. Obvious one is needing some card to make another card function, like having a dragon in hand do x card, make sure you play that before the dragon. Thats the most obvious example but order is something that comes up in hearthstone all the time.
---
If you are ever going to play a discover, or some card which draws/generates a card, you typically want to do that first before playing your other card, as you may end up with a better answer for the mana you'd use your other card on. 
---
Second is placement.
---
Board placement can be very important, you want to think about where you're positioning the minions on the board. Its a bit of a meme, but playing around cards like [[crushing walls]] or some other cards which damage neighbors is important. The most popular card which punished minion placement in the last year or so of hearthstone was [[SuperCollider]]
---
Third Trade/Face
---
Its important to know when you're the beat down deck, and when you have a life/minion advantage and you can afford to go face. A lot of the time newer players get stuck on always trading and they end up sacrificing what could be lethal by trying to keep their opponents board empty. Your opponents minions often times are not a threat you have  to deal with. This is obviously extremely match up dependent, but if you have the more powerful board, a lot of the time you can force your opponent to have to respond to the board by going face.
---
Keep in mind opponents spells, are you coming into turn 7 where a flamestrike might swing the board back in their favor? Are you playing vs a shaman who may be able to bloodlust you if you leave their board unanswered? Think about what are your opponents outs, what could be in his deck which saves him from this situation, and are you in a position where you can afford to play around them?  A lot of the time as agro you'll end up having to play disrespectful against opponents board clears and go all in because if you go slow and trade you'll lose pace and run out of steam before you can close. This is the meat and potatoes of hearthstone, learning this takes time and even pros don't make optimal plays every time. Try and learn from your losses, and I highly recommend running a deck tracker. 
---
Here are some of the basics, if you have more specific questions about game states and match ups hit me up or head over to competitive hearthstone sub, those guys are awesome.

This *miiight* see play in any deck that runs a few dragons, or a couple OP dragons, or lots of OP dragons, or any class that likes running dragons with dragons after an expansion that primarily focuses on dragons is released.

Who designed this expansion? Unbelievable...
---
Cheers!

What Neon said \^

Except no condition lol

Is this real? Unbelievable.

I mean, we could see something’s in the Solo Adventure I guess. So we can still wait for it
---
While I've given up hope and accepted that Dragons will make up half of ladder for the next four months, I'm still hoping that they'll be partailly reliant on cards from the year of the raven. Firetree Witchdoctor, Crowd Roaster, Scaleworm and Dragonmaw Scorcher will all rotate out and hoooooopefully something like Twilight Drake might also be getting HOFed.
---
That plus the next set will hopefully mean that we're not about to have 16 months of Dragons dominating ladder.
---
There's a +74 to the side which means this has to be base 8 or higher. I'm going to go ahead and assume it's base 33 meaning Dog has achieved a rank of... 1,185,954
---
Where the hell do you find all these Gentle Megasaurs? They're all extinct for me.
---
I was willing to take a wait-and-see approach on the other stuff, since Dragons were still potentially looking a little top-heavy, but now there's mana cheat too...
---
How does that reconcile the many of the best players from other formats or games being at the top of the leaderboards?
---
Resurrect Priest can be a tricky deck to play, but basically your decisions need to come down to how you're going to survive. You need to consider what threats your opponent has and when the best time to use your board clears is. Sometimes it's best to tank damage for a turn if you can set up a more devastating play the next turn.
---
When thinking back on games, you should reflect on how your opponent was able to beat you down and if you could have played differently to stop their early aggression.
---
We have a spell called "DOOM!", but when are we finally going to get a spell named "BOOM!"?
---
High roll in CW. This card hit Alex and you draw deckhand when play Galakrond
---
Then turn 10 you can hero power= 8 atk, alex your opponent face then innerage the deckhand to deal 16 dmg for a OTK from nowhere
---
I had the same issue with the arena quests we had during Halloween.. I still have the damn thing sitting around just in case we get another free pass.
---
The hell if I know, I've followed exact protocols and procedures people followed using datamining and shit. It resulted in squat all nothing.
---
Battleground guide when?
---
Will see play in every single deck that run dragons, with the exception of perhaps Dragon Mage. Dragon Mage has better discount card, albeit slower.
---
It might be a teaser for the next year's theme. We usually had some teasers for upcoming expansions and so on in adventures (although they were mostly subtle, this seems a bit too obvious).
---
Literally no drawback. It has the perfect stats for a 4 drop along with an overpowered battlecry..
---
YOLO... oh wait
---
Best card of a dragon set
---
he did? i dont remember that, are you sure he did?
---
Isnt there a distinction between minions bought from the pool and generated ones? Why would the pool grow if the generated didnt return there?
---
This fucking game sometimes
---
Oh look, this post again
---
The biggest issue with the card is that it takes time to actually do anything. This card has no effect at all the turn your play it, and its statline, while acceptable, doesn’t do much to contest the board. If you’re running this in a deck with only 7-8 dragons in particular, it might take more then a few turns to draw a dragon, and by that point in time, the discount might not have much of an effect with respect to all the other crazy stuff that might be happening/have happened by then. The card definitely seems strong in theory due to its potentially-massive mana cheat, but looking at it from a Wild perspective, if your deck contains only a moderate number of dragons, the value to be reaped just comes too late, when the outcome of the game could have already been decided. I therefore do not expect this to see play in Dragon Inner Fire Priest or in Mind Blast Priest. Perhaps it will find a home in greedier decks like Reno Dragon Mage (which I think will work out) that can run a lot of good (but heavy) dragons and have the sustainability to reach the late game.
---
Of course I could be wrong, but this is just how I see the card as of now.
---
How fucking sensitive can you be?
---
I only count two
---
The second joke is that there is no joke.
---
More mana cheating/reduction? Hasn't damn near EVERY big issue stemmed from Mana reduction? Can we just stop pushing it?
---
I don't even play chess. It was just a good example of a competitive 2 player game that's been around since before the internet.
---
&gt;  Why have they made this expansion so powerful?
---
I mean...it's kind of been the tradition for Blizzard to make the final expansion of the year the strongest for the past several years
---
Not sure why you're surprised
---
Izi
---
Not exactly a hard condition to meet, with how hard they're pushing dragons to work.
---
A 7 mana Malygos could give you lethal with something as simple as Frostbolt or Mind Blast. So...yes, probably
---
Ruuruuruuruuruu
---
You don't have 8 cards on turn 5 tho
---
Congratulations, I guess.
---
I think you meant Call to Arms?
---
Staka beat me
---
That's why you need to draw this ASAP. Or, better yet, mulligan for it to have it go off immediately. Even better with Hex Lord Malacrass (as it gives you a second copy for even further cost reduction) or Barista, for example
---
YOLT!
---
Guess I won't be playing this expansion then. Never had less gold before an expansion as I have right now and I sure as hell won't spend any cash on it...
---
But with this cancer of Shaman and Druid everywhere I just can't be arsed farming up gold.
---
that's fine, I'll dust the dupes and craft the ones worth crafting
---
I dunno, I think the one in Chump's latest video takes the cake.
---

---
You mean r/hearthstone?
---
Yeah, at least give it worse stats so you lose a bit of tempo. This is crazy
---
prep was not a issue at all.
---
but the nerf wouldve been fine if they changed other rogue spells at all.
---
As like 5years(or more depending on how far ahead they planned the nerf adn designed around old) of spells were balanced and designed around preperation.
---
Prep never caused issues before(and for the standard kingsbane it was raiding party what made it good)
---
the app is so well developed it hurts
---
Did you have a stroke while typing this?
---
Yes you would never pick it but it can be offered I'm sure, I've definitely been offered elusive which does nothing.
---
Thank you so much! I'll definetely try it asap.
---
I get that, but me leaving my big boi in the tavern while I go take 15 damage is not how I win games.
---
if you like wild streamers, dane still plays a significant chunk of his stream playing ladder. He'll also play some BG or other card games from time to time, but Wild HS is where his heart is.
---
But... if you had 2 Khadgars, and you were doing this strat, you needed 4 more board spaces open... so you had 1 unit and 2 khadgars, plus whatever you got out of the triple. How would that not just lose to murlocs/menagerie/mechs/beasts/anything that was building up over the course of the game?
---
...what am I missing here?
---
Yep
---
Hmm putting Rag far right will make almost no difference then in a battle.
---
Where did he went?
---
Well, I'd prefer standard streamers anyway but thanks for the tip at least I suppose.
---
I laughed more than i should!
---
At 23k gold, you’re set through the next full expansion year if you barely play!
---
hmm fair enough. I do wish that this creep wasn't so extreme. oh well.
---
People are acting like it though, with the upvotes this is getting.
---
Sorry I'm out of the loop here, who is "the awards guy" and how did he leave ?
---
Saw Kripp do a comp with triples of this and triples of security rover with cobalt... worked very well through the midgame. Cards like this make the mode interesting. Weak 90% of the time but find that special build, sometimes by accident, and you propel yourself into the final 4.
---
“Bruh”
---
Even if you don’t play the actual dragon synergy deck, this can be used in Alex+Malygos otk deck as well.
---
That's how he keeps it spicy
---
And the new one is balanced around power creep.
---
Still better than Boogeymonster and Threshadon...
---
That's where I started as well, "what would the perfect comp for this card be?" But it got me nowhere, no combo with this card is strong, if you got something this card would be swapped first, it got no impact. 
---
Even if it was buffed to "at the end of your turn give taunt +2 attack it would probably not hold up, maybe be played once or twice.
---
I think Uldum was more annoying than anything just because of how many times I would restart to reroll the first treasure because it would garentee I would get to the last boss. The best treasure in the game, IMO, is the playing odd-cost cards reduce the cost of cards in hand by 1.
---

Of course it shouldn't be made. Just debating whether it would actually be good. No real point of comparison as most cards with downsides have smaller stat advantage, but controllable downsides.

So I’m going to have enough dust to craft 4-5 legendaries. This seems like an auto craft, what else from this set it auto craft at this point?
---
fuck off
---
You feel like dying when you're alone?
---
Weird decision in my opinion. Now players have to redo their decks for a whoping 5 days. Not that I'm not happy that this meta finally ended, but would have been cleaner to end it two weeks ago or just with the release of the next expansion.
---
OTK if both dragons cost 1
---
This would required me playing hunters. No thanks
---
An arcane shot that draws a card would see play just about any where.
---
Unpopular opinion: This card is only good for malygos or other combo decks. People overrate it too much.
---
* Doesn't effect the board.
---
* Doesn't effect the hand.
---
* 4 mana
---
* Not even a dragon.
---
* Dragons don't benefit from cost reduction except for malygos/alex combos. Same reason Emperor isn't used in midrange decks.
---
I beat Heroic Tekhan by cheesing it. Basically I restarted until I got Reno's Lasso and stole Rakanishu.
---
They’ve already stated the animation will be removed in the next patch. This is posted constantly.
---
Or some people stopped playing because Free Hong Kong.
---
And also because it was becoming a very stale game with nerfs/buffs being the source of current meta due to broken stuff in the game
---
He shout Golden Common like it's worth a lot.
---
Oh yeah that, I honestly forgot what portrait is given with it.
---
Call to arms sends it’s regards
---
lol
---
None of these two cards is drawing, it’s a discover effect, one deals dmg to yourself the other to enemy minions but has a requirement to be fully used. Both have up and downs.
---
&gt;Will the meta really become worse because of this new set ? 
---
No. Stronger sets do not directly correlate with bad Standard formats.
---
&gt;Do you think less (or more) people will spend money for this expansion ? 
---
Exciting cards and the Hero portrait seem to be what get people to pre-order, and every class is quite clearly doing exciting things.
---
Given how conditional all of the most exciting cards are (Galakrod, the Breath cycle) or what some cards are "power creeping" (Amber Watcher), this will end up being a fairly typical end-of-the-year set.
---
Good riddance. Trash meta.
---
I stopped playing when the handful of wild cards rotated back in. At the time, I said I'd come back when the next expansion released, but every card I've seen is just more evidence that the devs have no idea how to balance their game. It's like they learned nothing from Knights or KnC. I think I might be done.
---
NA - Vil#1468 quest trade
---
In terms of card advantage, discovering a card and drawing one are identical. You're going to be playing Arcane Shot in a Mage deck with eight or more dragons in it, so that condition will be meaningless in at least that particular deck.
---
Agreed, although I think theres a place for the beast. Boogeymonster and Threshadon are pure garbage and need to be replaced.
---
What reward do you receive if you defeat all 5 bosses?
---
Ok, Karen.
---
Demons.
---
I don't see a place for The Beast, what am I missing? It's slightly over statted but unlike a Murloc it isn't easily buffed with keywords, and its scaling with stats is nothing compared to Cave Hydra or Rat Pack. It has a negative Deathrattle as well.
---
Yeah OP you probably already have enough for all the good *and* fun cards
---
Thanks for the story grandpa.
---
They're completely different cards
---
So there was an alpha ?
---
oh. so this is why they rotated mind blast out
---
He's my boy too.
---
Best card in the deck
---
Yes, come to funland, it's fun
---
I’m over here getting greeted to death and roped when my opponent has lethal
---
Images you can hear
---
&gt; Snip Snap was NOT balanced against animation times
---
...yes it is.
---
&gt; the OTK's involving him and mechawarper or other cost reduction stuff is wild olny, and probably wasn't considered important when they created the card.
---
I know. I play wild. It’s pretty obvious blizzard doesn’t care about it. Doesn’t mean snip snap isn’t a problem.
---
Will you stop going on about the stupid name lol. He’s called Dancin Deryl because his portrait is of a dancing murloc. He was originally a boss from Dalaran Heist. He wasn’t created specifically for battlegrounds.
---
I require legend rank, Jon.
---
Post confirmed
---
Followed by Earth Shock.
---
wild tho
---
with the power level of the set i thought this was real until i saw the title
---
Is the worst design yet since Gagetzan
---
wah wah wah
---
You're supposed to only be able to get 50s from rerolling 60s
---
Congrats! Me and my friend racing each other to complete it a while ago was one of my favorite hearthstone experiences.
---
Agreed. Every streamer only plays BGs now and they aren't fun to watch.
---
Rip wild? Why?
---
I was thinking of having the art turn green for when they hit.
---
Then summon blood of the ancient one
---
&gt; This sub, for the most, a long with most of the community in general outside the hardcore base (and sometimes even them lol), is pretty clueless on judging cards Power level
---
cute. I'll remember to touch your shoulder when you are back complaining about this card in a couple of weeks..
---
Dog could say something and all of a sudden cut his viewer count in half. Maybe a new game comes out and Dog sucks at it, so he loses half? There is a ton of uncertainty in streaming. And if you live your life like you are going to have 10k+ viewers every stream for 5 years then maybe shit happens.
---
At the end of the day streamers are kids who came into a lot of wealth through gaming. It wouldn’t be a shock if most aren’t fiscally responsible.
---
Not funny anymore
---
Sigh here and initial there please
---
I'm sure you have never ever been wrong about judging a card . Ever.
---
Waaack ! Golden ? Come on...
---
Hilariously incompetent.
---
Reward is a card back, but only for defeating the final boss
---
But they always do that and that is totally understandable. They print legendary cards with potentially very powerful effects. If they don't break the game they print it on normal cards to make this effect more consistent and maybe make it a little bit better. And yeah, effect may be the same, but the cards are not exactly the same. New card has different, less restrictive requirement, better mana efficiency (cost and stats) and some additional synergy with dragon tribe. Inkmaster wasn't that strong, it didn't carry highlander archetype, it was just good enough to put it in singleton deck(not always though). I'm fine with it to be honest.
---
And I really like new sets. Few days ago I was checking out cards from older sets (GvG and WotoG) and so many cards in these sets are very boring or are filler cards. In newer expansions they try to make almost every card interesting. Even if they are not competitive, they have interesting effects. I think they improved much on designing cards in their expansions. Yeah, they still have a lot things to improve (F2P experience and some other problems), but in recent months they make a very good job with Hearthstone. I also appreciate that they try to keep game very fresh. We never had so much content. It always was new expansion, maybe one month of fun, very reluctant nerfs and 3 months of waiting for another expansion in very stale meta.
---
Nice meme you got there, I THINK I WILL TAKE IT!
---
OK thanks
---
You were already downvoted when I commented. You didn't engage in actual discussion about the effect. You just said it's stronger without mentioning the significant downsides in comparison to the other effect.
---
Damn 376 is quite the big boy
---
Did you sell all your minions and let the turn timer hit?
---
Why am i hearing this .jpg ?!
---
[NA] Have quest. Add me. TheAcer#1931
---
You must go first. I'll show.
---
[Done]
---
Yea, luckily the last guy only had 1 poison amalgam so i didn’t get beaned
---
When you get to play it all 3 times with a bran on board, it can be quite large. You're not super far off in this pic
---
Maybe it would need a good statline for such a cost, since it's a legendary let's make it a 7/7
---
Don't quite understand why someone down voted you there good fellow. Have an up.
---
Thanks again
---
Yes it's a good effect, but not one I'd expect from a lackey, just like how Titanic Watcher is the weakest overall lackey, this eff although can be strong,  doesn't feel lackey oriented. Most dragons are heavy, as so this is mostly a late game card , while most lackey effect are very good Early to mid
---
 game
---
I think the first one I played when I was around 15 hp so that’s probably why mine was a tad smaller
---
Well i have played since 2014 and I havnt been playing so much lately since i have gotten a jobb. I dont have as much time to play games.
---
They can be really big if you're playing patchwerk
---
My personal main problem is what this means for the next expansions? Is blizzard gonna release a weak af expansion to stop powercreep or are they gonna keep powercreeping? Both will lead to frustration in the fanbase...
---
But *maaaybe* they are baiting us all right now with these powerful cards to sell more prepurchases but they secretly got the nerfs ready. *tinfoil hat intensifies*
---
most insane card since the new wild growth wtf
---
I run Nat in burgle rogue, it draws quite a bit since you can defend him
---
Read this: 
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23239989/
---
Did you manage to clear the dungeon?
---
Yeah, Jade rogue with a battle totem or totem of death passives. In combination with wax rager is freaking lit, that did the job for me
---
It's real indeed
---
No, you have to believe him/her/zer/xer on his/her/zer/xer word.
---
Hearthstone playerbase and revenue are dropping, so they print autoinclude legendaries like this to force the remaining players who don't play 20 hours a week to pay more if they want to stay competitive.
---
This card goes into any dragon deck with no thought required.
---
It's been played on and off in Reno Mage, even in Wild. That's the definition of not garbage.
---
When you say you lost 53 points as 4th place, were you the only one dying on that round or were there other players that died at the same time? While it may look like you placed 4th because you had the most health of the players that died, in reality the game considers all players that died on the same round to have achieved the same placement in regards to points gained/lost. So if 3 people died at the same time in position 4, 5 and 6 you'll be losing points instead of gaining any.
---
Yes. I was looking for that comment.
---
F2p btw
---
Why dont you try it in this shaman meta? Oh wait, because it's turn 6 play and games end on turn 4.
---
This is like, the most predictable and basic interaction.
---
Nah because those trash 3 10s shuffle back in for essentially dead draws
---
I think Goldrynn is the weakest choice since you don't have a Hydra.  I would probably go with Hyena myself, but Foe Reaper is also a good choice for popping divine shields.  The only issue with choosing Reaper is that it could die to a cleave before getting to attack because you'll need to place it beside the taunts.
---
I forget about wild sometimes. That will be pretty sweet.
---
Which is honestly ridiculous that they didn't have a big list of all quests to look at so they'd notice something like this.
---
Wow that was fucking amazing. I dare anyone to think of, let alone win with, a more ridiculous build.

Lul picking an rng filled clown fiesta as an official sanction game
---
Plot twist: OP is the top mage.
---
And my ass
---
I mean, I get the theory of it. But a symmetric effect with double-edged sword risks still seems a little too “fair” compared to some of the shenanigans we’re seeing from other classes right now. 
---
Given the proliferation of lategame dragons for all classes, it doesn’t even seem necessarily likely that Paladin will be built stronger for the lategame than the opponent. You could very well be playing into a Highlander build’s Dragonqueen Alex.
---
V.S. has stated that they wouldn't run any new reports until after the new set drops and the event cards go away.
---
Ah yes
---
Yes that ol' sayin
---
Guess when majority says so it has to be done
---
No wonder why a clown is the president of Burgerland now
---
Democracy at its finest. The opinion of everyone Worth the same, from a featherless chicken running around to a veteran, we all are the same :)
---
Bad this is (or used to be) the place to see the cards first since Blizz page is absolute trash that never updates and has already revealed cards as "yet to be revealed"
---
Show me a place to get the new cards first and I LL take my ass of this battlegrounds infested junky heap in a blink of an eye
---
[removed]
---
They confirmed it's this month
---
Be wary - triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall...
---
I’m pretty sure the hsreplay tracker keeps track of what your opponent has the last time you played them but unlike other auto chess games battlegrounds does t let you look at everyone else’s build
---
Ling ling
---
I agree the text is inconsistent and feels needlessly wordy. I like your version much better. 
---
That being said, Hearthstone (or Blizzard in general) isn’t known for being consistent, so I’m not surprised oddities like this exist.
---
Currently it’s the Year of the Dragon. This year, they decided to tell an overarching story with all the expansion releases. In the first set, a bunch of evil characters from previous expansions (Dr. Boom, Madame Lazul from Whispers, Rafaam, Hagatha, and Togwaggle) teamed up as the League of EVIL and attacked and took over the floating magical city of Dalaran. Each of them represented one class, while the other four classes represented the defenders. In the second set, the League took Dalaran to the desert area of Uldum to get something, where they found a formidable foe: The League of Explorers! Reno, Finley, Elise, and Brann returned as Reno-style Legendary minions, one for each of the classes that represented the defenders of Dalaran. The upcoming set, Descent of Dragons, closes out the story, as the League of Evil brings their target for Uldum to the Dragonblight in Northrend: The Plaguelord of Undeath. They use him to revive Galakrond, the ORIGINAL dragon, and the one the five dragon aspects defeated to become the Aspects. 
---
With each expansion, they have released a single player mode that’s a lot like the previous ones, but it has 5 different sections with different twists, new special cards, and special Hero Powers! However, you have to buy them... Although the first chapter has been free the last two times. It’s usually released a month after the expansion releases. It’s also where Bob comes from.
---
Aside from all that, a new mode was introduced: Battlegrounds! It’s in the mode section with Arena. Basically, it’s Hearthstone’s take on Autochess, and it’s not half bad. It’s currently in beta now, and you have to buy the preorder for Descent of Dragons to play it.
---
I don't play mobile. It happens on PC, too. Buying 3 minions, playing 5 including the 2 from hand with multiple battlecries, trying to resell them all plus a few others and then buying the last 2 and playing them all in the span of 40 seconds wouldn't be a problem except at least 30 of those seconds are lost to animations.
---
TOO REAL MY FRIEND!! THE GOLD COMMONS ARE MUCH TO COMMON... :*(
---
I... 
---
I Understood That Reference.
---
You rang?
---
Oh yeah my "entire" reason revolves around new cards right? Not like i dosed my post with way more than just new cards but made emphasis on that since usually that's what is talked the most given people's hype and expectations...
---
Selective view your nitpicking is legendary. Get some proper classes of reading
---
I've earned £38.90 ($50.23) over the past few years. I use it to rent HD films through my Nvidia shield, those films I don't want to buy, so spend a few quid on every now and again.
---
I feel personally attacked by that clip
---
Quick question: why is all your value stacked next to taunts? I understand that your minions are way overstatted, but it's bad positioning and will lead to getting wrecked by cleave in any other game. Isolate taunts next to buffers.
---
Yeah this is good. Few extra bucks answering questions about whatever YouTube video you've watched or what you're considering buying. I've been doing it for a couple years now. $86 worth. Most of my mobile library was funded by the rewards (and before anyone knocks me for saying "mobile library" you can get some classics on Google play, and new shit too; FFTactics and Stardew Valley aren't cheap mobile throwaway cash grabs). All that to say; you can use the rewards for other stuff besides Hearthstone. Good tip.
---
Don't tell the others, but I'm rooting for you
---
Oh hey, you’ve been visiting the same tavern as me.
---
why not both
---
but muh data
---
can't beat the poison and divine shielded big boiks
---
Is this comment sarcastic?
---
This adventure is considered one of the easiest there are. Normal and heroic. 
---
Many people were dissapointed because of how easy it is when it came out.
---
And the chess was the hardest part (only on heroic) because you couldnt use your own deck and you had to hit the right cards while the enemy wasn't.
---
I don't know how Hearthstone code works, obviously, but I'm pretty sure it would be easier to check the # of cards in your hand against your opponents and then have you draw (number of cards in your opponents hand) minus (number of cards in your hand after Divine Favor). 
---
So if you have five cards (including DF), your opponent has 12, after casting DF you'd draw 8.
---
That is completely false, sn1p lock wasnt refined or played much until a few months ago, it was pretty inline with the BS from wild cards going into standard, clearly you dont play wild yourself or you would've known that
---
You lucky bitch! Now you can buff all your murlocs with +2 health! You can even try rerolling and then sell the mama bear to buy something else for the next battle!
---
Awful positioning.
---
1. Move the 2/2 lightfang to the far left in order to break divine shields and make space for rover summons.
---
2. Move an amalgam to the far right to mitigate enemy cleave
---
3. Move the other amalgam in between the two 4/4 lightfangs to mitigate enemy cleave
---
Jokes on you, he only had 2 cards in hand and 0 in deck so fatigue killed him and he never got a turn
---
For free? And to think of the amount of shit we went through on Amazon to get it..
---
I use it in Malygos Hunter.
---
I find that a bit hard to believe given how VS skews their results by intentionally using small sample sizes anyway.
---
This is too strong, should be at least 3 mana.   
---
While you're at it, you can remove the Banana, Coin, card, Armor, 1 attack and  3 health from it, and also give it charge too.
---
Triples of security rover with cobalt are just gonna do fairly well no matter what happens. Tbh I’m not sure this card was a huge bonus.
---
We already know hoe this will work. If your hand and deck are empty and your opponent holds 4 cards, you will draw 4 ticks of fatigue by playing divine favor.
---
No idea. I only play constructed for the dailies and I haven't added the new card.
---
Legendary has way more letters then leggo, easier to type
---
Would your name happen to be Moby?
---
Sounds like a you problem.
---
I thought some of the cards they brought back were pretty interesting. They just didn't exercise great judgment in choosing which. The meta right now would be far more bearable if Nzoth and Evolve had been passed over for something else.
---
I've got over a hundred packs waiting for me. When do I get to bust them shits open?
---
It's a simple concept, you don't need 5 pages for it. If you can't do elementary math, they make a thing called a calculator.
---
Yeah who can forget blizz's shitty free legendaries like vargoth which only saw play in such niche decks as big/res priest, or the terrible sn1p-sn4p which really just fell off the meta?
---
If it were a good card, you wouldn’t be getting it for free.
---
We literally got two of the last expansions best legendaries for free in Sn1p-Sn4p and Vargoth lmao
---
