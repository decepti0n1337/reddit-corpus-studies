It's a pretty genius build. I've been playing Mecha'thun Warlock ever since it was introduced, first with pure controllock+demon build and later with Hemet. I think your build is the fastest and most consistent build I've played. Thanks for the innovative deck, if it weren't for that deck, I would just play Battlegrounds.

---
But you still get normal cards instead of golden onces.
---
Does it still have a yellow border before played, even though it won't trigger?
---
I didn't call him trash bud. I just stated that he's rank 8 and he's trash talking a player which is a higher rank than him. I just don't think players that can't get rank 5 (which can be achieved with a below 50% wr) should be making statements about another player's ability.

He made this profile because he was suspended twice in the last couple months. He keeps making new accounts to harass the devs at every turn. This thread is basically an encore of [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/drqvh8/hearthstone_battlegrounds_card_hero_library/f6l7dmn/?context=1).

Very helpful! Always nice to have new decks to try out.

That looks like a victory - I hope you at least took that early amalgam-heavy comp to Top 3!

Holy shit, a Battlegrounds video that I actually enjoyed watching? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?!
---
It's less the big stuff that worries me and more the powerful staple cards. Especially the Explorers seem powerful in any value deck their classes might ever play.
---
This is basically a maexna, it wouldnt break anything
---
What would it do? There's obviously no way to double its effect.
---
After a certain point the amount of attack is irrelevant. Scaled nightmare reaches that point after 5-6 turns, whereas micromachine takes 40+ turns.
---
Although scaled nightmare scales exponentially, which can't really be compared to micro machine, I don't think it would be an unfair card.
---
I hope they do rotate festeroot out regardless. He just seems so worthless; at least bolvar is interesting.

But if they have kadgar and the beast you get two finkles

While I don't have details I can share, the Hearthstone QA team has been asking for details on the [Bug Report forums](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/hearthstone/t/can-t-unlock-daloran-heist-v/17904/2).
---
not sure, but it should do *something*, all combinations should have a notable bonus
---
No, not really. It is a way to know it isn't a prescribed order, but you can't really verify "random". After all, there is no such thing as "true random" as far as computers go. Just saying. üòã
---
I'm curious as to what makes this clickbait.  Clickbait is generally defined as something immediately eye catching with questions, "Do you own a car?  Then xxx" exclamations, "Doctors hate him!" or promising more details such as "You'll never believe xxx" or warnings such as "xxx isn't as safe as you think."
---
Saying "I've written a weekly article on outof.cards about beating meta decks" is not very clickbaity, and the article is about exactly what the title is.
---
If you're salty over "Would love for you to check it out" then I think your misgivings are misplaced.
---
Not all triples get extras aside from stats buffs. See the 1/1 taunt+divine shield, the 2/4 mech taunt+divine shield, the 6/3 mech divine shield, etc.   
---
   
---
Unless you're suggesting those minions should get an effect boost when tripled?
---
Fair enough! I really like the presentation of the table. Very clean and super useful.
---
I had three in my hand but they did not merge. 
---
Not sure what would happen if you somehow bought three of them in one turn. Maybe a 2/2 that transforms into another card at the start of your next turn.
---
I am not going to talk about the best decks and the best formats, to each their own. My only advice is: play for fun, not for winning. Do not play a deck you hate because it gives you +5% winrate in comparison to the the deck you like.
---
I wanted to shoutout Bebe872 for reaching  top 5 in Asia despite only playing for about a week and only picking between two heroes. Bebe is primarily a Dota Underlords streamer but started playing Battlegrounds 6 days ago and has steadily climbed up the MMR ladder. He's been grinding away with 12-16 hour days learning the game from scratch and has made incredible progress. And like I said above he didn't pre-order the expansion so he only picks between two heroes to start. 
---
I've been following his journey the whole time and have been blown away by how quickly he has reached this level. You watch his first stream from 6 days ago and he barely knows the cards and makes the same newbie mistakes that anyone else would. And now I would consider him one of the best in the world. He says his goal is to reach #1 on the Asia server which is still a tall order because he's still 800 MMR away. But I believe that he can do it.

Sure, that makes sense.  With a lot of token deathrattles it can feel very hard to get good value when they're making multiple every death.
---
What's the deal with replicating menace, though?  Surely that should make 2/2s?

I used Togwaggle's Scheme to shuffle 10+ Obsidian Destroyers into my deck. Later in the game I used my second Scheme to shuffle in multiple copies of N'Zoth. That Priest didn't stand a chance!

You need more RAM

Are those pogos too?
---
I started f2p back before Whispers of the Old Gods came out and even though I did move to pre-orders and such, I had such a blast saving up for the adventures with the daily quests even though it took forever. Game's different now in a lot of ways but if you play for a while longer and don't put money into it before deciding "Maybe this just isn't for me", then all you're losing is some of your free time.

Hydra. Divine shield poisonous minions are the counter to big stats. Cleaves are the counter to divine shields.
---
Standard (and maybe Wild) sucks right now but Battlegrounds are fun.
---
Thanks, after I saw your comment I did more reading on the battlegrounds and learned a lot. I haven't hardly touched any battlegrounds social media since the day it came out. I've probably got 30-40 games under my belt so all I've learned is what I've seen. The menagerie build hasn't seemed super popular in the upper 4000 ranks that I've slowly been creeping upwards on.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúattraction of the hero‚Äù when I‚Äôm not the one playing as her. If everyone took that damage, it‚Äôd be fine, but as it is now, two people are randomly selected to take massive damage because of something they had no control over.
---
You‚Äôre right, she‚Äôs a bit behind and took a bit of damage, but I couldn‚Äôt care less about that when I‚Äôm not her. What I DO care about is that I took 10 damage, and have 1 turn less until my death.

I'm shocked that it's not the Bartender that greets you in the beginning

It‚Äôs not completely unavoidable? Name one way to beat siegebreaker and imp gang boss on turn 3 with any other hero, then.

Another thing, at one point the game showed I was up against a ghost when there were 4 players left and the game bugged out. Didn't even get rank for the game (sad, especially since I was way ahead of the other three at that point).

Assuming the absolute best outcome, you're sacrificing 3-4 rounds (probably 10ish HP) for a 2/6 and ideally Siegebreaker. Which... is still not that good, and is *far* from guaranteed.
---
And even in this best outcome, are you really planning on keeping a 2/6 for late game? It has *no* other effects or uses, aside from being an expensive and weak body.
---
*Maybe* Sindragosa can get away with this... but I wouldn't hold my breath.

It didn't. I only had to deal with Anub and six-million corrupted bloods every turn. [Persistence is key!](https://imgur.com/6lgAceB)

Oh fuck off with the condescension. I‚Äôve played games of all varieties for the last 20 years; card games, board games, miniature games, role playing games, etc. 
---
There is an acceptable level of randomness in games that keep them fun and exciting. The Hearthstone design team have gone way beyond that. The randomness in games should create moments in which players can react accordingly and strategically with some level of degree on what to expect. Thief rogue and evolution type mechanics are completely random bullshit that does not promote a healthy play pattern that is fun and engaging for all players. I‚Äôm going to play other games instead that understand this idea.
---
swamp man good?
---
Inb4 they add spells to battlegrounds like inner fire.
---
Isn‚Äôt it actually the other way round? Hearthstone takes you to your selected Home in WoW
---
That's fortunate. Six million corrupted bloods is less fortunate. But good on you for winning! :)
---
Wow tier 3 and 4 neutrals are terrible. They should consider replacing  some of those.
---
he saying if you get 3 shifter zerus untranformed and they make a golden all the things golden zerus becomes are golden versions
---
So you had a golden zerus, which transformed into a golden cobalt? Which combined with two normal cobalts to make a triple (which shouldn‚Äôt happen as the zerus one was already a triple)?
---
More than 50% of winning comps are actually menagerie builds with lightfang and/or brann, because these scale the best into late game.

Yeah, during more complex turns it can easily give you extra 15-20 seconds of turn timer, at that's MASSIVE. And exactly the problem I've mentioned. It would probably have to be "everyone or no one", but you can't force everyone to play without animations... or those who decide to play with them should still be compensated with some extra turn time, but that would be hard to calculate fairly.
---
They can't resist that spicey pretzel mustard.
---
I don't think you will be stronger than the rest at that point. You will have a 2/6 and a random top tier card vs full boards. And you definitely will be the weakest player for the turns you are freezing and upgrading.
---
You're getting downvoted because you're incorrect. I've done it many times.

Disgusting? This is fair compared to some of the menagerie runs I‚Äôve done. The only things that can get ridiculous on your board are the amalgams.

The only thing that could possibly make it better is if you froze it and got the Murloc buff next turn.

I mean, I guess, but there's tons of other "repetitive" stuff constantly going on in BG in terms of sounds and animations, so it just struck me as curious the granny got singled out.
---
The current model more easily fits the budgets of the most people. Right now, you can basically spend as much as you want on the game, from zero to infinity, as often as you want. 
---
With you're proposed model, the minimum to spend is $180/year, more than buying the fifty dollar pre-order for each set, and there is a pretty clear ceiling of twice that.
---
For everyone involved, the current business model that governs Hearthstone is better for most players.
---
I'm with you. Bringing back the legacy was probably the dumbest and most easily avoided mistake the devs have ever made when it came to balancing...  
---
...Sure the meta changed again, which is one more time than without adding the legacy cards... but it changed for the worst
---
Small note, there's actually a space between "Nether" and "Breath." It's not suppose to be one word, as shown on the [official card](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/54892-nether-breath).

Not really. Attack doesn't matter remotely as much as health does, Bolvar isn't even comparable to Junkbot and Hyena. Junkbot and Hyena are good because they both scale up in hp (Junkbot much more than Hyena) and they can get tribe buffs. Bolvars just bad, maybe decent mid game with a triple but that's too much investment for a strat that won't win.
---
It is, should have pointed that out. I refer more to keeping Blink Fox on the coin.
---
You are still talking about late game power plays, not a turn 4 RNG fiesta, average 10/10 stats across 3 bodies, sometimes far greater than 10/10 and often followed by bloodlust. Makes old secret hunter  pre-nerf spellstone look shite.

Crowd Favorite better than just 'early'. He's the one of the only (If not literally the only) non-tribe minion that synergize with tribe buffs.

Yeah no thanks. This is a collectible card game. Part of the gameplay is collecting cards and customizing your decks. If everyone had every card there would be a whole lot of individuality that would be lost in the process. Also there would be no broader sense of accomplishment other than winning your next match.

Elek shuffles an extra copy 'into' your deck. It doesn't affect how many are summoned at once when drawn. The only way for two Waxadred's to be summoned at once are after you shuffled them in with elek. It then becomes luck of the draw for Double Wax.

Maybe it was intentional because it forces you to pick a tribe or something

Waxadread rogue gunna force more dispel into the meta

TIL MCT actually says that, i always thought the card says "Engaging TC-130 into this locator"
---
That's what I meant, bad wording.
---
It's not really 4 mana though. It's doubtful you'll be able to hold onto your backstab long enough to play it with this card.
---
Even comboing it with lackeys is pretty clunky as three of them will be dead cards if you play them out before this card.
---
Well right now the only thing I buy is the solo adventures, so I would much rather keep the current model. Also I am quite content with what cards I have, being able to slowly build up and upgrade your decks is one of the things I like the most about this game, just instantly getting all cards would ruin that. And also, do you really need every single card? Do you really need all of the decks? Isn't a few different decks enough?
---
The same percent as your battery.
---
~3300. I‚Äôve never really seen Akazamzarak players utilising his Secrets to their full effect. The only one I‚Äôve found who placed high conceded when I popped his Ice Block, and he was just running the Mech package.
---
whelps and the legendary that shuffles a resummon back into the deck and you're good. maybe a couple more if there end up being any half decent new rattles.
---
What the picture of the fake apex goods that I found shockingly bad? Did you think I bought them? 
---
Do you get exited when you reach 69 kills too? Grow up kid
---
&gt;And also, do you really need every single card? Do you really need all of the decks? Isn't a few different decks enough?
---
Well, buying a 30$/month sub would be optional. You have other sub tiers if you want to spend and have less.
---
Probably 1 copy would be enough, but I think it's pretty strong if you get him with the new card. Also you can cheat him out with Anka as well. Sn1p Sn4p would be a low roll actually. Bloodhoof seems good, not sure about the crawler tho as it doesn't really add much value.
---
I‚Äôm proud to say that I did find one eventually.
---
When you get to Megasaur you will already have both poisonous and divine shield on your amalgams.

He pointed out the explorer dragons. I don't think those will actually see that much play outside of dragon decks who need more dragons. He also specified all value decks. Which confused me since he said overpowered and OP before that and value decks are almost never that. Hearthstone being a tempo game and all.
---
Rat King too.
---
Pretty much a strctly better kobold illusionist for wild big rogue.
---
Lackey-Selfharm-Dragon Zoolock let's goooooo
---
The way I envision this is just a Tempo Rogue with the aforementioned package. I think the legend is too slow. I'd rather just want stats immediately and beat up my opponent. Those are generally the kind of decks that see success past the first two weeks of the expansion.
---
I don't think your idea is bad, but it would be a very different style of Rogue.
---
Makes sense. I'm sure they die, horribly.
---
I don‚Äôt think bringing back the legacy cards was a bad decision. It was an experiment and most of it went fine except for 1 card.
---
The bad thing was that they just didn‚Äôt fucking do anything once it became clear that Evolve was a mess. Experiments are fine but once they go wrong you‚Äôre not supposed to just sit there and go ‚Äûoh well there‚Äôs nothing we can do now‚Äú, you‚Äôre supposed to fix the mistake and learn from it.
---
Blizzard might never do anything like this again which fucking sucks, I liked the concept and I liked cards like Kun, Thaurissan and Ragnaros being back but because of their unwillingness to put any, *any* effort into changing things when they‚Äôre obviously very bad for the game this has been a terrible experience.

At first I was like "oh well, looks pretty boring and bland, I guess its common filler card". But after a bit of thought, it really looks strong. I didnt realice this is a healbot, but dragon instead of robot, and with waaay better stats. And healbot was great (also because it was neutral) but paladins have both healing synergies and dragon synergies.
---
Not a flashy card, but pretty solid.
---
Anyfin paladin ran it occasionally
---
I'm not sure I'd really call that control paladin - more a midrange deck with an absurd heal package to counter freeze mage.
---
The current metta has literally stopped me from logging in and playing. It is so terrible.  I‚Äôm on the brink of just not even wanting to play again. :/
---
How to cut of future Warlock dragon design space 101.
---

Not just a 4/6. It's also a dragon.

---
I am so excited! I have my final exam this semester the same day as the new expansion comes out!! Literal perfect timing
---
Whether we want it or not..
---
&gt;Mega Kill
---
Seems like a solid card. Might just go into dragon paladin to have more activators.
---
Pretty good untill you reach legend. Then its all snip snap warlock and that sucks because its not really a "balanced deck" right now.
---
Fortunately people at non-legend ranks dont/cant play snip snap properly and therefore you see many other decks, from memes to serious, but nothing way too strong appart from secret mage, but that deck is not at the level of annoying as snip snap anyway, and can be somewhat teched against.
---
what?
---
you thought this was a filler? its super strong.. even at first glance its insane
---
Hummm. Don't focus on just one class (meaning disenchant other classes stuff)! 
---
If you happen to like the other classes later, you gonna regret it :)
---
Thank you. You got the balls.
---
Draw a deathrattle minion from your deck
---
Combo: gain its deathrattle. 
---
That would be soooo strong to immediately get the draw effect AND have a deathrattle effect. 
---
I agree this is such an awkward combo card.  Vilespine at 5 was good because it is immediate removal, and you're running firefly and cheaper cards in your deck.  So most times it will be awkward to combo, but if you can coin this out on 3 it seems ridiculous.
---
No offence but this really isn‚Äôt that filthy. If you offered me the choice between fighting a shaman that starts with the deal 2 hp, or a shaman that will 100% hit a turn 4 evolve on hare. I would take the deal 2 every time. Yes this is a vaguely cool thing you pulled off but it‚Äôs really not a filthy play.
---
Also, antique healbot couldn‚Äôt heal minions. This can.
---
Healbot was amazing for being neutral and granting healing to classes that really need it like Warlock and Rogue. IIRC, paladin never ran it.
---
This card is really really good, but as a neutral it would be possibly one of the best card in the game.
---
No it's not fair.
---
This isn't true, if you win the practice game you have a win and a top 4.
---
No AF Kay is bad because she gives the first two players a free win which is unfair to others, and then she almost always destroys somebody turn 3 and turn 4. Other characters who have strong early starts like Yogg or Millificient are at least playing the same game you are, but AF Kay doesn't do the start the same and in the 8 she's just a polarizing luck of the draw.
---
Class cards are allowed to be stronger than neutral ones.
---
Plus, Healbot is a card about as old as Hearthstone itself at this point, and it's easier for Team 5 to design relatively simple cards while knowing they won't break anything now than it was then.
---
This is one power creep I'm 100% fine with. A stupid strong heal in Paladin or Priest doesn't bother me much at all. It's not this is a Mage Dragon 4/6 that casts Cinderstorm. This is a Paladin Dragon 4/6 that casts Healing Touch. It's a lot weaker than something more aggressive.
---
This seems like a decent arena card. 5-mana 4/6 is propoer, but heal or dragon mechanics don't have great synergies like in standard. But definitely topples over a few arena cards, like \[\[Streetwise Investigator\]\].

---
Rogue doesn't even have any good class deathrattles.
---
Looking at the history of HS, you've misunderstood him. He really wants broken stuff in the game.
---
Remember jade druid? When he was interviewed about it, he bragged that everyone told him not to put jade idol into the game, but he took that as a challenge and did anyway.
---
The power creep is unreal
---
Because the game as a whole is stronger now. Darkshire Alchemist would not see play today.
---
I know they are good characters but I want something different and J only mentioned Darryp because that is what the post was about
---
Thanks for the explanation! I‚Äôve just been getting back into HS for the first time since Blackrock Mountain
---
Mm not if you don't pre-order, which is most people
---
I always thought GoK should‚Äôve also gotten Taunt and Divine Shield. It would just make so much more sense and would be quite the good control card.
---
I remember thinking the firebat in starcraft said ‚Äúvetoized‚Äù instead of ‚Äúneed a light?‚Äù 
---
I don‚Äôt even know what vetoized would mean
---
Hey, don't let people tell you not to let people put you down, if you want to let people put you down then I'm telling you to tell people to let you tell people to put you down.

Heh did he hit you with the 24 first?
---
Just delayed - I got the info when I was sick and then went straight to the battlegrounds event and was away for the weekend so I didn‚Äôt have a good time to actually make the video. Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôll happen :)
---
My guess is this is building to an infinite Waxadred combo of some sort. Just pump your deck full of candles.
---
It was playable towards end of vanilla. It did well into midrange shaman and smorc hunter and midrange druid. Consecrate was premium removal and Truesilver was one of the few things that could deal with druid tempo.
---
Guardian was used to counter smorc hunter as well since pala was only one with that much healing with holy light + truseilver + guardian
---
Patchwerk is really good though.
---
All the time. Have you seen a Mill/Nzoth Rogue without any deathrattles to revive. So satisfying to see them play an empty Nzoth and then shame concede.
---
The SI-7 Agent is undercover.
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs not _playing_ optimally. It‚Äôs _choosing the hero_ optimally.
---
I know he is my favorite character but their are like 40 and I want different ones
---
So the cards from packs per month lock after you unsub, same for the whole collection when you get the 30 a month?
---
I like the idea of the Charge minion going first. This seams like the obvious choice. No worries, there should be many patches in the future and this change should come.
---
Okay. Thank you.
---
Yeah, Blizzard updated their Reveal order at some point AFTER we had made our initial reveal timers. We had to adjust the timers and placement of some of them, but the good news is that they should all be correct again :)
---
Is it a good card?
---
Same omg, I play all 9 classes and I like all of them because they‚Äôre unique and fun in their own ways. They each have their own ‚Äòflavour‚Äô too which is why it‚Äôs hard for me to main a class (and even harder to ignore one class completely)
---
So if hero win rates were balanced by buff/nerfs, do you think there is a point where it doesn't matter if you have 2 or 3 picks?
---
I said this tool wasn't too bad unless we see a pile-on of other over-value,under-costed defensive tools added to Paladin. If Warrior got a dragon that gave them 8 armor at an under-cost, we'd be seeing more oppression but Paladin doesn't have the same defensive toolkit and this isn't that bad.
---
You're right, Warrior basically had a perfect storm of under-costed defensive tools with an infinity value generator in Boom-MG... Boom-MG should have been nerfed when the other DKs rotated, but Blizzard doesn't really care about Hearthstone's overall meta health so we will see what shakes up in this card set.
---
Why is priest the third weakest healing class?
---
You‚Äôre right, I guess it was bugged when I did it. Thanks for the correction!
---
Thank you very much for the update!
---
Ok thank you!
---
Kripp ? Is that you ??
---
^such as odd rogue, even shaman, mech handbully pally
---
Gallick#1507, NA, 80G quest
---
Hmm, not exciting to me unless Hunter gets more aoe stuff.  
---
Sure it clears the board with Hounds, but every other class has better board clears that aren't 9 mana and *two cards*.  
---
And I guess if you already have Desert Spear equipped it's a nice enough double-removal.  
---
Maybe they're trying for a more spell-heavy Malygos Dragon Hunter deck with stuff like that Twinspell and Arcane Shot?
---
You don't have to. Nobody addresses anybody else on here with their titles. They are jokes and for good fun. Kibler is good enough.
---
I was scrolling through the card database searching for dragons I could include in wild decks. Then I came across this... Go see for yourself.
---
 https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/cards/

Then filter by "All Cards", and "Dragons". Scroll down to six drops and there he is!

"powercreep" is just a word this subreddit uses to describe powerful cards, think nothing more of it than that

6/-/- | Choose One - Summon a 6/6 Ancient with Taunt; or Restore 12 Health.  
---
Yeah. I always thought playing the combo out on turn five was good. Delaying the combo by incorporating a six mana card can only make it better.
---
You quite clearly don't play the deck or know how it works.
---
Deadly combo at Turn 8 with Explosive Trap or at Turn 9 with Unleash the Hounds. Or at Turn 7 with Swarm of Locusts, provided the enemy doesn't buff the health of one/some minions back (e.g. Paladin with the +2hp secret)

It's a neat card, though I'm pretty disappointed with the flavour of hunter's cards so far this set.
---
The devestations are:
---
Summon an 8/8 taunt.
---
Deal 5 damage to all other minions.
---
Give your minions +2/+2.
---
Deal 5 damage to the enemy hero, heal your hero for 5.

The best part? You get to choose which one to pick.

Yeah, but the only thing that matters now is that they sell enough packs.
---
And for that it needs to be more powerful than existing expansions.
---
That would be so busted at 7 mana; see \[\[Sunwalker\]\]
---
Of course. It they are all completely fair, or close to being fair, there wouldn‚Äôt be a significant difference.

6/4/5 | Taunt Divine Shield  
---
I'm not saying it's going to make the deck. I'm saying that it's another card that can be teched in **if** there is a prominent counter to it. Nothing positive will come out of this card.
---
Micro Machine reprint, slightly altered effect this time
---
As the other guy mentionned, mech and beast will never have access to poisonous, and murlocs will never have access to sweep, because sweep + poisonous would dominate the meta entirely. Demon will also never have access to anything, otherwise they wouldn't suck.
---
Neat.  Thanks!  Now I know what to do with that spare second in the Tavern.  ;-)
---
I feel like they could make a deck with this in wild.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm probably overreacting since cooper tail doesn‚Äôt see play in the deck, but at the moment looked too broken, I admit that I should have waited before commenting, I really hope as you guys say this won‚Äôt see play there
---
There is already a cheaper stealth mech?
---
It does exist as a 2 mana cheaper card. If coppertail imposter sees no play, why would this?
---
A Galakrond tutor that also has a bunch of amazing battlecry effects otherwise. Yeah this is a must have if you intend to have a Galakrond deck
---
Holy crap. We were already theorizing decent Galkrond decks with just the current set of known cards. This freakin' beastly card might be even more of a swing turn than Galk himself!!!  
---
Side-note, this gives me hope we might see a new neutral singelton-synergy card or a sidequest-synergy card.  
---
The sidequests especially seem a little lackluster thus far so a neutral "play a sidequest from your deck" minion might be necessary to see them work out.
---
There already exists a 4 cost minion which essentially does the same thing.
---
This set reminds me of MSoG in terms of power level so far, that is not good. Prepare for 16 months of whatever comes out on top of this meta, it will surely been Uber-strong.

Yeah. \[\[Coppertail Imposter\]\]

4/4/4 Mech | Battlecry: Gain Stealth until your next turn.  
---
Hey look, it's the [[Twin Emperor Vek'lor]] of this set. You know, the basically mandatory legendary that goes with the free deck-defining legendary.
---
if a 4 cost stealth mech sees no play, not sure why a 6 cost give another mech stealth would see play.
---
Hm, maybe. Based on the Galakron HP, I'm thinking Priest is gonna be very spell heavy, and rely on random Priest minions as its means to push its opponents into fatigue. Turning Kronx into another boardclear might be worth it, then.
---
You realize Coppertail Imposter already exists, right?
---
That curves into the SN1P-SN4P combo and doesn't feature in the deck. I doubt there's anything to worry about.

---
8/15/4442
---
Yeah I'm not seeing the mass appeal here some people have. Hunter is not a control deck.
---
Very fair 
---
7 mana this and mecharoo is better but more expensive and two cards 
---
Basically more of a win more card then
---
Is this the only Mech synergy card surviving the next rotation?
---
I'd say hero matters more as you go up in rank. The distribution of good and bad heroes of course changes, but a skilled player being able to use the advantage of a hero only amplifies the effect of having a better hero. Some heroes are just bad. E.g. you're never gonna get a lot out of Pyramad's hero power. As you go up, people will only press that button less.
---
I think it could've been a consideration even without the tutor effect or without the conditional Galakrond effect. Having both is really good, means it's very rarely a dead draw.
---
Utterly broken, t1 coin double sidequest double snowflippers won the game?!
---
Good
---
Would it, considering that Sunwalker is also completely unviable in standard?
---
Desert Spear kills off 2 right away.
---
Don't know about you but I like having an actual board clear in rogue.
---
Good point, I forgot it existed. Guess the card really does not matter at all.
---
This one was on their own youtube,  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zpHQ92zho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zpHQ92zho)
---
That's still just one minion with stealth, not potentially half-a dozen.
---
Even then, you're still right. If Coppertail Imposter isn't good enough for the deck, neither is this.
---
I'm a little bot...
---
The second point was more what I was thinking but yeah, you‚Äôre likely right. As I said to someone else in here with you‚Äôre same point, very niche situation or win more card
---
And the worst offenders from kobolds were busted due to strong synergy. These cards are just busted by themselves. When I thought the team was finally starting to learn about long-term balance, they drop this ridiculous set. Guess they really needed to sell some packs this time around. Can't wait to have standard ruined again until DoD rotates.
---
This + dragons = madness. But in a fun way.

Let me know what you think
---
when all the cards have been revealed, I'll be happy to let you own me with all the 1- and 2-drop dragons blizzard decided to print, and then a month or so into the expac you can do it again when it's been confirmed that dragon zoo is a deck anyone plays
---
Finley has to be an acknowledgement that Deryl is busted. Deryl is better in nearly every way. Twice as many buffs per sale. Sales net you a coin instead of breaking even, it‚Äôs even easier to control Deryl‚Äôs hero power. Finley‚Äôs hero power can be used without selling a minion though, so he has that at least...
---
If by diluting expansions you mean printing one of the best neutral one drops then sure.
---
Valeera the hollow has the most underrated bm voice lines. My favourite is oops which is ‚Äúoh how tragic‚Äù
---
This. Is. CRAZY! Battlecry: Draw your win condition and if you have already played it, get an extemly powerful effect. One part of me is already thinking this in rogue + togwaggles scheme + maybea shadowstep or 2
---
I don't think it's accurate to say basic cards are intended to be weaker - every class has multiple basic cards that are staples. And many of the weaker basic class cards are only weak because they used to be too strong and got nerfed. It's really only the basic neutral minions that are seem like they're clearly intended to be outclassed by newer cards. And even here there is still a couple cheaper minions strong enough to see niche usage.
---
The most likely answer is that Blizzard never intended Guardian of Kings to be so weak, but due to balancing philosophy never bothered to consider buffing it. Because why buff an unusable basic card when you could release a new and improved version to help sell packs?
---
I dont know, this doesnt need a 7 minion board clear to be valuable. Like yeah theres a toj of potential value to be had if you combo with UTH, but even being able to trade a small minion or two for a big minion or two of your opponents is still really valuable. Plus you get to keep a 7/6 on the board as a result. Seems good
---
I would often death/forbidden words my sylv to get my opponents sylv so they can't have theirs for nzoth
---
Nonsense! It looks like at least 3 clouds to me.
---
apparently
---
This card will be broken in zoo decks. Sticky minions that trade early? Who doesn't want that?
---
The way hearthstone is played right now this card just looks bad.
---
But this doesnt need to be a board clear to produce value. If youre holding on to this card for half the game waiting for the highest value combo play, you're probably misplaying it.
---
This is my favourite art in a while.
---
You don't need that many dragons in the first place lol. With the new 5/5 dragon, some sort of dragonlock will see play.
---
Well... as snappe06 here said, read the title of the post:)

---
I heard "Engaging TC-1-30 mental disco hater"...
---

---
Wait. People are overlooking this hard. If you go first and they don't have an answer it's an auto win card for some decks.
---
This plus zeph is a cool combo

Alright how about this: Espionage, Sprint, Sprint, Apprentice x4, Antonidas, Exodia
---
One destroyed class identity giving Druid a strength it was never meant to have. The other was a staple card that was occasionally played in mid-range/control decks.
---
What??? It's much worse than Crowd Favorite at tier 3 (Battlecries are generally better and easier to spam since you can buy and sell them to buff your Crowd Favorite a lot). Should be tier 2 at most, and I don't even think it would be unfair at tier 1 compared to something like Wrath Weaver.

---
I've read this 4 times and I still can't tell what you were trying to say
---
\&gt; describing it as a six mana card in this context is a tad misleading when the entire point of the combo is to reduce mana costs.
---
OK, I'll say it differently.
---
If you're paying 4 mana for a summoning portal so you can pay 1 mana for a mechwarper so you can pay 3 mana for this card so you can protect your mechwarper so you can have your summoning portal killed off so that next turn you can combo SN1P with your other summoning portal that you have...
---
Play a different deck.
---
This card in no way, shape, or form is good for SN1P. 2 summoning, 2 mechwarper, and glinda are all bricks on the draw. There's hardly any playable minions. You also draw removal spells.
---
The chance of bricking with SN1P is the entire reason why it fills the rest of the deck with draw. There isn't even room for doomsayer. I almost want to cut the magnetic taunt.
---
Am I cutting that amazing minion for a giant clunky stupid looking balloon that doesn't contribute to my gameplan in any meaningful way?
---
Fuck no.
---
Am I cutting any other card in the list for a 6 mana 6/6 with almost 0 impact?
---
No. No I am not.
---
(Not shitting on you, just completely amazed at Reddit not recognizing pack filler and went off. Your post was good.)
---
(Also I get what you're saying. It's not really a 6 mana card. But it's still dogshit.)
---
The end of this expansion is supposed to be a bit annoying so that the next one looks much better.
---
*I'm already Shadowreaper.*

It was called "Giants Paladin", if we're talking about the same deck, from the late beta. Basically giants plus all the value cards from Paladin and Neutral.

I think magnetic is actually the game breaking component of this. It allows you to infinitely scale (within the time limit) instead of just playing it until your board is full.

Based on what we've seen, the Primordial Explorer as well as the other representations of Proto-Drakes for Hunter in Descent of Dragons, we're lead to believe that, yeah, the Hunters are going with Proto-Drakes. Which is most befitting, actually. Proto-Drakes are the primordial form of the dragons, and Galakrond is a Proto-Drake himself.
---
When Galakrond's gluttony led to him consuming his own Proto-Drake kin, the creature was able to grow to an obscenely immense size, and due to the act of cannibalism, began to reek of literal necromantic energies that would reanimate the remains of his prey. These Bone Proto-Drakes would be subservient to the great leviathan's will, and Galakrond's hunger threatened to consume all life on Azeroth.
---
The Proto-Drakes are unsophisticated, primal, and ferocious, which is a good representation of the Hunter identity. But what relation do they have to Dragons?
---
Well, Galakrond is the progenitor of dragonkind despite being a Proto-Drake, and not because he actually made them. Rather, he was the trigger for their creation. Fun fact: Alexstrasza, Neltharion (later Deathwing), Malygos, Nozdormu, and Ysera (who is Alexstrasza's sister) were all once Proto-Drakes. It was when they proved themselves to the Titan Keepers by combining their forces to defeat Galakrond that the Keepers considered beseeching the Titans to bestow a boon unto these Proto-Drakes.
---
For what it's worth, the Prime Designate of the Azerothian Titan-Forged, Odyn, was against it. He believed only the Titans' direct creations were worthy of being the stewards of the World-Soul. The later corruption of Neltharion and need for the Dragons to consume all their power to overthrow the Aspect of Earth (who became the 'Aspect of Death', as it were) would prove Odyn correct later on, but without the benefit of hindsight the Titan Keepers carried forward with their plans despite Odyn's objections. Fun fact: this is what made Odyn say "[Screw you guys, I'm going home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDWgs2cnga0)" and request that Helya (then a skilled Titan-forged sorceress and *not* yet the first of the Val'kyr) raise a segment of Ulduar up to be the Halls of Valour.
---
And that's how you got the Dragon Aspects. Alexstrasza the Aspect of Life, Ysera of the [Emerald] Dream, Nozdormu of Time, Neltharion of Earth, and Malygos of Magic.
---
They would also bless several Proto-Drake eggs to become draconic so that the Dragon Aspects would not be alone in their vigil, and would have intelligent companions (and consorts) with which to work with.
---
A side-note that I'm not sure if it has continued lore relevance is that Galakrond's "progenitor of dragonkind" reputation is acknowledged in-universe in a *literal* sense. The Dragon Aspects encouraged the rumour that Galakrond actually did create them, so as to keep the truth about the gargantuan monster a secret and prevent others from being enticed to travelling the same dark path. However how widespread this rumour is and how much it is regarded as the truth is unknown.
---
The bottom line being that Proto-Drakes still exist in-universe and are draconic in nature, being the predecessors of the intelligent and titan-empowered Dragons and their respective flights.
---
I miss control warrior
---
It saw experimenting. The last I remember of Vanillastone was Ragnaros, Sylvanas, Tirion, old Argent Commander for cards over 6 mana that were playable. Also Unleash the Hounds windfury OTK, Force of Nature Savage Roar, and 4 mana Leeroy shadowstep was in at the time so people removed the card for taunts everytime. That's not even mentioning that the next expansions had Antique Healbot and Sludge Belcher which completely moved this card to antiquity.
---
I'll be Kronx!
---
NERF KRONX!!!
---
I think I actually forgot how to play normal hearthstone now. Haven‚Äôt touched it since battlegrounds lmao.
---
Could there be a possible worse name for this card?
---
It is too strong for it's tier.  It's an oppressive early game card that is showing up more with junk bot banished to tier 5 taverns.  I have had games where I really shouldn't have top 4 because it carried me. I have also had games where my opponent gets 5 divine shield procs on 1 guardian.
---
I mean you could run the 1 damage twinspell or explosive trap i guess
---
Got really dizzy shen i played for 2 games. please take this to higher instance, we all want to play a fanrastic mode.
---
Amber left you cuz you only cared about your job
---
You have to be Galakrond for that part of the battlecry to trigger.
---
Brann and battlecries tend to be inherently synergistic through being mostly buffs.
---
This along with speeding up animation times would be perfect.
---
Well, realistically, the 15 gold you spend here on zerus(es?) means you cant tech up quickly to 5 without gimping your board, hard.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt this be a Paladin card?
---
What is this game your are playing? Is it HearthStone?
---
I've been there more time than I care to admit. Good tips
---
Ye
---
Still a good card though
---
Sorry, I'm still clouded by a meta filled with decks that hinge around a Legendary that, if you don't have, the deck doesn't function. Life's tough for free to plays, I guess.
---
I SWEAR TO GOD, I‚ÄôM GONNA DO IT
---
HOW IS EVERYONE FORGETTING ABOUT THE WAVECLEAR THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU ANYWAYS???
---
Giving something stealth is not good if it's a weenie. You cannot play this with other minions that are big. Everything that would be stealthed dies to lightning storm.
---
You are still weak to the exact same things while winning the matchups you would have won anyways. The only difference is you waited until they have mana for blizzard and flamestrike. Don't forget that you're now weak to MCT, which is not the case with coppertail.
---
And it's COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE otherwise. It's a total clunker with no upside other than stealthing your mechs. Playing this outside of the combo (which is a bad combo) is also bad. It's between a usual case of bad and a niche case of also bad.
---
Everything is relative. in SN1P SN4P, would you want this, or a 4 mana 2/4 that draws you a card? Or Another copy of a mech you already run? Or even a piloted shredder?
---
One is an unplayable abomination, the others are also bad cards but further your game plan.
---
This dude is -1 draw when you get him. It's a bomb, but you dont take damage and you don't draw a card.
---
I just... I can't even. This does not "surely" set you up for lethal. Just stick the goddamn mechs and pass. 9 times out of 10 they will concede to a 20/30 snip snap. 
---
The other 1 out of 10 they would have beaten you even if you had stealthed your mecharoo. Trust me.
---
What does putting him first in line have to do with who the opponent puts first? All that matters is either he's taunted and will potentially get hit first or he will be hitting a taunt first.
---
??? What are you responding to?
---
I'm talking about game design. The devs said warlock shouldn't have face damage. Giving them one new face damage card means they can burst people to death once they get low. Letting this card exist breaks the identity of "Can't burst people."
---
Malygos Druid is proof that is doesn't take much for a deck to be all about using spells to kill people. Druid is "Supposed" to be the "Play big minions, have trouble removing them" class, but they've become the spell-centric combo class because of only a couple cards.
---
This is closer to the twin emperors than it is to the old tutor. It's a late game tempo play that rewards you for committing a specific archetype. Like twin emperor, it's a really mediocre card until you've met its condition. 
---
A 6/6 for 6 that draws you your late game win con is ok, but the fact that it only tutors galk can make it awkward/ a dead card for most of the game. 
---
Galkoron's want to stay in your hand while you scale it up up, but this guy encourages you to play your galk quickly, since it's a vanilla 6/6 (basically a dead draw) if galk is already in your hand. Also, the 4/6 tutor from wotog was unplayable trash, and this is meant to be a powerful neutral legendary. The fact that kronx is better than a garbage 6 drop from 3+ years ago doesn't really mean much.
