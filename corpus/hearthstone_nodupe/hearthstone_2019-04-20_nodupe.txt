I feel like there really is no purpose in elysiana. The only control decks that come remotely close to fatigue other than warriors is mage. And no mage will run with her in the deck because you will never fatigue against any other class than warrior...
---
---
---
I remember those days.
---
Now i just play arena and have usually at least 500 gold at all times.
---
I don’t deny that, I just think it’s funny that you think Blizzard really listens to our feedback
---
What are these obvious patterns? Do you mean like card draw rng or card generation rng or boombot hit face for 1 rng or just all of that?
---
Oh man I felt like that guy just now. I usually just curse under my breath and throw my phone though. You know, the usual.
---
What have you been playing then?
---
Zoom in on Reno.... He looks like he's got a hangover from hell lol
---
I wonder if they will be answering questions on alternative game mods in the works.
---
Does he make his own titles and thumbnails?
---
&gt; to increase the total number of views
---

---
And where do you think those views come from? No matter how clickbaity you make your titles and thumbnails, your hearthstone videos will be shown to people who watch hearthstone videos. By having your video promoted more by youtube's algorithm, you're promoting your video *instead of another HS video*. The total amount of views doesn't increase.
---
That's not counter play, that's just just playing the game.  
---
Counter play such as silence a taunt minion, destroy a weapon.  
---
There is what, 1 card that affects hero powers in mind breaker?  
---
You seem to want to argue about "decks" where as I'm referring to a specific card and it's mechanics.  
---
I assume you had the same argument when Rexxar was in play because plenty of decks countered hunter decks so thus Rexxar wasn't a problem for infinite generation either then?
---
Rocketeer is mentioned by OP in another comment as having a 60% win rate.

Trump's reactions are the best.  I want to go see a horror movie with that dude.
---
Who is this?
---
Id say all of it. Im assuming that they all use some sort of seed number to create the rng. But I guess I just want a little more in depth explanation on how it all works.
---
Idk why the dislikes lol his videos are the best out there! :)
---
Was checking out the PTR earlier, saw these outside of Mechagon. Was great, almost made a post before seeing this.
---
I mean I don’t prefer a more aggro playstyle so maybe tempo rouge but there is also token druid but id  don’t want to feed the flame more
---
Yep. Agreed. I've never actually hit the turn limit either.
---
Ah, you’re one of those. Anyways, there’s a “report bug with this npc” button on everything in the ptr.
---
Earlier today in arena my opponent played a faceless summoner after khadgar and summoned two deathlords. When I killed them they each summoned 2 copies of a minion from my deck. Was kind of unexpected but makes sense.
---
"Choose both" with fandral isn't a regular card (clearly), so there's no reason to believe it will always act like a normal card. The healing is the *expected* outcome, but you always want confirmation.
---
I teched hecklebot in my control shaman for this reason but I can never pull that damned elysiana.
---
Hey /u/thecoolestdomains, just a heads up that I'm sending the full content of that message to /u/siz27.  I'm not sure why you decided to post this here instead of sending him a PM, but just FYI, saying that you are just going to create an alt to get around a ban probably isn't the smartest thing.
---
Theres always the scenario of drawing bad
---
&gt;Archivist Elysiana will generate more long term value for Control Warrior than Dr. Boom ever will, and even if Delivery Drone 
---
I wonder how successful that deck would be without Boom though? From the few games I've played against it, it has always been Boom that gave the deck the longevity for Elysiana to come into play.
---
Not a great enough sample size for me to see how else it could be played though.
---
Im gonna need you to stop spamming this sub sir
---
Pay to play a lot of different decks quickly. F2p players can climb easy, but it might take some patience to grind quest gold and get dust for a competitive deck that's not too expensive. Check out some streamers who have done f2p to legend, I believe some guys from Solary went f2p to legend with Midrange hunter which is a relatively inexpensive deck. If you want to enjoy 9 classes with diverse, competitive decks for each, it's gonna cost you a lot of time, money, or both.

You can reach legend without spending money. You will however be limited to a few decks for awhile, unless you choose to spend money
---
I wonder if the best play would be to only allow it to be played the one time. That way you still get the one instance of it, which is still good. But none of this 40 minute games BS.
---
Idk im in legend atm mostly face tempo rogue mirrors.
---
Card's insane even outside of tempo rogue mirrors too.
---
VS Datareaper had the same conclusion as me too.
---
I played this game for about 3 months without paying, and it was still very fun. I was able to reach rank 5 consistently with a deck I had saved up dust for. Playing free-to-play will not hinder you competitively, but it will restrict your play options. If you don’t buy expansion pre-orders and want to play ranked, you’ll have to stick to the same deck for a while. If you want to play competitively and have multiple strong decks, you’ll most likely have to buy some packs.

&gt; goldshire footman
---
whats wrong with the good old footman?
---
There no logic or proof of any lack of ignorance on your part or in your post either. You haven't provided even a single example, how's that for logic? If you want some information, shaman's hero power will summon a basic totem that is not already on the board guaranteed until all 4 are there. That's one example where RNG is intentionally not random in the game.
---
I think she's one of the strongest
---
Congrats!!
---
Congrats! Its a nice achievement
---
You boo boo boom me?
---
a quick google search (0.46 seconds) indicates yes, it is Travis Willingham.
---
Divisive is a good word.
---
I think that there's always been a fairly large gap here between what each different type of person wants out of WoW, but BfA seems to be increasing that gap.
---
For example - Some people are miffed that some classes aren't terribly good. If you look at the Mythic Dungeon ranking board, its nearly all the same team compositions with no variety. 
---
Some people are finding the plot to be at its most absurd, in all the wrong and illogical ways. Sylvana's actions and the actions of everyone else are kinda dumb and strange. 
---
The dumb artifact necklace wasn't well received by a lot of people and Azerite armor was just random gambling for a long time (as well as requiring a hefty gold cost if you wanted to use that armor for your other specializations). 
---
A lot of things felt dumbed down. WoW is known for throwing new things at the dart board every expansion, but Legion was relatively in a solid place, and Blizzard threw it all to the ground to seemingly start anew.
---
There's a lot of reasons also that I think more vocal players might be able to fill in as well.
---
It's having some troubles, but it seems like they are making some changes to turn it around.
---
Thank you!
---
I know he did the voice in HS, I was asking if he did it for WOW too? I assume yes but still
---
A guy added me once just to say his jaw dropped at my opener (it was a mirror match) I thought that was funny and we are still friends, often msg each other when we're laddering to see how it's going.
---
Ayyy gz man! SMOrc
---
Usually people joke about how hearthstone is unplayable, but this time is quite literally, I had two of these disconnects in three games
---
Are you all saying boo boom or boo urns?
---
This makes me supremely happy. I love everything about the explorers league. So glad to see they have representation in the main game.
---
Bad streaks. Happens sometimes.
---
Few days ago I went from R10 to R5 with Conjurer Mage with ease. Then the next day I couldn’t win a game for the life of me. 
---
As long as the deck has a positive WR%, you’ll get there eventually. Keep at it ^^
---
For real tho, is it a faceless because she like worships the old gods?
---
This has been posted a million times, but this the first time I’ve seen someone take 9 turns to get their. 0 mana rock my dude.
---
Right now? Mossy Horror because well /fuckdruid.
---
Blood(fury?) potion
---
Yeah it is a good card, great tempo for token druid
---
Still spammig this?
---
I am worried this will turn out to be yet another rehashed Dungeon Run. It was good the first time, but Monster Hunt was "meh" and by RR it was so boring I barely did it at all. I am glad they are giving a free wing to try it, because there is no way I would buy it without trying first.
---
Congrats! I'm trying to do the same thing
---
Rope me every turn and damn straight I will.
---
Turn her into a 7 mana neutral legendary spell that summons a 7/7 and does the pick 5 thing. One use only. Easy fix, still keep the cool effect.
---
I played the same way, even silencing their first Lucentbark before they got another copy from Floop. They got one crystalizer off which let them heal but the rest of their healing cards were defunct.
---
Thanks bud, the last 12 hours have been hectic went from rank 1 to 3 and 4 a couple of times. Just happy to play and relax now. Good luck with your climb.
---
You deserve cancer
---
Don’t tell me who to apologize to!!
---
Blizz, you can do better than this for the next expansion. Please don't sue me 👼👼👼
---
But to be honest, i would put fellord betrug, for the plot twist and solarium combos
---
I thought the puzzles sucked, rumble was ok.
---
Dungeon runs we're pretty great though.
---
Timer hearthstone sounds good
---
Only if you want to win
---
Well he got boom on 7 and I haven't drawn it yet, guess I lose.
---
Loved the folks that take till the timer starts to play a stone tusk boar in turn one
---
Shhhh don’t tell them
---
You cast a spell &gt; Secret triggers when you cast a spell &gt; Spell Does it's effects (Unless Countered). It's actually like one of the only interactions that makes complete sense.
---
Have played ~5000 games on mobile (3/4g)over the years, from the opposite side of the world, often while moving at 200k+ on a train and have had a handful of unexplained dcs. 
---
It’s actually amazing
---
15 seconds per round sounds good?
---
I love this! League of Explorers was in my opinion the best expansión of Hearthstone ever made, the game during that time was so amazing and fun
---
It's like, hmm a hunter secret it might be snip- FREE FROM THAT BLASTED TOWER and then it shows explosive trap
---
I do this sometimes as a paladin player who runs a prince Liam deck, became a bomb warrior the other day and no issues for me.
---
Yeah I’ve been using a version of this with waggle instead of zilliax and I’ve done pretty well with it
---
i did win, the fact that this was the only thing that could’ve possibly saved me at 5 health. what are the odds lol
---
But being totally honest, the best play there is without a doubt Godfrey ^^
---
Well you can't play timber wolf with a full board..
---
Australia, and it's not ISP, I can't log from mobile or PC, getting same error
---
That’s what I was thinking. Same effect as death wing except you get to keep your hand
---
Or you could add a win condition to your deck
---
Yes, it is indeed the best play, then you can go the 8-8 or some other powerful legendaries in your hand
---
I literally started this expansion at rank 18. It had been since December since I played. I’m currently back at rank 5. 
---
I’m also a whale so I had access to every deck at rank 18. I played a few janky home brews during my climb.
---
You can spend more money and have better cards or play against decks that are better than yours. Those are your only options.
---
From 18 to 15 I played against only two decks that weren’t net decks. From 15 to 5 it was only net decks.
---
Pretty much after rank 20 it’s only net decks. You can only climb if you’re a better pilot.
---
Godfrey is absolutely insane with splintergraph too if he sticks
---
ahhh that is who I was thinking of
---
Why didn't he kill Darius?
---
Because both decks do the same thing and it all comes down to RNG.
---
In current control warrior it's really who gets their DK first, hits better mechs off their discover, and hits better cards off their Elys
---
Samwell.
---
So you're saying that pro players don't go the distance in control matchups? I don't think you've put any actual research into your response...
---
Have you?
---
Do you mind if I ask why you have been sleeping in hotels?
---
Poisonous mech in hunter and spiderbomb help, hex in shaman, execute in warrior, poly in mage; i think thats it, the other classes have to deal with it through minions I guess.
---
The secret should be reworded to match that description then, because as it stands it implies that when a minion is played, regardless of what happens to that minion after, it will summon a copy of what was Played. Played is the key word here that you are all overlooking, it shouldn't by the cards description matter what becomes of the minion after because in order for a minion to trigger Any effect it must first be played or summoned, and in this case the secret requires a minion to be played, that's all it says it does not say after a minion is played and remains in it's original form on the board summon a copy. I don't see how you are all continuing to debate this, down vote me as much as you want but you know the logic is correct.
---
Please post deck list   
---
How many wins did you get?
---
same, lost 3 arena games like that and at least 3 ranked
---
they should also bring back the clock in-game
---
&gt; and then watches as he loses the game.                  
---
The subject is still Kibler. He stated correctly that kibler lost.         
---
But the hotdog part is a lie though, Kibler did go to the bathroom after asking a judge if he could. So he F6 and left the opponent continue the turn with a judge checking.
---
Your fault is that you’re assuming that you can trust what’s written on the card.
---
You can’t.
---
I’m right because I understand the logic of how hearthstone actually works, so when I card says “after” I know what that means in this game.
---
[removed]
---
Some bugs have to get fixed. Others get dumped to the end of the massive list of to-do's. The pessimism comes off as narcissism more than anything (why didn't the bug ***I*** reported get fixed!?). Pretty sure they fixed plenty of bugs before BfA went live but just didn't get around to fixing ALL of them.
---
Then it seems you don't understand what played means in it
---
Obviously I do, because I’m not the one who misunderstands how the card works lol
---
That fact that warriors seem to be able to consistently clear 3 back-to-back boards of 6/6s is a little ridiculous.
---
No but you fail to see why it doesn't work as it is described
---
Flare is intended to beat secrets. _However_, Never Surrender and Counterspell are both intended to beat _spells_, so neither interaction would be perfectly 'thematic' - either way, _one_ of the two effects is going to have to fail at their intended role.
---
In this case, the interaction between secrets and Flare is explained by order of resolution. Counterspell and Never Surrender both read "when your opponent casts a spell", and both of them are intended to take effect _before the spell resolves_. For Counterspell, this is **necessary** (you need Counterspell to trigger **before** Twisting Nether wipes your board or Fireball burns your face off!), whereas for Never Surrender it's a big part of its power (you want the +2 health before Hellfire or Flamestrike connects with your troops).
---
So, if the secrets take effect before the spell resolves, then by definition they trigger before Flare can destroy them, because Flare destroying secrets is part of its effect on resolution. To 'fix' this, Flare would need some sort of special text like "this doesn't trigger secrets"... in which case Counterspell suddenly stops protecting your _other_ secrets from Flares, which is a totally reasonable expectation.
---
No fully understand what you’re saying. 
---
But there’s tons of cards that aren’t worded well in this game, so there’s no sense at all debating based on what the card says.
---
The crow has 0 attack despite being adjacent to the wolf.
---
I will never stop saying tunnel blaster is great in spell deathrattle mech hunter. Just one copy is 5 clears, thanks to 9 lives. This one tech card flipped the token druid match up from "unwinnable" to even, and it also pulls its weight against zoolock and (to a lesser extent) lackey rogue.
---
Battletag:  Menlyn#2964
---
Region: Asia
---
Trade only?: Yes, you go first
---
scammer
---
That is literally the point of control; outlast your opponent by .... *controlling* the game.
---
Well, you should at least use mechwarper.
---
You can have the fourth best deck in the world, if you meet the three bastards with the top three you most likely go 0-3
---
Now I'll just sit here and wait for Gnomes to be paladins :)
---
Blizzard keeps nerfing good cards and printing mediocre cards. They conned everyone into believing Standard is better than Wild, and we pay for it, big time, both in terms of playable deck types and money lost.
---
What I got so far (from top to bottom)

I too am supremely happy, and I would be even more SUPREEEEME-ly happy to see a certain Arch-Thief appear alongside them...
---
At least you get a massage
---
Mechathun
---
wargears is slow after i testing. will try more for it.
---
Galvanizer, we dont actually have many mech minions in hand, i better this one change to a tempo minion.
---
venomizers, already included
---
i crafted zilliax and have a leeroy in deck previously, but later removed, cause slow
---
the other reason i put so many small minion is because i want to fully use Cybertech Chip
---
Connor rapper is a tiny creator with only a few hundred subs. If you like his stuff consider supporting it on his channel.

Yesterday going second in a game, on turn 3 i play banana buffoon beside my silverhand recruit from round 2.
---
On round four he jams his heckle bot and pulls my recurring villain, i see him highlight my banana buffoon "Thank You!" Said my paladin
---
Hes a looky looky man
---
this one for wild, we talk standard 1st
---
Hearthstone really doesn't get that much love comparatively. The Heroes of the Storm original character Zeratul was brought into starcraft before the game was even out of beta.
---
I know people hate these kinds of decks but i really want my otk back just back of this bullshit here.. why did they kill mecha'thun?? they should have at least tried to add in new abilties that help trigger it
---
Pros have gone several times into max turn limit in this mirror several times in the past.

&gt;  happens when neither player understands how to play control v control.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If the game is 40 turns in and neither player has managed to build the pressure to win, then there's something wrong with how they're piloting the decks
---
You underestimate how much rng hearthstone has.
---
That’s because they’re both Indiana Jones inspired, but portrayed differently. I think I heard from somewhere than while Harrison Jones is based off the iconic Indiana we all know today (portrayed by Harrison Ford), Reno is based on an earlier version of the character, who would’ve had a mustache and been portrayed by Tom Selleck instead.
---
Yeah Gaara was so hyped about the expansion, until they revealed Elysiana. 
---
Even Peter Whalen said they wanted a step back from infinite value cards...
---
DKs , Herocards, Elysiana etc. allow decks to go super anti aggro, because they don’t have to balance out their decks with lategame valuecards if they have one card that does the job even better than several others ( like Cairne for example).

RandomSkills #21679 EU 80g quest
---
You survived with 1HP.
---
They nerfed rogue though which feels great. Rogue was too dominant in arena
---
My winrate is higher when I go second. Any idea why that may be?
---
You're right but you're also just not playing along with the joke. Pretty sure everyone already knows that, it isn't exactly a difficult concept to wrap your head around.
---
Well going from 12-2 to 0-3 is is basically like channelling the innermost feelings of /r/hearthstonecirclejerk.
---
I don't know how I went from hero to zero so quickly
---
MMW They're gonna tease the futur HS expansion in Uldum with a WoW sidequest involving the LoE and we'll see another comeback of the LoE as cards
---
He wouldn't have his heal-to-full ability I think. Well, maybe as a self-heal skill and as a tank or bruiser.
---
Zero to hero*
---
Happy 4/20 🚬🚬🚬
---
Lul order
---
you have 80% to win. stop crying please.
---
I was shocked to learn its classic set tbh. One of my least favorite cards ever.
---
No, I went 12-2, then immediately after 0-3.
---
I'm the only fucker that can turn the saying around so it's hero to to zero.
---
You really think it’s impossible to get wins with that? It’s obviously not great, but I would argue 0-3 isn’t inevitable with it. A bit of luck, maybe better decisions than OP took, and I can totally see this going like 2-3 or whatever.
---
The game shouldn't have had an e-sports scene in the first place. If they focused on it's more casual aspect and put out fun and experimental content, that the other more competitive MOBAs like LoL and Dota were too afraid to do, they could've had a good share of the market. They could have been the Mario Kart of MOBAs but instead it turned into just another wannabe "next big e-sport" that most people didn't care about.
---
I keep mass dispel only because of mech decks.
---
Well... i am not actually so certain about that. 
---
Subjective perception is really strong and most people actually believe they are unlucky. 
---
Also "rng hate" is still a thing and also visible in this comment section.
---
Hero card are just too powerful, be it hagatha or boom. Boom is so much more powerful though
---
Black magic items.
---
Well the winrate you would compare against is at least a bit higher than 80% but yes, this is definitely the way to go about playing Hearthstone.
---
Why do  
---
You write everything  
---
Like this  
---
Are you having  
---
A fucking stroke?
---
Overkill: lose the game bc youre running 6 dead cards?
---
Next time with the minion that makes your windfury to mega-windfury.
---
Last turn play auchenai phantasm and coffin crasher, use divine hymn. It will summon Mechathun. Then cast circle of healing and 2 regenarates on mechathun.
---
True but me and my friend already have this going on kinda to late know haPPy Easter
---
getting rekt by drooling noobs.
---
Well then, i hope it work wells for you guys !
---
I just got perfect curved 9 turns in a fakkin row by a Rogue who went first.
---
I go first by some MIRACLE and can't even land a 3 drop.
---
Your gameplan becomes worthless far earlier than the point where the Warrior wins. It's not true at all that you have until the turn limit to win, but that's fine, it's not uncommon for control decks to win by concession once they've stabilized. That's a completely different issue, if an issue at all. 
---
Elysiana here is only really a problem in control mirrors. Trying to bring mirrors to turn limit should not be the prevalent strategy. The fact there are no proper deterministic finishers for control matchups when Elysiana exists is also a big issue.
---
I honestly believe that would go way down if you only took into account good tempo rogue players. I don't have hsreplay but I'd be amazed if the winrate was anywhere near that high at high legend.
---
Same reason patron warrior had a low winrate.
---
Of those, the minions used most often and not limited to a Class would be:
---
* MC-Tech and Defender of Argus
---
* Sea Giant
---
* Thalnos
---
The others are either used generally less often or in more specific deck ideas, however in there, these Neutrals come up most often:
---
* Doomsayer, Auctioneer (mostly used by Rogues and Druids) and Alexstrasza
---
And since you want to get the more solid base first, so to speak, I'd leave things like Malygos, Black Knight, Harrison and Greenskin for the absolute last.
---
As for class-specific cards:
---
* Paladin:  Tirion
---
* Hunter: King Krush
---
* Warlock: Twisting Nether
---
* Warrior: Frothing
---
To reiterate and sum that up, I'd recommend this order, starting with Epics and leaving Legendaries for last, more or less in order of how often they're used:
---
*Epics first, Neutrals (can be used in any class)*
---
* MC-Tech
---
* Defender of Argus
---
* Faceless
---
* Doomsayer
---
* Eaglehorn Bow
---
* Frothing Berserker
---
* Twisting Nether
---
* Big Game Hunter
---
*Legendaries second, starting with Neutrals (can be used in any class)*
---
* Captain Greenskin
---
* Alexstrasza
---
* Malygos
---
* Harrison
---
* Black Knight
---
*Class-specific Legendaries:*
---
* Tirion
---
* King Krush
---
* Antonidas
---
* Al'Akir
---
The problem is Elysiana needs to exist so there's a neutral counter to having 50 bombs in your deck.  
---
All classes (save warlock who has Rafaam) might eventually need to run her.
---
and i  got. cabel rat 😬
---
Thing is I want more long term investment.
---
The good decks always require one or two class legendaries and aren't even guaranteed to get me to a high rank to return on that investment. I would rather improve a lot of deck I have with something like Doomsayers, Thalnos and Harrison.
---
IT WAS TURN 6, YOU JUST MELTED YOUR OPPONENT DOWN TO 2 HP WITH YOUR SUPER STRONG AGGRO DECK, BUT THEN YOU HEAR IT. THAT VOICE... THAT SOOTHING VOICE.

Predictive vs descriptive analysis are two entirely different concepts. I don't have faith in anyone's ability to make accurate meta predictions and I find efforts mostly pointless. Trump puts a lot of effort into predicting the meta which is pretty dicey, but I appreciate his re-reviews where he discusses why he was wrong.
---
Vicious Syndicate's descriptive analysis is fairly solid.
---
Nah you're all thinking about it wrong. Before they pull Mecha'thun, play Thaurissan discounting Hemet, EMP Operative and Explore Un'goro so next turn you can destroy your deck and Mecha'thun!
---
interesting way of thinking. i think best investment is the one that brings the most gold. so making a good deck would bring you a lot of gold by wins, and you also get those wins faster since it has a higher win rate.
---
but if you don't think like that, at least focus on classic cards that are currently used in good decks. like lackey rogue, control warrior or bomb warrior. this link can help to see which classic cards are being used the most. https://hsreplay.net/cards/#set=EXPERT1&amp;sortBy=includedPopularity

lol
---
Nice battletag ^.~
---
This is a bad way to look at it. Having a bunch of typically great cards doesn't mean anything if you can't craft a cohesive deck with them. Figure out what decks you want to play and craft the cards you need for those. The cards that are consistently *in* the good decks that you want to play will be good investments anyway. If a card is "good" and a "safe craft", you'll find it keeps popping up in decklists you want to play, so you'll craft it to play said deck anyway.
---
Just because Malygos is great doesn't mean it does you any good to have in your collection if you can't craft a whole Malygos deck, and if you *can* and want to, you should, rather than crafting Malygos, Tirion, and Greenskin, and not being able to make a full deck for any of the three.
---
I understand what it feels like in your position, but I promise you, as someone who has played for over 4 years f2p and has a really fleshed out collection at this point, you're looking at it the wrong way.
---
One of the things that has kept Magic alive and strong as a game for 26 years is the fact that you can play it however you want, and that there is a variety of healthy competitive and casual formats. You are seriously underestimating the impact these would have on Hearthstone. 
---
Wild was an attempt, but they can’t balance their game properly or decide what kind of format they want Wild to be, so it remains an unpopular shitshow. New, *properly* implemented game modes and a willingness to balance the ones that exist would be huge. But I have no confidence that Team 5 is capable of doing any of that.
---
Balance as it should always be
---
Wait...
---
But rogues care more about tempo
---
I have had it since a year but never seen these stats, where to look?
---
Nah 6 endless and self reviving lucentbarks suits me right
---
amazing ....
---
Yeah. that's what gets me. Two control decks play to a draw, and then it is a RNG clown fiesta of "who got offered the better cards?"
---
You didn't mean that, did you?
---
I've seen this exact same thing but only with kalecgos...&gt;.&lt;
---
My upvote will tear you apart.
---
Yeah, was curious about these kind of ideas. Easy for the player base to want these, but what would be the specifics? Is it even possible, could such a mode plausibly exist.
---
Any aggro deck will beat them they are not fast to deal with multiple minion and mech hunter has no aoe at all

He has hellfire, sludge belcher and a silence, and that’s just the cards in the screenshot. Likely has a felfire with that many 6 drops too.
---
Mine are 71 % on the play and 67 % on the coin. Do you have any idea why your winrates are so disparate?
---
Not only that, WoW writers are famously bad at introdycing new interesting characters that don't die or are forever abandoned at the end of the quest line.
---
I was actualy excited that HS is a new way to introduce new characters that people instantly recognise and care about.
---
Shaman, it's the Swiss army knife of classes.
---
I'm also going to guess a majority of the people calling it a good deck don't actually play arena and don't understand that everyone drafts tempo. This is one of the crappiest tempo decks I've seen, I fully understand why this got rolled.
---
Real mistake is giving it shadowstep effect, a card that causes problems every single meta.
---
Heh, I got my golden Hunter today too.  We're... um... golden hero brothers or something.
---
Because most of my cards are rotated to wild. There's an emotional bond with wild. 
---
 Besides that, wild has a different meta and the card pool is huge. You can see millions of cards in action. 
---
Rank 20-15 wild is a wonderland. Everyone is trying silly decks and cheese strategies. Of course wild has try hard people playing big priest or any meta deck but overall, when standard is getting bored (you see same 100 cards again and again and again...) wild is a solid alternative. 
---
For example I play full thief priest for the fun. Or 4x ragnaros otk. You know, it is a silly place.
---
I doubt this sub knows what they want.
---
Prep goes hand to hand with combo's (the entire core of rogue). I think prep is fine, it's these damn wep's that get greenskin'd
---
You can do that with your friend. All you have to say is "Hey build a deck according to these rules."
---
You can play all deck and meta is more stale mean that less investment in long run compare to standard.
---
If you go first you instant concede then?
---
Of course it’s possible to get wins, but tapping your first few turns and losing board with only one board clear is a recipe for 0-3. Guessing op didn’t get his two drops early and the enemies just snowballed off it.
---
&gt; "*Likely* has a felfire"
---
Oh, so now we're calling it a good deck by simply guessing cards that are in it that we don't know about? I guess he likely has a Deathwing and a Lord Godfrey as well, how bad must he be to not be able to get wins with those cards in his deck?
---
Rogue and warlock seems to be super strong. Lackey generation cards are very powerful.
---
I think warlock is kinda superior cause of the removal/control tool and the hero power.
---
paladin/rogue/hunter
---
I instantly concede the mirror. It’s horrible
---
That’s a good point about seeing the same repetitive cards. Thanks!
---
Dragon control paladin. Except not really because dragon control paladin just doesn't work, and its issue is less remaining alive after turn 10 and more reaching turn 10 to begin with.
---
Blizzard seems to like the concept of control dragon paladin (well, more than they liked the concept of freeze shaman anyway), so I would keep it just in case.
---
I like how you only commented on the speculation part. He clearly has comeback cards in the deck but I guess he never drew them or they just weren’t enough.
---
Won against some mech hunters with heal druid. Out value them in every way!
---
If you did that just recently. You might regret it, it’s best to save extra cards until some nerfs are announced
---
Too bad Jaraxxus is suicide with all these Rogues running around, assuming there was a decent control list to put it into.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Here is a nice freeze mage deck Ive been running at rank 4-5.  It has 2 legendaries, but I feel Antonitis is the only real requirement here.  Gameplan is simple, do as much face dmg as possible while stalling the board with your various freeze spells.  Extra face dmg comes from lifedrinker and sunweaver.   Save ray of frost twinspells for Antonitis.  Turn 9 generates two fireballs alone, and it can spiral if they cannot remove him. 
---
Its pretty fun and best of all it does well against Rogue (stall and let them run out of steam) and warrior (you can out damage their armor gain, but control is much tougher than bomb)
---
The kitten looks like the one depicted in the MTG card Harmless Offering.
---
How the hell is this related to Hearthstone?
---
On OmniStone they mentioned a Fibonacci Warrior list that goes down the route of running Boom Reaver, Dimensional Rippers, and other big stuff to just kill the opponent, and that's how he has been tackling Elysiana Warriors.
---
I don't know how successful it is, but there's definitely room for exploration for a Big Warrior. I think the list's smallest minion was Archmage Vargoth. The concern is how susceptible the deck might be to Token Druid and other lists, though.
---
When will Blizzard realize no one likes "infinite" cards
---
There is no fatigue games, since elisyana actually makes you inmune to it for enough time that the game reaches the turn limit and ends in a draw. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I am okey with decks that aim to get to fatigue and win there (like good old control warrior that armored up a lot and won by having tons of hp more) but this time arround its not good. The matchup of slow decks versus slow decks normally means that even if both end up in a situation where any of them can beat the other, the fatigue damage will give one of them a victory, and therefore playing to NOT draw and try to stay with as little resources as possible, and optimice them as much as possible too, was what decided the vitory there. Right now, with elysiana, unless you highroll your opponent with it, you both will just get into a draw. And that is the problem. There is no decision making anymore since both decks can barely win the other, and fatigue is not a constant damage that will make one lose before the other after a while, both are inmune to fatigue with her.
---
The fact that you are limiting people to specific deck types is a great indicator of why these decks are problematic.
---
Some extra info by the Player [HsPhoeba](https://twitter.com/HsPhoeba) (Who played this Deck to Top 50 actually)
---
&gt;\[...\] I would like to add some  info because this might happen in your games with this deck:   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;1) If they pull out malygos (with hecklebot) you can still easily win by doing the  combo with boomship into shieldslam.   
---
&gt;2) vs mirrors if you can try to always keep coin and shieldslam so if  the saboteur have lower chances hitting boomship or if the hit a combo  piece to do your combo with shieldslam.  
---
&gt;3) Vs aggro you rarely win with  your combo so use your combo pieces as clear if you need to.
---
Simply put, no.
---
Man I really wish they hadn’t deleted all their comments I was in the mood to see some funny shit this morning. :’(
---
Mecha'thun. Jeeeeez
---
Most insightful take on this issue so far.
---
You got a mechathun deck that works right now?
---
Opinions on constructed vary, but Arena is doing fine.  They just rebalanced the classes after the new expansion, and they're planning to do it again probably next week.  There are a lot of old sets in the arena right now mixed in with the new ones, and they have been great about removing cards that are too swingy like Mind Control Tech.
---
She doesn’t trigger battlecries though.
---
And game got better with actual quick balance changes and balanced expansion instead of a big dummy guy with a loud figure who kept being the damage control tool for Blizzard whenever shit hit the fan.
---
Probably not as much as you.
---
Twisting nether in a zoo deck. You are a madlad here.

Also the less time they have to win gold, in Blizzard's eyes

or bladefurry to no face dmg adn double the cost. Like either nerf wouldve been fine but no. as aoe could do more then flamestrike but only if you you invested weapon or hero power plus 1or more weapon buffs and possible prep. My most hated nerf of those.
---
I don't enjoy aggro and am a combo player at heart, but aggro takes more skill than people give it credit for, it will do OK if you play bad but only do really good if you play well
---
She may have adopted.
---
Never, ever, go full Northshire...
---
The card is already eighteen decks for the price of one legendary card. In exchange for all that value in the card, you don't get to choose which deck you play during any particular game.
---
Oh well. I guess its tabbycat
---
My only issue with Elysiana is being able to Brewmaster/Banker on the same turn.
---
I’d be okay with it getting nerfed to 9/10 mana, i’d probably still run it too.
---
Holy Celcius, Meter and Gram! Amen.
---
In my opinion, it's shaping up to be the single best card this expansion.
---
Wild pyromancer helps against big boards. Maybe swap out feral rage.
---
Not sure if emperor is needed so you can take him out too.  Possibly add acolyte of pain since it works well with pyro.
---
If you got to choose then 1 class would be chosen everytime to climb ranks. In friend duels or casual maybe but probably not
---
Thanks
---
It's because one is a class card, it's allowed to be stronger.

Do you want specifics or just a generalization?

Not in how I’d envisage it. The legendary effect exists independently of the card, so if a second card tried to trigger it it would fail.
---
If it were more enforcers and fewer hellfires it'd be worth it I'd say. More chance of killing them in the backswing.
---
It tried to pull it out while it was still taking up the seventh board space. Thus your board was full and it couldn't pull it from you hand

i remember when 2 dead mans hand warrior mirror in a tournament. It took 1.5 hours before turn limit. Removing turn limit would make that game to last forever.
---
Iam pretty sure that he thinks Arena has the same cards as standard
---
MoD a Gru'ul for an old-school shade of naxxramas :P
---
Kazakus is a mage card, I don't see why he wouldbn't be discoverable
---
I was specifically referring to the baleful elysiana combo which appears to be way less impactful than expected, especially double balefull is pretty much just a meme.
---
A ban system like in tournaments would still be a decent solution. 
---
1000g, ban out 1 class you don't want to meet on ladder. Only obtainable through gold, no $$. 
---
So you gotta play the game and then you can ban out 1 class. 
---
Tournaments are doing this forever. "You don't want to play a certain deck cause your lineup isn't going well against it? Ban it out"
---
Ladder is the exact opposite. You are not allowed to play what you want, you are forced to play what the ppl on ladder play.
---
Hagatha and Zul'Jin are relatively fine, the rush component for nearly all cards and the many HP are just overkill.
---
I’m intent on trying this version, as I only need thun, militia commanders and 2 town criers and have everything else from my pure control warrior deck.
---
It's because the copies are "added" to your hand and not technically "drawn". Syntax is very important in card games.
---
You can deal 18 dmg to face with this hand.
---
Equip waggle hit face
---
play 2 evicerate
---
play 2 lackeys
---
shadow lackey
---
play lackey
---
glyph reduces the cost by 2
---
It's always important to determine whether you're the aggro deck or the control deck in any matchup...
---
Flamestrike normally costs 7. Glyph reduces the cost of the spell discovered by 2. Nerubian increases it by 2.
---
Primordial glyph reduces its cost by 2
---
Primordial glyph reduces the cost of the spell you discover by (2).
---
You said it yourself
---
Glyph reduced the cost to 5 mana
---
That boosted it back to 7
---
-2 through glyph, +2 through minion = 7
---
God, the Blade Flurry nerf still hurts my soul. I'd love for it to be reverted to its former glory and then added to the Hall of Fame, just so I can play Oil Rogue again.

My name is beeen brode
---
Still the same effect. Just one cost more.
---
I'm not saying just because it's better, it's great, I'm just saying it's the best we've had in a while
---
Big Priest is Tier 2 because every deck is either teched against it or chosen because its winrate against Big Priest is good.  Decks that aren't good against Big Priest just can't be played unless you're non-competitive or a hobbyist of the deck, or it has to feast specifically on the decks that beat Big Priest.  The entire meta is warped around this one deck that everyone hates playing against, and the strongest argument against the developers intervening is that when the entire meta is warped against it it's only a great deck instead of the singular very best one.
---
Well brode did this pretty much om his own cus reddit asked for it. Obviously this one is the better rap but brode made the other one more memorable.
---
Hall of Fame Elysiana I'm serious. That card is one of the most poorly designed things I've ever seen. No matter how you nerf that card it will always be a required card in any control deck to not lose control vs control. On top of that it turns control matchups into "who has the better discover RNG" the game.
---
Elysiana is as badly designed as Genn and Baku and those cards were atdocious levels of badly designed.
---
Its got the demon tribe discount
---
And the animation isn't as good.
---
Not sure why Zoolock runs Flame Imp over Mad Bomber tbh. More easily countered.
---
I thought it was clear enough.
---
Feels like it was longer ago.
---
I want you in my room
---
You can't nerf her in any meaningful way. If she was 10 mana she'll still be played because you'll still lose control vs contorl matchups if she isn't in your deck.
---
and every controll deck has basicly 40 cards and a match takes ages.
---
1. usually no since it has more value if you can hit and then bounce it back with the pick to push 12 face dmg for 3 mana
---
2. for most cases i try to keep miscreant esp with backstab against most matchups. for control i try to keep the thug. prep+raid+edwin is pretty strong as well if on the coin
---
3. its the lackeys that are pretty strong for its cost despite miscreant's 1/5 statline: there are times you can ping with him using the +1atk plus rush; after trading u can transform him; cheap 2 dmg; more spells! i even had games where i put a cold blood on miscreant to push dmg to the face where the opponent had to use removal
---
literally the most reliable on board form of dmg. Consistency is key. If I hadnt packed him (ecstatic when that happened btw) id have crafted him
---
Is the 2nd row supposed to be 2018?
---
I think most of these nerfs were bad choices then and still are now. Blizzard prints some new garbage that does something just as bad or worse, but now we have to pay for it, and it rotates. Great. I don't believe them for a second when they say they change stuff for design space.
---
ur deck is insane with 3 abyssals and so many lackeys with the haunted creepers
---
I don't actually think Dr. Boom is busted. There were a lot of decks last expansion that ran Dr. Boom and weren't that good.
---
Compare Dr. Boom to Zul'jin... Zul'jin swings the match pretty easily. IMO

*"It’s important to point out that, in general, we like that Classes in Hearthstone have signature cards that appear in decks frequently, since they help give each Class its identity. We also still think it’s good for some signature Class cards to be in Druid decks, too. For example, Innervate and Wild Growth embody the Druid’s unique strength, so we’ve chosen not to adjust them."*
---
Please don't mention any other cards you've *chosen not to adjust* or else they'll just be nerfed 3 years later.
---
Rofl the RNG is soo big that its alway average. Im sorry to tell but most matchup are decided by highroll aniway in HS thats why rogue is that good. Highroll master.
---
Everyone going on about end-of-turn sequencing are wrong. It's a bug.
---
This is even more evident when you have Fel Lord Betrug out and your opponent makes you draw cards on his turn. The summon copies do not die at the end of the turn even if they were summoned at the beginning of the turn.
---
I don't give up, cause if you play right you have a chance.. ofc you need luck to get them to use their board cleaners

It remembers the owner of the spell. Which is the person who cast it, and that person draws the card.
---
So Griftah actually isn't just a thie... I mean, clever businessman.
---
No, that's how it's supposed to work. Blessing lets you target any minion, and when it attacks, *you* (the player who casts the blessing, not who controls the minion) draw a card. You copied a minion with Blessing of Wisdom which your opponent played so he gets the draw
---
Just Play Mecha'thun Warrior. The only reliable OTK that came to my mind right now.
---
But it is pretty decent and you can definitely climb ranks with it + you should win every game against control Warrior.
---
You'll find the best list on www.hsreplay.net.
---
I hope you will have fun on the game again :-D
---
Decaf existed alongside all of the other DKs though. When everything is overpowered, nothing is particularly overpowered
---
Hsreplay and tempostorm are pretty good
---
Class cards are always lower mana cost though.
---
Man this went over 90% of people’s heads lmao
---
Rank 20?
---
You said that it won't beat control decks in the context of it being countered by a tech card. So you're effectively asking for a control deck of your own, with an extra win condition, that can't be countered. So what I said was a sequitur. Unless you're simply pointing out that Thun can be countered by tech. This point goes without saying, so I credited you by assuming that this wasn't what you were saying. If you were saying something other than any of these things then yeah, IDK what you were saying, making my counterpoint likely to be something of a non-sequitur.
---
Then you're wrong

**Cake#1285** (NA)

Happy to trade quests + spectate for fun! 🙂
---
… try again. There’s a joke your missing.
---
Tolin’s Goblet?
---
They had us in the first half...
---
Quite simple actually, don't care about wheather you win or lose. Might not apply to the majority of people but hell I've gotten everything that there is from winning, apart from a full collection. I just enjoy dicking around with stupid cards or combos when I have the spare time
---
garbage like this is why I rarely click the new section
---
Wait a minute, how did this happen? We're smarter than this.

Are you afraid of the dead?

rou#1705, 80g quest NA
---
Wild players HATE him! Learn how he got spellstone with this 1 simple trick!
---
Don't shuffle the first Idol ever. Summoning a Jade Golem gets a dude in play and buffs ever future golem for +1/+1. 
---
*But it's just a 1/1* a 1/1 is bigger than a 0/0 and you have to start with a 1/1 golem eventually.
---
Shuffling Jade Idols however is a 0/0 that makes your deck worse because you don't want to draw 1 mana jades in the midgame. You want to draw any ramp, draw, removal, and any other jade card over a Jade Idol almost always.
---
More travelling healers needed for this expidition :D
---
Honestly both of these subs are jerking hs, they're not different anymore 
---
Ftp, btw
---
That is true
---
I fought with your father in the great beta meme wars. He was the best shitposter in the galaxy, a cunning reposter, and a good friend.
---
If you play value game in every. Most of my reno mirrors end that way
---
I’m at Dad legend just now and really struggling to get past 5 with Token Druid
---
I too have been playing since open beta
---
how did you do it?! :)
---
comingofage#1462 NA Trading 80g quest. You go first.
---
I'm shocked none of y'all pointed out. The 2 cards don't have the same effect. One does 3 damage to the hero. The other does 3 damage split randomly to EVERYONE. They cost different because the 1 cost doesn't effect minions or the other hero. But the 2 cost does. Obviously.

I kinda chuckled at the meme, then saw the whoooshed comment section thinking I was dumb for thinking this was supposed to be a joke.
---
does she tho?
---
Are you all stupid or do you seriously think this? Fatigue is a win condition, it has been since Justicar was printed. Remove your opponents threats, get to higher health total, draw less, let them run themselves out of cards and burn them out with fatigue damage. The problem is, Elysiana (with pandas + bankers) is almost a perfect counter to fatigue. So Fatigue Warrior runs it to protect from their own fatigue and their opponents fatiguing them. And because Elysiana puts so many cards into your deck with the ability to repeat her battlecry, mirrors easily hit the turn limit. So her very existence ruins the fun of what fatigue decks and their mirror matches used to bring.
---
Ok but why are you posting this to r/hearthstone
---
What is it? I thought it was gonna be some hearthstone meme and clicked it but realised the link looked dodgey so closed immediately? Just wanna be sure I didn't get a start downloading a virus or anything 😂
---
Scrolled past this on the front page several times because I read the title and thought it was going to be another sarcastic shitpost but turns out OP was actually being genuine. 
---
Very good video from Firebat breaking down rogue and definitely worth a watch.

I just noticed she doesn't have an eye

Token Druid is just the most relevant example. There's also Resurrect Priest, Mech Hunter, and Mech Paladin to name only three more.
---
Returning player from original set days. I'm trying to build up a deck that will let me compete. I have a few I was able to create but they dont feel effective. That, or I am just not a great player. Is it more beneficial to board clear in most cases or let them get some free damage in?
---
Sap+Prep nerf, Leeroy HoF pls.
---
Mad Bomber
---
Battle Cry: deal 3 damage randomly split between all other characters.
---
Flame Imp
---
Battle Cry: deal 3 damage to your hero.
---
The flame imp hurts your team. In contrast, the Mad Bomber can help take out enemies. Not the same card.
---
Its because bombers effect can hurt your enemy.
---
eloise quit hs
---
Do you have a replay?
---
If no, did you consider that the first Kalecgos may have itself been created by say Messenger Raven?
---
Thoughtful and Fatigue warrior, pick one. They're mutually exclusive.
---
Ohh. I see I hadn’t heard from her for a while nor seen a stream so I wasn’t quite sure - same with Ratsmah to tbh.
---
Probably because stuff he does for omnislash is through a contract or something, whereas this is just whatever stuff he feels like doing. Sometimes he has other stuff posted to his channel like "bat wisdom" or whatever as well, which wouldn't fall under omnislash but just whatever he wanted to do at the time.
---
And yet the win rate is mid tier......................
---
Again, playing a deck like fatigue and then complaining you can't just afk your way to a win 30m later because a card actually interacts with your stupid fuckin deck is adorable. Reap what you sow.
---
I think evolve on an onyxia
---
They will die at the end of next turn.
---
**But how about:**
---
Sticking a Betrug. 
---
Then next turn playing plot twist and [[dalaran librarian]]. Silencing 2 of the summoned big minions so they don't die. 
---
(Also possible in 1 turn with draw minions on board) (e.g acolite/loot hoarder)
---
Read through about 30 comments. Shocked how many heads this went right over haha.

2/2/3 | Battlecry: Silence adjacent minions.  
---
None of the cards are gone you are just complaining about mana cost
---
Yes, just need to know how to play it
---
It sucks not being able to develop anything against rogue until it’s way too late. You can only watch all your stuff get killed/sapped as your opponent’s board gets bigger and you’re being hit constantly in the face. The class is just massively overpowered with too many options right now.
---
That's why they're gone
---
I mean to have all three of those cards in hand at 3 is an extremely small percentage. It would be better just to think of vancleef as an I win button if its a 6/6+ on turn 3.
---
You fuul you killed Gruul.
