2 expansions from now we will have a 1 mana 0/1 charge with gain +1 attack for every damage your hero took last turn.
---
Mercenaries 14 is really running rampant on eu. 4 patches mildly strong
---
While I agree goldshire footman doesn’t fit the second 2, but the first one seems very goldshire
---
I guess that we'll find out. I will say that I wish that the random decks had been restricted to legal constructed decks.
---
Johnny who?
---
Congrats on the new deck :)
---
I want one too!
---
Theres also mercenaries 32, which is the exact same deck as 14
---
I hadn't seen it. That's pretty good! I think the Luna one is still my favorite all time, just because of the way it captures that over-the-board feeling.
---
I was at least expecting the decks to be legal, not with 4 of a single legendary lol
---
It's so we can get the Keyforge experience without actually having to play Keyforge...
---
This is the fallacy of relative privation. There are children starving in Africa, so whatever you're complaining about is unimportant.
---
The numbers are incredibly wrong, this deck has hundreds, if not thousands of wins by now
---
Oh boy can't wait to play! I'm having flashbacks to Gadgetzan.
---
Another shit tier RNG fiesta brawl, AMAZING
---
Good luck conceding to the next non-mirror, been doing the same with 280 and have been insta-conceding to every match, 30 games now to the same 280, at this point i would love to face 14 just so I can see what demon is worse
---
gkaj#2632 looking to trade quest on EU. I'll show, you go first
---
Devilsaur is the biggest one. Now the deck rotated (old deathrattle hunter), but that change would be basically deleting that from existance. Devilsaur stops being usefull for beast recruit synergies and cube shenanigans, now is only "rush" synergies with town crier, if its ever played of course.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think changes can be done to cards, yes. But with an actual, mechanical reason, not just "lets change the effects so that they are similar to keywords". If they dont want hallazeal to stack with multiple copies because some shaman deck is actually problematic with it, then yeah, change it to lifesteal so it remains mostly the same except in that situation. But changing it because it looks like its a lifesteal effect is not a valid reason for that. In the specific case of hallazeal they already talked about this when lifesteal was added (kft) and they said this wouldnt happen, because it changes a lot the functionality of the card, and kills the creativity (like people trying to stack hallazeals for some sort of shenanigan, but with lifesteal just being a simple direct control tool without much other cool synergies).
---
Looking like I made the right decision to not preorder. Boring cards is all I see. Sorry, downvote me if you want, I'm just being honest here.
---
I got nightmare at a kid though and it made me didn't dare touching any bug for months. Those are way more scarier than the mummy soldiers.
---
I tried using apothecary, treachery mad summoner combo but warlock is kinda weak without voidcaller in wild :/
---
No worries, I got you &lt;3
---
i'm afraid the time may have already come, at least in the higher win bracket. i've insta-conceded the last 30 games and they have all been against Mercenary 280
---
Yeah, and I assumed we'd end up with some degenerate aggro deck at the top. But it's skewed in a dumb way with duplicate legendaries because of one card that is completely broken when duplicated.
---
Thank you for the gem
---
Doesn’t counterspell have a similar design. At least with this if your board is basically tokens like a lackey or token deck the effect is inconsequential.
---
I have seen it in tons of games but it says it only has 30 wins, is that because there are so many mirror matches?
---
I'm also on it. And the last 5 matches I've been in have been mirrors
---
It's about a Magic the gathering article about what do players want in a deck. Google Timmy, Johnny and Spike for it. Some players just want to win no matter what, others want to be creative with decks, and others want to win, but in a spectacular fashion. Certain cards are designed not to be good in the competitive sense, but to satisfy some of those players.
---
###I'm in- I'm in- I'm in- I'm in charrrrge now!
---
[Read this.](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2002-03-08)
---
it seems that it only displays your wins and the person's wins you initially lost to with the deck and the numbers don't change if you face a mirror
---
basically the first one will deal 30 damage, then the bird summons one, that one will deal 20 damage, next 15, then 10 then the one after that deal 5 and the last one 0 since the board is full.
---
30+20+15+10+5 is 80 so you're correct.
---
*Ready for action!*
---
This event is Hearthstones version of Cursed Blood in WoW, except eventually it’ll be all mercenaries (4 patches) 280 ATM on NA. Took 5 games to get to it and have had 5 straight mirrors since getting it!
---
Needless to say I lost. At the end of the game I discovered that my opponent’s deck had 39 wins.
---
Yeah, it was printed alongside stuff like the druid snake in ungoro in order to cheat it out. It was their idea since the beggining.
---
Other stuff like hallazeal not being lifesteal was also said to be left like that, because they want hallazeal to stack with itself (something a lifesteal hallazeal wouldnt be able to do)
---
A decent stealth card apart from lotus assassin?
---
It gets old fast. Last 4 games I've played have been Mercs 280 mirrors (US). It's "Got your turn 1 pirate rush?" Yes = opponent concede, No = you concede.
---
Looks like mercenaries 280 is the winning deck. I beat about eight of them in a row with mech paladin before finally succumbing. I am now one of them...
---
I had a priest deck that could have but I mulliganed away both of my spirit lashes. I didn’t know what the mercenary decks were until it was too late.
---
Ye, premade killed all vibe.
---
The first one I faced (and lost to, of course) had 4 Patches in it and a ship's cannon. I haven't lost yet!
---
I'm dying.
---
I beat it twise with the tempo rogue i started with, then lost to it.
---
M14 was my last 7 opponents in a row
---
I want to trade 80 Gold quest on NA, I can show it, but we play your quest first.
---
Piotrsama#1647
---
Check my history, I traded a lot of times here.
---
What other situation did he relate it to?
---
Same, took 5 matches to get it, 5 straight mirrors since.
---
Then question then becomes, "Why would you want to?"
---
&gt;Quick
---
Just play lightgorged blessing on the apothecary
---
That’s... that’s the point of the fucking brawl...
---
Yes
---
Mad summoner is faster and only needs 4 combo pieces, still bad though
---
I too find it odd that the decks allowed for multiple legendaries and more than 2 of every other rarity. think it wouldve been more interesting to see what deck came out on top under normal deck limitations
---
Its a chain of this perticular deck, i get it, tnx
---
Empower 457? I’m beating merc 280 rn with a janky spell hunter deck. Haven’t won yet but I don’t think they’re going to top deck through my 10/10 taunt.
---
Pirate warrior loop, thats pretty much it
---
If you think spamming cringe smile faces in every sentence hides your rising anger, you are sorrily mistaken.
---
Got absolutely stomped by this deck. 
---
Here is an album with some more images:

Great deck.
---
Your ELO might be too high for you to have fun. I played like 7 games in the last hour or so and didn't see anything other than varying degrees of jank garbage.
---
I didn't even think about that.
---
you mean the card is classy?
---
Averages out to the same amount of value then
---
so did everyone else
---
I just beat that with my silverhand + dragons 503. 
---
They had 30 wins I had 4.
---
Thats the one, the first time i played against it and had 4 patches pop up on the first turn was the hardest ive ever laughed in this game
---
It was on the Hearthstone discord, you can check it out there [https://discord.gg/hearthstone](https://discord.gg/hearthstone). You can probably ask a mod there or smth.
---
Played on the first hour of launch a couple games, now I'm seeing this 😭😭
---
There we go Leeroy Inner Rage Bloodsworn combo will hit face for 20 dmg lol
---
I wish the stats gave you the total number of wins that deck has received from everyone playing it. It would make it a little more interesting of a stat.
---
Enjoying Elemental Wrath 262 right now. 5-0 so far. Two Ragnaros and a Baron Geddon have been doing work.

Arena will use the cards it has. If hearthstone was exclusively packfiller junk, if you took out every card that ever made it into a meta deck, or even a fun deck, arena will be just as engaging.  It’s perfectly happy survival on scraps, thats what it’s designed to be. And that’s why you shouldn’t design cards for it.
---
Cheaper, less oppressive Rez would be very healthy for the class. A Meat Wagon rez-type, for example. Giving priest that deep, consistent control-esque value it needs to survive without being tilted towards Big. Sounds perfect, actually.
---
TL;DR these decks are worse that what I would expect to get if I went to deck maker and picked auto.
---
"You drew bad, lose your deck" the brawl.
---
Don't really like this brawl.
---
I swear the machine that makes these decks needs to be deleted "Dragons and mercs" has 2  dragons, azure drake and the 8 mana blow up the board dragon, two dragon synergy cards, taunt synergy card to buff a taunt in hand (dragon is only taunt) magnetic mech synergy (3 mechs 2/3 warper, 6 mana 4/4 blow up board for 1 and damage, and 10 mana mech that summons a copy of another minion and gives it rush. Pirate synergy with the cannon but only two pirates. Weapon synergy but one weapon.
---
Hey cool! It's Frostworld Grunt with Stonehill defender battlecry. Great card!
---
Oh good god did you create the site or something
---
Heres hoping to an awesome live stream.. Kibler isnt greatn't..  Lets hope Chis and Whalen be less nervous and it will be all good.
---
Big warrior is a pretty high variance deck, you generally either roll someone or get rolled.
---
Now they have a better stonehill. Lol as you wish
---
Is this match a tavern brawl? Or is it something else?
---
RUH ROH!
---
I got a shaman deck now with lightning storm, hagatha the witch, swampqueen, the card that gives you a 10/10/10, zola and grumble and I won against two mercenaries (didn't get to play more). Maybe just lucky maybe just better control deck. 
---
I'm pretty new to the game so I wouldn't know, any advice is appreciated!
---
well use of the competitive tag
---
I think multiple mercenaries decks with different numbers have this list.  #40 was another example that I saw on this sub.
---
I'd hate/love to watch that stack.
---
If I’m pirate warrior and I concede to a non pirate warrior deck, they just defeated me. One pirate is gone, I now have their deck.
---
I stop at 5 and then go play Arena for 3 weeks.
---
I'm considering going to Legend when Uldum starts since I have a hunch that I'll be able to get like, a 95% winrate with Aggro Shaman right when the expansion launches.
---
Given how many hundred of thousands of games of Hearthstone are played pretty much every day, it was quickly going to degenerate into the best one or two decks.
---
It was beautiful...the guy was nice though and stayed through it! Now we are friends
---
Ball of patches with a bunch of pirate warrior support cards. Ship’s cannon is as good as ever. Apart from a few cards it’s a deck building dream because of all the patches thinning out your deck to just the charges and weapons.
---
Gg ez
---
Sweeet, thank you!
---
This is a *really* inconsistent deck. I'll paste the recommended beginner Mage deck here. It's made entirely with Basic cards which every player gets for free just for starting an account and leveling the class up to ten.
---
Notice that every card included has two copies. More often than not, including a single copy of a card in a deck isn't a good idea because it reduces the consistency. This deck might looks weaker than yours because it doesn't include cards with higher potential like Power of Creation or Vex Crow, but it makes up for it with consistency.
---
I don't know what other cards you have access to that could replace some of these cards, but I'd be willing to bet that you'd have more luck with this deck than you would with the list you shared.
---
When I mentioned thinking about what you could have done differently when you lose that includes deck building. You need to try and notice when cards you draw stay in your hand not getting played or when they don't get much value when you *do* play them. You need to notice when you would wish you would have just drawn a proactive minion rather than a situational/inconsistent spell or a minion that requires some kind of setup. I believe you when you say you're very analytical, but if you're new to card game fundamentals and don't know what to look for, you can't analyze it. Meanwhile, continuing to blame your opponents cards rather than your own or your decisions will only hold you back.

I always just sit through the pain.... I wanna watch the stack come through cause how else do you learn new combos?!
---
Typing in shitty English.
---
I know right “fun”
---
I'm pretty sure it's based on order. If you pick scepter first you get the full benefit, if you pick it second your expensive minions are unlikely to be effected, (high priced minions like Giants and shirvallah should still benefit after robes)
---
I mostly used it in rogue
---
Couldn't disagree with that analogy more.
---
Don’t forget the 2 copies of ship’s cannon and 1 copy of captain. Those tend to turn the “pretty annoying board of 1/1s” into a “you literally have no chance and are dead by turn 5”.
---
Unpopular opinion: I think you’re mistaken

The squeaking. it's haunting my dreams

It's simple.

Now u just need to animate and color it
---
So eventually there will be only one deck?

Love it.
---
Not really. The combo of Barista Lynchen and Omega Agent is the key to beating Warrior because it allows you to use omega agent 4 times. Maybe Rotten Applebaum, but it doesn’t do enough late game.
---
When you want more reddit Karma but can't say anything else about the card, then it's good in Arena.

Tavern Brawl, as well as Casual, has a hidden MMR system. If you play a lot of it, you're more likely to be matched with other people who play a lot.

---
Focus on being appropriately proactive and reactive. Think about what your opponent wants to do the next turn, and then determine how you can either make their development awkward or how you can properly deal with their development. How you go about these things varies from deck to deck, so it’s important to focus on playing one deck for you to get comfortable with. It is also valuable just to know what would be the most common play for a given class on a specific turn, so you can appropriately anticipate what your opponent wants to do. Obviously this is tougher to do in Tavern Brawls and Arena, but still focusing on the main fundamentals in regards to tempo will pay off big time. Watching streamers/YouTubers can help you learn about their thought processes so that you can start to develop your own.
---
Alternatively it could just rotate all the players each turn, so every time you play some cards on a different board against a different opponent. Could be amazing honestly as it could make synergies between different classes possible.
---
“Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain.

Every piece of journalism I've ever seen written about anything that I actually had knowledge of has been horribly inaccurate. Gel-Mann amnesia all day long.

---
And the four games were Fortnite, Hearthstone, Donut County and Gorogoa. You’re not missing much, trust me on this one.
---
That's the level..
---
The idea was super cool, it's like a weird analogy to machine learning to make the perfect deck. But when i first read it i rushed to play it cause i knew that the "meta" would go stale very early on. Specially now with the longer brawl, they need to do something about it. Maybe it would be cool that every day a deck is crowned winner and it resets, and the last day it's winners decks only or something like that.

Except for the Warrior Mirrors

Similar for me. 5-0 vs mercenaries. Muster for battle is really powerful here and gives Silver Hand Pally a serious edge. This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors brawl, but ofc reddit jumps to "it's broken" within literally 2 hours after release instead of looking for the counter.
---
IMO, the best battle royale game is Corey in the House
---
Also yes, as US red tape is on the increase since 2016.
---
I can't believe I forgot that! I was also wondering how you could be fighting Rafaam!
---
I'm hoping this quest finds a home in wild as a fellow shaman battle cry enthusiast like yourself.  The best shudderwok deck right now is the sipwi one (modified by froatheb) and the quest doesn't seem to naturally fit in there.  Maybe more of a tempo build with evolve, saronite, etc alongside lackeys, elementals and other token generators.

---
Jade Druid all the way. God I played since open beta and never met more annoying deck than that shit(quest roque was close, though)
---
New tavern brawl update coming soon
---
A compromise would be 6 mana. They can keep the Khadgar + CC turn, but the main thing here is not being able to do it twice in one turn, or CC + Frost Nova on turn 6. 
---
Another good option is Grave Horror buffed to cost 11. Now CC on a giant can't give a taunt minion and aggro has a much more fair chance. Mage pretty much requires freeze effects or crazy RNG off of Cyclone itself to win at that point.
---
Not sure why but in the past the brawls that give a random deck don't let you win class quests.
---
Edit 2: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
Me (rank 20 player) facing against people with full golden legendaries deck
---
Not to mention they get a weaker board, and you can also clear them with a defile if you're low.
---
No they generate bombs to magnetize but token decks generate a wide board and have a way to buff them
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
Just do Day 1-5, skip the 6 and 7 ideas that can be a nuisance and fill up the quests log forcing you to do stuff that maybe you can't (because it's a day you can't play for 5 wins) or you don't want to do (like buying packs or an arena).
---
Or just plain 20 gold for a daily log in without incremental increase so if someone skips a day he doesn't feel an idiot breaking the streak.
---
&gt;game has jumped the shark
---
what does this even mean
---
Is there a single thread left on this sub that doesn't have a chain of comments where you three argue with eachother?
---
Annnnd i just dusted my golden star aligner for Elysiana :(
---
The effect is interesting and has super good synergy with Reborn minions like Psychopomp which will already run in most Priest deks. That said, I don’t think this card is more than decent. Sure, you can buff some small minions on turn 6 and onwards, but Priest foesn’t really have any businnes playing small minions in the first place since they have no way closing games with them (Savage Roar, Blood Lust or mass buffs).
---
You cant drop it on turn 4 since it will just trade terribly or even hinder ypu as your opponent can set it it to 1 or 2 health quite easily. 2 attack on 4 drops has historically been terrible in HS unless there is a really broken effect like Vargoth. This is not a reallly broken effect.
---
Some will make the case for Boar with Inner Fire. It’s a  5 card combo, so without Shadow Visions I think it will tried but ultimetaley deemed to unrelible. 
---
Overall cool design but it sadly won’t help Priest out of the endless pit of pain.

---
Exactly, so you both die and no one survives.
---
Not translated yet, but I’m assuming it’s a reborn card

Health copying
---
Aren't Chinese and Japanese the same symbols, but used differently?
---
How? You don’t have 4 Divine spirits
---
3 mana 5/4 + Reborn? Are you high
---
You reckon it’s a 3 mana 5/4 reborn u wot
---
Lol no a 3 mana 5/4 reborn? That dumb. He isn't done revealing the card.
---
3 mana 5/4 with a non negative effect wut??
---
Generous Mummy: Reborn
---
3 Mana 5/4 + a 5/1? Doubt it. Would be nice though
---
Are you unhappy now?
---
Overload 2
---
Ah yeah I see it, smart
---
It probably has a downside to it. This picture shows only a part of the full card text.
---
I don't read Korean but I can guess it has something to do with Star Aligner.
---
Really excited for this, Kibler is the best imo. I seem to be in the minority but I like Chris Sierra in these and I totally get why he's there. He let's the player and Peter talk about the gameplay and not have to worry about the tech, any potential issues, missed cards etc etc, it's to try and keep it smooth. Ironically the first stream was anything but smooth but the second go was much better.
---
From the art, guessing it gives the opponent coins
---
This into stonetusk + power word shield + double divine spirit  and topsy is 36 damage right? The mana cost is 4+1+1+2+2+0=10 am I missing something?
---
this card is not complete.
---
Reborn, Spells in your opponents hand cost 1 less
---
Hey buddy I think you got the wrong door. The leather club's two blocks down.
---
That looks like a bolded keyword. How negative can it be?
---
I'd imagine with how shitty the article is that asking them to comply to with GDPR is like asking me to develop a new branch of neuroscience.
---
Reborn Spells in your opponents hand cost 1 less
---
Time for Magma Rager to shine!
---
text should be a downside ... something like (Can't attack)
---
I think it is "Reborn, your opponent's cards cost (1) less."?
---
It's reborn. But a part of the text is missing yet
---
Btw this is the full version one. Translation needed tho. We know It's Reborn, but that's it.
---
Reborn. Something about your opponent's mana cost being reduced by/to (1).
---
Immaioz#2491 EU Looking to trade 80g quest. I can show, but you go first.

---
Generous Mummy (translated)
---
Reborn
---
Your opponent’s minions cost 1 less.
---
I can’t be sure but is it reborn + your opponents cards in their hands cost 1 less?
---
More than this. In his haste for karma, OP posted a half-revealed card.
---
Imagine setting up 3 card combo to get 1/7 when Druid can do it for fi... Six mana.
---
To 1 would be a way too hefty downside.
---
I think it does. It's worded just like khadgar.
---
i asked the same question but with cloning gallery cause the cardtext says "summoon" and not "play"
---

---
[deleted]
---
This card isn't for priest. It's for rogue [[Violet Haze]]
---
A complete random deck considering how cards are distributed in hearthstone is something like 1 class minion, 1 class spell and 28 neutral minions. It's just boring and the odds of randomly getting something with synergies are crazy low. You would just get matches of constant trading before someone wins on turn 20. It's a really cool experiment to do but it's not fun to play.
---
They should just reset the decks every day and maybe remove the package that won (like mercenaries now)
---
But then, you're also copying 0/2s or 1/1s that have little to no value. Unless we get some PogChamp totems soon, this will be an amazing reveal video stuck to a pretty awful card.
---

2/-/- | Add 2 random Deathrattle cards to your hand.  
---
This card is super great,  It's the quality of card that you would need to push taunt Warrior. But for real what is off with the theme of this expansion it's all over the place.
---
This guy is right. We need to up out shitposting game boys!
---
Wait this card is great. You play this guy,treachery it to your opponent. They cant kill it because reborn, and next turn you glinda +all mogu cultists to summon ra. No joke this shits tier 1
---
Infant mortality in Uldum is shockingly high compared to the rest of Azeroth, but the League of Explorers are more interested in fighting supervillains than addressing real systemic problems.
---
Very disappointing. Another IF/DS support.
---
Nah man. Its only 28 damage. Just enough to destroy a warriors armor.
---
I'll do you better:
---
WHERE is this?
---
hearthstone is a battle-royale games honored by Apply????  
---
am not sure if even the grammar is correct in that sentence.
---
Kerbal space program but with murlocs instead of kerbals
---
PepeLaugh
---
Would Reborn or Deathrattle resolve first? Because if the Reborn minion was summoned before the Deathrattle triggered then it could buff itself
---
First keyword is reborn and secend is deathrattle, so this minion can probably buff itself. Anybody knows how this card will work with Psychopomp, Can you have two reborns on minion?
---
This is hilarious, lol.
---
I imagine whoever had the wraps before commanded a massive army of mummies to fight for them, and then Finley finds it and is like "Well now this mummy needs some kids, and a husband, and hey let's throw in a grandmummy!"
---
Pretty sure the closest thing to a reset is going to be the weekend.
---
No
---
Could test giving the neutral minion with the same deathrattle the Paladin resummon effect and see what happens. Of course, it's not guaranteed the interaction will work exactly the same when it comes to the "Reborn" keyword.
---
If they haven't scrapped mind blast; ignore shadow priest and heal / damage duality, there could be sth else. But as it is now, priest really has nothing other than inner fire and death rattle.
---
This is cheese
---
you could be send to the shadow realm
---
you mean 3/4
---
There is some kind of zoo priest floating around. I know this card would fit in there
---
It is a lot of stats but it commits the cardinal sin of aggro,getting outtempo'd. Your opponent can vomit all their hand thanks to this card and you'll be easily overwhelmed.
---
So chess is basically a battle royal game? And UNO? Monopoly?
---
2nd boar is better then pws.
---
And you can plague the turn before.
---
I got a deathrattle priest deck that's been slaying for me so far even managed to beat a few mercenary 280s
---
8-8 reborn would be nuts. Its effect could be at the end of your turn take 15 damage and it'd be playable.
---
Decks are random with certain parameters probably. I'm sure they didn't expect one to have 4 Patches.
---
If you're planning to stall that much, why not just play nomi priest at that point? I'm sure it's more viable than this
---
Let's hope we don't get a good 1 drop otherwise I can already see a Bwonsamdi package with cleric and boar.
---
Boar should be HOFed
---
The wisp value!
---
Or just cut the boar and Amet to play a Stormwind Knight and a PW: Shield?
---
Do you feel creative for adapting a combo existing since 5 years, making it worse?
---
High Priest Amet on its own is a sweet card. I love the idea and it could make all kinds of cool decks happen. They just need to remove the Boar from the basic set and these kinds of dumb combos will never happen
---
Let us do our part and report this user to the Mods so they can ban this user!👍
---
yea if undatakah gets a summon minion DR then a buff DR it can buff the summoned minion -- the order the DRs are attached seems to matter
---
You do realize Priest can already OTK you with Leeroy, Topsy Turvy, Power Word Shield, Divine Spirit, Divine Spirit, Topsy Turvy, yes?
---
Amet is jacked
---
:)
---
Lol
---
This could be what Priest needs to get a death rattle zoo-Ish deck going.
---
I find divine spirt decks fun. One my favorite decks of all time was dragon combo priest. So maybe not every card that supports it needs to be flamed.
---
I don't see how is this hard to pull of, take as example nomi priest and it's card draw potential, sometimes you can empty your deck by turn 7 if you draw well.
---
Yeah it's one of those games where the object is to win, you know like fortnite
---
Boar is going to wild soon...
---
It's usually a meme to say this, but you should've played around it. Usually the Hyena can't get very big. It gets 1 or 2 buffs before it gets removed. I've only been snowballed by in a handful of times and have only snowballed other people a handful of times. I've dealt with big Edwin's waaaaay more than big Hyenas.
---
Stupidity is not against the sub rules, lets not waste the Mods time.
---
Yea if you draw well. It’s still a 5 card combo. There is a lot that can go wrong.
---
Priest can already OTK you from full with leeroy Jenkins and another Topsy Turvy doing this combo+ power Word Shield.
---
Boar isn’t a problem. Forcing Priest to rely on Divine Spirit/Inner Fire until the end of time is.
---
*Handbuff Warrior heavy breathing*
---
After I started getting the Warrior mirrors, I wondered how far this was going to go. Finally I got sleepy and went to bed :P
---
It is absolutely awesome, nice job man
---
OH MY GOD IT'S A 10 MANA 6 CARD COMBO THAT CAN'T GET THROUGH TAUNT
---
Now this is how you Reborn a minion
---
So besides the DS/IF combos which aren't fun,
---
He looks like he might have a chance to see play? His effect is essentially a +6 health buff for 1 HP minions. He can make things a lot stickier than they'd normally be. Amet + Cleric even. Someone mentioned Sand Drudge. I'm looking forward to trying him out.
---
You could also tempo amet on 4 then boar plus double divine spirit topsy on 5 for exactly 30 damage...if amet gets damaged on 4 you could always circle of healing.
---
I think you're reading too much into it.
---
Sry Guys, I really tried to explain Grandpa what's a 'Hearthstone' xD
---
But it does not work like that. "Summon Minion" is not the same as "play minion". This will work, for example, with Gigling Inventor.
---
*shrugs*  They're saying it shouldn't be the core to ALL priest decks, not that it shouldn't the core to any.
---
Yeahhhh always feels great when you pull off a 56 damage combo and they live and just execute it lmao
---
People complain when Priest resurrects minions, uses burn to kill their opponents, uses stolen cards, and now they want to remove the last combo that’s actually potentially viable for them on ladder.
---
Divine Spirit should be have ended being Hall of Famed instead of Mind Blast, Mind Blast can be played on it's own so does Inner fire, but Divine spirit always has to rely on Inner Fire or Topsy Turvy.
---
Why would you post this now and here?
---
That's a very harsh evaluation.  It's dependent on whether it can buff it's own token.  If it can, then it's playable as a 1/2 death rattle summon a damaged 3 heath 2/2 with a +1/+/1 buff death rattle.  That's not bad.
---
Especially since paladin didn't have any class specific reborn cards revealed yet, and making mummies would work great with the new grandmummy revealed. Also the flavor is obviously more priest. I guess it would be too strong in priest or something?
---
Judging by the action bar OP has pretty good board control with a Sea Giant coming up against an empty board so it might've gone a little better at least. Two King Muklas are decent at least, don't you think?
---
Jokes aside I was really disappointed with Slay the Spire, it ended up being a lot easier to beat than I expected
---
Don't body shame! /s
---
Summoned refers to a minion entering the board so played minions also count
---
Not that much with the Priest's draw engines. And it is a 6 card combo which will make it harder to chain spells if you go Gadgetzan route because you will draw these cards instead of other cheap spells(Nomi was a 3 card package).
---
Mukla at 2 mana? Don't think so.
---
Yep! Arena wins already count towards a golden hero 😁
---
Ah I haven't got it yet. What's your battletag?
---
no it doesn't, it includes all wins back to the original mercenary 280, but only those that make a direct path to this game. You carry the win total from the opponent who defeats you.
---
Think of it as a tree branch. It's your branch yo the roots, but not the entire tree.
---
because taking 26dmg on a single 'combo' turn in a game where you cant react is dumb
---
Mohmmd#1738
---
I’m glad to see experienced Hearthstone players spreading the truth about the game. I can tell there was a lot of research and care put into the article.
---
Mercenaries 14 has 4 patches, 1 ship's cannon,  1 southsea captain,  1 southsea deckhand, 1 ticket scalper, 1 salty seadog, 1 greenskin, 2 skycap'n kraggs, and 2 bloodsail cultists, and 1 n'zoth's first mate.  Also 2 additional weapons so idk
---
It's called Easter Eggs.
---
Nice
---
See, I think Priest is only bad because they have access to only one quality AOE. Fix that problem and many more Priest decks become more viable.
---
The problem is that mercenaries is so overwhelmingly dominate now that if you were to lose because of a bad opening hand/ draws your pretty good deck will just die off. This happened to the druid deck I was playing.
---
Tavern brawl
---
Strange, so it’s a tiny bit different, mercenary 280 has 2 ship’s cannon 
---
But it’s basically the same ;)
---
I would prefer totally random, but follows deck building rules. Then, after the brawl someone could build the winning deck and actually use it on the ladder.
---
How to you beat patches? Even more copies of patches
---
Pathra wins because she convinced Zalae to sing.
---
I suppose there's nothing explicitly setting it in stone, but it seems like they're trying to tell a cohesive story through class-based factions this year. Even the Armegadillo looks to be the product of Dr. Boom's handiwork.
---
Allowing heroes and villains to occupy the same deck would run contrary to this theme, so I'd be surprised if they abandoned that trend halfway in.
---
Hello friend! There seems to be some misunderstanding here.
---
&gt;normal people can Accept a different opinion without getting aggressive and insultive
---
Their posts are accepted by no one. They all don't just get 0 votes for no reason. If you read through that comment section you'd find EVERYONE dislikes the post. There's one guy who even said "Just stop, you're making people who makes good nerfs look bad", ans got many upvotes (and a pseudo-gold).
---
&gt;A Post is not bad because you disagree
---
I'm not the only one who disagree. Literally everyone disagrees with all their posts.
---
So, it's safe to say no one is happy with their low-quality posts and they are the one at the wrong.
---
Less cancer
---
Thank you for the answer!
---
It only summons beasts
---
You get infinite Soulwardens and Gul'dans, since they will be your only cards that were discarded during the game. Having infinite Gul'dans is pretty good, I guess.
---
Yeah I think you are right. I was thinking how even a 49-51 would snowball into the 51 wiping out the 49. A perfect 50-50 would still snowball off some draw luck variance
---
It may have 2, hard to tell if a game lasts 5 turns before somebody concedes
---
The only way I could see this happening at this point is if the people that are willing to fight back team up and get 1 player with a good counter deck (I hear spell rouge is good).  Then just all add each other and friendly duel and concede to transfer the deck around and try to win in matchmaking to spread it.  If you lose then friendly again to get it back and continue.
---
Alright I've sent the request now
---
Every once in a while a blind squirrel finds a nut... so your RNG deck beat another OP RNG deck... how consistently does it beat it though... and was the person you beat any good at playing the game?   I hate all this randomness as you can't evaluate your skills or the quality of your deck.  Too many factors outside of our control goes into whether we win or lose.   I am glad you had a positive outcome.   Later on today could you update us on how well that dick was performing against pirate warrior?  I am curious!  Well done on your win.
---
Did u just do this to me
---
Tbh, I could see the boar getting HOFed eventually.
---
Probably! I have that habit. It's a fun way to kill time between reveals, though.
---
Looks great dude
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah i was just talking about the statline more than anything. Anothdr thought is if you dont have a silence you can still attack unlike the watchers
---
Played 10 games so far, only lost one to conjurer mage. Love Omega Agent + Lynchen, such a cool combo. Great deck dude, having tons of fun playing it!
---
"At the end of your turn, destroy another random minion and restore Health to your hero equal to its Health."
---
The dude who posted it was probably just expressing his opinion: even though it may go against the vast majority. Downvoting exists to let down
---
So now the only question is how do you give this to your opponent
---
No, people hate Rez priest because it involves a huge amount of mana cheating and requiring to kill the same minion over and over again. It would be less bullshit if Hearthstone had an actual graveyard mechanic, but it doesn't so it's very much bullshit.
---
Anyone know how to decipher this boomer talk?
---
I understand the 11 mana issue, I was just stating that “3 card combo” part is pretty easy when it’s really a 2 card combo and 1 of 15-20 other cards.
---
I think the biggest problem is that the majority of the generated decks seem to mix a couple of different buckets, but these Mercenaries got lucky and put 100% into pirates.
---
It's very possible/plausible for a warrior to get Amet from Boom's delivery drone. The most unlikely part is probably a warrior actually playing protect the king.
---
This + power word shield + 2 divine spirit + boar + inner fire = OTK
---
Gorgeous!!
---
Wrote by a ten times legendary rank player. The war on the ranking ladder is ugly.
---
Yeah. Gotta wonder how many potentially better versions of mercenary’s lost to a bad match up out of nowhere.
---
Ah, explains why I got a "big priest" deck with that vanilla 10/10 and the 2/2 deathrattle add a coin along with some rez mechanics.
---
Prepare to face Millhouse mummystorm
---
o/
---
I feel like this could be a cool combo in priest since priest has [[Bwonsamdi, the Dead]] and priest can also [[Vivid Nightmare]] to copy your Ra for 40 dmg.

I checked the priest leggo, the muzzle is smooth enough to pass for organic but imho he's wearing a mask because 1) the snout is black while the rest of the fur is orange/cream 2) it has a very fixed expression while the pose is very dynamic, it looks like he's casting a spell and I would have depicted it shouting.

To make at all effective own decks that can stand their, you need a very good understanding of game concepts and the meta. As a new player you just don't have either, so it's not viable.
---
I'd suggest playing some with meta decks to gain a better feel of core game concepts and what you'll be up against with your own deck before venturing down that road.
---
It's possible to make playable decks of your own and climb with them to r5. But it takes dedication, trial and error, a decent collection and understanding of the game.
---
This doesn’t seem like the right use of yeet, but I don’t know enough about youth culture to dispute it.
---
Nethersoul Buster is not in the meta, but it's certainly playable.

---
How do resurrection mechanics work with reborn? Like if I've had this minion die, get reborn, and die again, and then play a resurrection effect, do I have a 50% chance to get a mummy with a Reborn tag and a 50% chance to get one without?

Is she related to Milhouse Manastorm?
---
Definitely 2 Salty Seadogs, the 6 mana 'summon a minion with cost equal to armor' spell, at least a single Warpath, at least a single Inner Rage, Shield Slam, Fiery Waraxe... and not sure about the rest.
---
This card reeks of custom hearthstone
---
I threw you a silver, maybe that will help a bit.
---
and it would usually be using another board clear like whirlwind or warpath before using this card, so it would be like playing 2 board clears for the same effect.  Brawl seems far superior. This could be good against summoner mages, but not seeing much else where it could have a payoff to equal the cost
---
It slots right into control warrior. Even Dynomatic + this works well.
---
i mean its completely in the shadows since its a ceiling
---
MAKE THE WARRIOR BOARD CLEARS STOP WHY GOD WHY
---
It also costs half the mana
---
Petition to change the name to **Mosh Pit**.
---
I seen 280 at 5 wins... I knew it was broken as fuck when turn 1 he played 4 patches.
---
Yeah agreed.
---
Divine Shield is worth about 1-mana, and I suspect reborn is about 1-mana too (give or take). So essentially this is a 12-mana card for 10, with the downside that you can only have 1 in your deck.
---
That is why it is of outmost important to act now before we are overrun with them!
---
I see lots of people excited for the new cards because of their viability in wild, but What about standard?
---
Building working unique decks isn't impossible like these comments suggest, but it's really hard. You somehow need to come up with an idea that matches that of those who play this game on a professional basis and beat an enormous amount of resources everyone has access to. It's not realistic for a new player. Hearthstone simply has an audience that is too large and too experienced to outbuild.
---
Dusting for one class isn't necessary. Finding three classes or so you don't like seems like a safer way to go.
---
Wow thanks, that's my first :)
---
r/Woooosh
---
It was a self demonstrating comment.
---
I think it looks pretty cool actually
---
Blizzard has been designing very interesting neutral legendaries for the past 2 expansions, I thought the trend was gonna continue but then I saw this card.
---
Just can’t believe it’s a legendary.
---
Found the Pokémon player
---
It's all random. So not even much of an ai tbh.
---
I've won every game vs Mercenaries 280 with Inspired 755
---
This was a fun questline in WoW Uldum. Needless to say we’ll be seeing a Colossus of the Sun too
---
feels more like Mario Kart
---
This effect is actually more boring than the boogiemonster. There is no reason for this to be a legendary. What could a deck possibly gain for being able to run two of these rather than only one? This will feel so bad to open in a pack.
---
I don't think silence would remove "asleep", otherwise they would have gone with "frozen".

Brawl can be a coin flip if there's a big body on the board, but it requires no activator.
---
That's something that can't be said for this card. This requires some way to activate it.
---
And there currently isn't any good way in Standard aside from Dr. Boom's hero power to hit/zap a target. Something like Ravaging Ghoul's would make this extremely potent.
---
Every set needs its [[Icehowl]]...
---
even though Icehowl is slightly better...
---
Mrglr, motherfucker.
---
Remember when Warrior had to use 2 cards to destroy something? But now with [[Omega Devastator]], [[Dyn-o-matic]] and [[Supercolldier]] it doesn't apply anymore? This card is reintroducing this theme.
---
So that 4-mana cost is scaring the be-jesus out of me
---
This kind of mentality is how the power level of hearthstone got fucked in the past
---
This set is combatting the failures of the past. You should love it.
---
man i know fishes is a real word but it sound kinda weird
---
Coin flip my ass, that shit was 100% and they knew it.
---
To cut it out of Arena?
---
Maybe not as good as brawl or warpath but this is versatile. This plus warpath or boom hero power is a 7 mana boardclear. After your opponent value trades and goes wide this gets the board back. In a pinch its a 5 mana execute. 
---
Question is if warrior actually needs more lategame  board clears.
---
BE is a good reason to make the push!

Merc 280 is the NA version of merc 18.
---
Should’ve had Bolderfist Oger stats smh
---
This card is horrible
---
When is Conjurer’s Calling going to get nerfed? It’s so insanely broken.
---
How hard does the removal have to be? You have to pop the divine shield, kill it, pop the divine shield again and kill it again. Even a turn 10 Omega Devastator can't kill it without help.
---
Hey, could you stop making the same comment every time someone posts something like this? It's really annoying and 0% helpful or interesting.
---
I know its a bit basic but its a strong as fuck minion and we see bad legendaries all the time, I'm ok this is the bad one of the set.
---
To be fair, that's more of a problem with Big Priest and mana cheating  than the design of the card. This is totally fair at 10 Mana...just not 4.
---
Your comment made me just now realize the relation between reborn and twinspell
---
You did it wrong, you had to leave it open at 11-0 
---
/s
---
Can hardly wait to pull this in packs instead of a reasonably useful rare.
---
You need to combine this with whirlwind effect or use and sacrifice your own minions, I'm not sure if this will see a lot of play. Sure, historically 2 mana board clears like Doomsayer Frost Nova or Pyro Equality were good enough, but this will cost 6 mana or 7 with warpath. Warrior decks are already stacked with removal and will do just fine without it.
---
Should be "Battlecry: Gain Reborn", that way it wouldn't have Reborn when pulled from a random effect, but would still be a 10/10 Divine Shield. When Cyclone Mage gets two of these from a Giant, that's gonna be pretty unfun.
---
idk if blizzard fixed it or something, but i was playing Mercenaries 14 and conceded to another random deck, and never seen it played by my opponents for past hour or so.. finally having fun in brawl
---
Yeah I know haha funny meme and such, but like, that card has been degenerate for far too long. Make priest basic/classic actually playable, maybe buff some of those god-awful cards, but please, please remove that one.
---
its not casue arena, arenas operates with buckets so this would be ina  high bucket .
---
I'm surprised they don't put her in front of a camera more often. She's good at that.
---
DM me when you post after reveal season and I’ll gild the post straight away.
---
Well Played.
---
New mechanic: play and pray.
---
 she has that sick deep voice, really cool, gives her a lot of personality!
---
Swarming 18 reporting in. Converted a Merc 280 for you.
---
The deck doesn't need more removal. It already doesn't run all of its good, available removal. Board clears aren't in short supply.
---
[[Hex]], [[Polymorph]], [[Tinkmaster Overspark]], [[Ironbeak Owl]] + Any Removal Spell. It seems extremely weak to jam on Turn 10.
---
I agree somewhat that giants have always been an issue and always seeing giants every expansion is stale however most classes have the tools to deal with one currently actually all of them do except maybe mage. Even druid is capable of dealing with one and they don't have naturalize anymore. When your opponent is doing nothing for at least 3 turns to prep for giant you have a lot of time to either: 
---
A) Find a spell that can deal with them 
---
B) Put enough minion pressure on board to clear the giant
---
C) A combination of both
---
I am convinced the hs team has no idea how to play this game at this point
---
same reason glass knight is legendary or tyrantus i guess?

3/2/1 Beast | Battlecry: Silence a minion.  
---
Yuuup. Always these legendaries for me.
---
Big ~~dicks~~ decks are coming.
---
Yeah. This card is not as cool as the card Gruul.
---
You're gonna put 15-20 zero mana minions in your deck?
---
Creative Commons, Carbon Copy, Comedy Central, Cottage Cheese.
---
Mosh King came with a 9/7 body as a bonus, because it costs 9 mana. Cataclysm discards your hand. Plague of Wrath isn't strong card, but comparing it to those two is wrong.
---
I don't think this card is particularly potent, but Warrior can easily have some tokens on board to trade in. It's basically mass Execute. This adds some redundancy, as running activators becomes more worthwhile.
---
Huh, you have a list? I was running one leaning into magnetic and I always felt like I would just run out of cards if I couldn’t draw my burst fast enough.
---
It's basically a 10 mana giant beatstick that takes a lot of health damage to really take down and at least 4 different hits. Unless you have transformation effect or silence + removal this thing is really hard to get rid of. That said I don't see this seeing play since it's basically just a beatstick that's hard to remove and does nothing instantly.
---
This is one of two colossi protecting the keys two unlock a chest that contains the Scepter of Orsis, a powerful artifact that Al'Akir wanted to steal from the land of the titans.
---
I hope we get to see his twin brother Colossus of the Sun as well!
---
I really like this card. I know its shit. But its the kind of dumb power I like to play around with. Back when [[Icehowl]] came out I put it in a lot of my decks and I think it will be very similar for this card.
---
Not all cards need to be viable and run in all the meta decks. Some cards just need to spark inspiration or fill a fantasy. To me this is a card that does both.
---
You don't think six mana, kill errbody is going to see play? (Well...unless they have divine shield)
---
Sorry, reliable win condition. Priest can already hit for a lethal OTK with Stormwind Knight or Leeroy Jenkins. The problem is that it’s weak to taunts, which this new combo does nothing to solve, and also requires saving cards like Topsy Turvy or Power Word Shield you would otherwise be using for the Wild Pyromancer/Acolyte of Pain/Northshire Cleric draw engine.
---
1 Mana 1/1 Reborn Divine Shield confirmed.
---
Im not quite sure...the only thing i have for standard is zerek cloak and thats premade decks
---
Every zero sum game confirmed BR
---
Defile and Psychic Scream weren’t Warrior cards. Neither were pre-nerf Blade Flurry or Savagery.
---
1 and 8/9 months.
---
This rotates with the first set of 2021 (Probably in April).
---
There's a constant stream of decks as new players try the tavern brawl. Not everyone plays it day 1. Granted, by the end of the week, that will be only a small trickle, but I'd bet there's still a good number or new decks appearing.
---
Hell, I played the brawl only after reading the merc 280 memes.
---
It's only weak to tranform effects. It might get weird to deal with by classes other than Mage and Shaman.
---
14 definitely has 2 ship's cannons
---
Nothing is as cuul as Gruul.
---
Triple duskfallen aviana &lt;3
---
LUCKERRR!
---
This is hilarious! I love this. Average of six damage every two turns off it lives, definitely has a place in self-silencing decks, especially in wild.
---
Now you have to hope that the 8 people you converted can spread the gospel of taunts further. Wish your progeny well.
---
As soon as everyone stops posting the same picture with same comment I will. Deal?
---
They really should hall of fame brawl.
---
Insanely bad?
---
Seeing people saying this card is good is blowing my mind. Like have you literally ever played the game of Hearthstone?
---
Incredibly strong card in a vacuum.
---
If paladin got this it would be bonkers.  Just hard to see tempo priest being a thing.
---
I’m betting it’s probably a mech. The flavor of the card implies mechs.
---
Great work! Initial impressions:
---
Pros:
---
+Deck tracker looks solid
---
+Open Source
---
+++Replay feature looks really nice
---
Cons:
---
-HDT is a thing that exist, and has much more functionality
---
------Overwolf
---
lets play some battle royale solitair
---
HELLO! HELLO!
---
We Pokemon TCG now lads
---
I thought this was rogue when I first saw it and thought that was cool.
---
I have been playing a fun and goofy mech minion mage that rolls Arugal and Jan'alai. I think 80% of the cards in my deck catch people off guard.
---
I have the Chinese reading ability approximately equivalent to a second grader so I like trying to decipher these cards before looking at the translation.
---
I actually guessed right even though the only words I recognized were your opponent, 1, and few/less.
---
They're waiting to announce details so they don't overshadow the set itself.
---
I've been thinking about this for a while, but I'm pretty sure that, given two different cards, it's always possible to build two game states where having one wins you the game and vice versa.
---
I'd be comfortable with that, honestly. Brawl RNG is one of my least favorite things about the class.
---
Duel Paladin got so much better and it was already kinda fun.
---
No, it was not a tempo deck. It was all built around the quest and getting it done. Did it even run any minions above 3 mana?
---
wait, if you give it rush is it essentially immune to falling asleep? That would make it actually decent with all the lackeys being played
---
Yep, I don't think competing with HDT on the feature level would be a wise thing anyway. I need to find a way to differentiate what I'm doing.
---
And I'm curious about the Overwolf thing. Why is it so much of a turn off for you?
---
Unless there's some unusual support, we'll probably have to return to this after rotation. I don't see any reason to run this as long as the Boom hero remains.
---
wrenchcalibur is good but not for tempo
---
Let's hall of fame all evergreen cards that see play.
---
I thought it was common when I first looked at it. Kind of boring for a legendary card.
---
This thing looks like it fucks
---
Yeah, going to be a blast making decks with it in mind.
---
Why is that more difficult? Wouldn't the odds be identical?
---
I think it'll depend on how many AOEs is too many. Imho, i think that 4 is the perfect number and unfortunately, i think this one is the weakest out of Warpath and Brawl.
---
It takes at least 4 damage sources to remove that’s more powerful than most give credit for.
---
Doesn't this count as "interesting"? It's unlike anything that gets printed these days. And I honestly like it. Not every single legendary has to have the craziest effect in the world. Yeah, this probably won't be played in most decks but in some specific archetypes (like mana cheating stuff) I think it can be very powerful, perhaps too powerful to have two copies of it.
---
Been doing this. Haven't played with merc 280 once, always concede!
---
That's now the **5th** legendary featuring Dr Boom lol
---
Nope, no deal. Just stop being a dick. This isn't a bargaining session.
---
Not sure it's good enough, but I welcome anything that tries to push warriors away from control.
---
Lmao are you serious?
---
All your mechs also get rush. You run a ton of mechs anyway and omega assembly 
---
What weapons are warriors running in standard besides wrench and supercollider? There aren’t any really worth running. Quests in a tempo warrior is never gonna work cause you don’t want to quest on turn 1.
---
The synergy between boom and the other cards is far better. You already wanna run cards like dynomatic and zilliax and omega devastator. Boom makes them that much better.
---
Some vanilla 4/3s that don’t do anything the turn they come out aren’t better than what Dr. Boom does and provides.
---
That fake dual-wielding spoiler for KoFT.
---
Unironically too slow for big priests
---
I am so glad that this card doesn't have taunt.
---
&gt; Dr. Boom is **just** better.
---
Very naive and shortsighted thing to say.
---
10 mana 10/10 taunt reborn?
---
&gt; Legendaries would mean we’d all only ever lose to sea giant &gt; conjurer’s calling &gt; colossus of the moon maybe once and it’d be a story worth telling.
---
Colossus of the moon generally really isn't what you lose to in this scenario
---
OOTL what does reborn do?
---
In Priest though, who's more susceptible to getting free trading and falling behind on board than other classes. 
---
I agree it's still pretty powerful, but not the same as looking at it in a vacuum.
---
As mentioned before they had to change the effect last minute due to balancing issues so the flavor was off. On top of that, they've mentioned they don't want to give rogue board clear which may have affected the design to shy away from this.
---
Well, it does kill every other non-adventure minion in the game in a 1v1 brawl. So there's that.
---
Pokemon masters* lads
---
does reborn count as a summon?
---
Warpath doesn't clear a Conjurers board, and Brawl leaves something to be Conjured the next turn.
---
Or you can edit the above to apply to big priest or Mechs. 
---
Hell, you can Warpath &gt; Plague &gt; Warpath on 9 or 10 to clear Reborn minions.
---
Take a look at the card again.
---
It is just a 4 mana 6/5 if your opponent is sir annoyotron
---
This is really good with rastakhan epic weapon. I was saving them for ages!!
---
You know Dr Boom is a one-of right? And that consistency is important right? If the Ctrl warrior's primary way of winning is by playing Dr boom, then they lose every game where they don't draw him or where the aggro/tempo weapon warrior gets an aggressive start. Stop acting like ctrl warrior is this unbeatable force that always has the perfect hand.
---
I mean sounds like a plan to me. I don't think there should be a classic set to begin with, although that would bring about its own complications with new players etc.
---
Remember, u/ovahzealousy, we are players. Vengeance cannot be a part of what we must do. If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the Mercenaries 280s.
---
Silence priest already has access to Chillwind Yeti. Same health, and it silences itself!
---
He literally said that this is a return to needing 2 cards for a clear.
---
2x Omega Devastator with Rush is also a pretty good board clear.
---
Yeah man! He totally did! Wow! I cant believe how reckless he is! After this Im 100% sure Blizzard wont give him another card to reveal
---
Jade Golem, War Golem, Arcane Golem, and Iron Golem aren't mechs. I very much doubt this 4/3 is a mech. The golems that are mechs are usually very obviously mechanical from their art.
---
Cards just keep getting more ridiculous
---
If I open it, it's going into duel pally. If I don't open it, I'm happy.
---
This actually doesn't seem like a meme combo...
---
is this true? If it is i need to know - it's important.
---
Exactly. Gaining FL Jaina's hero power in dungeon run doesn't confer the lifesteal.
---
game significantly slowed down from the ages of "if you play quest on turn one, you suffer from an irrecoverable tempo loss". I think playing this into just playing a lot of weapons and hitting face should be an okay strategy. Plus its not like hunter quest that forced you to play one drops, you get to play good weapons like arcanite reaper you'd play anyway if you wanted to play aggro anyway. Though this cards viability will be highly dependant on the amount of aggro cards warrior will have access to on the rotation.
---
It's not an unbeatable force that always has the perfect hand, but it's definitely going to be better than this weird "Weapon Tempo Warrior" that you somehow think is going to be a tier 1 deck
---
I really like this set’s theme of Egypt/mummies/desert.
---
Yeah but aren't there better options for Priest to silence?
---
I really like the power level of the new quests. The first ones were basically win conditions (some good, some bad) that really dictated how you built your deck and how you wanted the game to play out. The new quests are more interesting as deck building tools.
---
If I'm building the deck today, I'm just going to run 2x Whip, 2x Wrench and 1 Sulth'raze. Then I'm going to sprinkle in a bunch of Enrage enablers (topping out with Grom), chargers and the bomb package (Dr. Boom, Goblins, Hero Card).
---
Seems fine to me. Card draw will be a bit of an issue as Battle Rage is pretty inconsistent .
---
The big downside is that you have to silence it the turn you play it, which is not what silence priest wants to do. It's better to silence a minion the turn it can attack, since you can keep your silence if your opponent removes your overstatted minion on their turn. 
---
Silence priest also needs better stats than this. Silence priest already doesn't run \[\[Soldier of Fortune\]\], which has a better stat distribution, does not need to be silenced to attack, and doesn't need to be silenced the turn it's played.
---
It also has 2 Skycap'n Kragg... TWO! Fuck this deck...
---
Not like Big priest does. Without an exile mechanic there is no counter
---
just realized that the knife jugglers will kill the mummy. adding deathspeaker fixes that but makes it a turn 9 -&gt; 10 combo instead of a 7-&gt; 8 combo and 7 cards :(
---
https://i.imgur.com/DMhfkjg.png
---
It's randomly generated from a pool of possible "mercenaries" themed cards
---
Tbf you don't need to play this turn 1. Just any time before you start attacking ideally
---
could be Titan machinery he's hacking which makes non-mech golems.

4/5/6 Elemental | Whenever this minion attacks, give your opponent a Coin.  
---
Curious, any off-meta Mage decks you're playing? It's my favorite class in this game but I don't usually go for top meta decks and I'm not a big fan of the cyclone deck or the CC giants deck
---
The issue is that ya don't want to play a quest in a tempo deck. For example murloc Shaman in wild doesn't play the murloc quest despite being able to easily complete it, due to it being too slow. 
---
Since N'zoth's is played exclusively in pirate warrior I don't see it making the cut. 
---
However, I do hope I'm wrong though.
---
This is why patches got nerfed
---
Rush can attack face ?
---
Like if it's asleep you can wake it up with rush ?
---
Thanks, I will check those out.
---
How do you know ?
---
Precisely what I was saying. This card isn't going to be the worst legendary of the set, it's not as utterly bad as people are making it out to be.
---
If it doesn’t do something the turn it’s summoned, it’s not op in Rez priest
---
Not really
---
Who needs mana when you can get some energy cards.
---
Holy crap! Somebody totally called that effect on a different post. Wish I would have saved it now.
---
The second brawl just recycled the first one and the third one fell below expectations. However it’s true that these tavern brawls incentivized to play more. Paired with the rewards these brawls were the right move as this is the last month before expansion and ladder feels really boring.
---
I thought ogre and oger was a joke cause oger is like the way some fantasy games say it, and like the german way of saying it, too.
---
Actually insane? I mean as far as vanilla stat sticks to beat your opponent to death with this is king
---
Conceding a mirror should give you a new deck
---
This screams "great arena card" to me
---
Most of the golems in HS, including those related to metal like ironwood golem and iron golem, are typically not listed as mechs. Jade is a type of stone too. Golem seems to be a word the HS devs throw around whenever the card is an animated construct. 
---
As someone else pointed out, the golem generated by this hero power is a stone golem with no keyword.
---
The problem is also that as far as i can tell it matches your first few matches against other players who haven't won yet.  New players with new decks don't get a chance to face 280 decks untill they've won a match with the deck they have.  Their deck may have a "win" count that makes it look like they've won before, but it's just inhereted from the person they just lost to, and so on down the line.  So any deck that is good vs merc 280 but garbo against most other decks will probably just get weeded out before it has the chance.
---
What is Anraphet's Core ? 
---
No picture ?
---
😢😢😢
---
Is that Ancient Watcher’s dad
---
I think so. There’s more tempo threats they can use. You silence and duplicate this boy and it would be a solid tempo play. Obvi the 5/6 and the silent watcher are the ideal targets, but having multiple targets is never a bad thing.
---
I really wish someone would post a write up of the Uldum lore that we're seeing in these cards. As someone who didn't play wow, there are a lot of names that I do not know, and it would be nice to know a little bit more about all of them and how they relate.
---
You're welcome!
---
Happy cake day
---
That's such a strange sentence, but it's totally true.
---
yea, quad patches is pretty game breaking lol.
---
Except it doesn't and is going to be basically an auto include especially once Dr Boom cycles out.
---
The biggest thing it does is get rid of Reborn minions. However it also lets you pop big shit without necessarily annihilating your own board.
---
Execute is auto include in most war decks and this is effectively multi target execute. If you can kill at least 3 then it is already better than Execute. And you can, at least to some extent, control the targets and not leave yourself defenseless as Brawl does
---
Yeah and I think, especially for the first few weeks of testing this new week long tavern brawl they probably wanted to do it with something that would keep people playing. I mean look, even if the one was a rehash I still found myself playing the whole week
---
I’m pretty sure (though open to being wrong) that this isn’t good in standard.  The effect isn’t as good as Boom in a control deck, and I don’t think agro Warrior is strong enough in standard.
---
That said, I think this may be good in wild, specifically in Pirate Warrior.  It makes for a decent turn 2 drop along side a 1 mana pirate, after you have used your turn 1 equipping a rusty hook, where you seek to just buff the hook twice and using the upgraded hero power to win if pirates don’t get the job done.
---
Sea Giant AND Kalecgos. Don't forget about that one possible outcome that a Mage in arena might get a Kalecgos and discover Conjurer's.
---
Doing my part with a Damaged 122 warrior. Whirlwind and Death's bite for AOE and stopping the cannons/patches. Zilliax, Vicious Scraphound and Replicating Menace for sustain/mech synergy. Lots of Inner Rages, Blood for Ichors, Cruel Taskmasters, Slams and Execute for pings and large removals. Battle Rage for refill, and for late game it has DK Garrosh, Whitemane, Y'Shaarj and Big Bad Archmage.  6 wins so far with it, including 3 Mercenaries.
---
this is so broken....
---
for the opponent

*I'm in*

Brought to you by Robes and Goggles.

Needs more ten dollar hot dog.
---
What decks are you losing to? Mulligan comes down to you identifying what kind of deck you're playing against and finding a balance between being greedy and properly utilizing your board clears.
---
Elemental wrath 925. I've beaten Mercs 280 4 or 5 times. its got a few tools to clear the early patches, and when it takes back control it demolishes.
---
Every time I get 280 and match up against another I end up conceding...
---
Colors are nice. Mage card I suppose ?
---
the warrior quest would go well with dual wielding weapons.
---
the cyclone mage (i think that is the name) and bomb / midrange hunter seem to give me the most trouble, maybe token druid if they get an amazing start
---
Nice aggro quest.
---
I think I already hate Reborn. It´s going to be such a frustrating mechanic.
---
Wish they would just take away the twinspell
---
if they do that, is even less reason why this(and the other one) would be legendary
---
TheKeyworker#11737
---
another card for silence priest.
---
I really hope that's not the actual name, because it would be very annoying for blizz to set a precedent for legendaries without a proper name(face collector doesn't count)
---
Not even a little.
---
Where is the *well played* pillow ?
---
Wow talk about an arena king... is this an April fools joke? It’s insane value.
---
God damn that might be the best boom art yet.
---
Look at "vS meta score" and click on legend. Cyclone Mage is far and away #1 because it has no bad matchups.
---
And for the record I'm not complaining at all about the deck being good. It does a lot of really well-designed things that I find interesting, that a lot of other people hate. It's just that this one specific card *needs* to get looked at.
---
I'd disagree. The President is scary, but this is truly terrifying.
---
Click on Legend under "vS meta score".
---
Oh sorry, forgot to address the rest. Mech Paladin I could maybe see an argument for but Mech Paladin is generally best dealt with using mostly single target removals. The two brawls Warriors already run is enough to cover the rest. Big Priest is an absolute joke right now, no one plays it in standard.
---
Lastly, so far the reborn minions have all been relatively low health (except the legendary... which is bad so it's not going to see play). Low enough that Warpath can handle them no problem (especially since you have to wait til turn 9 to do the Warpath/Plague/Warpath combo you set up). Plus, with a few exceptions, the Reborn minions haven't been all that great and the good ones (the Warrior one especially) are more removal tools than sticky minions.
---
I have yet to see a compelling reason why this card would be good in the current Warrior decks.
---
The reborn ones come back with 1 health left not base 1 health.
---
No resurrect card brings back damaged minions.
---
But if youre waiting for kaboom - then you need to factor in that if it's not in your reroll pool, you had it the turn before
---
If you have kaboom but want it next turn, then you have a 0% chance of having it next turn, and a 25% chance of having it the turn after. So the probability is never 20%. This is because you're not looking at the game as a whole (whereby you will have kaboom 20% of the time) but your looking at snapshots of the game where your intention is to get kaboom
---
Well the resurrects and shadow essences are always live (can't get barnes, every pull gets you two creatures), and you're able to run more reactive spells since your hand isn't clogged with big dudes you can't play.
---
Isn't this the TFT streamer? He's well disguised.
---
I'm 3/3 for wins with this paladin silverhand deck.
---
OP’s top comment suggests it is indeed a Stone Golem. Which doesn’t make sense, flavor-wise, but it’s for the best.
---
bruh...
---
And how does blindly praising a card get anyone anywhere either? What’s the point of any of this? Maybe we just shouldn’t do anything during card pre-release season, we should all just sit around and be totally silent until the cards come out. Also, are you claiming this is going to be on the power level of pre-nerf Crystal Core? Can I get that on record so I can laugh hysterically at it later?
---
I do this too, almost exactly. Hardest way to accomplish any of these is on Ogreish anomaly.
---
People expected the experiment to last longer than 4 hours
---
If he’s already out than yeah but this looks like from empty board 10 mana total.
---
Still couldn't go face but that is a good point.
---
I can't wait to mind control this huge boy.
---
"Oh no
---
oh no
---
_oh no."_
---
Flavor text
---
“Ready for the mosh pit shaka brah”
---
Pretty sure up until the day before
---
no u
---
Rebom
---
Aaah, so if it's like DS, then it would rez one. Good to know, thank you!
---
Because the last thing the world needs is more "Insert token race player" and calling it diversity.  
---
Tokenism is racism creeping in under the guise of wanting to help.
---
Reckon this is leading to brawl being HOF’d
---
Waiting for a Burning Legion expansion
---
op..... he wasn't actually hacking blizzard.
---
TFT will be dead in a month.
---
nope, rarity doesnt matetr for random effect.
---
Lets not forget about, muckmorphers with reborn and divine shield.
---
I'd just buy individual packs of each set you missed one at a time until you get a legendary then move onto the next set and repeat until you have a legendary from each one. You're guaranteed to get a legendary within the first ten packs of each set, so that's probably the most value you can get for your gold in your situation.
---
When Dog tried to withdraw, any functioning e-sports team would have told him about this if this was true.
---
...fuck
---
Really cool Ammit. I like the pose emphasizing its lion aspect.
---
they dont have to be all good/playable, just atleast interesting/unique effect, griftah or celestila suck but theyre more interesting then this.
---
Trash
---
Has to be.
---
found the racist
---
I don't know why, but I hate him
---
King Mosh?
---
I think it really depends on how much of the classic set you have. It's obviously going to be around the longest, so it will have the longest term value. But if you already have most of the set you're less and less likely to get the things you need the more packs you open. 
---
New packs will have a better immediate return on investment and will help you keep up with the meta better, especially in the beginning.
---
It's hard to say since 22 packs isn't a whole heck of a lot. I would probably wait for the meta to settle, see what decks you want to play, and then buy the packs that have the best chance of giving you whatever cards you're missing. 
---
If you have limited gold I would stray from buying packs that are going to rotate out next year and spend the gold on packs that will be around for 2 years. 
---
Also to consider, you get classic packs from playing brawl every week, so they are also less valuable to spend gold on for that reason.
---
Also me? Wimikk#1235
---
I bet you're here in the comments to see the hero power reward, huh?
---
Don't. Watch the reveal video. It's like 2 minutes and is SO WORTH. Even if you DO know the hero power I STILL suggest the reveal vid. Trump's best.
---
No its mine :)
---
Brode reborn
---
CC is the reason I’m eking out a subsistence in wild with an immortal deck wishing I could bother with standard again
---
This is fantastic! I love how the video rips on Trump and Amaz for being bad.
---
I think paralyze ends after your turn.
---
You are informed? Lol. You don't trust into a variety of sources from the broad range of the political specturm, not the FBI, the CIA, the Senate and House committees... but you are "more inofrmed than me". LMFAO! 
---
And, trust me, I don't want to go where you are.
---
So, now, show me how informed you aree by actually posting some information pertaining to the issues raised. Also, please debunk the findings of the intelligence agencies. Or of Director Mueller's  yesterday's testimony...
---
Warrior is gonna be strong, lol.
---
How do you even analyze it, though? “Players conceded until they got the ‘best’ deck”?
---
Oh yeah that works
---
thanks!!
---
I see what you did there, this is great
---
why is this downvoted?
---
Yes. I know I am. I absolutely know it, no doubt at all whatsoever. 
---
 Your attitude shows me this is a waste of my time though You seem *incredibly* young and you’re not there yet.
---
Im now playing the game of "who can concede the fastest?" in mirror matches.
---
Ironically CW can use this quest as a consistant infinite value source. You wabt to use weapon to remove stuff anyway during the game
---
This is much worse than people in this thread seems to think.
---
Big priest should be called Unicron Priest.
---
Big shaman value
---
Lol. YOu are so inofrmed that you know my alleged age..."young". Lmfao. You offer nothing to proof any of your claims... because you obviously can't. Also, what is my "attitude"? Do you mean actually being informed about stuff? Reading newspapers and reports?
---
Eh... not if they print a Deathbite clone again like bloodrazor lol
---
Worst part about prison is the 4 mana 7/7’s
---
How would that have even worked
---
I'm just so sick of warrior at this point that I hope this card is total trash. Maybe not the best reason, but that's what I'm going with.
---
The problem wasn't the reward or the clear condition necessarily
---
The biggest problem was having a dead turn one that does nothing, with a payoff that comes many turns later after playing a bad deck 
---
That's why the quests that revolves around tempo didn't work. It wasn't because the reward wasn't good enough it was just that it was against your game plan 
---
Ok top of that you have the fact that those decks were running unoptimized lists in order to complete the quest, and you just have a recipe for disaster 
---
Why give up your turn one and play a bunch of bad cards when you could just instead play good cards and kill your opponent on turn 7 
---
So to answer your question, the quests can't really work unless the rewards are so broken that it makes it worthwhile
---
Heads I win, tails you lose
---
Must be an avid aggro player then
---
When this minion attacks an enemy, it instead attacks your own hero. Twice.
---
I'm ready for the Overwatch crossover expansion!
---
You figured it out from the comments, what I want to add is that there are tooltips in game that tell you what mechanics/keywords like Battlecry do. Mouse over the card and it'll tell you. Like [here](https://sportsbard.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/hearthstone-screenshot-12-07-15-10-33-05.png). The in-game tooltip is *Deal excess damage on your turn for a bonus.*
---
She's extremely annoying and fake, makes me miss Brode even mpre
---
Brawl needs to go for sure, but since that won't be the case until next rotation (most likely), looks like warrior might have more playable clears.
---
Yeah, I've been playing a lot of silence priest this expansion and it's closer than people realize.  \[\[Extra Arms\]\] can snowball so quickly if you have the quality one drop to pair with it.  It just out tempos opponents.
---
Interested to see what else they print.  Psychopomp is really interesting and the legendary has some really practical combo potential.  Shaman's been looking pretty powerful though, I'd probably give the nod to them.
