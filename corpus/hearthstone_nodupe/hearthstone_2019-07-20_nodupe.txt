Lol I'm gonna do this with bomb warrior next expansion thanks for heads up
---
The plan with bomb warrior is you fill your deck with extras using Ellek so you decrease your bomb draw chances have Warrior fill your deck with a few bombs then Rafaam. Bomb warrior isn't as good at removal as Control and often doesn't run Elysiana so you can sometimes win them out. Control Warrior is really really difficult though, so much removal and 10 extras, hard to get a foothold at all
---
I think the *only* case I've seen Celestia do work was when Toast was against a Druid in Arena and said that this would block a potential out for his opponent that he'd normally play on curve (I think he got Celestia from a different effect).
---
The effect is good, obviously.  Every mage deck would play a 4/6 that deals 10 across the enemy board.  The problem is that it's not much better than Blizzard.  So would you rather play 2 Blizzard, or 1 Blizzard 1 Reno and also be a highlander deck?
---
So the deck that you might put this in, would be better without this card.  For the triumphant return of RENO JACKSON that is pretty disappointing.
---
Better yet, we need something to either shuffle duplicates or cards that didn‚Äôt start in your deck into your opponent‚Äôs.

The fuck kinda rebuttal is that? You can count on it more than if it could also go face.
---
YEH LETS MAKE THE MAIN LEGENDARYS GET HARD COUNTER BY ONE OF THE BEST DEAKS IN THE GAME
---
The only hope is that nobody plays them so peapol don‚Äôt only play bomb warrior and that debuff it somehow
---
Made the same post... XD Apparently his effect is disabled in solo adventures and tavern brawls like these.
---
Yah, it's garbage.
---
Nice
---
While this is funny, it is also interesting. The line about "a healthy meta should have decks that keep others in check". This is great. But. What keeps Bomb Warrior in check?
---
And keeping in check and just completely shutting down are two different things. It is sad that the highlander decks will be crippled so easily. But we shall see.
---
Either way. I think the new highlander cards, as of right now, are kinda useless. Except for Finley and Elise. Those two have potential.
---
Classic really helps new players who do not have all the wild cards.
---
Don't worry, I read it as wasps the firsts time around too, and had to do a double take after reading his comment.
---
I loved dirty rat, as soon as it was spoiled i was like, this is bonkers, control shaman here I come.  
---
The deck hardly ever lost but almost every game went to fatigue or close to it.
---
I ran ancestors call, 4-5 overload (5) dmg spell, the gain 7 joust for 14, malygos of course. 4/6 legendary that gives you spells life steal.  
---
I haven't played In months but i might give hunter a go bc interacting with cards in your opponents hand is busted.
---
you mean standard, not classic.
---
one of the main appeals is that the deck archetypes change every expansion, or at least every year.  decks like kingsbane rogue, odd paladin, and big priest will exist forever in wild, but they leave standard eventually and make room for new decks.
---
And bombs also cancel the effect that they are making a whole expansion around! Amazing job blizzard!
---
Spiteful Priest was a pretty strong deck, definitely tier 2 if not tier 1. I suppose that despite its namesake, it really was mostly a dragon deck though.
---
r/2007scape is a force to be reckoned with, I love it.
---
Are you stupid or something?  
---
If it can go face it has more versatility than if it can't.
---
It feels weird to be this far in the reveals to only have 3 neutral cards so far. At this point with 1/4 of the set shown we have no idea what sort of cards are the most likely to go into decks.
---
Tbh I was hyped at first but at the back of my head I had a feeling Reno would be disappointing and overhyped
---
You're assuming there will be a Highlander meta xD
---
Elementals are natural forces independent of the Planes. The Planes simply served as their prisons after their defeat by the Titans.
---
Yes
---
Don't forget you can clone the discounted beast with hunting party and it keeps the discount.
---
The bad king crush have some use of clearing taunts for the good ones to go face
---
Hearthstone is a bottomless pit of money unfortunately, even in standard
---
Huh that's strange, I wonder why they decided to do that. Thanks for letting me know!
---
If you mean Standard, I prefer it because standard formats change more significantly more often and have restrictions that make deckbuilding more appealing to me. I prefer the restrictions over the blank slate and unfettered power level of eternal formats.
---
This is good against warrior.
---
Frost Nova + Doomsayer
---
What is this, 2016?
---
You can wait until the end of the month when the full set is revealed, so I'd recommend doing that. In a general sense, though, the 50$ you spend on 50 packs and a golden legendary is higher value (in terms of packs/dust per dollar spent) than anything else other than a few Wild bundles, so you would get more mileage from that money by spending it on a pre-order, be it for SoU or a future set.
---
Stats are... Nice.
---
They "try" not to do that. Even when the effect is basically the same, they won't align both designs, like unstable evolution, repeateable this turn and echo. The only exception was discover, and the thing with discover is that it was included in an adventure and everyone loved it x10. That's the only one trick they repeated.
---
I am a bit salty about the mana cost. If it were 5, then we could abuse it with DK Rexxar.
---
I don't even think it necessarily needs to be a control tool. It hits a lot of cards with pretty low risk in some matchups. It's probably worst against mage with their giants, but against Warrior, it'll hit omega yeti, dynomatic, 4 mana rush boi, and several other cards that warrior uses to regain tempo. Against rogue, it hits sharks, miscreants, leeroy, SI7, and if it's unluciky and hits a lackey, well, it's still a 6/8 that kiled a lackey. I think it's fine as a midrange card and depending on the rest of the set and how the meta shifts, this card could be really good at just beating minions with tempo battlecries.
---
The flavor text makes me wish the token would be counted as a treant, but probably won't.
---
true thats why i would run both
---
The worst outcome is pulling out a divine shield minion right? I mean that‚Äôs actually quite good even when compared to dirty rat
---
This is a post directly related to card design with a bonus: humor. These mods don't even read their own rules.
---
I just realized it's "Highlander" card cause of the qoute "There can be only one" form Highlander. 
---
I know this took me far too long and I feel bad for feeling proud of myself for finally understanding it

Assuming you have 2 copies of each card, merchant makes you go from 2 to 4, and spiritsinger makes you go from 4 to... 16?
---
Wot
---
Honestly I have the same question but for Wild. Why play wild at all? It's full of cards that are no longer in rotation, decks that are broken because they have cards in them that were never meant to be played together (ie Big Priest dominance in Wild), and completely neglected by the devs. Why should I play wild when Standard has a constantly changing meta, is the focus of the developers, has a standard list of cards that people are allowed to make decks out of that if they get out of control receive nerfs as a power check. It's the idea of "fun because of limits" idea
---
What is a good time? 
---
I played it twice (not knowing about the time thingy in the first run) and my best was 26 minutes but I took pretty long on multiple bosses so I guess under 20 is more than possible.
---
Accidental face is best face
---
It doesn't have to be a combo disrupter. Since it also kills the card, it can just be good tempo to pull out enemy tempo cards, like dynomatic, si7, sorc apprentice, or get rid of some value generators like shark, cyclone.
---
Yes, but nothing is stopping you from running two. You only need to draw 1 out of the 2 to trigger its effect, but you can draw both to quadruple.

That's 2*2*1/100*100*100= 6/1000000
---
But i didn't account for 3 rares so it is slightly lower than that
---
you play the mech on the left to magnetize.
---
Haven't even got lucky enough for 2 hand of rafaams. 
---
That weapon though is also godly. Love playing tog just for that weapon.
---
They don't get "more invulnerable minions", they get the same amount, but they have to play them out 6 mana at a time. Even if they have a ton of draw, they can still only play 1 per turn. 
---
I'm not saying its a perfect solution, outside of mass dispel, its pretty much as good as you can hope for. I think the only time you wouldn't play psychic scream on a board of 6 5/5s that revive themselves, is when you have exactly dispel into board clear. Trying to do anything is asking to die to the 30 power on board. 
---
(I said 6 and 30 power on the assumption that in most cases you can only get 6 of them. I can't think of a way to get 7 that is simple enough where it'd see legit play)
---
I don't think a deck that's intentionally floating mana cares about the opponents health very much
---
Twinspell actually works really well imo, it's not the most exciting thing ever but it's not supposed to be.  It is mechanically very solid; pretty much all of the twinspell cards see play without being overpowered.
---
Only 15 more epics and 3 more legendaries to go
---
It had better allow me to add wild cards to my deck so that I can get back my OG Reno and Kazakus so that I can make a viable highlander deck.
---
If you are in NA i can help you with any quest you need help in the future, add me: wiibomb#1871
---
Just to add an additional thought because it seems like this might be the issue, when cruel dinomancer resummons the minion that died, it does not remove that minion from the 'graveyard'. It summons a copy of it.
---
I don't get it, a known bug? That's weird
---
They only needed to nerf Raza because it let you OTK with [[Shadowreaper Anduin]]. If Priests hadn‚Äôt gotten a card that permanently let them use their hero power do damage to anything as long as they could keep playing cards, Raza would have been fine.

nice.
---
comparing with prenerf cards is a bit misleading considering they were nerfed for a reason
---
That would be a really cool card imo
---
Dawg paladin literally has two cards in the classic set that revive minions at one health when they die. Reborn is literally a paladin mechanic.
---
Yea, I've since realized the stupidity of my reasoning, lol, appreciate it though
---
Museum Curator clearly makes deathrattle a part of priest's identity.
---
-licate card ideas?
---
My best guess is that they‚Äôre going to be many different styles of reborn minions that can change how you build the deck, but still, not nearly as flexible as the others
---
2 divine spirit, don't forget the druid used earthen scales twice to get 2x armor of the attack, so one divine spirit only keep it up the armor, you need 2 of them.
---
Uhh.. "Upgraded" Hero powers are the ones introduced in Grand Tournament, and reintroduced in Witchwood.
---
For example, an upgraded hero power for Paladin is "Summon two 1/1 Recruits."
---
For Warrior, "Gain 4 Armor."
---
And just like that. You can look up the other upgraded hero powers.

---
I totally agree on the tempo note but the meta has so few chunky minions in it, most tempo based minion plays are from battlecrys. 
---
Outside of mage (and mech pally if anyone plays it post xpac) there are only a hand full of meta minions that survive this thing.
---
When you're behind sure it's bad. Hunter is bad from behind. But on an even board state this thing will usually 2:1 and disrupt someone's hand.
---
Yep. I've been playing Hearthstone since GvG. I've lived though many things. Pre-nerf undertaker, secret paladin, patron warrior, FoN + Savage roar, tier 1 control warrior and freeze mage, patches pirate decks, you name it. I will never hate anything in the game as much as priest.

"Attack it" is this consistently inconsistent to "they fight" from the card Duel! or does this only do damage to that minion. I'm guessing it's the former.
---
You can proxy them tho
---
That sounds like an inconsistent deck, not a consistent one. And that‚Äôs why big priest isn‚Äôt as good as people say it is. When it highrolls it‚Äôs insane, but most of the time it‚Äôs weaker than actual strong wild decks. Wild is on a whole new power level than standard, and big priest without Barnes on 4 is a joke to the top tier decks.
---
I bow to your magnificent swinging of the sword we call scientifical analysis.
---
People aren't arguing that it's undefeatable generally, but that it feels like garbage to play against.  It's beatable, but the high rolls just feel like crap, and that's what most people hate about it.  
---
Tons of decks have been adjusted because they felt like garbage to lose to.  Take naga sea witch decks, they're basically big priest except with even bigger boards and less reload.  And they felt just as garbage to lose to, and got changed because of that, not their winrate.
---
I hope I'll be there to see it: the first time this hits a Stoneskin Basilisk.
---
... Huh? Hunting party copies cards in your hand. And only beasts. Brann is not a beast. How do you plan on getting Krush back into your hand? Or are you implying an 23-mana 3 turn long combo won't be countered and isn't objectively meme trash?
---
Also there are mill rogue decks that are loaded with dupes (not a highlander deck at all!) but have a random Reno in there for when they hit fatigue.
---
I was thinking Stelladris too. Combo and you get a Pseudo Unleash the Wyverns, but replace 5/5 rush with 6/6 taunt.
---
Sorry.. i assumed the discussion was about krush not brann since the post is also beast reduction.

Deathrattle is single set? I don't get it
---
So it‚Äôs basically Murloc Raider, except it has 1 less attack and reborn. Right @MurlocRaiderFan?
---
Check the new bran out bud
---
Wait, is it that they were retconed or is this some sort of long running misunderstanding where everyone in the WOW universe just believes that Void creatures are demons and nobody questions it?
---
There were almost zero ways to counterplay NSW as it would win in one turn most of the time.  There are, and always have been, and will be more counter strategies to Big Priest.  As time goes on, it will become more easily countered and become a Tier 3 deck.  What SHOULD happen is Wild rotating certain sets in and out to keep the meta evolving and never static.  Not only would this make players engage in more creative deckbuilding, it would also encourage more players to purchase/craft cards from wild expansions to try archetypes that never had enough support in Standard.

---
I got 18 minutes with 2 hands of rafaam. Honestly the 22 minutes seem slow with 3.
---
Expansion pack maybe? Lots of people use the word when talking about expansions for board games, video games, etc
---
Preeety sure the name Discolock was partly inspired by One Night in Karazkhan and its disco-y thematics.
---
I like where you're going with that, but I'd argue a few of those.  I'd argue that Mage is firmly blue/red due to the amount of direct damage spells/removal.  And I'd also argue that Shaman is actually blue/green/red for the same sort of reason since there is a lot of direct damage.  Priest could actually be argued as white/black due to resurrection being a mechanic seen in both colors and the shadow priest element.
---
The brutal things is, you don't need to build your whole deck around it. You can just put them into an other deck type for a back up plan
---
So... odd warrior?
---
Also, FYI, they were just "Reno decks" back in the day.  Then Reno rotated out, and with Gadgetzan "no duplicates" cards still in the game, we wanted a better name.
---
Thanks!
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted because this is absolutely true
---
Yes. Your pay-off cards being timing-specific in one particular matchup will render them completely unplayable. No playable deck in the history of Hearthstone has had counters.

Naga was nerfed cause of an AD on reddit. The other was probably yeah, the only real nerf to Wild in Star Aligner combos. The internal winrate of that deck deck was so absurdly dumb it warranted a nerf.
---
Are you saying what would be the upgraded versions of the Dalaran Heist hero powers? Because they don‚Äôt have upgraded version.

Honestly this should have been Priest quest. Now im curious as hell as to what Priest's quest actually is

---
They view themselves as good, as most villains do. That's absolutley irrelevant.
---
They should just buff the classic priest set so priest doesnt get another strong af board clear every expac
---
Control shaman is my jam.With Shudderwock and Hagatha you can outlast almost any other greedy deck and you have board clears for days against aggro.The downside-40 minutes games against warriors,it always goes to double Elysiana.
---
Am I wrong for LOVING the Paladin quest?It IS interesting and probably WILL be at a good power level so...
---
No? I'm hoping for something like "4/7/7 mech. Magnetic. Battlecry: gain 7 armor and replace your hero with dr boom crazy eccentric, and for each point of armor you have, add 1 bomb to the top of your opponents deck. Cannot be targeted by spells, hero powers or battle cries. Deathrattle: add 3 copies of this card to your hand. They cost (0). Your hero power costs (0) and is repeatable each turn" 
---
Failing that id be happy with a basic mech that just doubles bombs in opponents deck. 
---
Something like that. Just my food for thought for the devs
---
wtf these are worth so much.
---
Emperer tharissan alter
---
This is really terrible and I'm going to predict that nobody's going to play it unless it was randomly generated from another card.  I mean especially the 12 healing for 6 mana, wow.  I mean I get that this card is meant for of requests but if you're not completing the quest then this is just really really bad
---
NowNoLogics#1190 NA 80g gold trade, you go first!
---
I atleast like the Norzdormu alt that somebody made a year ago that was ["Battlecry: Destroy all cards that were generated by another card (Wherever they are)"](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/7bsaus/remember_nozdormu_hes_back_in_human_form_and_he/)
---
Especially since this depicts a faceless one
---
Maybe give it charge? The cards added by the battlecry could have an additional battlecry too something like gain +7 attack(7 dr boom theme) for each bomb in opponents deck..or for each armors you have? Just brainstorming here
---
Then you don't understand the flavor of the set.
---
All of pack openings should be posted on the thread "hearthstone pulldays",that are every Tuesday

It still wouldn't work.

New players won't be able to net positive Arena for the first few years. So don't give them false hope.
---

No, that means you must complete them by July 31.

yeah this is pretty much exactly how i feel

They need to stop with this murloc shit. I dont think anyone likes it if their class gets turned into a joke cause of murlocs. Murlocs are fine as neutrals and the occasional class card but this theme of paladin murloc and shaman murloc needs is getting annoying.
---
That was a very detailed answer. Thank you!

Showing the cards would be much better for the artwork, showing cost, health and attack instead of blurting it out, since it‚Äôs a lot of information.

&gt;A new Legendary Fire Fest-E.V.I.L. quest* will be unlocked each day for the first 7 days of the event in addition to your normal daily quests.

It literally says FOR THE FIRST 7 DAYS OF THE EVENT. Meaning one legendary quest/day for 7 days. It's not ambiguous, there is no other way to interpret that sentence.
---
No, that just means that you won't be able to receive and complete those quests after July 31. Again, they literally say that you get a new legendary quest each day for the first 7 days of the event.

Interesting post. I‚Äôve seen a few people share the sentiment lately that the night elves and their potential impact on the rest of the alliance is massively overlooked by the writers. The elves are 10k years old, but humans still always take the spotlight somehow. The best rogue / spy master on the alliance is a 35 year old human named Shaw, and not an ancient shadowmelding night elf!? It‚Äôs crazy.

---
Yeah, Harrison is in Uldum for Cataclysm, isn't he? He teaches Archaeology in Stormwind as well, so it makes sense. I reckon he has a chance at returning actually.
---
All those deathrattle mechs ... totally not "resource generation".
---
Paper airplane seems like a fun card
---
I mean, two of the best priest cards both involved dearhrattle and we're around long before Ungoro. Agree with the rest, though.
---
But not the economy
---
Might be because you cast a spell that drew it from your deck (i.e. Tracking).
---
how dare they shake things up an break the status quo.
---
Yet luck totally decides that matchup.  
---
The control warrior played well and with early boom is all but unbeatable.  
---
You totally need luck or bad play (rare at high level) to win that matchup.    
---
Dr. Boom is by far the most cancer card in the game right now because it just requires next to no skill and lets Warriors pull out wins they had no right to win.
---
NO
---
Nope.
---
But if you do, at least wait until more cards have been shown.
---
I mean, people said the same thing with Deathstalker Rexxar, just put that in any deck, and it instantly has a late game.
---
Well remember RNG.  If the warrior fails to get any brawls or boom or warpath by turn 6 then you've got a good chance. :)
---
Ah man nothing to say really? Not even a salty response? Dissapointing
---
Dont forget that your hand needs to be empty besides these cards or the combo will fizzle after 1 or 2 goes, so it may be more difficult to pull off. I could see it working Nike a Nomi esque druid deck though
---
What server?
---
The problem isn't reborn, it's that copy was literally jusy defined as a priest mechanic and lorewise pallys would be against making undead mummies ( the DK starting zone of WoW ).
---
If the quest was just give a minion reborn and they just called it some synonym of redemption I think it would be much better received. Pallys are fine with bring people back to life but not in undeath. 
---
Side note: WoWs got some weird rules on how death works which is being touched on a lot in BfA
---
It would probably make more sense in priest but it would probably also make the deck too strong because priest already has a pretty good package designed around this theme + resurrect effects. Catrina Muerte + this hero power could be absurd, Shadow madness + this card could also be insane, there are probably a lot of combos. I think it's better that way, not to mention it would probably be broken in wild.
---
Isn't that what playing tier 1 in casual is for?
---
&gt; and him not saving enough board clear to answer it.
---
&gt;The warrior didn't misplay.  
---
He totally misplayed or didn't draw enough board clear ... you got lucky but if you want to think to it's all down to your mad skill then more power to you.  
---
I'm currently rank 1 with murloc shaman and can beat control warriors maybe 1 in 3 (sorry bomb warrior, 2 in 3 I win) and even with some of the most bad board setups to WArrior (multiple Storm Bringers from Hagatha) I can still lose to the retarded rush Boom mechanic etc.  
---
There is a skill element in knowing how to beat the Warrior but if their mediocre luck goes well then they win unless they are complete retards which isn't generally the case at high ranks.
---
Because pit lord is too erotic and somehow dodged the art nerfs
---
It's clearly not a prescription monocle
---
&gt; Think of streamers again. Most are playing off meta decks,
---
Where do you get this nonsense from?  
---
If they are competitive they are totally playing meta decks to their rank (they use a true meta analysis like premium hsprleay to know how their decks performs against other decks and exactly what does well at their rank) or they are just running meme decks for the entertainment value.

There's one more highlander card coming
---
Why not brann instead then? Then you can do the entire thing in one turn instead of two.
---
Wrong name tbh. As if Blizzard would actually take pity on us
---
Except... Much much much worse
---
Also AK stands for Aviana Kun
---
Looks like the rogue legenddary to me. 
---
If you look closely, you can see beneath the legendary dragon the black colorsheme of the rogue cards and a small golden flowerpeddel(?) which meaches exacly the characteristics of a rogue card
---
This feels like a tough set for blizzard. They've printed overpowered sets in the past that got people hyped and they people got sick of polarising matchups and infinite value within weeks. They print underpowered looking quests and highlander cards and people are underwhelmed. 
---
If people aren't excited about the cards they are less likely to buy the preorder, and paying the same money for the chance to get worse cards also feels bad.
---
I suppose these effect is worse because they are revisiting old ground with the LOE and the quests rather than radical new ideas.
---
Then again, fairer cards are healthier for the meta and might keep people playing the game.
---
Not in the same turn so irrelevant

Let‚Äôs say as an experiment you play 100 games as cyclone mage

You telling me that your winrates will be identical? 
---
No, they won‚Äôt. Hence, matchups are favoured on the deck you choose before a card is even played.
---
i don't see this being used. there are superior otks suck as exodia mage which requires the same amount of cards, but is in a class with way more defensive tools (ice block, a lot of AOE freeze) and draw engine, not to mention this hunter deck can't pass through much armour or taunts

Sure but why focus on that if you can't  change it, it's much more productive to focus on how improve your winrate in unfavored matchups.

Mech Paladin is a great deck to play into it. But mainly any other mech deck beats it.

handlock is still a fun deck, so i wouldnt just throw it out. there's actually a new combo with barista lynchen and omega agent that you should try out. handlock definitely isnt a top tier deck atm, but u can still go places with it. good luck on ladder

Lmao classic hearthstone, Aggro, or bomb warrior, what a healthy meta

Yup but in the end it's not the developers fault people only play one deck.

priest going shadow from now on will probably be related to "turn healing into damage" effects, like shadowform
---
Qyeayg
---
I love Tekahn, though I'm wondering how exactly do you break it.
---
Oh freak u are right
---
I don't understand why all of you are whining. In WoW the paladin class has redemption , a spell that resurrects a teammate. 
---
Also you forgot that Hearthstone isn't an exact adaptation of WoW.
---
Until you reach a ranked floor, then you have to waddle through a mass of weird jank ass Priest decks that you have no idea how to prepare for.

Where is the source?
---
I just crush the innkeeper for these to get it done quick for my brothers.
---
I found the developer and he said not enough people used it to justify the server costs so he had to shut it down - I was really sad also
---
I think the issue is mostly that having a core mechanic of your deck hard countered by a side effect of somebody else's deck feels really unfun.
---
i dont disagree with it getting deleted, i already stated that multiple times. i disagree, however, with being portrayed as a bully when other mods thought it was just a harmless joke, even if it didnt belong on r/customhearthstone. if you want to see it as some harsh criticism upon these poor card creators, rather than a simple bit of poking fun, then sure, go ahead, but most people wont agree with that. ive already stated all this before multiple times so im not saying it again if anyone else asks.

6/4/6 | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, deal 10 damage randomly split among all enemy minions.  
---
Even Druid and warrior? (I‚Äôm not familiar with the wild meta to know)
---
I guess taunt is the new warrior flavor this expansion.
---
maskrey#1181 trade quest NA. You go first plz.
---
I don‚Äôt know this card seems kind of weak to me.
---
This isn‚Äôt exactly relevant, but DND has healing fall under necromancy as well.
---
Where do you get it from?
---
saw it on b.net forums it could be fake
---
This card seems really good on its own, and combined with Armagedillo, it can get absurd pretty quickly. Also curves nicely for the turn after Armagedillo.
---
Still too early to say if Taunt warrior will be good enough to find a place in the SoU meta, but I'm confident that if it is a thing, this card will be in it.
---
0/56
---
I am lonely.
---
Dude, this is a huge thing that almost everyone saw immediately. No way they lacked the foresight to make a counter to bomb warrior. That would be a mistake much bigger than anything they've ever done wrong. The other mistakes they would have had a much harder time knowing. This is simple, and they will get a ton of shit if they haven't made a counter to bomb warrior ready.
---
Restoring life to the dead is not the same as rising undead. Paladin resurrection restores the original person to life. Rising a mummy is just necromancy.
---
No my point is that from reading Duel you cannot tell whether your minion (if it has Charge) will be able to attack or not.
---
Do you happen to know if it can?  I don't.
---
Worst case scenario it can beat its way past a poisonous minion.
---
I mean idk holy resurrection has been a part of paladin/priest class identity since forever in WoW. I think the difference is that with necromancy you are using unholy magic to make a dead hunk of flesh move, whereas with resurrection you are using holy magic to make a dead body *alive* again?
---
Thin line, I guess :P
---
If we want to go into details, in the lore(not that it matters ingame), undead/necromancied beings are burned by holy magic, whereas resurrected people are healed by it just like the rest of us.
---
In hearthstone they aren't making a super huge distinction anyway, I guess. But that's the way it's been in WoW/Warcraft lore iirc.
---
Its not the App Store it‚Äôs the connection. Have you tried on other wifi and cellular
---
Mostly for the base game though, it being an available art online definitely makes it lean towards fake but it doesn't prove anything.
---
only thing blown away by him
---
If you have other plays on 1 or some AoE turn ahead, saving it for Underbelly is fine. The 3/4 will be susceptible to toxfin anyways. Depends on whether you're playing crab in a control deck like Shirvalla OTK or a board oriented deck like Zoo.
---
Dane will play it and I will watch Dane play it
---
45 because you can also smorc with the first king krush before hes destroyed
---
&gt;It's -1/-1 stats compared to Furious Ettin in exchange for gaining 4 armour and having handbuff synergy.
---
So worse...
---
It doesn't have that much handbuff synergy either, gaining 2 more armour is so irrelevant compared to buffing a good taunt card instead.
---
God I hope so. This and big recruit have been 2 of my favs.

---
A brainless construct that does what it's told because it can't do anything else isn't evil
---
Amonkhet mummies weren't white, they were essentially colorless as they were just mindless drones. 
---
People can bring up Umezawa all they want but black characters are evil and white characters are good. That's how it works.
---
It definitely does not seem really good on it's own, you really think a Warrior would ever run this without great synergy?
---
The next card is in 12 hours, so no.
---
&gt;I mean idk holy resurrection has been a part of paladin/priest class identity since forever in WoW. I think the difference is that with necromancy you are using unholy magic to make a dead hunk of flesh move, whereas with resurrection you are using holy magic to make a dead body alive again?

---
Accurate. The light burns the betrayers and the dead, while healing the living.
---
No. You're thinking of Shadow Visions. Which A) is incredibly inconsistent in a Highlander deck and B) isn't free. Mind vision is a different card. You don't know that because you're bad at HS.
---
Between Scarab Egg, all the microbot-spawning mechs, Priest‚Äôs ability to cheaply copy minions, and cards like Sand Drudge and Violet Teacher, they have plenty of tools to make that card work.
---
How many "good taunt cards" are there, though? The biggest thing opposing this card is the existence of Amani War Bear, a Taunt minion that also costs 7 and with immediate board impact. 
---
Even then, the one Taunt handbuff card we have would buff *both* of these cards, not just one of them.
---
As it stands, Neferset Sentry looks like it can easily support a Taunt Warrior archetype, largely because it is one of few decent big Taunts. This, Armagedillo, and Amani War Bear.

Time to give bonus to the replacement and fire 100 comunity managers!

If this is real, I think it is quite good. Shield maiden was a card run at 6 mana and for just 1 mana more you get a much better body plus taunt at the expense of 1 armor.
---
Pablo#24506 EU - 80g but also have "Watch and Learn". I'll show if you tell me how then you go first.

---
There's too much perspective at play in that animation. Not something HS goldens have done in the past.
---
I mean idk I'm still going to claim that they're resurrected by the holy light and not reanimated by necromancy. Sure, holy resurrection isn't really as much of a thing in the lore, but I don't think that there are any mentions of **Reborn** minions in any of the published novels either. Plus we already know that holy resurrection is a thing in Hearthstone because of things like [[Resurrection]].

Good idea! You‚Äôre gonna need one beast in your hand though, you‚Äôre also going to  need control tools to keep you alive, so I guess you could use flanking strikes and such.

---
Ironbeak Owl would be legit since this is weak to any taunt
---
It is actually perfectly fair based on original card design, as hunter‚Äôs mark used to be 0 mana. The problem is that HM got nerfed twice, and when they put it to 2, they likely looked at 2 mana equality and thought they need to nerf it since it‚Äôs the same effect on the whole board for the same price. HM got nerfed then because of candleshot though, so it could easily be bumped back to 1 now, which would leave room for equality to be unnerfed
---
I have so many questions.
---
Not to mention people misunderstanding power; instead of making it a big minion they make it a 5 mana 6/6 with an upside "because in the lore they're really strong". That's not how balancing works. The lich king is very powerful, but he's not overstated.
---
Also, defile and portal aren‚Äôt really fair examples, since they‚Äôre incredibly op themselves
---
honestly a good strat would be to rope every turn after doing the combo to frustrate your opponent even more

What stretch? The turmoil inside the company over the last year has been documented by Jason Schreier and people who used to work for the company. The fact that both co-founders Mike and Frank, C-level members like Spencer and Amrita, all left in a span of nine months following the stock tumbling to half of its peak is just a coincidence?
---
It‚Äôs pretty naive to think people, especially those super motivated and who have been a core part of a company 100% retire because they‚Äôre in their 60s. A lot of factors go into that decision including the changing dynamics of a company. If he had quit back in 2017, I wouldn‚Äôt be making this speculation.

"This fun deck isn't strong against one of the best decks in the history of the game, what trash"
---
Classes have more than one deck archetype. There are more than mine decks in wild, mate.
---
Without context of for how long somebody is playing and how many games(wins) he had,  the answers will tell you much less. For somebody new to hs everything is new and fresh, the same person if he would start playing 3 years earlier would give you different answer now.
---
Yes, if they do anything then I truly hope that it‚Äôs just a HoF. Dr Boom is nothing compared to a few of the other Hero Cards. And the only other choice for Warriors is DK Garrosh which is just a board clear with a few armor attached.

As far as I know, Portugal is not in latinoamerica. But my facts may be wrong. And, Brazil has its own communitty like in WoW.

I started playing Hearthstone because it was a game that could have me entertained for good 10 minutes (average time of a regular match) but warrior being in the top of the meta, has lead to games that usually go over 40 minutes, just to see all of your stuff removed one time and another, it's just not fun, there is no much interaction you can do against them.
---
This is my exact plan. I‚Äôll probably toss in a few new cards like the Murloc mummy or maybe the Jar Dealer but I‚Äôm just going to zoo it up.

I really hate the Hearthstone card frame. So much detail is lost in that tiny egg shaped frame.

&gt; If you spend 100 golds on an empty collection, open 4 commons and 1 rare, you're going to get 260 dusts worth of cards. If someone else own every cards, they merely get 40 dusts in return, which is barely enough to craft a single common.
---
What a horrid analysis. It's well known that 1 pack = 100 dust. The mode is 40 dust but the average is 100.
