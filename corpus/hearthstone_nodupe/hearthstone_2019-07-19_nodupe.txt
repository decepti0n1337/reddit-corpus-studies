Meme for RenoMage in wild
---
Why the fuck did you pre-order without seeing the cards? Boomsday, Witchwood, Boomsday. Didn't they teach you?
---
I thought exactly this. I don't see why it can't happen.
---
It might be okay if it was just damage to enemy, but the fact it's minions only possible damage.... Yeah idk about this one ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Well first of all, I did miss the minion bit, still really good in control decks, but I'll admit much worse with that clause. second of all you can still get the effect if you've drawn both brewmasters, but regardless there are in fact 2 brewmasters, (youthful and ancient) and both can be played the same turn as this card.
---
It's a joke, isn't it ?
---
You're probably right, but this is gonna be hella fun in Wild.
---
You know, I completely forgot about nozari, despite me owning nozari and making a point to keep nozari despite me currently having no use for nozari because I enjoy value and control decks
---

---
You are probably right that its worse, well you are right 6&lt;9 also not healing your opponent is a medium ish benefit, but yeah. Forgot about nozari.
---
God damn it, how wasn't that my first thought.
---
I may have to get one even though I don‚Äôt even have my own place yet
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs even close to worthless though. No cards to take full advantage of the armor but the hero power by itself was devastating against most aggro-midrange decks. 4 guaranteed health each turn is certainly not worthless
---

---
It‚Äôs just one of many.
---
Yeah might be decent in wild, even if it's decent it's still underwhelming for Reno Jackson
---
I found this link [http://is2.4chan.org/vg/1563489202963.jpg](http://is2.4chan.org/vg/1563489202963.jpg) and i don't know if it's true but it's suppose to be the discarded versions of the new Reno Jackson card.
---
??? how is it more of a guaranteed board clear the more minions the enemy has? just gives you more health to take down. I really fail to see your logic here. And it's not like mage doesn't have better cards for going face.
---
I mean, existing Reno decks only *really* needed that one extra card to be as successful as they were. Kazakus. Yes, priest ran Raza but do remember seeing Krul in any Renolock deck at the time? The reason Reno decks weren't popular before MSoG is the lack of support. Unless as the end of next year we have a repeat of that era and Blizz releases more OP support cards for us.
---
Why don't deal 30 damage instead, would be true to the flavour
---
I think it‚Äôs stronger than people are making it out to be, but not as exciting as I was hoping. I was hoping he would cast a copy of every spell in your deck or something. Or a bunch of 1 mana spells. Something like that.
---
Seems totally reasonable. Works around the bomb hose, doesnt open the door to any insane shenannigans.
---
Im holding out hope that maybe there will be more highlander effects in the set to make it worthwhile, because for these 4 cards, they barely seem worth handicapping your deck for, let alone the bomb factor. Even if thats the case, the deck being hosed by bombs would kill it too quickly, so something needs to change.
---
I think (given the meta) that's gonna be too weak.
---
First, because warrior will mess it up, and then, you can't play token druid/aggro druid with no duplicates, and Lucentbark would lack consistency as well... So that's some kind of control/big druid? 
---
I don't see it working. Unless of course they had insane control druid cards.
---
Missing commas #are not the only problem with that post.
---
Combos with [[Brann Bronzebeard]]
---
With so many warriors on ladder I reccomend putting Elysiana in bomb warrior. If you don't manage to kill control warrior with bombs (bad luck, stacking armor) then Elysiana can be a saviour. Some days ago i replaced one dynomatic and brawl with spellbreaker and said Elysiana. (although i dont know if dynomatic is the best card to be thrown out) nevertheless, Elysiana won me some games already, so I just wanted to share my opinion and experience.
---
Neither do I. It seems super simple with little to no consequence.
---
It'll be good in wild, but unless we see a good neutral highlander effect this or the coming update we won't be seeing any reno in standard.

Yeah I'm getting downvoted, but it's obvious no one on this sub knows what the Wild Meta is like. Bomb Warrior is near non-existent in wild.
---
Yet somehow it was the poster child of its expansion, appearing as the background in the launcher.
---
Wish it said "Enemy Characters" and not "Enemy Minions"
---
Godfrey can actually clear a board though, even through deathrattles. This one, you build your deck around it and it's still way fucking worse than Godfrey. I doubt if they can print enough synergistic stuff for this one to work, for now it sucks hard.
---
A timer is a necessary evil, IMO, otherwise you'd just get people maliciously hanging the game. Imagine how annoying roping is now and magnifying that to an arbitrary degree.

&gt;Cristology, witchwood pepper, guest for adventure. 
---
What game are *you* playing?!
---
That's a lot of card advantage. Too bad card advantage is irrelevant in a world of Hagatha and Dr. Boom. Heck even the new mage quest provides "infinite" value.
---
The card seems strong in a vaccuum, but it seems like cards like this stopped being relevant in Standard a long time ago (basically with the introduction of Quests and DKs).
---
Basic removal is something like polymorph or shadow word death; this is removal on steroids. It gives you a body with vanilla stats and has mech synergy which is super strong in warrior.
---
Hahaha I remember losing to innkeeper warlock multiples times when i first started playing. If you're new I'd recommend you play an aggro deck that wants to "go face". The thing about board control is (if you're playing aggro) 1 you only want it if you're opponent is also playing aggro and 2 learn to value trade which in short means don't hit a minion if yours will die
---
Question, does it require no duplicates in the deck when played or none at the start.
---
There has been confirmed no other specific highlander support.

reno mage will play it for sure. its not insane or anything its just a better dynomatic

I feel like the change to "if your deck started with no duplicates" is a total no-brainer and I will honestly be super dissapointed if they dont change this

i think the timer could be better implemented, something like a chess clock or a system where after playing a card you get a little bit more time, it would prevent hanging the game while not being a problem if you have a complex turn

Use hearthstone deck tracker and hsreplay.net to find out what decks your classic set gets you close to finishing.  Then start dusting bad cards from the rotated set until you can make a few competitive decks.  You're likely to be able to make a few if you had a decent collection in 2015-17.
---
I don't know if the effects enough to make singleton worth it, especially Reno.
---
This card is a lot worse than people are making it out to be, the whole purpose of having an upgarded hero power is so that you build your deck around the strength of that hero power, but randomizing the chances of drawing the card that upgrades your hero power and the chance that you're gonna get the hero power you want all but assures that you can't build your deck around it. 
---
And the fact that it's a 2 mana 2/3 murloc with a powerful affect doesn't mean anything because there's no way any murloc decks are willing to sacrifice the second murloc warleader, tidecaller, or the coldlight seer for this.
---
That's worse. Reno's going to be played in a (highlander) control deck where you'd much rather kill minions vs aggro on turn 6 than deal damage to face. Plus, it's not like mage doesn't have cards to deal damage to face lol
---
I don‚Äôt think this guy has ever played as, or against, a hunter.  Midrange and deathrattle hunter were prominent a few months ago.
---
Topdecking the spell into drawing 2 galvanisers with an empty hand doesn't

---
Plagues are supposed to negatively affect all minions, but Rogue‚Äôs plague was nerfed last minute to fit with the class identity of not being able to deal with wide boards.
---
Back to three fingers I see
---
&gt; in a pinch, this could deal 20 damage, almost ensuring to wipe the board.
---
Assuming you mean, play Brann and Reno 2.0 on the same turn, that means surviving to Turn 9 (8 if you Coin em out). does Reno Mage survive long enough for that to happen, with or without the Reno 1.0 heal? (which you won't draw in time, all the time)
---
Because it is fun and interactive to draw four bombs at twenty health and lose the game.
---
One of the devs was quoted saying there wont be any more this set. It seems like such a strange move that im hoping it was a misunderstanding but as of now im taking it at face value
---
No can do face damage no good smorc
---
I laughed at this more than I should have.
---
&gt;If you're playing a value-oriented deck
---
That's pretty specific.
---
If we're doing Highlander Ferocious Howl would probably be included simply because there aren't that many better Druid cards in the format right now.
---
I don't know what combo you'd be trying to pull off in a highlander deck though, so Psychmelon doesn't seem like something you'd consider.

BUT since it was first posted Blizzard got in touch with them and said there would be one more Singleton support card!

Should be (30 - *cards left in deck*) damage. No deck left? 30 damage randomly split all enemies. Legit a better reno, not broken, viable

Thank you for the info.

Idk, it‚Äôs not a bad card. If there‚Äôs some neutral support a la Kazakus it can still be a good deck. 
---
Mage is already in a good spot, and this is removal (currently a bit of a weakness for control Mage). It‚Äôs flexible too, taking care of small wide boards, or a big single target.
---
The cards that shuffle identical cards have historically been the antidote for highlander decks - so this is not going to happen, it should also not happen.

Seaforium in shaman for shuffling in tons of bombs with the quest.

They may still be cautious after Baku/Genn, not wanting to introduce reliable hero power upgrading.
---
Totally agree. Made a thread on it and got no attention, only two people saying that I was ungrateful. Total BS
---
How about a voice recognition app which tries to guess the card you're asking for based upon your impression of the the entrance/attack line?
---
Sort of a mix of Siri and /u/hearthscan-bot .
---
Or draw your whole deck like most combo druids do anyway.
---
You re doing a highlander deck You're probably doing a maly combo and using psychmelon to draw most of the pieces and probably jepetto joybuzz to find the rest (any missing legendaries or faceless manipulator) also most of what i listed is pretty value oriented minus maybe wrath and ferocious howl

At least it'll get a cool animation where it machine guns down the enemy minions.
---
This card isnt good
---
You're like the only guy who defends Warrior so kudos to you I guess.
---
Finally shaman gets the ability to upgrade their hero power
---
The Gorged anomaly gives +2 mana crystals and +1 from the Crystal Gem which means Loathebs every turn from turn 2.

The point is, Toasts actions had nothing to do with the community. Even if the majority had been negative, which it isn't, can't blame people for your own actions and feelings. He has to be responsible for himself.

Blizzard doesn't know how to write a Horde story without the Warchief a) going full mustache-twirling villain, b)dying, or c)both. The only exception is Thrall, who they had become a bitch and wander off for 6 years. Here's the recent history of the Horde: 
---
 Cataclysm: Thrall fucks off  
---
 Mists of Pandaria: - Garrosh goes megalomaniac, is killed  
---
 Warlords of Draenor: Brief respite from killing current-day warchiefs by killing alternate-past warchiefs  
---
 Legion: Vol'jin gets fucked at the literal opening cinematic to the Isles  
---
 BfA: Sylvanas currently going full megalomaniac, while in the background Blizz employees shout "trust us it isn't the same we prommiiisseeee". spoiler, it's the same.
---
I think people are more annoyed that the explorers got such limited design it would seem and thus it's easily to push that annoyance into the most obvious issue which is bombs.  
---
I'm hoping we'll see more mechanics/cards that will explain these design choices because as it currently stands the singleton concept isn't making sense.
---
Oh wow Highlander Paladin? Does upgraded hero power mean an upgraded class hero power such as Tank Up compared to Armor Up? Or are there new hero powers..
---
It comes at a huge cost though.  you can't run 2 masters call.  You can't run 2 kill command.  You can't run 2 springpaw.
---
And for what? 2 mana cheaper krush(which no one was running anyways) and a free 2/4?
---
Why would you run this over just running leeroy and get 6 charge damage instead of 8 from krush.  Its not like the HP matters if you are using your charge minion to kill them that turn.
---
Leeroy+hero power is 7 mana deal 8 to the face.  Brann gets you a 2/4 but your deck is now full of bad cards
---
odd paladin, here we go!
---
The best thing I've seen come out of a butt yet.
---
Right, that‚Äôs because Blizzard doesn‚Äôt have half a shit of a clue as to what they are doing.
---
Don't forget the Shaman murloc who gives you random murlocs
---
&gt; Nobody loves a weak ass mechanic.
---
*Angry Handlock noises*
---
If it was dropped to 6 mana, it actually would have been more flavorful (Reno + Discover works well) and fit better in the Highlander archetype because being able to discover some answers in the mid-late game helps make the deck more consistent if it can survive the early game. Plus it would curve neatly into Astromancer or a Giant + Conjurer's play while allowing you to play cards in previous turns, so there's synergy already.
---
As opposed to what we're getting which is basically a moderately-strong swing play and then...that's it. You have an okay body and half a deck of no duplicates that you still need to make a win condition out of.
---
So far I'd rather just open rares and epics
---
On first glance I thought the same thing, but then I considered it can duplicate legendaries which substantially increases its value
---
Dude for real you are going to have only one kill command, one springpaw, one hunter calling to have brann in your team? Nah man that is noy a good midrange hunter deck
---
6 mana, Pog. yes
---
If your deck contains no duplicates, gain armor equal to damage your hero has taken.
---
The one with three spells from the gatling Wanda was better
---
I don't think anyone thinks it's bad. It's just boring.
---
Problem is there isn't a reason to not run two conjurers callings yet.
---
According to VSreport, it is the most popular deck among all ranks and between ranks 4 and 1.
---
*in standard
---
I wish I had the knowhow to deepfake Brode's face into a video clip of that scene.
---
Yeah agreed that an early draw with Finley is your best shot (and he seems most fun to me anyway). It‚Äôs more sad that we just have 3 likely unplayable legendaries now filling this set.
---
This is like a vital situation to see if Hearthstone is able to thrive again. And they print four disappointing legendaries which can even be easily shut down by bomb warrior? I believe that more than half of the player base is no longer hyped about this expansion anymore.
---
How nice of Blizzard to print Wild legendaries.
---
Depends on the mechanic. Having two of a card that could remove duplicates from your deck would give you two chances to clear bombs out.
---
Elise+gloop can do crazy things but its the only one.
---
Pretty sure I had this issue. I signed into my account on another device, and I believe that solved it.
---
Was gonna say, we literally JUST had krush as an integral part of a tier 1 deck.
---
What could go wrong...
---
People are literally complaining about how bad they think they are.
---
It only targets minions...... [[reno the relicologist]]
---
This card sort of sums up how they're doing this set. A bunch of underwhelming revivals of past mechanics.
---
in wild, absolutely.  in standard, absolutely not barring some insane new highlander neutral.
---
Guess most of the hearthstone developers can't wait to join the Diablo Immortal team
---
I only see him seeing play if there is a neutral higherlander that is just silly strong that justifies the 1 of deck and brann is just in for the ride ( along with reno ). I think finley and Elise could find a home without but would benefit from this card as well
---
 they said there is one more Highlander coming so hope?
---
Well, it's not a 3-drop.  But best 3-cost minion maybe.
---
Yeah it could, but it would still only be a 1/3 chance like I said
---
All the worst parts about reno but with none of the good parts cool.
---
But the thing is, you don't have to rely on Reno for board clear. You can very well draw Blizzard or Flamestrike singleton. It's just a bonus support card/board clear for that archetype. I agree on: definitely would like to see more Highlander support to make this more reasonable to be built. 
---
As for Reborn, Mage has the ping, so if it reborns, you can finish at least one off (not a killer solution for Reborn, but particularily better in Mage)
---
Dyn-o-matic's other downside is against mirror Mech Warrior matchups, it's almost guaranteed useless. And Mech/Bomb Warriors aren't unpopular at this moment.
---
Even if you were a billionaire HS would be a waste of your money
---
Previous Reno was like you said very flexible, playable in all classes. But the new one is only mage exclusive and it'll generate only one, perhaps two decks. People will play the optimal teched netdeck version in the ladder. Flexibility (different techs) is going to be only in the tournaments e.i. the specialist format sidedecks. Class legendaries shouldn't define only one archetype, since being class specific is already a great restriction.
---
I think Fondle has the same wording and works, but I'd have to go back and check.
---
So they where like
---
 &gt;we really like king crush
---
 &gt;but hes shit, costing 9
---
 &gt;lets make it 7
---
 &gt;while we're at it give him a 2/4 body
---
Clever girl
---
The problem is that the effect needs to be far more powerful to justify having no duplicates in your deck. Dealing 10 damage split among enemy minions is nowhere near the power level of healing your hero to full health. Unlike old Reno, in standard this card alone absolutely cannot compensate for the weakness of having no duplicates. In wild it might be a good addition to Reno mage, but only because there is no downside to adding it to that deck, considering that you already have old Reno and Kazakus in it. But in standard it is far too weak.
---
Reno became an expert of rectums. Two thumbs up (you already know where they're going up).
---
Yah I can see stuff like that, but the problem is, it's still not unique or interesting. Duplicating things in your hand will lead to craziness but it's nothing we haven't seen before. This is our 3rd elise card, and compare it to the others. Opening a literal pack from the set. Going on a quest for treasure that changes everything into legendaries. It literally just doubles your hand. How could this be a fitting tribute to one of the more unique cards ever printed.
---
Maybe a lot of reduced mana malygos? Doesnt seens very consistent, but really cool
---
Worst case scenario: A solid 2 mana body on a 2 mana card. This passes Vanilla test regardless of the effect.
---
Even without the effect, this fills an important niche that Paladin is lacking at the moment. A solid 2 mana class minion drop.
---
its literally just puzzle box of yogg saron...
---
Most Highlander decks are control decks so targeting minions is what you want.
---
1 more
---
Huh. Maybe it was only if you bought the expansion? I cleared all 5 zones on the normal difficulty and after beating Khadgar I got a golden Classic pack.
---
I think the card is actually pretty good, a LOT better than people are giving it credit for. My only concern is that it's incredibly boring. IMO Mage doesn't really have a strong need to play 2 offs (unless your doing Conj. Mage of course). It's just so boring though...

Battlecry: Destroy extra copies of all cards in your deck.

there is no such deck in standart that slow to force you damaging your own minion to heal ob exact 5hp. it is only good if you have one of the big minions with [max hp - 3] and both faces are full hp. why would you heal your opponent? cos you dont have to put a card that replaces your decent hero power with almost useless one
---
Nice of Blizzard to also print cards meant for Wild players instead of just focusing on standard.
---
I have no issue with the highlander part of the cards. The boring part is the reward for having no duplicates.

---
Ah yes instead of new exciting mechanics let's just rehash old mechanics. What could possibly go wrong
---
I was going to try this when the expansion launches, but I can't seem to find poolG suoirolG s'poolF in the collection. Is it a new SoU card that was recently revealed?
---
So after seeing this card, I tried to make a highlander paladin deck just for fun, to see if the deck had any potential, even without the new set. You can make a solid tier 3 deck. It still auto loses to dr. boom, but it's fun I guess, curves out all right. But its power level is from the hearthstone past. It just can't keep up with the overpowered shit we have now.
---
It maters not if it get any support because best deck on ladder straight up counters it with bombs.
---
It's gotta be a jebait and something to make them worth it is coming. Letting a tier one deck that is currently warping the entire meta already dominate a new xpac before it even starts just seems too stupid
---
Most of the issue is likely that Hearthstone has been around for long enough that everything has a frame of reference.
---
The differences between Ragnaros and King Krush is that you can aim Krush (which is a benefit), Rag can remove a target without taking damage (if you get lucky), and Krush costs 1 more.
---
With this, Krush costs 1 less and comes with a 2/4.
---
I agree that this isn't enough to make a highlander deck good in standard, but it's way better than Rag.
---
Unless specific bomb tech becomes available or it‚Äôs nerfed. You can bet your ass some sort of bomb warrior will be relevant.  Warrior is just too versatile and bomb cards fit the curve well without losing tempo. It may diminish depending on how strong the set it but it ain‚Äôt going away
---
Bomb Warrior = nullified Singleton = dead on arrival
---
I gave it some thought and feel like this type of card really needs a win condition for control mage. It's a good stall card but that doesn't help out giant or cyclone mage with the no duplicates rule
---
Sir Finley for 0 mana in aggro decks that want a different hero power.
---
An expansion made for Wild, which is currently being overrun by Big Priest...
---
This is a great discovery but death of 5 minions in every cycle will take tremendous amount of time. Assuming playing with Claw, that's 15x5= 75 summoning and death animations. (With Moonfire against taunt, that makes 150 pair of animations.) Off.
---
I mean technically you could still run Masters Call and most of the time still draw 3, and worst case scenario you get to discover an extra Brann.
---
Agreed, but I don't see this reno being much better than blizzard for example, and the restriction of a highlander deck right now seems too much.
---
Renault Jacquesson
---
Yeah strong card
---
A lot of people will tell you that HS is low skill high RNG. But there are several factors to laddering proper and several skill sets that you might not have thought about. 
---
Dont play triggered. Always switch to another play mode after 2 loses in a row, or take a break. Try to learn what cards all the meta decks are using not just the ones you play. Anticipate and play around popular cards. Some decks are hard to pilot. Try a straight forward deck. If you keep running into the exact same deck and losing, look up the best counter decks on Hsreplay or VS. Use a deck tracker so you always know what you have left. Watch streamers and YouTube vids. I sub  to @dekkstergaming. He will actually talk to you on stream if you need help because he only has like 300 viewers max and the community is super helpful on chat. Have fun. If you find your entire HS experience is only ladder anxiety and rage, maybe play another game. It's not for everyone. Maybe MTG or another card game would suit you better. 
---
I am a f2p dad legend player. I have played since beta and this is by far my favorite game. I hope you have better luck in the future my friend.

---
10-4. It‚Äôs like I hit a wall. And arena I didn‚Äôt know if I wanted to play since it costs 150 or real money.
---
This definitely helps bomb warrior. If blizzard is trying to push Highlander decks, then of course the answer to them would be bomb warrior.
---
But you just pointed out why there is no reason to be excited for this card.
---
Bomb warrior.
---
And ok, let's pretend for a second that this card was not Reno. it was just some other offshoot legendary. People would absolutely like the card. But it isn't something to get your knickers in a twist over.
---
Now, let's go back to this being Reno. What do you think? Is he living up to the hype? Does his character scream "10 damage to all!?" Not really. Before he healed us from the brink of death. A true hero of heroes. This... meh.
---
Again. Powerful effect. But I don't think it is powerful enough that it will be a meta defining deck. I think people will try it and go back to Conjuring Mage, unless they give these highlander cards some serious non-highlander support (as there are no more highlander cards coming - aside from one maybe).
---
We‚Äôre still in a vacuum in terms of cards for the upcoming expansion though. There‚Äôs more than one way to support the Singleton archetype than by printing more Singleton cards.  What I‚Äôd rather see than people posting the same ‚Äúthey massacred my boy‚Äù meme is speculate what kind of cards would be good with these decks. We‚Äôve got a whole reveal season ahead of us. 
---
Regardless, I think that hearthstone is better with cards of this power level/deck building restriction. Over powered cards are bad for the game.
---
The one advantage that the 6 card version has is that you wont have board space issues. This is relevant because if the opponent has taunts then you'll often run out of board space ( because you won't be able to kill off your own floops with bees). If you don't have board space for all 4 bees, you wont have enough mana to continue the loop.
---
Just because a deck is highlander doesn't mean it automatically loses to aggro.  
---
Highlander Warlock completely dismantled aggro decks, for example.
---
wonder why it costs more in Europe
---
Even more relevant than it was, in fact.
---
Nothing changed with that card though...? Other than the **Enrage** keyword being replaced. That‚Äôs hardly a functional change though. 
---
 Are you referring to the [[Charge]] change from a few years ago? Because I do recall [[Raging Worgen]] being exploited with that for OTKs,  but that was a long time ago.
---
Duplatransmogrifier treasure. It‚Äôs a 4 mana spell that targets a friendly minion and changes all of the other minions in your deck into the target minion for the rest of the run.
---
Stream sniped
---
Next time I face rez priest I‚Äôm gonna use that strategy lol. It‚Äôs like 33% of what I face in wild is rez priest and sometimes I just can‚Äôt out tempo them.
---
Also, how is his weapon that same "gatling wand" he sported in the Trailer? This guy is an imposter!

Oh... nooo....
---
Reno, my boy - what have they *done* to you?
---
Solia is actually seeing more play now because they printed shit like Power of Creation. Also works with Kaz potions.
---
That being said Reno Mage is still a rare and underpowered archetype.
---
My mistake lad, confused nefarian and neltharion
---
Sorry, was wondering the search is based off?  Web Google? Or from your phone HS app?
---
Battlecry: remove all duplicates from your deck.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôm playing on mobile and I saw other screenshots of deck trackers. Maybe I need to get this off phone and on computer but this is how I like to play.   
---
  
---
I just know that if I want to continue playing I‚Äôm going to have to build a spreadsheet to do this thing right....
---
Something something Frindle
---
The most likely explanation is that they didn't see Bomb Warrior as a strong deck and because expansions are completed long before being released, they didn't realise that a no-duplicate meta couln't happen.
---
Midfight, Deathwing shows up with the black dragonflight and the two sides have to reluctantly join forces to stop this new bigger threat.
---
2 Brann 2 king krush sounds about right
---
Yes I know
---
Big Priest isn‚Äôt even tier 1 in wild
---
Pretty low quality shit post there, my dude.
---
Either warrior gets a buff because of it, or those decks are bad because of warrior. Not both.
---
They mistake is they didn‚Äôt balance it to meme/novelty level but to legit contender levels.
---
I honestly blame WC3 and SC:BW for all of blizzards writing issues.
---
They have written and interesting non corruption villain that I can think of.
---
The animation is awesome, I'll give 'em that.
---
So ?
---
Oh putting them in sleeves is a really good idea! I was just going to have them printed on cardstock or something, maybe glue em to cards. We used to make our own Pokemon cards by just gluing paper over the front of basic energy cards. 
---
I'm glad to hear proxies are so commonly accepted.
---
New Reno looks cool. I'm worried he has his arms covered though. What's trash is the Quest art.
---
It does not go face
---
I wish I could make this work. But the api doesn‚Äôt provide the card quotes. But you can shout out the name or any text on a card to Siri and she‚Äôll give you a list of cards.
---
read the title again?
---
Handlock isn't even a deck anymore lol
---
Scargill*
---
Why would you feel sorry for Whales that feel compelled to buy things before they even know what they're getting? It's just pure stupidity.
---
Yep, Druid is one of the weakest classes in the game after they gutted the classic set. Keeper should be unnerfed aswell.
---
Oh sorry. You should know, my idea of wild is anything is playable... because it is like the experimental ground where nothing really matters.
---
And as there is more support there, more card pool, I think in general highlander cards thrive better in wild.
---
2000 cards to pick from, or 1/4th that. Which do you think Highlander would do well with?
---
Nomi Priest is a relatively cheap deck since the only legendary it has is the titular Nomi itself. However Priest is pretty weak this set and the deck has a winrate of 42%
---
You could try some more controley build of mecha hunter with oblivitron, mechanical whelp and nine lives and only have Oblivitron as your legendary.
---
It can kill not just two... but THREE WHOLE KOR‚ÄôKRON ELITES!
---
It can't hit face though, so it's not really like cthun. More like dynomatic
---
Still waiting on mine...
---
I guarantee Elise will be used in combo decks. If you‚Äôre analyzing it as just copying a few random cards you‚Äôre not even close to tapping into the potential.
---
Way more of a combo card than value card, and Druid has proven to be pretty good with that style of play. Don‚Äôt even have to fill the singleton requirement since they‚Äôll be shooting to draw most of their deck anyways.
---
Blizzard just kinda forget bomb warrior exists
---
idk if it fits your definition of control but i went 11-2 from rank 13 to 10 with this 1520 dust resurrect priest deck

Yea. Glad I didnt jump on the preorder yet. Might be skipping this one. RoS was just much much better
---
Well, surely theyll be T1 on next expac
---
Reno the Rectologist
---
Fuck this, and fuck warrior, the most boring class in hearthstone
---
Seeing Reno as the mage hero made me do one big ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù
---
No, since I don‚Äôt own an Android device. But, someone posted a similar tool made for Google Assistant recently. That post actually inspired me to try and create something similar for iOS.
---
Dr. Boom is a card tweaked to be competitive with the obviously overpowered original DKs... except those already rotated, so it sticks out like a sore thumb, being clearly *way* out of line for the current power level in standard. Honestly, I think at this point the cleanest solution may just be to HoF all remaining hero cards (Boom, Zul'jin, Hagatha), even though especially Hagatha isn't necessarily overpowered. Outright nerfing it would just make it unplayable in Wild, while leaving it as-is is clearly an issue in standard.
---
Pyou can see it in wild where highlander is worth playing.
---
I wish they would make "your mechs have rush this turn" one of the hero power options or something. Make getting armor/value less common. It could be passive 0 mana for all I care
---
It might just support the class. But the point still stands that the four explorer sucks.
---
Not if the highlander decks are terrible, but [we have yet to see if that's true or not, one card remains unrevealed that supports highlander](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/cf07jx/there_is_one_as_yet_unrevealed_card_which/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) if that card is a dud then bomb warrior will orobably not be T1 next expac
---
It's the 4th most played deck, both in "rank 4 to 1" and "legend ranks"...
---
For the records: Given it's playrate, the odds of not seeing it once in 300 games is 1 out of 73 billions.
---
So, not impossible, but let's just say... A dubious claim.
---
&gt; I dont believe they go by how many 80g invites you got.
---
go back to my example. If the monthly average is like 3 or 4 invites, and someone is getting 40, it's not one single deviation off the bell curve average.  That's like, 5 or more deviations. It should happen super duper rarely, like 1 player in 10,000 or so. so OK, maybe they are a streamer or just know tons of people... but it still looks hinky, so maybe they take a look at the IP addresses of the accounts involved. 
---
If the IP addresses are all over the place, that's good and to be expected -- means they really are different individuals, like the blokes you accumulate on your friends list. If the IP addresses are the same, that means it's all one dude and his alt accounts. Then it's time to swing the banhammer. (and yeah I know VPNs are a thing -- if someone's resorting to sockpuppet alts and a VPN to wrangle some extra gold, shit, hats off to his competitive spirit)
---
Keep in mind, the friends list is capped at 200. I have 170 myself, all legit strangers that I list-invited or who invited me after a game, and I get maybe 5 to 8 invites a month. More than the average, I reckon, but not crushingly more. If someone is getting many many more invites than average, I figure that's worth looking into &amp; asking the player to explain themselves
---
Also, I will advise against upgrading to beta yet. It‚Äôs quite smooth but the battery life is pretty bad for me.
---
I kind of like that they're bringing back the no duplicates mechanic with this card.
---
And not even a good one at that; Most of these cards aren't even worth going with no duplicates.
---
They almost certainly have plans to add more of these cards in future expansion, so then it'd be worth it... But with these cards? Hard pass on most of them. Perhaps all of them.
---
Especially considering (as you said) a popular deck counters them, and if they grow in popularity people will just run more warrior; It's already a good deck, and if people start playing things it hard counters, its popularity AND winrate will both increase.
---
they might as well start looking into it right now
---
Tbh, even with the remaining neutral support, the point still stands that the four explorer is just bad and uninspired. Not worth building a deck around a legendary that deals 10 damage on minion.
---
Nah, clearly it's since his mount adds to his attack.
---
First of all, the notion that the game should be planned exclusively around the meta Rank 5+ is an absurd notion. 
---
Second, even at Ranks 4-1 in TODAY'S VS Report, Bomb Warrior is the second deck in Tier 1.
---
Third, they've already confirmed from the PC Gamer article today that no other support cards for Highlander decks are being printed in this expansion, so if this is all the benefit these decks are getting relative to the restriction and a deck that is currently T1 and losing nothing hands down mitigates all the benefits, that is a problem.
---
I love this game, I love highlander decks, but you writing off an incredibly legitimate and obvious concern about effectiveness of the flagship legendaries of the set is absurd. There is a easily identifiable and highly probably conflict here, likely due to the dev team's admitted surprise at the success of bomb warrior and the fact that sets are planned far in advance.
---
There's almost no card that could be introduced that would mitigate this concern, given that the entire archetype enabling this conflict comes from the most recent set. Get over yourself.
---
go here, and you can trade your quest and get 160 gold.

I dont play wild, I dont want to pay thousands of dollars on a digital card game thanks.  
---
Regardless- Dont design cards for wild, that's fucking stupid(no explanation needed)  
---
Midrange hunter uses Masters Call as A CORE of the deck.  
---
ie. you just spewed nonsense.
---
Why would you want to destroy duplicates in your deck if the condition is not having any duplicates in your deck?
---
What the fuck
---
The deck isn‚Äôt winning if people are actually prepared for it. The problem is that tue deck wasn‚Äôt played so people took out sideboard cards  vs it and it caught them by surprise.
---
...meh
---
You can't clear your own board with moonfires anyway because you have to play atleast 2 minions to have 4 moonfires
---
Probably only good in tempo mage. While its nice ti see some normal cards that arent game breaking for once like from old expacs, unfortunately the current powercreep might be too high for any of the main cast to see play.
---
Reno before Area 51
---
Reynaldo after Area 51
---
Many naturalizes?
---
I'd argue that mana cost = attack for finley seems consistent enough, but I understand the frustration
---
If your deck has duplicates destroy them!!!! Now any highlander card is playable.
---
Which getting abused right now with Elemental Evocation into Mountain.

[[Call to Adventure]] also
---
It doesn't matter just press the 2 button and beat him to death with an 8/8
---
Same for me. Honestly have barely played in the past year. Think its time for me to just give up and move on.
---
Well, that unrevealed card might be like "battlecry - remove/replace duplicates from ur/both deck". Will see.
---
This fucking sucks but it makes sense
---
A wild deck with Reno and ShivalanOTK combo?
---
How did this ÂìΩ come back‚Ä¶
---
ÔºàÂìΩ=memesÔºâ
---
Highlander Warlock was the most played Warlock deck for a long time, to the point where it's still being played in Wild. It was really really refined and well put together.
---
I'm talking about a bunch of super unrefined Highlander decks people throw together week one of the expansion. And I don't think there's nearly enough healing in Standard for a highlander deck to deal with all of the direct face damage Shaman can throw out.
---
&gt;Have a Reno deck
---
&gt;Queue up against warrior
---
&gt;Concede
---
Thank you Blezzurd
---
Let's break mechatun warlock ...
---
Yeah, like would it have been so problematic for this to be neutral?
---
I thought we were just talking about Recruit Warrior with like, Gather Your Party and Woecleaver.
---
*cough* mossy horror for spreading plague *cough*
---
This could actually be super interesting because you could use it in combo decks to thin your deck. Wild Mecha'Thunlock would be my first idea to raise consistency with Hemet.
---
Charging 8/8 on turn 7 without conditions? Sign me up.
---
oh damn you're right so thats 48 damage pog
---
I have never seen this situation before on this subreddit.
---
Even Shaman, Odd Rogue, Mech Hunter, Murloc Shaman and Combo Priest can all kill you very easily before this card comes down. There‚Äôs a reason why Reno decks are barely played in Wild anymore. But yeah, they‚Äôll at least be fun in wild, even if they‚Äôre not competitively viable.
---
No idea what you want to tell me.
---
And if you don't draw 1 none of your other highlander cards work.
---
Also, I think you could potentially run him in a deck with a few but not many duplicates,  and use him as a late game finisher, relying on card draw to get rid of your duplicates.
---
Twig and Naturalize is in wild but I like the idea.
---
If this card could hit face it would be absolute trash. It still isnt good without highlander support but this way it guarantees to clear any board below or at 10 health. Sure its situational but it can kill things like an entire Forest's Aid, most any zoo board, most midrange hunter boards as long as you kept it competitive in the early game and most murloc boards. I think this card is easily very strong provided that there is more highlander support that provides either a strong win condition or strong healing. Its just kinda lame and boring
---
I mean it make sense, when you look at how cards work.
---
But by releasing such cards ( no duplicate mechanics) in a meta where this mechanic can so easily be destroyed by a fairly present meta deck (bomb warrior), there are killing these legendaries before they even get a chance to be played.
---
I mean how sad would it be if neither of the expansion 4 main heroes' card see no play in the next meta.
---
Rafaam, Boom, Hagatha and Togwaggle have all found a place in many decks (rip Lazul)
---
murloc paladin comebacc
---
Not too bad in zoo, potential to duplicate leeroy and ziliax ( mech builds) etc. Also hits spells too, possible void contract shenanigans or extra nether.
---
Infinite \[\[Soulwarden\]\]? 
---
1. Discard \[*something cheap*\] with Shriek or Diretroll. 
---
2. Discard Soulwarden with this. 
---
3. Infinite \[*something cheap*\].
---
And you can zola it for an additional 2 guldan, nzoth, voidlord etc
---
&gt; I wanted different card art
---
I like the card art, I think it makes Reno look like a Mage, which is good because it is a Mage card.
---
&gt; I wanted the card to be different 
---
I like the card effect, I think it is a strong card with a consistently useful effect. In addition, the alternate cards are "unique" but random (inconsistent) which is a big risk to take for building a highlander deck. We could debate all day about predicting the power level or flavor level of this/alternate versions. 
---
**Reno The Relicologist just isn't a card for you and that's OK because RTR appeals to other people, and there are other cards that will (hopefully) appeal to you this expansion. Everyone has cards they like or dislike.**
---
Honestly, that's my favorite suggestion
---
It's a relevant one too, congrats. My golden legs have always been garbage (blingtron, knuckles, nat pagle and nozdormu TWICE).
---
You won't include Soulwarden in a wild deck since it is just way too slow. I'm doubtful if you even want this card in wild since one Gul'Dan and one N'Zoth is usually enough to destroy anything. Wild is too fast to become a greed-fest where you want need or can be greedier than other late-game strategies without seriously crippling your winrate.
---
Boom is definitely a problem. Blizzard needs to go full rogue and nerf boom, omega assembly and devastator. Ultimately the root of all the issues is Dr boom. While 1 mana add 3 mechs to your hand is already bonkers, it's only insanely so because all 3 automatically have rush from boom. Likewise, the main issue with devastator is that he has rush (from boom) and is also easily discoverable leading to multiple copies (from assembly and boom hero power). All 3 of these cards build off each other (with boom being the centrepiece) and all 3 of them being nerfed is completely justified if you ask me.
---
Finally warlocks gets something fun.
---
Alright so what if this effect is actually the last highlander support we are getting (they said one more neutral). Deals with bombs (atm seems like bomb warrior kinda screws highlander) and makes the weaker highlander effects make more sense, because its still certainly a drawback but not as massive.
---
All that text on the weapon is just a minefield tho
---
There is a card called maiden of the lake, but lady of the lake could be new...
---
The route i propose you get a weapon as a result which literally just says lifesteal on it, seems much simpler to digest.. and it kind of makes more sense as a process to me...
---
An alternative idea, card text says: dormant, use you hero power twice to awaken
---
Then has lifesteal on a separate line
---
It kind of goes against any excalibur lore.. as brute force wouldnt be able to pull the sword from the stone..but using ur hero power to pull the sword has some logic and adds interesting flavour, building on ur dormant idea...
---
&gt;  And you should NOT try to make it incompatible with existing turors.

4/3/3 Demon | Battlecry: Draw the lowest Cost minion from your deck.  
---
Am I getting meme'd here?
---
I really disagree. Discover a card is worth close to 2 mana. Mage spells mean it is 2 mana or slightly more. I could see people paying 6 mana to discover 3 mage spells. So you get a nice body for 1 additional mana
---
Godfrey is really good for his ability to clear sticky death rattle minions. Probably a second twisting nether would be a decent, only slightly inferior, version
---
Your highlander cards have +1 attack.
---
You can laugh, but after playing decent amount games with Conj Mage, I have to say that it's not just 1 less mana, it's 1 turn earlier to do Mountain + Conj combo, which is huge.

I don't think Highlander cards are even worth playing in this meta if we don't get a good heal, which I doubt we'll see due to wild balance.
---
Also seeing it on Android. 
---
Seems to trigger the download every time I switch back and forth between WiFi and mobile data. Very annoying.
---
Cursed blade is LoE.
---
whoopsie, right!
---
No it should be 1/9+1/8+1/7 because the second and third option can't pick a duplicate
---
Considering pala's card draw and removals have been consistently gutted, I don't see how crystology can be any kind of problem. I have yet to see brawl, cleric, hyena, apprentice and edwin nerfed from the classic set.
---
Seems really good in even warlock too. duplicating giants
---
This post isn't talking about a hard counter to bomb warrior, it's talking about a way to play a highlander deck without being crippled by bomb warrior
---
Just play big shaman for the dalarna heist. I played it for every normal and heroic boss and it was a breeze.
---
Depends on the deck, which you are hiding for some reason.
---
Plus it's a 4/4 body left on board. Godfrey is really hard to replace.
---
Hes still jacked
---
This plus Cube works or nahh ?
---
Right?
---
It's even a good defile kickstarter.
---
Just you wait, my Reno Odd Mage will crush you! \&gt;:)
---
0 spell damage = 0 Reno damage
---
I thought Hearthstone was trending in a positive direction the past two months. Dalaran was a good set too. But I'm with you so far on the cards revealed ... Very hum drum. Nothing grabs me much.
---
P.s. ive definitely net decked, but the overwhelming majority of stuff i play is off meta and either entirely homebrew or heavily modified... I'd find it incredibly dull to play the net deck stuff..
---
At the moment its elemental evolve shaman.. might have to go back to dragons though.. they were more successful... i made legend with a homebrew odd druid that i loved (and got wrecked by nourish nerf).. before the year rotation big beast ressurect priest was go to and super strong (rip devilsaur :'()
---
Obviously not necessarily just for combo, but that's almost certainly going to be its primary use. And I'm talking about the flavour of shuffling a treasure into your deck and then searching for it; arguably both previous Elises have just been value generaters, but they had fun, flavourful mechanics which I think this one lacks.
---
Thanos the Purger
---
It‚Äôs funny that they‚Äôre using horrible vanilla cards to show off his ‚Äúpower‚Äù lul blizzard you can‚Äôt fool us with pretty lights. (Okay still was a slick animation though)
---
\[\[Witchwood Piper\]\] and \[\[Call to Adventure\]\] are the first two tutors I think of
---
depends on your definition of worth:  
---
is it worth to you paying extra for sustainable food products? probably.  
---
is it worth to pay double the marketprice for a wrecked car cuz thats the price that was named and you accepted it? unlikely.  
---
now is it worth paying 80 bucks for a fraction of a DLC? like can you truly say from the bottom of your heart that the pricing is reasonable?
---
I pretty much only play Reno decks for wild,, even in classes that don‚Äôt get extra Reno support.  I just really enjoy the flex you get in highlander decks.
---
Reno mage still does fairly well, even though it‚Äôs not necessarily the strongest Reno deck.  I have seen it more than quest actually, but maybe at 5+ there‚Äôs more quest.
---
Why is this being downvoted? He made a fair point.
---
It's not. Here's the definition used in MTG for example for a strictly better card: https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Strictly_better
---
New Reno and blizzard are incomparable in those terms, because you can easily identify situations where one card is better than the other.
---
But highlander hunter is really bad
---
And I explained Elise's new flavour as burgeoning power as she gets out into the field more and more.
---
Plus, the League of Explorers are evidently becoming more attuned with working with one another, if they're all supporting the Highlander archetype. Truly, they're one-of-a-kind characters.
---
And a boar!
---
Finally a wincon after ive gained 2500 armor with beeeeees
---
5 cards in hand it's also draw 5.
---
Pretty powerful.
---
Wow... Both underwhelming and boring
---
You just play it on 2 or 3, pray to God, trade it and follow up with turn 4 and 5 giant
---
What about Jaraxxus tho
---
Turn 5 frost nova doomsayer into this turn 6 for 15 face damage?  That‚Äôs insane.
---
Hell, it‚Äôd probably too strong if it hit face with just the 10 damage.
---
Druid is best.
---
What was your deck list?
---
Why would that have been so bad though? Not exactly a broken combo, especially given the Highlander restriction.
---
To be fair even if the deck has some really good cards it wouldn't be nearly as oppressive without the hero card and if they didn't expect Dr Boom to break the meta they weren't paying attention during the previous year.
---
&gt;infinite Value Mage Quests
---
imho Random mage spells are pure garbage 50% of the time.
---
Also not really making sense for a super combo when it's just giving you the copy you could have put in your deck anyway.
---
&gt;Highlander decks can't be built strongly about synergies anyway.
---
Have you seen Renolock? Play Wild some time, of course that's not a hard fast rule.
---
When this gets taken down by the jannies of the sub (they do it for free), come post it on r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Thanks, permutations and combinations mathematics is really useful and very easy to learn, a lot of problems even become inherently obvious when you get the hang of it because it simplifies down very well.
---
In this example, I didn't even do any of the maths that I commented out to start with, I simply did
---
(3/9)*100% = 33.33%
---
Which can be used in the same way for many problems like this with a constant probability.
---
The same example again with 3 options from a total population of 4
---
(3/4)*100% = 75%
---
but that was before the druid nerfs
---
Conjurer is not the problem it's the freaking giants. They are all over the place cause they just give too much.
---
Just in case people don't realise, this is a custom card I made a while ago.
---
It's similar to a new card, though not quite the same.
---
&gt; Honestly i don't get why some people call this reno weak
---
Because you have to build an entire deck around it. If you want a board clear mage already has plenty of options available.
---
I cannot view imgur :(

[https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6806-new-warlock-card-revealed-expired-merchant](https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/6806-new-warlock-card-revealed-expired-merchant)
---
For those who want to see the ACTUAL card in question
---
Took me 10 seconds to put in "this weeks tavern brawl" into the search bar.
---
That assumes that the "random factor" is a downside. If your hero power was one of the worst ones then the discover although random makes it way better. Although Paladin hero power is one of the better ones for board focused midrangey decks.
---
One of the overall best hero powers in dalaran Heist is the hunter one that gives you a 1 mana minion. It's strong on its own but there are tons of treasures and cards that synergize well with it, for example the treasure that makes your hero power cost one less and usable twice a turn. Or the treasure that gives you 2 armor whenever a minion of yours dies. I'd try that hero to beat the final heist. As for the deck pick the one that has scavenging hyena, it's a solid starter.
---
if this is true, they shouldn't have. reno paladin in standard needs all the help it can get, if that means giving it effectively a second copy of finley for +1 mana, that's fine.
---
Also discard enemy hand, shuffle 10 bombs and give a slap irl
---
Please Ctrl+Alt+Del yourself from the internet. Thank you very much.
---
Maybe I am wrong regarding my opinion of the card, but I am not wrong regarding the definition of Strictly.
---
I don't think so. The quest is to play 5 Reborns, there are 4 minions on the board, and the Murmy is the 5th one. They all have the same blue effect.
---
I'm pretty sure the armor part wasn't the overpowered part.
---
It's basically this imo. Dodging crystology is a side effect
---
They will synergize with the other legendary.
---
This is really, really good. This + Mortal Coil is 3 mana draw 3 cards, two of which are probably going to be one of your late-game value bombs. If they give Warlock any more healing it will have the tools to be THE late-game control deck.
---
Skulking geist was not played that much even when Jade druid was oppressive. It saw play, sure. But that was only because it was not toally dead against any other class.
---
I need to see the work on 2&gt;1 I'm still lost.
---
Keep in mind he would only hit pally hp 1/3 times, so it would lack the synergy with the deck that made Baku that much more oppressive
---
It could also be a question of redundancy: Why not run both?
---
There has to eventually be a point where it reaches critical mass, where they print enough strong 1-drops (especially neutrals) that pure face decks become viable again.
---
What's currently missing from the equation is one or two really aggressive 2-drops, but if that gets released in the coming days then we might again see a meta where aggro decks carve out a spot in the meta.
---
But you can combo that with some strong deathrattles, the idea behind a prelated undertakah is to give him deathrattles that stick and to keep stacking them, or to buff him like the immortal prelates but paladin has so few buffs you're gonna spend most of those on the prelates in my experience
---
I mean, I hope you're right. But based on previous experience, I doubt it.
---
Probably should think before you hit post.
---
To My Side!
---
But to tell the truth it was the first Kobolds cards to be revealed. Nobody really expected the very strong class set for hunter. Flanking Strike, Candleshot, Rhok'delar, Spellstone, Wandering Monster, Kathrena. It was a real strong set.
---
Did you just post a screenshot of your own tweet?
---
Hm‚Ä¶ the card art is a bit too trivial to be a collectible in my opinion‚Ä¶ maybe we are seeing the return to hand(buff) Pally and these are tokens that are added to your hand like the Sandwasps.
---
I did one in 24 minutes, got the same award.
---
set
---
This.
---
Seems like a really underwhelming quest that forces you to play bad cards from this very expansion.
---
The latter, you can watch the reveal vid for the warrior reborn guy
---
Emperor Wraps is actually insane value
---
Trading 80g quest.
---
NA - Kent#12441.
---
You go first for fast trade.
---
I go first, show your quest in-game and reddit account 3+ yrs old. Cheers
---
2/5 taunt should be 3 mana  
---
1/2 should be 2 mana
---
3 taunts in the way.
---
Ok, I see the point.
---
Although previous versions with Reno that tried to draw their duplicates first were quite bad, I agree that with combo it can make some sense.
---
IIRC, Khadgar works on itself once, so it should go: Brann summons King Crusher, first Khadgar duplicates Brann's summon, second Khadgar duplicates Brann's summon and also duplicates first Khadgar summon.
---
I am not 100% sure about this though
---
Lol it deactivated a single copy of a legendary in your deck if we‚Äôre talking standard. And I‚Äôm not sure but is bomb warrior relevant in wild? In either case, even if this card existed, it would 100% not be worth running in your deck. The legendary highlander payoff cards would have to have effects like ‚Äúwin the game‚Äù basically to warrant this level of teching, but they are actually pretty mediocre instead.
---
&gt; If a card looks simple it doesn't means it is.
---
Yes, it does.
---
What you describe next are card interactions, not a card itself.
---
The whole "complexity and depth" thing. This card isn't complex, it's simple. But it has depth.
---
And that's good design.
---
&gt; This will be incluided in any murloc deck for the next two years. 
---
And?
---
&gt; This card does to much for 1 mana. 
---
Mecharoo and Possessed Villager already exist. So does Argent Squire.
---
This isn't much different at all.
---
&gt; I think it should either cost 2 mana 
---
Hooray, you just did what oldschool Team 5 might have done and absolutely butchered a card.
---
&gt; Anyway it seems to be some new early taunts this expansion so maybe just maybe this won't end up into the aggro shit-show
---
This card has to compete with Mecharoo, which has a ton of Mech synergy already going for it. You're worried about Murlocs when the only Murloc deck that will probably be viable is one that is *already viable,* because of Underbelly Angler.
---
It's not going to be an "Aggro shitshow" because they printed an iteration of cards they've already printed, rofl. I know you're a Control elitist but chill out.
---
Reborn minions are re-summoned with one health remaining, as evidenced by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8cePfIa-Xw. Jump to 4:10.
---
Do you mean alt+f4, or ctrl+w
---
I am just wondering if you even read my comment past the first sentence .
---
&gt; i don‚Äôt recall anyone ever complaining its boring to play with or against.  
---
Neither do I and I certainly didn't in my comment.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs strong but it never felt oppressive.  
---
Lol, tell that to all the aggro and midrange decks that got instantly shut out of the game when Reno Jackson was played. It probably never felt oppressive to you because you weren't playing those types of decks. I will give you Kazakus though, that card never felt oppressive to any type of deck.
---
&gt; I think almost everyone agrees renolock is pretty skill intensive and you need to make many decisions in game, whether to hellfire this turn, fight for board, whether to life tap etc. Its definitely not an auto-pilot to victory deck. 
---
Again, I also think Renolock is a pretty skill intensive deck hence why I never mentioned skill in my comment. My issue with Highlander decks is the high rolly nature of them, not the skill level required to play them. A deck can be both skill intensive and high rolly, see Cyclone Mage.
---
That's racist dude. In the eyes of the Ben Brode, all minion tribal are equal.
---
You are crazy bro.
---
You can just drop this one 2 and be super happy every time. It's an insanely better loot hoarder.
---
Much better to do this sort of stuff with friends or on a rank floor
---
Haha, I was really only targeting you cause of the first guy, and you send angry replies very  consistently. It was never really about the cards üò≥
---
New Finley tho
---
I mean they should of used league of explorers
---
Good shout
---
&amp; loads of new pally minions too (not that I imagine they'll be played at this rate). Coil stocks are up!
---
I think people will still complain if it's that one, discover 3 cards. But it sure make a better card than what we have.
---
2 mana and 3 mana respectively.
---
It's 3 guaranteed.
---
And you see, this is where Toki comes in.
---
There must always be a lich king
---
Volcano hits your board. Arcane Missles does not.
---
7/7 for like four Mana maybe?
---
The 2/5 would be insane at 3 mana as a neutral. Sludge Belcher was 5. It‚Äôll probably be 3.
---
My rule is "if in doubt leave it out". It's as simple as that. I wish more people would just do this. It is much nicer to read something with a missing comma than reading something with an extraneous comma.
---
Keleseth was revealed before the other two, I thought.
---
Overkill only triggers during your turn, not on attack. Think of cards like totemic smash or baited arrow those cards can't attack.
---
&gt;Probably still worse than Baleful Banker as it requires 2 cards to combo
---
Sure, but it also makes you draw (sorta) 3 cards. Banker doesn't do that. I'd also argue it's more consistent since
---
1) you can hit any card, not just minions
---
2) the minion has to survive a round/be cheated out if you want to use Baleful Banker
---
In the collection manager it probably will include it if you hover over the card, similar to other cards that have given you a different hero power
---
Is that a new tribe on the highlighted card? If thats french, it translates to undead. Maybe we'll see undead synergy too?
---
You‚Äôre using logic (very well I might add, great point you raise). OP is using emotion. They want the feel good of the KO punch
---
You must be reading reddit far too much to see this many reposts it's not meant to be a hobby in itself
---
Absolutely not. We dont want to repeat the mistake of the previous reno where if you drew him on 6 any aggressive deck loses to the point where they had to make aggro decks into hyperaggro decks just to keep up. And noone wants Pirates 2.0.
---
skull of man'ari
---
Although, Voidlord didn't exist yet.
---
I think brann will see someone trial it, and Finley will get tried out cuz he can (hopefully) drop before a bomb comes into place. But otherwise they will be useless unless blizzard prints a card specifically used to destroy duplicate cards in a deck
---
Start of the game: if your deck has no duplicates, upgrade your hero power :p
---
I‚Äôm very aware about all of this I‚Äôm just saying dynomatic would be an extremely different card with possible face damage
---
Yes, as I imagine it isn't good in aggro, it would be more combo or control.
---
Now this is really smart.
---
He's saying T1 new finley (if it had been a 1 mana 1/3) T2 use upgraded hero power.
---
You definitely *could*, especially if you got taunt on it then it being a 2/2 really isn't that big of a deal. However the bigger thing is that Undertakah Paladin doesn't really need extra Undatakahs so it doesn't seem worth the investment.
---
&gt; Most of the time 
---
He straight up said that sometimes it is ran.
---
Also, your reasoning is stupid. It's like saying I put Cheerios on my sushi, someone says it doesn't belong there, and get offended that someone says something about the abnormality of it. You do you, but no need to be offended and condescending.
---
It's because he's been working out since LoE.
---
Porning twice is better than porning once.
---
Less so since I am already ignoring 1 drops, I am not sure if I could afford to skip out on 2 drops.
---
No. It isn't. This isn't complicated. You're trying to be smart and you're failing miserably. Language is fluid. If a word has a meaning that's not part of its definition in some specific sport or hobby or and is commonly used that way, that's what it means in that context. 
---
Even ignoring that very obvious piece of information that you somehow can't grasp, you're not even using it correctly. If you said "strictly better" and meant "better", then that was just completely unnecessary. It added exactly nothing to your statement. If you were using it to add some meaning beyond just better, then you probably should have used a different word. "Strictly" has the definition of "with no exceptions". I gave you tons of exceptions. You're wrong. Get over it. Take an English class above remedial 10th grade English.
---
No way can you play a highlander midrange deck, hitting your curve and your good cards is way too important in that archetype.
---
Reno Hunter in Wild might be interesting, but I think that needs a better card than this to be anything more than a meme deck.
---
I agree.
---
Probably good cards to go with the reblob quest
---
First time, huh?
---
&gt; Actually the second most popular Murloc Shaman list in the meta right now runs 2xMurloc Raider.
---
And look at its drawn/played winrate.
---
[The top 10 decks that use Underbelly Angler all run 0 Murloc Raiders.](https://hsreplay.net/cards/51724/underbelly-angler#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD&amp;tab=recommended-decks&amp;sortBy=winrate)
---
The best decklist with Murloc Raider has a 57% winrate (all 10 decks I linked to had 58-59%), but Murloc Raider is the sixth worst card in the deck when it comes to both played and drawn winrates.
---
&gt; When opting for more of a face deck approach, those are the first cards you would cut out of your decklist anyway.
---
Absolutely, but as I've pointed out, I don't think you're going to see face decks of *that* level of aggression any time soon.
---
The fact that the other decks are more successful than ones that run Murloc Raider make me lean towards this.
---
Granted, Murmy will buff this face Murloc Shaman deck all the same. I just don't think that's particularly promising *all things considered.* If Murmy is the only addition (we'll have to wait and see) then chances are other decks are going to exceed it.
---
&gt; Look at the strongest Aggro decks we've seen in the meta before: Aggro Shaman, Pirate Warrior, Odd Hunter. 
---
Odd Hunter was not one of the most powerful. Secret Paladin was more powerful than Odd Hunter was, and it relied far more on curving out.
---
Odd Paladin was a much more successful Odd deck, and both it and Odd Rogue ran card generation. Paladin ran Stonehill Defender, and Odd Rogue ended up running Myra's Unstable Element, as well as Blink Fox.
---
A full frontal face deck that ignores power house cards like Crystology or Swampqueen Hagatha are probably putting themselves at a disadvantage. Yes, that Murloc Shaman list is the second most popular. But it's not the second most powerful.
---
Wild \[\[fist of jaraxxus\]\] machine gun deck here I come

Not every legendary card needs to be designed with the present state of the meta at release in mind

If your deck has no duplicates gain charge (can't attack heroes this turn)

4/-/- | When you play or discard this, deal 4 damage to a random enemy.

Gotcha, that‚Äôs what I expected, but thanks for the additional evidence.

Dude you have a handlock deck??? I‚Äôve been wanting to go back to handlock! Any tips on a good handlock deck? I‚Äôve been doing zoolock and it‚Äôs okay but handlock is my fave archetype
---
3 mana for a 2/5 + 2/1 is insane. Put together it'd be a 5 mana minion, splitting it over 2 bodies (which isn't neccesarily a downside thanks to Taunt) won't discount it by 2 mana.
---
&gt;"if at turn 2 I have this card, then I won, otherwise my deck is crap".
---
It's the return of Keleseth.
---
Missed opportunity to not make him riding a Hungry Crab.
---
It was on the wrong eye before, which is what made him a 1/3.
---
Now it's on the correct eye so he is a 2/3.
---
The worst tech ever
---
I doubt they'd make 2 identical minions and give 1 +1 health &amp; limit it to a class. At least not in the same expansion.
---
OP‚Äôs exaaaaaaaaggeratingggg
---
I don't remember the order, I just remember they all came out in a relatively small window of time. People were making reddit posts grouping them together and saying Blizzard was shit at creating cards.
---
Here's an example of a typical Reddit post you'd see around that time:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6q633v/what_is_the_point_of_the_prince_cards/
---
Buy hey, that's just a theory
---
Or the heightened feeling of satisfaction from pulling it off against someone with more intelligence than a bar table.
---
*if you have no duplicates in your deck 
---
;)
---
For real though, those are your only options if this combo gets assembled. Even with 60 damage on board, you would need 40+ turns just to break through the armor.
---
I like how the majority of reddit comments came up with a better quest ideas for paladin than blizzard. This has zero synergy with the other paladin cards we've seen thus far (typical) and it's completely reliant on there being enough good reborn minions to fill out the core of the deck with them.
---
Not the point.

That's what Blizz thought when printing Skulking Geist which affected Evolve Shaman too at this time
---
Mecharoo didn't see play until mechs decks see play.

reborn is just a boring rename for deathrattle, change my mind (feels like they wanted to steal embalm from mtg but without a proper graveyard it ended up as a boring "we dont name it deathrattle but it is just that" thing)
---
Deathrattle... Paladin? I can dig it!
---
You don't see such dumb shit posted every day
---

---
Ooze can't be really called a tech card, it's just generic weapon removal. A good example of a tech card would be [[Skulking Geist]] or [[Eater of Secrets]], both of which saw play when the mechanic/deck they counter rose in popularity.
---
Afterall, tech cards are sometimes just a failsafe to make sure a specific deck archetype doesn't run rampant. What you are asking for is basically a solid card with an upside.
---
5 stars - I see this being played in every deck including Big Priest. Definitely the sleeper of the card expansion, can‚Äôt wait to see what else is in store for Sailors of Urinal!
---
Most aggro decks don't play Mecharoo. Only full mech decks play it.
---
I wouldn't say they are basing those classes around highlander decks. They all got one card and a neutral card. Paladin also has reborn and 1-health minion synergy so far and we haven't seen much of the other 3 classes yet.  I'd be surprised if any of those cards are the ones that see play when the meta settles but we need to see more cards

I don't get how people think this is even a solution.  Are you really going to jank up your deck even more with this specifically for one matchup?  And in that matchup, your already mediocre highlander effect is still harder to get off because now it requires drawing two one-ofs.  I'd rather just hope to get the effect off when there's 0-1 bombs in my deck than double down with this.  You shouldn't be all in on the highlander effects anyway.
---
Zalae playing cube lock to rank 1 legend as everyone else experiments with new cards from witchwood expansion/rotation. That guy.
---
Earth shock in a vacuum has always been ridicolously costeffective vs divine shields, deathrattles, buffs and so on. The card in itself is incredibly broken and based on hex/polymorph costing 4, I would not be surprised to see this nerfed to cost 2 mana. 
---
This is a weaker version of hex in some cases, but in most cases an earth shock is as good as a hex. 
---
But it's 3 mana cheaper.
---
Its basically like this every expansion welcome to reddit lol
---
I guess that may have been a poor example, then. It was the first card I thought of that damaged random enemy minions and not random enemies. I do feel that the random minions part of the card is what makes it so good, even if it fails in some circumstances, and that it would be worse if it damaged random enemies.
---
This is what needs to be done honestly. It's like the only thing I can think of that won't make the new expansion a complete waste of everyones time. No point in experimenting with new cards if everything is still just an auto loss to warrior.
---
This design team sucks ass.
---
Missed your earlier post, request sent
---
This but unironically
---
...right now. The card isn‚Äôt going away soon.
---
If anything then the card was designed to keep Jade Druid in place and there were still plenty of Jade effects around to not cripple the class.
---
But hey, let's remove Holy Wrath from the deck...the only win condition for OTK Paladin. Or let's take Myras away. Huge win condition for Rogue.
---
Huge difference...VERY huge difference.
---
Depending on your deck, Jepetto can be deceivingly good. If your deck doesn't run impactful battlecry/deathrattle kind of stuff Blingtron is far better even though it's highrolly. Never pick the 3rd one, worst thing you could ever pick other than Duskfallen Aviana, literally.
---
Completely agreed. The mount adds to his offensive ability only. And it's a spider looking thing, a +1/0 is perfect.
---
Maybe when picking artworks they should choose ones that are framed better? We will never see that hat in the game so the edit fits fine.
---

6 Mana minion, Battlecry: Set both players Mana to 6 (or 5)
---

---
I disagree. The condition is kinda interesting (though it's not the first time), but the new Battlecries are not.
---
And make sure my opponent has to sit still while I wave it in his face for 90 seconds!
---
if you smell this coming you can stop it with ooze, weapons project, plague of madness, blingtron or Harrison Jones.
---

4/2/2 | Deathrattle: Give two random friendly minions +2/+2.  
---
I agree. Playing against control warrior is just as awful as it's always been. Conjurer mage and able to refill whole hand mage with cyclone is just silly. I've moved to mainly MTG for variety and it's been great. None of these new cards revealed are exciting to me at all.
---
Im assuming it doesn't work with giants because every other car in hs takes into consideration only the discarded amount not the original. For example magic carpet gives rush and plus one attack to any one cost minion even if it wasn't originally one cost. But the only way to know for sure is to test it out ingame
---
I guessed it was because he‚Äôd grown stronger.
---
Yeah, like literally 3/4 of the expansion has yet to be seen and people are already conplaining big-time, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to show the most exciting cards at the end? (I know the explorers should be like the most exciting but I‚Äôm sure there will be more support for them in later expansions)
---
Thanks for the correction lol. I thought it was deal 10 damage to all enemies.
---
China has a different standard of ethics than we do and only frown on cheaters when they're caught.
---
Thats false. Reno was a novelty until he got big support in MSoG -- ironically a few months before he rotates.
---
No im not.
---
"Oh yes, the guy is using the button that gives him to save both of us time on cost of the 15 minute im trying to summon 4 velens to do an otk...20minutes later... Oh yes again this guy will do the same thing good for them saving there time and not wait only around 30 second so i can have fun completing my combo, let them keep doing it"
---
If you have two bombs in your deck before you play this you've probably already lost anyway.
---
Shaman now has the ultimate hate card that hits resurrect, mech/magnetize, reliance on any non-murloc synergy like beasts, deathrattles, anything that cheats out high cost minions and/or makes duplicates of them, hand and board buffs, reborn keyword, etc for 3 mana and you can run two. Yikes. I'm praying it gets heavily nerfed.
---
True. But a second Gul'Dan has a higher percentage to lowell with Voidwalkers.
---
This may be my favorite quest.  That hero power can be insane on deathrattles, mechs (egg mech comes to mind) and reborn minions.
---
Your salt is delicious
---
Oh, I meant for this comment, it didn't have at the time.
---
Jade Druid in KFT really made me dislike the game if I'm honest. I was fine with MSG Jade Druid because, even though it was typically play the highest cost card in your hand to win the game, I still felt that there were decisions to be made as to how fast you ramped and spent your resources. Then UI and Spreading Plague came along and druid turned into race to 10 mana with little to no punishment for incorrect plays.
---
You could have taught a pre-schooler to play the biggest card every turn and they'd probably still hit rank 5 consistently.
---
But reno is a good card.
---
If you need 400 dust.
---
Oger
---
No way you wouldn't run both
---
Flair checks out.
---
Completely agree! It kinda frustrates me that Jades and MSG in general became this posterboy for everything bad and oppressive in this game, while the truth is the deck was fine and easily beatable before KFT came, which is IMO by far the worst expansion in terms of design, followed by Kobolds.
---
Ah fair, but also Dr. Boom's hero power has a 20% chance of being Blast Shield when you first play him, then a 25% chance of being Blast Shield if it was something else on the previous turn, and a 0% chance if it was Blast Shield on the previous turn. So all in all you only have Blast Shield 50% of the time at best, and 0% of the time at worst. Whereas if the hero power was just Gain 5 armor then you could hit the button every turn and your opponent would have to do 5+ damage to you every turn or lose to fatigue, which is incredibly unfair, so Trump's criticism is actually perfectly fair.
---
&gt;in wild no. a undertsatetd minion that you need to use 2 of to disable highlander and then they can draw 1 and highlander works anywya. its not bad from dr.boom but maindecked nah.
---
bomb warrior is terrible in wild.
---
We're you playing hearthstone at the time?
---
Murloc shaman is already great.
---
A 10 mana 13 damage combo is actually pretty weak and way too slow not to mention you're forced to not play \[\[Dire Frenzy\]\] which is one of hunter's best cards currently for a minion wasn't that good even when cheated out for 6 mana so yeah...
---
Did the same hahahah
---
It's pretty good against late game small boards but Reno mage doesn't have enough support in standard and in wild the deck is gonna need a hell of a lot more than one decent card to be playable again.

4/-/- | Give a Beast +3/+3. Shuffle 3 copies into your deck with +3/+3.  
---
Harvest golem don't see play. But with how weak paladin is, if it is 4 mana, this won't be played ever. Paladin needs cards better than the avg manacurve.
---
Murloc Shaman:
---
\#ITS FREE REAL ESTATE
---
Yeah but on an empty board it just be pyroblast + 4/6 body
---
It was true only at the beginning, when Reno was first released. Like Reno Warlock with 2x Voidcaller.
---
But people quickly realized that you couldn't realistically run more than 2-3 dupes anyway, and running those didn't increase your win rate enough to off-set the fact that you could get screwed and not have your Highlander card active in time.
---
Virtually all of the later versions of Highlander decks played 30 unique cards. 
---
In other words, it's a non-issue.
---
I dont think so
---
I think me completing my combo im trying to achieve and my opponent wait for around 30 second so i can land it is pretty fun.
---
I didn't downvote your comment.
---
I think blizzard is starting a pattern of cards that summon op 8/8s
---
Level Up! - Quartermaster without a body? Literally unplayable. Will never see play. It turns it was the glue that held odd pally back in the day as a finisher and a comeback mechanic. Also there was an advantage of it being a spell instead of a minion in that you can play it on a full board.
---
&gt;  people want interesting cards. I didn't say interesting cards will be played or are automatically powerful.
---
I'd argue that if interesting cards are released and nobody plays them, then nobody really wants them. Cards like Holomancer or Duskfallen Aviana have very interesting effects, there's a lot you could do with them, but who is ever happy to open one out of a pack?
---
Why?
---
If your Highlander Paladin deck is so trash without this card that it absolutely can't win without drawing it, then this card won't fix it and you shouldn't bother building it in the first place.
---
Oh shit!!!!!!!!
---
Everyone is complaining that the bomb meta really messes with everyone's highlander strategies. 
---
Re-origination....?
---
**Battlecry: Replace your deck with a copy of your starting deck**  
---
Gets rid of all the bombs and any other shennanigans that may have put a duplicate in your deck.  Also gives you a second swipe at the effects?
---
I had hellscream but I instantly disenchanted it
---
Plus with minion gives Murloc Tidecaller plus 2 attack when you play it and it dies, instead of plus one attack.
---
I'm thinking silencing minions will be the trigger. Not sure what the reward will be though.
---
To be fair Hunter was one of the weakest classes at the time and spell hunter was pure meme up until reaching the peak during Rastakahn's Rumble
---
Well they're not too expensive to craft, you can make the deck soon enough, grind a bit for gold/dust and you'll get there buddy
---
1)  Since it's the most expensive card, we're looking at DOOM and Twisting Nether for spells which are unimpressive to dupe and Gul'Dan for a top end card. However, most of the time you want to play Guldan when you get him instead of waiting a turn to combo and get two, not to mention a second Gul'Dan will lowroll with Voidwalkers more frequently.
---
2) You can use an Emperor tick to play N'Zoth plus Banker. Also even if you dont, 9 times out of 10 your N'Zoth will stick and you can just Banker him on board. This also means you're playing N'Zoth and getting a board and then getting your dupe card instead of duping first then playing your N'Zoth on the following tur, so it's also better for tempo.
---
Just like how Reno is mage specific because wild highlander priest exists.
---
Counterpoint: Nah.
---
What are people supposed to do on here? Complain about the stale meta and how not-fun Warrior is from both sides of the board? How Omega Devastator and Dr. Boom (hero) cards should probably be nerfed? 
---
There's new shit to bitch about! Even if they're totally wrong about it, they can SPECULATE for now as if they're right!
---
Way too slow? Gul'Dan games go way into fatigue. Nothing is too slow when you have a constant wall of void lords and life steal.
---
Wait are scarabs and crabs like in the same family that would make so much sense
---
We're gonna be non existent in every existing deck
---
Good point. Someone mentioned that having Finley at 2 mana also makes getting him from a 'Draw your lowest cost minion' Battlecry less consistent, which I thought made sense too.
---
They should change the art and the effect
---
I me my my I.  Sounds pretty one sided there.
---
Gotcha
---
You can only run 1 copy of each card regardless of whether it's a legendary or not.
---
Yea, with the infinitely doubling floops you probably could.
---
I just logged out and then after logging in again I disenchanted those cards
---
Oh, that would make more sense
---
The section on Priest, oof.
---
&gt; Priest in Rise of Shadows will be remembered as one of the saddest classes in Hearthstone‚Äôs history. This situation reminded us again how bad its classic set is, and how powerful expansion cards need to be for the class to get out of the dumpster. Priest lacked an identity and any sense of direction. It had no meaningful win conditions. It got slightly buffed with the change to Extra Arms, only to see its classic set become even weaker after losing Mind Blast. There was also that one week when Miracle Nomi Priest looked like a real deck, before collapsing in spectacular fashion. 
---
&gt; You often didn‚Äôt know what you were playing against when you matched up against an Anduin over the last few months, since Priest was fractured into so many different decks. No matter what, though, it always felt like a victory was coming. Priest never feels truly dangerous, and we‚Äôre concerned about its future if never-feeling-dangerous has become one of Priest‚Äôs ‚Äúclass identities‚Äù.
---
better "in your hand"
---
&gt; A 6/6 body is okay and Restore 12 Health isn't bad
---
6/6 taunt for 6 is below average. I think r/hearthstone's idea of "okay" is actually far worse than it lets on. And 12 health for 6 mana is... God awful. That's arguably worse than the 1 mana scheme for Warrior. Druid has a number of healing and armor gain cards that are just multiple times better than that. So yeah, it's bad. REAL bad. 
---
&gt; but combined with the Druid Quest...oh baby, that's a card.
---
This is the only deck this card would ever be used. All of it's effects combined makes it pretty darn good. Not broken or great, but very good. It'll definitely be a staple for the new Druid Quest
---
Sure, i'm not arguing there's some Janky meme deck you can put this in.
---
but you might as well throw away your ideas of dropping a 6/6 partially refill your hand with stuff that will keep you alive in the first place within a class that has 0 efficient control options. that's not gonna be viable unless we receive actual control options, namely cheap efficient card draw and healing, which isn't hunters class identity and is extremely unlikely.
---
Let's look at the different possibilities-
---
Control hunter is out, as usual, Hunter isn't capable of running control because of his basic set, there never has been a viable control hunter deck and there probably never will be. 
---
Any midrange hunter that runs this won't be as good as dire frenzy + masters call as its far less consistent, brings less value and less recovery options, i can't find one redeeming quality that a brann midrange hunter would have that the current midrange couldn't do better.
---
No real combo potential in standard, even if there was, you don't have the tools to draw out your deck and live to set up a later game combo.
---
So that leaves aggro, which is what 99% of people are theory crafting for brann, 
---
Are you gonna put a 7 cost brann into a mech aggro deck that wants to kill by turn 5? a deck that want's to have as many mechs and magnetic options as possible? a deck that wouldn't run Leeroy or Krush in the first place? probably not.
---
The one place for brann is Aggro burn hunter running the full face package, but, in trade for brann, we lost a kill command, we lost a unleash the hounds, we lost a potential huffer, etc, its very hard to imagine atturn 7 8/8 charge with a 2/4 is enough to remove 5-10 of hunters best burn tools. 
---
TL:DR - Any archetype i see Brann fitting into has better alternatives currently, the rest of the hunter set will decide if brann sees viable play or not.
---
I love it! And again we find a way to abuse a card instantly when released

Dreampetal Florist‚Äôs slightly weaker pet spider? Seems like it might work in a combo Hunter...but I don‚Äôt know with what.
---
I like the reward, but I *hate*, and I mean really *hate* the design of this card. Reborn presumably isn't going to be an evergreen keyword, so the number of Reborn cards we can expect in the future is minimal. That means that every single card that can be used with this quest is going to be a Paladin or Neutral card from this specific set with one specific keyword. Which means that this card can only get *worse* over time, not better, and that's assuming it's even playable in the first case with cards they're printing this expansion.
---
What a fucking waste. I was super excited for the Paladin quest to be released, but even if this card actually does turn out to be decent power-wise it will still be a terrible design because it requires you to run pretty much the exact same set of cards in every deck. There can't be *that* many Reborn cards you can play in Paladin, much less ones actually worth running, and that means that deckbuilding restrictions are going to make this card incredibly unfun to build around. Seriously disappointed in the devs for thinking this was a good idea.
---
This set isn't even fully revealed yet, much less released. I wouldn't be quite so fast to judge...
---
Could you post the deck code in a comment? I wanna check it out and have extra dust! Any tips or advice? Thanks broski!
---
Yup. Floop dupe for 4, play this on 6, do it again the next turn. You'll definitely run out of hand space tho so that might be a problem.
---

---
There‚Äôs no one ‚Äúmath,‚Äù it would depend on how many cards their combo requires, how many redundancies there are, and what your win percentage on a different line would be.
---
There‚Äôs also opportunity cost: if the deck runs two equal threats worth using your Naturalize on but the first one dropped presents you the opportunity to mill, milling then ups your win percentage over removing the minion via other means and saving your Naturalize til later when it simply acts as draw for them toward their win con.

Two problems:
---
1. It's two Innervates, not one. Elise is 5 Mana, Florist is 7.
---
2. You'd have to play them *on the same turn.* Florist discounts a card at the end of turn, Elise duplicates your hand immediately upon being played. So you'll only end up duplicating the normal-Cost card in your hand, and Florist will reduce the Cost of only *one* of them.

I got EMP‚Äôd in arena yesterday I feel this
---
Okay hand holding time, cause you‚Äôre not reading.
---
My.use.of.the.word.was.correct.
---
My.rating.of.the.card.might be wrong...
---
Do you get it now?
---
Yeah I messed up when I was updating that card so it is meant to have Taunt. I realize that doesn't make it a lot better, but it counts for something.
---
Quicksand is more or less a play on words where it quickens your opponent, but it also bogs them down by making the cards cost more, and threatens to drowned them in too many cards. Sand Golem isn't meant fit into every deck. It is meant more as a tech option for beating heavy control decks like warrior.
---
Yeah I figured if i could tech my deck to beat the only automatically better Control Deck then I could be essentially the top of the Control "Tier" and just contest with Cyclone Mages and Control Warriors in the late game and outvalue/stall the Midrange decks long enough to take them late. 
---
I usually run 2 deranged doctors if i'm playing against a lot of hunter but after losing to supercollider 3 games in a row i put in Harrison. 
---
I'm interested to see your list. I used to run Meteorologists but ultimately didn't find the consistency all there. If warrior ever fell out of meta i'd be excited to see what i can fill that Harrison spot with other than a Deranged Doctor.
---
Gg
---
Because classes didn't have a proper identity in a long time.
---
If I pull up WoW now I don't think there's anything on Paladin that would represent that hero power. They're just clueless.
---
facts
---
Why play a situational 7 Mana King Krush when you can play a 4 Mana one on turn 7?
---
I'm not sure about "force" firstly it's a game 
---
Secondly you can concede you will get penalized with a penalty that doesn't stop your ability to choose a class and play a game
---
Thirdly I think if I am playing and I'm about to do some cool combo and then my opponent realized and instead of waiting for around half of a minute  for me to complete my combo my opponent chooses to concede the game because he don't want to wait
---
It's ok to give him a reason to wait for around 30 second to wait for me complete my combo.
---
but then you don't have either 2 mana or 1 mana minions in your paladin deck other than finley.
---
there will be a fifth one
---
I think it's okay since I think it will double your hand from left to right. If that's the case, you just have to make sure floop and hidden oasis are your left most cards.
---
They clearly mean "If you have no duplicates at the start of the game", not for the effect itself to trigger at the start of the game lol
---
This is the version I run.  It's super fun, and all the board clears make surviving longer semi-viable.
---
[[Greater healing potion]] is worth more in druid, and [[Dark arakkoa]] was good enough to run.
---
BLOAT, the bubble fish
---
::Nomi Priest cries in a corner::
---
The deck will still run Crystal Power and Wrath, this just helps give even more consistency to Stalladris which was already one of the best cards in the deck. There was definitely room for this card and its definitely still strong with Stalladris. Imagine how hopeless your opponents will feel knowing you just added another 12 heal to your hand. Its brutal dude. It lets us cut Healing Touch which was trash honestly

---
Oh right I thought you were a standard who genuinely didn't know what it was
---
Nice.
---
Time to dominate Wild with Maexxna!!!
---
The big difference is you can get lethal with the mage card
---
That makes sense, and so you have made me sad, too.  
---
(:_;)
---
No shit.
---
So turn 6 Scarlet + Savannah...interesting.
---
Even the flashy, new mechanics in Ixalan, Ammonket, and Keledesh blocks are all things that still aren't unheard of in that game.
---
Granted, the main way Wizards of the Coast sells new mechanics is by printing over-pushed cards with those mechanics on them like Smuggler's Copter and Aetherworks Marvel, which is exactly what Team 5 did with Magnetic (Zilliax) and Twinspell (Conjurer's Calling).
---
Spaces that you would get extra floops that copy themselves seems like a very tough combo due to hand size and board space
---
&gt; slowly dieing...
---
I dieed after reading this
---
Yeah, Unleash was one of my reference points as well. The popular midrange Hunter lists are only playing one.
---
Azari doesn't have tusks, so likely another Pit Lord
---
Combo Crab
---
I haven't been keenly interested in the game past the 6-month point. I do, however, like Blizzard games, so I keep an eye on all the new content they release.
---
*at least he had chicken
---
Wouldn't call them elementals because that's a different cosmic hierarchy but they are in fact servants of the void and not demons, their classification as demons in WoW (and in turn Hearthstone) is an artifact of early game mechanics and changes in lore.
---
You have confused the word "fair" with the phrase "meta viable."
---
A 6 mana 6/6 with taunt is fair.
---
I use the charging doggo legendary.
---
Nah, Control/Bomb Warrior is already an expensive enough deck and nobody complains. A reno deck in Standard won‚Äôt be much pricier than that. Wild is different because it has a bigger card pool and players have had more time to collect them. Also with no rotation a nice Renolock will last forever - in a certain way cheaper than an expansion topdog.
---
Any tips for playing this deck? Looks fun.
---
Shadowy Figure can only copy deathrattle minions.
---
If you have four neutral legendary, no duplicate reward cards, you just created the most expensive deck in Hearthstone's history.
---
If that was the case they would've made the cards not as underwhelming... nobody is going to spend thousands of dust to play the new Reno
---
Divine spirit is a perfect synergy card with the hero power and creates leverage for maintaing board.
---
I would argue that Inner Fire is the card of the two that should be removed if either was
---
Excellent analysis
---
We‚Äôre talking about the same combo, and it was already posted and discussed.
---
Sorry but HS is trash and the developers are trash and Blizzard is trash and hang on I'll be right back after I preorder the new expansion
---
I love you
---
You've got me wondering now how this would work with Brann. Would it attack both in the order the minions are summoned, or would the second battlecry overwrite the first and just attack the second minion. My money is on the latter.
---
The problem is that no other deck just lets you win in one turn with no real set up or strategy. Even exodia mage you had to play the entire game for you win condition. Divine Spirit priest is literally ‚Äúplay big body shit, hope I don‚Äôt die before I draw 3 cards. If I draw 3 cards I win‚Äù No decks entire win condition should be based on just 3 cards. If your class doesn‚Äôt have armor (every class other than warrior or Druid and Druid doesn‚Äôt even really stack armor) than quite literally at any point in the game past turn 5 priest can instagib you. That‚Äôs not healthy. Everyone said Mage and Rouge would disappear after their cards were retired yet here we are.
---
Finally the Hakaar counter we deserve.
---
Control hunter has never been viable without an overpowered neutral card tho, what tools do you think hunter has now that would make that different?
---
I play a control spell hunter deck running every form of removal hunter is capable of, its rarely enough to live past aggro or even early value like conjurers mage, Hunters basic set and support makes a true control hunter basically impossible, curious how you expect a control hunter to live past the the current aggro decks or compete with other, far superior control decks.
---
Go fuck yourself
---
You can copy any friendly minion.
---
That's already a thing though.
---
Now, this, king krush, and emeriss...
---
They are good undead defending against E.V.I.L so it is paladin.
---
I am not wrong because I have my own home brewed choose one deck in wild. It‚Äôs maybe tier 3, but it hold its own. Once you add more choose effects, especially effects that heal indirect or directly and whose choose effect does not negate itself like with crystal power and fandral, the inherent synergy beings to takes over. It just like dude paladin was a joke until team 5 released a bunch of dude synergy. It‚Äôs the exact same for choose effects.
---
Hey, guys. Thanks a lot to everyone who posted constructive comments, upvoted, shared or awarded this thread. I much appreciate the support and I hope someone from the dev team notices this (they've been saying they're open to suggestions and feedback on cosmetics for the past few months, so there you go).
---
I see a lot of common ground between many replies and my original post, with some interesting other ideas, and counterpoints as well. Of course, no two people will likely have exactly the same vision of how things should change, and my own checklist is just a bunch of suggestions; I'll be happy if they make even one or two of these things happen, and/or other implement similar things.
---
I might reply to a few comments individually, but I'd like to add a couple of things here:
---
* Every HearthStone card pack expansion since TGT has seen a pre-purchase bundle, and the vast majority of them were just a bunch of packs at 1 buck apiece and an exclusive *cardback* as the only goodie included. They all still sold like pancakes, for the most part. People who want a ton of packs upfront for any given expansion and are willing to pay real money *for them* will buy the pre-order regardless of extra stuff or the lack thereof, for the pack discount alone (because packs are normally super overpriced).
---
* The main thing that has changed starting with Boomsday is that locking Hero Skins with these (more expensive) offers incentivizes some players to spend 80 bucks (or even 130) on packs instead of their usual 50 and, for players who wouldn't normally spend real money *on packs* at all, 80 bucks instead of 0. The former is arguably a standard business practice ("buy more and we'll throw in extra stuff"); the latter is more questionable in my humble opinion.
---
* Hearthstone is its own game with its own history, spirit, and, to a fairly large extent, its own lore by now. I see some very long and detailed posts about Warcraft lore here, but even if I find this interesting in its own right, it's also important to remember that this game is no longer called "Heroes of Warcraft". Nemsy is an awesome character in my opinion, and far from having "no lore connection". Just looking at \[\[Fen Creeper\]\] from Classic, then \[\[Bog Creeper\]\] from Old Gods, and then the Nemsy Hero Skin tells a nice little story in my eyes. It's fine to use WoW characters still, and that's obviously a bonus for (former) WoW players, but it's no longer *mandatory* by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Thanks again. =)
---
You use the bees on floop to get full mana (from 2x gloop). So you're you're killing him off every time.
---
Ha! Hand disruption for Hunter. That's unexpected, but not unwelcome. 6 Mana 6/9 Beast is overstatted, but this guy will likely lose some stats when it pulls something from your opponent's hand. The Bloodstinger kills a good chunk of minions with its 6 attack, but it fails to kill some of the higher priority combo cards like Malygos or Antonidas. It's also a risky play against decks that play stuff like Mechano Egg or MEchanical Whelp as they gain initiative on a big minion all of the sudden. Cool card, might see play.
---
What happens if you upgrade hero power with legendary after activating the quest? will convert back to paladin hero power or upgrade Emperor Wraps?
---
Zoo was high tier at one point in every expansion from classic HS up until WOTOG where they introduced an insane amount of anti aggro cards and Shaman was broken and Shaman did well into zoo with storm

---
Shrinkray,  Equality, Pyromancer, and Consecration are the absolute must-haves, in  order to deal with big threats. Dragonmaw Scorcher, Mossy Horror, and  Elven Archer for even more flexibility/synergy with the aforementioned  cards.
---
Zilliax and Sn1p-Sn4p will most likely be in every singleton deck.
---
Tirion and Truesilver of course, because why not?
---
Spellbreaker  and maybe even an owl (I found myself wanting a second silence quite  often, I tried messing with tinkmaster but the RNG and was too  punishing, maybe if res priest hits the meta it will be better).
---
I  found Kangor quite valuable with a small heal package, like Flash Heal,  Soup Vendor, and surprisingly Guardian of Kings (the body came in  handy, as this deck feels as though it likes aggressive stats)
---
Crystology, Hidden Wisdom, and Call to Arms for draw (CtA specifically for drawing Hungry crab or Elven Archer).
---
Bronze  Herald is a great single-of card that is a little slow, but often  allows you to keep the pressure high, and with Dragonmaw Scorcher and  even just 2-3 more dragons, like Ysera (for extra late game threat),  Firetree Witchdoctor almost always has an opening.
---
I  messed with a mech package for a bit, but it requires too much  consistency. Overall, its pretty fun and curves out well, but will  definitely require more support from the upcoming expansion to compete  with the likes of Dr.Boom and the explosive turns in the current meta.
---
Thanks for reading.
---
Edit: Previous Post got deleted because of no flair.
---
Additional counter point: were right.
---
Explorers being Highlander in Bomb meta, with no highlander support, is alone enough for the community to seriously question wtf the design team is thinking and whether or not they are even competent tbh.
---
Telling people to calm down and wait for the rest of the cards is jus my naive. 
---
The quests suck, the Explorers suck, we know there‚Äôs no highlander support, so what exactly are we waiting on to Judge further? Pack fillers? 
---
Remaining cards will be a mix of dust and already-meta-archetype support cards. 
---
I‚Äôm not a doomsayer but I guarantee HS loses a ton of players to chess games this quarter.
---
You should add in [[Explorer‚Äôs Hat]] .
---
Woah, this isn't hunter winning by turn 7, it will never see play. JK I like it, and it can have oondasta synergy too
---
&gt;The best solution is to simply support archetypes for more than one set, and space out cards for the archetype over the entire 2 year period.
---
or we could buff more cards.
---
The combo will be even worse in Wild.
---
Been playing since karazhan, I would say this is true that they are more expansive (~12-15k dust), but top meta decks today (bomb warrior, cyclone mage with pocket galaxy) have soo many legends and are around that cost so idk..
---
Example of them being more expensive, would be this new hunter Singleton deck, you probably just run houndmaster shaw cuz he‚Äôs elite stats, but houndmaster isn‚Äôt in any current high power level meta decks. Or wardruid loti might make singleton cut for Druid because of power level, but only rarely makes it into token druid. I‚Äôm fairly certain a singleton mage would run kalecgos yet he doesn‚Äôt see play in cyclone.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not solid in arena. It‚Äôs definitely the least worst pick here.
---
So what you are saying is that like all the best cards it has a downside instead of just being stupidly OP? Sounds like great design to me
---
Coin -&gt; Quest works because temporary mana is spent first, so you'll float your permanent mana crystal. Not sure if Quest -&gt; Coin works.

2/-/- | Give a minion +1/+1 and "Deathrattle: Add an Explorer's Hat to your hand."  
---
Greater healing potion is 2 mana less which is huge. Don't just scoff that that 2 mana. Cards have gone from playable to unplayable with 1 mana changes. 
---
And Dark Arakkoa was played for the synergy with C'Thun. Not b/c it was a great taunt. And, oddly enough, a 5/7 taunt is far better than 6/6 taunt. Not to mention Dark Arakkoa is a neutral card. I specifically mentioned class card.
---
EIGHT TURNS HAVE PASSED
---
I think if you removed Inner Fire priest would be completely gutted as priest still has a way to stack health on cards without divine spirit.you just can‚Äôt make a 44-44 on turn 8 (which you shouldn‚Äôt be able to do)
---
Weaker is debatable. On one hand you can say that Dreampetal Florist being able to hit any minion and being able to do it multiple times makes it stronger. On the other hand, you can say that being able to target Beasts makes this one stronger. Plus one mana cheaper and +1/+1 and you can take advantage of the discount the same turn and not have to wait until end of turn.
---
Yea it's more for tempo, also it's a battlecry so you could play this and tundra rhino turn 6.
---
They revealed a hunter minion that works like Dirty Rat 2.0 as well. Also Weapons Project or Blingtron to pop the Twig.
---
Why wouldn't it? The attack is part of the battlecry, and the battlecry would trigger twice. Seems pretty clear that it would pull 2 minions and attack each of them.
---
This is literally the conjurer calling mage deck that was being played before the rogue nerfs...
---
And I though the name alone was comical.
---
Problem:  the new KK is 1 attack 1 health.
---
Instead you do this:
---
Spider onto KK -&gt; Emeriss KK -&gt; KK + Faceless.
---
That or you can hunting party it or something.  If you double discount you can do some weird stuff, but that runs the risk of hitting the second spider.
---
love it
---
Inb4 blizzard prints Geist for 5 mana spells
---
Silence 10 friendly minions, reward: Summon a Auchenai Soulpriest and cast radiance 6 times.
---
Truth. More than one Barista in a deck built around that synergy is the nuts. In wild format, Pogo Rogue targetting Barista with Shadowcaster is just insane.
---
I'm pretty sure murlocs are actually a sort of wonky lungfish.
---
When this minion dies bring it back to life with 1 health and without the reborn keyword
---
I thought the same with Alex at one point when it seemed to be on everyone's lips. I've a gold one sitting in my collection waiting. Doubt it, mind.
---
What a shocker, they are giving hunter more OP cards.
---
Read Shadowy Figure
---
Thought it said hidden oats at first
---
If they don't play ranked, only arena, they don't need to open a single pack.
---
If you can get this off on a dire frenzied Krush and a Tundra Rhino you can get a 38 damage combo with, Krush, Krush, Rhino, Rhino, Timber, Timber. 2nd Krush+Rhino coming from hunting party. Seems awful to me but hey, memes am i right?
---
I mean, you‚Äôre right, but you were a little aggressive about it.
---
dont worry, theyll kill you before turn 6
---
Both choices are pretty meh, especially the heal 12, which was previously 4 mana to get 12 armor. But the ability to get choose both is what makes it have some potential.
---
Eh? He's summoning a mummy that's a copy of a living friendly minion.
---
Think of it as the mummy already exists. He's just calling it and teaching it some tricks of the living.
---
Finally a challenger for odd warrior
---
That's not true. You will sometimes, yes, but definitely not almost always by turn 2 if you're mulliganing properly.
---
They go in different decks.  Which since one actually has a deck to support it and the other doesn't, the one that does is more playable.
---
Hunter gets cool beasts this expansion. 6 mana 5/5 beast is servicable, but not great. This one also reduces the cost of another beast in your hand by 5, which might enable some sweet combos with the likes of Tundra Rhino or such. The random nature of the cost reduction makes it harder to pull of combos consistently and you need to have a (specific) beast drawn, but there could be potential here. The cost reduction also carries over with Hunting Party.
---
It actually doesn‚Äôt conflict with any of the explicitly listed weaknesses or limitations, but the flavor feels *incredibly* off base and the copying mechanic isn‚Äôt something that‚Äôs really been established in the class.  
---
And while I agree the class shouldn‚Äôt be pidgeonholed into a few restrictive themes, this one feels just wrong. It‚Äôd be like changing Priest‚Äôs focus to pure aggro for a set; sure, it‚Äôs not against the class‚Äôs *explicit* identity as defined in the recent blog post, but it still wouldn‚Äôt feel right from both a flavor and gameplay perspective.
---
Big beast hunter looks like!
---
&gt; but in Hunter?
---
My thoughts exactly...
---
Hunter doesn't need combo disruption, when they win games before the combo even happens. 
---
Do they need this as a "strong body that discard one card from the opponent's hand"? I would tend to say "no" to that as well.
---
I think there was a disconnect. 4/8/8 king krush+ 1 mana brann 1/1 summon king krush +1 mana 1/1 Alex set a heros health to 15. So it totals to 6 mana. You draw the new brann and Alex off of jepetto. It‚Äôs a bad otk because it has 0 consistency.
---
Elise needs to survive the enemy‚Äôs turn, otherwise the combo fizzles.
---
yeah retire it cause it sucks, we need better priest cards
---
Never thought of that card. good point!
---
PsychoSean is a consistent and belligerent whiner. So I'm not going to be courteous about it. If he's going to call others clueless and demonstrate cluelessness, I'm going to call them out for it directly. I'm not interested in their bullshit.
---
In Wild this can just snipe Reno.  Funny stuff.
---
... dark arakkoa is a druid card.
---
That's a nice combo piece you have in your hand.
---
Would be a shame if something happened to it.
---
Man, we get it, bomb warrior &gt; highlander archetypes until something is done, wait and see all the cards then start crying.
---
So why thematically would this spider make another beast cost less?
---
Yeah i have never tried to touch warrior or really any control just because of the cost. Cyclone mage seems really fun, I'm very tempted to craft it. I can't imagine how i'd cut up my budget mech hunter or midrange hunter decks to build around Dinotamer Brann. I imagine that he'd go into some kind of deck with Zul'jin and Subject 9, but that seems like it could get pricey.
---
But, I think that‚Äôs fine. You don‚Äôt have to actually make the ultimate warrior Singleton deck. Like you said, they probably will struggle with aggro, and that‚Äôs the f2p bread and butter. I‚Äôm sorry but Hearthstone‚Äôs cost has increased dramatically. I actually think that crafting a neutral card that fits into any deck is more economically viable than crafting a class legendary (hence why most crafting guides prioritize neutrals over class cards). So from that perspective, it would be much better for those players low on dust. If you can only afford one, you could at least experiment with it in different classes rather than being locked into a class you may particularly not enjoy (most f2p players specialize in one or two classes). So yeah, they won‚Äôt be able to play the 11 legendary warrior deck, but they‚Äôll still get greater utility than they would otherwise.
---
It *should* be better than some games. I've been following Warcraft lore for years mate, but the universe is old. Warcraft III was released 17 years ago. There is *so much more* they could have done since then, especially with the release of WoW in 2004, than they have done now. 
---
An easy, if cheap comparison is Warhammer 40k. Let's frame it this way: both universes have had an insanely impacting and dramatic war (civil war, even) that transpired 10,000 years ago from the present-day of that universe, and has had long-lasting profound impacts on the rest of the universe's future.
---
In Warcraft, it's the War of the Ancients and is told by a trilogy of novels.
---
In Warhammer 40k, it's the Horus Heresy and is told by *over 50 novels.*
---
That's a very basic and simplistic comparison, and is unfair if only because Warhammer 40k is a lot older, being nearly twice as old as Warcraft III.
---
Now... I get it. There are some very good reasons why this is the case, especially when you think about the gameplay limitations or requirements of World of Warcraft.
---
Regardless, though, I have learned more about dark elf education and upbringing in a *15-minute conversation* with a dark elf in Spellforce III's expansion, than I have learned about the night elf education or upbringing in *all of my years learning about Warcraft lore.*
---
That's uh... that's actually insane. Now, major props to Spellforce III - easily one of my most favourite games of all time, like seriously *holy shit* it's so good.
---
And I still love Warcraft lore. But man oh man is there so, *so* much room they have to explore if they decided to.
---
I'm also not going to get into BfA and its plot or storytelling, haha. Lack of world-building is forgivable, the quality of BfA's plot and storytelling is not, in my opinion.
---
Dreadsteed died for this
---
Because a 3/4 on turn 1 is a hell of a lot stronger than a 3/4 on turn 6. It's about who gets advantage on the board, which decides who gets to play offensively in the early game and who is forced to play defensively.
---
For an aggro deck to immediately lose the advantage means they're most likely going to lose the game.
---
If you have Hungry Crab in your starting hand, your opponent plays Murmy on turn 1, and you think "I better save this Crab for a better target", you're never going to reach past rank 20.
---
This Reno mage legendary looks bad !! Not the art!
---
Not on mobile, but I had this on PC. Resolved itself after a while (hours maybe?), nothing I personally did helped.
---
Great art, but i feel it shows too much skin for blizzards standards gotta cover up the neck then it can be the best alt hero artwork
---
&gt;Un healthy cards and strategies will often hold classes back rather than helping them. As devs can‚Äôt buff or add certain things to the class as the un healthy cards would cause them to broken.   
---
the only card this argument applies to is shadow visions which ironically is played in the most popular and hated deck in wild which doesn't even run divine spirit or inner fire. even at the end of the last rotation cycle with shadow visions in standard neither of the priest meta decks ran divine spirit or inner fire, they both relied instead on mind blast as a win condition. if anything was broken in priest over the past 2 years it was shadow visions itself not divine spirit, inner fire or mind blast.

What‚Äôs the mysterious lore of him becoming a Mexican
---
Glad to hear it! WoW certainly does have a special place in my heart, and I do love my characters, so I'm happy to hear you're enjoying the ride. Your post and the fact that it was for your friend's character just really made me reminisce about mine.
---
Basically.
---
Unless they nerf bomb warrior in someway, but its impossible.
---
This prob won‚Äôt be run in a dedicated discard deck, but as a value generator in a control deck
---
Doesn't do anything RES doesn't.
---
Meh, I‚Äôm less angry about BfA than other people are, but that‚Äôs as someone who only reads about the lore from the outside. I haven‚Äôt played since WoD.
---
Yup. This is a Wild Combo.
---
Reno looks to be a bad card with respect to the other explorer s card
---
Well with it's 1 health I doubt it'll be alone long enough to be silenced in many cases and have you can just ping it off with mortal coil.
---
He wasn't talking about his previous quest, just that Priest is currently bad and that's why it shouldn't get a quest based around a single set's keyword.
---
Ofc that's still very poor reasoning.
---
The only semi decent combo I‚Äôve seen is definitely the unleash/dire frenzy one and that is mind-numbingly slow when you consider its the hunter class.
---
I'm guessing you haven't been here for long... I still rock the Reno flair because of how much it single-handedly ruined facehunter's day back in LoE.
---
The hat is in the new one too
---
Yeah but running no cards higher cost than jeklik is hard and so is drawing jeklik consistently
---
Make it *Cultured Bloodstingers* if you may...
---
Well, you can hit for 16 with 1 turn setup (reduction on King Crush + Faceless) in hunter, the SMOrc class. It might not be reliable but hey, 2x Skill Command, hero power and refuel in form of 3 mana draw 3 beasts might be enough.
---
Nice
---
Not in wild it doesn't.
---
Lmfao
---
While I agree with you in general, I don't agree that every choose one card just two fair effects combined. Some choose one cards would be played even if it were just one side of it. Living Roots for example would see play in different decks if each effect was a separate card. One is lost in the jungle, and the other is holy smite. The latter would see play in any combo maly druid deck. Prenerf Keeper of the Grove would have absolutely seen play in either mode. Prenerf Ancient of War would have seen play if it was just draw 2 cards. Prenerf Nourish would have seen play as well on either side (more likely on the draw side). Post nerf, maybe. DK Malfurion would probably see play if it was only one of the two effects. Hell, probably if it didn't even have an effect that puts minions on the board. Also Mire Keeper was just solid on either mode. 3/3 for 4 that gives you a wild growth effect? Yes please. 5/5 worth of stats for 4? Pretty decent.
---
For the most part you are right though. Most Choose One cards are slightly versions of existing cards (like Wrath being a Shiv or Dark Bomb that cannot hit face). But there are some exceptions like Living Roots simply being two decent cards that people would put in decks without the other choose option.
---
What universe are you living in? Or are you /s‚Äôing us
---
You only play a disruption card like this if you can deal with what comes out; pulling a minion you can‚Äôt deal with is a ranks 20+ only play.  And pulling a Venomizer can be good if you‚Äôre protecting something else, for instance a Frenzied Lifedrinker, or stopping the Missile Launcher combo, but it‚Äôs also just a calculated risk that‚Äôs sometimes the right play given the cards in hand and what your opponent might have.  Doesn‚Äôt mean this necessarily sees play, but people not knowing how to effectively use disruption cards won‚Äôt be a factor in competitive ranks either way.
---
Better yet, steal their brann and dirty rat so they don't pull your stinger
---
Yeah, class minions and neutral minions are part of two completely separate games that have nothing to do with one another! Painting this minion yellow is like removing half its stats!
---
Class minions are generally not supposed to be *much* better. The difference is generally supposed to be less than a stat point. Neutral minions are still supposed to be playable and class cards are still not supposed to be overpowered. People have shown a number of comparisons where this card has one *more* stat point than the neutral equivalent would have. It would be broken as a neutral minion, and absolutely worth playing in quest paladin, or non-quest paladin. It wouldn't magically get worse if it were a class card, that would only mean that other classes couldn't take advantage of it.
---
Sludge belcher didn't just see play, it saw play in paladin, and it saw play in paladin decks without deathrattle synergy. The reason it isn't "that good" in wild right now is because wild is the home of big priest and fifteen other batshit inane OP decks.
---
Lol this is the pre-release r/hearthstone cycle. Seen it 10 times before.
---
Part of the official definition:
---
&gt;A mummy is a **deceased** human or an animal 
---
They are dead and being brought back to life. That makes them undead. Sure, they could be written as 'friendly good mummies' to fit Hearthstones childlike narrative, but in that same sense, you could write Deathwing as the friendliest Dragon. All of the Mummies are enemies in WoW, typically found among the Undead Trolls &amp; Nerubians like Crypt Fiends.
---
The quests are all based around the artifacts that each class (or rather each class' representative) have found in Uldum. In Paladin's case, Finley Mrrgglton has found the Emperor Wraps, a magical set of linen wraps which can take the form of any friendly minion. Sure it might feel like it should belong in Priest, but whilst some of you have forgotten, I still the remember the time before Un'Goro when Priest and Deathrattle had no associations whatsoever. It was the Priest Quest that singlehandedly created the Deathrattle Priest archetype, and I believe this quest will create a Reborn Paladin archetype. Besides, if Blizzard never mixed things up a bit then the game would get stale very quickly.
---
Yeah, and that was an awful experience. A match-up shouldn't be determined almost completely by if a certain card is drawn before one player beats the other.
---
I‚Äôm into that.
---
I have seen the exact same threads for every single expansion
---
no, as long as you have a naturalize in hand you wont have 2 in deck so elise works
---
Naisu
---
I agree. I wanna play this in a slower midrange hunter. Cut most of the 1 and 2 drops, probably dire frenzies too, and put in some bigger beasts like Highmane and maybe even stealth tigers (totally blanking on the name)
---
Yes, Lazul should‚Äôve been a Paladin.
---
third attempt at posting since i never post LOL
---
Never seen stats so beautiful for a great battlecry
---
Bronze Beard would be proud
---
Priest is often also the worst class to play against. Shuffling garbage into your deck, stealing your minions, stealing your cards, resurrecting the same minions over and over again, winning with the same old inner fire combo
---
I once asked which class people would remove if they could in /r/hearthstone, and priest was the single most often mentioned one
---
They mentioned in the panel yesterday that Hearthstone lore isn‚Äôt canon. Sometimes Hearthstone stuff becomes canon, like the league of explorers and the Tortollans but otherwise it‚Äôs just them having fun. They said that Hearthstone is a fun whimsical space for them to experiment compared to the serious tone of WoW and Starcraft. 
---
FYI they also said that Hearthstone is their voice actor‚Äôs favorite game to work on. The actors for Brann and Finley were hilarious.
---
Well done. You stuck to your guns and I'm proud of you, for what it's worth
---
I actually have had decent success with my bomb deck.  Although I use a homebrew that makes a few changes, including more removal, no non mech rush cards and an extra copy of spell breaker.  I‚Äôve actually got it up to rank 2 so far this month, but I will definitely admit that my deck is the only bomb deck I‚Äôve seen during my climb.
---
Yeah, I totally agree that the flavor of raising mummies is the exact opposite of what a Paladin should be doing - I'm just not a big fan of the class identity memeing.
---
That said, I think the class flavors are a little off-kilter for this expansion as a whole so far (at least with regard to the Explorer's League legendaries), so as a Paladin main I'm not too worried about the quest flavor-wise. Finley certainly doesn't strike me as the average crusading Paladin type, just like Reno doesn't strike me as an average arcane scholar Mage. If it were Uther's face on the Paladin quest, then I'd be a little more concerned.
---
Where Finley's not only an archaeologist interested in new discoveries, but also a murloc with a British accent, yeah I wouldn't put it past him to make use of an ancient artifact he found that's capable of raising mummies.
---
Sorry for the mix-up, the card was confirmed fake by the mod who posted it in #new-cards.
---
Same shit was going on before prev expansion. And before that. And before that. And so on. Some people have too much spare time on their hands
---
I truly do not understand the flavoring of this card. It‚Äôs a cool effect, sure, but how exactly does ‚Äúmummifying‚Äù something translate flavor-wise to summoning a copy?
---
that's busted
---
I'm not so sure about that, with Plot Twist you could draw 20 cards without going through even half of your deck first. Someone will figure out a busted combo or something and then we'll be sorry, if not this expansion, then in a future expansion.
---
*See stat line*
---
"Nice"
---
That‚Äôs the point of tech cards. They should only be good against what you‚Äôre targeting, so it‚Äôs meta dependant.
---
I think the idea is okay if you think about it in a weird way. It‚Äôs essentially the Paladins burying their dead, but the dead keep coming back. Not their fault the area is cursed.
---
S I X. N I N E.
---
Ao that means he will never die ??
---
I'm having a hard time seeing the win condition here. Even with finley on curve this seems awfully janky compared to competitive decks
---
It‚Äôs not a copy.
---
I haven't played WoW "properly" for years, since WOTLK. But I'm, as you might imagine, quite into the lore. I learn a lot about the story.
---
As far as BfA goes, my personal complaints extend only to the plot and storytelling, though I understand that there are a plethora of complaints other players have about the gameplay.
---
BfA seems to be a story that less informed players enjoy more easily. That's not intended as an insult or anything - I've seen a few people who enjoy the story actively acknowledge that before BfA they weren't really invested or learning about the lore. I don't know how much you've read into it from the outside, either. I don't know if you've read/listened to *Before the Storm,* or read short stories like *Dark Mirror,* or *Edge of Night,* or the novellas.
---
When I thought about their enjoyment of the story though, it made sense. BfA as a story *could* work. A big problem I see is that they're using characters in ways that betrays what designs they have had in the past. It's *out of character.* And characters not behaving like themselves is a massive deal-breaker in any story, unless there's a reasonable in-universe explanation for why they are (in which case, it's not really out-of-character).
---
But where they've taken Sylvanas, Rexxar, and the "honourable elements" of the Horde in BfA doesn't make sense to me.
---
This always happens. I don't know what you expected.
---
Actually, I think they might introduce some archetype revolving around reborn, something like res priest but only reborn minions or something. Could be cool.
---
Wow really, where did you hear that?
---
Bomb Warrior: *plays his second Clockwork Goblin* "Here, have another Bomb. If you were running a Highlander deck, those plans just got rekt"
---
Mage Opponent: "That's what you think!" *plays Kazakus the Purger and smiles*
---
B.W.: "Oh wow, would you look at that?" *plays Wrenchcalibur, then uses the weapon and his Goblin to kill off Kazakus*
---
B.W.: "When your Purger's battlecry removed any 'duplicate cards' it still left one Bomb, yeah? So now we're back to two, your Highlander card is still ruined, and with your Purger dead you can't try it again later if you happened to have a Youthful Brewmaster in hand. *Did you* have a Brewmaster ready &amp; waiting?"
---
M.O.: *glares at B.W., then concedes*
---
oh no, you only get to make them draw ten cards, destroy up to 5 of their minions and for each minion they have up to 5 you get a 3/4
---
What an odd choice for Paladin. This is very much a priest card.
---
Haven't you seen a western before?
---
Yes, let‚Äôs make Lazul a Paladin.
---
And only 6 mana ?!
---
I wouldn't argue that it's so strong that you'd hold back playing Stelladris instead of playing it with other cards so that you can play it with Hidden Oasis, but I would argue that heal druid is all about value and getting an extra Lucentbark trigger is something that any heal druid would appreciate even if it costs an extra 6 mana. If you draw Stelladris late game and have Hidden Oasis, Nourish, and Crystal Power in hand, I think there are cases where you would choose Hidden Oasis over the other two. But then again maybe you'd choose Nourish instead since you'd want to draw 3 cards and potentially another 3 later. Now that's expensive for 12 mana.
---
Basically the hearthstone Reddit for the past two days.
---
&gt; I incidentally think it cannot die until it attacks both enemies, since death processing gets delayed.
---
Wow, so you're saying this can kill 2 [[Core Hounds]] instead of just 1? That's pretty boss.
---
I think they wanted for hunter to generate more beasts, but they also wanted card generation to be one of hunter's weaknesses. So they compromised and made a card that was so weak, no hunter would want to run it.
---

7/9/5 Beast  
---
Not happening.
---
I hope it's good. I love highlander deck building. I just don't want to be a masochist for the sake of it.
---
Just wait, it's like 2 weeks
---
This is a good post that will be removed because they do not accept memes in this sub
---
Thanks for telling. I appreciate!
---
Yeah, not the biggest fan of the hunter class. Though unlike the levels suggest, I do like many aspects of shaman.
---
It works sometimes but 19 out of 20 times it doesn't. Had it for like 2 days
---
Betrug is stickable tho if you just want backup
---
This happens every expansion. People get hyped, they play the expansion and then get bored.
---
I'll mitigate this with two points.
---
First there is one last highlander support card and sometimes, it brings the whole thing together.
---
Second, the context in which those highlander cards release is very different from the one back then.
---
 Currently we can see that blizzard has been getting very good at getting cards powerlevel where they want it and we've never had that many tier 2 decks so I speculate that the highlander restriction might not be as bad anymore and that therefore it's normal to have a weaker payoff as result. It's also way healthier since it means less "I drew my I win card RNG".
---
Frankly, any beast he hit thats costs 6 or more is amazing, because they can now be combo-ed in the same turn as Tundra Rhino, and maybe a Timber Wolf or two for good measure...
---
Nah man. Go farm your attention somewhere else. It's a card game subreddit.
---
I don't want this sub to become like the game of thrones one.
---
It's harsh but we need to spray water in your face while we can while it's early like that.
---
Priest can be viable with a decent pack of minions, like it was with dragons back in the day, The issue is that priest hasn't gotten any mechs, dragons, lackeys, elementals, or beasts, excluding chameleon lol.. and they seem to be pushing rebirth a lot, and bring back dead minions, that element would be fun if we had a graveyard, rather than making it random, like magic, it would make it so much fun to play.. but in hearthstone it doesn't work so well.. Priests have an amazing set of spells, just need a good minion pack to go with it, Drakonid Operative is still missed.
---
Aren't all beasts made of meat?
---
Just FYI bombs don‚Äôt counter Highlander decks.

---
While I find secret paladin to be supremely irritating, it typically doesn‚Äôt have the sticking power to last the whole match, and secret hunter has been around so long you get a good idea of the secret they played based on board state. Other than those two no other deck currently relies on secrets heavily so I don‚Äôt see the problem.

For a build-around combo in wild that takes a setup turn, that's not good enough. You'd still need to run another way to win, and in the end you'd be better off without the Elise combo.
---
&gt;A 4 mana 2/5 taunt that summons a 2/1 taunt when it dies isn't very good. 
---
It *objectively* is. People have made a dozen comparisons expressing that, and your complaint has just been "well, gee, those cards are neutral, and sure, they're good, but they're not *that* good!"
---
&gt;Just like a 3 mana 2/3 that summons a 2/1 when it dies isn't very good. 
---
What if it had taunt?
---
&gt;saw zero play despite being a strong class minion
---
Hold on, now you're implying that a class minion is *better* by virtue of being a class minion?
---
&gt;the game has powercrept massively since then.
---
It definitely has, unless you look at pre-nerf decks, like undertaker hunter. If sludge belcher was good enough to be a staple in the undertaker hunter meta and after, it's good enough for play in standard today.
---
&gt;This same phrase applies to both Harvest Golem and the new card.
---
Except the new card is overstatted. And it's a sticky defense. And it has quest synergy. So not at all.
---
You understand my pain so well.

This happens pretty much every single expansion. People are terrible at evaluating cards.
---
Huh. Remember when [[Dr. Boom's Scheme]] came out and it's artwork and flavour text both clearly referenced explosives which was at odds with its rather underwhelming and weak effect? Well that was because Blizzard changed the card at the last minute because the original effect was too powerful to see print. That actually happened, and all of the people speculating that a last minute change was responsible for Dr. Boom's Scheme being so terrible and lacking in flavour were completely right because they based their theory on clear and noticeable discrepancies in the design of the card.
---
Your "theory" that the Paladin quest was originally a Priest card is unfounded and very **very** unlikely. Priest doesn't have a monopoly on copying minions, the only reason Priest got cards that copy minions in the first place was to boost the power level of Deathrattle Priest, a deck which was singlehandedly created by the Priest Quest and the cards released alongside it back in Un'Goro. Why shouldn't Paladin be given the opportunity to have a new archetype based around generating value with minions like the Quest Priest of old?
---
Also, the Paladin Quest has already been revealed this early in the season, which wouldn't be the case if they were redesigning it for use in a different class.
---
Logic too op pls nerf. Go quote  where I said the deck was broken
---
Yea. Rafaams insane I don‚Äôt know why they made him so op.
---
Paladin isn't inherently good either.

Muahaha, this means it is time for my Reno Jackson/Maexxna deck to shine.
---
It's a bit of a high roll deck and extremely polarised matchups. Which means while the win rate is reasonable on paper, it can be incredibly frustrating to play against depending on RNG and your deck
---
Oof... I just got the same reward at 7 wins lmao.
---
Sounds decent but how about we give it +1 attack and drop it's cost down to 4. Maybe give it overload (2) to make up for the drop in cost?
---
Is it so hard to make a screenshot? What even is this app?
---
4 mana 8/8 charge ,next  meme???
---
Seems like a pretty great card for a Highlander Hunter - but I'm not too sure how that deck will pan out.
---
Still need help?
---
Much better than the current combo with the 1-1/1  and nine lives
---
They've got elements of lizards, frogs, and fish, of varying subspecies of each, with individuals expressing different elements more strongly. If I had to generalise, I'd call them "newt people", but Sir Finley is basically just a [red-eyed tree frog](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.fineartamerica.com%2Fimages-medium-large%2Fred-eyed-treefrog-agalychnis-callidryas-corey-hochachka.jpg&amp;f=1) with axolotl gills.

you can silence everything thats not an aura from your hero (jaina dk and the lifesteal for all elementals for excample and maybe (dunno if it got changed) the 4/4 stats from rogue quest.)

---
Uhh... You mean Priests. In WoW, Priests revive. Even in the cinematics, Priests do the reviving.

---
Oh yeah, this set is going to be *incredible* for Wild. I'm actually sort of hoping it drives up the playerbase in the format, honestly.
---
its different from mecharoo and possessed villager.  
---
pv was the weakest version, cause no tribal tag.  
---
mecharoo was a weak version but because of magnetic it has its advantages as well.  
---
same goes for this one it has the murloc tag so its good in almost any zoo type deck.
---
Taste like salty manbaby tears
---
baku allready rotated out ?
---
A bunch of Hearthstone terminology comes from MtG.
---
For example, "Milling" an opponent to refer to making your opponent burn cards from their deck comes from the MtG card Millstone which did exactly that
---
Another one: "Tutoring" to refer to pulling specific cards out of your deck refers to the MtG card Demonic Tutor
---
You‚Äôre being super obtuse.
---
In WoW all healer classes revive, including Paladins.
---
That boy is quite thicc.
---
That's the joke.
---
probably a 1/1 with reborn or "give a minion reborn"
---
I think we need to talk about how busted blast master boom is...
---
7 mana, 13/13 stats, plus death rattle deal 6-24 damage
---
That is fricking incredible, putting the bombs in the deck is barely a challenge.. why isnt the body of hoomaster  like a 3/3?!
---
The strength of warrior is actually a joke, 4 mana 4/6 deal 10 damage
---
Hero card infinite value and give all minions rush
---
1 mana generate huge value
---
1 drops with big bodies and very solid effects
---
Warrior shoukd be killed and there is more than 1 card that needs to be targetted
---
One of these options is pretty atrocious without it.
---
the only way i would do this if hp is dropped. 6/9 with poisonous is too op. due it will survive giants, kill giant and then you have 6/1 body.

6/2/8 Beast | Poisonous  
---
It doesn't really fit with hunters gameplan though.It will be tough to fit in a card thats dead in severa matchups.
---
Just don't try to steal Reno from priest in wild.
---
These do not show the rank of these players. Cards that have been wild last year are heavily underrepresented in wild because some people queue low rank wild with their old standard decks, hence some people wont be running loatheb in odd paladin for example. The real number is closer to 40% so over half might not have been completely accurate, but its not really 15% either.
---
Damn, I almost got it right lol
---
Current hunter decks wouldn't want to play this.
---
no i said when , as in next year , together with the other expansions from last year
---
I actually run a duel deck with elysiana to reload after the minions are all drawn out and have had surprising success with it.  It also has some really cool plays that you can end up making depending on the exact card generation you get from ysera and secrets.  While it‚Äôs far from guaranteed, being able to nightmare a batterhead and put lifesteal on him is a great way to get concedes.  Nuking a full board while healing back to 30 in the late game is a great feeling.
---
You can't count on it though because it's too random and introducing reborn makes it even more worthless.
---
AKA bad hunter decks.
---
Harvard would like to know your location
---
Immortal Prelate would keep the 2/2 stats though, not a very good combo with the hero power.
---
Lol I'm gonna do this with bomb warrior next expansion thanks for heads up
---
The plan with bomb warrior is you fill your deck with extras using Ellek so you decrease your bomb draw chances have Warrior fill your deck with a few bombs then Rafaam. Bomb warrior isn't as good at removal as Control and often doesn't run Elysiana so you can sometimes win them out. Control Warrior is really really difficult though, so much removal and 10 extras, hard to get a foothold at all
---
I think the *only* case I've seen Celestia do work was when Toast was against a Druid in Arena and said that this would block a potential out for his opponent that he'd normally play on curve (I think he got Celestia from a different effect).
---
The effect is good, obviously.  Every mage deck would play a 4/6 that deals 10 across the enemy board.  The problem is that it's not much better than Blizzard.  So would you rather play 2 Blizzard, or 1 Blizzard 1 Reno and also be a highlander deck?
---
So the deck that you might put this in, would be better without this card.  For the triumphant return of RENO JACKSON that is pretty disappointing.
---
Better yet, we need something to either shuffle duplicates or cards that didn‚Äôt start in your deck into your opponent‚Äôs.

While this is funny, it is also interesting. The line about "a healthy meta should have decks that keep others in check". This is great. But. What keeps Bomb Warrior in check?
---
And keeping in check and just completely shutting down are two different things. It is sad that the highlander decks will be crippled so easily. But we shall see.
---
Either way. I think the new highlander cards, as of right now, are kinda useless. Except for Finley and Elise. Those two have potential.
---
Classic really helps new players who do not have all the wild cards.
---
Don't worry, I read it as wasps the firsts time around too, and had to do a double take after reading his comment.
---
I loved dirty rat, as soon as it was spoiled i was like, this is bonkers, control shaman here I come.  
---
The deck hardly ever lost but almost every game went to fatigue or close to it.
---
I ran ancestors call, 4-5 overload (5) dmg spell, the gain 7 joust for 14, malygos of course. 4/6 legendary that gives you spells life steal.  
---
I haven't played In months but i might give hunter a go bc interacting with cards in your opponents hand is busted.
---
you mean standard, not classic.
---
one of the main appeals is that the deck archetypes change every expansion, or at least every year.  decks like kingsbane rogue, odd paladin, and big priest will exist forever in wild, but they leave standard eventually and make room for new decks.
---
And bombs also cancel the effect that they are making a whole expansion around! Amazing job blizzard!
---
Spiteful Priest was a pretty strong deck, definitely tier 2 if not tier 1. I suppose that despite its namesake, it really was mostly a dragon deck though.
---
r/2007scape is a force to be reckoned with, I love it.
---
Are you stupid or something?  
---
If it can go face it has more versatility than if it can't.
---
It feels weird to be this far in the reveals to only have 3 neutral cards so far. At this point with 1/4 of the set shown we have no idea what sort of cards are the most likely to go into decks.
---
Tbh I was hyped at first but at the back of my head I had a feeling Reno would be disappointing and overhyped
---
You're assuming there will be a Highlander meta xD
---
Elementals are natural forces independent of the Planes. The Planes simply served as their prisons after their defeat by the Titans.
---
Yes
---
Don't forget you can clone the discounted beast with hunting party and it keeps the discount.
---
The bad king crush have some use of clearing taunts for the good ones to go face
---
Hearthstone is a bottomless pit of money unfortunately, even in standard
---
Huh that's strange, I wonder why they decided to do that. Thanks for letting me know!
---
If you mean Standard, I prefer it because standard formats change more significantly more often and have restrictions that make deckbuilding more appealing to me. I prefer the restrictions over the blank slate and unfettered power level of eternal formats.
---
This is good against warrior.
---
Frost Nova + Doomsayer
---
What is this, 2016?
---
You can wait until the end of the month when the full set is revealed, so I'd recommend doing that. In a general sense, though, the 50$ you spend on 50 packs and a golden legendary is higher value (in terms of packs/dust per dollar spent) than anything else other than a few Wild bundles, so you would get more mileage from that money by spending it on a pre-order, be it for SoU or a future set.
---
Stats are... Nice.
