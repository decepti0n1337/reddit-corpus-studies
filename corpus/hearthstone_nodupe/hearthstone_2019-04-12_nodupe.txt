yup, really strong, just "steal" opponent's late game cards
---
---
---
lol that's a huge lie, people get shadowbanned on some subs just for posting in other subs
---
Finally a proper thread for the deck. 
---
Gonna save for future reference. 
---
I really enjoy the deck as well, but my list is far from refined. So much to experiment right now!!
---
Beast Hunter with zuljin is a strong deck with multiple win conditions as far as I can tell
---
[[Nine Lives]] 
---

---
[[Kirin Tor Tricaster]]
---
[[Dragon Speaker]]
---
Personally I think people are sleeping on heal/mech pally. Kangor's Endless is an insane card if you build a deck around it, only really need 4 different mechs and with all the leftover space you build a heal archetype deck.

---
Yeah! Every mech hunter list I've seen so far has used it. Seems really powerful when activated with fireworks tech or nine lives.
---
Yes? So if I were to argue that I just saved 5000 gold to open the packs, would you *als* argue that I should not consider the 10-pack legendary because hey, maybe I preordered and opened *those* packs first?
---
How does this work, exactly?
---
Shhh
---
So a 25% chance to stay alive, a 1 in a 100 chance the next random legendary drawn is Tess, a 50%  chance the minion that spawns copies of spawn minions is spawned before the minion with charge and windfury.  Seems fair.
---
Blows my mind Wondrous Wand isn't running away with pick %. When I first saw Heistbaron, I thought it would just be "ass a Wondrous Wand" to your hand. Turns out I was right on the winrate, but the mob ain't too smart I guess. Not surprising in hindsight that Zarog's Crown is the highest pick. It could be anything! Even a Heistbaron! At least it is by far the second-best card to choose from.
---
I have also opened about 90 packs, got the gold just from doing dailies, not much effort put into it. I've been playing since beta so I have most of the classic set and I have opened around 90 packs previous expansions. I can play most of the decks freely - unless I have to craft 2+ legendaries. F2P player, it can be done but it isn't very beginner friendly. It requires playing for over a year to be able to have fun in the first two weeks before the meta settles down and not worrying so much, if the legendary you crafted will be in tier one decks or not.
---
3 mana 4/4 the value
---
I‚Äôve been playing the wiz decks, since I‚Äôm not ready to drop money on the expansion yet. I‚Äôve enjoyed it at rank 20-15, and I haven‚Äôt played in almost a year. I spent way too much before so I was pretty bitter about how bad it‚Äôs been, but I may purchase a bit again if it continues to be enjoyable.
---
I think he is unfair at 7 mana with 7 armor. The value comes from the warrior class.
---
Bonobo the real heal Druid runs Maly and Jepetto. 3 Lucentbarks and 2 Malys is the real way to win.
---
I‚Äôm normally stuck around Rank 4/5 but I plowed into 3 today with Zoo Warlock in like 15/20 games
---
I think it's more he regrets doing it since the opponent got a free five 2/2s and had enough mana to cast buffs on them aswell.
---
If control shaman becomes the most popular deck, then otk Hunter will spike in popularity because it destroys control shaman
---
I was wondering where the dust come from. I got a golden genn on the WW pack but already got the dust for him and dusted right away. I guess I was lucky enough this time!
---
It's really iffy, even in the same card. For example, I got the lackey that gives +1 attack and rush. I put that on Prelate, traded it, and drew it again later. It still had the +1 attack, but not rush.
---
This game will die soon and they deserve it.
---
New expansion sucks.
---
I stopped buy bundles and pre exp, now as F2P i got 1 legendary in more then 35 packs.
---
New meta isn't fun at all and cannot be better next week.
---
See you Blizzy it was nice for a bit
---
I don't see how you got that conclusion. At most it's one 7/1Baron.
---
[[Hench-Clan shadequill]] is so above the goddamn curve he‚Äôs floating in orbit. 
---
Like it doesn‚Äôt matter how cool Priest‚Äôs other toys are, a 4/7 for 4 mana with a drawback that minuscule is nuts.
---
I'm not talking about cost at all. Just the unfortunate extent to which "ha wouldn't it be cool if I could ____" doesn't compete with "this is a lot of stats that I can cheat out reliably ahead of curve."
---
Hush, you're making Malfurion smile.  And I think by tomorrow Token will be the #1 deck in the game.

4/4/7 | Deathrattle: Restore 5 Health to the enemy hero.  
---
It's way too early to say. At present this is a key card in a tier 2 deck, but as the meta is far from solved murloc shaman could rise to tier 1 or drop off the list completely.  I expect it will remain tier 2

---
Any mirror match I have always comes down to elysiana. If they aren't running her, I win and if they are, things get a lot spookier
---
Control Warrior would like a word with you
---
Free Dust!
---
Ha, i took almost 50 minutes, because i opened one by one :P
---
We Care! Nice one man!
---
Nah, those games are varied and different and blizzard hates fatigue. They will live it being in the meta
---
Single target removal is a constant in card games generally and nothing new to this or any card game. Lightning Bolt and Terror in MtG have been killing minions since the very begining.
---
At least in Hearthstone, Assassinate costs five mana. It basically costs two in MtG (Terminate).
---
Granted, it does still suck to run into someone who has all the answers in one of your first hands of Hearthstone in quite a while.
---
How does the combo work?
---
Not even close to impossible. It's very common
---
Same here. Not just you.
---
*Well...met.*
---
*That...was a mistake.*
---
Still one of my favourite quotes alongside *One by one.*
---
I'd say Whizbang is a better golden card to pick up in a pack tbh.
---
Same here. I think it‚Äôs down
---
I got kicked out and have to wait 6 mins than its up to 8 and i cant talk with friends wtf blizzard
---
This seems to be true, the reality of why tracking is actually good. It just *feels* so bad lol.
---
yep, RIP
---
Looks like it's just NA, EU works fine.
---
Same in NA
---
yep down
---
Same. 6 minutes wait and rising.
---
I run 2 in bomb warrior. It can be a decent clear plus it's really great to play it to trigger all your boombots.
---
I was booted after a game, my wait time just keeps increasing
---
[removed]
---
It is. They *did* work, they do not anymore.
---
yes
---
Won in arena and couldn't get past the hurray screen, I hope I got credit
---
Same thing happened to me, that's why I came here.
---
Free packs for NA
---
Yeah, I just won a game of the Tavern Brawl. Better of counted.
---
NA. To be honest, I don't let any lost game get to me. I try to look towards what made me lose that game. Did I misplay by playing x minion instead of y? Should I have gone face or traded? Did I myra too early? Did I get to greedy? Additionally, I try to determine if there are any decks I lose to repeatably and try to determine how I can win that match-up. For example, Hard mulligan for Edwin vs Token Druid or knowing that I need to play Nomi to win this game because they don't have the board clear for it. Just take every game as a chance to improve rather than a number. Don't treat Rank 1 at 5 stars any different than a Rank 4 game.
---
it says that i wont be able to get in for another 12 min, and the number keeps going up.

Seems the same to me, expense-wise.

Yep, down

Yeah got disconnected during the tavern brawl. Now it says &gt;15 minutes wait.

Up to 12 for me

---
Most opportune crash in my life. I accidentally disenchanted my single Witch's Brew instead of making a second one, right as the servers crashed, so I don't think it actually went through.
---
I went to see all the spells that could have won him the game and there were actually four: the first one is brawl (not only he had to get brawl but win the brawl with Edwin which there was a chance of one in 8), lightning storm (if he highrolled 3 damage on all of my guys), warpath and shadowflame. From the 222 spells available in standard right now that guy is pretty lucky.
---
Down for me too. Im at a 15 min login estimate.
---
This sucks too - I was having a lot of fun with the new cards just now. =/
---
I guess you can slap him onto any deck, but you can't build a deck around him, like the dks, weapons or even the loas
---
Maybe just the first chapter then (which I believe is free) and at the very least you can buy the chapters with gold which is far different than cash only portraits.
---
All tables full :(
---
Same. Right as an arena game started
---
yep same here.
---
Priest just got a new killspell: Forbidden Words.  It‚Äôs a rare, so easily available.  can kill basically anything.
---
They also got Convincing infiltrator.  2/6 taunt deathrattle: destroy a random minion.
---
They also got Lazul‚Äôs Scheme, which can be used in combination with Cabal Shadowpriest to steal just about anything.  Those are epics granted.
---
They got Mass Hysteria in Rhastakan‚Äôs Rumble which usually kills all but one minion on the board (aldo rare).
---
And of course they always had Mind Control.
---
Priests can kill things.
---
I have never once seen a card game where people do not netdeck. It‚Äôs a part of the genre, and every competitive genre for that much. Not sure why people complain about it with hearthstone, but not when people pick meta characters in league or overwatch or [insert literally any game with a ranked mode].
---
You‚Äôre not clever for making this stupidly obvious observation.
---
I opened my pack and the pack is missing and my screen is stuck. RIP
---
I forget the exact set-up, but in Monster Hunt I was playing Tracker and had the passive where your spells cost 1 less, and your hero power could be used twice and cost 1 mana. The boss dropped a Fel Reaver on his first or second turn and I had an echo spell. I was able to mill his entire deck by the end of that turn.
---
Yup same, better be 9-2 in tavern and not 8-3!!
---
ill do you one better.
---
Blizzard getting DDOS'd by Lizard Squad. Fucking hell.
---
I was in the middle of a really good Rumble Run, too....... Guess that one's gone. Thanks Blizz.
---
Same
---
P2W??? Those are commons.  Pay means legendary cards not single target removals.
---
Since when are commons pay to win?
---
Free pack NA cmon blizz can‚Äôt have this nonsense 2 days into a new expansion
---
Hagatha‚Äôs scheme is really good. Might be one of my favorite cards this expansion. 
---
I think Dr. Boom‚Äôs scheme is going to be really good in control warrior. After 20 turns just play both of them and gain 40 armor.
---
Yep seems to be down. It's not just Hearthstone, but can't log into WOW either.
---
You can reverse disenchantments right after you do them, I bet it actually disenchanted lmao
---
*have
---
same
---
Yeah I played a little before the most recent expansion, Hunter did seem strong.  Honestly it's not my preferred deck, just cheap so good for now.
---
yea blizzard wtf I dont even have friends.
---
all right,,

Apparently Blizzard‚Äôs servers couldn‚Äôt handle the awe-inspiring night of... A Thursday evening.

"There should be an empty seat in about: &gt;15 mins" Was crafting some cards while it began to lag, hopefully it doesn't count me spamming the craft button
---
We're looking into this, thanks for hanging in there!
---
And to think people doubted me.
---
yeah my timer keeps going up started at 4 minutes now i'm up to 35
---
the card did what it's intended to do?
---
same shit here :(
---
I thought I was making a second one and impulsively clicked away, so I couldn't undo it. But then the card still showed up in my collection and was unclickable, and after I exited, I realized the servers had crashed.
---
Maybe my loss against bomb warrior with Elysiana in the bottom five in my deck won't count...
---
Was losing rumble over and over for an hour til it booted me, I think it's a sign
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
cake is a lie, I was first to be booted and requeue. had 1 minute, and the sprites disconnected me and when I tried to join again it was over 15 minutes
---
Same, right down to it happening while opening a pack.
---
I only plated Whizbang, and eventually completed some of the quest through a couple of KotFK that were included in a few decks, but now they are gone from good from Whizzbang's pool and you can't even buy KotFK packs.
---
We broke it!!!
---
Fucking figures it crashes the minute I log on.
---
[reminds me of flight of the conchords](https://youtu.be/NRdg1MOYxHo?t=12)

---

---
Same here. Won a tavern brawl game and it froze at the fireworks screen. Tried relogging and got the all tables full - wait time &gt;15 minutes.
---
I just got a new phone and my old one couldn't run Hearthstone so I started playing about a week ago.  I have 2 friends who have been playing for a long time one has been playing since about 2 weeks after the game release. I drew a Glinda Crowskin is one of my quest packs and thought it was good so I showed them. One put their phone down and quietly walked out of the room. The other pretended as he was just stabbed is the heart. Glinda makes every minion in your hand have echo for those who dont know.
---
Okay so that means for the opening turns of the game, you're down 2 cards. Seems good.
---
deathrattle won't trigger, deathwing would be on the board, so the board technically isn't empty
---
Yeah, exact same thing happened to me. Servers must be done.
---
Its fucked, I was kicked off the game - to be given this bullshit. Sick of Oceana being lumped in with NA and forced to suffer the bullshit queue times.; they need to make an Oceana region.
---
Heh.  
---
Silly weak ass mages.
---
You prepped the wand. So the worst thing would be 2 backstabs and prep. Thats the worst but a 0 mana espionage is nice and 0 mana tess or cutlass if you dont already have one
---
Sounds like a bomb warrior player salty about being countered.
---
Never had the 2 hour one ehh
---
This just in, people try to win in a competitive game!
---
if you wanna start, start. theres not gonna be a better time
---
Enjoying token Druid. Druid legendary working better than I expected
---
Control warrior is supposedly favourable against bomb warrior, so you may wanna tweak your deck or adjust how you play to make control more consistent.
---
Poor druid with no naturalize.
---
Lifesteal will heal you out of lethal
---
filming vertically and 90 degree view , name a worst combination of how to film a video.
---
But is playing big priest better than losing? The jury is still out.
---
Yeah I don't think they care about balance. I really recently being fatigued to death during Battle of the Bans. All they had to do was play a cheap board clearer so I couldn't pay any minions and forced me to draw until I had no card left. Literally won without doing any direct damage.
---
Ehhhhhemmmm, cough cough, red leather, yellow leather... HOW IS GIVING PLAYERS THE ABILITY TO COUNTER LEGENDARIES WITH COMMONS **P2W***?
---
yes , https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1116505390974423040
---
&gt;  We're currently investigating an issue affecting our authentication servers, which may result in free packs as compensation.
---
Been wanting to try Tess rogue this expansion but don't know which list to use. Mind sharing your deck list?
---
I believe the thinking was that the bomb's damage should have been converted to healing in the sense that the spell ought to be considered "his" because it was in his deck.
---
I‚Äôve tried to look into what life coach is doing recently, but I don‚Äôt watch twitch at all..
---
Do you happen to know what‚Äôs been going on with him??
---
When he was playing Gwent he seemed so pumped to make videos for youtube, but suddenly stopped.
---
All I learned from this is people under 40 are assholes.
---
One reason Kingsbane was so good was that you *could* heal and survive when attacking brings you under 0 hp
---
Don't think it's remotely fair to say it was a greedy move.
---
Before the change, there were a ton of posts asking for them to move to three full sets a year because Adventure sets didn't change the meta enough, ONiK being a prime example
---
&gt; (I tech in a \[\[Hungry Crab\]\] but you don't need to). 
---
I would argue against that. Not the Crab - but the 'you don't need to' right now. Sure we have Bomorrior and Waggleogue right now, but Murman is still an annoying deck.
---
Also I just like making up names for decks that frustrate me.
---
If you trigger lifesteal with a damage ability that would have killed you otherwise, you heal back and not die. Kingsbane actually works like that as well.
---
Funny thing is, I'm pretty sure \[\[Hallazeal the Ascended\]\] *would* have healed Kripp in that situation. Or maybe the mine from the \[\[Iron Juggernaut\]\] is coded differently from the bombs, in which case, well fuck me.
---
Are these for a single player having a bug once or an actually outage?

6/6/5 Mech | Battlecry: Shuffle a Mine into your opponent's deck. When drawn, it explodes for 10 damage.  
---
It‚Äôs weird because corrupted blood is affected by spell damage and velen and is also a ‚Äúcast when drawn‚Äù card
---
Omg this is beautiful how have I never seen it üòÇ
---
the only deck worth investing is espionage rogue. its day one craft for me since the card came out. and also casino mage if you interested
---
So when was your 40th birthday?
---
- While there were a ton of decks on the first day, a good number were actually fairly similar but just brewed by different people. It's hard for us to mircomanage the lists, so we just posted everything the three sites gave us. 
---
- We understand that traffic to them is exponentially higher in the first hours right after expansion, so the show runners themselves are many times more active during the first day. After some time, they probably have a higher standard on choosing which decks to post.
---
- We only post what they give us, so while streamers are still trying stuff out, the less successful stuff shows up far less frequently after the first day.
---
- Granted, the ubiquity of HS Replay is weeding out the unoptimised and low performing elements of decks many, many times more quickly than, say, Un'Goro.
---
Go take a bath, that feels dirty.
---
Initially to draw and explode the bomb and then discount my next card. The bomb shouldn‚Äôt actually have a ‚Äúcost‚Äù per say. It‚Äôs not exactly a card, it‚Äôs more of an effect token, that‚Äôs the source of the confusion.
---
And I guarantee you I‚Äôm not the only one confused by these interactions :)
---
Why are you loving the expansion? It's day 3 and already the meta is stale. Every game is just vs Bomb Warrior (which is basically a prebuilt deck because of blizzard's forced synergy) or tempo rogue, with some occasional poor souls trying to play other classes. It's not a good sign when the meta is stale as fuck this early, not to mention Bomb Warrior is probably the most anti fun deck for quite some time.
---
Well Imgur is messed up, It added an image from a different highlight to this one, the rogue one is obsolete, but still cool :)
---
For the far sight not to discount the bomb, honestly the way blizzard handles these shuffle tokens is pretty stupid, it should be it's own type of card. The intent is that when the player runs across it it casts when drawn, it shouldnt interact with anything else.
---
But they are making an adventure this expansion! /s
---
That comparison is asinine since we're talking about digital card packs (loot boxes, essentially). Each expansion has been largely more of the same thing and by now you know roughly what you're getting when you buy Hearthstone cards.
---
It'd be closer to preordering a Fallout 76 expansion pack that cost 80 bucks and had more of the same.
---
Nobody denied the potential though
---
r/iamverysmart is &lt;- that way
---
I wouldn't, it takes a long long time to have a collection that is fun to play.  The game is pretty fun if you've already been playing for years, but it's hard to get into to start with unless you spend a lot of money.
---
Well you're in luck cuz Khadgar mage decks with freeze spells, draw spells, and conjurers are currently busted. You dont even need Khadgar lol. Your opponent literally cant do anything unless he has an aggro deck.
---
Also, mages currently are in the top 5 (4th) classes currently, so stop complaining. You're only below Deathrattle Hunters, Murlocs, and Boom warrior.
---
If this is serious... That's so american of you. "I decided to spend my day waiting for a server to work, if it doesn't, you owe me everything and your mother as a compensation"
---
This is from opening a Black Cat from the Witchwood packs after rotation right?
---
Sir, this is a Wendy's.
---
Hellfire?
---
My dragon paladin has a 4 mana 10/10. Pretty easy
---
6/0
---
I have no clue.  I opened my Witchwood pack like 2 days ago and have logged on since then.  Makes sense though.
---
Yes they did... just like you have people saying this is ‚Äúthe worst card ever printed.‚Äù
---
I had a second thought of what I commented earlier. The whole mechanic has a number of inconsistencies so there should be a number of correct variations that they need to follow.
---
In this case either it should not draw the bomb or have the minion‚Äôs cost reduced and trigger the bomb.
---
Thanks for pointing it out.
---
That is how it works with Soularium, I played it into a bomb. Bomb went off and then I got a card which didn't discard itself at the end of the turn.
---
Damn I miss Wall Priest
---
it also gets empowered by spell damage
---
Remember when they hall of famed coldlight oracle as it ‚Äúprevented opponents from playing the decks they had constructed‚Äù then intentionally created an archetype that could only be countered by destroying your deck and replacing it with total garbage?
---
I have experienced 0 of that, besides server crashing, and i only play on my phone/tablet. You sure its not what youre playing on, or you're internet. If its IOS thats your problem right there.
---
Anyone find a way to make Lady in White Priest work yet? There are SO many high hp minions right now! It will probably end up being a pretty slow deck no matter what, but priest has a ton of good removal and defensive cards now....hmmmm

This is a time for experiments. Maly hunter, freeze mage, big mage, wall priest, mechathun Druid/lock,
---
Im 1 minute into the video, and hell yeah im loving it already. The rating system is good, wasn‚Äôt expecting something like that hahaha
---
No onle this but this is a first meta after new dlc when games are 30min long :D
---
It‚Äôs still like the top 10% of the player base, it‚Äôs a pretty reasonable assumption that somebody would be familiar with doomsayer by that point.
---
&gt;What a way to dismiss an overpriced model relative to other video games
---
You're intentionally comparing it to something it's not meant to be compared too. It's not fair to compare it to "other video games", because 
---
A) most video games you play for 20-40 hours &amp; then never again.  Hell, GoW was a fucking fantastic game, I platinumed in like 20-30 hours, literally 100% done, nothing left to do.  It's just a piece of useless silicon on my shelf now.  
---
B) A better analogy would be MTG.  Go ask MTG players if spending $80 on a pre-order for a MTG set will give you 100% of the cards, they'll laugh you right on out.  They have single CARDS that cost way more than that.  
---
Comparing a CCG to a single player story-based game like Spider-Man is a fucking absurd comparison.  It's beyond apples &amp; oranges, it's more like apples &amp; tonka trucks.
---
I agree I was frustrated. Thanks for bringing me back to a clear state of mind!
---
KILL DA HOE
---
Nice strawman. Can‚Äôt wait for all the threads about how people are sick of games being decided by RNG.
---
BIG DICK SHAMAN DOESN'T CARE FOR LITTLE MURLOCS OR DOOMSAYER
---
Yeah I understand that and I agree. After calming down from my initial reaction I realize that my luck was unlucky compared to the majority and most likely me if I run again. I just got creamed by decks that are considered best right now.
---
RDU was saying it‚Äôs an auto win against warrior but he was having trouble surviving against aggro since it takes a while to get the combos going.
---
Well token Druid is the best crushes everything but zoolock and zoo is mediocre. 
---
Spell hunter is ok. although I run a different version than the standard Malygos. I use a midrange hybrid spell build. Think it‚Äôs better, I don‚Äôt like the risk of drawing Malygos  or Alex too early it usually means you lost. 
---
Card draw is now at a premium so raiding  party and masters call are broken. 
---
Murloc shaman is mediocre but can lose steam fast. Only reason it is even playable is because of angler and the death rattle spell. 
---
Paladin is basically unplayable. They lost their best control tools and draw tools.
---
Mage is meme at best can do nutty things with khadgar. But they are dealing with similar issues as Paladin only just slightly better off
---
Priest can only play some inner fire type deck. 
---
 I don‚Äôt think there are a lot of viable decks atm. Nowhere near where it used to be. We don‚Äôt actually have any new mechanics in the game they are literally advertising this set as a callback to old sets. And schemes literally read if you get  them early enough they do something powerful otherwise next to useless. The expansion is basically a let‚Äôs rotate and hall of fame draw and introduce cards that make or break decks based on when you draw them and are so game changing that it will mess with specialist format for the viewers. Because make no mistake all they care about is new players and grandmasters. In spite of taking a year to reduce the power level and RNG of cards like they said they would we still got a set that pushes RNG even more than before. I for one lost a couple games tonight because I forgot I was playing and got distracted by my phone. It‚Äôs hard to focus on the games anymore.
---
PepeHands
---
Serves you right for playing bomb warrior.
---
Whenever a rando adds me, I always offer them 80 gold if I have it. Hopefully one day, I'll show a Salt Rager the errors of his ways.
---
yeah... then they would have to plan ahead and have an overall game plan. for me it seems like the rules are made up on the go, when a new expansion, and therefor mechanic is implemented. Thats the point where blizzard thinks about the interaction with old cards and mechanics and figures out how they should interact. 
---
Thats why they cant release rules that count for future cards... 
---
they would limit themselves and people would be outraged if things work differently to the released rule book. theirs no advantage for them to release a rule book.
---
It's not like he'd have won without Rafaam clown Fiesta against your op deck
---
I both love the Rise of Shadows launch AND hate Bomb Warrior with the fury of a thousand suns
---
&gt;Because I used to enjoy the game and check on the subreddit to see the direction it's headed.
---
Or, you know, claim the game will be dead in a year because they didn't give out a free legendary (which they did).
---
You're rarely going to get anything positive out of this sub, so if your only experience w/HS is browsing whatever is pissing people off the most, your view is going to be tainted as fuck.

I did that too.
---
I mean, I'm not making a case about it's power, but specifically the previous comment was 
---
&gt;Well look at that, the only 3 classes with hero cards anymore are 1st, 2nd, and 4th.  *pikachu meme
---
Warlock has a hero card.  Having a hero card doesn't instantly make the deck op, as the tone of the previous comment seems to indicate.
---
I play normal control warrior which counter bomb warrior.
---
If I had 1000 gold I would buy 10 packs of the same set to get my legendary. 
---
You already have the welcome bundle which includes 10 classic packs &amp; dragon legendary &amp; also bought the new decks bundle (which im not familiar with unfortunately) but I would assume you have a pretty decent collection of standard cards by now.
---
I would pick up 10 RoS packs &amp; get my legendary from the new set &amp; have some RoS cards to spice up my classics, but this depends on the fact that you have a decent classic card collection able to cover the core of the decks you want to play with the RoS cards adding the extra flair ;)
---
Do you want to win or have fun?
---
They should remove the mech tag
---
What are you considering low stats?
---
[Here's a list of standard legendaries.](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards?display=1&amp;filter-premium=1&amp;filter-rarity=32&amp;filter-show-standard=y&amp;filter-type=4&amp;sort=-attack)
---
I would consider anything above 3/3 to not be 'super low stats', and by no stretch of the imagination is it very common to have all 3 options &lt;= 3/3. There's only ~15 cards with that low weighted stats. And if you are considering low rolls, you also have to consider high rolls where you get at least one option with stats &gt;= 7/7, which is way more likely and has a HUGE impact.
---
I mean it did though, they will never top the money they made in 2017.
---
BIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEETCHIII!
---
I‚Äôve been having fun with a modified version of the aggro mech zoolock. I go a lot lighter on the mechs than the list on your site and run explodinator over hench clan hag.
---
&gt; Boom's scheme: proper value after 11 turns compared to branching paths and greater healer potion
---
Neither of which are in standard anymore though...
---
Reminds me of toy annie.
---
Half of its done.
---
https://youtu.be/knFSsSXZw9E
---
With the cards i have i cant make a decent proactive deck since im only f2p :'(
---
Why hasnt the banner changed in my phone??
---
What's the difference again?
---
* 100 Gold: Obtain every Classic Card.
---
* 11 Gold: Obtain Gold Portraits of every class.
---
waterniggas master race
---
Between?
---
Some dust would be nice.
---
People are always comparing hearthstone and physical card games in terms of price but this is exactly why I dont' spend money on the game anymore. You don't own anything.
---
You forgot the bomb. Oh, how I hate the bombs
---
It takes real skill to be bad at something completely rng based.
---
How?
---
inb4 polymorph
---
No I mean what do the different animals signify each year? What changes?
---
Obey the call
---
It's good to keep going back. Everytime there's a new expansion, the card pool changes.
---
If you dislike rng go play Gwent and enjoy playing a dead game because it's boring as fuck to watch.
---
I would have done so too. At least it wasn't the skyrim intro again, right?
---
Well... no one mentioned Dr boom scheme... wonder why *whistles*...
---
Mammoth had Un‚Äôgoro a land filled with prehistoric creatures (very obvious) . Frozen throne an icy wasteland known as northrend (Ice Age) and Kobolds and catacombs underground stuff (archeology)
---
Thanks. And when will that happen in your experience?
---
It‚Äôs sets the theme for the expansions
---
Would u post it in the sub? 
---
I‚Äôll share it among my friends of course.
---
*hex
---
Oh so were gonna get another blackrock type expansion because dragons? Or maybe Hour of twilight?
---
Not really apm. There's no roping. Other than trying see how fast you can kill the boss with stones.
---
Meh. I only spent 10 dollars and got enough to make a deck that I‚Äôm really digging. They give you plenty of free packs. 10$ is nothing for the 9(?) packs you get

Try silence priest. Its the mist annoying and powerfull one i keep facing
---
I read this in Jaraxxus‚Äô voice
---
That‚Äôs even worse luck than the end of my first run. 3 drawn in a row with me at 15 and only 3 bombs in my 16 card deck.
---
Honestly, the biggest issue is the dust values for disenchanting. Once upon a time it made sense sure, but with there being such an insane amount of cards in the pool now it's near impossible for casual or new players to even get their foot in the door and enjoy what the game has to offer. At the very least I feel it should be changed to getting half back of the original cost. Because as it is right now, getting 400 dust a legendary is incredibly sad. It discourages playing other classes because you have to commit so much to one. Whizzbang is somewhat helpful sure, but that takes away from the fun/enjoyment of building a deck from scratch and fine tuning it, which the game really discourages.
---
Yeah - there are some really fun decks at the moment and actually I‚Äôve played a few that are relatively cheap but still interesting and decent. I‚Äôm really enjoying the expansion so far. 
---
Enjoy that Mage deck!

It definitely didn‚Äôt get insane hype. Reactions were very mixed with a lot of people thinking it wouldn‚Äôt see play.
---
Cool!
---
If that‚Äôs not a secret can you share your deck :)
---
Face Hunter is good tho, unless they have a taunt
---
It's the best launch since the last launch because I get to farm rank 20s on Brawliseum once again. Currently have a total W/L of 44/14 across 5 runs and I must say, I could get used to it. Regarding the meta decks I gotta admit Bomb Warrior is a little Pepega but I've mostly been using Tempo Rogue so I guess I'm not that much better.
---
To be fair, if it came down to fatigue, elysiana vs elysiana, and you couldnt finish them off while they were drawing sub-par cards after sub-par cards, its not really a case of "he was lucky, you lose, period".
---
Sure there are things you can do about it. You can use your value tools optimally, thus allowing you to just stick one mid sized thing on the board with others in hand for back up, for starters.
---
ARTHSTONE
---
clearly you haven't ever played a control warrior mirror
---
Maybe you should read the card text: it deals 5 dmg to not mechs
---
*Cries in Secret Paladin*
---
Weree they both mechs?
---
Yeah... I'm the ignorant one that doesn't know how to copy a digital book. This is fun. Keep it up.
---
Really dislike going against the deck, but that's because it sorta counters mine. I'm control shaman and now tech'd in Harrison Jones specifically for this match up (the fact it helps with bomb warrior is just a bonus) 
---
As i wasnt a fan of going through 45 cards, 15 of their's costing 1 just to lose to a 1 cost shuddawock which competes tess' battle cry and swatting insects later .... dead haha 
---
Very good end to the game, actually tried to add the person to say i got a good chuckle over that end ..... but i can understand a deck thats just RNG Fiesta gets a lot of hate when their opponents lose
---
This is why I‚Äôm a huge proponent of using report functions in gaming, if your given tools to whittle the toxicity out of your community it creates a more pleasurable experience for players that are willing to conduct themselves civilly.

We all know how blizzard works. 6 mana 4/6: battlecry: remove all card that did not start in players deck from the game.
---
Token druid is good if the meta isnt focused around it. If it ever becomes the spotlight deck, it loses slot of its potential because people tend to not take the 1/1 and 1/2 and 2/1s as a a threat until they are being hit in the face with savage roar.

I think it‚Äôs easy tier 1. The forest‚Äôs aid was a SLEEPER, I thought it would suck but against those warriors, 4 boards of 10/10 treants just can‚Äôt be removed. 
---
You only need 3 of the total 20 treants to survive stick a turn, then you can OTK with a 10 mana savage roar x2+ blessing of ancients Combo, it‚Äôs insanely good
---
And that‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt win way earlier if they don‚Äôt have brawl or whatever of the AoE they carry
---
Warpath brawl and dynomatic says otherwise
---
Nomi is fine, you will have alot of fun with him, specially in rogue deck ;)
---
Loot Hoarder and Thalnos died after your end turn phase had begun. So the minions Betrug summoned didn't die, as your end of turn phase had already begun.
---
Ideally, I think they should die at the end of your next turn, but according what some others have verified, it seems like they don't die at all. I haven't verified this myself though.
---
I would suggest changing out the Town Crier for a Archivist Elysiana
---
just saying, ur understanding is not crap
---
Sge summons a mech...
---
Token Druid feels very consistent. I wasn't very good with it in the past, but thanks to Whizbang, I had to play it already a few times since rotation. The lack of AOE right now makes even the Whizbang Token Druid very strong.
---
I'm sure it will remain Tier 1, especially with a refined list. Rogues soon need to tech in Vanish just for this matchup, if Token Druid becomes more popular.
---
Then the deck fills ans Nomi's not triggers
---
Lol I was surprises there was no Elysiana)) makes sense
---
Iirc current control warrior run Dr Boom, omega assembly, and occasionally dragon roar, right?
---
Thats already quite a lot of stuff you can throw on the board to force removal. By the time your opponent is playing Elysiana, there is a hard limit on just how much removal they have left. Same is true for your opponent, but surely at some point you could have saved something up to get better value later, or used something earlier to enable a minion to draw removal at another point.
---
I play it a lot and it‚Äôs great, every time I play against it as another class, I lose so badly (as maly hunter or rogue). It seems crazy good and it can only lose by getting out boarded or burst by aggro
---
I‚Äôve lost against secret paladin the most, ironically.
---
I don't think there is one for Magnetic..
---
At least I haven't seen it.
---
I tried so hard last year to keep up. But, I got so busy in college, I stopped playing for a few months. When I got back in, I legitimately could only play Whizbang without just losing all the time. So, I'm just hoping to get a few fun decks to play and builds where i dont have to play Whizbang
---
Random is random ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Its in a tier 1 deck lol..
---
Wtfff lol.
---
One weapon breaker and gone.
---
(unlike kingsbane)
---
Are you slow? I never said anything in my original comment about token Druid or any other deck.
---
I think people got mad with how art and flavor dont fit the card but yeah it was an overreaction. I am personally madder with how Sorcerers Apprentice has better stats than Khadgar lol.
---
I know this is a joke but I got it turn one from pilfer. It helped me activate all my conditional cards and stuck around till we went into fatigue. For once, the card wasn't actually bad. 20+ armor for 4 which gave my Fences rush etc wasn't that bad!
---
Do you want to add me? I‚Äôm happy to do 80 gold quests with you or even just play for fun or practise.

No. I don‚Äôt play any one deck. If a deck is a problem, I call it out. I‚Äôm not even saying any deck is a problem right now. It‚Äôs too early to tell. All I‚Äôm saying is the potential is there.

[[Flame Leviathan]]
---
Classic set? Hearthbot, what card is this fellow talking about
---
Khadgar is a pretty shit wizard
---
So quick question.
---
ApxVoid has been playing this deck, but with 2 MCT's instead of Raven's.
---
I too am trying this, and having bit of a success, even without Khadgar, or kalecgos or even the 2 Power of Creations.
---
Which out of Khadgar or Kalecgos is the best to craft for this deck or any Mage deck in general?

7/7/7 Mech | When you draw this, deal 2 damage to all characters.  
---
Nope. For almost any deathrattle minions, you basically want a bit low health, because you want to benefit from its deathrattle. The higher highmane's attack, the more things he can do (deal more damage to face, trade minions with higher health). So imho, I think a 6/5 highmane is wayyyy better than a 5/6 one :)
---
Khadgar is fuckin NUTS.
---
Just wish I was better at the game

You are lucky my freind üò≠

Priest lost 90% of its defensive/removal package so it's in a rough spot right now

Also I figured as much. Isn't classic. It's GvG

Other 2 options were \[\[Zilliax\]\] on an empty board and \[\[Face Collector\]\]

Not really, lich king was great in every deck cause of value, bar very aggro decks. I can‚Äôt see azalina being played in midrange decks, mostly just control

yikes

Miss him a lot

I tested it and it doesn't die! Amazing value! I'm going to make a terrible deck brb!

And I bought 50 packs and got 2 legendaries D;    I‚Äôve been playing this game since beta and still haven‚Äôt gotten a golden legendary.
---
Ffs /s
---
Yeah, with six cards in hand, why is the fourth card centred on the hero portrait? We can't achieve real symmetry...
---
Hearthstone games have to end some way or another. People complain about decks that burst, people complained about decks that played minions on curve like secret paladin, and people complain about decks that just stall the game forever like odd warrior.
---
1. That would need to be highly conditional if there is any body attached to it.
---
2. Dragon decks would prefer having low to medium cost dragons like Twilight Welp, Twilight Guardian, and Drakonid Operative over having to play bigger dragons.
---
3. That would be really rather annoying especially in Wild where something like Azure Drake could curve into Spikeridge Stead. It's a good thing Kangor's Endless Army isn't really seeing play, and making a better version of that card in Paladin would be inappropriate at best and more frustrating than Diamond Spellstone at worst.
---
4. Alexstraza already fulfills that sort of role in a game, and there should never be a card in any game that comes with a thirty point lifeswing. Even just deal five to the enemy hero and heal five would probably be too much on a minion.
---
No taunt...
---
Never seen Zilliax heal a minion
---
nice, you got rid of the secret.

It's especially disappointing when you see how great the other three golden cards are. Chalice has got to be one of the best ever.
---
Odd Rogue was middle of the pack for most of last year, vS had Rogue as the 6th most played class in their most recent report.
---
na trading 80 quest you go first :P DigitalStyle#3242
---
This happened to me... What‚Äôs wrong with Vereesa?  I don‚Äôt play hunter haha
---
And what's wrong with that? Literally every digital game makes you learn it by trial an error (and minor tutorials like hs also has). Its not a problem in 99.999999% of games, why would it be here? Even super competitive games with millions of $ involved in esports dont have any sort of guide how every mechanical interaction is supposed to play out.
---
The light shall burn you!
---
BRUTAL. SAVAGE. REKT.
---
I've found it more to be just Mechs being super boring alot of their cards are just above the power level of most cards from other classes.
---
They still have the incredibly good deck of Mech Warrior but just got even more good cards while being relatively untouched by rotation while all their competition has been nerfed or rotated out.
---
HE HAS. SOME SWEET. FEATHERS.
---
Are yall loving spectral games more than Tog pick? I am!
---
I think it fits in a control paladin deck because often youll be near death and your opponent (bomb warrior, murloc shaman, huntard or spam druid) will be full hp.
---
Also wdym "3 timesas hard as mage" mage has the lowest winrate rn lmao.
---
Oh sweet I didn't know Master Oogway was in hearthstone
---
Not really a cop out, it is 100% because he is legendary.
---
Cool, ill think about making a golden one afterall :D
---
That doesnt make sense. There's barely been any decks that actively draw a lot to begin with. Maybe 1-2 ctun decks werent even that popular. But the important part is that its HS mechanic #8468131 that makes you feel helpless. You cant *not* draw. Even if you dont play active draw cards, the start of turn draw is like an inevitable clock.
---
Kinda funny to me how the situation in this picture was basically a common thing for rogue before
---
Good luck surviving the murloc early game with such a slow deck
---
It‚Äôs one of the better classes with cards like 0 mana deal 4 to a minion, a 2 mana 3/4 rush (not that good honestly) and overall good tempo cards like the 3 mana 4/4 hench clan that keeps growing
---
We can think of many ways to allow that, but it won't happen due to Blizzard's business model.
---
They are trying all the time to find and implement small things to increase sales. As an example, look at a history of Standard Brawliseum and see when it was held:
---
May 2, 2018
---
August 15, 2018
---
December 5, 2018
---
April 10, 2019
---
Except the first time (almost one month after a release of The Witchwood, as an experiment), they were scheduled just after an expansion's launch. Why? If you want to participate, you need new cards available. They have realized very quickly, that it is a driving tool to increase a demand for new cards. So at this point you need to have plenty of gold saved (which requires a lot of time commitment prior to that) or buy with $$$. Holding such an event later allows players to grind their cards, which is not a desirable outcome for Blizzard.
---
I have around 10k dust, and I'm just looking to play for fun. What's the most fun deck so far? I don't care how much I have to craft.
---
So... people complain?
---
I think it's a reference to the other post calling DR Booms scheme cancer as a joke
---
‚ÄúGood luck surviving Murloc early game with 4 AoEs and a mind control tech‚Äù
---
Fixed that for you
---
Spell Power Hunter is actually a decent deck right now and Control Warrior is also a pretty good match-up for it.
---
I really hoped that for consistency sake the new Kalecgos card would use Malygos art
---
My man.
---
it looks disturbing.
---
Im in the same boat. But im horse shit at it. Im doing fine until mid game im full hp and my opponent is 12 and they vomit a full board and turn the game around completely. Insanely disheartening and i feel very lost. Im trying to just practice but its hard to do when i wanna shut my game off after losing by turn 9 4 games in a row :( ugh.
---
How have you managed that with the pity timer?
---
Here's a website that simulates pack openings.  It reports 1 hypothetical result in the expected distribution of results.  Each time it refresshes, it reports what a different player's results would be opening the same number of packs. I don't know what number generating model it is using, but it may help.  I ran 1 pass opening 415 of RR packs (more epics, I know) and it came back with 49 unique epics.  [https://speedodevo.github.io/packr/](https://speedodevo.github.io/packr/)

---
Is Nozari really great? (Please say yes, it's the only legendary I have from RoS)
---
You're all praising Zilliax, but you'll see: when the machines take us over, you know he'll be leading the charge, with all his unity, precision, perfection.
---
You don't need every legendary, most of them aren't good.

I've found the control vs control matchup to be way more fair if I tech in healing, oozes, and Archivist Elysiana. (I still try to play her at the first turn of fatigue, but there are some rare cases where she helps me get rid of bombs)

Yeah the only minions I run is Jepetto, Windrunner, Alex, and Malygos. There is enough control and damage to close games out the turn after you play Jepetto.
---
Or is it expected? We are on Reddit, and I see the office stuff all the time on here

I've been playing since closed beta and I am running out of deck slots. Just because you don't need them doesn't mean other people don't I'm not the only one either.

Like literally how does one not have zilliax in this day and age ? He's in literally every deck and it's the one legendary that's the best for your buck. Just like the lich king was
---
Some people are teching in a Brewmaster with [[Archivist Elysiana]] for control match ups and bomb warrior mirrors. Can make for some terribly long matches, if nothing else. Dog used it with control shaman and had something like an hour long game against bomb warrior yesterday.

True, forgot about the 5 damage he got in with that extra round.

Yeah sadly mage has all the value and tools except for the healing, which makes the deck terrible.

The biggest sign of if a card is overpowered is whether you'd still play it if it was nerfed. This card would still be totally playable at 3 mana.  
---
Then again, sometimes it's fine to print an above-curve card to prop up a weaker deck. We'd have to see how the meta shakes out.

It probably won't be the very best deck in the format, but it should be the best deck for its dust cost, and it is right in your budget assuming you have none of the cards in it.

You need Level 20 combined across ALL heroes, beating the innskeeper on easy mode with each hero is Level 20. When you log back into your main account you'll have the skin (and a classic pack if I remember correctly)

40mins job ;)
---
Espionage red players?
---
As always with questions like this....or else what exactly? lol
---
ACCURACY IMPLIES CLOSE TO PARAMETRIC TRUTH, PRECISION IMPLIES LITTLE VARIANCE BETWEEN MEASUREMENTS OR ATTEMPTS
---
SORRY, CARRY ON
---
I‚Äôve been experimenting a lot with both archivist and Rafaam and in my experience they‚Äôre...not good? I hesitate to say that because both of them are really good sometimes. But the issue is neither of them are cards I want to just run in my deck. Rafaam is a 7 mana 7/8 taunt which is really good but it also gets rid of all your reactive spells, so I usually just die because I no longer have any way to swing a board.
---
Archivist has a different problem. She‚Äôs really good in late game fatigue and value wars, but most decks don‚Äôt really want to do that. So in most decks you‚Äôre just paying 8 mana for a vanilla 7/7 who wrecks your decks game plan and , if you‚Äôre playing her to cleanse bombs, puts you way closer to fatigue.
---
Again, I‚Äôve been playing mostly garbage home brews while I experiment with cards and it‚Äôs only been 3 days so I don‚Äôt want to make definitive statements but that‚Äôs my experience. The only two real counters to bombs aren‚Äôt very effective in that niche. It seems better to try to out armor/heal or to kill them before they kill you. But supercollider and the Boom hero card are hecka good
---
So this is the new Rag shot to Kel' Thuzad interaction now?
---
I seriously don't understand this problem. I always delete all decks after finishing playing for the day. This could be partially due to my OCD but oh well.
---
I'm not really an expert, but I think most of them are decent.  There's some weirdness tho, like the priest deck with 2 divine spirit but no way to flip that (inner fire, topsy).  Its supposed to be a res priest, but it's just not good.  
---
On the flip side, murloc shaman, treant druid, and thief rogue are all pretty fun.
---
Not vulnerable to emp operative, clearly better.
---
Looks like Crush from Finding Nemo lol
---
It's hard to organize
---
Dosent matter, I did the same as kripp thing went from 15 to 5, no lifesteal. I don't get why it doesn't work...
---
Yogg would be interesting to cast. You can probably have a tool similar to MTG's [ask urza] (https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/unstable/askurza) but resolving targets and values for yogg would take an absurd amount of dice rolling.
---
Do you find Magic Trick to be a good addition? It seems bad to me.
---
Should hover over boomship as you won't discard your hand..... but also worry about brawl
---
Decklist? I always feel my hand get's too clogged up to even bother with Tak &amp; AE combo.
---
To be honest, this would probably be a terrible deck.
---
Burned bombs do not explode.  Also useful against Corrupted Blood.
---
3-3 ain't bad for us filthy casuals!
---
I do have Whizbang and played the crap out of him the first couple days, but when it comes to Arena-style play I much prefer to have an actual single deck through the full run, even if it's worse than the average Whizbang one. I don't know why. I'm weird, maybe.
---
Anyway, I caved and spent a good portion of my dust pile on crafting some rogue stuff (Heistbaron, Edwin, and 2x Prep since I didn't have any) so I'll probably do alright with the brawl.
---
So it's not that I'm personally expecting a bad brawl experience, but that's specifically because I crafted stuff on day 3 and took a big risk. If Rogue ends up getting shat on by the meta, I'll be in a bad way until the next expansion.
---
Just wait until I reach turn 30!
---
Hahahahahaha
---
Yeah good point - fun is my priority to be honest and I‚Äôve really enjoyed some cobbled together Hunter decks so I think I‚Äôll be putting my dust into Hunter this expansion.
---

Zilliax can't heal minions tho, trash robot
---
 nerub#2134 EU Trading Challenge a Friend Quest
---
&gt; People are actually experimenting
---
I've found this to be the least experimental expansion yet. Currently at rank 6 and of my last 20 games 13 have been Bomb Warrior. In the Brawl I faced 8 Bomb Warriors.
---
That said I have been playing a handful of different decks so it's still pretty fun. Also I wouldn't consider Bomb Warrior 'unfair' so seeing it all the time could be worse. I agree that this expansion launch seems pretty balanced with no clear standout best deck IMO. All decks seem to have counters.
---
Big Nicol Balls is always enjoyable.
---
@Watermelon86
---
&gt;I just wish there was a Game Mode that somehow puts the focus on building weird Decks and compete with other weird Decks.
---
Just play casual. That's what I do. The only thing you sacrifice by doing this is progress towards golden hero portraits, but other then that, it's all the same. You still get gold. And everyone at the dumpster tier of casual is playing weird decks and making bad plays. Perfect place to test out your own weird deck.
---
He'll be leading the rush
---
I'm just over here playing Secret Paladin. :(
---
The art on Malygos is not actually Malygos but the other dragon.
---
Yeah me to - I got unlucky this expansion. Last expansion I pulled decent legendaries and got Jan‚Äôalai as the freebie. Didn‚Äôt quite get the same luck this time around!
---
Or innervate
---
Same. Like the most wins i got is around 200
---
After your secret triggers, ...
---
What do you think about it?
---
Khadgar is like that kid on the playground who leads a gang of beefy sixth-grade bullies, but curls up and starts crying if someone even fakes throwing a punch at him
---
I play a lot of casual and I don't run into a lot of strong decks in casual. If you are running into strong decks than I don't know what to say. I very rarely run into meta decks there, maybe once every 10 matches or so.
---
If you use Crystal Power on a minion with 2 health left, it will kill it, right?
---
Yes, love it actually.  It serves three purposes in the deck -  First, two spells with one card for your mana cyclone turn, so it actually increases your hand size.  Second, it can find card draw if you don‚Äôt have the combo pieces.  And third, it can find conjurer‚Äôs calling, which the deck is built around.

Then I'll farm you with my mech hunter :D
---
I like this answer! I get a bit obsessed sometimes about optimization vs. fun. Thanks for the reminder.
---
I say it at the beginning of my turn. Start to play out and see if they concede.  I‚Äôve even bluffed won a couple of paladin games while having two of the same horseman because the opponent wasn‚Äôt paying attention.
---
I‚Äôve considered this a few times but I can‚Äôt bring myself to DE all my other cards! 
---
As F2P it probably is the best way to make really decent decks in a smaller selection of classes.
---
In this case I'm guessing his opponent thought this would work and this was the first time they had a chance to pull it off.
---
Good explanation but cards that auto cast and spells cast by minions in hearthstone are the least intuitive mechanic. Some aspects trigger (overload say) as if you cast them others don't. 100% feels like they didn't think through coding then justified the inconsistencies. Broadly it seems with bombs the stuff triggered by drawing a card as if it's your own apply but not casting it, like you describe, though deck of wonders spells overload you as if you cast them. This is just wrong.
---
One mech‚Äôs primitive is another beast‚Äôs perfection
---
Polymorph
---
&gt; And set a standard for card text already.
---
Seriously.  An editor for grammar and consistency.
---
Polymorph?
---
That's just a ruse to try to trick our fleshy brains. In his second form he's going to have Charge, Mega Windfury, Poisonous, some overpowered Deathrattle effect, a Battlecry, probably some choose one and combo effects, among others.
---
I eant you, and you, and you.
---
You don't believe in the crafting system, so you disenchanted your wild collection to get dust for ... crafting things ???
---
That‚Äôs why I love new big warrior. So many ways to summon without DMH.
---
It's not that insane, Fiendish Circle is better most of the time.
---
Spellbreaker and really any silence effect
---
Spell breaker and Poly?
---
Pretty sure I used this last match (my first thoughts) on both of them in the Paladins deck, yet still one came around buffed?
---
Fixed
---
But it doesn't matter that his dupe commons are all of the same card or all from different ones ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
So very much /s
---
The Bomb says 'you take 5 damage'.  
---
Spells that benefit from lifesteal say 'deal X damage'.
---
If Lifesteal were to apply, it would say 'deal 5 damage to your hero'
---
You can copy paste the code of deck.
---
Also pretty easy to change into either control warrior or bomb/rush warrior :-)
---
Also at what rank are you?
---
Two Shield blasts, almost back to back. God, I hate that card.
---
Healdruid is such a painful deck to play... Either your opponent doesnt do any damage to you and you are just watching your hand clog up.
---
Or you get rushed down and if you manage to get lucentbark on board he gets sapped.
---
Or your opponent plays any amount of big minions and you have no more big minion removal because it rotated or got HoF
---
‚ÄúI like your class, I think I will TAKE IT!‚Äù

I dont know. Havent checked. I think at around 8

---
Helpfully, you do have a *chance* at discarding some or all of the bombs if you go this route, since you can't draw the bombs if your hand is already full and the damage won't trigger.
---
Otherwise, yeah, you're gonna get that Little Caesar's Deep Deep Dick Pizza, extra hot. *RNG be praised*
---
My bad, the card
---
There's people STILL asking for auto-squelch as if emotes are the most psychologically damaging things in the world and an in-game deck tracker because they can't be arsed to vaguely remember what cards they played. Deck slots are actually a basic need compared to that crap.
---
Wow, what a coincidence considering this offer is like 12 hours old by now...
---
He means the hero cards
---
Same, lol. I feel like the silly archetypes they make for priest never *quite* work... I end up running some variation of divine spirit/inner fire like always. But, I still like the creativity and interesting mechanics they print for priest, like Temporus for example.
---
Read OP's comment.
---
God forbid I'd want to keep some of my decks in Wild for old times sake. /s
---
Look at Darkest Hour Warlock in wild
---
Sure thing, it has 0 consistency. He just threw in stuff to see if there was a limit.
---
Or at OP's comment? People love to act without thinking.

Yeah, I was browsing /r/buildapcsales and came across it. Figured I would share here.

In a game with 9 classes each with multiple archetypes and 2 separate game modes? Are you serious?
---
RUIN
---
You can't make 2-class decks in Hearthstone, you're limited to one. However, there are a number of ways to generate cards from other  classes, especially in Rogue.
---
How about a nice relaxing back massage from him after a long hard day at work?
---
hot
---
Yeah when hench clan burglar was revealed, I said it was unhealthy RNG and didn't even consider it's a pirate that can be fetched by raiding party. The worse part is rogue has prep which can do combo into some pretty absurd stuff.
---
There's no cap on the amount of armor that Dr. Boom's Scheme can  provide. It could be 4 mana 20 armor.
---
*mmmpphhs
---
Then I would say good, unless there are a lot of ways to put a card from another class in your hand.
---
Missed the BM, 8/10.
---
Good to see him give up a life of crime and pursue geomancy
---
I feel like you just opened Pandoras box with that reply and am I'm quite scared of where this will go.
---
Two golden frogs? 
---
Highroll city.
---
But realistically, what is it gonna hit?  
---
If this tops 10 armor on average it starts to get into the "good" range
---
If they ever decided to do corrupted cards again I need a corrupted Ziliax just for this entry line
---
I think if the card is undamaged it will simply remain "undamaged" and thus be at full health when the maximum amount of health is reverted. It is a bit odd, though.
---
There is a button somewhere where you can do it, but it isn't advised for new players.
---
Oh not disagreeing, I think the card would be "crap" on your scale. Just ensuring you have the right context :)
---
Does he randomize the class that you want to play or just the deck?
---
Doesnt really change.   
---
A 1/1 for 1 with charge is meh, but a free 1/1 with charge who comes from your deck seems really good.

Yep, I don't like discover either. It was only fun early on and even then, the problem was seemingly obvious with zoolocks pulling power overwhelming and soulfire.
---
Same goes for similar mechanics like shadow visions, things that break deck building restriction (allowing you to have more than 2 copies of non-legendary or more than 1 copy of legendary) just annoys me. Unfortunately for me, HS has been like this since a long time ago. Just reminiscing about "good old day"..

&gt; espionage rogue
---
I know what espionage rogue is. just never heard of espionage rouge. Sounds like a twisted crayola crayon color.
---
&gt; "Nobody:___" is meant as "nobody is saying anything"
---
Shouldn't the meme be "Everyone:________" then? everyone is saying nothing?
---
just seems like a pointless format. like the message could've been conveyed with "espionage rogue" as text overlayed on top of thanos here right? i think that's pretty sufficient and more clear.
---
I would start by doing the dungeon runs to experiment with different classes. Also, once you find the class you like, still try to keep an open mind to other classes. Expansions will heavily impact how well classes perform. That being said, playing with more than one class will help keep your interest in the game when your favorite class isn‚Äôt doing so hot.
---
They have to program all the combination of spells together. Only about half of them work i think
---
you're an idiot.
---
drop mechanical welp as Dr. Boom and it rushes to clear a 2 health minion, then spawns a 7/7 mech thats also ready to rush and mow down your board
---
its not uncommon to play 3-5 mechs in one turn and they are all rushing (there is even a hero power two summon 3)
---
and yes, it is a creative nerf. the essence of the card remains in tact and the nerf comes in because it costs more mana to use the damage battlecry. are you thick? i know it doesn't confirm to the standard &lt;increase mana cost&gt; nerf blizzard normally does...
---
What is does is consistent though, even if you dont like it. Also it works the same with enchantments, if you power word shield a 3 health ancient watcher so it has 5 health, then silence it, it will be 5 health.
---
Inc eye for an eye :D

You can mimic Medivh‚Äôs or Varessa‚Äôs effect not just go for infinite value make some proper number it can activate

I made this lady in white priest that is doing very well. Only downside is games last a long time. But win rate over 70%
---
Thank you for the math, I was a little confused. Glad you could clear it up for me
---
Using this post to bring attention to the shudderwock dustvar horror bug. Please fix.
---
depends if the deck you wanna put him into has enough card draw or not.
---
It was you!
---
But I mean, if they increase the card count they probably have to increase the cost and OP‚Äôs back to his original problem of not wanting to drop more money
---
I don't think you remember that the "fucked up-edness" required for them to hand out play time were DAYS of servers being on fire.  They were down for an hour, back when that wouldve been called "every 3rd night".
---
I started by playing Dungeon Runs and, when it came out, Monster Hunt. Really helped to learn card mechanics in non competitive environment and practice developing synergies in decks.
---
This has barista synergy
---
Why would you dust 11k worth of cards with no plan on how to spend it? That seems pretty dumb.
---
Sometimes my opponent gives me a genuine "well played" mid match after I've done something good, and I hesitate on how to respond... I've said thanks, I've said well played back... I've said nothing.  Dunno lol.  Wish emotes would be expanded or just allow actual chat
---
Hunter would like a word with you
---
log out and in
---
Congrats on the promotion!
---
I stole her restart card that kept her at her life total, but her to 2, cast it.
---
&gt;Because when they remove half of your collection of cards you have been earning over the last year you want some form of refresh to get back into the meta.
---
If you really want to get into the meta ASAP then buy packs with money, like many of us do.  If you're really good at arena, then grind out games there to fulfill your needs.  They generally always give us something for free, but if it were to randomly stop, that's on them since they don't owe us anything.  People like you come off so damn entitled it's actually retarded.  
---
&gt;And no wild doesn‚Äôt count because it is full of broken decks that you can‚Äôt recreate without thousands of dust
---
Wild does count of it's what certain people enjoy.  Also, standard decks cost thousands of dust to craft as well lol.
---
Oopsie, only read top comments xD
---
Judging by the comments on this post, this sub is indeed inactive atm :P
---
You're arguing about power levels of the cards themselves, which is a *completely* different argument.
---
I..I love them
---
I honestly think actual chat would make the game so much *less* toxic.
---
‚ÄúUgh I hate that card lol. So annoying‚Äù
---
‚ÄúHaha I know, it‚Äôs great isn‚Äôt it‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIt would be a shame if I... silenced it! :D‚Äù

‚Äú:O‚Äù

damn i did a 12 and got 250, 2 packs and a gold rare.

I also hit the cap today, I don't even remember playing 30 games today, let alone winning 30. This new expansion really sparked a new interest in me. Just wish warrior wasn't so strong this time around. Archivist Elysiana is also turning already long games into even more absurdly long games against FUCK YOU I'VE GOT TWICE AS MUCH ARMOR AS YOU HAVE HEALTH BOOM BOOM MECH BOMB warrior.
---
He was the first legendary I opened. Didn‚Äôt feel great at a time when Rag and Sylvanas were in every deck.
---
Just opened a pack.  Got 3 legendaries in 1 pack,  and I only play Priest so I got even luckier that 1 of the legends was Madam Lazuli.

Sulthraze and Truesilver has been a rare sight for me. Mostly used against Waggle Pick (fuck that wep), spectral cutlass, wrenchcaliber and warrior 1/3 wep.
---
Weapon Project &gt; Harrison has actually been a decent play this xpac. Shit is cash
---
Came here to say this.
---
This is a stock response to questions about matchmating in a normal weekly tavern brawl.
---
I know.. lol
---
Yeah Elysiana seems like a mistake, I don't mind fatigue games when you have just a deck of 30 cards (or 34 with last years warrior) but having a fatigue game with 50/60 card decks is too much.
---
What about an hour long [Token Druid vs Token Druid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kyAUUAP6jE) game?
---
That's probably what happened, and the pinata was likely discovered by an Omega Assembly if it wasn't in the deck already.
---
 &gt; I know what espionage rogue is. just never heard of espionage rouge. Sounds like a twisted crayola crayon color.
---
Oh, I assumed you'd understand that it probably was the very common misspelling of rogue if you knew what espionage rogue was since you are on the HearthStone subreddit.
---
&gt; Shouldn't the meme be "Everyone:________" then? everyone is saying nothing?
---
Yea, I also thought this when I first saw it and it would definitely make more sense. Though I guess they went for the "Nobody is saying anything" approach and it stuck.
---
&gt; just seems like a pointless format. like the message could've been conveyed with "espionage rogue" as text overlayed on top of thanos here right? i think that's pretty sufficient and more clear.
---
Then it wouldn't be a meme. Memes aren't really made with the idea to make something clearer, as long as most people get it it's fine. 
---
It's like saying it would have been quicker to just say who was at the door instead of going through the whole "knock knock" routine. Sure it would be faster and clearer but it kinda destroys the point of it being a joke in the first place.
---
Got any numbers on Nat Pagle's draw rate since the 14.0 patch? Curious to know what the actual percentage is.
---
It is not a good deck if that is what you are looking for.
---
It struggles a lot vs fast decks (Token Druid, Zoo, Rogues, Murloc Shaman).
---
I read in another comment that you dislike aggressive Shaman but Murloc Shaman is pretty decent (High T2) and super cheap to craft (just 1 Legend and that is definitely replacable), so probably your best bet until the meta settles

Does Jaraxxus gain +1 attack when you play [[Impferno]]?

Wow, another person upset about a card being good. The card is great, not game breaking. It doesn‚Äôt generate infinite value, it gives you a minion every ~5 turns. Stop complaining about a card that‚Äôs good just because you don‚Äôt like it

3/-/- | Give your Demons +1 Attack. Deal 1 damage to all enemy minions.  
---
Just out of curiosity, what deck are you running? I‚Äôve been trying to make a late game Rafaam deck work, but been struggling
---
every class has an OTK. This one is just pushing poplar now with new swarm cards.  It is in the list with InnerFire Divine Spirit, Bloodlust and others that push wide board win-more like Odd Pally did.   Being classic they gives new players a change to succeed without a huge investment.  Its hitting now because the only real counter is Zoo Warlock which falls hard to Bomb Warrior and Tempo Rogue.
---
A PALTRY TASK!
---
Your assumptions are correct, and that 
---
&gt; And go with build around, and probably really strong.
---
nailed it. The deck running this card is named after it, and completely builds around finishing it as soon as possible.
---
What isn‚Äôt difficult, since The Caverns Below  is a so-called Quest and always in your opening hand. So you typically finish bouncing your stuff turn 6 or even earlier, and then slam down cheap 4/4s with Charge, Taunt, Divine Shield, Lifesteal and so on.
---
On its release the card only took 4 bounces to transform all your minions into 5/5s, but it got nerfed multiple times since then which is really uncommon for Hearthstone cards. And even now it still is a somewhat playable deck in Wild...
---
One of the most disliked Hearthstone cards ever I would say.
---
Its fucked, I was kicked off the game - to be given this bullshit. Sick of Oceana being lumped in with NA and forced to suffer the bullshit queue times.; they need to make an Oceana region my arse.
---
It has Sunkeeper Tarim.
---
Your candles flicker,
---
Maybe he lied
---
I just found the same. Did the same, left it for half hour, still the same. Not resolved.
---
Check HSreplay and see if you can make similar decks with the cards you have. Meta shifts can be frustrating at times and that might give you a good place to start building/ learn synergies of the decks
---
RUIN. DESPAIR. DESTRUCTION.
---

Surely I‚Äôm not the only one the definitely thought that Harrison jones was part of un‚Äôgoro right?

You are doing god‚Äôs work my son, let none try to convince you otherwise.
---
Because Jaina is an aura, and the moment you're not jaina, you lose the aura
---
&gt;I see your point but I just see net decking as the same thing as letting a older sibling beat a hard level in a game for me and expecting to have the satisfaction of saying that I beat the game.
---
The meta-game *is exactly* a matter of knowing what the best decks are, and knowing what the trends are that dictate which direction you need to fine tune your decks in. Almost nobody above rank 5 ***literally*** copies &amp; pastes decks from the Internet.
---
It‚Äôs just that you will, if you‚Äôre good at the game, naturally simply *know* what the best options are for general deck archetypes. But you have to work within those general archetypes if you‚Äôre going to be competitive. That‚Äôs not ‚Äúnet-decking‚Äù, that‚Äôs just playing competitively, and having an understanding of what works best. 
---
Sure, people in lower ranks will just copy &amp; paste decks from the internet. So fucking what? You act like this game is cheap. All they‚Äôre doing is being intelligent, and crafting decks they *know* will be good, because most people simply don‚Äôt have the resources laying around to be able to craft whatever they want. This game is fucking expensive if you want to ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù.
---
It just came out 3 days ago.  Everyone always super rushes when so many cards are removed and no one knows where the meta will settle.  When decks get refined to block aggro decks, things will slow down.
---
I‚Äôm not proud of doing this once or twice - my mistake was not thinking ahead, so I would buff a minion thinking I was going to do one set of things then after realize it was better to duplicate them and then buff. Thinking ahead is not my strongest suit.
---
the battlecry is summon a water elemental. the life steal is an aura

Is everyone really having problems with rouge healing 2hp per turn? Just beat them on board.
---
But before odd warrior was a thing, control warriors ran dead mans hand. Even if they only ran 1 copy, it essentially did the same thing as elysiana does now.
---
Sounds like a good player Beat a bad player despite a mistake
---
The question is not whether I am correct (I am), but rather how long it will take the rest of you morons to figure it out.

make an autocomplite zoo warlock deck, you should be able to win at least a game

Here's a table detailing arena rewards.

After a certain amount of wins (based on table it looks like it's only at 12, but I think I've gotten one with less), you can earn another pack from another expansion. It's always from current Standard sets.

Now.. they've been owing us a dust refund for Thermaplugg because Leper Gnomes got nerfed thus nerfing Thermaplugg &gt;:( blizzard consistency
---
&gt;with mage as hunter 
---
What?
---
Also, don‚Äôt disenchant anything yet. There are quite a few ‚Äúsafe disenchants‚Äù, but you probably don‚Äôt know what those are as a new player. You could very easily disenchant something actually **great** &amp; not realize what you‚Äôve done. New players don‚Äôt realize that legendaries like Bloodmage Thalnos (2 Mana 1/1 with Spell Damage +1 &amp; Deathrattle: Draw a card) are actually incredible, despite ‚Äúseeming‚Äù unimpressive at first glance. And the 400 dust you get from them isn‚Äôt going to be remotely worth it if you disenchanted a good legendary that will be hard to obtain later on. 
---
What legendaries did you get?
---
Keep trying! I hadn't played arena in more than a year--maybe even close to two. I only played because I had a backlog of free runs. Got lucky with a good deck. Played patient. Took smart risks. Then, got it!
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Truesilver has done this since launch too lol
---
I mean yeah, the whole game is based around drawing the right cards for your situation?
---
Idk i guess arena has just never been super fun to me. I‚Äôve had my fair share of 12 win runs too so its not that I‚Äôm bad it just doesn‚Äôt spark joy
---
"a card did something"
---
I go for 9's as well. First summon i got off of Astromancer post shadows was a King Crush.
---
Game winning card. And only because I got Divine Spirit from my Blink Fox lol.
---
I never understood how people use all 18 deck slots. I hardly use 4-5 at a time...
---
Wew
---
1. Blood Fury still hits for 3. Heroic strike doesn‚Äôt increase your weapon damage. 
---
2. Heroic Strike doesn‚Äôt even need a weapon to work. It applies the damage directly as an effect to your hero. 
---
3. That doesn‚Äôt change Blood Fury being unrelated to Jaraxxus attack.
---
It‚Äôs really amateurish to not also play the priest quest reward after becoming rag.
---
Bomb warrior is strong, i am simply not convinced its broken yet.
---
Haha bomb warrior in arena. I can't tell if that's something I want or not.
---
Rofl I hate Warrior too but my Malygos Hunter is 8-0 so far therefore both decks are cancer

---
I think there is a solution to the problem by changing the method of stars by not only by these victories is also influenced by the time of the game. Thus time has importance and increases risk.
---
Not sure about Nozari but so far Kal seems pretty good and potentially game winning if your opponent doesn‚Äôt remove it
---
Netheferious is asking if Jaraxxus's Attack changes when you play a card that doesn't buff weapons. Weapons increase your hero's Attack. If Jaraxxus gains +1 Attack with Blood Fury equipped, Jaraxxus will have 4 Attack.
---
I guess it‚Äôs to stop bots from farming too much gold.
---
The limit is pretty generous to human players as it takes a lot of effort to reach.
---
Thank you very much, I'm sorry to ask but could you post it in a comment, I'm a mobile user ^^;

Oh, I agree with you. I was just explaining the logic. People just notice that 30 dupes of one common over, say, 6 dupes of five separate commons.
---
Please consider doing a Rogue class specific list with appropriate class discover rate bonus for your simulation. I think it will be quite a bit worse due to the likes of Face Collector, Myra and Edwin Van Cleef.

The Jaraxxus interaction is one of the stupidest things in HS, and neither should work ever ever ever.

Mine is straight from the recipe with cards I didn‚Äôt like/thought were bad replaced.

What they can do is have the notification be hidden if you squelch your opponent. Also it be a toggleable thing that you only see if you're in the options menu.
---
Like instead of "Concede" its "accept draw"
---
Is this sarcasm?
---
XDDD
---
Because Boom has never been a mech. You should be asking why Mecha Jaraxxus can't be killed by EMP Operative.
---
Keep trying! Good conversation!
---
Coldlight Oracle to top deck lethal? I mean, he has the Ice Block, so there's not much that can go wrong.
---
After two years of games being ruined by how overpowered the various death knight cards were... I'm content with just asking "why did frost lich Jaina give lifesteal to anything at all?".
---
Along with "why didn't they just nerf rexxar by making lifesteal beasts not appear in his pool of beast parts" and "wtf were they thinking by making these cards so powerful anyways"
---
I thought it was midrange hunter for some reason and also in worst case scenario...I had an execute in the hand, also malygos so early with no direct damage spells shouldn't be such a big deal but unfortunatelly he had many of them in early hand
---
Are you playing as Medivh? Cause that boosts the ability of ravens to show up significantly.
---
There were no 3 mana 3/4s in classic, spider tank was the first one
---
This is a deck of all 3 mana 3/4s
---
A huge amount of the player base seems to be playing a very small number of different decks.  I think it's the new auto-complete feature, it's seriously hurting the deck variety on the ladder.
---
It could scale up with the number of turn spent in the game you won. That would be a better measure.
---
Otherwise, they could just ditch the idea of rewarding the first 30 wins, and replace that with a more reasonable mechanics that do not favor bot playing aggro deck.
---
Do effects on Heroes stick around after you switch heroes? Like do you keep lifesteal if you switch from Jaina? Do your mech still get Rush if you switch from Boom?
---
True, but I'd say that's not as much of a factor with Archivist now, since you can get to the turn cap fairly easily anyway.
---
And a Bloodfen Raptor one
---
INDIE COMPANY can do better then this shity Brazzers
---
Rip-off rain of toads
---
This can still be explained. If you look closer at the lore, (if I remembered correct) Thermaplugg is crippled, and is seen riding on his mech wherever he went, so basically at this point his mortal body is kind of meshed together with his mech, which is essentially a part of his entire identity now
---
Swampqueen Hagatha doesn't count how many times you've played her. Rather, her voice lines are dependent on your hero and the opponent's hero:
---
**Normal Summon**

Yes, but technically he is his own sword still, regardless of what swords he thinks you want to see.
---
During the brawl where you start as a DK, pretty sure your elementals had lifesteal even though she wasn't played. Oddly enough, if you played as Uther, you got this weapon but if you played as Jaina you didn't get the water elemental.
---
Hunter is getting close to a deck full of 1 mana 1/1 beasts
---
Now I just need the original OG, a Chillwind Yeti deck
---
The real reason is because Jaraxxus is a minion card, not a hero card.
---
Because it‚Äôs a spell and not a battle cry minion
---
If you are absolutely sure you don't want to play wild then yes. Personally I enjoy wild and standard so I don't really dust anything, but for an exclusively standard player who doesn't want to spend more money to get all the new cards I'd say it's the right call.
---
Meh. It's up to you. I played from beta but stopped after the 2nd expansion. Came back about a year ago.
---
When I came back I dusted all my old useless shit and made some new decks and had fun.
---
But now that my collection has caught up for a whole year I kind of wanna play wild. But I dusted a lot of staple cards.
---
You do you man. Just my story. Your mileage may vary.
---
My middle ground is I only play 1 class per set really, but I have an alt account that I‚Äôll run a separate class on so I get to experience 2 classes (and also crafted a golden Whizbang for when I‚Äôm really bored)
---
It is not just infinite value. It gives mechs fucking rush for no god damn raeson. So after surviving two brawls, two warpaths  , executes, omega devestators and so on, i still cant have a board due rush mechs. wtf is blizzard even thinking .
---
[[Piloted Shredder]] contains one too.
---
Glad that Resurrect Priest is still at least finding moderate success.
---
Except Omega Devastator as a card is named after the mech, not the goblin piloting it. Dr. Boom's card refers to the goblin, not his suit. It's like the difference between Han Solo and an X-Wing. Han Solo isn't a space ship. Dr. Boom isn't a mech. An X-Wing is a space ship. Omega Devastator is a mech.
---
We have tempo burgle rogue, togwaggle tempo rogue, togwaggle combo rogue, aggro lackey rogue, Tesspionage, and Nomi myracle.

Yeah, they did.

There was the DHM warrior, wich ran 2 copies and used it to infinitely shuffle cards into their deck, and then there was control warrior, wich ran an one-of of dead mans hand and used it to win control matchups.
---
My aggro shaman deck has been pretty good in the meta and it only runs 1 legendary (Electra) who isn‚Äôt necessary for the deck and can be replaced by another feral spirits. Pretty sure sea giants are also the only epics in the deck as well.

We just pack all six 0-cost spells. Amirite?

Then why is [[Dr. Boom, Mad Genius]] a battlecry for almost the exact same thing, but without the 'Summon and Elemental' part?
---
Spi-der Tank, Spi-der Tank ...
---
Right, that's exactly my point. Everything about the card refers to the mech itself except the voice lines. This is an oversight in my mind opinion. I don't think it makes the card bad nor am I confused about why this is a mech. This just stands out to me as a misstep of polish.

This just happened to me a couple hours ago

---
So, what the cards have in common is that you only start with two copies in your deck and your win condition is find ways  to shuffle and play more, trying to overwhelm your opponent with big bodies.
---
One of the builds was consistently top tier to the point they had to create a neutral card in order to shut down the main power of the archetype. Meanwhile the other just barely saw niche play and was considered too slow to actually see any serious competitive play.
---
And funny to think about it, Jades were actually the top tier deck. Turns out druid is the only class with ramp and being able to accelerate to later turns is pretty good especially when you want to powerdraw via Auctioneer and cheap spells like [[Innvervate]]. Once you got to the cap of ten mana, you were in a winning position solely by playing Fandral and two or three Jade Idols. Due to the Fandral effect, every Jade Idol creates a Jade on the board and adds three extra Jade Idols to put in your (ideally) empty deck. Pogos grow slightly faster but they are twice as expensive as Idols and they don't have an "I win" combo of filling both your board and Library at the same time. In fact, the most powerful combo you can do with Pogos is Tak (7) + Pogo Hopper (2) + Togwaggle's Scheme (1). That's ten mana solely to put a single Pogo in play while filling both your hand and library with extra Pogos. With the same mana, Druid could fill the board with Jades and every following turn play a larger and larger green men ad infinitum from the top of their deck. Also, the cap on stats is not a problem because having a 9/9 and 10/10 is good enough already. I don't think ever in competitive play Jades were any close to reach the 30/30 cap. 15/15 tops and that was probably overkill in an already winning position.
---
Except that's not really relevant. That's like saying an F-16 is actually a person in a jet. The mech cards you're are named after the mechs, not the pilots. Dr. Boom refers to the pilot, not the mech.

I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.
---
Why should the voice lines refer to the mech? That doesn't make sense. In Starcraft, your mech units have voice lines of the pilots. The voice line doesn't necessarily imply anything about what the card refers to.
---
I like grave horrors more
---
I like playing aggro and mid range because I personally don't like being against the same people for half an hour and maybe win.
---
Which would be..  the pilot.
---
I know this a just a meme but, like many people have already pointed out, Dr. Boom has never been a mech in any of his incarnations. He is very clearly a goblin.
---
The real question is why does the Jaraxxus &amp; Sacrificial Pact interaction even exist? It defies all logic, and is just well... random. Like it was an inside joke of the devs. No other demon related card can interact with Jaraxxus. You can't target Demonfuse or Light's Champion on him, Malganis gives him no buff and the game clearly does not count him as minion either, since no other minion related effect works on him.
---
You know the moment they fix that, people will start crying about Blizzard nerfing Basic cards again, which I find somewhat amusing.
---
Main priest lol
---
ok add me I'm snowball#11381
---
Like others said boom isn't a mech, but it would be cool if EMP kicked you back to base warrior
---
I'm a little of a 'creep' like you also, I mainly play Rogue, there was a time when I DE all of Druid cards just so I have enough dust for a Rogue deck, I feel you at that part.
---
But, you should really keep the classic and the Legendary of recent expansions, to avoid re-opening them again, it will cost you more the way you instant dusted them. And should only DE them if you are really really reaaallyy in need of dust tho.
---
Good luck!

I guy made a post a while back saying he completed the collection ftp having played since launch so it‚Äôs not entirely impossible to need more deck slots and be ftp.
---
I don't play Starcraft but that seems like a false equivalence to me. Why should the way another game does stuff have baring on this?
---
Regardless if someone played this card and didn't realize this was a mech due to the fact that it doesn't have robot noises then I'd say that's a failure in the design. For example a newer player in Arena failing to EMP Operative this because the were convinced it is not a mech due to how it vocalizes. Not an overly likely situation but if this happens even once then it's a result of the design not doing its absolute best to communicate this.

And yet it is tagged as a Mech! Curious.
---
\[\[Dark Cultist\]\] - hope I did this right.
---
The card is Piloted Shredder, not Piloted Shredder pilot. As we all know, the Shredder can only be piloted by 2 drops, but it's unclear what 2 drop exactly is piloting the mech (it could even be another mech).

Yes indeed! I just enjoy reading other people's posts. This is the first time I actually put effort into posting something.
---
I don't get the reference but no. Haha
---
Either laugh at him or ignore him.  Nothing else to be concerned about.
---
I mean the deathrattle on shredder explains what's going on anyway: the card is the mech with a 2 drop inside of it.

&gt;*What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*

I stick to one or two classes till I get them golden. I think it is easier now since arena wins also count towards golden class.
---
Same on my 11 inch iPad Pro. What a bummer.
---
Yeah Shredder may have been too strong for the time it was legal but it's a hugely successful design. Very flavorful.
---
Except it's more like "the lemon you bought from the used car salesman" rain of toads.
---
That's really weird. I thought at least the interaction would be consistent.
---
I guess this makes sense bit still sucks lol
