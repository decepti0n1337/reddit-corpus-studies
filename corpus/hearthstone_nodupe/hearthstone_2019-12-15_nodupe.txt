Or maybe he did mulligan? Who says he didn’t? Crazy assumption about a game that literally has a knack of giving you a full hand of things you can’t summon until turn 4 maybe lmao
---
---
---
Is this OTK? That's only 10 damage...
---
I feel I'm the only person who actually enjoyed playing the game this week. Positive winrate against galakrond shaman with both waxadred rogue and galakrond warrior, both fun decks for me.
---
It's kind of funny that people can't seem to understand that different groups get enjoyment out of different things. MTG is very good at communicating this. They make cards for "Spikes" who mainly care about winning. Then they make big stuff for "Timmies" and wierd stuff for "Johnies". The community has gotten so used to this stuff, that netdecking is just assumed behaviour from the long time players.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
So Millhouse don't cause you to instantly lose? Also, who uses prep on 1 cost echo cards?
---
4 attack is a buff against priest too
---
Would a 7 mana 2/2 with those key words see play? Probably but I have no clue
---
 &gt;Might as well play Shaman.
---

---
Not really. I got to rank 5 with an even mix of galakrond warrior and waxadred rogue of all things. Then at rank 5 shaman is only like 20% of the meta.
---
Oh. True.
---
Cause that would make you spend less time/money to play
---
Power creep isn't when better versions of bad cards are made. It only becomes power creep when a card is stronger than any other card previously released. So basically, you should compare this to something like Dr. Boom rather than guardian.
---
There are people with millions of gold nowadays. There's an mount with an portable auctioneer that costs 5 million gold
---
The bug is the word Lackey staying on the screen.
---
Why is this that impressive?
---
I play odd rogue even without Patches (suboptimal but still work well).
---
Its a business model. A souless corporation only sees money spent &amp; play time, not player enjoyability or balanced gameplay.
---
If you want to measure your deck building skills don't play constructed in a popular game. Deck building is a small part of the game and some people enjoy refining their ability to pilot the best decks. If you want to measure deck building skills play with friends or play a deck building game.
---
Card tier aside, the animation is straight fire.
---
&gt; Yep, Mindflayer sounds good, is too slow
---
Is piloted shredder too slow nowadays?
---
Why?
---
Lol I tried to put it playful but it didn’t stop the downvotes
---
&gt;I'm not sure when was the last time Priest got a card they could simply play and potentially threaten opponent 
---
Point taken but priest is definitely the control archetype more than anything so having offensive card like that isn't its style. Combo priest aside, really good priest desks of the past are the best at board control and dragging you into the late game where they can play a bunch of huge minions. Death knight priest was really when it came out. Priest just hasn't kept pace with how aggro metas have become IMO. Which I think you are saying too.
---
Did you resolve the problem? I did. The thing was going to the blizzard case and delete the hearthstone one.
---
There is a good amount of RNG in Hearthstone - you just have to deal with it or quit. Also, the closest thing to rigging would be how Animal Companion seemingly summons the right one you need.
---
ftp btw
---
I'll look at it thanks !
---
Mogu is only a problem because it gets turned into an 8/9/10 cost card. The problem isn't that it's a 3/4 with rush.
---
&gt;why cant we just ban a class like they do in tournaments but in ladder? 
---
Team 5 could, but doing it would make ranked much more polarized.
---
You're new to Reddit aren't you?
---
Yes, I know but there these things called irony and exaggeration that are often used in a mocking,joking or condescending  manner. There are certain situations where not using the literal meaning is the point like g.e any time someone says they're freezing
---
“We don’t want a Vessina portrait”
---
“Okay maybe we can have her as a card”
---
Preparation was part of test. And yes, Millhouse is good for some friendly fun games, and nothing more. But I'm speaking not about how good/bad are some cards. I just don't like that now there are few cards, which wording isn't true for 100%
---
I think that's generally a wrong way to look at highlander decks. It's an easy trap to fall into; "Not all cards are auto-includes" doesn't mean "put in whatever you like", even though it's easy to think about it that way. 
---
Pressure plate for instance seems like a nice tech card against Dragon's Pack. In reality, it doesn't bring enough upsides; most decks right now are doing everything they can to have a token to land Faceless Corruptor on. Even the shamans you're trying to counter are doing the same. 
---
But that's not even the worst part: the worst part is that it doesn't tech with your strategy. The reason highlander hunter can do well is because of two strategies (depending on your draw as well as your opponent's plays):  
---
- Getting on the board and dealing chip damage. Power cards are there to finish the opponent off. Main power cards here are zephrys and brann. Honorable mention goes to dragonsbane.  
---
- Dealing with their stuff before they can capitalize. Power cards are for clears. Main power cards here are zephrys and veranus. Early on VIC (very important card) is desert spear, it's also great for veranus.  
---
Pressure plate doesn't fit well into either of these strategies; for the first, you're not looking for this type of removal. For the second, your opponent's board will be too cluttered too often.
---
&gt;There were even quest shaman lists last meta that ran mogu but no mutates.
---
If the choice is to either change a single card's text and changing the rules of Hearthstone, Team 5 is going to choose the former.
---
But cards never go below 0 either. Doesn't mean they're lying because the cards don't cost negative
---
[deleted]
---
which in past have already printed 3 way better versiosn off.
---
If you visit the link in question and press CTRL+L and CTRL+C you can come back here and press CTRL+V.
---
The curious thing is that the text hovered the minions, but not other effects, like battlecry vf or the like.
---
Because it piggybacked off Evolve and Desert Hare shenanigans.
---
if its buffs for classic/base set its more likly to happen during start of new year together with hof.
---
But i do hope buffs in general happen,and escpially to cards like shadowform which are interesting but have always just been so bad.
---
Did not know dragonbane was legendary.
---
It's Galakrond *and* all of the strong synergy stuff Shaman has (and the strong neutrals).
---
Not one thing, lots of things. They took a borderline Tier 1/2 deck and put almost all the best cards in the expansion in it.
---
I'm currently r23 legend on EU and although I don't have a huge sample size I'm on something like 7/9 wins with nomi priest.
---
Whispers of evil is just good IMO since the more 0 cost cards the better auctioneer turns you get. Grave runes and shadowy figure are 1 ofs and nomi is still included to beat pally, flik and zephrys. (all of which can deal with multiple grave horrors)
---
Lmao wooosh
---
I have another matrix meem video done, just waiting for approval from mods, probably will post tomorrow if they say yes.
---
if only u muted the audio or made it a gif so i didnt have to hear u breathing into ur mic
---
But it already has oveload
---
I agree with all of the above! Shaman def needs a buff! But now the battlecry might be a bit strong when combined with quest. What do you think about losing the battlecry, ^(and maybe changing art to Faceless holding some fire for a bit of fun? ftp btw)
---
Thats brilliant
---
atleast chronobreaker still at worst has positive effect being a dragon in hand for actual good dragon support.
---
Unlike purfiry where usally means making own minions worse
---
also how many revelers do i have to kill for the card back smh
---
Maybe it should also grant armor equal to the power of the destroyed weapon.
---
Firebat has one or two new videos almost every day on his channel
---
They really missed the mark with Priest this expansion... One of the most baffling example is Chronobreaker. In an expansion of OP cards, why the hell doesn't it have taunt?!? Even Chillmaw had taunt!! 
---
Priest just got okay cards while every other class got really powerful cards. And as much as I'd like them to buff some Priest cards, they'll probably just push some nerfs and see how it affects the meta...
---
Old Gods was peak hype for me and I remember record Twitch numbers, but I believe Knights was the best performing for Blizzard.
---
I have a feeling this expansion had a middling launch, I sure look forward to reading their quarterly report to find out.
---
I've been arguing about this for a whilr. Every timr I ask for thoughts on my overload agro shaman I always hear "why no mogu mutate?". Well fact is no matter how strong that might br I don't want to be that guy playing that bullshit high roll shit.
---
I don't think it will be this coming week. They said they'd announce the changes sometime this coming week. So depending on how fast they are, hopefully it will be done the following week. I'd like to see it come sometime this coming week, as I don't think people will want to play rank until the nerf patch.
---
Or if you could somehow get your hands on Auchenai Soulpriest that would be some fun.  Don't think this is possible in any way with paladin?
---
I highly recommend Lil Dicky(aka Firm Handshake, Mr. Leftward Sloping Penis, The Independent Variable)
---
Wb
---
I had no idea who Regis was til like 2 days ago when I found his stream. Dude is wholesome as fuck can't get enough of him
---
From my experience these different packages compliment themselves pretty nicely but Im at about 11 rank now, I have to play with it a little more and see if can get to at least rank 5, but I dont have too much time to play right now ;p
---
Poor ole priest, shafted again!
---
But then you can't get those sweet 12/12 Shudderwocks!
---
Isn’t this an adventure card.
---
Both card texts are wrong actually. It should read “Hero power: lose to shaman”
---
Bruh
---
Shudderwock wouldnt be Shudderwock with the understated ugly face of his
---
Yes we could. But we didn't. It wasn't even planned that we played today together
---
Seriously., he would still be really good at 4/3
---
In highlander decks....
---
This is the best thing I've seen all month lmao
---
Only time they really touched Wild quickly was with Aviana Druid.
---
Im pretty sure this card wont fit into gala shaman. Thats how broken that deck is atm
---
Im a new player who took this boards advice about Whizbang and I really advocate any new player looking to explore the meta to spend their hard earned early game dust on Whizbang. Ive also heard a few people saying that once familiar they were able to take it into higher tiers of ranked.
---
Isn’t that the guy who plays Doctor Strange?
---
Me too but im not having gteat succes against shaman exchange decklist
---
They should change this card to give you a Walking Fountain
---
I would love to see Brode as an alternative tavern keep.
---
Where else would it see play?
---
Why does a deck only really being playable for one format surprising (assuming that is what will happen to Highlander Hunter)?
---
dont have mechathun :(
---
I mean, you're right. But that didn't stop me going face hunter against a secret mage and wrecking his shit. Anecdotal evidence from me to be fair all the same.
---
He learned it by watching you!
---
NTA, ur sons a psychopath
---
Interesting you mentioning how "not bad" it is when drawn (the least important of the winrates) but how bad it was on mulligan winrate and played winrate. Anyway, this was true when I made my research and as of right now, the deck doesn't even show on played games so it has less than 490 games played and a 41% winrate today, as of a 34% winrate 2 days ago... it's flying under the radar because how variable it is and how much it sucks. But Good luck in casual.
---
Should be 7
---
I remember everybody crying about One Night In Kara for some strange reason.
---
BRM was an amazing era.
---
Or it was intentional...
---
That's what I used to do. Now that I have most what I need and I've been trying to accumulate useful golden leggies. 
---
For some reason it's more fun when everything shiny lol
---
Priest has pretty great draw. Shield and Northshire are some of the best draw cards in the entire game.
---
How long can this go on?
---
Yup
---
Sure, but other classes MUST spend cards to generate minions/value or heal. Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's OP or weak, this is a weird way to look at things.
---
Fatigue theif, weasel priest and 40hp Ragnaros aside, it is perhaps not the best backbone for late game combo decks. 
---
There's a lot more speed and power in something like a turbo draw Nomi Preist.
---
Not sure if it’s a joke but it’s a name not a word
---
Yes, sir. That's exactly what I'm saying.
---
Go get Arthas!!!!!!!!
---
“can pump out to many secrets to reliably and than finish it off with a bun dance of 6 damage to the face”
---
Jaina may do that to me any time she pleases, thank you.
---
But he didn’t destroy the Shirvallahs in my deck.
---
Glad I could help! ;)
---
and his hair! uh, that hair. Krip's weak hairline can't even compete!
---
I don’t think so. I play zoo Galakrond Warlock, and I don’t think I’ve had this problem
---
PC, Android, or iPhone?
---
If they can abuse powerful cards I can abuse the rope
---
No, playing against a roping Shaman is worst.
---
I just tested it and it did not work for me.
---
Are you sure he can still target? Or is it just a visual bug?
---
I’m just guessing but it looks like that person disagrees that amber watcher is a newer version of guardian
---
Who would win, 4 copies of a powerful dragon who is literally the bringer of life or one shabby boi?
---
Because I am never this lucky and always lose.
---
The vs data reaper reports from mid September till doom in the tomb. Its popularity was mostly relegated to legend. 
---
Also the meta was shifting around combo priest at the time with many shamans moving from quest to aggro. 
---
Anyways my point is that the extra arms nerf was very warranted and complaining about it is unreasonable
---
that's now how that works, noone likes douchebags
---
Hahahahaha
---
After so much shamanstone, please just nerf it. We need something different
---
It's not about beign liked, it's about winning
---
Eh, I kinda vaguely remember Shaman merely being decent in GnG era. Some good cards but most overload cards not being worth it. Was played because it had a goodish aggro deck that had a tad more sustain than Face Hunter. 
---
I think during TGT it was merely decent as well and saw middle of the road play? It had the one inspire card that was good and some support for the deck, didn't have the insane stuff from the next adventure yet.
---
And can hit your units.
---
But anyone who plays Shaman right now IS a d-bag.
---
who’s on the right?
---
This would have been a great card back in Un’Goro or at least in Uldum
---
REGIS GANG
---
Lizard Nerf the unleash the hounds combo a long time ago because it punished play minions and that's one of the cores of Hearthstone.  Mogu and mutate are pretty similar
---
Going 12-1 against Shaman with my Handlock deck I made, but fuck Hunters destroy me.
---
It's so bad
---
This thing used to cost 8 mana and is still unplayable lmao
---
Ya.... he got downvoted hard.....
---
8 mana feral spirits without overload and doesn't die to \[\[Black Knight\]\]. Seems OP
---
I agree it is unfun to play against.
---
Outjerked again.
---
For the record, I'm the guy in the art and I don't know why you're getting downvoted either. I am happy you shared it because you thought it was cool, regardless if you knew who I was or not.
---
I really don't like Flik...
---
I completely agree.
---
Thanks! I'm always aiming for legendary, but feel like a common most days. I'll take epic!
---
But you aren’t playing murlocs

&gt;According to a poll of that post most people want Captain Eudora, (the Rogue one) by 18.9%.
---
I bet that number would be even higher now considering what they did to Valeera in her 1k wins portrait...
---
No you didn't. 15 is a rank floor. You can't drop below it.
---
Well, Vorpal Dagger already exists, it is a 2 Mana 1/4 weapon from Dungeon Run with Poisonous and Mega-Windfury. But I like your idea much more!
---
Hope you don't mind I added both of you. Started not long ago and I still have 0 contact... but a "watch and learn" quest in the queue !
---
FYI alt+D does the same thing, and you can do that one with your right hand on your mouse
---
You made a wise choice, I've put out 34 videos in December so far. I would definitely drive you crazy (which is okay, not everybody has to line up with everybody). Check out my bro Dekkster for a bit more chill vibe!
---
But this nerfs evolve. Yeah that's a wild card but we want shaman to be better in general.
---
Reddit can be so toxic sometimes. Dude goes out of his way to share this nice art he found AND to engage with people in the comments. But let's roll out the downvote brigade because he needed clarification about a question
---
Your statements are incorrect on numerous levels
---
SN1P-SN4P is no longer able to infinitely combo magnetised mechs for an OTK, the deck is complete garbage and lacks a decent wincondition outside of Mecha'thun which other decks simply do better due to SN1P-SN4P being incredibly vulnerable to aggro without it's OTK potential. I have to assume you are either outright lying or going off completely redunant information from before the nerfs.
---
Big Priest is a highly mediocre deck that is wasting away at the bottom of the Wild Meta tier list, The deck gets absolutely annihilated by any meta viable Aggro and struggles immensely against any Control deck that has access to a transform or alternate win condition deck, it can even get stomped by any decent meme deck that has a reliable counter to it's greed. So Big Priest has an unfavorable winrate against nearly every deck in the wild meta currently, except memey midrange/control decks.
---
Shudderwock Shaman isn't a particularly strong deck in Wild, though it's still a viable deck choice. Numerous other Combo/Control decks generally outperform the deck and thus it only has a relatively minor impact on the meta. I have to assume you must have some particular dislike for the card to speak so negatively of it, as it's simply far from being a geniune issue in Wild.
---
Mech Hunter is a pretty good deck, but is generally middling tier  overall. As the deck is simply outdone by many of the other Aggro decks currently present in the meta, whilst also frequently struggling against Control decks due to relying heavily on RNG to sustain their pressure past the early game, especially damning considering that Mech Hunter's ability to pressure isn't exceptional. It's a Tier 2 deck at best, so I assume you're just sick of facing them so much because of how cheap it is.
---
Your statements about Secret Mage and Mech Paladin are admittedly more accurate than the ones I previously listed and I relate to many of them, but they are not completely uncounterable like SN1P-SN4P was. Mech Paladin in general struggles immensely against mass silence, transform effects and other cheap effective mass removal (Which is commonly seen in most Priest, Shaman, Druid decks) and can have difficulty in finishing off the game once the opponent stablises, Mech Paladin is generally popular due to having an extremely skewed match up spread similar to Big Priests, especially since one of these good matchups is against Secret Mage. Speaking of it, Secret Mage is a very strong deck that deserves a nerf, though it isn't on the level of something like Standard's Galakrond SHaman right now, as it does suffer from some bad matchups and decks are able to somewhat effectively tech against it.
---
Overall, I would say your statements were very hypobolic and not an accurate description of Wild right now, if anything it can be considered more balanced than Standard currently. You generally seem to have a biased view against many of the decks played in Wild and just the meta generally, whilst also not considering that many of the points you have made could also be applied to standard (Such as the one about people bringing powerful decks into casual to grind gold, thus ruining the fun for people who just want to meme)
---
Remember when we just typed “dragon” and put every single non-legendary result in, and then had to fill the rest out? I’m pretty sure there’s more than 30 usable dragons alone now. Exciting times for silly deck building!

---
Thats the objective. 😎
---
The fact that the invoke gives a 2/1 rush is what breaks Galakrond. His invoke ensures you live until you can play Galakrond.   
---
 Since the invoke is still a part of Galakrond, the tempest, then Galakrond is in fact the problem
---
And he has probably the best editor in HS making them too.
---
Dust for shaman cards.
---
The AI thinks it’s playing the card with Battlecry on these summon discovers.
---
To be fair to WoTC MTG is about a million times more complex a game than hearthstone.
---
Ah, I've been collecting for rogue but not enough for any decks yet. Heard you guys have been having fun out there lately
---
There are always extremely strong decks. Shaman is currently at 56% on hsreplay, with #2 at 51%. That is a problem. But the whole last expansion had 2-3 classes teetering between 51-53%, with the other 6 below 50%. That was and is considered balanced. Shaman only needs to have it's win percentage dropped 3% to balance the meta. You can do that with a card or two. No need to Nerf the entire class set.
---
Nah I think he has just the 1. He's actually using the quest as an excuse to play shaman
---
Yes, but I was talking about what is, not what should be. If the aura effect came from the card it would be silenceable
---
Hail Hydra.
---
code here: https://gist.github.com/bramses/7f528337ee8795b5764654443d5d8120
---
Careful showing off your intelligence around these parts, buddy.
---
Not really. They want to rank up. People intentionally wasting opponents time is way worse
---
😯
---
I'm here to report it's actually a lot worse than Galakrond Shaman.
---
Interesting. Do you think it can be corrected as it is now? A few years gone by and I'd like to give it a bit of a retouch.
---
It should only give +2/+2 instead of 3 on my opinion. 5/6 is just too strong on turn 4/5
---
Might be just a little bit broken... 
---
There's only complains about shaman in the subreddit right now but I think this will dominate if only shaman gets nerfed. That's if it isn't dominating now, considering I just reached legend 11-3 against shaman since turning on decktracker (18-5 total recorded).

If you’re interested, here’s a Quest/Highlander Priest deck I used to reach Legend this month. Not to sound full of shit, but I even dare say that is was relatively easy. At least once I figured out the right configuration for going against Shaman. I went through a few different alterations. This current list seems to be the most competent. 
---
As soon as people realize they should stop trying to make Galakrond Priest work (any Priest deck with Galakrond is already a failed deck), the overall winrates for the class will begin to elevate a bit. Also, Combo Priest is still a perfectly fine choice for Standard ladder.

---
i dont remember but I've opened about another 7 or 8 and still no more
---
*They're* saying that because there was no way to beat the 8/8, they realised their best move was to uninstall the game. 
---
This is comedic because it's not normally thought of as a move you can make.
---
I just went 4-2 with against shaman. Quest rogue. 13-4 from 5 0* to 4 4*
---
Yeah I forgot it was that long ago
---
Damn!
---
Interesting iv always wanted bwonsamdi to be viable but I hadn’t thought of him in with albatross, are you running double spirits to get the extra one copies of albatross and basically just going for flooding their deck with a crazy amount of 1/1’s?
---
I don't get the tavern brawl. I got to 105 and conceded but I didn't get anything
---
I don't know why people are so toxic. Thanks for supporting the game for the rest of us!
---
Face is the place for the hunter and pirate folks!
---
*Sad evolve shaman noises
---
I saw this on release day. It looked like it was just your problem.
---
Let me guess : he can't :/ how sad
---
Yeah, they should give less free stuff.
---
Okay
---
My favorite meta (probably not popular choice) was Odd Pally, Odd Rouge, Odd Warrior, even Shaman, gallery Priest, Mecha'Thun Priest, Tog/Mecha'Thun druid, Zoolock, Cubelock. Every class had a competitive deck. You could pick whatever you wanted and have a chance. Meta was so open. So much fun. 
---
I believe this was result of Boomsday expansion
---
Please Blizzard fix it
---
Getting 400 dust alone from disenchanting one of these Galakrond won’t help you make budget decks. 
---
Also considering the fact that most invoke cards are super easy to get, Galakrond decks (especially the warlock) are the cheapest out there. Dragon decks are super expensive. Highlander decks are super expensive. Control decks are super expensive and require multiple legendaries. 
---
If it weren’t for the Galakrond decks I would be on a pickle in this expansion as dragon decks require multiple dragon legendaries over several expansions.
---
If you already played a minion this game give it Taunt, Magnetic, Rush and Cant get hit by spells or hero powers
---
Now u can steal his frostmourne ... Then he cant play minions but he will be imune and then u play mechacthun
---
I really really really enjoyed the heist one so I have to disagree but the dragon one was indeed splendid too.
---
Damn, this sub is... not what I expected. Don't go there, folks.
---
You never have a sweaty ass and need some ventilation?
---
YTA. Abort him immediately.
---
Amazing amazing pack opening.
---
It is very frustrating to restart Hearthstone and wait 5 minutes to get back in
---
DH Warlock
---
Feel u man
---
when you play as lei shen and use thunder spells he sometimes says stuff like "lightning!"
---
Exactly, even two 5/4 rush guys cant deal with them and they are considered op
---
Yes, you're right. It just my ass hurt
---
most classes: steal weapon with kobold stickyfinger, he can't play cards anymore, clear the rest of his goons and win via mechathun+doomsayer.
---
hunter: vicious fledgling+beast synergy.
---
mage: kabal lackey+ mana bind, platebreaker+ping on turn 7 to otk.
---
Same. I love Kingsbane so much that I still haven’t dusted it. Raiding party should’ve been the only nerf, the prep nerf almost made me rage quit the game. It felt so unwarranted
---
hell no. Those hero powers arent balanced for normal way at all.
---
If you’re good and experienced at arena then Arena is the best for you. In order to get packs from arena at a reliable rate, you need to break even (meaning that you earn greater than or equal the amount of gold from arena rewards compared to the standard amount of 150g you pay for an arena entrance). 
---
To break even you usually need 7 wins. Getting 7 wins is not an easy fate, especially for a new player. Also factor in the fact that the arena expansions set I believe rotates twice within the span of 4 months so you need to remember how a lot of the cards function and when they are useful.
---
It's your son, so i bet you were a razakus Priest player back in the days
---
Nice 13 turn setup
---
So you think the tier 1 deck combo priest that dominated the ladder at legend should have also had 2 mana extra arms as well? That's your idea of good game design? Refusing to nerf something obviously overpowered because you feel bad for the class it's in?
---
Yes, that is legitimately the only explanation possible. It's unthinkable that Blizzard *chose* to make cards with clearly busted power levels and were cognisant of it prior to the release of the expansion.
---
Idk what's your problem with a minion that takes half the turn to be played, but you can totally queue like 3+ so 15 minutes after your opponent's turn ended you're still watching his battlecries
---
It's also worth noting that all of Lewis Carroll's work is public domain
---
The problem Is that this isn't even the real Power play of the deck lol
---
Mutate
---
Give your charge minions +1 attack
---
Now laugh
---
That would be a pretty cool card with some tweeking. Shudder has to die for these kinds of battlecries.

Commas man. Good lord that was hard to read
---
Everything that isnt paladin or priest, cause i'm not willing to touch anything impure
---
I did that on turn 3 with coin. I felt bad for my opponent and stopped playing shaman right after. I only played it a couple of games coz i got so tired of facing it constantly at rank 5. Went back to Highlander mage after that. Might not be as consistent, but it’s great fun to play.
---
Only one? It has to be at least 2 to encourage value decks..

This is more important to me than the upcoming nerfs.

fuck blizzard
---
Someone in twitch chat thought i was serious so better play it safe i guess
---
It doesn’t change anything. See Shirvala.
---
It does this about 10% of the time in my experience.
---
They do have some good tools.  With Shaman so prevalent why are Priest not more popular?  Instead they reside near the bottom of players classes.
---
This card won't be playable if this happens to it because Shaman doesn't let people play the game.
---
Insane, let me just run quest and a random 3/2 to mess with- oh wait its shaman and i already lost.

3/3/2 | Doesn't lose Durability while you control a Dragon.

There's nothing wrong with one card being stronger than another in a vacuum
---
Only 5? Make Shaman playable, man..
---
Ye we got the joke
---
How could I be virtue signaling and attention mongering when you were the one who came and necro’d this thread? I haven’t posted about this issue since it initially broke. 
---
The short version is that supporting a company who suppresses dissent over China issues for corporate greed is supporting Chinese western leash holding. If you don’t agree that’s fine. Feel free to continue playing. But you’re the one who is selfishly attention seeking but coming here and trying to start shit on an old thread. I’m content to let others do as they please, and if they happen to disagree with me that’s fine, but personally I try to avoid Chinese products where possible and certainly avoid companies that cowtow to China over speech issues. 
---
That’s all I have to say on the subject.
---
pogies
---
Imagine the most powerful dragon playing a board game
---
Auto include
---
sucks when u dont get what u need though
---
"Oh boy, shudder murloc build, here we come! Upgrade turn 2....turn 3 get a nice murlock hero power win board..." "here, i found these 4 2 stars for you, you must appreciate that!"
---
I was playing Embiggen Dragons when I pulled it off. Both Embiggens were bottom 6 cards, but my dragons were cheaper...
---
I hate to say it but the meta right now is battlecry galakrond shaman it’s just that everyoneeeeee is playing it, so the shaman quest, the invoke cards, and battlecrys will be the core.
---
I’d wait to build a deck until after the announced nerfs occur.  If they have the desired effect the meta will shake up, if they don’t then shaman is going to be the top deck until new nerfs or the next expansion.
---
wow this is amazingly good, nice work! :)
---
&gt; 7 gold and the first 10 gold turn
---
So you don’t level up to tier 3 on 7 gold? What the f?
---
4 8-8s with rush is still a better outcome
---
Yea but if you quest hero power, it becomes a 32/32, or not it’s still 16/16
---
Nice
---
The buff they get it's an aura effect from the weapon or something else, no their battlecries. You can notice it if they get duplicated, if played from hand the buff is doubled.
---
I had success with galakrond zoo warlock. It's very fast agressive deck, bu then again I'm only around rank 10
---
Yes, add 1 elven archer and 1 subdue, should be decent enough replacements :)
---
Yes. It is rather difficult, but the difficulty comes in when deciding *which, what, and how* to change cards, not actually implementing them. Card game design and balancing is like building a house of cards. One mistake and the whole thing comes tumbling down, and design mishaps aren't unique to Hearthstone. MtG just saw two cards that were released in October banned in Standard about six weeks later.
---
Granted, patch launch procedures within Blizzard as a company probably don't help either.
---
Not really, the balance is super shit right now and counter decks are expensive.
---
They're just really close to the camera.
---
Once the elemental starts growing, they only look like they're the same size because the camera is running like hell away from them.
---
If opportunity presents itself for a good dance, then no. You shouldn't be using fixed curves on any hero, but for Deryl that's even more important, as he's a very opportunistic hero.
---
how do you do the combo with dealing 50 in one turn?
---
What shouldn't Whizbang do or be?
---
It's sad because i really like this game and it's going to die the instant the riot card game comes out due to how broken everything is if you spend money. Hearthstone has become p2w with this newest expac and the playerbase that doesn't want to spend $100 to counter a boring deck is going to get burnt out.
---
Yeah, I‘m also afraid of the rise of pirate warrior, when the new patch hits the live servers. 
---
I also feel like it’s the worst match up for this deck.
---
Im playing my deck without the barmaid and I also have no weapon removal in it. But ooze is obviously going to be an auto include.
---
Easy friend, not everything has to be competitive
---
Maybe fix the card text then?
---
Nani?
---
I still don't understand how this fix the problem of playing agaist the same deck 2/3 of the time you queue
---
Hilarious
---
my facing what
---
I think the average joe undersells how hard it is to balance a game with so many moving parts. The only failure is Priest. Everything else being within 5% of 50% winrate is industry standard, not a “shitty job.”
---
Honestly, I don’t think there’s a single perfectly balanced asymmetrical game, yet everyone acts like it’s easy as pie despite the fact that it’s never been done before.
---
Call me back when Mage or Druid are top tier without the need for 10 legendaries in your deck. Otherwise we're renaming it Shamanstone for the time being.
---
galakrond is free though
---
These will not solve anything.
---
AAECAZICHoSxA6f3AoyuA4oB6IkDxAafA/yjA7/yAt4Fh7ED1pkD9fwCiLADnvACQI0IvZkD7IkD9KIDxfMCoIAD/a0DhbEDoaEDX+iUA5etA4zvApGxAwAA
---
I normally wouldn’t run sandbinder, but the strength of zephrys into Galakrond is good enough to warrant it. I you still have consistency issues before turn 7 or 9, then drop the other 2 cost minions for some early spells and witchwood piper. If the game is going long, try to avoid playing your free dragons early and keep them for looping with Elise and brewmaster or banker; this requires good hand management and a lot of forward planning if you are going for this. MC tech is really good into Galakrond. You might wish to consider changing some cards for a ramp package to make zephrys into twisting nether more consistently on curve with Galakrond. There really shouldn’t be much of an issue out valuing Galakrond between Elise and alex.
---
I elected not to run the quest because the lack of consistency coupled with the loss in early tempo is too severe in my opinion.
---
As a side note, I have enjoyed rogue highlander as well (I’m free to play, so a lot of my decks have the same core cards). And it is likely the better standard deck due to spirit of the shark, shadowstep, and skyshiv (which is the single best answer to Galakrond).
---
In both cases, they can just play solitaire and you will loose; but that is rare.
---
Good luck.
---
I wasn't aware you could build a Gala deck with a single card, thanks for the update! My eyes are opened! \^/s

**Total Dust:** 15500
---
**Deck Code:** AAECAZICHoSxA6f3AoyuA4oB6IkDxAafA/yjA7/yAt4Fh7ED1pkD9fwCiLADnvACQI0IvZkD7IkD9KIDxfMCoIAD/a0DhbEDoaEDX+iUA5etA4zvApGxAwAA
---
Are this differences statistically significant?
---
Do the chickens have unusually sharp talons?
---
I would unironically run this card. It's like Yogg.
---
I just wanted to know if decks with a higher dust cost are actually better on ladder. And how much worse budget decks really are. I think it is interesting for newer players and casuals aswell because the best performing archetypes are getting more expensive every expansion.
---
Ok Boomer isn’t usually phrased as a question but thanks for playing.
---
That doesn't fix the deck it's still fucking busted. They still have mass board fill for zero mana Mogus, they still have the most busted invoke and invoke cards, they still have two 5 mana 5/6s with Taunt.
---
To actually balance the deck the 2/1s would have to lose Rush or become 1/1s, the 5 mana wolves would need to be 4/5s, the change you suggested would have to go through.
---
Were you not saving gold pre-expansion release so you could purchase packs with gold...?  I only started playing Hearthstone again (1.5 year break) after battlegrounds was released, and I didn't even complete my quests everyday but still managed to get 20 packs with gold.  Plenty of cards to make a decent budget Galakrond deck for each class, as long as you had somewhat of a collection beforehand.
---
Everyone F2P player with half a brain cell knows to start saving gold at least a month before a new expansion release.
---
I am curious if they returned raza to =0 how higher priest would be
---
Can't remeber anh spesific posts but there is this video: https://youtu.be/aFAnt2Tmo9U
---
Last clip
---
Hahaha saw this one today and was thinking about how inaccurate it is. Kudos to you for fixing it. XD
---
You can reach legend easily with a f2p account. In fact there was one player who made that point pretty effectively by creating a new account and reaching legend within 24 hours without paying a dime.
---
But to do that you have to, you know, learn how to play the game and maybe spend a little less time being a whiny ass on reddit and then complaining about mean replies.
---
If you are still reading, crafting Kronx will be a worthwhile investment and you can play galakrond zoolock for example just by using gala, kronx, the rare and common invoke cards and a few effective low cost cards (lackey sac + egg package comes to mind)
---
My fiancee has a f2p acc and that's what i crafted for her. She can play gala overload shaman, gala zoolock, gala tempowarrior, tempo rogue, combo priest.
---
Pretty vast assortement of decks for being free to play if you ask me.
---
I'm disgusted.
---
Combo priest is still pretty good no one is playing it for some reason (probably because it uses no new cards, MAYBE faceless)
---
It could be worse, he could be playing it in casuals.
---
I dont know tbh i just wanted to share the stats i got from this
---
They are weak on purpose, it should be hard to get them to full strength and sometimes you have to play them unupgraded...except Shaman can easily upgrade them with a SINGLE card if they already finished the quest (and two cards if they didn't)...and then they can double it too. It's just dumb. 
---
And then they also get the added battlecry benefit from every single minion every turn...minions that are strong by themselves already, and they get the quest by playing well-statted minions on curve,no sacrifices needed.
---
It's crazy to me how the shaman quest hasn't been touched yet, it would still be great if it only doubled *one* battlecry.
---
What's your list look like?
---
The mods have already removed a few posts about Shaman with hostile speech/curse words, but I get you. I imagine they don't mass delete them because it would only cause EVEN MORE uproar in the community. Lots of people are genuinely putt off by how hand holdy DoD is, and to silence them without hearing them out does seem pretty cold.
---
Or is it just fantasy?
---
Flik is a big part of the deck because it can be played early on that evoke twice card to slow down shaman’s build up- also can be played on the 8/8’s after he plays Galakrond. And I always save my shadow step for zephy or flik to deal with their crazy boards.
---
Very key card in this deck IMO
---
I don’t know if I would craft anything yet as the meta is still being established plus nerfs are coming next patch.
---
But if you have the dust... I think this is a really great card
---
Starts in your opening hand.
---
Kronx doesn't even feel like a good card in the deck, that's how broken the deck is. Against most non-Shamans I can just win without Galakrond, then in a mirror it becomes spicy.
---
I play with myself all the time.
---
well, considering that there are many counters to it now (on the top of my head, any early game tempo/aggro deck) i say meh.
---
It's not the same at all. If your opponent has a board or just threatening lethal, you have to take a big risk developing galakrond, because you can't swing the board instantly and everything you gain is 5 hp.
---
Priests just need some 'dentity (beyond dragging out the game)
---
It feels like they didn't even play test the deck at this point because if they did they would of realized how overpowered Shaman is.
---
I would say yes bacause if you have a 54% wr instead of a 51% WR you need on average only 192 games instead of 332 to reach legend from rank 5 with 0 stars. With a average game length of 6min that difference of 140 games saves you 14 hours of playtime.
---
Hah, glad I'm playing battlegrounds full time now, as a priest main I wouldn't be having fun it seems.
---
Honest truth it's lame, literally the oldest combo of the class that originally was a meme combo until rastakhan cames with big health minions, I don't know a priest main that enjoys this combo where the hardest math you have to do is 2 plus 2.
---
If your son played Shaman in casual, I’d tell you to drown his ass
---
ouch then.....
---
Thanks
---
Also the evolve lackey.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you lol.
---
[removed]
---
Everyone? Nope. You are underestimating how much people netdeck. Total 200,000 games on one deck is common.
---
Gl boi
---
Nice edit
---
Oger* 
---
UpGonks to the left
---
They're the same guy.
---
Should update to:
---
Murlocs are basically Exodia with extra steps
---
and Mechs are all-rounders that have a low but consistent power curve. 
---
The easy way to beat Murlocs is to understand that there are only 6 copies of Megasaur in the game, and Murlocs' backup would take way too long...Fighting a Murloc and see that the barkeep is offering you a Megasaur? take it...even if you don't have Murlocs...You may not be strengthening your team, but you're severely weakening every  Murloc build in play.
---
Good luck. Please let us know.
---
Lol gtfo with that bullshit??? 😂 Really what the hell are you talking about. Y'all have some selective memory that's for sure
---
WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Pirate Warrior for sure.
---
Terrible fix
---
Basically make it worse than many already existing cards
---
Sea Giant, in most cases, can be played with a discount the turn you draw him unlike Jumbo Imp, which you need to hold for a few turns in order for your demons to die; the in hand only discount makes him bad.
---
Floops winrate isn't even that great in that deck I linked you. Frizz is probably still decent. You have 9 dragons is the deck so i can't see it being a very bad option over Floop. 
---
Although, I would imagine flooping Ysera would be the dream combo. No pun intended.
---
This deserves a lot more attention than OP's post. Nicely done
---
Brewing storm vs 1 angry boi
---
[[Angry Chicken]]
---
For the people not noticing, look bottom left
---
Did you do it?
---
It all makes sense
---
&gt;Hah. A poultry man task.
---
I believe its battlecry limit is 20 battlecries.
---
You should look up a picture of the jabberwock as well if you want to see how close the inspiration is
---
No I didn't. I said there's an efficient path that you go down, and to break from that path you need to have a good reason to do so. If you're arguing that the hero power is good, then you need to tell me in which situation that it beats just going down the usual path. Which combination of minions need to show up where, in your opinion, it's not worth starring up and spending two whole extra gold on?
---
&gt; There's token minions which change things up because you can sell it buy minions early too. 
---
Yes, I mentioned this. But I don't see how that plays in to your hero power theory?
---
In what situation is the hero power good, and how often does that situation manifest?
---
I don't think Shudderwock is good, if you're saying it is, I assume you must have a reason why that is.
---
&gt; There's fun ways to win.
---
Which we're not talking about. We're talking about the tier list.
---
I'd be happier with Roach Boy.
---
You gain gold completing daily quests and you can buy packs for 100 gold

---
This is just after the last wing was released. What I had forgotten was that Secret Paladin and Mid-range Druid got super refined after this. However, Shaman remained Tier 2.
---
this. don't buff priest like before. make them balanced.
---
yep, it wasnt until flamewreathed released that shammy hit the big time. which was right after that in old gods
---
I've been having alot of luck with GalaPriest in standard. Pretty much just play control dragons, throw in the two new 3/3 and 8/8 legendaries and that 5/6 that plays a spell from your opponents hand. If shaman has a big board, play it and chances are you make them play their own hex, earth quake or hagathas scheme
---
Pirates.
---
Pirate package and a new busted weapon.
---
Highlander hunter has a pretty favorable matchup against them, it outtempos them early, and I hold veranus and/or zeph to undo their power turn.
---
It's literally the most balanced mode currently according to HS replay.
---
I’m speaking from a non-Shaman player’s point of view
---
This is so sad, let's nerf big priest again.
---
But Raza priest would be straight up garbage in wild... its not a cancer deck anymore at all.
---
It depends. Control warrior beats tempo rogue but probably loses to more value-based options (e. g. Highlander Rogue with Waxadred).
---
It should have 1 attack
---
 Not bad, but have you gotten Malygos, aspect of magic into upgraded flamestrike and Kalecgos that discovered card draw into dinotamer brann into lethal next turn?
---
you played Zephrys the Dragonqueen
---
All upgraded galakronds have the weapon it’d be dumb if only shaman didn’t have the it
---
The award giver retired.
---
Congrats!
---
Glacial shard is as big as mountain aswell is a 2/1,icewalker is huge and towers over trees its nearby its only a 1/3.. A baby dragon (whelp) is a 2/1 or 2/3 and a fat one is a 5/5.
---
Also Deathwing ,the darkness and ancient one are stronger then strongest old god (yshaarij). and blood of ancient one (a single blood druplle) is stronger then all the dragon aspects except deathwing.
---
Enough Hearthstone skill to get to ~500 Legend, but not enough computer skill to take a damn screenshot.
---
Hunter is good in arena? After 20 runs I only met 12 hunters and won all 12 games. I know its not stastically relevant but what makes hunter good this Arena rotation?
---
Pirate Warrior. A lot of the climb right now involves decks that dont have adequate healing outside of Zilliax, so it's been super easy to just gorilla face Haha.
---
If your goal is to make it into a slightly better Furbolg Mossbinder and thus unplayable, yes.
---
It's better to do this on an albatross as early as possible. That's 16 1/1 birds in your opponents deck, which I think is more impactful than using those cards for removal.
---
No, I'm pretty sure he's just as big as a house.
---
So you are saying that he only targets hero’s and weapons?
---
Alpha move
---
Go to twitch.tv and look for the videos. Tyler has a lot of games (now he got sick/or just preparing for the nerd and is playing something else).
---
Yeah, it's a law of the universe. Blizzard doesn't playtest properly..
---
it says over 5k mmr.
---
Given how much Overload Support has been made as of late, that could conceivably make it worse or at least a different flavor of bad since there'd be a way to enable Vessina, Likkim, and Cumulo-Maximus on demand without using any cards.
---
It was released in SoU, and people were complaining about it then too, especially while evolve was in standard
---
#Gottem
---
I just had a run as hunter, went 12-2 mostly thanks to [[Diving Gryphon]] (got x3 of them), 3 mana deal 4 damage to a minion and draw a card that's also a removal alongside [[Faceless Corruptor]], can be a pretty annoying.
---
Or they could just add the hall of fame symbol behind the text. That would be a good nerf.
---

5/5/4 | Rush. Battlecry: Transform one of your minions into a copy of this.  
---
Have you considered the fact that you just suck at the game?
---
4 mana seems super reasonable I like it
---
Consistently inconsistent
---
Lol this made my day. May i use some of your salt for my ham brine for the holidays?
---
Agreed. 
---
I flip between my opinion on Priest, probably more than any other class.
---
I despised early Priest that just stole copies of your stuff and used it against you. 
---
But then came Dragon and the early forms of Revive Priest and I really enjoyed playing as and against it. 
---
Ungoro was definitely a sweet spot, but then the death knight and Big Priest really made it lame again. It hasn’t caught a break since; the new Mindflayer legendary was my 10-pack pull so I’ve been trying to make decks work, but it’s a struggle at the moment.
---
Not really a great accomplishment with that deck but grats anyway
---
Whenever I get a shaman I just concede, saves me time and effort seeing the cards in the same order...i hope they nerf it into the ground.
---
Wow. Thanks. That’s a terrible idea. I’m a shaman player using a non galakrond highlander deck. Which means I have to be punished too? Cuz I’m shaman?
---
AYYYY! CONGRATS
---
Warrior tier 1 wild? Pirate?
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=bgh+hearthstone
---
This was also the case for hallows end
---
now you can begin in rank 50 and get rewards in the way to 25
---
Lmao yeah ive gotten another alex a disgusting amount of times. I feel quilty to even play it
---
no because those cards probably won't be hit; shoud have been clear and it was mostly targeted at galakrond. (played 7 of them in a row). Galakrond cards are probably the most likely to be nerfed :), pls don't be mad at me :).
---
You can cheese him by just playing control with your first heroes while using as many spells as possible and then oneshotting him with renos gatling wand + one or more Lei Flamepaws.
---
Can you not use the word broken, or at least look at the state of the game before you do
---
Blah blah blah. No one is under an obligation to care about your opinion. You have a right to one, but a refusal or inability to support it means you are just another Redditor who cares more about being heard than what they have to say.
---
People have been complaining about Fleshshaper since it has seen print. You're either lying or ignorant, so it really does come out as Blah when your best defence is just a silly falsehood. I mean, a top post is a joke about nerfing Mutate to 10 Mana, rofl. How hard are you trying to keep your opinion for the sake of being stubborn?
---
Have a good one, try not to be intimidated by the potential of a constructive discussion next time. If you are, then don't chime in with your opinion and start something you won't follow through on. That just wastes everyone's time. You can bitch on your own time.
---
I'm a "wanker" because you cant tell the difference between words? That's a new one.
---
Lolwut?! We all know Shaman is a problem right now but you actually think this card is the problem?! 😂😂😂
---
I don’t have Reno’s Gatling wand, I need to kill a shit ton amount of plague to have it :( In normal mode I used only 1 hero but in heroic omg...
---
Highlander Bandersmosh Shaman is super fun. I felt scummy playing Galakrond Shaman but the Bandersmosh one is super fun. It still runs Galakrond but it’s not like you are versing bots. It’s a legitimate challenge and fun to play!
---
Cringe
---
With bog slosher I don't even mind hitting hir'eeks.
---
Murlocs are OP because Divine Shield + Poisonous is available for an entire board.
---
Imagine having Nefarian with a full board of Divine Shield + Poisonous murlocs.  There really isn't a winning response except omega highroll on multiple cleaves or hyper omega highroll on cobalt guardians.
---
Let’s be real, tons of us are playing it. I am. I’m scummy for it, but I do enjoy it.
---
Nope. Not seeing how Dragon’s Pack, Faceless Corruptor and that card invoking twice are utterly broken just shows no playtesting was done whatsoever. 
---
Reacting quickly is the bare minimum after what is probably one of the worst balance fuckup in the ranked history of the game. Undertaker hunter did not feel as oppressive as this does, and that means something.
---
I mean the stuff it is intended for really isnt of any use for anyone. Sathrovarr never makes it into any deck, Zayle is used by no one, Cthun had his time in the sun but is never used anymore, Marin was never really used, and at least 2/5 Galakronds are never going to see play (Warlock and Priest). The players themselves should be able to decide if  it is useful or not to them. I just dont see the point of having some random legendaries that basically are the same as basic neutrals like yeti or stonetusk boar since im never gonna use them.
---
I'm playing it right now too. I'd feel worse about doing so if they hadn't already announced that there were nerfs coming soon, and I'm sure the novelty wears off, but having one week of using something so stupidly broken feels good.
---
And look the Mad dog who lost against a BMer is currently malding again.
---
"Just retarded" enjoying games your way having conversation in it is a bad thing for you looks like and i just gave literally one example out of many And CSGO esports players are probably more adult than you and they still do that for fun. And congrats you played sports in real life if you think Messi and Ronaldo respect each other XD. 
---
and about "kids behavior to BM" since you didn't like Ksi vs Logan example here another one.
---
Even adults BM literally even a CEO of a company does that to its competitors ( CEO of AMD after showing vide of Ryzen vs Intel ) "Looks like my little friend still not done" after intel being 10 sec late.
---
And tbh congrats for you if you think adults should just stay silent the whole game and just win and lose without having emotion like robots rather let ai play.

-&gt; Hi team , Yes Go B , Ok GG ( not fun ) 
---
,
---
-&gt; Hi nubs , XD get gud , just Surrender or afk xd ( fun )
---
Noooo Omnistone! Really hope it will continue in some capacity. One of the best HS podcasts up there with Angry Chicken.
---
The escalation in this game has gotten a bit out of hand.
---
Nobody's playing it.
---
There are probably other good decks for underplayed classes that just haven't been found yet because Shaman is stomping over everything in the meta.
---
Tbh I think they should either remove the poisonous adaptation from the pool or replace Gentle Megasaur all together
---
In my defence I did try out Pure paladin and some other budget decks, but I had enough money for one more deck, so why not go for the best deck?
---
I do kinda feel guilty cause holy shit did I hate jade golem druid and it's players back in the day
---
How are you able to do the Lich king adventure? I can't find it
---
The state of the game has actually made me consider quitting forever and selling my account. Any way I can get away with that?
---
Yeah, this is by far the funnest priest to play, up there with thought steal decks. I just feel this is more consistent than those. 
---
Also I tried going all in on bad luck, but I found the deck as a whole more reliable with the inclusion of: Dread Raven, Infiltrator, Zerek, and Leeroy. Having a board of 3-4 of any of these really sets you up. 
---
I’ve actually won quite a number of games just because i’ve gotten grave rune off on any of those 4. Getting it off on albatross doesn’t necessarily get you the win.
---
What is wrong with small an interaction with you opponent and why are you so upset about this in a multiplayer game.
---
I don't think small hello/thanks is a bm as long as they are not spamming.
---
I always say **well played** if I'm in a losing position and give the turn to my opponent its not a big deal. They may have an amazing lethal with crazy combo I may also want to see, we both have fun. Don't be salty about small things mate grow up.
---
I’ve been playing this for a few days, and I’d probably say spilt them and try for grave rune on infiltrator and reborn on the albatross. Going all in either way doesn’t usually work too well.
---
One of the worst decisions ever made by the Hearthstone design team and it seems their main motivation was just to remove a great basic set win condition for the class.
