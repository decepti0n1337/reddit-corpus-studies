Very similar to zereks cloning master, and that card didn‚Äôt see play. I like this stat line and cost better but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs amazing

April fools?

Rogue gonna be tier 0 in wild now. 
---
no one cares about wild
---
&gt; draw a card
---

---
It is not "draw a card". Draw a card would mean you could get a number of answers - that's not the case
---
You don't need villain for that combo.
---
&gt; Also, also - how long do you guys think it will be before they put Alex and Maly in wild?
---
The general consensus I've heard is that when the next rotation arrives, Maly will probably rotate (probably accompanied by Alex and any other troublesome Dragon Legendaries; that will be the end of the 'Year of the Dragon'.
---
you hover over the card and the game literally tells you what it does
---
we need to stop treating new players like toddlers
---
So true. Hunter got shafted 
---
Or,
---
1. Play Electra
---
2. Play Eureka to summon 2x Blood of the Ancient One
---
3. End turn
---
4. ???
---
5. Craft a Golden Gruul
---
Dude I swear they change these cards after I read them or I have word dyslexia or something.
---
Not when it runs into a Barnes and 1/1 Obsidian Statue by Big Priest, or 8/8 Giants from Even Warlock or Barnes to Yshaarj to  10/10 Yshaarj in Master Call Hunter, gets Devolved by Even Shaman, Sapped by Rogues.  
---
It requires 2 cards and 6 Mana compared to the above being only 1 and 4 Mana.
---
None of those are crappy cards
---
You‚Äôre right!  So it would.. multiply?! Undertaker hydra?
---
Cleave, trampling, piercing, cleaving, etc
---
My favorite card already
---
How does that work? 0+5 or just 0?

Absolutely broken, too op

I still don't know how tunnel trogg escaped getting nerfed. Most broken card ever printed in HS in my opinion.
---
Remember when this battlecry was legendary worthy?
---
Everyone in this thread saying "worse Flamewanker" over and over don't understand how powerful guaranteeing to hit minions is. It's why Dynomatic is nutty. 
---
Not to mention these cards have quite different uses. I'm not certain what the list will look like that this finds itself in. But it will find its place somewhere. 
---
It's something I often forget too. I've watched many streamers get lethal or push big damage by silencing frozen dudes and I still often forget

Frost wolf commanders big sister
---
He isn‚Äôt kidding? There is a trump streamer and he has good tutorials (albeit outdated? But basics and principles are still somewhat applicable) also, firebat is an enjoyable streamer and has one of the best editors in yt.
---
Also for packs, wait until the rotation (some of the cards will be unplayable in standard) and if you want to play competitively i‚Äôd say wait for a couple of weeks before crafting cards (unless you want to try them out and just have fun)

One less sap for my other big cards.
---
For every counterfactual, there is a counterplay. My combo is still awesome. :)
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not that intuitive to figure out tbh I always forget 
---
I don't have Shirvallah so never played it. I've only ever seen it a handful of times, and they've always been combo decks (Shirvallah -&gt; Baleful Banker -&gt; Holy Wrath or similar). Maybe that's unusual, but it's not exactly a common matchup. Virtually all Paladins in Wild are Odd, Anyfin or Secret.
---
I never standard anymore though, so based on your comment maybe it's common in control decks there?
---
Wisps of the Old Gods had options, this doesn't
---
Nah it's definitely closer to 3 when you look at cards like [[Scarlet Crusader]], [[Crackling Razormaw]], [[Silvermoon Guardian]], etc. This technically makes smaller minions like [[Argent Squire]] overstatted but that's cause they're generally played early where divine shield is less useful

Would like to hear your reasoning for Faceless Rager and Soldier of Fortune. Other than that, I don't know why you have zero spell damage AND playing Unexpected Results...
---
Dont really even need the second coldblood tbh
---
good movie. turned out better than Us, however i wasn't disappointed in the film overall. 
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt see the cards released today lol
---
Odd mage?
---
Technically no but you're just being pedantic, it still feels very similar to an OTK. Honestly, it usually feels worse to get hit with divine spirit inner fire for the loss than most OTKs because it can come out sooner if they get really lucky
---
A lot of those cards you mentioned are rotating.
---
Im pretty sure that Wild exists so that blizzard doesnt have to worry about rediculous synergies in standard when balancing. Otherwise we wouldn't have rotations at all. Doubt they care much since its effectively a banlist disguised as a gamemode.
---
Should I disenchant cards rotating out from Year of the Mammoth now so I can get enough dust for these gold cards?
---
Battlecry: Set your opponents Weapon to 1 attack?
---
This one's art is cooler and they needed to fill one more epic slot. 
---
Yeah, but it cheapens the Witchwood mechanic if they can just make cards at any time that do the same thing, but don't use the keyword.
---
It would be like if one expansion they made minions that your opponent had to attack or they couldn't attack anything else, only instead of calling it "taunt", they called it "defender", just for this one expansion.  Wow, new keyword, "defender"! Much hype!
---
Already angry because I know I‚Äôll get 5 of these within my first 15 packs.
---
Now this is the kind of card that may be worth trying to get off eureka
---
In review: you‚Äôll be approximately 50% happy
---
His favorite book? Storm of swords 
---
I can't wait to see this guys golden art.
---
That's pretty arbitrary.

Maybe Nefarian to Paladins so those Dragon synergy cards get some use?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I really hope we get to see all villains this year, like Kel'thuzad.
---
might as well tho. 
---
14 Mana 3 cards clear your opponents board only if only one minion has less than 5 attack and it doesn't have taunt is downright ass actually
---
I am glad to see them use this keyword for a second time. 
---
Reddit: Super powerful decks that control the meta are not fun and interactive
---
Also reddit: Why didn't they give this deck cards that would have made it super powerful and meta controlling
---
I give it 5 stars. Hellfire is already a good card. This adds a 3/7 taunt for 3 mana on top of that 
---
We still have quartz elemental
---
I just gotta say I love the thematic part of all this stuff. Mages, defend dalaran! Summon the statues to fight!! 
---
Haha yup you're totally right on that one lol
---
Yes, we do.
---
Depends on order of play
---
Millhouse first: your opponent's spells cost 5
---
Loatheb first: your opponent's spells cost 0
---
Because all they do is netdeck, They have no imagination. This is the perfect candidate that may be cheated out
---
Everyone knows that the Lady in White is always one of the last five cards in your deck.
---
Odd pally
---
Azerite elementals exist in WoW. Though in the game they're not as yellow as this artwork. 
---
You forgetting all the cards they're printing that utterly fuck resurrect or...?
---
She doesn't look like a pirate. Edwin Van Cleef looks more like a pirate but he's also not a pirate. Don't judge cards by their looks.
---
ITT: People who overrate the power level of playing secrets turn 1. I personally think this will see play in secret pally but won't be OP at all, as pally would almost always rather play a 1-drop so this isn't as insane on-curve as it looks.
---
Even with all the nerfs?  And board clears on curve?  I‚Äôm a rank 22 player so I don‚Äôt know crap about the game.  Could someone explain to an idiot like me why this would be op?
---
Turn two evocation sof(most underrated card in the set) turn 3 faceless that's two 5/6s. Mana reservoir and azerite elemental both have spell damage.
---
Yeah I honestly don‚Äôt understand how they can hype something up like this so much and then just never talk about it? I mean unless this was for the legendary that they‚Äôre giving out to everyone, but they never once mentioned this video in the IGN article.
---
Ya. Lol. Like 3 or 4 cards just definited a possible meta outta nowhere.
---
That's literally not the only reason for keywords to exist in Hearthstone.
---
They exist, much for the same reason as they do in other card games, to reduce overall complexity as well. Typically, when you apply short hand to the name of something, it's meant to shorten it and/or group it with similar things that you'll be dealing with or referring to often. But if you apply sort hand to something you almost never deal with or refer to, the short hand becomes an added barrier.
---
It doesn't matter that you can click on the card and see what the keyword means. Mechanics aren't keyworded just to reduce text, they're keyworded to group similar cards together to reduce overall complexity. There are no similar cards in this set to Witch's Brew. Next year, there more than likely won't be similar cards in all of Standard. At that point, keywording this only *adds* complexity where there's no need. There's plenty of space on the card and the effect is pretty easy to understand. Nothing is gained from keywording it.
---
Fill your opponent hand wtih coins and then play two of those both players draw two cards from mage
---
I see most are thinking wild with this, but come on,  where's my Standard players at? :) Wild can't have all the fishy fun.
---
Not just kill some stuff. If your opponent has 3 minions with a combined attack of 9 or less this will straight up win you the game. And that's a pretty legit scenario, token decks will have to see Linecracker as a taunt against Shamans.
---
Not really. Its just save till next expansion and buy a bunch of packs so you can sort of keep up with  everyone else. The game gives you enough coins through quests and stuff to where you can get enough packs to make a good deck with the extra essence you get with the cards. Theres a video on it on youtube. 
---
Until now, finding a way to use the card was a problem. 
---
Heh. Problem solved.
---
I don‚Äôt got a deck but I plan on making some sort of token Druid with heals
---
It seems to me the distinction between  being able to clear 3 health and 4 is pretty big?  
---
Not a lot of 3 health minions late, most will be 4+.   Idk, it just seems like that 1 extra damage on the aoe is kind of an important damage. 
---
I'm more inclined tho try it with shooting star though.   
---
Buddy hate to tell you but millennials are look old now. I own a car and a house and have a job and please help me
---
Combos nicely into the new rager
---
There is also Tanglefur mystic and that one Drakkari card.
---
Not quite the same since Shambler has taunt and copies both stats, but it definitely can be a solid midrange threat in the right deck like silence priest or maybe a new Handlock.
---
Fuck big priest, this is beauty.
---
They said they wouldn't have one this expansion so..
---
So what age is considered warm?
---
Blizzard confirmed it will work.
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22912682
---
"Just like last year, you will be able to keep your copies of these card once they move to the Hall of Fame, and you‚Äôll also be granted the full Arcane Dust value for each card (up to the maximum number that can be used in a deck). The dust will be automatically awarded once you log-in after the Year of the Dragon begins."
---
Cant wait for this to dominate ladder
---
Not only does that reduce the variance so one player isn't raging most of the time, it also makes it do nothing if they have no minions so it can't SMOrc. So much better balanced I love it 
---
Yea, this one just looks kinda like Infinity Edge

now you have an exceptionally angry, angry angry boar (angry). 
---
you're welcome.
---
What a twist!
---
Are you looking at Wild maybe? Just checked HSReplay and metastats.net and neither have it even close to the top.
---
Ok but can you explain me why they can't use echo in two exp like "Lifesteal" or "Poisonus"?
---
Well... You only play spells giving you low cost minions and only put big minions in your deck. Is there enough support for that archetype? If so, then this will be devastating unless a class has a board clear that doesn't care.
---
I'm not sure if you're memeing, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
---
You're kidding, right? It's been Tier 1 since release IIRC. It's ability to refuel and buff everything is insane, beating even some of the worst match-ups and absolutely stomping other forms of aggro.
---
Ha! Sorry, I copied the deck from my phone straight to Reddit. For some reason that made it extra shout-y!
---
Oh, poor upset players, they have to cards released in separate years that have inconsistent text, what ever are they to do? :(
---
Seriously, your lack of self awareness is sort of astonishing here. The complaint that new players have will actually effect their ability to play the game, even if only for a very short period of time.
---
The thing your complaining about literally does not at all, and just has to do with you being *bothered* by an inconsistency. I understand complaining about inconsistencies in games due to laziness, don't get me wrong. But when done for actual reasons, I'm much more understanding.
---
It's too much money for me to be comfortable with pre-ordering, but the cards look interesting.
---
I really do feel that ¬£80 is far, FAR too much to ask for digital cards three times a year, so however good the cards are or are not I'm not biting this time.
---
I'll happily spend ¬£50 a year on Hearthstone, but I feel.. exploited I guess by the prices at the moment. 
---
Also I'm concerned that midrange hunter isn't losing anything, and I really don't want to pay ¬£80 to face the same damn deck for another three months.
---
Yeah kibler was cool and all but did you see that jacket though?
---
Will an aggressive pally with low cost cards and no reliable card draw work? 
---
It used to have an explanation. 
---
Idk when it was removed.
---
Lmfao there's no need to fix something that isn't broken. "Improving" wild? Dude it's meant to be chaotic lmao. There's nothing to "care" about. It's fun and awesome the way it is. 
---
Check my other reply, was off on the manacost for Shaw. It‚Äôs still 12 mana, and would likely still be unplayable at 10.
---
Everyone's talking about how insane this will be with quest rogue, but very few are talking about how cool that art is.  I think it's the only art we have of the villains working together, which is fun.
---
Also yes this will probably make quest rogue great ~~again~~
---
Lol!? On wich planet exactly did you play hearthstone?
---
True
---
And kibler was in the reveal stream too...F
---
I think the 0/5 is not to be underestimated. This card is definitely better than belcher because, if i remember correctly, the 1 attack the slime had rarely mattered, the fact that this is a mech and has so much more health makes it a clear improvement. Additionally the first body has 1 more attack than the belcher had (personally, I love 
---
Does it, though? A good aggro deck should be able to deal with this with only ~1 to 2 losses and hit face for a lot with everything else. Aggro decks love to go wide, not high, so I wonder how good a random Aggro minion dead really is.
---
&gt;elite cameras
---
Now just use gangup on It for a deck full of 30/30!
---
&gt; "won't know until we see it in action" is a cop out answer. Why do people evaluate cards prior to the expansion? If that's your response after all this, then idk why I'm bothering to formulate thought out analyses.
---
"won't know until you see it" is not a cop out answer. 
---
What you see as a cop out answer I see as the limits of what's possible to talk about in a productive manner. If Blizzard screws up with making "viable" archetypes, and streamers can get it wrong why do you think any single person would have anything more than just this kind of shot in the dark? 
---
We can discuss the potential for cards based on what we know but so much of what makes a deck "viable" or a "meme" deck is things we simply cannot account for without properly playing the game and seeing the meta shape. The nuances of Hearhstone make what you're asking for close to impossible. 
---
&gt; I'm bothering to formulate thought out analyses
---
No offense but you're not doing anything more than giving an opinion (card is bad) and comparing it to something that has been polished and analyzed by how many thousands and thousands of games played. Then you're asking a single person to formulate a new deck type and analyze it before anyone has a chance to play it. 
---
He‚Äôs going to the Hall if Fame. 
---
Really? Because I see a lot of pack filler.
---
The combo is prep into myra‚Äôs into chef nomi 
---
Trade in a 6/6 and play 
---
Yet, Whirling Tempest has Mega-Windfury. Which has only been printed on one other card years ago.
---
Ah, you lucked out. After Fiery War Axe got nerfed, Pirate Warrior was barely playable, but then Patches got nerfed and Warrior became a dead class until Taunt Warrior got decent again during the start of the Witchwood.
---
Research's all cards that give stealth.... I need you to live past one turn baby! 
---
I don't know about mega funerals.
---
Personally I think the 1 attack rarely mattered, having played belchers in a variety of decks. 10 health over 2 taunts is a lot.
---
No fucking reason not to use echo when it is literally an echo card. THATS THE POINT OF INTRODUCING NEW KEYWORDS. Their consistancy is so damn lazy. And all the people saying they shouldn't use echo cause echo cards rotate out next year is one of the worst excuses I have ever heard.
---
I really like the art and the flavor.
---
You should not craft both versions, only the golden. You lose dust otherwise.
---
Hearthstone has been out for a decently long time now, and this is a very mild and healthy power creep. The power level of this card is still far below that of the standard meta.  There are much worse offender printed
---
They kept Mega-Windfury which is literally only on one other non-collectible card.
---
Consistence. 
---
Wow..
---
Nobody liked that.
---
I don't think it'll completely suck. Zoo will likely shift its priorities from healing and cheating out minions to Demon synergy and minion destruction. RoS adds good demon synergy in the form of Impferno and Rafaam's Scheme, alongside the existing 1 drop Demons, Demonfire, and Void Analysist; and destruction synergies with Eager Underling, E.V.I.L Genius, and Jumbo Imp, alongside Grim Rally. Of course Rafaam will be the definitive late-game value card that Zoo could probably even drop on turn 7 as an emergency taunt while they try and out value the opponent with big legendaries.
---
Yup, you 100% drop one Jeves for this as that also eliminates the risk of having both in hand. Don't think you would want to drop both though with how quickly the deck burns through cards.
---
I do wonder though if you would drop a piloted golem for the second one though as a 4 drop with no on play effect is pretty clunky for a wild deck. 
---
Honestly, this card seems more confusing BECAUSE it doesn't say echo. A new player would probably ask themselves what the difference between this and echo is only to find out it's the exact same.
---
This and [[Sneaky Devil]]?
---
wow don't google search that phrase, it only brings up shady russian sites wtf.
---
Is it just me or is this expansion looking like it's going to be broken? So many OP cards
---
Baku is so crap in wild that odd paladin is t1 and odd warrior and rogue are t2-3. 
---
MTG also doesn't reprint keywords more often than not. It is not a good experience to start playing a game and immediatelly have to read up on what those 50 different keywords mean.
---
But yeah it's the big bad Team 5 that doesn't know what they're doing. Thanks reddit, you did it again.
---
If you want spell damage there are better spell damage cards that are cheaper

Never played √ìearthstone, no idea what this means, but it sounds cool as hell.

Ho its a copy...too bad.. WAIT ITS A COPY!! MY VALANYR DECK WILL RISE ONCE AGAIN
---
I so want to play Rafaam, then Rafaam's Scheme, then this...
---
...but it's going to be *really* hard.
---
CC was ridiculous bc it counted your opponent‚Äôs minions too. This is crap. 
---
FRIENDLY + DEMON minions only. 
---
So you think it's perfectly fine and logical to have a keyword that means something for one set then stop using that keyword because "it belongs to that set" even though they are going to continue to use it (as proven in this example of echo)?  
---
So in the game you end up with a variety of cards that do the same thing but have differing text to explain it?  
---
On this note does this assume "who cares about wild"?   
---
The logical thing would be create keyword, keep using keyword unless you aren't planning on having cards use it again.  
---
Still 2 more expansions before next rotation who knows how many will get recycled.  
---
Rush was clearly an example where they were happy to reuse the keyword yet recruit they were not even though recruit mechanic linger on into the previous set and this set.  
---
  
---
just play zola
---
I‚Äôd rather just play Twilight Drake and Firetree Witchdoctor.
---
Or just play ravenholdt assassin and put windfury on in the same turn, then rockbiter elemental next turn? No need for eureka or rng
---
Although I do think echo would be a better keyword to use here, I don't think this card has the same effect.  If you play Yogg and it casts this spell, I think you would have the option to cast it again (like unstable evolution)
---
Goblin Prank for two 6 damage rushers!.....
---
that die at the end of the turn...
---
Extra arms for Extra Ooze? Once the copies are damaged you can heal them back up with Divine Hymn, and if any live you can replicate them with Vivid Nightmare or PW Replicate. 
---
Fun meme.
---
http://everyonegetinhere.com/
---
Like I said, alone it is terrible and not even good in arena imo... but if there were other cards (maybe not this set but the next one?) that actually synergized with armor gain or increasing attack power it might slot in for early game. Right now it is just bad and only barely a step above vanilla pack filler.
---
I've been saying this for a while. They should really go the magic route and reprint cards sometimes. 
---
Like make those reprints the pack fillers. 
---
Or you draw the big minions first and play nothing until turn 7
---
Forbidden healing doesn't have to go all in, either, and you can use it with an odd amount of mana.
---
Granted, you have to cast forbidden healing after any other healing that turn, but in the vast majority of situations, that's not really important.
---
Healing minions with pieces of it is pretty nice, though.
---
Remember the terror of the turn 2 quest rouge?
---
It most likely will count multiple minions as Resurrect does and it has similar wording
---
Which one
---
Thanks! Also, you could run a Crystalizer or Saronite Task Master as a one drop to trade into early minions.
---
Hydrastrike 
---
That's some Junji Ito

I run two in my Evenlock and you better believe every thief Rogue immediately concedes when their second cutlass gets oozed.

---
The inconsistent part is having a keyword and text.  
---
Recruit was a keyword and mechanic that is again being recycled into this newest set too.  
---
This is 100% a staple in Rush Warrior which will be tier1/2 most likely
---
Malek#1918 NA trade u go first
---
Taunt meta is gonna be real.
---
Yes, because I don't give a shit about any of that.  None of it matters in the least.  It's simply a new player question.  Reserving keywords to commonly used actions makes the game easier for new players to learn.
---
That's it.  You can OCD about logic all you want, but it just doesn't matter.
---
Idk, from the way it was described above, I'd call that a tempo deck with an inner fire finisher.  You can't win if you can't stick a minion.  
---
This is different from dream petal prep in that the card you actually care about is in your hand until the actual turn you need it.  Dream petal is a requirement, but usually you don't need it to stick for multiple turns.  
---
Really it's all a bit semantic in the end, but that's how I'd delineate. 
---
People comparing it to highmane are neglecting how significant that 1 health is.
---
There is a reason why a Sky Golem rarely saw play.
---
"*Definitely*"? Definitely not "any token buff deck". Weirdly presumptuous of you considering no Token deck has even cared about a healing card like this before. It's almost like Token means 1/1. It's almost if a 1/1 is missing health, it's dead. Hmm. 
---
Maybe Zoo (as I already mentioned) because it has Lifetap to support low value fodder trash like this and values life total more, but good luck with Heal Zoo getting gutted in the rotation. 
---
Again, very very seldom in the entire game of Hearthstone do you have scenarios where you just have lots of damaged minions sitting around. 
---
I don't play it regularly. Still find the joy in it. You people are just stick-in-the-muds complaining about people using the same mechanics and decks when in reality the same applies to standard. Wild swaps around as new cards release. Some decks become irrelevant, some implement better cards and are revised. Stop complaining or just don't play. 
---
&gt;g no one runs two oozes
---
Most even pally run 2 ooze, or at least my experience.
---
Aggro has plenty of decisions to make early game, such as when to commit and when to bait removal. Dont diss it because "iTs bRaiNleSS" and "tHey JuST cLicK fACe" because its not true. 
---
Personally I'm super excited for murloc support because I'm going to play murloc shaman in both standard (aggro version) and a more value control one in wild with the quest, hagatha, and shudderwock for massive reloads
---
Except that when you have both, you can turn 1 mana into an extra murloc anyway. The only reason to play this first is if you have no other murlocs in hand
---
I wish sludge belcher in wild destroyed enemy minions o.o
---
Please share your deck list I'm curious as to what it is
---
Ehh, scheme's really iffy in my opinion. Priest isn't exactly renowned for their card draw so being a really bad topdeck and having no tutors so you can have it in hand early makes scheme really hard to use.
---
Shadequill and Lazul are fair cards that will probably be included in a lot of Priest decks, which satisfies me because they're not cards we're going to complain about seeing. As for new Obsidian Statue, I think we're overhyping it a bit. 2 Attack does not trade well with many minions by turn 5, so against wide boards it's not really good.
---
Definitely hating Rogue right now though. I know they're not going to dominate the meta just because of the omnipresence of aggro but I'm going to definitely going to hate 40 minute value games when they do happen.
---
Finally a good 2-drop to curve into [[Thunder Lizard]]
---
Also it's a 4/4. That's huge for a murloc. 
---
Yeah it's pretty comparable to [[argent commander]] which has seen some use in aggro over the years. Less consistent though, so i think you'd still prefer commander. 
---
Dota 2 anyone? Jesus it looks so similar.

Bro, remember when every Druid deck under the sun ran a 2 card combo that dealt 14 damage on turn 9? 
---
With windfury + this card any minion that sticks around after turn 9 is a potential finisher. 
---
 
---
4 attack &gt; 16 dmg 
---
5 attack &gt; 20 dmg 
---
... 
---
8 attack &gt; 32 damage
---
Huh, an aggressive 2 drop that replaces itself. I think there might actually be a deck that uses this to some effect. Not counting it out.
---
Kinda just summed up the effect on the cards, not too much real analysis. 
---
Thanks for the reply! I literally didn‚Äôt even know crafting the cards you wanted was a thing. I thought you could only craft cards you already had. This really changes the game for me now lol I feel like an idiot making this post. I was under the impression that it was pretty much full on gambling when opening packs but knowing i can dust them for the cards I want, really encourages me to keep playing. It‚Äôs crazy all the videos I watched and they never mentioned crafting once. I‚Äôm off to go dust a few useless legendaries lol. But thank you so much üòÅ I woulda probably dropped the game for good.
---
Now this guy, this guy gets it.
---
The shaman spell ups the consistency with which I have fun. 
---
I'm pretty sure at this point that rarity in Hearthstone is determined by throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. 
---
You play loot hoarders and Thalnos and 9 Lives can keep discovering them and triggering card draw.
---
Every time I play on this board I do the same, it drives me crazy.

---
No one is even mention power levels to you. Valeera does affect the board by giving your hero stealth. You are wrong on comparing these two cards.

---
Belcher was cheaper with better stats and a better token. The only advantage this has is that its a mech.
---
What priest needs are cards that silence multiple targets, so you can fill a board and then silence multiple minions for one card
---
Why does it anger you greatly?
---
It is seriously one of the most innocuous nuances in existence. Why people decide to get pissy about it is... well... hilarious, and ridiculous.
---
Also, Recruit/Echo have subtle differences to similar counterparts. Recruit always summons minions to the far-right of the board, whereas some "Summon" effects like Finja's or (unless I'm mistaken) Captain Hooktusk's will summon directly to the right of the minion itself. Unstable Evolution and Witch's Brew do *not* buff, for instance, Mistwraith. 
---
In other words, there are subtle functional differences.
---
And even if there weren't, it doesn't matter much at all anyway.
---
___
---
As for answering your question directly: why even announce new keywords if they won't be used in the future?
---
Because they are **thematically tailored to that card set.** It is about exploring an interesting/new design and establishing identity for a given card set.
---
That is the simple difference between Thematic Keywords like Inspire, Recruit, Echo, and perhaps Twinspell; and Evergreen Keywords like Discover and Rush.
---
I honestly don't get why people decide to make a big deal about something so harmless, though.
---
A lot of interesting cards and effects that are achievable in the average game without being broken.
---
They seem to be slowing the game down a bit by getting rid of Genn and Baku which makes higher cost cards competitive.
---
Do this would work with fledgling like a Mofo right? 
---
This card technicaly is not in a hearthstone yet.
---
Giant Imp? A Gimp?
---
If you care it, here's the most recent version. Totally forgot I added Hadronox. So if you highroll off Psychmelon and get Chillmaw, Lich King and Hadronox they attack into Chillmaw, Chillmaw kills Lich King, itself and Hadronox, and then Hadronox summons an 8/8 LK and 6/6 Chillmaw and you still have another copy of each in hand to build up that taunt pool.

Should be easy to pull off too.  You can play it and fury it on turn 9.  You can give it mega fury on 10 and play double earth shock to clear taints.
---
This card could be decent in Ungoro.

My friend started playing back then and I told him to craft elemental package that can be used in all classes.

keleseth zoo was built around a single card though... and a 6 health 3 drop with a proactive effect is pretty good, and it usually sticks to give value

you can't summon 5 demons either in 3 turns, what? I'm not sure how that's possible

Vanilla 5/3 wouldn't see play. This reminds me of something... "3/4 for 2 mana are bad stats" That what reddit users were saying about Totem Golem. 3 drops are usually 6-7 stats combined, 7 for premium drops. 8 stats are for cards with negative effects like freezing your whole board. Vanilla 5/3 WOULD see play, because it is a threat on it's own. But usually this card will be higher that 5/3, so it is a pretty good card, borderline OP in some heavy minion decks.
---
all you had to do was add or edit in /s to the end of your first post, yeesh
---
I ran totem cruncher. It wasn't super effective but sometimes it got really really big. It didn't work unfortunately.
---
Amgam would like a word.
---
Hah, when Rastakhan enabled Control Paladin, it became too much of a problem that they nerfed Equality. 
---
Just pull some legends back from wild, I would love to see Loatheb, Justicar, or Reno come back
---
On the website. Everything is released now.
---
Uh, why not? You can just slam this and windfury on a board with any minion for some really high burst. Even a tiger deals 20 with these two cards.
---
I just fail to see how this is better than Fireplume Harbinger. The effect is not permanent, will reduce the mana of your Murlocs by an average of around 1 and just hits god damn murlocs instead of elementals. Aggro can't use it because it needs to stick on board and control/value can't use it because it's a fucking murloc. Does Blizzard keep printing cards with antisynergy because of incompetence or because they have a master plan? Looks like Shaman is dead for good this expansion.
---
Im afraid this womt work with glinda, because echo cards might reset to 10 mana
---
Hagatha hero card does wonders here.
---
No I get that. I wish I could explain it better.
---
Ok. Here's how I see it. "be patient". All of the time we didn't have Lackeys was being patient. Then, they say "yo we got this sick new mechanic"
---
Then they show it off and it is literally like 6 cards. 6 cards of 135. So when you say be patient, to me, it's as if I have to keep waiting for this "all year" mechanic to actually be a thing. This is nothing but a sample. It's stupid that they are saying it is a year long mechanic. Why even tell us that? This is hardly something to advertise. If you had to tell someone right now what RoS was, would you tell them it introduced a new lackey card? Could you really say that it is a key defining feature of this set? Or is it just an after thought?
---
Northshire is basic tho. And Potion Vendor is pretty amazing, but I don't think it's getting nerfed.
---
I did the same and unpacked the fucking Duskfallen Aviana. 
---
Toxifin for on murlocks and that frog is a beast I believe.
---

---
Fuck
---
EVERY. DOUBLE. TAUNT CARD. HAS BECOME DOMINANT.
---
Sludge Belcher. Saronite Chain Gang. Stonehill Defender.
---
Not bad in arena at least
---
Yeah, it's pretty fun. Before the "all classes have healing" era I used to run one, it mostly revolves around cleaning and treading board untill you can go Alexstraza followed up by 2 Mind Blast and a random card that does 5 dmgs face the next turn. You gotta time it right tho, if they have ways to survive this you are screwed most of the time. 
---
That must be Al'Caid - Al'Kair's far cousin .
---
Insane, its like giving almost execute to 2 more minions with 2 mana in a favorable situation.  
---
Pretty likely it will be playable in control decks.
---
Yeah doesn't paladin have a spell to draw three 1 cost minions?
---
Too bad the quest rotates out. 
---
You are going to to that for exactly 3 days while being killed by aggro hunters over and over again and eventually come to the conclusion that if you want to play control you should just play a class that actually has a decent combo finisher that is more consistent than malligos. 
---
Because he has to use a little more imagination to jerk off to it?
---
Mini malygos and its **RARE,** which means you can put 2 in your deck for more burst-face value.  
---
Smorc card!
---
I'm not sure what you're talking about, Divine Spirit + Inner Fire has been included in plenty of competitive priest decks throughout history. Not necessarily as *the* win condition, but as a 3-4 card package that can win you the game at times, and can be used individually for solid tempo plays if you need to, i.e. as part of "Control" Priest, which the only reason you don't see it now, is Mind Blast as a finisher being more consistent, but that's going away (Anduin + Shadow Visions rotating hurts it infinitely more than it hurts the Divine Spirit package)
---
While not exactly a "meta" deck, my most played deck in Standard for the past couple seasons is a midrange-ish control Dragon Priest deck that didn't even run Shadow Visions for a long time, and Divine Spirit + Inner Fire have always done a great job there -- the idea being that your deck brings enough removal and strong minions to fight for board control honestly, and once you inevitably manage to stick something large on board (even if it takes 20 turns to get there, you have enough threats and survivability to wait) you can use it as a finisher. Or, if it doesn't work out, you still have other finisher options, like Alexstrasza + moderate size board or whatever. You destroy aggro, do pretty well against control thanks to the OTK potential (potentially taking long to assemble it isn't that big a deal vs control), and still stand a chance against combo thanks to the big minion-based threats they can't afford to ignore. 
---
Not saying my deck is unbeatable or ahead of the meta or whatever, my point is that once you stop seeing Divine Spirit + Inner Fire as something to build an entire deck around, and start seeing it as just a package that helps round out a deck that otherwise happens to run large health minions, the lack of Shadow Visions stops mattering as much. Just my opinion, though, we'll see what the next expansion meta ends up settling as.
---
This card is utter trash. 
---
done with moonmoon!
---
It is included for elemental synergy with a few elementals rotating out.  Elementals usually have a battlecry so it is kind of boring.
---
There are a few warlock cards that have synergy with that one
---
and then if you play all of those with tundra rhino thats like 22 damage. broken AF if you ask me
---
Honestly nothing is worse than [[charge]] giving rush but still calling it charge. 
---
That's a pretty solid rivercroc.... it's got that elemental tag....*nervous sweat*
---
Damn, that‚Äôs another grat golden card!
---
I know gold cards are ‚Äúuseless‚Äù, but I just can‚Äôt say the same when it gives me 15+ other golden cards. That‚Äôs just so bling
---
At least you are not taunting her

Wait what? Not at all, one of the devs confirmed that we will be seeing different kinds of lackeys added to the pool over the course of this year, so there is no way that we won‚Äôt see more generators of them.
---
Need to test it to be sure, but I expect that with Immortal Prelate the good copy will go in your deck and leave a respectable 8/5 for your opponent to deal with
---
Well so you prefer to face Dynomatic, Omega Devastator or the new mech legendary ? Lol
---
This is very wholesome 
---
Or even better turn 5 zilliax turn 6 this card turn 7 Giggling lol
---
You seen [this](https://youtu.be/U-FHDq35h8Y)?
---
Rastakhan's Rumble: let's print crazy discard synergies. 
---
Rotation: Let's send Doomguard to the hall of fame.
---
Rise of shadows: What's a discard? Let's print trash instead.
---
They even mentioned that they wanted this expansion to have "call-back" mechanics to other sets. This is obviously a call-back to Hagatha and when they INTRODUCED echo. I think the decision to backpedal on this is an absolutely stupid move on the Hearthstone team's part.
---
I was scrolling through my feed and thought:
---
"Oh that's a looks like a fairly nice r/customhearthstone card."
---
"Wait that's a lot of upvotes for a not extremely unique custom card..."
---
"Wait this is a pose on regular r/hearthstone..."
---
"Wait this is an actual new card..."
---
**"Wait Blizzard is actually doing something new with Mega-Windfury?"**
---
Heal druid has vast potential, just incorporate neutral minion assets same as Healock did.
---
Also, Druid is making a comeback in the late Rastakhan's meta as we speak.
---
Last month, I pushed to 5 with Deathrattle hunter with a 14 game winstreak.  This month (or should I say, last evening/night) I pushed to rank 5 with Quest Druid in a 9 game winstreak.  Currently sitting on the cusp of rank 4.
---
Turns out, Quest Druid is a pretty damn hard Wall Priest counter, if you understand your cards.
---
(Asia) Trading 80g quest - EnglishBob#11253 - We will both show quests,you go first.
---
Personally I think Token Druid is a near lock for tier, 1 but obviously that‚Äôs just my view.  The core is absurdly strong, and I think people are really sleeping on the forest‚Äôs aid (the new 8 mana twinspell summon five 2/2 treants). 
---
Okay so I've now crafted the Commons as Golds. Do I disenchant my regular copies, or keep 4 copies of each card?
---
Take turns opening packs. Whenever a purple is packed, add drink into a jug (whatever they like, and however much). Then whoever packs a legendary must drink the contents.
---
Wait what‚Äôs the unobtainable legendary? Is it from  the adventure?
---
You could play Autodefense Matrix going second, though, or T2 Noble Sacrifice Coin Spy/Blade.
---
And hagatha 
---
FLAVOR: I think this card single handedly confirms that Rise of Shadows lore wise takes place during or after Battle for Azeroth, which is interesting indeed 
---
Mech Hunter actually gonna be viable boys?
---
Yeah but unstable evolution was pretty much a test for echo, like extra arms for twinspell,it still doesnt make echo type effect seem like they will be printed
---
Much of the heal stuff can go in Token, it doesn't need to be its own archetype.
---
oops thought it was deck only for a sec.
---
Still doesnt make this much better
---
This card is obviously really good, but it's not like you were relying on big taunts vs Murloc decks anyway.
---
I use cruncher in even shaman.
---
RIP in peace Genn
---
Oops I responded to the wrong person.
---
You are so off the mark with this card it's hilarious. It is trash tier. People are seeing this effect and thinking corridor creeper therefore it's automatically good, it being friendly minions, and specifically demons at that, how often are you building a board of demons to have them die. If you're spending your time making a load of imp tokens, there's better things to be doing, the card is trash. If you're building a board of demons and having them die, you're losing, this being a vanilla 8/8 means nothing, the card is trash. You're never seeing this card come down early enough for it to matter. Top decked it is far far worse than a giant. The giants in warlock are simply better across the board, come down earlier a lot of the time and are better top decked since they have their discount applied instantly. This card, at best you're building a deck around it (bad), you're hoping to mulligan for it and then spend your time building board full of demons (a big chunk of which are discard cards which you obviously don't want to play with this) and waiting for them to die to play a vanilla 8/8 on turn 5 at best ... Yeah, call me sceptical but I'm not seeing it. Corridor worked because even as a top deck it meant you could reload on tempo by making some trades that same turn. This just doesn't have that, at all.
---
50 character limit exists for a reason. this post was a waste of everyone's time
---
10/10 pasta
---
Is this the best time to invest? Probably.
---
Should you invest? That is still highly debatable. The value and the relative amount of content of te set you get for $50 is honestly laughable compared to investments in other pppular (card) games.
---
You guys are funny :D

Easy, you see first I play Barnes, king of the goons that summons blood of the ancient one then I bring him back and play him again to summon blood of the ancient one and now it summons the üÖ±Ô∏èANCIENT ONE

Espionage rogue is an aggro deck? 
---
1. A set with multiple Echo Cards or the comfirmation that more Echo cards are coming this year
---
2. A set made exclusively for Wild
---
From where does the doomsayer get 1 attack?
---
What is it thinking? I don't trust it.
---
WOW!
---
You didn‚Äôt censor the eyes of the Ancient Ones, their identity could be leaked and exposed /s
---
should have put Boom on step #7 smh
---
Niether of those two cards see constructed play nor does/did Stegadon. Thus, eight stats with taunt is NOT worth four mana.
---
It‚Äôs a warning. Uninstall and don‚Äôt look back.
---
If you can't silence it and can't get some spell damage, you can still give it taunt and turn it into basically Tar Creeper
---
Now I want to live on alternative timelines where either:
---
- Toast lucks out into this.
---
- Kripp is on the receiving end of this.
---
They really want you to play priest and eat a lot of ice cream.
---
Not really. Dominaria and the Ixalan block of sets will always exist alongside each other in Standard and there are vehicle cards in both.
---
A plant type could be cool, emphasis on empowering each others, kinda like murlocs but less about flooding the boards with cheap low costm inions
---
Upsetting health stat is upsetting.
---
I like the emote step I see it is very crucial to the otk
---
Only combo deck
---
Can't wait until its nerfed into a 2/8.
---
Do you have to preorder ? 
---
I wouldn't mind that either, but it would more likely be a card on the level of Ragnaros, Lightlord over something potentially format defining like Reno Jackson or general all around staple like Loatheb.
---
Well, in the same way then, this is like Unstable Evolution, just different enough.
---
Cries in shaman
---
Look at the IQ on this muthafucka!
---
Seems really powerful at face value. Once you start trying to build a list though it starts feeling really wonky. I feel like this has to find a place somewhere. 
---
Wild players don't wonder that
---
What I wonder about is why the fuck doesn't Blizzard do anything about Wild?
---
I also don't actually wonder that, I know exactly why, Wild was never meant to be a real format, it is simply the place where cards go to die, this way, when someone notices the fact that their (incredibly expensive) Hearthstone collection is becoming obsolete and then notices the fact that the ratio of Card to Dust conversion in Hearthstone is a fucking joke, and then points out the very evident issue of: "What the fuck am I supposed to do now?" Blizzard can just say: "hur dur but wild exists" and that problem just completely vanishes leaving no negative impact or bad taste what so ever in the perception of the game ^/s !
---
I wonder if silence will be huge in the upcoming meta just like it is now. So many decks running TWO silence effects.
---
Sorry to burst you bubble op but this was posted when unstable evolution was released.
---

Mmmm. Peeps.
---
Not really. It's just different enough from Recruit seeing as a copy is summoned rather than the card itself.
---
Or just a ‚Äúrecruit‚Äù tag, perhaps?
---
I read this entire comment chain in Zilliax's voice.

That's not demon synergy lol.
---
Except when they're not treants 
---
In hearthstone or other website? I tried it and it doesn‚Äôt utilize any legendaries
---
Day one for me will be: Token Druid, Mega Windfury Taunt Shaman and then some kind of empty deck Warrior.
---
I‚Äôm sorry I read wrong. You aren‚Äôt talking about hsreplay. I‚Äôm not familiar with the hearthpwn site. Hsreplay has its own deck tracker application and collection sharing tools. 
---
I mean I guess this could count has r/badhscombos but it feels like r/hslottery to me
---
Are we getting our free legendary today or Thursday from the next expansion?
---
Happens everytime you copy-paste a deck code
---
Probably Zayla the shadow cloak or whatever the new whizbang card is coming out with the solo adventure.
---
Holy nova is incredibly bad, at the moment people play:  
---
 spirit lash (sometimes), much cheaper than holy nova, heals more to your hero hits about the same  
---
mass hysteria,  same cost but way more effective, will deal with most of a board   
---
psychic scream (for a couple more days only), disregards deathrattles and sometimes fills opponents deck with garbage (1/1's etc)  
---
Odd paladin can't play even cards like consecration  
---
Makes sense!
---
Every mtg card has at least one tribe, it's not a problem at all. 
---
But that's just it. Treants are ALWAYS 2/2's, just like SHR's in paladin are ALWAYS 1/1's. Making it a tribe means they have to put it on Nightmare Amalgam, which is NOT a 2/2. Same logic goes for trying to make SHR a tribe
---
What‚Äôs DK in this context?
---
After reading posts I can't tell if you're stupid or a troll. 
---
Wow
---
I need to see the golden version. This art is amazing lol 
---
Seems flexible at first glance, but is really clunky and inefficient compared to Healing Rain, which doesn't even make the cut in certain lists. This is great late game value if you pull it from one of the random Shaman spell generating cards though. 
---
Still busted imo. I know people are looking at roar but the health bonus allows you to keep your tokens pretty easily if you use both casts.
---
I think this is good enough
---
My thanks!!!
---
If anybody knows smthn about those changes please let me know. I do know that combo is far from viable in any kind of competitive play so I wonder why they changed it in the first place. Maybe they had to change some code to make the Undatakah / [Lucentbark] combo work as intended.
---
Probably to ensure you draw one. 
---
2 might be overkill yeah but i would definitely include 1. Since the deck has so many early drops  and Soul of the murloc allows you to create very sticky boards, Bloodlust seems like a solid finisher.
---
You're like the fifth person to do so.

8/6/6 Elemental | Your minions with Windfury have Mega-Windfury .  
---
There's this weird bug in Hearthstone where you can only put two Shadowsteps in your deck, and also they seem to be unable to target multiple minions.
---
Hopefully some day they will make it crsftsble but I doubt it :(
---
That‚Äôs a terrible card. Fake
---
That‚Äôs Nicola Saviori‚Äôs art for you. The guy draws great legendaries but I never liked his regular minion art.

Wild ultra murloc deck, my dreams come true.

Big Priest Legend 8 mana

At the end of turn resurrect a friendly minion that died this game

I wouldn't go to the support section, I'd go to the [store](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/hearthstone).  The battle.net store also lacks the Google/Apple tax
---
I think that‚Äôs powerful and interesting for it to be real, so I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs real 
---
They decided the Stagg was just too damn purple to have it be a Rare card.
---
There is always Cone AoEs.
---
I just checked, and that would be Un'goro. The Icecrown prologue came out at the same time as KFT, so we technically had a free DK on launch.
---
I wouldn't consider Vargoth a full replacement, since in K&amp;C we got both Marin the Fox as a pre-release free Legendary, and a free Legendary weapon on launch.
---
Toast would get it on stream.

---
its not overload 3 tho, so fake was right
---
Need to give this guy taunt somehow and could be pretty good.  7 mana though, ouch
---
All cards are released now what‚Äôs the point of this post? Are you goin rng to even put your opinion on the card or just show us something we‚Äôve seen 
---
looks like druid has been strong enough for too long and this is their weak expansion
---
Well the point being that if the chow dies on turn 2, odds are you never dealt the five damage, meaning it had no downside. 
---
As if Blizzard would ever give back to loyal fans
---
god they're so consistently inconsistent 
---
Huh, I thought the mechanic was a little too crazy. That should be pretty fun in windfury aggro decks

3 mana 4/3 paladin card your secrets trigger twice
---
This is a body though and makes it a lot more flexible than holding a card in your hand waiting for your win condition. 
---
Welcome to the frontpage anyhow. I bet 26 of those will be in the top 5 decks.
---
The thing about tribal synergies is that they inevitably get support because more minions of that tribe will be released. So don't worry, it will be good eventually.
---
Same reason Mage, Paladin, Druid, and Hunter don't have any scheme cards.
---
I think it‚Äôs meant as a hunter burn strategy and will synergize with some of the mage ‚Äúimproved by spell damage‚Äù cards.  But I‚Äôm hopeful for the hunter burn strategy.  Swing with the new spell power weapon, drop another spell damage dude, go ham with face damage spells, etc...
---
You're comparing it to Tar Creeper, which was really strong and widely played and has just rotated out; and to Giggling Inventor, which was nerfed.
---
If this is comparable to those cards, then it's a good card.
---
__As all things should be.__
---
It requires some setup because you need Emperor Thaurissan on 2 out of 3 combo pieces but it's extremely satisfying to blow up your opponent for 40. Coldlight oracles help a lot!
---
On the next episode of DisguisedToast.. 
---
But the body is a must-remove.

Kibler would is been great
---
When you don't have good cards or any dust, there aren't many options to play. Baku and Genn helped with that, making cheap decks easier. I agree, Odd Paladin was very strong, but you just sound salty that neither you nor your deck can beat that one specific deck.
---
Best class?

EDIT PROBELM HAS BEEN RESOLVED BY THE SUPPORT TEAM THANK YOU ALL FOR THE ADVICE IM OFF TO BUY PACKS AND MAKE DECKS

Existence of Packfillers isn‚Äôt inherently a bad thing. 
---
It looks like the same person made Azari
---
All adventure cards are craftable, I think he simply meant that you can‚Äôt unpack it.
---
Every card in the basic set that affects all characters has ALL in caps, see [[Dread Infernal]], [[Hellfire]], [[Baron Geddon]].
---
Every expansion card that affects all characters has all in lowercase.
---
It's exactly consistent and done this way to help new players understand that all really means ALL. 
---
If it works anything like the current iteration of the Prelate and Undatakah combo, it should. There should be no difference between resummoning a minion and summoning it from the deck.
---
you get multiple copies, remember Kragwa Evo Shaman got multiple copies of unstable evolution
---
Constructed decks will naturally have a much higher power level than any Arena deck. As such, the bar for what is a good card is naturally much higher. Eight taunted stats for four mana does not see play in constructed but is reasonable enough in a draft format to be good enough most of the time. Likewise, cards like Violet Wurm, an Arena curve topping all star, is not a good card for constructed, and cards that require quite a bit of synergy to work like.
---
Making a better version of a card that is not affecting the format at all is not power creep. Chillwind Yeti and Sen'jin Shield Master have not seen serious play in either Standard or Wild in years. As such, Tar Creeper and Omega Devistator are not power creeping those two cards out of seeing play since they were not seeing any play to begin with. Only when an already competitive card is pushed out of seeing play because a better one replaces it is it really power creep.
---
A fairly recent example of actual power creep occurred when the Boomsday Project was released. Spell Hunters at the time replaced Arcane Shot with Secret plan because it was just a better card. The best example though is the release of Piloted Shredder almost functionally deleting all reasonable four cost minions from GvG format.
---
A 2/6 taunted statline on a minion is not worth four mana IN CONSTRUCTED. However, it is very much worth playing at three mana given Tar Creeper's ubiquity. Seeing as Tar Creeper has a condition tied to two of its eight stats, that subtracts some amount of the card's total worth leading to the fair cost of a 2/6 taunt being three-and-a-half mana.
---
It's a copy effect not summon another grim patron so I think it will hold it's buffs.
---
we just need weapon silence
---
They won't take you on a carpet ride
---
Your role was always to ping and die...
---
It basically invalidates token based decks though... unless you‚Äôre a token based deck that can fill the board just by pressing hero power 
---
I would say heal druid fits better. But this just a card that shuffles a card that already existed in the opponents deck.
---
&gt; weak distribution
---
Actually having a lot of health is exactly what a card like this would want.
---
&gt;That is why you play the cutlass with a minion on board followed up by prep and tinkers oil and next turn you push lethal.
---
You can also skip all the burgle nonsense and play kingsbane to the same effect. 
---
Zilliax and Darius like this buff a lot, but I'm pretty sure this is the strongest synergy proposed yet. 
---
You get Archmage Vargoth for free a few days before the expansion. 
---
A lot of the F2P people have been F2P since a long time ago. If you are just now starting out then I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you either you pay with time and effort or you pay with money which is representative of your time and effort. If you want to be at the place that someone who is F2P but started playing in 2015 is at right away then yeah you need to pay money if you recently started playing and yeah if you decide to spend money then there is no doubt it will be expensive... but you would also be buying what people who are F2P have essentially been working years for... so it should be expensive.
---
how did i forget about that... editing it. the post was deleted anyway.

Play Auchenai Phantasm so your healig Cards become Damage. Than drop Reckless Experimenter into 2 Hanchclan Shadequill into 4 Shadowy figure to deAl 30 Damage.

pre-release  is 2morrow where u will get the 3 mana 2 4 legendary at the end of ur turn cast a random spell u played this turn
---
I came here for these comments alone. I am not leaving disappointed.
---
1 mana +2/+2 (and probably more)is bad?
---
Real reason why Grim Patron was busted was because of the old Warsong Commander 
---
However, I'm interested whether or not we will be able to make this into a viable deck
---
You have two cutlasses for a reason.  Pumping everything into Spectral Compass on Turn 6/7 and blowing all your class cards, leaving only a deck full of 1-mana RNG cards from your opponent's class is poor play, yet I see it all the time. 
---
Assign a flair:D
---
&gt;oondasta
---
9+2 = ?
---
This was posted right after unstable was revealed.  The original OP also calculated the odds and they were astronomical
---
Doesn't look very viable to me, you didn't add a rank 1 legend icon.
---
We all get it on the 5th, so tomorrow üëç
---
Ok, what about the situation where it's turn 7
---
As much value potential as this has, it will be useless against fast decks and if you are running a slow deck, just pay 1 more for cairne who has better base stats and a guaranteed deathrattle (unless he gets silenced of course), because you probably need at least one mana to buff this guy anyway.
---
I don't see it. I think this card is trash.
---
You triggered my Arcanite Reaper + Upgrade PTSD.
---
I feel Belcher dealt with aggressive decks better than this will, perhaps not by much, but the three attack of that versus two attack of this won't clear as much. A random minion kill against a wide aggressive board also won't necessarily absorb a minion's attack like the 1/2 token almost certainly will.
---
Make Protal Keeper a rare for the sake of consistency!
---
No need to cheat, my friend! 
---
\[\[Underbelly Ooze\]\] actually fulfills your criteria!
---
Than standard even shaman? 
---
Yes, jade claws, crackle, aya, jade lightning, etc.... and wild is a much faster meta which plays into even shamans favor. Even shaman in standard has very poor tools for retaking a lost board but in wild the recapture tools like the ones listed are nuts. 
---
Which is why it's rotating out. The point is that it gave a chance for F2P players to win a higher rank than then usually can (not deserve, CAN. A F2P player isn't expected to know exactly what decks they need to build to not be rank 19 for 3 months straight). I think that Odd Warrior/Paladin were too strong, yeah, but to me, it helped new players have fun with the game. Which is mostly what the game is about.
---
Happy cake day!

Too OP blizz please nerf!!! :O
---
I will bow before blizzards knowledge to balance its own cards just wish I had four attack. 
---
The most you can summon is 4. If you do that they will all have 1 health anyway. Unless you heal then max amount of minions is 5
---
I would say the deathrattle got value even if it hits nothing if it made your opponent trades their board instead of using a spell
---
i meant Vanguard will summon one, and Villain will summon another one, therefore leaving 2 on board.
---
Mage spell, 2 mana: 
---
Freeze 3 random enemies.
---
This sounds like an easy decision to me. I would support and continue to play the game that you're enjoying.
---
F
---
thats not what lethal means -\_-  
---
lethal means that you can either deal enough damage or do meka-thuns ability in 1 turn garentied.
---
!remindme 2 months
---
There's this ziliax card and midrnge hunter got a 3 mana draw 3 and warrior has a dr boom hero.
---
Paladin also has lots of ways to buff the attack of minions (Might, Kings, Sound the Bells) so you can probably resurrect the Villain fairly reliably as well.
---
Obviously the mana cost being cheaper can have good effects but in the end it is just much much less effective. It's like the difference between Doomsayer and Corrupting mist; the primoridal drake both clears the current board and contests the next board with its body, while this card only really contests the current board and can get silenced, transformed, or just traded into. It is less effective 99% of the time, and while I wouldn't say it's bad, it's certainly much less of a 5-star control card compared to drake.
---
That was morale lethal
---
Yep, one game the other player didn't draw their second Harrison until very late in the game. I Think they were really more focus on destroying my 6/11 weapon and didn't realize how bad of idea that was when they only had 5 cards left.
---
Because, it's mechanically more interesting as a token, that's only summoned by other cards. If they made treant a tribe, there would be more playable cards that would have to get the tribe, allowing you to just play a treant, instead of needing to generate them.

Wtf? Can you play with them? Or just open them?
---
This literally answers nothing.
---
Good in Quest Druid for removal and additional Quest triggers.
---
more like he silenced OP taunts then divine spirit their  own taunt + inner fire it to go face
---
Rotten Applebaum, Festeroot Hulk and Splitting Festeroot (and likely more minions) could easily be considered Treants, and before you say Warrior has no Treant synergy so why should Hulk be a Treant; Mage has Beasts with no Beast synergies. 
---
The copy will be damaged too. We've seen an unusual amount of healing cards (iuding neutral) in this expansion though so it might work. But probably is just too expensive
---
And it definitely doesn't want a 5+ mana minion, unless it's summoning 2 extra minions with divine shield and taunt.
---
were you playing demonblock or cubelock lol
---
With only a few changed this is pretty close to blackout bingo.
---
That one was kinda eclipsed by Jungle Panther though. Surviving a Whirlwind is more important than 1 extra attack.
---
Enrange is not a keyword though.
---
I'm pretty sure it's 50%.
---
So not only silences your taunts, it also enables his watchers to attack, fucking genius.
---
JohannGMadao#2869 EU trading 80g quest, i'll show you mine, you go first :F

Someone's got some ruffled tailfeathers
---
No I play mech paladins and I cant deal with this card. Mind control is already oppressive but I've learnt to somehow play around it. But a mass silence like this especially after casting mind control, is impossible to deal with.
---
We don't know anything, man.
---
Is gruul any good?
---
Why another warlock could sacrificial pact it of course 
---
A bit soon maybe to call that. Blizzard has a lot people testing it so maybe in a month that would be true. 
---
No I've been playing mech paladins a lot and everytime I face a priest, I cry.
---
Turn 2 millhouse, turn 3 rager, one of you is gg
---
It used to be one but Blizzard took it out due tp a lack of cardz printed with the effect and "lack of design space"
---
[[Mini Mage]]? 
---
I never thought of mega-windfury as an expansion-specific keyword... it‚Äôs just a different type of windfury, which is evergreen. If they were going to make Echo an evergreen keyword and give it a lot of support like they did with Rush then it would it make sense for this to have Echo, but that‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre doing
---
I can already imagine my 13 damage pyroblasts.

4/4/1 | Stealth Spell Damage +1  
---
Well to be fair Neptulon was played in a wide array of Shaman decks for just being a good body and refill and Siltfin Spiritwalker wasnt played really anywhere. I'd say Paladin has more justification being the 'murloc' class given Anyfin and Muloc Knight made them a tier 1 deck for over a year.
---
I could see them reusing them all in the third expansion. This expansion is the Villains attack, maybe the 2nd is the Heroes fight back, and the third is a massive head-to-head.
---
Part is probably also to do with new player experience. Imagine this was your first expansion. You've read or watched videos about Twinspell and the schemes. Say there was one Adapt card, is it instantly clear what it does?
---
The point is simple, to keep the number of keywords in active use at any one time limited.  Makes it easier for new players to learn the mechanics.  But some are good enough to make it worth adding them in permanently. 
---
As to mega-windfury... it's a joke keyword, and not really a keyword.  It's just windfury, but more windfury.
---
I think we can all say we'll miss them at some point, but at the same time are glad they're leaving standard.
---
http://everyonegetinhere.com
---
Turns out Rafaam is both callback and villain
---
Are u dumb? This is obviously a buff
---
really, mind control? what's the worst target that someone steals from you, i don't know that decklist tbh.  
---
it might need tuning, maybe increase the mana cost by one on account of wild having too much preist removal?
---
Now you know what to do. Change your 3 drop and take mind control tech instead because that's clearly the issue with your deck!
---
Nope. 
---
I can when I get home but I will warn you the deck isnt tempo orientated, its closer to old priest decks where you simply try to out value your opponent. I run DK Valeera where most lists cut her and the goal is to squeeze as much value out of every play you can until your opponent runs out of resources.
---
Vs control decks like odd warrior its 100% can you out rng them with stealing shit though haha.
---
Hahahahahaha I just choked on my lunch üòÇüíé
---
Mega Windfury is just an improvement to the core evergreen keyword Windfury which exists in the base game and has been reprinted since.
---
Why make keywords when you're not going to use them and just add clutter to the text box? Why put keywords behind expansions? It's entirely arbitrary. 
---
"Let me change your mind."
---
Imagine a mechanic egg that has zilliax magnetised with it. Now imagine taking it with mind control and then silencing all my other magnetic upgrades minions with Mass Dispel. Now we have a problem.
---
Can you clarify for me if the Wild stats assume Academic Espionage was cut from the deck?
---
I am more upset in the lack of keywords not only in the expansion itself but in future expansions. 
---
Magnetic  would of been far more successful  if there were not only more mecs  but more magnetic  cards.
---
And sadly no one is surprised that this expansion has none.
---
Which is weird because  this expansion is suppose to be the recycled  expansion. So if this one does not have it we know none will.
---
And I do not want to hear about it being bad for new player experience.  Stop treating new players as dumb.  Also it does affect the new players  experience  because  it makes it less interesting &amp; fun.  
---
You are not thinking how a casual player might play a game every day and doesn't really concentrate on what they're doing. 
---
Some minions are overstatted for their Mana cards but have the text "can't attack" or other downsides like a deathrattle that heals the opponent, making self-silencing a beneficial act. Example: [[ancient watcher]]
---
*Let me just put together this cool control with the new cool fatigue cards like Archivist Elysiana*
---
*Queues into Control Warlock with Jaraxxus, dies to Infernals*
---
*Pikachu face*
---
I think they're suggesting that there will be quests throughout the year to get packs, not just on expansion launches
---
me go face good
---
... so?
---
You get the rewards based on how many wins the run had when it gets retired. The idea is to play until 2 losses to maximize the arena rewards.
---
Honestly there are so many signs of high turnover at Team 5 that I'm sure it's the reason.
---
Someone probably came up with this idea of reducing the amount of keywords, and now that person doesn't work there anymore and the replacement person has a different opinion so now we are all going in a different direction.
---

Chef Nomi: divide 36 drinks evenly among all other players.  Then assign 6 individual drinks, amount and targeted as you choose.
---
I'm sorry but Silence Shaman is the future of Silence archetypes. Hate to do that to you, but I had to.
---
because 3 losses , the arena run end. 2 losses is as far you can go. so people will generally try to play the longer they can until they have 2 losses because arena rewards you better the more you win.
---
You should play until 2 losses just to see how far you can get. The farther, the better. When your run is retired, you should get a RoS pack in your rewards. 
---
Although there is some confusion with the terms used in the update, it's clear that they are talking about Witchwood, Boomsday and Rastakhan packs.. and not packs from a future expansion this year.
---
You don‚Äòt feel 1 in 2 billion lucky today?

Should have made it Mecc and decc 
---
I‚Äôll add you I also have the quest I‚Äôm frosty#14265
---
I am looking at the patch notes, and I am looking at the 4 card backs, but I don't see it saying anything about android or ios.  I even did a CTRL+F "android" and CTRL+F "ios"
---
It does. It's not random though.
---
What am I looking at
---
When I started playing way back when, the one card that confused me was Ysera because she has no special tooltip nor can you see her cards in the collection. Lich King has the same problem and Rexxar is also kimda confusing.
---
The tooltips make the whole keyword debate null imho.
---
Fully expected wall priest meta, so I prepared a rezz jamming deck in advance, but I am seeing nothing but fun experimental decks that my deck was not specifically tailored against :(
---
ok awesome can u do it now?
---
Yes, the "play until two losses" is for maximizing the rewards, but if you only care about the pack, just make it to after the draft.
---
Eh... I can kinda see the logic. A year from now when Witchwood rotates out, it would be the only Echo card in standard, which would actually be confusing for new players. Mega-Windfury is pretty self-explanatory, on the other hand.
---
Your probably right.
---
Wild is a thing, and Anyfin is a solid tier 2 deck there. 
---
Source: Got absolutely sick of the standard meta, played anyfin pally from 20 to legend in wild last season. It's not a control/combo deck anymore, it's a Call to Arms based curve deck that also has the ability to OTK with anyfin if the game goes long, or cheese out wins on turn 3 with the High Priest Thekal/Molten Giant interaction. It's a lot of fun if you're into simple autopilot decks.
---
the new cards, find them in your collection manager. click on their details and it shows how to obtain them.
---
Blizzard just needs to give us an APK link. It's a free app anyway
---
Charge still exists wtf. They removed enrage because there are only a few cards.
---
&gt;Armagebum
---
Which country used that name? Spain?
---
The English name is The Boomsday Project. 
---
I want to try out this new card game! WHAT?! THERE'S READING IN THIS? EW GROSS.
---
I believe that there are 4 0-mana minions, so that would be (1/4)^6 = 1/4096. 
---
Unlikely, but crazier things have happened in HearthStone. 
---
Because preist may be playing cards like [[Ancient Watcher]] which you want to silence. In the past that has been a pretty decent deck and I think it will be somewhat competitive this expansion too.
---
As for your difficulties playing against mass dispel, I'd recommend either not magnetising minions by playing them on the right side or just passing if you have a big enough board already.
---
Exactly. So why is keeping keywords to just the expansion they were more important than keeping the keywords consistent across cards. 
---
Say a newbie wants to dip into wild, and they look at a echo card, and a card that says it does what they think echo is. Isn't that just as confusing?
---
Don't worry the netdecks will be here soon.
---
No it was because it was an amateur dev team of like 5 people making a game on unity. The game was simple because according to the job openings page for hearthstone team since year 1, it was obvious this was an amateur team.
---
Oh ok.  I guess I'll just continue working at my job...and not cast any spells for a bit.  So lame. 
---
I think this is because you can only repeat it once. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting, and they don‚Äôt say twinsplell because you can‚Äôt keep it
---
I think it's the Chinese client's secret symbol.
---
Outjerked yet again
---
In Shadowverse, you can look at the tokens a card like Ysera may give you. 
---
Oh I forgot you could read up on card backs in game to find out how to obtain them.  Thanks!
---
Ok understandable. But how often does one see these cards? Barely. Besides, what I suggested was one of the several ways you could nerf it. Other ways would be to to remove the draw entirely or increase the mana cost by 1.
---
Safeguard is pretty late for an aggro deck considering that there would some kind of AOE removal available at that point. This expansion didn't have a cheap neutral taunt that helps aggro boards like \[\[Stonehill Defender\]\] was really

r/isthatajojosreferrence
---
Pretty sure its meme on everyone saying the cat has more attack then the big ice thing
---
Or twinspell for the shaman spell 
---
You are definitely overvaluing Jumbo Imp.
---
Not only is 10 mana much more than Corridor Creeper ever was, it also only activates off *friendly* Demon deaths. Creeper activated whenever ANY minion died.
---
If they can't keep what echo means in their precious head, then why bother to cater to them? People that casual aren't dropping hundreds of dollars on the game.
---
I qas regering to a design point likw why would they remove tnose kwywords if its in the classic/basic sets that all the new players are forced to use. Because after they get accustomed to tjose keywords they dont exiat anywhere else in the game. 
---
Repeatable means you can fucking repeat it
---
And don't forget to bring a towel!
---
Not really an issue except against one type of deck. Against that deck it acts as a great tech card, so don‚Äôt think it deserves a nerf. Often times it isn‚Äôt doing much other than maybe silencing a card and drawing card. 
---
Adding in the mind control fluff doesn‚Äôt help the argument. Plenty of cards become even more powerful when paired up with other cards if you can pull off the requirements. 
---
Thankyou for the advice and your insight.
---
There are two kinds of keywords:
---
* Evergreen: taunt, divine shield, spell damage, battlecry etc.
---
* Thematic: echo, inspire, magnetic, adapt etc.
---
**What's the point of thematic keywords?**
---
It's to make different sets feel more distinct, feel more flavorful and make them more marketable. 
---
What do you remember about The Grand Tournament ? Inspire and Joust.
---
What do you remember about Journey to Ungoro? Legendary quests, adapt, dinosaurs...
---
**Why is reusing Echo worse than reusing Mega-Windfury?**
---
When WW rotates next year we would be left with Witch's Brew as the only Echo card. "Echo" word isn't intuitive whereas Mega-Windury is obviously a better Windfury.
---
What are the odds of this happening? Someone do the math
---
"Year of the dragon sets" can't mean sets from year of the raven.
---
That's all cool but I'm not sure that makes the birthday gift any less weirdly specific.
---
Oh my God. I had to go back and check again. 
---
You're the worst character ever towelie.
---
Idk if safeguard is an aggro protector either. 2 mana behind curve on a turn where your hoping to be pushing lethal, and aoe is already online is a pretty poor aggro protector.
---
Aggro protectors are things like tar creeper or crypt lord which are amazing at protecting tokens from minion based damage
---
kemaleb#2162 EU 80g quest
---
Mine too. The only OTK that didn't feel BS, you had to plan your entire play around it and then cast it twice to really OTK.
---
it remains to be seen lol , isn't this the normal pre expansion notes? they are usually packed with information even for the previous expansion.
---
they have been saying they wanted to improved communication over the last few years and there have been complain of how it's the same thing. it may changed though if they remain consistent on communicating if we have stale meta this year and more active on balancing  when the cards cause some problems.
---
one thing that seem different is the set power level though, no more Genn/Baku or Death knight power level kind of design, hopefully...

How is anyone supposed to concentrate on his stream with all the exposed shoulder???
---
I love how the stupid hunter legendary is a free space.
---
Every single expansion, without fail
---
Or you get two King Krush by turn 6 like I did yesterday. Either way really. 
---
Dont you have like no time turn 1 even on the draw?
---
There isnt enough time to even handle all the animations in this combo.
---
I wouldn't even mind if they removed the keyword when the other echo cards rotated out in a year, but it should at least have it for now
---
Team 5 is as far from the word 'consistency' as one end of the earth is from the other.
---
But that's being nice and they've been fucking up way too many times for way too long, so...
---
The most disappointing development team in an ongoing game award for the past 5 years goes to Team 5.
---
Thanks Dadgar
---
Except not really, Blizzard isn't even internally consistent on which to reuse. So saying that's how it should be when Blizzard could just as easily decide the other way means it's a poor defense of the decision. 
---
Obligatory 'it is not "at the same time" '. It's a complex linear combination of basis states that has its own ontological nature. It's not apples OR oranges, it's not apples AND oranges. It's a complex linear combination of apples and oranges.
---
I really did want to hit face.....
---
Oddly specific yeah, but no more so than it would have been 3 years ago if it's his favourite card and/or deck.
---
It was because enrange only activates when the minion is damaged, but they wanted to print more "when this minion gets damaged" as the trigger. Enrange wasnt being used too much anymore, and also, it didnt got much support like "summon a minion, give it rush", or "give a taunt minion +2/+2", since enrange was too closed and things like "give an enrange minion + 1 attack" its too generic and not worth the existance of the keyword as an **evergreen** keyword. Its more intuitive to make effect like "give a damaged minion X" than "Give a minion with enrange X", or "give an enranged minion X".
---
So they ditched it, wrote the entire effect, and moved on. We still see the effect from time to time, but not a keyword anymore. It made complete sense tbh, but it feels weird to start the game with enrange and be so used to it, and now see it gone. I still call the mechanic enrange, but I understand why its not keyworded anymore.
---
Repeat what? What does repeat apply to?
---
IOS has no update yet.
---
Keyword all the things!
---
Trying to make things foolproof, just makes bigger fools! Consistency is best practice.
---
This is a non-answer and entirely unhelpful to the discussion at hand.
---
Doesnt change the fact that the card is overstatted. It's good against several decks and not just mechs. Also if you're playing against people that silence 1 minion with that card then you probably arent in high enough elo yet.
---
It would even make sense to use echo is shaman is hagatha themed this expansion

Hey leggie_blondie, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

It is live on EU.
---
did you read the patch notes? 
---
I detailed my thought process in the post more. Warlock is the most Standard-focused class of the set. Nearly all of the cards have severe issues in Arena. EVIL Genius and Arch-Villain Rafaam are probably the best other choices, but cards with downside and legendary cards have trouble impacting the Arena meta. 
---
u/jdurica gave that example on the last set of patch notes, when the change was accidentally listed there. Wish that guy posted more often; his comment history is a goldmine of Hearthstone mechanic information.
---
Not its not. No notification, and I am in the game with no update
---
They‚Äôre both trying to passive aggressively take jabs at each other lmao. Toast and Peter worked infinitely better with them bouncing their enthusiasm off of each other.

Shhhh, don't give Blizzard any ideas.
---
*cries in wild Evenlock*
---
It depends on you  definition of power creep. For me, turning a useless card into a slightly more playable card is not power creep because its not going to push the power curve up in any way. 
---
However if you view power creep on a card by card basis, not as a system thing. This is power creep because it is objectively better than the previous card. It's still the same statline (6/4/7) with the same tribe (none) with the same keyword (spellpower +1) but the new card has an additional keyword (taunt).
---
Spell damage wont stack, so your math for turn 3 is off. Still 5 dmg on missiles 7 dmg on cinderstorm 
---
True but with odd warrior or dragon priest I'm most of the times able to deal with it. 
---
We mostly got the value and anti control tools for a value based meta, but we are missing most of the survivability that we need for aggressive decks. At the same time, aggro doenst have any strong reload super tempo card atm. Midrange and tempo dont look like have a striclt good finisher for matches.
---
All in all, the power level of every strategy went down, which does make aggressive decks that prey on unprepared and inconsistent strategies. 
---
I never said aggression didn't win game. All I intended to say was that it was far, far less aggressive than the format that preceded it.
---
Playing control on ladder was almost impossible during MSoG format. Jade Druid was really the closest thing, and it was used mostly as a counter to the counter to aggression. However, it was a much more viable way to play during Un'Goro.
---
I've never even heard of this bug, but it sounds awful.
---
Not the Echo keyword though. It shall not return, because ^having ^^to ^^^read ^^^one ^^^^tooltip ^^^^^is ^^^^^^so ^^^^^^^hard.
---
Logged in right now, just didn‚Äôt get an update or Archmage.
---
Maybe we'll get the truth one day ..
---
They've said that they only reuse evergreen keywords, and they other keywords are for flavor within a set. 
---
It honestly looks like he's giving us the middle finger
---
Same here

What I'm saying is that if you pick up Vargoth, and then try to log-in on mobile. It doesn't let you.
---
That's my experience, at least.
---
This is really nice!
---
I hope they keep doing these QoL updates at this rate
---
I understand now, this makes the most sense. Thanks for the reply.
---
cause the update inst out on ios/android, u playing the old patch.
---
Va-jai-jai?
---
Or 4 Secrets from 4 different classes
---
That's not how the card works...
---
is there a way to see all the golden animations???
---
Great vid ! 
---
Well, if this works then it's the return of the turn 1 yeti, kind of
---
O shit it stacks on the minion.. damn x.x
---
Honestly the best part about this upcoming rotation is this card will be removed from the ‚Äúrandom mage card‚Äù standard pool
---
I made the exact same point about Swampqueen Hagatha in another thread and got downvoted.
---
That's what I'm getting as well.
---
9 to face without windfury, 11 to face with windfury on the eel.
---
The real conundrum is whether it's better to wait it out, or fire off the 11 to face...
---
Thanks!
---
Wait, so I can make a  deck without having to complete? Thank god.
---
Having more than 30 health is a cheat
---
Hey man don‚Äôt be hateful.
---
Only if you draw Boulderfist Ogre
---
I have a feeling "Repeatable this turn" means Repeatable once. Where Echo is multiple times. That's why they didn't use the keyword.
---
Meh, it's okay, but we still can't cancel "finish deck" when we thought we had 30 cards but don't.
---
Mecha-Jaraxxus is a Mech, not a Demon, so you would have to use E.M.P. Operative
---
Do you remember if the dust we received in previous hall of fames was just for two copies of a card and not for any extra you have? If not,this is a dust nerf...
---
Un'Goro dropped a year after Standard was created. A lot of people were still aware of the cards in Wild. I would say more than half of the playerbase was aware of GvG cards when Un'Goro dropped.
---
It was also a fairly popular meme deck at the time due to Kripp and I wanna say Dane playing it and making videos on it.
---
You have to keep context in mind. Its not like now where we are 3 years into the split and 4 years from GvG.
---
When Un'Goro dropped we were less than a year out from the peak of Dr. Boom spam.
---
That's very narrow minded to think a twitch plugin solves the problem of a huge variety of keywords.
---
oh no, i was responding. "If someone says muda muda, you say ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA"

No just put zola in your deck so you can have one more archmage

But what about raffam callback?
---
Spellstone is rotating too
---
Yes

I did.

Really let himself go

you can still play the old patch on mobile if u haven't logged in on PC, a least what some redditors claim.

You will get the maximum amount that you can put in a deck, with golden having priority.  in your case, you have 1 golden, and 2 regular cards so it will refund 1 golden and 1 regular black cat.
---
Seriously, in a few years we might have a decent game finally. (Just kidding I love this game, but it could always be better)
---
**That is so genius**
---
It's hard to say for certain, I don't think either is amazing but my inclination is towards rafaams scheme or plot twist. Plot twist could potentially be a good way to remulligan an awkward hand or dig for specific answers. Scheme just because it can become above average without synergy, just holding it

You walked into the wrong room, intruder.

Yeah it's super straightforward and I'm glad they included it.

The only thing us murlock players need is a legend murlock with power: if you have only murlocks in your deck, all your murlocks have +2 healt.

but yeah even just for one day ,  it can feel overwhelming, my issue is that they are tagged with fluff, feel like it could use some other new tag so we can filter it specifically, there are other fluff post that may be interesting, filtering "fluff" would just filter it all.
---
'cast when drawn' is that exact same mechanic Faldorei Strider already has among a few other cards like Deck of Wonders. It's not going to work
---
Wow it is really magical trick!
---
No problem! I will never understand what drove Blizzard to print two cards in the same class with similar names and nearly identical effects.
---
True, Starfire was the 6 mana draw and 5 damage one.
---
Cuz the only thing fucking murlock decks is just the early 1 healters getting fucked 
---
Yeah what's that??

I didn't even know this was a bug until I experienced it yesterday. Glad to hear that I won't be losing a match to THAT ever again.

Aye, hopefully won't be too much longer! Thanks for hanging in there!
---
No problem üôÇ
---
What you're describing is subjective power taking in other factors like meta, card interactions and pace of play. 
---
This objectively is the same cost, for the same card with more on top. It is objectively a better card, because it offers more for the same cost. 
---
You could make the same argument that Ice Rager is subjectively worse than Magma Rager because ice rager can't be used to trigger something like mortal coil or be the starting block for a defile chain. But objectively Ice Rager is more stats for the same cost as magma rager, making it objectively a better card. 
---
V nice of them to also update the wilds cards as well. 
---
They removed the Charge/Rush bug. They had to sacrifice something for that.
---
Let's say you already have one copy each of non-golden Genn and Baku. Still craft golden if you can afford it? And should you dust the regular copies first since only one can fit in a deck?
---
No. Everyone receives this Legendary for free.
---
Let me clarify that. Joke mechanic doesn't mean it's not viable, but that it's a funny play on an existing mechanic, that isn't taken too seriously, hence the charrrge instead of charge example. 
---
[removed]
---
But this post is perfect proof that they are inconsistent in their inconsistency
---
No, you seem to be still misunderstanding what I'm saying. I explained it further in my other response though. I don't think you are correct that I am missing your point, and still think you are missing mine. I'm not talking about turning every mechanic into a keyword. Obviously that would be a bad idea. I'm specifically talking about the process of having expansion specific keywords, and then not reusing those keywords in the future, even when you use the same exact mechanics.
---
Chub Toad was the example I used for you, as that isn't even a different card being released with the same mechanic, it is the same exact card being released in a different set, yet they still choose to get rid of the keyword and instead explain the mechanic through text.
---
The point is there are very good design reasons to do this, even if it *seems* wrong at first glance due to "inconsistencies". The point is those inconsistencies aren't really that big of a deal in comparison to the design reasons that make it worth doing it the other way. A bunch of people online that don't understand the nuances of card design and are miffed about inconsistencies doesn't change that.
---
I typically play Hearthstone on an iPad, I played a bit today, I wanted to login on my Mac and check how much are the pre-purchases and I was greeted by a card back reward "for logging on PC" (I played on this Mac before) and then I received a Rise of Shadows legendary. I'm very confused because expansion isn't out yet. I went into "my collection" and there it is, a Rise of Shadows legendary. Is this a bug or I missed some sort of an event?
---
not a bug, it's this expansion free legendary. it's kinda like Marin the Fox
---
it makes sense to me that things like echo and spare parts are kept to each expansion keywork wise becuase having 1 echo card would possibly be confusing to new players, since "echo" isnt exactly clear on what it does  
---
mega windfury is pretty clear as long as you know what normal windfury is, which is in the classic set
---
But... But why
---
There are universal mechanics like Haste (Charge) that overlap but set specific ones do exist, even between sets in the same Magic Standard. These set specific ones are often reused and there is a list of those mechanics and how likely they are to be reprinted (as stated by the developers) known as the Storm Scale (https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Storm_Scale).
---
For example Tireless Tracker (from the Shadows Over Innistrad expansion) does not have the Landfall mechanic, even though Landfall has existed before and was actually reprinted 2 sets before Shadows Over Innistrad. 
---
omg I am gonna cry
---
If I have 2 normal Black Cats already, is there any point in crafting 2 golden black cats? I thought I read somewhere that you can make profit having both gold and non gold commons. 
---
Done, was searching for the flair button for a while turns out I can't do it on mobile, the only problem with making a new flair is that it'll really only be relivent for a few hours before it's not used for another 4 months.

Ohhh I'm so sorry for posting this then! I removed the post. Sorry and thanks for explaining it to me.
---
That art though... absolutely badass.
---
0 mana choose ones
---
Cursed Blade would be a nicer visual effect than Bloodfury
---
Weapon can get immune (no durability loss)
---
Missing a quest and full secret tree.
---
Chub Toad can't have a tool tip though, so for a real TCG I can see that design direction. I'll concede that to you. 
---
Still think you're missing my point though, as I am *not* advocating giving every mechanic a keyword, but I've read yours and can confirm for you that I understand. You have been abundantly clear. 
---
Anyone able to work out the actual off of this happening, given you have the starting cards?
---
can't they just add and remove it? even if they leave it there permanently , like they said in that post , some people still post flavour text from time to time after the expansion have launched. do reddit have a flair limit?
---
3/10 would hit 
---
Will i be able to craft baku and gen after the update? Cz the game is updating and i havent still cz i thought it goes live on the 9th of april
---
One trillion seconds is 31,709 years, for context on how much a trillion is.
---
But what if you didn't have a minion die this turn. Who do you want to summon then?
---
I thought they added a special quest slot? 
---
Not saying the card is bad, it's a really solid threat in Arena.
---
But, King Krush only sees play because of Kathrena. Comparing a card to King Krush isn't a good indicator of meta relevance.
---
So draw more low impact cards, amazing. The only way that would be of any help is to turn them into legendaries with Liam's, but that's over two turns...not really good
---
Yes. Pretty high up in the comments.
---
Again I highly recommend looking up so articles/podcasts on the matter because they will explain it far better then I can, but the gist of it is:
---
Evergreen is reserved for very very simple mechanics that are new player friendly and are largely self explanatory (rush makes a minion go faster and attack immediately, taunt draws the attention of other minions so it has to be hit first, etc). These make up the core mechanics of a game.
---
Deciduous is for mechanics that are simple but maybe limit design (Charge makes sense to players, but is dangerous on many cards) or has very niche uses (mega-windfury is just more windfury, but its inclusion needs to make sense for the specific creatures).
---
Expansion specific keywords are every other keyword that does not meet these criteria. They are often tied to the world they are trying to explore in the specific expansion. An expansion keyword can be promoted to the other two ranks just like rush and lifesteal were.
---
When talking about Echo specifically, it's very simple: Echo is not simple or important enough to be a recurring keyword.
---
You profit off of having the gold ones, you get 400 from each then you get an extra 50 if you dust them. If you just keep normal ones, you get 40 from each and then an extra 5 from dusting. You don‚Äôt get dust from the normal and the golden, but if you craft the golden you‚Äôll get the dust from the golden instead because the game maximizes the dust refund. 
---
TLDR; crafting the golden ones awards a 100 dust gain whereas the normal gives you a 10 dust gain
---
But echo is kind of blah 
---
Mega-windfury is freaking awesome.
---
That's only for commons, since they give 50 gold when you dust them, compared to the 40 they cost.
---
Otherwise, there's no point in crafting the golden. 
---
Question: When did the effect from Crystal Core become silencable?
---
Last I checked, at least when it made things 5/5, silence didn't work. The aura effect is applied to the hero, not to the minions. So, even when you silence them, they stayed 5/5's. 
---
Aldor Peacekeeper would let you set them to 1's, because Aldor applies an effect to the minion forcing it to 1. But the effect forcing it to 5 (now 4) was on the hero, and you can't silence heros (most of the time).
---
Now, I know they nerfed it to 4/4's, but I didn't think they changed the effect that much. So... You might not need the "unless silenced" text there.
---
I honestly laughed at the meme custom card that said "If your deck contains no spells, your deck contains no spells" and was disappointed when I pulled both that and To My Side. Complete 180. 
---
Good cringe
---
If it works the same way as unstable evolution, it actually is functionally different. If it is casted from a random effect like Yogg or Runespear, you will get the Shadow copy in your hand, whereas Echo cards did not have this effect, you had to play them from your hand.
---
KK is bad and only sees play when you cheat him out (or clone him and smash face multiple times).
---
I lost because of fatigue lul 
---
Lmao I can definitely relate to that haha. I typically only play it at the end of the day when I know I‚Äôll have time. I‚Äôm honestly surprised how effective it is. I mostly do it to wreck those priests and Aggro mages lol

You're totally right! I goofed on that because of voodoo doll which has a battlecry and deathrattle. Shadowy figure indeed gains the deathrattle from its battlecry and doesn't intrinsically have one.

even if the update is not released , normally users should still be able to log in , the only downside is they can't play against people on PC, only with Android/iOS users.

did you played on a pc version before this? https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b9hjwn/reminder_if_you_login_on_an_updated_client_you/

if yes, you are locked out from playing on your phone until the update is on itunes. 
---
Yea, it‚Äôs a bit confusing, but it‚Äôs not a huge deal.
---
More importantly this expansion seems pretty on the mark as far as power level and has a lot of cool and interesting cards.
---
I think with this new set and the rotation and the cards being HOF‚Äôd, HS is gonna he in a really good spot.

Retool the quest or buy a pack

Yup I did log in on the newer on pc . Now trying to log in via iPad. Thanks for the info!

Thrice would be too many, once inadequate.

It's from the Rise of Shadows pre-release event at Blizzard HQ.  Kripp, Trump and 4 other streamers are doing all-day streams with the new content.
---
Year of the dragon you mean, year of the raven was last year, year of the mammoth is two years ago rotating
---
Do it.
---
That's what happened the other times.  
---
They just say that because they would rather you finish than give you a freebie.
---
How many ravens where added in the year of the raven?
---
I don‚Äôt see any flaws with this plan captain

I would too, if there was a way to obtain this card together with Shield Slam by a Warlock with [[Treachery]] and [[Wrathguard]].

What's a good deck for the new legendary? I was trying to think of one, but couldn't.
---
Well imagine brawling on the same turn. It could very well kill your opponent from 20 health.
---
VEGETA!!!
---
You should report that player to Blizzard. He is *clearly* hacking. 
---
Raven isn't a tribe and Dragon Paladin is an actual concept that Blizzard is trying to push.
---
Ok so since Black Cat is a common, I will make some type of profit by crafting two golden versions of the card even though I already have two normal versions??
---
Landfall isn't a key word, it's an ability word. https://mtg.gamepedia.com/Ability_word

If you're looking for a defensive option for a slower deck the new 4 mana 4/6 Taunt looks good. But yeah, it's no Tar Creeper.
---
Yah obviously didnt get it for logging in today, what a cheater 
---
Right, he's the free preview card, just like Marin.
---
No, that effect is a bit different due to the dormancy effect. This would probably work fine since it doesn‚Äôt need a dormant form for the minion being resummoned.
---
Yes he is the callback and has the battlecry of the Golden Monkey.

but it's flex bro

You have failed, for the crocolisk's reincarnated form as an elemental is in fact real.

For obligator isnt it very different than kicker?  The ability needs to be countered separately but if it was a kicker 1 counter would stop it

The flavor/art/mechanical mismatch feels like a smaller version of the [[Emmara Tandris]] and [[Voice of Resurgence]] debacle from Dragon's Maze.
---
I'd have to say this is fake. The lowroll/highroll potential is a little crazy, and we haven't seen a way to properly give a minion Charge since a nerf to the Charge card itself.

I think because its only repeatable once, Atleast thats how I interpreted it when I read it.

No, I'd feel bad about giving away their Premium stats live.  You [can use this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CI3vP0V_wlBVlZrU6C2Tsubhp3hPY783cdZCpZZlAr0/edit#gid=1825905346) to copy/paste their table and convert it.
---
My plan is to use 2 weeks after launch, 4 weeks after launch, and 2 weeks after any patch changes.
---
You can use an emulator like Bluestacks.
---
A few years ago you would also get 1 classic card pack for logging in on various devices: Android and apple and tablet and phone each (4 packs total I think).
---
Does that still work?
---
The 10th pack comes with the free arena entry...
---
IDK man, even if you combo with whirlwind at 7+1 mana, you're using 2 cards, 7 turns holding a card and 8 mana for a very unconsistent outcome of 7-28 dmg (random targets).
---
PS: just realized I started evaluating this card at 4 Mana and kept theoretically increasing its cost in every comment lol.
---
Judging by some of the comments this isn't even his Final Form!
---
So from what I read they said they are using data from the highest winrate decks to make the decks. It sounds like before they were calculating the actual highest (odd rogue with 1 dead card &gt; best quest rogue deck) winrate. Now I think they're finding the highest winrate that includes the cards. With insufficient data I'm guessing it's going to default back to a dead card status. I don't believe they're using AI to actually make the deck. I'd love to hear more about this though because I've been doing simple AI on and off for the past year or two (only a tad of machine learning).
---
They're probably saving those recipes for Zayle.
---
What the fuck
---
No, just packs from RoS
---
Play Rogue. Kingsbane or Mill; either works.
---
Rogue allows for enemy bounces using Sap and Vanish. It also has efficient removal in the form of Vilespine. Kingsbane is often just too aggressive for Priest to handle, whereas Mill works because Big priest can't play that many cards per turn.
---
Would have
---
Considering no one has said we will, I'm thinking not.
---
On mobile it exits out of the deck when you say no
---
No, leave it at 2 losses and on the 9th your get your rewards and a free arena run
---
Is Witches brew playable 5 times in a turn though? Or only repeatable once, like a twinspell, but only for this turn. That would be a difference if it works that way
---
Seemed like a no-brainer thing to introduce this year, since they say they want to actually care about improving the core of the game.
---
Yeah, /u/Meret123 clearly gave the correct answer. Blizzard use the "Mega-Windfury" keyword because they think it sounds cool/funny, and that outweighs the possible keyword confusion. 
---
On the other hand, they don't want to reuse the "Echo" keyword on a single card because of their policy on keeping some keywords limited to a single set to avoid flooding the game with thousands of them.
