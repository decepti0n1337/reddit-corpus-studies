But they would still be more interesting than now in that there would be at least some strategy, as opposed to the current arena meta where you just pick cards that buff and are big

Depends on what decks you are playing. 
---
For that particular combo, you're likely ahead enough to procc the block and to cancel their gameplan. That would be with tempo or aggro decks, which also benefit from playing Loatheb on 5 to keep ahead, that's a matter of planning ahead. 
---
If you play control, you play for survival, tempo isn't as important, and hands down, unless the mage draws poorly, you're fucked.
---
Just use Hagatha, pick Beat Friend Forever and cast Duplatransmogrifier on it
---
Been having some serious success with murloc shaman, but the prevalence of evolve shaman has shifted the meta heavily towards aggro. 
---
Which means now is the time to build your strongest control deck
---
If I were to go to any stream and shout "Let's kill Putin", I would be banned. And rightfully so.

Uh what party exactly do you need a citation for?

None of what I said is exactly [citation FUCKING needed] or do you not understand how countries use their economic influence to their advantage?
---
I mean you do realize China is vying to be a super power right? And one of the ways they are trying to accomplish that is through economic influence. I mean this isn‚Äôt exactly some esoteric fact or well kept secret. It‚Äôs not even debatable. Feel free to google it and see articles on it going back years and years.
---
This is why they need to make anyone who works for the company play at least a little bit of all their games, or offer reference of someone else playing it, in case of stupid answers like this.

Are you just here on the hearthstone subreddit just to get mad at people on the hearthstone subreddit? That‚Äôs a bit sad man. You need to channel this energy somewhere a bit more productive

Look at op's hand and board. There's no Snipsnap. He just pretended to have it. It's literally the point of his post.
---
There's a difference between a company choosing a political issue to support versus allowing all competitors in their tournament broadcast to vocalize their own political beliefs on stream. I'm not defending Blizzard's actions, but I feel like that comparison misses the point.

Man, get it through that thick skull of yours that the rules apply the same in OWL concerning platforms. The infraction xQc broke and HOW he broke it were above and beyond the conduct Blitz did. Keep sidestepping that all you want, it doesn't take away from the fact. Not to mention the OWL CoC doesn't make mention of specific punishment for specific infractions so there's literally no use in pointing out the difference when he could have been (but wasn't) given the same punishment as Blitz. 
---
I'm not cherry picking, I don't even pay attention to Overwatch but that doesn't diminish the point or the facts of the matter. And I ***love*** that you just blatantly ignore the fact that EQO was banned from streaming by his **TEAM**. Not by Blizzard.
---
I browse /r/popular, and this showed up, and of course I'm going to call you shitbags out for being worthless piss drinkers.
---
So no: I didn't search the sub out specifically to talk shit; any other psych 101 bullshit you want to try, chief? 
---
&gt;You need to channel this energy somewhere a bit more productive
---
Like you? Supporting companies that support a dictatorship that tramples on human rights daily?
---
I was offered bright wing, Savannah highmane, and Harrison jones can anyone explain why this would be?
---
They chose to support China's censorship and make an example out of a player.
---
That is Blizzard taking a political action.

---
To be fair a lot of the pro-Hong Kong stuff is just as much bandwagoning. Shouldn't take Twitch chat as any kind of platform for social justice.
---
Doesn't mean anything. My brother eats a lot of s%$t. 
---
His medical exams are perfect (he does every year a full check), he is 27y 1.72m 64kg with 9% fat (he teaches karate and sometimes play football).
---
At lunch and dinner he only eats pasta or rice (a lot more pasta than rice) with meat... or fast food, no greenies or anything like that. On other meals he only eats, chips, chocolatte and cookies. 
---
I also have a cousin that eats more than 4k callories a day (he eats also a lot of s%$t but also eats healthy food like greenies, unlike my brother) he is 1.84m 70kg... but he is a lot less bulky than my brother and doesn't have abs (he also does more exercise than him, i think so since he is military).
---
Curiosly none of them drink coffee, alchool... the only drug is sugar.
---
I simply squelch every single opponent. But for those who I forget to mute and recieve a "amazing" I just respond with a wow when I win.
---
Here‚Äôs a much better question :
---
If a player came out and said ‚Äúsupport ISIS , 9/11 was a miracle, destroy the west‚Äù  on a Blizzard production, and Blizzard did act the same way, do you think this sub would have been outraged?
---
That was me. I said you'd never be shit but I guess you probed me wrong.. Kudos
---
Every token druid list on hsreplay with a big enough sample size to show up is above 50% winrate, so saying they only have one viable deck is just incorrect.
---
Good one dude
---
[deleted]
---
I wasn't complaining about the 1000 win reward dude. Not at all.
---
I was just pointing out that not everyone on this subreddit or on Reddit is an asshole and using generalizing language does actually reaffirm in some people's minds that it's okay to continue making those sorts of generalizations.
---
My rule of thumb is always DE gold legendary because of their net value. Plus, phaoris is good but not the most crucial leg, you can do without it and craft more crucial legs instead which will carry you further :)
---
It only removes one copy out of the many that you have
---
Of course the game is dying, why put cards to HoF only to add them later for a time event?
---
Because the game is dying, these cards are already playable and once again a slap in the face to the Wild community.
---
That's right, the event is only here because the game is boring and stale and the developers are headless chicken, oh and Nazi's that hate freedom of speech.
---
Hit enter twice
---
Seriously if their is any member of bloody blizzard not spending time on damage control on another issue, you would think someone who looks on reddit actually bothers to get this looked into and something posted saying they are aware of an issue and investigating.
---
But as we have seen numerous times, none of them clearly have the initiative to do something!
---
It's happening to me every day on mobile
---
Aye, Steamrolling's the goal of the Best Friends deck, too. Most bosses die within two turns to it, with an exception here or there.
---
So it shouldn't be offering Brightwing.
---
It is officially chinese territory.
---
Go find a job.
---
By punishing blitzchung they are taking an active role therefore they ARE doing the latter. I mean no corporation wants obstacles but blizzard is handling this obstacle awfully.
---
if i could i would but im underage and that im not allowed to work in my age, next year i can
---
Is Kun a spell? Just read a damn card...
---
Terrible advice. You need some cards to get going. If you don't have the dust to keep playing, you're missing out on huge amounts of dust. Plenty of cards are evidently useless, and dusting with the occasional false positive still gives you a huge net positive over not dusting.
---
It‚Äôs not like I care.
---
Again, if you fail to summarize your argument in 3-5 sentences - you have no argument. And honestly, saying that your argument is so long you won't even put it forward is the stupidest and laziest excuse I've ever heard.
---
There's no real downside. At worst, your fringe legendary will be less shiny.
---
Meh
---
You were using quest Druid. Once evolve rotates out after the event, the meta is probably gonna be dominated by Druid and people are gonna start complaining about the quest instead
---
Cool. How long did u try?

---
It‚Äôs simple, first you wait until you have both spirits of the dead, star aligner, embalming ritual and both Shadow word death, then you play thaurissian, next turn you play both spirits, aligner, give it reborn and death it twice, next turn you play bwonsamdi and draw 4 star aligners, then you win 100% no problems whatsoever

Probably the opponent conceded before he got he chance to play Atari.

According to the latest vS report, DR Rogue has a favorable matchup against Aggro Rogue and Murloc Shaman. Seems kinda counterintuitive but that's what they say: https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-144/
---
Damn that's rough, it happened to me too but at least the guy didn't go off on me. He was just salty that I beat him, said I was bming, and unfriended me. Strange stuff but I had just added the guy randomly so no great loss.
---
\&gt; Additionally, there's no easy way to fix this.
---
You pick Hagatha, you Duplaetc something else, done.
---
This happens very much. For example the League YouTuber PantsAreDragon used to be called PantsAreJizz.
---
And of course he‚Äôs not banned lol. Just shows that Blizzard agrees with everything the Chinese government is doing.
---
That is some unreal cherry picking and bending of truth
---
Yeah, I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one. I still remember when this happened to me, it was a while back and I offered someone the 80 g quest. I was priest against whatever he was playing, can't remember, and I ended up beating him pretty cleanly with some janky homebrew zoo priest I'd always enjoyed but was never really that good. (That's why I picked it too, I didn't wanna beat up on the guy with jade druid or something). 
---
After the game he said I had BMed him because apparently I had lethal on board and "didn't need to use a mindblast". It's not like I roped him or anything like that, I just chucked out the mindblasts cause the more cards you use the more exp you get so who cares, right? Apparently this salt factory did and he unfriended me before I could even explain. 
---
Screw 'em. It's no great loss.
---
But he‚Äôs at the top of the leaderboards lol.
---
Even if the account gets banned now, it‚Äôs only be because it caught on and not because Blizzard would genuinely want it banned under normal circumstances because they‚Äôre cowards
---
Singapore was British.
---
This can be interpreted two ways:
---
It's either like you say, a new Legendary OR it's just a random legendary that's already in existence and you'll be shown what you got when you are there.
---
I hope you're right though! Would be spicy to get another new card.
---
They are paid for Chinese bots
---
But it is one of the biggest value options, and you currently lack that.
---
Are you NA? If so what‚Äôs your Btag? I‚Äôll definitely add you. Nonsense decks and RNG decks are the most fun. That guy is a loser for getting salty like that especially after you did him a favor sharing your quest with him.
---
Hot damn the paid for bots by China are here and in full force boys.
---
Voodoo doctor WAS a good card when Heal Zoo was a top tier deck. Now that it doesn‚Äôt fit into any archetype it‚Äôs not a good card any more. 
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand my point- talking about whether a card is good ‚Äúin a vacuum‚Äù is just pointless masturbatory debate. There is never a ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù in Hearthstone. Cards have value in the meta or they aren‚Äôt good.

Hi all, hope your week went well.

The first 4 cards featured in this post were all entries to our ongoing 80k subscribers tournament, which you can [vote on right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/dk8ny4/80k_subscriber_battle_royale_3card_cycles_round_4/). This week's theme was cycles, so two cards were chosen from two cycles to show the mechanical parallels and differences.

Apologies for the late post and thanks for reading.

It is completely normal to have a extradition bill in one country, if you where in america, you can't hide from prosecution in any state. The guy raped his gf and fled to HK where he was able to hide from the law, why shouldn't he be accountable for those crimes? The state of the law in CHina is the same as literally anywhere else, wherever you live in your country, you can be arrested for crimes you did there and this is right AND just.
---
The salt flows through this one, clouds his mind and heart. Forgive him, pray for his soul and move on.
---
There will be plenty of people who are willing to stay friendly in an 80gold quest match.
---
dis some 2012 creppypasta shit right here
---
Well, it's a reward for "competition" and grind. You aren't losing anything from playing in casual mode(except some bits of gold), so it's different from ranked(after rank floors - not really) and arena.
---
That doesn't answer my question. Why don't they make the western ppl foxes or something? This difference in treatment is important bc it further cements the subconscious notion in the west that Asians are somehow "different" and "exotic creatures" than the basic human being, which is apparently white ppl (even though there exists more Asians in this world than white ppl).
---
It is consistent with the years of dehumanization of Asians, which is why did many non Asians are so casually racist towards Asians and get pissed when Asians call it out, bc they expect Asians to just take it.
---
Cool!
---
Kin0531 from Hong Kong in Final on  Master Tour Bucharest
---
So they probably changed "FreeHK" to that then. Wouldn't surprise me.
---
They're both really good. I really don't see what point you're trying to make here
---
Also r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Oh you‚Äôre right, I just checked the post I was thinking about and the card was actually ‚ÄúThe Mistcaller‚Äù
---
One of Meteos' alts was named "LongDong" and that got changed to ShortDog
---
Do they not see that there are class trials lol.
---
This has happened to me several times over the years so now I save my 80G quests for one person that I know will just play for fun and wont get mad no matter the outcome.
---
*arena
---
I think that this is the first "I'm quitting HS" post that didn't make me roll my eyes. It sounds like this is a genuinely healthy choice for you to be making and I respect your maturity in realizing that. Good luck.
---
What law? Show me, please :)
---
Most other buffs will let you attack right away. What's better, 4 mana +4/4 that you can use to trade or go face the same turn, or an extra +4/4 for 2 mana but you can't use the minion to close out the game or trade?
---
I guess it might be ok with fatigue warrior or some super slow deck that runs taunts, but then BGH just comes back into the meta if this card is every a thing.
---
No, this requires your brain to think, so it's better
---
Not even remotely surprised to see the Shaman in the background, lol. 
---
Congrats though! First time always feels good, even with the easy decks.
---
the drawback is barely a drawback, if you consider just playing a minion and then block out the sun on it.
---
Too yiffy for  me we know what u really like to draw pervert!
---
there's a lot of things to hate blizzard for but their support isn't one of them
---
You just gotta cheese the boss cheese
---
You know Jakie Chan is not the only person that has (or is allowed to use) that name?
---
Also, Jakie chan is against the HK protests anyway.
---
Why the fuck you blame the HS player Jakie for not being a "hero"? Why must this guy, that only wants to do a living and play his favourite game, be a "hero"? Does simply not playing hearthstone actually make you a hero, anyway?
---
It's pretty mediocre; it's big, dumb stats. While that may be strong sometimes, that's usually in a midrange arena-like environment. Warrior has never supported such an archetype, so this card would never see play.
---
At this point, Trolden should just remove the word "funny" from their video title and shove it into evolve shaman asses instead.
---
Let me rephrase the question; do you think blizzard should assist China in suppression of democratic rights?
---
I'm sorry, I don't play wow.
---
To be fair, blessing of kings is below the vanilla curve, while this is above it.
---
Definitely warlock. Blasted my way to rank 5 from rank 20 (started playing wild recently). It struggles a bit at rank 5+, but i am not a legend guy so that's not a big issue for me. Although I'm sure mechathun warlock is a legendy viable deck with enough time spent on it. Tempostorm lists is as tier 2 Wild deck, so no doubt it's good.
---
I have the 80g quest and i am from Eu , if you want we can Play a fun game:)
---
If everyone deserves a voice and say, China doesn't get to use that voice and say to eliminate others voice and say. My freedom of speech does not include the right to stop you from having said freedom because I don't like what you're saying. Also I do not believe that Blizzard would even ban a pro-china speaker in the first place. China does not have the right to use their economic power to infringe upon the rights and freedoms of people outside their country and yet they continue to do so and we continue to let them.
---
No, it has to do with Hong Kong and not the actual game being played, and this spam behavior just ends up spreading everywhere.
---
If blizzard doesn't stop the spam that they had a part in, then it's going to flood over to other games and ruin the chat there.
---
At this stage it's already got enough publicity, spamming free Hong Kong does nothing but annoy people or in worse cases force them into difficult situation.
---
[Iksar on this subject back in February](https://youtu.be/a6N1iFiHZnY?t=884)
---
&gt;Shamans have been one of the most challenging classes in terms of class identity [...] The idea of the shaman is like "hey we're the jack-of-all-trades. We do a little bit of meele, we do a little bit of magic, we do a little bit of healing, we kinda do everything."
---
&gt; This is cool thematically but for a card game it's hard when a class's identity is it just does everyting [...] So we've been talking a lot about what is shaman not supposed to be good at? That's a challenging question [...] and one of the answer we've landed on for the short term is they shouldn't generate a ton of resources [...]
---
&gt; But even that is not thematically super strong so we're still kinda figuring out what shamans are supposed to be good at and what are they supposed to be bad at.
---
*Well met! We are monitoring it. We are planning to glue it with the new standard year rotation.*
---
Thank you so much for posting this. I watched this live and lost my shit. Between the awkward walking off camera interaction and the trophy breaking .... pure gold
---
My friend is also interested in your art ....do you have more stuff on your profile on deviant?
---
Same man, same :')
---
I heard recently that Zilliax is in around 60%(!) of decks. Definitely craft him first
---
I am not satisfied with the points people provide. It always boils down to China bad because South Park told me about it.
---
In fact, this doesn't really have much to do with China, at least not as much people think. Very simply, Blitzchung said a political statement without prior approval that was offensive to the current government whether you believe in free speech in your country or not. He knew he was going to get punished and Blizzard punished him for it. It isn't Blizzard's job to tell other countries what they should or shouldn't be doing. That is the job of the leadership of countries around the world if they choose to get involved in another country's affairs. 
---
Blizzard is being unfairly thrown under the bus because of Blitzchung's timing right after the South Park episode and that is pretty much it.
---
Hearthstone has literally fallen
---
Emoting is fun and has no spam limit like it does in matchmaking so I always spam them in friendlies.  It's similar to how someone might shit talk a friend, but never someone they aren't familiar with.
---
/r/LivestreamFail
---
Now we need an edit where the trophy is labeled "Blizzard's core values" and the piece that falls off is labeled "Every voice matters".
---
I don‚Äôt see it staying on the board for it to be an anti-fatigue tool
---
Looking quickly at the stats for secret Highlander, subject 9 will definitely help your winrate with the deck more so than Zilliax. Perhaps give it a go!
---

No Scotland is British because it is, always has been, and always will be on the island of Great Britain, same as Texas being on the continent of North America making it American. Geographical location is not the same as where political borders are drawn, there is a very big distinction between HK and those examples.
---
During RoS, I had some fun playing a Star Aligner Plot Twist Warlock.  
---
You can hit mechanical whelp deathrattles using Dorian and Beltrug for 7/7s.  Beltrug will often complete the combo with his copied minions on board, and one aligner in hand.  I also threw in some rabble bouncers, since they discount themselves and can complete the combo too.  
---
I had a couple games where i fired the combo off twice in the same game using plot twist antics.  It's probably better now with the quest.
---
Yes
---
Hong Kongers don't call it "the principle" or - bullshit, and only their opinion matters.
---
I think thats what happens when the boss only has 1 playable card in his hand
---
1. Savannah Highmane is not a 11/10. It's a 6/5 with a deathrattle. A 11/10 would see play in any deck that wanted to hit 6 mana crystals. 
---
2. Savannah Highmane is still a very strong card. It just doesn't fit what that Hunter deck needs right now. Highlander hunter already beats slow decks, so it's shifting towards cheaper cards to be better against its main weakness - fast decks.
---
I'm pretty sure proper etiquette is the losing team initiates the gg and/or handshake and the winning team reciprocates. On the other hand this was a casual game and it literally doesn't matter.
---
I'm actually sorry

Blitzchungs Curse
---
Vitorsly#21852 EU trading 80g quest, you first
---
&gt;I'm arguing that the portraits should not be "ranked rewards" because winning in Ranked is just as easy as winning in Casual
---
&gt;The mode is a preference. Do you want to play for fun or do you want to play meta netdecks against meta netdecks.
---
&gt;
---
You contradicted yourself. If you haven't understood that winning in each isn't the same difficulty. The general mentality of the players is different.
---
Agreed.  If you're playing around Twisting Nether, you may not play certain cards until your opponent plays both of them.  Once you see them both played, you can go "ah ha!  Now I can play this card without fear!"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you see your opponent play both Ruby Elementals, you're not suddenly going to go "ah ha!  NOW I can finally float 6 mana!"
---
Buddy. It's a joke, not a dick so don't take it so hard
---
Years of virtue signaling, a pr team that consists of headless chickens, layoffs after most lucrative year, microtransaction abuse, devaluing freedom, suppressing free speech, and worst of all they dont make good games anymore. 
---
But nah, the soulless husk of a company is aight.
---
You know that druid spell card where u give minion +1/+1 and you gain armor equal to the minion¬¥s attack?
---
Well, that minion on picture, the minion doubles your spell if you target the minion on picture and puts it on your hand.
---
Combining with minion that lowers all spell cost by 1 while on board and you have infinity combo.
---
What OP said is that he went as far with putting same spell on minion that is passed the integral flow and because of that, it made HP and attack of minion into negative value.
---
Damn poor of you, it seems this happened to you a lot of times.
---
Ok. I read so much negativity on these subreddits it's hard to notice anymore. I just wish people that don't enjoy certain games would leave the community or have constructive criticism to improve the games. My bad. No hostility here
---
-uses  political bandwagon to reinforce personal popularity
---
[removed]
---
No, I'm suggesting that paying and winning are not related. By definition.

Yeah, it seems like you could slap Rush on them instead and they'd be extremely balanced. Making them attack something random makes them next to unplayable by comparison. Attacking something random on summon is an interesting effect, but in place of Rush, it should be more of a penalty for getting a better-statted minion, or be on something cheap with some kind of crazy effect, like Poisonous.

If you want to have a good Secret Highlander Hunter deck, you need Subject 9 because it's your best card draw. Subject 9 makes your following draws/top deck much better. It's a card you can keep in your mulligan (depending what you're facing) even though it's 5 mana.

If you only have Snip-Snap you might want to drop Ursatron.

Edit: Otherwise, you could also play the non-secret variant: https://hsreplay.net/decks/zR0ZITkt6tbRzdsTzc3cvg/
