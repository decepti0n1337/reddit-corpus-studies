You *do* get nine Classic packs from the Return of the Hero quests (unless they changed that), and there are the guaranteed legendaries within the first ten packs of each set you missed.

---
They've also being offering bundles of older but still Standard sets the last couple years on top of new bundles here and there.

Glinda is sick in Wild Even Wisplock. She's a cool card in general.  
---
Try doing things with her and summoning portal for some cool swings.

---
and this is different than Darkness how?
---
someone beat some sense into me because I think this is fairly easily done. With copying minions, putting copies of minions into your deck and the such, This has more potential than the BAncient One
---
29th to 31st is best guess.  Usually at least 5 days and early in the week Mon-Wed.
---
Til you face the ultra cheap Exodia deck that gets you before you power up.
---
The echo stays if Glinda dies so you only need one cultist.
---
Yes, orally.
---
You can't, you wouldn't have enough space in your hand for any other cards. Unless I'm miscounting
---
Yes but different strokes for different folks.  It would probably go better with Priest but this is one of the new archetype themes that has stuck (Deathrattle never really has)

Uncraftable cards cant be summoned like that
---
Going down the list for those unfamiliar with it;
---
Lanipator did YuYuHakusho (the abridged movie was pretty great)
---
MasakoX &amp; Vegeta 3986 tackled early Naruto
---
Hbi2k abridged (and finished!) Berserk, Gantz, and Escaflowne
---
and Antfish did the old adaptation of Part 3 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It was outstanding.
---
Wish there was one initial sweeping laser on the minions (if any). Then a focused shot on the hero.
---
Is amazing but was kinda derpy... like it took the minion summon order into account.
---
Riftcleaver is literally Azari, but with colorful arms.
---
Stating facts about your attitude and personality is just being factual.  This isn't /r/politics - no need to get your millennial knickers in a twist. :)    
---
Now where exactly does it clearly and obviously state Conjurer's calling cannot summon a non-collectible minion?  I mean it must be blatantly obvious right? You should have no trouble providing this obvious source.
---
&gt;These cults also have agents that monitor social media that pages then when certain keywords are posted. Then they appear and attack the poster with all kinds of insults.
---
So if I attack this post are you assuming that I am said anti-occult government agent and not just a random Redditor laughing at you?  how do I know that you aren't a government agent planting a false flag to misdirect us from the aliens training us to fight to the death in MOBA's?
---
I don't think it does. Warlock self destruction cards like Ratcatcher and Voidterror gain double stats with doubled battlecries.
---
Are you sure? OP said his chance of winning going second is 20-25% but said nothing about chance of winning going first.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What if OP only wins 30-35% of the time going first?
---
Meta is meta.  
---
You don't have to do it, you can play any deck you like.  Maybe you'll make a meta breaker of your own.  
---
Otherwise don't complain about not being able to lift your win rate.
---
Noooooo ),:
---
Well which one is Kowalski?
---
You don't get to define what is a 'cheat' in this game.
---
You can craft the Darkness. You can't craft this card.
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/48146/dr-boom-mad-genius#tab=recommended-decks  
---
SHOULD show you all decks with that card in it but it's broken and only lists 1 page.  I'd posted on the sub for hsreplay but got no answer as to why it behaves this way.  
---
It would make answering your question easier if it worked correctly.
---
This is why prep raiding party was the part of rogue they nerfed 🤔 otherwise this would be a nasty combo
---
As an alien I can confirm this.
---
PS: Please don't come to area 51. Leave us alone.
---
Thanks for clearing that up
---
But Mogu Cultist is a battlecry, you have to play the 7th one
---
Are you really calling playing meta decks and using deck trackers cheating?
---
I still like Azari the Devourer's best
---
Can’t druid really easily trigger The mogu cultists. Draw 2 of them then Elise and floop. That doesn’t even require that much set up.
---
I definitely hope you're right. I just feel like older sets, like Kobolds or Frozen Throne or Old Gods, have generally been more cohesive, thematically, and had higher art quality, than what we've been shown so far. But as you say, the majority of the set is still not revealed, so hopefully things'll improve as we get closer to completion.
---
All a deck tracker does is present information to you that is already available in a more efficient manner. It doesn't make any decisions for you. So I'm not quite sure how you arrived at the conclusion that that is cheating. 
---
As to your complaint regarding access to the card pool - welcome to card-based games. If you don't like it, then this genre probably isn't for you.
---
tAunT iS chEaT
---
_I am Mal'Ganis!!  I am a Turtle!!_
---
This sounds cool in concept but the fact that you can only have one legendary in the deck probably makes this strategy suck (ignoring future reveals lol)
---
I really like that they’re printing cards for combo decks again. Also this one doesn’t have a single tech counter that would destroy it outright but is also gonna be decently hard to pull off
---
It’s Pack Filler, but at least it’s decent with the Rogue Legendary and serves a purpose. We’re leagues away from vanilla 10/10’s and 5/6’s.
---
So this is what happens when I turn my dust into a card. Neat.
---
Rawrmageddon! XD
---
No it won't, it casts a copy
---
How does some Obelisk that there appears to be at least three of represent a god?
---
This might be good one day. Looking forward to totem Shaman. I really hope this archtype becomes more about totems buffing the player though, making your totems huge doesn't make much thematical sense to me.
---
DMH Warrior specifically wants a game to go to fatigue, whereas shuffle warrior only has a fatigue advantage.
---
yep
---
Or Bomb Warrior was always intended as a counter to Singleton decks...
---
who's Felicia?
---
Nice.
---
You went from "on average" to "specific type of deck".
---
Could even do it with one cultist if you duplicate Floop too. Elise doubles your first cultist giving you two cultists and two Floops. First Floop puts you up to four cultists. Second Floop puts you up to eight. Takes an extra turn with the second Floop but requires one less cultist draw.
---
Hold on, thats a penis!
---
Or even [[Kabal Lackey]]
---
Does a third Floop floop into a third Elise, or will the third Floop floop into a vanilla Floop?
---

5/4/4 | Deathrattle: Give a random friendly minion +3/+3.  
---
Cool reveal, I dont think this will see play, except in maybe some experimentation in Luna's /CC deck. Too understated and too high cost for a delayed conditional effect.
---
Luna's could be interesting to reduce to 1 then CC it to hit the buffs. But its still meh at best, cause you'll probably CC the other minions in your hand and lose the buff
---
Reduce the cost to 7-mana and maybe this finds play somewhere.
---
You beat 11 bosses? This shows us only that. Unless it's a card combo.
---
[removed]
---
This just in, games using Egyptian inspiration have similar Egyptian themes.
---
That’s so true because Elise floop can theoretically go infinite
---
Supersized rogue run only 6+ minions draw Anka with Witchwood Piper /s
---
Just need to make sure you don't have anything else in your hand otherwise you run into hand size issues.
---
If Plot Twist Warlock gets more support then this will definitely make the cut as a good target for the Warlock Quest Hero Power and a good minion to summon from Dorian and Betrug.
---
Why wouldn’t he attack with Jepetto Joybuz, then mutate him before committing to the bloodlust?
---
Thanks for the explanation. I am f2p too!
---
Yeah that works
---
Except Drakari is in wild now
---
But you can only have one 1 cost... Because of Elise
---
You're not gonna lose to Bomb Warrior in Wild, I assure you
---
Could be an interesting pull from Myra.  Getting this effect on the board turn 5 sounds nice.
---
By that logic Ysera is pack filler because it's 9 mana no immediate effect
---
To be honest, I would say this is packfiller too if it weren't for the fact that there's clearly designed synergies for this. With the Rogue new Legendary and Warlock getting Plot Twist support (Betrug and Dollmaster cheating out the handbuffs) this card will at least be considered by players who want to see big stuff.
---
That song works so much better in my head, thanks for getting that stuck in mine now.
---
Is this the first female mogu made?
---
Actually just 3 cards on t7. Glinda survives t6, cultists x6 grim rally, and 7th cultists
---
Then you are lost!
---
Just gotta keep your handsize small. The bigger problem is having an empty board the turn after.  If the opponent knows what you’re doing then its a bit hard to pull off
---
Prismatic lens too.
---
Originally dismissed this as a bad card, but there may be something to cheating it out or triggering the deathrattle.
---
Plot twist makes the most sense to me. Hireek, Omega Agents, Jeklik all benefit. Not sure if there’s a deck there, but there’s lots of synergy.
---
Also would not be surprised if there’s an eventual Priest deck that runs it, though what that looks like is much less clear.
---
Thanks man ;) I’ll keep that in mind
---
I will try...thank you ^^
---
Let me get this straight, at 10 mana you fill the board with seven of these. The board condenses to one minion (the 20/20). Then you can play [[Drakkari Enchanter]] with your left over 3 mana. That’s 40 damage to all enemy minions at the the of the turn. I’m ready for wild bois
---
That’s a useful insight thank you. It’s true that I didn’t spend that much of hours on it and I haven’t seen one single video...
---
30 with the ping
---
I’ll match your $50. Dead ass serious.
---
Bomb warrior will likely survive the expansion, especially given that it hard counters highlander decks, but I would wait 4 weeks before crafting anything
---
"How can dis be!?"
---
Okay most have said to wait so i probably will! Thanks!
---
Oh dont forget about Glinda bud. It's not as janky and inconsistent as you think.
---
Lightning bolt has overload one, call it a darkbomb or a wrath for 2
---
Deadly shot incoming...
---
Because then he wouldn’t have gotten the extra three damage from the bloodlust on Jepetto’s attack (and wouldn’t have had lethal).
---
the rng gods won't reward you if you show suck lack of confidence
---
3 mana 1/3 Taunt Deathrattle: restore 1 health to all friendly characters Reborn. Still pretty shit.
---
As a paladin main player I couldn't disagree more with you.  Murlocs are great and perfectly fit the class identity wether you like it or not. Now seriously if you didn't play mech, holy wrath or duel decks those past months I think you just don't know what you're talking about.
---
Well you know
---
Anyfin can happen
---
please update me on how this goes lmao. i have a run out rn with 4 dalaran crusaders
---
Are Anubisath just doomed to be "unplayably slow, neutral minions that buff things when they die"? 
---
Decent big boy in arena
---
Attack -&gt; Mutate -&gt; Bloodlust. End result is the same, Krush would just have had 11 attack.
---
Yeah I just realized that as well. I’m an idiot.
---
Everyone thinks this will be the meme video deck of Uldum but the real meme is going to be conceding right before the enemy’s 7th cultist and never letting them see this.
---
Bomb Warrior in Wild 😂
---
It'd be fun to see a Pogo rogue vs a a Cultist Rogue.
---
Metagame will never let this combo live in standart, for example mage will win every game.
---
Good point, I'm not sure tho. On Android there is official HSR app called Arcane Tracker, not sure about iOS.
---
Compare Whirlkick master to Underbelly angler 
---
Both cards are two drops that generate a specific type of card when you play that type, allowing you to potentially go infinite
---
However 
---
Underbelly angler is a full +1/+1 better, every card it generates is a minion, and there are much more cards that trigger the effect in an underbelly angler deck 
---
Now a card can afford to be a lot worse than angler and still be good, however this just seems bad in all the places angler is good
---
Well, if what you want is tempo, you won't play a 2 mana 1-2;
---
This isn't a tempo card, it's value generating card. You play it if you want to generate value more than maintaining tempo.
---

---
2/2/3 Elemental | Your spells cost (1) less.  
---
RIGGED!
---
actually, it has to be arena.
---
What I like about this is that it doesn't have to be these exact cards
---
You could also get the required amount with double elekk or double plot twist
---
You can't have a way to summon Ra with any way possible other than the Cultist way. It is noncollectable.
---
Spend money-get better RNG. Secret HS hack. When you win at anything it makes you want to play more. When people spend money they get high rolls like crazy. I am f2p and I have to play around bad RNG just to hit dad legend each month. Every boss fight I get bad draws and the most insane RNG outcomes. MCT grabs the 7/7 off of a full board. My missiles go face, face, face. This is just my personal theory. But my p2w friends shoot to rank 5 on day one each month and hit legend occasionally. A lot of them are not good and I regularly beat them in friendly matches.
---
Ra prolly would have shot his wad at least once at that point...
---
Probably not draftable.
---
*of course it is*
---
Do you have a link to the deck/post?
---
Ranked mode used to make me feel anxious, so I would always practice a new deck in Casual. Winning against bad decks piloted by inexperienced players is no way to improve. Quitting this habit made me a much better player, and I exclusively play ranked mode now. Made first-time legend a few months after making the switch.
---
Early days I'd watch streamers, especially Legend players as it helped me understand decisions during games. After a point, you kind of just understand a deck the moment you see it as any TCG.
---
At that point, it's not just understanding your deck, but understanding the meta so you know how to play it properly against each match-up.
---
And all it took was a single Epic. Usually it takes a therapist for that.
---
I wouldn't pay more that 10$
---
So with that logic, WoW is crazy despite the monthly cost remaining the same for years?
---
Self damage warlock won't be viable without healing as well.
---
Van cleef is already mentioned.
---
I really like Nethersoul Buster, Diseased Vulture, Crystologist, Spirit Bomb, Flame Imp package. If there are good heal cards, Self Harm Zoo might be good.
---
This is the new card we're all gonna get salty about in Arena 100%.
---
Hozen was nuts this is double nuts for half the cost.
---
If Arena ends of being really minion-combat heavy this is going to be like, THE BEST card for value.
---
It's also like, okay in constructed. Great in Heal Druid to heal your 3/20 bear.
---
Probably with enough drawback that it won't see any play.
---
Crystallizer\*
---
True but you need to only have the floop elise and cultists in hand or you will overfill your hand with the gloop sprayer
---
Something like that. They keep trying to push value rogue, maybe (as they plan multiple expansions together) they'll release the 1 big value rogue card that will make all these cards viable. We'll see!
---
This card is a straight upgrade on Hozen Healer. Will be an insane arena card for sure. Hard to call if it will be constructed viable. But keep in mind Reborn minions can be healed back to full health so there’s some potential synergy there.
---
Good observation. Players will definitely want to silence this one.
---
Very happy they're printing strong but not snowbally 2 drops for arena. It's very important to have strong curve cards like these in the pool
---
Heal Paladin?
---
"But that all changed when the Bomb Warrior attacked. Only the Rogue mastered all four archetypes, Aggro, Combo, Control and Mill. Only she could stop the ruthless bombshufflers. But when the world needed her most, she vanished."
---
Unlicensed Apothecary. 'Nough said.
---
Arena card for sure !
---
Nobody mentioned reborn synergy yet, hopefully we will see some more (with high health) soon.
---
It's a way better Dynomatic in effect (how much damage is being dealt) but Dynomatic is by far the better card - discoverable, 2 of them, don't need to limit deck.
---
Of course they are both serving a different purpose, but Dynomatic will see 1000% more play than New Reno
---
If you play enough to justify paying $30 a month for it, you can get all the meta decks each expansion for at most $80 plus gold, possibly the $50 pre-order. Why would you want to spend more to get the filler cards too?
---
I was all "How does he keep doing stuff like this"?  And now it all makes sense somehow.
---
Warlock desperately needs a good heal card otherwise I don’t see how any self-harm minions will be competitive. And this minion isn’t that great anyways.
---
Again a wild card... And it's Even !
---
It's cool to have different themes during the expac rather than everyone playing a singleton deck
---
Lackeys and singleton and quests is great variety
---
I read this and I was like, "This is Vex Crow this is bad".
---
But 3 is not equal to 2 and 3/5 in stats are okay. Turning your hero power into 2 Mana Summon a Random 3 Drop and Draw a card is crazy. People are thinking too big when they're trying to build a self-hurt Warlock. Just use your hero power and Flame Imp and this card is nuts.
---
They won't print this in a set where Highlander cards exist..... Right? They won't right??..
---
How would it survive walking the plank?
---
how is it possible to set up such a board ?
---
if you have 6 mogu cultists in hand and you are waiting for the seventh, you have almost no control on the board
---
it's an insane condition for a card that is not an auto win...
---
This expansion is turning out to have very interesting cards, i might get this expansion.
---
Snip Snap isn’t terrible. Overall there are a lot of weak legendaries.
---
Mainstay in Heal Druid
---
So there are baron rivendare and zombie chows in wild, huh.  
---
Interesting.
---
But this is rng squared not only rng
---
I hope so. Priest needs more possible win conditions but this one does seem a bit hard to pull off. Other classes can do it easier.
---
With this card revealed we can finally say that Taunt Warrior is looking promising. If we get some cool new Taunts as well, the deck will certainly see some play and this card twice in every such deck
---
You can jepetto Glinda....if it fails, plot twist and try again
---
She is holding the swords the wrong way :( Why have the edge towards yourself
---
I think in wild Drakkari Enchanter is even better.
---
goodest chuckle was had
---
I guess you could play both for more consistency
---
Well it is like you say Reno deck are weak because you may not draw Reno or Kazakus. 
---
The payoff is you have twice the chance to draw this card than keleseth and you can have 2 mana cards
---
And you still have your removal , weapon and AOE of CW so a few weak taunt on board doesnt matter much
---
Not enough room for Drakkari
---
But i will still try it for fun
---
r/thatHappened
---
Hence the helpless hatchling
---
Particularly good in area I think.
---
*waits to be corrected by Krip*
---
Arena is *always* minion-combat heavy.
---
It's like arguing with a soup strainer.
---
Looking forward to playing some emolock.
---
Great in arena but I don't think it will see any play outside of arena except for decks that have strong heal synergy.
---
are u not buying packs? im
---
going for 250
---
Can you see that [[Silverback Patriarch]]? It indicates that it'll be back in meta
---
In general, I recommend crafting decks for which you have opened some good legendaries/epics. As for the best budget deck - I'm really not sure, I haven't been a budget player for a while and I mostly play wild. You will need to google some guides for that, I'm sure you can find a lot about budget decks for the current expansion online (wild or standard).

3/1/4 Beast | Taunt  
---
I will never ever understand why paladins became a "murloc" class. Like wtf blizzard sure print 1 or 2 as a novelty, but wtf are there soooooo many paladin murlocs. Mage warrior priest and hunter could also have random class murlocs too.
---
I wouldnt even be mad at this point. It wouldn't see play in bomb mech due to wanting boom hero power and lack of taunts, and it could actually beat that deck with burn damage. It'd bw kind of unhealthy that the deck that checks warrior is another warrior, but i'm down for anything at this point.

that's because it's an hunter card, dont worry. the hate i mean
---
Look I wouldn't mind that either. It's both more viewers and a 12-0 run. It seems to me as a win-win
---
Does it work off redstone
---
Sure it’s “good enough” in the worst cases, but is even it’s best case worth running this card in a deck? It’s just a slow pile of stats.
---
Why dont we get cool Control-log cards, they should reveal the plague, and it should be a pusher board clear
---
So it looks like most of the cards haven't been implemented yet?

And I thought we would leave infinitie value behind us with them Deathknights.

y name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

How is this or Corruption even remotely the same card?

3/4/3 | Your Secrets trigger twice.

For the quest maybe, but for this card you wouldn't want to pay 3 extra mana to cast magic trick

This is not actually too far fetched. One version of OTK Paladin ran Shirvallah, Banker, Holy Wrath, Elven Archer with pre-equipped Truesilver for exact 30 damage.

This is a perfect example when the tank has had enough of his party members bull shif and decides to let them tank.
---
You can also Kobold Lackey face, maybe run Spirit Bomb if the self-harm package is good enough, which can also kill your Eggs and help with Mountain Giants, not ideal but a maybe..
---
The only problem is consistently drawing your Vulture
---
I have always had a stupid question with taking damage cards with Warlock. Why does using hero power not count as taking damage? The spell stone cards never got upgraded when you used your hero power, so I would assume this card wouldn't work with it either?

I actually agree with this. I normally try to be positive about HS but the class identity shit they released was the worst thing I’ve seen Blizz do.

The dragon thing: spot on.

I don’t mind classes having lots of different flavours but paladin is truly all over the place and goes exactly against their class identity press release.

Well that video sure was an experience I did not think I would ever have.

There's a chance that it'll kill Khadgar instead

Did someone say [[Bolster?]]
---
I know! That was incredible. Shout outs to Zalae Bae!
---
Definitely not portuguese.

Bomb warrior is strong and cheap, so is token Druid

I got the 12th, most consistent deck i ever drafted
---
The loss was an unfortunate disconnect
---
Name roughly translates to "Nervous Retainer".
---
Taunt  Battlecry:  Discover a Taunt minion.
---
Isn't this just a better Stonehill?
---
Arguable since Stonehill would sometimes tank 2 hits which is nice for a Taunt minion to do, but I feel like the Discover effect was most of why the minion was good, and it's now 1 mana cheaper.
---
Both your usernames are anagrams of each other

[Me discovering Armaghedillo](https://gfycat.com/lastfirstkoala) every single time.

2 Mana 2/3 with an Battlecry upside that effects your board. I was wrong about Potion Vendor being good, so I might suck at evaluating healing cards, but this one has good vanilla stats to drop this one two and is more likely to heal for an impactful amount of health. Good in combination with self damaging cards, with heal synergy, high health and/or reborn minions, so maybe something for either Priest, Paladin, Druid or Warrior.
---
It fizzles. This happens a lot with Yogg for example.
---
But what I want to know is, where's the caveman?
---
It cutves out too
---
Maybe a 4/20.
---
OUT OF MY DESERT !
---
Murlocks, midrange hunter, mech hunter and token druid are the cheapest decks
---
If you donate enough animal furs for your fellow campers. Howdy!
---
it would, in this case. I think you are referring to the spellstone, which specifically asked for your CARDS to deal damage to your hero.
---
Alternatively, [[Lightforged Blessing]].
---
it doesnt take long to translate anyway idiot
---
Based on the darker yellow, im gonna guess Paladin? Though probably neutral
---
If you just started I suggest you work on fewer decks. If you spread yourself too thin you end up with plenty of gimped decks rather than a single good one. The sad truth is if you don't spend money you get about 1 deck per expansion if you play a bunch.
---
also good for rogue combos since combos are so important now

2/-/- | Twinspell Give a friendly minion Lifesteal.

Zoinks, Scoob!
---
But this stick makes more likely to play the spell when you need it since you don't need to era a it but suffice drawing the tortoise

i'm assuming the scarabs are 1 mana beasts, yeah?

could see some use in hunter if they are
---
STONEHILL IS BACK
---
I know, it was a theoretical "if you want". I answered. I will pay 180 a year and you can pay 360
---
Yooooo I found the one other person trying to make this work. I always believed the lynchpin of that deck was emerald reaver xD beast? Check. Self harm, check. Can get lethal in extreme fringe cases? Check.

OUT OF MY JUNGLE
---
That would be a nice preview of the card before crafting
---
Speaking specifically for mech priest, i know if you dont draw some sort of card draw early on you are bassically playing as an aggro deck, you have to throw your eggs in one basket and hope you draw a circle of healing/cleric just to keep your hand size decent.
---
Im really hoping for some sort of card draw spell for priest instead of the cleric/acolyte/pyro shenanigans. Having to run 6 cards just to get some draw is really limiting to deck building.
---
I think something along the lines of 3 mana draw 2 minions from your deck, or draw 3 minions make them cost 1 more. (Minions only so that inner fire isnt too consistent). Not sure about the balancing of this but it would surely alwoy priest to get some decent archtypes going
---
Shaggy from Scooby doo??
---
You must place your fate into the hands of hearthstone’s lord and savior RNGesus, random be thy name. Wavering and making correct plays simply displays your weak heart and lack of faith. You will surely be judged harshly and randomly our crackling overlords.
---
It will see a lot of play because people will overpick this card like crazy thinking that it's good. It's not.
---
God why!@!! Deadly shot, hunters mark, 2 mechs with poison, 2 mechs that destroy random minions, just let me play my moutin giants in peace!!!
---
Are you talking about arena or constructed???
---
Great
---
around rank 10 in wild
---
With flamestrise this is like shadow visions plus a huge minion - basically a free flamestrike. Almost certainly going to get nerfed IMO. 7 mana reduction is better than double preparation
---
SHAGGY!
---
This is really good, but I am starting to get worried about warrior a bit..
---
We have already experienced quest warrior before and it was one of the most boring and infuriating decks...
---
And... I don't like when warrior has the best control, and then you add "oh you can also just build a wall".
---
Aggro might be dead, and that is not always a good thing. There needs to be balance.
---
Poisonous to heroes
---
I can’t wait for the new Mage Secret “Enchanting Table”
---
In a meta where your opponent doesn't need to play around it because the combo doesn't even exist yet.
---
Rankstar. The deck was not enough played to appear on the other 2 (tempostorm is to old and VS doesn't have enough data)
---
But I mean, just try to play it and you will see for yourself
---
Flame strike, blizzard
---
The cursor triggers me
---
Not to mention this has better stats for its cost and can often heal your 1/3, like Northshire(this is dirty) and put you super far ahead on board early on...
---
Great card, would draft anyday
---
100% read this as pleasure plate and was very confused and let down.
---
This slots in a possible handbuff warrior really nicely maybe just a 1 of because the 2/3 statline for 3 is really weak, maybe the tokens can be appreciated by token druid/shaman
---
Some not-so-subtle Taunt Warrior support, I like it
---
“G-get out of my...j-jungle!”
---
Cool arena card if nothing else. It's like a more defensive Bronze Herald
---
Very strong battlecry and acceptable stats for a 2 drop. Another excellent addition to the warriors taunt archetype.
---
GO. AWAY.
---
Or you can copy a soulwarden, which is a lot more reasonable in a deck that probably doesn't even run 7+ cost cards.
---
Gold armor? Foolish Steve
---
Yes Warlock
---
I doubt so. They said from now on generating value is one of warrior limiting now
---
“Out of my desert!”
---
This is worse vs. Nerubar Weblord as well
---
won't that kill you?
---
Are you sure? Entomb/Scream doesn't do that does it?
---
I think my favourite deck used to be odd paladin with king leon but I dusted baku and would need to get him again 
---
Got a pretty decent mech hunter in standard 
---
But my favourite used to be big paladin with freed from amber
---
Yeah, I'm just talking about from a standpoint of what's possible and what isn't. Obviously there is very little reason to play both Warrior quests in the same deck other than maybe trying to make it into a Trolden video.
---
He's pushing up the daisies! He's gone to meet his maker!
---
And Burly or Oondosa would also be valuable with that board, so a 3 in 14 chance of getting something that impacts the board
---
He killed the white one. That's why the white one's not in the Tip the Scales art.
---
Raggy?
---
Neither looked like Priest. When are we getting some priest cards?
---
Handcuff/Mech paladin is tier 1
---
I wish pulling off the ancients combo was more viable. Love meat generation that’s more complex than just board flood.
---
I think you're misunderstanding what that term means here.
---
Step 1: Thaurissan tick.
---
Step 2: If board empty, play a kobold librarian or something. Otherwise skip this step.
---
Step 3: Unlicensed + Vulture combo. Since you were at 30hp beforehand, you now should have 3 hp left.
---
Step 4: Grim Rally the librarian.
---
Step 5: Reno
---
Step 6: Opponent concedes out of respect.
---
Seems not bad in Handlock/Silence Priest.
---
This explains why the reveal footage was using warlock when showing Ra's summoning animation
---
Oh my god it's Shaggy.
---
Don't worry, there'll always be a combo / tempo-combo deck ready to decimate all the control if they get too cocky. Let's call it giants mage, if you will.

I had my information from hearthpwn, they had a scarab with no beast tag shown as token, they changed it now to a beast.
---
If you have Zilliax don’t forget to throw  SN1P-SN4P in the mix :)
---
Had my information from hearthpwn, who showed a scarab without beast tag after the reveal. It is now a beast.
---
Bro! Share this Deck List. I love messing around with Plot Twist builds. And I've always been eyeing Untamed Beastmaster, brainstorming how to make him synergize. This sounds awesome.
---
Summoning highkeeper Ra
---
Isn't it dumber to say that something can not be countered, when in fact, it can be countered by a number of cards, even in standard? And these cards are often played and even when not played these can be  randomly generated in the midrange hunter and cyclon mage decks - two of the most popular decks this expansion.
---
Foolish Tegline, that's clearly dyed leather
---
That’s sweet, thanks for the nice summary :)
---
It’s just seems like an annoying card tbh. Like it doesn’t involve fun play around like most other secrets. It’s just, “oh did you play a normal game of Hearthstone? Destroy a minion of yours.”
---
Why wouldn’t you be able to?
---
Not even that amazing in arena tbh.
---
The best part of this card is that it will let you complete the "play combo cards" quest faster.
---
&gt; The problem is, I don't think Hearthstone can handle spells fizzling.
---
Cast a spell targeting a minion, which spawns a Flame off of Illidan, which triggers Knife Juggler to deal the final damage to Anomalus, wiping the board.
---
The spell will then fizzle, not get returned to your hand, not target a new minion, etc.
---
^ overated comment
---
any one remember the scarabs from The Mummy? Those little crawlies gave me nightmares
---
Annnndddd you've successfully predicted the flavour text this card will have. (probably)
---
Wow this is beautiful. If only it was realistic to pull off :)
---
Acidmaw and Brann are the 7-Cost legendary minions for Hunter class. Acidmaw saw literally no competitive play, while's not that hard to get value out of Brann.
---
Hunter's Pack will surely give you 3 overall good cards for 3 Mana, while Lock'n'Load costs almost the same, but requires you to spend further Mana and brings random rewards.
---
Hooked Scimitar costs 3 Mana, and even without the +2 Attack Combo it'd be overall stronger than a 4 Mana 1/3. Elemental Dectruction costs 3+5, but you can't play it early on without sacrificing a whole turn afterwards - which is often your dead sentence. In the late game, it's a clunky, overcosted Earthquake that deals 3-4 damage less and doesn't deal with Deathrattle effects.
---
Charged Hammer is a 2/4 for 4 Mana. As a Shaman, you don't want to change your Hero Power to 'Deal 2 damage', especially not 3 turns later on. Splitting Axe is okayish with its 3/2 for also 4 Mana, but has immediate effect on the board.
---
Pretty sure I don't have to explain why Riftcleaver is better in almost any way than Void Crusher.
---
Same goes with Bloodsworn Mercenary (Copy a minion) compared to Orgrimmar Aspirant (spend even further Mana just to give your weapon +1 Attack), and Into the Fray to Bolster.
---
Restless Mummy deals 3+3 damage immediately. Magnataur Alpha has to wait a turn and require the opponent's board to aline accordingly to be useful. Both cost 4 Mana, both have technically 3 Health.
---
So, Apothecary deals 5 damage to you whenever you summon a minion.
---
The new vulture summons a minion when you take damage on your turn.
---
If you have both, they loop together - Apothecary deals 5 damage, triggering the vulture summon, which triggers apothecary. This continues until the vulture stops summoning things, such as if the board fills
---
If you use treachery to give both to your opponent, then if they take damage on their own turn, they will loop until the board fills. Curse of Rafaam deals damage to your opponent on their turn, starting the loop. It can trigger up to 5 times if they have an empty board, dealing 25 damage from apothecary and 2 from Curse of Rafaam.
---
I have seen worse get upvoted, on the topic of unfunny shit being upvoted the 50/50 either it happens or it doesn't is annoying as fuck.
---
Especially because reddit used to complain about Amaz using it as catchphrase 4 years ago and now it's always at 100+ upvotes
---
Think it’s enough to slow the meta down to mid-range/control pacing?
---
I get it’s a matter of preference but aggro decks leave a bad taste in my mouth. If you get your cards on curve, you win, if you don’t, you lose. 
---
i don’t think the archetype is any more luck dependent than other decks but it feels a lot less interactive to play against.
---
Some of these comparisons feel like a bit of a reach.
---
Do you like a card that buffs your whole board? Bloodlust. Savage Roar. Blessing of the Ancients. No? Then it’s not a token deck. 
---
No, rolling Leokk off Companion does not count. No, Hunter is not a token deck.
---
When your post's focus is in those cards, you're damn sure I'll be referring to them. Also, are you discrediting your comments? Those should be supporting the post, right? Are you just saying that we should read your titles instead of what you post? You're just contradicting yourself at this point.
---
He has taunt because he wants to be put out of his misery pog
---
Yes. It made me make a Reno Hunter and I'm having some decent success with it right next w.
---
I made this, (my signature is in the bottom right)
---
But inspire is pretty much capped at one activation per turn barring specific cheat cards. This card is at worst inspire to summon a 3 drop. That's a good inspire effect. Combine that with a flame imp on the same turn and there is some game winning potential.
---
On the bright side both of the cards revealed look quite good, even if they do have anti-synergy with each other
---
Next turn you have not enough space on board because Tak is still there.
---
I mean, this is Hearthstone, there is a possibility that this interaction would go against all common sense and rules and still work.
---
[[Nerubar Weblord]]
---
Yeah? Hearthstone has that kind of RNG too. It also has a buttload of *other* RNG, which is why people complain.

---
2/1/4 | Minions with Battlecry cost (2) more.  
---
Rhastakhans was boring for me. The standard year end did wonders for the game. It still isn't in a great place for me right now but it's looking promising this expansion.
---
Somehow its Wyatt Chengs fault
---
&gt; Noble Sacrifice is like Bluegill Warrior
---
But no one would attack into a Bluegill with a Leeroy. That's why paladin secrets can have much higher variance. The only hunter secrets with high variance for effect are Explosive Trap of 1 (or 0) minions vs 7, and Wandering Monster. No hunter secret can net you higher than a 3 mana value.
---
&gt; but the thing they get that other secret classes don't is the wide range of triggers and ways to play around their secrets
---
Mages have: cast a spell, cast a spell targeting a minion, attack face, damage face for lethal, attack a minion, play a minion, kill enemy minion, for 7 different triggers, many of which have multiple for each with radically different strategies for the same trigger.
---
Hunters have: attack face, attack with a minion, cast a spell, play a minion, use hero power, play 3+ cards, attack a minion for the same total number of 7, except no one would ever run Dart Trap even if you paid them so it's really 6, and the majority of these don't drastically alter your game plan. Explosive Trap against a flood and Freezing against fatties. Nothing else is worth worrying about except not playing more than 2 cards a turn.
---
&gt; but it's also strong against midrange style decks as well
---
It really, really, really truly isn't. That's just about its worst match up. There are no mid-range decks that are devoted to keeping single minions alive and can easily go a few turns without casting a spell. Meanwhile they're hitting you hard every turn and when they do need to use a spell can attack such that they're left with a bunch of X/1's where this secret is nothing but a Moonfire.
---
5 mana, this into demonic possession
---
*Slightly* sick? He's positively green!
---
Nope, that's not what I said. I said you can't just ignore the title and go balls deep into a discussion denouncing that an important information's missing that's literally in the title. This whole post is about Uldum seeming to be overall more powerful and unconditional than TGT, with the picture and comments giving examples.
---
And her i was thinking this was a top tier unbeatable combo, but then tgis childrens catdgame had to ruin it with RNG smh. ^/s
---
Nice job deleting your initial post and reposting because you didn’t like the feedback. I doubt it will be any different.
---
I'm not convinced that supreme archaeology is actually better than Wilfred. Yes, Wilfred was bad, but I don't think supreme archaeology will be playable either. 20 cards is just way too much, even with plot twist. You also don't want to burn plot twist for quest progress, you want to hold it for a Fel Lord Betrug combo, which is at 10 mana.
---
I don't think that's much of a problem by turn 10. Either you're returning him into your hand by yourself or your opponent's just destroying him.
---
This is the kind of comment I hoped I would get when writing this post. Never looked at the matter from an alignment perspective, but now that I do, I think you make some excellent points.
---
Brann sucks on its own. If the last highlander card isn't good then none of the explorers will see play
---
Add in a Violet Illusionist to this and you’re onto a winner!
---
I never said your message is wrong, just the examples and the explanations. Of course SoU is stronger than TGT, come on.
---
Wow we need that card again
---
Brann is effectively 10/12 worth of stats that deals 8 damage. For 7 Mana. The current 8% of Bomb Warrior in the meta won't change that.
---
It's also the most played card in Wild according to HSreplay.
---
hollowed#11966 NA. I show, you first.
---
In class order: 
---
Druid: Living Roots, Druid of the Saber, Darnassus Aspirant, Aviana
---
Hunter: King's Eleek, Bear Trap
---
Mage: Polymorph Boar, Arcane Blast
---
Paladin: Seal of Champions, Warhorse Trainer, Murloc Knight, Competitive Spirit, Mysterious Challenger
---
Priest: Flash Heal, Power Word: Glory, Wyrmest Agent, Spawn of Shadows
---
Rogue: Buccaneer, Shady Dealer
---
Shaman: Totem Golem, Tuskarr Totemic, Draenei Totemcarver, Thunder Bluff Valiant, Elemental Destruction
---
Warlock: Wrathguard
---
Warrior: Bash, Alexstraza's Champion, Varian Wrynn
---
Neutral: Flame Juggler, Lance Carrier, Argent Horserider, Silent Knight, Refreshmant Vendor, Injured Kvaldir, Twilight Guardian, Justicar Truehearth
---
Those are all the TGT cards that were played in those years between standard and wild, it's something around 30, a low number but I wouldn't bet on being the weakest expansion ever.
---
If you use the Quest you only need 2 Spellpower totems in hand, then you can duplicate the Axe's battlecry to get 7 totems. Granted, that leaves you with one less mana for burn spells...
---
Well, Plot Twist supports both the quest (that you can play on turn 1 already) and Betrug, you don't *have* to decide what to synergy with - especially not in Wild with all that survivability given for Warlocks to play far further than turn 10.
---
it's also not true.
---
Also none of the examples are wrong. Easy as that. Explanations are all over the thread.
---
Huh that's interesting... I just commented on this exact post 10 mins ago and it was deleted and re-posted by the same user. Thanks for explaining it this time atleast. Although all you're pointing out is "power creep" which happens in generally every expansion because new cards should be able to be played.
---
I'm going to say again though: 75% of these are literally completely different cards that have NOTHING in common other than ironically sharing mana costs.
---
But please, delete this post too and make a new one until someone agrees with your point.
---
Yessss
---
Half of these comparisons make no sense.
---
Orgrimmar Aspirant vs Bloodsworn Mercenary?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
Hehe I have also tried to make this deck work. Added in the neutral rush beasts also.
---
I agree they do different things, but I meant that Igneous had a big issue that this card doesn't have.
---
I played with it a bit in elemental decks and quest hunter and people ignored it and I had to trade it into something myself to get value out of it. If I crushed it into a minion with 3 or more attack I wouldn't get value off the 3 health and if Igneous survived a trade I didn't get the 1/2s until later. If it had a battlecry instead it would've been much better. The new card doesn't need you to suicide it to give you the tokens. That's a big advantage to me. (Obviously I could be wrong)
---
You just counted the ones played on release-until rotation, I counted all the time between 2015 an now both Standard and Wild.
---
Druid of the Saber saw plays in Aggro Druid, the one that topped the curve with Fel Reaver and old FoN.
---
Aviana got nerfed for how she was strong in wild.
---
Polymorph got used in Odd Mage in Wild.
---
Warhorse Trainer is as close as a staple in Odd Paladin in Wild.
---
PW Glory is a Big Priest tech against aggro.
---
Spawn of Shadow was one of the reasons for Raza nerf.
---
Buccaneer and Shady Dealer are good picks for Odd Rogue in Wild.
---
Draenei Totemcarver is used in Even Shaman.
---
Wrathguard is an Even Warlock card, but it fell off the meta recently.
---
Varian Wrynn was used later in Tempo Warrior decks around Old Gods, nothing staple but it was usable.
---
Flame Juggler was used because the ping was incredibly useful against a different meta where Leper Gnome was the most common 1 drop.
---
Lance Carrier was used in some zoo iterations.
---
Silent Knight was a card used in Stealth Rogue (or Water Rogue), the one that played Shadow Sensei and Finja.
---
Refreshmant Vender was used by warlocks when Healbot rotated out.
---
But yeah the mechanics were mediocre at best, Joust was heavily relying on rng and most inspire cards were overcosted and the ones played were really snowbally (Spawn of Shadow, Thunder Bluff, Murloc Knight)
---
What the actual fuck.
---
I would definitely second what /u/olympas posted. As a new Hearthstone player, there are many different challenges beyond simply making plays on your turn:
---
Deckbuilding, Proper mulligan choices, Reading your opponent, etc
---
By using a well-established deck you can remove several of these challenges and focus on mastering the gameplay itself. Finding a good guide for a meta deck will help you mulligan correctly and play each matchup appropriately. /r/CompetitiveHS is a good place to find well-written comprehensive deck guides, and [HSReplay.net](https://hsreplay.net/decks/) can give you raw data about what decks are performing well and guide your mulligan choices with the "mulligan winrate" stat.
---
Finally, know that it takes time to learn a new deck. Be patient with yourself and focus on what you can learn from each game, win or lose.
---
If you are thinking about conjurer calling then not - its a token not a card - can't be generated.
---
Wtf this is a token.
---
Whaaaaaat!?!!!?!
---
Well... Stonehill Defender was super strong. This card also seems as if it'll be really good.
---
Of course Stonehill was a neutral, so you could play it in classes like Paladin to find things like Tarim or Tirion but still.
---
 I think it’s fine
---
And no other classes can have control decks that stand up to Warrior right now because Dr Boom hero card provides infinite value which means only another infinite value generator has a chance.
---
Id say that is worth it.
---
Why stop there? 0 mana 1/1 with stonehill text, coming 2023
---
Sorry but if we’re going for cheap shots (easily broken tier play sounds) then no one tops kel’thu’zads voice line, sorry
---
cool effect but fuck c'thun i guess?
---
I couldn’t find anything that said that this card would be excluded from evolves or even worse, Conjurer’s Calling. At 10 mana, that would make the Sea Giant combo even more obnoxious. Can anyone confirm?
---
Oh wtf man
---
I wrote the lyrics! Glad you liked it!
---
More like Ankhu the crackhead.
---
Holy sh*t
---
Source?
---
Bomb Warrior about to break a lot of hearts this expansion
---
Wha-?
---
Wow, that is some insane value! Very slow, but god damn!
---
Now thats a card.
---
Thank you so so much, that is my point exactly! When I posted this I was not looking for criticism, however I find comments like this especially welcome and needed. Thank you so much. Cheers!
---
fake news boys
---
And a warlock deck even
---
This shit is top on Custom Hearthstone.  It's a fake
---
Just want to clarify, you are saying that it's not that taunt warrior would push other warrior decks out, it's that the other warrior decks will get pushed out and then taunt warrior will step in as a superior alternative? Sounds like a chicken vs egg debate to me my friend. 
---
Also the bold part was sarcastic.
---
What the actual shit?! N’Zoth in Standard?? Is this real? 
---
No way this is real.
---
Not sure why your being downvoted, that guy is straight up wrong, I spend double what he does and I bet I grind more gold too and I barely have access to 60% of any given expansion.
---
Love Machine Paladin has been my favourite archetype for all of ROS
---
Oops this was six days ago
---
I need 1200 dust to try it. I can't break the meta :(
---
This was from /r/customhearthstone, it's fake, guys
---
Is it? If you have few deathrattle cards, N'Zoth isn't. C'Thun won't be built up, so he won't be. Nerfed Yogg isn't that great, so he probably won't be. And Y'Shaarj is too slow if in a deck filled with big minions. Overall, if this is the remaining highlander card, I think it's a fail in Standard. Probably Wild too, but I'll wait to see if I'm missing something before pronouncing final judgement.
---
Well someone just meme’d this 5min ago so I guess that answers that
---
I don't think it will see any meaningful play, but cool none the less
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/ch3jzx/ankhu_the_awakener_the_boys_are_back_in_town
---
Fake.
---
At this point the act of Priest reveals is just hilarious. 
---
Also cool card design. Unfortunately, most of the Old God cards aren’t useful if your deck isn’t built around them.
---
Scoobidoobidoooo !
---
Okay yeah the art looks sketchy
---
I saw the same card in the custom Hearthstone reddit a few hours ago. 
---
So it seems to be fake.
---
it's fake
---
That’s what I’m thinking. Unfortunately.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/ch3jzx/ankhu_the_awakener_the_boys_are_back_in_town/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
It’s a common though?
---
People are stupid as fuck, keep it in mind. It can't be generated.
---
It's a token. Only collectable cards can be generated from Evolve or Conjurer's Calling.
---
Legendary?
---
yes legendary
---
That doesn't seem too legendary
---
It's a token dude.
---
yeah title is wrong, removed.
---
It is when you have to basicaly build your entire deck around pulling it off.
---
His entrance sound is also very cool. ;)
---
HOO-HO!! Then I'll play many spells as you like...
---
Does Steath carry over after reborn?
---
With the way things are going Quest Paladin might just have to jam these in
---
What Warcraft species is this art based off? Looks like a female troll face with undead hands, draenei legs and gargoyle stone body.
---
not great, not terrible
---
Yeah the deck is super problematic but only because of dr.boom. I feel like that card shouldn’t be in standard in its current iteration.
---
Arena card Pog
---
Good arena card. Pack filler otherwise.
---
Essentially a 5 Mana 4/2 with Divine Shield that gets to have Stealth a second time when the shield breaks. Will probably be played with the Paladin Quest if it‘a strong enough to see play.
---
I'm pretty excited by the idea here...hope it doesn't go down in FLAMES!
---
I think sometimes people overvalue taunt a little bit is all. Obviously taunt + deathrattle is a lovely combination but ultimately you get two 1/1s in hand for your trouble. If something doesn’t add value to that, he’s not that good. 
---
Igneous did require more work on your part to trigger and get the 1/2s, but in most decks he basically did have a battlecry because he triggered another elemental’s battlecry the next turn, and the 1/2s guaranteed that you’d trigger future ones as well. 
---
In quest rogue he added a ton of consistency but you had to sacrifice speed and board control. That’s where his lacking taunt made a big difference.
---
It's an overt reference (right down to the dialogue lines) to [a scene toward the end of Season 3 of *Stranger Things*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWtEuNuNzQo). If you haven't seen that scene, you'd definitely think this video was terrible, but if you *have*, this video is hilarious.
---
Happens to one class EVERY reveal season, we just gotta power through for now
---
Seem like an arena card to me. No reason to run this on ladder.
---
Okay, this is actually a solid card. Not sure if it would see much competitive play because it's a bit pricey, but this card is going to be very annoying to deal with in arena.
---
Very cheap to craft for a legendary...
---
Fake news?
---
Jesus where are the priest reveAls....
---
Meh, it's a card I guess.
---
Seems like this would have been more appropriate for the final card dump.
---
I put cybertech chip in mine and it feels like token druid a little more.
---
2 more mana for [[Jungle Panther]] minus a the beast tag for reborn? Absolute trash.
---
This is where the fun begins.
---
Decent with the Paladin Quest, and essentially a 5 Mana 4/2 “Divine Shield” Stealth that regains Stealth when the “Divine Shield” breaks. Will see play if the quest does.
---

---
3/4/2 Beast | Stealth  
---
Dude Quest Paladin might have to jam these in with the way things are going right now. 
---
Hopefully more good reborn minions will be revealed
---
I had a hard time believing this wasn’t real
---
This card really seems made for the Paladin Quest.  Even if you copy a version that already revived, you still make a 2/2 with stealth every turn unless your opponent uses a board clear.
---

---
"OUT OF MY JUNGLE"
---
Anybody know what the names mean?
---
My first match I was a hunter called “Aggresion 2”
---
This card might seem to be a pack filler at first sight.
---
But when I think about it it’s basically 2 Jungle Panthers attached in one card for 5 mana. Might see play in Quest Pally, if that ever is a thing.
---
I would say people are more likely to search for the term "hearthstone expansion" as a whole. If you do a Google trend on this you can see for the last 4 expansions this has remained fairly similar.
---
I think just weakening Dr boom and Calling would be enough to really spice up the meta. Maybe some neutral healing or anti bomb tech would be nice too.
---
Reddit is happy now that brawl is finally out.
---
“Jungle Panther, what happened?”
---
I'm not sure you need the numbers, since I assume each generated version of a 'type' of deck gets a number. So, you can just assume there are X number of decks for each template theme. The only thing we don't know is how many decks can exist per theme, and whether there's a set number, or if new decks are still being generated (so we could be in the thousands by next week).

I like how you think!

have they announced a date and time for the card reveal stream?
---
*Ultra Instinct Flunky* legendary please.

Pretty much every combo is like this, though? Exodia, mecha'thun, uther don't work if you have a full board either.

I'm calling her Nefer-Tina.

deck code pls?

Such a boring card
---
Toast will do it within a week of launch.
---
 No. If you want to play a card game without random effects, go play mtga or something
---
FYI the phrase is write home about, not ride.
---
out of my jungle
---
you need 8 exact cards in hand tho, no way you can pull this off by turn 3
---
we have not even hit the halfway point.
---
Is there any way in warlock to give unlicensed apothecary lifesteal?
---
Yeah but I was just joking.
---
Shaman "Elemental Wrath + Carvings 62"
---
Priest will be featured in the reveal stream. That's my guess.
---
Also druid
---
Yup. On phone so will keep it short:
---
Highkeeper Ra-den is one of the most senior titan constructs of Azeroth, hence his esteemed title. A bit like Prime Designate Odyn.
---
When the titans lost their fight against the fel onslaught of the Mad Titan, Sargeras, Norgannon's fast thinking saved their very essences by taking all of their souls away in the nick of time.
---
Eventually those souls would reach Azeroth and impact the Titan Keepers.
---
Ra realised what this meant: the death of the titans. He despaired and withdrew from the world.
---
When Lei Shen sought to uncover what Ra was hiding, it took some effort to get him to talk. When Ra told him of the futility of anything as their godly creators are no more, Lei Shen flipped Ra-den off and absorbed the titan power for himself.
---
Where Ra was stopped in his tracks with the news, Lei Shen was spurred to action. If the Titans can no longer undertake their grand design, it would be their creations who would continue it for them.
---
Lei Shen may be a bit of a bastard in the lore, but there's no questioning his vision and determination.
---
Also, this lore from the Chronicles is kinda contradicted by events in Legion, showing that the titans do indeed still live. How has not been clarified.
---
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know tempostorm was the only single reporting site that we're allowed to use.  How terrible of a mistake for me to make.
---
I mean it's not like VS has it mid tier 2, or HSreplay, probably THE most used site for data gathering has it at tier 1.
---
Oh, wait.

**AND EAT IT.**
---
youd die
---
What effect would Auchenai have here since it's not actually healing a set amount? I figured it would still just restore those minions to full health.
---
Even Rag is out of the best Big Priest builds because of Vargoth and Catrina.  Right now is probably the biggest difference between the Standard and Wild metas but there’s still a TON of overlap (Quest Mage/Cyclone Mage, Murloc Shaman, Mech Hunter, etc.).
---
Flexibility.
---
How about you take a look there as opposed to an opinion based tier list?
---
Token druid
---
I've played as or against probably 10 different decks, and I haven't seen any with Deathwing
---
god damn that is impressive stuff. How long did this take you?
---
Well, I guess they kinda just reformed. Somehow.
---
No, it was to play infested goblin on 3, most probably dies on opponent's turn, psychopomp on 4. 
---
But don't worry I won't force you to play it, if that's what making you react in defensive sarcasm.
---
The two paladin decks I’ve gotten were silver hand but full of Murlocs.....
---
I played a Zilliax into a Mechanical Whelp's Dragon once and insta healed 10, then opponent surrendered and friend requested lmao
---
Casual 8 card combo on 3 lol
---
Oh yeah sorry my math was off its turn 4 or 5
---
Brawl changed, now it's random deck vs random deck if you lose you get the opponent deck
---
Immediately gets hard removed, now have zero cards in hand.
---
Sounds like a Priest strategy
---
The Silver Hand + Small Army  (Paladin)
---
Let's hope it stays this way, because they already have way too many secret synergy cards.
---
 Just like some physical cards hold value I believe there can be value with these digital assets that are sought after and scarce.   If I understand correctly the block-chain is just making sure that the digital asset is assigned to you, recorded and therefore cannot be duplicated.
---
Quick! Post it as a new card and grab some karma. I’m too lazy to do it myself. Lol
---
Thanks!
---
This brawl doesn't seem to count towards quests
---
This is already a better Priest card than many Core Priest cards. This is not to criticize this minion, but to point out the sorry state of the aformentioned class.
---
Needs to take his own advice about growing a pair.
---
Deadly Shot, Venomizer, Spider Bomb, this one now. Hunter is becoming the new Rogue with all the annoying removal.
---
I think it’s gonna be more along the lines. Add a 1/1 copy of a minion to your hand. Probably friendly.
---
ok, maybe it was. Thank you.
---
We don't know mage's plague card yet right? Could be another big spell this might benefit from!
---
Why is there a faceless behemoth in my dragon mech pirate warrior deck???
---
Oh right, for the warrior hand buff.
---
Is there going to be any way to see which decks end up being successful over the different periods of the brawl? Or how many wins each deck gets total? Like if a Mech paladin 553 comes to dominate, will there be any way to see the aggregate wins it collects?
---
Let's assume you're at least 30% correct. What keeps control decks in check? Pre-RoS it was the plethora of OTK decks. Those don't exist anymore. The only downside to playing Warrior is the length of the games and the inevitable mirrors. It is hands down the best and strongest deck in the entire game by entire tiers.
---
I’m most excited about the warlock quest myself. Plot Twist —&gt; Tier 1 Kappa
---
Lag too op, Blizz plz nerf.
---
There's also an insane ZERO otk.
---
Enemy warlock plays Jaraxxus, but they also lag and accidentally sacrificial pacts himself.
---
Been trying to hit legend with that one for years.
---
Should be the case that if one deck starts to dominate, other decks that beat it will get introduced and start spreading rapidly preying on it.
---
Want to buy some good midrange minions for Priest. But no, Priest will likely get some silly gimmicks that don't work against aggro, or huge spells that get killed by both aggro and "i have 1000 board clears" warriors (and also shamans now, because why not).
---
reborn is better than divine shield in this case, because after you trade into something you get stealth again after being revived. so basically you get double stealth and get to attack on your own terms twice, without being traded into.
---
[Swamp King Dred] disagrees
---
Assuming Toast will play HS, this will happen to Kripp within a week though.
---
Hit hero power 5 times, get upgraded hero power.
---
Warrior has become the token "rich but bad" class. Pump in money, pump out wins.
---
Done.
---
Nooo pls not 3 casters again
---
This is a really cool concept. It reminds me of Keyforge.
---
r/Hearthstonecirclejerk
---
I thought there wasn't any brawl that could be worse than the Heroic Brawls. Then this BRawl is released and proves me wrong.
---
This is by and far the worst Tavern Brawl they have introduced, without equal. Not fun when you're absolutely screwed if you aren't blessed with the perfect deck and the perfect RNG.
---
Will we get data about which decks were better once the brawl is done?
---
Please be yes
---
Yikes fuck Arena am I right?
---

---
Your opponent plays coldlight oracle on 3.  Ez combo on 3.

If I didn't get the fire festival quests the first week am I unable to get them now?
---
this will be good *Gonk noises with Lunara intensify*
---
Hello, karma
---
Isnt healing his minion playing for his outs? Healing himself would be playing safe
---
Paladin quest seems weird and cool and I love it. Could work in a combo or make Deathrattle Paladin somewhat viable. Maybe not the best, but the one I'm gonna have the most fun with so far.
---
Thats one low tempo card right there.
---
You're about 12 hours late.
---
The artwork looks so cartoonish that I had to look up whether this card really exists. Still like it though.
---
Can magic cure cancer and depression?
---
If they happen to play against another first timer or maybe against a deck that does well enough against some of the lower tier decks they may have a chance to win with an undefined deck. In a perfect world there would be two top tier decks but due to the variance in a normal game of hearthstone, the better deck doesn’t always win (bad draws, suboptimal plays, etc). Some players may even lose to one of the top decks and lose on purpose to a new deck in order to play that one creating noise in the system. I’m sure blizzard will be looking at all of this as there is so much data they can glean from this brawl. And even a week is not a very long time to create a true 50-50 meta.
---
Laughs in KotFT
---
Looking foward to Kibler burning the unrevealed warlock legendary the deck is built around.
---
JK excited to see him or anyone from the omni crew doing something like this.
---
Any deathrattle card with a good effect is now a rogue card regardless of the cost and stats.
---
Uh, no? What meta are you playing, literally all control warrior?
---
Aggro likes taunt honestly more than slower archetypes do, because taunt dictates trades. I don't really think infested goblin is enough stats up front, but there was a reason KotFT aggro druid played 2x Druid of the Swarm and 2x Crypt Lord. In almost every matchup right now there are really good applications for a powerful taunt.
---
Again, I don't think this card is the taunt we're looking for, but saying "token druid doesn't care about taunt at this speed of meta" is just not true. It's just there aren't any good taunts.
---
That’s insanely overpowered at 1 mana, though. Just off the top of my head, that’d make it **much** easier to get extra copies of Archivist Elysiana.
---
Oh, that's a good lackey
---
Hm why should that be the case? Are Blizzard actively monitoring and introducing new decks? Are those new decks distributed to anyone other than new players? If not, I don't see how new decks are going to prey on the dominant ones.
---
in other words:  it is the Tron of hearthstone.
---
No it wasn’t
---
Yeah, not going to watch another three caster reveal stream. I'm really disappointed; reveal streams are some of my favorite content. I'm not upset that they decided to try something different last time, but the disaster of Chris constantly talking over Cora and the negative community response that followed pretty much showed that it was a failed experiment.
---
Chris, I see you're in here responding to comments; I'm sure you were just nervous/over-excited last time, and I hope you do better this time around. You've got a steep hill to climb and I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. But I still won't be tuning in.
---
wait are there more decks with 4 patches? because mercenaries 32 has 4
---
Scooby do by doo where are you
---
Yeah this is one of the most interesting Brawls they've ever done. I hope Blizzards shares some stats on it after it's over.
---
Yup. Pretty soon this will probably be the only deck left.
---
Cringey ass names 😬😳😫👍😘
---
Because it’s all tumbleweed right now over there.
---
Whenever this minion attacks, deal one damage to each adjacent friendly minion
---
maybe the exsistence of big priest warped the meta around it and became very aggressive?
---
Surely one of all those healing spells priest has can help there, cure disease perhaps?
---
They are also very power hungry aren't they? So I imagine if someone flys in on a stolen magic city they might want to help them out to gain more for themselves.  
---
But yeah, it's a stretch, they also arent buddy buddy with the pandaren especially if I recall.
---
Like I said above, I think we agree.
---
&gt;The idea that Tip the Scales isn’t a reference is truly ridiculous. 
---
I agree!  It's an obvious reference.
---
OP says they're "the same murlocs".  Remember George and Karl?  They're two very specific Silver hand recruits that have been lost in the jungle, freed from the jungle, etc.  To say every Silver Hand Recruit must be George or Karl is ludicrous.
---
wdym? the charcters are the same from the Blackrock mountain expansion
---
Mrglgrlgll 12
---
A combination of murloc, dudes, buffs, dragons, and 10 cost legendaries. I won 2 games with it before clogging my hand with hakar, yoga, deathwing and losing to beasts and buffs 82(?)
---
I have a few wins with an Elemental Shaman that has several random Murlocs and Gentle Megasaurs thrown in.
---
He later played seacaptain on turn 3 and had another patches in hand
---
The roguelite gameplay was far different from the Blackrock mountain adventure though.
---
I played against a friend and didn't get a pack. Has this happened to anyone else?
---
Jeeess..  That artwork is terrible
---
There was no speed run mechanic and the build up was also different. Characters, correct but that’s it.
---
other decks get nerfed but big priest dodges the bullet every time.  Either unnerf the nerfed stuff or hit big priest and i am not talking about Barnes. i am taling about a rework of the way how the graveyard works.
---
Just came across it too. Hard to imagine something beating this deck
---
No. Reborn is not deathrattle and changing cards with deathrattle would be fundamentally changing how they work.
---
it felt like i only got 5 but its possible i miscounted, i feel like i stoped getting them on like a thursday
---
I 100% agree with you, but God damn do I hate the "DaE: UnPoPuLaR OpInIoN?!?!?!?" It's so pathetically self serving. It adds nothing to the argument. It only serves to fuel some superiority/victim complex, discredit the "popular" opinion without any reason why, and/or insulate yourself from any backlash. 
---
Just leave that part out. Leave out the DAE, "unpopular opinion", "this will get downvoted but" BS. There really needs to be a rule similar to the PSA rule where posts just get auto deleted and possibly users banned if your post title or description contains any of that crap.
---
&gt;His title of Ra-den is derived from Raijin, also known as Raiden, the god of lightning, thunder, and storms in the Shinto religion.
---
From Wowpedia.  So yeah I got the spelling off a little, but he has no relation to Ra, the egyptian god.
---
Because having control decks stonewalling eachother to turn 50 is such a fantastic experience.
---
That might have just been a coincidence, or perhaps because the brawl was still new. But I had one where I beat a 23 win silverhand deck with a 4 win shaman spell deck. I had two Hagathas, which saved me from certain defeat.
---
And the paladin quest will be about 1 health minions o wait.
---
It is not likely that they would. The minion that is summoned is also has a different name while the reborn will have the same name.
---
I use mech bomb hunter. The only spells are two tracking and 2 bomb toss, hounds. It also runs leeroy, which i wee peole dont like but he haa closed out more then a couple really closed games for me. Im just not having fun with the deck anymore.
---
It would deal damage equal to the minion's current max health. This interaction has been in the game since [Hozen Healer] was introduced. I had an arena deck once with 3 Auchenai and 4 Hozen Healers which I effectively used as hard removal.
---
That app is sickk!!    Also a cool model btw
---
I cant type on my new phone.
---
H-he's so fast! It's like he played Open the Waygate!
---
I did not know that! I don't think either of us are wrong, though. He could have been inspired by both.
---
It will never truly be 100% cause people keep joining with new decks, I beat Mercenary 14 and another Mercenary (30 something) with 4 patches as well with Druid before losing, but the vast majority is gonna be those busted decks
---
for example the 9 mana 9-9 rush is a god in arena, because it does something immediately and is a huge thing, while it is unplayable in standard.
---
7 mana kill yourself
---
That really seems too similar to the old warrior quest.
---
I had a play warlock cards and the warlock cards I played in the brawl counted towards the quest. Weird.
---
I've just run into my first mirror-match with the deck "Mercenaries 280" which has 4 Patches in it.
---
The deck that just beat me (that I'm playing now), has FOUR Patches the Pirate.  Common early play is ships cannon then a pirate and then four patches.  That's not fun?
---
Behold: the cancer that is [Mercenaries 280](https://imgur.com/a/bCTGRuG)
---
&gt;DanteMugetsu#2536
---
added my btag is  ta1pa#21711
---
Problem if it's all decided in a day then and the other 6 are spent as mirror matches.
---
No, the number indicates the number of minutes after begin of the brawl that the deck was generated.
---
But if you concede don't you become the pirate warrior?
---
What does mercanaries 14 or mage 1930 mean though, i am kinda new to the game
---
I think the new taunt warrior is not going to be compatible with recruit/dimensional ripper warrior because you aren’t aiming to have a large hand of minions.  
---
The new taunts (especially the one that gives you two more taunts in your hand) aren’t very compatible with recruiting.  
---
Maybe go in a more tempo direction with some cheaper taunts instead of boom reaver and dimensional ripper and add in vargoth because getting to double cast the new handbuff seems sweet.  😇
---
...you just described competitive hearthstone exactly.If you aren't looking for draw-based RNG wins, you're playing the wrong game,
---
If you run across a deck with four patches, youre welcome for that abomination
---
Ships cannon too. I just lost to it, literally every deck is gonna be this in a day or two.
---
I am eternally never lucky though
---
I mean the number that appears when you win with the deck.  The streamer I last saw only went up to 35 before facing mirror matches.
---
More like an hour or two
---
Suicide lock is my friend challenge as well.
---
Sorry, I misunderstood - I thought ppl were concedeing against you as a hunter to play a different deck.

heartless#1678 NA looking for casual friends to trade quests and practice
---
I honestly find that hard to believe on a community wide basis.  
---
I guess there are slight differences to each deck enough that perhaps it only tracks EXACTLY the same decks?  Meaning 35 for that particular iteration but another that has 1 card different might be another 35 etc.  
---
Otherwise this makes no sense:  
---
&gt;The problem is that from the last 30 games I'm facing 26 Mercenaries 14 mirror matchups  
---
That's 30 wins just from that players matchups alone.
---
I think that’s what we call bullshit rng and they just got lucky at the game. Attempting this combo requires more brain cells than they’ll ever possess.
---
I took that to mean “another warrior class taunt”.

Okay, that's a valid argument, but it's different from your original argument, which is that there exists one "dominant" deck that needs to be "discovered". Yes, given an infinite amount of time, the probability of reducing to a single deck converges to one, but that would be true even if you had a billion decks each with a 50% win rate against every other deck.
---
Unless one deck actually is inherently dominant (favorable win rate against every other deck), then the probability of that actually happening given Hearthstone's millions of active players is negligible. I would bet good money that you could run this brawl until Blizzard shuts down the servers and still not end up with a single deck.
---
Yes. I genuinely thought Cora was doing a good job but the stream felt off - I think due to there being 3 people present instead of two. But people were really horrible to Cora during and after the stream and that just sucked.
---
One of my initial paladin deck had Kangor's Endless Army, but only a single mech, N'zoth but no deathrattle minions. I think that tells you everything you need to know.
---
Mirror matches don't increase the win count.
---
Ah woops, my bad.
---
But that is what I just described literally right after what noknam quoted from me. I was just describing how Armagedillo being part of the Discover options affects further Discover chances for the Frightened Flunky.
---
&gt; The only soft counter is a high health DS minion, of which none were run for the duration of its life in standard.
---
[[Crystal Lion]] was run in some Dude Paladin decks at some point, possibly Even Paladin? And [[Tirion Fordring]] in OTK DK Paladin (with which JakAttack won HCT Sydney 2018).
---
And [[Plated Beetle]] countered it card for card while gaining mana advantage.
---
But yeah, Explosive Runes was really really good, and annoying to play against.
---
At the risk of quoting myself
---
&gt; not **my idea** of fun
---
Wait ..... theres people that keep playing tavern brawls after 1 win?

2/2/3 Beast | Deathrattle: Gain 3 Armor.

And a paladin spell that gives a minion lifesteal, which would make this a 0 damage fill the board combo if you manage to get it.
---
&gt;naturalize
---
&gt;2 bombs
---
Wait that's illegal
---
Dosent matter now way the power will be close to Dr. Boom level.
---
That's why i liked the longer games, so much thought had to be put into each turn, especially later in games; the amount of times warlock could regret just tapping one too many times was rediculous. My favourite was TGT Control Priest vs Control Warrior, those games were nuts.
---
"Another" referred to another card, not another class. You already appear to have mentioned that for Armagedillo, didn't realize it was the only other warrior taunt atm.
---
Premium stat distribution is also important. As an extreme example, magma rager is terrible because it has such low health that it easily be killed by a 0 mana minion despite it costing 3 mana. High(er) health minions tend to be good as long as they have the attack to control small minions on the board. Controlling the board with stealth, divine shield, and poisonous are key to winning.
---
A hypothetical 7 mana 5/8 divine shield would probably not see much play in comp., but would destroy in area as it would have some of the best arena characteristics.
---
I've lost to it once and subsequently won 4 mirror matches. It's not even fun anymore
---
2 expansions from now we will have a 1 mana 0/1 charge with gain +1 attack for every damage your hero took last turn.
---
Mercenaries 14 is really running rampant on eu. 4 patches mildly strong
---
While I agree goldshire footman doesn’t fit the second 2, but the first one seems very goldshire
---
I guess that we'll find out. I will say that I wish that the random decks had been restricted to legal constructed decks.
---
Johnny who?
---
Congrats on the new deck :)
---
I want one too!
---
Theres also mercenaries 32, which is the exact same deck as 14
---
I hadn't seen it. That's pretty good! I think the Luna one is still my favorite all time, just because of the way it captures that over-the-board feeling.
---
I was at least expecting the decks to be legal, not with 4 of a single legendary lol
---
It's so we can get the Keyforge experience without actually having to play Keyforge...
---
This is the fallacy of relative privation. There are children starving in Africa, so whatever you're complaining about is unimportant.
---
The numbers are incredibly wrong, this deck has hundreds, if not thousands of wins by now
---
Oh boy can't wait to play! I'm having flashbacks to Gadgetzan.
---
Another shit tier RNG fiesta brawl, AMAZING
---
Good luck conceding to the next non-mirror, been doing the same with 280 and have been insta-conceding to every match, 30 games now to the same 280, at this point i would love to face 14 just so I can see what demon is worse
---
gkaj#2632 looking to trade quest on EU. I'll show, you go first
---
Devilsaur is the biggest one. Now the deck rotated (old deathrattle hunter), but that change would be basically deleting that from existance. Devilsaur stops being usefull for beast recruit synergies and cube shenanigans, now is only "rush" synergies with town crier, if its ever played of course.
---
I think changes can be done to cards, yes. But with an actual, mechanical reason, not just "lets change the effects so that they are similar to keywords". If they dont want hallazeal to stack with multiple copies because some shaman deck is actually problematic with it, then yeah, change it to lifesteal so it remains mostly the same except in that situation. But changing it because it looks like its a lifesteal effect is not a valid reason for that. In the specific case of hallazeal they already talked about this when lifesteal was added (kft) and they said this wouldnt happen, because it changes a lot the functionality of the card, and kills the creativity (like people trying to stack hallazeals for some sort of shenanigan, but with lifesteal just being a simple direct control tool without much other cool synergies).
---
Looking like I made the right decision to not preorder. Boring cards is all I see. Sorry, downvote me if you want, I'm just being honest here.
---
I got nightmare at a kid though and it made me didn't dare touching any bug for months. Those are way more scarier than the mummy soldiers.
---
I tried using apothecary, treachery mad summoner combo but warlock is kinda weak without voidcaller in wild :/
---
No worries, I got you &lt;3
---
i'm afraid the time may have already come, at least in the higher win bracket. i've insta-conceded the last 30 games and they have all been against Mercenary 280
---
Yeah, and I assumed we'd end up with some degenerate aggro deck at the top. But it's skewed in a dumb way with duplicate legendaries because of one card that is completely broken when duplicated.
---
Thank you for the gem
---
Doesn’t counterspell have a similar design. At least with this if your board is basically tokens like a lackey or token deck the effect is inconsequential.
---
I have seen it in tons of games but it says it only has 30 wins, is that because there are so many mirror matches?
---
I'm also on it. And the last 5 matches I've been in have been mirrors
---
It's about a Magic the gathering article about what do players want in a deck. Google Timmy, Johnny and Spike for it. Some players just want to win no matter what, others want to be creative with decks, and others want to win, but in a spectacular fashion. Certain cards are designed not to be good in the competitive sense, but to satisfy some of those players.
---
###I'm in- I'm in- I'm in- I'm in charrrrge now!
---
[Read this.](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2002-03-08)
---
it seems that it only displays your wins and the person's wins you initially lost to with the deck and the numbers don't change if you face a mirror
---
basically the first one will deal 30 damage, then the bird summons one, that one will deal 20 damage, next 15, then 10 then the one after that deal 5 and the last one 0 since the board is full.
---
30+20+15+10+5 is 80 so you're correct.
---
*Ready for action!*
---
This event is Hearthstones version of Cursed Blood in WoW, except eventually it’ll be all mercenaries (4 patches) 280 ATM on NA. Took 5 games to get to it and have had 5 straight mirrors since getting it!
---
Needless to say I lost. At the end of the game I discovered that my opponent’s deck had 39 wins.
---
Yeah, it was printed alongside stuff like the druid snake in ungoro in order to cheat it out. It was their idea since the beggining.
---
Other stuff like hallazeal not being lifesteal was also said to be left like that, because they want hallazeal to stack with itself (something a lifesteal hallazeal wouldnt be able to do)
---
A decent stealth card apart from lotus assassin?
---
It gets old fast. Last 4 games I've played have been Mercs 280 mirrors (US). It's "Got your turn 1 pirate rush?" Yes = opponent concede, No = you concede.
---
Looks like mercenaries 280 is the winning deck. I beat about eight of them in a row with mech paladin before finally succumbing. I am now one of them...
---
I had a priest deck that could have but I mulliganed away both of my spirit lashes. I didn’t know what the mercenary decks were until it was too late.
---
Ye, premade killed all vibe.
---
The first one I faced (and lost to, of course) had 4 Patches in it and a ship's cannon. I haven't lost yet!
---
I'm dying.
---
I beat it twise with the tempo rogue i started with, then lost to it.
---
M14 was my last 7 opponents in a row
---
I want to trade 80 Gold quest on NA, I can show it, but we play your quest first.
---
Piotrsama#1647
---
Check my history, I traded a lot of times here.
---
What other situation did he relate it to?
---
Same, took 5 matches to get it, 5 straight mirrors since.
---
Then question then becomes, "Why would you want to?"
---
&gt;Quick
---
Just play lightgorged blessing on the apothecary
---
That’s... that’s the point of the fucking brawl...
---
Yes
---
Mad summoner is faster and only needs 4 combo pieces, still bad though
---
I too find it odd that the decks allowed for multiple legendaries and more than 2 of every other rarity. think it wouldve been more interesting to see what deck came out on top under normal deck limitations
---
Its a chain of this perticular deck, i get it, tnx
---
Empower 457? I’m beating merc 280 rn with a janky spell hunter deck. Haven’t won yet but I don’t think they’re going to top deck through my 10/10 taunt.
---
Pirate warrior loop, thats pretty much it
