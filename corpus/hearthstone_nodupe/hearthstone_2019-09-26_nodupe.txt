Yeah, I got a Rin so managed to delete the second phase deck and then put in one corrupted blood. By the time he got himself down to the last phase, there were too many bloods in the deck to survive. Easy win.
---
---
---
I have the deck and have run a handful of matches.
---

---
And boy let me tell you it is hard as hell to pilot. I did not enjoy playing the deck whatsoever and would not recommend it. It sort of plays out like quest shaman where you build little boards wave by wave but it feels weaker and has less reach.
---
It's harder when the power level of decks creeps up. It tends to hit points where it gets far harder to make weird decks.
---
For example, if a class has a good quest, you either have to come up with a deck good enough to compete with that quest or build your deck around that quest. That can be pretty limiting on what kind of decks you do.
---
Yep.  Doing that with any of the treasure minions can become powerful quite quickly.
---
I have to agree with this, they pushed what seemed to be a fun archetype (thief), it lost quite a few good cards (still a few decent steal cards around) but it seems like it's only half way there from a standard perspective, they then remove shadow priest and now only leave one real archetype of priest open in standard play, which is the most linear, boring pos deck to play.  
---
I have a golden priest with 1500+ ranked wins, but I literally dusted all my priest cards this expansion because they will not be seeing playing for quite some time.
---
He becomes cake with specific setups.
---
Just finished a heroic run where i had crook and cane + alchemist stone + the panda.
---
I discovered 1 mana journey below to always be in my starting hand so I was able to turn 1 summon mexxena to hold the board for 2-3 turns until I was able to fill my board with my big ass minions. Eventually I found 2 sorcerer's apprentices + tony and the rest is history doing 12 damage fireballs to his face forever.
---
I like jojo and all, but no.
---
Between 1 arms and 2 AoP, what made you decide with Arms post nerf AND have beaming sidekick AKA the arms replacement.
---
Unfortunately for everyone in this sub, this is the reason you do not work for blizzard
---
I mean, it doesnt matter if he doesn't like it... he still did it and it's fair criticism.
---
Yeah, watching Trump and Kripp are far more fun than actually playing the game.
---
If you get the treasure that makes your minions perma stealthed it's super OP. Only problem is some of the bosses still take forever to clear their unending board of kill a minion deathrattles/sylvs/reborn minions so a lot of the fights get stuck with 60 blood of hakkars in their deck.
---
But It sucks having to do that every turn.
---
I had plenty of time to add a few in.
---
I beat him with one deck because  of the rush minion that does 5 dmg after it dies and goes back into your deck. I duplicated it with the bosses 2nd passive about 15 times and out controlled the boss.
---
It took an hour and a half.
---
This boss is a great example of artificial difficulty.
---
Give the boss a shit ton of board clears and have the player lose repeatedly.
---
This isn't as convenient as text, but here's a picture of the decklist:
---
[Wombo Combo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFQqVVBXUAAijvy.png:large)
---
Thats pretty new
---
I got lucky got one of bobs decks otk in turn 4 cycling the mana refresh into free spells into spell power hand of rag.
---
If the AI was actually smart it would be really unfair. Too bad most of his cards suck ass if you have early game and he plays weapons like the combo blade without combo
---
He is definitely the toughest plague lord so far. At least on heroic.
---
It's like I was made for this.

SNIKNEEEEEJ... YOREEL!

&lt;

I highly recommend watching streamers grind it out for high legend. It's not as fun as watching Kibler (for example) mucking around with quest mage, but streamers like Thisj who verbalize their thought process while grinding with legit decks while suffering through the best of the best and eeking out a 55%+ winrate are really impressive and will help your game (imo).
---
It was actually supported for a very brief time some months ago, but was yeeted in the next patch. What happened?
---
Apple has set an absolutendeadline for april 2020 for iPad Pro support, and you can count on me reporting this indie componany so the whole app goes down if they haven’t fixed it by then.
---
I got him when he un-tombed Octosari during his second phase and he was actually already low on cards and had a full hand. I killed Octosari so that he actually entered fatigue, but since he was still in the second phase it made Octosari come back as if he was Reborn, so I got him to go WELL into his third phase by taking a massive amount of damage. The boss got a new deck upon entering his third phase, but not without taking like 30 fatigue damage first.

Didn't understand my joke? Not to worry. Not all can transcend to the plains of luxury comedy, where you go beyond comedy and keep going in past until it's basically not funny at all but don't stop there that's too obvious, you need to keep going to find that delicious gourmet shit. You probably thought I was making a sarcastic comment but you couldn't be more wrong, peel back the layers to find the absurdity. Absurdity holds back the darkness, I know this as I just asked it in my dream and it told me "it don't make sense!" and it was at that point everything became clear to me. The absurdity was literally holding the darkness at bay. You can choose to look at the surface or if you're up for it try reach beyond for some of that delicious gourmet comedy.

Amazing. Have an internet point.
---
My friend Kawagek was the first player I saw use them, and everyone started playing them shortly after. They're just really good proactive cards to establish board presence as well as combo pieces. Bwonsamdi makes the 2nd acolyte way worse. You have enough cycle with just 1.

That’s what i thought initially but instead used those which contributed to winning

This made me laugh. I like it

you said you used to play “a lot.” what’s your collection like? you might like checking out wild. it’s surprisingly cheap to get into, and many of your older cards will still be relevant

Lies! This is all photoshop. Screenshots on all phones HAVE to be taken with &lt;5% charge remaining.... not to mention 2 hour game.

Seriously though, my phone uses FAR more power to play hearthstone. It wouldn't survive a 2 hour game.
---
It was a core card of control Mage when the  Death Knights were standard. I loved that deck. Other than that I’ve never seen it played.
---
I’d hang on to it. It’s a neutral board clear, which is extremely valuable. Also, elemental synergy sucks right now, but it could be a thing again in future expansions. This guy is also pretty much a full heal with frost Lich jaina in wild.
---
A viable win-con that's not a... „secret agent, coming through”.
---
If you want to get better by watching games, you should check out the HS esports YouTube channel (or watch GM Live). They basically upload all GM matches, meaning not only are you watching the best players compete, but also the casters provide valuable insights and the player interviews sometimes focus on specific plays that even the casters were not sure about!
---
There are legendaries that are always good, like Leeroy Jenkins, or Bloodmage Thalnos. 
---
There are legendaries which are never good, like Millhouse Manastorm. 
---
Then there are legendaries which are very meta-dependant. Meaning that when conditions allow for them to shine, they’re *really* good &amp; useful. But this only happens about “half of the time”. The other half of the time, you hardly ever see them being played, and they don’t fit coherently into any competitive decks. Barron Geddon is one of those legendaries.
---
I guess this is a good time as ever to bring this up:

RAVEN#21301 EU trading 80g quest, you go 1st
---
That is the thing though, it is all RNG. Not only what kind of treasures you get, because some of them make it a cakewalk and some are just useless, but also the summoned minion can turn the game around stupidly. In my last run I was lucky enough to get a Rin from the first summon, and she got reborn. So I was able to delete his deck twice, even after he switched phases. When he gets stuff like Sylvanas or Obsidian Statues the value is insane.
---
Fatigue decks are my favourite type of decks! Plus, this adventures adds a new layer of complexity to fatigue decks due to fatigue/deck resetting on bosses and not actually having a "fatigue" buckets. Also, you now have to actually deal with the bosses instead of cheesing all of them.

Normally, I would spend my gold on anything even slightly tolerable but there is no way I'm spending anything on this pile of garbage. This is just laughably terrible design. The worst of the very worst that a card game can do.

---
Haha this is how I feel about Thijis' youtube content. I go in expecting something off meta and just see that he is playing a meta deck that rnged into the situation.
---
Yea that’s a little better than my 80 damage one, just a little.
---
I was more referring to hunter.
---
[This one's my favourite, the soundtrack for Dancing Star Night is also amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqxwe3KtKBc)
---
I dont think it works that way, not with the game in such a state of NO skill like it is right now.  Decks play themselves.  other than Priest and the unstoppable resurrect/divine spirit BS, decks are centered around quests or vomiting your hand &amp; generating cards over and over.  Thats it.  I suppose Hunter runs a seceret-vomit deck too that does OK.  But again.... a PHD-level education isnt required for any of this. 
---
Watching streamers doesnt do anything but waste precious moments of your life you wont get back.
---
Will do if RNG presents itself once more :p
---

---
Asserting dominance through the strongest powerplay
---
I beat the Murloc plague lord first try because I got 2 of these and the rushing 5/1 guy with deathrattle deal 5 to their board and shuffle this into your deck.  Crazy broken, literally grinded him down til he had zero cards in hand or deck even though he refills his deck every time he transitions.
---
I think it’s been really fun and crazy. Worth my money but I also have money to spare for games here &amp; there.
---
It’s not about rewarding on this. This adventure is more a game mode and less about cards. The packs are a bonus imo. Pay to play if it’s worth it to you or skip it.

Yes. Also stays as a card in your deck even after triggering at the start of the game.

Damn I came here to say the same thing. This incel needs some help
---
After the combo is done, which cards can defeat it? Is there something that grows exponentially over turns? Serious question.
---
All I can think of is Questing Adventurer and Jade Idols, but it's not fast enough, I guess. Maybe some duping shenaningans with Elise and Elysiana to keep the gas going instead of Jade Idols.
---
That is Jaina from the latest WoW expansion.
---
I hope they remove the class restrictions on it.
---
Now I'm trying to decide if I should DE my Ragnoros so I can get a free one?
---
They previously said they liked the idea of doing a rework of the entire priest class in an event!  Still crossing my fingers!
---
I'm copying the title to point out the stupidity, obviously.
---
Being fun is what counts
---
Just because a concept has found success in better implementations doesn't make this terrible implementation any good. You can't get dazzled by ideas and call your evaluations sound.
---
I can’t wait to grind out another 500 wins with Hunter. I loved SMOrcing people down and having an excuse to do it with an already “completed” (500 Win) class is great.

---
Nice thanks
---
I mean res priest, or actually big priest is what its called.  But yes.
---
I really hope Loatheb is coming back.
---
I have Golden N'Zoth. Does this mean I should dust?
---
That portrait of Anduin is fireeee
---
There was a decent rogue highlandar anka deck not to long ago, kinda pricey on the dust though,iirc was mentioned in an episode of omnislash and one of neon's recent "top legend decks" weekly posts.
---
Let's hope this is a test for a real "rotation" where they bring back cards from the past into the classic set.  Could be a great peek at things to come!
---
Nah, Sylvanas was frustrating to deal with and auto-include in every non-aggro deck. That in combination with N'Zoth is just a big nope.
---
Like to see N'Zoth working with new Deathrattle minion.
---
I predict: Lich King, Reno Jackson, Bloodreaver Guldan, Deathstalker Rexxar, Lich queen jaina, Aluneth, Emperor Thaurrisan, Justicar Trueheart (maybe, but finley of the sands already exists so idk), Loatheb, Kun the forgotten king, Malfurion the Pestilent, Prince Keleseth (god forbid), Patches, Sylvanas
---
Actually most of this is awesome and stuff I had, at some point, complained about in the past. Good to see some reaction from Blizzard.
---
...but err, more deck slots?
---
Same here. As a new player I was intimidated in even attempting a ranked match.
---
That's about their standard time, not about the free copies.
---
You need to play the Highlander version that runs Anka and the pirate package. Absolute blast to play.
---
I think it is a good buff for Quest Priest too.
---
It is, there are some rogue decks in wild that run it with scheme for infinite walls.
---
Other than sn1p-sn4p which is basically just any other OTK deck (and folds if you have dirty rat and a pair of board clears) and secret mage (which has a high win rate but only because it's not popular enough to be teched against much) what do you not like about the current meta? 
---
Most of the top decks are "new" or at least feature new cards, and last year's favorites are still playable, and the Barnes nerf did exactly what we all wanted without destroying that deck entirely. 
---
I'd like a revisit to balance in another month maybe but at least right now the format feels pretty open.
---
Can't wait to get a big stone fist for warrior!
---
I thought Areana wins DO count for portrait.  Didn't they change that awhile ago?
---
I am afraid of Sylvanas coming back...
---
Finally, my Golden Ragnaros returns to standard for all to see.
---
Silverback Patriarch
---
I think you can reroll a 50 into a better quest, but 60s will roll down (assumption being that if you're rerolling a 60 you want an easier quest and not a different hard one?)

Having Ragnaros in the 8 drop pool is gonna be nasty with all the Shaman mogu fleshshaper evole shenanigans
---
The 1000-win hero portraits literally will bring me back to this game. I focus my time on the 3 heroes that I don’t have golden portraits for (Shaman, Druid, and Hunter) which makes the game very limiting for me since all the others are already golden. This update will give me an incentive to play with every single class again. That’s HUGE!
---
I tend to think it's old bots that don't recognize new taunt cards.
---
No, because they are only back for free during the event. (At least we assume at this point...)
---
No, they showed only 3.
---
i think it's called aging.
---
Yea its kinda funny that in quite near future we will have fluffy toys playing one with another and stuff but like that. But if that becomes new portrait for Jaina I dig it, it looks epic.
---
Cool something I’ll never achieve
---
They definitely won't do that. It's way too consistent at finding things like poly, mass removal and mass res - things some other classes should absolutely not have consistent access to.
---
You’re assuming that they will bring back 23 legendaries?
---
Or post LPG for any spell costing 1. It's basically Kalecgos with a worse body though.
---
*(Slams straight into face while there’s another Ragnaros on the other side of the board.)*
---
Highlander decks would be way too strong if they brought back Kazakus and Reno. Maybe the class exclusive ones? But I'm not sure if they are doing just neutrals
---
That’s not how it works currently; there’s no way for me to use the standard valeera portrait, I have to use the golden one.
---
It'd be so hilarious and dumb if Genn/Baku come back.
---
But I can see it happen one day... maybe not this time. Because only 25 cards making a comeback.
---
I always that Loatheb should be in classic.  One of the few, real, "disruption" cards.
---
“Incredible.”
---
Bolderfist Oger or 4 mana 7/7
---
The confrontation between her and her father will be legendary, someone should edit linkin park in the background
---
My lowest rank win class is Hunter at 1243 wins, this patch is going to give me so many goodies!
---
Hunter boners can’t get much larger right now
---
This is a big screw you to anyone who already has the cards.
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23156370
---
There's the official post
---
Highlander mage, priest and warlock aren't top tier decks (heck, two don't even exist), so I don't think adding Kazakus is that absurd.
---
It makes me wonder if the appeal of the mixed-set Arena formats contributed to this change. Either way, this should be a fun change of pace for a format which becomes old hat pretty quickly nowadays
---
But its what rogue "deserves"
---
They would need a really strong stalling/control core to make that work. It would be interesting though!
---
Kibler would: https://twitter.com/bmkibler/status/1091037735211552768?lang=en
---
I already have 3 classes over 1k. Guess it’s time to fire up some warlock and paladin! This is honestly an awesome change. Great work blizzard! This is really going to incentivize me to play more
---
Ranked and Arena wins with classes count.
---
Oh pls blizzard let me keep them, I'm trying to build a renolock in wild and he's one of the few pieces I need left
---
I mean, he always has? The reason you don't see him in wild though is because he dilutes the resurrection pool.
---
It wouldn't be a year of HS without everyone crying about "broken AoE" priest get partway through each year. So bring it on.
---
What a roller coaster ride
---
Sigh. I am 20 wins away from having all heroes golden. So much for checking off the Done box.
---
Some epic level trolling right there.
---
It's great to see BFA Jaina, but why are her colors all wrong?  I get her using fire to change up from her old portrait a bit more, and could even buy the change in her cloak, but her hair stripe being red instead of yellow is odd.
---
Sorry but what exactly made you think Guldan was blue? He's an orc
---
Metafrank#1326 trading 80g-Quest on EU
---
I mean, not necessarily. But they did say ”most popular and most game-changing cards”. Which sounds to me like mostly legendaries. Although I can’t think of any super popular non-legendaries that they would bring back. Maybe Coldlight oracle? Or blood of the ancient one, heh. Idk, just guessing.
---
You're super lucky he didn't Plague of Death you.
---
Any word on whether we will "keep" the returned wild cards after the event is over?  Could be a way to encourage newer players to play wild a bit more.
---
Fuck I might come back
---
Ahh either way it’ll be cool to see a new Thrall and Malfurion
---
hell yeah,I dont like mage and this one would probably make me play the class
---
They said they'd bring the cards back into Standard, not necessarily the Classic set. Zephrys probably still won't be able to give him.
---
Since when was Jaina fire mage? She literally has boss encounter and it’s majority of frost with some arcane mixed in. Bit odd.
---
Behold, the tools of creation
---
I'm 50 wins away from all 9 classes being golden. I dont have time for another 4500 wins!
---
Cards that were HoFed because they were ubiqutous bceause they were too strong and/or versatile make sense. Cards that were HoFed because they created stale, repetitive or broken gameplay or broke the class identity too much won't be. The power creep has made it so cards like Rag and Azure Drake won't be oppressive or auto-includes these days. Ice Block would still be just as broken as before.
---
People are sleeping on deathrattle hunter
---
Ehh, I spent the dust on crafting these and now they are being given out for free. That just rubs me the wrong way.
---
You wanna re read what I said?
---
&gt;This would be like making Lich King Arthas the Paladin alt hero. Yeah, he used to use the Light, but he sure as fuck isn't using it once he dons the Helm of Domination.
---
That makes it 70% less fun.
---
No, the one you get for the event is just a temporary copy that lasts the duration of the event. 
---
I cant wait for the posts after the event where people who disenchanted their cards complain when the temporary cards are gone after the event lol
---
Cards will be removed after the event is ended
---
&gt; This is a nerf to gold gain
---
Not for me it isn't.  I never re-roll a 60g quest.  I re-roll 50s to try to improve them to 60+ and that's it.
---
kalimos, rat trap, swamp king dred are up there
---
I pulled Ixlid, Twig, The Darkness, Lynessa and Rhok’Delar on Tuesday. I’m now missing only Togwaggle and Sonya.
---
No, they will disappear
---
Chill? I don't see anyone screaming, calling for the death of blizzard, or spewing profanity. I just expressed my opinion in a level headed manner.
---
I think the reason is because Jaina seems to have changed her spec from Arcane to Fire
---
If you plan to play highlander decks for a while, it's definitely worth the craft; It's by far one of the best card of the deck, if not *the* best card.
---
It did sound like that, but a Dev responded saying they go away. It's linked somewhere else in this thread.
---
LelianaD#2748 80g exchange EU
---
Uhhhh dude you expect me to dig out every single instance from the past 20+ years that Jaina has used a fire spell? Alright, you're just a salty boi.
---
yes
---
awooo \*wags tail\* OwO
---
Copy that thanks mate cause enjoy my wild games and that would've sucked
---
Do you think the “no duplicates” cards will be back because of the new legue?
---
&gt; This is why I fucking hate Hearthstone. The fans dont give a fuck about lore and will argue that breaking it is fine.
---
This is the funniest thing I've ever read.
---
Snip Snap, Barnes, Prince Keleseth, Aluneth, Devine Favor, Patches, Leeroy Jenkins
---
Aging is a hell of a nerf. Even more in real life.
---
Well everyone would be happy if they got a quality legendary that they didn't own, wether you can dust it or not, but you would probably be less than thrilled if you just grinded 1600 dust for it and don't get anything. But its a useless discussion because the developers are aware of this and won't do anything stupid.
---
[deleted]
---
In china yeap
---
This coming from captain clam? The CAPTAIN of clams? Hypocrite
---
huh, I did misread what you said. I'll admit fault with that then, my bad.
---
Damn, just uninstalled this game from my phone a week or so ago, too. Still have it on the computer, but I'm trying to limit my playtime. I think I only have two characters (rogue and warlock) that aren't over 1000 wins. Might have to check these out.
---
What about brawl, i gets disconnected when am trying to play a brawl game but queuing into rank or casual works without any issues.
---
Unfortunate
---
oooh Cube has to rotate in as well then I think.
---
They literally teased a new game mode - that was asked for
---
Gave us 1.000 wins rewards - that swear to god I've literally seen asked for in this sub
---
They organize an event that shakes the meta up - which is literally the most requested thing here
---
Oh and also giving away - probably only temporarily but still - free cards, which is a very neat thing, and 23 of them as well, so I don't get how can this sub still manage to bitch about everything
---
Dragon decks (namely paladin and priest) have been my favorite decks since I started playing and I'm sad that you cant play them in standard rn
---
dang dang
---
I am guessing these are only skins for the base heroes? It's sort of a shame, because my only 1000 win class is Warlock, but nothing and nobody can pry Nemsy out of my hands.  I would be over the moon for alternate-art Nemsy, but I'm sure it's more work than they want to do to update all 20+ heroes out there.
---
id love if valeeras was the demon hunter skin of her from hots. prolly wont happen but id love it
---
Quests are easier to nerf than Genn and Baku though.
---
I think the trap that people fall into (and I'm guilty of this too) is thinking they can outvalue the deck or run it out of cards. 
---
So, they play around MCT too much or they spend too much time trading into their little shit minions (trying to play around Mutate, Barista or Bog Boi).
---
If you have board control, smack them in the face and put the pressure on.
---
Sounds like moral failing on your part.
---
Do we know what happens with 100g quest? It sounds there are only going to be 2 buckets (50g and 60g). Are 80g and 100g quests gone?
---
F
---
I crafted N'zoth two weeks ago...
---
I don't know how to break this to you but lore is a complete afterthought in Hearthstone.  This is not the right place to come for WC lore.
---
There isn't a "right" and "wrong" there's just a "we want this".  In this case, they said "we want Hearthstone Jaina to be a fire mage" so they did.
---
Me too! I love the feel of a solid tribal deck. Dragon Priest and Elemental Mage are what I go to when I don't know what else to play.
---
Come on, Blizzard, just give us Rags and N'Zoth permanently.  What's the harm?  Both are in wild, and it's soooo hard to justify spending 1600 dust on a wild-only card.  And Rags in particular is one of the most iconic cards in Hearthstone history and has been HOF'd, so you can't ever get him from a pack.  
---
If you want to make the remaining 21 cards temporary, so be it.  Just give us all Rags!!!!  We deserve it!!!!
---
Same but its happening on desktop for me when am trying to play a brawl game . Don't know whats causing it cause i can queue into rank or casual games without any issues.
---
it’s not (dark) red though. It’s brown. Maybe from far away it appears red but take if you use one of those color extraction tools on that hair sliver, you’d get a brown.
---
I had been experimenting with a quest warlock that utilized a lot of deathrattle minions for betrug and dorian plays.
---
The main problem of the deck is living until lategame, but against stuff like control warrior it could have issues closing the game out. Even just having it in there as an option that I could draw before rafaam might be helpful. It should at least shore up the control matchups.
---

---
free reprints lets fucking go
---
927 wins as hunter, 982 as druid. I know what I'm playing next! 
---
(All classes are getting them right, not just these 3?)
---
On the other hand, 50 wins as rogue. Hopefully I don't want the portrait.
---
I thought it was because of demonic influence or something
---
Hopefully 1500 wins Gul'Dan is just his skull and some chaos crystals.
---
You care too much. It does not affect gameplay and you can choose to not use it. Take a break and do something you enjoy
---
I would’ve left it at 1234 for the simple smorc flavor
---
Uh.
---
We theory-crafted Highlander Hunter before the expansion even came out and changed three cards since.
---
Only ranked wins? Or just all in total?
---
Typical, when in doubt, just insult the other person.
---
Yes! I just recently got 1000 wins with Druid and couldn’t be more excited.
---
Is there anywhere to see what percentage of each set is seeing play in wild? I know some people track that for standard but haven't seen it for wild ever, kind of curious which sets did the best/worst.
---
Piloted shredder and haunted creeper
---
yes i would like 1 (one) Kazakus, please
---
Wow, these are wonderful additions. I can't wait to play with N'Zoth again. He made control decks so much better.
---
Was wondering the same. Assumed it would be ranked and arena like it currently is, but in the post they only said “1000 wins.” Would be kinda nice imo if it counted casual wins, I have 200 wins to go on Shaman and Druid to finish all gold heroes and I was looking forward to dicking around in casual and never laddering again (I’m sure this is not a popular opinion, it’s fine, I’m just saying it would be beneficial for me - don’t @ me)
---
Also they nerfed jaina again
---
Do you like to play with FIRE?
---
The 23 cards are reprint, it's likely they created a temporary set for the occasion.
---
That would work the same way as [[Annoy-o-Tron]] which exists in two versions with the only difference being the sets (GvG and Boomsday).
---
Hi, I haven’t played in nearly 4 years and want to get back into the game. Whats new that I need to know and what’s some good decks currently?
---
Characterizing Druid’s SoU set as one of the strongest ever seems a little off to me, especially when VS themselves highlights it’s comparative power to KFT. I think both sets are very powerful but KFT was stronger by far due to its versatility across archetypes. 
---
Druid’s most powerful SoU cards are pretty much only broken in a Quest Druid deck. If the Quest itself wasn’t viable, those cards on their own aren’t that busted. They’d still be good, but good enough for constructed? Maybe not. 6 mana heal for 12 or 6/6 Taunt and 5 mana 5/5 rush or x2 3x3 rush isn’t that good. 
---
Anubisath defender is the only one that jumps out as consistently powerful without the quest. 1 mana discover a choose one is meh. Crystal merchant is still good. Bees is fine but not busted. Overflow is very strong but not really performing right now. Also, None of the late game threats are Druid specific other than Cenarius and most aren’t even from SoU (Nomi, Maly, Cenarius, etc.)
---
Conversely, the KFT Druid cards were stupid powerful and could be slotted into any Druid build. Malfurion, Spreading Plague, and UI, for example, were core in Jade Druid, Maly Druid, and Token Druid. Those are completely different archetypes relying on the same core cards, whereas the SoU powerhouse cards are only good in Quest Druid. KFT also had archetype specific powerhouse cards like Druid of the Swarm, Crypt Lord and Hadronox. 
---
Both sets are undeniably powerful but I think KFT is still by far a stronger set given its versatility. This was made even more pronounced down the road by the busted cards from Kobolds (Spellstone, branching paths, Tyrant, etc).
---
It's not an entirely new game, MTG as a paper product dates back to 1993 with the original online client dating back to 2002.  I think both games can co-exist and learn from one another.
---
For example the monetization of MTGA makes Hearthstone look MUCH more friendly than it actually is, while I can only look at the many varied PvP game modes of MTGA with envy whenever I come back to play some Hearthstone.

2/1/2 Mech | Taunt Divine Shield  
---
N’zoth seems plenty strong with just Khartut Defender and Tirion from Zephyrs. Highlander decks can just fill out the missing slots with reasonable Deathrattle Minions.
---
Most of the legendary cards worth using are curve toppers in just about any deck that uses them, especially those from older wild sets.
---
Highlander decks cannot afford to play a deck with more than a handful of seven or higher cost cards.
---
Agree. Competition is always good. Too bad Artifact was a dud or this could have happened sooner.
---
[removed]
---
Free 9 portraits for me.
---
There used to be a secret quest that rewarded you old murk eye once you collected a copy of every murloc in the classic set. The same quest but with pirates used to give for free two copies of captain's parrot. They removed the quests when the cards were moved to wild because they didn't like the idea of a new player getting a wild card as a reward for collecting standard cards
---
Honestly the sky is the limit with what they could do provided the resources. Adapting the Arena's drafting mechanic to Solo adventures would be refreshing take, Bringing back build your own would allow a more satifaction towards building a collection. Adapting old adventures into the new dungeon run format as a "Free sampling" of the content would be exciting and could lead towards a more united world with the heroes and villains take on traditionally WoW environments.
---
I would love to see them go full mobile game with having a huge suit of stats and milestones, An adventure mode with reoccuring characters with both a richer in game economy but also more to do with your resources (Card Gilding, Rogue-like upgrades that are balanced by the ability to earn resources in the mode making it feel more like an investment, increase level caps with rewards tied to each set, Giving specific cards or rewards with wings closer to old adventures instead of packs)
---
I finally get to use my golden Nzoth in standard again I'm so happy
---
Well this kinda sucks for us arena players. I have over 7000 wins and no 500 portrait yet. Looks so cool, such a shame they won't retroactively give us those wins.
---
You can't have a negative opinion about something without getting "so upset" about it? That must be hard.
---
I've done K&amp;C, Monster Hunt, Dalaran Heist, and Tombs of Terror (the first two wings) all of which I found fun. The third wing's enemies just feel bad to play against, especially with Elise's decks.
---
No, we will be receiving temp copies for the duration of the event, outlined by a dev in this thread.
---
If you didn't care, you wouldn't have posted, that's my point. Anyway this is getting repetitive, gonna have to block you.
---
The deck actually has serious staying power with Bone Wraith and Khartut Defender. But it only has one big Swing Card in Kangor's Endless Army. N'zoth would not only bring back your eggs but it would refresh your defense as well. I've had so many games where I've survived onslaught after onslaught but just ran out of steam.
---
I even started running Abomination with Life Steal for extra defense, board clear, healing and face damage. N'zoth can revive them as well.
---
You can notice the green on his hands.
---
Temporary legendaries &gt; better deal than free dust? Really? Yes, for 2 weeks, standard is going to fun and after you would wish to get the free dust. And how much free dust is it even for people that own them already - 2 legionaries and 21 other cards that are probably going to be a combination of common, uncommoon and rare is going to be around 800+21x(around 40) - around 1600 dust. So for people who own these cards it is around 1600 dust and for new players it would be a bit more - probably 4000 dust of playable cards for them. 
---
Sorry but I think they have to be more generous. The twitch numbers are showing that the game is losing players much faster than gaining and I blame the economy for that. I get it - you are all downvoting me right now because a new announcement came and you are exited but around the start of the new expansion when you start trying to make new decks and have no gold/dust, you will be making the long posts about how you need freebies.
---
So you can only either not care at all, or be super upset about something? Wow

There is nothing to suggest they are cutting the 100g quest. They said *most* of the quests are in 50g or 60g buckets, which is true.
---
This would be quite sad for me because I had golden Kazakus and it was my fav card ever but I dusted my golden version because I play exactly zero wild games
---
Anduin looks way better.
---
It doesn't look like it. A community manager responded above.
---
They are giving everyone temporary Standard-usable copies. Wild copies are still Wild-only. These Standard copies disappear when the event ends.
---
Now, some have conjectured the temp cards will be golden. Since they disappear and can't be disenchanted, it seems plausible.
---
Raza?

True that, but knowing blizzard i have my fears. Nothing more.

Hey hdmi-dvi, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

Why would giving permanent free cards to everyone delete dust from people who already own them?
---
People downvoting a classic pasta. SAD!
---
You pointed out they used incorrect grammar, but you didn’t point out how to fix it. There’s a difference. If you just say “You used poor grammar” and you don’t tell them exactly what was poor, you look like an asshole. Constructive criticism is fine. What you did is not
---
That is purple not blue. The only thing blue is the orb in his hand and a bit in his beard. maybe a few tints on the edges of his armor... But his hat, his pauldrons, etc, they're clearly purple.
---
what did you use to cast it so many times?
---
That's not what opportunity cost is. The dust value of your cards is unchanged because there is no trading in hearthstone.
---
Looks like a female geralt of rivia casting igni.
---
I hate to say it, because I see Jaina being more frost-themed than fire anyhow, but that slots perfectly in the argument pro-fire, given the frost lich card.
---
They do have glowing eyes in their HS portrait, sure, humans don't have 24/7 glowing eyes. But it's possible for human mages to (temporarily) glow their eyes in Warcraft, most likely only for magic users (and Paladins), probably when they power up or get really serious.
---
Jaina used Fire when she was mentally completely shattered after Mana Bomb and furiously mad at the Horde and tortured every Orc she saw with Fire. It didn't happen often but when she feels like, she will use Fire. She is master with Fire magic as well, maybe even the best, who knows. Nothing is confirmed or explored on that part.
---
Thank you kind sir for defending my ignorance superbly.

Today is the 1.0 release. Everything up until today has been considered part of the beta.
---
Whats yorick doing here lmao

---
I stopped playing Warlock as much in ranked after I got my golden portrait just so I could work on other classes getting to 500. Now I'm glad that playing Warlock again will be rewarded as well!
---
dude, i hope you killed his skeleton minion with your spider first, and then hero powered +2 attack and hit him face. before you finished him with Deathwing. lol. coz that boss deserves some BM.
---
I can't wait to see how they did my boy the Green Jesus. I was thinking that they'd give him the same look as he has in BfA, but Thrall technically insn't a shaman anymore, so iunno. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Still, these are looking badass, and although I doubt I'll be able to grind them out in this lifetime, I'm happy that people who play this game for some long time are getting some love.
---
We need a lot of attention
---
It would also make anyone hesitant in crafting wild cards cause they could always wait till they rotate in for free.
---
Holy shit, redditor for 8 years and only 7 comments? 
---
I'm actually flattered you used one of them to call us dumbass nerds.

So only mage, warrior, and warlock are getting them?  Is this really happening? Anyone got a link to a legit blizz announcement?
---
Wow. Talk about timing. MTG’s Throne of Eldraine prerelease is this weekend and I was really about to just quit Hearthstone for good for Magic.
---
Out of the absolute blue Blizzard announces that they are adding something new that isn’t a run of the mill expansion/adventure. I’m in complete awe and excited to see something fresh like this happen.
---
I've also just returned the game after a long break. Here is my 50c.

* You can dust all your wild cards if you will play in standard only. I suggest you to start with legendaries first, then if you need more dust go for goldens, epics etc. 
---
* Be patient to find out the meta and make sure you attack to it.
---
* Do not watch meme streams (Brian Kibler etc.) and craft silly legendaries. ( My biggest mistake) 
---
* Go for your "easy to play" decks to start with. Could be aggro decks or your favourite class. 
---
* HSreplay is your friend. Embrace it. 
---
* You can now "copy a deck to hearhstone". Meaning you copy the definition from a website, and once you open your collection, you will be prompted with the question "do you want to create this deck?"

What I did was to build a zoo warlock because it is rather cheap, easy to navigate, and quite the remedy for cancerous meta. 
---
But of shameless plug but, here is a rather long game where I beat a quest shaman.

You can also check my twitch if you are interested in zoo warlocks. I just had a 11 game win streak from rank 3 to rank 1.

Well, if you really think about it, there's really no point in playing casual unless you care a lot about your ranking (sounds like you dont) and are testing a new deck recipe.  If your deck is not refined/complete, you won't get far enough up the ladder to where you face only oppressive decks every game anyways.
---
Just play ranked, rack up wins for each class, and dont give af about your actual rank. You still get casual fun, and get the rewards eventually.
---
oh yeah I gave it one try on heroic this time and im done for now. Maybe ill revisit it after all the wings are out.
---
But dont get me wrong, I am happy this one was more difficult. I appreciate the challenge.
---
Get bent, diamonds ARE a girl’s best friend
---
Yeah but golems ain’t
---
You're forgetting Luna's Boat Galaxy
---
That Jaina looks awesome
---
&gt;Rotating that often gets too expensive:/
---
I imagine they'd give full refunds for the cards rotating out, so if you're a budget player you can replace the cards one for one and still have the exact same sized standard collection.
---
If they treat it the same way as HOF, then it would actually make the game a lot cheaper.
---
ranked + arena

I figure that the OG League will be back. Elise? Neat. Sir Finley? Cool. Un’Goro Elise? Awesome. Brann? Fantastic! Reno? **Dear god no.**
---
I know that this is an unpopular opinion, but I despise OG Reno. It’s literally the only card in Hearthstone that tilts me. I don’t mind losing to anything else. But Reno? Ugh. If the deck with Reno survives to turn six and has Reno, chances are pretty good that they beat any tempo or aggro strategy. I quite like RNG in Hearthstone normally, but winning or losing to draw order RNG via Reno is just the worst. 
---
Yes, I could play slower control decks for a few weeks, so that the presence or absence of Reno doesn’t win or lose a game. But I prefer aggro and tempo decks, and even if I have a winning record against Reno decks the experience of “Well plaWE’RE GONNA BE RICH!” sucks fun out of the game for me to the point where I just don’t have any interest in playing. 
---
Normally, I much prefer Hearthstone to MTGA, but if OG Reno rotates in for the event I’ll just be sticking to MTGA until he’s gone. I don’t know if I can really express just how much I hate that card.
---
&gt;Maybe Jade stuff?
---
NO.  NEVER AGAIN.
