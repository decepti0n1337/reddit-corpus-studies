More importantly, it's a value effect. A big lategame value bomb may be great, but it's not going to help you beat aggro shaman.

not really. once you get the jist of it, its very much grind heavy. then after that when everyone is high, getting certain heroes literally can make you win the game so easily.

This is the first phonecall I've listened to where Hearthstone was brought up and talked about in a more negative light, as they said it explicitly said it endured another quarter of lower player activity/revenue. In previous phonecalls when Hearthstone didn't perform as well, they wouldn't even mention Hearthstone outside of a new expansion coming up, so I had to find that information exclusively from their Form-10Qs.
---
One of the investors actually asked J. Allen Brack to clarify the challenges Hearthstone was facing, which he responded with the rise in competitors and the addition of battlegrounds (plus maybe stuff in 2020) as means of getting new and existing players back into the game. I thought that was interesting. What could come in 2020? Another multiplayer mode? Another single player experience outside of Dungeon Run? Who knows. They have to use the added developers somehow. It could also be fluff and maybe we won't see another major addition in 2020.
---
As a whole, I think Blizzard is aiming for 2020 to be back on a year of growth, what with another expansion to WoW and potentially the sequel to Overwatch getting released.
---
You can't select these decks though. On mobile it's impossible. On PC I can play the last selected deck and it will ignore the fake incomplete status. But You can't select a new deck that has the incomplete status. You click on it and press no to the popup and that deck does not get selected.
---
But if you do the workaround thing and leave the deck selected it will stay selected (on PC) after restarting the app. So you can just press play and it will ignore.
---
I’m on the 6s and it works very well. The only thing I could complain about is that while looking at your hand, you can’t click the tavern tier up button and when looking at your notifications or control panel you might accidentally rearrange your minions because they kind of glitch out. For some reason, I haven’t been experiencing all these bugs that everyone’s complaining about.
---
Glad you people are voting with your wallets to keep things the way they are.
---
I beat this deck every time I play it and I play 4 different off meta decks. I always get excited when I see Druids. Free win. EZ clap!

Do you plan on adding achievements for wild or at least on opening up the deckbuilding/ladder/amazing plays for wild play?
---
I really like the app and had a blast with it in the single player modes, but as I'm mostly a wild player I can't earn achievements while laddering.

I was just playing this boss too. I somehow ended up milling him as Elise. He had that dragon that fully healed him and some other healing from random shit. Hit 10 fatigues before swapping stages. Elise eventually died to fatigue herself being up Reno. Gatling gun did 156 damage and I had his guy who casts spells twice. Turned into a pretty easy game.
---
This worked for some of my decks but not others. I think the case where you have one golden copy and one regular copy of a card and they are both in a deck is the case where it screws up the most.
---

On PC I've been getting graphics freezes since the Tombs of Terror patch. The game still functions - you can even continue playing the game if you click in the right places - but what the game displays on screen doesn't change until you close it.
---
I too like to collect the salt!
---
Have enough cards been released to even answer this?
---
Aren't those bits plastic? I find it hard to believe that can be used as a weapon.
---
Hmm, it was not a question based on the cards, 'cause as said above, I asked about the bundle itself, as other's expansion's bundles, this one's a bit different.
---
Can you provide a decklist? Also, how long did it take to make it work?

---
Ok this is quite likely the worst video I've ever seen on this sub.
---
Yep, it sure did happen
---
They are too busy counting money from all the preorders to care.
---
Yeah for real. All the streamers are going hard on it at the start, but I have a feeling that people will catch up to their skill level very quickly. I would honestly say that a lot of the streamers who have been playing since release are already skill-capped. The thing is, they're constantly going against fresh blood because once you figure out how to play Battlegrounds it's not long before you no longer want to play Battlegrounds. 
---
There is no aggro, control, or combo in this game mode. It's just midrange vs midrange but you can't pick your trades which is about 99.99999999% of the skill involved in midrange mirrors. It's literally like playing Arena with a permanent Mayor Noggenfogger effect. Even the positioning basically boils down to "least valuable minion on the left, most valuable on the right."
---
People really seem to over-value the strategy in the midgame too. The majority of the time it's just the people who didn't get Nightmare Amalgams trying to survive against the people who got Nightmare Amalgams until they can make their own Nightmare Amalgam build. By focusing on the midgame people ignore the fact that every **winning** strategy is exactly the same. Massive poisonous divine shield minions, either with a snowballing card on the right side (Junkbot, Hyena) or not. If they do have a snowballer on the right side, they instantly lose the game if it gets sniped at the start. Otherwise it's a game of whose 40/40 poisonous divine shield loses its divine shield first before being attacked by a poisonous divine shield. 
---
Sure there's some skill in recovering yourself in the midgame when you didn't get "the" build, but that's ignoring the fact that generally someone does get "the build" without even really trying and they get fast-tracked to the Top 3. And once there are 3-4 people left in the match, the endgame really is about as complex as pachinko.

I don't really see this being a combo unless you were already running these cards anyway. Two card, 10 mana combo, that uses a legendary. Seems like Warrior has better clear options. Maybe it becomes a thing if we got an extremely greedy meta.
---
Someone in another thread said that it only counts the most recent stream you have opened as eligible for the drop.
---
Best workaround I've found is going to the editor, choose the deck with missing card(s), click the card that is missing so it shows the replacement cards, then back out to your deck list and click on the deck again. It should populate correctly after that. Unfortunately, this must be repeated every time you open HS.

Likewise, I prefer SoU over a number of previous sets.
---
But when Twitch viewership was quite low in the expansion month of August, I had a feeling that it wouldn't perform as well as Boomsday since I have found Twitch viewership to be a leading indicator of how well a expansion does with respect to previous expansions.
---
Because I couldn't care less about ranks in Hearthstone. After reaching legend once there are no worthwhile rewards to pursue.
---
I'm not sure I buy into how he's selling the competition as the reason for losing numbers. MtGA has been big over the past year, but 3 years ago Gwent was also supposed to be big, and HS crushed both it and Shadowverse together.  Maybe MtGA is much better than those two combined, and that's the difference, but I wonder how MtGA would have fared 3 years ago against HS. Most likely better than those two, yet maybe not anywhere near as much as now. All speculation though, so I don't feel certain about claiming the competition is worse now than in the past. Non-CCG games were definitely bigger in the past, like the Fortnite/Battle Royale craze, but I'm skeptical that hits the same gaming demographic.
---
I would however join in on the bet that the support from Blizzard on the new stuff won't be sufficient. Blizzard just doesn't like seizing the reins of their games and forcing through aggressive changes on a meaningfully fast cadence. So the games get stale. They want to sit out, wait until numbers begin falling, *and then* release something new. It's like they have a limited budget on ideas and need to save them for when they're drowning under stormy weather, instead of keeping waters calm by preemptively investing in an evolving product that has an easier time buoying player retention.
---
When I look at SC2, OW, HS, I really think PoE and LoL are in the right for being run with a more forthcoming attitude to releasing radical new ideas and strongarming frequent balance changes. It needs to be adapted for the genre, but the general philosophy I like.
---
Plus I can't help but feel if HS esports had been nurtured more attentively, that would have gone a long way to sustaining interest in the scene/game.
---
Well, maybe Blizzard's approach will work its way out. I guess we will know by next year how things are doing. It will be interesting to see the scale of the supposed innovations further down the pipeline, considering this Blizzcon passed on covering them. Maybe they're not set for 2020.

I was playing arena at 2 losses as warlock vs druid. I was at 3hp and behind on board so I decided to suicide using my felfire potion. The game crashed during the felfire animation and stayed stuck at ''Trying to reconnect'' for a long while (there was obviously no game to reconnect to) and I was unable to do anything in game. After the wait I got an ''Unable to reconnect'' popup and was able to enter the client. When I went back into the arena I was still at 2 losses, the game didn't count.

I heard that having mutiple streams open doesn't do anything extra since only your most recent opened stream counts as the one you are viewing (and is visible to your friends if you have that enabled)
---
I watched Kripp for like 10 mins then got it too
---
You list "features" that nobody really needs.
---
Replays? Why would I care to watch my game's replay? Why would I care to watch someone's else? I don't have time to complete daily quest, why would I waste it for replay? Just throw me a funny clip from stream instead.
---
Achievements. It requires interface overhaul to make work for mobiles, seems like an intimidating mess to walk through (see WoW achievements) and the biggest probles is that achievements are one time use. You get one, you forget about it.
---
Turning off emotes. It is another one checkbox no one wants to add to the game's options to not clog it with unnecessary things.
---
Search filters. They add new ones from time to time.
---
Daily login rewards. See how miserable you would become if you had to miss several days a week not logging in. They could add it easily but made a conscious decision not to. It makes more feel bads for general player base than it rewards them. Personally, I would hate to log in each day just to not miss out. FOMO is bad.
---
Match history. Another button in interface that will be used by 1% of player base.
---
Just get over it, your needs have lesser priority than you might think.
---
Rip XD. I have a question, if your minion has taunt, do you the enemy minions have the kills it first or does that not matter?
---
Dat bm emote at the end though
---
BRUHHHHH
---
Taunt applies but there are some sniper units that can go around.
---
You’ll get to play soon man, maybe blizzard just doesn’t want as many suggestions because I’m sure they’ll get enough
---
If you are a new player, join in April so you have a fresh rotation.  Then buy every expansion for 2 years, and now you can start playing the game.  I'm only half joking.  It's literally what I did, and this is the very first time that I can play more than one tier 1 deck in a season.
---
Not if you are nefarian

Blizzard has cut back on QA (and other non-developer departments) largely on the backs of Activision-Blizzard pushing them to cut costs.
---
[First it was quietly done throughout 2018](https://kotaku.com/with-activisions-influence-growing-blizzard-is-cutting-1831263741), where some employees "took buyouts thanks to the Career Crossroads program that allowed QA, customer service, and IT employees to voluntarily leave." 
---
[Then it was again in February of this year](https://kotaku.com/the-fallout-of-activision-blizzard-s-massive-layoffs-1832597892) when Blizzard implemented massive layoffs. "Support teams had been gutted. The layoffs were largest in non-development departments like IT and QA, according to those who were there."

You know what sucks!!

don't start on this game

It was an incentive for preordering the new expansion or participating in blizcon either in person or w a virtual ticket. It’s pretty smart on their part as that ensures their core fan base feels rewarded for supporting them. Can kinda view it either way - cash grab to those that may not be cross pollinating across all bliz product or a small reward for those that do.

Yea like all of my decks are now missing like 2 cards each because of this bug, I’ve fixed them once but I got back on and they were still all goofed you &gt;:(

---
My statement stands, despite people who don't know what they are talking about downvoting me.
---
Earnings is not profit.

And you can't break down how much of that is hearthstone related.
---
Thus, any conclusion on the **profit** is nothing but speculation.
---
It's also funny how upvoted OP is because it fits the narrative of the entitled community, but she still hasn't given a source to back up her claims. While posts that question it are downvoted. Like questioning it shouldn't be downvoted, even if I'm wrong. That just shows they are close-minded and aren't actually interested in facts.
---
that's what happens when you give some people early access to the game. Some people have dozens of hours of experience before others even get to play their first game.
---

Ah yes thats what i overlooked ty
---
Wild doesn't exist
---
It was so obviously false that i can't believe it wooshed you. I legitimately can't believe you took the phrase 'it was nerfed so quickly it fell out of meta before the nerf came in' as being literal.

---
Guess from now on we should snap concede everytime we hit 10..
---
This is why we can't have nice things
---
While the game is certainly expensive and massively overpriced, that cannot possibly be the reason for the decline. The price isnt exactly new, its been pretty much the same since the begging and the people who arent willing to pay it (presumably the vast majority) have been fine with playing the game without paying the cost or having as many cards. Just a year ago the mid year expansion showed player growth, despite the same massive prices. 
---
The reasons for such things are always very hard to determine. Personally i'd speculate on the games age making it that people are simply getting their fill of the game, just like they do with any game, and so the game going fro ma growth phase to a stabilization one. Naturally it would stabilize somewhere way lower than its highest point.
---
I disagree with adding unobtainable Heroes / Card Backs back to shop so people can buy them. Even though I missed some of them, I don't think that time exclusives should come back in one form or the other.
---
Or let me explain it further. I do agree with bringing back Tyrande, because the initial promo was not available in most of the world - Twitch Prime was limited to a few countries at the time. Which just wasn't fair. Most of players who were playing game at the time simply couldn't get it without "cheating" (creating a fake address). So that's why I agree with Tyrande making a comeback.
---
But stuff that everyone could get at the time, but you decided not to (or you weren't playing at the time), should stay exclusive IMO. For example, Heroes we're getting at the start of every Standard year. Or Heroes you get with pre-purchase bundles. If you can buy them, they won't feel special or unique, which is the main reason we're getting alternative Heroes / Card Backs in the first place. 5 years from now, when you play as  Maiev, your opponent will know that you've been playing the game for way too long for your health. But if you could just buy her - meh.

Just keep playing. Finish every quest, your decks will improve slowly and also your game play. You are making lots of mistakes you dont even know. Beat all the bots at easy and hard then start pvp.  
---
When you get a free ticket, try arena. It's a very equal playing field as everyone builds a deck from offered options; in pvp you are competing with bigger collections. Though you should be rank 50 so should be facing off against other beginners. Just have fun. Like most gaming subreddits this one is pretty full of negativity but there is lots of fun to be had if you just play. I'd say just improve your decks gradually for the first weeks based on your own guesses of what seems good and seems bad. This will teach you more than anything. Only start looking at suggested decks once you've done a lot of your own messing around and discovery or your learning curve will be stunted.
---
Download and try it.
---
You're being downvoted because this whole thing has been talked about enough, it's been beaten to death and there's nothing new to talk about, yet we still see this exact post every day. This is also a cardgame subreddit, spamming it doesn't actually help HK or anything

---
I had a run where my entire board was golden, including mama bear and the wolf! It was super fun
---
That’s true to a certain extent, I don’t dispute that but
---
Part of skill required in making your deck work is making the best out of the (potentially bad) cards you’re given. With enough foresight, I’m pretty sure any deck can make it to a solid 8 wins regardless of RNG, and there are only *that* many situations where a game is outright unwinnable if both players are if the same skill
---
Constructed is somewhat RNG too, though. Discover is the pinnacle of RNG, your opponent *could* discover a theoretically ‘perfect’ card in a situation where he or she doesn’t have an answer. This is the reason why decks with a 55-60% win rate are already considered meta, the fact that the deck is optimised to a point where it can overcome most odds and have good matchups against other decks shows that despite potentially terrible RNG, it still has a good chance of winning
---
Note how I mention the word ‘potentially’ and ‘could’ here? Luck will always be prevalent in games; without luck, they’ll have fixed ‘solutions’ once the meta has settled, something that no one wants. Take the game tic tac toe or connect 3 for example, anyone above the age of 10 should be able to execute perfect strategy and win if they start first. If they don’t, they can very easily draw the game if both players know exactly what they’re doing. That sounds incredibly unfun and linear, and is exactly the opposite of modern games should look towards
---
Hahahaha ... the BM is for people like you.

That's great it works for you, but I can add two anecdotes of a friend and coworkers who quit after realizing the amount of money/time they would need to spend to build a decent collection. People are being turned off, the question is how many.
---
Nice
---
They’re just not inspired enough it seems
---
At least. I cant play at all on ios. Keeps crashing when booting the game.
---
Its a small indie company what do you expect
---
Any other start of turn effects that might have shuffled a card into your deck? Seems plausible that the power just moves the chosen card to the top of the deck for the natural draw to later pick up. In that case, it'd be lost if the deck was then shuffled.

It's a refreshing new mode, especially if Constructed or Arena have gotten stale for you. All the streamers seem to love it. Toast likes it so much he's considering coming back. Rdu thinks Battlegrounds is the best of the auto-chess games, and I must say I agree with him. It's simple enough to understand, but every game is different, which is good because otherwise it would become really repetitive. You can try it for free on Tuesday.

He should be a 3 mana with the same battlecry but instead of a spell you can get to create your own minion.

This is from their In The Works series they published on their official blog:
---
&gt; The implementation we’d arrived at catered to a very specific audience of players. Instead of broadening Hearthstone with an exciting new way to play, it felt “tacked on”, and wasn’t integrating well into the larger Hearthstone experience.
---
&gt; Ultimately, we were forced to conclude that we needed to think about how and where we want to improve Hearthstone’s overall social experience before we can tackle adding a satisfying and robust implementation of In-game Tournaments that all players can enjoy. As developers, sometimes we have to make the difficult decision to step away from a design that isn’t working. We no longer felt that the end result would deliver on everyone’s expectations or the high standards we have for Hearthstone.
---
&gt; As a result, while we want to revisit In-Game Tournaments at a later date, the feature is on hold for the foreseeable future.
---
Based on their statements from the phonecall where they highlight the potential for Battlegrounds to bring new and returning players to the game, it seems they pushed Battlegrounds because it appealed to more people.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
The game is not even out, literally is in closed beta, and you are complaining already about balance patch cadence?
---
Like, even if the meta was already figured, it doesnt matter. The point now is to see how the game goes, bugs, and feedback. They will tune it down and decide how much do they change and update the mode in the future, once they actually get the data from this closed beta.
---
Just wait!
---
It is linked and I have drops enabled in my settings per every guide I read about it. What I want to know is how would I know when I earned a drop? Nowhere mentioned what the process for collecting a drop looks like. Is it automatic, do I have 5 seconds to click something? Will my adblocker prevent it if I do have to click something?

afraid not, doesnt look like you can gift it
---
Dude, the new hero looks sick, the cards look great and have a high power level too, and the preorder is a great value, 80$ for 100 packs. If you’re surprised to see people supporting a game, while YOU’RE playing said game, you’re insane. Sure these bugs are annoying but we all know they won’t last and not taking advantage of the bundle because you’re upset about some bugs, (something that is far from the norm btw at least on PC) is just silly if y actually like HS

Comment actually was inspired by the post

For sure, but the state of Hearthstone on iOs and Android is poor and it turns away users new and old. Game neeeds a big overhaul for stability.

The game was out since 2014, it's just another mode in it. And they have a very bad track record when it comes to speed and agility.
---
Made up problems no. 787
---
Honestly if i want the golden Galakronds ill make them and if i'm right there is supposed to be 2 more made + i only would want the golden versions of priest and rogue galakrond
---
No one still cares about control warrior. The deck is fine.
---
You think he is red? I'd say Kazakagos is more likely, myself.

Most / least used tribe (achievement - (tribe)master)

That just hit my brain.
---
What a top deck draw lmao
---
People still complaiming about all quest decks doesnt make any sense most of them arent op
---
Good ideas! You can also add some things like "minion that dealt the most damage in one battle / run" and things like that :)
---
This is the "differentiated experience" they were talking about in the Q3 earnings call.
---
This is the new Battlegrounds game mode. It’s hearthstone’s take on auto-chess.  Currently in beta and can be played by those who preordered the new expansion.  
---
You and 7 other players go into the game mode and draft cards and arrange them between matches before going into battle. Once in the battle, the auto part takes over and the minions just duke it out.  Clear all their minions, and you get to damage the opponent. Damage stays with you from match to match.
---
Don’t really know much else about it as I’ve never played but that’s the gist. For more info check out /r/bobstavern
---
I think people are more upset that it means that historic is going to be a completely ignored format and that WOTC is not thinking long term in terms of support for their new flagship program. It's just bad decision making.
---
I want a good amount of the expansion if I'm going to pay triple A price.
---
That said, all you've done is misinterpret what I've said, insulted me, brushed me off as 'entitled', told a bunch of lies and treated me with utter contempt. Excuse me for not wanting to continue to converse with you. Going to block you and talk to friendlier people. Cheerio.
---
The number of overly sensitive people in this thread taking this interesting little factoid as some affront that the game is too expensive is way too high
---
Yeah this isn't the way HS's economy works.  Dust is a backup currency to opening cards directly.
---
I found that just dragging the greyed out card from the deck to collection and back fixes it without having to add and remove the card. Just don’t lift your finger when you do it.
---
I love how creative blizzard is with their murloc language. I mean, what other insane language than the murlocs would have Wasserschleppende in their vocabulary
---
I was bored and I’ve played Starcraft 2 casually every now and then and in Battle Net I saw hearthstone and figured I’d give it a try
---
&gt;	TBH I think most games should just add something small to differentiate the original exclusive from the more readily available one
---
Yep, this is the move. We figured this out way back when Magic started becoming big - reprints of valuable cards were heavily desired but also feared because they would tank the value of the card for people who already own it.
---
So the solution is to differentiate ‘print runs’. Maybe my Tyrande is gold since it’s a ‘first run’ (original promo), while the guy who just bought her from the store gets a non-golden version. 
---
Could do the same with all the past seasonal card backs, just put a small detail on the ‘original’ earned ones (maybe the HS symbol is shiny or spins or something) and then let people buy the regular ‘second print’ version.
---
Best of both worlds.
---
They should do a cycle of the Big Dragon Bois but have them act as transforming cards (using the mechanic of the awful, unplayable werewolves of the Witchwood Expansion), but well done!
---
Have them like flip from 4 mana versions of their human form and 8 mana version of their dragon forms and have some cool effects and shit
---
In this meta, you'd be crazy not to run silence with Khartut Defenders as far as the eye can see.
---
This is by far the worst bug I’ve dealt with.  I never DE my gold cards so a third to half of my decks are gold and I have to basically rebuild the entire thing every time I play.  I really hope this gets fixed on next weeks patch.
---
That seems like Blizzard trolling everyone. If the timer ends kill the animation and move on
---
I play Emperor decks all the time and he rarely survives more than a turn. This is definitely the rate-limiting step of the deck.
---

---
but Hellfire can't stop a board of big minions.  Frost Nova completely neutralizes the board no matter what size minions you have.  Sure it doesn't kill them, but your chance of keeping a board for two turns is already so low that freezing them might as well be the same.
---
Nice!
---
And the new players?
---
I keep both copies and never have had this happen. Confirmed I guess?
---
Yeah I like murlocs with shudderwock. Double Battlecry on coldlight seer is disgusting. If you throw in an amalgam and a good beast like direhorn, you can double up the menagerie buff guys and just have a bunch of huge dudes. If you're lucky enough to get a megasaur the double Battlecry is game winning.
---
Ding Ding, we have a winner!
---
Apparently it's pretty easy to add new cards to Arena, and half of them are already on Arena.  If they want to phase into Pioneer over the next year or two then that would be fine.  Just add a new set backwards when they add a new set forwards or something.
---
The only time I tried Jaraxxus so far I found out I was competing with four other Demon players and they were getting all the cards I needed. Can't believe I ended up in such a weird lobby for that one game.
---
Który od zawsze próbował przejąć tytuł Króla Lisza
---
Hadn't heard that yet! Are your card choices tied to the other players? So if player A takes your Amalgam, is there one less Amalgam in the pool for you to potentially draft?
---

---
It’s what you get for playing Bolster in any deck.
---
I mean, at this point you could just make a convincing Photoshop
---
No, because they both say you're Battlecry triggers twice. It doesn't say it triggers an extra time, just that it triggers twice. So having Bran with shudderwock doesn't help because your Battlecry will already trigger twice.
---
Thanks for the tip, I have added their hero powers to the list.
---
I took 2nd when I had 4 last night, so nope. Necessary.
---
He's just standing incredibly still
---
Here's a better combo using the same cards in one turn instead of 2.    
---
Turn 8:    
---
Spirit of the shark - 1, 4 mana left.   
---
Skulker - 2, 0 mana left.     
---
6 coins - 8, 6 mana left.    
---
Shadow step - 9, 6 mana left.    
---
Skulker - 10, 4 mana left,
---
6 coins - 16, 10 mana left
---
Skulker - 17, 4 mana left.    
---
Spectral - 4 mana left, 34 damage
---
6 coins -
---
This loses to mechs.
---
That 400 is reduced to near 100 very quickly because of duplicates, after you open a few packs.  Either way, $25k is still a bit, for a child’s card game.
---
I rub Nutella on Rhonda rousey
---
so only around 2588 packs if you don't include duplicates, and here I thought it was going to take a lot of packs
---
Renos will spiele nicht. 😂
---
I find that a quick reach around solves the problem quite nicely.
---
Yeah it took mtg years to make a decent game.
---
the problem with the argument is that it's always coming from people on the same side technically (consumer vs business) so the argument get's divided into opposed and apologists
---
truthfully though the pack system in general is just horrible, I'm glad that the league one is moving away from it for monetization
---
Got a spreadsheet on how much it would cost to collect every single card ever released in Magic: The Gathering?
---
Yeah I didn't play for like 8 months and now I can't do shit without paying 200 dollars for new packs lol
---
I'm encountering a battlegrounds bug where I get second place a lot. It seems to happen quite a bit when I spend 2-3 turns re-rolling the tavern looking for Mama Bear or Foe Reaper. Love the new mode, just gotta iron out those minor bugs that are causing me to not be the best player in every lobby.
---
Thats kind of what I figured. So im assuming that 60 per expansion will set you up pretty well with something to build around as you play each tier? Not super cheap but could be worse. Thanks for the info.
---
Ye. I miss some ranked plays, it's BG everywhere.
---
Omg my free game doesn't give me 100% if the content for free?! Reeeeeeeeee!!!!1
---
yeeeeeeeee
---
Is it me or has the interval between expansions significantly shortened? Just as the meta is defined there's a brand new expansion. I'm just going to buy classic packs with gold at this rate
---
So you think that less than 10 people per year pick up the game and stick with it?
---
I don't get this, i saw you were pretty informed about this, could you please explain this to me...do i need to just buy-open 30 packs in total, or do i need to open 20-30 packs of each expansion.    
---
Could you please tell me which expansion do i need to open packs from in order to unlock the third hero? 
---
I have around 3k+ gold...is that enough?
---
Lol how many customers do you think McDonald's gets a day, 16?
---
Happened to me too. Why tho?
---
I've quit HearthStone while the Hong Kong debacle, didn't like their answer with Blizzcon.
---
I mean that's kind of the tradeoff with hearthstone, you're trading novelty and the ability for resale for a shit ton of convenience.

I play mill rogue just to watch all the P2P players get thier combo decks destroyed with every coldlight seer I play and then die to fatigue, mwahaha

I currently think amalgam is offered to early and not really all that strong. If you had fewer turns you could buff it, it would be fine. If it was offered at tavern level 3, it would be weaker, and tavern level 4, probably unplayable.  I think Beasts and mama bear in particular are too powerful. Whoever gets those first just wins.
---
One of the players as to be down to at least 15health, just like on the friendly matches for 80g.
---
For sure, I know precisely who is going to write arguments defending it to the point where there's really no point in arguing since neither person is going to change their position.
---
Getting the ability to choose between 3 heroes requires you to OPEN (not buy, just open. meaning this includes free packs given to you by Blizzard) 20 packs. The special reward for opening an additional 10 packs (so 30 in total) is just access to new emotes, which are useless.
---
So if you want to have access to 3 heroes, you will need to open 20 packs. Blizzard gave us 11 or 12 free Saviors of Uldum packs during launch, meaning you will only need to open about 9 or 10 packs on your own. I would budget around 1000 gold at the start of each expansion to open packs, if you always want to have enough for Battlegrounds extras.
---
Same could be said about mech and demon synergies. You need to make your board op op. I honestly think mechs are the strongest and beasts the weakest
---
Thanks for the post. Now this looks like an article a gaming forum would pick up

The gold I spent for the last adventure was a total waste.  Those things suck, and since they don't give new cards anymore, what's the point for a f2p player like myself? Not making that mistake again.

---
Preach baby

Tavern brawl has a single pack reward and then experiences a significant drop off in returning players.  Most PVE content doesn't get replayed once all the rewards are achieved.  Time will tell but I don't think a long battlegrounds game for only 1/3 of a 10g (in a win) will keep the player base engaged long-term. 
---
A buy-in is one idea. But even just making it 30g for 1st, 20g for 2nd, 10g for 3rd/4th or something like this is necessary long-term once the shininess wears off.
---
"Don't you guys have iPhoneX?" ~Blizzard
---
I'm F2P and have been able to play competitively every expac. I buy all adventures in gold. I usually have anywhere between 10-20k gold ready to buy packs. I currently have around 10k dust and if I disenchanted my extra cards I'd get another 15k dust.
---
For f2p, you basically had to grind arena to save up 10k+ gold and and dust for each expansion, which is still true
---
no problem
---
Good
---
On the one hand, a wild card minion is a pretty no-brainer inclusion in a set that relies on multiple different synergies and adds an element of flexibility; on the other, it is of course very powerful. Dota Auto Chess got around it by making the wild card both rare and more expensive than other units, but Hearthstone BG doesn't have different costs.  
---
I wonder if just bumping it up to tier 4 will make it less of an issue. I know if I see one in the late game when boards are getting huge I'll sometimes skip it because I feel like there's no longer opportunity to buff it up big enough to matter.
---
A blizzard that is both unchallenged and growing, sure, but the last quarterly report shows YoY players is down. If I could get some of the Dailey gold cap through Battlegrounds instead of ranked, I would be more likely to stay playing.

Canceling your support for an American company that nominally supports China to instead support a company that is literally 100% owned by China to own the libs
---
i'm at work currently but later I'll open the game and there are dozens of cards that where the card a) never fit into any deck meta relevant or not and b) would almost always be picked last when presented as an arena option. if the card can't even be used in a meme deck or in a gamemode where the point is to use lesser cards then it serves no purpose
---
Sorry... i maths dumbo.  Walk me through with it. 
---
i get it the 8 is the draw eight cards but what of the other digits?  How did that come about?
---
F2P btw
---
I really enjoy battlegrounds, but I'm just burnt out on them already. Three real builds, big mechs with junkbots, big demons with the 1/1 that scales, or big beasts with bears. Didn't get those scaling cards? Good luck and hope your opponents rng'd worse.
---
well it is unplayable
---
it lacks fundamental function.
---
lmao.. no way.  They make so much money from packs.
---
I'd put AFK in Tier S, not because she's great at winning, but it's almost impossible not to top4 with her, and she wins a decent amount of the time as well.  Guaranteed top4 is pretty nice.
---
Can you announce the winners here? i'm prob gonna forget to check discord.
---
When has hunter been God tier? Even face hunter was a b tier deck IIRC
---
And then we wouldn't have the game. It's a ccg. It's very cheap for a ccg. Very few ccgs even come close to the level of hearthstones polish. It took Magic, a card game archetype that's old enough drink, to even remotely touch hearthstone. 
---
I really hope more games like MTGA comes out. More competition is the cure to this, not some monetary scheme that won't work for very obvious reasons.
---
I've been playing since BRM and I occasionally stop playing for a few months at a time. Just coming back from that is rough, I typically have to disenchant some sub-par legendaries and epics just to get one or two viable decks made.
---
original Arena died years ago when they added rotation and buckets.
---
How is this new?
---
Blizzards been pushing us to spend large amount of coins to win HS since it came out.

What’s invoke?

Undertaker Hunter back during Naxx. Arguably the most oppressive deck in HS history. And it was Tier 1 for Spell-hunter and Mech-hunter somewhat recently.
---
You either got a Twitch drop or you had a BlizzCon virtual ticket

I contacted blizzard support- they helped me and it’s fixed

Yeah ok, keep on with the hyperbole and NOT playing the game that you are no doubt playing.
