I'm pretty sure the joke is that that was the Vargoth'd version of the spell and so it was just chosen randomly

I hooe they'll stick with dragons. I liked the old style Pala Murloc, but for them to go that route gaain, they'd basically need to throw aside both the Healadin and Draco Pala that have been set up the last two expansions, which still needs some key stuff to function. Let Murlocs stay with Shamans for the time being, and let's have some stuff that Paladin needs now, even if Finley might end being the Pala hero.

When do we get more card reveals? Anyone know?

Blizzard really wanted Raze to win this one, they rigged the RNG in his favor and even gave him a tie when he was about to lose.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind that, it‚Äôs the ones I‚Äôve see actually use up their mana and then sit and let the rope go, turn after turn.

It's pretty hard to be blunt in the internet since texts are easily misinterpreted without facial cues, tones, or gestures. So even if a you wanted to sound neutral and blunt, it came out negative and insulting.

I pretty don't call out people replying negatively to a comment that is already negative, sometimes people need positivity but other times they respond better to some negativity.

Maybe I‚Äôm just getting unlucky this weekend. Thanks.

Same here with priest in wild. I gave it a shot today after 3-4 weeks, and who would've known it was big priest.
---
&gt;So question is : we're in 2019, OW is paying respects to the Blizard game customisation legacy.
---
Or, y'know, they finally learned from other MOBAs getting huge spikes in popularity due to user created modes like Auto-Chess, and realized their game was going to get left behind if they didn't follow suit. 
---
It's really hilarious how long it's taken them to learn that, considering the entire MOBA genre began as a custom game from Warcraft/Starcraft. Imagine if they'd gotten on that trend at the beginning.
---
I think for rise of shadows they teasing quite a few extra cards before the two week reveal. Not seeing quite as many right now and it makes me sad :(

Exactly, if I offered 80g to someone and they didn't concede right away, I'd ask someone else. OP is a dick...

They also play coldlight oracle sometimes for fatigue lethal.

The problem right now is elysiana remove the fatigue win condition. Nerfing it to 9 mana basically does nothing, card is just bad design.
---
Its 1680 gold tho since midsummer gave double quest rewards
---
I guess I understand where they come from. The card packs are basically paying money for a chance of getting something good so it's kind of gambling.
---
F O O L...
---
Buying packs is basically gambling as you're putting in money to play at chance for a prize, in this case being rarer cards. If it's a religious viewpoint then it'll be something they will very strictly keep to, these are the principles they base their entire life and/or existence on so oftentimes it will seem extreme if you look in from the outside. Best just to respect their choices in my opinion.
---
Not Muslim, but there isn't any gambling in the game. Unless you count buying card packs. I also can't recall any depictions of gambling in the cards but its possible
---

What about using in game gold?

On the contrary, Hearthstone developers censor female characters; covering their cleavage or changing the art altogether. They are making the game less sinful day by day. Amen.
---
Arab here, there is a huge player base in the Middle East (Mostly Muslims) for all kind of games with micro transactions including Hearthstone, Iv never heard of people not playing these games (which are most games right now) because of "gambling".

Would it not make sense to draw the line at the definition of gambling?
---
"The activity of betting money, for example in a game or on a horse race" (Cambridge dictionary)
---
If you accept a different definition then that's your choice but we really don't need to consider where we draw the line when we have definitions which do this for us.

Frodan's job isn't to be educational, it's to provide entertainment. An important part of this is helping the other caster look good. He very much brings things up and asks questions that prompt the other caster, and there's nothing wrong with that.

You're still putting money into a game which provides a random prize. Whether or not you think digital content holds value to you may be a personal thing, but that doesn't change what you're doing. In fact, many games which have heavy RNG mechanics such as F2PMMOs and CCGs see a lot of account selling so I would absolutely argue that a legendary card would be worth more than a rare as this has a higher real-world value if I were to sell on my account. 
---
You won't see TCGs grouped with traditional "casino" card games because they're intrinsically different. You're not required to gamble for playing TCGs (you can buy many sets which remove the gambling element such as starter/trial decks- with which you get the same product every time) whereas traditionally the "casino" card games are entirely centred around gambling. There's no prize involved when playing a game of yugioh, unless you specifically add gambling to your gameplay though no matter the stake in a game of poker, you have no way to guarantee you winning the pot. That depends entirely on cards drawn at random and the input other players have on the table.
---
As for movies, there's no variation between buying the same movie on DVD twice. You have two, practically identical DVDs if you buy two. There's no random prize when the outcome is assured to be the same product every single time.
---
I agree with you, if you spend money in a video game, you absolutely should know what to expect. But you don't, because you're playing RNG with this game for the cards you get out of packs.
---
There used to be a lot of this kind of thing years ago - that was so perfectly done. Actual nostalgia for early Hearthstone.

The mechanic to discover random cards is not the problem. The pool of cards, which can be discovered is the real issue. Magic trick discovers a mage spell with a mana cost of 3 or less. There are not too many spells within that range, so Frost Nova is a common result. I play cyclone mage myself, but the effect of cyclone itself rarely gives me Frost Nova. Magic trick on the other side does it very often. The same goes for omega devastator. Because he is a class card, he is more likely to pop up because the discover mechanic favors class cards. I am a bit tired of people demanding to HoF every card they don't like. Why not reduce the game to vanilla minions only? Maybe we should start to question the mechanics itself, and not cards (don't get me wrong, some cards needed to be removed from standard).
---
Including the destroy demon one?
---
Yes This is Big Brain Time!
---
Frost nova? I have a much bigger issue with 1 mana (easily reduced to zero) twinspells which can freeze a minion and still play into the spell generation mechanic of the deck...
---
I try to keep only one slot open. That way, I can always re-roll a 50g quest. I have seen a few 60g lately, but the 100g remains elusive...
---
Mage has plenty of counterplay with freezes, which Bomb Hunter can't handle. Rogue shits on Hunter because it can completely prevent the deck from establishing a board. You don't need Sap (and Walk the Plank is extremely rare outside of specialist lol). Warrior only really loses to Galvanizer BS. Other than that it's pretty fair.
---
I don't say Bomb Hunter is bad, but the top tier is as is for a reason. Bomb Hunter just doesn't do anything particularly powerful. It's just consistent and hard to misplay with.
---
Even just comparing it to the other Omega's shows how stupidly bad its balance is.
---
The others are all balanced around being amazing at 10 mana, but they pay for that power by being rather weak without it. Only Devastator doesn't, as even without its effect it's still a solid Yeti, with a beneficial mech tag on top of that. Especially ugly when you compare it to Omega Agent; also 4/5 with a \~10 point boardswing at full mana, but costs (1) more and has no side benefits.
---
Not always.

---
Well, counter cards make for an awkward "I must run this in my deck or I lose" scenario, where, depending on the hardcounter cards printed, more and more space of your deck will be occupied by specific counter cards, essentially wasting the flavor of the deck you run.
---
Furthermore, it emphasises the class differences in an unhealthy way ( if i meet x class with y i must resign because he just counters my tech) while also pushing down classes that either didnt get the counter cards, or they would rely on the countered mechanics. And if you make a lot of specific counter tech available for everyone, we're back to square one.
---
A healthier option would be to include soft counter cards, that are playable anyway, AND make the certain aspect that needs to be countered weaker.
---
Here is a HEAVILY overexaggerated scenario, just to show why I think it's a bad idea:
---
Back when weapon-tempo rougouge was the deal acidic swamp ooze and harrison took up 2-3 slots in your deck for just that 1 matchup. Then you had to have some mass removal against the mage giant spam (so as pala you needed 2 shrink ray e.g.) and at that point 5 of your card slots were gone just to survive 2 matchups. Now add the need for silence against mech hunters- 2 additional cards, and we already took 7 slots out of our deck. Zilli is autoinclude so 8 slot is taken.
---
It's just not fun
---
They're all valid, but Shark has the edge because it isn't dead in the water to Warrior.
---
&gt; And Jara as a hero is still considered a demon and can be killed by Sacrificial Pact.
---
Though that interaction is hard coded in and intended. Because normally, he is not considered a demon.
---
I did actually play the applebaum alongside as I knew there was so little chance of me losing From there I wanted the extra heal despite the body dying
---
This is speculation because I‚Äôve looked into it as well.
---
Fullas games used that as a platform to try to get hired on by Blizzard. When it was unsuccessful of getting Blizzard‚Äôs attention, he abandoned the project.
---
All the custom cards he created/showcased were way OP so that could be one of the reasons as to why Blizzard never hired him on.
---
Thanks
---
Dead on turn 5 by doing nothing.  If you dont have an early game you will die, if you only put in huge bombs you will likely die.  A lot of things have to come together and this quest will only be good if you fill your deck with large mana cost minions and you wont be staying alive if you do that.
---
Druid would do far, far more burst now if FoN still had charge.
---
Also, the only reason people bring up "From an empty board" when reffering to FoN+SR is because if it wasn't empty you were just kinda fucked if they had the combo turn 9.
---
I think Echo has the most interesting design space, tbh.
---
It‚Äôs simple, I see Old Guardian, I upvote.
---
I'll never get tired of trash players who think that Warrior is broken. Keep it comin. 
---
Also you're probably voting with your mommys wallet and not your own so...don't make too much of a fuzz about it. Ayyyyy lmao

Hes actually right next door to you, he just speaks Spanish
---
Posting here so I can copy and paste :)
---
Have you ever had to retroactively change a card before release? I.e. if you were working on Rise of Shadows, change a card in Rastakhan's Rumble after you "finished" RR due to a potential combo you found?
---
I think Noblord is reading 7.11, A, VIII wrongly.
---
&gt; Collusion, match fixing, or any other action to intentionally alter, or attempt to alter, the results of any game or match, including losing a game or match with another player in order to advance one or the other‚Äôs rank or standing. 
---
The *whole* sentence has to apply in order for it to be collusion. Nalguidan and Rase discussed strategy of deck choice to maximize results but did not alter the results of any game or match to assist one another. If they had played each other, then yes, this would be collusion. Or if after Nalguidan's game against Purple if Rase threw the game on purpose or something, that would be collusion and cheating.
---
The admin team's response seems to back up my interpretation of the rules.
---
I also think Noblord is taking "if you want me to play some deck, just tell me and I will play it." from Nalguidan too literally and ignoring further context. In the very next statement Nalguidan says "**so he was like** 'okay, you go rogue I go warrior so worst case, Purple doesn‚Äôt get two good matchups because we would face him'" The "so he was like" comment interprets to being a conversation happened rather than a directive.
---
how about...unnerf the BGH?
---
Isn't that straight up collusion?
---
There will always be some decks that make me want to quit. One day I actually might, but it is not this day.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

I took out some legendaries so people wouldn't be scared of wild.
---
I like how ppl don't see how Mage is a way bigger problem than Warrior. Guess most players here simply are dumb. Or ignorant. Or both.
---
But while Devestator is strong it is not as strong as freezing your opponent every turn. When Devestator comes down it might remove two things but you can still do something afterwards. When my entire board and my face is frozen for 7 turns in a row what exactly am I supposed to do?
---
Almost makes me wish that Diminishing Returns were a thing. You can only freeze a minion or player for maximum of 2 times. After that they become immune to freeze effects.

If you have to think/try that hard to enjoy the game, maybe it's just not for you, or you simply burned out (if you played a lot). Consider taking a break, try some TFT or Underlords, both are very popular right now, attracting many Hearthstone players.

No, even when the player has more than 15 Health. I've seen it multiple times on this sub.
---
I stopped playing any game mode other than Dalaran Heist for 3 weeks and had a blast. There is enough solo content now that you could play it for a year exclusively and still not have done/seen everything. When it comes to wild/standard I feel like it‚Äôs not a choice of what mode to play but rather what deck you want to play. I decided recently I wanted to play some hand warlock, but unfortunately it‚Äôs basically a meme deck in standard right now. So I hopped onto wild and played even warlock, went from rank 20 to 5 in a couple days and had a lot of fun.
---
Okay, this is probably the most well-edited HS video I've seen. Amazing.
---
So we should nerf Crier, Rover, (the two best one drops in the game) and Dr. Boom?
---
Thank you
---
It's a bit strange, but when you get a new hand it doesn't draw cards from the deck. Instead, it will give you random cards from a  "pool" of cards you've picked throughout the game, so while these cards are also in your deck to get buffed by lady and shuffled in they aren't the cards which make your hand.
---
100% agree
---
They should remove the Battlecry and the Mech tag. Also make it a neutral card.
---
"You ain't never had a friend like me" sung by Khadgar's head had me expecting this to be a video full of r/thankskhadgar type interactions. I am disappoint.
---
As a post-typical preteen I feel sorry for the kid

---
I'm a former muslim and a student of many religions, I can honestly say that, after reading the Quran twice and speaking with many people who are into learning about Islam, many things muslims find haram are halal, including video games.  
---
Hearthstone isn't gambling. The thing that makes something haram isn't the sentence of it being haram, its the reasoning behind it. The reason wine(mainly alcohol) was made haram in Islam is that it makes someone unreasonable when he drinks. The reason behind gambling is that gambling will make that person destroy his wealth and will make him poor/rich without effort, and wealth should be won by effort, by the sweat of the brow.  
---
Thus, if Hearthstone is making you waste your own children's milk money on card packs, its haram. Otherwise, its halal.
---
*cries in Hireek*
---
(fr tho if you have to jump thru this many hoops to get as much extra hp as warrior and druid can get off of 1-3 cards, i don't think this would be a problem.)
---
If they didn't hard code a stop, it would go forever and break the game.  They could have coded higher, personally I'm glad they didn't.
---
Give them hope... then immediately destroy every step of their plan
---
Jackbot
---
They are definitely better targets for nerfs than Omega Devestator. Especially Boom is the highest target since it basically always has the best mulligan winrate in any Warrior deck - as a 7 mana card that does nothing the turn it's played.
---
I agree with you.
---
I was playing happy lock, pretty easy to shove 15 damage after playing guldan.
---
It didn't. It was the Vicious syndicate freeze mage list with some tech modifications.
---
DC loses are definitely the worst feeling,  especially when you were in a winning or even situation.
---
Not sure what you want to hear, bud. They said in a Q&amp;A post last week that they're working on a mobile fix to deal with a couple of bugs that sprouted after last patch. I'd avoid paying for arena runs in the interim until a hotfix is rolled out.
---
You can submit a ticket but I honestly doubt they will (or can) do anything about it, since disconnects are so common and it might well have been on your end. If they refunded runs for DC's, it'd be pretty easy to abuse.
---
This is professional grade video quality
---
Thanks, for the feedback. I will definitely implement these :)  
---
and the result readouts are going to be changed in the next version to something similar to the one you have said.
---
Yeah Hero cards were a mistake. Unless there is a full on aggro meta they are too good. Funny thing is back when DK's were around Dr. Boom wasn't considered that powerful.
---
Did you pay real money for that run? I couldn't tell.
---
That's a lot harder to code.

Shoulda played around it.

Lmao, fyi, your downvotes are from his alt accounts, guys a major no lifer.

---
Funny thing is, it wouldn't see any play on ladder.
---
If side boards or side decks were a thing in Hearthstone, yeah sure it would see play, but they're not.
---
Ouch, that's why I dont play on mobile
---
One for your other mana cyclone, and two more for your mountain giants!
---
Universal language: memes. üòÜ
---
But it let's u have a counter in the event Bomb warrior becomes oppressive. It also allows further design space for perhaps more Bomb cards in the future.
---
When mech hunter gets into a position like this, they can still clear the board, and as a minimum, hit the 'go face' button every turn.  Paladin is too wrecked by poly and silence or freeze like this.
---
Too be fair for every game this works out flawlessly for the mage there's a game where they just don't have enough and get crushed.  You never remember the multiple games where you crush freeze mage because they can't do anything.  They are unremarkable and you forget about them.  The the one time freeze mage draws flawlessly and crushes you, it feels OP.  It's not.
---
The carousel is the absolute worst.
---
Yea.... Silence destroys mech paladin. That's why Shamans are the worst class to play against as Paladin.
---
That's how it really works, too. Upvoted posts are more likely to be upvoted, downvoted posts more likely to be downvoted.
---
As a fun exercise, I sometimes make the exact same comment in a mildly controversial discussion in two different places (when they're relevant to both comments I reply to, of course). Often enough, one comment gets downvoted, the other gets upvoted, pretty much purely based on whether it was up/downvoted first.
---
Omega mind isn‚Äôt usually a 2/3 if it‚Äôs giving you a big heal since it dies in the process. It would honestly be a fair card without the omega requirement.
---
It‚Äôs all about either the passives that work well together or a synergistic Treasure. The Candel is actually really good against the late game bosses because their hero powers loose all synergy with their deck. Just get one turn where they have less minions then you and once you play the caddie it just turn into a tempo game where you‚Äôre already ahead. 
---
Here‚Äôs some of the ways I‚Äôve won.
---
Hunter: Emerald goggles and flooding the board with 1 mana minions until I drew/played the candel.
---
Paladin: Give all minions +1/+1 and reduced minion cost by 1. Hero power added 3 recruits to had so every turn was for 2 mana summon 3 2/2s.
---
Paladin again: 0 mana sound the bells
---
Priest: Emerald goggles, questing adventures and a lot of draw/buffs.
---
Priest: Again with minion buffs but I got Elistra in the start of the game and made her a +300/+300
---
Fooled me for a second and then I was like nahh but yea at quick glance it‚Äôs good

Yeah I've been trying a midrange paladin focused on healing like Soup Vendor and I've been having a ton of trouble with mage as well. Conjurer's Calling is really crillling for paladin as it renders ineffective most of paladin's removal package. You need Wild Pyro into Equality or Equality into Consecration to swing the board back but the first combo costs 6 and the second costs 8 at which point a mage could have already gotten a lot of value off the calling. Shrink Ray and Aldor Peacekeeper are really laughably bad answers to mage as they'll just play Conjurer's Calling. Without the aggression of rogue to be faster than mage or without the board clears in warrior, I think that paladin is just too weak at the moment.

Khad reminds me of Five Guy's french fries. Where you order a size, and they put that cup in the bag and then dump a ton of fries in the bag.
---
the way it worked in the adventure is that it would do the chosen option first, and the the other second. so you could heal a full health minion, then it would do the 2 damage after to proc it, or you could kill a minion with the 2 damage and the heal wouldnt trigger on a dead minion. anything other than those situations results in a heal though.
---
hope that makes sense :p
---
It is not gambling
---
Fishing = Game of skill, pack opening = gambling
---
Why would you run mad scientist in a pogo deck
---
If it does not meme when you ask about 4 mana 7/7 then i'll be disappointed
---
Ah, then I'm a fool.
---
LOL ... ever face ICHORON? especially late run? THAT is annoying. And then there's the uitimate mill boss - Azari the Devourer.
---
because 15 is your HP at the beginning of the game, I bet.
---
Always the quest, or a small minion.
---
Fair? Hearthstone dungeon runs?! 
---
Excuse me while I laugh so hard I pass out.
---
Oops, tired mind at work. Lab Recruiter, not mad scientist. Both science related? My bad
---
Yeah hopefully we get some better priest cards this expansion ü§û
---
I was using them as an example, I know other streamers do it.
---
I also know it was against the Championship Tour rules and could result in a DQ.
---
Except there is no secondary market for dust. The same way you can buy non-randomised microtransactions, or full on games, or expansion packs/DLC, and still not associate them with a given value *even though you just paid money for them.*
---
Do you have a youtube channel? I'd totally subscribe for stuff like this
---
I like u
---
Was that draw still on your turn because you killed a deathrattle minion that draws and immediately ended your turn? Because he has a Thalnos in his deck and can easily generate minions with cost-based effects (effigy, conjurer's, mage random card generation)
---
And I legit disenchanted it after the update.
---
They can get DQ right now only for helping someone ladder to Top200 for the tour stop. And since all of them are GM They are auto qualified. 
---
I don't watch Zalae these days too much I guess they can get in Trouble for Galon (Although that would be questionable due to his LV finish) or that blond girl whose name I forgot
---
If boom had 7 HP he would be so unplayably bad it would be hilarious
---
NO
---
It wasn't just that.
---
&gt;and in the meantime, here's something we've had in the works to tide you over"...and boom Diablo Immortal.
---
_In the meantime_ means that you have two projects at one. It means a bigger project in the works and the side project on mobile. That's what _meantime_ means for these games.
---
They couldn't say that because they clearly stated that they only had projects with mobile games.
---
People were Obviously pissed at this. Costumers paid for la creme de la creme of PC gaming conventions only to be be fouled as a scrappy 6 year old on a phone.
---
Slyssa.
---
You've honestly just backed up my point. If Firebat is going to bitch about deck choice collusion then helping each other at legend ranks is something he should stop doing.
---
LOL, my thoughts exactly when I throw together an all basic card deck to satisfy a quest
---
Nope. It's from the Anomaly that draws to 5 at the end of your turn.
---
they have to spend time and money to do that so...no never, we will always stay with 9 bases classes /10 and never had dk and dh sadly. it like having an half baked game.
---
New hero powers and 7 armor are more than enough.  Because the hero powers are waayyyyyy better than gain 2 armor.
---
on heroic its placement is decent so you only ever get a 1/1 from turn 3 onward because he play alot of 1/1 that summon bigger minion and it place it correctly almost all the time,also the rotation happen at the end of its turn so he can trade favorably before the rotation
---
if you got a crap deck its pretty much a reset button
---
Hot take
---
50% - it either happens or it doesn't
---
*wall of text hit you for 21hp*
---
Im right there with you. I DEed all the censored cards.  And today, after having been mulling it over all week, I uninstalled hearthstone from my phone. If they want the game to be a children‚Äôs game for China, then I guess an American guy in his 20‚Äôs like me shouldn‚Äôt be playing it anyway.
---
Just checked at a local GameStop, MA, nothing.
---
Kalas#1414 trading 80g on NA. I'll show you go first.
---
Well... I should be spending more time on this thread then.
---
And that was a 22 lines script with advanced functions.
---
Because it's easy to use, powerful and caters to the casual audience.  
---
Of course Blizzard tend to forget about the people who get these "fun" cards used against them and don't seem to realize these "fun" cards can deter people from playing the game as much as they can encourage those who use them.
---
There is no wager
---
I‚Äôve invested a lot of time (and a reasonable amount of money) into the game. Giving up on it was a hard decision, and who knows if I‚Äôll change my mind later. I‚Äôve never stopped enjoying the game, and the next expansion looks cool. I definitely understand someone making a different decision than me on this.
---
The only thing that would make this sweeter is if he had 2 mountain giants in hand.
---
I like the rafaam idea, along with [[plot twist]] to accelerate the ‚Äúdraws‚Äù from the deck. 
---
A hand lock with plot twist could probably finish before turn 10
---

2/-/- | Shuffle your hand into your deck. Draw that many cards.

---
You haven‚Äôt seen the guy with the priest cosplay‚Äôs card reveals?
---
Quest ain't too bad to be honest.
---
I had a break for one expansion but then I realized I am not doing anything productive while on the shitter at my job anyway :D
---
I imagine a Subject 9 Nomi combo would be a thing. Thin the deck out with only secrets and card draw of sorts into Nomi.
---
Uhh... go face forehead
---
Why should you waste 45min just to maybe win if he doesn't discover this 7th omega devastator when you can just concede and win 3 other games during that time :p
---
At this point you may want to wait on crafting anything since there is a new expansion soon.
---
All you have to do is Play 20 Hunter 20 Minions Win 2 game 3 games 30 Shaman 30 Warrior class cards that cost 2 or less with Druid Druid or Hunter class cards class cards.
---
You uh... killed him fast?
---
Holomancer and Harbinger Celestia are counter cards. People just don't play them. We have silence cards too. There are lots of counter cards, but they're not fun to play with so people don't include them. Just go play wild with dirty rat, loatheb, more ways to mill your opponent.
---
I will be curious to know if they're concerned about "Reborn," as it's a deceptively complex mechanic from a rules standpoint, because it functions like deathrattle (but isn't?) and because the reborn minion carries the reborn keyword but can't be reborn.
---
Just because a good draw on a single game can sometimes make the deck feel oppressive (what you described was the perfect opening hand?) doesn‚Äôt make it broken. 
---
It has plenty of counters from a myriad of decks available in ladder. And it‚Äôs by no means dominating the meta (its indeed very popular in legend, but still maintains a healthy win % overall)
---
But I get you, turn 4 MG sucks for sure, specially followed by CC on 5. But it is what it is.
---
Control Warrior is literally play the most obvious card in your hand each turn.  
---
I'd say it's one of the least skilled based decks in the game right now.    
---
The "knowing what your opponent is going to do" doesn't change for any class, it's just far less important for Warrior because they just have far too many answers and throw infinite generator like boom into the mix and large hand renewal like omega assembly and you end up with a deck that completely forgives misplays.  
---
There is a reason it's got the highest win rate and being a hard to pilot or skill testing deck is the opposite reason of why this is.  It's because it's incredibly simple and forgives misplays that lifts it's winrate so high.
---
2 mana, discard 3 cards? Finally, the support quest warlock needed!
---
Ah, just before Amazon Prime Day (15th/16th)
---
It is if you concede every warrior match.  
---
I find my enjoyment has gone up immensely once I stopped caring about Warrior.  
---
nothing feels worse than Dr. Boom turn 7 drop ... /r/fuckwarrior
---
Thanks for the Deck! I‚Äôve been playing a modified Resurrection Priest deck from March but I really like yours. I‚Äôll give it a shot! Yeah, warrior is a real bitch right now.
---
&gt; You will earn one Rise of Shadows pack for watching 3 hours of the broadcast
---
So like, half of 1 match?
---
^(Sorry, I'll show myself out)
---
Fun and interactive
---
What's the matter buddy? Feeling a little triggered still are you?    
---
All that you have left is personal attacks that you aren't even mature enough to direct at me personally.  
---
You sir, are the definition of pathetic. ;)
---
Like Boom, Hagatha and Zuljin?  
---
Sure thing, that would improve the game quite a bit actually.
---
No he got haro'd because he didn't
---
Then I got no clue. Weird ass play
---
7 cards really - coin, book, AI then 4 conjurer's callings if you count twinspell.
---
Now I totally want to try this Violet Illusionist, Auchenai _whatever_, and every possible "add a random dragon/legendary to your hand" in the hopes of getting Nozari.
---
_Thanks for wasting my entire evening._
---
Wish I had posted this then

---
Just do what I do and support all of them
---
Totally disagree with the 1st, 2nd, and 4th thing. As for the 3rd.. it‚Äôs not the same for any deck. If your opponent is playing Murloc Shaman or Giant Mage for instance you can know what they‚Äôre gonna do but it doesn‚Äôt really matter. Those decks just kinda throw stuff at you and you either answer it or die, that‚Äôs it. At least for the control warrior, like I laid out, there are decisions to make. As a control warrior you do have have a lot of value, that‚Äôs one of the decks strengths right now, but in the mirror that‚Äôs not so relevant. Again the more relevant thing is figuring out your opponents deck type and playing accordingly.
