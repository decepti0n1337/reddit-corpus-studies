It really helps that the tone is slightly sarcastic.
---
---
---
Except that the better players don't need a t1 deck or countless hours.
---
Its a slog I admit.
---

---
But I suppose decks that play the long game have a place in HS too. At least it cant be "till turntime is over" long. 
---
Yea. Dr Boom Herocard is pretty crazy. The only way to nerf him is to change his battlecry. His 7 armor and 7 mana are untouchable. He is Dr. 7 after all.
---
I think at this stage people need to realize the game has devolved into more of a casual friendly, childrens game than any sort of strategy game.    
---
They need lots of these easy to piece together winning plays/combos to keep that sort of audience interested as that's the audience that will bring them the most revenue.  
---
Unpopular opinion of course because everyone wants to think they are some sort of super genius because they play Hearthstone and get a modicum of success within the game.  It can't possibly be dumb luck for the most part, it must be all skill. ;)
---
Even the one area of skill which was deck building has become cheapened as they start to release stronger recipes now that people just refine.  
---
There is of course always Arena but having that as a pay only mode (gold is currency) is pretty stupid really.   
---
It's such a great draw card to breakup the mundane ladder play that there really should be a free mode.
---
Too damn straight, too damn deep
---
Agreed. Consider that Hunting Mastiff is a 2/1 and only spawns 5 at 10 mana, this card is crazy.
---
**Discovering** 4 murlocs and dropping a 7/7 for 7 mana is too good, if you get underbelly angler and 3 1 mana murlocs, you can easily get a full board on the next turn, if you're on turn 10, if your opponent doesn't clear the board, you can win on the next turn using bloodlust.
---
Hsreplay.net and their Deck Tracker application will do this
---
Deporting for Booty.
---
8 hour work days brother!
---
I think they should follow the Zuljin concept for hero upgrades.  Massive play on the turn it's played but if you can weather that then the on going effect is minimal.  
---
Personally I'd prefer no hero cards at all, they are far too swingy.  
---
Remove rush would be nice from Boom
---
Security rover generating rush minions is crazy and then there is the discover a mech power that pushes that even further.  
---
All in all not a fun experience and fun should be key.
---
There's no magic trick. Just realise that, no, you aren't playing perfectly. This sub seems to have some trouble with that notion.
---
I've cleared the Dungeon with all classes, and I think I've seen it just once.
---
I love the theme but man the card stinks
---
at least you have a good minion on the board.
---
I think it’s more the fact that this was a turn 2 Letha but boss had pretty much the one counter
---
hey i took the time to name each hero power and deck so it looks more neat, here it is if you would like to use it to update the main one 
---

My bad. *The T-to-the-G-T.*
---
I've heard it's the 5th
---
??  lol  sure thing.  
---
The vast majority of people, including yourself, on reddit are rank 15 or higher. but tell me more. you fucking idiot.
---
oh cool. ty suprised the bot doesn't show the mana cost but that's a cool bot nonetheless
---
above*
---
Last time I super buffed one of these bad boys it got sapped... never again
---
hey now be nice lol
---
Now replace every minion in your deck with it.
---
well guess I gotta go try this now lol
---
Infinite sound the bells has been posted like 1000 times, how am I supposed to be nice
---
This is a shit explanation
---
it is super reliant on what deck you want to play. I would go look up the major decks currently being used in the type of game mode you prefer, pick one and go with it
---
It’s not 1337. Disappointed.
---
Now I'm on a mission with a boar...
---
Ding ding mother fucker
---
At least people in that game know to shoot the enemy
---
&gt;You're asking for more choice and consequence.  
---
I am? Where did I ask for this?   
---
&gt;Otherwise they're just board games for idiots.  
---
Huh? Your insinuation here is because HS has "random" to it that it makes it less for idiots?  So what, is it the ability to master this "random" that makes someone not an idiot?  Heh. 
---
 
---
&gt;And things like 'fast paced' is relational. Meaningless on it's own, it's only significant when compared to similar items. Like other CCGs.  
---
Or you know life in general.  15-30+ minutes per game is not fast paced. You can fool yourself into thinking it is, but it's not.  
---
&gt;It's like trying to argue with a 12 year old. One whose mother has convinced that the short bus is prestigious.  
---
You know you've lost when you have to start busting out the ad hominems eh? :)  
---
Go take a chill pill, play some fast paced Warrior and come back.  
---
No one needs angsty froznwind stomping about the place ok? :)
---
seeing how blizzard promotes streamers with trackers I'd find it funny .
---
I’ve hit legend repeatedly in wild and standard throughout the past year, hence the reason I offered advice at all, but please rage about a rogue deck and insult everyone here just trying to be helpful.
---
You now have a 0/1 frog!
---

I mean youre not wrong. I would say just ignore it and dont click in case there happen to be people who havent seen it
---
He should have gotten a promotion past recruit by now.
---
Just dont underestimate the power of the golden candle in Act 5. Literally counters all the end game bosses
---
Lmao. How long did it take?
---
Same, much better that way!
---
Around
---
Not really sure why you got downvoted lol, I agree with most of your points.
---
When I did it Khadgar cleared the board...
---
On the other hand, if they printed CC, Mage wouldn't have a deck. That card is single handedly keeping Mage in the meta. Priest is already a dead class and before the buffs, so was Pally. Without CC, Mage would vanish from ladder.
---
How do you deal with this? I'm not a fan of nerfing classic cards. It leaves classes unplayable when expansions come out and don't have good card for a certain class. Without a solid classic set, classes are too vulnerable. 
---
The nerf has to be to CC. I guess upping the cost by a mana? Would that be enough though? I'm not sure. 2 mana? That might effectively kill the card and toss Mage on the dumpster pile. It's a tough situation.
---
1337
---
I wish they would just remove overload in general.  Its usually worse than the card just being properly cost.
---
Thanks! My hands were shaking when I finally done it too :D
---
Play Overwatch.
---
"Gee... I wonder why so many of my partners keep conceding when we're only 6 turns in?"  
---
Because you did ***stupid*** stuff.
---
Like swatting insects!
---
That's why you super buff once it's been on the board for a turn lol
---
Newb here what is that
---
Alwxtrasa on turn 2.
---
Gambling 101 - the house always wins.
---
Still a 10/10 on turn one. Also seems like he has multiple Azaris in his deck.
---
&gt; You basically insinuate I call myself out
---
Because you do?
---
&gt; any further yet your original premise was you were here to call me out
---
Because you don't seem to realise that you call yourself out.
---
It's not a difficult premise, mate.
---
&gt; sort of doesn't make sense does it?
---
I'm sorry but it *really* does.
---
&gt; Calling someone out is me calling you out like this
---
I'm afraid it isn't.
---
Calling someone out tends to imply that there's a flaw.
---
Calling you out for being a whiny bitch isn't a flaw. It's more like a fact.
---
&gt; and proving you're full of shit
---
Except you are being a whiny bitch?
---
&gt; and really are just the creepy triggered stalker guy. :)
---
For... browsing /new and seeing that you've once again decided to whine?
---
Er, okay, lol.
---
LOL
---
I mean, there are Drowned Ones.  What I am saying is that we don't know enough about the architecture of a fictional world to make assumptions.  What a time to be alive, where people are privileged enough to get to discuss gender rations in games while ignoring plights of women throughout the real world.
---
OK.
---
If they haven't seen it yet, then they should learn to use the search feature on Reddit.
---
&gt;Calling someone out tends to imply that there's a flaw.  
---
There is a flaw, it's called your lack of logic and understanding as proven by your post above.  
---
It literally makes no sense to what I just posted to you and you now seem to have got your knickers in a twist (or triggered as the saying goes) that I've not only called you out on only being here to stalk me but proven it also by simply using your own statements against you.  
---
Check and mate sir.  :)
---
He says extra but it is written as “added”.
---
This game is just absurd now. Stupidly absurd value, stupidly absurd combos.
---
Play arena
---
Uninstall and reinstall
---
You got it fam.
---
Or.. 'reduce their cost to zero' wouldn't be too bad if the overload theme must be followed.
---
Someone wants attention.
---
One of the treasures (Duplatransmogifier) replaces every minion in your deck with copies of a target minion. It doesn't just replace them for the current game, but for the entire rest of the run. 
---
It's normally one of the worst treasures, because you generally don't want to have a deck that has so little flexibility, but it does open up ridiculous combos like the one OP used here, and can be quite powerful, or at least fun, if you can use it on one of the OP treasure minions like The Muscle.
---
Sure you are. Complaining about thief rogue lmao. 40-50 hours grind lol.
---
Didnt this card actually see some play before tho?
---
lmao really?
---
Few things are as satisfying as losing to him one run, then getting back to him but picking up Evil Propaganda from the boss right beforehand.
---
I always take the emerald goggles, insanely strong treasure
---
I literally disenchanted Luna's Pocket Galaxy the day before the buffs were announced. Talk about disappointing..
---
I was expecting 1 legendary...
---
Hold your wispering woods until you can follow it with soul of the forest. The usually have a tough time answering that and you often only need that one turn of pump damage.
---
From what I can tell, exactly like ladder players who forget that Death Coil heals friendlies and winds up wasting it instead of popping the egg like they wanted to.
---
Me form of, Pig!
---
Nozdormu normally has no effect in solo games, so I'm guessing in this case it overrode the hero power but didn't actually reduce the turn timer.
---
Thats funny because the winrate percentage of a pro is about 60%.  
---
Brian Kibler, who is about a million times better than you at, well everything in life actually,  spends 4 straight days at rank 2-3.   8+ hour  streams.  Guess he sucks too huh.  complete fucking waste of life.
---
So, what exactly is wrong with you? Mummy didn't love you?
---
none of the classes are "weak" per se,i thought warlock and warrior were very weak,but i was just having bad luck with buckets,i believe i beat the rogue one with "Orb of the untold" and togwaggle's dice to cheat out big mana cost minions,i shit my pants at wagtoggle last boss because she kept stealing my big cards like rag or nefarian,but i pulled through.
---
for warlock,i won by getting the "heal 2 at the end of your turn" treasure,and building a masochistic deck with demon synergies.
---
No. That's not the arguement. The point is that having a super rare occurrence makes for an interesting surprise for the people who do replay it a lot. It isn't supposed to be searched for, it's just a random event that rewards people who have played for a long time.
---
Satan
---
thats the 8ball version of khadgar though,from the quest in WoW it seems like he put a little bit of his consciousness in there,so it's not exactly the same khadgar
---

To complete the run and unlock more stuff for the villain you picked?
---
Omg you Got sound the bells that costs 0 mana. Congrats, you must be proud of yourself, but that Is something that we have seen on this subreddit like million Times, so stop it please
---
He did
---
I actually did this, but it was good for me because it meant I could get to my 0 mana Echo treasure for an easy win on the final boss since my deck had so few cards in it (my other treasure was Untold Splendour which is how I also had Loyal Henchman and Transm as well.
---
When you make people happy it makes them more likely to give you money, I think.

Maybe ooze (depends on the meta at your rank) and a sap. You have the best feeling about that specific deck. Just a card that you really think underperformed.
---
With 2 mechs in it I would also try to fit snip-snap. Recently on omnislash they said, snip snap should go into every deck with at least 2 mechs, because it's so good.
---
But I guess that will also change too much of your own list

 alamoanahi#1703 NA 80g quest. I show, then you go first.
---
You're right. The amount of epics in decks is insane and it's always the main roadblock for me. I wouldn't mind crafting zuljin.. but I'd also have to craft masters call x2 and rat trap x2 and so on just to make a secret hunter deck to work for example. Its not just that epics are much more numerous and expensive, but they also feel bad to craft. Zuljin is an amazingly fun legendary card with a super neat effect while masters call could've been a rare card and no one would blink twice.
---
[deleted]
---
Eh, once you realize that the runs are dictated by the first treasure awards it kind of trivializes the experience. Just concede until you get some form of card reduction and then go from there.
---
My last victory was a deck of all Ysaar that would be played on turn 4 or one of rag the lightlord. Mage doesn't really need any rerolling as the other classes do due to the broken hero power and conistent access to the quest that and hunter I would say are the easiest to win with.
---
110 thereabouts.
---
I don't understand why more people don't have 2 accounts.  You play yourself in the brawl and win easily first try.  Same thing with daily quests each day and occasionally you even get a play a friend daily for that sweet extra 80g.
---
best part is you don't get roped in bot games so you don't have to feel pressured into doing it enough times
---
You can use many websites online to find good deck lists. Try and find a budget deck list. Mid range hunter is very good right now. And I’m having tons of success right now with mech token Druid
---
I lost against that priest boss TO the infinite sound the bells combo. He stole it from my deck with Devour Mind. That boss is just BS sometimes.
---
i run two gargoyles in my wild buffpriest, along with the selectively spell immune unicorn. It works suprisingly well
---
Did you win?
---
Yeah taking golden candle and using it on the last three mage bosses works wonders, it completely wrecks their playstyle. Other than that just try to have the most op treasures and synergies you can find, good luck!
---
Probably the opposite of a card front but dont ask me because I'm not an expert

Stop I’m almost crying https://youtu.be/MGq2Yomk8u0
---
It's been a while since I beat the LK with all classes, but I think Jade Decks and murlocs were the easy way to do it with Shaman/Rogue/Druid.
---
Hunter should be mostly spells, which should be easy these days.
---
Since your collection is probably small and most of the cards I used are now wild (and not worth crafting!) it is hard to give Proper advice.
---
Definitely dont craft too much just to beat the Lich King. You will do it eventually and your Dust is really important.
---
You should see what warlock is doing with him now adays. Bloodbloom+Implosion into bloodbloom+darkest hour. Turn 4 deal 4, summon 2 voidlords, mal'ganis and an unraveler so you can't deal with their board with spells.
---
He can't even Prep + Coin coincede next turn.... He has to Coin out the Prep.
---
Thank you very much :) !
---
I dont
---
Its not the same :(
---
Don't forget u can go to battle net store to get 3 free singleplayers, frozen throne even gives u free legendary Hero card on first run, if u don't plan to play wild u can always dissenchant it
---
Yeah that’s all you have to do but it’s annoying as fuck
---
Pogo rogue is better, but thief is more fun in my opinion. Neither one is that good, probably around ~45% and ~40% winrates.

What can you do about it tho? You complain as if you have the power to prevent it or make more people realise the truth. In reality, nothing can stop China from owning big part of gaming. Stop your useless struggle and bow down to the chinese overlords.
---
I enjoyed this brawl, once I figured out how to do it.
---
I didn't even review anything on the brawl just went straight into it.  Failed miserably the first try (sorry partner), but killed it the second time.
---
I have to disagree, the classes do have a lot of different options but some strategies are just so much stronger than others that those are the ones you're going to run into the most on ladder.
---
Warrior will continue to be bombs and control because they dont have a good aggro deck atm. Mage has a few strategies but cyclone/calling is their strongest atm.
---
On the other side of the coin look at decks like paladin who have secrets, mech, and otk shirvalla. And shaman who can play murlocs, burn, midrange, or control. These classes have a lot of options available to you that you wont always know what their strategy is for a few turns in.
---
The only class I really feel bad for atm is Warlock as they only have Zoo. Warlock is in a very bad place right now. But the other classes all have variety in playstyle. The format is wide open and much less stale than it was pre-rotation.
---
If you're playing token and want the early board I would get rid of your 6 drops
---
He stole my Candlestick Minion, his name escapes me but the battle cry deal 4 damage death rattle shuffle into your deck. Then he made copies. I ended up having to concede because it was eventually the last cards either of us had so neither of us took fatigue.
---
Same here, playing on Mac/PC/iOS. I took the time to open the decks and close them again to make the "incomplete deck" visual go away, but the next day it happened again.
---
Lmaoooo facts
---
Made a post about it a couple of days ago, and reinstalling it seems to have helped on my end. Which device are you on?
---
At first I thought a friend was fkin with me but then I opened the deck and it was okay. Yeap.this is annoying
---
&gt; the issue of big early cards such as Giants and Edwin wouldn't be such a big problem if they hadn't previously nerfed all the answers like BGH, Hunter's Mark, Excecute and so on.
---
OTOH a 0 mana hunter's mark destroys a turn 4 giant with the same ease that it kills a, say, chillwind yeti. In both cases it represents a huge tempo swing, only in the giant case is either "have the answer or lose instantly".
---
I believe the removals are the right cost, cheating big minions early should be looked at however.
---
There's an unused line of dialog in the files from King Rastakhan that seems to be for completing Rumble Run with all 27 Shrines, but in game there's no recognition whatsoever for doing that. :(
---
I had my "coop partner" bring the boss below 60 hp while I had a 29 health hyperbuffed minion on the board. He spent his turn healing himself instead of saving the minion with like 34 attack and 60 hp.
---
I was wondering why suddenly my decks were incomplete, after I played a game because one was full, they fixed.
---
Lmao I know the feeling
---
I just realized the synergy between summoning portal and snip snap. I'm gonna try making an echo-mech warlock deck with Glinda and Sea  Giants. Thanks for the inspiration!
---
It’s fast *relative to some* other current standard decks (not even as fast as Murloc Shaman though. Why not mention that instead?). But it’s not at all fast relative to the entire range of what has been seen in Hearthstone.
---
I play CC mage and it’s so hard to compete against any form of Aggro. Mech hunter, token Druid, and Aggro Zoo all are favored if you ask me
---
Still not as good as zero cost alexstrasza that starts in your hand.
---
Again huh
---
Same here
---
That would be a more appropriate way to state it, i agree with you now. Look at us comming to a conclusion instead of bickering because we are advanced beings

We know.
---
Context: Best way I got in my mulligan to contest the board was a shielded minibot, which really didn't do a lot to stop his turn 1 flamewaker. And since I couldn't immediately kill his elemental from hand (well, to be fair, I could with the hyperblaster, but I mistakenly thought it would be much more valuable later), he followed it up by summoning another and using [[molten reflection]] on it.
---
Two turns later I got cinderstormed for 40.

4/-/- | Choose a friendly minion. Summon a copy of it.  
---
I got lucky and went up against him for the first time last night... as a Hunter, with the 1 mana hero power add a shifting 1/1 to your hand, and the Stargazing treasure (reduce hero power cost by 1 and use it twice a turn).
---
He prioritizes clearing minions extremely high, so he just dumped all his control cards really fast trying to remove all my 1-drops. By turn 6 or 7, he was in pure topdeck mode with 0 cards in hand.
---
I had a run where i had the passive where max minion is 5. I then got a lich king in the tavern, and duplatransmogrified it.  Other passive was minion cost -1, so i had a bunch of 4 cost lich kings. Destroyed all opponents easily. Also learned how amazingly strong echo cards with cost reduction.
---
You should look up token druid which is very cheap deck and pretty stable for a beginner. In my experience I don’t really like token druid but every one else apparently does :D murloc shaman imo is the best aggro deck when you take into consideration the strenght of the deck and having fun as it tends to be pretty fun when you get rolling with underbelly angler. As well look into some sites like tempostorm or something else as it shows meta decks, the ranking can be off, although you can simply check some archetypes and see which ones do you prefer. You can always look up some wild decks which is a combination of old cards and standart cards (latest expansions) where you can create pretty op decks and play them for infinity because the archetypes don’t change like in standart where after a year old expansions go to wild format. Your choices are limitless now is the time to youtube some decks and have some grinding. 
---
As well when you go to a blizzard pc client, you can go to shop and buy old solo adventures (singleplayer campaigns) and blizzard made “kobolds and catacombs” and “knights of the frozen throne” free, just pick em’ up, as they are free eventually you can go and try your luck with op dungeon run and super op lichking boss which can get some rewards. I personally play for about 6months and just started to play those adventures, they don’t really give a lot of value wise rewards but I learned a lot from those two adventures!
---
The most crucial advice is: have fun, this game is insanely fun, I find it relaxing and I learned a lot by just watching youtube and googling decks. 
---
P.S. What CCG were you playing before?
---
Definitely something to do with the offline deck management feature. And some spaghetti cause the game to think you are using offline deck and somehow there's mismatch with the server.
---
Also, you can get a free Death Knight Legendary card if you open up the single player mode for it. 
---
Currently, you have to do that through the Blizzard shop. Go to the HS section and scroll down until you see "Knights of the Frozen Throne Adventure". Claim it and then you do the prologue and they give you a free Legendary (which you can turn into 400 dust).

From what I’ve seen, it’s caused by golden basic set cards
---
Was going to say, my English friends call me "an historian" because of the h glottal stop
---
Can you read or just downvote?
---
I actually pulled a muscle cringing. But in the end, I'll remember this episode a lot more than many others.

That's good to know, but the article was about the card's impact on the Standard Metagame. Obviously as the game evolves and more archetypes are created, nearly all cards can find their niche in a big enough cardpool. The point was that, when released, these cards saw 0 play all the way until their rotation.
---
Not sure about collider, but double casting time warp has always given you two extra turns. I imagine collider is you both get two extra turns, but I’m not sure.
---
If you do want to play Arena, you should consider downloading Overwolf if you don't already have it, and get the HearthArena extension on it. It basically helps you draft your arena deck (it picks up on potential synergies, helps you smooth out your mana curve etc.). I've been using it ever since it came out, and I can't imagine going back to not using it.
---
You're right it's not as good, it's better.
---
I just cleared my temp files started right up
---
My little defensive felguard
---
Literally just check history by new. It takes 2 seconds.
---
Yeah i guess alexstrasza can get hard removed before turn 2, but unless the mage has chef nomi you are pretty much certain to win.
---
I thought this would be top comment
---
What I meant I read ratings of difficulty made by people personaly and when 7 people out of 10 said warrior I went straight to warrior, so as I did earlier by reading coments I want to see other people’s opinions on what was the hardest for them and try to make a list, I know opinions differ, but maybe it will help me to decide what to tackle next (not going to play solo adventures for several days, so I have time)
---
As of opinion about hunter, I found it quite easy as well, I did win by inch, because I got the boss that destroys 2 cards from your deck and almost missed lethal at the end, but apart from that the whole run was fairly decent not like warrior. With warrior I struggled with several bosses, had several runs where I got smacked at 6/8 or 7/8 bosses. 
---
It’s maybe dumb, but I want to stick with one hero until I defeat the boss and then go to another and I want to do it from hardest to easy ones.
---
That seems like a pretty expert answer
---
I really like zoolock, I’ve never seen it used at these ranks and it crushes all decks except warrior, in which case you just need rafaam to outvalue them. (I don’t even use the soularium, so just need like one lego)
---
I think the space that such a mechanic should explore is the dynamic of play order. The first two don't really have much to do with play order and the third one is only made dynamic by the addition of Combo. The vast majority of time, you should just play the cards as directed making the ability mostly irrelevant outside very niche situations.
---
Abilities like "Battlecry: Give a friendly minion Rush" on a well-statted minion for its cost would make for an interesting Swift card because you would have to create scenarios to take advantage of the ability rather than just play it first no matter what. Or something like "Battlecry: Deal 1 damage to a random enemy for each friendly minion;" things that would be better if you *could* play more cards first but can't if you want to trigger the ability. It creates an interesting dynamic where you can have more powerful effects at lower costs in exchange for altering the way you play.
---
What does Potion of Polymorph on 4 do for you? Seems like turning Barnes into a sheep is barely even a difference since he's played for the summoned token rather than the body.
---
Tempo mage probably wins before then but I used to save the Potion for turn 7 back when I played Secret Mage to catch hard played minions.
---
I run quite a different list than VS has as their.
---
Battlecry: Overload 2 of your opponents mana crystals.
---
He'd see play, and it fits his lore.
---
Perfect example on the Crystalizer
---
Dire Mole was so good because it had 3 health. Rogue, Mage, Paladin etc didn't care about the beast tag. Crystalizer may as well be a vanilla 1/3 anyway because the synergy or purpose is to subsequently restore back the 5 health but who ever uses that as a game plan? You can't play 2 crystallizer back to back either, the net effect is the same. I just dont think there is any formula to why some cards are epics other than they just need 2 per class and so many that are neutral. And it goes into a hopper and they draw them out and assign.
---
Or like in Blizzards other battlnet-game Starcraft 2. Its not as if the technology wasnt there.
---
Rogue: [cries in Hallucinate]
---
A big mech that’s not a snip-snap screenshot? My eyes must deceive me!
---
Can a brother get a decklist? I've been looking into something like this since Extra arms got buffed.
---
Nice
---
Bad advice for a rank 20 player. Immediate value will be worth more than potentially not having to open another Griftah in the long run.

Wow, could you be any more of a tryhard?
---
Keep him until new expansion drops if you’ve got all the good legendaries you want. 
---
He’s mediocre at best.
---
Here's some more feedback:
---
1) No one gives a fuck how you want to play.
---
2) Normal queue is where people try out fun decks, not ranked. Seems like a better place for you.
---
3) I could skip the next 2 seasons and be ranked higher than you, quit crying at such a low level.
---
4) You do not get to decide for everyone else what constitutes fun.
---
5) Your strategies clearly aren't working if you are hardstuck.
---
6) Shut up and let people enjoy things.
---
Secrets cant trigger on your turn thats simple. And minion can be killed with spell too
---
I had a priest use Convert on my Healing Totem whilst he had Northshire Cleric on board and a bunch of damaged minions with three cards left in deck. He dropped it, making his board full, ending up fatiguing himself heavily AND wiping his board because Nefarian.
---
Pure genius.
---
Not necessary at all, this is learned that secrets don’t trigger by the owner’s actions.
---
just don't use Northshire
---
Is there any benefit for doing so with literally every possible combination?
---
btw mobile hs app doesnt working on iphones anymore
---
XD
---
I am having the same issue. Worse, I accidentally clicked on a bugged deck and then had to go in and figure out which cards had been auto-replaced.
---
No way you'd reach turn limit on her. She has a lot of deck thinning + Aluneth
---
Maybe roping a few times it set off the AFK auto-lose effect...
---
you hear that, u/bmking69 ?
---
2 difficulties with 9 characters on 5 acts, 3 hero powers and 4 decks in each.
---
That's 1,080 different checkmarks.
---
You remember which ones you are missing?
---
Even remembering "I am completely finished with Mage, Warlock, and Warrior on Act 1 and 3" isn't really something I'd expect from anyone.
---
Tabbing out (or second monitor) and doing a one-time update to throw a checkmark on a spreadsheet that you can keep open is infinitely less time than Click Click, Back Back, Click Click, Back Back through 100s of screens.
---
Yeah honestly, it's shitty that this has to be the case, but this isn't really on blizzard. China has to be like half of their clientele.
---
What do you expect them to do in this case? Honest question.
---
good to know I'm not the only one with this problem.
---
Gotta keep them Pogo hoppin!
---
That's probably the last change they'd make, considering twinspell is the mechanic of the expansion. Much more likely to make it cost 4.
---
you think that is bad? i always hit that and in single mode, when i receive the bob special to make 1 random card 0 mana cost it is always the random 1 mana minion.
---
Thanks, man.
---
What does that mean, if you don't mind me asking?
---
Do the death knight version too, that would be awesome!
---

Price of (say) Dalaran Heist: EUR19.99
---
Less minimum of 15% VAT*: EUR17.38
---
Revenue to Blizzard based on .88 exchange rate: $19.67
---
Price in USD: $19.99
---
Discount given to EU customers*: $0.32
---
*Assuming 15% VAT, which is the EU minimum. In many EU countries, it's actually higher. 
---
So no, you're not paying a premium, you're getting a discount. Are you really ignorant of the fact that VAT exists in EU?
---
I didn't say last, I said at the bottom, and Shaman has definitely had multiple high tier decks throughout HS' history, and Priest has been trash / bad tier for long periods of time.
---
It's definitely not a clear cut whether one has been worse than the other though.
---
Sorry I don’t fully understand. Can someone explain what happened in the video?

How in God's name is whipping out your phone and taking a picture with it easier than pressing PrintScreen?
---
Thats why you need two galvanizers. Each one discounts the next.
---
Stargaze allows you to use hero power twice, and it costs one less. 
---
Burning wilt is a mage hero power in Heist that allows you to reduce the cost of a card by 2. 
---
So you get to reduce the cost of a random card in your hand by 2, twice. For 0 gems.

I was playing armor warrior to get my quest completion and after a Psychic Scream from my opponent, I was glitched and wasn't seeing any cards drawn/couldn't play them. 
---
I kept drawing cards (as evidenced in the 2nd and 3rd pics), but there was nothing I could do.
---
Uses spell vanish and plays pogos again

I got instantly permabanned for typing Tiananmen in the English twitch stream of PlayHearthstone. No warning, no rules that say it is bad, no message from moderators, nothing.
---
I don't know why, but this looks so cute and derpy , color it :)
---
True, I was just saying that calling Mecha’thun “vulnerable to silence” isn’t really a fair assessment of its value as a win condition
---
Valeerens and Phileera

Cool your jets. Everyone enjoys the game in different ways.

They're just trying to ensure that the Chinese market is open to them, i guess
