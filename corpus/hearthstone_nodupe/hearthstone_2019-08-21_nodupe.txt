It would be nice if the class had strengths, too, instead of a new board wipe every 6 months.
---
I intend to!
---
I got the treasure that gives your minions rush and went greedy with demons. I knew if I survived the early game I would win.
---
Explain Equality then, big guy.
---
Right, high mana cost minions that are played either have immediate impact on the board or provide some value.
---
If they refund all of the dusted Millhouse I have openned since launch, I could make that deck though. PepeHands I also opened 3 Natpale and 2 Cho...
---
Well yes i tought you were playing standard. 
---
You should probably try renolock or any other highlander control decks.
---
Man i got wrecked by *Soggoth* in Big Priest two days ago. This would see some experimentation for sure. It would probably end up a lot better than our dear Blackrock Emperor that some Big Priests seem hellbent on running...
---
I’m not sure this really fixes the problem tho and it goes against his flavor
---
I mean, true, but Rogue has combo cards to take advantage of the card advantage normally lost by running low impact cards, increasing the impact of backstab, sometimes significantly.
---
That shit looks blizz-like! Amazing job!

Nice Kubrick reference.

In general I went on hsreplay to look at highlander hunter lists, there was a new best performing list every day, but in general, the cards that I’ve seen taken out that I would leave in: sandbinder, hunters pack, lifedrinker, siamat. There are of course the essentials, like the secret package, unleash the beast and zuljin, kill command and animal companion. Some interesting choices that I’ve seen work have been houndmaster Shaw and surprisingly long krush (you can get some good lethals) and one of the cards that I’ve always been on the fence about is unleash the hounds, it’s a pretty good card but most of the time it’s very mediocre, I ran it when I hit legend but it’s something to think about
---
I love your point 7, I fall into this trap myself all the time.

watt?

That's why I usually play every game till the end but when I have an unfavourable matchup with a deck against control warrior I concede if I don't have good early and mid-game.Playing afterwards is just a waste of time because the OP omega cards (which are mostly just good,except for warrior's) and Dr.Boom aka the only hero card on par with DK power level in standard just give them an absurd advantage.
---
Mage has absurd mana cheating tools,that's why they can withstand and beat warriors.
---
I think mages and warriors have just warped the meta so much that any deck needs to either have a ridiculously strong mana cheating gimmick(like the best paladin decks),incredible amount of value,an oppressing amount of counterplay and pressure or "just" an 40+ otk deck with plenty of healing.
---
Scammer MegaMilk#11244 on US shows first, no trade
---
You're a moron.
---
It’s very fun yes
---
Bro I thought it was an actual card u copied and just finished the background
---
The card is limited to basic and classic cards only, so you start with a hard limit. Given that, many choices will be discarded from the jump. It's much more feasible to do when you look at just the classic set.
---
I doubt he has either, and if you don't want to play expensive decks, there are ether budget versions (I'd only call three of the six or seven legendary cards that deck plays vital) or other, cheaper decks to play with.
---
It's never easy or even a good idea to dive head first into building the most expensive deck you can in a card game when you're just starting out.
---
So it’s like worse Forbidden Ancient?
---
&gt;it’s a feature offered for free!
---
Hol up a moment. It's a feature the game requires if they expect the f2p business model to work. Imagine if you're at that same bar, all the f2ps were hot ladies and the whales were rich blokes. It's a similar situation- by having a large playing population, the people who drop exorbitant amounts of money frequently have someone that can face off againt.
---
Great job!
---
Really, really minor nitpick: that exact shade of pink is more Mage-y looking. I think Blizzard's style guide specifies some other colors for Shadow Priests. But, again, this is a really small nitpick. It's a great piece that matches Hearthstone's general look.
---
The best mage quest decks are the ones where you replace quest with a good card
---
yes, trust shitty hsreplay stats instead of the developer in the video with all of the stats directly from the client saying that combo priest is #1, super duper smart btw
---
He's got A LOT of tcg experience under his belt. He's played in some big money MTG stuff where I'm sure he got beat by insane plays with the player sitting right across from him. You learn to take it better when it's not a video game. Actually I remember when I first started MTG some people got really mad if I didn't notice when I had lethal damage on the board and they would think I was mocking them.
---
If only your deck was tailor made to exploit it like Mage does...
---
You are wrong I would guess and you just didn't track the secrets played correctly. I doubt that by the time Zul'jin dropped those were the only 2 secrets played.

Quest + coin on turn 1 is definitely the most optimal play. The quicker you get the quest online the quicker u can maximize value and steal tempo. From what I seen completed quest on 4 makes so much more of a difference than turn 5
---
.... Because that's a spell that does a thing... Bestial Wrath also gives them increased stats... Do you think this is inconsistent..?
---
So Acornbearer, even though it says it gives you two 1/1 squirrels actually gives you two 4/4 squirrels, because they're minions, and your minions are 4/4 this game.
---
But now Sonya, a card that creates 1/1 minions, interacts differently FOR SOME REASON.
---
Lellll
---
Except it is a valid comparison because arms on 2 is 65% wr and conj on 4/5 is ~65% wr. And no, not the same amount of cards needed. For mountain giant + conj on 4 you need to be on coin, and have AI on 3, going into turn 4 with mountain giant, conj, elemental invocation, and coin in hand.
---
Very well done.  Despite the fact that the character looks awesome, I think the fact that you captured the essence of the Exodar in the background is the best part!
---
Yeah, for sure they will limit player's ability to spend dust. Them running out and buying more packs to get more dust would be tragic for Activision Blizzard :)
---
Oh yeah, it’s a lot of luck, Highlander hunter is good against all the popular decks right now and it’s a lot of fun, I recommend
---
Fun fact : For the title I initially went with "*French virgin complaining that Blizzard = Bad"* but then I figured that no I wasn't going to use that title.  
---
Thanks for sharing my work btw, I don't deserve this community !
---
“Just blacks” you’re disgusting
---
&gt;yes, trust shitty hsreplay stats  
---
Yeah, I'm sure they just make things up.  Where is the context of your comment btw?
---
Mage doesn't really have a tempo style at the moment so wouldnt be so good
---
No it isn't you're thinking of control warrior with 60.8% winrate (75k games), then mech hunter with 59.9% (14k games), then highlander mage with 59.8% (16k games), then highlander hunter with 59.5% (6.5k games), then you'll see with a measly 410 games is combo priest with 59.3%. That's the highest it goes. If ANYTHING should be nerfed, it should be control warrior and mage, MAYBE something from hunter class. To say that this priest deck should be nerfed because of "muh otk combo" is asinine, priest players don't even want to play that shit. They wanted to play a control style deck but got yet another unviable quest this expac. If they nerf extra arms after buffing it DESPITE the fact it's going out of standard at the end of the year, then I will be pissed. I am a ftp player and this is the only deck I could get for this season and I'll be fucking damned by blizz yet again if they go out of their fucking way to nerf even a SINGLE fucking card from combo priest because high ranked players are shitting their diapers over it.
---
source for "wheres muh evidence?":  [https://hsreplay.net/decks/#sortBy=winrate](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#sortBy=winrate)
---
The game makes no distinction between spells that do things and minions that do things. You're fucking brainless. 
---
The reason Acornbearer and Poly work the way they do is because they're turning into new minions and then those new minions have 4/4 base stats. They're not 1/1 copies of your minions. And I actually think that's a stretch. Either everything should affect your minions the way they say they will (equality, Sonya, Barnes, cold blood) or nothing should (and they're 4/4 period always), but it was just blatantly inconsistent before. Sonya and Equality treating your minions differently was objectively flawed based on what the cards say and do.
---
😯😯. He is very animated. That looks so unnatural
---
All 9 are golden. 
---
I've been playing since beta. Got a few past 1000 wins. I'm glad pirate warrior existed for a while, otherwise I don't think I would have ever got it to 500.
---
Hunter is my highest at just shy of 1,500. Priest and druid are next around 1,200. Mage at around 900.

And yes, hsreplay has tons of problems with the algorithm they use to make their tier lists/meta reports.
---
I've wanted a nerf to Northshire since the last great evergreen one drop in Mana Wyrm got sacked.
---
Extra Arms was a soon to rotate crutch that could make any form of aggressive priest possible for the rest of the year that will die for its sins.
---
Looks great
---
Freeze has been historically pretty limited fortunately. Twin spell freeze is probably the biggest addition since nova.
---
Priest has broken the wild meta for two years now and they haven't done anything to address it.
---
I totally forgot that mage wasn't a control class with no control tools like freezing cards to stall the game and no card draw like book of specters.
---
Mind sharing your list? Seems hilariously amusing.
---
Which is why the other 3 are imprisoned instead of joining Y'shaarj in the Yankening.
---
Rapid Fire, Desperate Measures, Unleash the beast, Conjurer's calling, The forest's aid, Noone of these seems overpriced to me despite having twinspell. Blessing of the ancient might be overpriced looking at Mark of the lotus but that card was insane for 1 mana, even in that way, mostly of times in a single cast it gives you way more stats than a the +2/+2 given by mana extra arms.
---
I feel like it's just improper wording. That or it should have killed it at the end of your turn. It could be oversight, but I feel like it would have been tested with drawing cards on opponents turn like acolyte. So in my opinion it's working as intended. It's not common for that effect to happen this way anyway, nor is it particularly game breaking.
---
Yeah.. finally they have a tier 1 deck! Res priest was sooooo bad, boohoo. Some decks you mention aren't even T1 themselfs.
---
Just.. are you hearing yourself? It IS the best deck, people have given you stats to back that up and still you're denying it. Maybe you're just not that good at it.
---
There is a very big difference between saying yes to everything and not saying no. CS is supposed to understand how to divert to topics that are within the protocol. Going directly to the point works if the customer insists or becomes agitated. Your initial response should always be non-negative, not necessarily positive or saying yes. 
---
Even if they choose not to compensate, the script shouldn't be as stated by the agent. Having bullshit sounding template responses such as "Your feedback is taken into consideration" would sound better here. 
---
At the end of the day, as you said, CS is actually there to make the customer come back - by means of making them happy. I think CS should be treated as a semi-sales in that aspect. Screen caps and incidents like these should be prevented unless the company is willing to accept the negative PR.
---
Bad players who couldn't be bothered to learn the counterplay to a weeks-old deck have instead been crying about how broken divine spirit is. Because that's what kills them, even though PW:S, Cleric and Circle are much more to blame for the deck existing (Arms are busted too tbh but those are classic).
---
It's one of the only decks in the meta that barring specific tech choices had a fighting chance against Mage, Warrior and Hunter at the same time. It'll be sad to see it go
---
When Blizzard HoF'd Vanish they *explicitly* stated it's because one of Rogue's weaknesses should be board clear.

Actually this never happens to me. Is one of the reason that I don't play that deck very much. This kind of thing always happens to me when a tried it. I thought would be funny to share his, but seems like most of the peaple hate that deck so much that they hate me for tried it.
---
Is it made with plums?

Same...
---
So for 50$ you aren’t able to play a single meta deck lol.
---
Dunno if argent squire deserves to be on the same list as Flame Imp, I feel it's often the "good enough" one drop when nothing has been printed worth putting in a deck instead
---
That's why I love it, you can do anything with it. Armor up, Sabotage, Mill, Mad Bomber, Charge... You just play according to your mood.
---
Jepetto? You mean worse Pocket Galaxy?
---
Just hit any part of the Combo deck other than Cleric. Cleric is used in so many other decks. Arms, the actual combo pieces and all the SoU support can be just as crippling to nerf. I’m actually so nervous the wrong card gets the axe.
---
In 2015, [[Bane of Doom]] was changed from choosing from a preset list of 7 demons to generating any collectible demon.

It's a perfectly fine change, but I found it insulting that Blizzard called this a "bug fix" to get around the refund policy.

Id rather just nerfing him in a way wheres he's still playable in control decks in standard.

Like the next year would Be Starcraft, Diablo and Overwatch?
---
It is definitely not the best deck. I've been looking at statistics from several sites ranks 5 - legend, control warrior, mage decks, and some hunter/paladin decks dominate the meta. Think about what you're saying here. You're calling a 4k dust deck that focuses on a board-centric gameplay (which can be countered by removal and doesn't do well below rank 5) is the best deck in the game simply because it has a good winrate in legend tier games. Also, less than 5% of the population plays wild that's why blizz never touches wild cards because it's not where the money is at.
---
Under that assumption it's working as intended
---
What weapon will kill a 1/3 on turn 1?
---
What secret will kill a 1/3 on turn 1?
---
What 3/2 will kill a 1/3 on turn 1?
---
Using Priest's healing on minions is a lot of fun, but boy does priest with buffs suck. It can be the most snowbally class out there.
---
"dealing damage and drawing cards are part of the game". They are, although I wouldn't want to see just a fireball or arcane intellect in priest
---
Nice job Jared
---
That's a weird conclusion
---
What the heck is a pity timer?
---
Additionally, sea giant is a much more fair card to play around, you can have some control over how many minions are on the board. You have zero control over your opponent’s hand size.
---
Damn gurl you're crazy good. Have you tried to sent some to blizzard? They might hire you for these.
---
I wonder if Zephrys isn't so good that he becomes a sort of Elysiana for some decks, where it doesn't matter that you can't play him until you're down to the last few cards in your deck if he's giving you certain things that could be crucial for an archetype. Like having a copy of Nether or Tirion Fordring in the lategame, or something as simple as Pyroblast/Fireball for classes that lack finishing power.
---
I like the voice acting of Malorne, the OG anti-fatigue card.
---
"I have returned"
---
Gives me the chilly nillies, even if it's just a 9/7
---
Okay, but with the removal of mountain giant hopefully they can open up some space for some Warlock specific tools in future expansions that are not mountain giant.
---
Is he gay?
---
&gt;He's got A LOT of tcg experience under his belt. He's played in some big money MTG stuff where I'm sure he got beat by insane plays with the player sitting right across from him. 
---
yup: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDJTCYEg3Tc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDJTCYEg3Tc)
---
&gt; There will be so much aggro deck to eat combo priest. It won't even be a thing.
---
But combo priest does fine against aggro?
---
68% winrate against Token Druid.
---
52% winrate against zoo.
---
46% winrate against murloc shaman.
---
50% winrate against Tip the Scales paladin.
---
48% winrate against aggro warrior
---
51% winrate against mech bomb hunter
---
57% winrate against Quest Rogue
---
Like...it's a strong aggro deck that runs wild pyro board clears.  It can contest boards, and if it loses the board it can board clear.  It's not weak to aggro.
---
Flame imp
---
I'm 89% sure that you can't unless you already have all the leggos
---
You never miss the easy and free karma, do you.
---
But yeah, go hire her.
---
Theoretically , if you're lucky enough, it could happen that every time you play Box it just pyroblasts the enemy in the face 3 times until they're dead.
---
Probabily is small, but it exists.
---
Three fiddy.
---
Call me a hopeless optimist, I guess.
---
Except you could totally remove Conjurer’s Calling from the game and Mage would still be doing some stupid things with Luna’s Pocket Galaxy. CC is a powerful card that is broken by its synergy with other powerful cards.
---
How much money does it take to build a competitive deck as a new player?
---
I'm not speaking about how people react. I'm speaking to how they SHOULD react which was my entire point. People LOVE to complain so of course they are  going to be upset.  I also agree that Blizzard isn't handling it well. My main point is that these people are choosy beggars, that's it. I don't work for Blizzard, I wouldn't notice if a quest wasn't issued  one day or the next (most days at least), and it wouldn't bother me if it did. Especially not enough to go make posts on Reddit about it.
---
I responded to this initially while on break at work trying to kill time which is the only reason I weighed in to begin with seeing as I was, to my knowledge, not impacted by this bug.
---
&gt;	Q: most powerful card that almost saw print?
---
A: 5 mana luna’s pocket galaxy kappa.
---
Okay, I laughed.
---
That my friend is only partly true, because of zephrys every class has access to a Mass dispel of they decide to(and run highlander).
---
You can still hold back one or 2 threats like you would anyways if you are winning, but you can’t rly play around a mass dispel from a hunter. And against hunter going wide is stronger then high bcs of Deadly shot and stuff like hunters mark or freezing trap.
---
It really just depends if you can afford it. Against priest you can play around it if your board state is good enough as is and don’t play anything more. Against other classes that normally can’t punish you you for sure can play around it, but I wouldn’t. Unless I’m winning by a lot
---
Combo Priest is strong because of it's strong matchup spread against the other two top classes, Warrior and Mage. Less Warrior/Mage means more aggro decks which in turn leads to less Priests (because in my experience at least, Priests still die easily to aggro). Nerfing Priest at this point in time when they've had a tier 1 deck for all of 2 weeks isn't even kicking them while they're down; it's like shooting them in the head after a big promotion. And of all the problematic cards they could've chosen from Priest to nerf, Cleric and Arms are closer to the bottom of that list.
---
Daily quests aren't like developing a new feature though, so it's not equivalent to what you're talking about.
---
I think players should feel entitled to daily quests every day.
---
Part of making a f2p game is making new features that don't cost money, so I don't think there's a high risk of HS not getting new features (certainly not fewer features than we've already gotten!).
---
CC to 4 isn't enough. It should cost 6.
---
That is due to Secret Mage. About as unfavored for big priest as the old Kingsbane matchup.
---
And sir finley mrrglton is one drop
---
Dr. Boom is actually a very well balanced card. The only small issue is that half of his hero powers are ridiculously strong and the passive is nuts.
---
It does have access to Mountain and Frost Giant though.
---
Eydis Darkbane and Hands down the best: Tirion Fordring
---
Divine Spirit is the problem, not extra arm. If it's true, the devs don't know shit about balancing their game.
---
You mean the 4th ragnaros
---
Asmodai
---
A valid point.  And I agree Warrior and Mage are the major fundamental issues currently.  Im not saying Priest is absolute top priority, far from it.  But its important to also anticipate future issues after balance updates, since Blizzard has a habit of doing patches/nerfs very slowly.  If it turns out Mage and Warrior gets hit, and aggro priest continues to be very dominant and instant winning so many games, well thats an issue that could've been prevented.      And hey, I really like the deck. I dont want priest to get nerfed to the point of unplayability again. Just saying a small adjustment would be safer as opposed to potentially leaving it unchecked for as long as they did with warrior and mage.  This is a mentality I hope Blizzard stops personally for the health of the game, but thats just my own subjective opinion. Cant say thats the best objectively

---
Cardartis nice, probably too strong and rez gimmicks are kinda boring imo.
---
The reality is Priest's hero power is so good that they can never print a halfway decent set for them. That statement about their hero power may seem laughable now, but just imagine if you put another class's decent cards combined with Priest's hero power, aside from missing synergies (e.g. shield slam), it would be absolutely busted. A targetable heal 2 health on self or any minion means that you'd have to kill **every single minion** or else you will lose the game. But it's too late to change that now, the concept of hero powers are too ingrained in the fabric of Hearthstone, so instead Blizzard's "fix" to the problem is to simply never print good Priest cards.
---
Everyone who had 2 quests up during release was affected, that's a significant part of the playerbase, if not majority. The problem actually effects casuals more than those who play more and complete their quests.
---
It's not the 1-2 pack compensation that matters, I could not seriously care less. It's the anti customer attitude. Imagine you just spent 130$ on the preorders, and then missing dailies due to Blizzards mistakes, and then Blizzard violates the implicit contract between customer and company and refuses to compensate you for **their mistake**.
---
I wouldn't spend money on a company that shits on me like that willfully.
---
Meanwhile giving 1-2 pack compensation would literally cost them next to nothing and probably cost them no money, which makes the no compensation decision even worse. Looks like they are trying to squeeze every penny from the renaming paying customers by any means, which again is not the kind of company I'd like to support.
---
In my opinion, not a great idea. Every other day on /r/wildhearthstone someone suggests that the top decks should be nerfed because they are pure evil.
---
The reality is in Wild there will always be strong decks which will garner that level of hate. Unless something is a totally broken aberration across multiple classes (Naga Sea Witch, I’m looking at you) then nerfing stuff in Wild needs a much more measured approach.
---
Thanks appreciate it.

Coin Lens turn 3, turn 4 play 1 mana tip the scales with angler to boost health
---
The thought process here is, they don’t like snowballs earlygame cards. Like Manawyrm or Tunnel Trog.. maybe NSC doesn’t run with the game by herself, but the sheer amount of carddraw combined with a decent body makes her really unfun to play against. 
---
When NSC goes of I’m like, ok you drawn 10 cards it’s gg I’m outa here. Not a pleasant game experience, and i guess Blizzard sees that the same way.
---
Woooooooosh
---
Quest Druid isn't cheap, either. You generally need Loti and Floop, and you often see people run with Cenarius, Stalladris, and Nomi.
---
Cries in druid
---
With all due respect dude, you don't know what you are talking about. 
---
Combo priest have no strong ways to recover the board, as mostly aggro decks, if it falls behind it's doomed. Highlander Mage as Control warrior have several ways to clear the board and stall the game, Highlander Hunter have several secrets and burst damage to clear minions, murloc paladin can flood the board stronger and faster than Priest after using tip the scales, the only favoured games combo priest have are against Quest Paladin, Quest Shaman and Maybe Quest Druid, but guess what, mostly aggro decks are good against Quest decks because the simple fact they are playing quests, they start the game 1 turn after.
---
hm why not play safe and open a legendary before buying the bundle?
---
Looks like coin prismatic lens on turn 3. Turn 4 is 1 mana tip the scales trade the charge murloc. Then play that murloc that gives other murlocs +3 health
---
b-b-b-but I can't afford to play the fun decks you play
---
Prismatic lens became drew tip the scales and the 1 cost Toxfin that you can see is now 8 thus tip the scales is now 1 mana.   
---
They play tip the scales for 1 mana, draw the charge bluegill so they can make space for the coldlight seer that was in hand to boost the health.  
---
It's more or less the best play you get off the murloc paladin, not really that rare either.
---
Luckily I own Loti and Stalladris but would you say I still avoid it?
---
NSC would still be good at 2 Mana, or one hp less,but obviously you can fish for something else.
---
The pity timer works on opening packs as I see it so if you didn't open the pack to get the legendary the timer doesn't reset.

Getting Cruel Dinomancer to go infinite was always a bit of crap shoot and we explored the idea in the past with the decks Dino Demons &amp; Dino Dreams. With Saviors of Uldum and the new 2-drop Expired Merchant discarding Dinomancer and only Dinomancer has never been easier. This deck revolves around assembling the three minions, Expired Merchant, Cruel Dinomancer and Spiritsinger Umbra as fast as possible to create a full board of 5/5s that always turn into more 5/5s. Two cards really speed this process up, Witchwood Piper &amp; Sense Demons. The first Piper grabs only the Merchant while the second grabs only Umbra. Sense Demons grabs the Pipers as they happen to be neutral demons.  All that's left to do is draw one copy of Cruel Dinomancer naturally... and well surviving of course.  The restrictions on minions in heavy, we can't have anything 4-mana or less, we can't have anything 6-mana or more, leaving just defensive 5-drops to choose from. Rotten Applebaum &amp; Zilliax are fine choices but I landed on two copies of Chief Inspector to help gives us a chance in hell against aggro secret Mage. With so many minion restrictions we focus on spells for survival. Early point removals, Darkbomb &amp; Shadow Bolt trade card for card while Defile, Curse of Weakness and the new Plague of Flames can clear our opponent's board with the help of an enabler like Rafaam's Scheme or Fiendish Circle. There's only one copy of Expired Merchant in the deck so it's generally best used in combination with Dark Pact against classes capable of silence or transforming it.

Thjis can be helpful if he's not memeing

I havent played hearthstone in quite a while and just saw this on my reddit home page. I was really confused because I didnt realize this wasn't an actual card. I just thought you painted the rest of the card picture really well. Amazing work!

DEPLOYING COUNTERMEASURES
---
Well you’ve won the lottery and might get an easy 12 wins. But what consistent combos are you gonna get from that few packs. Only thing that comes to mind is unstable evo and radiant elemental.
---
I think it's well established that these brawls are horrendous. Cool for newer players who have no cards but most people just get in for the pack and get out because the RNG is so frustrating to play with. Considering how inventive brawls can get it's a bit of a let down when the recycle one of these styles of brawl, particularly as the last few weeks have been pretty flavorful and a good laugh.
---
That's my opinion anyway, a one and done for me.
---
Hey now... if anyone's looking for a real use for Millhouse you can try it in Wild with Call to Arms &amp; Piloted Reaper. They recently gave us a new 2/6 taunt for 2-mana to go along with Dirty Rat.

&gt; Q: buffs every expansion?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; A: nope. we mix it up. did buffs last time, will do something different next time.
---
This is telling.. From their perspective the buffs were a "cool thing to do" rather than an attempt to actually improve the balance of the game. This makes me sad.
---
Warlock isn't supposed to have great cards regardless of Mana cost. They have the best hero power by far. It's up to you to use the consistency the hero power gives to do something unfair on turn 5.
---
Enjoyed the laugh. :-) Thanks!

---
I already had Genn and Baku in my collection and spent about 2k dust on top to make a cheapo Odd Paladin deck, which worked wonders. You usually don't need every card from these but can replace some of them with cheaper alternatives. Figure out which of these cards are essential for these decks (like Genn and Baku) and which of the legendaries are just "gain more" choices that can be replaced with Common or Basic cards or specific tech cards for the meta. Rank up until you have more dust for those.
---
So let's nerf them BOTH!
---
Wow...Turn 5 Tip of the Scales was nothing compared to this. Yeah, no thanks, i think i will take Dr Boring lol
---
Well phaoris doesn’t specify if it’s original cost or current cost
---
Well you can look at the chart whenever you have to pick a new treasure
---
So... instead of drawing you get a zeyhrus suggestion? I dont know. Might End with Million of tirions and mindcontrols.
---
Playing on Wild is a lot more tame compared to playing on Standard right now. If you don't want to be on the receiving end of the current top tier decks like Warrior, Conjurer Mage and friends as frequently (you can of course encounter them, but not that often), give it a try.
---
Deathstalker Rexxar was horrible OP.
---
Silliest card in the game.
---
Outjerked /r/hearthstonecirclejerk again
---
I mean, you still probably won't. And they have their reasons, the two cards that you've mentioned are rotating out at some point if I'm not mistaken, and the Wyrm and Cleric cards are meant to stay around. So you don't know how many well designed cards they have had to pass on in the past because they were too OP with Wyrm or Cleric (there's always the I believe overlooked aspect of balancing results of Recombombulator/ Evolve/ Devolve, etc.). Voicing your discontent or even quitting the game is one way to show that you disagree, but honestly you just seem salty.
---
Tirion now costs (11) mana
---
Really tired of all these initiative value generators smh
---
Lol what kind of advanced cuntery is this
---
I just bought the bundle and got a legendary after my first 9 SoU packs. So with that, I will assume it doesn't affect the pity timer
---
How do you define serious players? Seems a lot to me...
---
It's really hard to nerf boom so I think he's gonna get the hall of fame treatment.
---
If the keep him they need to change the rush mechanic, change blast shields cause 7 armor is too much and remove omega devastator and the Tomb Warden from the mech pool.
---
[you know what that means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7f0sbxR1G0)
---
And how about the other set ? Thx
---
except you also take 8 when attacking him
---
I thought this was sarcastic, why are you being downvoted?
---
Maybe they meant last as in most recent to get nerfed?
---
This doesn't make any sense at all.
---
Playing ragnoros! I was assuming that was the basis of saying 4 in the first place.
---
Dr. Boom is bad in wild already. I ran into 1? to Rank 4 this season. Agreed though, just HoF it so the low ranks can have fun with it
---
Give him two negative hero powers, like deal 7 damages to youself or sth, and make him get 7 different hero powers.
---
I... Am a huge idiot. I forgot he discovered it off of messenger Raven.
---
I was playing Secret Mage in wild as well, with many mirrors happening. Its a flavor of the month thing, I guess.
---
Beat it pretty handily with Even Shaman. Reno decks also work well against it.
---
\*laughs in Mech Hunter\*
---
That is true unfortunately. Prep nerf is something that will haunt rogues. However i would say rogue's classic set is very strong and having such a blanket nerf to the classic set is fine, considering blizzard's direction classic set is to make the cards not auto includes, but only included as intentional choices.
---
While their direction isn't something that i would want to talk about, the changes fall in line with what they have been doing over the past 2 years.
---
On the other hand, spells from past expansions will be the one who suffer, as they are released at a lower power level to balance out classic set's strength, they will forever be affected by the prep nerf. We can only look towards future expansions' rogue cards not having to pay such a high price for rogues having a good base set.
---
Most of the artists for hearthstone (if not all) are not hired, but commissioned only when they need the art. That's why many of the artists also still work for other companies too. So, just with my little knowledge about this, is s better way to work than to be hired and limited only to hearthstone things.
---
Ahem, there was a battlecry beast which dealt damage to any character based on the attack....
---
I'm not throwing a tantrum. This all started with your baby rage at people in a simple post approved by they mods. You seem the to be the one that keeps bringing up being mad. Sounds like projection to me. You should probably get some therapy and see why things on the internet trigger you so much.
---
What are the chances of that in wild?
---
Pardon? A 4 mana 4/5 that removes almost anything isn’t good enough? Sorry but I’m gonna have to disagree majorly, it absolutely is good enough and the only reason it’ll have a bad winrate is you play it when behind usually, which does not make it bad e.g the taunts in control mage.
---
It took me some time to process that.
---
I see nothing about a warrior nerf though.
---
I sent you request
---
It could offer savage roar if you haven't attacked.
---
I Just went to second fatigue after 20 min. Im with you, No Mercy.
---
&gt;I would have accepted a nerfed Vanish in standard, given the HOF happened right as they launched the evocation, cycle, freeze, giants-over-board by turn 6 mages. Vanish would have been a way to counter those over the top boards.Also questing paladin is hard to counter these days cus o reborn and the 2:2 copies of mecheggs, a board clear like Vanish would have made that more balanced in the meta. Something to fear at least.
---
Vanish is broken garbage it's basicaly a 6 mana psychic scream from rogue.
---
I played Equality for years, not a single problem. But suddenly.... 
---
It’s not about the powerlevel I guess, more that it doesn’t really fit in Priests Classsidentity .
---
Raven into toki into Reno? Damn, the man was good!
---
Every time I am sick of Standard I see a Wild Meta report and think, hmnn, maybe I should...click...Genn, Baju, Genn, Baku, Genn, Baku. Right, fckti, back to Standard it is!
---
Are you serious? "Let's not nerf the highest winrate deck in the game because Priest hasn't had a winning deck in a long time!" Let's not nerf Control Warrior either because it's only one of the two viable ways to play Warrior right now.
---
That's too big of a nerf and bad for flavour.
---
Ya know a team odd/team even brawl where everyone is randomly assigned Baku or Genn as a locked first card to their deck could be interesting.
---
There used to be a way on battle.net to see your sub history for WoW. 2005/2006ish I probably had about 20 days worth of free play thrown my way because of server issues. I don't think I've had any since because the servers became much more stable around TBC.
---
When would you say is a good time to invest into a deck? Like when the meta stabalizes etc?
---
To be fair they probably didn’t build that card with Rexxar in mind. The original iteration of Rex was suppose to include future beast from being added in. Now on the flip I also hated the idea of not including future beast because the idea of combining two cards was definitely my favorite concept that they introduce.
---
Personally, I find the brawls like this to be incredibly boring. Yes it can sometimes be interesting to have unusual combinations come together, but I don't see why everything has to be random. Why not do the same thing but actually do some design work and make the cards that start in your deck actually work together intentionally... I'm really tired of brawls like this.
---
I get that this is easier to launch and players who don't have access to a lot of cards will still enjoy it, but this is not a fun rng fiesta; if you curve out well, you win, if you don't you lose. It's weird arena where you don't get to choose your cards. Got my pack and got the hell out of there.
---
I like the idea flavour wise. Perhaps on deathrattle you face a 1 health naked goblin with a hero power that does 1 damage called 'throw wrench' or something similar.
---
I see big priest lose, I upvote.
---
I mean degenerate priest combo decks always have a habbit of popping up and being hated. The last priest deck I actually enjoyed playing or playing against was tgt priest.
---
The point is that Activision would rather have the meta decks be the decks that require a crap ton of dust and random niche legendaries/epics (highlander mage) being a great example of this rather than Combo priest that added 5 new cards in and the rest are classic and basic.
---
good luck on your stream.
---
Right now you should definitely wait at least until the next round of nerfs - the lead designer hinted that we'd get the announcement some time this week.
---
Are Togwaggle and Boom really bringing in more customers than Illidan and Arthas?
---
1 really boggles my mind. If it wasn't profitable, Steam, a platform that is basically printing money wouldn't do it. It's even easier with Blizz and their server locks.
---
That would actually be hilarious to see.
---
All the reno decks.
---
10% battery monkaS
---
Opponent still has to deal with 2 big minions. I'd say the opponent has bigger worries than the mage drawing 8 cards...
---
It was definitely not 1 mana.
---
A) Doesn't matter.
---
B) When did it not do that?  From my understanding, they moved the "layer" where the CC aura takes effect.
---
C) It is the same, you're right.  If you don't play Crystal Core (or Tekahn and lackeys... somehow), then Sonya works exactly the same as before.  But because they made changes to how the game treats the CC aura, the interaction between Sonya and CC is different.  Since a Sonya refund is the same as a CC refund, I don't think it makes that much difference which they give a refund for.
---
conjures calling mana cyclone is the best place for quest imo. Tho your deck would almost definetly be better without the quest in it
---
I am a turtle
---
There are three expansions themed around the Scourge/Northrend (Naxx, TGT, TFT). Arthas is really played out at this point. He's had his time in this game. 
---
Tog and Boom are great by the way. I want an Illidan expansion (in fact, I want an entire standard year dedicated to Illidan similar to how EVIL is the main theme of the current standard year) but at the same time Tog and Boom are fun, energetic characters who capture the spirit of what Hearthstone wants to be.
---
Should have played around it
---
Exactly. The same as the winner of souel stated out after his win.
---
People are still playing this game?
---
Play aggro/zoo decks
---
Hmmm.... I'm rather disappointed in this entire situation.... the greed of Blizzard here is really surprising.  It would be trivial to give everyone a free pack and say "oops, our bad, we had a bug so any of you that had only 1 free quest slot lost out on some quests.... its been fixed and here is a pack for your trouble!"
---
Sure, some people who had 2 free quest slots would have gotten a free pack with no pain related to the bug, but whatever, good for them for playing hearthstone enough to have had the empty slots.
---
This would have been a fine, customer oriented solution.  Instead, they quietly patch the bug with minimal communication to the community or players affected by it. 
---
So... I was pretty annoyed, and this strengthened my resolve to stay mostly free-to-play with exception to the solo adventures, which I have always paid for out of pocket.
---
Then today's limited deal is announced... and damn... 20 packs and legendary for $19.99... a legendary from a set where I still need like 8 legendaries!
---
Stay strong Aeopile, don't give them your money!
---
Hello /r/Hearthstone! 
---
Four years ago, [this post was made](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/3cyi15/hearthstone_cards_as_created_by_a_neural_network/) by /u/scfdivine. To this day, [the album of the most absurd results](http://imgur.com/a/IEUSR) is the hardest I have ever laughed. I hurt myself laughing.
---
I created /r/flamewanker on the account /u/Yharnamologist, but stopped using that account years ago. Recently I came across that wonderful but largely dead subreddit, modded myself, and started posting. Many other faithful members have joined in!
---
Consider this an official invitation to come join us in the fun.
---
Bruh, I was at the same situation, but I also had Shirvallah (from Astral Rift)
---
It'd be fine IF they mentioned it before hand that Rexxar wasn't getting the new beasts. The fact is they didn't until it got brought up.
---
He was pretty bad until they gave him rush beasts to work with
---
noooo don't nerf extra arms :'(
---
So...is it legit? :D
---
I’m thinking either up mana close to 10 or remove Omega Devastators mech tag
---
&gt; the horde being depicted as the stereotypical trope of the noble savage is still a pretty problematic thing (edit: with plenty of native american and mesoamerican imagery, I mean come on), so I don't think Blizzard is off the hook.
---
How would you change the depiction to make Blizzard "off the hook," though? What part of it is unacceptable to you?
---
Because personally having negative traits in a fictional culture that vaguely reflects a real world group is not "unacceptable" at all. Otherwise Genn "Build a wall" Greymane post-Second War could be argued as depicting whites negatively. Stuff like that just... doesn't make sense, honestly.
---
So which part of it is unreasonable? Troll cannibalism? Orcish "blood haze"?
---
&gt; I get the issues with changing an established setting and there are some very fair points here, but the bar is really low and a little bit of granular effort wouldn't kill them
---
Maybe, but I could say this about a ton of things not at all real-world oriented. Gnome lore is lacking. Dark Iron characters are sparse to say the least. Why does Zekhan have his own unique model before Rekhan? Etc. etc. etc.
---
The bar is really low on a lot of things. Having "a little bit of granular effort" to make a black human is arguably worse than not putting in the effort at all. Many people don't like "token characters." If you're going to do it, you should do it right. Overwatch does this really well, but WoW isn't Overwatch.
---
Hearthstone could do it very easily though. Just make an original character like they did when they made Reno Jackson, and have him just so happen to be black.
---
But it does have an effect?
---
Normally if you kill the enemy hero you win. If they have a deathrattle that forces a draw, you either have to play around it and heal up to get your usual win, or you leave the game without ranking up.
---
Yeesh.  I said giving a Sonya refund would be acceptable because it's 1600 dust and all Quest decks play Sonya.  You're awfully self-righteous.
---
BuFfiNg HeaLtH iS tHe priEsT IdeNtIty
---
Hall of Fame, along with hagatha and zul'jin.
---
I also feel that "Light the fuses" card is also problematic. Yeah there's another mech deck being run but that card pigeon holes warrior into only playing mechs.
---
"Deal 5 damage randomly spread among enemy minions" is so ridiculous.
---
I'm pretty sure all traps were survival spells back in vanilla
---
yeah ryt
---
How is cleric not a problem for hunter?
---
Hunter cant asnwer a turn 1 cleric
---
I'm playing 2 Expired Merchant in Even Warlock, I can happily play it T2 instead of tapping, I'm also running a single Cruel Dinomancer, I was running two at some point but I could never get this combo off. I'm happy because even if I play it to revive a 8/8 that's already perfectly fine.
---
The high roll is duplicating a Molten Giant, the low roll is Genn. ;)
---
Bran with Dino-Tamer Bran in wild is 2 card 16 damage from hand. 7 mana 10/12 worth of stats with 8 that can go face immediately. It’s a juiced up firelands portal. The deck restrictions make it a bit more even but still the power level of it is nutty.
---
Since wisp is already infinite value, how much value is a card that generates FIVE wisps?????
---
*favored*
---
Yes and Dr Boom is *favored* to make warrior win if its played on turn 7
---
I've lost just as many games I should've won from yogg.  Hes a just god
---
Tomb Warden is also a big deal... Most classes can't deal with an end game where warrior spams tomb wardens. The guys who balanced warrior in the past 3 expansions are beyond stupid.
---
Team 5 stupidity is soul crushing at times.
---
How did you win with the warrior vs the obliterator? I never get enough small minions and draw to beat the damn thing and everything I put down gets insta-banished. I've run with warrior so many times vs this guy and simply never get the option for stealth minions.
---
Yeah, I think the HS team is only like 15 people so they don't have time to do much more than push out new cards.
---
It's a 3/3 without Taunt and it doesn't cost 4 or 5.
---
It could see play but it probably wouldn't. For starters 99% of the Big Priests in this game don't even run ZILLIAX.
---
&gt; Wrong, CC and evolve effective prove otherwise. The cost the card has relates directly to the effect those cards can use it for.
---
Yes, relates directly to the effect **those cards** can use it for.
---
Not the cards that you played themselves.
---
There is no card that says, for instance, "Battlecry: Deal damage equal to this minion's Cost."
---
You cannot say what you just did and then say:
---
&gt; No you are not. The cards still behave exactly as they say they should behave. 
---
In the first you are acknowledging CC and evolve effects. In the latter you are completely ignoring them.
---
That's silly.
---
&gt; Yet we can see when costs have changed go back to hand
---
As does **every single stat and enchantment of a card.** Because as they have extremely clearly established, board--&gt;hand--&gt;deck always reverts cards to their base form.
---
&gt; There is nothing wrong with changes of that type if they are deemed to improve the enjoyment of the game for the majority of players.
---
And making this unintuitive change when there's only one, arguably two problem cards seems like an unreasonable uplift of the majority of players' game intuition.
---
Hence, nerf CC and maybe Fleshshaper, go from there.
---
&gt; Agree to disagree.
---
No, not really. Mountain Giant repeatedly comes up whenever hand size does. Conjurer's Calling was not the first time people have complained about big stats for discounts. Thing From Below was another marvellous example.
---
What kind of comment is that? 
---
Should they nerf the second highest wr deck ? So the best one even gets better? 
---
If people want nerfs for the sake of a change to the meta, the most influential decks have to change. In my opinion that’s Warrior Priest Mage and probably tip the scales Pally. 
---
Leaving Priest untouched would also be problematic for the future, since generally Priest gets very good cards in the last expansion of the year.
---
Just hall of fame it so I get the dust and I’ll just switch to Aggro warrior.
---
I'm confident it will not reset the pity timer.
---
Is this explorer bundle that’s now in the store a good value? My only hesitancy is that it has Witchwood packs and not the latest set with it.
---
The best one drop left in core?
---
Why not?
---
*tump* *tump* *tump* ROAAAAAAAR
---
Yeah i like King Krush
---
Also Hakkar is really cool
---
Yeah even before this expansion when I didn't play Mage I never felt like they were a problem since the super high rolls only happened once every 2-3 games and I always had a backup plan for whenever it happened. Plus you can always just rush them down with face damage since they lack healing. 
---
Warrior just makes you go insane, even when I'm playing Mage and even though Warrior is my highest winrate matchup it's my most hated by far just because of how annoying they can be.
---
Don't worry guys , I gave up i couldn't do it to George:&gt;
---
Can't really expect anything else from u/ur_mom_my_slave
---
Giants are cards that you want to cheat out. A 3 mana 8/8 is infinitely more powerful on turn 3 than it is on turn 8.
---
Oh yeah :D
---
Thanks a lot.
---
But that guy needs to split his Archangels :P
---
Shield slam on 1? Without any armor?
---
Dr Boom could learn a thing or two from D.Va
---
But the card is not Dr Booms mech suit or something like that, its named Dr Boom, as in you become a goblin, not a mech. Piloted shredder is referencing the mech, not the pilot
---
Jarraxus isnt qualified as a minion, just a demon and hero and sac pac only works because it says destroy a demon, not destroy a demon minion
---
When does this leave the shop?
---
That, or the wrong server (US/europe/asia).
---
Half is an understatement. I'd say it's closer to 80%.
---
League of Explorers, an adventure, was more meta changing than many expansions.
---
I prefer the Shudderwock
---
$0
---
It just takes time. Thousands of people make T1 decks every expansion for free.
---
The only thing paying does is that you can have *more* competitive decks. But if you have the best one already, more decks doesn't make you better, in fact if you play any other but the best one it makes you worse.
---
So you pay for variety/fun, not to be competitive.
---
Next goal, deck building
---
I think they should add a quest for playing ranked. Like the Tavern Brawl quest. The reward for such a quest can be significantly higher than the rest of the quests. Like “Win 5 games in ranked mode: 200 gold”. It should be a rare quest like the challenge a friend quest. This also encourages people to play ladder and gives them a reward for playing ladder. 
---
I also think they should do away with all the 50 gold quests and replace them with new 60 gold quests.
---
Without DS and EA, Priest is T3
---
OH ITS PLAYABLE ALRIGHT
---
Honestly, I think giving all mechs in your deck +1/+1 could be fair.  Makes him really strong in a mech deck and not so strong in a pure control deck.
---
because water is a universal human right
---
Reminds me of Blood Manos
---
This actually aids big priest is already op wtf.
---
Thanks a lot for the answer. I hope they could release more information about the new adventure. I saw that they were thinking of adding new cards between two expansions, not sure if they will do that this time.
---
&gt; Q: Typical work day?
---
&gt; A: walk to work, call ben brode, ask him what do i do, so many challenges. then i go on reddit, everyone is angry, and i cry. then i go home.
---
&gt; I'd like to feel emphatic for him, but I just can't. Not with how much of a fuck they don't give.
---
Sarcasm.  That was sarcasm.  (As were about half of his replies).
---
I remember variations of spell hunter, secret hunter, Egg/DR hunter being tier 1 for like a year and a half. Mech Hunter has been tier 1 since RoS.
---
I think he should self destruct 1 or 2 turns into fatigue
---
Insane rng
---
I really hate these brawls. RNG Clown Fiestas are not fun and I do not know why they keep repeating things like this.
---
I think if you're a wild player you can simply pick any good deck and you'll win because it's a constructed brawl that doesn't limit your deck, you wouldn't benefit from "buffed" cards though but it should be easy to add a couple crabs as long as you don't pick Big Priest.
---
Slam Slam Priest sounds like a JoJo character
---
For Totem we also have [[Splitting Axe]], which is completely insane.
---

---
4/3/2 | Battlecry: Summon copies of your Totems.  
---
&gt;quest druid is not really a thing in wild outside casual.
---
Oh what, really? I was not aware of that. I mostly fuck around in lower ranked tiers with my golden Whizbang. Whenever I play against Quest Druid, it seems really strong. They lose some tempo early on but their cards have insane value as soon as the quest is finished and they get the new hero power.
---
Oh wait, you're talking about Wild. Yeah, Quest Druid is probably not that strong in Wild considering all of the high tempo decks in the eco-system.
---
It's fucking sad, hopefully all of this is just a bad joke.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
Of course, I wasn't trying to dispute your point. I don't even see Ragnaros or Sylvanas in Wild anymore and they were HoF'd for being OP.
---
Is say your temper tantrum is very 8 year old like. I agree. You should try growing up.
---
Wait, so scargill makes every card is my hand 1 mana?
---
Yes
---
2 occultists? highlander?
---
Magnetize cards can stick onto anything because everything’s a Mech, but if it doesn’t say Magnetize on the card then it doesn’t gain that ability.
---
**If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust.**
---
This is a fun brawl.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
It's just a combo deck. I don't see the problem here. You can't complain about control warrior and combo at the same time.
---
You shouldn't be able to put Kazakus in a Warrior deck
---
Singleton mech murloc dragon elemental shaman is pretty fun for now.
---
nah, send him to wild. standard is low on my priorities. at least in wild we can use it. i just want my cards to hold some fucking value, instead of anything that is good getting destroyed. most of the death knights are barely playable as it is, just send him to wild where we can enjoy him as he is there, and where control warrior doesn't completely dominate.
---
Magnetized works great here, as everything is a mech. Makes for some easy big demons \ beasts
---
Great guide!
---
Only duplicate. Since you wait to play Elise once you have both, it's functionally the same.
---
Outjerked again
---
It's not "that little" variance. That's what it is in Yogg's current state . Pre-nerf Yogg may basically be DOOM! but it's also "cast a few random secrets, throw some random burn and healing around, and rebuild that freshly wiped board with some random minion-summoning spells." Yes, there's more bad spells but there's also just more spells in general which... Right, that just makes the variance even higher.
---
The times where Yogg Pyroblasts your own face for lethal aren't the problem, because you were dead anyway. It's the games you had no business winning, you lost the game fair and square but then you have a "break glass in case of emergency" button for when you're in a situation where DOOM! wouldn't have helped you. It's fun to play, to be sure, but it's not fun at all to be on the receiving end.
---
Yes, that's certainly what I was implying you should do 😂 Well done.
---
I like that, would be like a more balanced ice block that's only good for not losing
---
Ships cannon is straight up busted in this brawl. If it's allowed to stick, it's pretty much GG. Murloc Warleaders buffing every card. Mechwarper making every card cheaper. Whoever wins the board after the first turn or two just starts steamrolling way too quick. No reason to run any cards higher than 3 mana (barring a single Old Murky for crazy finish potential). 
---
Great Brawl to grind out wins. Games are over super quick.
---
I’m sorry to ask this, I’m really not trying to sound like an ass. But do you play wild? 
---
Mage has been bonkers for a while now.
---
If they HoF it you get full dust refund without having to disenchant it, right? I might craft it then...
---
Why did it let me then lol
---
Is that normal?
---
The boom pictured is new boom though
---
I liked redemption into shielded mini
---
And to think leeroy shadowstep could have achieved the same result

Here's my snip-snap aggro shaman deck. Totemic Might is 0 mana savage roar. Scargill is basically 4 mana 4/4 Aviana.
---
2nd Hungry Crab is probably better than no second Hungry Crab, but I don't have it. Likewise, Murk Eye can probably be put in here, but I don't have it.
---
Graphics for HEarthstone were done by many authors, so it's hard to say if there is such a thing as a specific Hearthstone-style, anyway great work
---
Oh yeah I forgot that it isn't conjurer

I see what you're saying, but if odd mage can be as good as it has been, I wouldn't sell even mage short. Consistent removal is not a bad thing. I've seen some... mild success with even mech mage in wild, but it peters out as the game goes on, and a full khadgar combo really might do the deck a lot of good. Hell, Khadgar + Piloted Shredder in a pinch wouldn't be bad. Lots of small synergy there.
---
Remember that even mage can also run hero power synergy tools like that 3/2. Still reactive, probably not good at breaking big shit like big priest, but... then again, you can run polymorph, so why are you worried about big priest?
---
&gt;Dream cards, with their own background, don't trigger the quest
---
About that...
---
https://i.imgur.com/pox7dC8.png

Dream cards usually count as neutral (you can see two Vendettas in the same screenshot that aren't discounted). But apparently the quest is currently the exception to the rule.
---
Insanely aggressive brawl.  Don't plan on bringing any greedy decks.
---
That wouldn't be a problem if we had good egg cards in standard.
---
Back when I  played Deathrattle Rogue in standard with Eggs, Cubes and Necrium Vial; Dynomatic would suck my eggs, big time.
---
Just tested it, they became (0).
---
Cancer mage and control warrior deserves each other in hell.
---

---
How did this happen?
---
Yup. 
---
I always open the store in safari and pay the cheaper price versus in app. 
---
The new standard bundle is 27.99 CAD in app and 24.99 CAD in mobile browser.
---
That’s some kind of bug that’s been posted a few times in the last couple weeks.
---
Not all the HPs are the issue, 
---
Just Discover a mech and Blast Shield really
---
Tons of spells can deal with that board. And random mage spells are not always useful. Cyclone mage isn’t even a tier one deck anymore. You have to view these things in context with what is going on around it. Mech Hunter doesn’t have a win condition around cheating mana and it’s still the best deck.
---
well I guess I'm skipping this brawl because I can't make a deck that makes use of the gimmick

Hey DrDoomMD, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Yeah agreed.  It also makes CC a useless emergency counter to hard aggro like mech hunter and  Underbelly Angler.  This means that Control/Big Mage is going to be even *more* susceptible to aggro (which, unlike Control Warrior, is actually still a real problem for Mage).... 
---
So with Control decks and Combo priest potentially seeing big power reductions.... guess we're back to Hunter aggro meta?
---
Hey! Getting back into the game after a long break(last played right as old gods dropped). I played a decent amount and used to be able to ALMOST get legend with a couple different fairly meta decks. I just bought and played the dalaran solo and LOVED it. Now im itching to play more ranked again but have no idea where to start. I looked up some current meta decks from control warrior to "bomb" hunter. I really like the reborn paladin deck ideas, but im looking at like 8k dust just to make the one deck.. i do have 12k dust so i CAN.. but im very scared to craft niche cards that i may not get much use out of. Are there any legendary/meta cards i can craft that fit a lot of different decks? Should i just go slow and build up current cards w.o crafting them? I feel like it would take forever w.o dumping my dust but it took forever to get this much.. sorry for the wall of texts im just hoping for some pointers
---
MY FINNED CHILDREN FILL THE SEA
---
Time for crab
---
Yeah, I think the answer (as many others have proposed) is to make a new evergreen set out of existing cards. Pick what actually makes sense to keep using in every expansion and send the rest of Classic to wild.
---
Then, if necessary, or just to change things up, you could just rotate cards in and out of that evergreen set.
---
For instance Whizbang is 100% a card that should live forever. I'd argue Saranite is another that you mention that would be a great card to have around forever - not too powerful to overshadow new expansions but strong enough to use occasionally. 
---
Yeah, this would be a major change up front but it seems so important for the long term health of the Standard format.
---
But it's cheaper for me on my phone
---
Why is it a cancer deck? Which deck
---
[[Tip The Scales]]?
---
I always mass disenchant because I like to have a rough estimation on how much available dust I have for future cards/decks.
---
Something like a temporary Hero change would be interesting. Just like the old bosses in Solo Mode where they would change their hero power and heal for a bit when they got killed in their first phase. This way Boom would just be temporary until it got killed. It wouldn’t be an absolute powerhouse it is currently.
---
Give it like 10-15 HP, remove all current armor and return it once Boom dies. The mechs wouldn’t have Rush the whole game anymore and the normal Hero Power is useless compared to Boom.

I mass disenchant because it's not worth my time to disenchant individual cards or wait for nerfs. I'm not f2p though, so dust isn't generally a concern.
---
No, again, they're completely different. Tempo Rogue and Mid Hunter are nothing alike. Mid Hunter does not fit my description at all.
---
He got a shudderwock from academic espionage...  
---
I'll let you put that together and apologize later.  
---
I ain't no control warrior scrub. I banned his control warrior.
---
It’s time consuming but I search “extra” in my library. That shows you all cards that you have more than 2 copies of, regular and gold combined. 
---
I pick and choose, keeping cards I think have a chance at being nerfed, and dusting everything else till I have enough to craft whatever Shitty meme card I’m building around. Since they’ve been more active lately at nerfing it’s actually been worth it.
---
It wasn't meant to be a sarcastic comment. Just wondering if it can take one further up the ladder or if you're getting stomped past rank 5 with this.

a control warrior complaining about skill
---
I honestly think Dr Boom going to 10 mana does it. Push him off for three turns. Give me 3 more turns to genuinely punish Warrior before they use this hilariously overpowered card against me. OR! Give it overload 10. I'm fine with either. OR! "Give your mechs in your hand rush". Just stop making them 2/3 for 1 us. Also LPG should say "minions in your hand cost 1" and cost 7. Suddenly game is fine.
---
The entirety of the world, wants to know the location of Nestle, so we can fuck over them

I think that's what the tavern brawls are for- the build your own deck ones anyways. This way people without collections can still enjoy the content.
---
You are now on my illustrious list of crazy fuckers, right under my brother. CONGRATULATIONS!
---
My definitions are fine. Your interpretation isn't.
---
I approve of this.
---
Exactly, I could easily see a future legendary like "8 mana, set all your minion's attack equal to their health" and then priest having a win condition and reward for buffing their minions and preserving them all game instead of turn 5 28/28 nuke.

---
How are you counting 10? I only see 3 in the Out of Cards post? And we got 3 for the launch of expansion so 6 total if you include those?
---
When trying to get away from the mana cheating high roll RNG garbage that is plaguing Standard meta, this Tavern Brawl really does the trick.
---
can you post a screenshot of tier 1-2 decks from ranks 10-legend and 25-legend (all ranks)? Last 3 days for both.
---
I dont think thats the best way to do it. Like maybe make it The first mech you play each turn has rush, and change the discover HP to random.
---
Haven't played since old gods. How's the current game, thinking of getting back in?
---
So Warlock gets 2 0 mana inconditional removal that heals them for 5. Fellsgoodman

---
It works like lightbomb in that case. It considers the card's max health and heals by that amount. Thus, it will kill anything with Auchenai.
---
Hall of Fame is fine. Blastmaster Boom is still available, along with Hack the System.
---
I believe coin was better in some of the top 2 or 3 brawls
---
I feel like subbing to both this and Customhearthstone is going to make me repeatedly think I'm having a stroke.
---
You should try sac pact on top.
---
I know. You play the one you like the best.

I didnt say play the same one.

Today i think standard is best.

Later i might prefer Wild.

Also if you enjoy dungeon run be sure to try peter whalen’s mobile game “Dream Quest”. Amazing mobile pve card game.

Slay the Spire is great too.

If it feels bad to lose to? I agree it feels bad, answer after answer after answer isn't cool I get it. But at least try to get my reasoning. Is warrior a problem? Yes to some extent yes. Is mage a problem? A much bigger one imo. There's nothing wrong in trying to adjust your already good deck to be better against the local meta you're facing. The deck list isn't set in stone.
---
I played against a guy who did the exact same thing. It was hilarious. I'm pretty sure he just copied his standard control deck into the brawl without reading it.
---
I had a 39-turn game the other day that I think was well over half an hour (wasn’t timing it)
---
Ideas are bulletproof
---
Nice reference
---
Sac pac 0 mana. Scargil = 4 mana aviana. Etc etc
---
Ya, only that
---
I still play the deck and know that Quest Mage, Snip-Snap warlock, Odd rogue/paladin and Secret mage will kill you before your DK is even active. Jade druid can have 70 HP by turn 6 and Odd warrior is incredibly resilient while running brann and coldlights to win in fatigue already. Genn and Baku would have dropped unnerfed Raza Priest power level to t2 maybe even t3. Quest Mage would push that power level even further. The deck is insane. Now Razakus is barely a playable meme and that wouldn’t change with sometimes healing for free on 5. Getting DK online is a pipe dream in most games. Genuinely I think anyone afraid of bringing back Raza is afraid of the old standard Boogie Man and hasn’t looked into the archetype since the nerf.
---
&gt; It doesnt' say "cost they were played at" nor does it say "cost they are on the board" so if Blizzard changes the functionality to be the cost they are on the board and the board cost retains it's played cost then the function of what CC says it does has not changed at all.
---
That's a very roundabout way of saying that you are changing the function of CC.
---
When targets do not retain their base cost, cards that interact with their costs are changed as well.
---
Very much so how Mekgineer Thermaplugg was changed when Leper Gnome was nerfed to a 1/1. Mekgineer Thermaplugg still summoned Leper Gnomes, but Leper Gnomes were different.
---
Conjurer's Calling still summons random minions of the same cost, but the Cost is different (in certain contexts; also noting this can affect any minion played from hand that has been discounted by Thaurissan).
---
&gt; Stat and enchantment - not cost.
---
Cost is a stat.
---
&gt; That's a reach since you can't really speak for everyone else.
---
If you can't see that this uplifts a majority of player intuition, you're either being silly or disingenuous. Either way, I'm going to ignore this nonsense "counterpoint."
---
&gt; Either way, neither of us can say who is right as we can't speak for the community.
---
I don't need the community's feedback or permission on this. I'm saying the problem that has been identified stems from two individual problem cards, not the mechanics themselves.
---
That point stands regardless of whether you or any amount of people agree.
---
&gt; Hans size, board size ... when exactly do we want to stop?
---
Mountain and Sea Giant are literally the only two cards that are in the Evergreen set that discount themselves. Mogu Fleshshaper is just a different Sea Giant, but it rotates out and can be subject to easy nerfing.
---
Discounted by other things includes Summoning Portal discounting another Summoning Portal, Pint-Sized Summoner discounting another Pint-Sized Summoner, Far Sight drawing into Far Sight, or Dread Corsair being discounted by weapon Attack. None of these have proved mechanically problematic, though I think some people are tired of the "free Dread Corsair when you play a powerful weapon" that happens in some metas.
---
It's like Divine Spirit/Inner Fire, "which one is more to blame"? Except instead of both of these cards being Evergreen, only one of them is. The discounted Mountain Giant.
---
If you want to nerf that interaction, nerfing Conjurer's Calling does the job. Like I said in my original response, there is no "inherent issue," because the toxicity of a card's design only comes to light when it is powerful enough. Patches the Pirate would not have been a broken card at all if the only other Pirate in the game was a Vanilla 2 Mana 2/1. Similarly Ice Block's "Buy a turn" FeelsBad feels would be easily counteracted by doubling its Mana Cost.
---
And if those absurd hypotheticals aren't enough, I go back to the very real example of Luna's Pocket Galaxy not at all being a remotely "problematic" card at 7 Mana. Exact same 'toxic effect,' but much weaker.
---
In any case, your problems stem from a tiny selection of cards: Fleshshaper, Mutate, Mountain Giant, and Conjurer's Calling. Throw in Sea Giant just in case. That's 5 cards.
---
Mechanical changes on 5 cards when those mechanical changes impact tens of cards just seems excessive.

Personally, not a huge fan of how a lot of old adventure fights were made significantly easier by niche epics or legendaries that were otherwise completely useless.

---
I don’t hate mage. As a long time player, I’m just jealous that mage always seems to be the default class for getting fun and interesting cards.
---
To my knowledge it’s a full dust refund but I’m not sure.
---
Full dust refund plus disenchant I think where as nerf is only on disenchant iirc
---
I'll never understand what this sentence means, isn't a circlejerk supposed to be for hating on things, this post is just a meme.
---
I think it counts, as I got 14/50 first game and I am fairly certain I didn't play 14 actual murlocs
---
Ah see, I wasn't putting Naga giants into the meta. 1 Because it was stupid. 2. They should have left it the way it was before they changed the interaction. What I wouldn't mind is for it to be unnerfed but it works the way it did when it was in standard. But I'd group the Naga giants deck with AK47 druid as things that should not be reverted(and with druid it's mainly Aviana Kun that need to stay nerfed.)
---
Those two wouldn’t even be “auto include” in *Standard* at this point. Just bring them back. Permanent changes like that, born of stubborn attachment to a decision, are just silly.

---
me too
---
Yeah but the longer the game the more chance you have of highrolling in return and possibly making a comeback (at least with some decks)
---
Yeah, Dalaran Heist was great. I can only hope that the next adventure will be as good if not better, that would save the expansion for me. There's no doubt in my mind that some of the people working on Hearthstone are incredibly talented and know what fun actually is, it's just that... they don't apply that to every part of the team, so to speak. 
---
But enough negativity. Thank you to the mission game designers and thank you to the people who make tavern brawls. Thank you voice actors and thank you guys who make boards and card arts and stuff for breathing so much life into this card game and separating it from all the rest. You guys genuinely deserve a medal, cause I don't think Hearthstone would have been much more different than the original wow ccg had it not been for you! &lt;3

This. The more I think the game is starting to feel super stale, the more I realize it's not because of Classic/Basic, it's because of Team5's inability to design interesting sets and cool new designs. I play Magic quite a bit as well, and Magic has cards that have literally been in every Standard format. Hell, Giant Growth was printed in ALPHA (the first set ever, 26 years ago) and still gets reprinted at least once a year, and Magic doesn't feel stale, even though I've been playing it quite a bit longer than Hearthstone. 
---
To me, the biggest issue with Hearthstone, as a game, is that they've limited the space they can work with so much by: not having Graveyard interaction, real Deck interaction, meaningful interaction with the opponent outside of minion combat, like targeted Discard, instant-speed spells/counterspells. I'm not saying Hearthstone should do all of this, but having none of it limits what they can do with designs so much, since everything has to be focused on improving yourself or controlling the board.
---
Amara reads "set your health to 40". Nothing about heal or restore.
---
You can’t be serious lol
---
For anyone else who does want to know the odds: 1/minions left in deck.
---
I disagree, random legend = 1 you dont have meaning 1 you didnt craft. I craft the legendaries I need. What I don’t craft are other cards like epics and rares. 1 legend you dont use is worth less to me than possibly rares ad epics that havent been crafted yet
---
This weeks brawl, and those like it are kind of frustrating for me.  Not only do I not have most of the cards outside of standard, but I don't know those cards either.  It's really hard to play even semi intelligently when you don't know what is even able to be played.  
---
Also, shaman is stupid good in this brawl because they have great elemental, totem, and murloc synergies that you can mash together.
---
JUST WISH DONT SUFFER IN SILENCE
---
 ......
---
I'm a fucking idiot, aren't I?
---
1 pack is equivalent to 40 dust on average on legend is = to 400 dust
---
Wild is definitely not more f2p friendly than standard, especially not for a new player. You have to craft almost every single card in your deck, which is far far beyond a new players means. Play standard, at the very least until your first rotation, wild is for old players and rich players.
---
It's the only other minion in my deck you fool!

There is an issue because I, in my infinite idiocity, made the 'summon giant' a deathrattle minion instead of a battlecry one, meaning people can evolve into the 1/0 minion that would instantly die and give them a 8/8.
---
You could make the argument that as Death Knight is a class in WoW, cards that are from the Death Knight "class" count as being from a different class while Ysera doesn't fulfill that same criteria.

But weapon destruction clears half the board, with the addition of preventing next turn damage from the weapon, and possibly bouncing a good minion for my opponent. Yes, you can say that he is not aware some of these things (for example the weapon deathrattle specifics), but you can't say the choices he gave "makes complete sense".
