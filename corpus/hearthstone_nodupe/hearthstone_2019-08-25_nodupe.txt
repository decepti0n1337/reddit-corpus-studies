Welcome to reddit lmao

No it's not. Where are you getting this from? There are stats derived from millions of pack openings, as well as the stats Blizzard provided to China, that place the mean at around 1 in 20.

It actually does (57-58% IIRC). 80% against control warrior.

So is the matchup just decided on whoever gets better rng off of Elysiana. I've never watched a mirror and never will in my life.
---
I play in Casual mode to practice decks that I haven't played in a while sometimes, but I will go in with meta decks. The fact that the Priest has everything in Golden probably means that it's a favorite deck/they've played it quite a bit, so I kinda doubt they're doing that.
---

---
Unless they have a *full golden* collection, which would be kinda insane. Based on a quick calculation, a full golden collection would take 3,724,000 dust to craft, which would take about 37,240 packs to collect. Assuming you can buy each pack for $1 each (biggest bundle/Amazon coins), you'd have to spend $37,240 to get one... *damn*.
---
Based on the most popular Big Priest decklist on [hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/decks/dg0z0nnqTkKpLSW0b4KaFh/#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;tab=overview), that deck alone would take 39,200 dust to craft, or ~$400 worth of packs. Still, *damn*.

Yesss build ur new reno controllock

Disenchant the deck.

the purpose of the post?

Hey RejectKid89, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".

Plus for doomguard you're in wild and there are far better ways to cheat it out.
---
If you don't need the dust, don't disenchant anything. If you do need, do not mass disenchant and only go for those that look really weak and will never see play.

I thought it was obvious because Cube Hunter (and Deathrattle Hunter with the Oozeling) was extremely popular.

I think sleep spores all minions should fall asleep. They wake up at the start of your turn so it is okay for yours to fall asleep too. Deadly moves is kind of expensive but if it wasn't I don't know if there wouldn't be any downside since you can just play assassinate for 5 mana. Would be good with lackeys but I just don't know if it is worth running.  I think I would like to see sidequesting adventurer as a 4/5 for 3 mana but you can only play it if you have a quest in yoru deck at the start of the game or something like that but I think that would be too complicated. I think it is pretty cool.
---
You have been banned from r/cryptocurrency
---
Happy national waffles day, waffles.
---
whizbang decks are in the godilock zone. strong enough to win you some games, but not too strong that you can compete with the best decks in the meta. and i think they achieved that level.
---
Golden Thaurissan.
---
Sidequesting Adventurer should be a 3/4. We’ve gotten to the point of having many minions with vanillas stats + effect and none of them have been problematic (except Omega Devastator).
---
RIP Warlock and Druid.
---
I think it is important to remember that people playing these decks are not great at the game. They are most likely playing in the rank 15-20 range. If Murloc Shaman was really a 58.5% win rate deck we would be seeing a lot more of that being played.
---
To be fair, the other guy isn't too kind in the first place.
---
I am pretty sure at least a few people streamed making it to legend back when he was first released. I don't think I would call that always garbage.

someone posted rankings a couple hours after your comment. Turns out it is the second worst of his decks this expansion. It is really really bad

Even Pro players often get wrong about cards and meta. Your best bet is to wait.
---
There's a thread on this sub for that very thing!
---
Yeah it's slow lol, rarely ever finish off an opponent. They usually just concede when they run out of removals. I've tried pyromancers and vargoth and a bunch of other minions but they fuck up res and lower my winrate.
---
One of my favorite cards in the game. It might not be incredibly strong but it has my favorite animation and voice line. https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/76960?page=2#c117
---
The rest seem pretty fair but sleeping spores should probably get a nerf. Using sleeping spores when you have a decent board is just too op and unfun to play against. The nerf I think will be appropriate is after an enemy attacks your hero enemy minions fall asleep.
---
Most of these are bad, and the ones that aren’t that bad imply really weird gameplans, like a lackey deck that’s to spend 5 mana and two cards on a big taunt minion.
---
I think they missed the card pun, or were trying to card pun a HoF card that also got nerfed.
---
I get the dust from the extra copies eventually: when the cards go to wild.
---
Right, I'm an idiot. I'm going to ship back my degree now.
---
Chump made an aggro highlander hunter with no secrets and no siamat that works really well
---
I like the way you evaluate cards, with a focus on realism (would blizzard actually print this?) and flavor. I wish more people would upvote simple cards that could actually fit into the game instead of adding new gimmicky mechanics like Jinx or pure hate cards like Sidequesting.
---
Im stealing this for my league games. Is k?
---
52% at legend- it's a serviceable deck that would be broken with more good stuff.
---
Just some general tips:
---
Know when to try control board and when to go face, the decks you play are generally aggro so you need to know when you have the reach to just go for the kill.
---
Also on that, know when to extend, if you're already winning on board, usually theres no point vomiting out the rest of your hand if you're gonna end up playing into a board clear.
---
Play to win, don't play to not lose, in practice it looks like sending eviscerate into face to try and hope you draw leeroy or Myra's for lethal instead of sending it into a minion to survive another turn and be 4 damage off of lethal
---
*Usually* there are 2 ways to win:
---
* Someone gets their Dr. Boom early and their opponent does not.  You amass too much tempo/value.
---
* Archivist Elysianna RNG
---
They might have tech cards that help the matchup but that is about it.  Unless you are super unlucky, good players won't lose to tempo on board before Elysiana if Boom is played about the same time.
---
SPLITTING AXE
---
Pulled 5+1 golden so far.
---
The real issue is town crier it should be 2 mana and would still probably see play if only at one
---
I played with this fucking asshole 2 games. I shit you not, in both games, he slept 4 turns in a row. Never attacked once.
---
The best, cheapest deck currently in standard is going to be that priest deck that's getting nerfed this week, so I can't really recommend crafting it until we see whether it vanishes after Extra Arms goes back up to 3.
---
Surely it's less to do with Armagedillo itself, and more to do with things like Zilliax and Tomb Warden being buffed by it (and having charge from boom), as well as Flunky frequently finding Dillo
---
Good momentum card, plus if you give it taunt it’s pretty decent.
---
Its a joke
---
You need at least 50 wins to become good at a deck. Maybe you're jumping back and forth between decks causing this. Pick one deck you like playing that's at least tier3 on hsreplay and focus on it. Trust me you will be good. Then move on.
---
I don’t understand why it can attack twice.
---
I’ll rephrase, cause I do get why, I just think it’s stupid. Being reborn shouldn’t allow a minion to attack a second time in a turn. Change my mind.
---
no, not "would", but "could"
---
Pure luck this is a bad deck
---
It's because of the "sleep" effect.  It's the same effect non-charge/rush minions have when you summon them.
---
It will get you to rank 5 now easily and after the nerfs it should be easier. Mage was my harder matchup.
---
Waaait a minute...

I mean, Raza’s kinda niche. Like you either build around him or you don’t.
---
That's why he said if such a card is printed. Assuming it existed, you could help increase the odds of drawing him or other big demons for the power turn with Sense Demons. Maybe even Plot Twist to add consistency to draw the combo. You can pull big wild exclusive demons like Voidlord, Abyssal Enforcer, Mal'ganis, Doomguard, etc. for a highroll akin to Bloodbloom + Darkest Hour. None of this is likely obviously and this is purely theoretical however *mana cheat* cards have been historically powerful for the eternal format.
---
I'd be wary to dismiss the card's future potential simply for its current performance in Renolock.
---
Mine has marked shot and ursatron.
---
But desert spear is definitely interesting
---
&gt;Where do you get the idea from that he lost? And just because you get an invite after a game doesn't mean they're there to rage. Sure, it's the majority but I've had enough people add me (and I've done that too) to play 80g or spectate quests because it's 3 am and everyones asleep.
---
I'm guessing... People rarely add you to insult you after they win. I've got my fair share of rage invites and they were nearly exclusively after loses from the opponent. And I'm talking about the entire context, not the invite alone. So I still stand by my previous comment - you have to be absolutely naive to think that it was anything else than insulting in the OP.
---
About your last point... I'm from Poland and I personally know many people from across the eastern border. A few years back (when I was still studying), I lived in the same apartment with a guy from Russia for a year, and played video games with him and his friends. And majority of them could speak English (even if broken). They often don't do it deliberately, but CAN do it if they want to nonetheless. The thing about those numbers is that they include everyone. Older people can't speak it, because they simply were never taught it. Not sure if those studies include kids too, but if yes, then they also can't speak it for obvious reasons.
---
When you google the number of people in Poland who can speak English you also get relatively low numbers. 37% is the highest I could find, but I saw some sources that were way below 30%. Does it mean that only about third of the Polish players you meet in Hearthstone could speak English? Of course not. Nearly all of them could. That's because, in general, people who play video games have a massive overlap with people who speak English. Nearly everyone in their teens or 20's (plus early 30's) speaks English here (not perfectly, of course, but enough to communicate basic stuff), and those are people who you're most likely to meet when 
---
While, from my experience, English language knowledge is worse in Russia, majority of people who would be in the Hearthstone target age should be able to speak it at a minimal level. Definitely enough to communicate something like "80g quest" (because that's literally ALL you need to say if you would invite someone for it).
---
Of course, I have no idea whether the Russian person from OP could speak English or not, but given my experience, it's highly plausible. I make an educated guess.
---
I mean, I play my normal decks in casual, but those are jank decks like C'Thunwock Shaman or Renounce Darkness Warlock. I don't even play meta decks in ranked, but my more competitive and less garbage decks (except Reno Mage, which I had a version of, before it became meta). Casual mode is still largely filled with the same shit, I want to avoid ranked for; often badly piloted, relatively often a bot.
---
Nice
---
Still. I'm not saying there shouldn't be rng I'm saying it mainly relies on RNG...
---
It was the whole combined package of Patches that made him so strong. You're intentionally misleading.

---
I obviously didn't mean it that way why are you making fool of yourself?

I feel weird quest warlock, heal druid, and quest warrior are not only the funniest decks I've played but the ones I usually win with. I lose almost every Hunter and Mage match I play.
---
Image hadn't loaded and I expected Ysera
---
i think people upvoted your comment because they interpreted the you're as me being the subject. My god.
---
Your first mistake was not conceding immediately to someone who was willing to spend 80 dollars on an expansion
---
He would probably gives to you a lighting bolt if you had 1 mana left; or an eviscerate at 2 mana left. Now, about doomsayer, he probably doesn’t understand that he is silenced - because otherwise it wouldn’t make any sense.

Last season I was playing control shaman and meet many pogo rogues at hih legend, both decks were 45-48% at hsreplay, so it's all up to player. You can always add 4-5% by piloting. Uplayable territory is 42%-.
---
Count me in as well, rogue all the way.

2 mana 3/2 is a premium body. This guy gets it.

Barnes is an adventure legendary so he doesn’t come from packs. He’s guaranteed in either the second or third wing the the Karazhan adventure
---
Highlander Quest Shaman?
---
What if the Lucentbark gets silenced, or worse, polymorphed/hexed?
---
&gt; is a classic so should be lower power level
---
Absolutely not. Class cards should be a slightly higher power level than neutral cards to promote a varied meta, but Legendaries should not be more powerful than Commons and expansion cards should not be more powerful than Classic cards.
---
Might wanna wait until a week after the balance change goes live, since the meta will be shaken up.
---
My first gold! thank you!
---
Cant execute your own minions.
---
It's definitely better. A lot of games will be decided by the time that 8/8 comes down. The weapon can immediately remove a threat and grab you the board up to 3 turns before the Octopus will net you any value. Additionally, it Val'anir goes well with smaller minions and has synergies with the types of decks that aren't greedy and play for the early board. Precisely what the arena is all about and what paly excels at.
---
Priest was Overpowered!....... Said no one ever. Everytime priest gets a small chance to compete it gets nerfed into the ground. Bizarre
---
Then just concede? You wasted your opponent's time smh
---
Still no 12 win arena key. Get on it :p

---
Done. Your deck slots have been reduced from 18 to 9 as per your request. - Blizzard Customer Support
---
It could be yes
---
I dont get sleep spores
---
Ive found that just being lucky is a consistent strategy
---
No, you make a high tempo deck and hopefully have the board by the time valanir comes down. Any argument about valanir being slow is doubly true for and 8/8 deathrattle. You realize that you might brick on 6 if you take any 8 drop right? If you draft valanir first, you can conceivably make a deck that tops out at 6 or 7 and closes games quick with low value cards. On average, this is the deck you will get. I have over 20k arena games so, yeah, ymmv but I have been an infinite player since the beta and I tend to draft early picks on the philosophy that not all decks will make 7+, but over 85% should. Valanir is superior as a turn one pick because it has a better chance of pushing you from 5 to 8 where octo will be better from 9 to 12 wins. The octo is the more valuable card, just not in this scenario.
---
The meta was terrible because of these two. You HAD to play an even or odd deck to be able to win any game. Sometimes when I matched  odd paladin I just conceded without even trying, it really wasn't fun. I'm really glad they got moved to the HOF.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Oh yes can't wait for nerfs so that this deck becomes even more retarded.
---
Jesus.
---
I was thinking about that when I got her. I made a little deck for it and almost won most games. The only problem is that I don’t have myra’s, so instead I was using sprint and Octosari. But I kept on killing myself by fatigue  every time it died haha
---
ya this game sounds like a blast
---
insults for sure,no matter what game you're playing,if you add a russian after the match either you win or lose he's going to flame you.
---
I'll take any suggestions for new streamers if it helps me avoid watching the barrage of control warrior matches in GM
---
You can easily hit legend with a midrange hunter. You May need some new epics but I can’t think of any new legendary you have to play.
---
Tyoe "extra" to find more
---
The search feature is not broken, I can search with it without any problems. As other have stated this is a bug that is connected to your settings, it will be fixed. “Utterly broken” facepalm.
---
Oh, what then?
---
F2P players can at least make one deck per expansion. Crazy expensive decks like Highlander or control warrior might be out of the question, but you can at least make bomb hunter or murloc shaman, assuming you've been saving resources for a full expansion cycle.
---
My strategy as F2P is to only open packs when a new expansion is launched then save gold for the entirety of 4 months. During this time I can usually save up 10k gold from gold and wins. (I don't play arena except for the free ticket.) Also I don't craft anything until some time after the nerfs, then just craft one tier 1 deck that I can afford to play for the remaining 3 months
---
I wish I was a big enough HS nerd to ever get this sub
---
Bomb hunter, murloc shaman, token druid, zoolock
---
Millhouse is actually decently playable in arena, just not against certain classes, and with certain sets in rotation. It's suicide when Witchwood is in against Pally, for example (sound the bells). Probably also would be right now because of steed. And if Karazhan is in an early Firelands Portal from a Mage is probably game losing.
---
Not that easily, control warriors are walls you can't pass. Do believe me, have tried since RoS came out. Managed to get to rank 7. Hit 11 or 12 warriors on a row. Good times. And lately I've not seen a way to deal with questing paladin, rouge nor druid. Too fast unless I get a real lucky mulligan. This ofc taking the luck/unluck in card draws into account (I have won against warriors but I could almost heard them cry through the internet cus o crappy card luck).

Outjerked again
---
They should remove the nerf of jaina's portrait when it's golden
---
Highlander Hunter
---
So everybody is wining about warrior and mage right now. Back when Baku und genn were in Standard everybody was wining about Odd Warrior, Odd Pally and Even Pally.
---
Odd Paladin especially pre nerf with level up was just above 63-65% winrate and nearly unbeatable. 
---
Imagine turn 5 15 damage on board after you contested the board already.
---
Yeah, but statistically, people who draft Octosari get more wins in arena.
---
Right, sorry, to be clear, if you put on Charge *that turn*, the card works as you expect.
---
What I mean is after that turn, whenever the Henchman falls asleep, their turns in play get reset to 0 so they get summoning sickness again - except they have charge, so they can attack anyway. And because it's not the turn you played Charge, they can also go face.
---
&gt; Do you know *how* he uninstalled HS after that ?
---
FTFY
---
This is mill druid?
---
Is not any better in standard , RNG can be fun for both players but, it is indeed a card game at the end, but when RNG single handedly wins the game it is a problem, because you don't feel defeated by your opponent but by RNG.
---
That doesn't defend anything I have said about octosari, in your situation it is as bad, even worse since you can't play it that turn at all.
---
I suppose we just have agree to disagree, cause this is getting repetitive and people only talk about one of the cards in each discussion I have on this thread.
---
He was playing hadronox+witching hour so I thought he was taunt druid
---
PTSD can do that to you, yes.
---
Yeah, but that's not necessarily the first pick.
---
Wasn't that the protean hulk combo?
---
Where is secret mage
---
Because mtg works on real world time, if you make your opponent do these rediculously long combos you're actually hindering yourself. You've already lost the game but you can concede and save yourself time to win 2 more games.
---
It's over 9000!
---
Is there a reason to run Finley in this deck for anything other than he's 2 mana 2/3 murloc?
---
The most important thing is that he is a 2/3 murloc but I actually got his effect multiple times. It's really easy to empty your deck with the 2 tip the scales
---
"extra" finds extra cards, doesn't find Extra Arms.
---
"arms" finds Extra Arms.
---
"legendary" finds Weaponized Pinata because it has the word "legendary" in it. That contradicts the above.
---
It's probably  "Revved up like a deuce...'
---
I guess what I'm really asking is it worth 1600 dust. Doesn't seem like it is cause I don't see him as a win condition. Unless I'm wrong?
---
It's both as a rogue, oddly enough
---
Above Rank 10, Wild is probably comparatively weaker versus Standard (meaning less meta decks).  As Aggro, you always have a chance though.
---
That's why they created Standad Mode. There are viruses all over Wild. This is the risk you take. Sorry for your loss.
---
Lights sorrow and alexstrasza are both amazing. Also voidcaller and malganis have such a beautiful color pallete
---
I guess he picked literally the worst one possible. Which makes it a good outcome for you
---
pala is mind boggling
---
Look guys I won a game!

---
He only makes a video or two per month, sometimes he skips a month. Calm down your tits.
---
Quest pally also eats it
---
He probably just queued into a control warrior.
---
he actually didnt upload anything on THIS expansion at all, so it would be really weird.
---
Tx man, gonna try these out.
---
It's a decent quest, too bad Dr. Boom Mad Genious still exists.
---
OK I WANT HIM BACK. He's probably the most underrated HS content creator
---
or as op says he only had noticed it now? thats aslo possible you know.(and some people dont mass dust cause of nerfs and such)
---
lol
---
Instagram? Twitch?
---
Probably worse quest ever created by HS. They should definitely buff this card somehow
---
Quest: Use all of the weapons in your deck.
---
Reward: Gain no benefit as there are no weapons left in your deck.
---
Here's one that I been using for almost a year and been updating it within each new expansion.

---
Again. How rust rich do you have to be to not notice extra legendaries?
---
That’s someone that has never typed in “extra” because they needed dust to craft a card.
---
 didnt see he mentioned an instagram anywhere, on twitch there isnt any past broadcasts or clips from the last months. tho im not sure how to check if his channel even went live, since i think twitch doesnt save the broadcast automatically.
---
Ew
---
Tissue ?
---
Yeah the 10 Bomb Warriors left on ladder surely are an issue ;(
---
And tbh we do know. The Druid takes the fatigue damage in the video, so we know it. And the guy playing knows aswell
---
gg dude, but you missed lethal about 4 times, and that highroll of a hero power has broken me as a person. Luckily, I believe in karma and as such am looking forward to my reward for this event. I wish you well in your future games, but my rage cannot be sated by man nor beast.
---
True
---
I beat control warriors with it often. I expect it to get even better after boom nerf.

Hey everybody! I am rarran, been playing hearthstone since closed beta, and hit legend multiple times! My youtube is normally about making memes and dreams happen, love to make people laugh and have a good time.

THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE SUPPORT!

I’d be surprised if you don’t get more official sponsorship. 
---
I’ve spent about $2k on Hearthstone these last three months after watching your fun decks and Trump’s adventures through Heist Heroic. 
---
You guys definitely centralize a community through your streaming and event involvement, which is why I don’t mind being loose with my wallet for my collection or my friends’ list.
---
Try watching the video
---
I knew this at one point from Face Collector but does Face Collector or the other card go to your hand first?
---
been playing rogue since beta and is always a pleasure to see malyrogue
---
I'll buy into this conspiracy theory. However, upvoted both.
---
I mean that has been the go-to game plan for warrior for a year...
---
It’s not that hard
---
It's neat core of cards that I maintain a positive winrate with but when one weapon removal hits in midgame it falls flat.
---
game changing effects that never see play should be buffed. How could one argue otherwise. Go look at lackey warlock and tell me that not running the card designed for it is in anyway good. Its not. These cards are cool and interesting which is why i targeted them for a buff. Luna is fun card that was just too strong at 5. 
---
and gamechanging effects being overpriced is same thing as saying it should be bad. And I couldn't disagree more. 
---
for phalnax , that card is focusing on attack when attack is not what you want for your taunts. its a simple change, read my reasoning, because i gave an explanation. 
---
vilefiend is just plain bad, even in arena a 2/3 lifesteal is at least playable. 
---
mischief is random and i want to bring decision to it. Not complicated.
---
you will still need cards from SOU, just face the fact that you need to grind with mech hunter a while. And I think that even if is nerfed, control Warrior still is gona be  a tier 1 deck, you can try it before disenchat dr Boom.
---
explain? 2/2 is just bad. There is no reason it should exist. My thinking is simple: make cards that never see play to actually being included and/or creating new decks of their own.
---
Thanks, +1 to "probability of appearing"
---
huh huh look how much smarter I am I know card balance
---
That's what you sound like.
---
SAVE IT! It's probably the most popular and maybe even the most powerful card right now and will be forever in wild eventually. It's in all the top decks right now, Highlander Mage, Highlander Hunter, it even gets run in decks with duplicates because late game its a board clear or a tirion, or a bloodlust to finish the opponent off. It's a fantastic card.
---
It is unfortunate.
---
I played against one yesterday. I won even though I played Tempo Thief Rogue from last expansion lol
---
Overload on minions can be viewed as a pseudo battlecry, so if the minion is summoned, it doesn't trigger.
---
its a digital card game. they can buff and nerf quickly.
---
Lol
---
Now the real question is why you only 3/6 steps completed on turn 8
---
Zoolock.
---
Team 5 could, but weekly balance updates would not be good for the game.
---
Don't disenchant ANY classic legendaries. You'll be really disappointed if you get them again.
---
Don't dust standard cards either, you never know, they might see play and then you'll be really disappointed.
---
Everything else is up to you. If you enjoy playing wild from time to time or you want to keep them in case they will be (potentially) THE SHIT in a upcoming brawl, well, keep them. If youre not interested in playing wild or you have your decks ready for that, dust them.
---
But only when you have something in mind that you want to craft with the dust. Or you will be really disappointed later when you need dust for a legendary and you have nothing to dust anymore :)
---
The primordial glyph is a bit too "infinite value dor my tastes.
---
No he conceded to Ogre
---
Had my first "play Zephrys despite 2+ bombs int he deck" moment the other day so I feel ya
---
No, it isn't inherently part of the spells effect. That's why yogg-spells didn't use to overload you. It was a balance decision after yogg turned out to be too strong.
---
That’s an interesting question. Now I want to test it.
---
ResidentSleeper
---
If you have 2+ bombs, your deck has duplicates so Zephrys/the LoE cards won't work.
---
It doesn't matter. Shadow madness and hex/poly are still the best solution from the situation for the excact mana cost
---
I mean logically it sounds right but you know Blizzard. Lol 
---
Appreciate it
---
You didn’t wish hard enough.
---
It isn't part of the spells effect. Yogg spells used to not overload you. The devs themselves didn't think it was part of the effect. They added that rule as part of a *Nerf* to yogg after he turner out to be too powerful, but the initial decision shows they didn't consider it to be inherently part of the spell.
---
Don't disenchant, it's your Krul-lection
---
Exactly. OP's got a good point that it is weird how Overload for minions only happens when you "play" them, but Overload for spells happens when they're "cast" as well as played.
---
I believe in crafting cards because I want to have all cards
---
I wouldn't like to use nothing from Bliz except some very core mechanics, which hopelly is not protected by copyright.
---
I think the Warlock quest is worse in concept too.
---
Right, but my point is that the deck functions. The quest itself isn't inherently terrible, it just doesn't have the support it needs in standard right now and that could easily change with the coming expansions
---
!remenberme 4 months
---
Secret: counterspell
---
I hope you weren't counting on Bloodlust for your entire strategy.
---
Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/UqxZfzfsJX8) of three games played with the Warrior quest (it is from a French streamer named Torlk).
---
The deck was submitted by a Twitch viewer, it's not perfect (Torlk keeps ranting about Elysiana) but it's still interesting to watch even if you don't understand French ;)
---
When you're not clever enough to think of your own joke, just use one of our patent-pending CopyPastas! You'll feel like part of the in-crowd when you share a tired, re-used in-joke!
---
Paladin quest has better value but requires minions to stick on board more and is much more proactive than reactive. Warrior quest can remove your minions easily, and consistently, if they want. Pally is playing minions and hoping they stick. They want different things.

Content creator: *spends only 98% of the time making content*

&gt; Spells are always played

That's not true. Yogg doesn't play spells, he "casts" them.

When announced, i thought this would be good.

Im such a fool.

---
Well good luck man, the project sounds really cool
---
Yes very
---
F
---
It has about 17-18 months to get to top 2, and the quest is rather solid. I wouldn't take the opposite bet to be honest, there's a decent chance it gets to tier 2 at some point.
---
Been like that for years. No money to be made fixing that so fuck us.
---
Yeah I got the sense from browsing this subreddit that Druid quest decks are at least decent in the meta
---
If shes new enough that this is her first legendary, hogger is not a bad roll.
---
I understand, but when playing with the Quest myself, the "pressure" never amounted to much, because you play mediocre weapons, that you have to Swing with, to get mediocre dudes.
---
Hunter Hero Power does actual damage, meaning you have real inevitabilty.
---
A Tempo or aggro deck also really, really wants to play a 1-drop.
---
Your Opponent left.
---
Darksun#1904 - NA - trade 80g quest. you go first. quick trades. you can win both games for quests

OH NO NO NO

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Highlander mage or Hunter?
---
On spells, Overload is an effect. On minions, it’s a cost of playing. Summoning does not equal playing. I do think that it would be clearer if minions said “Battlecry: Overload” because that’s basically how it feels to the player, but game logic is looking at it a different way behind the scenes for whatever reason.
---
Nah. They're saying how they **want** it to work.

Stsrted playing a highlander rogue with Toggwaggle's scheme for Tess just to mess with Warriors. It's honestly pretty fun with a few extra value techs.
---
I see it all the time in casual, it usually beats me because I'm just trying to complete quests
---
You must be new to the internet
---
You can buy the adventure in the blizzard shop on their website
---
All it needs is some form of weapon tutor (Forge of Souls on a stick maybe?) or another high durability weapon. Speaking of which, I wonder if there’s a potential variant with Overlord’s Whip?
---
Can you imagine comparig this to something like TI9? Nice Hearthstone """""""""""""esports""""""""""""""
---
Hunter's Quest isnt actually thats bad, its certainly better than Rogues quest (whose best deck is essentially tempo rogue with quest, which really wins despite having the quest, as normal tempo rogue is just better). So Id probably leave it out of the buffs. And honestly rogues quest should get something, though probably a change rather than a buff. Its such a self-contradictory quest.
---
Haha looks like a 45 minute game you lost to 1 bad discover rng.  
---
Maybe play a new deck if you don't like it.
---
That look like Gus from Rooster Teeth.
---
Genn is a start of game trigger. It looks at your deck before you even draw your opening hand.
---
I'd rather play against Secret Mage than F*ck you Priest
---
Anybody can go from rank 20-10 with anything. That means precisely fuck all. Regardless, it's pretty boring regardless of the power level so I have no interest in playing it.
---
“START OF GAME” looks at the whole deck including your hand.
---
Ruin. Despair. Destruction.
---
I care
---
It seems to suck regardless. I want to be closing the game out by the time I get the hero power value I need if I'm aggro.
---
In wild I'd rather just run Finley, Steady Shot or life tap are probably just upgrades over this anyways.
---
Rip war boi
---
Ti9 was a blessing
---
I'm way more concerned about the massive amount of gold you have. My utter lack of self control wants to use it all and buy 28 packs rn

It already exist as Brawl.

Don't think there is at all, afaik it's from experimenting or passed from devs directly
