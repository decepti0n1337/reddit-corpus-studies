You do know that floop changes Artwork and everything in your hand, don't you?
---
You need to play a minion while he is in your hand for him to change...
---
Currently Baku and Genn are uneven in the power level so the HS devs team may as well starting at balancing the mana cost. Making they are all at 6 mana seem fair to me
---
Sadly, rank 25 is full of meta netdecks. So at least the change won't make it worse.
---
“Man this turn 3 giant is awesome” candle shot, hunters mark. They always have it.
---
I played Blood Of on turn 9. On turn 10, I played Floop. Didn’t turn into Blood Of.  Just stayed a 3/4 Floop. 
---
There are still floors, and you still only get knocked back 4 ranks each season
---
Oh really? I always thought that if you play all 4 horseman from hand, if your hero power isn’t disabled, the OTK would work
---
Did you draw it just then?
---
You win the internet for today XD
---
&gt; Each deck should have its own rank.
---
They're trying to *decrease* tedium, not multiply it. 
---
More like army of the braindead
---
About fucking time.
---
get gud
---
Excuse me what, spell Hunter always plays eaglehorn
---
if they made rank 5-legend easy then everyone would be legend.
---
Playing 5 secrets alone is technically worth 10 mana already. Replaying every secret, as well as Animal Companion, Unleash the Hounds and Deadly Shot certainly seems like a powerful turn 10 play, and it's not like those cards are exceedingly niche.
---
Also, I'd say that while Hunter will likely get fewer spells, I'd be amazed if they don't get at least one or two decent cards that synergize with Zul'jin.
---
He'll be much, much weaker, for sure, but he'll be far from "horrible." 
---
okay i won't rage with stats, but you're basically saying something that is factually wrong and then asking people to ignore it!
---
Also, floop is literally a copy of the last card when he works (except cost and stats)
---
gnomed
---
No, Zerus shifted into Floop on turn 10. Does that matter? I feel like it shouldn’t since every other battlecry works normally.
---
It's not a battlecry.
---
So Rogue would just get nothing out of playing Baku?
---
I think the main issue with Baku/Genn is their consistency. It turns every game against Odd Paladin into something reminiscent of PVE content as you try desperately to stave off a never-ending flood of 1/1s. Odd Warrior becomes a race to beat their face through infinite armor and a near instaloss for any burn deck, while 2 drops will forever be compared to their ability to withstand a 2/2 dagger (aka 3/2s are pretty ass.
---
HOF isnt a solution because they are as prevalent in Wild, where Even Shaman, Even Rogue, Odd Paladin, Even Warlock, and Odd Warrior all see at least some play. At ranks 4-legend, it becomes absurd, with Even Shaman and Odd Rogue alone making up over a quarter of the meta in [the last data report](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wild-vs-data-reaper-report-15/).
---
That's a rate of 1 in 1024. So every 1024 or so times someone plays 2 cinderstorms with only 1 enemy minion on the board, this will happen. We just don't hear about the other 1023 times it didn't happen. Probably happens every couple of days, if not every day!
---
i think the problem lies less in the individual game RNG and more in the ladder/game design:
---
* archtype polarity is insane in this TCG/CCG where there is no 'side deck' to build your deck against it, so if you role into a otk deck as control, aggro as OTK, or control as aggro, your chance of winning goes to at best 30% no matter how much better you are than your opponent 
---
* the ladder is best of 1. even if there WAS a theoretical side deck, it doesn't matter because the ladder is best of 1, where it's completely random if you vs something you have a 80/20 matchup against or a 20/80 or MAYBE even a fair 50/50 where skill matters much more but is still coupled with draw rng (cant be avoided all card games have it, though some faster games mitigate this by having inexpensive card tutoring/ draw power. committing an entire turn to draw 2 cards is NOT inexpensive)
---
* aggro climbs much faster during literally every meta than any other type of deck. If i'm a middle-bad player (let's say 50% percentile) playing the flavor of the month aggro deck and I start ranked at the same time as the best hearthstone player ever playing a control/OTK deck, there is a percentage difference where I will get to legend first if we both play at the same time. to better describe this, if I win 55% of games, and each of my games as aggro are 10 mins or less, I can rush through the losses to get to more wins and I will climb. compare this to the pro who has a 70% winrate (which is an incredibly amazing winrate, look at some stats nobody has consistent winrates like this due to the previously mentioned polarized ladder system), but each game takes 30+ minutes, in the time it takes him/her to win 7 out of 10 games, I've played 30 games and won 16/17. As time goes on, the difference gets wider, and eventually my sheer number of games pushes me closer to a higher rank. obviously this is mitigated by other factors such as what decks I match against, how good the aggro deck I choose is, etc. given enough time and a positive winrate though, anyone can get to legend eventually 
---
Idk if you watch streamers, but some of the top players muzzy, dog, firebat usually all get to legend but if you watch their streams there are sometimes bouts where they just lose game after game. random players are beating the best players in the game where skill is supposed to be the most important factor? 
---
You think it's skewed because of the Reddit posts you see of crazy outcomes? Why would somebody make a post when something mundane happens? That's like watching the news about a murderer and concluding that everyone around you is a murderer
---
Yes, and yes.
---
This is a good move in favor of new players to the game, makes it a lot more achievable to reach 15 and 10 with incomplete decks and not all that much experience.
---
Good job blizzard
---
100% agree. They are ridiculously prevalent.
---
He does all his shennenigans in hand.

&gt;I was playing Hunter since last summer when I started, long before its prevalence.

*Bring out your dead*
---
&gt; "Revel in my suffering"? Cut back on the weed there, cletus, you've been hitting it a bit too hard. Rigging the game to make you lose 999 games out of 1000 is to try to get dumb people to spend money on card packs in the shop. It has nothing to do with "suffering."
---
The idea of some developer tampering with the RNG in Dungeon Run just to be a sadistic jerk makes about as much sense as any other reason, including the one you gave. Why would anyone spend money on their collection over a loss in Dungeon Run - a mode where you *can't use your collection*? If anything it would make more sense to rig that mode in the players' favor, to both get them back into more profitable game modes quickly and to convince them that the cards they used to win are powerful and worth crafting for ladder mode.
---
&gt;I just want the game to actually be winnable.
---
Which just gets back to the question: Why? If you truly think a game is deceptive, exploitative, unwinnable, and you want to kill the people behind it, why are you still playing it? If you think Blizzard is going to such extreme and unethical lengths to try and wring every last dollar out of their players, it's not as though winning Dungeon Run as a paladin is going to change that. This time next year it'll still be the same game by the same company with the same business model, with new single player content developed for the same reasons as Dungeon Run. There are lots of other fun games out there, ones that don't ask you to continually invest tons of time or money to have a good time. There's no shame in saying "I'm not having fun" or "I'm disgusted with the developers" and turning away from Hearthstone.
---
I'd still play Hunter over Titan. Just on hiatus.
---
Change Tank Up's armor from giving 4 to giving 3.
---
The Silver Hand summons one 2/2 minion (which benefits from the same tribal synergies as other Silver Hand Recruits) instead of two 1/1 minions.
---
Make him an 11 cost card?
---
Easy solution: Keep it until you own every other standard legendary. Not only do you get great meme value out of it, you also prevent yourself from unpacking another one and still end up with all the dust from it eventually.
---
How could Baku work at 6 mana? It'd be in the deck that has to have only Odd cards. It being there makes it so that its own condition is unfulfilled.
---
Why do you say it's aimed at children? Because it's silly? Grownups don't mind silly, only edgy teens do.
---
I think we're on to something here
---
I was thinking qbout recording it but it was too late... i already did the thingy.
---
Hate this deck
---
I really loved playing the wild reno shudderyogg deck
---
if you have fun playing the game, who cares what your rank is. do you have more fun if you are a higher rank? the answer is no.
---
i play hunter the most. the reason for this, is it wins with minions. winning with minions is fair, unless your turn 1 is unfair (mana wyrm, tidecaller, undertaker, that pirate guy etc.). this is how i feel when it comes to hearthstone, and as such i like to face against aggro even as control. because if their win condition is minions, then there's always cards you can add into your deck to target them.
---
though to be fair, what i just stated can be debated when it comes to cards like hunter spellstone, tarim, cold blood and soul fire. honestly i can't believe cold blood and soul fire are still floating around, when they're the same power level as power overwhelming and ice lance.
---
i used to be so mad at these stupid 1 mana deal 4 type cards, that even in vanilla i made a shitpost image like this https://imgur.com/30fElgz
---
The moment that low tier dust card came down as a hunking 0/0, I new the game was over.  The heart of the cards had not yet decided if it would be he or I that was crushed within the pressure of his vacuous space, but one of us would not be finishing the tavern brawl.  My trepidation at the thought of staring a 20/20 in the face 4-20 turns later caused me to misplay, picking dropping 2-3 good 6+ drop legendaries, over the next 4 turns rather than 4 big minions.  When he dropped a menacing 5/4, I feared it might be the end.  When he dropped a 2 drop and hero powered I feared for my very existence.  I was on my last leg, merely up 26 hp to something much more near to 0, but so much more menacing...probably 7 hp....you know what they say 7 did to 9 right?  Cannibalism. 
---
With my opponent holding onto a massive mental lead over me, I closed my eyes as he spent mana on one last card.  I expected a 3 drop.  Some horrible amalgamation or some such, or maybe a spell to my face to bring me that much closer to the death I expected around every corner.  As I opened my eyes I saw something much worse...a river croc.  Not just any river croc though, a DOOMferatu.  No doubt it would destroy a card I really wanted.  No doubt it would lead to my utter defeat.  Thinking what it might take from me, i yelled allowed "EVERYTHING !,"  but as i looked it in the eyes i knew it would not be happy with merely that.  No doubt...but then it happened.  A light shined on me so brightly, that had I not turned away I just may have gone blind.  Be it the work of angels or brode, I do not know, but I do know that whatever form of RNGESUS''s mercy that graced me in that moment also torn my opponent''s dreams asunder as the river croc obliterated a candle from my deck.  I was saved, regardless of the fact that logically a candle being drawn or destroyed both lead to the light going out and therefore should be the same thing as far as the card summoning..logically.  This is not a game of logic though.  This is a game of valor...of right and wrong
---
..of a higher form of karma.  That my opponent was smited for his hubris of summoning the darkness was karma, for he or for I, I do not know...but karma nonetheless.  As the joy of my opponent's utter abasement washed over me like a wave of fragrant caramel, I imagined they conceded in shame, but I do not know.  The euthoria I felt in that moment, the relief, all but made it impossible to see clearly.  Between the sounds of rushing caramel I heard the explosion of his character in the background, and I knew victory was mine.  I took my 3.33 gold and raised a fist in triumph, remembering this was actally my second tavern brawl today and I alreay earned my pack.  There would be no sadness on this day though, only triimph...and JUSTICE.

Be careful with multiple instances of val'anyr though. The code doesn't like it when you make too many val'anyr.
---
Like it crashes the game or something? 
---
Opponent's name is "Cubeonfire", after getting burned by both Cinderstorms he is literally on fire now 🤔
---
Unbelievable? It’s perfectly believable, man. They aren’t going to make big changes and staff team members on matchmaking projects that only impact 0.5% of the player base. 
---
Should they make legend ladder better? Yea, probably, but you shouldn’t be surprised that they aren’t. 
---
You face Jaraxus! 
---
does
---
I think the other ones used to count as spells too. If i remember correctly, you could buff Kalimos' damage with spell damage cards, but it was fixed. 
---
That’s quite interesting actually
---
nice for new and casual players i guess
---
I hope those streamers who publicly defected from Hearthstone were being well paid by Valve because they sure as shit ain't making money by going from thousands of viewers a stream to literally dozens.
---
Have you considered swapping him out for literally any other card?
---
I had an instance where it started skipping turns and making me draw 3 cards at a time until I drew myself into fatigue and died. I was testing cube paladin shenanigans with a buddy and started using valanyr with spirit master umbra and things just got weird.

---
This month i had journey 17 rank wild to 3  rank.  At 17 constructed few Tier 1 decks. Some bad beats experienced with "casuals".  So the whole climb process. The problem is the current ranking system have people stuck at some distances. like 10-15  or 5-10, people have wow decks in that range. The new ranking system put the bottleneck to different ranks from 10-15  these people theoretically will reach to 5-10, and 5-10 people will be shifted to range 1-5. It will become more challenge for climbing. IMHO. Then the main impact will be most likely for Standard since in wild meta is quite stable ... 
---
Malcontent machinations monetarily executed minutely
---
But like almost all free games, hearthstone operates on the “retain whales” model. The large majority of the player base doesn’t support the game. It’s the .1 (or even .01%) that buy hundreds of packs for each expansion that keep it alive.
---
I’d have been so tilted after that, even if i won
---
Baku+Genn meta incoming.  Your deck can only contain odd or even cards, and your hero power is upgraded and costs 1.  Sounds balanced!
---
Ah. So basically the one you need never gets generated. And the one you definitely don't want gets generated every time.
---
I LITERALLY JUST CLIMBED TO RANK FIVE YESTERDAY

If you work a normal nine to five job, you have upwards of sixteen hours a day that you aren't working, and assuming you work hourly, you're probably not working at all hours you're not sleeping. 
---
Labor may get paid for selling their time to an employer, but no matter how much Magic the Gathering you play, you're never going to have the natural act of playing the physical game be able to pay for it at the same time unless you are a phenomenal player. At the very least, it will never pay for itself as efficiently as Heathstone can allow you if you just play regularly on your off time.
---
You may never get a return out of Hearthstone, but you more than likely spend quite a bit of money on things that will also never appreciate in value.
---
Candleshot they are immune so you can't steal any life and their Zilliax had divine shield so you also don't steal any life as no damage was done.
---
Please, this argument is so tired, and doesn't hold up.
---
I have probably 5k MTG cards from several years of casual playing. You know what 95% of them are worth? Nothing. I've opened one card that is, by itself, worth 50$, and I could probably sell some rares and mythic rares for another 50$ collectively. I could maybe bulk sell the rest for maybe like 20$ more. So best case scenario, I could recoup maybe 1/5 of the money I put in. I can't take my money out of hearthstone, but I also STILL havent put that much money in to it
---
The REAL advantage that physical TCG's have is that if the company shuts down, you can keep playing. 
---
HS requires blizzard to keep servers up.
---
That could be a wild game changer just before rotation
---
Regarding step 5 - there are a lot of ways to get packs people don't know about. Many people still don't know that new players get lots of free packs for climbing up from rank 50 since a recent update. You also get packs for referring friends, you can just refer yourself, storm through tutorial and win some games vs AI to lvl up (that's what i did). You can also quite easily get free classic packs for just joining the game on various mobile devices. You can either borrow them from someone in real life or use an emulator/edit the game files to trick the game (this might have been fixed, i used this method). I also remember getting multiple  free packs from google play promos.
---
This last one is a more commonly known one, but they also have a champion voting for major tournaments every few months. You vote on their website and like a month later you are rewarded with free packs. You get more packs the further your champion gets in the tournament. 
---
It'd be easier and faster to just list the things one IS allowed to say.
---
Do you people keep the walls padded and hand out sippy cups too?
---
I’d like to see what they would put. I feel like the order might be changed, since it looks like from 25-1 is worst to best cards. And idk if there’s 25 cards worse than angry chicken
---
Nah, they probably still have some armor.
---
&gt;The popularity and power level of Hunter is pretty high right now, so that’s something that we’re keeping a pretty close eye on. It’s been stabilising a little bit, but we’re still looking at it pretty closely.
---
Lads, when you play queue as Hunter. If we can make the ladder 100% Hunter mirrors and we'll get more nerfs. 
---
Odd warrior isn't exactly the most interactive deck either
---
Having the effect disabled while it's in your hand.
---
I have personally been annoyed by both Baku &amp; Genn months ago after seeing them *that* much which made me wonder of how Blizzard could nerf them, I thought that changing the stats would be badly received as their effects is the main players' concerns so, therefore, why not change said effects?   
---
Two ideas that came to mind were:  
---
1) Keep their flavor and the **Start of Game** keyword but the hero powers would be upgraded depending of the turn, for example Baku would give an upgraded hero power on *odd* turns and Genn on *even* turns.  
---
2) Delay or affect how long their effects are but it might contradict with their keywords. A few examples would be:   
---
a) if your deck has only x cards, your hero power is upgraded on turn 5.  
---
b) your hero power is upgraded when you have enough mana to play this card.  
---
c) your hero power is upgraded while this card is in your deck (ouch, RNG).  
---
d) your hero power is upgraded while you have less mana than needed to play this card etc.  
---
Those aren't perfect examples but I would trust the designers to find the right balance through playtesting, my opinion is likely flawed though as I thought of those ideas back when Baku Paladin wasn't yet nerfed and Genn Warlock more common, I mostly tried to find ways to slow those decks' early game while letting Baku Warrior accumulate its armor late game, the scenario from 'a' being pretty much that.  
---
Anyway, I hope those suggestions fill your curiosity, personally I think both of them could be nerfed, I am just unsure if they deserve that yet, hopefully no and the rotation make them less prevalent. 
---
Lorewalker?? MILLHOES?? THE BAD LEGENDARY GANG??! This post is so funny. I'm glad I saw this post before it gets big. I'm sure the /r/hearthstone circlejerk would love this
---
Wow, might get back into ranked again. The 5 star grind at early levels was pretty much what killed it for me.
---
Odd Warrior has always been a format counter rather than a format definer, and the format has shifted away from what Odd Warrior counters the best.
---
you think odd warrior is interactive? lol
---
wow really! I never knew that started playing the game towards the end of old gods. Is it worth getting now if you play wild? Are any of the other cards good besides loatheb? I don't have any of the legendaries listed or rares from the adventure. I think I only have mad scientist and a ghoul. 
---
50-25 are only available on New accounts and have additional card pack rewards to help new players catch up a little. Once you hit 25 it becomes the minimum.
---
X -&gt; 10 will be 40% faster, 10-&gt;5 will be the same

You know what experimenting with new decks mean, right? The word new is important :) those are NOT new decks.
---
he was,not anymore tho
---
Thank you so much!! I love planning for the worst case scenario, that's why I asked these questions! Thank you so much for answering :)
---
alot of peopke though it was bad because the state hunter at before and after KnC releases
---
Because Rexxar is no HC control card?
---
Remove Baku, Genn and all their cards from the game.
---
You know shit is broken when jade druid is a healthier deck than them.
---
Just cuss out the game, to yourself that's what I do. No use in cussing the opponent to their face
---
My win rate from 5 to Legend is around 56%. Does the 110-85 mean the average games for the win rate? Because it doesn't feel like that many. While in Legend I do ok I guess. I've never really gone for high Legend. The highest I've finished is top 50. Usually I hover around the 500s. 
---
The ranked floors change has reduced some time off the ladder grind but for good players i didnt help anyone, 5 - L was always the most time consuming.   For good players that do not do this professionally and have other obligations its just a 10 - 20 day grind to even get into the MMR system where the game actually gets imteresting then you only have a few days to try and get something done.  This game is fucking all the talented players that are on the edge of trying to turn pro.  The monthly reset is getting fucking old fast for someone like me who plays hundreds of games each month i would like to stop spending half if not more just trying to get back to the same starting place every god damn month.
---
Miracle is the name given to a deck which tries to draw a lot of cards on the same turn coming from the old school deck called Miracle-gro. 
---
There are cards that counter combodecks that you can put in your deck, and if you lose to every combo deck, maybe you should learn their win condition and then play around it as much as possible.

The adventure has a bunch of powerful
---
And useful cards for Wild. Most of the other legendaries aren’t as good as Loatheb, but barring one exception they’re all pretty fun to use regardless. Definitely a good investment as a Wild player.
---
It’s also a few hours of really fun single player content, so there’s that as well. 
---
Exactly, so you need 200 games to get to legend. Maybe it doesn’t feel like a grind to you, but for a lot of people 200 games is a crazy amount of play time for 1 month! That’s why people are saying they don’t like the grind to legend. I usually get 60% winrate between rank 5 and legend, but quite often do not make it there because of time constraints. (I don’t really mind though)
---
It’s a control deck. That’s basically about as interactive as you can get. 
---
Sir, I don't think *you* understand.
---
You *must* attack that minion with taunt!
---
Yeah, probably not worth keeping, with the rotation and such.
---
That’s an incredibly horrible attitude to have about Wild. It has just as much right, and potential, to be a fun, balanced format. Balanced at a much higher power level of course, though. 
---
this brings a tear to me eye
---
Update: Took Scepter of Summoning and Crystal Gem. Got more than a few Legendary buckets.
---
Only to get utterly wiped at *Karl and George.* Why?  
---
All of my good cards were stacked at the end of my deck. After 10 turns, I had nothing on my field and nothing in my hand to play. All of the cards which could have saved me never got drawn. This, again is what I'm talking about. I must have been doing "too well" for the game's algorithm to accept, so it rigged a match I was guaranteed to lose.
---
One more thing, If you get at least once to level 15 you cannot fall lower than 20 at any given time.
---
I’ve been teaching a casual friend how to play lately, and they definitely struggle to evaluate cards. I could easily see them wasting dust on crappy rares and epics  that sound/look good but aren’t worth it. So, sadly, they just wait for me to be able to help them choose what to craft. It’s too punishing otherwise 
---
FINALLY!
---
Now i can reach rank 15 like i used to without playing 100 games a month &lt;3
---
There is literally no way to test a particular card in arena or tavern brawl. You'd have to count on luck to randomly get it there.
---
They changed it about 9.5 months ago, in Patch 11.0
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/21694420/
---
wow, miss that, thanks.
---
Update two: Forced to concede on the *first match* to *bink*. Again, all of his cards up front and on the field by turn 2; me, nothing but one stupid little silver hand recruit, and then he starts manufacturing coins out the ass. Meanwhile, I had nothing and no mana.
---
Also if it worked that way, the damage options aren't buffed.
---
You're saying that you put in \~200 games in a week to hit legend?  4-5 hours per day for 7 days in a row "doesn't feel like a grind" to you?
---
&gt; Yeah I like this game too, but I couldn't imagine playing this game, or any game for that matter for hours on end. 
---
This is you on /r/hearthstone a few months ago.  Me thinks you're full of shit.
---
Magnetic works as a buff. It looks like stacking because, well, it looks nice and presentation is always a big part of hearthstone. But it's basically that if you play a magbatic minion to the right it's a minion, if you play it to the left it works like any other buff and can thus be silenced. 
---
He gets played in a tier 2 deck, so... not dust?
---
Sounds like a good counter to 3 mana 4/4 battlecry: if you can't immediately kill this, win the game.
---
KALADIN is the dude that complain about everything in Hearthpwn, i think he posted a screenshot complaining about how lucky you are ahah
---
Yeah I get that, but I don't think that's right.
---
If you imagine it IRL, you're talking about two robots stuck together via a physcial property. It's not a spell or magical buff. So it doesn't make sense that Silence just makes the second one disappear altogether. 
---
Best part is it's effect let's you have two copies.
---
Mage hero power doesn't have charge?
---
Idk if you want to make sure you don’t look serious online then you’ve got to go pretty over the top to show it. To me the ... sealed the serious deal 
---
you can do F2P! I did it  from rank 50 and right now my account is sitting at rank 14. I could probably try to push it higher. Took me about 2 months of casual play and just saving up gold. If you're in NA, lmk we can match up and play sometime. 
---
Pick double-health, Uther DK, and perma-stealth for the minions.
---
Turn13win.
---
Timeouts are available.
---
Also, from the treasures, I've got silencing rod, which turned quite good vs double-deathrattle guy.
---
I think youre right about me getting the hero card for free. I don't see why else I would ever have the shaman "transform your minions..." hero card, I don't even like shaman lol. Anyway, definitely gonna go for the first legendary in frozen throne now. Thanks for the help guys
---
how did that happen?
---
How do you start from rank 50?
---
Would be cool if stealth+rush let you go around enemy taunt minions. 
---
😩😩
---
This is a legit serious matter. 
---
I can't understand this??
---
Odd warrior with screenshots of them having 30+ armor while you're in fatigue.
---
Pally
---
League of Explorers probably has the most straight up value, Reno, the double battlecry guy, but Naxx has Loatheb, Kel’Thuzad, and Sludge Belcher, which are pretty key in some decks. You can dust the really bad cards if you want. You have to get them through the Blizzard website tho, not in-game.
---
While we're at it, make ragnaros immune to all fire-themed removal effects.
---
Haha same happend to me, yesterday i opened up the pack you get from a tavern brawl win and got a fucking golden Millhouse. It was my first ever golden legendary but i instantly disenchanted it.
---
None of them attacked yet so probably could wait longer.
---
But I hear it's advisable to fight fire with fire. 
---
that is someone who has the time to do 600000 games for reaching legend and plays already yearly everyday. im not gonna play for that 51% winrate every 100 games. i just want a deck that isnt obviously weaker but equal to the rest and then rush to 5-10.
---
im not a new player but i dont have any dust for a proper deck and everyone at rank 20 already has the best decks, takes way too long to get past that with a 540 dust deck and this new stupid 5 star rating system
---
No, the bloods shuffle after each draw ends, so it never goes infinite. I think he was still dead from the end turn draw without the spell damage though.
---
Actually, there's two now.
---
If that’s the case, the healing should not have been buffed.
---
Good change overall.
---
LIKE SWATTING TROUT
---
If the cheap sprint doesn't also tutor, how can it be considered a good card? 0 stars.
---
This is potentially the highest value pack ever opened surely. 
---
Although I'm sure someone, somewhere has opened 3 gold legendaries at some point. 
---
Anyway gz! (You bastard)
---
Yes I get that but aren't 2 corrupted bloods enough to go infinite?
---
Or do they wait with the shuffling until ALL draws are completed?
---
Shaman and possibly Tempo/Burn Mage.
---
Games aren't about morals, but you can see this guy has pretty low morals himself.

I never said "realism is better then cartoon style". All i said is a thread about "appreciating the art of game" doent make any sense if the art of the game is much worse then the art of the other tradable cardgames. how is that not "relevant" in the given context and what the hell is this endless discussion about?!
---
You get the refund dust 7 days later
---
Azalina probably?
---
They are the same thing. Either blame both for the bad or credit both with the good. You don't get to pretend Blizzard is the good cop while Activision is the bad cop, they are inseparable.
---
It exist since Mind Games was printed, it's just that not many people play it and it's not that common to play it without minions on your opponent's deck.
---
Never 
---
Only 1 dragon roar.. 3-3 
---
Probably prince Liam 
---
I suppose prince liam into azalina?
---
Wild exists also. I made the switch recently &amp; never looked back. Standard is beyond stale right now. 
---
I actually won though as this is the holy wrath variant 
---
There are some players having a lot of success in high legend with Tempo Rogue and Egg Paladin, although it's hard to tell how strong they actually are with the small sample size.
---
When does this actually happen though? I play to rank 5 in wild every month, and I can't even recall when I've been slammed from stealth by a single big guy. 
---
Got this plus Luna's Pocket Galaxy shortly after. My opponent was a good sport and played until the end. Thank you, wherever you are.

80g quest trade for NA servers
---
May I ask what interview you are referring to? 
---
For the Lich King adventure, there are a lot of deck lists available to make the fight easier (e.g. [Icy Veins guide](https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/guide-to-defeating-the-lich-king-with-all-classes)).
---
I mean, at least you only lose 1 card.
---
How is everyone in the comments missing that he didn't have any mana left once he used the first naturalize, I'm pretty sure it'd still be lethal after the start of turn draw.
---
They can’t. Spell hunter has no chance against Controllock without Rexxar or an extremely lucky Zuljin. Most Midrange hunters do well against Control but with Defile, Hellfire, Godfrey and Spellstone, as well as Skull, it’s not the easiest matchup.
---
Oof.  
---
Hot take: Quest Mage actually destroys Secret Hunter because they play so passively.  
---
 Satanslilboy#1764 NA. Looking to trade 80g. You go first and I’ll show

Haha I never knew about that Freeze Evolve Shaman.  Hilarious text.
---
&gt;HELLO, THE LICH KING HERE TO PRESENT MY CREATION – THE BEST DECK IN ALL OF HEARTHSTONE.
---
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAST META SNAPSHOTS, YOU WILL NOTICE THAT MAGE IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL. I HAVE DECIDED TO … "BORROW" SOME OF JAINA'S CARDS IN ORDER TO MAKE MY CREATION UNSTOPPABLE. I MEAN THAT LITERALLY, AS I HAVE IMPLEMENTED MAGE'S FREEZE MECHANIC INTO MY DECK, PREVENTING THE ENEMY MINIONS FROM STOPPING MINE.
---
JAINA'S FROST NOVA, FROSTBOLT, AND ICE LANCE ALL SYNERGIZE WELL WITH SHAMAN'S NEWEST ADDITIONS FROM KNIGHTS OF THE FROZEN THRONE – ICE BREAKER, VOODOO HEXXER, CRYOSTASIS, AND MOORABI. IF YOU ARE QUEUEING FOR A STANDARD GAME AND ARE STOPPED FROM BRINGING IN ICE LANCE, REMIND THE GAME CLIENT THAT THIS IS ARTHAS' DECK, AND NO ERROR MESSAGE CAN STOP THE LICH KING.
---
AFTER INCAPACITATING YOUR OPPONENT'S MINIONS, YOUR WIN CONDITION IS TO EVOLVE YOUR OWN MINIONS INTO A DEVASTATING ARMY. DO THIS WITH THE CLASSIC DOPPELGANGSTER AND EVOLVE COMBO, THEN PROCEED TO EVOLVE YOUR ARMY EVEN FURTHER WITH THRALL, DEATHSEER AND TRANSMUTE SPIRIT. MASTER OF EVOLUTION HAS SOME NICE EYES, SO HE CAN COME ALONG TOO.
---
THROW IN A FEW COUNTERSPELLS TOO FOR GOOD MEASURE.
---
I had almost the same rank 5 play. It is prince Liam shenenigans. Then he had 2 or 3 Syndragosas and then took my entire hand with Azalina. It was good for me that he was dead on board, cuz he already took my entire deck with Benedictus and was about to DMH his hand. I was playing infinite CW though, not a recruit one.
---
Princess Huhuran is a bug.

I insist that you go first, but I'll show you my quest beforehand and challenge you right after your challenge. Successfully traded a few times here now, see history by clicking my name.
---
If I do accept your add then I do still have the quest.
---
Else somebody else was faster than you and I am already trading.
---
But its the Howlfiend's attack. He just attacks into the Spiderbomb and the Deathrattle kills the Howlfiend before the Rogue can make him double discard.
---
If I had to guess at the populations, I'd say NA and EU are fairly even, and Asia lags behind. In particular, I always wait longer for matches (especially if in casual and wild mode) in Asia than in the other regions. However, the time you're playing also makes a difference, since there's a time difference and there will be fewer people playing in a region's late night/early morning timeframe.
---
Wrong actually. Both mind games and sense demons used to give nothing if they whiffed, but it was changed pretty early on.
---
[Easiest 1600 dust ever](https://imgur.com/a/QeCuoYW)
---
Ye right, because warlocks always have skull into voidlord and hellfire... dude this is really triggering right now.
---
Im confused,  I need 5 starts to level up right now at level 20. Just got back in and thought this was normal, but now I'm thinking it is wrong. 
---
I play Big Priest, and this isn't my experience at all. I don't remember all the names that MtG assigned to the types of players, but I'm somewhere between the type that likes to play big, scary things, and the type that likes combos. Big Priest satisfies both of those requirements. I get to play big, beefy cards, AND I get to use combos to bring them back again and again. It's very satisfying for me.
---
If Barnes went away, I'd still play Big Priest, and I'd still have fun. Its unfairness has nothing to do with why the deck is enjoyable for me. 
---
These changes won’t be in effect until the start of the February season.
---
You missed lethal
---
I put him in odd zoo as a win condition and a heal if im about to die
---
that's value
---
I lost three in a row and was on the verge of just shutting down for the night, then in the fourth game I coined out Liam on 4 and it turned into one of the best brawls I’ve ever played. Ended up winning with an 8/11 Gral.
---
Is this really such a big deal that so many moron have to post pictures of this on reddit? I remember when I played this brawl (1 match) I considered if this card would even be worth it. Are random legendaries objectively better than a random minion that changes every turn to give you more options?
---
Summoning four 3/3 beasts for 5 mana is about as fair fair as filling the board with 1/5 taunt beetles or a 0 mana 5/5 Corridor Creeper or reviving 10 Obsidian Statues/Lich Kings
---
I mean, two years or so ago, warlock was the meme class until cubelock became a thing.  It happens.  Warrior or shaman will be super pushed next expansion.
---
I'm pretty sure you have to reach rank 15 before being unable to drop below 20.
---
I replayed that more than I should..... AMAZING!!
---
Wasn't renolock pretty good then?
---
"Unexpected Results"
---
What does “improved by spell damage” mean and how do you trigger that?  
---
\&gt;it's not OP because if you don't play it you don't win
---
Ok, wait, since when do the newbie ranks exist? It should be since after then. I was assuming it was with RR.
---
Hunter bad aggro bad control good me redditor me smart
---
OK, got it: If you go first, use the coin.
---
more spell damage = higher mana cost minions 
---
Admitting to repost lul
---
But nearly all the 1 cost cards are legendary anyway why would you need to change them?!
---
i am.. but hey happy cake day :&gt; 
---
Im inclined to agree-ish. But spell hunters now get to roll 8 times for Huffer. It is possible (and I have seen it) for Zuljin to roll 24 charging damage. Not to mention, Rexxar and Rhok'delar can both high roll.
---
When there is so much rng with high roll potential, it absolutely makes sense for people to get tilted when losing to this deck.
---
I personally think "midrange" hunter is more unfair though. A deck that has 29 cards meant to face never trade has no business playing a single card that allows it to beat control decks in fatigue.
---
Priest cards? A man of your talent?
---
Do you just need spell damage minions on the board to trigger that effect?   
---
&gt; Hit face and play Gnash from hand. That'll bring his opponent to -1.
---
Not in that order it won't.
---
Yeah, rank 25 to rank 9 with odd paladin
---
Why'd you have to link Day9 :( First I lost him from SC2 and now he's basically left HS too. Too soon.
---
Another vote for "petty".  
---
Why are you even linking that sub? They are asking if it's in reference to the 50 cent song, Candy Shop, which it is...
---
Zoolock was pretty good at that time if my memory serves me. First time I ever hit 5 was with that deck. I remember it kinda came out of nowhere in between expacs and was pretty legit. 
---
It has more to do with how they'd rather not change their marquee cards from the Witchwood than them being incompetent. 
---
Baku the Mooneater and Genn Graymane were pretty much the selling point of the Witchwood, especially in hindsight. They were created as an experiment mostly to see if a weakened deck building restriction reward would still be good enough to see play if the reward for doing so is guaranteed rather than having to be drawn first as was the case for Reno Jackson and Kazakus.
---
Did the the pendulum swing too far in the other direction? 
---
Almost certainly.
---
Is the game poorer for the experiment?
---
Certainly not.
---
Should they be changed in someway before they rotate?
---
To some extent yes, but soul of the cards should remain in tact. They should retain the **Start of Game** effect and perhaps give their own selection of hero powers. Genn could perhaps give weaker versions of each basic hero power, but they remain on cost and Baku could give hero power upgrades somewhere between the power level of basic Hero powers and the current Upgraded powers for classes that need it.
---
That's really not what I'm saying. Making money is fine, but making money in the predatory ways that games companies do (microtransactions, walled-off content, lootboxes, etc.) is unethical and needs to stop.
---
The trick is to yell BONESTOORM after every draw
---
Idk when the set rotates, warriors already looking strong. Odd warrior doesn't really change too much and four armor a turn is already nuts in this meta, but the meta is about to get taken down a powerlevel notch. And then they have a great control hero card, while most classes lose their only hero cards (and then it will probably be the best)... Hagatha and Zul'jin don't really compare imo. The only thing going against odd Warrior is that Mecha'Thun and Soulflayer decks are pretty strong. If warrior is pushed again we may have a serious problem on our hands.
---
Yeah. It did need a nerf. It's power in the opening was second only to Prince Keleseth.
---
Or you know, they could’ve just started playing or come back from a break.
---
Yeah, Keleseth Zoo was decent, but Tempo/Keleseth Rogue was basically a better version of the same deck.
---
Immune doesn't protect minions or yourself from non-targeting destruction effects.
---

---
Lol I love how you begin by immediately justifying to yourself that any downvotes were for bad reasons and not simply because your opinion is shitty. ignorance is bliss I guess.
---
Isnt this how it was before the last change? 
---
It would be better to same the money for the pre-order bundle of April's new set.
---
We are not on Reddit to say what you wanna hear, your attitude just shows that you're just throwing your opinion and wants everybody to agree with it. You don't like how other players play? Quit the game. You don't like how you are answered don't ask. Simple as that. 
---
I thought it was showing a bug, watched without audio. Quite anticlimatic, audio recommended indeed.
---
Cause he was calling 50 cent the monkey?
---
No story ever starts legendary, but it can evolve into something greater, remember this in your life as well
---
Rexxar in the back. Hes so prevalent in the meta that hes just everywhere.
---
Yeah?
---
I'm not sure what to say here: the only issue with big priest is that people, especially aggro players, feel like they lose to Barnes on 4 that pulls the right card. Based on the ~20 odd games I've played with it the deck itself isn't that strong: You have a grand total of 3 proactive plays before turn 8: 2x Essence + Barnes. Not drawing any of these cards turns 6 cards of yours into dead draws meaning that aggro actually has a really good chance of beating you. Those priest decks you beat doing nothing until you kill them? There's usually a couple of Reno Priests drawing badly in there but it's mainly (I would say almost 60%) big priests doing nothing. 
---
So what's the real problem? A) A perceived lack of skill, B) The fact that 1 card literally swings the game around, &amp; I hear a C) It prevents control decks from existing sometimes.
---
Here are various things that I've lost to over the last few days while messing around with Even Hunter, Rush Warrior, and Even Rogue:
---
#Even Shaman having good cards such as 0 mana 5/5s, 4 mana 7/7s, devolve, etc
---
#Giant(s) + Thekal on 3/4, Anyfin on 10 &amp; 11, Tarim followed by a big Quartermaster turn
---
#Barnes into Y'sh followed by a spellstone, Turn 3 play entire hand into a spellstone on 5
---
#Rogues out-tempoing my deck or threatening lethal on 5
---
#Pirates threatening lethal on 5
---
#Deathwing, Dragonlord on 4, followed by Deathwing on 6 &amp; 7 
---
#Reno on curve, Voidcaller into Mal'ganis/Voidlord on 4
---
#A random druid who got off Mecha'tun on turn 8 (bio project)
---
#APM priests highrolling their combo on turn 8
---
Here's the thing: highrolls happen in wild. If they don't draw Barnes, a big priest hand could actually read "Do nothing" till turn 6 at the earliest. This isn't more or less skillful than drawing the other highroll combos I've listed and it's just the direction the game is headed. Individual cards being played on curve or drawn in conjunction with other cards leads to a ridiculous winrate. Like it or not, this is the game that hearthstone has become in some games.
---
Meanwhile control decks are pushed out because they can't compete lategame with Renolock/Renomage in terms of value, Odd Warrior in terms of life gain, Reno priest in terms of killing people from 30 while packing 6 different board clears and reasonable healing, other random combo decks. Midgame Even Shaman is a gatekeeper deck sometimes swarming the board with an 8/8, a 7/7, and a 5/5 in 1 turn. Earlygame most aggro decks are capable of killing you by turn 5/6 and you need to survive that somehow.  Big priests "keep you out" because they're popular, not because it's any stronger than the aforementioned stuff. Nerfing big priests will just mean losing to different things because your control deck isn't strong enough or you aren't skilled enough to pilot it.
---
How can a free to play game not have microtransactions? 
---
Should they just give you the packs for free?
---
I think the nutty stuff is the thing that comes after that. You being able to say like I summoned two lich kings for four mana on turn 5 how insane is that?
---
It’s the reason whenever I play wild I mainly play cubelock, because being able to play voidcaller on 4 that is able to pull a malganis then copying that malgannis a bunch and eventually pulling out a massive doomgaurd feels super fun even if it’s not really fun for your opponent, so I can see how playing big priest is really fun. 
---
God bless you
---
I remember winning against it as odd paladin, finishing the game 10 turns after FLJ was played and opponent healed to full health. 
---
&gt; You could have just said “How do you propose they nerf..” without everything else, and this could have been a genuine discussion instead of 90% of your typing being negative. Ironically, you are exactly what I was referring to when I made that.
---
You *literally* started your post with negativity. You also failed to make any sense. "The other half of the down voters are going to down vote me because Blizzard’s lack of balance competency has been obvious since the Warsong nerf." Seriously, what does that even mean? Reddit users are going to down vote because Blizzard is incompetent? Did you get lost in the middle of that sentence or something?
---
&gt;There is a certain % of people on the internet that just enjoy negativity and hostility, and have no interest in an actual discussion. That is exactly why I started my thread with that paragraph.
---
I *did* engage in actual discussion, to the point you devoted three entire paragraphs to my question. I wouldn't consider the first point of my comment needless negativity, but even if it was, that's the exact structure you used in your OP. For someone who claims to want discussion, you're not doing a very good job of trying to start one.
---
&gt;My concern is a healthy balance where the entire ladder isn’t Hunter and odd/even decks. Or where the entire ladder isn’t small time buccaneer and patches. Or where the entire ladder isn’t FoN Savage Rose Druid and Handlock. Or where the entire ladder isn’t 4 mana Leeroy Miracle rogue. Or where the entire ladder isn’t freeze mage and control warrior to counter freeze mage. Or where the entire ladder is Undertaker and Lepor Gnome hunter and warlock.
---
If that's how you classify every meta, with broad exaggerations, then I don't see how you'll ever enjoy a meta. Saying you want a meta where "the entire ladder" isn't Hunter and odd/even decks is a ridiculous statement in itself since Hunter currently has multiple archetypes with distinct playstyles and Odd and Even decks are mostly fundamentally different from one another.
---
As for your proposed nerf, I don't think that would be enough to change what you seem to hate about the cards. You *have* to address the hero powers themselves to do that, but that's an awfully limited space to work within, so much so that I don't think there *is* a solution that could bring about the change you want that doesn't also "nuke the cards out of existence."
---
If there's a new player, he should just read the explanation box for the effect, which says "Immune characters can't be damaged". 
---
Maybe I wasn't clear. I like that Hunter has a lot of options/viable decks. I do not like that you can build a low-cost deck which typically curves out well and aims to end the game quickly with powerful early game minions (Hyena, Razormaw, Springpaw) then suddenly transition into a control deck with a single card, their DK.

F2P?!?!? How the shit did you manage that bro! Nice!
---
There's no real replacement for Rexxar, no other card does what he does, but if you need to fill out the slot something like highmane or dire frenzy can give you a little bit of extra steam to close out games.
---
Leeroy may help. Hallazi not. I think the deck can manage perfectly without legendaries though, thats a good thing!
---
Uh, didn't thought I'd get actual stats on this. Thx man!
---
They start working on the next expansions months in advance. At this time, they have probably started making concepts for the 3rd expansion of the year (which will come out in ~11 months). 
---
They even said this in the article:
---
&gt;For example, this week and next week are some of the last weeks that we’re working on set balance for the first set of this year.
---
&gt;In terms of card design, a lot of that stuff we have locked in pretty early.
---
Remember this time they made nerfs pretty soon after expansion release, so this is not usual. Who knows how would it go if they nerfed druid a month later? It's not only about the date of the nerfs, you also need to take in considration the time before the meta settles again after nerfs. It would most likely be too late to make balance changes for druid in the next set. They basically said it's too late for card design changes already. 
---
Personally, i didn't know how much ahead they work exactly and if they would have enough time for this. I remember that in the past we often had a class be the worst one in the game for 2 expansions in a row (based on data) and then get super overpowered cards in the 3rd one. I think at the time of Karazhan priest was considered a dead class and got [[Purify]], so people got mad.

Yeah, one random guy that started playing CCGS with hearthstone probably knows more about card games, balance, and how to analize data about the metagame than the developers who played CCGs before, and have been working and living of game design for a longer time. Not really sayign they will always get it right, but when someone just states wrong information as an argument to back up their opinions, sorry but those opinions may be wrong. Blizzard may had to nerf baku and genn, but not because of anything you state here though.

The Barnes yshaarj spell hunter is the actual good spell hunter tho. That’s the tier 2 wild deck. Spell only is not even a competitive deck in wild

Is it me or does this question get asked really often? Where and when did people first start seeing full dust refund for standard cards rotating to wild? I don't get it. 
---
I upvoted just so I could downvote twice

I have not seen Galvadon once in wild, ever. To imply that Tinkmaster Overspark is currently anti-Galvadon tech is... baffling.

Yeah all random! That’s what makes it cool! The chances of getting Loti were SO low
---
&gt; Aviana has been the source of like every problematic Druid OTK deck for years. When she was nerfed, there were like 5 different viable Druid OTKs in wild that used her that I can think of. (Malygos, Tog, C’Thun, Star Aligner, Mechathun).
---
&gt; Cthun
---
First, the only problematic deck of all those was star aligner, while all the others were okey in the wild format. OTK decks are not automatically degenerate or problematic...
---
But the Cthun otk deck, and mechathun otk deck both "using" aviana and you calling them "problematic" its enough.
---
The conversation is over, you clearly are trolling.

I’m rather glad we can be civil as well, so much simpler and makes me want to keep talking. We are discussing a game that does make bad decisions so it’s easy to respect and understand your point of view even if it differs from mine. 
---
I didn’t play during the unnerfed warsong days. I tried out hearthstone on its initial release and came back during old gods. So beyond some basic objective thoughts, I shouldn’t speak further on that beyond my understanding that frothing with charge was very bad. 
---
As far as nerfing extremes I will admit there do seem to be cards that are quite broken that they choose to ignore. They ignored patches and raza until rotation. It remains to be seen if they will follow suit with things like ultimate infestation and baku. 
---
This debate even furthers the fact that there is often little rhyme or reason to the changes beyond the whim at the moment (like mana wyrm). 
---
I try not to take hearthstone too seriously anymore. I don’t purchase sets anymore, I just save up gold and dust over the year to get cards and play mostly wild and a little standard. 
---
Eh, not quite. It's Guerilla Unit, but good try.  
---
The math checks out
---
So it took four years to pay off the loan you took out to buy enough hearthstone packs to get to this spot? right? RIGHT?
---
I do like your shinies tho.

RenoLock still heavily depends on tempo swings or massive plays, not necessarily good old value. Both Bloodreaver Gul'dan and N'Zoth, which are the deck's main win conditions and they're both tempo swings. Early wins often come from Voidcaller into some big Demon. Reno Jackson himself is also not a value card per se. Once again, it's a big swing, especially against Aggro.
---
If anything, Reno Mage is more of a value deck, but it's pretty bad right now. Frankly, the other two Reno decks are also only "okay" in Wild right now and I wouldn't classify either of them as a value deck.
---
Also the big "value" for me was exactly because you already owned them and that they can't ever procc as a golden from packs makes it worth it. It's a craft you'll never disenchant and never feel bad about should you open one in a pack in the future.

Nobody “invented” meta. You obviously have no idea how it actually works. Meta is simply what is the current trend or popular gameplay style. Nobody forces a meta with any degree of success. 
---
Ahh never got Knuckles, too late to craft now I think as well. Thanks
---
Big Priest player here, Odd Warrior can't possibly beat Big Priest as long as you have a brain. Bad players are probably going to lose though, it seems most guys go T4 Barnes T5 Resurrect T6 something T7 Spellstone, no joke.
---
And a money transfer
---
I've considered it lol but looking for some shenanigan type decks like yogg hunter. Thanks 
---
You are guaranteed a legendary card in the first 10 packs of each different set that you open, so make sure that happens to you with each set. Then yes, classic is the largest pool and never expires. 
---
Fun and interactive btw
---
In April, over 400 cards are removed from standard and 135 new ones are introduced. Nothing is hard to imagine.
