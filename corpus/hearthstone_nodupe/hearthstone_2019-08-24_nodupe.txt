Havnt played magic but googled lions eye diamond. Why is it confusing? Discard lions eye, diacard your hand gain 3 mana of any color. Seema pretty simple to me.

"I'll eat my shoe/hat" is a colloquialism not meant to be taken literally.
---

---
Move along, nothing to see here.
---
Knowing my luck I'd get lorewalker cho every time
---
Except that the opponent knows you played it. They can see it. So they play a crappy 1/1 instead. It's a dead card because of how the game works.
---
Edit: oh, you mean if it retained stats. Well in that case, then there would be counters that caused it to do something to you, like deal damage to you whenever it got hit or whatever. Those already exist, of course, but aren't played because they're equally bad.
---
Exactly
---
Zeph on 3 has won me the game giving me a juicy crab 3/4 and killing one of their Murlocs. Still need to get lucky with secrets and hope they don‚Äôt draw prism
---
That is why it is the first to get off the banlist.
---
Is it worth buying the naxaramus adventures if I have to spend 1400 gold to get 3 legendaries (2 of them stalag and his twin never even see play)?  The cards rewarded seem a bit stingier than league of explorers
---
What? Your screenshot button broke as you went to do it?
---
[removed]
---
In theory it‚Äôs a tech against decks like Big Priest that only play big minions. Also Spell Hunter was a thing back then, and this card is VERY good against that.
---
The problem is it‚Äôs unplayable against literally anything else.
---
Game changer.
---
People here are so friendly.
---
Last two expansions have had much better legendaries to craft.. FeelsBadMan
---
But it had divine shield and rush.
---
I don't think He-man is a take on He-Man
---
Fair enough haha
---
dr boom nerf is useless and downright stupid, trouble was not the mana cost. anyone from blizz reads this: you are lazy and stupid.
---
HOW LONG WILL THIS GO ON
---
*facepalm* Stats aren't the whole story. They depend on how players play the decks. And HSReplay is a subset of the player base. And none of the stat trackers do error analysis.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pocket galaxy is ridiculous, you play it early, you win.  Those cards deserve a nerf whether or not the class was tier 1 or not (and it probably was).
---
Dr Boom I agree the card should've just been HoF'd and I don't play warrior but sucks wild players that do play warrior gotta get punished because the card is broken in standard.  And I would not be surprised if CW remains a top tier deck though this definitely does weaken it and its playrate will go down even if it stays good.
---
Conjurer's... card was also broken in standard and will still be frustrating to play against but seems like a somewhat reasonable nerf I guess.
---
I personally am not a fan of the standard or wild meta right now.  Too many expensive, greedy decks.  I am glad they did some nerfs just cuz I wanna see the meta change.
---
I just wish they would've addressed secret mage in wild.  BP isn't even that good of a deck in the current meta, I am glad barnes got what he had coming but wild needs more of a tune up and ofc they just ignore it.
---
What i predict is that control will still be a good deck just not as good and will be surpassed by bomb warrior as an answer to the reno decks that will start flooding once nerfs hit.
---
But hunter is a real thinker?  I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs be opposite.
---
Had a murloc deck do this to me too but I got Scargill and Underbelly.
---
1 mana murloc flood!
---
Just be super sure. Spending all your mana on 6 to kill a 2/3 instead of being able to dragonfire potion behind it is a free counterspell for the mage.
---
could waste Khadgar too since this is the only list he's run in
---
They make the decks before the expansion and they can‚Äôt predict things well.

---
As I've seen other say: if a 6 mana Pocket Galaxy is still broken and they have to nerf it again it looks bad on the developers parts.
---
I messed around with it (a lot, OG Mage Star Aligner deck anyone?) when it was at 7 mana, and I'm going to again. It's a fun card. And it should stay that way. It was honestly just dumb at 5 mana, and would possibly still be very powerful at 6 mana.
---
Additionally, Mage has changed a bit since it was last 7 mana. There's new tools and frankly it could be much more playable than the last time it was 7 mana. Sand Witch and Pilgrim are a large reason why. But only time will tell. We'll see over the next month.

Because the post was removed, can you tell me if it was basically Kripp's hyperdraw   sn1p sn4p deck with quest+rafaam added as a secondary win condition?
---
I‚Äôll be honest I tend to ignore the meta and just add whatever cards I think I‚Äôll need and just keep play testing my deck til I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm missing anything. In all honesty though Hearthstone is just a Rock Paper Scissors with votes in my eyes.

That‚Äôll be a good full dust refund when it‚Äôs nerfed
---
Ironically, it only has an average 50% winrate because it has a 60% winrate against Warrior, and slightly higher than 50% winrate against druid, but is around 40 vs. everything else.
---
Yes indeed!
---
Hahahha even that guy!
---
Okay, so 90 multiplied by 89 (turns 1-44, plus half of 45) instead of an even 100, cutting the maximum time down to 8,010 seconds, or "2 hours, 13 minutes, and 30 seconds".
---
With that correction, Kolento WAS over a third of the way through the longest possible game at the 45 minute mark, but I don't think that he would care too much about the small time difference at that point.
---
Yes, when I saw it in the sneak peaks I was like "The character looks awesome, but probably a meh card."
---
Scoundrel is so annoyingly busted. Fought a quest shaman that used his hero power and played scoundrel no less than 4 times. Was just awful
---
usually it's just someone who has DnD on.
---
From the card art, I thought that it gave a minion the "Poisonous" effect.  Making it die at the end of the turn is much more direct.
---
*Cries in Protoss*
---
Wait wrong sub
---
I legit got 3 legendaries. Flark, Myra and Elise. I pretty much just open packs for the dust to craft the actual 2-3 decks I‚Äôll be using for the length of the expansion.

I was playing Armor druid in wild with a jade idol and hardened scales in my hand that coated 0 from Thaurrisan and my opponent giested and it destroyed them.
---
Game's lasting this long has ruined eSport hearthstone for me. It's not fun to play, and it's sure as shit not fun to watch.
---
"Your Opponent" just mean they are on "do not disturb" or whatever the option is called on battlenet. You can still see their name from the add friends screen after the game. No more likely to be a bot than any other opponent.

Wait two years and they'll nerf it with a 1-mana increase like Barnes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, this 2 mana increase should fix everything!‚Äù ‚Äì said my imaginary friend from Blizzard

/u/FardHast any thoughts? üòÉ
---
I‚Äôve had a Golden once since release.  It‚Äôs going to be bittersweet when I dust it.
---
Sweet write-up.  Yeah, I wish I had the cards for this, but I'm not going to spend 2k+ dust on a Tavern Brawl.  It seems really fun tho.
---
The reason Rafaam and Quest are in the deck is very important. If the opponent clears the board of SN1Ps or Zilliaxs with Brawl or practically any Priest spell, the deck loses any chance of winning with a bunch of small minion answers and useless fetching minions. You just drop Rafaam and start playing free legendaries off the quest in that scenario. Sometimes you get lucky with Rafaam and just keep giant legendaries.
---
&gt; We're aware of the size of the nerf
---
Have you read the comments here or on the Blizz site? This is a pretty presumptuous thing to say - *you* might be able to understand it, but many clearly don't have the capability to understand its magnitude and are screeching that it's not enough.
---
I also think it's presumptuous to say that it is still one of the best cards when we have no statistics to corroborate that at all. The card may take a serious blow to its winrates across the board from this, we really cannot predict where CW will fall.
---
Dust wild cards or slowly start grabbing the must have cards.
---
Gain 96 armor in quest shaman Pog
---
Quest Shaman. You can leave out Hagatha and Shudderwock and still have something decent
---
Stubborn Gastropod is a really solid arena card. It‚Äôs like yeti level solid
---
Just incredible luck he didn‚Äôt draw any and switched them all off with ely for the win
---
So what‚Äôs the nightmare hand... three Nightmares and a Nightmare Amalgam?
---
Kind of a misleading stat though. It only gets played by people grabbing it for lethal, of course its got a massive played winrate, you only play it when it wins.
---
Jayce #12346 - EU 80g trade
---
you have to dust it after the nerfs hit. you'll then get full dust (1600).
---
That's right I forgot She replaces the cards. Man what terrible RNG for me that game lol
---
That's how Elysiana works though
---
It's tricky, because that expansion was released within days off it's announcement, so there was no long speculation period
---
I crafted the whole of highlander mage deck and  I don't have any dust left.  What am I to do anymore?  I won't be able to play the game because I have only 1 deck....
---
I crafted him before Nomi, and he has almost never done anything game changing for me, whilst Nomi has won me quite a few games. 
---
By the time you can use his battlecry it‚Äôs usually useless because you‚Äôve only got about 5 cards left.
---
I am aware of all of that. However, your implied solution seems to be to never change cards, only ban them out of Standard.
---
However, Dr. Boom is still causing issues in Standard, so it's getting a nerf for what it is doing in Standard, Hearthstone's marquee format.
---
Nerfing Deathstalker right now is pointless as it is not causing problems in the one format it is legal in. Generally speaking, no hero card is going much of anything in Wild other than Dr. Boom, Bloodreaver Gul'dan, and maybe Frost Lich Jaina. Wild's generally way too fast for them.
---
Additionally, cards can and should probably keep the nerfs they received for what they were doing in Standard. Quite often they'll remain playable in Wild even with the nerfs like Spreading Plaque, Patches the Pirate, Murloc Warleader, Raza the Chained for quite a while, and I'm sure a few others I'm forgetting.
---
True. And people who say "oh but muh Hagatha," or "muh Zul'jin" These two heros are incredibly limited in the value they generate, whereas you just press the button every turn and get value as Boom.

No luck for me. Didn't get a single legendary in any of the packs. :/
---
Disenchant it, and make it in normal for the classic set completion imo
---
Clearly you didn't understand anything I said about errors in stats.
---
And you didn't understand the definition of "arguably." 
---
So I'm done here. G'night.
---
Maybe you due to a bug you dont see your opponents name and they just played normally and fast?
---
I think maybe another idea to think about might be soulfire. Soulfire asks you to pay 1 to deal 4 and discard a card. Soulfire will still do 4 damage if you don't have anything to discard because it first checks to see if you can cast, if the target is a legal target and then asks for the discard. Forbidden words does the same, except instead of discard the last stage here is to drain all of your mana.
---
The real one
---
Yes yes yes, oh my god...
---
The only classics I'm missing are terrible. I just thought it was funny that of all of the legendaries I get the worst one lol
---
I‚Äôve been messing around with a Hakkar Priest deck, since Priest is one of the better classes to take advantage of him. Play Benedictus to steal their deck, Hakkar, then Hemet to get rid of the Corrupted Blood. Most of the time you end up with about as many cards in your deck as your opponent.
---
The best part is, while there‚Äôs a few tech cards your opponent could use to ruin that, they see almost no play these days. Elysiana got nerfed Hemet never saw play to begin with, and Geist isn‚Äôt used as long as Jade isn‚Äôt too popular.
---
Won RDU's 50 pack giveaway, had some gold. Opened 81 packs, got 2 legendaries.

I initially disliked this brawl what with how expensive it was to play for most folks seeing as it used otherwise-niche cards to an absurd degree, but holy shit this is the most uniquely developed meta I've ever seen a Tavern Brawl get. Thanks for this extremely useful writeup!

---
That sound like wild. Boy wild is nuts.
---
You are probably evil.
---
In all card games, pre-cons almost without exception are designed for newer players as a jumping on point. Wizards of the Coast used to label them specifically as products for beginners and booster packs as for "experts." They are still often labeled as "start decks" or "intro packs." This is known.
---
The experienced player doesn't really need to follow a blueprint given to them to build a deck. However, a new player has no idea where to start. That is where Team 5's deck lists come in as a starting point, not the be all end all.
---
Ok but am I a bad person?
---
Let‚Äôs be real for a second here, without odd hero power control warrior does not get to 120 armor.
---
I mean, control warrior is op in standard, but come on
---
It's a huge nerf. It means priest can't do cleric/warden into arms and snowball, it means all priest drops are much more fragile (especially 2 health lightwarden) as they can't rely on the extra health, and it means wild pyromancer clear/draw turns are nowhere near as efficient. Actually 6 mana for +4/+4 is expensive so arms is probably being cut from the deck and there's no other similar replacement.
---
I loved Finley sighing with relief when he transforms into a random ... Finley.
---
Lol at needing Barnes. Now wild is going to be 100% aggro decks.

Lyra is a girl??
---
Credit for trying? We back on kindergarten now?
---
Because the issue with control warrior is not dr boom but the fact they have 29 other impeccable control cards
---
Sure it‚Äôs ‚Äú2 turns later‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt mean the warrior can‚Äôt play any incredible removal for those two turns. Warpath, brawl, plague of wrath, restless mummy, liGHt tHe FuSeS, the tomb wardens, taunts, zilliax, devastator
---
It‚Äôs so overwhelming that even if it was a 10 mana card it wouldn‚Äôt matter
---
And AFTER dr boom is played? Then your minions will never stay on a board. Every mech will 2 for one basically
---
To be fair, his quote is actually:
---
"No tomb can hold me! ... No tomb can hold me!"
---
Oh right they always sound like they are drowning in some to me
---
Nah they have infinite omega and armor.
---
Why are you offensive? You're playing a control deck in wild without #1 tech card that is a must in many matchups. You're crying that easily countered deck is OP without building a decent deck yourself. 
---
If you want for people to only agree with you and pat you on the back then reddit is not a place for you.
---
As others have said, the extra 2 cards will be "burned". You can never have a hand over 10, anything else going into your hand is destroyed.
---
It costs a lot in developer time, hence money, to make structural changes. I understand why changing a number is always preferable. Trust me you don't want them to accidentally break the game instead.
---
There are a bunch of beginner guides out there if you search online.
---
I like the hearthstone top decks website.
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/hearthstone-beginners-guide-2017-guides-tips-tricks-new-players/
---
Mage and Hunter are very new player friendly. Hunter in particular usually has a good budget midrange deck.
---
You can also find some budget decks here.
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/hearthstone-budget-cheap-decks/
---
To get a good idea how good your cards in each class are shopping up. Install hearthstone deck tracker, upload your collection to hsreplay, then see that decks you can build our are close to being able to build. You can limit to you collection, then choose the amount of dust to spend. This is a great tool for understanding how good your cards in each class are without having to manually analysis your collection.
---
Because you're stupid and annoying. Next question. Also reddit is the biggest circle jerk webiste ever; full of smartasses like yourself. Maybe stop being a cunt
---
1 out of 20 is the AVERAGE. And people have been voicing their opinions on this for years. As long as people buy packs nothing is going to fundamentally change.
---
I guess statistics have never been your strongest point.
---
Raiding party was nuts in wild back then, by with the double whammy rogue nerf, i think the prep nerf alone was good enough to make raiding party good but not utterly broken.
---
Nice job dude! Pretty straight forward game plan with the ol'murlocs. Lense tip and pray! Always feels good!
---
Elise copying Elise (Floop) and Earthen Scales, since opponent obviously fails to remove Linecracker you can Earthen Scales the Linecracker into infinity
---
You're getting another one in he next 9 packs.
---
Do you realise the game is mostly server side?
---
Got it already, that was when expansion aired :)
---
This is  joke tho right
---
I actually quit playing Hearthstone during TGT when Tank Up warrior and Freeze mage were strong because it felt like I couldn't play the game.  Nothing I did matter, I was basically an AI opponent for my opponent.
---
&gt;WOW! A VIDEOGAME cheaper than a physical card game.
---
Hearthstone is as much a videogame to its target audience as chess is a sport to the general population.
---
How much armor, what mana cost, what stats
---
Thats not how any of this works
---
If that's how odds worked, then you could flip a coin and it would always go heads, tails, heads, tails. Instead, it tells you the expected outcome over a long term timeframe.
---
Whattt, you mean to tell me combo decks beat control? OMG your a genius
---
Yep. I'm not particularly poor, but the amount you need to spend to guarantee really even being able to make 1 full on ladder deck is astronomical. If you spend $80, the price of a full A title game, you will get barely anything. 
---
$80 should be a season pass, not maybe getting half of 3 decks.
---
Some people out there must be paying it, otherwise they'd lower prices.
---
This has been posted already a while ago
---
I know, I understood his joke. It just wasn't a sarcastic one. I don't understand why people use that /s on everything
---
nerfs are about to happen, the meta might change. I would honestly wait.
---
I think you can probably get by without snip snap.
---
Honestly, no matter how much you might think you need a card, it isn't worth it if you are dusting legendaries. Especially so many
---
Just try and make a deck with the tools you have now. That would be my advice.
---
I used to do what you did 4 years ago, and you start realizing how "oh shit, now I need that card for this deck" after an expansion drops. If you can hold out for the next 4 months, and for the nerfs monday, I would honestly just keep your legendaries.
---

Hey man, I came back to HS 4 months ago after a 2 year hiatus from 2016 to 2018 and so I have been on your boat. 
---
What I have done:
---
1) Open first ten packs from all standard expansions and get the guaranteed legendary. Pray that you get good legendaries. I didn‚Äôt :(
---
2) I then opened Rise of Shadows packs because they have the best cards in general and all their legendaries see some sort of play (same can‚Äôt be said for Rastakhans, Witchwood, Boomsday Project as there are some god-awful legendaries that you may get that are literally 400 dust, nothing else). I got Nozari and Oblivitron (they are not good but I have used them on Dragon Paladin and Mech Hunter decks respectively) so far, but you might be luckier. 
---
3) A month or two before the new expansion (SoU) I started saving up gold to buy packs. I managed to purchase 40 packs within the first days to the new expansion so I can have a headstart in the collection. To say the least I was awfully lucky with this expansion, I opened 3 tier 1 legendaries with these packs, got free quest (a mediocre one but still playable) and had enough dust to craft Siamat. So 5 legends in total from that expansion. I got 11 epics, which I have to say is wayyyy to much for 40 packs. Currently I have nearly 70% of the expansion and it has been easy for me to make cheap decks that utilise quiet a lot of commons and rares. You can‚Äôt do this now as the expansion has already come but you can certainly do it for the next expansion if you are patient enough (and please do, you will have a headstart when compared to other f2p players). 
---
4) Currently opening few Boomsday Packs to get my second legendary and I am opening this expansion as it has important cards for budget Mech decks like Mech warlock, mech hunter and token mech Druid. So I recommend opening this expansion along with Saviours of Uldum after Rise of Shadows. 
---
5) I also play a little bit of Wild for mainly for fun. Luckily I have a decent collection of cards from Whispers of the Old Gods and the classic set as well. If you have a decent collection from prior expansions, then you might fare well in Wild. 
---
Note:
---
I am completely f2p and hasn‚Äôt payed a dime since Naxxramas. Don‚Äôt know if I will pay for this game but I would like to have the welcome bundle. It‚Äôs a great deal. So that‚Äôs a good start if you‚Äôd like to pay money for the game. 
---
This game is pretty expensive to say the least. I have to say I have been lucky with Saviours of Uldum and if I wasn‚Äôt in the situation I am now (and got horrendous legendaries), all I would be playing is token Druid. 
---
PM me if you need help with budget decks. I have some good ones that I have used from other players and they have been a success.
---
I believ dreampetal florist doesn‚Äôt hit 0 mana minions.
---
It's ridiculous that if a hit from his Battlecry forces an effect to trigger, his whole animation has to wind up from the beginning. That's definitely not how it should work. While not as extreme as here, yesterday I hit Eternium Rover that was buffed to 5 by Zilliax and it was already way too long and annoying.
---
Just dust everything for Leeroy Jenkins.
---
I don't think it's good design that to win you have to use your prebuilt deck as an arena deck.
---
I have never beaten a shaman who has finished the quest
---
YA HAHAHA
---
You won‚Äôt stand a chance in competitive play as Lord Jaraxxus hasn‚Äôt been in any good decks since literally the first expansion came out. You can still have fun with him and that‚Äôs what it should be all about.
---
VS says otherwise on Murloc Paladin. Meanwhile, Highlander Hunter's prominence was due in large part to its favorable matchups against Highlander Mage and Control Warrior, two decks that are taking hits. Leaving Priest with a buffed Extra Arms would have probably been pretty crazy, even if it wouldn't dominate Hunter.
---

I recently looked at my purchase history, and I wish I hadn't.

I am sure they made enough money to satisfy a few benchmarks, and it‚Äôs just micro aggression on my end. 
---
But making a deck, learning a deck, and then having core cards get nerfed thus ruining the deck isn‚Äôt my idea of enjoyment. 
---
I am an engineer and make more than enough money, but blizzard won‚Äôt see any more from me.
---
Agreed 100%. I have the money to buy the large pre order packs each expansion. I don't because it feels like a horrible waste. So now they get $0 out of me. Feel like if they loosened up how bad of a deal packs are they would get a lot more people buying them.
---
Ya'll dont have to tell me the obvious. Either link a build if you happen to have or don't comment.
---
Of course. I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
I can trade khasidon#2605
---
I cant afford highlander anything so I had to Dalaran Heist it.
---
Chew
---
If you don‚Äôt have him you don‚Äôt need to craft him, but if you have him I would include him.
---
There‚Äôs no reason why they shouldn‚Äôt be able to watch/hear them while I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm happy to wait the same amount of time as before, but without a bunch of crap on my screen. 
---
Obviously it wouldn‚Äôt be for everyone.
---
Can't say I feel too bad for anyone playing deathstalker rexxar.
---
It didn't do anything to help against aggro.  It gave you the chance you needed to beat other control decks.
---
Yap üòÑ
---
I meant OP
---
I don't fully agree with that. Ive played around 100 whizbang games this month and while the deck is dependent on drawing lucentbark its pretty good in my opinion. It also has the 7 mana tutor card, so if you mulligan agressively for those 2 cards + floop + ramp then you should be fine. If youre vs A Control deck with hexes just hold off on playing lucentbark till you have floop and faceless, so you can reliably make 3 lucentbarks over 2 turns.
---
Only problem I have is that its too easy to get a Mass dispel or mass murloc poly from zephrys =/
---
It's VERY quiet
---
Kinda want to know how he gets to the late game...
---
I like the fact that you hard casted the ancient one

Is that a jojoke?
---
what does this have anything to do with Hearthstone
---
I just thought that overriding your opponent‚Äôs turn was a thing of the past, patched long ago, so this was a very good minion combination to show that it isn‚Äôt.
---
We have Zayle right now, and there probably will be.
---
Not all cards can be good for myriad reasons.
---
Plus, Quest Hunter can complete the Quest only a little slower than other classes, usually around turn seven.
---
Wow like mages need another freeze
---
That's what you get for playing Hunter Hero.
---
Oh I agree, especially when you're already at full hp
---
I‚Äôve never gotten two legendaries out of 1 pack
---
clearly you havent met riot games and their inability to use adobe air
---
And we thought Shudderwock + Lifedrinker before the changes were bad.
---
better example was when fan of knives played twice, once for the damage, once for the draw for some reason
---
theres a ton of cards that have a repeating animation bug
---
Same. I think Aggro Warrior is here to stay.
---
Gonk also did but fuck druid amirightbois
---
Misdirection works, but some players forget that Wandering Monster (and Noble Sacrifice!) don't trigger if you have a full board. &gt;:)
---
Not being able to participate effectively in 20-30% of matches is such a huge problem that WotC decided they had to rig the raw to make it tolerable.
---
Pretty sure 95% of the team is art &amp; design and like 3 people actually fix stuff like this. 
---
It takes way too long to fix these issues
---
I crafted Sylvanas, Carnivorous Cube, Humongous Plant and some other nice to have cards for the Void Singularity brawl. Damn that was fun.
---
Do you only watch movies with lots of depth, read books with tons of complexity, eat foods with multiple layers of sophisticated flavors?
---
People are capable of enjoying multiple things or preferring one over another because of *or in spite of* their depth and complexity. Nothing you've said explains why anyone with a PC should abandon Hearthstone for Magic.
---
All the downvotes prove I am completely right about this thing
---
You're really reaching with these criticisms.
---
Haha, how on earth does being downvoted prove you're right?
---
I prefer hearthstone to magic, mostly.
---
Your utter lack of participation in the MTG sub shows that your on tilt and just looking for a 'not-hearthstone' to troll about.
---
Well it wasn't just battlecries. Armorsmith triggers when your minions take damage, so if your opponent plays a Whirlwind, the first trigger will play at normal speed and then sped up for the remainder of the board. Same for stuff like Frothing Berseker, Acolyte of Pain, and Northshire Cleric.
---
Thanks dude appreciate your effort. Add me in mtgarena
---
It's a bug with new card and not Nozdormu, and his message sounds like "this game is old and still have bugs?" and it makes no sense, the more updates the game have the more there is possibilities of bugs

You mean class cards?
---
Probably because I played WoW back in the day so the cards have nostalgia and are related to a world I know a lot about. Where I couldn't really get into the what behind the cards in mtg

There's mtg sub? Wtfffff????? What's next Ben Brode left hs?

I think he's the kind of person that when they're looking for a new experience will order off the McDonald's International menu.

I like to overwhelm my opponent with lankeys and spell generation...they normally can't keep up with the cards.

This is a cheaper deck; otherwise I would add quest, lifesteal blades and/or possibly lankey king.

Dude trust me

His point is literally the title

Haha! A man of sophisticated tastes.

I'm pretty sure he's a troll at this point. His comments quickly took a turn from ridiculous to absurd.

because this assures you draw 2 more useless cards .

---
just a joke dont rage on me

Because I‚Äôm sick of warriors and how stupid they are

I agree, but just adding onto how they fixed Shudderwock ruining game mechanically.
---
on tilt and just looking for a 'not-hearthstone'
---
You're totally right
---
This cards would be broken in paladin no thanks.
---
Having one class left to get golden, I am all for working another class up to 500. Sure their card pool would be much, much smaller compared to the other classes, but overtime things would level out. If they ever overhaul the Basic/Classic set, that would surely be the time to do it as they could introduce a full Basic set for Monk/Demon Hunter/Etc.
---
I know this idea is a pipe dream and it‚Äôs already hard to balance the 9 classes that we do have, but there are so many wonderful ideas for new classes beyond just the WoW ones. I personally would love a Tinker class with a Goblin/Gnome default hero.

if it gets rush it can attack every turn, but not the face it's silly

I mean Res Priest is already a tier 3 deck that loses to all of the good decks and wins only against bad decks. The barnes nerf will push it down further, but its already subpar.

Lmao. Thanks üòÇ

Huh??  Amet is one of the best legendaries in the set.  Even after extra arms nerf it‚Äôll be played in priest decks until it rotates.

Hi I'm Squelched#21689 in EU, looking to trade 80g quest, I show, you go! (apologies I posted this yesterday and fell asleep by mistake, sorry for ignoring you if you added me yesterday)
---
Feel you, I opened 91 packs and got 4 legendaries. I opened the first leg in my very first pack, so I opened 1 legendary every 30 packs and this wasn‚Äôt fun. My 91 packs were 100% free so I didn‚Äôt complain that much but this is the reason I don‚Äôt spend money on this game. 50 or 80 are just too much for me, I can afford maybe 20 or 30 but 50 is way too much. Also I like to spend my money knowing what I‚Äôll get ( solo adventures, games on steam... I mean I paid 20 for both Dark Souls 1 and 2 for over 1000 hours of gameplay ). Spending 20 or 30 bucks for the chance of getting what I want is a big no for me.
---
And a frozen 3/5
---
&gt;I may try it.  I've been doing well and having a lot of fun with this.
---
? that doesn't make any sense did you try it or not and how then did you had lot of fun with it if you didn't try it lmao.
---
Effect-blocking is completely core to the utility of Asphyxiate - it makes it so friendly **detrimental** battlecries (i.e. Flame Imp and Pit Lord) don't trigger either. A better change would be to tie it to a low cost minion, so it could feasibly be removed with a Rush to make space for Battlecry minions to come out.
---
Birth control is a helluva drug
---
Zephyrs can't give the Plague of Murlocs. Only classic and basic cards.
---
Blizzard! The fix is NOT fixing Reno. It's fixing ALL animations in general! Animations are too long across the board, period!
---
Speed up the animation times for everything by 33%
---
I was saying I may try out his deck, and posted a deck I've been using that has some similar elements.
---
Oh I am pretty sure the meta is going to shift to a way more aggro oriented one with the (hopeful) decline in control warrior.
---
That's far easier and we don't even get that
---
What deck?
---
I believe that the idea behind Asphyxiate also is that you can follow with your overstatted demons with negative battlecries.
---
I like seeing the eye candy once then I don't care anymore and just want to compete. A lot of RPGs give me the option to skip. The only way you're getting both is if they speed up animations considerably.
---
What happens when your removal comes in the form of a Battlecry effect, like Kobold Lackey or Weaponised Wasp?
---
That tends to make for a problem.
---
And eh, use Asphyxiate with Flame Imp and you have a crappy Succubus. Seems like bad utility to use it in that way, especially if it's to cheat out big minions with detrimental effects - in that case, you're less likely to play Asphyxiate as you are just a good minion.

Hey iVigi, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).

Yea I remember the same thing it was a few patches back they said the whole skipping turn thing shouldn't happen.
---
highlander mage
---
I'll never understand why people play real decks in casual.
---
Left cheek HYPERBRUH
---
We have 2 different issues at play here:
---
1. It's annoying that the animation takes a long time.  As you said, that's a bug with the new card.
---
2. It's ridiculous that enemy turn animations counts against YOUR turn timer.  This isn't limited to the new card.  Opponents can eat up your turn time by kicking off heavy animations and then clicking End Turn.  This has been a problem for 5 years.
---
That's not not really the fault of the deck, it's just that heal druid is a weak archetype. The best way to improve it would be to make it a different deck.

Highlander struggles hard against them.
---
It‚Äôs also wild. It was played when it was standard. That‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúWell, Kathrena sees no play in wild‚Äù when it was in a standard tier 1 deck
---
As another user said 6 mana deal 11 damage to up to 4 targets would be stupid busted.
---
In a pinch it can also just function as a sticky minion to throw on the board.
---
I guess time will tell on priest as a whole but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Amet is a great legendary by itself and when/if priest is competitive it will be a core card.
---
In over 200 packs I still have no history buff!
---
Tell that to last expansions control warrior.
---
I predict something like the Witchwood adventure will happen. In fact, the Monster Hunt was probably just to see how we would react to only having four heroes fight five villains.

If you want to "cheat out" Overstatted minions by preventing their Battlecries, you probably don't want to be using a whole card to do that.
---
If you want to disrupt the enemy, Asphyxiate makes Battlecry minions cost (3) more or something.
---
If you want to work in your favour, you probably want another card altogether that isn't just "You're spending this card making your decent cards a little better" in what would probably end up being just Zoolock. Like having an actual body attached to it, and having text that reads "Battlecry: Your other Battlecries do not trigger this turn."
---
Even using it with Doomguard, all you've done is make Doomguard "cost (1) more" and it discards one less card. With Flame Imp? It's not even Radiance.
---
You'd have to save a lot of Battlecries together to make the card "worth it," and if your plan is to play overstatted minions, having to play them altogether in the same turn means you're not cheating them out particularly early.
---
So a 2 Mana 2/3 that reads "Your Battlecries do not trigger" sounds like a better idea than just a 1 Mana effect that does nothing by itself, and not very much when combined with only a single other Battlecry.
---
Otherwise if you plan on having powerful Battlecry-detriment cards *and* two-way disruption on a single card, it becomes really wonky.
---
Hope you get 5 game loss streak. Fuck mage
---
Did you win??
---
Because one guy decided to downvote him, and people saw a downvoted comment and did the same without reading it.
---
Thus is the will of the almighty Reddit hivemind
---
I mean with druid you can do 5 mana deal 10 damage, I think it would have been fine to give Paladin a stronger reborn card.
---
*Strongly like*

Val'anyr never took off in constructed but the main reason for that is because when it was in standard, both the twilight acolyte-cabal shadow priest combo and silence in general were fucking everywhere and hinging your gameplan on buffing a minion got hard countered like 2 out of 3 games, and the rest were aggro matchups. I actually think it's good in arena.
---
I mean... Yes, but... wtf?
---
a bit daring are we
---
Why is this being upvoted, you‚Äôre literally just being a dick.
---
Basically 4 mana Rush, Divine Shield, Windfury. Nice balanced card, Blizzard
---
The meta Shudderwock deck (low Tier 2) just goes infinite with a lot of healing but it doesn't do much else so it can still die to OTKs for instance but it has Loatheb which is a game-winner, if you play Loatheb and then start looping Shudderwocks the opponent is locked out of playing spells for the rest of the game so that's GG.

---
That's debatable. I think I'd rather run militia commander at 4 over this at 5.
---
When I saw this I immediately thought 'why buff thunder head if you're just going to give this to warrior to immediately murder it? Militia commanded was the problem with turn 4 thunder head to begin with'
---
This is really cool (and probably delicious)
---
Armagedillo is good but I wouldn't put it on the same level as flunky or mummy.
---
Yeah no shit
---
&gt; It's really, really, REALLY simple, my man. Forbidden Words says "spend all your mana" on the text. Regardless if the hand cost is 0 or 5 or even 8, in this particular case the player has EIGHT MANA TO SPEND. That makes a 5attack minion a valid targeting option. 
---
Right, which is why forbidden shaping, forbidden flame, and forbidden ritual can get around Loatheb by ignoring the 5 you spend to cast the spell.
---
Oh wait, they don't, they all work as intended.
---
STFU
---
The game is on 3 platforms with no real restrictions on just about any specs, experiences already vastly differ.
---
I hope the vitriolic way the community responded to your post doesn‚Äôt stop you from feeling like you achieved something.
---
They may have a point that sharing it here is not the best idea, but I understand wanting to share.
---
I remember being at that point and feeling so good just to make it to rank 10. Keep grinding and you‚Äôll make legend one day!
---
What survey is this?
---
This is the Reno power level you build decks around.
---
queued into warrior, he'll have an update tomm
---
Most everything with the quest hero power is stupid busted, that's kind of the point of the reward. 2 mana egg/whelp? 2 mana zilliax? I don't really think that's the reason it's not a paladin card, especially considering they got the lifesteal reborn card, which makes more sense identity-wise than rush would, which is a warrior thing now.

You would have LOVED magic:online. Some bugs were over 15 years old.
---
I mean, barely. It‚Äôs like one in every 10 matches against Pally now, and that in itself is one in every 10, so like 1% of matches.
---
It‚Äôs rare you‚Äôre going to have time to get the value out of the weapon in Arena. Where Octasari says kill me and fill me hand or I kill you. It‚Äôs a good card and you could burn 5 cards on the draw and not care. Any more than that and you probably had other plays better than dropping an 8/8 for 8. But burning draws in no concern in arena.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt adding 2x forge be enough to fill your 2-drops out?
---
Lay on hands. As in [https://youtu.be/rHybGlGVFK8?t=101](https://youtu.be/rHybGlGVFK8?t=101)
---
The egg and Zilliax are 3 cards out of 30 that reward you for completing the quest. If you add 2 more it stops being a challenging deck with a rewarding payoff and just becomes a deck full of broken things with the downside of an average opener.
---
Control warrior is stupidly overpowered as it is, that doesnt mean its ok to give them a second Snip-Snap you know?
---
I mean, based on HSReplay stats it's not.
---
It's arguably on a higher level than than Frightened Flunky and mummy.  Armagedillo is the second highest drawn winrate in the deck (behind only Dr Boom) and will most likely be the highest winrate card in the deck post-nerfs.
---
Octo retarded good in arena
---
That's the thing, i don't want to play a counter deck to big priest for the third year now, i wanna play a deck that i would feel safe it has a chance of winning over big priest.
---
Please address my points above. This ENTIRE comment is just detailing the way the card works, which obviously is how the card works. None of it is an argument that is \*should\* work that way.
---
&gt; None of the other Forbidden spells are binary, they ALL have effects fluctuating on the mana spent. 
---
Look, your main argument was that it was binary, which I plainly showed was false. It's binary only in the kill/no kill sense, but it scales in what it can kill with the mana spent. In other words, the effect fluctuates based on mana spent.
---
&gt; Forbidden Words has only one possible outcome - single minion kill. It doesn't kill a minion multiple times based on your mana, it doesn't kill more minions based on your mana, it kills ONE minion ONCE, with no other possible effect. 
---
False, as above. It can't necessarily kill a minion, or if you spend more, it can.
---
&gt; All other Forbidden cards have numeric value resolutions that differ depending on the amount of mana spent - more/less healing or damage or imps summoned etc 
---
This is true, but isn't a good reason for being able to gimp Loatheb, unless you're saying that the coding is hard.
---
ALL MINIONS
---
"attacked" taking 4 years to reach rank 10 (again you start at 20) is very very bad and slow. Nobody is attacking him or telling him he cant be a casual player. But posting online that you took 4 years to climb rank 10 is just asking to be made fun off
---
Literally arena logic
---
Doesn't it sound like Patton Oswalt is saying that?
---
Oh wow, I didn't think it was so good. My mistake.
---
Username checks out
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
I already lost several games after getting this card snd never being able to attack with it.
---
Ha hearthspoon
---
I'm just saying I don't think power-level is the reason mummy isn't a paladin card, but more class identity of lifesteal vs rush.
---
I really want an option that allows you to turn off all animations. Would definitely help with mobile performance as well I'd imagine.
---
I don't think Sidequesting Adventurer is bad design. If anything, "get rid of this thing then you can continue with your game plan" is more interesting to me than "destroy a card of this exact type". And a 3/3 is much easier to remove from hand than a 2/5. But I do agree with you that hate cards tend to be way too niche.
---
I agree with you that Deadly Moves is the best of this set.
---
I also agree with you on Disidra. I love the idea of a mega totem, but taking Kalimos' thing seems way too random and dilutes Kalimos' identity.
---
I thought Jeweller Jinx was cool at first, but then I realized, what deck cares about this? Unless you're playing a Fatigue deck, it will probably draw you one card at best.
---
It‚Äôs decent, but not nearly as good as Octo, who is god tier in arena. Valued at 1.3 cards, which is insane.
---
/r/notokbuddyretard

I hope nobody talked you into Val‚Äôanyr, because Octo is the objectively right choice.
---
You really had to put ‚Äòoverweight‚Äô to get sympathy points eh? The karma grab here is bonkers on this sub
---
1 mana more on barnes is going to end BP at high ranks. If the deck is meta, it will be a more controlling version that excludes Barnes altogether.
---
BP is currently Tier 3 in wild, and looking to get even worse.
---
The deck is dead. It was a good nerf.
---
It's WAY too efficient. I'm not too sure yet what the deck will do because Dr. Boom is a win condition for control warrior
---
How would it be unfair if anyone can toggle it in options?
---
I'm fine with an option to turn off animations. Would definitely help much of the issues regarding the mobile client currently.
---
This spoke to me damn
---
I solely play whiz bang and with that deck you basically have to have floop in hand if you‚Äôre against mage/shaman because like you said, he‚Äôs the win condition, so then you can floop(lucentbark) then faceless and start your board, but man does it feel good once you get a board of 6 of them and just trample your opponent
---
As a Mage who made it to Legend for the first time ever with Reno Mage I can say that Quest Paladin was a rough matchup for me unless I drew perfectly. Now that I‚Äôm in Legend I‚Äôve been messing around with other decks (Singleton Priest, Quest Rogue, Singleton Hunter) and I‚Äôve found that Quest Paladin always seems like it‚Äôs going to be an easy win, and I‚Äôm constantly surprised by how I either get steamrolled or I barely, and I mean barely eek out a win.
---
I think it‚Äôs just legitimately a good deck, but great run with it and congrats!
---
What are u even saying? Well duh if u don‚Äôt want to have a disadvantage then turn it off. And THATS why it should be toggleable
---
Odds were right. Nobody cares.
---
*smug sultry giggling*
---
Octo-Dad all day. It's your divine favor, plus a big dude in one.
---
NO MMPH CAN MMPH ME
---
How you would get rid of that thing can easily be the same way you'd progress your Quest. 3 Mana 3/3 sounds like a wonderful Weaponised Wasp target to me, but then it succeeds in disrupting you. That's a big deal.
---
What if your only play as Quest Rogue is to Clever Disguise? What if you want to remove it with Bazaar Mugger? Boom, more disruption.
---
Even Skulking Geist had more general utility than just flipping off Jade Idol. It had *broad applicability* just like Acidic Swamp Ooze does or SI:7 Infiltrator do.
---
This card doesn't. It would be like a card that reads "Combos do not trigger."
---
I tried Arena (got to Mythic on the three first seasons btw, left on 4th). 
---
My main reason to leave was because of the mulligan's m√∫ltiple hide hands system for Bo1. I would like Bo1's mulligan fase to be just random, without rigging, as it is in Bo3. 
---
Now, if you ask me why didnt I play Bo3 instead of Bo1 then, it happens that I dont like to play 2-3 guaranteed consecutive games versus the same archetype
---
Ghostly Charger and Shirvallah are both Paladin cards with rush.
---
Nearly half of all Rush cards are neutral. Priest and Mage are the only two classes that dont have their own Rush minion.
---
Warrior and Druid both have 6 Rush cards and Hunter has 5. It is not a warrior thing.
---

Because they don't want to play them ranked?

I still remember the hydra or double Flappy Bird on turn one of old aggro druid.

This is how I feel whenever I go to wild rank 20 for quests and get BM'ed
---
There isn't any catacomb capable of imprisoning me!
---
Do you know if he uninstalled HS after that ?
---
Sure, but it shouldn‚Äôt let you cast it. 
---
The wording is "Spend all your mana, destroy a minion with that much attack or less"
---
In other words, the mana you spend on that clause should be the limitation on targeting. You've already spent five in this case to cast the spell.
---
cool story bro
---
Also poisonous is pretty annoying
---
Should have been a Paladin card
---
Honestly one of the better weekly albums in a long while. Sidequesting Adventurer is kind of lame though, and coding Zysreph seems to be impossible.
---
I think it's really necessary, one more superdamage from hand for warriors. They were struggling u know...har to break through that 70 % winrate. This should help.
---
Welcome to Modern Hearthstone
---
That might be good depending on the deck, like a rouge deck without sprint would actually like octo but it's the very first pick and he is playing paladin, valanyr is always good and therefore an insta pick
---
er
---
Even luckier is that there is a stickied post for pack pulls at the top of the sub!
---
Kangor's makes or breaks it. I don't have it, got my quest as the free one, which is why I'm left frustrated, wondering why even bother, and going back to Bomb Hunter which is what the Legendary-granting card pack gods decided I should play.
---
Ranting time: Last match I lost had me facing Murloc Paladin, him low-rolling his first Lenses into the second copy which then got him Tip the Scales which was cleared by me with no face damage with a Consecration. His Nomi was then pulled out by my Hecklebot and he's left with 5 cards in deck. His win conditions are gone. And then bloody Zephrys comes in, discovers him a Cabal Shadow Priest which steals my Annoy-o-Module'd Mechano Egg. G-fucking-G. You'd think a deck should lose after having both its win conditions neutralised and being 15 cards behind for Fatigue, but Zephrys thinks otherwise. Wish this sub had a weekly rage venting thread, it's one of the games that need it most.
---
Asking for a friend...
---
Poor you. Can't escape the cancer even in wild casual. LOL
---
Thanks! It was too perfect, buying it was more of a reflex than decision
---
Are we going to get a tournament mode like China?
---
The exact same thing could be said if flare did destroy counter-spell. After all, flare is a spell, so counter-spell should stop it from activating (which it does) and is why things are working as they are supposed to.
---
Every other deck that doesn't run that shit-eating stoner genie, that is.
---
Zephrys always, and I mean always, fucks me over. Be it by Mass Dispelling a full board of magnetised eggs or stealing the big one with a Cabal Shadow Priest.
---
That‚Äôs a cool lunch box dude, I dig it.
---
Octosari is fun as long it works. Best use IMO is to play hunter and shuffle in strong beasts with [[Dire Frenzy]]. Would even put in Elekk to make the effect stronger.
---
Thats 2 legendaries

4/-/- | Give a Beast +3/+3. Shuffle 3 copies into your deck with +3/+3.  
---
He's right, though.
---
What's your source on one legendary every 20 packs?
---
Town crier, worgen, militia commander, akali, Dr. Boom, rocket boots, boomship, woodcutter's axe, wasp... It's totally disingenuous to say rush isn't a warrior thing, even if some other classes have a few rush cards. 
---
You're only trying to convince yourself otherwise for the sake of your argument. 
---
There are neutral divine shield cards, but paladin is still the divine shield class. There are neutral deathrattle cards, even though rogue and hunter and the deathrattle classes.
---
I'd be interested in seeing the rest of their survey.

thanks, wouldn't have guessed in a million years

[[Reatless Mummy]]

OMG, this is really terrible
---
You are most certainly trpping my friend
---
You were actually a priest that cleverly disguised themselves as a rogue
---
I got them from the guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs. I got luck and got three rogue legendaries.
---
I‚Äôll definitely try these changes out thanks.
---
Correction. Magic arena has problems with this. Those devs also refuse to allow animations to turn off. And it's hilarious for their game because all the animations look awful, unlink hearthstones.
---
You mean concealed
---
I mean, it was clear he was just making contrary comments. And for the record, i upvoted his whole chain.
---
I play whiz and zayles in casual does that count?
---
They probably won‚Äôt.
---
NICE!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that I argued with him, just had a simple discussion
---
but regardless of  what the current system is the system I proposed is better then what we currently have.
---
*Also on a side note, I did some revisions since the post (again it was a week ago) looked into it more and found out that the system is based off of your solo win loss ratio in casual. Forgot to update the post because irl stuff happened and simply forgot. 
---
But I‚Äôve just updated the post to include a edit correcting myself. 
---
Thank you for your input though.
---
And to address your comment,
---
Oh yeah. I remember when I got an OG Dr. Boom like 3 days after I crafted him. I wasnt very happy about that.
---
4 mana deal 6 fire ball
---
3 mana destroy and random minion
---
5 mana deal 5 heal 5
---
4 mana deal 4 cost 0 if you are holding another class card
---
3 mana deal 3 or 5 if you have a beast
---
10 mana deal 10
---
2 mana deal 3
---
1 mana deal 4 discard a random card
---
I know there is more but the point is these are all targetable. 4 mana deal 6 that has to consider taunts is ok. I think the problem is the fact that the damage for 4 mana can be split between two targets. So let‚Äôs look at it this way:
---
Multi shot 4 mana deal 3 damage to two RANDOM targets.
---
So for 4 mana I can deal 3 to two at random. It ignores taunt but it‚Äôs random. This card is targetable but has to consider taunt. I believe the two cards both have draw backs that off set and there for the card is actually perfectly fine.
---
Now for me to analyze why I took the time to analyze.
---
I hope they'll do RR,that set has plenty of interesting ideas cards.
---
Dies to removal
---
Spores would be a perfect fit for a Druid secret... we need more secrets for all classes - it‚Äôs about the only counterplay we have since the turns swap without interrupts.
---
Warrior could have things like ‚Äúunexpected feint‚Äù or ‚Äúvicious backhand‚Äù that makes minions take damage or armor gain in response to spells...
---
Druid could have spores like above or ‚Äúnature‚Äôs aid‚Äù that summons a treant after you get attacked...
---
Give warlock things like ‚Äúdeath pact‚Äù that kills a random friendly minion to prevent a single source of damage or ‚Äúvoid rune‚Äù that takes an attacking minion to death with the minion they attacked...
---
Give shaman things like their water shield and lightning shield from wow...
---
The ideas are endless... please give us all secrets!
---
Zephrys shaman is op as fuck although I have no reference deck, sorry
---
When you see Cyrillic just skip and don't ask
---
It would have been 1 whole point for getting legend.
---
Hmm, 47.4% overall.  Whizbang in tier 3, that's probably better than I expected.  I did not adjust for matches played because that'd actually be less accurate.
---
Came back from a long break...only play standard...
---
Oops
---
Warrior was really struggling with removal, though. Hope T5 keep continuing to print removal cards until next rotation.
---
Welcome to reddit lmao
---
No it's not. Where are you getting this from? There are stats derived from millions of pack openings, as well as the stats Blizzard provided to China, that place the mean at around 1 in 20.
---
No bomb can told me
---
k.
---
It actually does (57-58% IIRC). 80% against control warrior.

---
I play in Casual mode to practice decks that I haven't played in a while sometimes, but I will go in with meta decks. The fact that the Priest has everything in Golden probably means that it's a favorite deck/they've played it quite a bit, so I kinda doubt they're doing that.
---
Unless they have a *full golden* collection, which would be kinda insane. Based on a quick calculation, a full golden collection would take 3,724,000 dust to craft, which would take about 37,240 packs to collect. Assuming you can buy each pack for $1 each (biggest bundle/Amazon coins), you'd have to spend $37,240 to get one... *damn*.
---
Based on the most popular Big Priest decklist on [hsreplay](https://hsreplay.net/decks/dg0z0nnqTkKpLSW0b4KaFh/#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;tab=overview), that deck alone would take 39,200 dust to craft, or ~$400 worth of packs. Still, *damn*.

Hey RejectKid89, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".

If you don't need the dust, don't disenchant anything. If you do need, do not mass disenchant and only go for those that look really weak and will never see play.
