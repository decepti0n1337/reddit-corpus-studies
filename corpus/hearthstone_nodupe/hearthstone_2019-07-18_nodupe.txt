Yes, I can think critically therefore I'm just SO INVESTED. lol.

**PSA for this Brawl**: If you find up taking a Draw on one of these bosses, it doesn't end your run. Instead you get to take another crack at the boss you tied with.
---

---
this just happened to me as Rafaam vs Vaelastrasz -- the second-to-last guy, whose AutoCast h.p. draws 2 cards for both players. We were both down to like 10 health, and several cards into fatigue. I couldn't finish him off, then on his turn, the latest fatigue hits sent us both below 0. So I was like "great, no golden Rafaam's Scheme for me"
---
but then the run didn't end!  so I was like "woah, check this out"
---
Damn, that takes a lot of restraint. In the same position I'd imagine I wouldn't have the same patience/respect
---
Regis started getting to reveal cards and I’ve seen his stream grow from around just about 100 per stream to consistently over 200. It’s great for those smaller streamers just trying to make it happen
---
Did you not see that like, 90% of the comments on here are jacking him off?
---
What's funny is that a comment on the original r/customhearthstone thread where this card was created was by someone that said that the card was OP because "just a few chargers" and you could OTK.

---
I don't even play HS anymore but I don't have a problem with you having a card reveal.
---
These posts are getting ridiculous. He's an arch-thief. He steals stuff. The bucket says thief. He even has a hero power that steals cards from opponent's deck and gloves of mugging in his base deck. Figure it out...
---
Was this ripped straight out of DK64?  I love it.
---
Because Kripp is still primarily a Hearthstone player and as far as I know all his YouTube vids are about Hearthstone.  
---
Toast is not really a hearthstone player nowadays, shame cause I liked him, don't like TFT
---
&gt; I also said well played as he conceded, i was genuinly saying well played but he took it as a BM.   
---
Because Blizzard doesn't allow a BM response, they have destroyed communication.  Hence, players assume "well played" actually means something negative.  This is an inevitable result of Blizzard attempting to screw with language.
---
No it wasn’t but you might have gotten it through a pack and not noticed??
---
what are his personal feelings on hearthstone?
---
if your feeling for the game are this weak you werent paying money for it anyways who cares about f2p people from marketting point of view
---
Lol at this above comment. And people wonder why he wants nothing to do with the HS community anymore.
---
Sorry, you went against against the hivemind. have some dinvotes
---
Its a vanilla 30/30. Silence does nothing to it.
---
You can make a good amount of money selling accounts during elections.
---
Who is shitting on him "all over reddit?"
---
Maybe this is what happens when you Curse of Flesh an Oblivitron.  Was Oblivitron in WoW?
---
Eh, the benefits of advertising have been proven over and over again. The drawbacks of negative advertising, which are what that'd be is... well. Bad press is still press.
---
These posts are so ridiculous. Does no one actually think before posting. He's a freaking thief people. Figure it out
---
I actually did everything I was supposed to to earn the free Tyrande skin and then they never followed through. I never bother trying to buy any skins after that, if they don’t honor the free skins they make you jump through hoops for, who’s to say they don’t just pocket my money for nothing in return?
---
Mana Cyclone and Magic Dart Frog, Stargazer Luna. They're very strong cards and easy to activate by running a lot of cheap spells. Ray of Frost too.
---
It's always on the menu, but nobody orders it
---
I never liked the guy, but i dont think anybody should give half a fuck what some random angry people on the internet think. You could say it sends more wrong messages to morons who think they accomplished sth now.
---
Something something corridor creeper?
---
^^I may or may not have seen what you’re referencing
---
The game is stale. I have 0 interest in playing any games in HS right now but it is difficult to let go because of the investment I have in it. I really do not want to play and if I quit now I will never come back for any reason even if the game magically becomes 100x better as I will be too far behind to catch up. So basically it is a question of should I quit forever or keep playing? The game is way too expensive normally so there is no chance I will spend money to catch up because it would cost hundreds of dollars.
---
Easy solution. Release same card at same time by multiple streamers (one HS and one other).
---
While Taunt is a Warrior mechanic, one can argue, that the benefit of Taunt is keeping the party alive. In other words, Taunt, as a mechanic is meaningless on its own. 
---
In other words, what good is Taunt for the warrior who fights alone? The Taunt is there to help a party of classes cooperate. Taunt is as much a mechanic for Priests as it is warriors because most, if not all of, Priest’s healing efforts are going to the Taunt target. 
---
In other words, Taunt isn’t something that solely belongs to warrior.
---
Nope, there was literally one thread yesterday that was *mildly* critical of him, but that was it. And of the comments in this thread are super supportive of him, and his legions of fanboys are downvoting anything that says otherwise.
---
Their victim complex is inane. Imagine going berserk defending a guy with over 1 million Twitch followers from some mean words on the internet lol
---
The reason we see less hero portraits in the shop is when they first started doing them, there was huge complaints in the community that these skins were locked away (some reason the community has been very against paid cosmetics in the early days, perhaps general sentiment has changed now but who knows). Hence, why it has only been the initial three and none have been added since.
---
Reddit: Don't make Mech Warrior better.
---
Also Reddit: This doesn't go into Mech Warrior so this card is TRASH, **REEE**.
---
----
---
Mike Donais heavily implied we'll see playable taunt minions for Warrior. So given that, this could be good. Just depends on the support. Card seems good as long as the deck that it goes into exists.
---
Honestly, if I was Blizzard and I could pick between Thijs, Toast and Kripp to do card reveals for FREE on their stream, OR I could pay Will Smith 1 million dollars to do them, I'd be calling up Will Smith.  
---
This idea that you are supposed to be rewarded for your time invested/loyalty is total BS.  
---
Noone "deserves" anything.
---
Why do we still care what some variety streamers do. Well i can get behind it tho, distancing yourself from dying game's drama is healthy for his mental for sure
---
Better something than nothing.
---
&gt; The transformation would happen before the Battlecry. Twilight Drake would lose one attack, but it would gain two health. 
---
Normally a twillight drake is played as a 4/5. Here, after quest, it would be a 3/3.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, a horde of 3/3s do nothing to win a midgame/lategame. Why would you run a quest so bad? It synergices way less with 1 health minions than cards like never surrender, or simple silverhand synergies.
---
Also, mage quest reward isnt a legendary effect from before, same for shaman. Only druid and warlock were, and you guys already think its how all the rest of the 7 quests will be.
---
All of them at once, I suppose.
---
No shit.
---
It's improper Goblin.
---
so you like his click bait videos too?
---
Yeah, sorry, that was what I meant
---
he clearly spoke to people before tweeting... and using your logic blizzard would take him off and people would be making up stories about it..he addressed it.. hes got 30 k viewers why would he give a shit about shitty hs for a days boost. also its this sub thats making a deal out of it both times anyway hahaha.. imagine stretching for things to bitch about that hard
---
If you hammer it weath face you can play around zilliax
---
This sub is already a circlejerk itself
---
How is the line enunciated? 
---
If the pitch nearing the end of the sentence rises, the line is likely to be intended as a question (a rhetorical one most probably, given the situation). 
---
The omission of 'Did' is to then make the line seem more conversational and thus more in-character.
---
Not everyone speaks in perfect English all the time, even you I dare say. So it only makes sense that characters themselves don't speak in perfect English all the time.
---
Let's turn Wild into an Ancient One meta. We will prevail !
---
Hah! You got gold \*and\* platinum! Now try telling us it wasn't clickbait!
---
Yeah, imo you have to bait to get views most of the time. And some of the clickbait he does for his combo videos are funny.
---
Luckily swarmy (zoo) warlock is always a cheap and relatively meta deck (weak right now, but mostly because other decks just do it better). 
---
People generally recommend things like "look up budget zoo decks and build towards them" but honestly, i prefered to make the deckbuilding mistakes myself. If your coming from another tcg background you might not have to though
---
I’ve unsubscribed from his channel because of that
---
But if it’s “random”, then wouldn’t that be hard to pull off?
---
I've been going F2P since BlackRock Mountain so at this point I'm finally a F2P "whale". Whenever an expansion comes out I have enough dust to craft anything I could ever want, and enough gold to get a jumpstart on things while I keep farming quests.  
---
If they offered better cosmetics for reasonable prices, I'd get some of them. But at this point, I'd be paying 80 dollars pretty much for the skin alone (card backs are not that cool, c'mon).   
---
In this sense I feel like Hearthstone whales who're not obsessed with getting EVERY card will preorder once or maybe twice and that'll be enough for them to already have built a good enough collection to not "need" to do it again.
---
Good riddance
---
cosmetics are not for f2p players when it's the entire game's monetization system
---
Hey cfs1002, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

I mean, you can generally edit clips after recording. Don't get me wrong though, I still appreciate the memes and I'm not trying to be a dick about it, just something to consider for future clips
---
Yeah, without a doubt. Also very fun.
---
In fact the probability is still 1/3, cuz drawing shirvallah out of two draws is 2/3, times the 50/50 next turn, which is 1/3. Nonetheless, you would allow your opponent a turn to maybe kill you or heal back.
---
He is, but I was speaking in the bigger scope of things. He's a minority in a rather new type of job (content creating on the internet).
---
My point at the very root of it was youtube monetization and highlights vids just being more and more common, not whether Toast or not makes a lot of cash.
---
Good for you
---
Looool
---
Pack it up boys we’ve been outjerked again
---
Not a fan of how cartoony bottom right is. Disappointing, considering the same artist did the original (and fantastic) Finley.
---
I have literally never seen this card. Got 8 supercolliders though so that's good.
---
YES. I HAVE TWO DECKS ALREADY AND AM WORKING ON A THIRD. WE WILL SERVE THE ANCIENT ONE
---
&gt; I swear to god, nine times out of ten when I come to this sub there’s some post on the front page bitching about god even knows what. 
---
I feel like every time someone says this, they're including shitposting and general jokes as "bitching."
---
Yeah, I wonder if they changed it at the last minute (like, probably, the warrior armor card).
---
Legendaries are supposed to have big flashy effects, most of them anyway...
---
Grimestreet enforcer isn't even epic, it's rare, and it's pretty much the same card, +some mana here, - some stats there, and this one only affects taunts?
---
Wait you can? Cuz i recorded this on an iphone so im not sure how
---
Pretty sure its the sarcastic "*DID* somebody order a bomb?" But its not proper english because, well its a goblin.
---
Yeah it's still 1/3 for an almost guaranteed otk but there is another 1/3 chance to otk if you live to see the next turn without playing shivallah
---
Your talking strikes like in clash that let you reroll a card of the same rarity, they don't always let you do it but it's there..
---
What I do is just play on another region so idk. Right now the strongest decks for warlock arnt exactly tier one, but they are still good for climbing. This zoolock list (Swarming) is very good for early ranks with alot of Commons and rares, with Sea Giant, Magic Carpet being the ones you want to craft. What I suggest is just watching YouTube videos of people playing warlock decks to get a feel for what u want.
---
Thanks for repeating the joke.
---
I guess they grew bored trying to make handbuff paladin work?
---
&gt;*let's try it with warrior this time*

i just realised the same thing was said by another user
---
Thanks man. Can't wait to start again.

Although yeah this doesnt count if they have zilliax
---
AND ALL I WANTED WAS A FUCKING PEPSI!

---
Not quite good enough to be legendary, but too good to be epic, weird spot.
---
Freeze doesn’t mean I auto win like if I had Sorc Apprentices and Antonidas. I have to find ways to get through powerful taunt minions like Voidlords, Obsidian Statues, Lich Kings, etc. There’s no freezing them until I can toss fireballs to the face.

It might be wild viable but with all the unfair shit there I'm not so sure.

Why Blizz would want to give it to him =/= he deserves it. If I explained to you that someone was made CEO of a company without having proper qualifications because they had family ties to the board of directors, do you think that I'm also saying they deserve the position because they have those family ties?
---
I wouldn't mind if it was mixed. Some free, some in store, some in $80 bundles.
---
With the current pool its exactly 1/4 chance that the murloc survives lightning storm - either because it had 4hp, or because you lost the 50/50 on lightning storm. Which means if you do it on a board larger than 4 minions, at least one minion wont die on average and you wont full clear. 
---
And also keep in mind the ones that dont die are also some of the scarier ones to let live. Its way shitter to not clear an angler, a scargill or an amalgam than it is to let some 1/1s live most of the time.
---
It already curves into Armani and is pretty much the only viable 6 drop for warrior in the game.
---
Oh hey that makes total sense thaurissan was on the field and he was extremely low I remember. Thanks!
---
The heroes are going to fly the city straight into the other side of the mountain on the way back.
---
What about mini amalgam??
---
This is definitely powerful enough to be legendary!
---
I imagine if you build a taunt warrior deck you can reasonably rely on hitting 2 taunt minions with this.
---
That is 6 mana 8/11 taunt. And that’s if it died right away, and if you only have 2 taunt minions in hand. I just said 2 since that is my rough estimate on the “average” number of minions this would pump.  No statistics to back this up at all so feel free to assume a different number 🤷‍♂️
---
Bois since they’re bringing back old mechanics, maybe this last expansion will have some inspire?
---
With that mindset, humanity would be still at stone age.

---
Well there is no set schedule as far as I know. You may as well wait till the last moment as in the past 3 days, there have been as many deals (at least for the US app store version). Two of them were 15% and one was 25%.
---
Looks like it's bugged, it says your spells have lifesteal that turn but it didn't lifesteal on the second volcano. Maybe because the minion had died
---
What does the totem do?
---
You  should try creating a new Amazon account, add only the US address in that one, then configure your app store to use that new ID (you may have to install hearthstone again). Then it should work.
---
Maybe a Ysera Druid hero.
---
Your comment history is nothing but temper tantrums and defending a pedophile. Thats hilarious and sickening respectively.
---
You do need help, but I don't feel bad about how much I'm laughing at seeing you flail about. That's a lot, BTW.
---
Please reply. Your rage will deeply amuse me. I hope you get better tho.
---
Is this how ppl normally respond to being bored with a game? Like just stop playing lol. But if you think that
---
&gt;Hearthstone is a million times better
---
Then just play it. I don't play hearthstone to get as many packs as I can. I already have a decent collection, so I play with new decks and have fun experimenting. I'm confused as to why you don't play the game. Apparently it's so much better, but you don't want to play because it doesn't give you a bunch of rewards. If you already have a decent collection, you don't need extra rewards. The reason Hearthstone is successful is because it's got such a good system of thousands of cards, allowing for infinite possibilities of fun decks. Yet it's a challenge to keep up with the meta and win games. That's why I play the game. Not because of any rewards, lol.
---
F
---
A bunch of streamers kinda quit HS. Savjz, Hafu, Dog. The meta was too stale and got frustrating to stream the same thing all the time. I imagine streamers get burnt out on a game like HS.
---
DS got a big enough following that he didnt have to be a one-game streamer.
---
Which is a good thing. Building a dedicated audience is what a streamer needs in order to survive. Its still risky to do, but props to Toast for doing it.
---
Yes. Eventually, you have to make meta decks.
---
Though who said they have to be expensive? You can easily make budget decks using cheap cards.
---
There's a post here that had a guy who climbed all the way to legend using nothing but common and rares. No epics / legendaries involved (unless you count the snip snap and vargoth, though they are free if you log on during the times they're given to you."
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bno7rx/i_played_to_legend_without_a_single_epic_or/
---
Rank 15 and maybe 10 is possible butvyou need a lot of skill and luck to get there. Midrange hunter is your best shot or token druid
---
We've already killed at least 25 million bosses, they revealed the legendary card.
---
My point was simply that it make no sense to do this.  Just do the card or don't there is no need to be theatrical about it.  Outside of that I might have 3 posts about him on Reddit.  I am not even nearly the people he hates.
---
Actually it's most likely people like you.  Sycophants that white knight him over every little thing creating pushback and drama.  It's you guys that freak him out.
---
That happens before the black rock adventure you timeless locust
---
And it's well deserved. The dude has always been fake as hell, he gamed reddit like mad to become popular in the first place, and of course there's the constantly complaining about people being mean to him to get on the front page of reddit.
---
IF THESE WALLS COULD TAAAAAALK sex
---
Imagine being a fan of Toast pissing your pants when you realize that the deck, in fact, does NOT have the advertised 100% winrate.
---
Then don't play.
---
It's a mystery, Mr. Holmes! There just doesn't seem to be any sources on this man's claims!
---
Yes. Writing a discussion on reddit, which is supposedly a discussion board, is comparable to shouting at the streets. Yes.
---
&gt; Only to be risked getting sued by Blizzard if you intend to market this?
---
Yeah I also thought about that but it seems he's asking for money to cover costs for a personal project, not to fund a game he will sell.
---

legit. my uncle works for blizzard and he told me this story: There was this guy who was working on a new WoW expansion. He was standing in line at a coffee shop and was talking to the person behind him. He mentioned his profession and a little bit, a mere smidgeon, of info on the to-be-released expansion. Someone else in line heard it and put it up on social media. Blizzard then found out which coffee shop it was, went through the receipts for that day to find anyone that worked for the company, found him, and proceeded to fire him. They take leaks very seriously.
---
he's not too interested anymore.
---
Even then. He's asking money for something he didn't create.
---
Ur opponents name tho :) also this wld be better in r/wildhearthstone

You are the one who can't handle the fact that you are wrong, stay bad kiddo
---
The funny part? That's a demon! Hahaha!
---
With all the throwback cards im almost thinking its some bronze dragon timey wimey bullshit we’ll see in the third exp
---
I checked it out, and to be fair that comment was made when there were only 8 existing murlocs, of which 2 had charge. Using the same combo, each old murk-eye would do at least 10 hp of damage, and the possibility of getting an OTK would be a couple entire magnitudes higher (although that still doesn't really make it effective)
---
About .006% with the coin!
---
Seems like he reasonably replied to your angry comment and you're taking it poorly by mimicking him, something a child does when they get mad.
---
Yeah, the original artwork for the card looked kind of strange next to Ulrik and he had a cannon in this art. So I figured I'd just swap them out.
---
Lend them? I don't think I understand you. My intent was to play against each other. I believe there is now way Blizzard would ever let anyone play with cards they didn't aquire by themselfs. So having a list of cards that both players share in their collection would be the most simple and fair way to challenge each other.
---
Year of the Raven did have a fair number of bird cards (The Gurubashi chicken, Vex crow), and the only "bird boss" in a singleplayer expansion (that I know of, anyway) in the form of Cozzlewort from Witchwood. It's not out of the question that we may get a few dragon-themed cards in the Year of the Dragon (and we kind of have already, in the unstable semi-form of Dragon Paladin's fragments)
---
We're getting a third Elise, and it's not a hero card.

There's a reason I chose to watch him for TFT content over everyone else. The dude has a mind for games like it and his years of HS are the foundation. I could watch other content creators but some of them are flat out bad compared to him especially in the way they communicate their thought process which is nice for games like TFT and HS. 
---
But whenever I hear toast I think one thing: ~~Offlinetv~~ Hearthstone.
---
These all showcase a clever design that is not unbalanced nor broken, I really like Reno and Bloated sea devil.
---
But I think sand golem can easily be buffed to a 4/5 and maybe even a 5/5. Its effect is giving your opponent two free cards.  Sure, they might cost a bit more, but its still really strong.
---
only 9 days have passed and the meta is flooded with resurrect priest again! Are you happy? Because I'm not! hahahha Also, requires 0 skill so you can get the golden hero quick af! haHA!
---
My dumbass thought that was an org or location (SoCal/South Carolina) before I realized it was StarCraft.
---
what do you mean, am i missing something?
---
Or maybe, just maybe, in the conflict of Uldum, Elise gets hurt badly. From Reno's standpoint, he sees her die at the hands of the villains and consequently loses it transforming into his true Dragon form raining destruction on the now Villain occupied dalaran. Now the league of explorers has to figure out how to deal with this new crisis where their own team member is threatening to rain destruction on "All who would do harm in Azeroth"... you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
---
How do you know that it just stays at lighthearted jabs?
---
Reddit has the advantage that you can downvote stuff, and people here are usually pretty good at downvoting the really bad comments.
---
But you don't have that on Twitter, on Twitch, or in DMs people send you. And these "lighthearted jabs" very, very quickly turn into downright vile BS people spew towards a streamer, and he has to deal with that.
---
People here regularly underestimate the toxicity of some of the worst the community (any online community, really) has to offer.
---
There's an option in challenges to borrow decks.  If your friend presses that, he can choose to play any of the decks you made against you.
---
You can literally let them borrow your currently made decks in the vs menu. It's at the bottom where the collection button would normally be in play mode under 'borrow decks'.
---
I don't even have a job lol
---
We’ve had the “borrow deck from friends” feature for 15 months - https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/21694420/
---
Ask him what he wants to play, make the deck for him, then he can borrow it at the deck selection screen.
---
The features is there. Really! Never had the chance to use it myself. But take a look the next time you get a chance.

that takes decade to achieve this OTK

I think the problem people have is they are saying “this is too weak to be a legendary” and mean “this card reminds me too much of a rare and is a lazy design”
---
Which I agree, this design seems really lazy to me 🤷‍♂️
---
Very sad :(
---
Being asshole to an asshole is not asshole? What?
---
I dont think you understand what the word "credibility" means...
---
Same thing but not super mega level of difficulty and micromanagement
---
And she has a hero portrait now!
---
&gt;Lend them? I don't think I understand you. 
---
you can share/borrow deck with your friend since a year ago
---
R18 is where meta decks mostly start. In EU, at least.
---
So? Big Game Hunter only works in a meta with large minions. Anti-Secret tools only work in a meta with Secrets. Etcetc. Having tools which basically only targets a certain game style is great.
---
Besides, you're overlooking the power behind forcing your opponent to draw more cards. This have a potential to mill your opponent or to put them further into Fatigue which usually is great if you're playing Control vs Control.
---
Lol someone is done with hearthstone.
---
Yeah it is
---
At the end of my turn they combine, into
---
I wish these weren’t so fast so I could actually read the cards being played :(
---
Gunspire was my first golden legendary :(
---
Why would you want a Taunt archetype? The whole point of Taunt is to protect non-Taunts. Tempo-wise, you might as well be playing vanilla minions at that point. It's the only archetype that actually decreases decision-making compared to a Basic deck.
---
The description about the free heroes is spot on for me as well. It still sucks I couldn't get Tyrande because of my region, and it still stings that they haven't done anything to release her to my region..
---
Blackrock Mountain 2.0!
---
Taunts also protect your face? I mean they've always been useful against aggro decks that don't want to trade.
---
Hard.  Careful though - he's an expert WoW player too. He knows which demon fucked which Orc and how much they enjoyed it.  
---
You should not underestimate his influence.  YOU MIGHT GET DOWNVOTED!
---
&gt; Then Dr Boom comes in riding MechaThun to challenge the old gods Godzilla style
---
Sounds awesome
---
Yeah, good point, forgot about that one.
---
Take my upvote, ancestor
---
I think the whole Arena aspect and being awesome at it was help cement Kripp.  
---
That and he never came across as some pandering fuckwit like some streamers.  
---
To regularly do awesome at Arena is where the true HS skill is at imo (beyon the great players who actually experiment and create decks) yet Blizzard push the ranked concept as people need to have cards to do well at ranked.
---
Well it hasn't been a plotline in Hearthstone yet since the only time there were actual factions involved in an expansion was MSOG
---
Since I don't watch his live streams that much and generally ignore commenters, I've been oblivious to whatever hate out there. DT has always just buut a hilarious and interesting HSer. I love his content. Not too big into the auto chess and have moved on to MTG Arena, but Toast will always be one of my fave streamers.
---
Oh yeah, WoW should be getting a new expansion announcement either at Gamescom in August or Blizzcon in November, right?
---
Hmm.. New dragon... Reno?
---
He is considered mage for this run, so he can utilize that
---
I get that. I like the channel otherwise. They just seem to base their statistics on owning entire sets which doesn't make much sense.
---
Well it’s hard to really say anything cause we have seen good effort but it’s not much in the grand scheme of things but there’s yet again a but-these recent actions are really something new for the development team, if we continue this trend I think that we will have better ‘between ‘expansion’ content’ that might eventually lead to some major improvements
---
Well, you have to expect you're gonna get at least one sour fellow when you raise your Gofundme.
---
&gt; ft. Mechastraza as the big baddie
---
Battlecry: Set a player's Armor to 15?
---
Yeah, that one's ok. Valeera delivers *A LOT* of value though. That's problematic, she's kinda similar to Hagatha in that regard.
---
There are actually a lot of cards that don't have full out RNG. Of the ones I printed, 500 of them use RNG that is doable in real life.
---
As for mutate and other interactions like that: I won't miss them that much. They're fun, but the game can still thrive without them, no?
---
Deathrattle summons are totally doable, I just printed out the tokens as well.
---
Discovers: This is the biggest blow, but there's nothing I can do.
---
Alright buddy.
---
 I'm just confused why you'd fancy a physical copy of the game, but it's barebones, expensive, and only your friends play with you, etc etc.
---
LMAO
---
If you want to see a regular Legend player playing completely homebrew, off-meta weird decks, check out HS Chump on YouTube. All of his videos are weird decks he conjures up and they’re all so interesting and quite fun as well. For example his latest deck was Arcane Devourer Questing Adventurer Cloning Gallery Priest.
---
Microsoft text to speech
---
You're basically playing just the Classic set, probably a few more sets and a ton of tokens with also several cards cut.
---
How in the world will classes be balanced at all? You have cards from different expansions, intertwined with other expansions and some cards are literally cut.
---
Am I just dumb? How do you play as rafaam in the tavern brawl?
---
How much karma did you lose at this point of time \~ Yikes
---
In Blackrock Crash 2,you can play as Rafaam
---
But was it 7 mana bonemare good?
---
Nobody has something against him, he just makes it look that way whenever this sub loses a single word about him.
---
However this kind of behaviour probably made some people actually dislike him.
---
Because they're part of the same thematic space. You're confusing gameplay with thematics. The idea of Priest isn't 'support others', no further questions asked, it's supporting others via things like healing, health buffs, shields, etc. Priest do actually already have taunts because on a gameplay level it's pretty important, but that isn't the core of the priest fantasy. Hearthstone mechanics are at a basic level an abstraction of WoW concepts, and if you look at them from that perspective it should be pretty clear that Priests and taunting are quite far apart.
---
what do you mean the last card?
---
Hey now I didn’t ask to be the best I worked for it
---
Yes.
---
At the same time, there are 135 cards in the set.  You're telling me there's not *one* of those they can give to probably the most all-around dedicated Hearthstone streamer?
---
Hahaha nice! :-)
---
I feel the same. The info is really useful but it feels way too slow... I've played it on a faster speed and works better
---
Stop bying into his victim role. The community reaction to him revealing a card peaked at ~4 guys being like "why does he reveal a card, he doesn't play hs anymore"
---
Complete nay, that would mean that every pack would give a player minimum 260 dust.If packs would always contain 4 commons and a rare then a player would be able to create **any** deck by opening less than 200 packs(however it isn't the case so it would be way worse).And after being bored of that 30 legendary deck he just created the player could simply destroy it without penalty and craft anything else.
---
Hearthstone wouldn't give any profit to Blizzard that way.
---
Turn 1 yeti gg.
---
I love it.
---
Is it a priest card though? Please say yes.
---
Nothing happened. Blizz chose him to reveal a card, a very small minority on reddit didn't like it and toast makes a big deal out of so he can farm sympathy and attention.
---
I got to bag it up.
---
Content-wise I really enjoy watching Roffle, he's a Wild streamer who plays some off-meta decks (e.g. Seaforium Bomber Shudderwock, Reno Hunter) and uploads daily. I get tons of deck inspiration and really enjoy his personality!
---
How long are you going to stay?
---
They are. If a card is on your field, added to your deck, or your hand, then it's your card.
---
What do you mean?
---
What they need to do is give us something that encourages Warriors to use weapons on minions (not just supercollider) instead of just going face and using its other removal options.
---
Steals a card from their deck. If it is a minion it summons it immediately with no battlecry activated. 
---
Also:  wins the game.
---
Because he's always doing shit like this. There were like 3 ppl being like "why does he reveal a card, he doesn't even play hs" and he instantly jumps on the opportunity to play the victim and make a big deal out of it.
---
Just like when he called this one thread who made a joke about him uploading "100% winrate" thumbnails a "toast hate thread".
---
So I noticed this similarity when browsing some Uldum image Search results on Google (yes I am that cool).
---
I know absolutely nothing about WoW lore so anyone with more knowledge than me care to venture some speculation as to what this card might be?
---
Are the Ramkahen an interesting tribe, and should we be excited to see them in Hearthstone?
---
Crazy speculation only please!
---
I understand all the streamers who have left to find other games.
---
 Faithfulness to the audience that made you what you are is one thing, but sadly you cant keep making tasty funnel cakes if the milks soured.
---
It is not just that the game is stale, it's in a boring and oppressive spot as well.
---
I dont blame the current dev team as much as I feel they were handed a real serious pile of problems, in so much that R-Rumble, an entire freaking set, couldnt even cause a tremor of a shake up due to the insane power creep cash grab of the earlier stuff being still live and dominating.
---
Personsly imma give the new team one more set to see what they can do, if it's more of the same I'll hang it up.
---
It could be anything really. They had warriors, hunters, spell casters. They were all over Uldum so I would expect a few different cards involving them.
---
I believe he is coming from the Sky as there is an object that looks like he is rolling down (probably from Dalaran or the Boomship) after the lasers start.
---
While I don't understand why Blizzard making a profit is your concern, that's correct.
---
I feel like there was an MTG card with a very similar effect but I can't recall it right now. I just remember being a kid and one of the older kids playing this unkillable hydra and being frustrated to no end.
---
Also I was the first one to do so and I got zero upvotes
---
So from what I can see (as someone who never played) the Ramkahen are the "good" Tolvir fighting against the "evil" Neferset, which Tekahn seems to be a part of.  They are allied with Salhet, so probably a Paladin card.
---
&gt;  that are getting no support
---
So you have seen the entire set and know this?
---
Chrishky#2313 NA quest trade 80g
---
Malkoth#1863 EU 80g trade.  
---
I will show quest, but you go first.
---
Check my post history for reliability.
---
Teamfight Tactics more fun
---
Good for you spending 40% more. Stick it to the man.
---
What hero power is that
---
Welp lookalike druids gonna be king for a whole expansion again.
---
It's simple. They initially designed it in a way that led to a reliable OTK. Then they decided to "fix" it by destroying it. They didn't bother to actually fix it.
---
Steal a card from your opponent's deck, if it's a minion, summon it.
---
Except it gives all your opponents minions taunt, which lets you get around a specific taunt.
---
Understandable! But when you can I recommend doing it, trust me it feels good when someone joins and chats a little.
---
Are you asking if that's some "official" slang (its not), or did you not understand what I meant by it?
---
I'm trying to make you realise that anyone that ironically utters the words sheeple and snowflake should probably seriously reevaluate their beliefs or top themselves for the betterment of humanity
---
What a sick animation. A shame this card won't see play
---
Saronite died for this.
---
1. Yes, the meta is very stale, and yes, Toast always play less HS in the last month of the expansion cycle, however this time he didn't play not even a little bit of HS and he didn't even make a SOU review. 
---
He probably already quit HS, and since he doesn't interested in making HS content, he doesn't want to travel a card, the tweet just was kind of official announcement that he quit HS.
---
2. People just looking for victims to protect and and criminals to blame. Most of people commenting in the tweeter post didn't really look at the comments in the posts about toast, most of the comments/post that toast choose to be offended of are just legitimate criticism (like this one) there are very small amount of real hate comments.
---
The card has moved to Wild, but I'm kind of interested to see how [[Fatespinner]] is handled. 
---
Not that I think it will be useful, but just curious on the interaction.

---
Yeah, it's retarded to just give full dust value for EVERY card.
---
Take it like this
---
You spent all your dust making a deck.
---
It sucks.
---
So you dust everything and make a Control Warrior deck 
---
you do not lose anything. It's a free trial essentially.
---
People are gonna have access to the whole collection and play whatever deck they want. Its going to be chaotic. Golden cards won't even matter anymore, (unless dust value for them is doubled).
---
Game gets boring. While you have tried every deck, the feeling of getting a good card, getting a legendary, is all lost, since you can easily make one, and try it out. Then dust it and try another.
---
Interesting, is there any reason there isn’t any reveals on the 27th?
---
Never knew how much I needed a fighting game starring Hearthstone characters.
---
Is there a fighting game that lets you “summon” monsters that replace your character in the match?  I know there’s tag ins, but I want to tag in Reno Jackson, maybe Ragnaros, or a Molten Giant.  How freaking cool would that be!

It makes sense, though. She must leave your hand in order to trigger her Battlecry, and by that time, you have no more cards from another class.

Kripp is in his thirties. I wouldn't say old as fuck, but definitely older than most gamers on reddit. He's and Brian Kibler are definitely exceptions to the rule though.

I dont understand what you meant by it :/

Yep, I managed this too last night. Friend couldn't believe it. I think my pull was T3 though! Easy win, he tried to kill it, but only dealt 10 damage to a 20hp monster, so it wasn't going anywhere.

There's actually a specific murloc Holmes artwork.

---
I actually disagree, and I came here to say that card is completely busted. That card should probably be    6 or 7 mana. That card would make mill rogue a tier 1 deck.
---
Best 3 drop in the game?
---
No, wish I could take credit for that, but Root of All Evil was something of a throwback card, kind of like how Jan'alai could summon Ragnaros.

I was just saying. Np

I think you're missing the point: the goal of the AoL nerf wasn't because it was too strong, it was because there literally wasn't a reason to not play it. Their goal was to make it so that new cards could be up for consideration without having to compete with an autoinclude from the classic set.
---
True the deck was boring as as sin but most players saw more consistent wins with it than the two comp shaman decks that actually got decent win rates
---
Damn, im glad they got banned.

Wow. That's what? .000000001% of the chinese hearthstone population?

that's one of a few really weird sounding 'features' of english, needs some time until you're used to that, but this time will come, young jedi. language often doesn't make sense, it's rather a question of habituality.
---
Maybe Kazakus, he's a hearthstone dragon...
---
Also this seems fitting since they are bringing back cards from the past...
---
Saying I don't like when people in general do this thing is not the same as saying I don't like when you in particular do this thing.
---
The full potential of the god cards
---
All i see in this picture are your total wins
---
My thinking exactly. It's not like Toast absolutely quit HS, he made it clear that it was a short break. TFT is the new thing, and he often plays it with other people. Mind-boggling how people instantly assume he betrayed the whole HS community.
---
On the topic, why was Keeper of the Grove Nerfed? It doesn't seem that powerful with it's prenerfed state as a 2/4 for 4 Mana. Even a 2/3 seems safe.
---
Of course they are. No argument here. But it's still kind of shitty to go out of your way to tell someone you don't like them.
---
I did the same damn thing last night against Ragnaros...
---
Linecracker depends on Overkill for the damage buff, not damage being dealt to it.
---
i was never talking about the power level of the decks. saying shaman got shafted while rogue was favored i agree. saying druid was favored is not true at all. and dont forget that aggro shaman is quite close at being the best deck in the game, only thing limiting it is warrior.
---
I think your math might be off by 1% :D
---
I love this me. Let me summon me again.

So Blizzard/NetEase permanently banned the accounts and also ban the accounts from participating Hearthstone events in 2019 (which to me sounds redundant). Wouldn't it be better if they stated that the account holder be banned from participating HS events in 2019. Even though I know they could be anonymous, but what's stopping Boris from making another different account and participate in HS events?
---
wait how do you become rafaam?

I love reddit standard time

Whoa, completely different game.

Perfect case of “the hive mind doesn’t think independently”
---
Kobolds: "you know, I never really cared for candles"
---
But you don’t get the full game for $80 not even close to all the cards for that expansion
---
What you're saying is you can end them rightly without having to actually unscrew the pommel? That seems hard to believe.
---
What procs first? Summoning 2 treants, or giving +2/+2 buff to other minions?
---
Well the thing about the tech in is that at worst you're getting a spider tank and maybe late game it allows you to stall a turn after they time out to get lethal
---
Oh interesting - yeah Warrior is by far the easiest matchup. Build a big mech, hit them in the face, you win. Sometimes they get nutty mulligans and draws, but for the most part Mech Paladin hard counters the current warrior decks.
---
C'mon dude, can you please take the time to scroll at reddit just for like a minute and notice the exact play has been posted not one, not two, but SEVERAL times
---
[yes](https://v.redd.it/r1rxp70ul9t21)

Sorry, i used this one as a base and edited it. Missing peaces were drawn by hand, so this was not done by a template or something.

They won't be adding Finley to this brawl because he's not a member of the League of E.V.I.L and next week is a different brawl instead of another week of Blackrock Crash
---
Finley has no chance of being a hero seeing how he is on the good team
---
Just make echo have a limit of 10 times. Jeez. In most cases echo cards will never get close to that limit anyway, but it stops any crazy unlimited damage combos. And Reckless Experimenter can be changed back too. This could also be a difference between "Repeatable this turn" and "Echo"
---
I guess if you read and reason at a second grade level it can seem like that yes. There's nothing contradictory about "don't name oppressive decks more oppressive" and "don't waste cards on pointless undersupported half baked archetypes"
---
It's Crotchety Axe Guy's long lost brother.
---
&gt;there's too many toxic players that it's not worth it
---
But depending on the community isn't this the fault of mods/admins/whoever? Like you say "large game communities" but what does that mean? Surely the Hearthstone subreddit, for example, would have less toxic posts if there were more rules constraining people and dictating what is/isn't allowed? Or a large game Discord? 
---
I'm not denying that smaller communities are harder to get lost in, at all. But the idea of a "toxic community" seems a bit silly to me because unless you ARE generalizing, yourself, and referring to the entire group surrounding a game like Hearthstone (Which I don't think you are frankly), moderation is always an option and a possibility. And a hostile or inappropriate environment is the fault of those who run it, first and foremost. They're the ones who can delete comments and suspend/ban/otherwise punish people.
---
&gt;I very rarely see anyone treat another poorly just because they're part of some specific gaming community
---
I've seen people say they either don't want to watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, or have friends who don't want to watch JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, because of "the community". As I said in my comment before this one, I saw people shitting on Undertale fans as "annoying" and subsequently people who didn't play Undertale BECAUSE of annoying fans and not wanting to be associated with them.
---
Actually while I'm at it let's go to that. The "association" point is one I've seen quite a bit. I've seen a multitude of people say they "stopped associating with X community" because it was "bad"/"toxic". They don't acknowledge that there's individual toxic players in either their words or apparently their actions. If they did the latter, they wouldn't entirely seek to distance themselves.
---
Now I'm not saying people can't do what they want. But that is treating every player or fan like a potential toxic entity because of the few bad apples that ruin the bunch. Again: I'm not saying "the Reddit community" or a "Discord community". Just, "the Hearthstone community". Or "Slay the Spire community".
---
Oh damn that sound pretty good

slizzle466 is such a great Wild Hearthstone content creator. 
---

---
Consistently inconsistent
---
2 weeks worth of games - they took last week off
---
Very good for wild play!
---
I mean this card is good but it is NOT a build-around. gotta have more highlander synergy to warrant giving up all your dupes just for this
---
So creative. Get in line to the other 200 ppl that posted the same shit in the last couple of days.
---
Mage only running 1 copy of Conjurer's Calling? Don't make me laugh.
---
Mage as a class is currently being carried by a single card. Without CC, Mage disappears from ladder. They need to print a hell of a lot more for the class to justify including this card in a deck.
---
What a boring card with a generic payoff and restrictive conditions. Reminds me of the epic that deals damage based on cards in hand
---
A lot of cards should be unnerfed
---
This card seem really strong, just not as exciting as classic Reno himself. 
---
We've all seen how often Dyn-o-matic clears the board and this is just a stronger Dyn-o-matic.
---
Really weak. Not a worthwhile payoff in current standard. Even in wild, this seems too weak.
---
They haven't revealed the Paladin Quest yet.

You get to run 2 of him and with no restriction.
---
I think its a cool card but the pay-off isn't worth the restriction.
---
*laughs in Omega Devastator*
---
Much lower restriction on the battle cry with the same effect but *targeted*. Yikes.
---
Kinda lame tbh
---
That's not what I mean. Revealing cards where such a small part of the playerbase will actually see the reveal is dumb.
---
Compare this to omega devastator hahaha
---
Maybe it will curve into something else with highlander synergy?
---
It was sarcastic, turbo sperg
---
Compare this card to something like Godfrey. Pretty disappointing in power level and boring effect.

---
Based on what, because you don't like it?
---
Looks wack
---
Not only is not super interesting, but it's not a worthwhile payoff in standard either. Definitely not as game changing as original Reno.
---
Well, that's disappointing.

Prob will find a place in Wild Reno Mage, but too bad for anything other than that
---
I've been taking a Breath in Wild but I still haven't found the Master Sword. Any tips? Did Harrison steal it?
---
The payoff may not be interesting or unique but don't be fooled: This is a very good card. The fact that it targets only minions is an plus, not a setback. You get some good damage on the board (in some cases, a board clear) and a 4/6 attached to it. I really like this card.
---
Ok, I must've missed that tidbit.
---
So he's an upgraded Meteorologist/Avenging Wrath. I'm sure he'll see play, but damn this is underwhelming.
---
i swear to fuck
---
WE'RE GONNA BE ~~RICH~~ SAD
---
What? It's a double [[Dyn-o-matic]] that can't hit your own board.
---
Such a shit card
---
Damn can't tell if I should feel dumb for not realizing it never said it was going to be streamed or annoyed it wasn't presented more clearly. Perhaps a bit of both. Blizzard has been a bit sloppy with clarity lately, but still my fault I guess. I'll definitely be sure to read more closely next time. Hopefully we still get some news on the panel.
---
Fuck you. Good job.
---
I'm not sure to up or downvote
---
Hopefully we get another highlander card or two this expac, otherwise this is garbo

5/3/4 Mech | Battlecry: Deal 5 damage randomly split among all minions except Mechs.  
---
Here’s an easier approach that also happens to be consistent with [[Heavy Metal]]...
---
Just add (up to 10) to conjurer’s calling. 
---
You are still getting value, but not at the level of consistency we are currently seeing with the current 12 drop options.
---
Very wack
---
There will have to be a hell of a lot more support for this to work in Standard, at most I can only see this hitting Wild in Renomage where they can easily slot this in with the other powerful highlander drops (OG Reno and Kazakus)
---
The effect is not bad at all, a 4/6 that deals 10 (even if split) is pretty strong.
---
It´s just that the condition is too steep. This feels like a support card that fits into existing highlander archetypes (mainly wild), but doesn´t warrant one on its own.
---
It's a worse, but better [[Volcano]]
---
Lets not revive the Blink Fox memes.
---
... it’s shit
---
I think this is meant to encourage a control Mage archetype. As people have pointed out, it’s a weak payoff for a highlander condition, but you can have duplicates in your deck if you just hold Reno until towards the end of the game. And only targeting minions reduces the RNG of your board clear.
---
Wow, that is way worse then all of the theories I read on this sub.

5/-/- | Deal 15 damage randomly split among all minions. Overload: (2)  
---
Let's hope Brann, Elise and Finley are not such massive disappointments I guess.
---
I expected them to change these type of effects to "if your deck started with no duplicates".. Now bomb warrior will just make Highlander decks sad:(
---
In defense of this card it does say “minion” which is key. That could be a board wipe on turn six and you dropped a 4/6 on the board. I’ll agree it’s not flashy, but it will definitely be played.

6/-/- | Summon a random minion with Cost equal to your Armor (up to 10).  
---
I feel like this card will be 'To my side' all over again considering this sub's reaction, and the payoff is actually WAY better than 'To my side'
---
I mean... it's way better than Meteorologist, because at least its effect and statline makes sense. Having a big hand size on randomly distributed damage is worse than needing a Highlander deck. At least a Highlander deck could be played aggressively.
---
But... it's way better than a trash card that never saw real play. It's Reno, it's a Legendary, and all it does is compare well to a trash card. And without further Highlander support, it's *really* not going to be good at all. The payoff is far too insignificant to justify it.
---
I'll hold off on harsh judgements for now but at the moment this card is disappointing.
---
This card seem really strong, just not as exciting as classic Reno himself.
---
You used to highlander for full heal or a free hero power. Now highlander for 2 cinderstorms without face burst? That card is so disappointing.
---
Yes, pretty meh, but there might be some synergistic 'every time your minions deal damage' thing in the pipeline, so let's not REEE too hard.
---
POWER UNDERWHELIMG
---
It's just underwhelming and the effect isn't as unique and hoped. Possible that they had something more interesting, but it was too hard to balance.
---
Pretty sure theyll just have a video ready that theyll post on their site once they are done with the reval at the con.
---
Just need a bit of patience.
---
Yeah, as underwhelming as the text may be, it lines up with the flavor of Reno’s ‘machine gun’ he has this set.
---
&gt; not build your deck with no duplicates good
---
Right, so why would you ever do it?
---
except the downside of dynomatic is that you get to play doctor boom while the downside of this is that you have to cut half the good mage cards from your deck
---
Boring
---
dudes it's probably not blizzard's choice to not stream
---
Pretty much a meteorologist with some extra stats if requirement is met. and no face. Meh
---
"We're gonna be...middle class!"
---
Good for wild, bad for standard. Not every card needs to be designed with standard in mind
---
Wow. I kinda imagined this effect when I saw the chaingun but discarded it as too simple.
---
Feels more like an Epic but maybe Mage gets other cards that synergize with highlander deck.
---
Oh man, i almost read "Reno, the Ginecologist"
---
I was pretty hyped for the return of highlander decks but this... this is jut sad.
---
Uh..... Reno? Ok....
---
I'm not sure Reno mage wants this. This isn't a reliable board clear.
---
The reveal is right now.  It's not a leak.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Hopefully there's more highlander stuff in the set...this alone seems extremely weak.
---
&gt; No dignity!
---
.I'd like to bag it up (bag it up)
---
If this the ideas they come up with now, then it’ll be an underwhelming expansion in terms of creativity
---
I don't think the people who are interested in purchasing the entire expansion say the progression system as anything but an annoyance. The current system is just a reminder of the grind and the storefront every time I try to build a deck I simply can't because I don't have the  brand new legendary or two. Players like me would be happy to earn gold for no real reason and to simply play the game how they want day 1.
---
That card has boring art tho it deserves a boring effect
---
Totally agree, but I'm also thankful that mage now has a hard counter when their boards get out of hand. I'll take murlocs over a board of Giants any day.
---
Double dynomatic for 1 more mana is very powerful
---
The same picture has been in new for 10 minutes and you've already tried reposting it? Do you have no shame or no brain?

its possible they print other reasons to go highlander, for example a neutral legendary or other class synergy cards
---
Why not just run \[\[Meteorologist\]\]? In my deck it often gets 6-7 damage, can go face, and has no build around
---
wow that’s weak.

6/3/3 | Battlecry: For each card in your hand, deal 1 damage to a random enemy.  
---
No, it will def play this. Having that 4/6 body is huge
---
This won't even be a full board clear every time.  There are plenty of boards with more than 10 health these days, a Mage should know that better than anyone.
---
Yeah so now we can enjoy our opponent high rolling this turn 2 or we can enjoy not drawing it until turn 15 and just thinking how we could won if we drew it sooner...
---
I can understand not wanting this type of deck to be too strong or frustrating to play against, but, man, this is just so *boring* which is perhaps the most egregious mistake Team 5 could make with someone as iconic as Reno Freaking Jackson.
---
They just remove animations. The only thing stopping you from playing 40 snip snaps is the animation takes so long.
---
That's very creative! I can't wait to watch Dog execute this combo.
---
WOw this trailer is just so cool.
---
What kind of fan artist takes the time to make such an incredible short movie like this ?
---
I don't. I see these as Wild and Arena only unless there is a big synergy neutral card or 3 for them.
---
You run 2 copies of it and wait until you draw both of them
---
You don't have to dump your deck, only your hand. Regardless there's probably better combos, I just thought this was an interesting meme.
---
why not just run king krush? its 2 more mana but you dont have to make your deck shit
---
They just need to Hall of Fame giants. They have been prevalent in every meta (mostly as warlock cards) and are quite frankly not interesting and haven’t been for a while.
---
Blizzard: We're removing Mind Blast because we want Priests to control rather than do damage from hand
---
You: Just replace Mind Blast with different face burn!
---
Just play this is wild. Then it's just a strict upgrade and you get to play the real Jackson.
---
severely gimping your deck so you can be "drawing a card or two" isn't going to cut it
---
OTOH if it didn't have that it could be a meme OTK.
---
What's inconsistent?
---
No they definitely count and will F up any Reno ish cards. So these are going to be not super great in Standard
---
Do we know if death is checked for in between the two effects, or is it like lifesteal and you can heal a dead thing back to life?
---
Can’t believe I had to scroll down this far down to see him.
---
Yeah, he’s a really good content creator that really puts a lot of work in his analysis, deck building &amp; card ratings.
---
I hope to see more from him in the coming weeks since it’s reveal season where he always has good indicators of where the Meta might be headed as well as the comical missed predictions videos where everyone overestimated or underestimated a particular card in the set for each expansion.
---
Overall a great content creator with a witty personality &amp; a lot of great moments when he streams occasionally.
---
[[Ancient of Lore]] (sorry I forgot and I cba to look it up)
---
*effect
---
A shell of his former self :(
---
There is also witchwood piper and murloc tastyfin that can tutor this
---
This is underwhelming... so far all the card reveals have been. Lesser, weaker effects of stuff done in the past.
---
The combo actually can't be done as I posted it (without obscene apm) because the floops will clog the board. Naturalize is indeed the better combo.
---
So disappointed. The only good one is Finley. And maybe Elise. 
---
This does however explain the existence of twinspell. Twinspell was practically made for highlander decks.
---
To be honest, after seeing Reno i wouldnt be surprised if the others had similar underwhelming effects.   
---
Finley. 5 mana 1/2 if your deck has no duplicates spawn 2 1/1 murlocs with rush.   
---
Brann. 6 mana 4/4 if your deck has no duplicates trigger battlecries 2 twice this turn.

7/5/5 | Choose One - Draw a card; or Restore 5 Health.  
---
Technically it was the same for me with some of my games. Everyone at my LGS moved on from Duel Masters, so I just couldn’t play that game anymore. 
---
I understand there is a big difference between physical cards and Hearthstone cards, I just have never been able to wrap my head around people assuming one pre order will get them the entire set.
---
I know AAA Games are $60 and they’re...usually....a full game. But that’s just not what Hearthstone is. If you don’t like that, that’s cool, I don’t blame you, I haven’t spent money on Hearthstone since TfT, and due to that I know I won’t be able to play every deck available. However it also means I had to be better with my dust.
---
I like playing Rouge, Pally, Hunter, and Shaman. Only four classes I’ve really ever liked so between those four I can usually find a few decks I enjoy playing. 
---
It’s a steep cost, but people saying $80 should get you the whole set just baffles me.
---
Not even a dragon tag, I'm sad.
---
Well that’s not as good as you think because if you’re playing one that means there’s only one in your deck so it won’t be deleted
---
Same. It's just not worth at all compared to the fun I can get spending the same money on other games. If it was cheaper I would reconsider, but for $80 there's still a chance your legendaries will be trash tier and you'll be hurting for dust before long. Remember the clip of Dane buying $20 worth of packs so he could complete a deck, and he didn't even get enough dust for a single legendary? It's not worth.
---
Yea - this is really underwhelming for mage... I think not having the reliance on hand size was maybe what held back the devs. I'd have loved to see this just straight be a 4-6 damage flamestrike for the highlander requirement... being able to drop a 4/6 with a flamestrike on turn 6 is STRONK and would solidify a mage board control deck (allowing you to follow up with flamestrike again on turn 7 if the opponent flooded the board after Reno).
---
Let's have the set give a try at fixing the problem before letting the sledgehammer of card changes do it.
---
[meteorologist] is stronger than reno
---
it's because he lost his hat.
---
But they used to have adventures between, which had less cards.  Now they're all expansions.
---
Glad to have helped :D
---
Should be a 5/6 or even a 5/7 but not draw 2 cards
---
You know even if this was a good battlecry how the f*** is the only 1 copy effect EVER going to work against bomb warrior?
---
I had that pull too on Turn 2 of my first Rafaam run - win on Turn 4 was nuts
---
Does Elise duplicate mana reduction too?
---
Who said Blizzard doesn't care about Wild? Wild Reno hunter support! Dane will be happy.
---
AH, ty for the reply on this, that sucks!
---
You are not making posts while also mentioning your website. You are making posts *specifically to advertise* your website. Posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/cdld6a/top_legend_decks_of_the_week_13_standard_and_wild/) where you are plug links to your website upwards of 80 times is nothing short of predatory.
---
Releasing a standard card aimed for wild is stupid.
---
Face is always the place - Devs don't want hunter to do anything else apparently.
---
Mage already has good board clears. Severely limiting your deck just to play this card makes no sense.
---
Can hope, but the odds of having your deck meet the requirements is low if you don't build around it.
---
so you're looking at some decent odds by turn 3/4-ish then, and there will definitely be some other Highlander support cards printed for this xpac. we're theory crafting boys
---
Why is this better than just running King Krush?
---
I am fairly certain the bombs do count. Which is sad really, because these already bad cards are literally countered by one of the strongest decks in standard right now. And it isn’t even hard to do so, it is in bomb warrior’s gameplan to just shuffle as many as you can.
---
I fail to see how hitting face is not an automatic upside
---
Trackability for that solution is bad.
---
So you only need 11 more Malygos
---
Sigh...
---
&gt;Warrior gets that at 4 mana.
---
You mean 5 mana? Dynomatic costs 5
---
&gt;And they usually have rush
---
That is called synergy with other cards. Something that highlander decks also have. They don´t usually have one card and the rest of the deck is "ruined". This is not the only existing highlander card.
---
You also forgot to mention that for 1 more mana, you get a 4/6 instead of a 3/4, you get 5 more damage (10 instead of 5) and it does not hit your own minions. Just a small detail.
---
But Mukla was still a 5/5
---
Wait, the bombs will mess up the Highlander effect? Man fuck that deck
---
Agreed.
---
But then dr boom (minion, the second one) becomes unusable!!
---
He now comes with a scarab thing with is worth 1 mana
---
do we have any precedent on this?
---
$80 doesn't even get you all of the commons

It’s kind if a stretch to call these Meme Decks.
---
Blizzard printed extremely specific class cards this expansion that directly support these archetypes. They are very much intentional deck archetypes. Not being T1/T2 does not make it meme....
---
I have been playing Big Spell Big Hans Hunter aka “Astounding” Hunter , featuring [[Electrowright]], [[Violet Spellsword]], and [[Sunreaver Warmage]]. 
---
It’s a meme deck for sure
---
And maybe it should just draw 5 instead of its current battlecry. But that sounds a little broken so let’s double the cost
---
Thats why you don't preorder before the reveals bois
---
If you're not playing Elise until the combo anyways, you could try running duplicates of combo pieces

That's true, all the people who subscribe to this subreddit and talk regularly about Hearthstone must not give a fuck about game mechanics.
---
&gt;also it could be optional
---
How would that be possible without de-syncing your game from the other player?  You'd still have to wait for all your animations to play out before your opponent starts their turn, it wouldn't make any difference in overall match time unless both players had animations disabled.
---
Also, it would make the game look like shit.  Just because you don't care about aesthetics doesn't mean anyone who does isn't interested in game mechanics.
---
Woooo bomb warrior indirectly buffed!!! :) /s
---
Problem is that giants are in a safespot with no lowrolls in his mana slot, natural nerf have to be: all 10+ crystals critters being in the same slot and introduce one or two lowrolls(bad bodies with a very powerfull battlecrie) on this pool(basic set ofcouse for not being never rotatet out), this will fix conjurer and future similar mechanics
---
As someone who has rocked the Reno flair for years...
---
Blizz, I am disappoint.
---
Again Laughs in bomb warrior.
---
Bad time to release "no duplicate" requirements when the most played deck in the game, Bomb Warrior, destroys them by putting 2+ bombs in their deck so you never get the effect as that is a duplicate.
---
That's a bit too strong at 5 mana. Let's make it 10 mana and just make it draw 5 cards all the time.
---
Goes infinite with floop, barista lynchen, brewmasters.
---
Could provide an incredibly grindy archetype. But without seeing other new cards it probably just spins it’s wheels and dies.
---
This reminds me when Rogue players were teching in Beneath the Grounds against Reno decks in tournaments. Sigh simple and innocent times.
---
Pretty cool stop motion video aNd JaInA hAs TiTs
---
You are right. I usually cringe when I hear Rdu trying so hard to have that american accent. But we are east europeans after all, it's almost impossible to have that accent if you live here. Maybe spending a few years in a west european country or America where you would only speak english could help, idk.
---
True, silly that they printed them while not remembering how popular Bomb Warrior is.
---
Then you can't cast Conjurer's Calling on the minions made from it, which is like the whole point of the Twinspell.
---
If it really needs to be nerfed just make it 4 or 5 mana. Don't see why people make this so complicated.
---
Wow, this is the first card that looks remotely “fun”
---
A druid having 3 cards on turn 5? More like draw 5 man
---
This is so disappointing.
---
Yeah this card is probably fine power-level wise. You put 4 mana worth of stats on the board and clear the board (or get close to it) at the same time. The effect isn't flashy but it seems pretty good especially for a midrange deck.
---
That animation though
---
You all shit talking the card, but I definetly feel it's not weak at all. The old duplicate cards you had to draw so it was the same chance. Yeah it isn't a Reno or a Raza but still solid.
---
Horrible indeed, this sucks.
---
hell yea you do

---
This only feels exciting for Wild. In Standard there's no synergy atm. It's a 2 mana discount, a 2/4, and a mean restriction.
---
Yeah I hoped it would be a neutral. I guess they’re making the saviors all Highlander decks?
---

Meme for RenoMage in wild
---
Why the fuck did you pre-order without seeing the cards? Boomsday, Witchwood, Boomsday. Didn't they teach you?
---
I thought exactly this. I don't see why it can't happen.
---
It might be okay if it was just damage to enemy, but the fact it's minions only possible damage.... Yeah idk about this one 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Well first of all, I did miss the minion bit, still really good in control decks, but I'll admit much worse with that clause. second of all you can still get the effect if you've drawn both brewmasters, but regardless there are in fact 2 brewmasters, (youthful and ancient) and both can be played the same turn as this card.
---
It's a joke, isn't it ?
---
You're probably right, but this is gonna be hella fun in Wild.
---
You know, I completely forgot about nozari, despite me owning nozari and making a point to keep nozari despite me currently having no use for nozari because I enjoy value and control decks
---
You are probably right that its worse, well you are right 6&lt;9 also not healing your opponent is a medium ish benefit, but yeah. Forgot about nozari.
---
God damn it, how wasn't that my first thought.
---
I may have to get one even though I don’t even have my own place yet
---
I wouldn’t say it’s even close to worthless though. No cards to take full advantage of the armor but the hero power by itself was devastating against most aggro-midrange decks. 4 guaranteed health each turn is certainly not worthless
---
https://i.imgur.com/cqF7Px3.gif

FTFY
---
It’s just one of many.
---
Yeah might be decent in wild, even if it's decent it's still underwhelming for Reno Jackson
---
I found this link [http://is2.4chan.org/vg/1563489202963.jpg](http://is2.4chan.org/vg/1563489202963.jpg) and i don't know if it's true but it's suppose to be the discarded versions of the new Reno Jackson card.
---
??? how is it more of a guaranteed board clear the more minions the enemy has? just gives you more health to take down. I really fail to see your logic here. And it's not like mage doesn't have better cards for going face.
---
I mean, existing Reno decks only *really* needed that one extra card to be as successful as they were. Kazakus. Yes, priest ran Raza but do remember seeing Krul in any Renolock deck at the time? The reason Reno decks weren't popular before MSoG is the lack of support. Unless as the end of next year we have a repeat of that era and Blizz releases more OP support cards for us.
---
Why don't deal 30 damage instead, would be true to the flavour
---
I think it’s stronger than people are making it out to be, but not as exciting as I was hoping. I was hoping he would cast a copy of every spell in your deck or something. Or a bunch of 1 mana spells. Something like that.
---
Seems totally reasonable. Works around the bomb hose, doesnt open the door to any insane shenannigans.
---
Im holding out hope that maybe there will be more highlander effects in the set to make it worthwhile, because for these 4 cards, they barely seem worth handicapping your deck for, let alone the bomb factor. Even if thats the case, the deck being hosed by bombs would kill it too quickly, so something needs to change.
---
I think (given the meta) that's gonna be too weak.
---
First, because warrior will mess it up, and then, you can't play token druid/aggro druid with no duplicates, and Lucentbark would lack consistency as well... So that's some kind of control/big druid? 
---
I don't see it working. Unless of course they had insane control druid cards.
---
Missing commas #are not the only problem with that post.

Combos with [[Brann Bronzebeard]]

With so many warriors on ladder I reccomend putting Elysiana in bomb warrior. If you don't manage to kill control warrior with bombs (bad luck, stacking armor) then Elysiana can be a saviour. Some days ago i replaced one dynomatic and brawl with spellbreaker and said Elysiana. (although i dont know if dynomatic is the best card to be thrown out) nevertheless, Elysiana won me some games already, so I just wanted to share my opinion and experience.
---
Neither do I. It seems super simple with little to no consequence.
---
It'll be good in wild, but unless we see a good neutral highlander effect this or the coming update we won't be seeing any reno in standard.

Drawing 2 galvanizers outweighs prenerf ancient of lore

Yep.

Article says there isn't.
---
Yeah I'm getting downvoted, but it's obvious no one on this sub knows what the Wild Meta is like. Bomb Warrior is near non-existent in wild.
---
Yet somehow it was the poster child of its expansion, appearing as the background in the launcher.
---
Wish it said "Enemy Characters" and not "Enemy Minions"
---
Godfrey can actually clear a board though, even through deathrattles. This one, you build your deck around it and it's still way fucking worse than Godfrey. I doubt if they can print enough synergistic stuff for this one to work, for now it sucks hard.
---
A timer is a necessary evil, IMO, otherwise you'd just get people maliciously hanging the game. Imagine how annoying roping is now and magnifying that to an arbitrary degree.

---
What game are *you* playing?!
---
That's a lot of card advantage. Too bad card advantage is irrelevant in a world of Hagatha and Dr. Boom. Heck even the new mage quest provides "infinite" value.
---
The card seems strong in a vaccuum, but it seems like cards like this stopped being relevant in Standard a long time ago (basically with the introduction of Quests and DKs).
---
Basic removal is something like polymorph or shadow word death; this is removal on steroids. It gives you a body with vanilla stats and has mech synergy which is super strong in warrior.
---
Hahaha I remember losing to innkeeper warlock multiples times when i first started playing. If you're new I'd recommend you play an aggro deck that wants to "go face". The thing about board control is (if you're playing aggro) 1 you only want it if you're opponent is also playing aggro and 2 learn to value trade which in short means don't hit a minion if yours will die
---
Question, does it require no duplicates in the deck when played or none at the start.
---
There has been confirmed no other specific highlander support.

I’m a fan of this post. The sarcasm just goes right over some peoples heads so don’t worry if they don’t get it 😂😂
---
Gotta say feels pretty bad to get "Flavorfull" bad class legendaries when the class legendary pool is already halved because of quests.
---
reno mage will play it for sure. its not insane or anything its just a better dynomatic
---
These cards may as well be a bone thrown to the wild community. Maybe they want to push highlander in wild
---
what do you mean aggro/go face

Seems like it. Never thought they'd use legendaries as lack filler cards... Rip

"Well, last time we did highlander with interesting effects it ended up breaking everything, and the time before that. What do we do?"

"Just make it some dumb shit so nobody wants to run it"

and also what about if my opponent is playing “aggro”?

---
I feel like the change to "if your deck started with no duplicates" is a total no-brainer and I will honestly be super dissapointed if they dont change this
---
i think the timer could be better implemented, something like a chess clock or a system where after playing a card you get a little bit more time, it would prevent hanging the game while not being a problem if you have a complex turn
---
momentum+weapon im thinking
---
when the card is played
---
you could even put duplicates in your deck if you're feeling weird
---
it also makes the card a bit less potentially disastrous in arena
---
“Most decks” good one
---
Wheres that witch mercy overwatch copypasta...
---
Use hearthstone deck tracker and hsreplay.net to find out what decks your classic set gets you close to finishing.  Then start dusting bad cards from the rotated set until you can make a few competitive decks.  You're likely to be able to make a few if you had a decent collection in 2015-17.
---
I don't know if the effects enough to make singleton worth it, especially Reno.
---
This card is a lot worse than people are making it out to be, the whole purpose of having an upgarded hero power is so that you build your deck around the strength of that hero power, but randomizing the chances of drawing the card that upgrades your hero power and the chance that you're gonna get the hero power you want all but assures that you can't build your deck around it. 
---
And the fact that it's a 2 mana 2/3 murloc with a powerful affect doesn't mean anything because there's no way any murloc decks are willing to sacrifice the second murloc warleader, tidecaller, or the coldlight seer for this.
---
That's worse. Reno's going to be played in a (highlander) control deck where you'd much rather kill minions vs aggro on turn 6 than deal damage to face. Plus, it's not like mage doesn't have cards to deal damage to face lol
---
I don’t think this guy has ever played as, or against, a hunter.  Midrange and deathrattle hunter were prominent a few months ago.
