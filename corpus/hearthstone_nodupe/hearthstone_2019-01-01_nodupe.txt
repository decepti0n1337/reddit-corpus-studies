Except if you've saved all your dust for a long time to make the deck, that doesn't mean you have a ton of dust lying around for other decks.

Leeroy? One of the best neutral legendaries in the game, played in a Tier 1 deck right now?

This reminds me of this video https://youtu.be/7J9Kc2C_fTU at 8:34
---
You know a nice way to beat someone with a lot of armor? Ignore the armor. Things like otk pally and apm priest do so much damage armor is negligible (one does infinite damage)
---
Giggling was fine.
---
Dr. Morrigan definitely if you must. Cairne as a second choice. (Marin can't be dusted, by the way)
---

---
But unless you don't have ANY decent decks at the moment, you really shouldn't be dusting.
---
Duskbreaker or Deadly Shot?

Any deck that runs a board clear can deal with this on turn 5. Some decks can deal with it on turn 3 and 4. It costs 9 Mana to set up and you effectively do nothing on the two turns you play secrets because Hunter only has one secret-playing minion in standard (masked contender).
---
I understand the frustration of facing the same aggro cards repeatedly during the climb, but this card is strong, not OP. 
---
It is COMPLETELY uninteractive. Play 2 cards on curve and then summon 4 minions on turn 4 is very boring. My suggestion would be for the card to say something about your secrets being triggered while the spellstone is in hand. 
---
Upvoted for playing the superior format 
---
r/custonhearthstone r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Win rate wise it was tier 1, but no one played it anymore after the nerfs. It was pretty much only Midrange Shaman and some control decks that had some kind of fighting chance against it like Control Warrior and Freeze Mage. And while Mid Shaman had some nutty openers that could end the games very fast, it actually had a quite inconsistent early game and had no problem playing the long game. That just happens if your only early game plays are Tunnel Trogg and Totem Golem, you don't draw them every game.
---
Ah true! Didn't think of kobold^^.
---
So did Blizzard.
---
Because Overload is part of the card's effect. No one asks why Soulfire discards a card when Yogg casts it smh

Rexxar, keleseth and Leeroy.

Morrigan op tho
---
I don‚Äôt get it.

[Shirvallahh's Vengeance](https://i.imgur.com/8z0Yje1.png): I think I aimed for Lightchucker value, since this shrine has the most healing cards. Probably got quite lucky with the Boon Reaper to refill my hand. 
---
[Akali's Drum](https://i.imgur.com/JdjHe2f.png): Another Boon Reaper win, but I'm pretty sure the deck could've gone this distance without. I had a pretty heavy curve to spam dragons lategame with the shrine and just aimed for all the removal possible to make it there. 
---
[Kragwa's Lure](https://i.imgur.com/mnuyD7a.png): This one absolutely was pure luck, especially getting past frostfire Mage and Dshield Pally. Luckily got two shrines for double the snowball. I remember the dshield pally game, I had to rely on a lava burst topdeck to combo with electra for 10 dmg lethal. Mage game had to pray he didn't have blizzard on 6. The 1 mana 2/2 teammate is actually quite good because it starts in your hand, so you can snowball with your shrine. Otherwise totem golems and earth eles are your friends. 
---
Final thoughts: It's pretty hard to win via aggro unless you get slow tier 678 decks like priest and druid. Maybe a more reliable strategy is to play slow and then midgame when you've secured position, you use your shrine to snowball for a couple of turns and win. So we'd forsake lowcost minions light Crystalizer or even Totem Golem. This way you don't have to hope the enemy doesn't have removal and hope for a good curve. It works alright with Paladin because Lightchucker is quite good, but Shaman really doesn't have the clear tools, so this strategy won't work as well. 
---
Hmm, OTK Paladin I could definitely see working. APM priest less so because their board is nothing but taunts.

Recently they said they only made contender day play because it‚Äôs less confusing but it is effectively the exact same effect as bellringer sentry, so someone should test whether Sentry does this as well

KARMA
---
Yes I‚Äôm well aware this is easy but as a very casual player who plays quite seldom, this is quite the milestone for me. 
---
It also helps that my favourite class has started doing well recently.
---
Not true at all. I think you're vastly underestimating the ability of zoo to refill board and hand with cheap/discounted/buffed minions using Life Tap. Sure that Hellfire isn't going to win you the game every time, but you absolutely can struggle the board back as zoo and push for lethal with charge minions and spells 
---
I might be wrong but the nerfs came months after ONiK's release so aggro was strong for a while. You're right though, I played midrange shaman quite a bit and it could last into the late game. It had incredible reload and four board clears with the spell damage package. 
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs the issu- oh no...‚Äù
---
You make it to see Zuljin? Impressive
---
Pay attention to the time of day you play in relation to the decks you face(and what are your favourite match-ups). Think odd rogue will do it‚Äôs best on Sunday from 10 Am
---
Once you get like 200+ attack on a boar you kill taunts in an instant. You can easily get through 7 taunts with apm priest by vivid nightmareing a boar that's strong enough already multiple times, if you're fast enough that is.

When I was ranking up around Rank 4, I did go up against a number of Jade Druid players. I believe one of them had Keleseth, while the other was using Darnassus Aspirant as the early game ramp.

Try big spell mage...I love coming up against spell hunters right now haha
---
It really depends. Millhouse against a paladin with 7 cards isn't a great idea, but as an aggro hunter you'd have to push the board when you can
---
Not funny. A real warlock would never turn his Doomguard into gold. Our demons are better plain. Swag is not our code.
---
Awesome! Almost at that golden hero!
---
I nearly did that the other day. I was fucking around with an auto built deck and it sucked. Well some fucker decided to emote spam as he played the most meta cards. I really wanted to tell him to go fuck himself.
---
That‚Äôs my next goal!
---
Dont let your memes be dreams
---
I hated playing against most of those decks! I am loving Deathrattle Hunter, but had a quest for Warlock, so I put together Control because I actually had better legendaries for that than Zoo (?!). It's been really fun! But I'm sure it still sucks to play against.
---
I‚Äôve been playing deathrattle warlock and it‚Äôs been over powering my hunter opponents. The real decision is whether or not to go keleseth or not considering most of warlock good tech cards are 2 mana.
---
They always have it on turn 5 too
---
[By the Elements Combined!](http://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone)
---
The chance of that happening when you have an empty board against a 4 3/3 on turn 5 is extremely low and the idea of wrestling that board control again by giving the hunter tempo just sounds terrible to me. You clear his 12/12 board, he plays to my side,... It's just a lot of stalling until he gets to his value cards (zuljin, rhokdelar,...). The problem here is that the current zoolock (heal zoo) can't match that kind of values and it needs to resolve to being an aggro deck that shuts its opponent down before they can get "there". 
---
If he is below 15hp by turn 5 then sure you can try to wait for your winning cards but it's a spell hunter and that hardly happens. Not to mention, hellfire really hurts other aggro match ups like odd rogue by being a dead card but that's not what we're talking about here.
---
That is unless you're the one using the spell. Then it hits the 1/1.

There wasn't a whistle-blower from the team, just an inadvertent self-incrimination. I think the claim that Tom and the 4th guy (Reall) were innocent is based on (I'm not totally sure about this) two members of the team (Roger and Shaxy) being together in person, while the other two were just on the phone with them, while they all conferred together about what moves to make in the game. 
---
I think that if Tom and Reall weren't aware at the start that Roger and Shaxy were watching the stream, they would very likely have become aware over the course of the team's games that day. 
---
You don‚Äôt even need 200, just 16-64

I mainly play odd warrior, pirate rogue, secret pally, and secret hunter (when I get mad at how many other secret hunters I face)

Every deck but my secret hunty runs Chief now. 2/3 opponents I face are secret hunters.

Cube Hunter, Cube Paladin,Cubelock and taunt druid completely demolish the deck. So do the Mecha'thun decks, Quest Mage and Exodia Paladin. Even Paladin, Odd Paladin, Even Shaman, Cloning Gallery Priest,  also have favorable matchups against it.

in value shudderwock shaman its a safe craft cause you wont be getting dem shudderwocks again in hand so might as well destroy the board while getting 6/6 on board and possibly some value

It probably gave your opponent pause when they saw what they're up against. 
---
I feel I have unfavored matchup against it with Mechathun Priest, it kills me before I get it down :/

Deathwing is a good last resort card for discolock  and wild dragon priest. Otherwise it‚Äôs just fun to show off in arena

If you saved all your money for deathrattle hunter, then youve had a long time to save up again. Youve also had a deck thats one of the top ranked ones in ladder so your ability to make coins exists. everything else is just an excuse.
---
Ashmore‚Äôs good in rush warrior.
---
His memes are weak, creativity is heavy, coming up with new stuff not possibly.
---
According to Hsreplay.net, it's the strongest deck against Odd Quest Warrior, with the matchup being nearly 80% in priest's favor.
---
Hard Mulligan for Hemet and draw. Never keep combo cards in your mulligan. You should be able to do your combo long before he can kill you. Don't worry too much about what they're doing and focus on pulling off the combo asap. Pre-Quest completion, they can't ever pressure you down fast enough.
---
This is the ideal Warrior gameplay. You might not like it but this is what peak performance looks like.
---
The only consistency you can expect in Hearthstone is inconsistency.

Insulting someone for being bad at referential humor is actually a bit of a compliment.

Interestingly enough it would have taken the same exact amount of mortal strikes. The enemy had 36 health, so it would have taken 9 non-triggered mortal strikes to kill. It would take 3 strikes to take the hero down to 11 and and trigger the card and it would take 6 to kill at that point, so 9 in total! Pretty interesting!

Also leokk gives it plus 4, not just plus 1

Statistics are statistics, if it loses often it shouldn't have as high a win rate as it does.

It is somewhat artificially boosted by being played in lower ranks against easier decks but it performs well against the hunter influx and the odd quest warrior that's being run to counter hunter and exodia paladin too.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Purity of the Cards. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the history of card games most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Kripp's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Donald Watson literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Purity of the Cards truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Kripp's existential catchphrase "he needed that EXACT card," which itself is a cryptic reference to Dostoyevsky's Russian epic The Brothers Karamazov. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as BruceWillakers' genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Purity of the Cards tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

He can attack with mechathun 9 times doing a total of 90 damage, the warrior will take 36 from fatigue just armoring up should be enough to survive but you can throw some minions to force trades.

The sad thing is that there are Zombeasts that beat this board, easily. Mainly Bloatbat + Poisonous but Cave Hydra + Rush Spider can also do the trick and you have a lot of time at 65 health to get it. Deathstalker is a hell of a card.
---
All decks are 'RNG' heavy. Card shuffling is random. Many matches are decided by draw order. Control mage is especially egregious because whether or not you draw Jaina decides so much of the game.

It's a game about manipulating probability and if you get mad about non-deterministic results instead of learning to understand and control things like variance you're gonna have a bad time.

They feel the OTK deck is playing solitaire because they built a deck of 28 answers a lich king and a death knight. The game feels mindless because they play a deck that only has plays if the opponent lays a threat down and passes the turn. 
---
So to a hard control player with no threats and no intuition on how to beat, it feels like solitaire. 
---
Not sure if you're being serious or not, but FYI it doesn't work that way.
---
Each Mogor the Ogre's 50% chance to hit the wrong target is a separate event. It's possible for an attack to be redirected multiple times if multiple Mogor the Ogre's and other redirecting minions are on the board.

I said from the day it was revealed that Dire Mole would be a staple one drop. It‚Äôs not a flashy card with a powerful effect. It‚Äôs just a good card. 1 mana 1/3s will always see play, so long as they don‚Äôt have a negative effect attached to them (I‚Äôm looking at you, Animated Berserker). 
---
Legendary Secret: If you lose more then half your max health in one turn reverse the damage and end your opponents turn.
---
Most likely not balanced at all so maybe add it to a battlecry add this secret to your hand.
---
It avoided the spotlight for so long, but it always felt like one of the few cards that deserved a 1 mana nerf.   On one end, you had OTK 
---
 deck making late game irrelevant, but on the other end, there was Fungalmancer and Level Up plaguing early game with snowballing aggro/midrange. 
---
I'm glad it's going to leave soon. 
---
I would have timed out out at 4 health and then my opponent would spam well played 10 times before roping down and killing me
---
/r/Whooosh
---
Face is the Place!
---
I initially made this a battlecry minion with a new ability called Reactive, which would allow you to play it in response to a certain action, but i just made it a neutral spell instead.
---
I‚Äôve had portable forge in dungeon run into runespear into the 6 mana summon a 5/5 copy of a minion in deck into Marin into golden kobold into justicars truehart. All of those were golden so I got a golden hero power ü§ó

---

Yes
---
Except a) I don't get gold playing the innkeeper and b) regardless of whether or not I'm able to socialize with them, I still get the pleasure of knowing they lost to me.
---
I lost time by ranting? The childish responses on this subreddit never cease to amaze me. If you have a problem with my opinion, that is one thing, but to lead in with a jab is pathetic. Grow up.

*ABANDON POST THIS IS NOT A DRILL*
---
The cat appears to be attacking a stealthed minion or something.
---
Alternate timeline: I just find it dumb that it's designed to counter spells, yet a spell can destroy it.
---
I mostly play zoolock and I‚Äôm hovering around 16-18. I run Dire Mole. What should I replace it with?
---
I mean, the reason is that the Deathrattle guy is still a minion on board, Jade Blossom still summons a jade golem and Nourish still lets you draw 3 cards. Wild Growth does none of those. The problem card here is the shaman murloc fetch card that does nothing if you are out of murlocs going against their "dead cards in hand" principle.
---
nah. just get some other card that you say "gee i wish a had space for one more of this card" in your deck. another tech card, extra board clear, extra draw, extra value card... whatever you think you need.
---
Having some fun with tesspionage rogue but it‚Äôs not always as strong as some of the mentioned meta decks
---
Or how about it upgrades when the secret is activated. So now the opponent can actually play around it. 
---
So much cooler.

[hunter's mark]
---
Hunters seem much more rare on ladder than a few days ago, to me.
---
Jokes on you I actually play hunter counters unlike most of the people who endlessly verse them with decks that don't perform well against them and then complain about losing.
---
Lol i forgot ripper was a Demon. Maybelline Blizzard tought about this
---
No one would play an Ante mode.
---
Magic the Gathering was originally designed around anteing cards, but when it became clear players hated the idea and just ignored it, they stopped making cards involving it and banned every card relating to it in competitive play.
---
The issue is that the majority of players entering into games in that mode will end up poorer overall while most of the spoils will go to this game's equivalent of pool sharks. The fact that disconnects count as loses wouldn't help it either.
---
Players will enter it with hopes of expanding their collection, put up a legendary card or two, and will end up leaving once those cards had been lost.
---
Congrats!
---
N‚ÄôZoth Mill Rogue in Wild is one of the most fun deathrattle decks!
---
Like the game
---
Warbot was played in niche mech aggro warrior back in the days. The card is good because it can trade well with Shielded Minibot. But the card did not took off because Control Warrior during GvG was so much stronger, and hunter was the goto aggro deck
---
This little bastard got me my first 2 Legend runs when it came out a year ago and it was still slept on :) Good times!
---
ockman#2297 trading 80g quest EU, you go first, i can show first
---
I'm pretty sure there's no lethal, but there's an 11 mama lethal that i found it that matters
---
* The 2/1 hits into the 2/6 moshogg enforcer
---
* 2/6 swift messenger (4 mana) hits into the 2/4 moshogg enforcer
---
* drain life (7 mana) on the 3/5 tar creeper
---
* fallen sun cleric (9 mana) onto the now 2/4 swift messenger
---
* defile (11 mana) hitting for 3 (1 hp from cleric, 2 hp from moshogg enforcer, 3 hp from the tar creeper, but no 4 hp), allowing godfrey to hit face
---
The best play though was probably to clear the board with as many minions alive as possible
---
* depending on what's in your deck (for example, if you have a spring rocket, fire plume phoenix, or hellfire in your deck for more burn) you should tap first in case it gives you lethal. If you have no burn, then save the 2 mana for developing a fallen sun cleric for your dragonmaw scorcher in the off chance it gets to go face and you can win with drain life
---
* 4/5 godfrey hits into 2/6 moshogg enforcer
---
* defile, leaving up just three 4/1 omega agents and a 3/1 tar creeper
---
* dragonmaw scorcher to clear the board

You aren't even following what we're talking about, and pretend to be a legend player. Your freeze mage ran missiles and shot them on turn 1?!? Nice, i'm sure you've been number 1 legend many times.
---
What the hell is wrong with you

No I just killed
---
One of my absolute favorite cards. The art is awesome. (Such a cool turtle and the green is very relaxing.) Discover is a cool mechanic. I also love how he says "Go away!" when attacking.
---
Druid's finally gone! But wait... there on the horizon! Another class used more than any of the others?! Dear God, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN US?!?!?!?!?!?
---
One of my absolute favorite cards. The art is awesome. (Cool turtle and the green is relaxing.) Discover is a cool mechanic. (Though both high and low rolls can suck.) I also love how he says "Go away!" when attacking.
---
Well I'll just say this, this is my only wild deck and those tiny fin might as well be my children
---
Damn casuals smh
---
Oh and the Tiny Fin are golden
---
Class distribution is a pointless stat. Hunter has been dead since Grand Tournament. People are having fun playing it for once. 
---
Win rate is the only important stat, here. That's the problem, not play rate.
---
Search up heartharena
---
Trade quest NA Melon#12368
---
I always found the following related question interesting: For each mana cost, how high stats does a vanilla-card need to see play in constructed? Since dire mole is pretty much the only existing card that sees play, the answer might be something like 1/3 for 1, 3/3 for 2 mana, 4/4 for 3, ...
---
Don't look at classes, look at decks. Hunter sees so much play because there's 4 strong and completely different decks.
---
I tech‚Äôd in the quest, make a dude each turn, but I‚Äôm pressing that button for 8 damage every turn. Works so well, especially against secret/spell hunter, I just end up never attacking face with my taunts, and using the hero power to hit face. 
---
Fun fact is the last card printed with no text!
---
Wow! you mean you‚Äôre not getting deleted before DK Rexxar comes into play. Teach me!
---
I‚Äôd call for make wandering monsters summon a 2 drop rather than a 3 drop. That secret is really infuriating to play agaisnt since you‚Äôre basically cheating 1 mana
---
People also forget a lot of Hu ter decks are pretty cheap to make when comparing to other good classes right now like shaman
---
Only at certain ranks.
---
My bad, maybe at your rank Even Shaman isn‚Äôt very popular.
---
Not in the long run, really.
---
You should have *something* decent to keep you occupied until rotation, but it's good to have some dust on hand when they move cards to the Hall of Fame around rotation. That way you can earn a profit off the refund.
---
Maybe try out one of the super cheap Midrange Hunter lists. Some are reporting really high win rates with lists that cost less than a thousand dust.
---
Aren't those 3 arch enemies in the real warcraft lore?
---
Me: *Plays OTK Shirvallah paladin* 
---
Lich King: *Army or Doom Pact* 
---
Nice if you have the combo in hand, otherwise... well...
---
In MSoG, Midrange Shaman did get stronger with the Jade Package and was one of the best decks, though I agree with you that with the rise of Reno decks and Pirate Warrior, Shamanstone ended at Karazhan's end.
---
I agree with the idea, but winrate doesn't tell you that much. Intuitive decks will always be overrated. E.g. Exodia Pally is bonkers, but its winrate  is very unimpressive. Turns out people are keeping Loot Hoarders in their opening hand.
---
What else are people supposed to do with their 55% winrate deck only works 40% of the time? Blame themselves? LUL
---
It just proves that those players that stopped playing Druid and switched to Hunter are scum.
---
That's why you should draft 29 wisps and 1 trickster.
---
This card only help to illustrate how broken Mana Wyrm always was.
---
On an unrelated note, we might see much less text on cards now that Blizzard is trying to implement a company-wide cost cutting program. 
---
That was mostly because the druid deck shell could facilitate just about any win condition you could think of. However, I do think they went a bit far with the nerfs. 
---
would make the secret really really bad and unplayed.
---
Yes, when I mentioned quest priest farmers all aggro decks, especially hunter I got heavily downvoted a week ago ü§£
---
A small note on frost lich Jains btw. ShE is strong and I crafted her for that reason, but after a few games she gets kinda boring because the games just get so samey after u play her. Compare this to rexxar e.g where each game, infact each time you hero power, it‚Äôs different. I think blizzard noticed this, which is why the new hero cards (hagatha, boom, zuljinn) do different things each time vs same exact thing each game. 
---
It's 4K  relax
---
I don't mind at all actually, none of the Hunter decks are upsetting to play against and you can play a wide variety of classes and still compete. I'd be interested to see winrates as well because nothing seemed to OP over the last week, cubelock was the biggest problem imo
---
That didn't stop the last round
---
Im f2p and I despise hunter decks every game
---
Rogue/Warlock decks are dirt cheap too, theres no reason for me to be against a hunter almost every match, and its not fun at all going against deathrattle hunter for the 20th time today...
---
I just wish that the spellstones weren't quite so easy to charge up. 
---
More plausible to be a combination of both viability and low budget.
---
Anyways, I really hope it's new found viability doesn't get it nerfed to hell because I'm a F2P player and Hunter is my go to.
---
Humm I do lack the dust for something that will rotate out soon.Thanks for the suggestion! I'll consider it. 
---
Same thing happened with Druid and the class got gutted. 
---
Yeah but I believe that (at least leeroy) holds the position of top card in many Hearthstone fans, due to all the changes, background and power
---
Shh this is literally hearthstones biggest secret. Don‚Äôt give it away. 
---
As someone who is painfully grinding out a golden Druid with Spiteful Summoner, can I just beg for a little mercy? Druid has been beaten up enough.

---
Yeah but it's like saying that antonidas is not healthy because you can OTK with it, or that allie is not healthy because its a control killer/saver, etch etch. Every card is strong is one mechanic is used with it, moreover I don't think that in the classic set there is any card that cheats out minions so technically maly is not the problem 
---
&gt; what are the auto win matchups for you?
---
all of them
---
But seriously I think the more productive question is "What are the auto lose match-ups" because you can win any match up as long as you know what you're doing, and you can lose any match up if you make a bad decision or have bad draws. The only time you really super lose hard is against aggro decks that draw their answers to your big taunt minions early on.
---
&gt;and rouhgly how do you do vs aggro(-ish) decks in terms of win%?
---
i don't keep track of winrates, i either enjoy a deck or i don't.
---
I felt like deckhand deserved a spot probably mostly because I played too much rogue around release, and the fact that it's a one mana charger is really powerful when going for quick kills.  Given how the game has changed, it probably has fallen quite a few ranks and I'm looking at it with rose tinted glasses.
---
Dude, I'm a whale and I'm perfectly happy that this is a casual game. People who want complexity can go play Gwent or Artifact as far as I'm concerned. Let Hearthstone be Hearthstone. 
---
I'm also F2P, started out as a hunter and stuck to it, been around since Witchwood.
---
What I intended to say was there's more budget decks for Hunter than any other class, to my knowledge, not that other classes don't have low cost decks. I'm happy it's a pretty good class now but I too hate that the ladder is infested with it.
---
My recommendation is odd paladin, I DESTROY most hunters I face. The fastest I‚Äôve ever beat a spell hunter is turn 3 lol.
---
True enough. Ive played this deck for ages and its my main deck... sad to see it go since im not so sure about playing it in wild.
---
did he hex a twilight drake, a 6/6 deamon, and genn?
---
Which should be the point of a secret over a regular spell. Secrecy vs a change for the opponent to play around it.
---
pretty sure this guy is trolling in his other posts he mentions he has many legendaries and always buys a minimum of 50 packs per expansion. he just wanted to make people cry about the penguins.
---
I mean for hunters specifically. Undertaker was a card
---
I prefer RR to the otehr solo content. it's the only one i have anywhere near a 50% chance of loseing
---
I got so tired of losing to every hunter that I stopped playing ranked...just haven't had time to look up counters. Is the class op or is there just so many good decks for them?
---
I agree with you but this sub does not-Winrate was not important a month ago when everyone had pitchforks out for Druid. 
---
He is missing 1281 wins there
---
Ye we do, ppl stil play druid? Wtf?
---
April
---
I play hunter because Deathstalker and Zul'jin are my favorite cards in the game. I don't even care about the power level, i just have alot of fun with them!
---
Well spell hunter is one of the enjoyable decks to play. Against aggro you are playing control and against control you are playing aggro.
---
Glad to see my priest brothers rising up to face the menace!
---
Some of us remember undertaker hunter.
---
That's exactly what he said, four thirds. 
---
I think you‚Äôre overestimating my capabilities good sir. 
---
Doubtful.
---
Druid was annoying because you couldn't tell what deck they were playing. They all ran Wild Growth, Nourish, Branching Path, UI, Spellstone, Swipe, Naturalize. So often it'd be turn 6 or later and you didn't know if it was Malygos, Towaggle, Token or Taunt.
---
It's odd that Blizzard is pushing certain decks harder than others for years on end. There isn't really any reason Blizzard has to make so many control cards rare, epic and legend. They just prefer to make cards with complex mechanisms expensive, and this mechanisms are often of a controlling nature.
---
Zul'Jin is not a death knight, it is a hero card. Death knights are exclusive to KOFT.
---
I've been on and off in hearthstone since naxxramas, haven't played since witchwood. Has the game really changed that much??
---
sounds about right. Priest is about the only class that can handle a huge board so easily, runner up being mage 
---
Welp. I read it as 3-4.
---
Yup, secret hunter can‚Äôt beat control combo decks 9/10 times 
---
Main counter is priest, just because of Meddlesome insects and Scream. You scream and suddenly this mongrel has minions in his deck.
---
Stonehill will be my most missed card come rotation
---
There's quite too many OTK decks at the moment unforunately. 
---
don't remid me, dark ages of hearthstone
---
No ozruk played in comments= downvote 
---
Have you considered that DR hunter beats your odd mage because it's a completely different style of deck that is good against decks that aim to board clear after board clear, as opposed to the other hunters which are more small minion board flood?
---
There isn‚Äôt a problem. Hunter decks are not extremely OP like Druid was. The rotation happens next expansion. Just wait
---
Small indie company
---
Well, sort of, ziplock with the help of witch doctor and happy ghoul has managed to make the perfect turn 2 board as follows :
---
Turn one - flame imp (3/2, deal 3 damage to whoever played it)
---
Turn two - witch doctor (1) (Restore 2 health) into double happy ghouls (3/3, if you hero has gained health this turn cost 0) and then another 1 cost minion
---
 How about decrease the number of wolfs summoned by 1? 
---
Tempo midrange Hunter is cheap 960 dust and 57% winrate according to HSReplay

---
How did it work originally
---
I'll admit to loving odd paladin, but also believing it deserved the nerf. The deck was too damn strong, and easily has the potential to become broken again. (Basically a good board buffs away.)
---
DK Rexxar is not great in wild. It is extremely slow. Plenty - and I meant PLENTY - of wild decks are significantly stronger than it.
---
DK Rexxar is just a card that can powerfully shift the paradigm of the game. That flexibility is incredibly powerful for just 1 card, but the effect itself isn't amazing. It does not need a nerf. It didn't until the rest of hunter got very powerful, and it won't when it rotates.
---
Not if you get bad draws. If you draw your ultimate infestation at the end then you‚Äôll fatigue hard and not have enough turns to pull it off. 
---
you dont do that because of a possible high roll you do that to push back dealing with the minion. Being able to delay the minions arrival so that you can hold the board and snowball with cards like fungalmancer is actually detrimental to the power of the secret. In some cases it makes the card better since you might misjudge and swinging is actually correct, or the threat of it may cause you to play around the wrong secret but overall the detrimental effect of the activation effect outweighs the beneits imo. That said it is a pseudo taunt since it soaks one hit to face which is honestly what makes the card viable since hunter lacks healing and armor gain against aggro so it both gives a slightly above curve minion and soaks a bit of damage in the aggro matchup to help stow the early damage.

But Rogue has a lot of burst and an overall better curve and removal. Rush Warrior doesn't.
---
No one's posted mine:
---
Spellstone taunt  
---
Hit face (7)  
---
Hellfire for 8
---
Well Highmane also sees less play because it lacks taunt or charge/rush. So it's the worst roll with kathreena. Obviously not in spell hunter either. 
---
IMO it's not odd at all. The game is about minion interaction and whoever gets the board advantage usually wins the game.  Making good common minions will have way more impact than making good spells for control decks. Aggro/midrange just happen to he the best combat oriented strategies.
---
I feel the reason Hunter is disliked by everyone who doesn't play it right now is it isnt fun to play against. You know they are gonna play dk and have infinite buffed as hell minions that no control deck can stop. For me this is the same for most dk's. I have more fun playing the old infinite shudderwock decks than dk's. 
---
What do you mean have dust on hand for the hall of fame cards?
---
If you didn't say lethal I would've forgotten about the spellstone and took a draw
---
Then how would you nerf it, if it's so problematic? Saying it's "terribly designed" just because it's cheaper than it should be makes no sense so clearly the problem must be with the Hero Power. Nerfing the Hero Power doesn't stop you from combining beasts together and generating more value.
---
So what do you want to do, then? What's your grand solution?
---
Besides, Shaman Midrange was  top tier at the time and they ran Doomhammer. Having druid hp had synergy with the windfury. 
---
The meta was diverse but it was also largely the same one we'd had for 9 months. Sets coming out and the game not changing AT ALL is not fun and there's literally no reason to buy packs. 
---
You can see it in the massive drop in twitch views, the exodus of many content creators and a general malaise around the game. It just needs more mix ups to be interesting, they should honestly have a hard-set nerf/buff cycle once per season to keep interest up.
---
I wonder how much better the game would be if everyone had all the cards
---
I ended my climb at rank 1 5 stars, with the season resetting right before I could queue my next game feelsbadman 
---
Good job on legend!

The amount of whiney salt kids in this sub is too damn high..I can't be the only one who thinks that playing against hunters is less frustrating then playing against every turn board clear Priests with 150 health, infinite Armor and taunt Warriors or any sort of 1tko decks. At least you can easily counter secrets or play around it but the majority of this sub seems to be retarded af.
---
Y‚Äôall have no shame
---
If they were to nerf hunter now like druid, essentially removing it from the current meta, would some other class suddenly be the problem?
---
No. he say he can only win agains combo deck with limited damage and he feels like odd warrior without quest dont have a end game plan, plus i not even answer the main post i answer a coment about how win the fatige. So chill and pay attention before talk shit dude
---
Yep I've been playing filthy Spell Hunter since I luckily unpacked a ZJ, but don't worry I'm a bad player with a low rank, around 17
---
Unmm I haven't played in a Year... can't believe that priest is being playeable and no one is using shaman haha
---
Damn that stinks. You'll get it this month!
---
Something to consider here is that you just suggested two legendaries, and that's expensive for a lot of players.
---

Yeah, that's a ridiculously good matchup - I was literally undefeated vs spell/secret hunter as OTK paladin last month, and of the 40ish games vs hunter about 70% of them were spell/secret.

Hunter is just fucking bad when you lose vs them, gosh darnit!

Spiteful druid doesnt run ramp cards u fkn noob

You mean like chain gang?

How to counter hunter: A modicum of control, unless in a mirror match you should always be able to outdraw them in the very least.
---
Every class can clear 4 3/3s on turn 5 , Rogue having the most difficult time. 
---
How to counter Druid: Russian Roulette with 4 bullets. (Malygos Taunt Token and Other Druid deck. I didn't run into Mechac'thun decks).
---
This I agree with. One of the problems with the game staying fresh is their incomprehensible refusal to make bad cards better, knowing that the mechanics they hold would be interesting if even just the mana value was fixed.
---
Hell, you make Silverback Patriarch cost 2 and it might even be useful.
---
That Jan'alai is beautiful
---
But the soul of the cards are still there of course! 
---
I hit legend in standard this season with murloc warrior. Murlocs really can put in the work.
---
It's not hex and polymorph that are undercosted though, it's assassinate that's overcosted/a bad card. 
---
Most of the cards never or rarely see any play in HS, you can't balanced those that do with these. 
---
Assassinate kills a minion for 5 mana... The priests has 2 and 3 mana spells that do the same, and they often don't even run them.
---
Sure one targets small minions and one big minions, and they have that 4 attack problem... But not having these flaws doesn't justify costing 2 and 3 more mana than spells that aren't even played at the moment.
---
Hell, Assassinate isn't even played right now despite the main rogue archetype being odd rogue, which means half the cards aren't available... and it STILL doesn't make the cut.
---
It's comparing hex to a horrible card.
---
Unintentional, but don't worry this filthy Spell Hunter deserves his lowly rank of 17 :(
---
it is bad when its this extreme tho
---
Ugh I wish we still had cheap good decks. Now aggro decks need several legendaries too, and the game is more expensive.
---
One class is always going to be on top. Sometimes it might be close between a few top classes but one is always going to be better. I don't think hunter has been on top since I started in GVG. Maybe it's just their time in the sun...
---
No, it is incorrect without the "not".
---
Rush Warrior is a bad deck. You might as well call Basic Priest the biggest victim of the metagame, if you're going to pick a deck that was never/will never be good and call it the biggest loser of the meta. 
---
Very true, Mid Range, Secret , and even Spell are pretty cheap compared to everything else. Mid Range is like 2k dust and can easily get newer players to rank 15-10 
---
Yes it does, you can run a one of of [[Reckless Experimenter]]
---
Rush Warrior was somewhat good before the nerfs, basic priest wasn't.
---
Thank you. Having to play against 4 turns of annoying hunter secrets, followed up by an on-curve 5 mana 12/12, A 5 mana 4/4 draw 5 cards when they run out of steam, then an infinite value hero power, all to still lose because of a swing 10 mana card at the end is getting really annoying at this point.

5/4/6 | Deathrattle minions you play cost (3) less, but die at the end of the turn.  
---
use your brain Even Shaman
---
While it's not too hard to counter the decks overall, Rexxar (and the other infinite value DKs) are pretty oppressive by nature and very often shut down a lot of would-be counters single-handedly. The decks are fun, the cards are fun, but they don't always make for the healthiest or most fun ladder experience in my experience. 
---
it needs max 1 legenday, if you want you could use cube but you dont need to
---
Right, there's a big difference between all the druids playing the same way for the first 6 turns because the first 20 cards were the same and hunters having 6-10 cards the same and playing a *little* similarly in that they have a couple of the same strong spells (naturally) and Rexxar.
---
... yep
---
It has three good decks that don't cost a lot of money to play which are also generally-agreed to be more fun than most cheap decks like zoo or odd paladin. 
---
It also has a very strong expensive deck which is anti-control.
---
Hunter was the 2nd or 3rd best class and then they nerfed everything above it. It's not any stronger, its winrate didn't soar, it just happened to be the best thing that wasn't strong enough to nerf.
---
Also--the meta shift strongly disfavored zoolock for some reason. So you can look at metastats and see that a bunch of zoolock players switched to hunter.
---
Long story short, instead of odd pally/zoolock we have two varieties of hunter for the cheap pleb decks that get over-represented on ladder. And then the 'best' hunter deck is more like 10% of the meta and mostly sees play at Legend.
---
Yeah and it is going to lose alot of their most powerful stuff next rotation, they will just be on top for 2-3 months
---
Just start adding random people you play with. And make friends. 
---
That's how I'm at 200 friends (max on bnet) and never have issues spectating. I also often get 80g quests without them asking for trades etc. Similarly I just challenge anyone whose online for the 80g  and always let them spectate me for quests. 
---
Sure. You will receive a lot of hate messages. But past all the shit. You do get to make some really decent friends. 
---
UNPOPULAR OPINION: actually a pretty normal opinion
---
&gt; Hunter is just fucking bad when you lose vs them, gosh darnit!
---
Yeah, that's fair, some classes certainly feel worse to lose against than others.
---
You forgot the biggest of them all, Fiery War Axe
---
You should be fairly sure, it's not too complex of a interaction :P
---
Another good thing is that hunter has some notable counters that do quite well against it.  Although for newer players those decks are generally rather expensive.
---
Hm, okay
---
OTK Paladin player here, Zihi is the only viable counter. Most of my games I get to win due to [[Time Out!]] and very low hp.: getting Zihi‚Äôd crushes any win chance

---
Yet again confirmation that even shaman players are brainless lol
---
Deck distribution should be a more important statistic than class distribution. Yes, hunter dominates the mega in terms of popularity, but it‚Äôs also the only class to have 5 viable archetypes (spell, secret, Deathrattle, midrange, and odd). Meanwhile, the second most popular class has only two/three viable archetypes (control, cloning gallery, and APM?). The different play styles of Deathrattle Hunter vs Spell hunter vs Midrange hunter really means that hunter is 3 classes in one, with the only common threads being DK Rexxar. Compare this to Druid, which during their dominance played practically the same deck, with a few differences in win conditions. 
---
Looking at deck distribution, the meta is actually really healthy, with many different types of archetypes seeing play. The only real complaint is that the meta is pretty polarized (due to odd warrior), and the meta is stale, using almost no new decks
---
I don‚Äôt mind one class being best.  That‚Äôs always gonna be a thing.  My problem is that they are really annoying to play against.  So many games come down to ‚Äúdid they get their Rexxar early‚Äù and/or ‚Äúdid he get a charged spell stone‚Äù, and it really sucks because it just feels like games are either unwinable or unloseable.  
---
That‚Äôs honestly been my complaint for a long time in hearthstone.  The best decks are the best because they excel at something you can‚Äôt interact with.  Druid‚Äôs mana ramp, (mostly) Druid‚Äôs jade ramping, Warlock and Druid activating deathrattles the turn they are played in either Cubelock or Recruit Hunter, building an OTK Shudderwok, Patron Warrior, and now spell Hunter.  All these top decks had one thing in common.  None of them allow you to interact with their win condition on the board.  It moves the game away from plays and counter plays and towards rushing a win condition.  The fact is that Hunter is now the best at winning by playing secrets before you can destroy them, then generating infinite value and swinging back practically any board with heroes is about the closest we‚Äôve had to a ‚Äúfair‚Äù OP deck, but you still can‚Äôt counter Rexxar generating either tons of stats or tons of utility.  You still can‚Äôt counter charging Zul‚Äôjin.  
---
And I think that‚Äôs why most people who are angry, are angry.  It‚Äôs Hunter now, but it‚Äôs functionally very similar to Druid.  You build up a win condition that really can‚Äôt be interacted with, then you win.  Druid did it by ramping and stalling with SP, Hunter does it with secrets and stat dumps and then either pulling out zombeasts or big charge minions.  It looks different, but it feels the same.  You are only playing to see if they got ‚Äòthe combo‚Äô or if you got yours.
---
well it was very strong in wild, maybe they changed it because of that, although they rarely nerf/change cards/decks that are good in wild, although they did that with naga see witch and aviana combo decks.

there is also this part

&gt; For November‚Äôs report, we talked to 11 current and former Blizzard employees. Since then, we‚Äôve heard from even more current and former Blizzard staff about the company‚Äôs cost-cutting measures and how they‚Äôve materialized. The Career Crossroads program is one example. Another, according to three Blizzard staff who all left recently, is a power shift that has seen the finance department cultivate influence that it had never had in the past.

---
The games I‚Äôve lost as an evenlock in that matchup were usually because I got burned down by crackle through my taunts, or very occasionally when they focused their burn on my giants and successfully removed them before dying where we both ended up out of steam, stuck in top decks because I was too low to tap anymore.
---
I mean anyone who plays priest is a degenerate so it is deserved. 
---
I think that's a lot easier said than done. Such a minion or spell would have to pull its weight in matchups where the ability was irrelevant, and I imagine that window is tiny if it even exists at all.
---
best zoo deck back in the day was warlock with the highest rarity card were a simple blue gem card called doomguard which is still exactly the same card.  
---
ofc you could tweak that deck with legendaries like leeroy and similar but overall the rarety of the cards was very low and it was still good.  
---
aggro deck are and always will be popular in ranked caus most people don't want to waste 15 minutes for a win if they can get 2 wins and a loss in the same amount of time.  
---
especially when its control vs control you sometimes had matches that alone went almost 1 hour and people want to climb fast.
---
I am not even on the Hunter page:

---
None of those see any constructed play either, so it doesn't matter.
---
Copying your opponents win condition is pretty cool.
---
There's always going to be a best deck/class unless we're in a rock paper scissors format and those formats blow.
---
im happy to see druid last.
---
A 3 mana 3/4 would be enough. 
---
Kinda like the C'Thun minions or the crab from Un'goro. Good enough stats to be playable, but small enough that it's not oppressive. 
---
You don‚Äôt know if the person is running explosive trap or freezing trap, they‚Äôre secrets. Some hunters are starting to run snipe to counter certain combo decks, this can be really helpful for cube locks or other deathrattle decks if they anticipate it. Here‚Äôs another example, you‚Äôre even lock, hunter just played spell stone and has 1 secret in play (1 wandering monster has been played), you got a vulgar homunculus on board and hell fire in hand. Does the vulgar go into the minion to play around snake trap and venom trap or face to play around wandering monster. Or does he not attack at all to have a 2/1 taunt against a possible huffer. It these decisions that can determine if you win or not.
---
I only hate the t1 pass, t2 t3 secret, t4 coin spellstone scenarios. Also topdecking Deathstalker Rexxar is pretty sick.
---
This looks like a really fun list and a good way to utilize the Voone I just unpacked. Thanks!
---
New players should never be worrying about best and worst classes. 
---
At those ranks, all classes are viable

It's so ~~odd~~ weird to see those two new player cards in a meta deck.

 mieszko#2498 EU 80g quest - I'll show, you go first. 
---
I think hunter might be strong because it can summon 12/12 worth of stats with 5 mana and if opponents cant deal with it you auto win. 
---
When I play against hunter(so almost everygame) I have to mulligan cards I want to keep in my opening hand just to find an answer to spell stones and to my side.
---
Hunter matchups are frustrating because if you cant answer all of their spellstones and to my side you auto lose
---
Murloc tribal synergy is insane. The only problem is that such strategies cannot recover very well after a 5+ mana aoe removals are playable.
---
hunterstone is real
---
Geist is still good against hunter
---
Token is probably best bet, something like this:

---
It's pre-nerf tho, so might want to swap wild growth / nourish, or at least not run doubles of both
---
You can look up what the odds and possible outcomes are. Burning always does that.
---
Praying to roll the spell power totem because it gives exact lethal has been a common strategy for me against this and many other decks.
---
I remember those groups back in the day, I wasnt so lucky to be in progress back in the day. I ran with a small guild which could barely handle 10man content. We sucked but we had a lot of fun doing it.
---
Siphon soul sees a fair bit of play and it costs 6, Rogue just doesn't have a use for assassinate. Hex and Polymorph should cost 5
---
A controversial opinion. A brave one at that. But we reached a game state where the game relies on drawing the right cards again. In Kobolds, I didn't mind because any class could use Keleseth effectively. Now, every hunter deck can draw an oppressive string of cards only beaten if you run odd pali or something to that nature of aggro.  
---
Side not is that DK Rexxar just isn't a cool card to play against. It turns a 180 reversal on the class identity and is run in any kind of hunter deck (even midrange) just so it can make up for the class's iconic weaknesses. A good balance design is to buff the strong parts of something, maybe give it more options, but not to remove any weaknesses. Giving them a garunteed good minion every turn (card draw) and giving a reasonable board clear+5 armor (stabilizing) should never be a part of the kit. If people don't think it's broken, they wouldn't go out of their way to craft and play it.
---
where did you find this?

If you have whizzbang, you can roll for the awesome augmentation deck, worked for me.
---
I hope the hunter hype train loses steam soon. It‚Äôs popularity stems from many reasons, including being untouched and being good against pretty much all decks below tier 2, much like KFT jade druid. Jade druid‚Äôs popularity rose drastically because people thought it was unstoppable and the only way to beat it was by playing jade druid, but in reality, there were decks like Pirate Warrior, Murloc Paladin and Aggro Druid that were favored against it. Same thing is happening with hunter where people think only hunter can beat hunter, but most of the tier 1/2 decks have good matchups against it. 
---
I think the solution would be to nerf the deck similar to how they nerfed jade druid, not to make hunter a lot worse, but so people will jump off the hype train. Sometimes you gotta nerf cards not because of actual power level, but because people are misinterpreting what‚Äôs good and making a worse meta because of it.
---
I'm surprised people think armor hate is unbalanceable.  That is laughably defeatist, but also it doesn't have to be balanced to be printed.
---
A neutral epic, call it Rust Technician, 7 mana 7/4 deals double damage to armor. It doesn't have charge, and can't get charge, and with 4 health late game it is easily removed.
---
It wouldn't see play, but that makes it a perfect epic.
---
V A L U E
---
Christ. I mean I sit here and say. Obviously no. But the reality is. Heck yeah. What a day it would be. I've bought.... Many packs...
---
It's a thousand times better than druid. OP Combo decks like that are not fun to play against 
---
Speaking of which does anyone legitimately know how to beat Wild Res Priest?
---
Turn 3/4 Barnes into bullshit like that 10/10 that summons more bullshit happens every game and there's just nothing i can do. I play even shaman, odd mage, tempo mage, odd paladin, zoolock, shudderwock, some others. All same outcome, can't win
---
Not really dealbreakers by a long shot.
---
If they wanted to (they don't) they could only give individual classes anti armor cards (like a piercing dagger for rogue) to limit the scope.
---
I'm actually playing Even Warlock, the only major deck besides APM Priest with a negative winrate against *every* Hunter archetype. My winrate looks like that because I'm a returning player climbing from rank 20 back to my normal spot in the 10-5 range; my vs Hunter rate is 60%, and it's still among my worst.  
---
But more importantly, I don't recall complaining that it's overpowered. I'm complaining that it's *overrepresented*. I admittedly have a particular beef with Hunter because I don't like secrets and I don't like long, grindy matches vs. Rexxar, but I'd be pretty sick of any class if it was in half my games.
---
You are playing warlock so yeah...
---
Nobody gives sympathy to priest players for when they were all highlanders for an expansion and a half. Back to the shaft they go. Here we have a class that was hated for a year and a half, then became partly bad except for when midrange was viable, then Blizzard gave them good cards for a year. Now we have to wait it out for them to leave.
---
DK is run in Beast Hunter though, at least in my experience.
---
best 8 or 9 mana tempo play ever, that also has a sick deathrattle
---
Even in its worst classes (mage and rogue who have no class taunts) its not a bad card, because there are very few bad taunts, just because the taunts aren't good enough to put in a deck, doesn't mean they're too bad to play if you generate them 
---
It would probably be something like "1 mana: draw a card and deal 5 damage to enemy armor". But even that is very iffy.
---
It depends on the amount of threats and the quality of the minion you kill. If a deck runs a few big minions and you spend 2 cards to kill some of them, it's great.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, they said to hall of fame them. And I could see Blizzard doing it if they want to print a card that functions similarly with a different twist.
---
Leroy I‚Äôm amazed they haven‚Äôt HoF‚Äôd yet. Blizzard had a hard turn on charge and he‚Äôs the epitome of that style.
---
Control decks are expensive because they require unique abilities from high rarity cards, this is the way it is in almost every card game. 
---
much more guaranteed than lich king giving you 15 to face
---
you could definitely tweak it a little bit if you get strong healing synergy often in the early game, taskmaster is one of the better 1 drops and the card is great in aggro matchups though the deathrattle is a downside of course
---
If you want to ladder up: spell hunter or control priest. If you want to have fun: Tess espionage rogue :)
