If old secret paladin taught me anything it will be a midranges build running 11-13 secrets. With that number masked is simply a good card even if it's just to thin the deck out faster
---
---
---
Oh wow I did not know that, I guess that shows that Rafaam is actually pretty good
---
The site doesn't seem to know how to design for web but it's a fun read nonetheless.
---
It’s GOLD, Jerry!
---
If you end up with enough dusk to craft a legendary after opening your packs, I'd recommend crafting [Whizbang the Wonderful](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Whizbang_the_Wonderful)  
---
  
---
By adding him to a deck, your deck will be a random recipe(pre-built) deck from the newest expansion. It will allow you to try out a lot of decent decks with very little commitment.
---
U can craft until 1pm est tomrrow once the xpac is active u cannot anymore
---
Considering "knights of the FUCKING throne" was my go-to reaction for a turn 7 Bonemare, I can't really blame you for reading it that way.
---
He's ovedoing the voice. He'd be more underestandable if he spoke normally.
---
Thanks Benny
---
I mean I still think the combo is garbage, but most of those points apply to any combo deck, so they prove nothing.
---
Thanks
---
The other picks are 1 mana so they generate less tempo. You can’t drop them alongside another 1 drop on turn 1/alongside a 2 drop with coin. Sanguine Reveler could be interesting if you have enough token fodder but is hard to use early and tiller is just a worse leper gnome most of the time.
---
Foul-mouthery!
---
Look whom is talking...
---
I could see just a casual midrange shaman deck with a few windfury minions and bloodlust, people always find some weird combo 'otk' decks that are either convoluted, just bad in terms of resources or b7sted as fuck.
---
Go play a different game there's a ton of cards in the game that you won't consider "healthy"
---
I can't see anything except fatigue, "valuemeta" is CoolStoryBob.
---
How come no one ever posts this stuff about puzzle lab?
---
Something tells me that Faceless rager is going to be nasty, especially if old school handlock with ancient watchers makes a comeback.
---
We even get an orphan!  I like this healthy change.
---
\*its
---
Jerk. He should've let you at least attack with the Dankness.
---
Level x + level y = level z
---

---
Stardust Dragon time.
---
Why did this guy just post half my decks?
---
Many decks are far off from good builds, try to be pro or semi-pro at least, don't ddos us with 38 decks, half of them stolen half of them unpractical.
---
It, being the rules text here, not the card.
---
"I'll be satiaified if you can provide just one interaction difference" is about the most pretentious thing I've heard all week so congrats to that. 
---
But if it concerns ye majesty, there is nary a difference betwixt echo and "repeatable this turns" other than their names. 
---
Dost this please m'Lord?
---
I welcome the change, but I primarily play odd mage and I'm sad cause I think the deck is really fun.
---
But I'm looking forward to see what it's going to be like once it officially launches. I'm pretty excited!
---
In the US packs cost the same for me on iOS as it does anywhere else.
---
Do not craft any cards you currently have in non golden. There is no benefit. 
---
Only craft missing playable copies, in golden if you have the dust.
---
Because you can easily just look those answers up. No challenge if it's the same answer every time
---
Not sure about iOS, but for Android we can't buy 60 packs, we can only do up to 40.
---
Thanks!
---
I can hear the sax
---
At that point, they were probably mad they wasted half an hour.
---
Craft the golden legendaries, they will give you the most dust profit
---
At this point I more look forward to his hearthstone stuff than his Overwatch stuff. Its memey and casual but most of all just fun to watch
---
I totally agree ! But still confused on one aspect though..
---
 What do i do with the pack fillers ? Should i DE them ?
---
Why would I play a different game when Lich king is rotating out tomorrow along with more cards that are unhealthy to the game? (Baku, genn, Bloodreaver guldan and frost lich jaina just to name a few)Telling people to find a different game when they bring up a good point against a card you like is never a good argument.
---
My priority are cards that create other cards or similar aesthetic effects. Genn and Baku both give you a new hero power, and if they are gold, your hero power becomes golden. 
---
The other cards that are being HOF don’t contribute to that one rule I have. So they don’t take priority
---
Cuz girls don't play video games.
---
Yeah this would never happen
---
Yeah a 2 mana 3/2 is decent. Beast/murloc synergy makes it good. Rush makes it amazing!
---
I’m hesitant to call it OP, because a lot of the time it’s a 2 mana 1/1 deal 2 damage to a minion which is decent, but not broken.
---
Good luck partner! I found the extra mana crystal from the start gave me sizable leads in terms of aggression if that helps!
---
Zero golden legendaries for me :(
---
Oh yes I love him. Usually they either have to make bad trades, do nothing or waste removal on a 2 drop. I also like him because the art reminds me of when I was really into WoW and A snail was one of my most used pets.
---
I did forget that difference. Same on iOS.
---
Hm, might not be intended, but then again, very nice pun.
---
You got this!
---
You‘re right. I meant this doom from the old gods. Somehow I thought it‘s still in, Too bad.
---
Don't be stupid.
---
10
---
Well keywords, not the whole text. Also not adjacent minions, it should say that minion as in referring to the minion on the right.
---
I'm so bad at HS, the pre KnC Tempo Rogue and KnC controllock were the only times I hit rank 10.
---
public service reminder: economic players need to dust wild cards to keep up with standard. hearthstone's dust system gives YOU control over what you play, but the lower your total dust/card pool is the more you have to make decisions on what you prefer between which classes, and wild vs. standard.
---
just remember the dust/gold system was not designed with wild in mind. in my eyes, wild is for mid to high paying players only. don't get fooled by streamers with all the classes, free to play affords 1, and at best 2 whole classes for standard only, by dusting everything else, including wild.
---
In sorry, i deleted most of the decks I created but some of them Were online decks, like for the Malchezzar. Also, I created them using my collection, which may have legendaries you do not have. Unless you have a big collection, of course. Which you may have
---
You REALLY don't want it.
---
Ass opposed to the company stealing from you. They charge the highest amount possible per region. 
---
Pretty soon companies will start using AI to charge individuals their own personal maximum amount so for you it's $4.99 a pack because that's what your spending habits say you can afford.
---
Bring out the Goblin Bombs
---
Oh yeah definitely. Naxx/Blackrock/league is very difficult I have only defeated a couple bosses in each one. :/
---
How “muusssssshrooooooom pooooooweerrrrr” survived all the nerds I don’t know
---
Maybe, some cards would definitely help.
---
&gt; developers have the ability to improve wording rather then be stuck forever on an old mistake.
---
Great, then update all of them to that if it's deemed better wording.  Why even invite the potential for confusion when you could just make them all consistent?
---
Wild player here... I’ll be seeing these cards plenty!
---
Smoother releases lmfao. I remember Un'Goro was set to realese as 22:00 but we "got it" at about 04:30 next morning. That's if you didn't get kicked every other minute.
---
A card with a 25% chance to instantly win the game is pretty good. You might say it'd be bad for a good player, but a player who doesn't draft it will lose games to players who do. I'd argue this card is worse than dyn-o-matic (one of the best cards ever printed), but better than say.. Reckless rocketeer, a card that you rated 22 full points above it.  
---
Also, if you haven't drawn the card it doesn't matter what it is, so you shouldn't multiply the chance of having drawn the card through.
---
I know that in this case nobody should be confused. My point is that it would be better if Blizzard can be consistent with descriptions and stuff. Even though the text does not affect how the game runs, it affects what players would expect from playing the card. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We've seen other cases where they have the same effect with different descriptions (or using key words or not), and this is how we start to criticize inconsistent text. 
---
In terms of flexibility, why not making some minor changes on the old cards if they find a better wording of an effect?
---
Kalimos is such a bro.
---
Dude it's not that hard to understand you get dust for the max number you could put in a deck (2 cards). If you have more than 2 copies you get dust for just 2 copies. Gold is always prioritized
---
You forgot " The new expansion will go live in exactly"  
---
How can it be exact if it gets updated hourly? Even if it's every few minutes it won't be exact most of the time.
---
Duck I hope it's a different game... this last year was cock sucking cancerous filth decks. Odd and even... whoever designed that should be fired.  Plus itll be nice to hopefully see hunters drop down a peg.
---
Ty for clarifying to the kther guy, I was afk for a while, but ya exactly as you said. Hope you have a good day :)
---
yes, but there will probably be some sort of secret paladin that will emerge and suck to play against
---
I can't do priest
---
Ungoro was before my time but he’s definitely one of my favs
---
OP can't figure out how to use the search bar or scroll down for a couple of seconds. Don't be to hard on him.
---
Don't think twice, don't think twice WOOOO
---
I wouldn't mind if priest class somehow got destroyed in Wow universe and HS itself, but then again, Im a priest hater.
---
hm i see hopefully the meta will at least be more diverse with baku genn and a bunch of op cards that are objectively better than what recent expansions have to offer rotating out
---
I didn't include classic ones because you often get classic packs off Tavern Brawls. Since they put out the "no dupe" rule, I'm better off keeping a bad classic legendary in order to get one I don't have.
---
I don't intend to ever buy these wild packs so I'll likely never get these junk legendaries again.
---
And then people wonder why we don't keep all the keywords...
---
The new 2 mana spell (I believe it might be called Sweeping Strikes?) seems pretty crazy with Overkill cards, especially if they also got Rush. 10 mana combo to kill 3 minions, draw 3 minions, and buff each one +5/5 if you combo it with Akali. Or combo it with with the 7 mana 5/10 for 8x attack.
---
That being said, there's a lot of terrible cards that look like free ~~real estate~~ dust to me. For example, jungle giants. And the murloc quest, whatever that was called.
---
You can! With enough time I almost guarantee your RNG will win you the run!
---
Gonna miss the death knights
---
use the search function please
---
Better that than a Blizzard shill/apologist like yourself. ;)
---
There's simply no need to.
---
If it looks fine as it is then leave it, changing them all would probably be a worthwhile usage for shutting people up and increasing the quality of the game. But I suspect that it doesn't happen because of how insanely toxic the player base is. Set precedent for changing that stuff and suddenly every player is doing nothing but bitching about the missed ones.
---
We created this situation of making those changes completely pointless, not blizzard.
---
This happened to me the other day, except I was on the receiving end! Really pretty aggravating when the AI manages to use a bug against you and it ruins your otherwise almost perfect run.
---
Yu-gi-oh be like
---
you just shouldn't dust legendaries period, it's a waste of dust.
---
"This battlecry does not trigger battlecry effects"
---
Always
---
I'll miss keleseth, mostly because he was the first legendary I ever got out of a pack
---
I think you misremember. 
---
This statement was contingent on the existence of a minion based druid deck. Which was pretty much nonexistent so far.
---
"King Snow, no, um that doesn't sound right, how about King Lich?"
---
The good ol malygno
---
yes. the next turn I had a 4/8 tar creeper and an 11/11 Lich King later.
---
We wouldn't dare forget our F2P king !
---
Because it costs time and money to change those? Because sometimes it produces card text that isn't very nice to look at in spacing.
---
I'll take inconsistent but good looking cards over consistent but garbage looking cards.
---
wow you are all so negative, why do you even play this game if you hate every single card smh
---
What exactly is your problem with [[northshire cleric]]?
---
Let's be real here. Firefly was rarely a card that was included for any reason other than "I need a one drop". It lines up badly into most 2 drops (2/2s or 2/3s) and doesn't really contest the 1/3s that make up the rest of the one drop pool.
---
The only thing it did well was contest paladin 1/1's and come down on turn 1. It just happened to be the most versatile body that most decks could put down on turn 1, because the rest of the pool is pretty awful. Decks that could use anything else, pretty much did.
---
There’s a boy and girl emoji, but where are the other 15 genders???
---
/s
---
This isn’t correct because the minion technically doesn’t get “played” in the definition of the keyword “play”.  Ex: it doesn’t trigger Explosive Runes.  It works like a spell without being a spell.  I agree with the expanded vernacular though.
---
Sorry, duderino. That's not going to accomplish much, and I'd be lying if I told you otherwise. If it is any consolation: you're not alone. Many refuse to pay a cent of real money. Buying pre-orders is more about the golden legendary and being able to build what I want from day one; I usually wind up crafting a good 5k+ worth of stuff opening day. 
---
Better than nothing though! GL

---
Not really, aussie culture. It's like saying goodbye over here.
---
Holy smokes, that looks like one crazy deck ! XD
---
Sure ok, let's hear these "fundamentals" of yours.  
---
Assuming of course you know exactly what cards are coming from the new set to craft the deck I would need to make it "fundamentally" better to gain those packs.
---
I see what you are referencing there
---
Hey there
---
Don't be scared
---
I hate it but its true
---
i actually said scribe was constructed playable, also comparing it to highmane but is a neutral card. i would imagine it to bonkers in arena.
---
I mean trump is a man of many talents, but card predictions are not one of them. 
---
What the heck is that list supposed to cut in order to support loti? Spellstone swipe wrath and naturalise are just better.
---
Amani Warbear is from Rasthakan‘s Rumble so it won’t rotate out, it will be playable in standard mode. Only cards from Knights of the Frozen Throne, Journey to Un‘Goro and Kobolds &amp; Catacombs rotate out (and Doomguard, Naturalize, Baku and Genn are getting banned basically).
---
However, Arena mode is gonna follow a different set of cards and I do think Amani Warbear won’t be available in it for the next couple of months.
---
I think cards like Firefly should only be class cards.
---
It makes sense in an agressive deck too, kinda like how Zoo bypassed Doomguard's downside.
---
Ok I laughed hard at this. Thank you.
---
Because it's super friggin obvious what it does and easy enough to spell out.
---
you get an extra ticket to start a new run on top of the rewards for the original run
---
In theory Grull should win +2/+2 each end of turn because it's a «end of [each] turn» effect
---
they have high health ... so it must be true
---
Agreed, too much effort
---

---
Stonehill Defender isn't classic?  Well I'll be damned
---
I started playing again in January and I've saved enough for 64 packs, plus various extras.
---
I'll miss Stonehill a lot. He was such a perfect control card; he's a cheap taunt to play against aggro, that also gives you either another cheap taunt or something expensive and valuable. I ran him in pretty much any control deck even if there weren't any good class taunts; he saw play in my Big Spell Mage and Dragon Priest, and of course my Lynessa Paladin.
---
Move to Argentina, lol
---
Even paladin pre CTA nerf for me.
---
Hey, gender studies is useful.
---
Dont you get that for just starting one without gettting any wins? Like i would just start one now and leave it till expansion lunch.
---
You forgot **Black Knight'**ed.
---
Goodbye the expansion in which I begun playing the game, you will be missed.
---
Well, **start of game** and "repeatable this turn" are two good counter-examples. The former is also obvious and understandable, while the latter is shorter than "at the end of your turn".
---
For me, the joy of Fire Fly is how it interacts with handbuff paladin, elemental mage, tempo rogue and midrange Shaman in completely different ways
---
Goblins V Gnomes was being teased when I started playing.  Probably spent $350 or so.  I’m a steady Dad-Legend player, hit real legend once when Nagalock was crazy broken.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzhxP-pdos
---
That*
---
We'll see! Do you think the Prince Liam and Hakkar combo will be good? There is no more skulking geist to counter it, and I'll have control cards like Thekal and Shirvallah to flesh it out.
---
Right, but why not get the maximum rewards out of that run? Leaving it at 0-0 as opposed to say, 3-2, is just a waste of possible rewards. Hence going to 2 losses.
---
Bump!
---
yes, that's true as well, but you get more rewards the more wins you have
---
The prolific Duskbreaker would like to have a word with you
---
It really was a Mammoth set in terms of power level.
---
I’m just going to assume he meant he would exclusively be seeing fire fly and lich king in every other game.
---
Imma really miss that dude. An adorable little 1/1 with the ability to take down bloodmage thalnos is hilarious. I like how it’s a chill ass motherfucker too. I like that he’s wants to cast a spell mainly. Cards that don't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" are not represented much and it’s nice to have one. Imma miss that little chill card.
---
I love weed
---
The visuals and data display should be improved
---
When you swap to view a deck "on the coin" or "going first," the average win rate of the deck *should* change. Some decks do better going first or second; we all know that. However, the site just continue to show card colors and stats in relation to the *overall average* win rate of the deck regardless of going first or second. 
---
Why does this matter? Typically cards that are, say, above average when kept in the mulligan are indicated in green. If the *entire deck's win rate drops* because you're going second but the win rate average doesn't change, fewer cards will be in the green than they should be.
---
In other words, if you're trying to figure out what to keep "at a glance," this new display will yield people keeping fewer cards than they should. If you're trying to  figure out what the win rate of a deck is going first or second, you don't have access to it.
---
If your on PC try using https://www.heartharena.com/ to help you draft your run. You may not agree with some of the picks, but it's a helpful tool for rating the cards based off of how well the card generally does with the class you've picked in arena and the synergies within your deck
---
You mean 'health, attack and card text'. 'Stats' is mutually redundant with 'health' and 'attack', and you've omitted 'card text'.
---
*cries in Wild*
---
Did you know that Stonehill Defender is roatatint? RIP sweet prince!!!!
---
And neither of them are keywords? Not sure your point here.
---
I take it you are asking about the Hall of Fame.
---
You will receive dust for any of the new Hall of Fame cards that you own tomorrow.  But you also get to keep the cards.
---
For example, if you own 2 Doomguards, you will get 200 dust plus you will keep your 2 Doomguards.
---
Therefore, it is beneficial to craft any Hall of Fame cards that you are missing.  You can either keep them as free cards (for use in Wild) or you can disenchant them after tomorrow, thus getting free dust.
---
On the one hand, I'm glad KnC will be gone. I despise Cube more than any other card in Hearthstone's history save for Patches (I started in BRM so I didn't experience Undertaker hell), and I don't like how powerful Recruit turned out to be either.
---
On the other hand, there were some legitimately cool cards that still feel new. Lynessa and Alanna are the two cards I'll probably miss the most.
---
Potentially weaker than the current one though, it's harder to summon lots of good stuff, there's nomana reduction so OTKs don't really factor in nearly as easily (you need a coin to do mindblast shenanigans), and you can't pull a wall of taunts.  Plus with no shadow visions to get specific spells it does make them a fair bit weaker.
---
I interpreted the title as in you make a living off of bees and have saved up the earnings for the expansion or something lol
---
There'll definitely be some new aggro decks, though there's still a decent number of tools to handle aggro with.
---
It helped immensely that the two drop pool was bad for most of this past rotation. Unless you were playing defensively or needed key class cards, you just jammed keleseth because the trade off became worth it
---
I LOVE GOOOOOOLLLLLLLLD
---
congrats. enjoy!
---
I can imagine the shenanigans that would happen if wild if blizzard ever gave hunter the ability to summon cheap copies of expensive minions(like priest). Imagine t4 ancient one,
---
Prox#1726 NA. Trading 80g quest. I'll show, you go first.
---
I don't mind resurrection per se, I just don't like that it doesn't resurrect a clone of the dead minion (i.e. 1/1).  
---
In saying that I guess if it resurrected a clone then you'd get issues with buffed minions too.
---
Small taunt = RIP your plan
---
That one other guy has to scrub the nerd off for hours after work every day.  Gotta feel for the dude.
---
Soon as bonemare is played, 70% chance that that player wins in my experience. Awesome card.
---
within the first 10 packs of a set have legendary, so get that before the rotation tomorrow  
---
https://disguisedtoast.com/articles/261-new-and-beginner-players
---
Nope. He played in on Turn 7 after passing/just playing Northshire and Shadow Visions in his first few turns.
---
This is gonna be a long story shortened because I'm tired but if you respond later I'll offer more(sorry I'm just not good at advice tired) basically further down the card packs are, the sooner they are to rotation, which means in hearthstone that once they rotate out of standard(the mode you are playing) you have to use those cards in wild only, which includes all cards since the release of hearthstone. So I would recommend finding a class you particularly like, and beginning to start looking through cards and deck ideas you'd find interesting and buying packs and crafting cards around those decks until you manage to get a larger collection. I'd start with the newest set first of course, since they are going to last the longest as far as usage in standard goes.
---
Ah, I must have missed those, a quick look through the different sorting options of reddit didn't show any to me.
---
its \*
---
...in Winterfell.
---
Yeah, there's potential for some ridiculous stuff with buffs, though really, overall a clone would probably be a lot better.

cared?
---
i agree with that. there werent enough class specific 1 drops, so you had to use neutral 1 drops and most of them werent very strong unless you had some synergy with beasts, elementals or whatever.
---
it says a lot when even a minion like dire mole was played in decks that didnt even need the beast tag
---
don't forget, top deck mode vs zoo lock digging for owls or stone hill.
---
Yours doesn't confuse the new people, right
---
Even the occassional neigh-indestructable high level character just breezing through old content for fun still gets surprised when a snail unexpectedly kills them with a touch.
---
For 2 mana you get 2/4 worth of stats. Granted there are other factors but when you boil it down its hardly bloated imo.

Set exclusive keywords are what give the expansion its identity. If every keyword was in every set then it wouldnt feel like a new expansion.
---
I think I’m most excited for the DKs and Naturalize to leave... I’m not a fan of the odd/even decks busy they were less frustrating than certain DOs and their oppressive shit. Also I very much dislike Mechtun and wish he was rotating too.
---
It's simple:
---
I play Corridor Creeper (which costs 0, of course)
---
Then I play another Corridor Creeper
---
Then I cast... THRALL, KING OF THE GOONS
---
The Corridor Creepers then transform into... BLOOD OF THE ANCIENT ONE
---
Then at the end of my turn...
---
I summon...
---
THE BANCIENT ONE!!!!!!

---
Clutch man
---
Nah, it ain't tragic at all. I'm really glad all these big taunts will rotate out. You could just play 2 of these fuckers and make your opponent concede(if he is play aggro or even tempo at some point).
---
You still need a comma if you want that to be even remotely clear. Attack my friend and also text my friend?
---
That or everyone's just itching for the new expac and the sub has devolved to critical levels of memeness.
---
So kobolds &amp; catacombs and journey to un'goro packs are the two oldest set in the game?  That's why they are being rotating out?
---
Not I, I don't care about cardbacks too much
---
Tying?
---
The animation when played is maybe the best ever.
---
On turn 2!! How???!!!
---
Un'Goro is an amazing zone in WoW as well. Very atmospheric.
---
I feel like mechathun will work for them all but thats alot of battles
---
I saw some streamers (WowHobbs and Toast if i remember correctly) that have golden Vargoth. Could be possible that Blizzard gave golden Vargoth to popular streamers and you faced one?
---
I love how Toast being in the first column forces my eyes to read it first and with his rating system either every card is god tier or trash.
---
First they likely won't print more magnetic minions because they're likely difficult to balance outside of base stats. Second this meme is stupid. Let it go people, it's not even that big if a deal.
---
No clue. Just happened after a game.
---
Klaus Badelt fan?

I recommend checking out RenoJackson, Control and Dane (wild players), they make some really fun decks that you could probably still reach legend with (although not all of them and it's definitely not recommended for climbing). Also take a look at Thijs' recent wild videos, he played quite a lot of fun decks (Miracle Yogg Druid, Big Shaman, Krullock, Reno Hunter, Quest Mage with Giants [now could probably be even better with Vargoth?])
---
Other than that, potential fun decks off the top of my head: Reno/Yogg Shudderwock Shaman, Jade Shudderwock Shaman, Dead Mans Hand Warrior (optionally with Yogg), Patron Warrior, Malygos Warlock and Shaman, Cubelock, Thief/Mill/Big Rogue, Reno Mage/Priest, Anyfin Paladin, Even Decks (Mage, Rogue, Druid, Hunter?)
---
Building hard around any legendary I open and seeing where it goes from there.
---
No problem.  They do a rotation every year, so Boomsday, Witchwood, and RR will rotate out in a year's time.
---
I doubt that it was a hacker, probably just a copy generated by Zola, or a golden card
---
Thank you for filling the role of reddit guy who comments on posts to complain about people writing and commenting on posts. The internet would not be the same without your tireless work and dedication
---
like how many days?
---
Strength is always relative. Firefly is the best option in the weakest slot right now. Decks are either running better class one drops, running firefly because it's better than nothing, or just running nothing because they don't care about fighting for the board early. 
---
Given that the devs insist on printing vanilla upside minions, just being overstated is rarely enough to justify seeing play. Most things need to do something on the turn you play them. Firefly is two vanilla 1/2's.
---
As a one drop, it's pretty bad. It trades poorly into 2 drops, and a lot of one drops. But it has a second body you can drop later to fill out your curve.
---
As a two drop it is pretty bad. It's spread across two bodies, so your opponent can often value trade. It's weak to aoes and struggles at dealing with taunts. You would almost always prefer to drop a real two drop over the two halves of firefly.
---
And that's because the two drop slot is a whole lot stronger. In just the neutral 2's you have Thalnos, Keleseth, wild pyro, doomsayer, firetree witchdoctor. All of these are more than one mana better than anything in the one drop slot.
---
Rush I definitely enjoy a lot, big isn't quite my thing, but it did get some cool new tools for sure.  Bomb might be a good combo with rush, rush would play the old Dr Boom if it could I bet.
---
And murlocs probably will be the new hated aggro deck, but...  I just like murloc decks too much to really hate them.
---
Yeah but you can play Shadow Essence and get Vargoth from that, and if you do then he casts it again.
---
Hell yeah another comment complaining about said threads involving rotating cards !!

I got 12 legendary + 2 golden legendary in 143 packs. Best expansion ever.
---
In that case then, in the animation where the cards go into the fray (which is random) stands true to the theme. Or they could change the odds like that.
---
I knew about icewalker, didn't know about glacial shard.  Now I can't help but see those trees as tiny little model trees it's playing with, I just... It's too hard to try and imagine glacial shard as that big.
---
No wonder they crop the art.
---
Yes, not too happy that people give Hans Zimmer the credit for the first movie when it was originally credited to Badelt.  But also just a fan of pirates in general
---
I said it when Quest Mage was in full flow and I'll say it again but Sorc's Apprentice needs looking at so that it can only reduce spell mana costs down to 1 like the Warlock card
---
But that means you dont have a dead card.
---
Bloodlust would be better than tornado Boi if you're not using it for the combo
---
like u dont need any cards with this one? its own deck i dont understand
---
I'm gonna have fun with questing/banana buffoon miracle mage
---
It isa total BS gamemode like all of the other half-baked 'single player content' they released recently. I was able to cheese it with the steal shrine and never looked back.
---
RIP real adventures
---
it all makes sense now.gif
---
Yeah that sounds good to me lol, currently at 1600dust so enough for a legendary and the dust from what a 131 packs worth of extras will bring, silence priest sounds fun though

Up to the second it launches, but don't cut it too fine.
---
What synergy? I love the Shadow Priest aesthetic but I didn't notice anything new (except maybe for [[Hench-Clan Shadequill]])
---
Opposite. You run that in an aggro deck
---
Cuz u see that's something that comes wih experience. Why dont u build a deck on your own without any help? Then play a couple of games with it. Understand why u lost each time u lose. Was it cuz u didnt have board clear? Is it cuz u had bad late game? Is it because u couldnt deal with a particular card? Add/remove cards from your deck to have it not happen again.
---
To start off, I would suggest having a fairly equal no. of cards in your deck that cost more than 4 and less than 4 mana. Like this it provides u with a base to begin with. Another tip would be to include 1 silence in every deck (spellbreaker), unless you're playing priest.

4/4/7 | Deathrattle: Restore 5 Health to the enemy hero.  
---
Nope!
---
So the 9 cards are no longer going to be playable? Or just thrown into wild? Also are those 2 you mentioned I am assuming are going to be uncraftable after launch?
---
Is it though? This is a world with no deathknights and with enough disruption you can have a chance vs aggro and combo.
---
so by that logic ya'sheraj is a useless card in that deck, its just a card that summons card..... barnes doesn't have to do anthing with the card that it summons the turn it is summoned, 1/1 obsidian statue does barely anything apart from maybe killing a 4/4, so i recon it'll be an auto include in big priest. catrina can res itself upon being resurrected the first time, which has the potential to snowball out of control with infinite catrinas after 2 turns. look how the infinite vargoth combos turned out if you want proof. as well as that, if you get it in the late game it has the chance to res rag, ya'sheraj, obsidian statue, and all of your other late game cards at the end of each turn.
---
There was actually a really popular version of this list you're talking about with cube and voidlords. I played it a lot while getting gold warlock cause normal cube was a walk in the park. Either I drew combo fast enough and just killed him after the cube combo or I cubed my voidlords and won fatigue. At least with the none doomguard variant it was more fun to fatigue someone out and be able to get rin off.
---
No problem :), if you ever need someone to practice against DM me
---
I'm gonna miss lich King so much
---
I remember when all firebat did in deck doctor was to add in corridor creeper and keleseth.
---
No problem my dude :), if you ever want to practice against someone just hmu, I’ve taught a few of my friends
---
and im gonna be ready for it with 13k dust to make whatever BS deck arises
---
Soo, you're. In luck as the rotation will cause this meta to be gone. It might be your play style, or it might be your match ups. Hard to say, but you will be starting at 0 with the rotation. The same with everyone else.  Mech pally is typically trying to go for the midgame and those decks typically need to play smarter as you need to manage your resources while having board pressure. You don't have as much reload on your cards.
---
Do you use a deck tracker? I'm currently watching a friends play and I tell them to slow down and try to think about how the turn will play out. Example against priest, about to be might play mass hyseria. You can try to bait out the card by playing just enough minions to feel like pressure, or not develop the board. The issue is that if you are midrange, you need board developmen against priest to get more damage to their face. If you don't put enough pressure they might just play zilliax. Also, you need to try to kill the priest before turn 8 or 9 as they develop most of their strong stuff by then. The good thing is that typically, priest does almost nothing with their first 4 turns.
---
 
---
So this gives you an idea of the thought process that will help you climb and what knowing the meta means.
---
Un'Goro has been one of the best, vital and most fun expansions. It's going to feel so different without it.
---
Cant wait to face that in arena....
---
The Black Knight.
---
Portals are demon bombs.
---
assume no additional free legendary, subject to change
---
Ranked/Standard. From web 'hsreplay'
---
I doubt they will, judging by how they treated Echo.
---
I agree with a lot of what you said but another thing to keep in mind is Patches wasn’t only good because of his stats (although it didn’t hurt), patches was good because he also thinned your deck.
---
Not only did he make your turn one stronger, by reducing your deck size by a card he effectively made it slightly easier for you to find your win condition and tech when you needed it which is a huge boon.
---
Hog rider will probably be super strong but if it is played it won’t entirely be played for the same reason Patches was. Sticky Minions are always nice, Tribal Synergies are always nice, instant damage is always nice, and because of that this card will probably be super nice too
---
No I dont use a deck tracker, but yea psychic scream is a pain in the ass. Especially in combination with mass hysteria.

You can't do that twice, tho. Not sure why this is upvoted
---
Let it go. It had to happen one day, so just deal with it. They arent coming back.
---
If you're claiming it's a 2/4 because the 1/2 and 1/2, it's really not. That's especially relevant later game with board clears.
---
Top decking northshire, the armor bot, murlocs, a dire mole with beast synergies in your deck, are all better top decks. Many, not all of the class one drops are generally better late game and there's a reason those decks don't play firefly in this first place. 
---
If we moved into two drops like you say, there are a million and one I'd rather top deck in just about any deck rather than firefly. I guess in an odd deck there aren't. All currently played two drops have a move specific purpose than firefly, so they are less versatile but otherwise always better.
---
Firefly exists for early game pressure because it is an efficient, but not overly efficient one drop, or it helps some specific midrange decks that can also get minimal advantage from its mechanical synergies (namely mage and rogue) control the early board. Otherwise there are better one drops.
---
I opened a golden \[\[Princess Huhuran\]\] for my first which i stupidly disenchanted for jaraxus...

---
Control warlock will be powerful! I built one that should destroy aggro decks.
---
I think reworking the tutorial would be good at this point for new players.
---
Or discard 2 warlock cards with 1.
---
I did in my beast hunter quest. I didn'rt run any spells and it acted as a distraction for the other player.  quite funny to see them try their hardest to kill it without using spells.
---
Bolvar1
---
read what [[ray of frost]] does.

So you're saying the card is being run because people can use it as a huge source of lifesteal?

1/-/- | Twinspell  Freeze a minion. If it's already Frozen , deal 2 damage to it.

Of course you can.

Why not? First time it gets frozen, second time it gets dead. But yeah, not the smartest play.
---
For almost every country in Europe it is 18 o'clock (6pm)
---
Yeah it’s surprising hard to find a place where they are all neatly summerised
---
I have learned a long time ago that Deathwing should be used in desperation only, or when I have nothing else in my hand.
---
how would you trigger mecha thun in the warrior deck tho?
---
Or they're all cheap so you just dump your hand and use this to refill
---
I'm pretty sure GMT came before GMT as a standard. Happy to be proven wrong though.

Today my favorite "Buffadin" card is leaving! She was never insane, but I always loved this effect! It doesnt matter if you just had one steed into her, or two, multiple ding dongs, and more, I always loved her!
---
I really liked this card design, that gave you more value for your buffs, also a silence target on turn 7 just before tirion was nice.
---
Good bye Lynessa!
---
I've never seen him in standard.
---
i like the more "proactive" (?) nerfs they've been doing recently and thats enough to shake up the meta for a bit. but given a large enough player size, any meta will be solved relatively quickly
---
This was my first golden legendary I got in a pack.
---
Also, do I get full dust refund for disenchanting it? Or is that just for hall of fame cards
---
NICE!
---
Should I use my HoF dust to get classic legendaries or expansion legendaries? Still missing Alex, Ysera, Thalnos, and some class legendaries. I’m F2P.
---
I´ve never seen that deck in play but I would imagine what you need is a decent early game and some strong removals to prepare for the combo right?
---
One of my favorites as well dude, I feel your pain... but her legacy will continue in wild. I just love playing quest paladin in wild tbh.
---
Yeah that's what the card does, good job.
---
If you're asking if i'm from either of those 2 area, i'm not.
---
Dont have any golden heroes yet :p have around 300 wins on each hero, some lower some higher
---
I've done it twice, never had a problem.
---
I know what I wont be missing... 
---
these stupid hunters. literally few hours left to enjoy maybe some interesting combos, decks and stuff and all i get on my ladder is these brain dead mid-range hunter decks
---
got a golden one yesterday
---
Working as intended based on card text. Doesn’t do damage to attacked minion
---
So what you're saying is that I should craft all the ( soon to be) hall of fame cards and I get bonus dust?
---
As a buff, because it can be silenced.
---
The combo is alright in itself, but then you have to run both of those cards in your deck and I don't think that's something you want.
---
KingMarf#2588 (EU). For trading the 80g quest. I will show, but you go first.

It’s s fun grind, I finished ages ago but I’ve been playing since Naxx
---
I’m at about 10.5k total wins
---
Nice effort, thanks for this.
---
Based on the average streamer score the "best" legendary pulls will be
---
* Stelladris
---
* Khadgar
---
* kalecgos
---
* Rhyssa
---
* Madame Lazul
---
* Catrina Muerte
---
* Togwaggle
---
* Scargill
---
Although I have to say that the average rating is much higher than for the previous expansions.
---
Good lucks with your pack openings guys!
---
Yeah, So I was thinking like light warden with north shire. Also with the new silence cards from the new expansion. I might throw in that 4-7 with the death rattle that heals opponent for 5. The war bear is amazing. 2 shadow word death and one pain. 
---
I want the combo to be a swing turn and less of a try to set up sorta thing. So you can take your time to develop the board and play the spirit to help with the reload. I'll be trying to figure it out based on the cards I get from the next expansion. Rank 4 is about to see some weird decks =\]
---
Id add some card draw. Preferably an acolyte of pain.
---
How in the world are you quoting 3k gold a month as "the norm"? The average quest nets you 60-70 gold per day. You would have to win 9-12 rounds every single day to reach that 3k per month mark. At a 50% win rate (a reasonable average) this would require you to play for several hours each day assuming your rounds took about five minutes each. Looking at my HDT stats, my rounds usually go significantly longer than that. 
---
I don't think the average player spends that much time playing Hearthstone. Or maybe I'm completely wrong and I'm just the one who doesn't spend as much time as everyone else does.
---
The win count doesn't show on smaller mobile devices in arena games, just saying.
---
Well Tyrande and Khadgar are now a lost cause. I dont think blizzard is going is ever going to solve it and less if people keep buying the hero skins they release for money. I hope they are just pulling a prank on us or that the new skin can be obtained in the new adventure as with Arthas.
---
I always loved Ysera because of her Dreamcards, but she really only was playable in super slow and greedy decks. Lich King was the much more playable version of her, even Midrange decks had him included, he was at least in half of my decks I think.
---
The card is just so versatile... immediate effect with Taunt and it forces the opponent to either trade into him or use a hard removal. Still you always get your random DK-Card which depending on situation can win you the game or at least is a nice gimmick.
---
Pity that card rotates out.
---
I’m at 10.5k
---
Highest are lock and pallyill update with exact numbers later
---
Maybe try [[Tunnel Blaster]]
---
It's called f2p for a reason. You earn what you spend, as simple as that. It's the cost of playing the game. Why would I keep cards that I will never use again when they could be dust that I can use to craft new cards that are playable? It makes absolutely zero sense to keep the cards that have rotated out of standard if you are certain you won't be playing wild.
---
I had some fun playing Quest Paladin in standart before the equality nerf and playing the quest dino + faceless on turn 10.
---
The deck had so many threats, it was cool! Lynessa, Tirion, Dino, Faceless, all the buffs :)
---
Lets see what the new paladin identity will be :x
---
I always hated odd and aggro paladin, secret paladin also wasnt the best for me. Always liked more control and midrange decks. Im excited to try some dragon midrange versions! 970 Pala Wins so far haha :)

---
What they have been trying to do (it seems) is printing  minions that summon garbage for your opponent. They've been doing it a lot, and this set has flightmaster which looks like it could go into odd rogue nicely for example.
---
There are definitely people thinking about it. I mention it in passing, but I did not provide a list, because I cannot think of a list that would be reliable enough.
---
Key pieces are the damage spells, Jepetto, and Master's Call to tutor Jepetto. 
---
I just can't bring myself to believe in it, because you must not draw Malygos before you can play Jepetto, and you must draw enough damage spells, and I don't like the odds of that. Jepetto can always be tutored for, that is not a problem for the deck, but the spells are.

I never pay for anything virtual. I win gold from quests and won battles, then I buy cards from new expense. By the way: Rastakhan's Rumble is still valid? Should I buy cards from Rastakhan's Rumble?

That's not true. It really depends on the situation. Sometimes it's much better to get it out earlier, when you can salvage the tempo swing.

I managed to beat him with a very aggressive freeze mage-ish deck back when it was still new. Just smorc down the orc like a tempo mage, then switch to a more control-like playstyle for prince. Took a few tries tho.
---
No plan survives the first contact, anyway. All tech choices will need to be thought anew when we can start playing, and every deck will need to be adjusted: a bit of healing there, a taunt minion here, some more card draw to something, and so on.

The point of theorycrafting is just to recognize the archetypes that can be built and provide the first draft to work on.

Hi everyone!
---
As RoS is launching in about 7 hours now, I was wondering how many packs the average redditor is going to open today. I'm definitely excited for the new expansion and I hope you are too!
---
I myself currently (still) can't afford to pre-order, but I saved up a decent chunk of gold and together with the (12!) free packs I'll open 70 today.
---
I also asked this question with a poll for Rastakhan's Rumble and over 1200 people answered there, you can see those results [here](https://www.strawpoll.me/16975056/r).
---
Good luck with your packs!
---
No one appreciated pure element burn shaman. Going face with 2 blazedallers 2 fire elementals and kalimnos was a lot of free face dmg
---
With the double pre order, free packs, free arena and a bit of gold I should be opening over 150 today assuming we get the full 12 quest packs today.
---

---
Thief Rogue is the best deck. I'm going to devote all my dust into making a wild thief rogue deck before Tess rotates out
---
Or in short be creative and have lategamegreed and a good boardclear
---
Not since beta but I started playing with the old gods launch. I always DE everything and also never regret it. Sure there is an entire Mode I'm missing out on but it's not like there isn't enough to do without wild. Also having 50k+ dust is always a nice start for a new year.
---
This is the peak of low effort bullshit that gets upvoted before the expansion. Congratulations.
---
Mekkatorque, because I used the shop during beta :)
---
Negative, yes, pretentious, no. If you have a problem with that, then I suggest you follow your own advice and find a different sub.
---
I think bomb warrior could be very interesting, and is one of the new decks that I'm most excited for
---
Yeah, play all four you have, I still will draw her.
---
Yeah, I only mention it in passing, because I could not think of a version I'd believe in. 
---
I don't feel comfortable with decks where you must **not** draw specific cards to succeed, like with Malygos Hunter where you need to be able to play Jepetto before you draw Malygos. You can tutor Jepetto with Master's Call, but it's still a gamble in every game, and even if you get that part right, you still need to draw enough damage spells to win afterwards.
---
It's good that you linked a list though for anyone interested in the archetype!
---
No offense, but maybe that’s because of your rank. It is actually a win condition for many control warlocks
---
I'm finishing up my gold farming right now, so I will have 4200 gold when the expansion comes out. Add to that the free pack from Tavern Brawl, another pack from Arena (reminder to start a run and stop playing once you reach 2 losses to get a RoS pack when the rotation happens!). No idea how many packs we get on launch, apart from the series of quests which should be 12 packs but I'll do my opening before finishing those.
---
So 44 packs to start with, then 12 more once I've done all the quests.
---
Nope.. We must be on the same server :)
---
My only golden legendary quest you will be missed (although ill probably try this out in Wild with the new murloc package)
---
What "support" do you want? People themselves can support the format by just playing it. The balance of the format is actually as good as Standard.
---
Vicious fledgling and stonehill defender were both right near the bottom too.
---
First legendary ever was Cairne Bloodhoof, still use him even though he’s really slow because I want to. First golden was lorewalker cho.
---
Yes, it was millhouse. I was so exited to try it in a game, then I got pyroblasted turn 2 :(
---
My brain read **F**an **o**f k**N**ives. I’m an idiot.
---
Mass disenchanting is step 1. Manually dusting the "extra" is step 2.
---
Why would you waste so many deck slots to get that many (slightly more) random cards instead of just playing the cards you want?
---
Well, at least this time there's a global release! The expansion will release on all servers simultaneously in 5.5 hours from now.
---
If you'll be asleep by then you'll have something to look forward to when you wake up tomorrow :)
---
Using a VPN to change your country of origin to purchase packs at a cheaper rate was def a bannable offense in other games. I'll directly open a ticket and ask since you feel the urge to be rude AF about it.
---
You had to make that 29 card deck however from half the collection however, which meant more card diversity
---
Brian Kibler has brought this up numerous times on his streams and Omni/ videos, as well as offering multitudes of solutions, but Blizzard seems content to stick with it and nobody else really pushes for it too much
---
Every good linguist advices against using useless "Oxford comma".
---
Lol same I crafted Sylvanas as my first crafted leg and then 2 weeks later found it golden, oh well she turned into rag :D
---
I started up playing again after kotft and I tried not bothering crafting it. So it only felt bad getting it played against me
---
My most "one-turn"-ed minion - I don't think I ever had a Lich King last longer.
---
Get to smashing that button or borrowing a computer...
---
I would say "computer or iPad" but Heartstone's history with Apple products leads me to not steer anyone toward an iPad to improve their Heartstone experience.
---
Did you drop your brain somewhere ?? When we pay them bulk amount of money... we expect some rewards from them !! , this game isnt all about paying player... majority of players here are free to play 
---
Well , how does asking for a proper reward make me a begger ??
---
Also it doesn't even go back into your hand, which would be good. It's just destroyed.
---
At the same time, such a system would cause standard to always be on the same level of power rather than varying between lowered power, lower synergy and high power, hyper synergistic. It's the difference between varying your speed from forty to one hundred miles per hour and always going at one hundred miles an hour.
---
Plus, stuff like the Death Knights would stick around ever longer after they've overstayed their welcome.
---
To me the distinction is whether it has no actual effect if condition isn't met or not. If it still somewhat functions then it's only a soft deck building restriction.
---
No but 12 free packs from quests which is probably the most ever? Could be wrong.
---
What a rambling, incoherent comment. Did you drop your brain somewhere?
---
I think psychic scream is fine, just too good with mass hysteria. Divine Favor was my number one!
---
I'll miss him!
---
Yea I play since Naxx and still haven´t opened a golden legendary. :D
---
I know people who played for one expansion and got one. Really unlucky with that. But I also started using the pitytracker page several expansions ago and it took me 4 expansions to get on the average rate of legendaries. So I think I´m just really unlucky with those in general.
---
But at least I got more epics than the average which is nice. :D
---
It's funny because this expansion has a ton of value cards, relatively few aggro cards, but no AOE, so that of course means we're probably gonna go head first into an aggro meta. This should be an indication to the devs that this game is just naturally catered to aggro and that they either have to change some fundamental things, or have to make sure there are a ton of anti-aggro tools each expansion, because aggro only needs a few cards to utterly dominate, because it's so strong to start off with.
---
He was very very strong
---
That’s fine if you’re considering multiple options. If you literally have only one possible play, and rope just because the mechanics/rules of the game technically allow it (to account for situations in which other players might have to decide between options) you’re an asshole who enjoys wasting both peoples time.
---
Where are you from??
---
KIND
---
Okay i dint knew we are getting 12 packs !! 
---
That balances things alot
---
F
---
I went the whole block without crafting him………
---
An epic card that was nerfed cuz it was "too op" and carried an unique archetype that had bad and good matchups should be unplayable? Wild is all about variety and there are more than 3 decks you can play that have no rexar cuz you can have infinit value with more than 1 deck and turn 4 10/10+ stats are normal...
---
Murloc and control shaman, I got the full class cards from the preorder lol
---
69 packs haha #12btw
---
People do, blizzard feels that changing the classic set is bad, if players leave and come back.
---
Friendly reminder to wait before you disenchant any extra or golden cards in case they end up being nerfed for a fat dust refund
---
thats what the numbers say
---
Fungalmancer and Keleseth can burn
---
You’re right
---
Finally. A counter to the rogue turn 1 coin, coin, prep, 8/8 Van Cleef.
---
name a more iconic duo
---
No, I'm not :p But I suppose some bots might also reply like that, so...
---
I am absolutely dominating that deck with Dragon control priest right now. Psychic scream and Kabal Shadowpriest away their win conditions.  I also included Vargoth for that extra win condition on my mind blasts.
---
&gt; Sunreaver Warmage
---
Man, I had such a brainfart right there. What the hell is a "warmage", I thought. Is it, like, an outage, only for warm things? Does that mean there's a "coldage"? How have I never heard of this wor... ooooh, a **war***mage*!
---
Yeah, that makes more sense.

Is this some kind of April fools joke?
---
Good point. I always buy the packs with the wrong legendaries and epics in them.
---
I thought he was Uther’s son.
---
That's why basilisk is 1 hp, if he can be dealt with in many ways, he is not stupidly powerful.
---
Well running out of ans and calling people begger isnt a incoherent comment ??
---
Yeah, I think you're right (but I'm also not 100% sure).
---
Definitely the best free legendary we've gotten in a while. C'Thun and DS Rexxar being my favorites before him.
---
Imagine if Mage had Shadowstep.
---
0.  I've got studies so I have no time for games.
---
Gonna be 20-30 once I'm done 'cause that's all I could save up for.  I'm hyped about this set.
---
seems really effective even with my horrible version of inner fire combo priest running without shadow visions (which is rotating out anyway).
---
a couple of win streaks got me up to 17.
---
Also could be people are misjudging my deck cos it is a pretty heavy healing version (lots of battle cry healing effects or those that + health ro creatures) of this
---
https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/hazes-rastakhan-inner-fire-combo-priest/
---
If you don’t buy the adventure you can get more packs and the legendary is basically a new Wizbang, although if you like PvE content and that legendary go for it
---
Zoo is eternal
---
Shaman: Murloc Shaman. Google for a decent list.
---
Warrior: I used [Warshack's Fatigue Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRgvhR2RbPs). Pro tip: replace the Mogushan Wardens with Unpowered Steambots.
---
And yeah how will we get those 12 packs ??
---
Wasn’t exceed the Japanese name
---
You buff one card, every one else will bitch about why they're card didn't get buff. There's no winning for blizzard.
---
I know that you didn't say it was good, but even if you used pyromancer; that is a 4 mana spirit lash that needs 2 cards to activate.
---
Literally the top post stickied in the sub.
---
nothing only this doesnt activate \[\[mistwraith\]\]
---
Not a clue. But it's there.
---
That might be good, we will lose a lot of loved cards

4/3/5 | Whenever you play an Echo card, gain +1/+1.  
---
Only golden legendary I ever crafted is whizbang.
---
You only get 1600 dust sorry to say
---
Adding to this, you do not have to do well to reach a reward with a net worth over 150 gold, meaning that even if you spend gold you receive packs at a discount (assuming you do well enough to receive more than 50 gold)
---
yeah but my point was that deathrattle hunter worked because of a lot of activators and consistency but here your only real activator is nine lives
---
Yeah I dont get why they completely got rid of it. At least increase the amount of wins you need for a bonus to 5 or something.
---
Yeh thats my bad :/
---
I gotta at least *try* giving [[Glass Knight]] life steal and taunt. For the luls
---
Took me a sec to realize this was pre Innervate nerf
---
Shows how much we know!
---
Do you know what incoherent means? Crack open a dictionary.
---
Or do you want people to spoon-feed you information like Blizzard giving you free stuff?
---
If only you could Edwin
---
which one will you mis then?

Yeah
---
i have thought about this too , if the new adventure make me built deck to win then i'll use all the golds to get more packs btw thank you for your advice

Happens to the best of us mate

This argument makes no sense to me. Why wouldn't you just run both lol? Especially in a meta that's going to be low on AoE now.

Replying to this post.

I think the difficult part about designing cards like these is figuring out how to make them good/fun but not so overpowering that they're must-includes for a given archetype.  And as far as Standard goes, they naturally become better toward the end of a Standard year when there are more cards available.  
---
To me at least, I enjoyed playing with/against Kazakus.  It's a fun card (create your own spell) and strong, but not an insta-lose for the opponent.
---
If you were playing a tempo/face deck against a Reno deck, it just seemed like the game was decided entirely based upon the luck of the draw for one card.  Oh, they drew Reno?  Guess I lose.  
---
Facing a turn 2 Keleseth never felt nearly as disheartening as seeing a Reno to me.  It's strong, but there's still counterplay.
---
Here’s to hoping!! Lol
---
Pls contribute to my thief rogue dust fund ty blizzard

Thanks !  Nice gesture to the reddit community.

Always comment for free stuff
---
Merhaba!
---
You realise you can just look at the total winrate of decks with Geddon and decks without? You don't need to be stupid and look and the played winrate. The deck was just better off without Geddon although of course in some matchups it was good so if you wanted to tech your deck in that way it definitely had a place.
---
Hype
---
Awesome!
---
Sweet
---
Free packs let's goooooo!
---
I haven’t saved up any gold for this expansion. Hopefully this solves that problem
---
Here we go!
---
Good luck everyone
---
I really enjoy the community here, and I love that Blizz appreciates the work the mods here do for hype in the expansions.  Thanks Guys!
---
Ez win
---
WOOOOOOO
---
Luck don't fail me now.
---
Trying for a friend
---
hope i win cause im not gonna preorder anyway
---
Thank you so much for this event.
---
Would love to get some packs.
---
RNGesus take the wheel
---
Arrrrrrrrr!
---
I would like a shot
---
Gl everyone
---
Quickly start another one and leave it at 2 losses, you'll get a free Arena ticket and your usual reward when new set hits in less than 4 hours.
---
Also not sure why you would be spending gold with the new set so close.
---
Yes, I'm jealous. 11 wins? I wish that were me.
---
Seems cool! Thanks for the giveaway!
---
Same
---
Give me packs pls!
---
Usually yes, but there were some ocasion that the extra 4th slot came to people for the extra quests beyond the daylie normal ones. I think Blizz cut it out alrealdy, but I'm not sure. I have 2 quests in my log today, just want to be sure if I have to clean them up ou leaving only one empty slot will be enough to the special quests.
---

Pack me pls
---
No
---
Obligatory entry comment.
---
Mutate is pretty interesting with Swampqueen Hagatha though. On turn 7 instead of getting a 5/5 and the Horror in your hand, you can get a random 8 drop and the Horror in your hand. Which sounds a lot stronger.
---
Good Luck Everyone!
---
gimme

I reply to this post!

Alright, good luck everyone

Packz plz

Hoping I'm not too late to enter. I could really make use out of those sweet sweet packs.

Well, I've never won anything hearthstone related, but heres my lottery reply I guess. (10.3k comments, who am I kidding -.-)

Hoping for a fun year of the dragon!

50% of the time, I win every time

Please haha

I would agree but DK Rexxar, Fledgling and Keleseth have a special place in my heart. DK Rexxar made hunter fun, fledgling was funny to jam into midrange hunter/zoo decks and keleseth felt great to put in decks that he didn't always fit in, although I agree that he was definitely a poorly designed card.
---
Please be me

Nice! Small chances but it's still there.

That’s exactly what I was going for! :-D
---
I had been playing this deck with Greater Arcane Missiles instead of Pyroblast, but when I realized I could have 10 mana available on a turn I knew I had to go bigger.
---
I don't expect to win, but good luck to everyone!
---
Nice.
---
rolling
---
Nice
---
pllllllllllllllssssssssssssssssssss
---
RNG is good, great in fact for the game, but the peak has to be lower, keleseth on 2 = and instant +15% win chance was pretty bullshit. Reno was fun for a while, arguably still is in wild. The problem with Reno was that Blizzard decided the best way to balance the meta at the time was with pirate warrior - which turned the entire of ladder into draw reno by turn 6 and win, or don't and lose. Variation is what the playerbase craves, just because x happens, followed by y should not determine the outcome of the game. There was to be both room for RNG and room for skill to turn and match at almost any point.
---
It’s go time
---
Looking forward to the new expansion and even more so for the rotation!
---
If i win i’ll snipe kripp

Hello

---
hi
---
Well. Good luck everyone! May rng be on our side
---
you can basically add a 3 card win condition into any controllish shaman deck with this, which only gets countered by a 5 or more damage non targeted aoe.
---
since we do not know anything except his hand probably would have done the same, else if i know what i have in my deck i would considere playing glacial shard with the rest of the 1 drops + hero power.

The end is coming!

I wouldn’t mind having just Overfiend as epic cards deserve to have unique effects, but a 4 mana version seems like lazy design.

Now what did i post that offended you so much if I may ask?

Non-legend rarities generally only matter for arena.  There may be no other reason than the statline of the epic is better for arena.

Confessions? Alright. I played Pogo rogue and made it work. Insta-win against control and combo. A lot of survivial tools to stand aggro. Granted, it was extremely janky and extremely grindy, and had to be played perfectly to win. Also, the matches were absurdly long (&gt;20 min).
---
My prediction? Pogos are getting a lot worse without key cards such as Valeera, Elven Ministrel and Evasion. It's probably a good thing they are not viable anymore because we don't want jade golems all over again. But I'm kinda troubled they are still pushing 'infinite value Rogue' via Academic Espionage, Tess, and that OP lifesteal weapon. Wanna take your bets on how long till it inevitably gets nerfed?
---
Doesn’t work because magnetic doesn’t trigger “when x dies” effects
---
So if I have just 1 Gloom I’ll get the dust for 2 copies? I don’t need to craft the second to get the full refund?
---
Always worth the preorder.  It’s a lot of fun opening up and playing with new toys on day 1. 
---
It’s a great way to not pay attention to soccer games and ballet lessons. Worth every penny.
---
Dumb to write in GMT when almost everyone in GMT is in daylight savings time.
---
Wotg and naxx are the expansions that made me play the game and buy packs in it. The most fun ive had playing hs.
---
No? Some of the cards that were released on rhastakan for example are useful and not even close to the power lvl of the KotfT or K&amp;C
---
Famous for creating a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board.

Stay in school kids.

---
Does anyone know when the single player content releases, and can you buy it with gold?
---
That would weird me out. Weird me out real good, yup.
---
So, Genn and Baku should not have been inducted into the Hall of Fame because the Boomsday Project and Rastakhan's Rumble were purposely designed conservatory?
---
You might be able to surprise people early in the meta but if a Chef Nomi deck ever became somewhat popular every control deck will hold onto an AoE(brawl, haggathas scheme, twisting nether, mass hysteria). And any aggro deck would never know about your Chef Nomi shenanigans. 
---
Sure, you could pull that off on turn seven sometimes but what's more likely is that you'll be holding onto a dead card when you could be running a better card. 
---
I really like the idea of a myracle Chef Nomi deck but I'm having a hard time believing that card slot isn't better filled by even just a coldblood.
---
Read this guide: https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/hearthstone-standard-rotation-schedule-guide/
---
Yeah I'm sorry I usually accept friends requests and definitely don't flame anyone, but I don't think I'd accept one from a mill rogue. The whole point of mill rogue seems to be to tilt people.
---
That card alone was the reason it was the only token deck in the meta.
---
Dont think so btw do u know when will update hit?
---
I had reg Baku but did up a gold genn. I'll take the free dust.
---
Naturally.
---
48 mins from now.
---
OMG you called it
---
37 minutes, I think.
---
Weird, I hear the same complaint about a certain paladin draw card, yet that hall of fame is being celebrated.
---
I showed this to my wife, and she goes, "Oh no, my taunts!"
---
Do you think she'll be good? As an avid control shammy player, I am not sold yet.
---
Yeah thats nice.
---
This is so frustrating cuz in real life we only have 1hour difference with UK
---
They'll be gone in an hour you goof
---
6 health is much more difficult to kill. 2 health is easily killed by 1-2 mana minions.
---
I don't agree that they needed to be moved to the HoF, but at the same time I think it is a healthy change to make considering they were so dominant. 
---
Balancing the card pool around those cards is definitely a problem.  It's do-able but it's a task that would have really hamstrung the dev team and things would probably slip through the cracks anyway to require more nerfs.
---
Literally what got me to Legend during Un'goro
---
Yeah in HS tempo implies fast but don't think there's anything wrong in saying slow tempo to describe a slow card/deck, as it's not incorrect and no reason to be pedantic about it.
---
Options, assuming you intend to disenchant your wild cards, starting at 1 non-gold Gloom Stag:
---
Craft another (-400), get refund (+800), DE both (+200) -&gt; net +600 dust.
---
Craft gold (-1600), get refund (+2000), DE both (+500) -&gt; net +900 dust.
---
Craft two gold (-3200), get refund (normal one will be ignored) (+3200), DE all (+900), net +900 dust.
---
From one Baku:
---
Do nothing (0), get refund (+1600), DE (+400), net +2000 dust.
---
Craft golden (-3200), get refund (normal one will be ignored) (+3200), DE both (+4000), net +4000 dust.
---
Yeah. I went with Amazon coins. Which is what I'll do for the next expansion and the one after. I figure by the last expansion, I won't have to buy the $81 coin package.
---
The reason I'm glad they are being hall of famed isn't because of the power level but more to do with how consistent the decks are. Because hero power is used so much, every game feels the same when you are against them.
---
nah

Oh ya the silverware was annoying for me, that and chromaggus gave me the most trouble.
---
I always thought he was wearing a hat
---
This looks like every arena experience I've ever had
---
Yep, will be full of "Yeah I'm playing the most greedy value deck I could possibly come up with and these dirty shaman/pallies/whatever are killing me on turn 5 they're so cancer."
---
Thank you.
---
I think he meant it in the "all Asian look the same" sense
---
I’ve already read that. It doesn’t solve my problem of only having a single copy of the epics. Idk if it’s worth to just craft 1 golden or disenchant and then craft 2 Golden’s. All these guides only reference having a full playset or having no copies at all.
---
HYPE BOIIIISS
---
Sorry, if it was a joke, you wouldn't be directing the jab at the person.
---
Also, psychic scream is part of the reason even pally was the only token deck in the meta xD Odd pally can burn through 2-4 screams with the hero power and still maybe win. Token druid gets wrecked by 1 scream 90% of the time.
---
Good god this sub after Shudderwock was released. I get that he was incredibly annoying with the animation length, but people were acting like the rapture or something was occurring.
---
I think it's because each expansion is remembered for its oppressive cards. There was lots of fun stuff in there too.

I don't know why Blizzard would use GMT for Europe, almost all countries are either using BST, CEST, EET at this time of the year.
---
Is this only druid card or is it universal
---
You can't buy them with money anymore, gold only now.
---
The moment Genn and Baku started seeing play, I knew they wouldn't last in their current state.
---
Yea probably. Has a lot of tools at its disposal now and other classes have lost a lot. Or I could be bias because I pulled a golden Hagatha and now I'm going to play it regardless. Here's to hoping
---
I've only got one friend request from anyone that didn't spam me with slurs then block me, and that was because we had a fun 45+ minute game. It's also much much worse above rank 10. I almost never got them when I was at lower rank. Where do people get these nice messages?
---
Thank you! This is the first time it ever made sense to me. It’s hugely appreciated!!
---
You wasted much more dust by dusting rotating cards.
---
Look at all these legendaries!
---
I did the same thing, and second-guessed myself the entire time.
---
You were not alone, brother.
---
Aye. Gotta love those legendary dust refunds. Free lego.
---
How does rarity except for legendary matter for arena?
---
I know that this may be somthing new for you, but tech cards are used even with a low power level, cuz u dont use them for how strong they are, but to beat the meta
---
I put pre nerfed giggling inventor in all of my decks and I even made a deck where I can play unlimited of them.
---
I stepped away from the game around the beginning of KoFT.  I basically disenchant every card I get for every class except Rogue and Druid so I can play most of the decks in those two classes with minimal time or money invested.
---
So basically I am looking forward to playing some cheaper Rogue/Druid decks while I wait for the meta to settle and I can dump my dust into them.
---
They're definitely both female Tauren and look extremely similar. The hair colors could easily be the same, but the one on the right could look lighter because of the reflection from the flash of light. The armor is definitely a different color but that could also be because of lighting, but they are both wearing the same shoulder pieces.
---
???  If I only play standard why keep cards that are rotating?
---
Yeah, that was not fun and interactive at all.
---
"you will be missed" possed will be missed
---
Sonya was an awesome card. I dont blame her for being a centrepiece in the only deck I've ever wanted deleted from the game.
---
Yes, i play mill druid on wild with cho, oracles, mukla, dancing Blades + n'zoth and yesterday i tried him, it's not that ideal since the second natutalize is random and more of often than not it kills itself but draw 4 when he has 8 or 9 cards is worth, also if he survives he is a must kill.
---
Craft one golden one but it might be too late now
---
Everybody is talking about miracle scenarios where shuddy gives something epic but I am pretty sure that I'll get totemic might+mutate every fucking time.
---
Overall I think I did well on my 130 packs. I got 9 legendaries from them so I averaged 1 every 14 packs. Add that to the 3 I got for free and I've already gotten over half of the 23.
---
I'll open more later today to open the rest of the legendaries.
---
I didn't received my Shadow Bundle while I just preordered it (via google play). I guess these things happen with the server being overloaded, but does someone else have the same issue?
---
That's very strange, since they removed the other HOF cards from the classic packs (at least with previous rotations). Try sending a bug report to Blizzard.
---
Yea I’ll get another 10 when I get back home today. Opened mine last Friday, it was the first packs I ever purchased but I’ve been only playing since Nov last year.
---
38 here.
---
I got 10
---
10 packs...got two legendaries. Tak Zozwhisker (Rogue) and Jepetto Joybuzz (Neutral)
---
Tell me what to think /r/hearthstone...
---
Do y'all not see that there's a dedicated thread for pack opening screenshots?
---
These are awesome
---
There have been reports that HoF Witchwood cards still show up in packs, unlike the ones moved from the classic set. Getting a duplicate Genn or Baku probably shares a root cause.
---
I'd suggest keeping the duplicate and contacting support after the bug has been officially acknowledged and addressed. Perhaps they can offer some form reimbursement.
---
then u got luckier
---
Same for me.
---
If you didn't get money until today, you do not get to buy the preorder pack.
---
Huh? I only got 1 quest that gave me a RoS and Witchwood pack. That was it.
---
I opened four packs and have five copies of Never Surrender already. This must be bugged.
---
apparently 1
---
We should have gotten a free legendary. And that doesn’t include varrgoth. Blizzard is just slowly making this game more and more expensive. It appears that they moved the free class legendary only to the pre orders.
---
Opened 148 packs and got 10 legendaries excluding the free ones you get with both bundles
---
Easily the luckiest release date thus far for me. Good luck to everyone else! 
---
Add me if you wanna mess around with home brew ridiculous ideas!
---
Went from 18000 to zero in an instant.
---
Blizzard logic
---
You're joking right? What about this is even a funny joke?
---
No, it’s actually quite strong. Especially when paired with Dr. Boom hero.
---
A legend (for the symbols) would make me happy. ....  I was trying to figure out what the upside down "T" was - epic?  Then I realized you used different coloured pens! lol!
---
Did you get an epic packs 4 and 16?  I thought the pity timer wouldn't allow more than 10 packs between epics.
---
Happy with your cards?
---
Boom scheme to balance this pack
---
After a horrible opening session last expansion I think karma caught up. 7 legendaries in 49 packs with a golden Keeper Stalldris
---
Check your collection, you get it, it just doesn't pop up unless you re-log in.
---
Could this be the most useless reddit post in Reddit's history?
---
You mean the free legendary that we got...
---
Just wait until Betrug+Plot Twist Control Warlock becomes a meta deck and then you'll feel silly
---
Downvoted for ableism
---
35 packs
---
4 legends - Lucentbark, RAFAAM, Boom, Golden Togwaggle
---
13 epics - No extras, 2 golden (omega and the 2/2 copy a deathrattle)
---
They also decided to use Echo after witchwood, which is the entire point of this discussion.
---
not this time
---
123 packs. Megabundle, $10 add-on, 3300 gold dump into packs
---
7 leggies counting the gold Rhyssa:
---
Obliv, barista, Kali, Nosy, boom, swamp.
---
16k dust. 
---
Priest main, will be crafting gold Lazul, possibly gold muerte. 
---
I wish you all luck and will see you on the battlefield!
---
That is exactly why I'm not disenchanting anything 🧙🏻‍♂️
---
But Vargoth is actually good while Marin and a random is most probably 2 bad legendaries. I really rather have the 1 guaranteed good one.
---
I got 4 in 26 packs, then nothing in the next 26.
---
It's obvious now! Booms *REAL* scheme is to remove all other warriors from the game!
---
"You will/won't be missed posts".... you won't be missed.
---
Over the next days you'll get the other quests that give packs.
---
Couldn't you disenchant Hall of famers for full value as well before?  
---
also I just got a Glitter moth in the pack from my quest, didn't get dust for it though, should they still be in packs? something seems wrong here.
---
Bought 49 packs with gold, plus 1 from the tavern brawl. Opened three legendaries: both Hunters (in the same pack even) and Catrina Muerte.
---
I think it’s super disappointing not to be able to get these packs today. Means I can’t start crafting epics etc because I have 5 more days!!! of waiting to open new packs.
---
Ah... didnt think of that.
---
Again, the bucket system should normalise this, and in some cases even help these classes. All classes will be offered bad cards at an even rate, no matter how many they have.
---
Playing Trump’s theorycrafted silence Priest. Extremely fun.
---
I wonder if potion vendor will be problematic, because it has BONKERS playability.
---
Just regular logic? Can't pre-order so etching once it is out. You can still buy 80 packs of cards for cash.
---
That’s interesting! I can see that Gloomstag doesn’t have the WW symbol in the pic—probably just a bug then
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/WlTcqhy got it anyway
---
I got lucky and got Kalecgos out of the free pack, had 1800 gold saved up and got ~20k dust from disenchanting all rotating cards. It sucks being a f2p player in this case but I'm okay with just waiting a few weeks and then crafting 2 or 3 meta decks. I think Inner Fire Priest is gonna be quite cheap so I'm looking forward to that.
---
Nice. I got a golden Nomi smh
---
huh, why that?
---
The new secret that gives +2 health is really, really strong against classes like Rogue and Mage, can save early minions from a Backstab, Cinderstorm, etc.  Basically, if you can whether the initial assault, Secret Pal is basically dead in the water by Turn 9/10.
---
Smart move! But even though I think Betrug is better than people say, I definitely wouldn't blame you if you disenchanted him for a legendary you're more confident about.
---
No, it's a client-wide bug happening. I'm assuming they messed something up when trying to ban non-classic cards and messed it all up.
---
I couldn't decide on golden since highlighters hid the color. The upside down T is my golden and the rest is color-coded lol
---
Right now I think so. 5 legs in 82 is slightly better than 1 in 20 (after the guaranteed leg in the first 10, it's 4 in 78). I have gold to spend but it'll have to wait.
---
I just opened 76 packs and only got 2 legendaries.  I bought both bundles and opened those on Saturday and opened 7 legendaries.  So out of 206 packs I got 9 legendaries.  This was the worst pack opening I’ve had by far.  7 legendaries, 45 epics.
---
Barfola, no wonder they've kept that from being visible so far.
---
Or you couldve saved gold like some of us and opened 50+ packs brotha
---
That's so raven
---
The wiki says that HoF cards can only be crafted 
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Hall_of_Fame
---
But maybe WW will be different!
---
If you include anything beyond the immediate meta (whether that be ended by a new expansions or nerfs), you're no longer making predictions that are anywhere near as educated. So much can change with just a single nerf or a single card that it's nearly meaningless to judge a card's potential out of context.
---
I think the game may be telling me to play Druid for the next 4 months
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/HxqlzGH
---
If we stop preordering then they will lower prices.....
---
Dude its the E.V.I.L. eye 
---
:p
---
That's not the only thing. There are going to be THOUSANDS more people logging in, purchasing items, opening packs, creating billions of new decks, etc etc. All of that takes processing power and that's a HUGE server load. It's not just "new cards to buy".
---
I don't  think you get the full dust now of you disenchanted since they did this.
---
Its client-wide. The entire subreddit is filled with reports of even getting the new standard HoF cards in packs.
---
Kripparian, Regis killbin, trump(hearthstone), brian kibler. Etc
---
77 packs and got 2 legendaries.
---
I'm not, but if you don't have less than 80 dollars on your bank account at the end of the paycheck than you shouldn't be buying an 80 dollar fucking game.
---
So nice of Blizz to immortalize the year of the raven!
---
Eyeball
---
Got lucky with 3 in 25, too nlbad none of them are ones I plan on using
---
I didn't try to preorder it when it was out? I tried to preorder it before it was out. And buying 80 packs is way more expensive and you don't get a golden legendary + new character
---
I'm predicting theif or lackey rogue to be quite good &amp; fun, &amp; I got Tak &amp; Tog in my packs 🧙🏻‍♂️🧙🏻‍♂️🧙🏻‍♂️🎉
---
Deck codes seem to be broken. All of them turn into wild decks, even if it contains no wild cards. This happening for anyone else?
---
Shouldn’t there be a a guaranteed legendary in your first 10 packs? Or was that an expansion specific thing?
---
Yeah. Wasn't saying you're wrong for doing it or something. Just noting a stark difference in our Heartstone spending habits.  :-)
---
PS... I'm sure glad you caught that tavern brawl pack.  XD
---
You didn't own Genn or Baku...?
---
Is this baguette or tapas?
---
No? It's pretty good?
---
hungry crab meta
---
Yup you got it. Check your slot. I also got 25 gold. It doesn't pop up separately.
---
I didn't receive a gift legendary. Was I supposed to?
---
Chef nomi on first pack, oh boy
---
I think their legendary % drop is busted or either unlucky. Decided to give a 40 cards pack a shot for a try. Took an other 40. It's really rare to hit pity timer this much. Some other friends are also getting the same thing.
---
Unless we're like 5 people really unlucky something feels off.
---
Do you really only get 1 free pack this expansion...? I swear back in Un'Goro/Gadgetzan they gave you like 6 lmao
---
Is the pre purchase legendary supposed to pop up right away? i didn't get one till i opened up the first 10 packs
---

Opened 131 packs got 10 legendaries  
---
Keeper Stalladris, Oblivitron, Vereesa Windrunner, Tak Nozwhisker, Scargill, Swampqueen Hagatha, Fel Lord Betrug, The Boom Reaver, Barista Lynchen, Archivist Elysiana.  
---
The other 2 free legendaries from the pre-order were Commander Rhyssa and golden Jepetto Joybuzz.  
---
Didnt get Dr Boom or Rafaam but I wont complain lol.
---
Which site is it happening for, or is the origin of the deck-code irrelevant?
---
[With this amount of dust I can craft pretty much any deck here.](https://gyazo.com/66005e2b6dca5e3c127114a617019251)
---
I do want to see if there are some Tempo Secret Paladins going on, I think it has potential. Also I'm almost certain Murloc Shaman is going to be a thing.
---
It might be too early to tell, but did you watch Kripp's video showcasing arena drafts for 8/9 classes? Priest seems really strong.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Z75J-EIEk
---
Also take a look at this updated arena tierlist: https://www.heartharena.com/tierlist
---
70 packs 4 legendaries. Could be worse I guess.

---
Boomshakala that's a lot of dust. Regrettably I already had too many of the cards rotating so I couldn't profit by crafting em golden.
---
I now have 30k dust.
---
If you like Warlock, then Godfrey is a must have.
---
Tess is for memey fun with Espionage Rogue. Might get better with the new RoS cards but aside from that it's just for fun shenanigans. We'll have to see how good Thief Rogue gets, but if it is, then she will surely be a part of it.
---
Shaw is a very good card that doesn't have a deck to go with. Part of the problem is that he has major anti-synergy with Master's Call. So while he is good in a bubble, I would not recommend crafting him until he starts showing up in more decks.
---
Might be too early to tell for Rafaam, Rhyssa, and Catrina, but I doubt you would have any major regrets if you want to spend some dust, as they all seem pretty serviceable.
---
I'll personally be trying out Blastermaster Boom and the new bomb package myself. It's a bit risky since we don't know how well it will perform, but as a Warrior main I'm sure that I'll have fun either way.
---
The question is would you rather have them roll another random epic for you or just disenchant this one to get any regular epic you want? Personally I’d choose the latter
---
I believe it's supposed to be the Sunreaver Warmage.
---
Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. I was the final boss for a a few people for rank 5. I was playing a meme odd priest deck. Was hoping to make some friends. I caught maybe like 2 out of 5
---
I think the solo adventure will need to be paid for.
---
Sure, I saved 7.5k and I´m going to spend 5k and keep gold for pve.
---
Hi all, 
---
I help Toast run his website, especially the Top Decks from Players and Streamers series at the beginning of each expansion (something we've been doing for a few years now). If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please do let us know!
---
Thanks and have a great Year of the Dragon!
---
5160 dust.... I'm speechless.
---
Alternatively, people *underestimated* how good Keleseth on 2 was. It was nearly a guaranteed win. When you weigh this against missing your 2-drop a lot (not that bad in Rogue anyway), it's a great card that we just whiffed on.
---
&lt;3
---
Everybody gets that Archmage Vargoth card for free.  I believe you get another free legendary if you preordered the expansion.
---
So it seems that the Hearthpwn decklists aren't being picked up, but Vicious Syndicate is. Very strange.
---
I didn’t know jade druid was in standard last year
---
And so once again people realize that the legendary rates from packs are ridiculously low and end up regretting their pre-order. Oh what fun the Hearthstone cycle is.
---
Did you preorder?
---
That should be a bug... take the value while you can!
---
I took kalygos had nothing good for yshaarj
---
Don't feel bad, got regular nomi from the $50 bundle. I'll live with him for now lol.
---
3 in 39/82 so far... Yeesh

---
I always tell myself to wait a week or two, don't, and then it feels bad. So I would wait.
---
I'm quite sceptical about that.
---
Did you got 4800 dust refund for a golden and regular Baku?
---
Sorry about the server issues folks, we're working on it. Thanks for the continued support! - Hearthstone Top Decks
---
I pre-purchased both bundles.  From the smaller one, I got Fel Lord Betrug.  From the larger one, I got a golden Commander Rhyssa.
---
I got Keeper Stalladris, Madame Lazul, Golden Heistbaron Togwaggle, Tak Nozwhisker, Scargill, Swampqueen Hagatha, Arch-Villain Rafam, The Boom Reaver, Barista Lynchen, Chef Nomi, and Jepetto Joybuzz.
---
108 packs opened.
---
45 packs, 2 legendaries.
---
Good thing I only saved up gold. 
---
This is not the way to get me back to spend money on this Blizzard.
---
I can literally buy a new fullprice game for the amount of money that gets me about 10% of 1 of 3 expansions in a year.
---
And I just opened the Murkspark Eel
---
My logic was that one of the five is guaranteed within the first 10 packs, then the subsequent 4 in the remaining 160 packs means 1 in every 40 packs, but you're right I must be close to another one
---
Bad luck
---
same! gonna be hard to keep my finger off that button for a week until the “dust” settles and it becomes apparent what is a worthy craft.
---
though after facing three murloc shamans in a row and getting absolutely blasted out of the water, i am sad i opened none of the shaman legends... Hagatha looks so fun but i ain’t gonna do it just yet...
---
You have the rewards, you just don’t get a notification for them
---
Still pretty pathetic if ou ask me. A new rotation with a new year and we get 5 packs. More than underwhelming.
---
What is this, a gif for ants?
---
Seems like blizzard went the extra stingy route this expansion. No class legendary, and the quests are gated to one per day. 12 packs isn't as generous as it seems when it's spread out through out the week, and half of them won't even be from rise of shadows
---
Quick my friend, buy a lottery ticket!
---
Same here.
---
&gt;You sound like a 16 year old whos never worked a job in his life.
---
You use terms like "butthurt lmao" and think "doing your job is going the extra mile *especially* when self-employed" 
---
Projecting much?
---
Golden Nozari! Pretty lit to try and make a Dragon Pally work
---
spam murlocs, just spam. You refill it with 2mana murloc 2/3 which gives you murloc to hand if you play murloc.
---
4mana dude which makes your murlocs cost 1, spell which gives your minions deathrattle "summon 1/1 murloc" and just aggro things like doomhammer, lava shocks etc
---
Honestly I would like 1600 dust, it went to hall of fame. Maybe they could be generous
---
Weird flex but okay well played
---
It’s simple, I get Barnes in my opening hand and play him. I summon, blood of the ancient one. Bring him back, play him again, get another blood. FOOL! It’s the only other minion in the deck!
---
50 bundle: got Nomi XD.
---
I want to report people who rope, especially when they are WINNING THE GAME ALREADY.
---
Soooo adjacent?

:(

5/5/5 | Battlecry: Shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck. When drawn, it explodes for 5 damage.

The de value isnt full, they give you the dust directly, and the de value is unaffected
---
You do get full dust. But if you have multiples then it only gives you dust for two, prioritizing goldens. If you have a golden and a normal legendary then you only get the full dust for the golden copy.
---
It's really underrated. Yes decks are random, but if your a F2P player you get those legendary cards in your deck. I tested this card last month, and (im pretty bad tbh) I got to rank 10-11 with it and stayed consistently in that rank. I think it will be more valuable at the start of this month, with the new expansion since everyone is still crafting cards as well.
---
More like calling out idiocy. But uhh sure, whatever you said.
---
I hate you.
---
Hearthpwn never works for me (the copy button). I have to do the "Print Text String" and copy paste it from there.
---
Oblivitron, Nomi, and Recruit-A-Mech guy.
---
Yay?
---
52 packs, only 2 legendaries..... Feels bad man
---
oh no, appreciating someone who does a job, how terrible... I can see how you were harmed... :(
---
Woo got Togwaggle as my pre-order Golden Legendary. Now to craft golden Rafaam.
---
Good news is you can go to your Hall Of Fame and dust that butterfly  and any other useless (most of em if you don't play wild) for another 6k
---
wtf I hate hearthstone now
---
BTW first loss to a topdeck pyroblast, yeet
---
This card is instrumental in my Cthun Shudderwock deck
---
This is the first expansion this has happened. Them "being a business" hasn't stopped them before.
---
No, everyone receives that one regardless of if you pre ordered or not. However, if you did pre order you are given another one based off of which tier you pre ordered... the 80$ bundle is a golden legendary and the $50 bundle is a regular legendary.
---
Trump and WowHobbs
---
12 packs
---
In all honesty, the Remix made it a really enjoyable song.  
---
I have to say that Arthus was his best work, but nothing had me more hype for an expansion than constantly humming Ungoro while working.
---
ODD IS OUT
---
LIKE NAXXX
---
How does Toki work in Arena now? Does she give cards from wild or from the sets that aren’t draft able in arena?
---
22 packs, 2 legendaries, 6 copies of vicious scraphound
---
When does the single player content release?
---
Could only get 30 packs as i focused on dust (18k rn Pog) this expac but i got 3 legendaries out of it! Above average result and i am more than happy.
---
Pulled: Commander Rhyss, Oblivitron, Madam Lazul
---
Ahaa!
---
Thats still ridiculous.
---
Wow, 118 packs 4 legendaries, and exclusively garbage epics.  I guess I just won't play any fun decks.
---
i know it's not rise of shadows, but it's from the mission "play 25 cards"
---
i think something it's strange here, shall i contact someone at blizz? 
---

Don't do it my friend.
---
You didnt, actually. I said that it was strong until the nerf of highlander priest 2 months after the release of catacombs which definitely dont count. And you used sources from 2017 when the nerf didnt happen. If you cant prove my point wrong dont embarass yourself
---
don't think it's a bug, saw another post saying it's one quest per day
---
off topic but dr boom gonna be more disgusting than dk rexxar
---
Sorry fam. 5 in 52 here.
---
Here are my stats on today's pack openings:
---
**$149.77 spent** (2 pre-order bundles, shadow bundle) 
---
**236 packs opened** \- 130 from both pre-order bundles, 1 from tavern brawl, 9 from shadow bundle, 96 from in-game gold.
---
**1180 cards from packs + 2 """free""" legendaries** from pre-order bundles.
---
**8060 dust** from 924(!!) duplicates. 732 dup. commons, 185 dup. rares, 7 dup. epics.
---
**Missing cards: 11 epics, 10 legendaries.**
---
**Total cost to craft missing cards: 4,400 for epics + 16,000 for legendaries = 20,400 total** (12,340 more than gained from duplicates)
---
**Approx. additional packs needed to complete expansion: 200** (average legendary card rate = 1 every 20 packs, not considering dust value from duplicates)
---
**Dollar value of packs needed to complete expansion: approx. $250-$300** (depending on size of bundles bought)
---
**Predicted cost to obtain full expansion: approx. $400-$450**
---
Sorry, maybe I should have my glasses but by the looks of things we're getting 12 packs, not 5.
---
uh nooo.
---
because the new expansion cards generally suck or are boring.
---
also, what's more important for an old game like hearthstone? the history of the game or "new stuff."
---
Discord
---
I had the game open on my phone for half an hour before the release launched. I haven't tried to get back on though yet after opening my packs.
---
Is Pathra an actual player? I clicked her stream randomly and she had some guy telling her every move to make and she just agreed with it, didn’t seem like she was on the same level as these top players?
---
If that were true they'd double the prices on everything to make double the money. But they don't do that because either or both of you assumptions is false (most money comes from whales, whales don't care about pricing).
---

What

But devilsaur is different. If you summon it, you can hit face.

You have a great day as well.

Good to know, will give him a try, thanks for the tips!

This sucks. I use Stonehill Defender a lot. Such a great card.

4/5/3 Pirate | Overkill: Draw 2 cards.

I think it’s because the goal is to summon two of them with Khadgar, therefore you have two cannons like Blastoise
---
At 8:30 they had only 9 peoples watching BTW.
---
Okay, I suppose I can't hinder you if you are that determined. I hope you find some other game that brings you joy!
---
\&gt;Are you telling me a business running a free-to-play game actually wants me to invest real money on a product? I feel cheated.
---
No one knows for certain
---
clearly this is not your home, invader
---
Sorry, what? 😅
---
Okay, really good: 77 Packs, 4 legendaries, 1 golden legendary, all but 3 commons.    
---
I'm done with this expansion, saving for the next one.
---
Enjoying Portal Frog Shaman
---
Hey Nightstrike_, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
Yeah 1 golden as well..couldn't believe it considering my luck 2 days ago
---
The worst part was opening packs. There was about a 30-60+ second delay before buying and opening packs. I only had 30 to open, I can’t imagine the frustration of those with 100+ packs to open...
---
Man it’s so weird seeing these decks post-rotation, the power level spiked. It’s pretty cool though, they successfully unpowercreeped the game.
---
I let out an eek when my opponent eked out an answer
---
As soon as this blatently overpowered card gets nerfed, I'm set.
---
https://gyazo.com/e0788250ffb7e8c0196447dab3601a0b
---
Opened 51 packs for reference, got 7 dr boom's scheme
---
iirc it guarantees a legendary in 40 packs
---
Cluck in the box and select all then copy thst way, the cooy button never works for me on mobile
---
5 from this event  
---
1 from tavern brawl  
---
3 from first wing of solo content
---
Is 9 packs about average of the past few expansions? Obviously missing the legendary as well.
---
Used to work for me all time time. I'll give it a try.
---
I went 34 packs, and didn't get one. idk, shit seems off.
---
Well rastakhans I got the shaman package, for nights of the fro I got the druid dk, for witchwood, I got something. Idk
---
I dust the obviously trash legendaries and epics that I think will never ever see play no matter how the meta changes. So far it hasn't burned me yet. 
---
I don't bother with rares and commons though, not enough dust to be worth it.
---
You got no scheme cards?O.o
---
Legit sames. 94 packs, 3 legendaries. wtf blizz
---
Fucking finally. Someone that isnt an idiot
---
He has some cards for the jade lotus
---
Murloc Shaman is busted, srsly did Blizzard forget to test that?
---
Togwaggle, Rafaam, Boom, and Lucentbark. I'm in team "Blow up the city, but keep off the grass."
---
They need the f2p crowd to keep the game active for whales, genius.
---
Rofl.
---
But it was the final hours of year of raven though
---
My opponent had a Lotus agent in his hand, which, since it's a rouge/druid/shaman card, he can draft it and it also counts for the "card from another class" leading to garbage like this in Arena
---
You knew what you signed up for man cmon
---
This morning I dusted all the cards going to wild and crafted as many golden cards going to HOF. I'm sitting at 15k dust :D
---
I've already found greener pasture, just kinda sticking around to see what's going on, checking out the new cards. The usual "THIS IS 2 STRONG" threads made by people who absolutely have zero idea what the hell they're talking about.
---
Minion Masters is filling some weird void I didn't know was there. It's halfway between a MOBA with lane control and hearthstone with the deckbuilding parts.
---
Like, if Slay The Spire and League of Legends had a kid, Minion Masters would be it.

In knights and kobolds i got one legendary. I pretty much stopped playing standard after that. Yesterday I made a drunken impulse buy of 50 packs. With 13 extra packs from gold and 1 freebie I got 7 legendaries. I was pretty much about to quit playing for good if I had another terrible pack-opening session. They're not all good ones but I'm feeling more incentivized to play again. The ones I got:   
---
- [[Chef Nomi]]    
---
- [[Khadgar]]    
---
- [[Nozari]]    
---
- [[Arch-Villain Rafaam]]   
---
- [[Commander Rhyssa]]   
---
- [[Oblivitron]]]   
---
- [[Vereesa Windrunner]]   
---
RNGesus giveth; RNGesus taketh away.
---
First pack. Golden boom reaver
---
Even a card that says it "plays" a secret such as [[Masked Contender]] will not trigger secretkeeper.
---
I got to rank 5 once with neutral minion rogue once to prove a point to a friend. 
---
I made a legend push, but topped out around rank 2.
---
They said it would take a few days to update with the new set. Try again in like a week or two.
---
Blizzard is greedy as fuck. Literally everyone on this sub knows that.
---
They probably decided to tighten the belt because HoF dust.

Bomb Warrior so far looks really good, or is it just only me? You get your usual Warrior's ability to control the board, plus shuffling in fuckton of bombs, where no one really have that much of sustain to live through that. You just slowly grind out your opponent and watch him explode.
---
I crafted it, and I wasn’t disappointed! Kudos
---
Unlikely
---
Downright terrifying XD
---
I would but currently with the new expansion we just lost A LOT of secrets for hunter :( so it may not be up to good standards again until next expansion. It relies very heavily on the use of eagle horn bow and proper move prediction with high IQ/greed plays, bout 2 months ago I had it at a 60% win rate (with over 100 games under it's belt since I had started tracking it) but then everyone started using Harrison Jones out of nowhere and acidic swamp ooze and it started taking a lot of losses
---
Alright, thanks :)
---
Nope, that's just how probabilities work.
---
Got in without issue, was somewhat disappointed to find that my golden legendary was Toggwaggle and not a legendary for a class that I actually play :/
---
This is the reason they won't likely do it. It would make harder to trick people into buying more packs.
---
There isn’t enough data to realize what the top decks are yet. It needs a couple days
---
I've been waiting til I got home from work just so I could open my packs on my PC and use this site to track everything, it's interesting to see the stats but somewhat depressing at times haha hope your luck gets better bud
---
People on Reddit really just that desperate to start fights
---
Nah it’s just unlikely
---
Holy shit man wtf, congrats. I'm just a little jealous though lol.
---
Hm, i’ve seen other pol making posts about a similar issue I wonder if it’s a bug
---
Yeah, they should seriously fix that because it is seriously frustrating.
---
A couple weeks ago I spent $800 buying packs and got the most absolutely garbage ever. That being said I'm never buying anything again. I know it is gambling and retarded .
---
got 2 legendaries in 8 packs
---
He's the only deck I have now next to my Murloc Shaman. Most likely the only two decks I'll be playing for a while since the biggest appeal for me before were quest decks.
---
First 10 packs until you hit a legend all have a very high legend rate so 'slow clap.'
---
Agreed, he seems pretty average without the Cube shenanigans, I don't really agree with the HoF decision. The others all felt fine to me though.
---
Decklist?
---
Aint too bad for 26 packs Kappa  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/VI4mHas](https://imgur.com/a/VI4mHas)
---
How do you know they drew the bomb? Is there a way for you to see their hand and what they draw at all time?
---
What about Archmage Vargoth?, imo getting a solid neutral legendary for free is better than a random one.
---
The difference this makes is astronomical
---
What do you expect from a small indie game developper?
---
Fewer
---
Yeah the dust for cards that have been Hall of Fame'd was given out when the expansion released (a few hours ago).
---
I’m really not planting a flag here, I just explained a comment and said it was entirely unreasonable.
---
130 Packs, 10 Legendary, one Gold. Im pretty happy with my pulls.
---
Seriously, chill. They’re clearly still in the hospital. Baby’s gonna sleep most of the time and yet they can’t leave the room. They have hospital staff to do everything for them for the next 24 to 48 and OP is probably going to be bored as hell outside of watching a diaper get changed every two hours. This is literally the quietest time they’re going to get for the next year.
---
Give OP and spouse a break. They just went through some shit.
---
Congrats, OP!
---
Thats pretty avarage. I got 4 legs out of 112 packs smile
---
You're nearly there.. think it through..
---
Can you fucking read?!
---
You'll average 3.5 legends so while below average, it's barely below average.
---
The quality of the legends may even put you as above average
---
2/3
---
Gain +2 Spelldmg for the turn after attacking
---
Probably just random. I got a legend from my Witchwood pack too, but not Dust-fallen Aviana. :)
---
Bullshit
---
Few months back Blizzard unbanned all the cards that were banned after Kara since that was pre-buckets/microadjusts to balance class power level, and with Wild sets rotating back in, those cards rotate back in as well.
---
Heroes, MCT, Fledgling, and C'thun + Odd/Even cards are still banned from being drafted however.
---
Still waiting for someone to magically make some version of Maly rogue to destroy my life.
---
got the same legs as you ! wtf !
---
That’s what I’m trying is a bomb/dragon deck.
---
I got a free legendary on log-in for pre-order but it didn’t pop a notification, check your collections!
---
Each quest gives you two packs, then the one on the last day gives you 4

Well for TBP i pulled hireek and harbinger celestia, sometimes life sucks but other times it does not, so don’t lose hope!
---
After the free pack + legendary, I opened 17 packs.  0 legendaries.
---
I'm super sure they'll stack (up to 3).
---
You might need to be online to get them, but probably not.
---
Damn, I got 11 from 160 packs. And none golden :(
---
Oh wow haven't faced these yet. Bomb+rush is very flexible which is why i prefer it. I believe it will be the better variant of Bomb Warrior but for now, since there's barely any aggro, the value/greedy versions are better.
---
3 legendaries is average for 55 packs.
---
And all three of those are good; keeper just goes into Druid decks, basically any Druid deck, and Jepetto and Veresa go into the Malygos Hunter deck that uses Master’s Call to draw Jepetto before Malygos/Veresa/Alextraza.
---
Just put it in a baku deck, perfect plan.
---
3 2/3 after your hero attack gain spell damage +2 this turn
---
no, zentimo is bad.
---
How much do you play? The only time i've had a meta deck was odd paladin, because it was cheap asf, but i crafted it in december, so it didn't last long. Kinda disappointing when you collect dust for 3 eternities, only to lose it all on nothing. I also had secret hunter at the same time, but made the mistake of not crafting Zuljin, so it wasn't as good as it could be
---
 [https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22912682](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/22912682)
---
&gt; Presumably the card doesn't count itself.
---
Yes. But why would it not? It's a card in his hand, it's a card from another class. Those are the conditions. There is no indication that it wouldn't count itself. That's either a bug or awful cardtext imo and probably inconsistent with something I can't think of right now
---
Except where it specifically says “if you’re holding another card from another class.”
---
First part you are just guessing he didn't wrote anything about broken Bluetooth. Second part you are just wrong, internet can be shared both ways over usb, just Google it.
---
3 in 83 packs so im salty
---
I wanted to make the bomb deck that I saw all the streamers using. Warrior is probably my 2nd least used deck. So I needed to craft pretty much everything. So all my dust is gone...
---

I updated above, made some slight changes.
---
You don't?
---
Try play arena to miximize your gold and try priest it is the best class for arena now.
---
No. It says "a card from another class" not "another card from another class."
---
Vendetta should count itself.

Flark is really fun in bomb/mech hunter.
---
Personally I’m fine with resurrecting stuff, but it’s really annoying when you leave 1 minion up that has 1 health and it suddenly turns into a 36/4 and kills you.
---
It's a statistic anomaly, but bound to happen at some point
---
You mean where it says "if you're holding a card from abother class" smh
---
i am fairly new to hearthstones 
---
so i dont get the luxury of the amount of dust you guys got 
---
but if i was me 
---
i will probally go on a card crafting spree
---
They could sell a gold one for 5 dollars every year and I'd buy it. I normally don't pay for things, but this is something I'd love to have access to forever. Then it does make them more money, and we get to keep Ol' Whizzy.
---
less, as  you will likely want to spend 2400 on the single player content.
---
However, once you play it, you are no longer holding a card from another class, so its cost returns to normal
---
I got a golden Rafaam, but am considering crafting a golden Togwaggle!
---
And a golden Dr. Boom hero card from the prior expansion...
---
This games Ashe and BOB
---
I'm at 12.6 and holding off to see agat to craft
---
&gt;If you don't like the business model then don't support them. But don't incessantly bitch about it. It gets tiring.
---
Ah yes, I saw this exact same strain of fanboyism somewhere else. Oh yeah, the Artifact sub.
---
This type of don't complain just stop playing white knighting isn't even doing the game corporation you love any favors.
---
If there's one thing that's tiring around here it's the fanboys.
---
Yeah, for sure.  I really dislike combo decks in hearthstone... At least in MTG you can respond.
---
The solo content will come out a month from now, with one chapter released each week. So if you want ROS cards today, you should just buy them.
---
[[Wrenchcalibur]]
---
It's okay if you are a temp/control deck as it is a little slow, but gives a lot of value. Talking from experience because i got 12 wins with it

4/3/2 | After your hero attacks, shuffle a Bomb into your opponent's deck.

It is scripted. To make content and views. Anything for a buck.
---
Git gud scrub/s
---
But nah bosses were always a bitch especially in older hs history, you just get that opening hand and nevet look back
---
I just busted open 141 packs of the new set. Here are my pull ratios (not including freebies):
---
11 Golden common
---
7 Golden rare
---
2 Golden epic
---
1 Golden legendary
---
——
---
33 epics
---
9 legendaries
---
And to make things even more awesome, my free golden legendary was archvillain rafaam! (The only golden legend I really wanted tbh)
---
The legendaries I got in total (including both preorder bonuses) were:
---
Golden Arch-Villain Rafaam
---
Golden Khadgar
---
Vereesa Windrunner
---
Kalecgos
---
Commander Rhyssa
---
Madame Lazul
---
Heistbaron Togwaggle
---
Tak Nozwhisker
---
Blastmaster Boom
---
The Boom Reaver
---
Barista Lynchen
---
Swampqueen Hagatha
---
If you’re curious of any other info, pm me or post here. Happy to help!
---
I love it, haven’t touched any naxx cards since they rotated out and glad their back
---
Curious what other heal druid decks will look like. I'm using splintergraft in mine and its performing better than I'd expect. The card may finally have found a home.
---
It’s 5 quests across multiple days which is strange according to what I’ve seen, but it’s 3 new packs and 2 of the still in rotation ones if I can read
---
He is pretty petty and bans on a whim. As expected.
---
I don't think that's a good approach. You're looking to end games fairly quickly that way, which means you're not getting payoff from plenty of your bombs. Every bomb card you're playing that never pays off with 5 damage to the face is a horrific play. I'm sure there are better things we can do with rush warrior. Dragons perhaps.
---
How???
---
sad dragonhatcher is gone.. had some fun with it in dragon decks but having a deck full of 9 cost dragons isnt a good idea in general and especially with no hatchers
---
Overkill is one of the few things that is a lot different because of the going over the target health, while cards that react on kill only need to max mob health
---
Archmage is useless crap. It just supports some archetypes, not creates new ones. Class legendaries DO THAT.
---
Honestly, I have no clue. I think it’s becuase ‘Boom’ is also a word so they are able to translate it. I’m sure Madam Lazul is still called Lazul for example. (Madam would probably be translated, though).
---
4 legendaries in 91 packs :(

Not a fan of the Christmas one, it's an alarming baby blue
---
Honestly, 12 packs are ok but it is super disappointing that you have to wait for them all AND that they're mixed. I'm ok with waiting a bit since I have a lot of gold, however, I can imagine how many player got annoyed by the fact that they can't open many packs on launch. I hope they keep learning from feedback.
---
If you enjoy making yourself feel like shit read on:
---
I haven't opened my 80 pack bundle yet but I logged in at lunch and got a golden kalecgos
---
The only legendary I got was a Fel Lord Betrug...... FeelsBadMan
---
Same for me, 7 legendaries in 200 packs
---
Loot hoarder, subject 9, hidden wisdom has been keeping me full along with all the ways to play secrets from my deck.
---
What add on is this?
---
dont worry I'm sure valve will make it right in Dota 3 after all they've never made a bad 3rd game in a series ...
---
I understand, doesn't really sound fun to replace my deck with random garbage hoping to outvalue dr.boom hero power and omega assembly
---
from my initial testing its pretty terrible. its just too slow vs the decks im facing at rank 5.
---
Bad bug hopefully blizzard refunds people who got them from packs after the rotation. Otherwise that would really suck getting Genn and Baku as your legendary after they rotated
---
Lol he's saying he's happy
---
Rafaam can add more than just 10 though. And I think he’s more fun.
---
Bad. You run out of gas quickly.
---
Reading this thread it seems like everyone's rng is really shit. I was just going to ask if they raised the legend/epic rate. Opened 25 packs, got 3 legends (1st was in 1st pack) and and 9 epics, one being gold, and only 1 duplicate. Seems like I got a wider variety of commons/rares than normal too. Side note, does anyone think Barista Lynchen is playable?
---
If you want a decent base for your deck, I made this. It’s been pretty strong so far. I don’t know why you’d want Malygos, but this deck features a lot of spells.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
He is better than a Death Knight in the sense that he opens up more options to a player who doesn´t have that many cards. A Death Knight gives you maybe 1 or 2 decks, and if it´s for the class you dislike or an archetype you don´t like playing, you are out of luck. 
---
&gt;he isnt a card that lets you build fun decks on release that feel interesting to play.
---
I disagree. He requires a bit more creativity (I know, it´s harder for some people) but if anything he opens up even more possibilities than a legendary for maybe 1 or 2 decks, because you can combo him with so many choices.
---
Whether that is interesting or not for you personally, sure, that is a personal opinion. But honestly, you could also get a random terrible legendary instead, would you be happy? 
---
So back to the problem at hand: You think that it is bad to distribute the packs over a few days. To that I ask: Would those extra 4 more new packs today help you *so much* with your quest to make a fun deck? Because that is all we get: overall 5 packs from the new expansion, the rest is from other Standard expansions (Witchwood, Boomsday and Rumble), with cards you already have.
---
Granted, there might be a lucky legendary in there for you. But the more realistic option is that you would just get 5 new packs with some new commons and rares, and 7 old packs with most of the cards that you have.
---
You should either have saved up more gold, or bought some packs. Those extra few packs today would not really be a gamechanger for you anyway.
---
fuck it i just crafted it GOLDEN
---
next expansion:
---
0 mana warrior spell: upgrade your schemes 500 times and change the art to one that fits.
---
blizzard: see, you mocked this card for being trash and now you want it nerfed? *evil laughter*
---
In all seriousness, i think it is not absolutely impossible you get the dust back. This card is so bad and it is so clearly a last minute pack filler that it is possible blizzard decide that it doesn't meet minimum standards to exist in the game. Unlikely, but not impossible.

Whatever works for you.  Ultimately, it's just a game.  I played WOW for years, leveled up, got all the high end gear, and went on guild raids that lasted hours.  One day I realized it had turned into a job, and I wasn't having fun any more.  That was the last day I played WOW.
---
Cant wait til Artifact gets rereleased in 2020 and again nobody will care lol
---
Great comment! Any other gems?
---
I know it's just an option for non warlocks
---
The only thing I want them to change is when you have your card back set to random and you open multiple packs your card back should change between each pack. Right now it only changes at the beginning or if you close and reopen the pack opening screen.
---
just a few hours, chill man...
---
The odd decks kinda took away alot of the variety of decks you could build,and streamlined the meta into a few game winning decks,which was a complaint among many youtubers,streamers and players
---
How can u get him?
---
Don't you also get the old arena cashed out? I haven't got any good or packs from it now that I think about it
---
Oooh thank you for that info, didn't know Tess would trigger bombs again -- Guess I avoid playing that against Bomb if I already drew a few.
---
F2P is the only way DCG's can possibly work, and even that's far from guaranteed. Valve was just way too arrogant not to see how their business model was doomed from the start.
---
"Yo yo yo The Junior Explorers head into the forest mapping it for us..." Such a sick flow. Literally rap god
---
You should probably uninstall and find a different game
---
I was pleasantly surprised. Almost conceded during the animation because I would have been dead without those bombs.
---
Disagree, having a lot of fun exploring new archetypes and revisiting ones past ones that couldn’t do well against the DKs. Maybe try building decks outside of the metadecks?
---
People will call me crazy but I swear to God they lower legendary drop rates on launch day because they don't want you getting a lot. Most people from the fireside gatherings are reporting higher numbers so that backs my conclusion
---
Yes I am the worst person ever
---
Mostly you just need cable rat, miscreant and the scheme
---
So many turn one concedes.
---
If he lost, he would have probably lost even harder if his opponent had 2 more threats instead of just armor.
---
Since there's only 4 minions in the deck, I assume it's to try to almost guarantee discovering Jepetto and then use that to get a 1 mana Malygos.
---
Deck code ?
---
I’ll try it out! Thanks.
---
Free dust time!
---
Just did
---
Turn 1 Bloodclaw into Turn 2 Coin+Hench Clan Thug is considered Hanging Dong with this deck
---
Thanks for the nostalgia, take my downvote
---
Additional trivia. Typing "There is no cow level" in the single player and campaign of original StarCraft and Brood War was a cheat to instantly win. In Diablo II there was a secret level, populated with cows called the "cow level."
---
Again listen to what I said, it made release feel directionless, I completed the quest and that was it, then I had just a few impactless cards against a ladder of people playing bomb warrior. 
---
And you obviously have never played with a limited collection, deathknights, quests, weapons, these were all far more fun to play with.
---
So much money is thrown at the game today that we would be ignorant to think the suits don't fuck with the drop rate on  launch day. Google patents by Activision and EA and you'll see patent after patent of predatory microtransaction behavior. I guarantee you they mess with it on launch day
---
117 common 1 golden = 635 dust
---
39 rare 3 golden = 1080 dust
---
11 epic = 1100 dust
---
1 legendary = 400 dust
---
total : 3215 DUST value in 35 packs ( 3300 gold 1 brawl pack + quest pack ) feels bad man
---
I’d suggest making whizzbang for your “meta” deck.
---
Never gets boring and his decks aren’t half bad. It’ll only cost you 1600 dust.
