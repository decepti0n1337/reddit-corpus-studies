Lol I'm glad they did.

You do realize there are people out there that do enjoy them right.
---
I guess it depends on the build. Phaoris is better with many (big) spells, and Nzoth is better with more deathrattles. It's such a shame not to abuse Nzoth especially when we'll also have access to Sylvanas. Either way, it'll be very fun.

His is indeed, got me earlier.

The Curator could possibly see use in decks running double [[Nightmare Amalgam]] in addition to a central tribe? Perhaps in something like Highlander Paladin, which can tutor for Finley plus two splashable Dragon/Beast cards.

Have you played against flanewaker this past year?
---
It is only really used in quest tempo mage and is a backup plan that only sometimes work. It is too expensive, too easy to deal with, and it is difficult to both build a deck that works with flamewaker and that does anything at all without him. Quest mage does, but is generally better off playing arcane giants and the quest than trying to set up good flamewakers.

Oh dear god...

Can you suggest a good wild deck?

People keep saying there‚Äôs no correlation between twitch views and the overall health of Hearthstone yet if you actually spend the time to compare past expansions to one another you‚Äôll find that the Twitch viewership actually does match the comparison. For example, Witchwood had more viewership than Rise of Shadows, KFT era had more viewership than Boomsday, Rise of Shadows had more viewership than RR. In all of those cases, the first mentioned out performed the second mentioned in the investor reports.
---
Furthermore, Twitch viewership started it‚Äôs massive drop in 2018 onward, which corresponds to when their quarterly reports stated the game experienced a decline in active players and revenue

I did! With plenty of health to spare on Brann too. Though I also got pretty lucky by pulling the treasure that gives you 3 poisonous snakes with rush and reborn right when he played the final plague.
---
Blizzard should just temporarily give access to those cards for the format. I doubt that they make substantial money on the older sets.
---
Flamewakers are a race of humanlike-serpentine elemental beings created by Ragnaros to serve himself. While they exist on the Elemental Plane they aren‚Äôt purely considered elementals.

It was believed that they were former Dark Iron Dwarves turned into Flamewakers similar to how the Highborne Night Elves became the Naga‚Äôs at the hand of N‚ÄôZoth and Queen Azshara but alas that was unfortunately dissolved as not true.

&gt;Not to the same extent yes, Standard is figured out to far far more of an extent, because way more people will play it and the rotations are out for longer.
---
Limited seasons will continue the work already done by two year's worth of Standard seasons outside of specific circumstances where one card from one set was reliant on another specific card from another set to be good like Ultimate Infestation was with unnerfed Wild Growth and Nourish.
---
There are a lot of cards out there that when placed back into a small format cannot be denied.
---
&gt;If Witchwood isn't played out what makes TGT played out?
---
The Witchwood, as the oldest Standard set, is pretty played out at the very least relative to either Rise of Shadows or Saviors of Uldum (notice how I used the phrasing "newer sets in Standard"), and I used it in the list because it features Dragon synergies like the other four sets I mentioned in that grouping. Granted, I should have also included K&amp;C in that grouping because of Duskbreaker.
---
&gt;I think you just don't understand deckbuilding really if you think the presence of spellstones kill all chances of deckbuilding or a varied meta.
---
It's not the presence of Spellstones itself that'll solve many of the deck building questions a new season may ask, but powerful specific cards or groups of cards that will.
---
Let's take Emerald Spellstone as an example of this though. A season featuring Emerald Spellstone even in its nerfed state will most likely have Hunter playing it and whatever good secrets are available by default. When you're playing secrets, you pretty much have to play the synergies that come with them be it Cloaked Huntress, Hyena Alpha, Mad Scientist, and so on and so forth.
---
So, off the bat, a Limited season featuring K&amp;C places Hunter into a situation where it will want to play secrets across just about any archetype that isn't super fast aggro.
---
Cards like Prince Keleseth, Patches the Pirate, Reno Jackson, Carnivorous Cube, and many others when placed back into a small format will pre-maturely answer a lot of questions that go into deck building.

Zephrys highly undervalues Silence as an effect, considering it "soft removal" regardless of what the opponent's card text is.  Only a few specific cards tend to make him offer silence.
---
&gt; But there is in fact a similarity between C'Thun and Murlocs. They both are a heavily synergistic buffing tribe.
---
That's quite a stretch.  There's closer thematic connections between murlocs and N'zoth.  Aside from both being related to water,  N'zoth corrupts things and murlocs are, well, corrupted things.
---
Wrath is super easy.
---
Madness is probably C'thun, could maaayybe be yogg.
---
Death is probably Yogg but maayyybe N'zoth, though that's just deathrattles
---
Murlocs is most like N'zoth, but could possibly perhaps be yogg given that he's got some relationship to water.
---
Don't worry, just use Zephyrs or run Brightwing and get lucky on RNG. I was playing discard-lock and a mage yeeted me out of existence with a windfury 20/20.

---
but if you play rogue you can togwaggle the Highkeeper Ra in case he gets hexed or something
---
Against a secret mage (wild) it is a risky move.
---
As a casual player, it's nice to see Renounce Winrate coming back.
---
Perfect Scenario:
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Have 3 specific legendaries in hand: ET, Elise, Kun
---
Turn 6: Play a 6-mana 5/5.
---
Turn 7: Play a 4-mana 5/5 and spend 3 mana on whatever
---
Turn 8: Flex turn, but still no payoff
---
Turn 9: Big swing turn with discounted Kun
---
With the singleton restriction, I feel like this combo is slow enough to be kept in check by faster decks.
---
On one hand, you could bring back a handful of powerful cards like patches and reno jackson, and have them severely warp the current meta. That's not necessarily a good thing.
---
You could instead bring back a handful of weak cards like icehowl and sergeant sally and have them be almost useless, and have the rest of the expansion be the same combo priest, highlander hunter, and control warrior fiesta it currently is. That's not necessarily good either.
---
Imo it was a pretty good midground - very strong decks right now like combo priest aren't getting many useful tools, while weaker archetypes like cyclone mage, control/resurrect priest, and thief rogue are getting stronger cards.
---
good guide here for anyone that hasn't played for the last 2 years.
---
There‚Äôs a simply better version of this deck. Topsy, Test Subject, Embalming Ritual, Radiant, Grave Horror. Guaranteed T3 pop off without disruption. Not vulnerable to silence.
---
Oh god n'zoth
---
Yeah, but that's after you've summoned him. Rogue doesn't have the survival tools to consistently summon him before that point, which is the issue.
---
I want to believe if they reverted the change to Innervate, the deck would still function. Astral is by far my favorite hs deck, and I'm constantly wishing it was viable. But you might be right about WG and Nourish nerfs having a bigger impact than I expect.
---
No way. I'll bet you anything that Hunterace wouldn't have made this play. Evolving into an 8 drop is unlikely to be stronger than a 4/5 untargetable, and comes with not just the chance to instalose with Octosari but a bunch of other terrible pickups like Hireek. Even if you get the dream, so, Tirion, your opponent can still possibly have Weapons Projects and the like (dunno how much of Elysiana has been revealed at this point)
---
Haven't faced Mill Rogue as a Weasel. It's like started to appear only after I finished playing weasel and continued looking for a new fun good decks. I guess you pray that he will miss on Coins - it's the most important. Coldlights hurt a lot after you Myra's.
---
I feel like this would test deck building skills a lot more which is very needed right now. The game is getting stale really quickly with all the people copying each others decks.
---
They aren't creatures so you can't give them minus 3 minus 3. They're artifacts. If something makes them into creatures then sure. They're artifact creatures or whatever and you can do that.

Yeah, only 15 more turns and the Priest is dead.
---
... Unless the Priest decides to use his hero power...
---
Is it known how teemporary this Will be ?
---
If you have 5 high-cost cards in your deck, the odds of drawing at least one in your opening hand is 48.6%.
---
Grave Horror and Arcane Giant isn't that big, because they would switch it to Divine Spirit. Better to ban the Radiant.

I was just looking at the pictures for each week that showed the rewards you get.  (The quest rewards weren‚Äôt specifically but are part of the weekly rewards images.)  After looking at it again today, it‚Äôs possible they included the log in bonuses for the three week period as rewards for the first week.  So it could be 9 packs and not 14.  But I‚Äôm leaning towards it being 14.
---
It's really funny how it can go sometimes, considering how bad Viper's RNG was up to this point, he even looked like he went full-tilt. So sometimes even RNG is somewhat balanced. Yet you can only feel bad for Orange in this spot, it's just crushing.

While i agree that this meta is pretty balanced (other than northsire on 1), for me at least is has become kinda stale. It's been 5 days since the season started and i have not yet felt like playing a game of hearthstone, other than doing my quests with an alt. What I'm getting at, is that at this point i would take a nutty unbalanced meta over a stale one. This is one of the best metas we ever had imo, but i still wanna throw a wrench in it

---
It may not be optimal, but I'll be honest: I always prefer seeing unusual card plays. I doubt I'd ever use N'Zoth as just a tertiary effect to have a modest effect like that brought back, but I don't wanna ever discount the possibility either.
---
Zephrys only understands two things: getting lethal and what's generally good. Two small-statted deathrattles are not generally considered powerful, which is the main reason you see Whelps so much in Deathrattle-focused decks. The vast majority of deathrattles just aren't anywhere near that good.
---
Jaraxxus is unplayable - it doesn't matter. Will never be relevant again with only 15 health
---
maybe to avoid the otk that can be done easily
---
That was someone else. There were two different people who were stuck in similar problems, deckless guy and healthless guy.
---
But you need premium to see winrates at seperate ranks, otherwise hsreplay is not so informative I'd say.
---
I feel like shaman and paladin got rekt in terms of mene potential, and that's just sad

I would concede after that, there is no coming back.
---

---

---
‚ÄúLost the psychological battle‚Äù suggests that Orange played badly in the third game, which he didn‚Äôt imo. It‚Äôs a tricky matchup and he lost two 50/50 rolls - first on resurrecting the beaming sidekick rather than blademaster, and second on the pressure plate hitting blademaster instead of sidekick (when the secret was random and could have been snake or rat too). Both of those were huge swings which are hard to win from. I think he played it well but sometimes you have to take risks with the secrets and it just didn‚Äôt work out for him there.
---
Look I love the idea of a rolling classic/basic set, but with the way the Hearthstone economy is structured a move like this feels like an incredible slap in the face for both free-to-play and lower budget players.
---
These are players who might have chosen to dust these wild legendaries for pennies on the dollar in order to build decks with the justification that 'I'll never get to use them in Standard anyway', and I don't think this can be implemented on a more permanent basis without a change to that economy.

This has changed. He‚Äôs right.

100,000 hands.
---
That doesn't really work with Jaraxxus though
---
I don't think it's good to have zephyrs and jaraxxus in the same meta as long as sac pact is a counter. I agree it should be disabled
---
Control Warlock often can't mount enough pressure to force a Zeph play, so it doesn't seem like a reasonable solution. Considering Jaraxxus is primarily there to grind down slower decks, it seems silly that the entire win con is entirely countered to the point of instant-loss, so your opponent even unknowingly has the upperhand by stopping you playing into your win condition until they've played a card they'd often rather not play until the close of the game.
---
It doesn't really pan out that simply in practice.
---
Why can Jaraxxus still be killed by sac pac but Murgl can't be Hungry Crab'ed? Blizzard isn't even consistent when making their stupid decisions.
---
How is it a ''''fun'''' ''''easter egg'''' to have YOUR HERO essentially be one-shot by this interaction.

HS esports fell off a cliff in terms of viewership few years ago when the old, known faces of personalities got repeatedly replaced by new contenders, who won tournaments fair and squaire only to lose to other nobodies in the next tournament. People want to see thijs, kolento, rdu, zalae because they know them as streamers and can meme them. This favoritism is the best they can do without just  going straight back to invitationals to protect their investments. Its not fair but competitive spirit was never big in HS (see ghosty and elky live streamsniping and how different they were treated).
---
You still retain non class cards, so you can build around that. Having discounted cards is good and all, but you need card draw to use the fact your deck is cheaper.
---
If you go 7-2 you get 150g, 1 pack, and a free arena ticket.
---
If you go 7-3 then 0-2 you get 0g (150g - 150g), 2 packs, and a free arena ticket.
---
Therefore you paid 150g for 1 pack.

Highlander Hunter might not have been the best example considering it actually stands to gain quite a bit from the new cards coming in.

4 cost reduction over 2 turns - you can copy the brewed thaurisan again the turn after.

It's known. If you were at &lt;20 you were fine, if you die *because* the damage is doubled this doesn't work for some reason. It's been like that for ages with Cursed Blade and Ice Block too

A picture is worth a thousand words. Checkmate, philistine.

that's an epic card you disgusting p2w
---
Holy wrath draws a cars and deals damage equal to the cost of the cord. He doesn't wanna play shrivallah, he wants to get to turn 5 to deal 25 damage to his opponents face.
---
Yep, because not all cards have the same strenght. You can make strong, underrated cards playable in your homebrews, but bad or mediocre cards will remain bad or mediocre, and if you evaluate your fun trough winrate, then you wont have fun with those cards whatever the developers nerf or buff.
---
It's inconsistent. Hand buffing Jaraxxus does not give you a weapon with bigger attack and doesn't increase health after "transforming" into a hero.
---
Also, if it was a "minion as hero", it wouldn't be a removable weapon equip on battlecry, but a persistent attack value for every turn.
---
This looks amazing!

I guess I can now upgrade the same deck over and over.

Love it. Where can we see more of your Work?
---
Dollmaster Dorian and Fel Lord B both come to mind. If this was in the game, you'd draw your deck, drop one of them, plot twist, and win.
---
Taunt. Taunt Taunt Taunt Taunt Taunt.
---
Sounds like someone has butthurt memories from getting trashed by cubelock :D
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
I am super excited to use renounce darkness with the warlock quest. Draw into renounce, cast it right before quest completes, and get a superior draw hero power afterward.
---
[[Demon caller]] into double [[sac pac]]
---
Did you win?
---
I think I saw another post about bulwark not working properly with this anomaly, so probably a bug.
---
Well done!
---
The context is a post where OP knows it‚Äôs a bad draft, he‚Äôs well aware that it‚Äôs a build around and is gonna be difficult -  though he‚Äôs holding out hope for the 25 damage holy wraith. Everyone agrees with you, there‚Äôs no discussion to be had. If they didn‚Äôt they wouldn‚Äôt be upvoting this post.

Heres a novel idea: Kill the priest with spells.

I know that. You are not telling me new information.
---
That‚Äôs definitely not the case
---
This card is really really badly designed. This card immediately destroys the enemy opponent when 2 conditions are met: This gets cheated out and it dies. Both these conditions are not difficult at all. Compare this to other immediate death effects: Paladin death knight, you need to have 4 specific minions on board after playing a 9 mana card, the minions costing 8 mana between them and often needing bounce effects or an additional legendary + spells to trigger, that is pretty tough. Equally, how about a quest where you play loads of generated cards, then copy 1 specific minion, draw another specific legendary, play the quest reward after discounting it and then have a spell in hand. Pretty tough.
---
In wild especially it is so so so easy to summon this, plot twist + Fel lord or doll master, lackey, skull, void caller...so many ways. So the summon part of the condition is pretty easy. The kill it part of the condition is also super easy as warlocks have loads of ways to kill their own minions and if it's on the board it is basically a 5/15 immune as your opponent would never attack into it...oh unless you give it taunt.
---
Basically, this card is way too easy to be an instant kill and would be insanely unfun as it has no interactivity at all. There is no situation where anyone would enjoy seeing this card against them and it is one of the most swingy cards ever. You could theoretically kill your opponent on turn 4 with void caller -&gt; sac pact -&gt; sac pact on Devil = win. And that is why this should never ever be printed.
---
They should remove Sac Pact from the pool of Zephrys cards.

This is incredibly done! Would love to see more iconic characters in cuphead style. Maybe try Rafaam with his staff also having a face
---
Bob boss, bob ross's evil twin
---
Ah understandable. I think it looks pretty good it's just a bit distracting in my opinion
---
I always thought that said Nordic Candle. Rip me.
---
It was a pretty obvious joke but I guess I should‚Äôve thrown in the /s anyways

Isnt rakanishu a d2 charachter if so does this mean diablo and warcraft are in the same universe
---

---
Why was that being ran?
---
2016-2017 expansions were somehow special to me. They felt like they made with love.
---
The recent ones are really good too, but I feel like something is missing. I can't really tell what it is.
---
Anyway... OPTIMISM! FORWARD!
---
Warrior bad, now give me upvotes
---
Can confirm, warlock has sooo many good decks in Wild. Quite contrary to standard :(

I will show, you go first.
---
Is that an angry loot box?
---
You stoned?
---
Throw in chef nomi and flobidinous floop and it‚Äôs got some viability
---
Tbh I stopped playing when they removed that batch from rotation so I can‚Äôt really speak on the matter nowadays. Just couldn‚Äôt keep up as a casual+free2player
---
NOW GO
---
Whats the difference?
---
It is. The lootboxes are evil.
---
I thought it was a really cool battle at least
---
Nice! I love it!
---
They should buff him from being a minion into being a hero card (which don‚Äôt have minion types).
---
I think he only exists in the HS universe. He lives in Togwaggle's crown. He's a troublemaker elemental, he was one of the crewmembers who stole Dalaran. He has one of the best voice acting in the game imo.
---
Welcome to wild, where the druids have more armor than the warriors.
---
On the fifth chapter you fight directly against a 200hp boss, and you can use the four explorers, in whatever order you want.
---
Edit: 300*hp boss
---
.....when I did it on Regular I used Elise and killed it so I thought it was just the one....
---
I've been trying time and time again to infinite damage it with Elise on Heroic and kept conceding I'm stupid
---
This would be a sick 1k win portrait
---
You'll have to go to a gathering or spoof your GPS to 'attend' one but that's against tos
---
Yes and they update wizbang on new xpacs zayle just dies out
---
That makes Zayle pretty useless then. They didnt move him to classic yet did they?
---
Yes, and it was legitimately hillarious :)
---
Nah ya i was hoping they would do a heroes verison for this new xpac but sadly they didn't
---
Say the magic word
---
Op is referring to the one in king togwaggles lamp (which is on his head)
---
Or if the creators of cuphead are allowed to do a hearthstone themed spinoff
---
Edit: typo
---
Togwaggle himself incidentally I think is also a hearthstone exclusive character
---
Commercial drawers?  IKEA is paying for ad space or something?

4/0/4 | Your minions cost (2) less, but not less than (1).  
---
Ok
---
Sacrificial Pact is a class-specific card that doesn't get used often on it's own, and is a very, very specific win condition against a minion-replacing-hero card that also sees almost no play. The odds of both being used in games against eachother in the past were incredibly slim. Jaraxxus is also much stronger than Murgl with his Hero Power and weapon drop, albeit at a bigger cost and lower health.
---
Hungry Crab is a neutral 2 drop that anyone can use and would entirely nullify a hero card. It would make a hero 100% unplayable if every class was entitled to a free 2 drop that will instantly win them the game and would kill an entire hero card with a class-neutral 2 drop with no other necessary additions.
---
While Zephrys is one of the best cards in game, he must at least fulfill the all-unique cards condition AND recognize the Jaraxxus on board to pull a Sacrificial Pact. Other than that, Sacrificial Pact is only in a Warlock deck and often finds 0 play as of late in most decks.
---
That's my take on why it happens.

Throwback to when Execute was 1 mana

Could you share your deck with me pls? : )
---
We liked this suggestion a lot, but ended up adding stealth to it since it fit the character too much to not include.You can see artwork of the card version here on Boz's twitter.[https://twitter.com/BozPotatoz/status/1180613556401852416](https://twitter.com/BozPotatoz/status/1180613556401852416)  
---
EDIT: Oh, I should specify that it's my WoW character - Kass Keelhaul. We named the card "Blackwater Privateer", since she wasn't a Legendary.
---
wait... if you used expired merchant on the nether portal....

I dusted golden tekhan to craft Tess. I have No regrets
---
That's ridiculous. Sky temple is so useless
---
Totally the other way around, dust can do so much more than golden cards that just look pretty. I dislike using golden cards though, so that comes into play for me.
---
Cards created by the Sinkhole's hero power. They cast when drawn and remove the next three cards.
---
This is good advice right here. Nothing like completing a strategy that needed Leeroy or Malygos and you know those guys are going to be there forever (or return their full dust value in case they go)
