Is this comment sarcastic?
---

---
This adventure is considered one of the easiest there are. Normal and heroic. 
---
Many people were dissapointed because of how easy it is when it came out.
---
And the chess was the hardest part (only on heroic) because you couldnt use your own deck and you had to hit the right cards while the enemy wasn't.
---
I don't know how Hearthstone code works, obviously, but I'm pretty sure it would be easier to check the # of cards in your hand against your opponents and then have you draw (number of cards in your opponents hand) minus (number of cards in your hand after Divine Favor). 
---
So if you have five cards (including DF), your opponent has 12, after casting DF you'd draw 8.
---
That is completely false, sn1p lock wasnt refined or played much until a few months ago, it was pretty inline with the BS from wild cards going into standard, clearly you dont play wild yourself or you would've known that
---
You lucky bitch! Now you can buff all your murlocs with +2 health! You can even try rerolling and then sell the mama bear to buy something else for the next battle!
---
Awful positioning.
---
1. Move the 2/2 lightfang to the far left in order to break divine shields and make space for rover summons.
---
2. Move an amalgam to the far right to mitigate enemy cleave
---
3. Move the other amalgam in between the two 4/4 lightfangs to mitigate enemy cleave
---
Jokes on you, he only had 2 cards in hand and 0 in deck so fatigue killed him and he never got a turn
---
For free? And to think of the amount of shit we went through on Amazon to get it..
---
I use it in Malygos Hunter.
---
I find that a bit hard to believe given how VS skews their results by intentionally using small sample sizes anyway.
---
This is too strong, should be at least 3 mana.   
---
While you're at it, you can remove the Banana, Coin, card, Armor, 1 attack and  3 health from it, and also give it charge too.
---
Triples of security rover with cobalt are just gonna do fairly well no matter what happens. Tbh I’m not sure this card was a huge bonus.
---
We already know hoe this will work. If your hand and deck are empty and your opponent holds 4 cards, you will draw 4 ticks of fatigue by playing divine favor.
---
No idea. I only play constructed for the dailies and I haven't added the new card.
---
Legendary has way more letters then leggo, easier to type
---
Would your name happen to be Moby?
---
Sounds like a you problem.
---
I thought some of the cards they brought back were pretty interesting. They just didn't exercise great judgment in choosing which. The meta right now would be far more bearable if Nzoth and Evolve had been passed over for something else.
---
I've got over a hundred packs waiting for me. When do I get to bust them shits open?
---
It's a simple concept, you don't need 5 pages for it. If you can't do elementary math, they make a thing called a calculator.
---
Yeah who can forget blizz's shitty free legendaries like vargoth which only saw play in such niche decks as big/res priest, or the terrible sn1p-sn4p which really just fell off the meta?
---
If it were a good card, you wouldn’t be getting it for free.
---
We literally got two of the last expansions best legendaries for free in Sn1p-Sn4p and Vargoth lmao
---
I'm not sure what your collection is like, but if you never made any serious time or money investment and it's not particularly great, you might want to consider starting a new account so you can take advantage of the new beginner ranks they added a while back. You get paired up against mostly other new players there and earn nearly two dozen free packs in the process. And since you'll be new, you're guaranteed a legendary within the first ten packs of every set giving you access to enough potential dust to craft at least one of the budget-friendly competitive decks like Murloc Shaman which is more than capable of climbing to Rank 5 and beyond.
---
“New” relative to what? Have you not logged in for a while? I’ve been getting that one ever since Tombs of Terror released.
---
I sense a problem with adding multiple Zephs to your deck

Everything is fixed with the heat death of the universe.
---
Mr. Shooty Demon Booty can make your build quite strong and isn't pure stats since he helps take down most divine shields and sometimes takes down hyenas or key minions, but I agree that they're a little too weak against poison to be very strong.
---
I've had plenty of games where I drop him turn 1 or 2, they can't remove him, and it gets me several cards. It may not be statistically the best move, but it has strong potential. Much like burgle rogue.
---
It's like he is snorting the dust
---
I SWEAR TO GOD, I’M GONNA DO IT
---
Big surprise someone who says leggos and Actibli$$ has shit takes lol
---
It's in 10% of wild decks and used by Druid, Mage and Priest. It will most likely see a lot play before it rotates.
---
It was easy as patch though because I was left with ~30 life by the time I hit 5. Went for Brann strat which is ultimately what made everything so big bc I kept picking up buffs to stop from consistently losing.

It's too expensive.  Way too expensive.  I think it should be lowered to like a 4/4 for 7.

I run this in my quest warrior deck to copy buffed taunts like tomb warden or mosh ogg
---
Played time vs spending money? Huh?
---
This isn't new. This has been a thing ever since Tombs of Terror came out.
---
My wife and I were driving through a strip mall's parking lot when I saw this place. I slammed the brakes on and grabbed for my phone.
---
"What the hell?" she said, startled.
---
"Kripperino restaurino," I said.
---
Oh for sure. Its a terrible deck. But its something no one seems to ever expect. Turn 3, when you drop your third-fourth egg, the opponent always drops an 'Extrodinary'.   
---
Also as bad as the deck might be. **Turn 2:**  Nerubian Egg into **Turn 3:** Coin -&gt;  Ravenous Pterrordax  has been pretty nasty. Other than that, the rest of the deck is just memes.   
---
Multiple eggs into  Plague of Flames  is funny though. And the  Gnomeferatu for meme snipes against combo decks is always fun. Same for  Demonic Project  into sac pact.  
---
The deck is just fun to meme with, just don't take things seriously and you'll have a blast.
---
For a new player, I'd recommend giving a priority to defeating your opponent's minions over attacking your opponent directly unless you have a good shot at setting up lethal. This isn't a hard and fast rule by any means, but I think it works as a good "standard practice for beginners".
---
Be sure to minimize your minion loss. You're probably doing this already, but the minion that will survive an attack against another minion while still taking it out is better than the minion that will die while taking the other minion out (most of the time). This can be counter-intuitive, especially times when the minion you don't kill the enemy minion with is going to be dealing damage to the other player directly, and you usually want to maximize that... but at the end of the day, having a 3/1 and a 1/2 on the board is stronger than having just a 3/3. (Again, this changes in some scenarios; I'd never follow this advice against Frost Lich Jaina because a 1-health minion just gives her more power when it gets to her turn again, but that's an exception not a rule.)
---
Also, when I first started I read someone's "tips for new players", and they included "always try to mulligan to get a 1, 2, and 3 cost mana (and 4-cost if you're going second (and if you're going second, the coin can be a -1 modifier to one of those)) because when you're starting you "always want to do something to the board" on your turn. This isn't always the best play (as a Shaman I'd rather save a Lightning Bolt for a 3-health minion than just zap my enemy with it on turn 1) but the "always set yourself up to be able to play something" mentality is a nice habit to get into even if it's not always correct.
---
Unfortunately, you're asking for a "strategy" while Hearthstone is primarily a game of "tactics". This stops being the case if you've got an unbeatable deck from the Internet which always works if you follow instructions... but a lot of those decks completely collapse under their own weight when they encounter a player with a trick they're not expecting. The strategy (ie., precise set of instructions for how you'll handle things) is important, but the tactics (general plans for how to deploy available resources against unexpected scenarios) are better to build as a habit. And... I can't really give you great advice for how to develop tactics beyond just practice, practice, practice. We've had a bad meta for new players to practice in for two years now (in my opinion, anyway), but that just means your practice'll be under harsher conditions. Good luck!
---
Oh, and make some friends that you can just mess around with. Weird decks that don't have much to do with the current meta can be really instructive for how card mechanics flow together.
---
I've had great results in pure Murloc builds as well, so while Lightfang surely is strong, it's definitely not the broken win condition.
---
Not vegan tho. Doesn't count! ;-)
---
Bringing them in for shorter time frame would have worked far better.  The amount of time the actual event they come in for would have been great.  
---
I hope they don't choose to not do it again due to people complaining too much and just instead think it through some more, be willing to adapt and also run it for a shorter amount of time.
---
Mike Donais said that we will not get the skin until December, sooo I believe we will see her around Christmas.

Hopefully we get Khadgar soon :c
---
But technically we do have 1 dragon....
---
Vegetarian?
---
Not vegan enough.
---
I met him once. He was funny. He was unsure how to introduce himself. He started with Dog and I gave him a smile. So he said his real name instead. We laughed. Fun little exchange.
---
Kinda is without enforcer you lose
---
actually 2 dragons
---
I put him in my Dragon Warrior deck, there arena few cards that are pretty nice to have extra copies of like Emberscale Drake, War Master Voone, or Smolderthorn Lancer
---
This card creates a never ending loop. Let’s assume for one second that Patriarch is the worst 3-cost card. The next worst card we’ll call CardX. By virtue of being able to get CardX or better off of Patriarch, Patriarch becomes better than CardX. This repeats for CardY and so on until there are no cards left which are better than Patriarch, at which point you discover nothing and Patriarch again becomes the worst card and the cycle repeats. 
---
Game would crash. Confirmed.
---
I played Mario kart with trump for a while on the same day. He was so horribly awkward to talk to. But I’m sure no one is shocked by that
---
Wow, I was so sure we'd seen the last of these.
---
Kaboom bot can be sneaky good vs shields
---
Control warrior is too expensive for me right now since I never got too into playing warrior and don’t have any crazy warrior legendaries.
---
It was before I was a mod, but when Monster Hunt was launched, there were quite literally hundreds of posts about this in the first weekend. The mods removed more than 700 posts that weekend, the vast majority of which were A Small Rock v Whisperer.
---
I know you didn't know that, but just a fun fact.
---
I can hear this picture
---
I've been playing some homebrewed highlander handlock with a lot of the old staples. Rag/Zephrys/Khartut Defender/Ysera/Mountain Giant. Thaurissan helps but this gets played like 1/3rd of my games and its only really effective like 2/3s of those times. Will be a lot more interesting once rouges cant put 12 N'Zoths into their deck. I can't say I think it contributes much.
---
- Can't play the person you just played.
---
- Random otherwise.
---
Ahh yes for 1 hero lol
---
Damn, my luck really just sucks, huh?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thanks for letting me know &lt;3
---
And then they Banker or some other bullshit to N'zoth to get another one. Even then with the right cards in hand I can fight my way through two walls, but the third is just too much.
---
But that might only useful in those versions that run Grumble. I play without Grumble and 9 mana is simply too expensive to make sure you keep a copy of Shudderwock. 
---
Generally speaking, you want to maximize the chance that Shudderwock gets copied/shuffled (the copy/shuffle has to occur after doppelganster triggered which is based on chance). 
---
Thus you'd rather want to play 2 copy/shuffle-cards that grant you one copy each instead of playing one copy card that grants you 2 copies (shuffle + copy from Sathrovarr). I just run the 3 cheapest copy makers (zola/banker/brewmaster) which maximizes the chance to "copy“ Shudder and enables me to make plays in the early game to get my quest done. 
---
No need to find a turn I can drop a 5/5 for 9 mana that doesn’t do anything - especially wild where every turn counts.

I have this card in my Lucentbark Quest Druid, it's pretty funny and I get insane value from just flooping it
---
How was the Orange Juice though?
---
Magma rager has more stats kappa
---
If only you could get a triple of a golden.
---
OTK paladin is not slow. It draws through it's deck very fast and is far from one of the slowest decks
---
This makes sense given you're in Wild
---
This is why I was warned not to take philosophy as a major.
---
( This and not wanting to starve to death)
---
Agreed
---
OP was talking about quest shaman,where you double the battlecry
---
Wait but won't they ovedraw ?
---
Havent played it. Havent seen it played against me.  
---
My money say it's a dud.
---
But other than turn 1 against exactly aggro, are you ever happy to have this?
---
For once a discover card that can’t discover itself
---
God I hate Murloc decks
---
Would be nice with stealth
---
or bog slosher, if quest dragon shaman is a deck
---
It's starting to develop callouses
---
Works In wild. GreAt with shudderwock decks and most Reno decks which can always use duplicates of zephyrs or Reno or nzoth
---
If play power word shield on it it can actually activate twice or more!
---
If you're playing these cards I assume it's because you're heavy on value, not light. You want the game to progress to where you can use your expensive cards without dying.
---
[[Radiance]]
---
Few decks will draw as fast as otk and the games are not long.
---
Actually: This is called stagnation and it means that the player is stuck at his current rank. If you are constantly playing in rank 20, maintaining 50% isnt that difficult and with 50% you naturally wont climb. So yes this is entirely normal.
---
Then you draw the second copy of each card on turns eight and nine and proceed to lose because they are now unplayable.

Good bot.
---
Still ok with Frost Nova on turn 4+
---
I never cared enough to do the heroic for this adventure until  a few months ago (I bought it when it came out). 
---
Other than the imp demon boss (to insta finish it with defile). I didn't use any wild deck.
---
Bosses were actually bugged to reborn taunts or reborn in general, giving me a few turns without attacking at all.
---
I used ressurect priest to finish easly most bosses. And combo priest a few times. 
---
I also did the Blackrock Mountain (being the hardest of them all, still easy) and League of Explorers(easy) heroics this year I still consider Kazakhstan the easier one.
---
Yeah this is gonna be a new staple for Trolden videos.
---
Give it immune.
---
So this is a pack filler
---
Wild board nuke Res Priest is totally OP with this.
---
Even then: Do you have 3 turns and 3 open spaces on the board to create a triple if you are tier 5/6 and you desperately need jaraxxus to heal you?
---
but one of them is upside down now
---
Well, it's ok, but it's no doomsayer frost nova. Because if there's a sea giant (8/8) you randomly have a 8/3 staring you down still. And including frost nova just to combo with this seems questionable, and running both barrel and doomsayer is probably overkill.
---
This card is very simmilar to doomsayer, but i dont think its better. This thing has the advantage that you can play it on turn 1. But normally you can wait to turn 2, and then Doomsayer is better because of the 7 Health. But anyways i think this will see play.
---
Maybe he just has three more attack when you’re at the damage step ( when all the enemy minions are dead )
---
How are you the only person memeing lul
---
I like him in wild pogo rogue. Especially fun if you combine him with a stepped sonya :)
---
Ey, double Wrath Weaver! That's pretty good /s
---
highlander decks in wild. with banker and zola you can get a lot of copies of strong cards. and this is also just good on any decent non-battlecry minion like applebaum or khartut defender.
---
And you can ping something like a 3/1 as mage and play this card at 3 mana
---
There’s a neat mobile trick where if you close the app and reopen it once the battle starts it skips animation times and puts you into the tavern has given me a max so far of 180 seconds on buying/selling
---
U can get rid of Doomsayer if you play nothing. Not with this barrel tho
---
Now I can run 4 doomsayers, perfect!
---
I saw it in some greedy as f nzoth priest list, and ofc OTK paladin
---
Giving N'Zoth to rogue, priest and warrior was also a bad idea
---
Surely it would deal more damage when you win a fight, so not cosmetic
---
Bringing thaurissan in standard allows for stuff that wouldn't be otherwise possible
---
Single dads deserve cats too!
---
It wouldn't replace Doomsayer when it's combo'd with cards like Frost Nova but it's probably better against really aggressive decks. Although I feel like the 1 mana discount is less relevant with a card like Doomsayer since it's not like you can play minions the same turn to take advantage of the extra mana.
---
Hmmm
---
GASP! NEFARIONS HERO POWER!
---
Delolve??? Fuck no uninteractive OP card
---
I'm happy that it's not 3 mana, when cards that cost more than 10 mana is a thing.
---
Fun.
---
To do what kripp was describing you'd need 4. 3 to combine into a golden and a 4th to sell back to generate infinite gold.
---
That's my point, it limits you from making certain plays without much benefit. If this change was made it's impossible to have your Merc eye attack 2nd. That limits your options, that's worse than a card that you could have attack in any order.
---
Because you throw it from above.
---
Me use Moger the Oger! Smash! Go face no matter what!
---
I personally think it's pretty accurate for charge. Think of it this way: All of the minions at the start of the game have summoning sickness. Effectively, it's like your other minions have 0 attack for that turn so the next available charge minion attacks until there are none left. Once all of the charge minions have attacked, it's like your right-most minion has finished attacking and it loops back to the left most minion. This ensures that after 2 rounds of combat, charge minions have 1 extra round of attack before all non-charge minions.
---
The game still alternates between both sides of the board until all charge minions are exhausted, it's just sometimes your board attacks more often at the start, kinda like a minion with windfury.
---
Power\* word shield.
---
So there isn't a new Skycap'n Kragg, which is a disgrace.
---
Buff it up and it'll do 5 damage for a few turns. Doesn't actually destroy itself like doomsayer so you can probably cheese it somehow
---
Cheers for that
---
People have basically figured out that the timer starts when combat starts. So if the battle lasts longer, then the timer is shorter. Not sure how it would work if combat lasts too long though.
---
M4nu#2818 NA, 80G quest. I show, you go first :D
---
I would love if it gave you another silverback. Basically, it is a bad card, but with literary infinite value in its ability to always give you a tempo negative play. Maybe have it give it to you at the start of next turn, so you won't be able to echo it.
---
I still remember sending a bunch of wisp to explode for the lols.
---
ever hear of sathovarring shirvallah, you just dont come back from that of you are any form of tempo deck
---
He meant 5 or 7 dmg to the barrel or doomsayer. It's harder to kill on turn than doomsayer on turn 3.
---
But you generally don't have both a giant AND nova doom at the same time, especially considering most mage decks will be highlander

Did they realy did something so du.mb and retarded/some1 to get a 6tier minion with 3tier minion and 2nd tier tavern?not as is surprising because we talk here about blizzard-the biggest trolls of them all??/
---
My least favourite thing is it not offering \[\[Hex\]\] against \[\[Convincing Infiltrator\]\] when facing Big Priest
---
More players in standard
---
Different metas
---
Longer collection/dust value also cheaper to play wild as you don’t need to acquire many new cards for existing decks
---
I'd say you should give wild a try, specially if you have nay deckbuilding ability. 
---
Wild is the place you can take the best advantage of you cards and knowledge. Even though there are some popular decks, you can build counter decks and play around (secret mage is doing quite well and it's not impossible to play around it).
---
Standard is at is largest ATM, having a rotation in April and with the DoD around the corner you'll be missing a ton of cards, and you are not gonna make the best out of your dust.
---
I'd say you stick to your collection and see what you can do, once you get some new cards, buy 10 packs of each exp to get legendaries, you can take profit of what you got.

Turns out a top tier hero might be good if you play him
---
They exploded there to kill Archimonde, a demon lord similar to Lord Jarraxus, but much stronger. He wanted to corrupt the world tree, the biggest source of "magic" in Azeroth guarded by the Night Elves and upon the explosion, they destroyed both Archimonde and the tree, stopping the demons from taking control over it.
---
Unity

Against aggro its not really "hope" to get discounted, its nearly a guarantee. Thoguh it depends on how "aggro" is the aggro exactly. But in general aggro isnt nearly as strong as it used to be, there's barely any decent decks (evolve shaman aside) that can kill a control deck fast. And stabilizing of going on the offensive with a i.e. high cost dragon with a useful battlecry can be huge. Especially for i.e. highlander decks that are usually slow but dont run much removal.
---
I almost lost against two Water Elementals last night because he insisted on giving me Shadowflame over Brawl, even though I had exactly 5 mana left over. My strongest minion only had 4 attack...
---
Ngl kinda forgot topsy turvy existed lmao. I totally get divine spirit rotate now
---
I’ll just wait here to be seated... 
---
Doesn’t look like bob finished his shift yet...
---
&gt; being overloaded is not that reliable in normal quest shaman.
---
Very, very important point here. IIRC, the only overload in the deck comes from the 1 mana lackey murloc and discovered spell. If you draw the murloc early, you have to play it generally for quest competition credit.
---
No? That would be crazy spaghetti.
---
This is waaaaay too strong
---
Wild takes a certain mindset. For me, I like it way more than Standard. Wild has every Hearthstone card ever made and you can play any deck that you like. Old favourites, new favourites, competitive, just for fun.
---
To me there is nothing better in Hearthstone than queueing into an opponent and beating their meta deck with a deck I designed. I don't care about my rank (been to Legend once in Standard, once in Wild, have nothing to prove). I just get to enjoy each and every game and work towards my 1k portraits (Rogue and Warlock done, Mage is 30 wins away!).
---
If you are the sort of person who gets angry because the mouth breathers are out in full force and this is the sixth game you have queued into against Secret Mage (or Big Priest, or Odd Paladin, or Odd Rogue, or SN1P-SN4P Warlock, or, or, or..) Wild might not be for you.
---
If every time you hit the "Play" button you can accept that you could either be playing against a top tier deck or someone's favourite homebrew jank and find the joy in that then you will have a great time with Wild indefinitely.
---
A few days ago I went murlocs and miraculously got 2 triples on 5, got offered megasaurs both times, but didnt get offered divine shield or poisonous either time. I then eventually leveled to 6, found a third megasaur, and got offered poisonous but no divine shield, but then by then all but one of my murloc dudes already had poisonous. I think i came in 4th.
---
If u give it 1 health it can go off twice
---
Just wanted to see if I can make this combo good King Krush,boom zooka ,octosari, Tundra rhino basically if you just run those three.play boom-zo 
---
Bring them all back with Revenge
---
Then you heal it for that sweet quest synergy
---
You can also test things like this by asking a friend to put the cards into a deck and borrowing it from them in a friendly match.
---
I’ve used it in quest Druid to duplicate kun
---
Suddenly that lackey that summons a Random 1-cost minion got a lot wilder
---
They will attack twice, they are not the "same" minions, so it does not count as they have already attacked that turn.
---
Radiance doesnt heal minions
---
It's not that bad on mobile.
---
Actual people can't and shouldn't play 24/7 like an AI could.
---
Complicated picture there. The first says that philo earns highest among humanities majors, 75th overall (at mid career). The second says even among humanities majors philos have high unemployment, but their median wage is better than that of many other fields inc outside the humanities, with only undergraduate degrees. This is compatible with my preferred explanation: that philo attracts some of the smartest and also some of the most useless people in the humanities. 
---
Btw the second mentions Crawford’s book on working with your hands, which is an expansion of this essay, which is one of the best things I’ve ever read. https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft
---
Wild has been wonderful - I’m not grinding for legend but 5-10 has been a blast
---
This is the number one problem with the game right now and how they address it will be a very big deal.
---
It’s crazy weird that no one has divine shield that late into the game
---
For now the main reward is having fun.
---
Also every three top-4 finishes gives you 10 gold.
---
Looks like the hearthstone cardback is photoshopped over another icon.
---
this is just a symbol code error
---

Well, it's just really hard to increase murlocs' health most of the time, because there are only a couple of ways to do that, so I would say that they are pretty inconsistent too. 
---
As for OP's murloc, I completely agree with you. I dont think they would ever implement a card with echo into the BG at all.
---
The cute part about this card is if you buff its health, it can survive its own effect and trigger again the following turn.
---
You could factor this in. Give the AI 4 hours a day, which most legend try hards put in, and the AI makes legend no problem.
---
People think piloting takes skill is a joke.
---
Another example, take a world championship game. The best of the best, smartest of the smartest, most complex of the complex, the top pilots.
---
Watch their decision making, and then watch Twitch chat call 90% of the plays.
---
Last example, go play Shaman. Make bad decisions on purpose. Still climb the ladder.
---
Seriously it’s a joke. The main reason people playing BG right now is because you can’t just follow a website guide and you can’t just copy paste a meta every game, you need to be able to think on your feet which is a skill long gone from Constructed.
---
Sleepers are often undervalued yes, but clearly broken cards like this one are not. Jade Idol per example, Ultimate infestation, raiding party, ect. There a lot of false negatives when it comes to predicting cards, but people are usually right about broken stuff, asides from some examples like Troggzor (and to be honest that was wat back in the day, people has become better at predicting cards with time).
---
Murlocs are super good, if you manage to get Megasaur AND you manage to get divine shields + poisonous on all of them. If you did both above then congratz, you won the match. So you have at least 2 different hard conditions to meet to finish 1st, if you don't get DS you will lose to Cobalts.
---
And I swear I have never ever saw anyone finish first with just beasts. Top 4 sure, but there is no fucking chance it beats competent menagerie or mechs setup. SImply because of lack of DS and poisonous.

**Depth charge**
---
A depth charge is an anti-submarine warfare weapon. It is intended to destroy a submarine by being dropped into the water nearby and detonating, subjecting the target to a powerful and destructive hydraulic shock. Most depth charges use high explosive charges and a fuze set to detonate the charge, typically at a specific depth. Depth charges can be dropped by ships, patrol aircraft, and helicopters.

Where has the devs ever said that "Bringing Wild cards to Standard was a mistake"? The only reference i can find of it is this post
---
But youll attack the 30 attack Nightmare Amalgam with Taunt
---
Yes, by definition chances are relatively slim for that to happen since you have to draw alex *the next turn*, not just 'earlier than y'
---
Or a high roll depending on what you want to do. If you just get one, it could wipe your opponent's board, including the two other 1-drops, and leave you with a 3/4 taunt, all for 4 mana.
---
You mean like meese
---
Not to mention 5k isn’t “that bad” (I say as a 5.5k), it’s a positive over the starting point of 4k
---
How do you consistently get mages apprentice?
---
honestly, this is like the 100th post about a high tier minion in battelground. The answer is simple: [[Shifter Zerus]]
---
Highrolled on Shifter Zerus.
---
Aha. Thanks!
---
Divine shield is only necessary if you want to deal a lot of damage. Just poisonous with high health is enough to win a fight most of the time if you have 5 decent murlocs but you will not have much of a board left.
---
Probably got Shifter Zerus from their discover and lucked out with Lightfang
---
I was thinking about this the other day and I think it would be fine in current state. I assume they would take away the 3 attack weapon, but it could keep the 15 health + inferno hero power change. 
---
"But you could get easy triples"
---
I mean you would need 3 board spaces and 3 turns to do so, seems balanced to me tbh. 
---
"But endless health"
---
You'd need an empty board space to use him, so I think it's fair that you would have to sacrifice a unit late game just to get some HP. 
---
Being added to the "summon a random legendary" pool is pretty good as well. 
---
Honestly if anything, I would think it wasn't that useful.
---
surely they could just make a tweak to poison and check if the minion has poison before doing the damage effect text?
---
"Summon a 1-cost minion for your opponent"... and it's a dragon!
---
Value!
---
Windfury is rare, but great, evolve poisoned amalgmation and see it wreck multiple bodies in a row.
---
Priest is gonna love this; power word shield or divine spirit this for a ... barrel of laughs
---
Strong answer to wide token boards that can leave your higher stat minions alive... Especially with taunts or freeze effects.
---
thats so stupid. When a player swings for lethal its calculated way before you see the last minion go in. The visual effect appears after everything is processed. Look at divine shield for instance, much fast animation speed because the bubble pops off with the damage.
---
i have 22 first places and im at 4100 rating, wins/losses barely mean anything. also he is on 4.8 k at the end.
---
I’ve been playing it in a wild Reno paladin with the death knight and holy wrath combos. Shirvallah into Sathrovar is a win condition in itself, and has won me a lot more games than holy wrath. Apart from Shirvallah I don’t see much use for the card however
---
You had years to buy these, now people who may have held off because of the price can buy them cheap. People who won’t buy them now never would have bought them, it’s just business.
---
but you don't always die to combo, half the time if they don't have the combo they make the biggest minion they can and hope it lives. Having only swaps would them them still combo but would hurt the deck overall.
---
It's not a bug, but they are working on changes related to seeing the same player often
---
&gt; this is totally useless in wild.
---
Isn't that 90% of Hearthstone cards anyway?
---
Thx, I'll add it tomorrow :P
---
Implies you can discover SBP again.
---
NightElf is balanced btw
---
It probably is, you can see them in the vvideo, or in my discord I guess :)
---
did we stop? :D
---
I can factor in that I'm bad at the game,
---
I enjoy it but I can't make it past rank 5, even with a meta deck, piloting does matter.
---
kinda, cuz he gives them out when he has no idea what to do :D
---
Sometimes there is no mana reducing skill. Your one out is a board clear and he doesn’t give it to you. I’ve lost multiple games (all wild) where he refused to give me a board clear with very lethal on board.
---
go back to stormfront you scum
---
Congrats! This made me smile. I can appreciate a goal-oriented approach
---
Kripp was surprised to see it in his collection 2 days ago.
---
If you're playing a depth charge, the enemy needs to have some minions on board (otherwise why are you playing it?).  So the enemy has the opportunity to make favourable trades for them, if bouncing their 3/3 into your mountain giant so it dies from barrel is advantageous for them, they can choose to do that.
---
I don't think the 'only 5 damage' would ever be of benefit to you unless you are playing 12+ health minions.  The enemy can turn it into a doomsayer if they want to by trading into your 8 health minions fairly easily.
---
I haven't seen it yet... is it tier 5 or 6?
---
Zephyr in wild is also such a pain to get to work against somethings.
---
He just doesn't recognize Loatheb's effects on the battlefield (wanted a taunt, he gave me 3 uncastable spells). 
---
Also i was playing vs ice block on a mage (had triggered every other secret) and zephyrs offers me 3 burn spell variants instead of any secret removal when I had like 2x lethal on board.

5/0/7 | At the start of your turn, set this minion's Attack to 7.  
---
So... did you win?
---
not quite right. They can attach trigger to phase 1: "when poisonous creature attacks the target, the animation of the poison is shown". And only then the second phase
---
The Blast is coming !
---
nope wasnt me. chillax, dont lose ur cool just because someone downvoted you. so easy with calling out assholes 
---
i have no idea about the animation coding but since you have explicit idea, lets just hope devs see your post and enlightened by it. i still think there may be more to it though as coding changes in one area can lead to bugs in others. i have zero idea if animation is easy to fix or not, the devs have said theyre looking into it and thats all there is to it. absolutely nothing about the difficulty.

Great idea!  I’ve always thought there should be some way to collect the card backs you missed.

Rarely allies with any but elves? Pardon me?
---
What elves were they allied with, exactly?
---
Counterpoint to what you said about Falstad: Falstad Wildhammer became known as Falstad ***Dragonreaver.***
---
Kind of makes the point about Gryphon Riders being used to defeat dragons all the more pronounced. Yes, he helped free Alexstrasza (also cheers to Rhonin and Vereesa for that), but that's literally one engagement.
---
Agree.

Fiert War Axe never saw play after the nerf.
---
Shaman weapon:
---
Damage: 3

Durability: 3
---

Flavor text: Doesn't lose Durability while you control a Dragon.
---
3 heroes and 2 new cards. Amalgam buff isn’t until January IIRC.
---
I got better names for this card:
---
-Packfiller
---
-Tribediluter
---
-Yetipricier
---
I dunno, I feel like without a significant portion of RNG in the offered cards, people would learn very quickly what the optimal decks are to make, so you'd end up seeing a bunch of decks that were 85%+ the same. You'd probably even see deck builders created that read your available cards and spit out three different optimal deck options from that. 
---
I've seen people complaining that strategies in Battlegrounds have been optimized now, so everyone is following the same strategies, making it boring. I think you'll see this issue in any mode that uses a limited number of cards.
---
Brann does?
---
What's next? If you're holding a Dragon, Discover a card in your opponent's deck?  Now that would be crazy.
---
Yes, having them as craftable could be another good option.
---
I can't add those to my standard deck tho.
---
My comment is not an argument. In fact it's me telling you that Blizzard does not care about your preference of change. Won't happen lol. So why waste your time spewing a whole novel about the lore of the card and your silly preference? Blizzard will do as they please, simple as that xD
---
deathwing works well for dragon synergy too lmao
---
Anything to skip the animations, seems legit
---
OK.
---
High likely matched with people below 4000
---
TEAM 5, HIRE THIS MAN
---
Doesn't have to be a very good minion for it to be worth it. Anything beyond a 2/2 is already a lot of value for 3 mana, and you can almost guaranteed hit better than that.
---
I wonder if the description for this is going to be a beast wars reference.
---
Why would you play a worse [[Abomination]] though?
---
At least you can’t summon 20 copies of it like Sylvanas. These seems like a much more “fair” version of a mind control effect.
---

5/4/4 | Taunt. Deathrattle: Deal 2 damage to ALL characters.  
---
Aren't they removing the Wild cards at that time as well from Standard at that time?
---
does anyone notice "dieon sanders"
---
Heroes of the Storm engine would be sick.
---
Will probably see play in most priest decks. This is a solid midrange effect.
---
1. 2 New cards, including Floating Watcher and King Bagurgle (King Bagurgle is a Tier 5 6/3 Murloc with "Battlecry and Deathrattle: Give all other friendly Murlocs +2/+2.")
---
2. Nightmare Amalgam probably getting nerfed to a 2/2 version of itself (will no longer be called Nightmare Amalgam).
---
3. A few new Heroes as far as I'm aware.
---
4. Dragons? Or is that coming later?
---
Thanks, 👍🏼
---
They have to heal it to full health every turn and they will not always draw those cards.
---
We don't have technology yet.
---
Why waste your time telling people they're wasting their time?
---
I'm not going to remove this thread, or change my behaviour. Certainly not to suit your pessimistic complaining.
---
So take your own advice: I will do as I please, simple as that - don't waste your time.
---
It seems like a card that wants to go into a Midrange Priest deck, although I’m not sure if thats going to exist. We’ll have to wait and see more Invoke cards.
---
Too slow, anything these days that does not immediately affect the board is a tier B card at best by default.
---
These cards look really cool.  Did you post on r/customhearthstone ?
---
That being said I don’t think they would really work.

4/3/3 Dragon | Battlecry: If you're holding a Dragon, deal 3 damage to all other minions.  
---
This will be interesting. No disrespect to either Kibler or Kripp: Kibler is usually more open to seeing the potential for cards when revealed, whereas Kripp will call things he feels are trash, trash. Curious if that tone will come out on a livestream with one of the cards’ main designers sitting next to him.
---
Well done, you beat the game.
---
At that time yes they will be removing those cards at that time
---
To make it even more ironic, hammers/maces are one of the only weapon types that Hunters *can’t* equip in WoW.
---
Fiery War Axe quietly joins Silverback Patriarch in the corner.
---
Yeah, there’s the bonus of a free 4/5, but as a Deathrattle minion you don’t really care about stats. Maybe if there’s a good way to give minions Taunt like [[Defender of Argus]]?
---
Maybe it's because it's a hammer you're throwing (ranged = Hunter).
---
Right? I was so confused when I saw the green boarder. Trump rolled again :(
---
S9 here. Its unplayable after round 4.
---
I think the flavor of not losing durability when dragons are present actually makes sense.  Like you said gryphon riders were a counter to dragons, so as long as there are dragons to kill the weapon is needed
---
Huh, I was under the impression that Wizards of the Coast/Dungeons and Dragons had trademarked the word Mindflayer. You aren't allowed to reference them (and a few other trademarked monster names like Beholder) in 3rd party rpg products.
---
Wonder if this causes a lawsuit?

---
If dragon priest exists, maybe. They certainly aren’t pushing it as hard as [[Duskbreaker]], though.
---
You get the effect over and over again with deathrattles through reborn, copying a death rattle of another minion, or summoning a minion that died.  I think this is going to be better than people think.
---
Had a 5th place finish get me +3 recently, around the same rank.
---
That doesn't matter because it's a legendary so you can't guarantee drawing it on turn 3. Also it needs a tempo shell to be played you aren't going to throw this into a control deck because it's "solid".
---
Only because every other mode became worst in comparison.
---
There are far more important things for a game than which kind of themes the game pieces fit
---
So what you're suggesting is we suppose we are in the most specific situation possible instead of giving advice to OP?
---
[[Chillmaw]] didn’t see play and it had taunt. This seems bad.
---
I like it, it's support for a board based tempo/midrange priest deck. At this point I'm happy with anything that's not supporting resurrect priest or combo priest.
---
&gt; It shouldn't be surprising there have been babies born and started preschool since your phone came out
---
3-4 years for a phone, especially when they cost so much these days, is not a long time and when the regular game works fine on said phone you really shouldn't be phone-shaming it just becuase BGs don't work.
---
I've got an iPhone 8 plus (Released Q3 2017) and if I get a turn with a lot of animations (poisons, deathrattles, etc) I will still be in the middle of them when I start to see other players start their next turns via upgrading and making triples popups. After 2-3 games in a row there are lots of frame rate drops and I've got to close the app and re-open.
---
So sure, my phone is "old" and his phone is much "older" but when the regular game works fine and it is only BG that are shit, the phone shouldn't be blamed as the mode is clearly not optimized at all right now and can be improved so that those not able to buy a new phone each year can still play.
---
Except for maces, funnily enough.
---
The kind of decks that have a board state that can actually threaten giant mage usually don’t carry debuffs, and only a few damaging cards, if any.
---
This is pretty close to everyone’s reaction with it.

Could have been added to Basic instead of radiance.

Great card. Wrong class.
---
This is an anti-aggro card. Aggro decks usually don’t carry debuffs, and have very few damaging spells.
---
How is this upvoted when you don't even know the cards or read them

Nerfed entomb with a body.

It deals damage to its self to

Not quite, it dealt 3 to your own minions too.

Duskbreaker PTSD
---
I’ve never had Mobile issues. So I’m not sure
---
I like the jewel in it's wait so there doubt it's a Legendary.
---
Yes, its not bad. However it doesnt have that immediate impact. It forces your opponent to deal with it, IF, they can’t kill you with what they have on board. 
---
This card is nice if you are preempting board flood, or if you are trying to win the board back in midgame after losing it to aggro.
---
&gt; Dude, no one cares.
---
That's literally objectively false lmao, way to start off with a whimper
---
i don't know man u can active it on turn 6 on u're one so it might see play
---
Deathrattle board clears never work.  What a waste of a card.
---
Chillmaw was always bad.
---
I've been playing it in wild Joustrock.
---
Yes, I'm a sadist.
---
yes there is a card that kill a minions a resummon it (3mana 3/3) and if it works with the new legendary it might be good. It is also a pretty good tempo card with murmy so possibilities are growing with tempo/mirange dragon priest
---
Yeah, I can’t see this being anywhere as oppressive as Sylvanas. It’s a solid card if your opponent has a big minion, but otherwise it’s pretty average.
---
Stored as numbers, but not conceptually conceived as such.
---
Well I did end up getting 2nd place because that one green cunt discovered ice block two times in a row.
---
No one mentioning how sick the art is?
---
Nice.
---
but worse
---
I’m imagining it against something like Obsidian or Spider Bomb, but that is pretty niche unless the meta has some strong minion of that sort.

Do you think any non new phones have magically lost the ability to play games?
---
A game that's a fucking card game.
---
Lol there's no excuse for it lagging playing on a bloody toaster.
---
I don't recall Patriarch ever getting the nerf hammer, but Fiery Win Axe got downgraded to Sharp Fork not too long ago.
---
I think the only way this fits is dwarves wield hammers -&gt; brann is a dwarf and is our representative hunter for this xpac.  I still don't think it should really be a hunter weapon, but that might have been their logic?
---
Too everyone complaining about this being a flavor fail for being a hunter weapon you have to remember that every weapon is a hunter weapon.
---
It's too slow, if you give them a turn or 2 to deal with the card it's not gonna be good.
---
Don't forget the new 1 mana Doomsayer-in-a-barrel card!
---
Anything can become a ranged weapon if you throw it.
---
Some people probably still believe big preist is op in wild.
---
The art for this is amazing
---
I have been suggesting this as a first class feature, not a third party or external option tough.
---
Yeah, it's decent, not bad when seen that way, but considering it's a legendary, doesn't do anything on board, and depends on what your opponent already has on board, and taking into account other classes are getting better things altogether, this is really underwhelming.
---
It's not bad, just really underwhelming as everything in priest is right now.
---
Specifically, a dragon-based board clear. They really don't have enough of them.
---
Perhaps Priest can get a spell like "Return all non-dragon minions to the hand"? It seems like a very in-character spell to me, right?
---
You can try to search either here or on outofcards. This was talked when they announced the random card back.
---
They indicated somewhere that there is inflation of ranks to 6500, so that would be where I'd consider end of season rank 5.
---
If I play in my ipad air 2 I can usually get through one game just fine. It feels like there is a memory leak though.  Almost without fail, starting that second game will feel more and more like a slide show.  I'll often have to restart my client mid combat animations just to get it running smoothly again. I'll get reconnected and be back in the tavern with plenty of time to make my purchases.  
---
It feels pretty good if only playing the one game, but the overall experience is so bad that I actively avoid it.

The character representing the hunter during the year of the dragon was Brann Bronzebeard. Both his brothers used that kind of weapon, so it still fits him a little. Beside, during the last adventure, Brann's classes were both hunter and warrior, so even though this weapon would be better themed for a warrior, due to Brann representing the hunter class it still fits a little.
---
Good one.
---
They need a good tier 6 minion
---
Region?
---
No issues with lag spikes on my s10. I see no issues with a nice little animation.
---
It's a bug/feature that Blizzard acknowledged and said they intended to address, so that there would be at least two games before seeing the same opponent again.
---
Don't you guys have phones?
---
&gt; Divine shield, poisonous, windfury amalgam is amazing.
---
FTFY
---
Changing this will confuse new players. (probable Blizzard way of thinking about this)
---
Definitely doesn't seem HS related but could loosely be considered art. I guess OP isn't in any mood to logically defend themself though judging by their response here. Lol.
---
Imagine this card during the cubelock days 😅
---
Which element of Hearthstone is this about?
---
The opposite of ideal, but still a choice..
---
Lich King was one of the heroes I think.
---
Don't try to confuse Blizzard with your sound logic. They are too busy trying not to confuse new players, and already quite confused themselves not finding any. :D
---
Being related is hardly grounds for a character's theme fitting a weapon. It would be like saying Arator is a Hunter and a Paladin because his parents are Alleria and Turalyon.
---
Brann Bronzebeard is a Warrior as well, he served as a lieutenant to Anduin Lothar in the Second War, but just because he's a dwarf doesn't mean a Stormhammer fits his repertoire. Just like how Garrosh Hellscream isn't a Blademaster.
---
Also, Brann was representative of Hunters in Saviours of Uldum, and presumably Descent of Dragons, not the entire year. But in any case, the relation of Stormhammer to Brann Bronzebeard is so much looser compared to what it has to the Warrior class. I don't think it's reasonable to say that Brann as a dual-class means you can throw Warrior traits into the Hunter class and vice versa.
---
The same way I don't want Rogue effects landing in the Mage class just because Reno is there.
---
The 4 supporting cards were also moved to Hall of Fame, so that is a total of 6 cards.
---
Either patches or rag HAS to go. Then togwaggle or pyramad for me
---
Nope! He's a master of Klaxxi alchemy and amber-craft. The life-giving amber for the Klaxxi acts as a sustaining and nourishing substance that can be used to grant a form of suspended animation or prolonged hibernation to the Klaxxi paragons, and the game allows you to find and rescue a huge number of these paragons who all embodied some element of mantid warfare (mind control, flight, scimitar slashing, genetic modification, etc.) Klaxxi's whole deal was being the paragon of poisons, and apparently right before subjecting himself to the amber preservation process he gave himself a lethal dose of every poison he thought prudent.
---
As a weird side effect, when your character brings him out of hibernation, he's mutated a bit. Being constantly on the verge of succumbing to poison while also being frozen in the restorative amber allowed his body to adapt over the eons. As such, he's now completely and totally immune to all poisons.
---
Now that I know this, I love that he gives you weird toxins when you play him. Unfortunately, though, I kinda wish that Blizzard would buff him a bit by making him immune to the Poisonous keyword. That'd be a weird effect to add years after the fact, though.
---
trash cards in DoD OmegaLUL
---
EU btw
---
Actually gold shifter transforms into golden versions of other minions so its quite op
---
This card just seems like a flavor fail all around. These hammers are synonymous with griffons, not dragons, and elemental weapons, especially hammers, are strongly linked to shamans, not hunters.
---
Are you really that stupid?
---
I think in the next round of new heroes he will be the first to go (not on the 5th) unless he somehow manages to become middle of the pack. He has proven far too hard to balance correctly (used to give poisonous, but was too OP), and idk how they could do it. Maybe he can start with a 1/2 ooze with poisonous or something.
---
I never claimed that it wasn't random. I know what I've found, because I've noted down what occurred, and I would never be so mind-numbingly stupid as to question the data that someone else has collected that you could not possibly know about (outside of stalking me, which I doubt you're doing).  
---
I'm 7.5k, what's your point? You know nothing about the situation at hand here and now you're trying to flex as if somehow you being good at a video game means you can extract the data from my Hearthstone history. Smart.  
---
Here's the spreadsheet, I'm sure its nuance and complexity will suit you just fine.  [https://imgur.com/a/B6nIpsR](https://imgur.com/a/B6nIpsR)
---
I wouldn't run this without taunt, no way. I think ppl are VASTLY underestimating how easy it is to play around a death rattle board clear
---
What you don’t seem to understand is that this, like all melee weapons, are in fact hunter loot. 
---
*rolls need*
---
I can see a singleton shaman quest  deck being disgusting
---
You know mindflyers are from d&amp;d right?
---
Will other cards be updated to use the new terminology consistently?
---
The Discover a Dragon cards are for the 'good' classes.
---
I've heard about all of these except Lightfang.  I'm not really sure how much that's actually going to affect anything, since in battle they usually end up as Shield fodder.
---
divine shield + poison + windfury murlocs are the best comp you can have, it doesn't even matter what the stats are.
---
You can't lose the game if you die before they do
---
Are you saying Evolve Shaman is worse than Cubelock?
---
You sound like the kind of guy who thinks Mage is a good class.
---
You mean [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqk5yAfEbxI). It works. It's great for memeing.
---
With rush
---
This is a chad turn 1 play
---
Why is this not a warrior card?
---
The fact that there are people calling that card strong makes me laugh.
---
The enforcers could counter divine shield. Or dreadlord; with changed card texts, of course.

* Gryphon Riders from Warcraft III did, in fact, use Stormhammers. [[Source]](http://classic.battle.net/war3/human/units/gryphonrider.shtml)  
---
* In classic World of Warcraft, Shamans were only available to the Horde.  
---
* Dwarves could be Hunters, but not Shamans.  
---
* Hunters, however, cannot use Maces, which weapon group includes Hammers.
---
**Conclusion:** Warcraft lore has never been particularly consistent, so this inconsistency is actually highly consistent.
---
It's easy to generate value with.
---
Whether or not it actually fits into a deck is another question.
---
I thought it was a shaman weapon until I read the 50 comments saying wtf why is this hunter.
---
Lol don't worry, I won that one. I didn't keep triple the other dude and got eventually rid of him - would be too greedy. Ended the game with 17 health

Nobody minded I guess

The yetipricier got me good.

Companies tend not to keep spare art around, the art team has enough to work on
---
Yeah u know the excitement dies alittle when u know they will nerf 5 plus cards next year but it’s like that every new expansion
---
+1 attack is the important stat for cleave minions and cobalt guardian. A lot of times when you have a hydra it’s worth it to take zoobot primarily for the buff on the hydra. Wagtoggle hero power would hit the more important stat on at least as many targets as zoobot for half as much gold. The main exception to my argument would be poison minions I suppose, where attack is irrelevant.
---
That said a rework sounds reasonable. I just think the difference in power level between the best heroes and worst heroes should be reduced, which can be done by removing or reworking the trash-tier heroes. Can also nerf the good heroes, but I find all of the good heroes pretty fun in their current forms personally.
---
What if you play that 7 mana minion that adds a copy of your opponents hand to your hand? Do you get a 12 card hand or does it stop at 10?
