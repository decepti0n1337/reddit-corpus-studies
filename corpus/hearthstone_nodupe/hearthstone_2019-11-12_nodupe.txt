I have current update.  My game still crashes every time I try to squelch AND all my golden cards are bugged, and disappear from decks randomly.
---
---
---
How powerful would it have to be for it to be better than having that spread across three bodies?
---
Battlegrounds is actually extremely fun
---
no.
---
Well if it is the case that they were previously banned for making rude antagonistic comments like that, then it would be a tad annoying to see them shamelessly back at it again. I'm sure anyone can agree a community is generally better when there are fewer assholes posting in it. 
---

---
But I'm just speculating here. There's no way real way to tell someone is an alt unless they're stupid about it. And even if they are, they could have made the new account for any other reason, like you suggested.
---
Competitively *and* flavor-wise.
---
You actually do get rewards though, 10 gold for every 3 (wins? top 4s? games played, can't remember just know I'm getting gold from it)
---
It already has wild cards.
---
&gt; you need to develop a wide board so you can contest the tokens and then MC wins them the game.
---
There are multiple ways of answering a wide board without having to put 4+ minions. Like starting to put something on the board to relieve pressure int her first turns so a wide murloc board never happens, to playing spells, to playing bigger taunt minions they have to trade their board to go trough.
---
Also, just because you dislike playing against murloc decks doesnt mean they should be removed from the game. They are healthy, they offer different playstyles (not only aggro) and they arent even that predominant at all in the history of the game. You claimed stuff in your post to backup your arguments as why murlocs should be removed, and all of them have been proven wrong.
---
You have an old version and a new version, nice
---
So everyone on the r/hearthstone subreddit?
---
&gt; Open beta for Hearthstone Battlegrounds is here and open to all players! 
---
except EU. feelsEUman
---
It's rng
---
It's still not that good in my eyes. Why would you get a cover up by the same person that fucked up the old tattoo?
---
Maybe I said it a little harshly but I just don't understand the lighting choices she made, it's good of you to support your friend but maybe she should work in another field? Idk, I get that tattoo isn't the ideal medium but it looks off to me. I doodled over it with my finger on my phone to kinda show what I mean, https://i.ibb.co/1q4GLYK/IMG-20191111-224154.jpg I think you shoulda just given her money if you wanted to help out and got it covered up by someone else.
---
titlegore
---
I just picked Toki and noticed the hero power cost two!
---
To explain Zapp going from "6 -&gt; 8", apparently he was considered a 6 cost minion for Effigy purposes.  He is still Tier 6.
---
i would call a 5/12 almost worth 9 mana, and then add those broken sheeps...he actually outplayed you
---
The old tattoo wasn't a fuck up, it was done when she was 16 and bought a $20 gun of Amazon lol the old tattoo was like 5 little shitty blown out lines
---
Oh it's a Joke...and that explain the idiot part, I suppose.
---
Suicide decks shine for these quests. Deal as much damage to yourself as possible warlock quests can be done on turn 3 I believe this way.
---
They are giving away like 50k keys or something to get into the closed beta.  
---
Or would you rather have the beta not be disclosed until it's open beta? They can do whatever they want with their game
---
compared to what he could of got it’s a bit lacking
---
&gt; You are 1 card short of a full deck.
---
Maybe not the best deck list I’ve ever seen.  Still, no reason to insult the kid, Blizz.
---
You're also getting the rewards of the bundle, no?
---
Yes, its either find enough +2 health in between to survive until you go to 5 and 6 Stars or bust for me.
---
So it's their try to get people to not surrender anymore? Sounds stupid
---
Dunno, I like fucked up black line tattoos. But color will age badly if not done really good
---
They also gave away like 50k keys on twitch
---
Welp, that definitely kills my desire to play COD Mobile. It’s too late for me on Reddit :/
---
I think compared to the picture it could have been a lot cleaner. The green is really dark, and the flowers look like... not flowers. It's shaped funny and the dimensions are off. 
---
That said, it's not my tattoo or my body. If I didn't have the HS art right next to it, idk if I'd feel as strongly "against" as I do now. But at the same time, if OP is happy it doesn't matter.
---
Effigy? Still confused on that one
---
Great changes all around tho i was literally talking about all of these, also 2health instead of 3 for the lich, nefarian up to 2 cost, and brick by brick +3hp
---
It's also going to get touched up next week bc my skin didn't hold a lot of the green too well the first run. And a couple spots on the petals. You're not being harsh though it's all good everybody has an opinion
---
Tried to play it on my NA account and it's not available there yet either. Blizzard needs to get their sh*t together!
---
&gt; I'm sure anyone can agree a community is generally better when there are fewer assholes posting in it. 
---
Don't be so harsh on yourself.
---
I'm not getting my once daily free reroll on quests
---
Problem for both Demons and Murlocs is that they're pretty consistently shit post midgame unless you're getting the god rolls or you're playing their designated leader AND you're getting a bunch of free passes.
---
Effigy is one of the secrets Akazamzarak can get with his Hero Power.
---
&gt;&gt;Quest cards will now display the Quest Reward when selected in the Collection Manager.
---
Woah, and it only took 8 expansions!
---
The update just now, the S-Pen still doesn't work, I'm a bit disappointed :(
---
I think the patch notes are wrong here, or at least unclear. People are saying you still get a higher tier minion on the end. I don't know why they would change the text though, unless the last minion is now totally random?
---
The way the patch has it worded can't possibly be true, an extra mana for an extra minion? You'd always just push the button twice.
---
Yeah, they finally improved this after a long time. 
---
With fewer users there is definitely more of a need to entice us by making doing the daily quest more worth the time.
---
Thanks! How about SN1P-SN4P in Wild? When is it getting nerfed? This week? Next week? Or 3 years from now?
---
Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e or S6. They both run Hearthstone flawlessly.
---
nah same issue on my phone and other laptops unfortunately.
---
Enter ranked. Lose stars insta repeat? 😂
---
The only good thing to come out of this shitpost.
---
i am up for it. Still need?
---
I really wish we could unlock golden heroes in battlegrounds by defeating heroes in their respective solo adventures. Unlockable heros would be cool but I don't think people would like to see heroes locked behind paid solo adventures. Golden lich from frozen thorn, golden toki from witchwood, golden Nafarian from black rock mountain, you could even have some PVP wins by unlocking golden Jaraxxus by winning a match as him.

They only care about their auto-chess ripoff, sorry mate.
---
Do you really push both wild and standard? Don't make me laugh in emoji. You can try casual, but you know worse results.
---
This is idiotic, you do realize that right? 30%+ of the metagame, games decided by turn 3 not due to good play just simply due to a two card combo, but hey it's ok because only another month am I right?
---
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198300761248

/u/Chris_Attalus was hired to work on their auto-chess rip-off, they couldn't care less about Standard and even less about Wild.
---
Pre-order the next expansion please.
---
I'm glad there are a at least a few other sane people still playing this game...
---
Just leave it open and go make a cup of coffee.
---
I really had fun to play my Reno Dragon Nzoth Priest from back of the day to play in Wild, but probably need more than 1 game to finish the quest.
---
Jesus the nerds in this reddit are real toxic eh?
---
I went undefeated from 9 to 5 this month.  Gonna meme at rank floor for a bit now.
---
 You actually finish against aggro quite fast because of the control shell.  And the nzoth rogue is an autowin because they think they'll just outfatigue you.  Until you drop a "HERE COMES THE BOOM!"
---
Huh?
---
Its not a visual bug, I checked
---
Have you tried not playing mobile?
---
You do realize that's another month, right? Nearly 2 months, or half of this particular expansion cycle, ruined by a single card dominating over 30% of the metagame...
---
Yeah, 2 divine shield/poison amalgams will beat the entire board.
---
The poster at the head of this comment chain appears to have long since checked out, and anything I've said only applies to them in a hypothetical context anyway. Is there anyone else here who should feel disinclined to post based on my opinions regarding previously banned users with alt accounts?
---
By the looks of your responses they sure are. Anyways I told you how I deal with it when my friend list is empty, best of luck.
---
Not sure where it fits, just know it’s usually a good call to grab it early!
---
😂😂 wp
---
&gt; "Others" refer to people who go to someone else's profile to check their post history?
---
"Others" referring to people *other* than the person who made the rude post. Not "other than me". You seem to believe it's clever to imply that I do that as well. I'm not sure why, though. Of course I look into the post histories of people who act hostile. I just said it's normal to want to know more about those kinds of people. 
---
Though I suppose in some cases, the question on my mind is less "what is this person like," and more "doesn't this person sound a lot like that tool who made a big embarrassment of himself when he was banned last week?"
---
IMO you don't want to combine Annihilans anyways. They're big enough on their own to stand up and 1 bigger one dies to poison, whereas 3 large ones don't insta-die to poison.
---
Have you tried it yet? Really fun stuff imo, but to each their own.
---
totally agreed.
---
Yeah dude I'm mad that I've put in the time to win 950 games and I'm SO pissed that I'm close to achieving me goal. Are you actually retarded? lease explain how only one class having no favorable matchups isnt unbalanced? Are you daft? Who wouldn't be mad when they add a new 1000 win portrait and make it the hardest for the class you want specifically. Its hilarious that you take the smallest thing that matters in my post and talk about just that. Its almost like people have bad emotions when unreasonable and shitty things happen? Wow good job columbo you cracked this one wide open.
---
It's not bad, it's just various Shaman decks are some combination of cheaper, easier to pilot, and have a wider range of good matchups. It helps also that Hunter really only has one deck (albeit with several variants), whereas Shaman has at least two.

There are more pro players that I like and hope to see do well than there are places in the Grand Masters League, and there doesn’t seem to be another way to sustain as a professional player. I’d love to see GM expanded.

It's all about changing with the times.  Want 1000 wins? Play the class that wins at the moment.
---
I really like the tattoo and it helped my friend so I'm happy with it
---
Yeah, and this is pretty salt filled.
---
It's a good start relative to that Walking Fountain thing.
---
I got Challenge a Friend two days ago I think it was, so it isn’t just those quests for me. Maybe they changed around the odds for each quest? Either way I’m not complaining about more gold.
---

Hahahah imagine being so desperate that you scour someone's account just to bring up a single post from almost a year ago, ah that's right your that guy. You really think that these posts are even close to salty by hs standards? I didnt realize this was your first time on reddit sorry lol.
---
ye much with divine shields and co benefits the most from +1/+1 for the units and is the most consistent strat anyway. 
---
Beast has some very good units for it too early rat and hydra. So def. he should be quite good now.
---
Toki got hit hard between 1 and 2 it is massive for her but she was too powerful so we will.
---
All Hail Joe!
---
Do you.. do you think that the emotes were the only bug?
---
Am i the only one who thinks Soul of the murloc and hare are plain horrible when combined with stormbringer or evolve? Sure i can cheat out 2 mogus with evolve but droppin 9mana for 3 or sticking the board with soul only to highroll with stormbringer is so stupid.
---
A menagerie is a collection of different animals for exhibit.
---
You were shouting about how awful Warrior apparently (thirty percent winrare, no good match-ups) is and the travesty of it all despite all major tier list clearly showing the opposite. 
---
The salt levels were there, and unlike a lot of the other salt posters, you keep responding.
---
Woah dude. Give them some time. It only tool them 2 years sfter they released wuest cards to implement this. After all it's still a small indie company.
---
That's best case scenario if when you are let's say at 15 or so decide not do use it there which is risky because you could easily die there. So you'd not only have to save it, but perfectly survive with a little health for the scenario.
---
This is awesome, thank you.  
---
What is the last row under tavern 6 trying to teach me?  Are those sample strategies to build towards (one of the five groups shown?)
---
Brann seems OP with battlecry buffs
---
I don't think I'd seen this posted before, thought it was pretty cool/lucky to get a full golden board.
---
Also, golden Junkbot is seriously OP
---
If he indeed played two, it would have been a draw.
---
9 mana 7-14. Fair spell
---
I also would love that, but I also think if we could get new boards with them it would be perfect.
---
....search Kripp
---
This was a while ago. As in a month ago.
---
fun? what game are you talking about.
---
but nah it's up to them lol it's their loss. literally.
---
I was just thinking how that wouldn't have scares me at all. He could've had his entire board filled with good biggest pogo and still wouldn't have beat my tiny Murlocs board with divine shield and poison.
---
I like it anon, sure it's not a one to one copy of the art, but the idea of tattoos is that you get the artist's interpretation of your concept. I think the shading is really good and the colors scheme is real pretty.
---
Well, Brann would be, pretty fittingly, great with anyone gets an early Brann and builds around him.
---
The problem is that we don't exactly know how its calculated. At the same ranks I sometimes get 100+ pts for coming in first and 60-80 on other occasions. (\~4800pts)
---
the "randomness" is what makes things really frustrating.
---
Prepping the kielbasa.
---
that's been happening since before the patch
---
When is battlegrounds going live for the ones who dont have early access ?
---
Ready button on the to-do list?
---
Not sure if this applies to all secrets, but this seems like important info for anyone wanting to play this hero.
---
What's wrong with that, though?
---
This will be harder to complete than play 100 murlocs.
---
Poisonous is a key part of the game. If they remove it Murlocs will suffer
---
Yup exactly, those are roughly the boards that will usually hit 1st place, most of the cards don't have to be exact but the goal is to keep the synergy. (Demons and Murlocs don't hit 1st as often as the others)
---
I take it it's too difficult to implement a feature that would allow you to view everybody's last board state they went into battle with? That's why you're looking to add information such as minion types?  
---
  
---
Would be good then to also add how many cleave minions and passive buffing minions they have (junkbot,  mama bear, that sort of thing)
---
Good thing he didn't Hong Kong.
---
By OP's calculation, slightly lower than that.
---
I play in NA as I'm in Oceania
---
the problem with HOTS quests was that you couldn't reroll them. I dont know if they changed it
---
Same here
---
Toki is still good in the late game because the last minion is always tier 6 if your tavern is tier 5 or 6. That makes it easier to get golden tier 6 minions. She'll be above average but not top 5. Mukla might be top 5 but I think theres too much competition with manastorm, nefarian, and curator all being so strong. Mukla will likely dominate mid game but I'm not sure he'll be great for winning games
---
Who are you, playing the actual game instead of the new thing that's designed to draw in players to the cash shop?
---
Been having a great time with Battlegrounds.
---
It seems that the only viable options are Mech or Beast though.
---
I am wholly in favor of unnerfed Yogg
---
Yes. Encourages you to play the game for sake of playing the game not for sake of doing quests. Now you don't even need to see what quest you have. Get 3 full slots of quests and then queue with Whizbang. Your quests will be completed while you are having fun.
---
Will these balance patches ever change a minion so that it has different stat than the one in normal game mode?
---
read the patch notes please
---
 Musicat#2900 Eu want to trade 80g quest. I will show, you go first.

I was a HUGE fan of mid-range hunter back in its prime. Definitely will look into that again :)

I like how at final 3 you're still at 30, and the other 2 are at 5 or so.

Injured blademaster and argent commander
---
You still pay 3 mana for Elise's map, right?
---
It's probably the smart option, but i really don't enjoy playing against the wild decks. I feel like I'll be outmatched way more than i would in standard

Whoops, my b. I'll edit.

Hey guys!! I punished the most hated deck in the game with the deck that **SHOULD BE**  the most hated deck in the game!!
---
Also you must have a phone.

Can you, please, update here it is available on pc? Thanks! I am at work at the moment.
---
Only quests I outright think are bad are friend games

Besides that all quests are fine

---
Just as there is a sizeable group of people who believe that global warming is a farce or overstated in spite of the ample evidence for it, so too are many vocal people unconvinced that the MMR system needs any work.
---
It's important to correct those views so that everyone may live happier lives before it's too late to fix anything.
---
Brann will be a new hero and he has a card already so why not
---
Many versions of aggro mage ran a murloc package and were tier 1 for some time with both Coldlight and Warleader.
---
And as far as mill decks are concerned i'm only talking about standard, wild doesnt really count.
---
And i feel like all the decks you mentioned plus the mage decks are quite a large sample of decks.
---
Focus on amalgams, war leaders and the health buff Murlocs until tavern 4/5 the start adding the other stuff.  That way you can use other strong buffs on the amalgams.
---
I agree that murlocs need late game help, but poisonous should stay in in the mode. It's really the only consistent way to deal with the absurd health numbers you can give demons and pogos.
---
The luck of the draw affects everyone the same way. This can be   reason/excuse to lose a specific match, but not a reason/excuse to not climb out of rank 14 after 20-30 games.
---
If you cant climb trough rank 14 with a tier 1 deck, it simply means the other players are playing it better than you. If you want to improve your plays and be able to climb, you will have to learn to play the deck better. And reaching the lategame means you fucked up. It will happen, not everyone is perfect and not everyone is expected to win 100% of the time, but the problem is not that you dont have plays in the lategame, is probably that you arent playing the deck correctly and therefore reaching it more times than you should. If its already turn 8 you lost 99% of the time.
---
Nasty animals, man. Can't keep track of what they're doing all the time. I often wake up and it just decides "ey you know what, I wanna imitate a stick this morning". I'm telling ya, they're weird creatures
---
Yes
---
My guess is that the chance of getting a drop resets each time. I mean, you’re watching for several hours a day right. So I think the chance of getting a key resets when I leave the stream. So i reckon it’s probs better to leave one stream or more running for an extended period of time (overnight for example) to have a better chance of getting a key.
---
Does the combo work better on PC because echo + magnet is slooooooowwwwwwwwwwww on mobile, very hard to get lethal.
---
He's talking about Heores of the Storm.
---
I was doing something else and was playing idly on my phone and it was easier to just queue and experiment with what counted and what didn't rather than actually play.
---
LSF is caught up on some streamer house drama right now. They don't have time for content creators
---
That's not true at all, least of all for a free game mode on an already popular 'free' game. Contrary to popular belief, online games/modes existed and were perfectly popular before streamers were even a thing. And for that matter virtually every game with an mmr system has people whining about how "bad" it is, usually just because they dont understand what its supposed to do to begin with or accept that they're not as good as they thing they are.
---
So no, its not an important issue, nor does the games popularity depend on it. If anything despite the existence of ranks, the mode is way more *casual* than the main hs modes. What the popularity does depend on is balance and content updates, and frankly so far i'm not impressed in the least, with a tiny inconsequential patch after a closed beta and a promise of more in *a month*.. When currently thee's a tiny amount of content and half of what's there is unbalanced to the point of unplayability..
---
Mechs are more than slightly stronger than beasts. There are more synergies and better synergies, plus magnetic.
---
I agree! It was awful trying to grind with that one class you don't play just for the reward. Much better design now.
---
You can play the new mode, but 3 features are locked behind a paywall of sorts. You need to buy 10 packs of the new expansion to unlock advanced stats (not out yet), 20 total packs to unlock the choice of 3 heroes to start the game with (rather than 2), and 30 total packs to unlock emotes.
---
Until the stats come out, I'm not sure how useful they will be. The emotes are purely fluff. Having the choice of a 3rd hero can be kind of big, though.
---
&gt; This is probably the dumbest note for something like this, but I always saw Reno bringing you back to full health as sort of being like how the dashing hero in old adventure serials always manages to somehow still be alive well after the villain was sure they were dead.
---
Man, this is actually a really cool idea. I'd never thought of the Battlecry in that way, but it makes a lot of sense.
---
Battlegrounds is already super basic and limited. I think it is an interesting mechanic that adds (little) complexity.
---
Battlegrounds are part of HS so any change to BG is a change to HS.
---
Just curious, where did you hear that? Thanks.
---
Can you even get a minion with charge?
---
It also fixes the quest reroll, at least on PC.
---
Recently a handful of wild cards were reintroduced back into standard for a limited time (until the next expac I believe) to shake up the meta. Everyone was given copies of these cards to use during the event (so everyone can join in) which will disappear afterwards.
---
Or go face in the absence of taunts. Haha
---
Yeah lets all fake positivity for this ugly ass tattoo.
---
What's frustrating is how long players (like me) were screaming for this change, because it would so obviously be more fun.
---
I've seen this request for YEARS, and they finally make it, and the only reason they're making so many proactive changes is because players are leaving.
---
Without N'Zoth, there really won't be enough resurrection tools to take the deck beyond being a greedy deck to combat hard control. Decks like Murloc Shaman will simply be too fast for it handle. Plus, playing the Priest minions you get off of Invoke greatly conflicts with how resurrection decks have pretty much always handled themselves. 
---
Sure, I guess you could start playing them  after you've dropped both Mass Resurrections, but that just means a lot of your hand will be junk during most of the game.
---
Priest already has spot removal in the form of the Shadow Words and Forbidden Word. They're conditional, yes, but an Assassinate for Priest really is not going to be game breaking nor will it by itself make the deck.
---
A Galakrond Control Priest may play Zilliax and Khartut Defender (Granted, what control deck wouldn't), but I'm not convinced on it playing Convincing Infiltrator nor Mass Resurrection or whatever other resurrection tools DoD may bring. Plus, if you want to consistently Invoke Galakrond four times in a fairly timely manner, you'll need to play around eight but at least six Invoking effects.
---
From the look of it, each EVIL class is only going to get two Invoking cards each, so you'll also have to play the 4/5 with Taunt.
---
Zalae does pull ups on screen so i am assuming he put him self in a position to flash the camera by swinging his knees up.

It’s the same in Overwatch. If you sucked at the beginning it’s almost impossible to rank up
---
"I broadcast moving images of myself for a living, am often laying down because of an injury, but choose not to wear underwear." It's probably true, but it is so incredibly stupid it's unbelievable.

Murlocs. Divine shield. Poisonous.
---
Ol murc eye, the legendary Murloc.
---
The main weakness of Dreadsteed is that it’s an awful card to play... once you can duplicate it or get it for free however, it’s super fun.
---
Heya /u/EresArslan!
---
Thanks for the report. Those things definitely need fixing and we'll make sure the translations will be corrected with the first possible patch to the game.
---
For future reports like this, you can also use the [official French localization forum](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/fr/hearthstone/c/traduction-localisation) where members of our localization team will have an easier time finding and replying to them
---
Thank you again for your help!
---
It is actually *actually* pay to win. You get to pick out of 3 hero options instead of the normal 2 if you don't pre-obtain 20 pack for the new expansion. Every edge counts if you are playing the odds of an rng fest like this.
---
Given the effect the set Modern Horizons had on MtG's Modern format (a few of the new cards in it were or are looking like decent targets for bans for warping stuff too much), that really might not be a good thing.
---
What is his buff exactly? Hero power costs 2 now instead of 3?
---
It’s simple

Ho-ly Shit! This is absolutely amazing. The flavour is absolutely busting, so many great puns (and I´m sure half of them went over my head) with cards fitting their flavour and doing something interesting! I cannot put into words how beautiful this is, and how much I would like to play with this! I think I´m most impressed by the creativity of Nat´Khol, but everything was so great! A few cards which I think would need a nerf, but other people already commented on that better than I could. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So a big WOW to you and everyone who worked on this, you guys are absolutely amazing!
---
yea
---
The fact that if you get it early game, it only costs one gold instead of two gold, since you can sell back both tokens.
---
How do you know that? I don't see that mentioned in the post.
---
Also what would his hero power be since Shudderwok already has the double battlecry.
---
You're not missing anything. It is exactly how MMR system should work. It's just most people prefer flashing numbers next to their name, and instand and constant gratification instead of a system that actually measures their skill. It comes from the assumption that your skill gets better after playing few games while the truth is you have to play thousands of games to improve.
---
Yeah pretty sure
---
You can sell the token on the 5 gold turn for an extra buy.
---
It also trades favorably to most things on the 1 star slot, bringing a draw most of the time.
---
4 heroes in another patch next week, new units along with descent of dragons xpac in December, wouldn’t surprise me if they introduce dragon tribe then since It thematically fits
---
This is the advice. I once got really frustrated that I couldn't climb any higher with Odd Paladin only to realize my stupid face wasn't going face enough.
---
Face is always the place.
---
I'm in the same boat. Even coming to this sub, I have to sift through way too many posts about BG before I can find anything Hearthstone related.
---
This new game mode was not made for me and that is a bummer, but I'm glad some people are having fun with it, I guess.
---
why are people downvoting you? youre right.
---
He's often wearing workout clothing and stepping away from playing to do push-ups and chin-ups; sometimes making it part of the stream, like for every subscription he'll do 10 chin-ups. I imaging the workout clothing was part of the issue.
---
Don't encourage them, with how the current world works they might actually win some elections.
---
How were battlecries buffed?
---
Yup, I havent been happy with many HS changes over the years but this is a 1000% improvement. Even makes me feel less bad about recommending the game to new players because I know they will actually be able to do their quests as opposed to just slamming into a wall of better cards/players and getting discouraged.
---
What do you define as "fun?"
---
More accurately its /ZalaeHS, no more TwitchTV at the beginning :v
---
How were you planning on doing Dragons in BG?
---
Lets be real though. Even F2P players will be able to open 20 packs fairly quickly with saved gold and launch quests.
---
With 2-3 variations per class if they added even 8 more would be a huge
---
If you like the control archetype and having to adjust your strategy based on the matchup I'd say Renolock is very much (albeit expensive).
---
Not to mention players using exploits to abuse sniplock plays per turn. Some of these players have been on the wild leaderboards for weeks. Can we at least get some bans? I stopped even trying to climb in legend because I kept running into the same cheating players over and over again.
---
It doesn't calculate the MMR of other players when it gives you points. It's not messed up.
---
Genius
---
maskrey#1181 trade quest NA, you go first plz.
---
Or just myra
---
Do you know how long it took us to get 18 up from the original 9 slots? Blizzard thinks too many deck slots will confuse players. 
---
Don’t anger the small Indy company. They may take away deck slots. Be happy with 18!
---
Out of curiosity since I see so much fuss about this .. why do people care about a 4 digit number? Does it win you anything? Unlock bonuses, cosmetic or otherwise?
---
Is anyone actually impressed looking at leaderboards?
---
The gamemode is very new for now. I'm pretty sure even the people in the top 200 are still climbing up pretty rapidly, so it's not really worth it to analyze the ranking yet.
---
Since the rankings are similar to elo ratings, we might be able to compare it to the chess leaderboards.
---
In chess people usually start at 1200 and the biggest group of people is between 1600-1700 (the base rating multiplied by ~1.4). If that is something to go by then the biggest group of people here will be around 5600 rating.
---
Anything above 2.2k is in the top 2percent of players in chess (a multiplier of 1.83) in battlegrounds this would be around 7.3k.
---
The highest rating achieved in chess was around 2.7k (1.2k multiplied by 2.25) This would mean that the highest possible rankings in battlegrounds are around 9k.
---
Should idealy be having 9 slots  one of each of classes and then when click on it you get slots with all decks for that class.
---
Nobody ever plays that card, so in this case it is
---
As of writing, the US hasn't gotten the update yet or even a whisper about it. I read somewhere that something should happen around 6pm GMT (about an hour from now), but nothing official.
---
Too mutch for that little murloc
---
I build meme decks when I want to have fun, right now I'm doing a howlfiend treachery deck that has a surprising 60% win rate at rank 4. Unfortunately it pretty much auto loses to secret mage but it's surprisingly strong. It's Homebrew, so if you like meme dreams as much as me I can post it tonight after work
---
Apologies if you're trying to say something other than you aren't sure whats going on in the photo. But he used Demonic project which transforms a minion in both players hand into a random demon. And it hit both their and their opponent's N'Zoth.
---
Man, that's a low bar of music taste then. I listen to Beethoven's 9th simphony and Mozart when I make love to my girl. Listen to some actual music guys, not the new crap these days. I can't believe I was born in this generation honestly no one has a taste in music. big yikes.
---
closest thing is mage tower skin for assasination rogue's artifact.(same look/model as in artwork just more transparant).
---
which is sadly no longer obtainble if dint get it in legion.
---
It's more a matter of the leaderboards being completely pointless if the only games that matter are your first 50 games.  Might as well not have a leaderboard at all.

BBrode to his friends:
---
"Guys I got an idea about a rap song and I need your help. It's gonna be a bit cheesy though."
---
I've never had mustard on it, but I'm willing to try. The big offense here was his soup choice! It should always be tomato soup with grilled cheese.
---
riiiight. thanks for explaining buddy :-)
---
I kind of wonder if Lightfang should go up to t6.  If you hit Lightfang early with a t4 golden you can just hard switch into menagerie and the stats are insane.
---
Ben Brode left himself. He was practically face of the Hearthstone, Blizzard was probably asking him to stay. Why did he leave exactly would be a better question.
---
What?!
---
Upboats to the left, gentlesirs
---
Mike Donais made a post here yesterday confirming 10 AM PT, so yes an hour from now.
---
This is the second-best rap song about grilled cheese that I've ever heard.
---
Nah accidentally flashing dick is relatively minor in the grand scale of things.
---
Why are u even here, go make some love to your imaginary Mozart loving girl
---
Reminds me of ProZd(?)'s video about card game turns
---
Shout out to Tillamook Cheese. That's fuckin' right, Black Bricks All Day Every Way.
---
Likely
---
All we need is a way in game to store deck codes. It's very tedious when you're playing Hearthstone on multiple devices to have to track where you stored each deck code and it has happened to me on several occasions that I've lost a deck code.
---
If you have to put mustard on your grilled cheese, which Imo don't, at least for love of god don't use yellow mustard.
---
You also need to butter both sides, toast a side, flip it, then cheese it.  Once the sandwich is assembled with both untoasted sides facing out, then **you must put a weight on it or press down with a spatula.**. That's not optional, that's literally the most important part.
---
Probably cubelock. Super interesting control deck with lots of different combos
---
Will it? Maybe.. Soon? Probably not.
---
 A  grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread  with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of "melts".  Almost every "grilled cheese" sandwich i see on here has other items  added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called "grilledcheese" is  nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have  nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches  that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's  called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some  pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd  call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to  wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you  had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more  than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a  mix of different cheeses  or use sourdough or french bread. But if you  want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own  subreddit entitled "melts" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese.  I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert.  But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate  person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you  foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating  your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it  rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3  years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've  seen post after post of peoples "grilled cheeses" all over reddit and  it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this  morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just  because I know this one exists now.
---
You  god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into  whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt  sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.
---
I sense sarcasm, I have 22 wins and he haven’t popped up like that since tutorial.. Bob hates me:’(

---
If you take multiple turns via Time Warp, it's still more-or-less an OTK, even if *technically* it was more than one turn. The essence of it (a combo that your opponent cannot stop because it goes off before their turn) remains the same.
---
"Your skill" is a bit of a nebulous concept, that people might interpret differently, but its often a measure of your overall ranking against other people. 
---
Its true you're playing against yourself in golf, so lets talk about a game against other people, chess. When someone asks how skilled you are in chess, whats the normal response? Generally either some adjective ("I'm decent/not that good/ etc...") or an elo. Its absolutely valid to use MMR (which roughly equates to elo in chess) as a measure of skill. 
---
Skill is often tied inextricably to the level of those around you. For example, what would you consider your skill in math/music/ etc...? If in 2nd grade, you knew up to 4th grade math I'd consider you to be skilled at math. If then by 12th grade, you knew up to 6th grade math, I would no longer consider you to be skilled at math, even though you've improved.  Its nice knowing your rate of improvement is faster than the average.  
---
"What I don't get is why anyone would care that no one had a higher number than them." So do you not get the point of tournaments if they don't provide a prize? Like to you are all math competitions/ science quiz bowls/ low level chess tournaments/ etc.. all meaningless because you don't get anything but bragging rights? You don't ever feel a sense of pride for winning vs other people? Like you have to get a prize or it was worthless?
---
nice!
---
I didn't get a drop on streams so now's finally my time!!
---
Yup I agree, Zapp isn't always good but when he is it can save games, I already have Kangor and sneed's beside each other, you mean make them as late game? and yup I agree with wrath weaver &amp; psych-o-tron. 
---
What do you keep over the sky golem?
---
Can we see a picture of the tattoo you covered up?
---
I'm in this boat too. There's been a lot of great experiments after he left. It's hard to say if that's because of the new leadership or if he would have made the changes had he been around this late into the games life cycle, but the fact remains that he didn't make any of the changes.
---
It’s not hearthstone related content, so it breaks the rules of the sub. That’s who cares.
---
About fucking time Blizzard
---
Great, time to stomp some noobs :P
---
All I can think is -- man, that's a nice gas range in Brode's kitchen!!
---
he said please
---
Yeah I'm in the middle of my first Battleground right now on an iPhone 6 and after the 4th combat or so I'm lagging so bad I have 0 time and it just jumps to the next combat. Super disappointing but I can't say they didn't warn me with the system requirements :(
---
Bartendotron tier A is just the pinnacle of a pretty bad list here, sorry bud... that hero has to be trash tier, it gives you like 1 round advantage and a max of 5 gold advantage at the cost of having basically no effect on your fights
---
????????
---
I am netdecking grilled cheese now smh
---
Only if the toki player was insanely lucky.
---
That should be a sub
---
than*
---
Yeah I have mixed feeling about that. On one hand it sucks it's unplayable on my mobile but on the other hand  I'm glad they are adding content even if it doesn't work on all mobiles I think that bodes well for possible future changes to the collection manager and such like on desktop only...
---
But yeah, shame we can't just remove animations on mobile or have simpler animations on mobile :(
---
On top of that, it makes all offerings potentially stronger because of the option to buff it. Rats at 2/2 might be okay but not great, but free upgrade to 3/3? Pretty good stats early on for 3 gold.
---
Uhm... No? Toki removes a ton of RNG by assuring you see a higher tier unit on your board every turn. This is incredibly valuable and I would say the other player would need above average rng to beat an average toki.
---
In my experience so far, if you or your opponent concede too early, it wont count toward the quest.
---
just give me tournament mode-notice how all of the concerns for tournament mode such as not knowing how to implement it didn't seem to occur for battlegrounds? just pathetic and morally bankrupt by the hs team
---
Almost every site right now. Hearthstone Top Decks, for example:  [https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/hearthstone-battlegrounds-heroes-tier-list-guides/](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/hearthstone-battlegrounds-heroes-tier-list-guides/)
---
How do you turn off the bartender. For Christ sake.
---
what paywall? when the games mode goes live you can buy the packs for gold..
---
Wow, having him gold makes all the 6/6's he summons golden as well. Such a good card to have golden lol
---
its unlocked for people who have preordered
---
Did they shrink the pool size on certain cards? Seems every game since yesterday has been a struggle to get good drops
---
Mulligan for perfect hand.
---
Play things on curve.
---
Face = the place.
---
(Also being able to predict what your opponent is likely to do on the next couple turns helps, but with murloc shaman that will only rarely affect your plays. It is your opponent's job to respond to you in most matchups.)
---
Always been like that. You can't just concede for the 80g quest either
---
Weird, playing on my Galaxy S8 and had no issues on my first run through. Even got first place which was nice!
---
Yes this is due too Anmations being to long i made a post about it take a look. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvdkn9/slow_animations_on_mobile_no_time_at_bob/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

The good ol' 41 upstart goblin deck
---
Runs fine on my phone. Xiaomi Pocophone F1, if that's important.  Bit awkward a few times, especially when you're short on time and rushing, but very playable IMO.
---
league as a game doesn't use much but that god awful client on the other hand...
---
Deine Autokorrektur hat wohl zugeschlagen ;)

I feel you man

It's all a clever ruse!

Watch Kripparian on YouTube
---
The design itself just doesn’t make sense either, or simply a bad design. 2 flowers placed in the most random locations and then an oddly shaped big solid black background in the middle. I think filling that black space with more flowers would have done a lot for this tattoo or at the very least, fade the black into his natural skin tone.
---
Bad players always complain about rolling bad dice, drawing the wrong cards etc and call the game luck based.
---
Nothing to see here move along.
---
Yeah, Ben Brode is a Classic, he wouldnt just leave Standard without being HoFed. Too dominant in the meta.
---
ye let people trash talk 5 free gold in the early turns which makes turns way more smooth. It is also in my top 5 win rate heroes (top 20 eu).
---
It is just not as flashy so people don't like it and they don't take advantage enough off the ramp. If you can manage to get a tier higher one turn faster all the good units are still in the pool. (ofc not every game possible)
---
I also like playing LichB quite a bit even tho I have a bit weaker results with it but getting the strong start and than hitting early Jaraxxus and get the coin every turn is quite fun.
---
The rest of the game - excluding arena - depends on which cards you have in your collection. Here it's just a matter of what comes up for you in rotation.
---
Once you pay the Arena entry fee you're on a level playing field.  
---
Once you have some competitive decks in Constructed you're on a level playing field.    
---
There's no advantage for paying in the Tavern Brawl.  
---
3 heroes vs 2 on the other hand is like getting an extra card in the mulligan if you preorder. It's an unfair advantage for people that pay.
---
I can finally make risky plays without listenIng to what my opponent has to say about it again!!
---
Honestly i don't see the meaningfulness of picking 1 extra hero. you can only play 1 anyway.
---
Yes i understand that you could get a better one, but honestly, just play it and chill out.
---
You'll have wild swings in MMR your first 50-100 games. It's trying to determine where your real play level is at. 
---
The more games you play, the less swings in points you'll have.
---
we get a cool new game mode, completely for free, playing against a ton of other f2p players and people still find reasons to bitch.
---
Amazing
---
He looks so happy... glad he followed his passion
---
Ok thanks!
---
I can't read so fuck blizzard. ok bruh
---
And people who paid who get to choose from a 3rd hero. I'm not bitching about and it's still fun but it's still puts F2P at slight disadvantage.
---
Concede = lost in last place, so yeah that's entirely normal.
---
Alright, thanks. I was just wondering because it seemed like so many points, though I already got them back by playing
---
Google it. I used it correctly.
---
[removed]
---
I'll admit it, I was wrong. This is fun. Got a few wins and only failed to get Top 4 once so far (got too greedy, still learning lol)
---
Yeah, I can’t imagine playing it on mobile. I’m on an old-ish laptop and I can barely finish my turns sometimes. 
---
It animations can’t be sped up at all (especially stuff like poisonous), I really think they should extend the turn timer a bit *but* change it so that if everyone hits a new ‘End Turn’ button it’ll go automatically into the combat phase. That may slow the game down a bit during crucial turns but it’d also speed up the game in many cases, especially in the beginning of the game. I’m usually sitting around waiting for 20 seconds+ during the first 3-4 turns anyways, even on my slow computer. 
---
I’m not sure if I’m alone with this, but has anyone else experienced lag otherwise during the shop phase? Like sometimes it takes a good couple of seconds to drag stuff to my hand/to my board, which really messes with my turns on occasion. This game could just be a related issue, but it’s just another reason to add an end turn button.
---
Yeah. I really wanted to like Murlocs, but they will let you down 99 out of 100 games. It’s fine to splash them into a Frankenstein comp, but full Murloc? Never again until they gain more tribe members. Far too unreliable.
---
On my iPad 4 gen (1 GB RAM) Battlegrounds are essentially unplayable. At the late turns all the animations and lag take so much time that I consistently have 0 seconds at Bob's tavern
---
I had a somewhat funny episode btw. I was playing mechs with Millicenta Manastorm and was highrolling pretty hard. The last three battles showed me in the left bar that all the opponents are dead (because the game already ended several minutes ago and all my opponents lost and already disconnected from the server). So I just watched a movie of three consecutive battles with 0 secs at the tavern, knowing that I already won them all. Tells something about the power level of Millicenta and mechs btw :)
---
I noticed that too and posted about it in the Bug Report forum.
---
No hero has a custom looking hero power.
---
I know. I said it really looks anti climatic with this portrait.
---
Maybe they could have started a new subreddit called "grilledcheese-plus" or do a megapost each week where people submit there creations.  I understand where both sides are coming from and it does suck to see the life sucked out of a sub by one comment.  To be fair, he did have a point from what I read.  It was just at the cost of creativity and community.
---
Demons can get REALLY big, but the problem is the are so inconsistent. Game starts off feeding you basically nothing but demons to tempt you and then you never see them again lol.
---
[deleted]
---
Why are you so negative? A majority of your comment history is just negative garbage. 
---
All I was doing was qualifying myself, and my opinion, to whatever degree it may help. 
---
Obviously people will disagree with it, but for me it's a true statement. 
---
All you're here doing is spewing negativity and not contributing to any meaningful conversation. 
---
Do us a favor and fuck off.
---
this mode is fun to watch and i'm assuming play on pc, but its virtually impossible to play on a phone. The latency, odd positioning of characters, i've dragged them to turn them in for coins and they pop back in my hand. my last round i had 32 seconds and 9 gold to spend, due to battle cries, and input lag i played a battle cry from hand, bought one, sold one played 2nd battle cry and ran out of time w/ 5 gold left (i rolled once). i was first going into the last few rounds but its really not playable on a phone. Galaxy note 4 3gig ram. Old but used to run HS fine. also plays games that are more taxing w/o issues.
---
Pretty constant animation lagging but no disconnect so far...
---
Is he back to hearthstone?
---
I’m now curious as to how my iPhone SE runs the game, considering that it has an IPhone 6 processor with 2 GB of ram. I suppose it may run it a bit better than standard 6s do, but its small screen (and mine is kinda janky) is dissuading me from even trying. 
---
I suppose I can just give it a shot on the Asian server just to test it out.
---
It took me some time to understand it as I started playing aggro decks, but there should not be late game as Murloc Shaman. Like, at all.  I'm currently laddering with this deck and in the vast majority of the games I win I have lethal by turn 6, sometimes by turn 4. Although there are some limited comeback options with Underbelly Angler and Murloc Tastyfin, it's better to just kill them fast and only trade if you absolutely must. 
---
I absolutely second the advise to watch streamers because you may learn some useful tricks from them, such as the Soul of Murloc + Murloc Tidecaller that allows you to create a giant minion if the face plays taunt :)
---
Lmao, what a damn rat
---
Nope, I played the minion like a couple seconds before the start of the battle and it glitches and thought u didn’t have a minion at all.
---
Good luck, I've played nothing but Evolve/Murloc Shaman, Nzoth Rogue and OTK paladin in the past 2 days.
---
It’s not even like removing/simplifying animations for mobile users would give them an advantage, since everyone has to abide by the same turn timer anyways. If anything, it’d just mean that they’d have to sit around waiting more.
---
All I the more reason to add a collective ‘End Turn’ button (and maybe extend the turn timer a bit) and/or add an option to remove/simplify animations.
---

Actually, literally everything he uses to make grilled cheese is what I use to make grilled cheese. I feel validated in my ingredients.
---
Also weird to think about Brode shopping in the same grocery store as me. He's a celebrity, I'm just a lowly pleb. Yet he buys the same stuff!
---
personally my favorite part of hearthstone is the single player adventure style content, so I would definitely recommend you get one and check it out and see if you like that mode. they typically dont come with great rewards for the money but i get hours of fun play out of them
---
best way to farm gold is being vigilant about completing quests. once you get some skill and can win 4+ games in arena on a regular basis, its a good way to get packs, gold, and dust.
---
Face has taunt
---
It's a computer controlled opponent so you actually have someone to fight in the next round.
---
I play on mobile and my internet is fine. I don’t have lag issues. My guess would be that unless the whole of Hearthstone is doing this to you that it’s probably because it’s still in beta phase.
---
you weren't supposed to tell
---
Itsa i play arena more than ranked situation
---
What about the Animations being to long for battlegrounds Mobile us mobile players need a fix for this we are geting little to no time at bobs tavern please help. https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvdkn9/slow_animations_on_mobile_no_time_at_bob/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Tango#1367 NA Trading 80g Quest. I'll show you go first.
---
I keep either getting in the top 4 or in second place. I was so excited when the RNG rolled in my favor.
---
Yeah I've seen so many videos of krip playing this that I could've sworn I've had it a week now.
---
Well good luck to you!
---
Stupid question but I'm new to AutoChess:
---
My understanding was that minions attack L-R (hence positioning being important).
---
On a few occasions, I've had my opponents second (or sometimes first) minion swing for my far right minion, completely fucking me up.
---
Am I missing something? Are higher-tiered minions more of a priority attack wise than where they're placed?
---
Deryl's probably my favorite hero now. The playstyle is really unintuitive but surprisingly consistent. It's so satisfying to imagine your opponents asking themselves how Deryl is stronger than A F Kay on Turn 4. 
---
The strategy is to get as many things on the board as possible before turn 4, then buy everything EXCEPT the stuff you want, then sell your entire hand and board to put a billion hats on a couple of premium minions.
---
Good video but I'm a little disappointed he didn't hang dong.
---
If there is only 3 players left, one person will be without an opponent. So you are not meeting a real person, rather the computer using the board of a person who is dead.
---
Patchwerk is my bae
---
3 players left. 2 face each other and one a dead guy, a player that has lost before and thats why he has 0 health.
---
I find demons really stronger than beasts lol, except they do have mama bear. Then it's rape.

I think you mean the Animations being to long so people cant play properly far to meny interactions the game frezes and cant keep up no time at bobs tavern here take a look https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvdkn9/slow_animations_on_mobile_no_time_at_bob/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Pretty un-fun on mobile (android), constantly rushing the recruit turns due to lag and the interface (having to tap your hand to maximise it). A few times my tap has not registered on my hand resulting in not having time to play a purchased minion. My last game crashed during combat (before any attacks).

Will try again after a few patches...more stress than fun currently as a mobile player.

Same here! Felt so good to finally win one!
