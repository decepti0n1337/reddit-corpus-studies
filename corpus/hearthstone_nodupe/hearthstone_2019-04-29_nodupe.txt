Babbling book is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at one mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a spell to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 1/1 can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---

---
But more than the BB is just so positive. It comes on the board like "do you want to cast a spell?" and I'm like "yeah BB i do want to cast a spell let's do this shit" and when he attacks he's like "SPELLS ARE FUN" and I'm like "yeah they are SO FUN." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "nah spells are fun." And it looks so happy. I mean this is an inanimate object literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. I mean look at his face he's just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when babbling book is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card
---
---
---
Then he is using warpath and 4-6-8 mana just to clear some minions. I guess its worth.
---
Why should it be faster in Wild than in Standard? Just because you can play op decks doenst mean your winrate is better, since your opponent play op decks as well!
---
You can play a deck which hard counters warrior. So, it's not invincible. But you can't out-strategy it and make it a good matchup for aggro.
---
If you play a deck which warrior inherently beats you are pretty well fucked and you need them to draw badly.
---
People will tell you not to play into brawl, but between brawl and all the other board clears, there is just no way to play around everything while still playing fast enough to win.
---
Take risks, play around the cards you can beat, assume they don't have the stuff you can't beat. That's how you win unfavorables.
---
If you wanna beat warrior regularly play a different deck.
---
Even if i dont over exetend, there are still more, there is warpath, there is "light defuses" dr boom that gives rush.
---
Must be some kind of glitch bc I never got any of these friends
---
I tried soul of murloc for so long, because of warpath, it just dosent work....
---
4 of the Tier 2 decks are control decks. 
---
And really, not a single aggro deck right now feels truly oppressive or incredibly hard to deal with. There’s plenty of techs available for them. 
---
Learn to your read your pocket meta, and tech your decks accordingly.

Dank.
---
Sometimes playing against druid you get either witching hour or predatory instincts off a thief card, and the beast tag on blink fox keeps them from being dead cards.
---
Definitely go with Khadgar right now. Both decks are very RNG dependent, and while shaman is super fun, Conjurer’s mage has more oomph in this meta.

The reason rafaam has a low winrate is because it's a play from behind card, and a card that gives you a chance against decks you will probably lose 90% to.

Want to know about this too.

Please. Pleaseeeee. Pretty please with a cake and milkshake.

I get big shaman can be frustrating when Hagatha is played on curve and can sometimes provides an answer to everything. But the deck is far from reliable.

Funny how my eyes read "divorceable", I guess that just shows how you don't actually read the whole word but kind of figure out what letters there are?

Thaurissan just feels really good in any situation, as long as you have a hand. He demands removal, and even one tick of his effect can enable some crazy shenanigans.

I get where’s come from, but i believe it’s not hard for them to remove some cards from the generation pool. It really give me a sinking feeling when one card decides my opponent wins the game and I’m not lucky enough or can’t generate that card
---
the moment we realize he had a damn hex from deck to the very end. The guy is rngmancer, manages ir like no one
---
...ly fun!
---
right? such a rude misplay. An easy middle of the line tactic would have played around everything
---
Maybe, and even then it's still dust he can use for Gold cards or future expansions. But I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't have a 100% complete collection. The thought is what counts either way.
---
Good to hear. Red blob is my favorite superhero

according to hsreplay  duskfallen aviana is in 0.01% of decks along with forest guide and festeroot hulk.

This is incredible, really amazing artwork, and an incredible card to draw as well.

thanks for your insight basically grind the game till you see certain patterns and pick up certain play styles to vs match ups
---
you talking about bomb warrior?
---
(surprised pikachu)
---
Oh hai there blizzard
---
Oof, taking out a coldlight? Coldlight is core, wouldn't consider taking that out. Coldlight is *very* worth it to drop on curve to buff even just 1 murloc. I find it odd you'd take him out while you make it sound like you over-value the effect by only playing him when you can buff 3 or more murlocs. 
---
 If you want to take a card out to replace with cult master, I'd probably take out 1 zap.
---
Nope. Meta is still evolving, many archetypes are being countered, there is no stagnation yet. If you want something fresh, play Arena.
---
Nerfing rogue gonna be difficult imo. Because it's so many little elements that make it that strong all together, not just 1 or 2 things like warrior and his hero card.  Nerf half of the basic set pretty much 😂
---
Ooh free packs
---
Most people think Priest of the Feast is Ostkaka, Chittling Tunneler is Pavel, and Phantom Militia is Tom.
---
Just to add to this I healed up with the flash heal in my hand and the Lightwell I drew the next turn, which was a 5/5 because I had played a 1 mana Lady in White a few turns back.

I think I played you today as Kadgar mage and tempo rogue in two consecutive games. You were murloc shaman in both matches. This is a tiny tiny world.
---
You could try maybe buying him a hearthstone item from the blizzard shop. Maybe a cup or shirt or something. 
---
Also maybe have a night out of dinner and home alone together. 
---
Maybe you can try to let him stream hearthstone a few hours a day. He can make some money if he creates video content and plays average or higher skill level. 
---
I know that a baby can be a very draining experience emotionally mentally and physically. 
---
Maybe try to communicate and work a way to have a good friendship schedule so you both don't get too overwhelmed. 
---
Also maybe ask your mother or your boy friends mother or sister for advice. 
---
Your boyfriend has a passion for hearthstone. If you feel obligated to support him you can just remember he has to also support you and the baby. Give and receive share equally. 
---
Well that's all the advice I have. Good luck.

[[Warpath]][[Shield Slam]]
---
That's a very bold and comprehensive opinion to just throw out there with no support.
---
Every meta has its deck that average players complain about, it is always the most prominent deck but not the best deck that gets the complaining.  In one month it went from bomb warrior, to token druid, to tempo rogue.

 Don't like rogue? Just wait a week and everyone will be shitting on mech paladin.

---
When a deck has a positive winrate agaisnt all decks against 1 or 2, it's not the player's complains, it's blizzard that fucked up real hard and must fix up with a nerf right away. Right now if you play mage, preist, paladin, shaman, druid, warlock or hunter you lose to rogue, if you play warrior you have a chance, so there are only 2 classes that can reliably climb the ladder.
---
Pre rise a shadow there was not one single deck that didn't have at least 2-3 decks as counters from other classes, not even the highest tiers, and every single class had at least one deck with 50+% win rate. There was a perfect balance between aggro, mid range, controls and combo decks (which despite no one likes, their presence makes the meta healthy).

---
No clip, just used print screen to save it. I know it didn't have charge (or technically rush), because immediately after I used the card I waited for the illumination around the card but it never came. Hovering over the card showed "charge" in its abilities.
---
That's the reason why I'd post anything here.  I've never hit legend before, but I've been finishing Rank 1 for the past few months and I am so close to breaking that barrier for the first time.  I wouldn't have anyone to share it with other than the community here, but I guess I shouldn't even do that now because nobody cares about some rando hitting "dad legend" apparently. Heh.

You get a visual aid about it, a popup, when you first open the shop.
---
A wall of text to whine about a single card that hurts no one.
---
I really don't get the fuss with Dr. Boom's Scheme. It's a biff in terms of design. I get it.
---
It's a dud out of 135 cards. And, "funnily enough," a lot of the cards that see play even from the latest set are Warrior cards.
---
This isn't the next Purify that gets a reaction because Priest was already in a bad spot and got a card that didn't help them at all (well, not for that card set at least).
---
This is just a meh card. Nothing to put this much effort into whinging over.
---
Let's try then
---
I never said you can't debate it and its not a subtle issue. 
---
Rng is currently way better designed than in past itterations of the game. If you want to talk about the content don't make blanket statements. 
---
It's complex and your statement is **extremely** simplified, excuse me you believe what you said. 
---
Also yes written language is unprecise, also you starting to insult people really helped the clarity of your statements, good job.
---
Lastly: the point with dunning kruger is: game design is not intuitive. You are a gamer, that's fine that doesn't mean you automatically understand game design.
---
I have made games i am on the other side of this, and i can tell you a decade ago i thought exactly like you.

---

---
I'll toss my hat in the ring as well.
---
It was the most intense HS game I have ever seen. This felt like an anime or a movie game... so unreal
---
I think you'll find that it is a common card to "whine" over, and the pure fact that it was changed pre release, and very poorly is the issue. There is no thought into it. It is not a bad card that just happened to be designed that way, it was probably a very good card that got slammed into nothingness. And hey, asking to fix an obviously badly made card is better than asking for nerfs like half of the "whiners" do.
---
One play is better in one situation, one play better in the other. Any other secret is irrelevant.
---
Strictly speaking, Hunterace was bluffing. Yet, because Explosive Trap seems like an out he did so very convincingly. The best play comes down to whether or not you think he's bluffing. Viper's line of thought must have been that if it's opponent was so enthusiastic, it must be the only secret that could actually save him, disregarding bluffs.

---
&gt; I think you'll find that it is a common card to "whine" over,
---
Yes.
---
And just because lots of people whine about it doesn't mean they're right to whine about it.
---
&gt; and the pure fact that it was changed pre release, and very poorly is the issue.
---
No, it's not an issue. It's an excuse to cry.
---
&gt; It is not a bad card that just happened to be designed that way, it was probably a very good card that got slammed into nothingness. 
---
Which sounds like the lesser of two evils considering Warrior is already pretty potent and a Scheme card that may or may not have had toxic design would not have been particularly enjoyable to play against.
---
&gt; And hey, asking to fix 
---
Begging the question. There is no "fix." This is how the card shipped, and it's how it is currently intended.
---
Asking to **change.** Not fix.
---
&gt; an obviously badly made card is better than asking for nerfs like half of the "whiners" do.
---
What's wrong with asking for nerfs? Asking for nerfs sounds like it makes way more sense, because it's usually targeted at cards that are impacting the meta; and those that are impacting the meta *negatively* probably should be looked at for nerfing.
---
So no, actually, it isn't better. It's definitely worse.
---
it was amazing
---
This is mainly why Mech Hunter has become the best META deck last week. It feasts on all control warriors with an average 70% winrate against these decks.

I’m missing leeroy, is he essential or do you have a suggestion for a replacement?
---
No no we do post modern doge memes now
---
*ahem*
---
"Karen you p2w wench, release me from this virtual playing card this instant"
---
He's pretty important and generally a good craft if you like playing aggro.  You can use Reckless Rocketeer instead for now, but Leeroy does 1 more damage for 1 less mana.
---
Good job for a little kid! 👍
---
I think this was fun, but the powerlevel of Firebats decks was too low. You're not winning with Yeti's against pre-nerf Highlander Priest...
---
I just used the blizzard one, with a few modification I’m making the other one when I get more dust
---
Maybe the change only applies to triggers, not auras. Khadgar's effect is basically an aura.
---
Yep, that's me! \*imitating Tommy Wiseau's voice\*  
---
It's good to feel some progress, just like i felt with this Pewds :) Btw new hearthstone fanart incoming for Rise of Shadows, i'm feeling great for this one too :D
---
This may backfire, but would be cool if it worked. 
---
Set him up to stream on twitch and maybe contact one popular streamer to host him. Then, tell us here when it happens, and we'll give him the experience of being a heartstone streamer for a bit. With all the trolling and spaming and everything...
---
I only play book when I'm playing without power of creation. Never understood why people would play it when they have book, 2 conjurers and 2 power in deck.
---
You can also counter a soul of the forest by playing minions and trading. Not all classes should be able to deal perfectly with what the other classes can do, some of course will do better than others. If you are losing to a 4 mana 6/6 stats, then you should put more stats on the board or avoid your opponent from getting to buff 3 minions in the first place.

[This](https://hsreplay.net/decks/83m7snbuaHHmjmisy6NSee/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD&amp;tab=overview) is the most popular and higher winrate token druid deck. It seems it loses hard to tempo rogue and zoo warlock. Try being more aggresive and not letting the create a board instead of asking for the exact solutions for their massive buffed boards instead.
---
[This](https://hsreplay.net/decks/mWdMPSPOjHkrEmwTSiU5Nf/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD&amp;tab=overview) is the most popular and higher winrate murloc shaman deck. It loses hard to control warrior, and token druid either kills him faster, or can trade all his little soul of the murloc'ed minions with their own tokens.
---
About the bombs from blastmaster boom, you can just place minions on the board so those are damaged instead of your face. Also, it comes down on turn 7 minimum and requires the opponent to have shuffled 3 bombs, to have an empty board, and you didnt draw any bomb yet. And still vanish and mass dispell hardcounter it.
---
Othe decks like mech hunter or mech palladin use deathrattles, but only 1 or 2 big minions at a time, not an entire board. Those are easily asnwered with any of the cards I mentioned earlier. Some of them are neutral too.

It is doge
---
I thought golden means the art moves
---
I think it's the legit good drawing that started it.
---
Shake your phone while looking at this picture 
---
There you go ;)
---
Yeah, obviously. The deck is programmed to draw Raza on 5 and Anduin on 8, why would you have a full hand entering turn 5?
---
Good boi
---
Empty and broken?
---
well thats preety weak. I saw a meme on hot earlier. I guess mine was low quality.
---
Option 1 - It's a 0-0 arena match and he's new to the game and doesn't understand what battlecry means (HCT brought new players and new accounts get a free arena tickets).  
---
Option 2, i.e the right option - He's a player that is tired of hearthstone, looking to have fun differently, and was going for the joke of "say hello to my little friend".
---
Need a pack :)
---
Lul
---
I may have upvoted that but it doesn’t mean I was happy about it
---
Maybe this is a situation similar to what happened to me today. Playing on mobile, mid game trying to talk to a friend, touched the wrong part of screen and a discover got selected by mistake.
---
also its not a meme its fanmade content
---
OwO
---
Got ya r/woosh

I AM SORRY

think you're the whooshee

I used a coin to ink out one last damage for my magic dart frog yesterday. I killed a turn 2 yeti and he conceded. It was pretty embarrassing for everyone.
---
“Always drew this in your 5th turn.”
---
I don't think anyone said that
---
Good job comrade , spasibo!
---
Look what you’ve done mate you’ve set the damn place on fire
---
Np man enjoy! :)
---
Not blink fox? NEXT!
---
Why would you do this?
---
I think this card should also be nerfed.
---
Maybe something like "Draw all your cards and 3 more". This way if you use it you suffer 1+2+3 damage.
---
sad but true xd
---
All the Hero’s are real characters in WoW though
---
&gt;wants 30 gold leg deck for free
---
&gt;obviously outrageous demand won’t happen
---
&gt;blizz is greedy
---
🤔
---
Yeah, of course it's not just rng, but imagine if he hadn't drawn Hagatha's scheme or the Walking Fountains in the final game. He got a fairly lucky run in the finals, not complaining though as he's the reason I'll be getting 6 packs.
---
"Im bad at the game and cant reach my desired rank so please give me free wins so that i can reach aa milestone I dont deserve, else you are a bad person"
---
No top tier warrior decks run double shield slam AND double execute AND double omega devs . Calm down
---
Link?
---
But next game you will have to concede too!
---
That’s interesting, because I clearly remember Heartharena having Valeera sit around 30 (when deck quality was between 60 and 70, IIRC). Why do you think those differences arose?
---
I sure do hope this was copy-pasted.
---
And hilariously enough, the mods only remove posts about these. Hypocrites really

maybe Omega devastator
---
Hunterace used it to win the world championship.
---
Yes
---
Did someone say Packs?
---
Definitely not
---
Thats really good!
---
No.
---
No, it works like that. You are not giving them charge alone. You give then also the cant attack heroes. When you create a copy, that copy has also charge and cant attack heroes this turn. Just because "cant attack heroes this turn" isnt a keyword it doesnt mean it doesnt get copied. Your first minion will be able to hit face but not the copies if they were summoned that same turn.
---
No i mean i cannot understand their decision to go to specialist when you look at the games that we had for this HCT
---
No no, not so fast... Losing meaning.
---
Now those rank 5, legend and 12 win arena runs posts arent looking so bad huh?
---
If anything was going to get nerfed it would be preperation.

Thought that was clear sarcasm

Blinkb Bloxb

Blink fox is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at three mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a random card from your opponents class to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 3/3 that can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the BF is just so positive. It comes on the board like "Wroo Wroo" and I'm like "yeah BF wroo wroo let's do this shit" and when he attacks he's like "Fox attacking noise" and I'm like "yeah foxes are SO FUN." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "wroo." And it looks so happy. I mean this is a ghostly fox literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. I mean look at his face he's just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when blink fox is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card
---
Don’t you mean [[blinkfox]]

well that's maybe a difference between russian internet and western internet cultures - we still use emoticons... but after 2nd thought i think it's really outdated habits of mine - i used to communicate like that since 2007 on the web. Well, your explanation made some clearance for me, i thought about something like this, but wasn't sure. Still, i'm not using any of that (emoticons, asterisks et cetera) in my post titles, but anyway many of my posts gets unrecognized at all. I feel like i have some social media curse lol.

but anyway i'm showing my true sincere emotions that way. but i gotta accept the time and change :)

We made it guys! Congrats. 50 packs here i come.
---
those decks are considered nearly as unethical as Kingsbane by this sub
---
Thats just goofy, and surely it shouldnt work like that. That does beg the follow up question though...why not just say charge gives rush? Or rename it rush and make it give rush...either way it isnt charge anymore.

Kibler was great.
---
We're all busy drawing our favourite cards
---
I don't understand why it's in zoo at all. It's a dead card that can easily lose you games other cards would win in many matchups and still gives you basically no chance of winning the other matchups. I play almost exclusively control, have never lost to it and have never once been worried when they play it. It's significantly worse than Gul'dan was in zoo in the past and even that wasn't good enough to make the cut.

What’s a good amount of curve and taunt? I am not experienced enough to determine what the deck needs.

---
Dunno I'm kinda "new" to Reddit
---
if you had lethal and he couldn't stop it, this was probably a desperation play to get any taunt or charge/rush minion to clear.  He probably saw that none of his choices could save him and went with the meme play just for fun.  It's the same reason people ping their own face from 1 HP instead of conceding.
---
It was a reference to the Blink Fox meme going around, which is a HS card.
---
You shut a lot of decks out if you can stick that. Removal and silence is thin in this meta
---
I'd say he's essential to tempo myras rogue. Or any rogue deck that runs waggle pick.
---
Burn everything and run.... it's a whisper all they need is your battletag

Today I got the interaction again. It worked as you expected for 1 damage.

3/2/2 | Battlecry: Discover a Mage, Priest, or Warlock card.  
---
Just look at decks online and start playing
---
Wonder if the social engineer was a fan
---
Because it’s our favourite card.
---
Honestly, as a fairly new player myself, I would have to agree. There’s almost no room for non-net decks, since usually the good synergies are placed into the popular net decks, and to have those decks, you’re going to need a large portion of cards from recent sets. If you come into the game without a collection, you’ll have to buy lots of packs to catch up or play for a long time with sub-optimal decks until you earn cards. 
---
It’s not totally impossible, but it’s not new-player friendly.
---
3/3 balanced, y know? It's fine now
---
There is only one shield slam though.
---
Leeroy gets a lot more play than Harrison but both ate fairly safe crafts. Harrison is more easily replaced with ooze in many decks but leeroy is just the most damage per card many classes have access to
---
&gt;but I find I spend about 70% of my time thinking “This is an awkward hand. I hope I draw something useful and not my second Circle of Healing.”
---
This is how it always feels when you play classic control Priest.
---
Card back for first win with any class

I'll show. You go first.
---
First of all, get your legendaries from each of the new expansions. You get one within 10 packs so buy one by one until you hit the pity timer.
---
Some budget decks I’ve seen are beast hunter and zoolock. Recommend you google those options and start building those. Or you can just get Whizbang since you have the dust.
---
The deck auto complete function now creates the best possible deck given your collection
---
Who named that street Kibler
---
Hmm I’ve tried a few decks but I’m not that good at making rogue decks lol. I’ll keep playing with him cuz good or bad he’s very fun :)
---
How... how are we making the original artist feel worse?
---
I NO FRENCH
---
Bummer. :/
---
Ha you think this is bad? You clearly didn't play in the era of ultimate infestation, malfurion the pestilent, branching paths, oaken summon, and ferocious howl giving druids 60+ ARMOR every game.
---
Fool! Chop off one head and it grows three more in its place!
---
I do feel leeroy is a “better” card as he’s not easily replaced and Harrison doesn’t feel essential when ooze is available. But I’m not sure it’s worth my dust as I primarily prefer control decks. I suppose I could try to fit him in as a finisher even in a control deck but I’m not sure how that would go lol
---
I’ve been playing since beta. I’m familiar with those cards. I think it was those cards that brought heavy armor gain for Druid for the first time if I’m not mistaken
---
deck code? or just odd mage from pre-rotation
---
One and off yeah. I got close a few times but usually end up rage-plummeting from rank 1 to 5 and giving up.
---
Reminds me of the time someone said “ranked really needs to be changed, i lost 50 times at rank 25 as a new player!”
---
Thousands of upvotes, and he was on a winstreak in the screenshot, ie he won his first 3 games and was trolling
---
Well what can you expect at 2 wins? People are pro there
---
ALWAYS OUTJERKED
---
Bout time he got some proper recognition for his content
---
Blink Doge legit had me laughing till my sides hurt
---
Thief rogue is complete RNG, it either gets nothing useful and flops, or gets stupid lucky and wins. I think Firebat put it best, in that thief rogue is the only deck that both loses every matchup and wins every matchup.
---
Diluting the deck pool puts thief rogue ahead too, Being able to add 10 cards two separate times to your deck puts you up ahead by quite a bit on bomb RNG. 
---
Granted thief rogue is often carried by cutlass, which can be stopped via ooze to seriously cripple their sustain, you never actually know if that's all of their sustain because, like I said before, complete luck.
---
Love it, thanks for sharing. Can’t wait to give this a try as a firm believer in its power
---
Same idea as poker and people love watching it and playing it. You ever watch those big poker tournaments?
---
I think it's either going to be either this Tuesday or next. I don't think it could possibly be any later than that. As you said, it's typically 4 weeks after an expansion that the single player content gets released.
---
It's a sub-50% winrate deck the higher up the ladder you go so it's not even really good there either.
---
Of course fellow acolyte
---
Thank you
---
Let Kripp decide and jaraxxus wins LULW
---
Wow is this real
---
I don’t think the loincloth is doing much
---
Pogo.
---
Thats a picture not a card
---
No, only thinking of possibilities that could disprove the coincidence.
---
You're not even control warrior, he doesn't lose that much off this?
---
( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
It has other uses, but it's best is definitely as a finisher in tempo rogue. If you have Nom, you can maybe run that instead of Leeroy. Also, a fun, fringe deck is Mecha'thun rogue, where you myras after you've found Prep, walk the plan, and have a 9 mana c'thun in hand (thanks to galvanizer)
---
YES IT IS VITAL TO MY ENJOYMENT OF THE GAME
---
I feel bad for you.
---
What you make up in RNG, you lack in a bility to do screenshots
---
IDK, sounds a lot like something a Standard-only player would say...
---
There's MUCH more than those two to be honest and both of those decks are actually beatable, Warlock is super-highrolly fun deck that doesn't win a lot, and Priest can struggle against very aggressive decks like Kingsbane Rogue, and very few people play those below rank 8 or 7 which gives OP a lot of very enjoyable and experimental ranks from 25 or 20.
---
Also, even if it were "only Big Priest and Warlocks", how is that worse than literally three oppressive rock-peper-scissors decks everyone's playing in Standard?
---
Did the OP actually say anything about feeling bad?
---
That casual RNG. It's an underrated mode, really.
---
Deckbuilding is half of the game lol
---
*poof*  
---
  
---
baAaAa
---
Meme lord?
---
Bad poster...yes
---
Things like this happen make the sub feel alive though
---
Yea but it has to wait till turn 4.
---
What is these meme can anyone tell me?
---
You cannot discover multiple copies of the same card
---
just quoting the description he put himself in his reddit profile
---
rest of the world except America spelling of favourite.
---
You're a nice person!
---
Vipor really could have won game 1. Really sad
---
Yeah, that deck completely relied on getting that combo to have any chance. I got lucky enough to get double savage roar, FoN, and innervate one game.
---
Kibler was great. Kibler is still great, but he used to, too.
---
Here’s an idea. Maybe the mods just want the subreddit to be popular? Maybe they decide wether or not “shitpost” should stay up is dependent on things like, high upvotes or number of high quality posts that day. Last time I checked the subreddit (half a day) before these posts came in they were mostly all old screenshots and 5-6 texts posts on the results of the tournament. I very quickly stoped browsing. At least I got a few laughs with the posts.
---
The card itself doesn't but Discover doesn't present multiples of the same card in the choice pool. It's the same reason why Omega Assembly played on turn ten will never generate two copies of the same minion; it's always three different ones.
---
No he is completely broken because the only builds that can win are the ones that kill fast and kill everything so any late game builds are useless
---
I'm not doubting that you may have thought this card was insane right off the bat. I believe it; perhaps you are better at predicting this stuff than most people. 
---
I thought the card was decent but didnt see just how great it was, and I'm sure a lot of other people also had their own thoughts on it. I'm just pointing out that, while it may have been obvious to you, it maybe isn't obvious to most people. I'm sure there are at least a few cards you didnt evaluate correctly too (and if not, you should be the one making these rating videos lol). 
---
If anything it is kinda interesting how having a high rank at the game (being "good") doesn't make your card ratings totally accurate. Sure, on average a highly ranked player probably would make better predictions than a lowly ranked one, but there is no guarantee that any single card will be rated correctly. That's why we see so many different opinions, even from pros.

Ginomanx3#1254 NA 80G trade, you go first
---
It can only transform into cards in the current arena pool, so no Lich King, Primordial Drake, Ragnaros or Grizzled Guardian.
---
Why, is my opponent running Alex? I can't think of any other reason the lifesteal or rush would help.
---
Unity, precision, perfection
---
Gimme gimme gimme

Congrats r/Hearthstone, Hearthstone, and Blizzard!

That's incredible

free stuff PogU

Am I the only one who is waiting the release of Rise of Shadows Adventure? I bet there will be few new cards..
---
GOLDEN common

I hope it does.

And here We Go Agane (For those that understand) posting in a giveaway knowing you won’t win is similar to playing masters qualifiers knowing you won’t win

The Hearthstone equivalent of "Land, go.".

Interesting. Count me in!

Sign me up

Ty, just HoF leeroy already

That would require removing the prep tax from each and every Rogue spell, doubt they'd do that.
---
I'm hoping for an Art of Hearthstone book. But anything would be nice.
---
:wave:
---
If you look at it over the course of 3 turns, it's really good.
---
3 lifetaps: draw 3 (1 now, 1 later, 1 eventually), take 6 damage, spend 6 mana.
---
Myra's and end your turn 3 times: draw ~7 (all right now), take 6 damage (1+2+3 fatigue), spend 5 mana.
---
You can also blast taunts, and ruin minions stapled together with magnetic.
---
For me, it's the Twinspell that really sells it. You can use it pretty carelessly and never run out of them in a game.
---
You will never know because no one ever wins. If its not public it never happens
---
The game wasn't made for esports. it was always a casual, wacky game. The  esports first mentality isn't ever gonna go anywhere.
---
Gl everyone!
---
Awesome!!
---
Congrats, Blizzard!
---
Hello I’d love to win one of these things, huge fan of all Bliz game. Thanks!
---
Hello Friends, I do enjoy some hearthstone
---
wut
---
What I don't understand is why they made waggle such high damage. 4/2 with an effect that also essentially translates into additional tempo or direct damage is just so swingy.
---
!raffle

Zaj#1277 NA looking to trade 80g quest. I'll show first, we complete your quest first.
---
I have the same fcking problem every time i want to push to legend and this shit happens . Thats why i hate this game ao much the algoritm for match-ups are always against you . I even tried Big Priest in wild and only counters against me or mirror matches with a very very poor card draw . I dont understand why the game doesnt wants me to get this stupid card back !

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

Did Kibler even play the Warcraft TCG? He was known for MtG pre Hearthstone.
---
/roll
---
I had the same problem the 1st 2 days, it finally worked on the 3rd one and I got 1 RoS pack. It was probably just bugged. It says that it can take up to 48 hours to get the rewards in their rules, but idk about that.
---
this is good
---
I agree. 3/2 wouldve been fair.
---
*SNAP* I now increased my chances by 50%
---
Muckmorpher :D see you in 8 months when im gonna hate this card with passion.
---
Its simple: I play Barnes and he summons Blood of the Ancient One. I bring him back, play him again and then I summon:
---
Nice, complaining about and simultaneously upvoting the same submissions.
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ⛏⛏
---
Good Evening from Brazil!
---
I would mrrrgggrrlrlll to the end with you
---
Looking forward to the Dalaran Heist.
---
Ooh, I hadn't heard the chaos mode. Very nice.
---
Good stuff!
---
IMO priest needs to be white/black to acknowledge the shadow archetype.
---
And Paladin isn't very red IMO. i think its more monowhite
---
I already miss The Lich King. :(
---
It's got no chance of winning when going second or against a decent boardclear, or with a bad draw. Honestly, I agree with the 4 wins. It's just that I average a bit above 6 wins usually (a bit higher this expansion so far), and these drafts are just so disappointing. Yeah, individually the small cards aren't bad, but there is nothing holding them together or allowing for a comeback. There won't be any decent games apart from going first and curving out.
---
I neeeeed it
---
It seems pretty good actually. The meta seems to still be forming though so we shall see as the weeks go on.
---
YOU MURDERER!
---
*You want to cast a spell? I want to cast a spell.*
---
Ooh fancy
---
I like to start new accounts by making one good deck with all the dust, then start focusing on building a collection
---
No that is a rookie mistake dont dust anything yet
---
I would include Apx’s evaluation - I recall his spreadsheet noting it as a 4/4 though for the actual review would have to go do some twitch VOD digging.
---
Giveaway!
---
Great guide. I will definitely remember to link this to all the question threads that are out there.
---
Couple of things:  
---
4. What Packs to Buy First - perhaps recommend that they buy 1 pack at a time until they reach their legendary pity timer? You just mention buying up to 10 packs but to 'min/max' your gold, best to just buy one by one.
---
7. Crafting - perhaps mention that when you turn a card to dust, you only get 25% value of the card rarity therefore you will need to disenchant 4 common cards to craft 1 new common card etc. That just emphasizes how rare dust is. Maybe inform the player that if they have more than 2 of any card, they can safely disenchant them.
---
A game? So kind of you to join me.
---
Here is hoping for the hoodie, was about to replace my old one, this would save me some money!
---
Might as well try
---
Priest would probably be more White/Black with the Lifesteal and Shadow cards, Warlock is generally more Black/Red with stuff like Zoo, and if there's any class that would be mono-red, it wouldn't be Warrior
---
PRECISION.

All 4 days open on like 8 different streams, got nothing but the guaranteed drop. Darn you're lucky!

Thank you for the giveaway! I hope I am lucky :)

Blackhole#2329, EU, looking to trade 80g quest. You go first, already traded several times in this subreddit
---
Comentário top!
---
I think it could be cool in single player.
---
Yesterday was my birthday Blizzard. Just saying...
---
Did I hear FREE!!! FTP btw.
---
awesome :)
---
I shall build a holy warrior of gold, And he shall GREET the WORLD!
---
Skrrt
---
Nice. Good luck everyone!
---
It's a secondary account though I can just play it for quests and one class I'll put all dust into
---
One art of heartstone book please
---
It’s treason then
---
Hello, this is kind of you.
---
correct if wrong
---
Fenrir16#1818 looking to trade 80g quest, I show, you go first
---
This comment section reminds me of that one scene from pirates of the caribbean 3 when every pirate lord gives the vote to himself
---
All the ole watch an entire season of a TV show or play 3 games of HS
---
Top comment!
---
Second pack had Onyxia too
---
Happy 1 million subs!
---
Well who won?
---
To answer your question, 
---
Yes this is supposed to happen.
---
Every ~2000th games this draw is played on turn 2. 
---
As there are loads of mages played now, you whitnessed the expected result, congratulations on whitnessing this average occurance.
---
Good luck all!
---
Here my answer !
---
Lol My money's on OP not knowing the purpose of the card in control warrior.
---
Embarrassing.
---
I really would like to win this! I love hearthstone, if I missed this once in a lifetime opportunity I might have to go full northshire cleric on everyone
---
I only post for free stuff ;)
---
Small thing, but I wonder if these figures count those that watched the event on the rebroadcast.
---
God knows it was on at a horrible hour in the UK.
---
Wooooop
---
Wouldn’t the original be closer looking to an alolan Fox? Wouldn’t this be the Kanto form?
---
Out of curiosity, could you like the post?
---
And the thing about cube is... It wasn't played in mage. Conjurer Calling would've been rated higher in a cube-using class. 
---
But there was no minions in current mage that deserves cubing/conjurer calling, and people thought it wouldn't create the archetype, but they were wrong on that.
---
Working as intended. The bomb drew the spell, not the book, therefore it is not diacarded
---
that's all the technology we have
---
Count me in
---
Thanks for running a contest.
---
The satisfaction provides from seeing “I give up, SELF-DESTRUCT” is the only redeeming thing about Dr Boom being in the game.
---
They're gonna release an insane minion that can be cheated out early with Muckmorpher and everyone will hate that card
---
5 years...
---
You actually need to dust 8 commons to craft 1, and 5 rares to craft a rare
---
Awesome!
---

---
Slowpoke meme?
---
have you considered wild?
---
You talk like you wear a fedora.
---
I would like the t-shirt and the hoodie in XL.
---
The artbook world also be nice. Thank you, Blizzard! 
---
The wallet I don't need, all my money is spent on pack's.
---
free stuff!! ;)
---
gg blizzz
---
I'll take two please
---
It is unlikely I shall be a winner.
---
I drew my favorite card!
---
It's common, so f2p likes it
---
It's le random xDDD for teh lulz xDd
---
It gives the noobs a way to play with cards they don't own
---
It's gold, Jerry! Gold!
---
My bad my bad
---
:^) lessgeddit
---
we would stand no chance against toast in this giveaway with his 100% winrate :^)
---
Oh it’s my favorite card
---

I'm only interested in the Art Book, I hope I get it
---
Going to be tough competition with 1,000,000 others vying for the prize. Hopefully only 1% of them take part in this giveaway.
---
(This counts as my entry post, I hope I'm doing this right)
---
Knowing they disconnected all salty is it's own reward.  I drink their tears.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner!
---
We are nearing the end of a season, so people are probably going to try to rank up.
---
Thanks Blizzard !
---
No, that's just Akron.

Excited for this! Thanks for doing this!

HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON
---
Kibler is at crossroads with hearthstone again? What did it do this time?
---
Awesome ;)
---
Thanks! :)
---
please pick me!
---
I got one or two of those too when I was playing that deck today.
---
Hi
---
Sounds like an RNG giveaway. Apropo for Hearthstone!
---
Testing my luck, lets see how it ends :)
---
Lets go my lurkers
---
 The big thing that control gets should reward them for controlling the board not for doing nothing
---
We can’t even see it properly, how can we use it?
---
Holy Yogg give me the power to win!
---
Amazing!
---
I actually painted this about three months ago, and I just posted it recently cause the memes made me remember to post it lol
---
I really appreciate the community involvement!  And Murlocs.
---
Team 5 casts brawl, somehow an eternium rover will get all the swag.
---
That's pretty cool. Definitely seems like the type of job someone would need to pay for hearthstone haha
---
Prize pls
---
Thanks Blizzard!
---
Hello there!
---
Thanks!
---
Would love the art book or the hoodie!
---
Eyy keep it going everyone
---
Not a condescending rant btw. Totally just curious, even though the answer is blatantly obvious.
---
I guess Wronchi joined the circlejerk.
---
⛏️How long can this go on?⛏️
---
Gimme the loot!
---
Blizzard makes a great card, but also a fine game development company.
---
Thanks.
---
Roach boy
---
entering 
---
awoo
---
im pretty sure he said turn 4 with the coin in mind. Rafaam’s scheme coin bloodbloom darkest hour which is 5 mana
---
grats on 1kk, BlessRNG
---
I would prefer it if you put board clears in your deck
---
I will win!
---
&gt; your opponent doing nothing is not boring. 
---
What.
---
Yeah that happens in every big sub.. it's not unique to r/hearthstone
