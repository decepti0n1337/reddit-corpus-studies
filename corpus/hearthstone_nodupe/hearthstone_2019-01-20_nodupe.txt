Thanks! Good to know. These are awesome resources. Just what I was looking for. Wish I had some reddit gold for ya.
---
Oh! Okay... see I thought I was playing a video game. I didn't realize this is a clubhouse for insecure assholes. My mistake.
---
Yeah, because priest loses all their bullshit AoE next rotation. Wait, no they don't. And they still can play cloning, just not 2-3 turns early. But w/ seance and pw replicate and vivid nightmare, Priest can still pull off ridic burst combo's especially if Velen lives for a turn. And Inner fire and divine spirit plus topsy aren't going anywhere for minion based burst. Plus divine hymn still makes pyromancer another source of AoE. So Priest will still be around, just far less broken than the Raza or Drak OP days. But if no ones plays Priest in standard, big rez Priest will still ruin wild.
---
Seems a bit unlikely, considering the upgraded hero power isn't worth the deckbuilding cost for non-control warrior decks that need to curve out minions.
---
are you saying ice block was a bad card?

Binding heal was playing in machine gun / razakus priest. 
---
Have some ideas since we’re talking about them.
---
Card idea: Red Whelp
---
Class: Druid/Paladin (usable by BOTH classes, like the well received Hybrid mechanic from MtG)
---
Stats: 2 mana, 2/1 Dragon.
---
Effect: Choose One. If you’re holding a dragon, deal 3 damage to an enemy character, or If you’re holding a dragon, heal 6 health to a damaged friendly character.
---
Card Idea: Green Whelp
---
Class: Druid/Rogue
---
Stats: 2/1 Dragon
---
Effect: Combo gain an empty mana crystal (if you have 10 max mana, get an excess mana card instead).
---
I'll still never understood why class cards have an appearance boost for Discover effects.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Discover on its own is already a strong effect.
---
I meant a Control deck that isn't odd, not an odd deck that isn't Control.
---
I guess everyone now knows that zalae's special.
---
I thought kolento played both acolytes for tempo, his opponent plays lich king, then he immediately draws duskbreaker.
---
Play wild and get barnes'd turn 3, sounds fun.
---
if only hex was 3 mana.
---
Well, you know, Blizzard is a small, indie company of only 2 dev's, so these things take longer with such a small team. /s
---
Have they added statistics?
---
Be honest /u/notanothercirclejerk, you only come to this sub to feed on the circles-within-circles-jerking.  The most pathetic of them all.
---
I'd imagine Hearthpwn has lists that are commonly used. It's far from a meme deck, just polarized. It dumps on control decks as it's rather fast but is very weak aggro, which will always be common on ladder.
---
Mecha'thun isn't a meme, people have reached high if not #1 Legend with Mecha'thun decks. Priest's is the fastest if you get Hemet on curve.
---
As far as I am aware, there aren't any official throwback format tournaments in Yugioh. Most of it is just interpersonal too, which is something you can make work with friends right now.
---
Well... he was better.
---
"OSFrog" works. Are there any other default frogs?
---
I would gladly like to talk to you about Hearthstone: however, giving your phone number to complete strangers is the last thing you want to do to protect your privacy.
---
hm, apparently I created my original wizbang deck in wild, so when I tried to use it in standard it didn't work lol. So I just went back and switched the deck to standard and now it works. Kinda silly that was the reason I couldn't play it. Well that's nice to know. 
---
I’d honestly assume they got banned for saying ”banned”, not Ben Brode.

This meme is like 5 months to late..

Why would you just randomly type ”ben brode” though?

I love how you just destroyed a third of the Druid’s deck.
---
Mind Blast is only seeing play due to SR Anduin and/or Velen being run in most Priest decks. Once Anduin rotates and Velen loses most of the ways to cheat him out, Mind Blast will go back to never being used.
---
Wild!
---
Aggro Shaman does, I think, but no Aggro Shaman would run Mossy Horror ever since Druid and Giggling got blasted into oblivion.
---
Ghandi would be proud.
---
Spirit of the frog is pretty decent in wild
---
Control mage (not odd) does well with one spirit and even better with a fire breather too. Potentially 3 water elementals for 5 mana.
---
WAIT A SEC THERE.
---
is that a turtle holding a shield!?!? I honestly always thought it was a tortollan pirate and the shield was a hat!
---
Oh yes, because people sure get a lot of value out of their turn 1 and two in arena...
---
I don't know what the rest of OP's deck looks like, but this is a recipe for a 12 win arena run. Kripp would 100% agree, especially after after his one run where he also drafted 4 dragon roars. 
---
Bit of a failure imo. I like the concept but they're just took week. Maybe one or two will see play in the future but not looking so hot.

You can play anything with a decent idea behind it in Wild really up until about rank ten, if not rank five. After that, that's when you start really seeing many of the decks people complain about in that format (Big Priest, Even Shaman, etc.) and gimmicky decks start falling by the wayside.
---
As such, you can do decently with the deck up to a point, but due to its general slowness and inconsistency currently, you likely will find yourself to be unable to reach high ranks consistently.
---
When you want to see if a Standard deck can potentially translate well into Wild, you should ask yourself these two questions:
---
1. Can this deck be reworked into or is something hyper aggressive?
---
2. If no, can this deck be reworked into being able to deal with hyper aggressive decks?
---
OTK DK Paladin do either.
---
YOU ARE SAFE NOW!!!
---
90.9% is only 10/11, not a big sample, especially since we don’t know your rank.
---
Well you never know what the next expansion brings. Thank you for the information.
---
Turn 1, 2, 3 = 6 mana, 14 left
---
Turn 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 = 6 mana unused? = 8 mana Reno post turn ten and assuming you wasted a bunch of mana AND held it turn 1. 
---
Yea, you’re right. 
---
That is actually a big problem for me. I will try to slow things down and think it bit more. Thanks. 
---
That is so true, I have loved so many of the non-aggro rogue archetypes but they all seem to get nerfed.
---
Just spend 800 of your 30k dust
---
What the hell is this article format? Right adjusted, periods appearing at the start of new lines instead of at the end of sentences. The actual sentence structure is awful as well.
---
It’s pretty much because now the game revolves around cheating things out. 
---
Yeah i thought the youtube titles were ironic because people did this ages ago.
---
So count to three after you drop a charge or rush minion. While it would be nice to get it fixed right now you just have to learn from your mistakes
---
I never thought of that. Could be fun. Thanks. 
---
I've learned to always wait for animations to finish before I click anything. Just to be safe. 
---
I’m saying it’s silly because he’s saying someone is insecure yet OP fame here to complain about emoting because maybe they are insecure. Because of reddit fancy txt my message didn’t come across so well. 
---
well.. that's not a whole lot different than the fairly consistent (because of master's call) barnes/yshaarj in spell hunter in wild currently, in terms of stats. it happens one turn later (since the druid was on the coin here), 14/14 stats here vs 14/15 in hunter - plus you will still have a decent amount of cards in hand with the hunter. also happens much more frequently than having double innervate in hand used to.
---
so.. barnes nerf when? oh right.. that's just wild, nvm then.
---
If you can climb past 5 legend is definitely achievable. Just stick with it and grind it out. You got this, it took me almost 150 games to break through to legend my first time after falling from rank 2 back to 5 and up again.
---
I don't think there's currently a good murloc deck
---
Well mines do decently 
---
Odd Rogue tops the curve with him sometimes, not in the most optimal lists though I don't think.
---
I dont play enough arena to know what the meta is right now, but I did just get 10 wins with a hyper aggressive hunter deck.
---
nope. total non-sequitur.
---
What is your typical win condition? 
---
Good chance it will happen next year
---
Nah. Yogg got nerfed for a reason.
---
Sounds like it but if it was printed you'd just end up with a mid-range soup deck full of all the most busted tribal cards. I do like the idea but I think the deck building restriction needs to be tighter.
---
The most important thing is that you tell everyone on Reddit if you do.
---
Sound the Bells + Spirit of the Tiger could become something in a less intense metagame.
---
On turn six, you'd have a 3/9 and three 2/2s. There are certainly worse things.
---
I call bullshit here but okay
---
Fair enough. I support this. 
---
It does the job :)
---
It does the job tho
---
Why could you still summon the bot tho? (No offence, just curious :p)
---
You hellfire'd or prep-vanished'd? Otherwise I can't think of a way that can win this game :p
---
Took 2 mana to craft it
---
Oh wait you were hunter? OK nvm XD
---
Look at deck winrate, not played winrate
---
Missing legendary is the one thing you can't search for as long as you don't show golden cards.
---
But no Unleash the Hounds or Call in the Finishers to combo it with, or Master‘s Call, or Ice Fishing.
---
He would just nuke her and be done with it though.
---
can be killed by Hemet Nesingwary

I drafted a warrior with 3 Dragon roars and one Omega assembly and that was plenty value. Cards like supercollider and brawl are really needed to stop your opponent from tempo-snowballing on the bird.

Anything said is from a constructive standpoint:
---
From what I watched, the video could stand for some editing here and there to ensure it maintains the audience's attention. I'm not sure if you have watched any of Brian Kibler's youtube videos, but I find his fairly entertaining because the videos include well-timed and thematic music to go with the on-screen action. If that isn't your thing, then maybe you can find some sort of minimal editing to keep the audience's attention (a popular example is the metal gear solid alert sound when something surprising on-screen just occured). Anything done like this I find best if done minimally. It would likely grate if any editing takes away from what is happening on screen. At the very least, "dead time" where your opponent and you are thinking something through and nothing relevant is being said/done should be edited out. 
---
Explaining your thought process as you are playing is definitely critical as well. It's good that you were doing this because it helped me understand where you were coming from and planned to go as the match went on. This I find to be especially crucial in hearthstone videos since there are so many different ways a match can play out based on what/how each player proceeds each turn.
---
All said, some room for improvement but I definitely think you can make some entertaining videos if you stick with it and practice. You seem like a cool dude. Cheers!

Could be a decent effect against control or combo. They should be 10 mana do nothings instead of unplayable so there is some interaction the opponent could have with the cards.

Read the post before you post a dumb comment.

Dont worry though, its a common mistake. Someone always does it on every single thread.
---
Clearly your fault then. Move continents and stop bitching 
---
There isn't much consistency to whether a spell with no effect can be cast or not.
---
Rush Warrior is perfectly playable, but Rhino's just a bad card.
---
How did you get it to 12 attack? I dont see any buffs on the side bar
---
I think the cause why you are loosing is that there are minions in your hunter deck. 
---
Well then, if you like rogue than Leeroy, Edwin and Captain Hooktusk comes to mind. Some pro players are of opinion that Hooktusk will prove to be extremely powerfull card.
---
Yes but onixia is just good enough to putt in all deks when they lack some late game, so after the rotation there wont be a lot of cards so it stands more chances to be played, 
---
U also dont have to think about competitive deks, they are often different than ladder deks.

Another tip: Quest give 50 gold, 60 gold, 80 gold, 100 gold or a pack. Most fo the quest are 50 and 60 gold, so the others are pretty rare. Since you can reroll a quest every day, try to always reroll quest that are 50 gold (not worth for the others). This way you can eventually get more gold (10 times you get a reroll to 60 means a pack!).
---
To reroll, click on the top right red X of the quest in the quest menu. It doesnt erase it, but change it to other random quest. You will normally reroll a 50 gold to another 50 gold but other times it will be higher so thats something cool.

In a game like M:tG with instants (ie: interaction on your opponent's turn), big showy combos like this aren't too bad.

Came here for this comment
---
Ticking Abomination isn’t an exception to the rule. It works the same way going down the spectrum. Doomsayer has a played win rate of 47%. Is it a bad card? Obviously not. It’s just a card played from a losing position to turn the game around. It’s pretty strong, but it’s never played to win, only played to not lose.
---
Every card lies somewhere along the spectrum between Leeroy and Doomsayer, and played win rate effectively removes the “play not to lose” scenario from the picture. I’d say played win rate is only meaningful for aggro and midrange, but there’s too much noise from combo even then.
---
Tell that to the person who uses the toilet after.
---
What I expect to see with the loss of Gul’dan is a faster breed of Warlock decks. Some Evenlock lists substitute Gul’dan for 6 or 8 drops. The deck benefits mostly from the hero power and armour in comparison to the board resurrect, as the majority of lists will at most bring back two 2/4 taunts and two 4/4s. 
---
This has already been proven with the new inclusion of Mosh’Ogg Enforcer to lists to counteract Hunter, as well as opening up new regions of play with Crazed Alchemist.
---
Zoo will be put under more of a clock to get the job done as they can’t bring back their Doomguards or Dreadlords anymore. However, the deck is a consistent staple for learning players and worked fine without Gul’dan previously.
---
Control Warlock will suffer less than Cube because Cube is all about the resurrection of a massive wall. Control Warlock is in a state where it has to try and re-invent itself, and lists are including less and less Demons and more cards like Howlfiend (for Treachery - Defile), Lord Godfrey, Hakkar and others.
---
Mecha’thun will find it harder to taunt down opponents using a Gul’dan wall, but the deck is much better with the standard hero power due to its already impressive array of boardclear.
---
Discard Warlock’s future is a little more bright. The loss of the quest means that you don’t have to develop a true game plan around destroying your hand. Cards like Shriek, Reckless Diretroll and Soulwarden allow a solid midrange build, but this is still a bit of theorycraft. The loss of Gul’dan hurts a lot but the archetype was already sort of in the dust anyway.
---
Decks that included Gul’dan as a win condition will be seen more ubiquitously straight after the rotation in Wild, as if Renolock and Evenlock aren’t already cutting up that meta as it is.
---
TL;DR :    Gul’dan loss means a faster Evenlock, with more 6-8 drops. 
---
Zoo will adapt to the change but is damaged
---
Mecha’thun loses a lot less power than the others.
---
Discolock loses quest and Gul’dan, huge blows but Rastakhan opens up new options.
---
Gul’dan spam expected in Wild post-rotation.
---
Okay that last part is really obnoxious because yes it's cheaper to play hearthstone, yes MTG in paper is too expensive, Hearthstone still has a lot of problems. Not team to balance the game, stale metas, annoyingly reused animations, no real theme flavor for expansions (wtf does echo and rush have to do with werewolves and a cursed forest?)
---
Also in magic you buy you're deck you own that deck, you can sell it off, trade pieces, use pieces in multiple different decks. I get a good warlock card that's good in my warlock decks, I get a good black card I can use that in all many of different decks.
---
Now I see the violence inherent in the system.
---
Weird, because Kangor’s Army can only be played if you have any dead Mechs, so Blizzard definitely knows how to properly implement such conditions. 
---
What's "trump mode"?
---
And will buff your Clone
---
I've already given you my argument. Playing around Haunting Visions into Level Up is not a winning play, I needed more value out of it. Odd Paladin has no problem filling the board with 1/1. I might survive a few more turns but would probably still lose. 
---
Play skitterer, emote, kill command own face, emote again, concede in shame
---
Enlighten me...
---
The deck has very polarizing matchups and isn't well positioned in the current meta. It used to feast on every Warlock deck but Warlock isn't very popular. Warriors are almost an autolose, every Paladin deck is a bad matchup, Hybrid Hunter is a bad matchup. The only popular very good matchup you have is vs Priests, other matchups are even.
---
So the deck just isn't very well positioned.

That's pretty cool but if you play mage you're a degenerate so..
---
Mecha loses main combo pieces: Blood Bloom and Cataclysm. Which means there's no more Mechalocks.
---
To be fair, you can get to Rank 5 with TONS of weird off-meta shit. 
---
But this is a useful feature. Their is no way blizzard would implement that.
---
Odd Paladin.  6 mana card.
---
Im seeing what this might have been hard to anticipate and play around.
---
Trying to attack to fast with a charge/rush minion
---
Adapt to the meta:) but yeah, everyone get those days
---
My guess is an issue with the concede happening at the same time/before the attack changed, creating a display bug.
---
Yeah, but why censor all messages (that could be jokes) with Ben Brode, just because some people made controversial statements during one of the streams? They have real moderators in the chat for situations like that. They could at least lift the ban after that stream. People commented the same things on the subreddit and sites like hearthpwn anyways, you can't stop it completely. And again, the censorship just makes more people talk about it (like we are right now!). 
---
I'm not even one of those people making Ben Brode comments or saying he should be back or anything, but i understand why other people do. I'm just against censorship, you can't force people not to talk about something, because you don't like it. Who knows what will they censor next?
---
Stopped playing. (I'm still here for the memes and Trolden.)
---
I don't think, say, a paladin hero Lich King card that lost tempo with an effect like "for the rest of the game slain enemy minions spawn you a 1/1 ghoul" with a random DK card as the hero power for 8 would be overpowered. Meta defining certainly, but no more than Rexxar, Dr. Boom, or Jaina in their infinite potential.
---
You probably found something close to balance if the cynics think its op and the optimists think its underpowered though.
---
People want a hero card that's even stronger than Jaina DK?
---
It depends, if someone is playing some stupid T1 deck I do everything in my power to make sure they dont reach rank 5. But when Im playing against someone with a fun or creative deck I usually concede before I kill him

---
Since i've been looking into crafting velen i noticed there isn't really a purely OTK focused velen/maly priest variant in wild. Is cloning gallery too slow for wild or is reno priest just a better version versus aggro?
---
I never said HDT did.  But the extensions may work separately.  I would be worried about the behavior being flagged as a bot for that specific extension.
---
Not so based off of this design. While yes Illidan is a demon both in the lore and in his existing Hearthstone card, this Illidan doesn't have a Tribal, unlike Lord Jaraxxus. So we'd have to assume that Hero Cards will receive a Tribal if they are eligible for one -- we just haven't seen one printed that fits the bill, yet.
---
But it would be very cool if an Elemental Hero Card existed and counted as an Elemental you played that turn, or a Dragon Hero Card counts as a Dragon in your hand till you play it.
---
I was warlock and I used renounce darkness, all warlock card wenr mage cards that way, but this card still copyd old warlock cards, that weren't there.

See I have no idea what im looking for lol

Pretty sure JARAXXUS, EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION is only a demon because he's a minion who then transforms into a hero. The other are all either hero cards without tribes or a transform from a tribe-less minion.

I've noticed the lack of representation as well. With the last expansion of Rastakhans Rumble. I took particular issue with the troll voice lines. They essentially (badly) imitate Caribbean and African accents. Now they could have chosen to create a unique accent for these characters (that are influenced by the aforementioned accents, or to use competent voice actors to get the accents right. Instead they use the half-hearted approach that essentially mocks the accents.
---
As a large organization that has the resources I really expected more. What they did was basically appropriation (artistic license aside). If the aforementioned groups mean enough to you that you use their accents there is no excuse for the humanoid characters you create not to reflect their likeness as well. This is a matter of respect of culture and identity, it has nothing to do with politics (to pre-empt that particular argument).
---
how about dont try to attack the same frame you play it if youre so concerned and "aware" of it
---
Started playing in October 2013. I don't remember anything like that.
---
yes i had won the game in this state but this was meant as a sorry so you had to wait the first few turns i even forgot to hit the end turn button =)
---
12/12 stealth or 9/11 with lifesteal and rush which means no passive is a bit stronger.
---
It gives you a copy of your starting hand. It doesnt matter if the starting hand cards transformed at some point - these cards are still your starting hand and malacrass will give you copies of them. Or is there still something i dont get?
---
Ohhh opps thank you. Didn’t realize it was their turn.
---
I mean, that was a joke, but yes, I totally agree that a deathrattle would work much, much better.
---
A solid query.  I think the answer to this in nuanced so bear with me.  When a game or other media fails to recognize and address (or worse, enhances) cultural prejudices within its gamer population; you first have to ask if that failure affects an observable portion of the gaming population of consumers of the media.  I'm fuzzy on the details, but I know that the field of sociology has studied the effect of communicated bias on majority and minority privilege groups.  I'd encourage you to look into that, somewhere in there will be your answer.  I think what I have read before was that communicated bias has little effect on a group if that group is just not a meaningful plurality of the overall population (the US just doesn't have a large Scottish population in comparison to other groups which may lack privilege or not).  It may also have little effect on the majority privilege group.  In other words, communicated bias against people who are white in the US will have little effect since it is a drop in a very, very large bucket full of drops going the other way.

Except your deck can't have spells

Probably too strong, you can get double charge with [[Stonetusk Boar]].

1/1/1 Beast | Charge

&gt; The other day I lost three consecutive games against the same Resurrect Priest player as Pirate Warrior, and he highrolled Barnes ONCE out of three games. And it's really not that hard to play first three rounds as an agressive deck and misplay much.
---
You just tend to have a very bad time against Priests when you play an aggressive deck. That's always been true, and has nothing to do with Big Priest, and if they nerf Big Priest into oblivion you will still die against Control Priest and Dragon Priest and Combo Priest.
---
Should've drafted around it
---
Chill out, you're the one misreading things here.
---
This deserves an ungodly amount of upvotes!
---
Can you elaborate? 
---
Probably not THAT soon. You need to have such a huge pool of viable even cards that work together, even for one single class. It'll be years down the road.
---
Playing a deck with 30 cards and 2 enablers? I don't need to know math to know where this is going. 
---
That would be sick. At first I was going to say way too OP, but then I remembered that DK Gul'dan, Rexxar and Jaina exist. Seems fine!
---
This literal report shows Big Priest with a *negitive* win ratio into Pirate Warrior thou, this guy might just be salty.
---
Perhaps he played Grumble?
---
The first time I had no idea what happened (thought it was bad connection or something), the second time I found out about the bug , this time I forgot. I think 3 times is enough 
---
The fact that you're able to hero power and and save one of these cards for an optimal moment in the game makes this bonkers powerful. Dr. Boom often times has to waste a HP because the random effect can only be utilized on the turn you HP (other than discover mech which is the best one usually). These are basically Lich King power level cards that you'd be able to roll for ever single turn. Seems a bit much at first glance. 
---
I direct you to the above response and its differences from your assertion.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wZnmxEI.png
---
Such high mana costs on cards that are RNG and very situational seems really bad honestly. Like over half the time you're gonna put a high mana dead card in your hand.
---
IT'S FREE PACKS FOR TEN MINUTES OF YOU TIME. 
---
Just complete them, and you'll be done with them forever and be I think two packs richer at this point.
---
Oops. My bad.
---
That's fair.  The title is provocative, and I do not have objective data to support my assertion.  My assumption is that I am right; so I've got no way of arguing with this point.  I guess my only fig leaf is that, as an artist, I'm used to existing in a space that seeks to provoke.  It was my intention, and if you believe that makes me an asshole, then that is what I am to you.
---
Well, that's done - let's talk about the topic now.
---
You get a free death knight for doing the prologue in the frozen throne solo mission. 
---
From what I've seen with other people who are strangely stubborn about getting free packs, no. It won't go away until completed.
---
Well, most Even/Odd decks don't care much for Genn and Baku as cards, often it's just a tempo play when you don't have anything else more impactful to play. I don't think that would make much of a difference. Maybe if it was something really absurd, like 8 mana 1/1, and maybe even this wouldn't be enough...
---
He’s right though... Imagine a female Twitch streamer being bomber with messages telling her to take her shirt off
---
MC Tech was recently banned in Arena, so there should be no reason for OPs opponent to play around it. Astral Rift gave him a minion that can win games on the spot and shouldn’t be something to play around.
---
Happy you enjoyed the video guys! Thanks a lot :)
---
Guessing from the downvote I got, I might agree.
---
Oof
---
Oops, I did not answer your question.  I think carefully about how I treat people of color, I donate to local charities to reduce privilege disparity in my community and I work in a field that is commonly regarded as a good vehicle for change in this arena.

No

Who ended up winning ?

I love these deckbuilding brawls.  They really show the full potential of the game.
---
Mhm! The highest I got mine to was 9/9 but I’ve seen some people get really crazy high with it haha. I never thought I’d enjoy playing Warlock so much
---

---
Remember when people use to go double Northshire in Priest vs Priest?
---
Maybe, but freeze is really a mage mechanic, my regards to [[Moorabi]]
---
The only  freeze card that ever really saw play outside of mage play is [[Glacial Shard]] which is one of the way OP low mana Ungoro cards that will likely never be printed again.

1/2/1 Elemental | Battlecry: Freeze an enemy.  
---
As I read this, I have an uncastable hounds in my hand as a priest.
---
At least its gonna be some different decks. And most strong control warrior cards are witchwood and boomsday so Im looking forward to that one
---
Spirit of the Shark saw some play at high levels in Rogues that took advantage of huge value out of Keleseth, Fungalmancer, and Saronite Chain Gang, but it just wasn't good enough.
---
Spirit of the Tiger is being seen as a 1-of in some Even Paladin builds that are essentially equal in win rate to builds without, and that win rate has been off-and-on the highest in the game, so I think it's a defensible card to play.
---
But otherwise, yeah. They're universally *slow*. Not good enough in a meta where so much can be and is cheated out so fast or efficiently. They could certainly have a place after rotation though, things are going to slow down a lot.
---
The Handlock shell remains. Giants, Drakes, Lifetap, plenty of aoe...
---
Even Hearthstone's professional players are a joke.
---
Yup. What do you do against any Control or Combo deck? Most don't care if you're clearing their minions, if they're even playing any. It could be an awesome deck in a midrange meta, but when's the last time we had that? Vanilla?
---
It probably will be different decks, but I'm like 70% sure that Odd Paladin's HP is too good to not show up.
---
Well odd paladin does lose A LOT of good cards. But I get what you mean. Genn and Baku will be pretty dominant. Just happy even lock will die.
---
This is the CustomHS way. They know nothing about game design or what would be OP, they just want to print cards that they think are cool. This card would make control lock the most oppressive deck in the meta.

He has demons under his command, in the Illidari. He specificially hunts the demons of the burning legion. He couldn't care less about other demons.
---
6 Mana isn't irrelevant. They are actually 8 Mana cards.
---
He is literally classified as a demon in WoW, in Hearthstone, and has an immortal demon soul.
---
He was *transformed* into a demon. It is not "partially correct," it is fully correct. Yes, he is a Demon Hunter, and takes demonic power for his own, and has a demon within him.
---
All that does not dismiss the fact that his very soul itself is demonic, and Illidan himself is immortal the same way any other demon is.
---
Too Slow

&gt;We only report on the decks of the opponents. This way, we provide an unbiased picture of what the meta looks like to a random ladder player. That is, what would the player expect to see as opponents.

---
Not saying it wasn't, but it probably hit Quest Rogue the most.
---
&gt; And in most metas you can pretty much guess what decks your opponent will be playing, and thus estimate his hand pretty accurately.
---
Especially if you use a deck trecker and know what he has already played to 100% accuracy.
---
so your run went x-1 yesterday? 
---
This isn’t about making a misplay, this is a GAME MECHANIC that he should know about, you probably knew that you couldn’t do this and I don’t see you in any world championships either

It’s like playing CS:GO for astralis but not knowing about one way mid smokes on Mirage

I'm not saying censorship is illegal (which is, under special circunstances that are not these), I'm saying censorship is immoral, a dick move out of something that should be used for expressing opinions: A chat.

But need to defend myself, doesn't I? I'm not the one doing something as idiotic and spiteful as banning a former employe name out of my chat because people like them more.
---
You can lick Blizzard's boots as much as you want, you won't gain anything out of it, because they don't care for any of us.
---
WE HEARD YOU, now say something of substance
---
Probably in connection with the rest of the deck? He maybe has a single mech in it.
---
Bad troll.
---
No, it is played in a lot of good decks in both standard and wild currently.
---
/s
---
But if you have a me... Nah... Wtf.
---
If you have no cards that summon stuff from your hand, yep.
---
The Rogue mulliganed for early game and then de-tempoed himself for card draw so you should already be ahead on board.  Figure out your outs from there.
---
Well the game states you can’t have more than 10 mana so that kinda contradicts it.
---
It would show if there was any synergy. So no mechs
---
Mistake vs. Not understanding a basic mechanic that has never changed?
---
Ehhh
---
Odd Paladin.
---
Tbh Otk decks are just as bad
---
Somewhat bored.
---
Me too. Which archetype 
---
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Illidan_Stormrage
---
Look at his race "Unique Demon Night Elf Hybrid". Also that get mentions in the game itself, I think by Maiev Shadowsong if I remember right.
---
&gt; and Illidan himself is immortal the same way any other demon is.
---
Well, to be pedantic, he was already immortal before he became half a demon as he was born a Night Elf under Queen Azshara. His Brother and his Crush are also both immortal.
---
And I thought mountain giant was the worse we could get......
---
Two things, first since you posted your first pic I've noticed how many glass and ceramic frogs are around my house parents house.
---
And 2 I'm inspired to build a wild frog shaman with as many frogs as possible. 
---
I don't think there's a definitive story, it's just a coincidence. However, people on the forums claim that the murlocs found the Glyph in a jungle, began worshipping it but accidentally released some evil power that consumed them.
