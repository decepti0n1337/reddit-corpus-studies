What I think he's saying is that Blizz intentionally tunes Classic to be (in general, with notable exceptions) less powerful than expansion cards so that you're encouraged to use (and buy) the new cards when they come out.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So I think we all agree that your suggestion isn't ridiculous. It would be well in line with the power level of other hero cards, but Blizz probably doesn't want to buff Classic cards in general. They'd rather have it non-viable than powerful enough to use regularly.
---
---
---
Completely different. Murlocs cap out at about 5 mana, by devolving you give big priest 7/8/9 mana minions which are often stronger than a random murloc by far.
---
This seems like a really strong control tool? The one thing worth considering is that this could backfire pretty terribly, but I‚Äôd put this on par with something like Volcano.
---
(Where are the heroes?)
---
NA 80g quest trade Lightp#1333 you go first
---
But both cards are still good in that deck individually.  You don‚Äôt need to have them both for them to be effective in the deck.
---
&gt; Maybe starting at 10:00AM?
---
Notice that the times are on Central european time. Meaning 10AM in CET would be 1AM-4AM in USA. A weird time for them to be livestreaming.
---
I recall KnC's trailer was an ad too, also RB, can't recall about others though.
---
i think projects and plagues are just a theme for spells with symmetrical effects but plagues are for classes that did not get projects.
---
Interesting - witchy is definitively my LEAST favorite. But I don't play mutate shaman and the mutate effect has always been too RNG dependent for my taste. I can see how it would be powerful in that deck though.
---
Touche
---
both: "...fuck, now we have to put up with dragons!"
---
boom: "...no problemos my **sm0ll** bombs will kill dem"
---
There aren't many murloc synergies you can capitalize on when transforming them on the board. Most are battlecry synergies.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm gonna guess that‚Äôs a spell.
---
KnC also was an ad and is sitting at 1.6M, 1/3rd of this, same with RB, so we can safely assume that even if it weren't an ad it would be around 1.5M tbh (if the proportion stayed true).
---
Yeah, I think in a vacuum, Ethereal is clearly the strongest. Situationally, the others can be better pulls but overall Ethereal is crazy value
---
Not gonna lie, I listen to the trailer on my way to work almost every day, the song is just so damn good and catchy.
---
Correct!
---
That's a card.
---
Hopefully a controle card
---
He got them through Rafaam RNG
---
Yeahhhhhh having a 50% chance to discover yourself doesn‚Äôt seem like a good choice when spirit of the shark and new shaman quest around
---
*laughs in Rogue hero power*
---
They also have insane synergy though. Your opponent only needs a few minions to deal 10+ dmg with random Murlocs.
---
Yeah and to be fair, you usually lose as Druid anyway if you lose the board.
---
Personally,  I'd say that about Witchy but not so much Goblin. It is situational but situations where it's helpful seem fairly plentiful to me. I'd still place it no higher than 4th but I generally find I get my use out of it.
---
The reason Hagatha's value isn't complained about is because shaman spells are mostly conditional, niche, or backfire with overload.
---
Username checks out
---
I think they soon should do an expansion that isn't so cartoonish, it's been like that every time now for some time, maybe since wrath and old gods. 
---
I would like at least once in a while a series that is more dark or dirty somehow.
---
Its the grindiest tech card. At least other hate cards swing the game faster
---
Evil descends from the skies
---
With paladin, it could also add a 2/1 to your hand or something silly. It‚Äôs hard to tell.
---
Oh no not again
---
Just rope and end your turn that way. Ez
---
I love it when it is 1 mana 5/6 ;)
---
They gotta play giants or counter spell, right?
---
With charge
---
Warrior will get a plague and it got a project before. Hunter didnt got project and wont get plague.
---
Projects affect both players, plagues all minions (except the rogue one, because they had to change it last minute due to class identity stuff, as they confirmed).
---
Only evil classes will get a plague. Its a similar concept to projects, but nothing else.
---
why?
---
Unffff
---
It's almost like having good Classic/Basic cards can keep your class at least useable no matter what the xpacs give you, huh?
---
how about a card like Reno Jackson? you pay 6 mana to get a full heal, something that is valued much higher. Reno has an obvious downside, and because of it he is loved by most players i see on this forum. almost every archetype ever has some kind of mana cheating with a downside/restriction. the definition of, ‚Äúsomething that accrues more value than you paid for‚Äù is basically just the definition of a good card.
---
Easy 5 stars
---
Yeah you hit escape and press the red button, because there is no way you beat the trinity.
---
Actually I'm pretty sure wotog was popularity height, but that had ads everywhere too (also because of retargeting campaigns, as hs users and viewers we will see more hs ads)

This is better than devolve. Pretty nuts.
---
oh yeah forgot about wotog
---
Many thanks!
---
It would be nice, I agree. I feel it would still be balanced, but I'm not sure.
---
However, it definitely won't happen. They've now tentatively lifted the lid on buffing cards, but given their philosophy I'm almost certain that the one thing they *absolutely* want to avoid at all costs is getting into a moba or mmo style balancing seesaw with any cards, where they buff a card and then feel they need to nerf it. So I feel they're gonna stick to buffing expansion cards where it's less of a risk rather than tune classic cards.
---
An early Wild highroll [[Darkest Hour]] can pull a couple of [[Nerubian Unraveler]]s which would make all of those cards unplayable. There's that, at least.

0 vanilla 2/3
---
&gt; The suggestion is having the opportunity to be able to play different roles with different classes. 
---
And you have that in Wild.
---
The two main issues with trying to enable every archetype into every class within Standard are you will end up giving tools to decks that should not have them and the boundaries between classes will become more muddy than the already are.
---
Enabling at least twice as many archetypes as their currently are too would either necessitate perhaps tripping the number of new cards per set or a massive increase to the strength of neutral cards. Neither of which are good paths for the game to take.
---
&gt; Further to this you seem to also imply then that if there are 2 classes right now that can run control they must "function near identically" which is far from the truth. 
---
Yeah. I know, but if all nine classes can capably all five primary archetypes, some of those forty-five decks will end up playing extremely similarly be it within their own class or otherwise.
---
Specializing classes is ultimately better for the game rather than letting each class do whenever all the time much like colors in MtG.
---
Vanish was a weak card? Do we play the same game???
---
i think they start the very first parts of an expansion about a year before it comes out, and i mean the very first parts, like deciding the theme and whatnot
---
Thank you! I will play shaman to exterminate big priests.
---
I don't even remember my run with Lazul. I remember having fun with Boom and Toggwaggle, but Lazul's run is a blank.
---
Guess I should remove the word weak
---
But it haven‚Äôt seen recent play

What Team 5 does with Hearthstone is no different from what Wizards of the Coast do with MtG.

Could be wrong but I thought it doesn't work like that
---
Don‚Äôt forget the frog. 4 ways to obliterate rez priest before it even get to play the key cards

Chronicler#1916 NA 80g quest
---
Gotcha, edited it out from original post
---
Btw, what is your thought on this(not counting my vanish argument)
---
All 18 possible Whizbang decks will be changed (quite possible that they'll just be 'tweaked' i.e. Only a few new cards, but you get the idea.)
---
Four Siegebreakers?!?!
---
yeah. in wild its really good against big priest. I mention that else where. I was talking about standard. That should be implied on the main hs reddit though.
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt imagine an R-rated gnoll
---
It saw a hell of a lot of play at medium and low ranks, though- as in the place where 90% of hearthstone players spend their time.
---
Why did you put it at 3 mana?
---
Pretty hard to evaluate to be honest. The Aggro Paladin deck is pretty far off from existing at the moment and an aggressive 1-drop fitting the 'Quest' theme is pretty bipolar. Doesn't get grabbed by Crystology as a small hit. Right now Paladin either needs serious board flood potential to capitalize on Never Surrender (5/5 card, legit) or they need more reach alongside re-fuel cards. As a stand-alone, it's like a 2/5. In Wild Odd Paladin, it's a 4/5. In Standard as it is right now, probably a 1/5.   
---
If the deck gets there though, everyone will hate this card because it will hit you for like 6-7 damage while forcing you into tempo inefficient lines of play.
---
took me a second
---
Here, have a gold star. üéñ
---
Wym
---
Thing is, people like Kibler also tend to have spent a lot on the game for large collections. He plays off-meta decks because he can afford it.
---
This makes Plague of Death look like such a joke.
---
I do not see silverback, flamewreathed or oger. What are you talking about?
---
Lol ya! I played mtg for about five years (it's been about fifteen years since then though lol) but hs has definitely been scratching the itch that I never lost for mtg (been playing hs for about three and a half years).
---
I have found that the creativity really comes in how you tech your deck. So ya, you are not likely going to discover an entirely new deck and have a ton of success. But, in a solved meta like what we will have until the next expansion drops, everyone playing competitively knows largely 27-30 cards in their opponents deck from the jump. Can you counter what you are facing with those 1-3 spots and do it in a way where your opponent is at a disadvantage bc they couldn't expect it. I think that is where the deck building component comes in for those of us who aren't professionals
---
I've always wanted to get the two elixirs. I always die after taking one of them, unfortunately.
---
You play . . . Oh wait he isn‚Äôt in the deck
---
&gt; Err ok, you meant that was not what you meant perhaps and misspoke(typed)?
---
No. I meant that you misunderstood what I wrote. I wasn't saying he suggested dividing mechanics. What would that even mean? I was clearly talking about the way card games are divided into factions to explain why his idea wasn't feasible.
---
&gt;this "identity" nonsense
---
You keep saying this, but card games that are divided this way *need* identity to their factions. Otherwise what's the point of the factions at all? Not having a vision for what their unique strengths, weaknesses, flavor, etc. are is nonsense, not the other way around.
---

---
Don't do this. Cyclone mage is one of the harder decks to play and does not have a very high win rate outside legend. Focus on improving skills with mech hunter and save the dust for next expansion.
---
Fuck I miss Ben Brode
---
How the hell ?
---
I think it's known that Team 5 members browse that subreddit for inspiration. What do you have to gain by claiming theft? Just get your bragging rights in: you made a a real card, congrats!
---
A man ahead of his time.
---
 NA: Kruciverb#1565, I'll show then you go first
---
First one's from monster hunt
---
Top 2 victims..
---
Cries in Mech Paladin....
---
I'd argue it's a bigger victim since you'd suffer MORE by losing mechs earlier on, since you're losing 3-4 cards for their 1, and not getting the mech back from Kangor's Endless Army. That situation will happen a fair bit on the same turns that Giants would get on board. Mages losing giants in the late game would hurt less AND this card counters Mech Paladin's huge game winning turn, even when they play Vargoth alongside it. In addition, you get 2 copies of it, so using several cards to pressure the board and force this out won't work, as if you do it 2x, you lost your hand and you have no viable targets for Kangor's anyway. This card screws Mech Paladin way more than Cyclone Mage imo..
---
Control shaman always out fatigue warrior now, nothing new
---
Fuck murlocs. 
---
That is all.
---
Yeah and it completely fucks with their Rez pool
---
According to Ben Brode, I believe. Don't know if they still do it that way.
---
Oh cool thanks for the clarification. How annoying tho I wanted to make home slightly more viable. Thank you for clearing that up!
---
prepare for an 80 Card drop via Facebook 2 days before release
---
AFAIK there are no Murlocs with taunt  
---
  
---
Old Murk-Eye is a thing, and he's probably going to be buffed by at least one random Warleader
---
Why did Toast get a card reveal when he doesnt even play Hearthstone anymore and Thijs didnt get a reveal???
---
Aah thank you, classic hearthstone consistency at its finest.
---
Survive 9 turns\* actually
---
Honestly, kinda sad to see this, though.
---
Damn it I thought I was on to something. I just want him to be more viable. Cheers for the clarification.
---
You assume they didn't do it on purpose
---
But you can't use your attacks to kill their Murlocs unlike devolve
---
I think that would be awesome and not nearly as scary as it sounds but I guess it‚Äôs not for everyone. I just thought it would make him slightly more viable.
---
If you play a deck with call in the finishers probably most of your board is murlocs
---
Good guess, maybe "Venomous Trap". When your opponent equips a weapon, replace it with a 1/1 snake. Art is her holding a weapon with a snake around it.
---
Think the highest health Murloc in standard has 4 health, so this means it‚Äôll make pretty much any board an easy clear if you prepare.
---
True
---
I personally don't see it as that bad. If you thought of it as a 10 mana card Jaraxxas, battlecry: summon 6-6 demon. 
---
You'd have people defending it saying "it's a 10 mana card, it's suppose to have a powerful impact on the board" 
---
Why being 8 mana as a slightly earlier heal, or the flexibility of HP or a 2 mana card is OP; i just dont see it.
---
Ready for Action!
---
OKAY, since everyone seems to misunderstand, it is a joke, I KNOW THAT BLIZZARD DID NOT STEAL MY CARD, and I am proud that a card that I custom made was balanced, thematic, and powerful enough to both be printed and send waves through the community. I do not expect anything out of this other than bragging rights, and I am just happy that it happened.
---
Getting a card I need is more valuable than a card that is getting dusted. I can get the min dust, or some good cards and some dust.

Brode: "You want something new? Ok, here you go!" [[Purify]] Ha ha ha ha
---
It seems awfully disingenuous that you bring this up and quote it, while completely ignoring (intentionally or not) the *very next sentence:*
---
&gt; Troll druids visiting the Moonglade have been overheard calling the wisps who reside there loa, just as they refer to Goldrinn, Aviana, and the other returned Ancients as loa. **Night elves and tauren have tried to counsel these trolls on "correct" druidic nomenclature, but the trolls thus far have been stuck in their ways.**
---
Also, it has been clarified in the Chronicles that the Ancients and many of the Loa are one in the same - the classification of "Wild Gods." This clarification is in Volume I of the Warcraft Chronicles.
---
Hence, "Wild Gods" being a more appropriate term for what you were describing. It's not necessarily *wrong,* but Loa is a troll thing, the same way you don't call traditional troll Loa "Ancients."
---
The same distinction is why you don't call blood elves "high elves." Even though they are physiologically, their political affiliation and/or sympathies has made them a separate people. This is why Valeera Sanguinar is a blood elf despite being an agent of the king of Stormwind, whereas other Silvermoon elves of the Alliance tend to identify as high elves (like Vereesa or Alleria Windrunner).

omega devastator is basically deal 14 damage to a minion.
---
If you transform a Crab that ate a Murloc into a Murloc; does that make the crab a cannibal?
---
Well, but back then you also got cards that you couldn't get otherwise, and they didn't release an expansion alongside the single-player.  So instead of buying packs you bought the adventure, you could get all of the cards without even spending all the gold you accumulated since the last expansion.
---
Lemme try again.

Shouldn't it affect only the game it was played in, not the whole run?
---
Hte card art screams 7 drop to me idk why
---
Yeah the truth is more like "12 minutes and then we reuse half the art from other things"
---
during odd paladin still in standard, i always face them when playing other classes. but when i switch to Priest all of them suddenly disappear. then i would proceed to concede until i found one
---
Like your art better!
---
I haven't seen that stated anywhere.
---
Portal all the way, also suggest downloading arena helper to help with decisions in the future my dude.
---
looks more like a dwarf to me
---
Take everything out and replace them with Murlocs :p
---
Jk, I'd take out an archmage and both zaps for Ysera, Batterhead and Zilliax (in that order). I'd also replace one of the safeguards with Cairne. 
---
Archmages never feel like a good play when you don't cheat them out and I don't feel as though I get very much extra value from running 2 over 1. Zap sounds kinda weak in this deck, though I haven't tried them out so maybe they work really well in ways that I haven't thought of. Safeguards nd Cairne kinda do similar things, exchanging the taunt for more stats, so that's more of a preference/ dust consideration, I personally just rate Cairne a little higher in this deck. 
---
If you're keen to keep both zaps and don't have those legendaries, Exotic Mountseller could be good with all of those low cost spells.
---
Calin17#2110, trading quest on EU, you go first

His belt appears in another teaser image as well, on July 24th 9am.

Isn't this expansion going back to that model??
---
We get a free legendary quest... I mean those seem really cool. So it seems like a good legendary option. 
---
Even both expansion bundles are offering a golden legendary...
---
Either way I agree
---
That was kinda obvious since he's one of the heroes this expansion alongside Elise, Reno and Brann
---
Even if they stole it. Why is that bad? Your card literally made it into the game. That's the best possible outcome.
---
Also pretty sure the designers check costum cards for ideas. It just makes sense
---
&gt;That's better than flamestrike + 2 fireballs combined, and it doesn't sound that high rolly at all.

I messed around with Control Shami in dumpster legend last season and one of my opponents played Jaraxxus on curve at almost full health. Although he sacrificed half of his health, he won that game, I didn't have burn and he could deal with my threats.
---
I wasn't mad about, it was Jaraxxus who did beat me in the end, but I still agree with you.
---
Didn't you received a free Vargoth last expansion?
---
How so?
---
murloc shaman
---
Link please?
---
Best not to waste more slots.
---
it really was game over for the priest after jaraxxus. It was handlock so you were already dealing with taunted Giants and twilight Drake's all game
---
Really? You are going to end his whole career returning a 6/6 magnetised minion to the hand of a warrior with full health and 11 armor... yep, I only can see his conceding after that play...

privius#1842 NA u go first 80g quest
---
&gt; This murloc one is fishy for sure.
---
Is it really, though? It's a rather simple idea, that fits with the identity of Shaman.
---
We also know for that Blizzard generally finishes an expansion a couple of expansions before it's out (at least that was the case a couple of years ago), and we also know that they have a large amount of unprinted cards and ideas that aren't in an expansion already (like Sn1p-Sn4p).
---
You don't put Owl in Secret Hunter, dude.
---
After three months I remember what all of them do, but don't remember their names.
---
Have we sunk to the point we even upvote someones emote BM when he's about to win?
---
I genuinely can't tell if you messed up and put mark of the wild instead of mark of nature, or if the joke was that your combo just outright kills the chicken.
---
Must be hard playing giants and then playing 3 cost spell to split them into 2 minions or Leeroying someone in face then waggle pick then Leeroy for 16 damage.
---
New "meme"
---
Retards think it's funny xD LUL LOOK AT PPL GETTING TRIGGERED BY HOW DUMB WE ARE LUL xD xD xD
---
Good to have goals.
---
Not quite. If I draw a picture of a WoW character Blizzard isn't free to use my art work as they like. However you can't patent mechanics. If I came up with my own Warcraft character, made my art, then posted my card; it would be mine. Blizzard could lift the mechanics all they want, however.
---
I've been running azalina and faceless/banker. It isnt very good but its funny. Faceless is just a very good card.
---
These sure are some ugly shirts
---
That's roughly what I meant. intellectual property and copyright laws are complex beasts lol
---
Can you give her some pupils while you're at it?
---
Can we just take a moment to congratulate this crazy motherfucker for mastering wild AND standard
---
Depends a lot on what you want to play. For what it's worth, in successful decks, currently it's only used in Wild. (Deathrattle Hunter)
---
Is it just me or does it seem like there's less content creators revealing cards compared to websites as there usually is? Maybe it's just because I don't recognize most of the content creators who don't speak English but it feels like we're missing more streamers or something.
---
link to the video?
---
Murk-eye is in wild
---
Dont add pyro, is really bad in this kind of deck.
---
Against aggro shaman has better options that dont fuck up with the strategy of the deck.
---
Just got broken up with. I love Murloc shamen. This might be the best timing ever for me. Gonna fill my broken heart with Murlocs, baby!

If the hero power made all cards drawn 0 sure. But it only makes the cards drawn with the hero power 0

Do you like Hogsteed better than Bluegill warrior? I can‚Äôt decide which one is better

were supposed to believe you hit legend with Shaman only with 390 wins only?

you'd look pretty cool probably
---
I've gotten a sneaky lethal of kobold more than once which is why I like him.

Idk why but Jul 21st, pit lords always grab my attention.

I think I played u several times over the past few days on the wild ladder and in legend as well haha

Jesus wow, haven't seen a pack like this ever, you lucky bastard

The pity timer for legendaries is separate for each pack. Opening old ones doesn't affect new ones.

Hey all! Newb here with newb questions.

What‚Äôs the difference between wild and standard? Also I enjoy playing a Mage kind of defensively, and was wondering what a good defensive spell casting mage looks like.

Thanks!

---
Unless you really care about golden cards, it's best to dust any golden cards that you have 2 none golden versions of(or 1 for legendaries). 
---
Think about this: would you rather have more cards, which means more decks you can play, or have the decks you do have have a couple of golden cards.
---
Or if you spend money on the game, do you really want to be paying more to have some of your cards be golden?
---
alright, thanks.

"whenever you cast hero power" then.
---
Yep. Reno is cheesy when it works, but not much more than decent overall.
---
I think that rush is I big part of the problem but delivery drone gives it constantly value so you always can have 8 Omega devastetors. I want boom to be a good card just not broken one if you take rush away it loses the idea why you would put it in the deck.
---
Ah.
---
Well yeah, I stand by the title of that video. I'd call that a bug. The fact it got changed implies to me that they fixed it.
---
lol aren't ppl bored with the same 3 deck over and over? lol

Honestly I think she's not cartoony enough, she falls right into the uncanny valley for me.

Discover a Murloc would be pretty neat. Or three! Omega Finley

No more aggro paladin or combo, can we just get some more support for dragon/control paladin, geeze

You're guaranteed a legendary within your first ten packs and you can't open a legendary you already own from a pack unless you own every legendary from that set. After that, you're guaranteed a legendary within every forty packs of a set.
---
Uniqlo make excellent clothes for the price (i own MANY of their tee shirts, jeans etc.) and the print quality is usually excellent. 
---
Not seen these particular designs in person but happy to endorse the quality. They do loads of collaborations with brands and independent artists, they've got pokemon and capcom stuff going at the moment.
---
Guess everyone will know where i got my sweet monster hunter tees from now.
---
How will this interact w double battlecry hero power? Will it gain 2/2 twice?

 EcceHomo#2205 80g quest EU, I can show, you go first.
---
I 'member.
---
Yup. Technically, it will also destroy the same murloc twice, but that's not actually doing anything. Dead is dead.
---
It varies from artist to artist, myself as a digital artist I have the option of sending it separated so it is easier for the animator, but there are artists that work on traditional media (like most of Alex Horley's cards) that the option of separating in layers is pretty much impossible.
---
Lazul is the worst hero by far

Wait, the list is a little bit confusing with the format. Is it:
---
Mid-range Hunter 
---
Token Druid Warlock
---
Zoo Warlock
---
Silence priest
---
Right?
---
Username checks out.
---
Ok so it won‚Äôt gain the additional 2/2 then? It will be a 3/4 instead of a 5/6
---
Only supposed to have one, visual bug
---
They're a lucky bunch of bumbling idiots
---
Some people around the internet weren't happy with the art for Brazen Zealot. I personally did't like it and really didn't care that much but if asked, my main issue with it was the mouth just seemed really off.
---
There was a visual bug. You only got 1. If you closed the game and reopened it when you got it, you'd see you only have one. This happened to many people.
---
I dunno what you did with the dust, but this is a good lesson to never disenchant cards unless you're crafting something right away.
---
Oh, sorry. You were right, it will gain 2/2 twice. Battlecries and death resolving is a bit weird that way. The death (including the deathrattle) resolves after the battlecry, which does happen twice.
---
It's a visual bug. You only earn one. You can earn another one in wednesday's tavern brawl though. So don't worry
---
Step 1: Play Rogue  
---
Step 2: Weaponized Pinata to get Glinda  
---
Step 3: Play Glinda and Baleful/Scheme it to put it in your deck.  
---
Step 4: Play Jepetto to get a 1 mana Glinda.  
---
Step 5: Get Plague of Murlocs from Pilfer.  
---
Step 6: Play Plague of Murlocs (you with empty board), Glinda, and 6x Hungry Crab.
---
You can get a 7th if you Backstab your Glinda into the 7th, and to cover the 1 mana either have the first Hungry Crab be previously Shadowstepped or use a Coin from Wanted!
---
That's an overall 4 card (5 with Backstab) 10 mana combo to wipe your opponent's board and summon 6 (or 7) 3/4's. I'd say meta defining tbh.
---
Statistically, I think you will get essentially all of the Commons and rares if you get either bundle because of your 5000 gold. It's important to know you start to get diminishing returns the more packs you open. I would say once you get to that 100 packs number, you are really only opening packs in hopes of getting legendaries or epics you still want.
---
Side note: I had really bad luck with legendaries last expansion so if you are worried about your luck, get the 80 pack bundle lol.
---

Not a ‚Äúgood job. But check this score out‚Äù.  Nothing constructive whatsoever. 
---
I get Negative Karma for condescending to take up their field of vision with anything I wish to contribute. There‚Äôs got to be a more wholesome Hearthstone sub out there.
---
Jade Shaman is bad.
---
You had the most op deck ever and took +35+ min to finish the run? I guess your op deck wasn‚Äôt that op...
---
I love playin the types of games you describe too and as you can‚Äôt do that in any of the modes I would suggest getting a friend with exactly the same style as you. I have a friend like that and we can sit for hours on end just making crazy wacky combo decks or decks that would never work in standard with. If you could find one I promise you that you will find the game really entertaining again.
---
Came here to say this. 
---
I know it‚Äôs light hearted but posts like this hurt the future of HS. 
---
We don‚Äôt want to see card ideas never seeing the light of day because they‚Äôve been posted on Custom HS before and it‚Äôs not worth the aggro
---
AWAKEN, JOJO BRETHERN
---
I agree ‚Äì I think that's what I was saying, isn't it?! Both that 'I recognise I don't represent the whole player base, or even a tiny sliver of it probably' and also that I know this is the deliberate direction they're going in with the game so I'm going to go and find a different one to play cos it's not to my taste. I mean, I get it: people wanna play a game in a break at work or on a short Uber ride, and me wanting to drag everything out to a 40 minute back-and-forth rally isn't fun for lots of players. 
---
I will say, though, that I don't think it's accurate to characterise it as ResidentSleeper gameplay when you're doing it with Rogue. It's not like Warrior where you can just hero-power pass. You pretty much have to find something to do every turn, otherwise you'll just get punched in the face a lot and die. 
---
I'm surprised more people don't find some of the recursive or bounce stuff fun (like getting to Cube a Cube with Sonya in play and creating loads more 1/1s that can keep making more of whatever you eat) but I guess either they haven't messed around with it or they just get more satisfaction from hitting lethal than I do and start wondering when they get to do that bit.
---
The other game I was playing most before was probably single-player Civ V, so I guess I just like slow, almost toy-like strategy things. If people have got suggestions of other stuff in that mould (that can run on Mac), I'm all ears!
---
Wow that‚Äôs a thing? You‚Äôd think lazul would provide another duplicate option if there are only 2 unique cards
---
I still dont have old murk eye :(
---
I don't think control shaman is going to care about a plain 1 Mana 3/4 with no other real effect.
---
If you want the card you craft it, I don't see your point.
---
I don't think it synergises *massively* (not as much as it does for control), but I think it could still be good enough to boost even aggro decks.  One big benefit it does give is as a combo on your bloodlust turn to allow you to ignore taunts.  Aggro decks used to run devolve for that purpose, and this does that even better, since I don't think there are **any** taunt murlocs.  Plus it has a few side advantages in matchups where you don't need that, like letting you turn your totems into murlocs.
---
I think you'd pick this before Hex or Earth Shock, and even the aggro decks are running earth shock right now, so I think there's a good chance it's going to benefit even the aggro decks.
---
Lol stay mad dude. If you sorted by new you would instantly see a bunch of people posting their mediocre times that are still better than yours. This is useless content and uninteresting. That's why it's downvoted. Hate to break it to you.
---
This is the cringiest thing I've ever seen on this sub.
---
"Haha, see how sleep deprived and quirky I am?!"
---
Hey, thanks for the suggestion. I've struggled to find other things that scratch the same itch, so appreciate any ideas! I played a bit of Into the Breach the other day, that was pretty fun. Single-player things seem to get old a bit faster is the only thing.
---
midrange hunter -&gt; play things on curve
---
OmgaLUL
---
Pretty cool actually
---
Goes to show that Blizzard are inept at balancing their game.
---
Why do some of the players have their country's flag next to them and some have a couple of HS cards? We know what countries these players are from.
---
Ha, sounds good. If you ever figure out a way to make Duskfallen Aviana or Harbinger Celestia not completely useless, I'd love to hear it!
---
Nope. Discover can't show duplicates at all. That's why Dire Frenzy into Master's Call will not draw all 3 beasts, because they are the same card and you are technically discovering them. If the condition is fulfilled, Master's Call skips the visual discovery step and draws cards right away; however, the discover mechanic is still applied.
---
&gt; Edit: I made a post the other day about the Reborn keyword where 5 people responded they were sure they keyword was gone after death cause it would work the same way as twin spell and all of them are wrong. So feel free to respond now that it has been confirmed I don't care, attacks can't target a friendly minion it was reasonable to question if this could.
---
Yeah so you are comparing a choice in how the keyword is displayed to a game mechanic.
---
Reborn IS gone after a minion dies. If the keyword doesn't dissapear, that's fine, no one cares. People only care about how the cards work.
---
iThaddius#2329 trading 80g on EU. I can show my quest, you go first.
---
Excellent job! I realized I was already following you.
---
I think big priest is worse because of the resurrection abilities it has, hi obsidian statue, bye obsidian statue, hi obsidian statue , bearing in mind I don't play wild but that's what I was used to in standard, fountain is tricky and too strong, I agree, but on ladder I don't come across many
---
You're absolutely right. That being said, no one is an owner of an idea unless it's patented. So Blizzard can become an owner of any idea posted here if they want to.
---
Just imagine they make a card that enables dual-wielding weapons to warrior only
---
Thanks for creating your budget decks! I built the bomb hunter a few weeks ago and climbed to rank 7. I was able to craft Zilliax and shot up to 5. The silence priest looks like a lot of fun but I'm saving what little dust I have left until Uldum.
---
Any thoughts on the best substitution for Zilliax? I subbed Zilliax for a Bronze Gatekeeper, but I'm not sure if it wouldn't be better to trade out a Whirlglider instead. I feel like my Whirlgliders end up trading down a lot while the Bronze Gatekeeper has more sticking power and the ability to protect a more valuable target.
---
Very 420 of you
---
 \&gt; 55% wr in 100 games is more stars than 60% in 50. 
---
10 stars in both cases, actually.
---
What an odd interaction. I wonder if there's a limitation to the way hearthstone is coded or if they did it to just nerf the combo, although it doesnt really nerf it. Thanks for the info though everyone! :)
---
I

C
---
E
---
I feel like silence priest is a much lower skill cap deck than mech priest is. I might be wrong on this though, but ladder stats for mech priest are definitely gonna be a lot worse than the decks potential winrate. Even with 250 games of experience, I still rope a ton of my turns with it.
---
Yeah...that would be...so pathetic.  Not something I would ever do.

*cough*

Congrats on your shiny new Golden cards!
---
Turns out the legendary quests actually wait until you have a slot free and while you can complete one every day as soon as it refreshes, you won't be missing out on any of them. I completed one from two days ago and once I completed these older quests they were immediately replaced by the next ones.
---
My guess is that it has Rush instead of Taunt
---
Why so defensive?
---
Good to know that there will be singleplayer adventure content if they said that in that way.
---
She looks like you just offended her AND her family
---
Well. it seems that I'm up for a second round of negative karma, I will just say that 3 is far too low of a cost for a mass hard removal that automatically wins against board focused non-aggro decks. That's why I found the balance baffling. But I guess it's ok because fuck Priest am I right?. That said, I my critics goes towards Blizzard not you. You were just having fun making custom cards, but honestly this card is a mistake in it's current form. I will be saving the copies of this one.

I've got a soft spot for "Danny Don't you Know"

---
Hello there Internet Explorer
---
Pick a good deck you like (I played hooktusk rogue to rank 5, then mech hunter to legend). Do not change decks unless your last 20 games win rate is sub 40%.  It can take a very long time it takes 25 more wins than losses to reach legend from 5. So, with a 55% win rate that is 250 games, with a 60% win rate it‚Äôs 125 games. With a 70% win rate it‚Äôs 63 games. So, it‚Äôs going to be a grind, unless you get a high win rate.
---
Then hows she meant to fit that thing on Rafams big dong
---
I‚Äôve done it a couple times and I work 50 hours a week. Not terrible if you started the season at 4.
---
Bro I'm not attacking you, no need to be defensive. You asked a question and I gave my answer. Also, you spoke in just as absolute terms as I did. You know as well as I do that I was speaking my opinion and not the word of god.
---
I remember knowing this back in Gadgetzan, I think.
---
Flappiest bird: If this attacks the enemy hero become immune
---
They aren't saying you are wrong to call yourself an arena player, they are saying you didn't just "try ONE game of ranked" because if you did, you would have been decayed to rank 20, not 14.
---
This could be much better to a deck than pyro/equality.  You could clear your opponents board and buff your own by transforming all your totems/tokens/trash iinto murlocs that could end up being great or could get buffed by warleader next turn.   Is the card combo to strong?  Probably not, but we'll have to see how it plays out because there IS potential for it to blow out a game
---
Windows10 has an uninstall option for it, but stand along exe files normally aren't seen in the control center to uninstall. It has to make changes to the reg because after I delete it and download another and start it just pops up with my old settings again. No logging in.
---
Just up the cost of Venomizer to 5 mana. It‚Äôs slows it down considerably but with Galavnzier is still possible.
---
Plus with the way the card is designed it‚Äôs essentially the same as Assassinate or Vile Brood Skitterer.
---
&gt; Is it just me or do the spoilers seem extremely slow for this expansion. I remember for ROS they were releasing good chunks everday, but for this, I maybe see 1 oe 2 cards every few days it is kind of frustrating haha.
---
It's exactly the same as EVERY exp before. Between announcement and reveal period, there is a time with only a few cards per day.    
---
&gt; Also, Shaman has like half of its cards revealed while some classes like Hunter have none. What is up with that? I log on yesterday and see yet another shaman card (Plague of Murlocs) revealed, and there has been nothing else spoiled since!    
---
Same, this  happen with every exp where some class got more reveal than others. it balance over time.
---
If you conjurer an eight drop can you get Ragnaros the Firelord? Asking because it's not a playable card but it can be summoned through Jan'Alai.
---
I AM MURLOC! *Shreds
---
Cringe comment. Do you have a Brain?
---
Ok :). It just felt longer than usual haha! They should hopefully starting rolling in more spoilers soon :D.
---
it begins to roll much often starting friday/monday, don't worry.
---
What exactly is the great achievement to them? For pretty much all of them you either just got to rank 20, went to some event, bought a collector‚Äôs edition in a game, or played the game on a specific device.
---
The closest ones to achievements are the Legend cars back (which plenty of people are insistent just takes a meta deck and enough time), or the ones for heroic adventures (which I can personally say just takes a decent sized collection to do with how bad the AI is).
---
iirc u/toilet_drake_hs maintains that but he recently made a tft itemizer tool which just got completed so i'm sure he'll update that visual guide soon.
---
Say that to GMs PepeHands
---
shiet, i'd be stoked to watch hitler's card reaveal
---
Wonder if anyone has done this with the same deck in both standard and wild
---
It is good to be da king.
---
Plenty of people do that lmao. Not everyone wants to stick around on it for too long at a time cause some quests can take a 3 to 4 games even if you try to stall them. I'll do like 20 to 30% of the annoying ones and leave it to double up the next day or even the day after. 
---
Anticipation for the new expansion also drives people to do their dailies and log out till they actually have time to spend playing.
