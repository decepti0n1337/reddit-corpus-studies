Honestly I have no clue, there's a reason why I'm not a contributor in r/customhearthstone and it's not because I dislike the subreddit

CCG.  I'd imagine Poker beats it a million to 1.

And backstab from every tempo rogue (I play it, so I would know).

That‚Äôs ok, control warrior always has eternium rover on turn one, same principle
---
You didn't save a single brawl? some warriors do take Nomi.
---
If you play wild: yes.
---
Do you like to keep collection: yes.
---
I reckon those are the reasons to keep the wild cards.

I seen ControlTheBoard do that.

He usually plays wild, but played some standard tournament the other day with rogue that included wisps.

I had one. Brawled the first board. Could not handle the second.

Lol right? I only get the urge to play Hearthstone on my phone once every two weeks or so, and I open up the app to find this. And then I'm done. My motivation is shot.

I'm sorry to hear that,but I think everyone has to face bad match-ups if they want to climb the ladder quickly.
---
I got to rank 4 with tempo rogue,mech hunter,secret hunter and aggro/miracle mage and there were times where I had only bad match-ups
---

Nope. You're remembering how it used to be. Like you noticed, they removed the quality options and the "high quality" art is now significantly lower resolution than it once was.

Anyone know the price of the new solo adventure?

---
Nice!

I just hit rank 2. I thought that 77% winrate was just a lucky streak and would drop down, but I actually raised it to 81%, before losing a game to mechathun. Was such a close game too, the guy had nothing left but bombs on his deck, drew 5 in a row by that got him to 5hp, and he killed me.
---
So farm I'm 21/6 for 78% winrate in rank5+ (I always reset my stats when I hit rank 5, as to have more accurate stats without the rank 6-8 stuff).
---
Why did toast think it made sense? I didn't understand his reasoning.

Actually ya. I find that at ranks 15, 10, or 5 more people are willing to have fun and are much less serious about the game, it‚Äôs nice. Sometimes I sit at rank 5 and play concede druid to help people climb to 5 so they can join in the brewing fun. It‚Äôs just nice to have an environment where you can be competitive and yet brew.

Also not going to get you sources right now cause I‚Äôm still on mobile, but remind me later if you really want them I guess?
---
Why would you ever play this in arena lol you aren‚Äôt disrupting any combos
---
Thanks!
---
It originally didn't summon anything. People kept using it on their 10-cost minions and then whining on the bug forums when it didn't work. Eventually Blizzard gave in and changed it, sacrificing consistency for intuitiveness.
---
Smh just boil a tree. Much easier TBH
---
This is one of those wonderful things where you can't tell its a spoiler unless you're already been spoiled.
---
Arena is the most efficient use of your gold in exchange for cards. I think you're better off with a 3-win average than buying packs directly. The downside that it is rather time intensive.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I haven‚Äôt played arena in ages cause I‚Äôm bored of it, and I suspect there‚Äôs a lot of people like me.  Buying arena runs for $1,99 is also probably not the best way to spend money on card packs.
---
I'm at Rank 3 with Control Shaman right now. Rogue and Hunter decks seem rather even for me, even favoring me at times, honestly. Warrior just comes down to the draw; if you draw Hagatha before they draw Boom, you can take it, but if it's the other way around, you're going to have issues.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Except Bomb Warrior. You just lose to Bomb Warrior.
---
What do you mean money, hearthstone is P E R F E C T L Y  F R E E.
---
Some do, but there's also people who play all sorts of other things. Wild is incredibly diverse, other than 4-L, and you never quite know what to expect from each opponent. Players are on average better at lower ranks, but their decks run the gamut in design and strategy far more than Standard could ever imagine.
---
Unless you want to go for Legend, the degenerate decks in Wild aren't really that big of a problem.
---
Aka hope they don't run silence, sap, poly, hex, etc.
---
Wild token druid can't afford to play a card as slow as spreading plague.
---
Like the slowest card they run is living mana, and even that card isn't included in some builds
---
[here's an example](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/%E7%94%9F%E8%80%8C%E7%8B%82%E9%87%8E%E6%97%A0%E5%BF%83s-1-legend-aggro-druid/)
---
Yeah it makes ladder a way more enjoyable experience. Even when you do want to keep climbing, ranked floors are a really cool break from the grind that allows you to have some fun until you're ready to go for the next milestone.
---
This is among the worst tavern brawls they have ever made. Nothing but fucking Voodoo and Dr Boom. Not fun in the slightest
---
Bored. Playing someone else's deck against some else's deck.
---
I‚Äôm not that guy but since it‚Äôs been hours I‚Äôll try to help. I think when he says has ‚Äútoo few outs‚Äù, he means the class is lacking in means to ‚Äúget out of trouble‚Äù consistently.
---
You're telling me that at rank 15 you can't lose stars? God damn it. I was at 16 and decided to swap to a hero I'd never played before and lost all my ranks back to 20.
---
Absolutely taken down
---
Yogg plays free from Amber which summons mechathun. Then yogg plays void contract twice (or Myra's unstable element) then plays cataclysm. EZ lethal.
---
&gt; At rank 2 I see big priests unironically coin vargoth against kingsbane with shadow essence at hand.
---
Oh, yeah, I've seen that too, also around rank 2.  I don't really get that play at all.  Like...the scariest thing they do the next turn is like...spirit lash or shadow visions.  Even with midrange decks like Even Warlock/Even shaman I tend to just ignore Vargoth and go face.  Shadow Word Death getting copied onto a second target is a threat, but that's easy to play around.
---
&gt; Even shaman on the other hand just looks to survive to turn 8 and then jams any big boy to board and heals for a shit ton. Fountain even shaman is a deck made because someone was too bad of a hearthstone player to play regular even shaman (already a pretty easy deck to play in wild) and made its matchups even more polarized.
---
Eh.  Like...I've played three or four varieties of Even Shaman in wild.
---
I literally innovated my own version of Even Shaman day 1 of the Witchwood, ignored Standard.  I was running like Haunted Creepers and Nerubian Eggs with Flametongue Totem.  It obviously wasn't optimal, since once the community as a whole tuned it, they went for the 4 mana 7/7 instead of trying to set up combos, but it was good enough to climb up to rank 3 or so from rank 20.
---
The 4 mana 7/7 version is functional obviously.  TBH, I haven't played it very much, cause if I want to just jam a 7/7 or 8/8 on turn 4, I'll play Even Warlock.
---
The Corpsetaker Walking Fountain version I wanted to try just because it looked different.  Does it have more polarized matchups?  Maybe in terms of having a weaker matchup to like Darkest Hour Warlock and big priest.  But in terms of its matchup chart it also feels very advantaged against Odd Paladin, whereas the old Even Shaman with 4 mana 7/7 has a really bad matchup against Odd Paladin since they previously tried to lean purely on maelstrom portal and now Never Surrender kind-of bricks that.  Also, having bigger stuff and Hagatha means having a long game value plan against stuff like quest reno priest (although I don't see that matchup often enough to say whether its more or less favoured than the 4 mana 7/7 version of Even Shaman).
---
Like...yeah, it is true that the walking fountain version is weaker against combo decks, but on the other hand it feels like it's a pretty solid all around anti-aggro deck, unlike the 4/7/7 version of Even Shaman which has some good matchups against aggro and some really bad matchups against aggro.
---
(TBH, though, the real reason I recommended the corpsetaker version is that this person has not built a wild deck before, and the corpsetaker version uses a ton of cards that were in the standard version of Even Shaman, so probably requires a lot less crafts for them.  That, and I've been finding it pretty fun lately, although that might just be the novelty factor.  Either that or it's possible my definition of fun lines up a lot with wrecking Odd Paladins).
---
He sure is. üòç

Oh, I don't think so.

Rank floors are the single greatest thing they‚Äôve done for the game in ages. Love getting to 5 -never doing that legend grind ever again- and just fooling around üòÑ

Nope, that's from "world of roguecraft" though. It was pretty entertaining at the time. May be worth watching now.

Have the spectate a friend win a game quest that gives a pack.

Mages are 1-4 and you don't know if they're Conjurer, Miracle or Freeze for the first 5 turns. Legend is where the priests are with their Nomi nonsense
---
Pls no, dont make this trend
---
The reconnecting to games feature is my favorite part. The one where you finally reconnect and its been two turns.
---
Then spend like $50 a few times a year.
---
Ohhh ok yeah I agree with that then yes. They absolutely shouldn't get to attack once magnetized unless a turns already passed with the original minion.
---
Patch incoming..
---
Hunter has an insane win rate against warrior. If warriors start to drop out of the meta, hunter loses some of its strength.
---
Secret hunter fuck them all
---
1. Yes it is common to main one class especially for new players. Also you have khadgar and kalecgos so you definitely have good legendary cards for mage and going for that is good.
---
2. Khadgar is fantastic in summoner mage and kalecgos is a great addition in any mage deck so considering your collection i would advise you to craft two [conjurer's calling] and play that deck.
---
It is a very fun to play deck. What you want is minions which have powerful battlcry effects which usually have low stats for the mana cost, then use conjurer's calling on them to get value. If khadgar is on board you get twice the value.
---
One simple example of this would be using [former champ]. This is a 1/1 that summons a 5/5 as its battlecry. Then use conjurer's calling on the 1/1 body to get two more 5 mana minions which are 5/5 on average. So that is a 8 mana 15/15 turn which is quite good.
---
Keep in mind that if you have khadgar on board while playing former champ it will summon two 5/5 and then using conjurer's calling will give you four five cost minions. So khadgar + former champ + conjurer's calling is an insane turn 10 3 card combo that effectively fills your board with 5/5 minions.
---
This combo is hard to pull of as it requires 3 cards and 10 mana, but my point is that make decks around powerful turns like this and you should do better. Khadgar also combos with power of creation so on turn 10 you can basically get four 6/6 minions on average. Turn 10 24/24 in stats is also nothing to scoff at.
---
I would advise you to remove both astral rifts and craft two conjurer's calling to add into your deck. Also see which cards would combo with khadgar (summoning minions) or conjurer's (high value low stat minions) and craft them if possible to make a deck revolving around that.
---
If you have any other questions feel free to send me a message :)
---
Hunter has an insane WR against warrior. If warrior drops down a bit, hunter loses some of its power.
---
No lol its win rate against every other deck is above 50% except two zoo decks and I think control shaman. Most rates are 55 plus...
---
Scale hide is really a key card in the matchup. Run 2 of them and try to hit dire frenzy on it. Rogue will be running sap so you want high-tempo cards with immediate board impact.
---
Amen, worst thing I've played and is literally one more push off this game for life. Have not spent money since The Grand Tournament and can safely stand by my decision.
---
I'm on a shitty android, but art looks the same.
---
Oh. My bad.
---
On the other hand, this guy is using rank 2 data to argue over what is competitive or not. 
---
Or maybe not. Maybe his contribution to this thread is really just that he wanted us to know that he played against three druids in a row and there is nothing more to his comment to insinuate. 
---
Yup.
---
I think that in order to balance this interaction the stats should be lowered to 7/7 instead of 7/8 and you should probably get rid of the taunt too.
---
Oh yeah I missed that. If you had 2 then it won't work you'll always have a copy in hand
---
Oooohhhh. I thought it was a bug. Turns out it's a feature! But, do they have to show it off in 2/3 of my games?
---
Let‚Äôs blow this rocket up!
---
They said it was paid when they announced the expansion
---
Yeah, wasn't Firebat. It was Wot from Asia.
---
Secret hunter is the deck that beats almost everything. The other hunter decks aren‚Äôt nearly as strong.

Started the game a week ago having lots of fun started with token druid and I grinded to rank 15. Had a lot of spare dusts (I used to log in a few times a year to get some free packs in case i d play the game one day) so i crafted midrange hunter with zuljin too (thank you golden nomi&lt;3).
---
My problem is: i completely suck with hunter lol. Understanding token was pretty easy tbh: get 4 or 5 minions on the board, buff them twice and get lethal. But with midrange i have no idea on how to win games with it. Id really like some little tips on how to play around it if you guys have some
---
Thanks

Added you

---
Thedayspider#2156
---
I gotta say... I absolutely love this deck! Anyone that wants a challenging but refreshing deck to play that's not Warrior or Rogue should try this deck.
---
So, this all started when...
---
My opp tempos out a Girl early in the game, I forgo clearing it (with Coin Zil) in favor of developing a big Adv on T4 with Coin Girl into shenanigans.
---
T5 my opp plays Giant + Conj (with his Girl still on board).
---
Chaos ensues for several turns in a row, in which we have a freeze war and continually freeze each other's most threatening minions.
---
T9 things are looking grim as I face likely lethal, but a big Conj on Sea Giant twice produces a Boom Reaver on the final try allowing me to Magnetize it with my Zilliax for life gain I needed to stay alive and stabilize the board. My opp clears the big Boom but doesn't have the answer to my Adv (who still hasn't swung once!) and concedes resulting in the above pic.
---
I think it does actually, that may have been my failed mecha‚Äôthun attempt.
---
I‚Äôm F2P tho...
---
Of course +2 health to your minions is almost always strictly beneficial, but it can easily trigger when you've only got, for example, one or two 1/1's out, and that's generally not worth a 1 mana card. Just like getting a 1-drop from a Mirror Entity is better than no 1-drop, but that doesn't mean you ever want a 1-drop from your 3 mana spell.
---
Whoa I asked this same question a few hours ago, are we twins ?
---
&gt;And to the people who bitch about having to pay for it... well, you don't have to.
---
They've gone more than a year with free PvE and an expansion alongside it. Now not only are we required to pay for the PvE again but the rewards are also rather lackluster and we also have to still buy packs for the expansion. Yeah, the solo content might be good and worth the gold but people are well entitled to bitch that they are losing out on huge part of it that they would have otherwise gotten for free and, if nothing else, it's very greedy on Blizzards part.
---
And anomaly mode for extra replay value

puresin#2558 NA 80g quest trade.  I show you mine, you go first.
---
Will update when completed.
---
Wot?
---
whispering wood is a bit strange to put in there since it's used in Token druid decks which hardly fits the  "does nothing" style.
---
I'm looking forward to chapter 5. 12 stages rather than 8 is going to allow for some absolute absurdity at the end. We'll probably go head-to-head with parts of the council.
---
Having one book that draws 3 minions on the coin lets you play a turn 3 giant.  Having one book that draws 3 minions off the coin lets you play a 3 mana giant on turn 4.  You can also chose to save the giant and use it with conj at 6 mana or 5 with the coin.  Even without book you can get off an early giant combo with ai and sandbinder or some mana cyclone shenanigans.  Edwin is also a problem card so I don't consider that a counter point.
---
Wish people would stop comparing buying packs with buying a single player solo adventure. If you value 28 packs that much, buy the 28 packs and move on.
---
You‚Äôre not being forced into buying it (it doesn‚Äôt give set cards like the previous paid expansions did) so you wouldn‚Äôt really be missing out on anything. Except you know, the content itself, which you don‚Äôt seem to value as much as card packs. So there‚Äôs that?
---
Mage and priest in arena currently are the two dumbest playstyles. Mage decks pretty much center around highrolling with conjurers calling, most common scenario being dropping a faceless summoner and if it lives playing conjurers calling on it, rng fiesta.
---
Priest is just a case of curving out and playing one overstatted minion after another, and if you are a really good player you just kabal talonpriest on 3 and increase your winrate by lets say 50%.
---
Rogue already got a nerf and did not need another one, warlock only needed the abyssal offering rate to be halved. Druid, paladin and warrior did need to be buffed.
---
This is a personal opinion but most arena decks you are offered are just plain boring to play, and buffing mage and priest is going to make this all just worse. Guess the wait for the next rotation is on.
---
"Take Dalaran" ? OK !   and absolutly nothing will go wrong...
---
I see your argument but I don‚Äôt see why anyone would want to make such an unreliable deck even worse. I tried to make this deck work so hard. Multiple deck lists and so many games. When you win you win hard but you don‚Äôt draw the win hard cards all that often. Maybe I am just garbage but I swapped to big shaman and win streaked my way to rank 5. Had a quest to win 3 as mage yesterday so I tried it again. After 5 hard losses in a row (one game I even got turn 3 giant turn 4 conjures but mass hysteria deleted it all) I gave up lmao.
---
I understand how bad it feels to lose to this deck when they draw the nuts but for the most part this deck feels so garbage.
---
I'm so fucking baffled why Blizzard cannot give in game patch notes for mobile players. I feel like I high rolled when I happen to catch a post like this on here as I dont visit this sub daily.
---
Technically I played autocomplete deck at the beginning and when I started to get packs every 5 ranks, I got Edwinn and build around it.
---
At rank 25 is when I started to have a decent deck with those 11free packs. I played tempo rogue
---
The former are probably decks from when Token and Zoo were running amock. Other builds are probably better.
---

Rogues sapping your battlecry less 10 drop twice is gonna be hard to sustain through lol. Then again playing a combo deck that has to get till fatigue seems almost impossible in the first place in that mu
---
Yeah its easy im just saying the combo as of now doesnt work and itll be a shame if he misses lethel because of it
---
It depends. Personally I only play wild for fun old combos. Such as control reno shaman. But then again recently I dusted all my wild decks save for 3. Token paladin and Baku warrior as well.
---
I still find the Boomship the most consistent, you can even pull wins without the combo.
---
They are milking their paypigges (I guess pay-whales in this case) for all they got. Need to show those investors hearthstone has some of the dumbest whales in existence to please the Actibli$$ shareholders.
---
Dog was playing mechathun shaman in top 10 legend consistently. There is still room for innovation.
---
\&gt;  And I could pretty consistently beat even the slowest mid-range hunters with cw 
---
These days midrange hunter plays two dire frenzies on tundra rhino and another cheap minion (say, the 1 mana wolf), then Zuljin into two more dire frenzies. Tnen you either grind out the control warrior with. multiple oversized threats or otk him with frenzied rhino, wolf and other minions.
---
As a control warrior, midrange hunter is the most hopeless of all matchups in this meta.
---
He's not the most important card 
---
Viscious syndicate reported that he already get cut again in the mech hunter deck.
---
im playing her in my secret hunter deck, shes kinda useful.
---
And the 5 mana cost guy that destroys mechs. Florist hitting any of those = win. Floop is another option.
---
I got a quest to trade
---
Will add you now
---
And then you draw mechathun early and you're sad.
---
also if you have tracking, try playing on the turn before a big card, turn 4 to scout for thundering rhino, turn 5 for highmane. i also geneeraly don't use tracking unless i am really searching for something and the situation is looking dire..
---
sometimes i like to do vicious scale hide +  dire frenzy, tracking, buffed scale hide. that's 9 mana you get 8 hp back
---
You too have high blood pressure when playing Arena?
---
I cannot play more than 3 games in a row before I have to do a break.

Why don't people just run inner rage + execute for the warrior combo? Then it just requires 2 galvanizers.
---
Well yeah you could theoretically keep track of everything yourself but no one wants to do that. The same thing could be said about every other game that keeps track of your stats like league or csgo or overwatch
---
Depends. If you're Boom, that 10-drop has Rush, so even if they Sap it, you still kill something immediately. Which is now a much lower tempo loss.
---
Plus, if you're playing against Rogue, you rarely have to rely on your Mecha'thun to win. You just outcontrol them.
---
Also Mages don't play Polymorph right now.
---
Ugh, that highroll is tilting
---
I wonder, if they ever decided to go physical card game... how the game can handle "discover" or any other random card mechanics....

I hate it when they concede before you can finish the last attack. Especially if you are finishing with a wide board.

If you‚Äôre gonna concede, do it at the end of your own damn turn.

A 10 mana assassinate? Besides what are you gonna kill - evil miscreant? By turn 10 their entire dmg comes from hand.

And yeah I agree it‚Äôs not your win condition - I just wanted to add to cards that troll the undertaker combo

When you duel you can use your opponents saved decks (if they give permission).

That's 109 gold per day. To get that much you have to play (and win!) quite a lot of matches. Surely possible with fast decks, but it is fair to call it rather grindy I'd say.

Shudderwock plays the undatakah battlecry, gains the armored beetle deathrattle as well as the "summon a 0/3 for your opponent" one. Then doppelgangster battlecry summons two copies of shudderwock, which also have the deathrattle. Then grumble returns the copies to your hand, which already is full, so the copies die and the deathrattles trigger.

Wow!

There are about 104 2-mana minions in standard, so the sequence of getting a Faceless Lackey into Lorewalker Cho is 1/416 = ~0.24%. Beyond that, it would depend what turn you played the Cable Rat, whether you were on the coin, what you were mulliganing for, and the play rate for Priest yesterday at your rank.

Still costs gold to unlock, so there's still a cost to getting Zayle

I‚Äôm 4 mana

Yes

My theory would be that you'd face both extremes of the spectrum. But again, probably just bad luck.
---
The only things I consider BM is roping every turn and not killing an opponent when you know you have lethal. Emotes could he annoying but you can just squelch them.

Its GOLD, Jerry, GOLD!!!

##Getting Started To Hearthstone Tips
---
1.  First, all this information and more can be found in the [Reddit Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bisn5q/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_dragon/).
---
2. The best way to get gold is just finishing Daily Quests. (Always re-roll 50g quests)
---
3.  Get all the classes to Level 10 and beat all the Expert AI bosses.  Jump into Ranked as soon as possible (Casual mode is locked until you are Rank 25.)  Don't worry, Ranks 50-26 is a one time climb and you'll get 16 packs for it.
---
4. Also, get one class to Level 20 to unlock Tavern Brawls which get you 1 free Classic pack per week. (Wed-Sun)
---
6. There are also special promotions still active that get you free packs in the game.  You can even use an emulator to knock them all out quickly. (*Use Google*). (Play a game on iPad, iPhone, Android Tablet, Android Phone, and Samsung Galaxy phones)
---
7.  Open single packs in each set until you unlock a Legendary.  In your first 10 packs of a set you are guaranteed a legendary whereas the normal drop rate is 1/20.  
---
10. Aim to get 5 Ranked wins each month for the free cardback and rewards.  The best rewards are at 20,15,10, and 5 so these ranks are important.  (Compared to Rank 5, Legend is only +45 dust)
---
11.  Buying in bulk is usually best.  If in doubt, focus on Classic (will always be good in Standard) and sets released in the current year.  Right now that is Rise of Shadows and sets released in August and December in 2019.
---
12. For older PvE content, you [have to go to the Blizzard store and unlock it for free](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ay645h/hearthstone_developer_ama_year_of_the_dragon/ei1e3al/).  You only get cardbacks but if you want help on the solo player content you can find it here:  [Kobolds and Catacombs Dungeon Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7qtrt9/noblords_guide_to_dungeon_runs/), [The Witchwood Monster Hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8ff4wy/monster_hunt_overview_and_monster_hunter_guides/), [The Boomsday Puzzle Labs](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/puzzle-lab-guide-release-date-experiments-card-back/) or the [Rastakahn Rumble Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/a8ddw7/guide_to_rumble_run/).
---
13. If you play Arena, you can get drafting help with [HearthArena](http://www.heartharena.com/) or [Lightforge](http://thelightforge.com/tierlist).  You can also find the ["Rewards Table"](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Arena#Table) here.
---
14.  If you go to the Blizzard online store, you can purchase some Wild Adventures for free and get a free Death Knight with Knights of the Frozen Throne's Prologue.  Can't be done in client an available next patch. [\(Knights of the Frozen Throne F2P Guide by TommyJTheGamer\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6sydke/im_the_guy_who_did_the_mostly_free_to_playbasic/)
---
Here are some basic decks you can start out with.  The free decks only require you to level the hero to Level 10 and the Budget decks require about 800-1600 dust to craft certain cards. [(full thread on Budget Decks)](http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/hearthstone-budget-cheap-decks/) For the strongest ladder decks, visit [Vicious Syndicate's "Meta Report](https://data-reaper-report.vicioussyndicate.com) each week.

Just use Elven Archer for Pally
---
Then your left with a 1/1 guy
---
Out of curiosity, did you get it back?  I don't think you would but just wondering.
---
Right now, Bomb Warrior but it depends on your local meta.  Midrange Hunter will beat all the slower and more Midrange decks more consistently.  But lose to the faster Aggro decks.
---
Even if it had fucking 100% winrate it would still take u a thousand years to climb

---
Perfect. Thanks for the good news. I‚Äôll keep my eyes open for the announcement.
---
No, but I think people naturally gravitate towards 1 or 2 classes.  The only thing that matters is getting one class to Level 20 so you unlock Tavern Brawls.  After that, play what you like.
---
And this is our neck of de woods druid is bad
---
It's an Omega card.  Most Omega cards are super powerful at 10 mana and "meh" anytime else.  While it synergizes really well with the Control Warrior package and Dr. Boom, most times it is "unplayable" until 10 unless you are in an Aggro matchup.  It is on par with the other "Discover a random card" effects that other classes have, just an Omega effect on the backend.
---
The ranking system matches you up against an equally skilled player so don‚Äôt be scared!
---
16th if you never checked.

How many whizbang decks are there?
---
Well of course they‚Äôre going to rope you when you‚Äôre playing such a op deck like discard warlock and they‚Äôre just playing meme decks like control warrior /s.
---
This might not count since I was the one playing the dumb deck, but before the rank floors were added I queued into a rank 5 game with ancient one rogue and beat a zoolock player because they had no removal for it in their deck. 
---
Another time I was playing cubelock and I had teched the darkness against jade druid. It was a rank 2 or 3 game and he managed to get all the way up to a 30/30, but I had so many resurrected taunts he never got through. He drew the last candle and I beat him with the 20/20.
---
I run a hybrid midrange secret hunter with 2x scale hide 2x frency, 2x rat trap 2x snakes and 2x hyena it does very well vs rogue
---
How many hour are in school ?
---
Why arent you guys on battlefy? You would have much more visibility there, also generally better UI and not as easy to cheat on there.
---
ur too skilled for us peasants bro
---
I think boom is better, a lot of the time I curve out regardless, and it punishes trading.
---
I miss the days when he was in every single deck I make.
---
The only thing that comes to mind is the Lich King. A staple for almost any deck that wants to go long. I think zill beats the king when it comes to inclusion tho.
---
Many buff cards actually go by the same stat reduction. Blessing of Kings is 4/4 in stats, because it can be used ad burst.
---
PRECISION.
---
Fair but being able to beat someone down with infinite chargers is a ton of pressure. Worst form of aggro, just curving out chargers and destroying them. Really efficient.
---
Bruh you literally just made it the simplest form of each combo. There is such a thing as style. Also, many of these combos would be basically impossible to pull off on ladder, especially with shaman
---
2 for each class. It‚Äôs the premise decks not including classic.
---
I just answered OP's question. Why are people getting upset?
---
Maybe try playing a deck with a win condition?
---
Running opponents out of resources is just as much a win condition as any other.
---
Amgam is Magma backwards
---
It's the most demoralizing deck to play against that I've ever faced. Even when I can win I just concede to save myself the sanity.

wtf even is hearthstone right now.

Alright i think im wasting your time
---
Yeah, I do this too, I don‚Äôt have time for showboating. If the opponent has played well, I‚Äôll give them the chance to complete their win. 
---
If they want to start swaning around showing their hand... that‚Äôs a ‚Äòno thanks, g‚Äôbye‚Äô from me.
---
This is why you play Reno decks in wild ;)
---
Twinspell triggers after the deathrattle resolves. You can actually trigger Mecha'Thun with Conjurers Calling despite it placing a card in your hand and two minions on the board afterwards.
---
I faced a druid whose deck was *nothing* but taunt minions. Literally 30 cards of pure taunt. And I was running a tempo mage deck....

---
Shouldn't have played Warrior.
---
you should check out my man masonsteelgaming he is an awesome streamer/youtuber. Viewerbase isnt that large but all he makes is homebrew decks and plays standard and wild. worth checking out if you are looking for content
---
 In case anybody want this tees.
---
cannot deny that this is one of my favorite cards for that line
---
Also I usually wait a bit longer into the expansion before i start making wild decks again. Just want to exhaust my ideas for standard before bringing ideas to wild
---
Leeeeeeerrrrrroooooyyyyyyy Jeeeeeennnnnkkkkiiiinnnnnnnnsssss!
---
HAAALLL OOOF FAAAAAAAAME!
---
Exactly
---
Ah yes, it's always aggro meta according to Reddit.
---
Warrior is indeed boring to play against but, but I still love smashing their face with my massive pick only to have them add me afterwards.
---
This happened to me once and it was the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me in Hearthstone.
---
Giving a Rogue 10 cards on turn 6 is not necessarily game over for the Rogue, though.
---
Nope.
---
Key classic cards are better crafted.
---
The pool is just too big. The good classic cards that I actually use I crafted myself.
---
Every time they play hecklebot it pulls a 2 drop too.
---
UNITY.
---
With 29 health as warrior, it's might as well gg since rogue can't pull off that much damage consistently with 7 mana. He also have a few removals (no brawl tho)
---
Personally i dusted my 3 least favourite classes but kept almost all legendarys. If you have a couple of classes where you tend to craft more cards i would hang on to their wild set just in case. I would dust most golden cards regardless.
---
5 mana 5/5 is bad in the sense it's never a card you would put in your deck on it's own. Yeti never sees play either.
---
well done son
---
PRIMITIVE!

---
Did he concede?
---
i never understood why the scarlet crusade were bad guys. what did they do that made them enemies of the alliance? theyre fighting undead shouldnt they be friends? the horde obviously i get why but the alliance it seems like the only reason is so the horde didnt get a instance all to themselves

I think it was

Love the fallen guardian, im all for any shadowform support. Also love pepe.

Maybe remove the elemental tag and rename it? I‚Äôm not sure what name they should rename it too, but the tag change definitely balances it

---
An odd warrior With even cost cards in his deck, coined armor up on turn 1, and still played Baku on turn 9
---
nope lorewalker and other similar spells only work on "played" spells not casted spells, its like battlecries have no effect from dirty rat or that new mech that pulls one out of the deck.
---
Whoever writes these please stop. None of these cards need a nerf, and the only reason people are complaining about these cards are because all the actual strong cards rotated out and blizzard refuses to print cards that are better than these or are good enough to counter these
---
Kel thuzad has stopped me from getting 12 wins more times than my depression can share.

I thought maybe give it one less attack cuz a one durability weapon is kinda weird
---
It's spelled
---
#RAFAAAAAAAM
---
Which do you recommend?  Shield slam?  Undataka?
---
I think that prep as a 0 mana combo activator is ok. Maybe make it only discount by 2, or work with low cost spells only, as said would be best.
---
The bomb damage I totally agree.  5 damage was fine when there was only 1 card that shuffled it, but now there are many
---
Yeah I'd consider that BM. Like if you've lost you lost, I don't need to see how close it was. I always think to myself, would this be ok in a real life sports match and if you went up to the opponent who beat you and went "well to be fair I nearly won that game so don't think it was that good a victory" that would be considered really bad sportsmanship and I have the same view in the game.
---
Obviously people will disagree (literally the whole point of the thread is disagreement which is awesome) but I definitely don't like it when someone else plays a load of cards and then doesn't let me do the same. If they play all their cards and then let me do the same then I'm happy there, fairness on both sides.
---
Isn‚Äôt that their point though? If you just want to play the content you have to pay for other content you may not want. Sure blizzard makes more money this way but it also makes the is it worth it calculation unfavorable to the content. People buy content every day for a price above free, the question is would the content be received better if it wasn‚Äôt saddled with an additional irrelevant cost. I think the answer is maybe, people like rewards so this allows them to fake rewards for a while but the forced packs purchase makes the ‚Äúits a card game‚Äù premium loom large when comparing to other content options.
---
The only thing the SSD does is allow things to load faster. It doesn't improve his fps. I had no issue with my gaming pc that only had a hard drive expect the longer load times.
---
I‚Äôve had this done to me multiple times from the Rogue side and I won all of those games. Drawing all those cards for free is still really good most of the time even if it puts you into fatigue.
---
you cant read?
---
&gt;It normally don't affect gaming much (fps wise) but it lower the loading time significantly
---
As I said to the other person I count that as BM. You wouldn't go up to another team in a sports game and say "Yeah you won but I was really close to winning so don't think it was that good a victory". I have the same view in hearthstone.
---
Again, if they want to play out all their cards when they cannot win at least let me play out all my cards to, only fair.
---
Battlecry: discover a legendary mage minion
---
~~He's talking about his fps issue, not loading times. That's why I commented.~~
---
Misread the comment parent.
---
i honestly think hearthstone is too simple for this to be a problem. ive heard people say it before but i just cant personally feel it. by design this game is really simple.
---
I'm not an expert, but shield slam + galvanizer is an alternative. It's not guaranteed, but in a control mirror you can usually build up some armour anyway.
---
&gt; **As a control player**
---
It'd be more accurate to say as a Fatigue Control Warrior player. There are ways to get around this while playing Control Warrior-like decks by subbing in Brewmaster + Elysiana for Galvanizer + Mechathun (which you then kill w/ Shield Slam), switching Bomb Control Warrior or Dragon Control Warrior, or switching classes to Conjurer Mage or Big Shaman. Elysiana is frustrating if all you want to play are resource control games where you win in fatigue, but there are lots of control decks that don't do that and have a much better time against Control Warrior w/ Elysiana.
---
I got to legend this month with control warrior that ran one galvanizer and mech‚Äôcthun. Simply saved a shield slam. Was 100% against the control mirror. I also ran armor smiths that helped against aggro and also helped regain armor if playing against a bomb warrior. It‚Äôs horrible against mages though, but was strong against almost everything else.
---
Very much agree with Jaraxxus being a winmore card. Would you go with Deathwing? If so how would you build the deck? As aggressive as possible?
---
Honestly boomship version is so nice compared to trying to juggle galvanizers and all that jazz
---
I'd much prefer to hit their shadowsteps, sap or eviscerate to limit their burst potential. However it's a pretty sweet pull after the Rogue has just prep-sprint.
---
Three pixels. Three f-ing pixels.  I doubt the guy even knew what he saw.  He was probably just lookin‚Äô at the picture one day, noticed what looked like a mage on the tv, and went on with his day.
---
Despair
---
Woow thats pretty good
---
HOF Leeroy. That card has been in every aggro deck since the dawn of time
---
Must have a really good gaming chair.
---
Personally, I'd try to focus on cheap minions. Pick up bombs or efficient traders when you can, but you'll get more use out of Rafaam the more often you can use your Hero power, which is harder to do when you're always playing on curve. But I'll freely admit, I'm not an Arena expert or anything, so take that with a grain of salt.
---
I run elysianna with no bounce and have a 70% wr in warrior mirror with bombs. Probably didn't even need elysianna either, you could easily run azelina and be fine. You can also run mechathun
---
Praise be to Big Shaman! Games always last just the right amount of time in Big Land!
---
+1 for this, solid advice. Midrange hunter will definitely not always be the strongest deck, but it will always be playable through every expansion and meta. There's almost always at least one person per expansion who goes to Legend with a deck costing less than 500 dust and there's a reason that's always midrange hunter; you can craft it from a new account without spending a penny. You can upgrade it along the way, but it's a solid choice for a cheap and good deck.
---
Leeroy 4 mana. Now 18 dmg from hand with shadowstep in 1 turn
---
Shhh it's way easier to come here and whine rather than critically think about the decks inherent weakness of running almost no real threats and just answers.
---
Well, Khadgar is no guardian. A guardian has to be empowered by the council of Tirisfal. Khadgar does have Atiesh, but he declined to be a guardian. He certainly is powerful, but not powerful enough to be called a guardian. Remember, Jaina is a lot stronger, especially since she captured the essence of Ra-Den in her staff.
---
I distinctly remember that the other options were even worse. I think it was like Shield bearer and stoneskin gargoyle or some other garbage. At least I could just throw it out on turn 1, lol.
---
I mean yeah, if you dont care about single player, buying single player aint the best move...
---
Yeah that's why I said against warrior, she can't win, everything is gonna be removed and warrior is gonna stack those armour up
---
Just draw them all, duh
---
The reason the packs are so important is because if there were no rewards than the adventure would be worth nothing since we got a great adventure for free in KotFT and it even came with some small rewards. And the adventures before that gave actual specific cards which was great for players who can‚Äôt afford to spend a ton since you can get all the new cards for 25 bucks instead of having to buy a shit ton of packs
---
The nerf in Elysiana is only reasonable to people get a better gameplay in warrior mirror matches. I agree with it. Coin is not a problem and never was - the opposite is true: going first is almost of the time better for tempo and aggro decks; for control the coin doesn‚Äôt matter too much. Evil miscreant is too strong and in fact needs a nerf, but i think being 4 mana is too much - but also playable. And maybe a nerf to 1/3 on stats is too conservative. The fact is: rogue is unbalanced in standard, mostly because of raiding party and evil miscreant. Warrior cards don‚Äôt need a nerf - omega devastator being probably an exception -, since warrior is good on beating rogues and outside of this matchup the class is balanced.

Thanks, that saves me some time.

Pick is a 4 mana pyroblast with a shadowstep attached to it.  It needs to lose 1 or 2 attack.
---
Am I the only one who thinks EVIL Miscreant doesn't need a nerf?
---
This is the point of view I'm astounded by personally. I think comparing it to older adventures and solo content is the problem. Don't think of this as being another copy paste of the Dungeon Run formula like Witchwood and Rumble were. Don't look at this as like the old adventures either (besides KFT) that WERE the expansion of their time, because you got that set's entire card pool from the adventure itself. Look at this new adventure as a standalone, new play mode, specifically played solo. KFT is honestly the biggest outliar here and seemed to be the start of them trying new stuff with their move to things like the KnC content we've been getting. 
---
This is the first big thing HS has had for a while in terms of new play modes, because this last year of solo content has been amazing, but always felt lackluster and had a small amount of replayability, as much as people argue it's infinite, it's really not. I've played well near 500+ runs of Dungeon Run and have gotten similar matchups even when forcing strange or awful deck archetypes several times. 
---
I'd look at this coming up solo content as a new mode people have been wanting for a while. Sure, we've gotten solo content in the past, but this one is meant to blow those out of the water.
---
I hope they gut dr. boom.  The card is so miserable to play against.
---
Agreed, stop playing a control deck with no win condition.
---
And that's the Kilian Experience ‚Ñ¢
