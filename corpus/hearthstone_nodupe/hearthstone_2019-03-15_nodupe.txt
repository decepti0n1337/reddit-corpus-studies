I love the idea, the only problem is that only 3 classes will have hero cards, 3 classes will have huge advantage against the other 6. 
---
---
---
Lol that card will see no play, this is the same reaction as that 6 mana 5/5 Druid beast copy card that saw zero play, 100000% overreaction
---
The one you've linked seems more like a discussion piece as opposed to a low effort post with a  meme though?  
---

---
Imo the post you've made breaches the rules and they are right in removing them but then there is also posts that don't get removed that are equally breaking the rules but it seems once something gets a few upvotes, it stays.  
---
Try posting at a time of day when there are less mods, once you have the upvotes you'll be golden heh.  
---
Lol, the most shameful. I did lose a game because I nerubian unravelered and then tried to coin 2 drop on 7 mana. 
---
I keep getting told I am disconnected from Hearthstone and to restart whenever I click complete my deck. Anyone else?
---
Despite rules it may have, Duplicates are too hard for it to handle. I made a warlock deck with only reno, and the other 28 cards were mostly dupes.
---
This one had some top visuals though.
---
Wall priest does really good in this expansion
---
I know its a throw back to the original but this is still quite possibly the laziest designed card Ive ever seen.  The rest of the set better have some interesting stuff if this is what theyre showing first.
---
"OoOh I can't wait to play as the evil Jamaican voodoo lady"
---
Seems to be coming into Android now finally. 
---
Not strong against priests.
---
I created a deck with just Moorabi and it bricked my phone!
---
I did get Nomi, but then lost the will to live trying to train him. You could only do one quest a day with him! Maybe this is why he burns my food...
---
Oh ok.
---
You said that he who plays it first, wins. You changed it to he who draws it first, wins.
---
You lied when you said you always said the latter and not the former.  Chuck in calling me a cunt, and you are a coward and you have the trifecta for a shit troll.
---
I honestly have no idea how grinder mages with these slow cards will be able to survive without ice block or jaina. They will either get some broken life gain cards this expansion or this is gonna be as dead as Hex Lord Malacrap. 
---
I had 355’ish upvotes in like two hours....do you mean more than that?

---
I'd have to disagree. It'd trash out of the gate. It's comparable to Ysera in that the stat line is the same and it "discovers" from a pool of preset cards. Albeit not a great example. My point is, Ysera is tricky to play because you're unable to directly respond to the previous player's turn and board state; in essence, it's a multi-turn powerplay that leaves you vulnerable and answers very little. Now, with that being relayed, Kalcy does generate a discovery... but with mage's spell pool and the variance factored in with that, the likelihood of the spell being ideal or even useful is slimmer than the hype train here would lead you to believe.
---
A niche card at best in greedy whale decks, little viability in competitive play. 
---
2 out of 5 ice cold milks. 
---
Not strictly, part of the benefit is adding a card to your deck
---
&gt; Barnes Mage
---
First of all, r/whoosh
---
Second of all, It's a joke that Stonehill is commonly seen with Paladin, and it always seems to discover Tarim, Tirion, Lich King, or in some cases all three.
---
I played against you, I'm Forkbeard in the pics (I know - midrange Hunter, gross). I didn't know about the pre-purchase kerfuffle and to say I was baffled when I saw you throw down Darius would be an understatement.
---
You won’t just be facing control though, what I’m saying is this card impacts the board because it acts as a pseudo board clear. Discover a spell in mage means more often than not discovering a board clear. That’s tempo. 4/12 with soft taunt is also tempo. Then if it survives, it’s value. You can play another high cost spell to stabilize or remove something and then play another win condition.
---
It’s tempo, value and card generation in one card. That’s valuable. It’s expensive though and that’s why it would require the correct deck to function. It enables your other win conditions, like a lesser UI 
---
Quick add timey Wimey prefixes to every card! “Greater Temporal Bladestorm” “Time Gamon”
---
Scam is the wrong word but you have a point on inconsistent pricing.  
---
I guess it's just too much effort for them to do anything about it.  
---
As always if you don't like it don't support it?  
---
You're trying to argue that you have 65% winrate without actual stats? LOL
---
You’re right I made a mistake. I admitted to it. In my head they both were he same. You were an outright cunt to me. Please disagre? Now I’m a coward for what admitting my mistakes. Man you have issues. I’m done with this. Get some help
---
I have the same problem on PC with a cable plugged in so no wifi. It happens when I try to find games in Arena and Standard. It sometimes happens while i am in game but most of the time when i search for players the button to cancel goes dark and after a minute it disconnects.

Since the update I can’t seem to play HS on my iPhone X. I logged myself out by playing on my pc, then when I went to switch back, it stops on the launch screen telling me to update the latest version, but there is no later version. I have tried force closing the app, restarting my phone, and reinstalling the application altogether. Any help would be appreciated.
---
Meanwhile Blizzard:
---
 “Do YoU gUyS nOt HaVe PhOnEs?”
---
There is an update now for me for Android
---
Hmm...I was wondering if I just hadn't gotten that change because the mobile update hasn't come out yet...I've gotten the announcement, but when I clicked it the store didn't contain the bundles yet.
---
But I am seeing exactly the same thing as you are, I'd been looking forward to asking "Oh great oracle, what is the best deck in the game that runs Jade Idol and Hadronox?", and its answer was "Double Innervate, Zombie Chows, Green Jellies, ..., Dr. Boom, Splitting Festerroot, and Violet Wyrm". SMH
---
Just to clarify, is your collection complete and have all the cards necessary for Odd Mage?
---
I just started the update for android
---
Tree in art was such an overpowered mechanic, they dealt with it in the only way possible.
---
6 mana to all enemy minions, twinspell
---
Wow and the still removed it?  
---
Oh well, next itme invent some odd discussion point to go with it and then they can't really remove it for said rules.  
---
!RemindMe 3 months  
---
Words marked.
---
ya im canadian
---
Not complete, but I do play odd mage, so yes.
---
I mean it doesn't count any packs you get afterwards.  The 16 packs for F2P is obviously not enough.  They have to either pay for more, which is a worse deal if you don't get the preorder, or they have to buy them with gold.
---
This is good. Truth. 
---
Yeah. But I think that would be like new keywords. And if each class only gets one or two cards, I don't think it would be that confusing. But I guess it would be to new players.
---
I just thought it would be neat if like paladin got one or two adapt, warrior got a joust, mage or shaman got inspire. You're probably right though lol.
---
And I was trying to think... and not really. Maybe potions? Handbuffs? And ... jade *shudder*

Even with a low roll you could just play another spell from your hand
---
Sooo, next bunch of cards will be shown in 2 weeks?
---
Priest are known for healers, Shadow Priest are known for mind control, manipulation.
---
We've had a meta for a year that routinely sees the game go to turn 10+, where one of the best cards you could play cost 10 mana.
---
Why are people still calling 10 mana cards with *massive* upsides "too slow"?
---
Jaina died for this
---
If you define Boom as "Infinite Value" then almost all hero power are "infinite value", although Boom's hero power is that much more inconsistent. 
---
I agree and this comment would deserve gold if it wasn't so obviously true
---
Actually, I'm pretty sure it's an acronym.  I'm not sure why they didn't put in the periods, maybe something to do with spacing issues.  Now as for what the acronym stands for...
---
Yo dawg.
---
LamboDiabloSVTT circlejerk traitor 🤢🤢🤢
---
I play it very rarely. But I never completely stopped doing so. As long as you don’t play much it won’t become stale for you.
---
Overall the game is still good enough for me to not deinstall it, and every new expansion is fun for a few days at least.
---
If you think about HS as a game to play each day chances are it will become boring, but if you don’t have that expectation it’s a great game from time to time.
---
This bad boy can cast so many spells for zero Mana.
---
Say you play it and cast pyroblast, sure you got a 4/12, but did you really gain anything? If you pyro you're dead sure you're going to win, 4/12 or nah. 
---
This is no different than that seven drop because the effect is supposed to outweigh playing just the spell, you get a minion, BUT what does it matter if you use a turn to pyro either way? You're certain to win, why play a 10 drop instead? 
---
Say you clear board, does a 4/12 pose threat? No. 
---
Perfect for my Hakkarlock. See you later Elise. 
---
How are we supposed to root for King Togwaggle. He's hideous.

You should be able to tap on the image and it will enlarge. Then tap and hold to save the image to your phone. Go to the images in your phone and select the image. If you click the little icon with an arrow pointed upwards, there's an option to "Use as Wallpaper." That is how it works on iPhone at least, it's probably a bit different on Android.
---
Okay I thought I was crazy because the autofill was just as bad as ever when I tried it, but I only play on mobile.
---
There also aren’t very many Mage spells that you would want to play on any turn 10. Most of the big Mage spells are board clears and you want to play those ASAP, not on turn 10. Secrets are obviously spells you can play at any time, but is cheating out a 3 mana secret that good? I guess you can always Pyro face, and maybe this will make Pocket Galaxy playable. 
---
Hunter's already have one of the best board clears of the game, just no deck to use it.
---
It’s right there in the patch notes: wild is not currently supported for the new deck builder tool.
---
I can't use my Amazon coins to purchase anything in the client!
---
Nobody's stopping you from deck building. 
---
At the end of the day, Hearthstone is a strategy and *information* based game. In the age of the internet, and Hearthstone being the most popular online CCG around, neck decking is bound to happen on a mass scale. You're gaining information about what are the best ways to make a deck, and increase your chances of winning *significantly*. Of course everyone and their mother netdecks, because that's the standard if you want to win in a competitive ladder setting
---
But again, you can go and deck build. Sometimes just whatever's as fun as possible against your friends, sometimes when you're being creative while still trying to win games so you play good cards. I deck build all the time, it's great 
---
I thought I was on CustomHearthstone
---
Mana wyrm cost 2 now? Man a lot has changed...why didn't they just hall of fame it?
---
Definitely as a fellow hunter player myself I feel you on this. Let's hope we get some good hunter spells so we can abuse Zul'Jin and climb the ladder once more :D
---

---
Maybe you have to make it a 4 card combo and shadowstep Naomi afterwards, so you can refill the board after the board clear.
---
Oh I'm with you - I've been enjoying the big spell and control mage quite a bit and I tried different variations of it. Its existence, however, relies entirely the DK. As in, do you really need the HexLord if you got Jaina? You'll still win the control mirror without him and you'll still die to combo. I love greedy control mage, but its existence has always heavily relied on some broken late game sustain. 
---
Control decks without sustain don't survive, and the problem with control mage is that their sustain has always been tied to just 1-2 broken cards that people grow to hate. At the same time if mage does get those broken cards this expansion, do you really need the tempo that this new dragon provides? Remember Solia? How useful was she?
---
I really hope they rethink the mage's sustain cards, otherwise all these awesome value cards in mage will never be anything more than gimmicks.
---
I just thought it was Rafaam saying "Ohhhhh, I like that mechanic...
---
I think I will TAKE IT!"
---
Tbf Rin was good because it was in the same set with absurd Controllock tools.
---
Good joke. After rotation, the deck will be dead.
---
I'm not sarcastic, I don't hear what you describe at all
---
Does not work in wolf format
---
My thoughts exactly. 😂
---
Doesn't work in wild
---
Obviously it will be dead with spellstone rotating out. I never said it wouldn't be. If spellstone wasn't rotating it would easily still be a tier 1 deck
---
Orc, Kobold, Troll, Goblin, Ethereal.  
---
Daughters of flame, awaken
---
Nice, i had the spell hunter against some elemental mage who had infinte answers, but in the end the value from rexxar was too much and i won around fatigue
---
You do get a golden pack and a non-competitive but fun legendary, how much gold would you value those at?
---
It is only a matter of time before Hearthstone is declared as Italy's national food.
---
Sounds really pointless being how few heroes there are.  
---
So is any streamer gonna have the balls to tell blizz what bullshit this is?  They lay off 3/4s of their employees and then we get a fucking throwback set? No how about you do your fucking jobs and dont repackage garbage and expect us to not notice.  
---
If the gameplay is *fundamentally boring*, then why the hell do you play the game?
---
Why not go ask the creators of solitaire to spice up their card effects because it's "fundamentally boring"?
---
It just doesn't make any sense.
---
that's played super super late game and in a control deck that can play the attrition game. How do you propose that rogue can do that? I don't think it will fit into myra's rogue. Could be a alanna substitute for BSM tho
---
Hagatha is extra value, certainly not infinite.  Unless every elemental you play gives you an Elemental Might...
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I mean, that's just how game design is. Card games have a lot of moving parts, and while hundreds of ideas that'd be broken can get caught in......
---
​I understand this and I'm fine with having someone explain it to me. Hearthstone is especially guilty of hastily printed and obliviously addressed card design concerns- which is fine.   
---
&gt; I'm not sure if there's a card game out there that fits both of "Regularly receives/received expansions" and "Didn't occasionally create meta-dominating monstrosities by accident (or heaven forbid on purpose)."   
---
&gt;I wouldn't say there is either.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;Only that needing semi-regular balance fixes to nudge the metagame or excise a few dominating cards is a completely normal thing for card games,  
---
And again I agree. People are getting caught up in the web of problems.  
---
My problem is the history of "Bring Tyrande Back" and the exciting new insult that is Madame Lazul \[whom looks awesome\].  
---
There's a timeline in this thread. It's years old and it got moved so everyone's catching up on page 1, where the timeline is.

---
Everything else is just discourse to me. 
---
This is a lot of cards to assemble by turn 7-8
---
Lol wasn’t this the name of the Seahawks defense like 5 years ago
---
But wouldn't you just pyroface anyway, i mean not out of the blue, just when you're winning... Which leads to the question? Why not play pyroblast solemnly? Like in a tempo deck/burn deck
---
When there’s 10+ heroes for each class. Sure. 
---
Nice
---
I actually got an elemental shaman recipe. This is a very old deck that I remember someone said he had a lot of success with. I guess he was right. 
---
Its body is enough to be respected.  Its a decent 7 mana card and it has the same hp as Lich King and has immediate effect. You'll see.
---
has anyone seen the mechathun priest it builds? it’s really weird with lots of 1 ofs. 
---
\*ARENA SALT INTENSIFIES\*
---
Big Mage looks pretty bad though.
---
DK Jaina, Artificer, Dragons Fury, Meteor and Sindagosa rotate out.
---
Amazing!
---
Its all right.
---
It depends on how slow the meta is. Playing an early Myra’s so you can play a strider to beef your board up is a viable strategy against decks that struggle with removal. 
---
If my turn 6 is some combination of Myra’s, backstab, eviscerate etc to clear the board then I’m going to win against Hunters,  Zoos, Rogues etc with a full board on 7.
---
No hero cards, introducing villain cards!
---
Shakes &amp; fidget?
---
Haha, I normally don't keep these stupid arguments going, but I was bored and his responses were so funny.
---
Sorry you had to witness that *degraded tone!*
---
I thought the concede was implying your opponent would concede. 🤦‍♂️ 
---
Maybe a new weapon, "Herin Marked Blade"? 
---
Well memed
---
&gt;It seems to not work too well when adding just single atrocious cards (like Harbinger Celestia). Then it will just create whatever current deck is very good plus the one bad card.
---
That make sense.  That's probably the highest win rate deck with that awful card.
---
It was there when I read it minutes after being posted.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Hmm, perhaps it was - I could be crazy. 
---
Still, the comedic value of these decks is worth posting, if for nothing more than a reminder of how much better the new system is.

Its amazing for casuals. Ive wanted a pirate rogue for ages. But not wanted to burn dust on a non meta.  I toss in the pirates I do have. It fills in the best shit I can muster around it. And off I go with mediocre mid tier pirate deck. And I'm using cards I've never touched before and having fun with them. Even if I'm losing sometimes.  
---
And others, suddenly it shits out an Odd Mage out me that's really really solid and I had no idea I had the cards for it cause it's not something people on hsreplay are using. Yet here it is. Working. 
---
Not counting livestreamers playing off-meta decks for fun, and me since I normally play janky decks for fun? A few days ago I ran into someone playing a homebrew dragon+lady in white deck. Ran into an odd quest hunter yesterday. It's not often, but it does happen, usually more often around rank floors.
---
I'd argue slightly below, similar to how stonehill on average gave slightly below a card.
---
Nah, they dabble in the Void too. Voidwalker, after all. (Yeah, I know, they still call them Demons for gameplay reasons both in WoW and HS, but word of god is that no, they're not Demons.)
---
Priests are by far the class that does the most in that space though, having an entire specialization of it.
---
Kick rocks pussy. I'm so tired of seeing that shit. It's literally 2 out of every 3 matches. Take your gimmicky-ass bullshit to wild where it belongs.

Cards that put random legendaries onto the board are often very weak, because you don't get any battlecries.  [[The Storm Bringer]]
---
Putting those legendary minions into your hand is another story.  They are often quite good.  The key is to play Rafaam at the right moment.  He lets you win a long, grindy game by transforming your useless cards (the ones you didn't need in this matchup) into good ones.
---
Part of playing it well is knowing which cards to save for a transform at the end of the game.
---
Look, they can't go changing artwork for minor details like depicting completely the wrong character. The art team is very busy and can only spend time changing old artwork for truly drastic issues like covering up a tiny bit of cleavage.

The Exodia mage tech we needed 2 expansions ago
---
For me a simple a reasonable solution would be to keep the 3x3 layout they so love but instead of decks you first choose the class you wanna play. That opens up another tab with 9 deckslots for that class. Next step would be 9 slots for each mode (standard/wild) and switching the mode also switches the decks so you can have 9 standard and 9 wild decks.
---
So you do "Play Game" -&gt; "Class: Shaman" -&gt; "Shudderwock" for example. EZ
---
I don't think I agree.  I think it's highly likely it doesn't see play, but I also see a fairly strong possibility that it could be a real deck.  Here's why:  A deck only needs to win more than it loses to climb.  Even if your gameplan is countered extremely easily.  The hardest thing to predict, imo, is consistency.  If you can (hypothetically) consistently activate Nomi quickly, then your winrate is essentially 'Did your opponent either aggro you down quick or draw their board clear? No?'  Prep Myra's is definitely not the only way to get through a bunch of cards quickly in rogue.  
---
I think it would be kinda degenerate, but it *could* be a legitimate gameplan, relying on your opponent not drawing lethal or a boardclear before you cycle your whole deck.  It depends a lot on the meta and card released.  What if there's another popular rogue deck that pressures people against hard mulliganing for expensive aoe?  What if an easy board clear or tutor gets printed?  What if it doesn't?  
---
Right now, what options are there to deal with it easily?  Priest has Mass Hysteria, but lost shadow visions and Anduin.  Mage has Frost Nova into Blizzard into Flamestrike, but that's two different (damaging) cards to draw, most likely in a deck that isn't built to cycle the way this hypothetical rogue will be.  Warrior has Brawl, but no tutor or heavy cycle.  Druid has no real response.  Paladin has Shrink Ray and can buy time with time out.  Hunter has, what?  Toxmonger double springpaw?  Shaman might have some sort of Zentimo Combo?  Rogue can buy a turn with Vanish.
---
It seems unlikely to me for it to be a real deck, for sure, but I also think it's too early to dismiss.

&gt; I'm excited about this actually! Discover and random card generation will only pull from the cards in the sets available to draft. We didn't originally have the tech to do this but our engineers are wizards and conjured up a solution in time. Thanks, wizard engineers!

[This recent thread suggested that Hearthstone no longer accepts Amazon Coins](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b18cdq/warning_regarding_all_amazon_coins_users/).
---
Druids and Paladins sometimes run zoo-like decks with a flood of minions and buffs to power them up.
---
Nothing will be as good as Pre-nerfed Call of the Wild
---
That emptiness feels like its gonna be filled in with some more EVIL
---
These day 1 combos never succeed. Except that one time when a guy made M'Thun Priest with abominations and most people laughed at him.
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking when I saw this in the trailer haha!
---
Just make sure Kalecgos is the only minion in your deck for Barnes to pull and then you're much more likely to get off your free Luna's Pock... wait a sec.
---
&gt; I'm a big fan of this kind of RNG
---
This RNG is pretty fair.  You still pay the appropriate mana cost for the legendary minion. And generally speaking you're just playing legendary minions that you could have put into your deck in the first place.
---
Granted, some of them will be from other classes, or duplicates, which isn't possible.  But since it's unreliable, there is nothing to exploit.
---
They are charging for the legendaries, hero skins etc - it's built into the cost of the bundles.  They are experimenting with pricing and add-ons to see what people will pay.
---
In control vs. control (which is what this effect is good for) a mana nerf or stat nerf doesn’t do much to impact the game because it’s the value that matters, and nerfs to cards typically don’t impact the overall value very much, just the tempo.
---
Oh, that's simple. Just buy Medivh and get his card back :^)
---
Everybody forgets about our lord Jaraxxxus
---
Yeah, that's what happens when you buy things. Usually, the more you spend, the more you get. It's not a difficult concept to understand.
---
Honestly... this could be the combo deck that surprises everyone at first, but then the meta settles and it goes to tier 3. Like mechathun.
---
Understandable mistake, for my first month I didn't trust lethal because I didn't understand ice block
---
Hey, Warlock has Jaraxxus
---
Can you re-check the price you see for regular packs? They are only sold in bundles of 2, 7, 15 and 40, but you mentioned a pack of 3 in your OP.
---
Awww I wanna become Rafaam The Supreme Archaeologist!
---
Sir Annoy-O is a troll hero as well.
---
If that's true, maybe just the big clash between them in some third location? 
---
wasnt maly's art actually kalycgos?
---
I’ve got my tickets for Minneapolis! 
---
It sure as fuck is when you can combine it with a board clear or remove a massive enemy minion.
---
As in recoloring old hs cards to fill a "corrupted" theme 
---
It seems to be split up with only the good guy classes getting twinspell, so that probably isn't happening 
---
You clearly haven’t played any wild recently becuase the reason Elise doesn’t see play is becuase she’s far too slow for the format. The average legendary is still very large, and the changing legendary pool does relatively little to impact this effect in control vs control (the reason you put this card into your deck). There might be a slightly larger proportion of legendaries that are still small, the number of legendaries that are either big or generate a lot of value is still more than half. Half is pretty much all you need.
---
I need a sexy ass priest portrait that runs a fine line being nerfed like Jaina was. 
---
The power level after rotation will be a lot weaker, zul'jin is going to be weaker for sure same with almost all other decks. secret hunter has always being a solid deck, I don't see a reason to not play zul'jin, even without emerald spellstone and company.

Pretty much knockoff echo. Kinda sad it’s one of three “new” mechanics.
---
I feel like joust has been going strong in Mage for a while now, I really miss inspire though, even if it was kind of memey.
---
Ummm. I know. That's why I said it's bad.
---
But what happened to the cheaper option? ($20-$30 preorder) That's the preorder I usually end up getting and now it seems I'm forced into a $50 preorder or nothing at all......been saving the $25 in my bliz balance for months to cover this cost......
---
What's card do you enjoy seeing the opponent play on turn 1?
---
Did you play during tgt? Because that was never really a problem.  Kodorider was the only one that ever came close to snowball status... maaaaaaybe paletress, but mostly inspire cards never got played. 
---
There's nothing from KFT or Un'goro
---
I wouldn't say discovering a Rover, Dynomatic, or Zilliax is "low value". 
---
And that's just the *highest* of rolls. With all mechs having rush, there are tons of mechs that a copy of will be useful. Nullifier, Security Rover, Pinata, just off the top of my head.

wqy#1820
---
I think you stumbled on the problem. Cards still cost as much as ever and now people are paying $80 for a cosmetic. I’m fine with monetizing cosmetics but there is a limit to what is reasonable and if they are only being used to pad the profits instead of improve the game experience then it is fair to be annoyed. 
---
Mass Hysteria will do the job nicely.
---
You are not a whale. You are a halibut.
---
wotog reused deathwing, hogger, mukla, nat pagle, ragnaros...
---
Put those into a freeze mage deck with pocket galaxy and you might have something interesting
---
Same complaints happening in Warcraft as well. Spend more!! spend spend spend. I get the value here but 80 damn packs, even the smaller bundle is a lot up front. Next expansion will see 100 packs and then 130 packs for the third. 
---
how do you think other classes felt when Guldan had one for years before anyone else got their first?
---
80 packs will give you most of the set except some epics and legendaries.

---
So, what passive treasure did you pick?
---
You can, you just have to do it on mobile or an emulator.
---
I don't know what your problem is, but okay.
---
to add to this, at the top by the card releases theres 10 cards seperate from the rest of the cards that all hidden unrevealed. maybe itll be this years theme for the legendarys, plus an extra for neutral?
---
i wouldve guessed the heros and villians wouldve been the theme legendary though.
---
Not sure if this is just speculation but a few people have mentioned that the EVIL classes are getting Lackey cards while the defenders are getting Twinspell. If this is true it'd mean no Twinspell Rogues :(
---
Have you clicked on the link? I'm not sure if it's cross-regional, but I just bought 10,000 coins for $61.
---
Now I'm torn between using the random card back and spread the Hakkar one... 
---
Yes , RNG fiesta is dangerous.
---
So you're answer to my question would be nothing?
---
can somebody gift me heres my battletag #2380
---
Lackeys have a villain connotation though. 
---
Twinspell has to be the most boring new mechanic we’ve seen so far. 
---
It's not a scam, I just bought 10,000 coins for $61 through the link.
---
I was kind of assuming that they’d be for the good guys where mage specifically would be mostly Dalaran themes. I like your idea of paladin being Aethas Sunreaver.
---
But with that plan you're attacking with a board of 4/4s the turn after Myra's, with this it's *two* turns later.
---
Yeah they still need to release things like trample first strike etc. 
---
I got scammed by him too. GildenDrake#6251 is his other account.
---
This will be interesting in tournaments when the sideboard option is added to the game. 
---
&gt;Don't focus on the highroll, focus on the card on average...
---
Mage has lots of AoE. Flamestrike, Blizzard, Dragon's Fury, Blast Wave, Frost Nova and probably one printed this expansion. Even if you don't "highroll" and hit one of 5-6 AoE spells, you'll probably have one of them in your hand to play immediately. Almost guarantees a boardclear against agro, and is a huge threat against control. 
---
"Nomi you can't cook ^its ^hopeless "
---
"Can't I?" *turns around to the stove* "Burn it. BURN IT"
---
Blizzard probably does have a BR in the works. Hearthstone and OW are about to hit cruising speed for revenue. Wouldnt be surprised if they hit the tail end of BRs with something super refined thats not a Moba. RIP HoTS. 
---
How much did you save?
---
Rogue can already draw all of their deck steal half of your deck Mill the other half etc. 
---
and swap in Soularium!
---
Yeah here is the thing about this 10 drop, it isn't really a 10 drop because it doesn't have the weakness most 10 cost cards have. That being the fact you can't interact with the board the same turn you play it.
---
Sure you need 10 mana, but a control deck can usually get there, plus we're entering a meta with no Even or Odd decks. That means less consistent early game across the board.
---
Also warrior is looking like it will be a top contender next expansion, while hunter is practically falling apart.
---
If a control meta does appear, this card will see some amount of play. Heck, I could even see this making Wild Reno Mage lists.
---
Its like Dustfallen Aviana, that works imidiatly and not for your Opponent and has better stats and dragon synergy (for whatever that'd be used)
---
If you are buying in euros you can go to the US Blizzard store and save money by buying in USD. Or even cheaper, use Amazon Coins (requires some setup).
---
I've heard that there will not
---
"this is MY opinion. If you have another you're just a pedantic FANBOI and are not right considered to us hearthstone people that don't know anything about Warcraft"

That first one is *thicc*
---
Or you discover mirror image, frost nova and arcane missiles.
---
That's what I thought even if I really didn't wanted it to.
---
I wanted an Even Hunter and deck it built looks fricking hilarious. It has Deathwing, Rockpool Hunter and Megasaur, Black Knight and Keening Banshee for some reason. Well lets see how many games can I lose on rank 7 before I get bored.
---
If it doesn't say it includes the solo adventure, I would assume that it won't. Every bundle ever sold by Blizzard is explicit in what it contains.
---
If priest mind controls it does mc becomes free 
---
Given your throwback mechanics are for each villain, let's go digging
---
RAFAAM, THE SUPREME ARCHAEOLOGIST
---
Warlock
---
League of Explorers
---
Mechanics: Discover, Reno
---
Singleton cards have an EXTREMELY long shelf life in Wild, so I expect warlock to get a glut of Discover this set.
---
King Togwaggle
---
Rogue
---
Kobolds and Catacombs
---
Mechanics: Recruit, Transform when Drawn Cards
---
Recruit is scary. It broke the game, they nerfed it hard, and it kinda behaved (but not really) thereafter. There's a chance recruit makes a comeback, as Rogue has recruit mechanics outside of KnC (Hooktusk), but we also have this interesting transform mechanic that only took off in the instance of one card and one of the devs seemed passionate about it. I expect another transform in hand card, possibly some sort of wacky candle spell.
---
Doctor Boom
---
Warrior
---
Goblins vs. Gnomes, The BOOMSDAY Project
---
Mechanics: RNG, Mechs, Magnetic, Projects
---
Doctor Boom is about explosions, Mechs, and RNG. Mechs are associated with the Magnetic mechanic, and explosions tend to be deathrattles. While Dr. Boom's theme is fairly well set in stone, how it presents itself is, frankly, the least certain of the five simply because he's already been reprinted and exists in two iterations of the bot theme. 
---
In any case, warrior has a tremendous mech package, and the good doctor is almost certain to deliver a mech with mystery mechanics.
---
Madame Preorder
---
Priest
---
Whispers of the Old Gods
---
Mechanics: "Forbidden" cards, the proliferation of Discover as evergreen
---
While Whispers was cool, the set came down to 10 mana bomb cards, exploitation of rotation to reprint a new core of pieces to play with, and the C'thun cult which is almost impossible to reprint. Forbidden is the obvious pick, and we already know it's here. There may be another.
---
Hagatha
---
Shaman
---
The Witchwood
---
Mechanics: Rush, Lifesteal, Poisonous, Echo, ~~Odd/Even~~
---
Hagatha exists at a point in time where some mechanics we already had were codified as evergreen, much to the betterment of neutral minion complexity. As the headliner mechanic of Witchwood is gone, Hagatha's cards are likely to be boring and prosaic, unless they go with Echo. Expect an Echo.
---
You rarely Myra‘s exactly on curve anyways
---
Maybe because how much the game costs is an ongoing concern for a certain segment of the playerbase?
---
Anklebiter might not be too bad tho. It helps against aggro with the lifesteal+ping. 
---
It's really hard to value trade for 10/10 of stats that only cost 1 card without losing out on card advantage.
---
&gt; 25th?
---
Yes. As always, there will be some cards next week too from Blizzard themselves. We should also get the reveal timetable some time next week.
---
Yeah, 4 wins is around the average 
---
So it looks like Rafaam is granting his fellow villains some boons. Hagatha gets vitality/youthful strength (look at those tighs), Boom gets half-mechified, Togwaggle gets a light fixture on his head or something. Dunno what he grants the troll lady tho, unlikely it is the tentacle stuff, since the titan-origin Staff of Origination (is it canon that he stole it anyway, despite our efforts in LoE?) wouldn't be able to induce void-related things.
---
what about that spoiled Darius Crawley hero card?
---
Outside of Spare Parts, we have randomly do random to a random :)
---
I can confirm most of your observations. I wanted to see what crazy deck I can get  with Princess Talanji  and was quite surprised when  I got some variation of wall priest with exactly ZERO cards that can put minions in my deck (making Talanji's battlecry completely useless). 
---
They can just nerf him, not everything needs to be HOFed.
---
Just make his effect a battlecry: *Gain Spell Damage +5*. Many problems solved.
---
Seriously why no one seems to remember this?
---
🍝
---
I
---
Thank you for the replay, I used a non US card as well, but it was finished instantly in the past, so I got a bit confused now. I guess I'll wait few more hours and then contact the support if it still doesn't show up...
---
C
---
/quityourbullshit
---
They would not use the same art.   
---
The cards in your deck does not make sense. Yip without sufficient armor gain?   
---
And what's that Darius effect on the left hand bar in picture 5#, when it is your turn and there are no minions in play? Furthermore, what is that thing by your opponent marked in red in the same bar, it is no effect and it is clearly still your turn.   
---
your deck list does not include regular Crowley, yet in picture 6# he has made an attack. If it is your hero, should not a charge on the weapon be missing?  
---
And finally:   
---
[https://twitter.com/LegendaryFerret/status/1106277962465361920](https://twitter.com/LegendaryFerret/status/1106277962465361920)
---
I see you everywhere 😅  
---
Nope, nothing at all. Even the video I mentioned was only put out on the day after.
---
&gt; Your reaction is horrible. Some people answered that they don't like  something about the game so they have to make changes to address it?  Changes to the specific thing you are evaluating? To your standards? At  the first opportunity? 
---
Lol what? Curb your aggression dude. I literally made it clear that collecting a hero for $80 won't be an issue for me personally if I decide I want the new priest skin, and that I did actually buy the $80 TBP bundle for Mecha-Jaxx. So no, I'm not demanding that they're changing the game to my standards at the first opportunity. You'd do well not to put words in my mouth if you want to have a proper discussion here. Unless you just want to needlessly whiteknight against my opinion. 
---
What I'm actually saying is expressing curiosity at why out of the three totally distinct pricing strategies they have taken in the last year, they are specifically picking the most expensive one which coincidentally, copped an above average amount of flak when it came out.
---
&gt; Sure, some people find the game expensive, so what? Why does that mean they wouldn't put this pricing up? 
---
Because depending on the proportion of people that find the game expensive, their pricing decision affects their bottom line. The most recent expansion releases have all had rather unprecedented (and I'm predicting, experimental) pricing decisions, with WW, TBP and RR having distinct pricing strategies and bundle options. Seems strange to me that given how long HS has been a product, they're just now deciding to experiment with their pricing (and apparently, decided that the TBP bundling and pricing was the most profitable, probably). Smells like Activi$ion to me, but that's just my hunch.
---
&gt; I disagree. That wouldn't that big of an impact on bringing people back, maybe on keeping people in. 
---
The F2P experience in this game has been a fairly major talking point alongside making the game more competitively friendly, gameplay variety and game balance so I don't really see how that's somehow missed your radar. But sure, if you think it isn't going to be a big deal for the long-term success of this game, it would be better for us to just agree to disagree on this.
---
&gt; Also it being a big impact does not support anything connected to the  Twitter thread and your reaction, or are you implying that the devs  gained new knowledge about that from the Twitter thread? 
---
It's also quite literally [one of the replies under the tweet](https://twitter.com/gulder_/status/1097393528257241089), [plus another about adventures](https://twitter.com/EvangelionEldar/status/1097644607695798273) so IDK what you're on about 
---
Hope not, didn't like rat really
---
I quit playing maybe 6 months ago, and to be honest doing all the reading into what's meta etc is putting me off getting back into it - ranked at least. 
---
This might at least speed that up a bit I guess...
---
Considering that they animate every single golden card, animating a hero portait can't be much more work.
---
&gt; That's not what I said.
---
I was just stating it for comparison. 
---
&gt; Missing ones will be bad epics and legendaries. You won't need them so it is pretty close to 100%. You can miss 1-2 good legendaries but that's fine.
---
Why would you only miss bad epics? You don't know what you'll get in packs. You can get unlucky and even after using all your dust still miss good epics (or the second copy) and legendaries.
---
I believe there's a window at the start of the year where you can play all the things together and then they get rotated, right?
---
Well yeah, plague gets rotated, idk about toxmonger though, forgot where it's from.
---
EVIL! THIS CARD IS EVIL!
---
E
---
Of the later boards my favorite is Witchwood. I like the theme and its satisfying to click on the trees in rhytm to the music playing or the acorn to summon the evil tree stump. Otherwise the boards small interactions have become less interesting.
---
Those look yellow with a pink haze because of the pink flames. 
---
Damn pay2win
---
i gave all of you an upvote.
---
Or **Kalecgos + Coin + concede** 
---
Let’s drop tilted my bois
---
What kinda villain says "Kind regards"? Lmao cool easter egg though.
---
Everyone who has a mother! ... and a brain.
---
Isn't Kalecgos the only dragon in Dalaran?
---
Villian cards tho? 
---
Yeah I’ve tried the auto complete function with a ton of cards and it almost always just takes the best deck for the class and throws your card in there. It’s a pretty shitty feature.
---
It sort of is. But what's worse is that they come split across 5 bodies. Maybe your opponent has 10 attack in stats but he may only be able to remove 2-3 treants with that (and may waste a bunch of attack in doing so).
---
I'm not going to claim this is a super dangerous card but it's certainly one that is hard to remove efficiently without a boardclear. The sticking point will be if druid will be able to make use of leftover small minions at incredibly high manacost or whether this is just too late in the game.
---
In Japan, the coins are = to 1 dollar. It's stupid, but I can usually get 10,000 coins for 80$ (8000円), but! The 50 card bundle is 6000円 and the big bundle is 9800円 (100$!!) So basically 6000 and 9800 coins. Fuck that. I am out.
---
First time in a long time I don't pre-order. I don't care if it is good value for packs or whatever, I can't justify paying that money on a game I haven't enjoyed very much the last two years. These bundles were not a great way to bring back old players.
---
I care
---
Thanos Rafaam
---
Maybe he's there a couple of times, but it's not like he BELONGS to Dalaran. He's with the Blue Dragon Flight. A Mage legendary since we'll obvious links to the Arcane and he and Jaina were lovers. Was actually wondering why he isn't a card for almost 6 years. 
---
Nice guide! I will probably try this out later. Thanks for your efforts!
---
Yes I agree with you, I just meant they need to be careful with it! For now, if I need a specific Lackey and the EVIL Miscreant gives me 2 out of 5 of them, I have a good chance of getting what I need. With a larger pool, it will lower chances of a useful roll.
---
Maybe this is all already planned out, for example giving 1 new Lackey to each class (making the pool of 6 Lackeys with 1 of them changing from class to class), or maybe making "good" Lackeys, like if a company of heroes is assembled to fight Rafaam &amp; Co. we may have other (1) Mana 1/1 called Sidekicks that works like Lackeys but are acquired from different cards. 
---
So, yeah, it looks like an interesting mechanic and I'm happy they will be taking care of it, but it needs the proper balance.
---
"You know what? Im just gonna skip all of the fire puns.... There are a LOT of them"
---
This is the second time I see this post... be careful everyone. I have heard there are scammers. I would not be so quick to click the link and make a payment.
---
If I'm paying for the price of a full game, I would expect to be able to build more than 1/2 decks, hence why I have, and never will buy pre-release 'deals'. Least when you buy a game full price you can trade it in down the line towards something else, and you know, explore all the game has to offer. 
---
Do enjoy HS for the record, just think most of their deals are top tier trash rip offs. The welcome bundles are the only things I buy apart from the odd couple of packs, but these seems a bit too good value...
---
Maybe you should be able to pay a fixed price to unlock all the cards from you fav class or something? I dunno, just too random for me to dump money and not know what I'm getting out the other side, last expansion I seemed to get all the shitty rogue legends, would have been pissed if I spent actual money on it.
---
Thanks. At least this is more than what we get from the [Blizzard Press Kit](https://blizzard.gamespress.com/Hearthstone).
---
Yeees
---
League of Shadows was taken.
---
It surely used to not be as pricey, but compare hearthstone to literally any physical card game and you're still Off WAY cheaper with hearthstone. They should check their pricing again tho, it gets ridiculous and is more about ExClUsIvE cosmetics than the actual game and it's cards at this point. 
---
The more recent heroes have been better balanced.
---
Considering how their mechanics don't work "as intended" a lot of times, maybe they don't even know 100% what they've done and let it up to the community now. Very Bethesda move right there. 
---
That can be enough sometimes. But yes, you're right you do need to have heal options lying around too
---
Was hoping for a keyword that favours positioning. Makes the game play a bit more skillful.
---
Ask in r/wildhearthstone. Or you can [copy the VS list](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/nores-even-shaman/) and adapt it to your local meta.
---
I wonder if it's only Android users then 
---
They already have, I just think it will be more along the lines of a control threat instead of a tempo finisher

---
Literally had that joke 3 hours ago
---
It's part of the existent and previous druid deck recipes, so I'm quite sure they do have data for it.
---
Some code leaking from another feature? Maybe not tournament mode specifically but something similar.
---
Usually about a couple months into the same meta is when cards started getting reviled
---
Thank you for posting this!

I'll be honest, I don't like her voice work.

Guess I'm sticking with tyrande.
---
You could cast it while falling?
---
No, it's based on the announcement video. Dave Kosak suggests that the mechanic is for the defenders of Dalaran, aka the non villain classes
---
X-FORCE!
---
No.
---
Well.
---
Cannot flair.
---
GG me.
---
Except it literally never makes a deck based around the card you put in it, it just throws it in the best deck 
---
Priests can run Mass Hysteria, warlock has Twisting Nether, mage has Blizzard+Flamestrike, warrior has Brawl, paladin has Equality+Consecration/Pyromancer+Equality. Psychic Scream and Dragon's Fury are rotating out but they'd be good answers too. I don't think it'll be easy to answer and not finding one almost always means lethal with 42 damage on board, but it should be decently likely in a control matchup.
---
Safe from priests and got that thicc booty
---
I often see people comment how they don't like the rng of it
---
I liked the old one. This one seems off
---
got the cardback and the hero portrait from the mega bundle, but no golden :(  
---
will I get the card once the issue is fixed or do I need to open a ticket?

I'm pretty sure it is not enabled for wild yet see [this](https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/hearthstone/22911364/hearthstone-update-march-14).
---
* **NOTE:** This feature is currently disabled in the Wild format. Please stay tuned for more info on when you can use the smart deck builder to help construct Wild decks.
---
meh
---
I just use the Arcane Tracker icon. Looks nice! 
---
i also found something weird. put m'thun in druid so it would build the best possible m'thun deck and then i put 3 random druid cards not in the m'thun deck, completely unsinergetic, and it still built the m'thun deck, minus 3 cards from the original. i dont know i its because the deck is the best win rate deck for druid (for instance 53%), even with those 3 cards swaped (the game reads winrate goes down to 49%) and the 3 random cards i use have bad win rates in the decks they are used (lets say their best win rate in decks is 40%).
---
To summarise, it seems the game builds archetype 1(55%win rate), even if you use 3-5 cards from archetype 2(45% win rate) if those cards dont make archetype 1 deck drop below the 45% win rate in this case.
---
Even Frost Nova will usually be good enough against Pally or Hunter.
---
Seems innocuous enough not to be worth talking about. I did notice it when I updated my Android devices.
---
I found a way to break it by building a hireek warloc deck and it autocompleted parts of the mechac'thun combo without mechacthun. Just 1 galvanizer. 
---
Apparently it uses deck archetypes as orientation if it has no data. 
---
Would love to have more insight into that tool. 
---
RAFAAAAM!!! THE SUPREME villain.
---
Absolutely going to be a Warrior legendary.
---
Update: it was quickly added to the patchnotes. 
---
I really find it a nice touch too!!
---
The best I've ever seen it. 
---
Voice acting in all the different languages takes time and quite bit of money depanding on who it is. Plus art needs to be comisioned early.
---
And first heroes dint do well.
---
I was really looking forward for this, then i realized im barely seeing the cardback i use. 
---
I gotta agree with you on that one, but it's the smartest way to profit for blizzard. Everybody likes the skins, everybody wanted a priest skin, and a lot of people seemed to like her as a character. Perfect cash grab.
---
If they just released the skins for like 20$ with a card back(or 40$ for you I guess) like they used to, they would start going down in value tbh. If you can buy them at any given time people are not in a hurry to waste their money. And if they are multiples that aren't even limited, people will stop buying them. It really is just a big company trying to get every penny out of our pockets by using what we want as a bait. Pretty normal stuff....
---
MEANWHILE, AT THE LEGION OF DOOM
---
r/BadHSCombos
---
I'm talking about my card back. 
---
It is UGLY.
---
I do not understand the change, I do not understand why they do not just add this one to the previous, so you can choose the one you like more.
---
I think it has to do with androids adaptive icon feature. On newer Android versions, you need to create a special icon that can be transformed into different shapes, otherwise you get an ugly white border around the icon. 
---
Does it work everywhere.( Region)
---
So? Vote with your wallet then. If you're really that upset about these things, then don't play the game. 
---
Maple#21429 on EU. Trading the quest, you go first!
---
Villains who sing?
---
Also echo is limited to be low mana only, there is no reason to have echo in 5+ cards. This can be both low and high mana, but I think it will be echo counterpart for high mana mostly. 
---
It would be fun to update the LoE boss choice screen with a missing staff headpiece 
---
That's weird. When i put prince kally in a mage deck it built me this. Not your proper big spell mage but not bad...

what?

Yeah, I know, thanks again

So I downloaded some PNG with old look.

But it has not the background from Blue Fusion icon pack... damn!
---
Just don't buy it...oh boy. Every damn new expansion there is a fu\*kton of complains about the price, yada yada yada. Well, guess what? The best way you can tell them this is not a good deal is not buying it. Simple as that. You don't need to give birth to a national revolution just because you can't afford it.
---
Btw, this time arround the pre order got cheaper in my country, so...not every one seems to experience the same bitter taste with HS prices every single damn time a new expansion hits.
---
I'm just sick of it, every single expansion, the same stuff aaaaall over again. Ok, we already understood that Blizzard is a mercenary company. Can you handle it? Good. Can't? Just move on.
---
TL;DR: Just don't buy it and keep on living ;). The world doesn't need to know you are sad because of this (actually, Blizzard doesn't give a single fuck for that xD)
---
Probably they use publicly available data on competitive decks. Gaps are filled by taking the most common co-occuring cards to the ones chosen already. I assume through a cosine distance function on an embedding. 
---
That approach will not work as properly in wild where variation is too diverse.
---
The method that would work under all circumstances would involve much more intricate reinforcement learning perhaps.. the technology isnt there yet. For realz this time.
---
&gt; Technically, you get to keep the HS cards forever, right?
---
No... it's still a digital game where players own nothing except the right to use their accounts.

Poor dev teams doing their best, then someone making business decisions sets everything (cosmetics, new heroes, golden legendaries) behind a paywall so high Mr Trump would be jealous of it, so noone is actually happy despite de improvement :(
---
The fact that you dropped $150 on incomplete content is the exact reason why they charge $150 for it. 
---
They’re releasing a bundle when the expansion drops that is 9 packs and an arena ticket for $9.99
---
fyi if you log onto a PC client, it will be 10 dollars cheaper.
---
Isn't that the point?  If it's worth the money to you then you buy it, if it isn't then you don't?
---
I wish we could delete Wild cards, golden animations and audio effects. I know they won't because of possible cheating, but I don't need those game files taking up space.
---
I must be doing something wrong then, because I've been saving since just after Rumble Run was released and I've got just under 4k
---
&gt; Region lock it

As if that isn't going to get bypassed. 
---
The best one I saw in a different thread, was 29 card Quest Rogue deck with just the quest missing, auto completes to +1 Eviscerate instead of the quest
---
Would you say eu should wait and hope?
---
Just because it's potential tech card doesn't mean it can go there.  It has to actually accomplish something other than making you survive one extra turn before dying. 
---
Can we get a TLDR? Also you wrote inactive players twice FYI (presumably you meant to write more active once).

Almost bingo :D

Yeah someone mentioned we didnt really get to explore raven deck types due to power. Which is fair, think its just me tbh. Ive actually been playing stupid decks like discard loc and buff heal pally through rastakhan and actually doing decent. I think buff mech pally will be sone very scary shit

Dude this is hearthstone not wow. It matters jack shit if dr boom is relevant in wow.there are a lot of characters in hearthstone that dont even exist in wow
---
I think it's more likely that the deck builder doesn't know how to make successful deck shells with Lakkiri Sacrifice or Lynessa.  (Lynessa in particular actually has had successful tournament decks, but so rarely played that the deck builder might not know how to make them).
---
Everybody can get shitty legendaries, the legendary might aswell be free, think of it as a reward for wasting more money. If you get more packs, the reward is better, simple. 
---
It has to be better tho, they want people to buy the 80$... if they made it the same most people wont go out of their way to get the bigger bundle. You're just thinking with your heart, not with your brain. 
---
But you are not forced to buy it...want the skin? Buy it. Dont have money? Dont buy it. 
---
Last expansion I wasn't doing that great economically speaking, i didnt get the preorder or any packs. Didnt get king rastakhan and I'm still breathing. Dont value a skin so much, you said it yourself, it's just an intangible good.
---
Or people are just tired of people constantly whining about it. We get it, you don't think $100 is worth it. Don't buy it then. I don't think buying a porsche is worth it but I'm not going into their dealerships going "your car is too expensive, you need to make it cheaper you greedy fucks."

Ok, what does dead card mean to you then? 
---
They used to before Starving Buzzard got annihilated. 
---
Exactly
---
how
---
Those two things are not mutually exclusive.  If this tech card actually does something relevant enough to warrant bringing to tournaments you can bet it will be floating around in the meta.  People won't bring it if it sucks and doesn't actually counter anything, which is what it looks like. 
---
Here is a bunch of wallpapers for the new expansion 
---
https://progameguides.com/hearthstone/hearthstone-rise-of-shadows-wallpapers/
---
My app hasn’t crashed but it no longer uses voice lines for cards which is pretty weird. Also some other sounds are missing. For example, the innkeeper doesn’t say the names of the heroes at the beginning of the game.
---
Hoping for a quick fix playing the game without those is bizarre. 
---
The entire release hasn't been made yet so asking for any certainty is pointless right now.
---
Can't talk much about this particular expansion since we barely know anything about the specific cards but overall I am in the same situation as you. Started in early beta and since late 2018 I lost almost all drive. So much talk about exciting new stuff in 2019 and all we got was random card back and (for veterans) worthless automatic deck building. Just wow. Yes you may be burned out but the relevant factor is the non existing actual improvements to the game being made. As always I will look into the expansion and see how I can improve my beloved Wild decks with new cards (hello Kalecgos to Reno Mage) but I am years beyond considering investing money into this game.
---
To be fair I had many moments where I thought I had quit and found another cool new card game (Elder Scrolls Legends, Gwent etc) but I always ended up coming back because the core of the game is sick and I love the decks and combos I have been building up over the last few years (wrote more about that here: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqqi22). Just started Magic Arena and I seriously *hope* it can permanently win me over (about time a functioning and intuitive digital Magic implementation has come out).
---
The old was better
---
Yeah it will be useful in longer games where you are eventually going to get up to 8 damage with your ping but it will probably never be played on turn 7 again in a competitive deck.
---
This is more exciting than the new expansion 
---
It looks just like Karazhan slept with Mean Streets of Gadgetzan. Meh
---
&gt; Add an extra 20 and that's "our deal".

OH I don't care about the skin. I am thinking about the people that love to have that stuff that now need to make a choice. Continue collecting all the skins (as a hobby or just completionist mentality) and shell out an extra 30$, or don't. It's fucking stupid that people even need to make that choice. This is hearthstone. It's not a triple A game where you can buy an expert edition by gaining access to the WHOLE game. This is fucking cards. Buying thirty extra packs actually has WAY less value than buying 50. So essentialy, you are saying that it is ok for Blizz to force people to waste their money and double down on their product by throwing bells and whistles that they are basically admitting doesn't add to the cost of the bundle (Because again, its 1 for 1).
---
Yeah, I am the one not thinking with my brain /s &lt;- I really feel like you need this.
---
I am done having this conversation with you. You clearly think blizz can do no wrong, and I am sorry, but talking to fanboys is exhausting.
---
You can also do it right now with a VPN and buying with russian rubel.
---
If people want it they make it.
---
This is an Idea for players who don't wanna spend 10%+ of their income for an expansion and don't use VPNs - so the majority of people.
---
Yes, and guess what? Blizzard doesn't gives a single damn if you are happy or not with it, right? Every single expansion there's a loooooooooot of complain. DUDE, JUST DON'T BUY IT. If they are still doing this bundles is because they are still profitable for them. PERIOD.
---
All the whining just makes you feel stressed and fucked up about the whole situation. Just. Don't. Buy. It. The world won't miss you not keeping up with the game and the millions of whales out there will actually feel even more unique. If you can't afford it, well... that's bad. But a company of the size o Blizz won't hear you. It's almost like begging for Sony to reduce the price of their console just because you can't afford it...I mean...¬¬.
---
Evolve mechanic? 
---
You know you don't have to buy them right?  Surely more options can only be good for players.  A $50 bundle and an $80 bundle is strictly better than if there is just the $50 one.  They can add a $2000 one for all I care.
---
Not to mention the endless hours people have tried "cooking" in the cauldron looking for a secret code.
---
Oh ok makes sense. I did see it downloading in the top right before I played a couple games. Thanks for letting me know!

Hey azurevin, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

---
That’s how these games work.   If the whales don’t buy stuff the game collapses and there is no more hearthstone.  They certainly don’t make the game for free. 
---
You might be right but guessing most players dont have 6400 dust to throw at that on the OFF chance they nerf them.
---
New players, casuals, and F2P players. It was pretty loud right after LOE because new players needed cards from 3 Adventures and dropping $70 was a Big commitment to expect out of all players, as I'm sure the average player Spends little. There was logic there, but Blizzard got the wrong message. New players had too many Wings to obtain right away for Gold to be a viable avenue to obtain them. Essentially, they messed up having three Adventures active in Standard at once. There Were some grumbling about people wanting to craft commons and rares from Adventures before Adventures were Scrapped. Since then, no one has really cheered the end of Adventures and I'm sure the grumblers that killed it either dont play or miss them too.
---
Probably something to do with either sorcerers apprentice or radiant elemental into unstable evolutions ?
---
the sidebar is literally useless here 
---
How are you down 400 gold (think you meant dust) in your first scenario?
---
&gt; If your plan is to craft the Gold version then disenchant it and keep hold of the normal version 
---
That's not the plan; the plan is to hold onto all copies until the nerf.
---
&gt; you'll actually be down 400 gold compared to just disenchanting the normal as planned.
---
This is also not true.
---
Craft nothing, get 1600, disenchant normal, get 400.  Net profit 2000
---
Craft golden, spend 3200, get 3200, disenchant golden get 1600, disenchant normal get 400.  Net profit 2000.
---
So...If you craft golden and just disenchant everything after rotation you end up with the same amount of dust.  The idea is to delay that disenchant just in case there is a nerf.
---
The 80 euro pre-order offer is just insulting to me.
---
I used to pre-order expansion packs but more so to support the developer, I have countless gold from arena runs. But when the offers just started getting worse and worse I stopped, when I saw the new offers I decided that maybe I'm better off not spending any money on the game at all. I'm not supporting the wrong direction they have taken.

All I want is the cardback. I have 14K gold. I have no reason to spend money on packs because I have so much gold. I would pay lots of gold for the cardback.
---
I'm actually waiting till april to see if any of my end of season rewards are golden copies of cards that are getting hall of famed.
---
It is broken because value wise you always got 2 card from 1 card, no matter what you picked. And in reality it help you to have 3rd 4th copy of an strong class spell/miniom because dicover favours class card greatly. Skill testing? Maybe for rank 25 player but 99% player from rank 5 up will have pretty much the same choice most of the time.

There are plenty of reliable apps and if you're not sure which are safe, there's this nifty little thing called google and it can tell you. On the apple store, you're saving those 20 precious seconds of searching in exchange for actually being able to get what you want, for example I don't have to jailbreak my phone to download a gameboy emulator. I've used both and the apple store was made either for children or people who just realized that there's an app store.

"She got me," Lifecoach said of Donais' win over him. "That f***ing Marsh Queen boomed me."

Lifecoach added, “She’s so good,” repeating it four times.

Lifecoach then said he wanted to add Gwent to the list of games he works out with this summer.

Well, Rush is similar to Charge too. These subtle differences allow Blizzard a lot more flexibility with card design.
---
There is a discount bundle.
---
www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/rise-of-shadows-expansion-guide/
---
The "Shadow Bundle." Available the first week of the expansion. 9 packs and an arena ticket (so at least 1 more pack) for $10.
---
Is that great value? Not to me. But it does/will exist.
---
you are on the list of known scammers, and looking at your post history, you seem to posted that you have the quest on this page about 6 times over the past 4 days
---
Assuming you spend any money, the most efficient option from a Packs/Legends/Dust in bank per dollar is paying only for the Solo Adventure, not getting a pre-order.
---
When buying a pre-order, spending all gold on packs is more efficient than using it on the adventure, which is more effecient per $ than buying the adventure.  
---
Buying the pre-order and adventure with money and spending the gold on packs results in the most total packs/cards, but is the least efficient.

&gt;The thing I don't get is when people defend these prices. Activision-Blizz is a company that spends millions on PR, they don't need your help. If Walmart raised prices, would you defend them?
---
Prices don't need to be 'defended' or 'attacked' whether that be Blizzard, Walmart or anyone else.  The company makes a product and sets a price, you decide whether you want to buy it or not.  Everything else is just meaningless bullshit.
---
I really dislike the trend of app icons changing from an actual icon to an icon within a square.
---
It's pointless to dust anything unless Standard ever becomes more enjoyable than Wild.
---
I can see Kibler's Dragon deck he will do this on turn 9 and win because he had to do it for tempo and had no other plays. Coin this on turn nine when you have no other plays and you haven't lost is at least playable.
---
Set 1, introduce 5 villain legendaries.  Set 2, introduce 4 hero legendaries.  Set 3, turn all 9 into hero cards for the final showdown!
---
KFT has deathrattles on your opponent’s turn, and I guess there are two cards with battlecries conditional on having at least 2 other minions on the field
---
&gt; Am I just burned put for doing the same thing for 5 years?
---
Sounds like it. I took a good year off. Stopped following the meta, stopped watching streams, just basically dropped the game. Have come back again and I'm enjoying it as much as I have done in a few years.
---
&gt; Am I reasonable in taking company policy regarding HotS and DI in my consideration about Hearthstone?
---
Yes, it's a perfectly valid thing to consider. Some people won't care, some people will, neither of them are wrong in their view. 
---
&gt; Am I being too critical in thinking the new expansion is not going to add anything new or groundbreaking?
---
Yes because we've only seen a handful of cards. You may turn out to be correct but it's too early to tell.
---
I thought it was a good application, days ago I put more than 10 wild decks and days later I opened the application and now I have none
---
Arena is guaranteed to get you at least 1 pack with the potential of more rewards, so to be honest this is even arguably a better deal than 10 packs for $10.
---
The deal is already expired, check the linked thread in the comment above and the slickdeals page itself for a direct link that would've included the code
---
What do you mean? Lose what? 
---
That's actually a really interesting idea.
---
What's are the differences between the release date and prerelease date? Beautiful job providing all the information concisely btw, for whatever reason it's often difficult to find specific information regarding hearthstone releases.
---
Major board clears rotating out:
---
* Dragon's Fury
---
* Meteor
---
* Psychic Scream (and Shadow Visions)
---
* Reckless Flurry
---
* Spreading Plague
---
* Volcano
---
Not to mention all the smaller cards like Duskbreaker and Spirit Lash, and all the spellstones.
---
A ton of 6/6's is a very challenging board, no matter the meta.
---
Cool, I've always wanted to use Forest Guide. I'll try it!
---
Yeah, I'm inclined to believe its just the iOS client in general is messed up. Other threads on Blizzard's forums are discussing same thing, which I've shared my issues there too.

Yes, technically that's a cartoon picture of MF DOOM, not Dr. Doom.

"You win. It was your destiny." Finally Blizzard acknowledges the fact that many matches are basically a game of rock paper scissors.

Same here (iPhone 6). The same thing’s happened to other people when there’s been an update in the past. It’s kind of sad; I’ve been playing since Old Gods and now I don’t have a device that can run Hearthstone anymore. As the game’s grown, performance on older devices has persistently got worse and worse, and Blizzard hasn’t shown any serious intentions to improve it (as far as I can tell). You’d think they could offer settings for less animations or low-res assets or something, but I’m no developer, so maybe this wouldn’t help. Anyway, I’m sure they’ve done their calculations, and maybe it’s just not cost-efficient for them to keep supporting older devices.
---
You could try sending a ticket to Customer Support, but I wouldn’t hold out much hope for any changes. For me, I think this might finally be my reason to quit - save myself £100 this month. I doubt I’ll ever get back into the game if I miss an expansion. The barrier to re-entry is just too high.
---
I hope this reminds people though, that everything you invest in this game (and many other digital games) can just be taken away overnight. By all means spend as much as you’re happy to, and savour the enjoyment you get out of the game while you can, but don’t expect it to last forever.
---
I don't think they're overhyping it, just saying it's nice to have SOMETHING for a potential counterplay to tech into if/when Maly combos or other spell combos start to run rampant.
---
I'm also a fan of it because it means that Maly and other cards like that are less likely to get the HoF treatment if there is at least SOME counterplay.
---
Deleted after eight games. Took a hunter to take me down.
---
It’s not a pre order. It will be available April 9th
---
Explain what?
---
Because 6 damage board clears are gonna be so common?
---
&gt; Arena should be different from std, imo.
---
I don't know, this new format, if successful, could be infectious.
---
Wandering Monster is rotating out.
---
\^\^ The VS List is what should be used by most players. 
---
Fire Ele's were seeing play before, but a lot of lists have just auto-included them since the nerf to FTT. 
---
It seems to be the most successful approach.
---
You have to use the full card name
---
But hey, it's the funny sex number.
---
Maly isn't a problem card. He's a win condition in a handful of decks every once in a while and more often than not, they are not tier 1 decks. He was a pain in Res Priest recently but that deck is hardly played anymore and is going away anyway. He was never really a problem in Maly Rogue or Maly Druid.
---
&gt; hs is losing a lot of player unfortunately every year  
---
Source please.
---
67,66$ for Russia. I'm not sure, gonna wait for all cards to be revealed. Really love the new hero though.

---
For anyone who tried this deal just now and it's not working for them, I purchased the coins and noticed the discount wasn't applying. I opened a chat session with a customer service rep. They gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience of the coupon code not working. 
---
The difference between EU and US prices is that the EU price includes tax, which I believe is 25% in Denmark?
---
So the $80 should cost $100 including tax, which is just over 88 Euros at today's exchange rate. You're getting it cheaper.
---
And the iPad price is because Apple put a surcharge on it.
---
So you can blame your Government, or Apple, or yourself for not knowing this. But this one isn't Blizzard's fault.
---
Tesspionage. Look into kibler's version. Seems to be the most consistent. Personally, I run a control version, with lab recruiters and stonehills.  
---
Bingo. Old, highly sought after Magic Cards in pristine condition fetch a pretty penny. Newer cards don’t fetch such a massive amount individually, but powerful cards do add up. (I don’t even play Magic, I just marvel at how lucky people who unpacked certain cards and had the foresight to take care of them are)  
---
Says the deal has expired when you click through. Is there no way to add on the code because all digital purchases are 1-click?
---
Now that's a name i haven't heard in a long time. 4 mana buzzard unleash never forget 
---
It wasn't a unrealased legendary that they got. It was one from the already released sets
---
I agree, it hardly seems like something to get excited about.  I thought maybe it would work like... if you control two of a minion, do something, or if you're already cast the spell earlier this game, do something... but no.
---
Bwonsamdi and Talanji
---
Would be even better if you remove Lynessa and replace it with Corridor Creeper
---
Hmm it's quite fishy question. Some of them yes(King Rastakhan, Mecha Jaraxxus) and some of them no(Arthas, Lunara, Maiev, Morgl, Nemsy). As you know you need to do some tasks for opening some characters and you need to pay for other characters. Some or more of them are available in limited time(Sir Annoy Tron, Tyrande, Khadgar) while others are always available for purchase(Medich, Magni, Alleria). According to me, Blizzard will continue to bring a lot of new characters in this way. More money means more cool characters:/ If you take a bright side at this situation, they're all cosmetics :)
---
If you think you did your best and still lost, then why are you complaining? If both you and your opponent play perfectly, the chances of you winning are 35% (as you say though, i dont know exactly the matchup winrate between cube hunter and odd paladin).
---
So, you played to your odds, but still lost. Something completely normal since you are suposed to lose that matchup 65% of the time. By doing the right plays, you will probably increase your winrate against odd paladin higher than 35% unless you are already at high legend ranks, where your opponents are probably not commiting almost any mistakes and therefore the 35/65 will be more exact. And by the screenshot, I see you clearly arent at high legend rank, but still, I will assume your opponent played perfectly.
---
Now, this is when the skill takes place. You either keep playing cube hunter because your overall winrate is higher than 50% and you can climb with it, or you switch your deck because your overall winrate is worse than 50%. Or, you can even tech against odd paladin if you see a lot of odd paladins in your local meta for that day. There is also the chance you didnt mulliganed as good as you could, by keeping a card you shouldnt have keeped or trowing a card you should have kept against this specific matchup.
---
There are so many ways to improve and to win this specific match, yet you still only focus on "he got tarim off stonehill defender". Getting offered tarim is not skilled, yeah. But your opponent managed ot play to his odds and create a situation where he could still win the game, even if his chances were low. He managed to get what he needed and won. He worked for it, and luck just pushed him enough to the victory. Many other odd paladin players can perfectly lose the match even with a tarim from stonehill.
---
You can take what you want from here: You either are better than the players of your rank but lucky pulls like this are what drags you down; or you can accept that there is variance in a game where your opening hand is always randomiced, and that if you take the correct plays (not only in the game but in deck building too) your overall winrate will be higher than other players and you will reach your desired rank easier.

[[slam]]

Puzzle and dragons did offline during the actual dungeons. They would do an check before which loaded up the area and your rewards. Afterwards it would check to see if those were correct or if something suspect happened. 
---
Fair enough 
---
Well the oldest villains that appeared in an hearthstone expansion(adventure) are still missing. Kel'Thuzad and Nefarian.
---
Maybe they are looking for Kel'Thuzad phylachtery in Dalaran

czejar#2781 EU 80 gold trade
---
Buying the single player + the 10$ bundle, will be $30, it'll get you 25 packs, an areana run, and the single player stuff. I'm pretty sure that's what I'll be doing. 
---
Assuming it is the same as it has been in the past, should be when they actually rotate to the HOF, so when the expansion drops.
---
That’s an 80$ meh right there. (Vote with your wallets)
---
Yup, you've sold me.  Although thinking about it, it would be terrible management by team 5 if they wind up nerfing either card later.  If they were going to nerf, they should have done it with this rotation... cause if they do it later they're just refunding dust yet again for these cards.
---
except boomsday had golden for both bundles and still had free,and they said nothing about its removal. So its all in your head.
---
If your asking why the 1 mana spell in your hand didn’t get discarded, it’s because it only goes by the original cost of the spell which is 0 mana
---
what is 575?
---
Not to mention the $20 15+1 pack bundle that comes with a 5 chapter single player game, couple of card backs and Whizbang-like card on top of that bundle.
---
Old Dirty Hagatha
---
So I was playing Tess rogue and have somehow never run into this before. I had an elemental evocation in my hand that I drew from academic espionage, but when he played Skulking Geist, it wasn’t destroyed. Several turns layer I drew a 1-cost Frostbolt. Shouldn’t skulking Geist be targeting these cards, since their mana costs are (1)?? I apologize if this is super obvious, I’ve just never seen this before. Does it only look at the original (non-espionage) mana cost?
---
Combo decks are good when they actually have to play the game. The amount of stall tools in the game is too big right now and hopefully combo decks will have to make meaningful choices just like aggro/midrange/control post-rotation. 
---
Pretty much, the only thing I really like about it is the hero power animation. The emotes themselves are pretty meh, she’s gonna rank low in the BM tier list. The oops one is pretty good though 
---
Quit whining about the deck builder working appropriately.  Put in Lynessa, Steed x 2, and Kings x 2 and watch your buff deck come to life.  
---
Nah it’s not the same, you can actually kill a pally unlike a Druid 
---
Deathstalker Rexxar.
---
People will complain about it being a one-card army against Control (because it is), but making and playing Zombeasts every turn is so. Damn. Fun.
---
Less than a dollar a day though for about an hour of enjoyment a day.
---
I'd pay 25$/month to have access to all the cards for the year. 
---
remember that adventures gives you cards.
---
And what if someone change the code of the card (hs works with a unique code for every cards) and put into a golden baku?
---
Or they could make the reward infinite reloading it everytime with a new token.
---
They can, and blizz could stop them but it's a lot of work.
---
Again, it's not free and activision know that.
---
Not only that, but an offline antihack would be incredibly invasive. 
---
To be fair, it's still much, much cheaper than just about any physical TCG.
---
And what about Paladin, is Sir Annoy-O considered to be Horde?
---
I buy one preorder every expansion and I can make literally any competitive or niche deck I want to. Maybe it's because I play more than you to get more gold? I'm sitting at around 9k gold right now. Do you save your gold?
---
Lmfao top tier reference right here.
---
I'm not sure how to say it without being rude, but you have no idea what you are saying.
---
Imagine this scenario. You click "become offline" on Hearthstone. App downloads your collection and your decks and cuts your connection with the server. You play single player content offline. At some point you click "go online" and the game deletes all of your local data and downloads data that's on the server. The data you may have changed never gets to server.
---
This is possible if you know how to write code just a little bit and I bet Blizzard devs knows that much.
---
They still won't do it because an offline user is not a paying user.
---
If you don’t like it, don’t buy it. I happily did. Simple as that.
---
This is pretty niche, but would shadowform change the hero power animation? Does it change Tyrande’s?
---
That’s fine but if you don’t like this post ignore it. I’m trying to motivate something that matters in the community and you’re half the problem.
---
Here's ya Burfday Present
---
There have been 8 cards revealed so far and zero information given about single player. Jesus. Jump the gun on the salt much?
---
You said it, man.
---
No, cuz it hasnt changed for me
---
This is my favorite change, and I didn't even realize it was. 
---
&gt; The only Boom cards you use.
---
Yes. Bc I mostly use tier 1 decks. Like it's great you made a Kangor combo deck everyone is really happy for you... but that doesn't make it a high power lvl legendary.
---
\[\[redemption\]\]
---
By adding a shit ton of Nomi cards to your deck, his battlecry won't go off until you draw all of them...

can you explain how that is a OTK? all that does is put a bunch of Flame Leviathans in your deck and then draw 1, you would still need to draw the other 14 for it to kill and you're not doing that with shiv
---
It’s a trap dont fall for it! 
---
Geisting Skulker never existed ...
---
Aagainst aggro 4 3/3 on 5 were broken so 7 6/6 should be "ok"
---
I think you're not understanding my point, the problem is not weither it's busted or not, the problem is weither you can counter it or not.
---
The answer right now is no.
---
The compulsion to read its flavor text is overwhelming. 
---
I'm looking for MF Boom.
---
My bad, read it wrong 
---
Post the replay. I'm curious to see how it went
---
Doesn't mill rogue run geist to counter druids? So their own geist would just blow this up when it's played, which is counter productive.
---
The other key is that you would usually shuffle many copies of a creature.
---
2 is enough.
---
Even 1 is enough actually.
---
This card will be OP in Wild
---
ALL CAPS.
---
How?
---
With an anticheat?
---
Come on. It's the same thing, system like this would prevent (99%?) cheats, you are just saying i'm telling the truth lol.
---
These kind of system are expensive, slow to make.
---
Activision, at this time, doesn't care about an offline community. It's more efficient in term of costs, earns and security that everything will remain online.
---
So, useless to complaint about.
---
Rush and Discover are the best added ones. Overkill and Echo are okay. Magnetic and Recruit are lame.
---
&gt; Wasn't Da Undatakah only played in the Hadronox Druid at the start of the expansion? I would call it niche at best
---
That's not very forward-thinking though. It's very clear just by looking at Da Undatakah that it has a very powerful effect. Yes, you can try and schimmy a way in to make it go infinite like Hadronox Druid or Immortal Prelate Paladin (the other deck it saw experimentation with), but Da Undatakah is also just a generally powerful card that, in a meta without Death Knight Hero Cards, Quests, and Genn or Baku, will probably be far more popular.
---
&gt; The problem Kalcegos is it's absurdly expensive and it's not clear if it good enough to fill a spot in a deck with no ramp.
---
It is absurdly expensive, but you're always going to be comboing him with a Spell, that now costs (0). So with a Flamestrike or Blizzard, it's like you're cheating out 6 or 7 Mana -- and suddenly Kalecgos doesn't look so expensive. The Discover effect is also very powerful.
---
Mill style rogue is what I’m hoping for 
---
Bercon#2836 EU. Trading 80g quest. I'll show and you go first, thank you! :)
---
But if you shuffle in more than 1 nomi that wont do anything since your deck will have more cards in it thus not proccing his battle cry?
---
Thats what they want you to think
---
You're not alone. I myself prefer slower decks and I hate playing vs divine spirit + inner fire + silences because the game is pretty much decided on whether I have an answer to a single minion and if I don't then I lose... I'm surprised this degenerate combo is not hall-of-famed yet
---
You can't just ignore the fact that these cards have actually seen tournament play.
---
Wilful ignorance is not an argument.
---
Because /u/TBH_Coron said so.  Now you apologize.
---
NO YOU DO NOT
---
DO NOT WISH THAT CANCER UPON US AGAIN
---
No, it's from Frights of the Thousand Crones.
---
They seem to have just been trying to gauge the value of cosmetics and had no way to measure it other than slapping a random value on it.  I bet if they did anything to improve it they would see interest, be it packs, all three for $20, whatever.
---
Another fine addition to Grease Rogue
---
because it fucking sucked
---
Noomi won’t work with cards in deck tho
---
EVERY YEAR!  
---
&gt; They could be 100 or 10k, i didnt said a number.

You didn't say a number, you said a lot. That's not a lot.

---
ActvisionBlizzard shareholders more acurately.
---
Yes I wish for it’s return so I may experience it. Me want jade rogue&gt;:(
---
Thats what the internet is for right. The deck builder is their specifically help you build a deck out of the cards you own. If u want a strong deck and wanna see what you miss you might as well netdeck and find out that way
---
Well just wait until you draw both of them.
---
You have your hand full so you have things to do anyway.
---
Sprint is pretty slow, and probably dangerous in a meta where players aren't fearful of a Hero Card locking out the game (or Spreading Plague). Auctioneer requires you to build your deck around it to an extent. While the Scheme itself is great in an Auctioneer deck, what does the overall deck list look like if you're doing Auctioneer *and* shuffling? What do you shuffle?
---
No
---
Reconnecting took a big step back for me with one of the recent patches. I'm not sure the latest patch is even back to where it was before it somehow got worse a month or two ago.
---
Not that infinitely. Because of turn limit the maximum level you can have for schemes is 45. If you go first and have the scheme card in your starting hand AND somehow take to turn 45 while not playing this scheme.
---
Sounds like Lab Recruiter is the better fit, then.
---
Uh oh. I dont like this direction. Imagine fighting someone and getting excited they're about to go to fatigue, then it turns out they had kept this in their hand since the first turn and they shuffle 20+ Zilliaxes into their deck. What the hell are you supposed to do then? Ressurect mechanics, copying, "infinite" cards, those things never turn out good. I was looking forward to this expansion but this is a big red flag.
---
I’m seeing a lot of consecutive Chef Nomis coming my way
---
no take candle!
---
Y’all ain’t even explaining why it was so bad I’m sure it was not as bad as hunter now
---
THINK !!! THINK !!! THINNNNNNNNNK !!!!!!!
---
How many minions on your board ? :)
---
THis is AWESOME. A strong, fun card. Prepare to be purged in the greasefire. 
---
That's not card disadvantage.  
---
Gang Up was one of the worst Arena cards ever. This won't be any better. It's a *horrible* Arena card. You don't care about cards in your deck, you rarely go to fatigue or draw through most of your deck anyway.   
---
   
---
This is a trap card that bad players will take expecting MAD VALUE and be disappointed by.  
---
Havent done that before, but I think this is it

What's this 4 mana 3/3 minion that you could play on 5 and it was broken against aggro? I do understand you completely, I just think you are (for now at least) wrong. There are several ways to clear a board once nomi drops.
---
Given the amount of complaints
---
https://www.google.de/search?q=tarim+in+odd+paladin
---
I feel that „pulling it out of my ass“ is a bit harsh. Also, I just did the math with discover and found out that currently there is a 20% chance to get Tarim from Stonehill Defender. Strangely that makes it more okay to lose against it... ;-) 
---
A better poker analogy would have been complaining that someone bluffed until the river and got a very unlikely combination that beat mine while I was „ahead“ for the rest of the game. And I‘ve seen quite professional poker players lose their cool about that - a lot more than making a reddit post. :-)
---
Already had Gang Up on a Stick with Lab Recruiter.
---
can we steal some class legendaries?
---
TESS WE CAN!
---
Once and for all : 
---
1. That's just ONE idea.
---
2. You can wait to draw all of them.
---
Yes. You can craft it any time before the expansion release date.
---
Rogue is the only class that can do this reasonably well so far, and they *already had Academic Espionage.*
---
Plus, I question how powerful such a deck would be, simply because it still seems susceptible to Aggro. Rogue is lacking survivability and with the loss of Elven Minstrel, card draw too.
---
I wouldn't get too worried about this card just yet. It's powerful, but it has nothing to facilitate it right now. There needs to be a couple of good cards to push this archetype forward before it becomes dangerous, imo.
---
Not with an anticheat. Each hearthstone game that is being played is hosted on their server already, which means they have all the information needed to validate any action you take. A completely server-sided game can not be hacked by sending erroneous packets because they will be flagged as such and easily discarded by comparing to the current game state.
---
Wild Mill Rogue got a bit better.
---
But we're approaching some sort of control rogue, imagine shuffling 9 Ragnaroses into your deck.
---
Can anyone else with ios confirm this happens?
---
we be dropping wailing witchwood!
---
To me, in terms of cost, a person that spend 200€ per months that leave it's already too much considering that only few players spend that much.
---
And i'm one of them, i can afford it but it's already 2 months i don't put into hs moneys, because they disappointed me.
---
I believe, however, they are fixing a lot hs problem and i hope they will convince me to pay again, cause i like this game.
---
Now, imagine  300 person that spend that much, 60000€. per month.
---
Ask you to play one more card in a combo deck where you discard a great part of your deck.
---
Gives Rogue infinite value but Rogue already has lots of value and control Rogue has always been a joke.
---

Eh, not really or at least not nearly to this degree. A few could be interpreted that way but overall they only seem sarcastic because they're so often used to BM. But Lazul's is just 100% dismissive and seems almost impossible to use in a positive context.
---
Pogo hoppers are a red herring! Far me re fun is to be had with this card than that mundanity
---
I even have somewhat working murloc mage thanks to the algorithm. 
---
And a feedback to the devs: 
---
Complete my deck also should randomize the deck name. For example “Cube Spirit” for this one. 
---
So...Gang Up basically? Or a little better?
---
Its semi skewed logic Sir, but it checks out.
---
Do you even know what your original point is at this stage? You seem triggered that they rushed out a fix for this. You asked what people get, and yes, the answer is nothing, but the fix wasn't necessarily rushed for PEOPLE. It was rushed out for Blizzard. How is this confusing to you? And when given a plausible explanation as to why they did it, your reply is "I won't talk about this". Then just stop talking. Do you lack conversational skills and everything has to be an argument?
---
actually it's probably an important year, like 2014
---
Agreed, I've been playing a pogo deck since they came out, my gameplan is 100% board control until I can land the face damage for free, and it's often over 20 by that point.
---
/r/whoosh 
---
Ha I forgot that acronym existed
---
My guess would be that in the second Expansion the Roles are revertet, they already said that Lackeys and therefore the Evil Team will grow in Number, Tess could come back as a "Goodguy" Rouge 
---
Opponent has the wrong cardback equipped :(
---
Basically doing anything on iOS crashes the game for me. Trying to create a deck, finishing a online match, solo content, changing card backs, messaging a friend, basically anything. And if my games not crashing the frames drop down to 3 fps and my opponent ends up thinking I’m bming since it’s taking me a whole turn to play cards. Literally unplayable.
---
If you're never gonna play wild or play with wild decks vs friends then I'd say disenchant them. I'm keeping mine just cause I liked them and I might have fun playing with friends with an odd deck some time.
---
I love it, it had the same tratement as new heroes in WOW, nice facelift :p
---
My other opinion is that the game was passing a bad moment so for the 5 year checkpoint they just rebranding the heartstone mark with some ornaments but same core funtionality :p
---
Same happened to me on my Android. Just a glitch, since the update.
---
Nice email boom, good old days of xXx_pUsSYsLayEr69_xXx lol
---
You got less than 15 rares from 15 packs? WITCHCRAFT 
---
The best counter to Stormpike Commando is Stormpike Commando.
---
Well Arcanologist pulls the secret from your deck so... that doesn’t help really 
---
This is actually nuts if rogue gets some proper card draw besides Myra 
---
Not sure if this card will be, but I feel like a lot of these **Scheme** cards are gonna be so broken
---
I'm curious if Valeera will track the upgrades on these if this is played in Wild now... Copies use the original text of the card but the spellstone upgrades would always track as the spells would literally change name/text
---
It’s very unlikely to ever reach the power level of jade Druid.  By design, rogue doesn’t get sustain/healing, defensive cards, taunts, or aoe.  Rogue is a tempo class at heart.  They get single target removal, card draw, and tempo as their strength.  Pogo is better with this card, but pogo rogue will always be hard countered by aggro.
---
That said, it does scare me a little bit that this exists because it could be used as a polarizing control counter similar to quest rogue.  I reallllly hope that’s not the case.
---
The thing is, there are a lot of better uses for that 1 mana. For example...any 1 drop. Something that puts something on the board.   
---
For every 1 match you actually make good use of this, there are going to be tens of other matches where it's a dead card and you'd rather have literally any other card.   
---
Think about it this way. It's a fact that very few Arena matches go to fatigue. But, how many matches wind up in the topdecking stage? Lots more, right? This would be an awful card to topdeck.   
---
It's going to be a 110% awful card in Arena. I'd put money on that. You'll draft it once in a while, because sometimes the stars will align and the other two cards will be worse for your deck, but it should nearly universally be avoided.
---
"You rarely go to fatigue" since when??? Maybe not in rogue but if I'm playing priest or some other heavy control deck I'm considering fatigue in my draft every time 
---
Haven't seen anyone suggest this yet but how about Odd paladin?
---
This is also true of the other cards being moved to the HoF. Big business opportunity; be the oil Barron you’ve always wanted to be. 
---
I'll be happy if they just let me buy the khadgar hero portrait. It's all I want
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Advanced_rulebook#Mana_Crystals_and_mana_costs
---
&gt;  The mana cost of a card has no lower limit. Negative mana costs are displayed as, and use, 0, but help to counteract mana cost increases
---
&gt; (likely dire mole)
---
timber wolf in a history
---
Are you sure about that? Got a great deck when i put in Alexastrasza on my ipad. 
---
It seems significant that it is renewing the mechanic in a different rotational year. But also,  A) it's  easier to use due to being 1 mana rather than 4 and B) gives you control over what you are putting in your deck. Espionage extends your deck in an aimless way, while this version can potentially synergize with other specific cards which "support" the strategy.
---
[[Pogo-Hopper]] is about to get a power-up!
---
Hard disagree there. Sprint is slow, Auctioneer is build-around, Shiv is weak.
---
Pirate draw and Fan of Knives yes. But if you're shuffling 6 copies into your deck you're going to need more than a card cycler, and you may not even be running Pirates.
---
Sprint and Auctioneer may work, but those are big portions of your turn spent *only* drawing. Little board development, survival, or control going on there.
---
i.e. Rogue only has the best card draw in the game if you *only* draw cards, and I question whether that will be good enough against Aggro or Midrange decks.
---
yeah everyones going on about pogohopper and i'm just here thinking a 1 mana shuffler on Tess is gonna be pretty awesome.
---
Although that's true early on, those bunnies become answers of their own pretty damn quick with shadow steps and vanishes.  
---
I’m not seeing any blank portraits, it just crashes literally doing anything. 
---
This card is never played in master's call.
---
Nice guess! That's probably it.
---
So, if there is a broken card you can duplicate it 10-20 times with no effort? WOW.
---
cup#11100, NA, 80G, I show quest, you go first
---
&gt;The sub really likes to push the narrative that Blizz is greedy for selling a product instead of handing it out for free.
---
No one is complaining it should be free. They are complaining it is too expensive. 
---
Obvious difference, and a valid argument about value versus cost. 
---
IMO it's superior after just one turn, 2 for 1 mana is pretty good
---
Completed matches with ToddieJay. Trustworthy player. 
---
I think Skulking existing prevents this from being run too often in Wild.
---
Quest Complete!
---
So best plan here is to buy a golden one and disenchant it?
---
You can get a code from eBay sellers. Kinda overpriced though. 
---
Keep in mind that every class is losing a significant chunk of power. We won't know where Control Warrior will be until the meta settles after the chaos of rotation where the vast majority of high tier decks are vanishing.
---
Sprint has historically been included in fast rogue decks.  Do you remember oil rogue?  It ran double prep double sprint.  Yes, sprint is slow, but as a tempo deck, rogue plays multiple cards each turn and runs out of cards quickly to stay ahead on board.  The idea is that you already have a lead on board at the expense of resources, and then are able to use prep+sprint to refill.  It worked very well in oil rogue and some tempo rogue builds.
---
Heartstone and MF DOOM, what is this a crossover episode of 3 of my favorite things?

4. ???

5. Profit.
---
How good is your Italian?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It’s unfortunate that you don’t get to mandate what people can comment on a public forum.
---
Well he coined out a three drop that didn't even give him an advantageous board state; I wouldn't be too shocked if he had non beast minions...
---
For NA? 
---
Oh shit. I didn't even notice 
---
At last, we're out of his jungle ....
---
He was on the Gwent train. He mentioned some changes to the game that weren't for him. Then he hopped onto Artifact. According to his twitch past vods, he's now trying DOTA Auto Chess.
---
Average gold saved at this point in the expansion for someone not gold positive in arena (most players) is around 7-8k.  
---
Dang. Thanks for checking though!
---
Works for all servers AFAIK. 
---
Tinker#2908 EU for a 80g trade
---
Although a new card could get released that made the scheme effects trigger twice or something along those lines, which would let you get past 45 ticks 
---
Agreed that this is significant for the next rotational year.
---
I would not call this card by any means better than Academic Espionage though. While it is cheaper and has greater synergy, it also *requires* synergy. Say this is the Specialist format and you're (somehow) playing a Control Rogue. Hypothetically, of course.
---
How many cards do you really want to switch out in a Secondary or Tertiary deck to make yourself anti-Fatigue? Because if you go the Shuffle route, chances are you need a solid target to shuffle, and a deck that does that may need a lot more pieces to make it work without being too greedy.
---
Academic Espionage on the other hand can serve as a one-and-done kinda deal. Ten cards in your deck, and they cost (1), which *can* be really powerful.
---
I would call the Scheme and Espionage cards *different,* but not strictly better or worse. I think Espionage is better stand-alone (though you can certainly run it with Blink Fox and Tess if you wanted), whereas the Scheme really wants you to draw it quickly, build it up relatively well, and then use it with a card where redundancy can be pretty strong, or really strong (like Captain Hooktusk).
---
Depends, this only costs one, so in the later game can still be played alongside a big boi
---
Dude, you corrected a typo...
---
But the game still freezes whenever I open the friends menu. 
---
I want Tyrande &gt;:(
---
can you share the decklist ? 
---
Oh! Funny thing they were on the same place!
---
The map's awesome! I've tried to find something like this but never did!!
---
What was your name?
---
Throwing away the quest against aggro when you don’t have any control in your starting mulligan is actually a really good play.

Hey darkshadooo, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
&gt; People on Reddit simply cannot understand that this industry is almost entirely data driven.
---
You meant he data that made Activision Blizzard lose half of its value, fire 700 people, cut corners on everything despite having record revenue? I don't think that data that is driving this is as good as you think it is.
---
The cards in this expansion will remain in standard for the longest amount of time compared to later year of the dragon cards, so if you’re going to pre order any expansion, then I recommend this one. Also this expansion looks like it’s going to be the most impactful one we’ve had since frozen throne, so I’d say go for it if you’re looking to spend money already.
---
The earliest you could play this without coin/prep/ways to cheat it out is turn 9, if it starts in your hand that's 9 violet wurms in your deck, a deck that should have 18 cards left in it now.  Shuffle 9 in that's 27 card, 1/3 of them wurms.  That's a pretty good chance to draw and play them every other turn, which means your opponent has to deal with them every other turn.  It's not the fastest of cards but it is oppressive.
---
It adds it to your deck, not to your hand. Seance gets you a duplicate like Zola the Gorgon, but this card makes you lose card advantage.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
So does it kill someone with 1 HP? Does it kill someone with 1 HP 6 armor?
---
Concede hunter...
---
...The most OP deck to ever exist.
---
Breanni would be a good option to push Beast Hunter without enabling Master's Call even more. Houndmaster, Houndmaster Shaw, and Breanni would all be good reasons to begin running Non-Beasts.
---
But, Master's Call is still a super powerful card, so whether that ends up working or not is yet to be seen. Seeing as Hunter is losing Dire Mole and Crackling Razormaw, it's quite possible though.
---
Found the Blizzard Employee 
---
I personally would craft both cards just to have them in the collection for future uses in wild
---
If his opponent turn 3 Animal Companion'd Misha, I think he dropped Dire Wolf, Coin, Springpaws. 
---
All of these knitted murlocs should make a deck together 
---
They had him steeple his hands a bunch of times because thats what EVIL people do.
---
It's funny.
---
This is really cool, and gives an idea of areas they have yet to explore. I would really love an expansion that focuses on Pandaria, as well as one that focuses on Kul Tiras, Zandlar and Northern Kalimdor or the islands off Kalimdor. 
---
Why yes. Infact it's an already existing mechanic. If your total HP reaches 0 or less, you'll die irrespective of the amount of armor you have. 
---
What will survive after the rotation
---
Is there a link? It sounds odd to me that they'd HoF a huge portion of a set.
---
I think I disagree with you that this will be as bad as Gang Up in Arena. Just drafting one of these can nearly guarantee you win a fatigue game. You can craft a good arena deck with this as a "tech" card to give yourself 10 extra cards in every game. Not saying that this will be "good" per se, just better.
---
I think it's more like [[Enrage]]. It's just kind of unnecessary. Look at [[Extra Arms]], that very well could be a twin spell, but also the card itself can just say what it does instead of having to use a keyword. 
---
^don't
---
Noooo I forgot one 
---
Yeah, then you'll only have gang up, the two mana gang up minion, Sonya, and shadow dancer to worry about.  
---
It doesn't mean they moved the most units, it just means the units the sold made more money. Coke could sell more bottles at 1$, but if they would lose less than 50% of sales at 2$, they'd charge 2$.
---
I am sorry for that, but it was actually a typo..
---
Very dangerous card. It can broken the game. Let's hope it will be just a good card.
---
You dont get to choose which card rat pulls. You dont get any benefit from the battlecry. They dont have to remove your minion (you've clearly never played wild) and rat doesnt draw you a card. You lost a card and any benefits it provides. 
---
Myra's unstable into chef nomi and this

But this part is true tho...
---
&gt; 10-30 packs for around $15-20?
---
How would you feel about 15 packs for $20?  Because that option exists.  It's the regular price of packs.
---
Ahhh ok thank you. 
---
There may still be some interesting new minion interactions with Twinspell, e.g. Battlecry: the next spell you cast this turn gains Twinspell. Or a Legendary: your spells have Twinspell.
---
&gt; Jade on crack.
---
Real crack, though. It's going to be like homeless Jade with no teeth and respiratory problems.
---
Jade Spirit =&gt; 2 minions, immediate buff
---
This thing =&gt; 0 minions, no buff until you draw and play the copies
---
Once upon a time there was a streamer called Strifecro. He gave some dank fist bumps. 
---
that card sure will be fun
---
Lmao it's a video game you freaking mook.
---
What - Arena is changing?  You have to have golden version of a card to use it in Arena?
---
I must say I did that error in the past but not anymore, so I felt quite sad I actually pressed double o. Anyway thanks for the advice on the account! I guess I will have to create a new China one, otherwise laggy moments coming..
---
Hasn't it always been like that?
---
absolutely certain. I thought the same the first time, but I made sure I wasn't for the others

In general, but like I said, Apple will occasionally give a discount if you load your account through iTunes or the App Store. Costo, Walmart, and staples have also had deals in the past. I dont see any current deals but check every couple of days and I’m sure something will come up before launch day.
---
And now it's floating over the Broken Isles.
---
What, you mean the new card? How so?
---
[On my Android devices](https://imgur.com/a/hlJFDZT), it's 1.89GB for two devices and a 86.74MB on one! I think that one's misreporting the actual space used.
---
Dragon's Fury is broken, despute extreme restrictions. I'll take my Excavated Evil any day. If you've ever played control, you'd know cards sit in your hand regularly. Especially the reactive ones.
---
Well yeah, that's the question: are scheme upgrades coded as transforms or enchantments? Thank you for expanding on it via examples lol.
---
Interestingly enough this is coming in when both Valeera and [[Mana Bind]] are both rotating out of Standard so that makes the question even more compelling as to how this would work.
---
Thanks

If you read the first sentence then ignored the rest, that makes YOU look like an idiot. He explained himself pretty well, but your only response was to quote *one sentence* and pretend the rest didn't exist.
---
Alright so in my current position when the new expansion comes and like the rotation happens all my decks are going to be unplayable should I disenchant them and then wait for the meta to settle and then craft a tier 1 or tier 2 deck? By the way i'll also get the 1600 dust from baku so I'll have around maybe 3000+ if I disenchant all my decks and some legendary I don't need.

Or an xbox remote..

The OP shows how you can farm downvotes on this sub, take notes nubs

Thank you. I’ll try this and see if it works for me. But it’s weird because I don’t have a touchscreen
---
in the form of a keyword too hard to balance, and thus never used again. Even joust is used more than inspire and recruit outside their dedicated expansions. 
---
&gt;IS ABSOLUTELY a video game. 
---
 
---
This is such a literal argument and misses the point. It isn't a *traditional* video game. 
---
When you bought Mario for NES, you payed ~$100 and got a full game. You played it over and over, and that was it. 
---
Hearthstone isn't like that. The idea isn't to pay $80 and get "all the content". Just like with Magic the Gathering, you don't spend some amount of money so you can "own all the cards".  
---
Hearthstone follows all the rules for buying cards that traditional CCGs do. They have packs, decks, etc. You shouldn't play hearthstone expecting it to be efficient or cheap to own *every* card, because that isn't the point. The point of the game is to play one deck vs another, the goal isn't to "complete your collection" like you would complete a game like Mario.
---
It looks like central Kalimdor, Northern Kalimdor, and Outland could use some love.
---
I don’t have a touchscreen and I have this bug as well
---
You got plenty of notification on the adventure pricing model (it was announced a couple of weeks ago, and won’t release for another 2 months) so plenty of time to either save gold, or save the $20.
---
And the bundles are not MUST have purchases. If you want to purchase them, that’s your choice, as it is their choice on pricing model and whatever they want to include with them.
---
I’m not applauding them, or defending them, but IT IS their business model, I as a player can either buy it or not, that’s my choice.
---
Since I live in Venezuela and my country is going through a major crisis, I can’t, and it sucks. Specially when they are locking new alternate heroes behind huge paywalls, but it is what it is. I’m not crying about it. Neither should you.

---
Dude r45 tears through people with barrel and mag attachments
---
I'm not a mill rogue expert but most lists on HSreplay don't even run 2 gang up. Their run bran, 2 lab and 1 gang up (sometimes 2 gang up, sometimes 0 gang up).
---
Except Pogo-Hopper is a 2 cost minion, Bwonsamdi draws 1 cost minions.
---
Maybe try wild with your old deck ? 
---
Exactly. Saying "you're defending big evil company" is such a bullshit argument. 
---
The thing they're arguing is "if you don't like it, don't buy it". If you complain on reddit about it, then go and buy it, Blizzard doesn't care. They got your money. According to them, you just voted with your dollar that this system works. 
---
And surprise surprise, expansion after expansion, reddit complains and yet still buys them. And every expansion, Blizzard uses a very similar strategy. 
---
All of those complaints sound related to your phone's performance rather than the game's. What are you using?
---
Priest is evil? I know we all hate "wow", but it's Anduin, the golden boy of human race. 
---
the deck is limited to 60cards, so even if it was, that would not be a problem.
---
&gt;how do most people start a new hs expansion and like how do they get ready for all the new cards and decks?
---
I save all of my gold between expansions to spend it all on packs the day new expansions come out. This comes with a number of small benefits.
---
After that, I play with what I open for a week or so while I wait for the meta to start taking shape so I can know what is safe to craft. I don't waste my dust experimenting in the unsolved meta or crafting untested decks. I also don't disenchant *anything* until I have an immediate and specific need for that dust. That includes duplicates. The only time I disenchant something without a need for the dust is when cards are nerfed. Holding onto duplicates can help here since you can end up earning a lot more dust than you would have if you disenchanted those cards immediately.
---
For rotation like what we're about to experience, I make sure to have the most valuable assortment of Hall of Famed cards for my situation. I wait until I'm sure I won't be opening any more packs of the sets those cards come from just in case I open any of them. When I'm sure, I craft what I'm missing in gold so I can get the best refund.
---
I don't play Wild since I don't care for eternal formats, but I don't automatically disenchant Wild cards just because. When I'm in need of dust, I prioritize disenchanting cards that will have the least impact on how I play the game.
---
If you're still getting established as a F2P player, do what you can with what you have as you continue to grow your collection and resources. It's definitely possible to increase your collection over time, even with Standard rotation. You just have to stick with the game and manage your resources well.
---
MF Doom is such an underrated rapper . Found him through a suggestion in youtube after listening to my fav album of all time Binary Star - Masters of The Universe.
---
Don't most in wild use like really op decks? I don't think any of my decks are fit for wild lol. Plus I don't really have a big collection so I can't improve my decks anyways I could try it and see how it works out.
---
No, wild just isn't a priority. Doesn't mean Blizzard totally haAaatEs wild.
---
Lol? I've been infinite in arena since beta and have hit top 100 multiple times.
---
Not really. Record revenue but not profit. In fact, they had problems with the profit which lead to all the issues they had.
---
&gt;they offer are insulting for a card game of all things
---
Lol what? compared to a game like MtG, Hearthstone is extremely cheap. This deal gets you 1$/pack, Now MtG costs 4$/pack. 
---
And with Magic, the only way to get big important cards is to spend $20-$50 dollars on that *single card*. In Hearthstone, you just get enough dust to craft it yourself. In magic, your "dust" is selling shitty cards like lands for a couple cents, and that isn't sustainable at all.
---
I am not crying ... you are crying. I miss u Ben Brode

They said it was based on actual games played data, same as what hsreplay does (except blizz has the data from EVERY game, not just the few thousand people who opt into hsreplay).

Is there any plans to add a system where the deck builder will make a deck including cards you don’t have but do have the dust to craft?
---
How do you get the most bang for your buck with pre orders? From my understanding you get the exact opposite from most games. You pay extra in most cases for a useless cosmetic item and run the risk of the game being a flop because you didn't even get to see it's reviews. (Star Wars Battlefront 2 was the last preorder ever for me)
---
Especially in the case of AAA games, most of the time you wait a few months and you can get the entire game plus DLCs for the same price or less than the pre-order price.
---
As for Hearthstone, you may get some extra packs and a skin but that comes at the price of not knowing the full card list or even the new mechanic introduced before you pay.
---
Without interfering with your draw pool
---
The wild west of week 1 of a new expansion will be his only chance to shine, use it wisely 
---
You got what you wanted.
---
forbidden mechanic is super restricting on when you can play it, by forcing you to play it last, so i dont see it outright replacing it.
---
Personally I don't mind boring keywords. Twinspell as a keyword is very boring, just like Rush as a keyword is very boring. But that means there's a lot of flexibility in card design that uses these keywords.
---
The Forest's Aid is honestly a solid example to me of an interesting card -- notably because of its power level. It's two board threats in one card to risk Savage Roar, alongside great Treant synergy (looking at you, Mulchmuncher).
---
Basic/boring design does not necessarily make the cards that use the mechanic boring.
---
I knew it was a visual error but not what caused ut, so thanks for explaining! 
---
Wow look at me maining Rogue now
---
still weird that they didn't set it to auto sort out Baku
---
A, B, C sure. D? No
---
To each their own. I avoid buying packs at the start of the expansion because the first month of a new expansion is the most prime time to play Arena. 
---
By the end of the first month I have a mountain of packs from Arena to open for when I want to start playing standard.
---
This is really good stuff man, please do more
---
Recruit is not used *as a keyword,* but do remember that Y'Shaarj, Captain Hooktusk, and Finja are all examples of cards in other expansions that have nearly identical functionality to Recruit (the difference being that those cards summon the minions to the right of them, whereas Recruit always summons minions to the right side of the board).
---
Plus, both Recruit and Inspire both had their healthy mix of powerful cards:
---
Thunder Bluff Valiant
---
Nexus-Champion Saraad
---
Call to Arms (when nerfed)
---
Oaken Summons
---
Oh I'm sure that's the case, I just thought it was a funny implication I hadn't noticed before.

For weirder/less good decks like buff pally and dragon pally (as well as minion mage, discard Warlock, and token druid) it won't build those decks for you. What you want to do is build most of the deck yourself, and if you don't know what else to add, then use auto fill.
---
I've seen a lot of people acting like it is
---
One of the best posts here. Simple but interesting. Would love to see more!
---
Thanks! I will! Sadly I don´t know anything about the wow lore, It could be even better with the knowlage!
---
Thanks! I will for sure! :-)

Arguably Classic &amp; Basic sets could be located in the capital cities like Orgrimmar, Stormwind, Ironforge, Undercity, etc.

This comment is pure gold

That's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the pogogeists simply freeze to death.
---
Try a simple google search for Hearthstone Hall of fame. 
---
Or, just all the cards from witchwood that havr an if you have all odd or even card effects.
---
Be sure to craft em all. 
---
It’s okay man do what you can, already love the content
---
What the fuck dude, that guy needed EXACTLY that card to win
---
Well she'll be sorted out very soon along with Genn ;)

I may be naive but blizzard is apparently not wasting time to fix bugs for once :

They're not charging $80 for a Hero Portrait, and it's ridiculously silly for you to try and frame it that way.
---
I´ll, don´t worry! I love creating something, that is interesting for the community! :-)
---
Also, BM.  People BM you so you know they're real people.
---
Such a wonderfully social game...
---
As someone into statistics and Machine Learning, I'd love to see how you guys do this behind the scenes! I can't imagine it's simple, considering some of these bugs. 
---
Glad to see Hearthstone implementing this technology in their game, it definitely isn't the usual test case. 
---
Damn that was quick. Good job
---
I really like the smart deck builder and hope it can work decently with smaller sample sizes for the memedeck community :).
---
Could we one day get some more detailed insight into it's fubction that would be really interesting and helpful for using it correctly. 
---
So for example, I put Lynessa in my deck and autocompleted it and it built me a constructed Odd Paladin deck with two Blessing of Might as the only buff spells.
---
Like, I get that Odd Paladin is best performing deck on ladder and shoving Lynessa in it with no variation might be the "best winrate deck", but that wasn't really the direction I was hoping the deckbuilder would go.
---
I didnt even know that was a thing, and it sounds amazing.
