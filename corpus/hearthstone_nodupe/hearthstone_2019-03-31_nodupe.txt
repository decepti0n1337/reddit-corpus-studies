So we might end up with a generic minion like "Aranasi Broodmother" or something :/

I don’t play enough Hearthstone as that I would recall such things, but I am fairly certain if you would search for it it is there.
---

---
Dollmaster dorian's value!
---
This makes me really glad ice block is not in standard.
---
But what blocks it from being Tier 1 tho ? If we break down the most broken decks right now we have to deal with Priest(wall and dragon control) both will loose a lot, for wall priest: psychic scream,oakheart,tarcreeper,spellstone and shadow visions. That are the key cards for this deck. Hunter looses Rexxar which is kind of a one man army at some point. Odd paladin looses baku. Odd mage too. That's all of the tier one decks rn just demolished.
---
Yes, I believe so.  It is very near Hackettstown
---
Johnny/Mel player here, for one, I don't think you quite get how these player types work, Johnny players enjoy playing elaborate combos and synergies while Mel players like intricate interactions and niche cases such as getting a shudderwock with a undatakah deathrattle that has a carnivorous cube and an immortal prelate. (which does in fact keep the deathrattle of the cube by the way). I would never run Millhouse or temporus unless it's specifically with a combo or interaction to let me profit off of it such as seeing how the turn timer works if you play a temporus on your first extra turn (Which skips the second turn and stacks the effect giving you 3 turns in a row after your opponent goes) or with a time put in paladin allowing me to OTK them with it. 
---
That being said, the deck builder is perfectly fine, considering that Johnny, Mel, and Vorthos players are far more likely to build there own deck anyways, as they are the more creative of the bunch, as well as the fact that it gives them an opportunity to challenge yourself by purposefully putting subpar cards in your deck and trying to win with that / seeing how the deck builder responds, such as Baku Priest 
---
Yeah, I don’t agree with it either, but their reasoning is basically that it would be too confusing for new players. 
---
Happy feast of Winter Veil!
---
AYE I live in Hackettstown/ Long Valley fam. I drive by there everyday while going to Golds Gym. I’m hype to see my town represented
---
I like Barnes significantly more in this version. Previously he looked way too high rolly (like a 33% chance to hit anything useful) but it looks closer to 50+% now. (at work glancing on mobile) 
---
 Kaj#1240 on EU looking to trade the 80g quest. I'd like you to go first please.
---
They will probably activate with the first pack from the set you buy/open
---
Bybee is the only aranasi that is yellow though (like the card art preview). It would be amusing if Blizzard intended to make Sael'orn and messed up with the color. And true, Sael'orn would make much more sense to be printed since this is a Dalaran expansion
---
Wasnt this nerfed when it was illidan? Now it costs way less?
---
A mulligan for 2 mana?  Love it 
---
Since you generally keep cards that are situational but powerful, and combo pieces in your hand, forcing a control or combo deck to shuffle their cards into their deck on like turns 8-15 or so could be devastating.  It's not like you are giving up random cards, the opponent is losing cards that they've specifically chosen to hold on to.

I thought it was rogue. 
---
Thanks for posting!
---
Wish I wasn’t hearing about it last minute though. Is there a site that posts all of these tournies? 
---
Sure. Tho it’s pretty clear the real intention is to be playing both these cards together, with the end result being 10 mana for a 5/7 and clearing your opponents board and getting a new hand for yourself. 
---
That’s in an ideal situation, mind you. 
---
He is a streamer and YouTuber who primarily plays wild with unusual and fun decks. He is really entertaining. He plays a lot of decks with deathrattle in their core and it’s kind of a meme on his channel.

I wouldn’t doubt it, especially considering how they messed up on the Malygos and Stampeding Kodo art.

DRAW MONSTER CARD
---
Thank you for the amazing list! Will save this comment for my expansion prep early April.
---
Not really the same diff, considering it’s rotated
---
I hate it when my dice randomly explode.
---
Winslow Tobtock could do this as a Monster Hunt boss.
---
The idea is that people will feel compelled to buy heroes that are limited offers if they think they can never get them again. It's the principle behind every limited run of anything really. If they give people the option of getting them later on, then you are no longer forced to consider whether you want to spend 80 bucks now on a preorder or never get the hero. 
---
*One* of Yu-Gi-Oh’s versions! Don’t forget about Magical Mallet!
---
Truly a neat card. Although Al'akir really isn't a great reward when you see how difficult it is to fulfill the requirement. Definitely fun though. 
---
Very much so. Every new mechanic has a flipping 1 mana burn spell attached to it.
---
We had deal 1 damage for R (red mana), but pay 4 to return it to your hand.
---
We had deal 2 damage for R.
---
We had deal 3 damage for R.
---
We had deal 3 for RW (one red, one white), heal 3.
---
We had deal 3 for 2R, or pay R and it casts at the beginning of your  turn two turns from now.
---
We had deal 1 for 1R, and 1 more for every other spell you played this turn (targets chosen individually)
---
We had the exact same thing as the card above, but it goes face.
---
We had deal 3 to face for 1BR (1, 1 black, 1 red) and make them discard two...
---
That's just off the top of my head. Plenty more.
---
Wow. Same rarity, class AND mana cost. Well played sir, well played.
---
Your proposed change would be quite a buff obviously. I understand that it’s not fun being restricted by this 1/9 hard counter mechanic, but honestly I would rather have decks like E-Spionage don’t become truly viable, playing against that just feels awful when they get their rng right.
---
Yet another card we won't have to see on /r/customhearthstone anymore 
---
He needs to enter the blizzard shop, and get it. Absolutely free.
---
From my spotty Greek and Latin...

Does your name mean "the feeling when you are in your head" or something like that?

Deathwing + Sinestra = Nyxondra

Nyxondra + ? = Wrathion.

This is insanely powerful for combo decks or decks with a ton of high cost minions

&gt;Opponent Recruits. 
---
Since it's implied that it's *your* opponent, not someone else's opponent
---
A minion hitting a hero?? What?
---
He died after hitting the hero.
---
It's the worst reasoning of all time, but there is some logic to it
---
I think the right way to change it would be to make it "The pleasure is yours" - now THAT would fit her character much better, as in - she wouldn't just greet someone with "pleased to meet you".
---
He hit you right? Was he forced to with misdirection and you had a weapon? Its not a bug, when a weapon is equiped your hero has that much attack but only on your turn.
---
I still can't see Hunters as the good guys tho...
---
This pleases my OCD!
---
Also I wonder if that *small indie company* actually split them that way on purpose because they had no idea where some classes should go. Like, priests and hunter feels like they're in the wrong team, don't they? (Note that I don't know much about the WoW lore, but I did watch a few WoW videos and priest - Anduin - is definitely not Evil... Unless he changed side or something, anyway).
---
Just from looking at new cards so far and how they might interact with witchwood and other expansions not rotating;  
---
Bomb hunter, bomb warrior, big spell hunter, zoolock (always in the meta), beast Druid, treat Druid, clone/copy Druid, fatigue paladin, fatigue lock.
---
It’s super dead if you draw half or more of your combo tho, so it being in control is more likely.
---
Windfall is good because you dump your hand on turn 1/2 and then draw based on your opponent's hand still being full. This is a totally different card in context.
---
Over half the class cards released and 3 sets still in action, predicting archetypes and metas isn't so far fetched
---
Interesting take! Why fatigue paladain and warlock? 
---
You might as well just say, because the other new cards in the arena were absolutely broken/snowball and you just wanted to draw them as soon as possible so that you could play them before your opponent could.
---
Well, if it stays like that more than 4 hours...

I agree with you. I’m hyped for the adventure part of this expansion, not the cards.

But brode told me no more dupes T-T
---
That's... Not how probability works...
---
The choice was made when many people both here and in the reviews consistantly complained about the size of the app.
---
This is just a -1. Why would anyone think this a good card.
---
Brode cant save you now
---
Absolutely never as a playable card, but I could see there being some secret interaction in an adventure like karazhan that gives you this card (like in the fight with dorothee). Also, there's a sub dedicated to custom cards, /r/customhearthstone , and a website where you actually make your card ideas into reality [here](hearthcards.net)
---
Very close but nope!
---
This with the new warlock legendary makes a lot more sense now. Easy 2 card combo.
---
Each missile has 3 possible targets. 1 out of 3 five times
---
April 9 new cards come in and three sets rotate out. Un’goro, KFT and K and C. Nobody really knows what will be good at that point. 
---
r/catapultmemes
---
I think you guys are missing that this is obviously a joke. 
---
Windfall is *way* better because you can dump your hand while your opponent's is full and just get way more cards
---
Honestly magma ragers art  is more relevant to the card effect than the regular one
---
Probably because otherwise stolen steel would be too unreliable to see play.
---
Thanks, I'll check it out!
---
Plated Beetle, Stonehill Defender, Gnomeferatu, Hadronox
---
Wait, how does it combo with Hakkar? It makes *you* draw more corrupted bloods.
---
I've strayed far from the central finite curve myself.
---
That's good.   Nice to see some improvement s
---
Yea I’m done calling cards before they are released this expo. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, I umm... can’t get fooled again.
---
Which is funny because it’s so fucking garbage in hearthstone 
---
Dude. It was played in Tier 2 and 3 decks. That's an objective historical fact. Go check old meta reports if you like. The fact that you don't think it should be playable doesn't change the fact that it was played. I can't believe you're trying to resurrect this debate.
---
I'm not claiming it was incredible, but it was playable. Not even just in meme decks. Control Warlocks ran it as an anti Control tech card. That happened. Get over it.
---
I noticed that today.

---
Excuse a drinking man.
---
Because digging/fixing is powerful and literal cards in hand is far less important than relevant cards in hand. Seriously, people place way too much emphasis on literal cars advantage and not nearly enough on relevant card advantage, or 'virtual' card advantage. If you have a Firefly token in hand and your opponent has Bloodreaver Gul'dan, you both have the same amount of cards in hand, but you're clearly not on even footing.
---
A card like this gives you chances to dump bad hands and replace them with potentially good hands. While you go -1 in number of cards, in the right decks it will still increase the value of your hand.
---
I think my late game drops should transform into cheap AOE spells when matched up against aggro.
---
Hes whittling it
---
All of the nerfs in RKR and even Boomsday were pretty questionable.  It's still hard to wrap my head around 4-mana Equality.
---
And as a Spell Hunter player, I am sad that they had to nerf the Spellstone Hunters just so Midrange Hunter could run unopposed.
---
Thanos butthole
---
Its actually more than 1/1024 bcos the way you calculate disregards the fact that when a missile hits one of the 1-1s, it cant hit it again
---
While I don't think anyone here would disagree with you, I do think it is noteworthy that the cost, rarity, and class of the card were correctly predicted as well.
---
cant wait to get that in my tesspionage
---
With Highmane, art makes sense but being called NINE lives and not having a 9 tailed fox as one is a missed opportunity haha
---
Thank you for that. That was hilarious 
---
I think Shrivallah OTK Paly will be one of the best decks for the first few weeks until things settle down. Just because its one of the only decks that doesn't get rekt by rotation and its getting more heal.

Fire fly, saronite chain gang, unstable evolution, lich king.
---
What can I say, I like shaman and a healthy amount of RNG.

Because that's how many card reveals are done now. Blizzard sends streamers a puzzle box containing a physical copy of the card and they work on it (and later mostly break it) live on stream 
---
80g q BelDeMoose#2741 on EU
---
Yeah, but what about new accounts that never existed during the time KnC was in standard? Accounts not created druing Kharazan years don't get Kharazan first encounter without buying anything, or do they? I legitimately don't know. It's a tough one to guess.

For context here's a few Magic cards that have been printed in recent years that were not especially broken:
---
* [This card, but you also deal damage to something equal to the number of cards you're holding.](https://scryfall.com/card/kld/114/fateful-showdown)
---
* [This card, but you can do it again from your discard pile later.](https://scryfall.com/card/dka/104/shattered-perception)

* [This card, but it stays on the battlefield and if you can remove it you get the original cards back as well.](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/40/induced-amnesia)
---

Has anyone noticed a huge increase in whiny bitches in this sub ? I sure did.
---
It would've been in my truck after the pic.
---
Silver vanguard has good synergy with KT when it pulls KT from the deathrattle
---
Pretty sure that was an acutal deck sa a youtuber paly it a year ago or so. Dragonhawk , Direfrenzy, 5 mana dude that draws 2 1/1 from your deck. % mana 2/5 hunter biest that gives your beasts charge eas Money.
---
RNG is a part of Hearthstone. HS is not Magic. End of story.
---
Unfortunately there's just no other decks that makes Blood playable and competitive. I had a 1 golden Blood in my collection not doing anything for 3 years waiting for that day. And now I can very consistently hit my opponent with 30/30.
---
Yeah my bad sorry I meant high legend has in like 5k. 
---
There are "good" warlocks, they just tend to be doing the good thing for selfish reasons.
---
Far Sight -&gt; Elektra 
---
I think if more burgle cards are revealed they will replace  the weaker cards in this deck so don't worry. Cutable cards are SI-7 agent and Tess. Don't worry though burgle rogue may not be new but it's a lot of fun and the new cards really shine in this deck.
---
I believe there is one instance ever of Anduin using shadow magic in the Jade Forest in WoW. He is capable of it, but it doesn't seem to be something he favors.
---
Nefarian didn't create Core Hounds. They are a product of the Firelands.
---
I dont understand this sentiment against hunter? I would honestly consider odd paladin and odd warrior as the most brain dead decks out there.
---
Might as well play a slot machine.
---
She pushes that guy to the portal lol
---
Why?
---
No, it's a waste of money period. 
---
If you're going to buy the pre order for the extras your best off waiting until just before release. 
---
Why spend money now to get nothing when you can spend that money later to get the same thing?
---
You get the rush tho and u can trigger deathrattles with this
---
That seems quite wrong. It's a 25% chance for the very first tick to hit the turtle, let alone all 5.
---
You can muddle to rank 10 with whizbang which is premade standard decks..
---
Ring ding ding, oh look, hit the jackpot! 1 mana Tyrantus!
---
This is the worst kind of randomness as it eliminates most of the validity of tactical decisions from the opponent. Anything can show up.
---
Yiu can't do that each turn because you need to draw the cards between turns aswell.
---
I wish it had 'If you control all 4 basic totems, summon all 4 elemental lords'. OP as hell, but at least then it'd be a combo people would actually consider building around. Each totem represents each of the elements too so it would make sense thematically. They'd also have to add Therazane. 
---
"He recruit"
---
Done with kappaklaus thanks
---
You play a mechathun type game with cycle minions into empty deck. Your hand is betrug, plot twist, 2x rocketeer, Leroy, wolfrider, 2x argent commander. Play betrug then plot twist to draw them = 27 damage.
---
Please stop immediately, children play this game.
---
Keep your money.
---
Some people want to use Lazul instantly
---
Yessss, the approach doesn't have much value for the player until the player owns all 10 variants, and only if the player likes legacy formats. You should see a sharp increase in your enjoyment of the first set of a new rotation the instant they give up on Classic and start making a new base set every year out of reprints.
---
Too expensive. 
---
This is likely, though if the second warrior or rogue legend is as situational and dependent upon its set as the first, then it basically has to be a neutral they handmade for this promotion. We'll see.
---
This is the beauty of discover cards. Cards that would never be run get to shine in certain situations. Reminds me of how it was sometimes good to grab Temporus off of Netherspite Historian against some Warlocks
---
Wonder if using it with the draw/discard card would disable the discard part.
---
Knowing that all expansions this year are linked, I bet we’ll see him again soon.

small indie company
---
Their design philosophy has changed since the nerf to Fiery War Axe. There are very few ways to kill an OP 1 or 2 drop *other than* another 1 or 2 drop. Solution: just make weaker 1 and 2 drops.
---
Of course this is probably cyclical. Blizzard printed fairly weak midrange cards for a while and now the latest set seems to push the midrange style. Eventually they will print good 1 and 2 drops to change things up
---
I have 100 packs with gold
---
The 50 pack bundle just doesn't give me $50 of value
---
Except rexxar dealt with emeriss, two yseras, multiple 8/8s, a mecha'thun, garrosh, and even fatigue by shuffling and lifestealing. It's far too much by any standard and I think everyone knows it really. Just like jaina the game will be better off without infinite value generators which require zero set up or skill to use. 
---
NANI!?
---
Fel lord + plat twist is good. even without KT.
---
You have to play kel second so the pic is right. End of turn effects are in order of play. 
---
&gt;you have to play KT before the spell or you could end up in a situation where  
---
...you've shuffled your KT into your deck with your hand.

Well you can get 1 mana twisting nethers, hellfires, defiles, etc... How is that any different?
---
You should just not play OTK priest.
---
So where's the whole deck list?
---
Or priest in general. They tend to get their board clear in the last expansion of a year, and are really good 1/3 of the time.
---
Omg its someone playing an aggro deck. I must hate on it immediately.
---
I assure you, he is as bad as me: Branching Paths, Spreading Plague, Ultimate Infestation. It was a fair fight.
---
Try r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
I have an only warrior account and going for one class is a good idea. If you just play Shaman you can always find a deck to climb with or at least have fun with. Its never a bad idea to stick with a class and since rotation is here you can find a deck and just craft only cards in that deck. Dont disenghant Shaman cards but any other class, dust it
---
You're either trolling or thick, either way blocked now.
---
How many KoFT packs have you opened so far? Have you gotten any legendaries from them?
---
All these combo counters coming out .. and we've had one all along. 
---
Time for some dollmaster dorian warlock.
---
It was the most enjoyable concede I've ever been a part of
---
Yeah, a man can dream. But Kiblers builts of Tess rogue saw some success and I think it only improved.
---
Rotation alone doesn't fix its main problem which is how it's unable to consistently build threats that stick on the board and hit hard. As of now, relying on buffs to Mechano-Egg is too slow and failing to buff smaller mechs dillutes your pool too much so it becomes counter intuitive to play aggressively.
---
Actually probably not as shuffling smaller cards into the deck, as well as if [[Duel]] hits Madam Goya then you have a big problem
---
Id stray away from Silverhand Recruit stuff and towards Equality or Shrink Ray
---
Well clearly not Shudderwock

     the final reveal stream will be on april 3rd with chris sierra, brian kibler and dean ayala, and the expansion releases on april 9th :)

This. I literally just watched that same video.

Fuck rank 2 its only Deathrattle Hunters and i play Odd Warrior so its cancer. I switched to Rush to counter it but its just annoying
---
When quests first came out and quest mage was popular, hydrologist discovering eye for an eye was THE win condition for paladins. They didn't run any meaningful burn, and the mage's freeze and AOEs meant that only weapon damage was connecting to face. Eventually, the mage would end up at 1 with an ice block up and full combo in hand, but no way to pop two eye for an eyes, and would die.
---
Ok I can see that, but cut Time Out for Equality

Betrug is summoned by skull at the start of your turn. 
---
Or deadly shot, or adapt a 1/1, or hunters mark, or push through it with raid leader/ other buffs, etc. If you're relying on a single 8/8 on t3 to save you vs aggro you're going to have a bad time. 
---
Are you sure? That egg of yours looks to be a pretty good wall, and once it was gone, you could have given taunt to the dragonling.
---
LOL
---
I was gonna say this has to be turn 9 lol
---
They didnt force people run closed so If people kept the decks they still have mct
---
Its because right before the end of an expansion/rotation the app doesnt let you buy arena tickets or packs. You can get it later but its to precent decks from going across rotations
---
depends what you find more valuable as a f2p player. you will have a unique experience, atleast at first, with the solo adventure. like the guy said above me, you will lose out on more packs that way.

That’s deep.

She's basically a 2 mana 3/3 at that point! 
---
Bought the bigger package, didnt get the 50 dollar one because that one doesn't look like 50 bucks in value.
---
Heal druid coming very fast?
---
To be fair, Landscaping and Force of Nature aren't "way overstated", they're both just 1 stat point above vanilla. And 1 more stat point usually is a lot more significant at low mana.
---
If healing gave tempo it would work. Heal Zoo is the best example. 0 mana 3/3s are good.
---
Fair fight? Tier 1 against tier who-even-comes-up-with-these-ideas. 
---
Burning their cards is way more satisfying than dealing damage.
---
Yeah these are bad
---
Crystallizer is better imo.
---
Old midrange was more combo/otk than midrange. 
---
Also dont forget ancient of lore...
---
So is Moorabi a good mage card because technically you could get him from Unstable Portal? Moorabi and Frost Nova is such a great combo! Moorabi must be a top tier card in mage. (I am being sarcastic just in case you can't realize that.)
---
You must be new to this game. Here, let me help you. Open up Hearthstone. Click on the deck builder. Choose mage and create a custom deck. Now try to put Moorabi in it. Ooh Blackhowl Gunspire could also be good if you can hero power it every turn. Put that in your deck too. Whaaaat? You can't??? It's almost like you can't actually build your deck around cards that are from other classes! 
---
Even if a card is good if you get it from a random effect, that doesn't mean the card is actually good in that class, because you can't reliably get it or choose to start with it in your deck.
---
Life Weaver- This is why naturalize died. Good resource generator with all the new heal cards the body is also not bad for a 3 drop so makes a good just drop on 3 card as your opponant won't want to let this live so could itself save you some early game health 3 stars.
---
Dreamway Guardians - This card reminds me of [[Living Roots]] while obviously not as strong still a good 2 mana play. However my doubts persist as to if this is going to see tons play as this card becomes weaker and weaker as the game goes on 2 stars
---
Yeah. Peta aproves!
---
Weapon is on a prior turn, say turn 9. The Betrug costs nothing because of the Skull pulling it out for you free on turn 10. So you play the two mana card, then the 8 mana KT. Ten mana, five mana at any point prior.
---
&gt;WoW TCG
---
That's right.

With both branching paths and the DK rotating, Druid with lose most of its armour gain.

The only reason people complained about it was because of it's insane damage combo from hand.

Maple#21429 on EU. Trading 80g quest, you go first.
---
I liked it with Hunter after the nerfs, especially because his 2dmg HP for 1 is a better deal than 3 dmg for 2.
---
Plus hunters Mark, the spellstone, and both heroes being even was just icing
---
7 mana freeze two minions and cast say cinderstorm and get 4 mage spells with a 2/2 body is gonna be played, I gurantee it
---
The fact Priest has a healing hero power doesn't mean it has to be the best healing class. That makes design boring and bland. Even more, is not going to have all the best healing synergies to not be redundant. Best Token decks aren't going to be Shaman and Paladin all the time. Game is going to try to break some basic limits to try new stuff. 
---
I found it miserable... your opponent got to your combo, crush it by banning a card, and in the everyone just went discard loc 
---
Until they introduce overheal and make Druid the best at it. 
---
It’s being downvoted not because it isn’t fun, or because we decide to hate “just cause”... it’s because what the OP is asking is nothing short of impossible. 
---
Case in point: Wanna hear my bit of fun? I predict that 
---
Murloc Priest will be Tier 1. I know it’s hard to believe now but wait till you see the other 100 cards of the new expansion it’s going to be great.
---
You are going to love him :)
---
basic priest
---
Yeah, but even Druid is not gonna top that.
---
They should do a song called "Shoot like an Egypt-Gun"
---
Can't wait until next year when they get more burst than Rogue
---
He had one of the other totems out the whole time so that would make it a little less insanely lucky.
---
ok
---
Wait until druid got heal overtime
---
HEAL TIKEN DRUID
---
That's a savage level of bad luck 
---
Just luck. It's a 1 in 3 chance. So it's maybe very rare, but for sure statistically not impossible to roll the same totem 9 times in a row. 
---
Nope.  It was an arena.  No special hero power.  But as someone said they did have the healing totem already on the field the whole time so that does make it a little more plausible I suppose.
---
Mine as well.
---
I've done something similar with Tesspionage. 
---
Academic espionage-&gt; 1-Mana Temporus+valeera.
---
They get two turns to kill him basically
---
Druids have better armor than warrior, better beasts than hunter, better miracle spells than rogue, better burst than mage,better tokens than paladin and better draw than warlock. Let's just give them heal synergy while we're at it 
---
Haha, best comment so far :) 
---
No, it was just a midrange deck with a finisher. A busted finisher, but it doesn't define the archetype. In fact, without it being a mid-range deck, it wouldn't have been effective at all.
---
Brilliant! 
---
Remember to also look at these cards as utility rather than a forced archetype. "Heal druid" seems like a janky thing that might work or flop, in the same vein as Heal Paladin hype from last expansion. However as we discovered after last release, the heal paladin cards were just strong on their own as a stabalization package to aid control and combo decks. 
---
This 2 drop and the 1 mana crystal spell look like decent cards to run in any druid control or gadgetzan combo deck. Of course they won't come close to replacing the crazy armor gain we are losing, but they might be more balanced replacements to get you to the late game where the broken stuff happens. I'm hoping more strong healing comes this expansion!
---
PS. Maly druid with strong enough stabalizing cards could be decent. We still have floop, gloop sprayer, faceless, dreampetal, ferocious howl, as well as the new Jepetto. My day 1 build for sure. 
---
You definitely can't.

---
Sure, but that game has been around so long that every healing capable class has at one point or another enjoyed  being the most “competent” at it.

This won’t just vary depending on what time in the game’s history you reference but also the kind of content you are attempting.

Palindrome#11704 on NA, trading 80g quest
---
Really like Dreamway Guardians, 6/6 of stats for 2, with lifesteal to boot, seems strong in lots of situations. 
---
So can this if you use board-wide buffs like Power of the Wild. But yes, echoing ooze is obviously better in some situations. However, this card has its own advantages with lifesteal and the fact that it's a spell (so doesn't interfere with Crystalsong Portal, synergy with Violet Teacher, etc).
---
That's Druid's niche. They do literally every role in the game.
---
I assume that /u/BombaclotPoomPoom would like to see that more than me. I merely corrected him pedantically.
---
And resto druid has been one of the most popular healing specs for a while. If they get better healing it's lore friendly.
---
2 drop spell is literally nuts, not sure how anyone even compares it to firefly, benefit of which is only turn 1 in comparison to this 
---
Is it? I've been hearing that Rsham and MW were the best ones.
---
Sometimes few words, best words
---
Blazing Invocation can still discover MCT. I hate when it happens in my run.
---
You can spare some soul infusions on him too &gt;&lt; hir eek is just cause i like that one and for the inbetweem rounds you stabilized with zill and beetles
---
You don't have any 1 drop or 2 drop
---
"Feet" and "thee" do not rhyme, and so I don't see how there's an improvement indicated by highlighting the final words of the lines like this.

Inb4 he still burns you down because that's just one wincon

Tap the edge of the button, works for me.

But only for a small window of time, correct?

it actually is a women's only even though im pretty sure if one of the better players becomes a transsexual or says he considers himself a women then he can probably compete and win.

Use this trick every time. Really funny casting it 30-45 times in one turn fells like in cheating but whatever the game is hard. Also if the giant worm from the kobolds run eat a poisonous creature it dies automatically.

Europe 80 g quest trade NeverSloppy #2452

why buy anything if u can save 8k gold and lot of dust throughout previous expansion ?
---
&gt;Anyone else feel the same way?
---
Nope. How about you post your last 10 losses and we'll see if it's poor judgement or bad luck. 
---
It will happen at the beggining of the year of the dragon, meaning when the new standard rotation happens, that'll be the day of the release of the new expansion, April 9Th
---
U still got it? 
---
Is this Priest or Druid
---
If you view this subreddit regularly, especially on the new page, you'll find that each of those at least seem to be the general consensus.
---
Pretty hideous tempo loss just to activate some healing effects. 
---
This topic again? 
---
In the end a fire fly will spend 2 mana (after you summon the elemental) to get 2 minions at 1/2 each while guardians will get you 2 minions with 1/2 each and lifesteal.
---
For a druid, guardians is almost always going to be better except for maybe losing on 1 damage from a turn 1 fire fly.
---
I just hope it's not font of life 2.0 where it's something like "cast a copy of every healing effect you used this game"
---
Except a 2/4 can value trade a 3/2 and doesn't lose a trade against a 2/3
---
Oh, I was under the impression the standard change over was tonight, I seem to remember that's how its been for every standard change... unless I'm misremembering?
---
I'm guessing single player content information, it's supposed to release around a month after the expansion

This post is just dumb. Legendary and epic cards just don’t magically make decks better. The best decks were ever seen were mostly neural common. It’s about card synergies not rarities 
---
I lost to:
---
- Warrior (with 3 dragon roar, Deathwinged me once i stabilized and i had no answer)
---
- Priest (outtempoed me at the start and had a lot of buffs putting the health of his minions above the damage of my removals)
---
- Mage (also with a lot of good early game and got pyro blasted once i stabilized)
---
Think i could have made better plays here and there. I'm sure a top arena player would have easily gotten to 12 wins with this deck.
---
I think i could have also drafted better. But once i had some big removals i just rolled with it and ignored what might be the best pick in some cases :D
---
Looks like even shaman again, boys.
---
Possibly, I just read it was starting a month after the expansion, which made me sad. It’s my favourite part.
---
Nope, the rotation happens at the beggining of the new Hearthstone year, marked by the release of the first expansion of said year.
---
Fair enough
---
Ha! What a noob

This pack looks like someone walked by and dropped their f2p zoo warlock deck.

And they knew [[Mind Vision]] would allow you to steal that spell from the LK, so there wasn't much point anyway because you'd be able to debuff the LK and/or buff yourself the same way (though perhaps they could have tried to find some buff/debuff that would disproportionately favor the LK over the priest if applied to both).

All of the examples you listed for standard cards are wrong. What’s void lord without skull of the manari or dk Gul’Dan. What’s ui or branching paths without togwaggle/mechathun combos. I wasn’t even aware that Mage ran primordial glyph any more but frostlich Jaina is certainly more important than that. It’s not that people are forgetting epics, they are still extremely powerful cards that boost your win rate considerably but the reason people focus on legendaries is because they are the cards that make your deck.
---
Zoo isn't aggro 
---
Fair point I guess. Echoing ooze had weird buff synergies that don’t really apply here though.
---
Servitude summons a minion, this on the other hand puts it into your hand. 
---
No duplicates was Reno's mechanic, who was the "good guy" of the set, so it's not appropriate for Rafaam. We might see it if Kazakus joins the League of EVIL later this year though, or if Reno or the other League of Explorers members show up to stop Rafaam.

---
This. The discussion is generally due to price. Commons and rares are really the deck, which are practically free to craft. It’s not terrible to get 400 dust even if ftp to make epics. Discussion around legendaries is simply cause it’s damn hard to craft them all, so must prioritize

Not only this, but it isn't quite a 2 mana 2/4 either. The generation with the slam is effectively 4 mana for two 1/2s. Which isn't great. It does retain some power in a token lineup, but it is a slow, underpowered play nonetheless. 
---
wasn't this exact post already made, I feel like I've seen  this before
---
i doubt that there are that many 8 drops in the game, the mana cost is fixed for that summon(from spell damage or so) so its defenitly not that high.

He does seem pretty decent alongside [[Deadly Shot]], although Spellstone and Flanking Strike are rotating out. :(

He probably got it off Omega Assembly and it had rush granted by Boom, only would have won the game with a minion over 10 attack on the other side which is pretty rare.

Interesting idea, but for me I don’t want to chalk up an entire class as “skillless” and do away with it for *that reason*. However, I do agree you don’t have to use every class

Well. The sole reason for this being a neutral legendary is because the mage slots were already taken.
---
I wouldn't be suprised if this guy  was one of the mage legendarys at first.
---
It cast it again and we know that the reward does stack from that one TB a while back so you would get a turn after your 2nd turn, which means you'd get a 3rd straight turn. 
---
Huffer at the end of turn
---
It's used on Edh mate, like I said u just need to know how to use it
---
Nooooooooo!
---
Am I missing something? How does it work? 
---
This was back in the days of Undertaker Hunter which was maybe the strongest, most aggressive Hunter deck the game has ever seen.
---
The entire class is not skill less, just then it was. 
---
I mean you ended one of your turns...  you can also play that minion that does end of turn efects twice... it may not be the strongest thing ever becouse it needs quite a bit of setup but taking 4 turns would be hilarious expecially if you just rope it out...
---
"defile is rotating"
---
Lord Godfrey laughs more
---
Ragnarosi 
---
Bad manners
---
If it's true that I get this a week before the expansion drops I'm going to play a lot of quest mage oh boy
---
I've always heard it's "bad manners," basically just bad sportsmanship
---
Even if you could, were you implying that this is bad or something? Because it isn't.
---
Insanely good Priest card. Two mass hysteria’s in a row? No problem. 
---
Oh thought it was just this xpac, that's disappointing. Maybe she'd at least be a hero portrait for the mega bundle or w/e, thatd be cool at least.
---
Are you playing in "Casual" mode ? Misleadingly this is not a good mode for new players. 
---
I’m thinking something powerful but with a condition, something like 
---
“Battlecry: if your deck contains no duplicates, full heal your hero.”
---
Having 2 Kel'Thuzads on the board is always a fun time
---
Bit of a strange card to put in pure spell Hunter.
---
Put this into any deck wih Arcane Intellect in it and it's probably good enough already. Very solid card that goes into a wide range of archetypes. Really good card to make free.
---
You only get dust back for playable copies. So I can’t get dust for 2 of the same legends. So I dust the normal one for a discounted upgrade to gold, since I’m gonna get all that dust back after the rotation

I tried watching it a few times and it was just endless commercials, filler or player interviews. The few times I actually caught a game it felt like the series was over in about five minutes and then it was back to the other stuff. If anything it was a prime example of how NOT to do a tournament stream in my experience.
---
Kinda funny how in the last mission of his campaign in wc3, your desired gameplan is to ignore all of the regular human units and just go straight for proudmoore, much like ignoring your opponent's minions and just going for face damage in hearthstone.
---
Do we still get the random legendary when the expansion drops though?  
---
I know! I’m just lucky I guess. I’ve even thought about crafting him back in the day when rogue bounce shanagins were in vogue for a week with brann/emperor. 
---
Does that mean whizbang isnt supported by the new expansion? It was only a thing for boomsday?
---
You like being downvoted, Don't you?
---
Tang#1275 NA, online now, trading 80g friend quest, frequent trader here, you can check my history, I can show quest, you go first.
---
Another random mechanic card? seriously blizzard...
---
They should seriously add some skill caps and take some random mechanic shit like this out of the game.
---
I feel like hearthstone is so lazy and poor design right now.
---
rez, he gets rezed back, he casts rez again
---
broken
---
People are theorizing about all these crazy combos but this guy is good with even just Consecration. Control or Combo Paladin is definitely willing to pay 8 mana for a body and two Godfrey ticks. 
---
I feel like this will see play in everything except pure aggro. 
---
This card is sick. Blizzard is now flamestrike on 10. Mass res. 
---
As far as I know they didn't say anything about it yet. We did get both a free promo legend and a weapon in K&amp;C, so I'd guess we're getting both this time too. We have to wait til the next card reveal stream though for a confirmation.
---
idk... he seems abysmal in odd control warrior
---
I will believe it when i will see MGT trendind up on Twitch. Right now ppl watch it only when personalities from other games are promoting it.
---
Maybe for a 1 week Tavern Brawl but how do you make money. from this system. Also whats the point of playing a mode with no reward system as for some people earning gold or grinding ladder for chests is the goal. 
---
It would be cool I the rotation happened that day too. To have a couple of days with no Mammoth cards

---
Agreed. Considering Wild, there are way more powerful combos there than this.
---
It's late, but it can really help to have this possibility
---
Infinite Turns possible??? In some way???
---
Seriously , I can't wait til Odd Paly is gone . The deck is boring and has no interaction at all 
---
Turn 3 you wild growth of course!
---
Pretty much the same as holy fire then
---
he's more like electra
---
Lmao
---
4 wings were granted. On 2 1/1 bodies :'(
---
Turn 1 coin, biology project, biology project, this guy = 66% chance of starting turn 2 with 8 mana.
---
I tired to make a druid version. Was thinking for token for refill, but there is just too much aggro on the ladder.
---
Priest turn 1 boar 
---
turn 2 mind blast

turn 3 wolfrider

turn 4 bluegill + abusive sergeant x2

turn 5 leeroy

turn 6 mindblast + archmage vargoth

Legend in no time %100 winrate uh oh

If only random targets ran the risk of resurrecting your opponents minions.
---
mmmmm 40 card from Espionage+ Elekk 
---
Take my upvote 
---
cha0tictoast#1197 have the 80g quest
---
hell yea this is hype
---
Dont play casual play ranked I know its weird but for the first 25 ranks you cant drop down at all and you will play against other new players 
---
This actually wouldn't work, no matter the order. If you look at multiple Rags, they all fire off before the minions actually die. So KT would actually trigger BEFORE the minions from Plot Twist would leave the board, which basically makes this combo do nothing. 
---
Snipe Kripp
---
Easy 5 stars, this minion doubles any AOE spells you cast or any friendly buff spell on himself or your other minions. Enemy specific spells are also quite good with him on board as well.
---
Yeah 10 dust is really good :P
---
Am I the only one here tired of seeing new expansions being released every 4 months? This only makes things hard for casual F2P players who don't want to spend a shit ton of money on the game and don't have the luxury of time to farm gold for new packs all the fucking time...
---
Especially ever since they stopped releasing adventures like Naxx, LoE, Karazhan etc (which were the most fun and fair if you ask me), the game has become an obvious cash grab. They just spam new expansions every 4 months without caring to balance the game since the meta will get fucked come next expansion.
---
Ah yes when the crew leaves alabasta love one Piece love this pic too great work
---
empty board cast blessing of kings/cold blood/any minion buff spell on vargoth
---
Stoned Yogg
---
Just animal companion is probably great with him.

This is dope man, i thought it's an official poster or something before reading
