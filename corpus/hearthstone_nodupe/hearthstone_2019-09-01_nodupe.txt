Play 5 reborn minions
---
Hero power is 2 mana make a 2/2 copy of a friendly minion.
---
Play like 4/5 reborn minions(SUPER easy) and then they get to copy any minion on board with their hero power. What happens is this:  They get a mech or two on board and then copy them over and over.  They retain the stats/buffs and it just snowballs.  You cant keep up.  It gets out of hand fast.
---
You're going to jail alright... meme jail.
---
Thanks gamer
---
usually it brings you to a screen to where the challengers are. dont know of this bug.
---
I don‚Äôt think it would be consistent enough. You would need two minions on the board already and then play this. Not too difficult, but not guaranteed enough to be good.
---
Should have just jammed the lightning and traded your 2/1 and 1/1 if you wanted to clear. You had a rush lackey in case of a low roll too.
---
Very presumptive to think I'm the one that friended them
---
What is this title lol
---
if you dont care about the animations 100% disenchant golden commons, even if you want the common it costs 10 less dust then you get from disenchanting the golden to craft it so you always get profit, if you think cards might get nerfed/nerfs have been announced dont disenchant the cards. I would recommend not disenchanting till you want to make a deck or craft cards you need just in case a nerf comes out of nowhere.
---
Some might call it a stack
---
ez dust
---
&gt; Whenever I come across such cards I just think that the Hearthstone team hasn't thought of it that way. 
---

---
I'm pretty sure they have. Paladin isn't really a class able to readily draw cards, and with the exception of the four mana Reborn minions, they really aren't work copying. As such, the five and six mana eggs in the deck could easily clog up their hand in the early game.
---
The deck actually is fairly inconsistent, so just about anything aggressive slaughters it. Only against slow decks that can't pressure it very readily can Quest Paladin really do much.
---
In short, shove the deck on its back foot early on, and you'll win far more often than not.
---
&gt;For example, with Yogg-saron. They made a ridiculously overpowered card and they probably didn't think that Yogg could turn a game around on his own and eventually nerfed the shit out of it. 
---
You are right there. Yogg was made to be a fun, casual card, and looking back on the audience reactions to the card, they seemed to think similarly.
---
Man as a person who had played RuneScape on and off since 6th grade, I don't see the appeal of RuneScape streaming beyond pking. Watching someone fish trout and salmon for 8 hours seems like a huge waste of time.
---
gorhowl+darkbomb was lethal anyway providing no taunt behing the ooze, is it possible that zephrys does recognize bloodbloom and wanted to minimize damage to your own face?
---
No love for topsy
---
Step 1) play a bullshit meme deck with almost impossible win condition.
---
Step 2) play until you hit said ridiculous win condition from a top deck
---
Step 3) wait for the opponent to add you to tell you you have no talent and this game is bullshit.
---
Step 4) don‚Äôt add him then, but wait a week then add him.
---
Step 5) he won‚Äôt remember which person you were that he wanted to rage at, and now you have a person to do those quests with.
---
Do this enough times and you‚Äôll have some of those people probably invite you for the 80g quest.  Sneakily turned around a salty nerd into someone giving you gold.
---
I had 2 mana left so thats definitely not it
---
If you are a budget player then it‚Äôs not worth 1600 dust if your just going to use him as a 2/3 murloc
---
Paladin is tempo or aggro themed class. If your going to try out-warrior the warrior, yes, good luck or enjoy the loss.
---
oh... i couldnt see the mana properly, idk then probably is a bug
---
You cared enough to comment.
---
DAE WHIZBANG CLASSIC CARD????
---
&gt;So I have to wait till I empty my whole deck before I use it or what?  
---
Pretty much. Sir Finley is included in Murloc Paladin because it's a cheap Murloc with a potential upside.
---
It is also something you can easily cut out of the deck for budget reasons.
---
I‚Äôve been free2play since beta and , yes, dusting golds makes creating playable decks much much easier. I only keep gold if they are good legends or epics that I needed anyway.
---

---
It‚Äôs design space I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll touch eventually, though I think the new quests work pretty cool for it.
---
Yes. I crave validation. I'm sorry I offended you, I'm beside myself.
---
I'm happy to play! What's your tag?
---
Quest Pally can be quite irritating, especially when they draw all the reborn cards early. However, the main cards to look out for are the mecha egg, and mechanical welp, as those are the cards paly is going to try to use their hero power on most to get value. I find if i'm playing a control deck, to hold onto my more hard removal cards for these specific cards and once these cards are dealt with, the rest of the game is, while not easy, very manageable. If you are playing agro against it, the best shot is to get your opponent down before late game, or shortly after they complete the quest, as them completing the quest is not going to be an automatic win, just makes it harder to win.
---
If it makes it easier for players to get packs without spending money, they aren't ever gonna do it.
---
The whizbang decks in rastakhans was quite simple since you just kept board control
---
Just because someone points out your post is unnecessary doesn‚Äôt mean they are offended.
---
Ya... nice try, but Blizzard doesn't give a fuck. People have been asking for years.
---
What are the most played classes right now? I opened 60 packs from this expansion with gold but have yet to play a single game.
---
Was this after the recent patch? I remember hearing someone complain about this specific interaction before, not sure if it‚Äôs been changed since launch.
---
Yes him being 7 mana was super overpowered and the fact that you can nerf him two mana and he is still incredibly dominant is a testament to how broken he is.
---
Awwww, hello fellow Romanian hs player

You need 7 not 6 right?

---
Yeah expansion is 2 years old already unlikely to get patched
---
What you're suggesting isn't machine learning, it's hardcoding.  Machine learning would mean that the game runs enough simulations to figure out on its own what flags and conditions are relevant and what cards become good wish targets when active.
---
Your a scumbag, conceding to rank 20 to play against the noobs, what an asshole, do you play the game to get better ie. higher rank and get better rewards, i know blizzard tracks conceders on low ranks like you and I hope you get banned.
---
Am I blind or he kinda looks like Troye Sivan
---
Serious question, does anyone else feel really good when looking at the blue fog in this pic? Maybe I'm just tired, but it feels very nice.
---
That doesnt mean he gave it to you because you had kalecgos
---
I agree. It were indeed my pussy days.
---
I deserve that.
---
Rank is what I meant with apparent player strength. You don't have to limit it to legend players. You can use it as a weight. Lethal outcome could give maximum reward no matter what weight you multiply it with.
---
Zephrys plays a lot more like arena than standard, currently anyway. It tries to find a play for this turn or otherwise gives a tempo option for next turn. And it couldn't play more like constructed anyway, as it doesn't know what decks are played.
---
I don't see the point in this. This plan never even occurred to me. I can get my gold just by playing and have reached legend on two accounts (both times f2p). You're never going to progress as a player if you just want to play against the rank 20's. Kinda defeats the purpose of the game.
---
That's not true. Kripp got Geddon. There's a video about it.
---
Had a great game, thanks :)
---
I don't trust HS Replay anymore. It says Druid is like 30% against Warrior last I checked.  
---
  
---
The thing is, HSReplay stats are looking at all ranks. Think about the lower ranks. People probably aren't playing the best cards, so just aggroing them down is going to be effective. Also control decks tend to be harder to play, another reason why aggro is going to show up with a higher wr.
---
This is amazing. I love the effort you should either make more sets or balance this one to be perfect!
---
I think I worked it out - my imgur account has low points or whatever and it doesn‚Äôt trust me
---
I don't think Exarch Maladaar fits the pirate theme. [Lord Stormsong](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/2/2e/High_sea_priest_concept.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20180712000342) would be better fit, I suppose.
---
But hey! At least I give the fortunate ones some free wins, right? (God, I'm so gonna get shitted on with this)
---
Ur still paying full mana for the spell at it cost 2 less, its only more flexible over two turns.
---
So dungeons run count towards it too? That must be it then, played those quite a lot.
---
Truth be told hero cards were insanely powerful but they also brought a peak of power to each deck that made them so fun to play with. I really hope we get another set of hero cards
---
PvE doesn‚Äôt count
---
Idk if highlander hunter will be a thing but usually highlander decks get more and more support with future expansions, you can pick Singleton cards from a bigger pool to optimize the deck.
---
Oh, that. Yeah that's nice
---
Kolento 2:0.
---
its simple, keep it 100% in Pog mode
---
The token druid list is useless in the current meta. Just tried it and went form rank 6 to 10 with zero wins. It just runs out of steam way to early and has zero draw.
---
&gt;*Wild and Standard separate rewards (MTGA)
---
&gt;Depending on what rank you reach, you get an end of the season rewards (card packs, wild cards, orbs), these rewards are split between Ranked Wild and Ranked Standard, meaning, you can get double the rewards for reaching legend in both modes. This would make the game more vivid since more players would play wild and wild-only players would play standard as well.
---
MTG Wild (Historic) has not been out yet. And the direction WOTC is taking appears they don't want you players to play Wild at all (check [r/MagicArena](https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/) atm).
---
I assume what you mean is Ranked Draft/Arena and Ranked Ladder has seperate rewards.
---
I believe most players do not want a Ranked Arena.
---
I'm aware, but unlike most cards that have effects like enemy minion deathrattles resolve after the battlecry is done (for example: Dyn-o-matic won't fully clear a Murmy, it'll only break the initial 1/1 body), Shudderwock has all effects resolve in between the battlecries he casts. That's an exception to how most cards work.
---
Frostbolt is also nuts.
---
&gt;suddenly
---
It's not sudden, it's a combo deck that needs to cycle a lot to get it going.
---
This deck doesn't need fixing, it's nowhere near positive winrate.
---
Just run Skulking Geist, it's #1 tech card in wild.
---
he's actually from the Solomon Islands
---
Yeah - I guess the answer is the usual  Just smorcc 'em. If you dont like playing smorcc decks you're screwed but thats how it goes with this game.  Its either quests or hand vomit decks. No room for anything in between.  Oh well.
---
pws
---
Wild is so much better than standard 
---
So much variety
---
There is a difference between having a healthy meta, and aggro decks reining supreme for the last year, and every deck that gets in it's way is immediately nerfed. And the aggro decks we see today such as Murlock pally, takes no skill to play and is abusing one OP card that if they dont draw kills their Wr.
---
i started playing hearthstone again thanks to the permanent tavern brawls, thank you for making this game great.
---
Nah this is false information. The guy does not play wild
---
The real question is do you hate yourself and your life, with the only joy coming from making other peoples experience miserable. If the answer is yes, then craft it.
---
As others have said, you need to take advantage of the fact that the deck takes a long time to start paying off. Even in the example of perfect draws and the quest being completed on turn 4, consider the following:
---
\- Turn 4, quest completes.
---
\- Turn 5, play mechano egg
---
\- Turn 6, copy mechano egg
---
\- Turn 7, trade the 2/2 egg to get the 8/8
---
\- Turn 8, can finally attack with a big minion
---
So even in the ideal case above you're still not really seeing a payoff until turn eight. That's plenty of time to build up your own board and just kill them, or to draw an answer.
---
As someone who likes to play every deck other than straight up aggro, I've been very disappointed over the last year. If your deck isn't based on killing your opponent as fast as possible, your deck is either a snooze fest or sitting at T3.
---
Yes . You know me.
---
Your viewpoint is way too simplistic and black-and-white.
---
There are tons of examples out there of big companies with a lot of experts making terrible decisions that were obvious from the outset to the actual consumers of the dog food they were selling. The experts have a lot of major advantages from their knowledge and big data in predicting certain things, which makes them really good at certain types of decisions. However, the actual people who purchase and use the products also have significant advantages like real-world experience, which makes them better at other types of decisions.
---
You also are encapsulating a big part of why market leaders often cease innovating and fail to nimble, hungrier new entrants. This type of complacency isn't generally something that is lauded. What is actually "extremely stupid from the business point of view" is not reacting to competition unless they can manage to become competitors that are worth mentioning. Because at that point it's often already too late. Ask Microsoft how they feel about giving up their Windows Mobile monopoly on smartphones by being complacent in teir market dominance.
---
&gt;If Shadowverse has a mode that is impactful as what Autochess mod did for Valve, Blizzard wouldn't need more than 1 month to implement it.
---
1 month eh? This is just ridiculous. This current team can't deliver tournament mode in a year. Even if you shower them with money, it still takes longer than a month to bring in new developers and get them up to speed.
---
It's not underwhelming, you just built it up for so long and then when you get it you don't know what to do anymore. It's something that happens with every goal you really want for a long time.
---
Yeah but that would make sense, and we know Hearthstone team hates consistent card text.
---
Cloning Gallery aggro deathrattle priest has been my most successful place for him.

Not the regular Solo Adventures but like the two weeks of the Fire Fest-E.V.I.L. where the Tavern Brawl was a dungeon run. Every opponent in those counted as a game toward daily quests and Play Mode wins (which does include Tavern Brawls, despite its name).
---
You know hearthstone has changed when most replies to this kind of post actually encourage the dude to play wild. 2 years ago most posts would have been people not playing the format saying how crap it is...
---
Oh yeah, my bad, I'm blind, at first I thought that he can still undo the craft.

Would add Norrhshire cleric and brawl to that list.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
If you say so.
---
Welcome back! We've missed you
---
it will not affect minions stats, I'm sorry if it seems vague as I assumed people will relate this to how the card Unexpected Results works.
---
Been saying this for years!
---
Just imagine if instead of a single wish card, Zephyr's gave you these types of situations and you had to be smart enough to discover lethal!
---
Haha he blamed me for verbally attacking him because i was wrong, and verbally attacked me on the same fucking comment :D
---
Doesn't look like Jaina either...
---
You both get 80 gold, you're both winners. Not tom ention when I play with lower ranked friends I pull out the meme decks. No one is like "oh you want to give me the 80 gold quest? Perfect I'll play control warrior"
---
Contrary to popular belief wild decks don't have 20 legendaries.
---
I‚Äôve always been against it but damn those boards are sweet, I would be so hyped
---
Yeah zeph recognizes keywords, it seems i forgot to mention that. But it only recognizes that the minion has a deathrattle, not what the effect is and only recognizes keywords, not card text.
---
What about prep?
---
Doesn't that just make them higher skill hahaha
---
I do know how to use him, and I know what cards to expect in whatever situation. Its just that sometimes I would like to get a different card than Tiron on 10. This has nothing to do with skill but with what the devs hardcoded on him. Why would I rely on someones coded best choices instead of making the best choice myself? Doesn't that require more skill? Can Yogg be defined as a skill card by your understanding? Are you a better player when you play an odd amount of spells before Yogg just because it is statistically better even when its random?
---
Oh ...i mean this would still be broken...and improved by spell damage...thats just hilariously gross
---
This got me thinking, would it come back as a 1/1 or a 10)1?
---
It comes back as a 10/1 With Divine Shield
---
Even with subdue? That's interesting
---
Yep, reborn minions lose any enchantments when reborn, so even the 2/2 copies come back as a full attack minion with 1 hp
---
Oh that's right o forgot about that. Makes so much sense now, thanks!
---
Yeah as long as Myras is in standard Miracle will be dead. Myras is just way too good to give up. The nerf to cold blood and prep also didn't help the archetype, as well as the loss of cards like Faldorie Strider and Elven Minstrel
---
Yea will have to try it out then.
---
how so?
---
Its in his latest youtube video
---
It doesn't take luck to beat Warrior with Tess Rogue. That matchup is is heavily favored against warrior. Just Scheme a bunch of Tess copies into your deck and you are the one with infinite resource generation!
---
That's a strange way to draw Gul'Dan
---
It was still played in Deathrattle hunter sometimes.
---
Fuck yeah that was awesome 10/10 would wish again
---
I checked my BIOS virtualization was already enabled. I‚Äôm stumped at this point. But thanks for the tip
---
At least when he hexes himself you get a taunt.
---
Oh I see, it does seem like he doesn't give flare very often though.
---
DK rexxar provided infinite value. So much so that  "midrange" hunters, midrange is in quotes because the curve topped out at rexxar, were able to fatigue an odd warrior relatively consistently. It was honestly ridiculous. You shouldn't be able to play a single card and have it nullify an entire archetype, in this case being hard control. Zephyrs is not infinite value and does not single handedly nullify any archetypes. Well, except for handlock I guess (rip jaraxxus), as if that was even a real archetype anyway lol.
---
Yeah, it had some nice moments.
---
I thought about it, but I determined it's too slow. Multiple 1/1s is not really that helpful if I can't buff them with the hero power immediately. Plus, I can't heal them for quest progress, and there aren't enough silence cards to make them all bigger immediately.
---
I like to think of this deck as a mid-range resurrect priest.
---
What happened?
---
Wait that‚Äôs illegal
---
Exactly, &amp; with a reborn taunt I could keep copying &amp; basically get a stacking Bloodlust every turn.
---
Damn that‚Äôs pretty insane, how many wins?
---
What happened at the end of it?
---
Yes
---
I enjoyed them
---
I plugged it in and left for church... Will update when I get home...
---
I think Highlander Hunter isn't in a great spot after the nerfs, most of the match-ups you see aren't favoured. I'd just craft Reborn pally and replace Undatakah, a lot of people have already dropped him.
---
Lol imagine it‚Äôs still going
---
not only that, but Blizzard is far less likely to mess with the decks vs. standard decks so they're  a far safer bet.
---
randykong#1373 you go,first NA

Sometimes it can be really frustrsting to climb in wild but oh boy can you try some weird ass super fun archetypes at rank 15 10 and 5

Sidebar, he got the 2/2 taunt from the 2/2 taunt 3 times, making me lose the game because he had 4 taunts and a berserker
---
Zeph/Reno/Brann/Etc upside doesn't equal the downside of the not running duplicates. The upside outright overshadows the downside of not running duplicates.  
---
Its not complicated. I've never said the deck restriction isn't a downside. Just that its not nearly as big a downside as that one dude was trying to make it out to be.  That's just simple facts, literally even stated two points as to why its not as big a downside. Without stating that you get access to the effects of cards like Zeph and ect.  
---
We have so many good cards now and so many cards that generate other cards, that having to not run any duplicates just doesn't matter as much.
---
skrz#21406 EU trading 80g quest, you go first
---
54.7% played winrate, so, not bad, but not exactly amazing.  And that's with his stats being kind of inflated with giving people burned.  Admittedly he has a high drawn winrate in highlander decks, but that makes sense as he's the pay off for running singletons.
---
He's a powerful card, but not stronger than a lot of other cards.
---
*fucking disintregates into millions of pieces*
---
That's how I'm feeling. It was cool for the first week or so. But now its becoming an annoyance. There shouldn't be a card that can provide an answer for damn near any situation.
---
Rise of Shadows and Uldum are better overall tHan every 2018 expansion because the 2018 expansions were largely underpowered- so much so that boomsday actually had cards from it buffed. You‚Äôd likely be better served by buying them than anything from witchwood, boomsday or rhastakahans rumble.
---
I made kangors army and a copy of micro mummy , it's pretty good till now, I'mma test it out more later when I have time
---
Newest is best. Once you got a decent collection going again, decide what you like and craft for it if you can.
---
At 0:39 the Hex costs 1 mana but at 0:41 it costs 0 mana. The time shown in the lower left hasn't changed much so it seems to be the same game. How did the Hex get discounted?
---
I‚Äôve gotten pyroblast with 0 mana left simply bc my enemy had less than 10 hp
---
My dude, it is even worse than DK Rexxar's case . I started to hate him when he makes an already strong opponent stronger.
---
Zephrys, Zilliax and Siamat.
---
Hunter and Paladin are (or were at the time) tied for first. That means Warrior is second. I did write my title wrong but Warrior is second place.
---
That is one of the craziest things I've seen in years of playing this game, congrats that was so cool
---
The Nozdormu has also swapped locations with Hex in hand, so maybe it just cut a few wishes in...
---
The winrate would drop due to bad players lmao
---
Zilliax, zephris can be played in highlander and aggro
---
When people get angry at rank 19 you begin to understand why they are stuck there
---
not bad if you were against Holy Wrath Paladin!
---
Mixture of both. Started ore nerf and didn‚Äôt stop post nerf.
---
Thank you! I've seen that pop up a lot lately.
---
Thank you!
---
Now that is a fun thread idea: what cards are in real life version of hearthstone...  
---
Steve Irwin: summon a random beast  
---
Elon Musk: summom an AWESOME invention  
---
[Twisted Sister](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SRwrg0db_zY): give each player the power to ROCK  
---
Etc...
---
Thank you! Seen Zill a couple times too. What are people liking about the card so far?

Click the "wild" tab and then find the class you want to play and it'll show you the good decks. You can even link your BNet account and it'll give you decks you currently have the cards to make.
---
Oh no... I got rid of my jade decks like a month after means streets went in to wild and only have medivh left on heroic. I have been trying for nearly 3 years to beat the thing and never even thought of jade decks...........
---
Yup, can't go wrong with Zilliax.
---
Doubtful. Reno was the only one for a while. Then we got 3 right before Reno rotated. We just got 5 in one set. I think they‚Äôll either do it right before these rotate or not until after they do. 
---
Also, just printing more cards helps Singleton indirectly since they need to use more cards by default.
---
Battlecry quest shaman for sure, I got to legend last season with it. First time since ungoro.
---
I doubt it's a wild thing but rather that it doesn't recognize any player buffs/debuffs currently active.  I assume in standard specifically it wouldn't notice if you have Kalecgos' effect active either.

&gt;Really hope someone comes up with a different kind of warlock

Just do it yourself. It always disappoints me when players think they don‚Äôt have the means to create decks. I sincerely think all it takes is 6+ months of experience with the game in order to have the acuity required to create competitive decks (note that top tier ‚â† competitive). It just might take a week of tinkering with whatever concept you‚Äôre working with. 
---
Note all of the Priest decks listed above. They are **all** Combo, with one exception. Does this mean you *have* to use Combo? Of damn course not. You can make a Legend viable deck with *practically* (maybe not literally) any initial idea you want to build a deck around. During Rise of Shadows I mostly used a Shadowform oriented deck to reach Legend. This month I used a Highlander Priest list to reach Legend. The month before that I used a Deathrattle Zoo style Priest deck with cards like Zerek included to reach Legend

Also note that I‚Äôm using ‚Äúable to reach Legend‚Äù as the general metric for what I consider makes a hypothetical deck able to be considered ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù. This is opposed to actual top tier decks, which are the ones that (generally speaking) you‚Äôll have/want to use if you want to climb further *up in Legend* once you‚Äôre already there. But for 99% of players, I think they‚Äôre just sorely misguided when it comes to this vague notion I always see that all you can use in this game is exclusively five or six top tier tournament decks, or whatever. Of course you don‚Äôt have to use those. Not if the extent of your competitive goal is simply to reach Legend. It‚Äôs **definitely** not the case if all you want to do is reach rank 5. Any competent player can likely reach rank 5 using nothing but random ass decks they‚Äôve had the deck-builder tool build for them.
---
Are you going for a midrange/aggro priest deck? That's what this looks like to me. I don't know how this does at rank 15 but I'm pretty sure it won't be so fun higher up, quest res priest is normally played in a very controlling way, a bit like control warrior except you do actually play some minions to pressure the opponent! This is almost like an aggro built because you have so many weak resurrections, so I feel like you're going for the constant board pressure aggro tactic. I'd highly recommend penance, it's amazing with the quest. Zephrys should go, too many duplicates.
---
When playing agro I hate armor spam jade Druid. When playing Reno I love armor spam jade Druid because I can play giest :). Just about perspective honestly.
---
too violent for my tastes, Blizz needs to nerf asap
---
Well, you're still alive, so not really best
