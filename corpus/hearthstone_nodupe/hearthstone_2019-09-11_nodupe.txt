Do you know if cards like \[\[Stitched Tracker\]\] used to have a higher chance to discover class cards?
---

---
Technically speaking it's still Discover, but considering how it's based on your deck I suppose it wouldn't have a higher chance to discover class cards?

---
I really like the discover nerf, but this reallllllyy needs to have a refund for these cards since it really is a straight up nerf for Flunky, Stonehill, etc.
---
Just keep restarting until you get Robes Of Gaudiness then, and just pick big minions; Windrunner, Rag, Y'sharaj, etc. You'll win easy.
---
I just became really sad when I realized I can't discover nearly as many Emeriss in Wild as Hunter....
---
Well, the average value is only higher because of the occasional legendaries and Nobody dusts all new legendaries (they are the Main reason you bought that many Packs anyhow); unless you already have every single Card, but then why should you even Care buying Packs anymore.
---
Wow dude this guy’s replies are so pedantic
---
I can’t believe they haven’t added wild packs to the store that you can purchase with gold. I’d love to use my gold to open packs of Whispers of the Old Gods again.
---
Not usually one to complain about changes but the discover change is a gigantic nerf to discover cards
---
Huh, it's felt like a fair bit longer.
---
Nice buff to Zarog's Crown actually
---
If they do that, at this point they are just reprinting old expansion.
---
Diablo 3 changed pretty significantly from vanilla to RoS to today.
---
There are multiple budget decks (at any given time) that are capable of reaching Legend, which cost under 2,000 dust. You’re not losing because “my opponents have legendaries”.
---
Yes curious to put Baku in an empty deck and click autocomplete to see how smart it is
---
They're charging literally the same amount they always have for packs, plus they added a tier above their standard. How exactly have they "upped the nickle and diming" recently?
---
What does enjoyment have to do with refunds?  The majority of people were happy with nerfs to Boom and Luna but we got refunds there.
---
&gt;we get no refund when a change doesnt directly change a cards stats, mana cost, or text, and its been like that forever.
---
[What?](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/574379.jpg) You're just talking out of your ass TBH.
---
I didn't want to mention every little thing, otherwise people reading my thing don't really save time compared to reading the original. The Elise change affects 1 card that few people (being both new &amp; legendary); the Discover change affects dozens of cards

only 1 card impacted.  I don't want to mention every little thing
---
Fair point. But I figured that these cards could easily synergies with their respective quests if they accommodated for it. The easiest example being Rogue with its “another class” synergy.
---
You can use a filter to see only the stats from the current version.
---
Didn't even get a rare in that pack =\
---
Spare parts. The first expansion, goblins versus gnomes introduced cards that gave spare parts.
---
That's literally exactly what the card is made for
---
How do you stay sane after an incredibly tragic run of bad fucking luck
---
Yea it is very very common to see tarim or tyrion from stonehill in arena.
---
I'm going to be honest hearthstone is at first an analytical tool disguised as a card game. It's literally the only game that makes my pc turn on the fans. Poorly optimized with junky code? Maybe or maybe Blizvision is using hearthstone to form 1 gigantic network for processing power. Why else does a silly mobile app heat my pc up to the point my fans need to come on. Wake up sheeple. 
---
If you're wondering why we lack features then there you go.
---
I mean, Flunky is still good and will still be ran? As will Defender and Assembly
---
Nah cataclysm discards hand
---
Yeah. That's a known combo.
---
Given the state of the game, you might've been able to squeeze out a win.
---
Adventure cards used to not be dustable. They changed it several years ago. Also you didn't get those cards for free like Snip-Snap or Vargoth.
---
Not how it works, a shaman that doesn't have ~3 minions on board at this point isn't doing shaman right

Not all cards can be good, and I doubt adding the theif clauses to Violet Haze and Myra would have don't anything to improve their viability.
---
A lot of the questlines in WoW Classic are still cool AF. Some of them can be a tad bothersome, oh lookie here you have to go to three different people in Stormwind back and forth without a mount before you do an "actual" quest. But they add a lot of depth. Just not I got word from the altar boy to report to Stormwind Keep, who sends me to, for some reason, just Jorgen the Fisherman at the Stormwind lake just at the entrance.
---
And who does he send me to? Elling Trias. The same guy who Master Matthias Shaw sends you to when it comes to taking down a corrupt, Defias-affiliated Noble.
---
These guys are "connected," they have "contacts." It makes you feel like there's depth in the world where unassuming fishermen and cheese vendors are who you're sent to by the Master of Spies and clergy.
---
Plus, the whole Defias questline in Westfall leading into the Unsent Letter and Bazil Thredd conspiracy is awesome. Now with the Missing Diplomat questline (which I'm pretty certain is actually Varian Wrynn and not a random diplomat) you're getting more and more hints to the puzzle of corruption in Stormwind and the source.
---
Heck, just reporting to and from Sentinel Hill and Darkshire back to Lakeshire and reading the letters about how the Stormwind Army has withdrawn from all the regions leads Solomon to believe something foul is at play.
---
Of course, all of this -- **all** of what I just described -- relates back to Onyxia. Lady Katrana Prestor was the one who helped foster the division and hatred that led to the formation of the Defias Brotherhood, playing the sides of both the Stonemasons and the Nobility, simultaneously emboldening the Stonemasons to demand their restitution for their work, and convincing the nobility that they should not give them it. This led to the riots where a rock was thrown that struck and killed Varian's wife, Tiffin. Varian clamped down on the Stonemasons, including the imprisonment of Bazil Thredd. Their leader Edwin VanCleef left Stormwind and founded the Defias Brotherhood.
---
And later on, Onyxia would provide the intel to the Defias Brotherhood of Varian's movements, so that they could capture him. And her ploy was to take Varian Wrynn, split him into two halves - his charismatic, tame side, and [his passionate, ferocious side](https://imgur.com/ZFNJlM5) - so that she could kill the fighter and put the other one, malleable to her will, on the throne. 
---
Overall it's a very well self-contained story that has good roots in the history of Warcraft (Stonemasons' history being ingrained from the First and Second Wars) and gives you a great sense of depth from what is what you'd imagine to be just a group of evil thugs.
---
You can always get pretty far with midrange hunter (to a point) and most of its cards are in the classic set. Might want to try that
---
Agree. This type of post has to be top 5 most frequent.
---
Frightened Flunkey is still going to be drawing you a card that will still be hit by Armagedillo, and Omega Assembly will still be adding three removal spells after you've played Dr. Boom.
---
The average result will be worse, sure, but neither card is going to be taken out of Control Warrior. The card advantage both provide is still going to be too good to give up.
---
Wait a few days. Today’s soft nerf to Discover effects is going to shake things up a little - Warrior is definitely going to lose some ground. After that, you should be good.

Something about this game has the ability to piss almost anyone off. I think it's how slowly the cards come out when you know you're screwed; it's like they're smiling at you.
---
The point still is Quest Rogue doesn't need any extra help.
---
Yeah, it really is baffling how they keep trying to get that to work. This is an online game, just giving us online fireside gatherings would have gone a long way but nope. Must try and copy outdated MTG for this “feature” without giving the places hosting them any financial incentives.

In other cases, it may not be a clear-cut "rage conversation", so there may be some leeway. Mostly we just don't feel like the purely hateful and antagonistic ones add any value, so those are always removed.
---
Well, worse is still better.
---
If you played Wild Growth and you have five mana crystals total after you played it, you played it on turn four...
---
Four minus three equals one...

^(Have a question or think your post doesn't break the rules?) **[^(Message the moderators.)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhearthstone)**
---
That sounds right
---
It’s an OK deck, but you are pretty reliant on drawing prismatic lens early. For a similar cost you could build a pretty good Zoo Warlock or Combo Priest deck that’s a bit more consistent. They’re both pretty aggressive decks that are worth looking into.
---
You are taking some combination of memes, reddit, or yourself far too seriously.
---
Last expansion I played was the one with Dr. Boom. I'm looking to get back into the game but I have no idea where to start. Any direction?
---
Just quickly went through and auto-completed nine decks and I gotta say: these lists are solid AF.
---
Basically every single one is a meta deck minus one or two cards that I don't have. I think they did a good job. The only oddity I found is it's making decks were I would double-up cards. What I mean is: I got a a rogue deck with one Swashburglar for example. I own two and you'd basically always want to put both in. The deck was "ODD" but wasn't a highlander deck so I don't know what the system was thinking.
---
Another example: I own two walking fountains but it suggests one. I guess that's a bit more reasonable since it's a high-cost card.
---
That one sounds right...
---
Some cards have grown situationally better sure. And I wouldn’t mind if these cards didn’t get refunded. 
---
But by and large - and this is by the devs’ own argument on how class cards should be - class minions are stronger than the neutral pool. And people recognize that, say, Flunky is materially worse when he can’t dip into Warrior’s amazing selection of Taunt minions as easily. Is that good? Sure. Is it pretty clearly a nerf to Flunky’s effectiveness (intentional or otherwise)? Seems like it.
---
Back then, zoo, midhunter, midshaman all had very cheap but competitive budget versions that you could build in a few days. There was little reason to play cthun hunter. I honestly dont remember playing against any cthun hunter.
---
In any meta, there's gonna be someone who enjoys playing some random off meta deck. You can objectively measure the diversity of a meta by looking at the class playrates. [This](https://imgur.com/a/baDpXgK) is from vs report 10. Warrior was twice as popular as the second most popular class at legend and 4 times as popular as the 5th most popular class. This is about as bad as KFT druid stone(before plague nerf). Plague got nerf in less than 1 and a half month. Warrior stone lasted for almost 3 months until karazhan was released.
---
As I mentioned before, the lack of resource generation wasnt something WOTOG added to the game. It's just that they haven't started the trend yet but they did start the trend of adding these big one card win conditions to the game, which often limits deck building. This basically started the power creep, not in terms of power level, but in terms of the WOW factor. People have already seen yogg, how can we print a card that makes people more excited(what card before yogg had crazy game ending effects like old gods)? That's when they started printing crazy cards like kazakus, quests, dks. You can't go back. They tried to reset the power level in rumble, which led to a stale meta, and historical low number of viewers(probably players too).
---
I don't play it, but it seems like if you have the right cards on curve it would be really good. Like once you complete the quest, you could play an Oasis Surger turn 5, or a Starfall or Druid of the Claw. Again though, I don't have the card, just speculation.
---
the biggest downfall i see in the past few years is just the lack of powerful, neutral legendaries that you can build decks around.. or at the very least do some really strange and weird stuff to have fun with. i have more than 25,000 dust just waiting for something decent to craft and each expansion i get excited by maybe 1 or 2.
---
tbh i like turn 1 quest turn 2 crystal merchant + coin a lot better. obviously always situational and if you cant get value immediately after quest completion then there wasnt actually a point to rush quest completion in the first place
---
Looks like you can't play anymore
---
I know you are getting downvoted (I probably will too), but I do think if they made this change to a \*single card\* the community would have been in an uproar if they didn't get a refund.
---
Jesus, stop posting these russian love letters to your mother. I speak Russian and Im tired of these.
---
They just did reprint an expansion lol
---
But I hate math
---
It's a lot of fun. It's standard playable too, and not bad to boot.
---
Makes future Discover cards far less interesting as well.
---
Exactly. The chances are low, but it's a possibility.
---
If there's any Discover effect that includes Neutrals, this will nerf that Discover effect, because the class options are almost always stronger. In the case of Frightened Flunky, the reason it's so good is because it's almost assured to pull another copy of itself, Armegidillo, or Tomb Warden because of the class bonus. Omega Assembly and Dr. Boom's Hero Power will have the same issue, it will be far less likely to pull Warrior Mechs. A significant Warrior nerf is the impact it will have on this meta. Other cards worth mentioning are Stonehill Defender, which has the same text as Frightened Flunky but it's Neutral on a different statline, and Blazing Invocation for Shamans.
---

---
Ok you have a fair point. tirion, highmane, mechano egg, convincing infiltrator, spider bomb are pretty good high roll results, but there are a lot of decent neutral deathrattles that you would be taking out of the pool. So I wouldn't consider the change a buff, just an adjustment of the card effect (mostly in favor of quest rogue I guess?). Also IMO, violet haze right now is in a good spot by giving you both neutral/class deathrattle cards. I think if deathrattle rogue was more popular it would see more play.
---
android or ios?
---
if android is your spare space on card or built in storage?
---
Discover wasn't hyped at its release until people discovered (hah) that it favors class cards. I guess it is better for new mechanics to start strong then get toned down later rather than having another uninspired mechanics.
---
Android, build in storage. There isnt even a card slot for extra memory.
---
fatigue bro
---
And Ysera.
---
That's really cool. I'll have to try it out, I wonder what will it build for Warrior. Probably pirates.
---
Yeah fuck this. I'm ending up playing less since I'm forced to play when I don't want to.
---
If they could just have five quest slots I'd be able to spend my weekend enjoying the quests and taking the time to make wacky decks.
---
But noooo... I'm grinding it out on the daily with meta decks so I can go to sleep early.

Yeah, once the game starts dying off a bit more, we will probably see a bunch of these features.
---
Except Snip snap
---
The real question is: what is a deathrattle shaman?
---
Probably the upgraded Warlock HP just because the Warlock HP is already the best in the game. Hell the regular Warlock HP is probably better than most of the upgraded ones.
---
Wait, that means George is on the other team... you don’t fight the Dalaran PCs, right? Just the League members themselves? It would be cool if there were some dialog where Karl convinces George his quest for vengeance is misplaced.
---
I mean, ignoring that Classic just released (rereleased?), when WoW had the Cataclysm expansion the Vanilla era WoW world got revamped to update the stories since they weren’t up to Blizzard’s new standards and to show off new tech/allow flight in the old world.
---
Sadly a consequence of this was that many questlines from Vanilla, for better or worse, were removed as their story was already completed canonically. Onyxia was dead in Cataclysm and Varian was back on the throne, there wasn’t anything to uncover anymore so the Onyxia chain doesn’t exist anymore in modern WoW.
---
So your solution to making the game cheaper overall is to make it more predatory towards so-called "whales" (who aren't just people with too much money, many have genuine problems and they're spending more than they can afford because games make the prospect of getting everything appealing and almost obligatory).
---
I'm sure you'll have a bright future in the AAA games industry.
---
I wonder if the third expansion will have the resolution to this, with Karl and George being one of the paladin legendaries, or maybe even both

Definitely. a 5 mana 6/6 that gives taunt AND divine shield to every minion... imagine you already have 4-6 minions on board that aren't 1/1 tokens. Even as a 5 mana spell, that would be insanely powerful.

The last few Data Reapers it has seen play at around 12-13%. I was either thinking Priest as a whole since I was thinking of seeing it at around 18%, or it was higher at some other point in the past. 
---
That said, it's no surprise that it fell off at higher ranks. It was the deck to beat and classes like Mage and Shaman were both good against Priest and also many other classes. Even Shaman's only real weakness was Warlock.

This doesn't mean that Priest isn't oppressive. Big Priest single-handedly forced almost all other control decks off the ladder.

Its not just boom. The class bonus was simply set too high and it allows for a very high chance, sometimes ridiculously high chance to find specific cards.

What if [[Imp-plosion]] was reworked to only hit for 4 damage .01% of the time? That wouldn't be a nerf, right? Because it's still theoretically possible to hit a 4 and all that changed are the "parameters of the card"?
---
Don't answer that actually. You think making the coin not count as a spell would be a "quality of life" change, conclusively proving you do not know what the term means. I love that your definition of it appears to be "any change that changes anything about the game whatsoever, because that affects the quality of my life".

I do have Pogo but as I said, I'm don't have that many cards, and I've disenchanted my Geist somewhen in 2018. Mind that this was at rank 20, I get to rank 13-14 when I'm playing (peak is around rank 8 back in 2017 with Spell Hunter). but there are some months I am too lazy to even open the game. With that being said, people are either playing fun decks (NOT armor druid) or basic decks, so I kinda forgot that Geist even existed. Thanks for the advice!
---
In your opinion, maybe, Personally I’ve played each at least ten times, beaten immediately or not, because I like trying with a bunch of classes and there is different things I want to try with each class. People have put hundreds of hours into slay the spire despite it remaining basically unchanged in early access for a while, because deck builders have lots of replay value fundamentally. Like I’m not saying dungeon run is slay the spire, but putting a new twist on a deckbuilder and experimenting while keeping the core gameplay the same is fine to me, because it still feels fresh and new and fun.

Me too! The new adventure has a similar format.

What CCG do you not have to spend a lot of money to have every card?  I feel like hearthstone is one of the cheaper CCGs.
---
80 bucks buys u an AAA game on steam. For 80 bucks i expect a full complete set of non golden cards for that expansion. Not 80 packs with a portrait.
---
I already stopped spending money until they fix the pricing problem.
---
Battle pass would be dope. 
---
**I want more reasons to play the game besides golden heroes.** Since I already have golden hunter there's no much reason to keep playing hunter for instance. This month I'm already sitting at dad legend since I hit legend last month so I have no incentive to grind for rank. I already have all the cards I need from SoU so I have no incentive to grind out the 100g daily.

A lot of my time was spent with Dalaran Heist, but I've completed 45/45 Heroic Dalaran Heist. I'm barely playing HS at all at this point, and Tombs of Terror seems a lot smaller than Dalaran Heist as well. Playing a lot of WC3 right now. Really the biggest upside is that I'm able to commit to lifting more consistently again because I'm playing less video games.
---
Entry level for me is usually 3-4000. I assumed when you mean deep, you mean deep dumpster ranks. I make it to legend usually and I've never encountered the mythical place where people don't play meta decks. As I've said, even 8000ish ranks is infested with t1 t2 decks. Above 5000 there is nothing else. Now I'm not complaining, when the janky stuff like maly hunter works for me, it's sweet to beat a ctrl warrior or something that obnoxious. They even send hatemail sometimes. I love that
---
Sadly...yea..thats the interaction between armor and majordomo

What beats Elysiana is Elysiana (or winning the game well beforehand). With both players getting worse discovers, I don't think the change matters much.

Yea. It's the same with Jaraxxus. Although it's inconsistent with the DKs, Zuljin, Hagatha and Dr. Boom.

In this scenario an 18/19 is genuinely difficult to kill, thief rogue is usually pretty good about keeping a warriors armor down. No, the real bane is [[Arathi Weaponsmith]] and [[Malkorok]] because they're a minoon in hand but give you a weapon as a Battlecry. Only solution is a summon from hand effect.
---
It's a buff to several Discovers.

Honestly i think with Halazzi,Springpaw,desertspear and  !Swarm of the Lotus! etc, unnerfed buzzard whould be maybe to strong with the new quest.
---
Quest Paladin isn't really a flexible deck so lists from a month ago should still look about the same with the exception of one or two tech cards.
---
That only hands could satisfy
---
This card is worth putting Thaurisan into your deck.
---
I’ll do you one better, why is Karl?
---
I mean, yes. I’m not trying to imply that the whole dust system is intended as a 1:1 with the ability to transfer physical cards around and recoup costs. Just that the system is designed to be a little generous to compensate for the fact that your only recourse if you stop wanting a card is to convert it into Hearthstone’s digital crafting resource (vs. being able to directly trade it off for something you might want or get some physical cash out of the situation).
---
How on earth are people thinking a 5 mana 12/12 across 7 bodies with taunt and divine shield could ever be a real card
---
Ah, I wasn’t even aware the comics existed!

This was the time of undertaker hunter with ridiculous card draw with buzzard + unleash. That was a different beast from later face hunters.

just bros willing to move heaven and earth to find each other, just bros constantly talking about one another
---
Ah buzzard, one of the worst nerfs ive seen in any game ever. Utterly killed the card.
---
It feels like they're using some version of the deck builder Ai for the randomized decks. They're pretty cohesive and feel reasonably powerful
---
It's a great change from who gets the least millhouses and argent watchers brawls we've had in the past
---
Played 3 rounds with Rogue, which starts with a bunch of bonus shuffle effects. Of particular note was "when you shuffle a card into a deck, add a copy to your hand" for 3 wishes in one turn, and 2 added back into the deck.
---
Mine literally does soooo
---
Chance to hit the same card increases since the two spells are always from the same class
---
And what exactly should they be giving dust back for? Every discovery card, including those that were buffed?
---
You're being unreasonable this time.
---
Would you rather have your bedroom filled with bats made out of fire or have it filled with fire made out of bats?

Against me, it will

so the wish cards are Zephrys in disguise?

I know theres a phone app called lethal which has a bunch of lethal puzzles, not sure its being updated anymore but it has a bunch of them
---
There isn't one, this sub isn't a hotline to the devs.
---
The first couple of opponents I went against used their wish on turn 1.  I gotta say, that is really not optimal.  The wish can you get really good cards and it's not super reliable to draw into the second wish.  I think it's better to play turn 3 or later but that's just my opinion.
---
I see. Overwolf seems like a good platform! Now I'm getting some idea for developing an app of my own, hah.
---
Is that true? I've never noticed. In that case it's always like 1/30-40.  Should be happening all the time

For the contest that ends on the 16th, correct. The voting phase for each contest begins when the submission deadline passes (+/- a couple hours if I'm not home at that time)

Dude that’s awesome! Have a dude I’m deployed with that plays a lot! I’ll give it a try! :)
---
They added the part were you track whit which heroes, hero powers and decks you completed the run with.

No
---
Big plus to playing a class whose cards are pretty bad without synergies, like Warrior or Warlock.

Remember the titanic split in half, so...

Awesome! as a casual player who sucks but still loves the game, I've only ever gotten 5 wins in Arena. I'd be stoked! nice job :)

Quest pally is it!  Unless Murmy is enough and then Murloc pally.

Yup, seems like problem in Asia server. I tried login to NA without problem.
---
Good reference lol
---
At least that douchebag with his "HELLO" got his ass handed to him.
---
On my IPhone, each character in the selection screen has a "40/20" below the class name.
---
Anybody know what that means?   I've won with Mage, Hunter, Druid, and Shaman.  No differences between the classes played and not.
---
Toki is my favorite card in the set! Glad you love her!
---
I got a HexMage as Shaman with use of Wish into bright wing with brann on board and a Zola in hand. Many wishes were had.
---
Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.
---
Does it not replace my quest on the far right?
---
Neither did I but I still waited til 2 to get the guaranteed Brightwing/animal companion drop at least
---
For Karl!
---
My first thought upon seeing this was "NOOOOOOOO!!!", because I immediately imagined Karl meeting George and being saddened by how far George has fallen.

I used to run a Reno-Shaman that was pretty control-ish and would win (occasionally) with Leeroy/Windfury/Double Rockbiter (deck's only 2 of) or various combinations of Doomhammer Windfury/Windspeaker on Leeroy/Fireguard Destroyer/other high attack minion that stuck.

Lesson Learned - should've taken Pagle.
---
Golden cards also have this weird thing where the golden effect is acting like a green screen and the golden effect is a static background so you only see the golden background movement when the card moves. I noticed it opening my tavern brawl pack it’s hard to notice in the collection. I’m not sure what this effect is called it seems similar to a parallax effect
---
\&gt; Implying hsreplay cares about wild \^
---
Same, and I think it's because Karl being dead and George mourning him was lowkey pretty disturbing lol

Zephrys the Great doesn't use an AI. It uses an algorithm.
---
That difference is important as you can't train an algorithm like you can an AI. There's no machine learning to be had with Zephrys.
---
This Tavern Brawl likely has no such secondary motive.
---
Oh and pirate Druid is a thing! Wot fun! FFS.
---
Not super great advice but I highrolled my passives and treasures. I beat it with Robes of Gaudiness, combined with the Treasure the Golden Candle, who was also my right hand man from Bob. Basically to throw off any synergy the later bosses had and then outtempoing them with half priced legendaries
---

Ok
---
Tavern Brawl is *supposed* to have janky shit. Play ladder or arena if you want "deck-building and understanding the synergy of that deck."
---
pm me tour battle.net ID, I can add you and help you a little
---
This brawl has crashed hearthstone every time I try and start it.
---
It is AI, it's called rule-based AI.
---
The fact that it doesnt learn doesn't mean it's not AI. A lot of AI used in daily life was pre-trained or pre-programmed (hardcoded rule-based AI) and does not learn anymore. Some however do but you risk overfitting or regression to the mean in the long run.
---
The legendary quest overwrites one of your quests. Id definetely a bug.
---
You. You're good.
---
It didn’t so should I talk to player support.
---
Interesting, there was a couple of minions that I could have cleared with BL but not with the options they gave me
---
Beyond redemption indeed...

They announced when they HoF'd them, so you must not have been paying attention. Also don't use TIL, it's cringe.

---
Can I buy stuff for my Americas account on this store? This price is less than half of what I pay in my usual currency.
---
It looks like that's EXACTLY the point!

I mean I saw you post about it ten minutes ago :p
---
Wild versions of the same deck are often cheaper than their counterpart.  When it was in standard, standard Even Warlock was more expensive than wild Even Warlock.
---
There aren’t too many decks shared between both formats right now, granted, but there is mech hunter; standard mech hunter is more expensive than wild mech hunter.  (Usually 6400-8000 dust in standard, usually 4920 dust in wild).  This is because fancypants high mana legendaries are usually too slow in wild.
---
So like...in raw dust amounts the same archetype is usually cheaper.
---
That said, people don’t usually make decks out of raw dust.  People when they make a deck usually have opened all the commons and most of the rares.  So a deck of 30 commons doesn’t normally cost 1200 dust (but for someone who’s never opened a single wild pack, it might).
---
You get one random uldum legendary, 2 card backs, and 16 packs with the preorder.
---
" the smaller your remaining deck, the more likely you are to draw it. "
---
This is misleading IMO. While it is factually correct and you are more likely to have a wish in your hand for more turns if you wait. If you shuffle turn 1, you are more likely to draw 2 wishes during the course of the game than if you shuffle turn 8.
---
Those need legs and epics... in the other hand secret mage in wild can be a 1500 dust deck with 69% winrate (you can add 1600 dust for the mage weapon instead of an arcane intellect, but can do great without it...)
---
flairs are a bitch
---
while there are some extremely expensive decks in wild there are also a bunch of really cheap really good decks. so i wouldnt say that way generally is more expensive. when looking at the tier one decks from the most recent tempostorm meta snapshots wild is actually cheaper than standart.
---
Wild:Snip-Snap Otk Warlock-9,200;Even Shaman-7900;Odd Rogue 10400;Secret Mage-3400
---
Standart: Quest Druid-13600;Murloc Shaman-10400;Combo Priest-3800; Control Warrior-13000
---
Weaponized Piñata in quest paladin! Got some interesting interactions so far
---
28 damage to go face or clear, I think he'll be fine...
---
Again, it’s not 1:1 economically and there’s no real way to compare the relative complexities of the physical card market (in which you can actually generate cash-money profit if you’re savvy enough on trades and selling) with Hearthstone’s purely digital system. The fact is that some people *would* prefer a smaller amount of stone hard cash back instead of Hearthstone’s equivalent to monopoly money. 
---
Which is, again, why it’s very sensible for Hearthstone to be relatively generous with this part of its model.
---

Not even the right kind of “Draw” and they weren’t even asking.

I got hunter quest for my login, shaman quest within 20-30 packs and Druid quest on my 38th pack I believe.

Secret mage is pretty good. All you need is Aluneth and everything else is rare/epic/common. Sometimes stargazer Luna is used but not necessary.
---
I googled ARS too and now I'm grounded... must have safe search off..

---
Is that the part where a sentient bullet pulls a real bullet out of a guys brain and saves his life because the the real bullet was blocked by a chunk of ice the guy had in his hat?
---
This lost any sense of "being reasonable" as soon as you said we should get dust back for buffs.
---
How do you not get the reaction in this thread?
---
Somehow public knowledge slipped past you, tons of people tell you, that YOU missed stuff.
---
Did the fact that you fucked up ever cross your mind?
---
She can be game-winning in arena but thats the only time I've seen her used well.
---
A card not intended for your particular classes doesn't work and you want to change it based on the interaction when it is stolen?
---
With that logic they should just remove all the badly stated high drops for when I want a good evolve target too.
---
Mage gives you more wishes just FYI
---
There is no rule prohibiting you from doing so.
---
