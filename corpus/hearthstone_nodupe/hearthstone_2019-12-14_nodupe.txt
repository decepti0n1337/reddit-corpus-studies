When I first started and never even thought twice about strategy or looking at reddit for advice I crafted hogger because it ‚Äúseemed‚Äù good. Haven‚Äôt used him in 3+ years lol

---
shudder doesn't play spells/summon the minions though. Well, usually at least.
---
Yes it is :D
---
god yes
---
Pretty sure this combo no longer works due to Reckless Experimenter nerf.
---
I‚Äôve been woooshed!
---
How do you beat it as a  Galakrond Shaman ?  hope they misplay? 
---

---
The only thing I can figure out is don't get damaged and don't overplay a board that can be removed.  I can't figure out a good tec card either.

Mage has no Galokrond. Bite me.  
---
I'm salty we get no love expac after expac.
---
luck, good deck and a good draw
---
I really doubt people are interested in Standard and Wild becoming almost indistinguishable.
---
So original. Not like anyone has said this before, or even once a year since GvG came out. Take your much deserved karma and proceed to more worthwhile posts that offer so much that we haven‚Äôt talked about before.
---
can remove shudderwock from the game any time now...
---
I really did try to win, I promise! It seems a little ridiculous he got this board by 5 mana, maybe the game is a bit broken right now.
---
When you see a lot of GM players not wanting to play ladder because it‚Äôs pretty much all shamans, there‚Äôs clearly a problem and Blizz knows they need to fix it ASAP...
---
It‚Äôs quite easy. If you know the percentage of the spawning of each card rarity. Multiply them to each other and there you have it. The chance of this pack
---
I don't think the double invoke is bad if they the storms are 1/1s. It's 5/5 stats for 5 mana, that's perfectly fine to me.
---
I choose ~~death~~ battlegrounds!
---
I agree with you - I am a huge arena fan as well and I applaud the quick action on Poacher, but the missing leaderboards is baffling to me. They already have the code written to create the leaderboard. All they need to do is copy/paste the SQL query (or whatever it is), change the start/end date, run query, copy paste to a blog, hit publish. That is a 5 minute process and would be incredibly easy to automate. I don't know why it takes more than a day after a season ends, let alone six weeks or two+ months.
---
Obviously they are paying attention to arena (banning poacher extremely quickly shows this) and obviously they create tons of cards specifically for arena (maybe I am wrong but I don't think cards like blackwald pixie or hippogryph see much constructed play), so why can't we get leaderboards and class balance microadjustments quickly/at all?
---
I understand that arena isn't a huge direct moneymaker for the game, but this is something that costs almost nothing and gets a lot of people hyped up for the game mode and for Hearthstone in general. I know I would've quit years ago without Arena, and I would've quit 9 months ago if not for something like the leaderboards to keep me going, and I would not have recommended the game to so many of my friends. These give a lot of players something tangible to work for and get excited about.
---
Only fellow Deryl players will understand :P
---
If infinite wok matters you're playing too slow and greedy and deserve to lose. Shudderwock is a fun card and rotates next set anyway.
---
And payoff, per usual, will be here next December. And the payoff will be on par with Talanji.
---
I have had a lot of luck with a steal rogue that runs quest, gala, Tess, heist Barron, academic espionage, and a ton of draw.  You get board wipes from stolen spells and, blade fury.  I keep getting tons of dragons, the dragon that stuffs your deck with dragons, shudder, and kalecgos
---
*laughs in golden galakrond*
---
though I'll most likely still keep it.
---
\+1  
---
You can't have public PTR's but you can definitely have private ones with limited invites and NDA's. The most popular players are going to want to keep things to themselves while they learn, and you get their knowledge too. I HIGHLY agree that whatever current process they have for testing is way too lengthy and cumbersome. Either Blizzard is waiting too long to try and make "data driven decisions" which fly in the face of what we're experiencing on a daily basis, or the process of which to have nerfs approved, tested, and deployed to devices is too cumbersome and needs much more streamlining or automation.  
---
Sincerely, someone that hires automation engineers and technical program managers for a living - the very people that are supposed to manage this type of shit, just in a different domain.
---
Thanks. I missed a few of those.
---
Would love to see this in Battlegrounds. u/mdonais any chance of this?
---
galakrond priest is only played cause it's new and cheap. Old rez priest and combo priest is way way better.
---
I would play a tavern brawl with only vanilla cards and. A couple of card drawn spells
---
Quest Hunter it's underrated üòí
---
Well I'm not sure how much advice I want to give out to most of my opposition, but creating threatening boards is key. If you make a board that takes up too much space and doesn't have much attack a good paladin player will punish you for it. They will let you do minor face damage for a few turns and just heal through it while cycling hard. 
---
The obvious things like take opportunities to overdraw them, even if it means having a weak turn (milling one key card will outright win you the game in most circumstances) and playing to win instead of not lose. That may mean playing hard into a second board clear. 
---
Most of the time we will not be able to deal more than 25 damage in one turn, and staying above 25 is obviously a good idea.
---
As for tech cards, the card that plays both players weakest card would work, the guy that sets you both to 5 mana might buy you the time to finish us off and a strong board clear would help deal with the 9 mana play a 5/5, three shirvallas and watch your opponent concede turn.

https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/5se3a2/beat_the_meta_with_no_text_only_deck/
---
EU, rank 5,  HL reno mage
---
Quest druid? Right now the meta is win by T7 or face down 16/16 in stats. 
---
The decks that are doing well are those that are able to "1-up" Shaman. e.g. Edwin Rogue, Whelp Rogue, Pirate Warrior, Dragon Hunter etc. Particularly those able to start pushing 8-10 damage a turn past T5.
---
Think Divine Spirit can be more of a problem. High health minions need to be looked at or else you get an early 3/18.
---
Oh come on he's not that bad
---
That sucks. I‚Äôm a big fan of all of the folks that they released. Hope this doesn‚Äôt impact their willingness to stream Hearthstone.
---
Mmmm, from a mechanics standpoint, not really. Just a lot of OP "better than classic" variants of the same card.
---
It's basically a 5 mana 10/8 with rush split into 2 bodies a 5 mana neutral card shouldn't have that much power level
---
Geez I don't remember the last time I had even one megasaur
---
As mentioned, if you have something better feel free to share, else beating up the data source when you have nothing on your own is not much of a contribution.
---
Seems like a really stupid decision to me. HSreplay already has the market cornered for Hearthstone game companions. I'll continue to watch Kibler, Firebat, Ike, Pathra, and Zalae, but I'm really gonna miss the weekly Omnislash and Omnistone vids.
---
Poor dude who opened double priest legendary in his 40 packs and can't do jack now.
---
Firebat did a combo deck a while ago that was a bad sorcerors apprentice deck with sound the bells. Turns our it's really hard to get zepherus to give you apprentice
---
But Shaman still has better Battlecry synergy, evolve effects that abuse the Battlecry bodies, a much more consistent Battlecry in Galakrond, and a single card that Invokes twice. You could make this change and Shaman Galakrond would probably STILL be better than Warlock Galakrond.
---
Dude 3/3 is too low,  I‚Äôd make it 4/4 so you can actually di something with them.
---
They're not smurfs, as it's pretty much impossible to stay at these ranks for long if they're good players, and there's no real point to smurfing in this game. But you are hitting all the returning players.
---
Don't let the Golden Heroes intimidate you. Winning 500 games simply means they have been around a long time, and also that they lost 500 games at least. They're still Rank 20 players. Also, don't think that a lot of legendaries means they're good, or have better decks. There's equally good decks that don't have a lot of legendaries.
---
Meta decks? Yes, that matters. Right now, Galakrond Shaman is beating everyone else, no matter what rank they're at. That'll change next week after the nerf, when your cyclone mage may find itself a lot better.
---
You've already made it past the first hurdle, which is recognising that YOU need to learn. Concentrate on that.
---
Great that they had a patch ready just in case. Calling it now though, quest is on the chopping block since it's a past set. Funny enough quest isn't even good enough to run in the highest w/r deck.
---
Murozond is really good, it's just that priest doesn't have a shell of good cards to put it in. It's a lot like priest in un'goro when they got radiant elemental, shadow visions, and lyra and still sucked until KotFT. priest needs better classic cards and a real win condition.
---
FIVE viable Hunter decks - Highlander secrets, Highlander Dragon, Mech, Quest and Dragon Aggro. 
---
I'm not even sure how or where you would begin to start fixing them.  At least for Shaman, we all know who the culprit is.
---
Wait, crazy idea but what if buffs also came, please- priest went down a solid 10% winrate.
---
Probably because that leads to some weird/infinite combos (like if a thief priest or rogue gets the card as well and plays it after yours, so it ‚Äúplays‚Äù your dragon which will play theirs etc.
---
Simplest reason for that is probably that they can apparently change Battlegrounds serverside, but need to push out a patch to nerf things in Standard.
---
You asked, they answered (next week at least). Probably the fastest balance patch in the history of Hearthstone.
---
the odds of not getting a legendary within the first 10 packs are literally zero under this rule, and it happened to some people.
---
For sure, I remember games were I lost because of mistakes and played cards in wrong order and you knew you lost because of a mistake or anything, now the game is a whole new monster
---
Pretty sad news for some of my favourite streamers. Hope they can keep making money from their awesome HS content.
---
How is invoke to be changed? It‚Äôs a battlecry mechanic and only changing those would mean changing every card in the database with invoke to a non battlecry minion
---
Feasibly, targeting a few different things in small ways could help curb Shaman a lot. Make the double-invoke 6 mana, trim Dragon's pack into summoning 4/5's instead of 5/6's, adjust the Quest to only double the first Battlecry...
---
Seems like the worst possible business decision I only was somewhat interested in their app cause of its connection with firebat and kibler, but I feel without their backing I'll just stick with hsreplay
---
I used to be a Combo Druid main at the time and never gave up on the deck and I faced like 95% of Paladin and it was horrible experience, it seemed they always had the perfect curve, but the worse for me is Muster on turn 3, that was just brutal to anyone
---
Shaman‚Äôs cards now are such a far cry from what the class used to be. Having a crapton of rushing bullshit along with overtuned effects makes the class near unbalanceable in its current state
---
Oh yeah, my bad. I actually just flat out forgot about that. Just another positive about them being gone.
---
Boom bots die to plague of death, unplayable
---
People often make crafting decisions based on data. I believe that it is valuable to point out that a person should not spend their hard-earned resources guided by a flawed data set.
---
"Don't say anything unless you have something good to say" is not a healthy perspective. The same mentality encourages people to remain silent about uncomfortable realities that people would prefer not to examine.
---
Sometimes there isn't good data available, and it can be important to acknowledge that.
---
Personally, I think he should be nerfed to 7 mana, and for his effect to read "Battlecry: Transform one of your minions into another Faceless Corruptor." This will put him at a more reasonable mana cost while also disabling the ability to duplicate and bounce Shudderwock via its battlecry combined with Barista Lynchen--basically the Saronite Chain Gang treatment.
---
The difference is you can actually tech against this deck, just add heals, taunts, and weapon removal, just like.old Pirate Warrior. When I'm in deckbuilder and I ask myself if there's any tech cards I can play to beat Shaman, the answer is no.
---
I don't know about 'only reason'. I was playing Highlander priest yesterday and getting 'destroy 2 minions gain 5 armor get a value hero power' for 7 is pretty sweet.  It auto loses to gala shaman and otk pally, but I was grinding out control warrior and Highlander mage, and going positive against aggro.
---
I think next expansion it will rotate out and I can't wait
---
Your reading comprehension is so fucking low that I'm actually worried about you.
---
What do you mean?
---
And you were supposed to feel accomplished for spending 5 mana to draw 1 card and "healing" for 4
---
That guy has one of the best voice lines, I chuckle every damn time.
---
I had no clue Omnislash was developing an app or related content, and honestly I have zero interest. HSReplay has that covered, and there's no reason I'd consider anything else. This is an almost comically poor decision. The only association I cared to have with Omnislash was the weekly Omnistone show, and because I love the players. Whelp, see ya!
---
So who‚Äôs left? Frodan and...frodan?
---
I have played at least 50 games in legend with control priest with this combo and I just get shit on all the time because I always either die super early or just never get to draw the combo(2 or 3 pieces in bottom 10 cards) Its fun when it works but its so god damn hard to pull off. Either that or I built my deck poorly/suck at playing the deck. If you find something that works for you I'd love to see your deck
---
They used the wrong sink. In this case sink is correct because it would be like a heat sink.
---
Here's the thing though ... now I cast any memory of Omnislash aside. All I cared about was the weekly show, because the players are awesome. Now that they're gone, anything Omnislash is nonexistent to me.
---
I just crafted Bandersmosh, was having a blast until I realized the deck I was piloting was soul sucking cancer. Looking forward to playing less degenerate shaman decks with it next week
---
Can refund Sherman cards after Nerf next week
---
Exactly.
---
You don‚Äôt really use him for the body, mostly the battlecry which is a permanent buff. You typically have two types of minions. Ones that have good effects like cleave, or divine shield, or poisonous that you use long term (Divine shield murlocs is the popular build). Then you have buff minions which either stay on the board, like lightfang giving continuous buffs, or you have battlecrys which you use for the battlecry and then sell. With that said, bagurgle has one of the best battlecrys.
---
**This post is nothing more than a suggestion, not a guarantee that this deck is an auto win against shaman** . But if you‚Äôd like to know I‚Äôm rank 4 currently and seeing a lot of success with this deck.
---
So they cut the content that was the face of their brand and made them unique.  Perhaps the best way to enter the crowded and competitive app space was with their content creators being the perfect way to market the app - get it running on their streams, plugs on the YouTube videos, run a demo during Omni/stone.  Now it will garner no interest.  
---
I get that we don't have visibility into their financials, and they wouldn't have done this if they were profitable, but I don't understand how this new data/analytics/app direction is going to amount to more than a fizzle.
---
I‚Äôd argue the value of the previous turn is incidental to the value of the new 5/4 rush body. You can‚Äôt play a naked summoner and get two.
---
Mate, I reached rank 4 with a Quest Priest list. And that deck is trash.
---
i love those
---
Yes, we know.
---
Wait it actually summons 4 8/8s with rush?
---
Ads.
---
My guess is that the owners of Omnislash are just a couple people working on it as a side-gig, and it just wasn't feasible for them to continue hosting the show, spending so much time on it, and paying the streamers and editors. Probably, their passions/skills are for coding, data-analysis, and building apps, so that's what they want to focus on. We don't really know much, certainly not enough to question their choice, and if they just want to focus their hobby on what they're passionate about, then that's great for them. (But if the owners are relying on Omnislash as a business to support them, then I agree that this is probably the beginning of the end for Omnislash.)
---
Ok, and this deck also reached rank 4. With a winstreak from 5 and in my opinion it‚Äôs a good deck. No one is making you play it :)
---
Yeah, Charge is the first born screw up
---
Ads where? On their website? Web ads don't pay shit anymore, and if they're just an app people aren't going to be spending a ton of time on their website.
---
But yeah, I agree, Omnislash is probably just a side gig.
---
NEVER.
---
Counters to Pirate Warrior: if they lose, they lose. This clearly belongs in /r/competitivehs
---
it's not possible to have built a full cyclone mage netdeck F2P after only playing for 2 months. i assume you're using replacements for key cards and as a result have a much weaker deck than if you just crafted a cheaper budget aggro deck. if you don't want to play aggro you do you but don't expect to climb.
---
Keep it up, Friend!
---
Brian, I thought you had some kind of equity into Omni? I remember at least from the early days of the podcast that it seemed like it was your thing.
---
Itsuki#2316 EU trade 80g quest I show and you go first
---
says me üò≥
---
Galikrond is one card and easier to pull off than mulch munchers. You pretty much need both mulch munchers and a gloop sprayer by turn nine to match that power.
---
Imagine how strong wild murloc shaman will be when we get a set dedicated to murlocs

It's sad that we are impressed by prompt and necessary balance changes.
---
Yes, I definitely need experience and I still have to learn a lot. This game is deeply strategic and quite complex.
---
It would be foolish to expect mastering it in a couple of weeks.
---
At the moment I am playing mostly with a Inner Fire Priest deck. I've been able to create a 36/36 monster, once. I one-shotted the opponent. Lot of fun, although, probably not the most competitive deck out there. I miss many Rare and Legendary cards that would make it better but I manage. I added in the Galakrond invocations but I think I will drop that, because it forced me to remove a few important cards to make it fit.
---
I will look for deck guides. I would love to play with a Rogue deck because I love some randomness in my play. Using your opponent class' cards against him seems fun and it grants a varied gameplay.
---
I play on literally the same phone, so it‚Äôs likely your device. Probably a hardware issue, unless you haven‚Äôt updated your phone for a while.
---
It wouldn't even go in battlecry shaman. It'd go in maybe a mech focused deck. Maybe.
---
I have a galakrond shaman deck, and I don't win all the time, since I don't always get galakrond at an opurtune time for plays
---
Strangely, Frodan was never a member of Omni/ but instead hired just to be host of Omnistone.
---
Release mummy still feels broken. Why did warrior get a way better version of fireball that can stick on board?
---
So people are playing dragons and Galakrond, eh? Interesting. 
---
I don‚Äôt think spell damage mage is a very competitive deck.
---
I recommend you base your priest deck around this one if you want it to be more competitive:
---
https://hsreplay.net/decks/bAccfFhPmYCbJWUidGqlKb/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD
---
Priest is currently the worst class, and you are playing the best type of deck for priest. 
---
If you wanna try other classes, the website with the priest deck I linked has some really good decks for you to copy or base decks around.

If you wanna ask other questions, feel free to do so.

Namely because the designers couldn't be bothered to word it better.
---
After the last period of shamanstone shaman was hot garbage for a year and bad for another. As a shaman player, can't wait for that, honestly, so I can grind in peace.
---
Interestingly enough, inner fire lives on as a deck in that "combo priest" I told you about. It's based around a combination of healing synergy and big health minions. I'll paste in the most popular decklist
---
It's built around using lightwarden for big attack, cleric for card draw, and playing minions that damage themselves on play or allow you to damage your own minions so that you can heal them for synergy.
---
This deck has a high skill cap and I hit legend with it a few months ago, so it's still pretty competitive even if it's not the most broken thing out there right now. You generally don't even need Bwonsamdi the Dead (although it's a nice bonus to have!) If you're interested in this deck, theres a bunch of guides out there on how to play it.

I'm literally asking for Galakrond shaman to be nerfed. How can I be a Galakrond shaman player?  You're forgetting the objective. It's to stop the current shamanstone meta. Faceless corruptor nerf does not do that. It's a strong card no doubt. So is Zephrys and a bunch of other stuff. Nerfing faceless could weaken aggro which might make Galakrond shaman even stronger.
---
I demand a Shiro segment.

Exactly, it's a complete shit show on ranked ladder. The fact that it's this bad from the second day means they did an awful job of preparing for the expansion.
---
Eh. It lets Galakrond Shaman reload, and there's an infinite Shudderwock version. It doesn't stand out because not every version is currently running that setup (and it can whiff of course), but it's there. 
---
Once that gets going, only Flik can stop it. Even then it's probably not enough when it's your fourth board of 8/8s.
---
Sure, but if you're dropping 100 bucks on an expansion then you're expecting it to be fun to play. This is not it. I don't see why we should be giving them positive reinforcement for this. We are paying customers - if I pay for anything else and it's broken I don't give the manufacturer of that product positive reinforcement when they say they'll fix it. I ask when it'll be done.
---
It's just a fluff piece, sorry your having such a bad evening you can't giggle and carry on. I'll wish for a better day for you tomorrow!
---
right now malygos and deathrattle rogue are looking best. i would still wait before crafting whole deck but togwaggle is a safe craft and flik is used too
---
everyone:
---
shaman: what if I freeze face turn 1?
---
He's talking about the era where the meta was turn 1 tunnel trog, turn 2 totem golem. Shaman was more than 50% of the ladder because both midrange and aggro shaman were completely bananas. IIRC it was Karahazan
---
I don't think the problem is Galakrond, the 8/8s with rush and all the invoke cards create tempo sure, but the problem is and has always been Shudderwock and the Quest to a lesser extent.  Just fueling Shudderwock to refill your hand/battlefield/heath with just a single card.  It creates something like 10+ extra cards plus battlecrys, its nuts.  
---
Sending at least Shudderwock to the HoF would hurt the deck enough to where control would not run out of board clears to just did to a single card.  An argument could be made to send both Shudderwock and the Quest to a early HoF, which I would be fine with.  But as always Shudderwock is the largest offender and it should just be axed.  It seems like too much of a change to fundamentally effect the entire way shaman Galakrond is designed.
---
I‚Äôm mostly just here to be supportive, but my main pieces of advice are 1: find out what kind of decks you like to play IE aggro, control, etc. If you like aggro (playing fast and loose trying to kill your opponent very quickly.) I would say craft leeroy Jenkins. He‚Äôs just an amazing craft and I think forever will be. Also, play arena. Getting good at arena is how you can potentially ‚Äúgo infinite‚Äù on arena and get packs and all your gold back, which can be super beneficial. Also, being F2P doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt do well. I‚Äôve played for about a year with like 500-600 total wins and I‚Äôve hit rank 5. The key to being F2P is persistence and being really good at arena.

Delann#2781 EU trading 80g quest I show and you go first
---
no more deck doctor :(
---
Yea holy wrath paladin. Shamans can't put enough pressure on you in time. No deathrattle either so equality board clears and shrink Ray eat em up
---
Wow you're right now i cant feel special anymore. To be fair, that video was posted on the same day that i discovered this.
---
That's a terrible accusation. I'm a scumbag even without spamming emotes or playing shaman!
---
freeze is one of their card themes dude
---
I do feel like there should be something else that synergize with lackeys in rogue tho. Combo generation and togwaggle is nice but for them to introduce a hero card that generates them I feel like something else should be coming for it
---
It's only fair if they do it. Typical Druids..
---
So what deck are you playing rn?
---
Semi legit against Pirate Warrior/Rogue tho.
---
This is hilarious.
---
Better time in wild.. maybe cost wise. Fun wise however is a different story. Wild tends to be more busted decks. Though standard is pretty bad right now too
---
Ah, first time I‚Äôve seen holy wrath paly being called combo paly, my bad (combo priest is a whole other beast)
---
Problem is, it dies to literally every other deck except shaman. Pirate warriors and Galakrond Rogues absolutely crushes it
---
its so much better to do it turn 2 when they can equip ancharr/necrium though.
---
...you do realize the point of the giants is to conjurers calling them, it doesn‚Äôt even matter if they get frozen because you just destroy them and summon to random 8/12 mana minions. And the odds of shaman having BOTH their freeze spells the exact turn you drop your giants/questing is so low it‚Äôs not even worth worrying about. And shaman running both faceless Corruptors into ONE GIANT is a trade that you would WANT to happen because that‚Äôs just a straight up waste of value at that point. And it doesn‚Äôt matter that they can do the double galakrond turn in quest shaman because 
---
1. This deck is usually threatening lethal by turn 9 if it hasn‚Äôt already beaten you. 
---
2. Giants usually come down with at least one mirror image so they‚Äôre protected (if you play the deck right) 
---
**Actually try the deck before you claim its not a counter, thanks.**
---
I've gotten Alex off Alex like... A lot. Couldn't give you numbers this isn't a scientific statement lol it's just happened to me and my opponents enough times that it feels weird
---
Blizzard wants to reward pack-buying customers by making them feel powerful, irrespective of their mental capabilities.
---
Oh I'm not saying it's good for laddering. Lol I'm just out here sniping shamans and having fun.
---
This statement is so wrong I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre memeing lol.
---
*Cough cough* tier 1 deck *cough cough*
---
I agree this expansion is kinda frustrating - card games are rng clown fiestas to begin with but some of the new game winning stuff it just feels bad,
---
*AN EARTH SHATTERING PLAY*
---
Nah.
---
He said this:
---
shaman was hot garbage for a year and bad for another.
---
I refuted that, that's all. I know it wasn't really Shamanstone until Desert Hare+Evolve dominated..
---
Over the years HS is declining due to bad balance, bad card design, shitty expansions. Cant believe it
---
Of course! The odd cards weren't out in KnC, and Yeti is even. I tried to make it as obvious as possible lmao.
---
I don't stream and none of my friends play Hearthstone, but I had to share this with someone!  The deck is super aggressive and really fun to play.  Does pretty well against Shaman, if you're looking for something new.

That's what the second one is for! (‚òûÔæü„ÉÆÔæü)‚òû
---
What‚Äôs the list? Very interested
---
Explanation : I was playing transmogrifier in my rogue deck to get 0 cost legendaries with wishing wand, when my Rogue Galakrond turned into Krag'wa. I was curious to see what the invoke effect would be so I tried it and it used the Shaman Galakrond's.
---
Pretty cool if you ask me, but not sure how applicable this is for normal gameplays.
---
Agreed, mirror matches takes the least skill.
---
I hate mirror matches in any game.
---
Iam hesitate to craft Veranus yet.. on hsreplay the list without him performs better on rank 5?
---
What do you think?
---
Yeah but it aint a problem in other decks, its just a good card. And that's why i rather they nerf shaman specific cards instead of touching something neutral.
---
So it is class specific, useful information
---
I believe it was always intended to apply to the first 10 packs of the newest set but was bugged until sometime recently (most likely when the new store was released). The [original blog post](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/20852959) that announced the pack opening changes before Knights of the Frozen Throne says the following:
---
&gt; Beginning with the release of the next expansion, you‚Äôre also guaranteed to get a Legendary within your first 10 packs of a **new set**. 
---
The [Hearthpedia page](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics) related to card pack statistics describes the change the same way and hasn't been updated, so Blizzard hasn't made any edits to their own announcement of these changes to "cover up" any stealth adjustments to this system.
---
I remember when this update originally came out people interpreted the change the correct way and realized there was a bug that allowed you to get the guaranteed legendary in the first 10 packs even if you had opened some of those packs previously. I know myself and multiple other people bought old packs and received the guaranteed legendary but it was always interpreted as a bug and expected to be fixed relatively quickly. It never was and I think for whatever reason it went uncorrected despite being contradictory to the way Blizzard described it initially. Now that the new store is out it was either intentionally changed to work "properly" or - perhaps more likely - unintentionally made to work the way it was announced in the blog post.
---
Man, I really missed your take on this expansion. The Dragon Lord not giving a full breakdown on how HORRENDOUSLY broken these dragons and this meta is, is Sorely missed sir. I appreciate your knowledge and breakdown of mechanics without the absurd over hyping that some... Trumped up streamers might have or maybe streamers who I wish could entirely Skipperino to the point. Not having your ratings is just Killbin me...
---
(Tbh I have nothing against any of them but the opportunity to give a small amount of teasing to them showed and I had to take it.)
---
Believe or not, human beings have emotions
---
Yeah shaman is broken. Should be ilegal. Wait u mean 2k armor druid, nahh thats more balanced than shaman
---
Delete this post, I wanna continue being an evolve shaman on ladder.
---
Damn.. it's not craft able  :/
---
thanks for the answer tho
---
prep nerf like ramp wouldve been fine if they had touched anything else at all if their spells/cards,but they dint.
---
so now both are stuck with 5years(or more) of spells/Cards  designed and balanced around old versions of those and nothing has been changed
---
These nerfs are so bad, noone is gonna make them happen.
---
I agree that its pathetic ATM and is very poor design from their side, Im just saying that there is no need to do something drastic right now, to something that will likely fix itself in 1 week, if it hasn't bounced back at all after 1 week, THEN I think its time to do something. for example: it wouldn't make sense to nerf an oppressive deck if the deck is about to be rotated to wild within 1 week (unless its so broken that its even oppressive in wild to) because the power level in wild is so much hinger than standard, once it goes to wild it might just be a strong-is deck. not saying that your wrong, just that we should wait a week and see.
---
fiery war axe now has 2attack.
---
Please do Kibler! I love the show and the dynamic you guys have and will really miss it
---
Yes, i think lackeys are the worst thing to ever happen to hearthstone just behind to death knights.
---
Some decks play like 35 lackeys every game with Discovery slowing everything and getting random cards imposible to play around.
---
Every class is like some flavor of thief Rogue with different class cards and the same busted neutrals.
---
nope, but usually they remove the offering bonus before the next rotation
---
Imo Priest's problem is that developers seem to have no clue for years what to do with the class.
---
Priests has removal, but no minions to back it up. Psychopomp and Cathrina are good, but they require synergistic decks to get the most of them. The res mechanic itself is problematic on current form
---
I'm not sure when was the last time Priest got a card they could simply play and potentially threaten opponent with (TGT with Holy Champion and overcosted Paletress?). Even minions from Inner Fire decks come mostly from classic set and are mostly neutral
---
As a result of inability to decide what Priest should be it gets a ton of stuff for a boring "become your opponent" archetype (there is a similar case with Rogue and their random cards from opponent class)
---
Priest just lacks a direction. It has a lot of control stuff, but no way to win the game aside from Inner Fire, luckily stealing opponent's win conditions or boring him to death
---
It was supposed to be a joke, I don't expect this to happen but it was good enought for Warsong Commander, so... why not?
---
Fantastic deck, it didn't even cross me that, once you exhaust Waxadred memes, Necrium Apothecary is viable. 
---
As a Sap aficionado, I'd run two over one Edwin, still nice list!
---
Shaman's getting nerfed next week. So nothing is set.
---
I felt bad for you omg
---
Yes I understand this 100%, i was asking which one of the minions he thought was reduced to 0

---
Not really.  She's a nice highroll for early on, but not really that great if you don't get her on turn 4
---
I do have leeroy i forgot about him and i used to evasive dragons with rush (forgot their name)
---
I wouldn't say this makes it a fuck-up. If anything, it is an example of good design, and invokes (ha, pun intended) the nature of Cubelock exceedingly well. Cubelock had a few insanely powerful cards in their own right: notably Kobold Librarian and Bloodreaver Gul'dan. However, the power of Cubelock was based in having a variety of good cards that were not individually broken, but had *insane* synergy. Possessed Lackey, Dark Pact, Voidlord, and Skull of the Man'ari *all* came out in Kobolds and Catacombs (as did Librarian and Amethyst Spellstone) and combined *so well* together. If you took out Voidlord, suddenly the OG Lackey and Skull of the Man'ari become dramatically weaker. The inverse is true as well.
---
This meant that when Blizzard came along and nerfed two Cubelock cards (Dark Pact with halved healing and Possessed Lackey costing 6 instead of 5), it didn't kill the deck, but rather simply weakened it. And the best thing is, it didn't even kill the cards directly targeted: they were still run, *because they still fit into the deck so well.* 
---
Similarly, if we were to say "Corrupt Elementalist now costs (6) Mana, up from (5)," I think we can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that it would still see play in Galakrond Shaman. However, there's no denying that this weakens the deck.
---
With this perspective, it's actually a very *nice* problem we have with Galakrond Shaman. We can nerf it without fundamentally changing the deck. Faceless Corruptor can cost (6) and become a 5/3 (nerfing more than just Galakrond Shaman), even with the card text I suggested in my first comment to prevent Shudderwock shenanigans. 
---
Corrupt Elementalist can cost (6).
---
Dragon's Pack can give +3/+2 if you've Invoked twice instead of +3/+3.
---
These changes used in good combinations can have notable impact Galakrond Shaman without changing the nature of the deck. Tuning it down without neutering it totally.
---
And hey, instead of Hall of Faming Shudderwock, you can always just... nerf him to 10 Mana? It's not a massive nerf, but it's a decent one, most notable for: 1. delaying Shudderwock a turn (in games you really want to play him on curve) and 2. preventing you from making hand space so easily after Shudderwock (since he often adds tons of stuff, including Lackeys, to hand).
---
Ultimately I think Galakrond Shaman is an issue of power level, but the structure of its design means you can nerf it very effectively.
---
I hate to be that guy but don‚Äôt you guys make enough from streaming to cover the costs of a show that is just an extension of that without crowd sourcing? I‚Äôm sure you and fire at pull in 5 figures monthly just from twitch, not including additional YouTube income as well....
---
Thanks!  Yeah, that was the same reason I gave it a try
---
‚Å∑.
---
I‚Äôm stealing this deck list, thank you! I‚Äôve been trying to make a dragon hunter to no avail.
---
Play cancer, get cancer!
---
Pretty sure they make at least 5 figures each monthly from streaming, youtube. They‚Äôll be fine with that and the occasional sponsored video
---
Love the sound of it! Can't wait to give it a try! 
---
I do hope that god awful Plate Breaker never becomes a thing...
---
Nah, I prefer 4 8/8 with rush, it could even save him from dying the next turn.
---
I think you will get Marin from opening your first pack, but if so he won't be disenchantable.
---
Lol no, it's not, but 5% of the time you get to draw a 1 mana king krush or tirion on turn 2 and that's why we play it.
---
Faceless for me is 7/7.
---
Hey in the interim can you just disable Shaman?
---
This is total wins in play mode (casual+ranked), arena wins don't increase it.
---
I don‚Äôt remember priest to be a top class a year ago. Why priest deserve so many shitty cards in this expansion when everyone else are getting op
---
Anka is seeing some play these days, i've seen some streamers playing it in highlander rogue. With anubisath and other big deathrattles it's kinda alright imo, we'll see if necrium apothecary can carry the archetype hard enough to make it work though.
---
Happened with me too. You hover over any rush minion, the word rush appeared first and then card description. However, the card description and the word both went away right after I moved away from the card
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru.
---
Every cardgame starts with blanc minions.
---
You can not even close the keyboard or see the text you are typing.
---
Who also has this issue?
---
Human Fireball:
---
4 Mana 0/6.
---
At the start of the next turn, die horribly and deal 6 damage to the enemy hero.
---
I remember yesterday, yes. Why do you ask?
---
Just use ur browser. Activate the key on the blizzard website and buy your packs right there in the shop. - u will get ur packs while starting the hearthstone app.
---
Fireball gets blocked by taunts as well.
---
It was an auto-win basically.
---
Wtf kind of comment is this? This adds literally nothing to this conversation.
---
It depends. Did you do it on purpose in mutiple games? Because then the ban is more than justified. It's clearly not an indented intercation, therefore an exploit to abuse it.
---
i dont get you people what do you want? do you want all decks to be trash? even then some decks will be less trash than others. or is it just a case of "my favorite deck is not the best deck that ever existed"? every expansion there is a huge amount of people complaining: this is OP and that is OP and nerf this and nerf that well whats the point of everything sucking in the game? at least now you can do OP stuff and have fun.
---
Right. Wasn't there also an optional Patches the Pirate (an original HS character) encounter of some kind that rewarded you with a pet/a card/a collectible? I might be confused, as I mentioned I've never really played the game.
---
Well played.
---
Everyone whos tried it as is has told me they enjoyed it :D i posted it in /r/hearthdecklists twice, a theory craft and then this modified version having corrected the errors of the theory craft. Lots of information about it there.
---
Actually, having all those keywords without any drawback might be too much. It should probably get Overload: (2)
---
GG
---
This is funny on so many levels!
---
Literally everyone is talking about that card.
---
Evil recruiter needs lackey, while this works with every token.
---
Oh, and by your same logic, Sn1p-Sn4pLock wasn't a problem, because it was just a *sinergy* \- totally intenteded by the devs, I might add -, and yOu CoUlD pLay ArOuNd It KiLlInG thE OpPoNeNt By TuRn 3.
---
For... suggesting that Shaman gets nerfed in better ways than you're suggesting?
---
Amazing rebuttal, friend.
---
I can‚Äôt believe they didn‚Äôt know this would be  broken on release.
---
Was that you? Also thanks, pre emptive gg if it was you :D
---
What? No "suggestions" for nerfing rush cards from other classes aside from faceless?
---
Big surprise there.
---
a rogue deck that runs apothecary is called deathrattle rogue. nowhere is that deck referred to as tempo rogue, hence my confusion as to what deck you were talking about. i have no idea what "big 9/12 swing" is referring to (apothecary can be answered with silence just the same as edwin) and evidently you do not understand what the term swing means. a swing turn is a turn where you go from being behind on board to being ahead. the advantage "swings" from one person to another. a "swing turn" is not a synonym for a powerful turn. shuma is not in any way a "swing" because it does not remove anything on your opponent's side of the board the turn you play it or prevent anything on their side of the board from hitting face on the following turn. the advantage is still with your opponent until they fail to either answer it or get lethal.  
---
&gt;Shuma is also a swing, because quest hunter is really good at keeping a board either empty or at his favor.   
---
if the board is already empty or in your favor nothing you do can be a "swing".
---
1. Don't double respond to me just to whine.
---
2. Don't put words in my mouth.
---
3. Hilariously awful "same logic" you're using, there. Bloody Hell.
---
What about the one I mentioned tho. Are the budget version of those any good?
---
u mean YOUR charge minions. That would be too weak. Just make him have no rush like sea giant
---
Rogue also get some crappy invoke card while althrough their invoke is not as crappy as priest it still quite slow and doesn't have an immediate impact like warrior and shaman is
---
Holy smokes. I would not expect there to be that much damage contained in the deck! I'll give it a go :o
---
True, probably that‚Äôs why Zola was there to add more consistency, but yeah, it failed sometimes, the odds were low tho, I remember it failing sometimes and getting a win due to that but wasn‚Äôt that often
---
He also kills himself :D
---
This is top tier
---
Come to wild, we have different aromas of reno priest that actually works.
---
If it were me, I'd just throw in another Evasive Wyrm.  It's such a good card, shame I couldn't find room to fit 2
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand the joke, and also my mistake.
---
The technology isn't there yet.

We are yu gi oh now
---
There is a sequel already on front page from another user
---
Why not
---
I'm not familiar with the mobile layout. How can we tell that this is actually standard, and not a wild game where you queued up against a standard deck?
---
It's hilarious and a bit worrying if true.
---
I see some people saying the game was boring when it was about curve. I guess I'm a boring dude, because that was the time I enjoyed HS. Stopped playing daily by the end of BRM, and fully stopped a few months into the whole wild/standard thing.

6/7/6 Dragon | Battlecry: Change the Health of all enemy minions to 1.  
---
The issue was never that it's not profitable. It's just not AS profitable as everything else. And it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, the less and less effort they invest into the game mode. Loss of leaderboards and other stuff harms interest for hardcore players, which causes less general attention in the game mode and trickles down into more casual players...
---
I don't expect much to change in the short term, but publishing the leaderboard is the least they could do.
---
Posting just to show I was here for this legendary post.
---
r/chargeyourphone
---
Yeah, it was consistent enough to be a major problem there's no doubt about that.
---
But the bigger hitter was the fact that those Shudderwocks going back to your hand cost (1), which meant that if you survived a turn (likely the case thanks to Glacial Shard and Lifedrinker procs), you would just Shudderwock next turn and annihilate the opponent.
---
Not quite the case here with a 9 Mana Shudderwock and Faceless Corruptor. Strong, yes, but it doesn't necessarily lock the opponent out of the game like the first Shudderwock combo did. It also fills your hand up with Lackeys and their generated Spells/Dragons. You have no access to Glacial Shard, either, so your ability to nullify a board with a Shudderwock is limited.
---
i.e. I don't think Shudderwock is inherently problematic in its current iteration, and a nerf to Shaman in general (specifically Galakrond Shaman) severely weakens any Shudderwock win condition anyway.
---
Where is the random award guy when we need him ? This is really deserved 5 rewards !
---
Boi im still trying to climb the ladder with a nomeme priestü§£
---
Very well edited 100x better than mine. I had an idea for a sequel. The scene where agent tries to convert neo and then Neo explodes killing all agents (Neo would be the new meta deck next week) but not sure if i will do it since my editing sucks. Feel free to do it if you want.
---
What kind of nerf do you want to see? A nerf to the rushy 2/1 bois?? Perhaps a nerf to Corrupt Elementalist? Dragon's Pack maybe? All of the above lol? 
---
I really wonder what they'll do without completely destroying Shaman.
---
do u mean it as the old warsong?
---
&gt; nerf patch
---
Al‚ÄôAkir: ***Rush, Taunt, Divine Shield,*** **MEGA-WINDFURY**
---
Lol, you were the hardest one to figure out how to use word play to tease! I respect everyone I poked fun at and appreciate the time and work you all put into your content!
---
Quest + Galakrond is a problem too. How are you supposed to answer 4 8/8's with rush on turn 9?
---
They could remove the rush. Or mabye restrict it to 6/6's. 7 mana summon 2 6-6's with rush is still great.
---
Dont be fooled though hehe, mage is practically guaranteed win with this deck, they are too slow.
---
The ladder is filled with shamans and warriors and those 2 are very tough matchups to overcome
---
Let's say... 2%. Yeah. 2%.
---
Well shucks. That's a bummer. I'm not even touching ladder rn though because of how brutal shaman is currently.
---
I see there‚Äôs someone else who‚Äôs spent over 10k dust on cards he can‚Äôt use ;)

I played from Tempest to Dragon's Maze and the amount of bans they're having to do now is bonkers.  They used to go years without standard bans.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
This line is actually a reference to Futurama if I'm not mistaken
---
Sounds like they might be cutting ties with Hearthstone or scaling back at least
---
oh dear
---
Connectivity is not the same thing as a stable connection. You should know that with that username.
---
Priest regularly kills from 30. Leeroy+Shadowstep deals 12 damage. There's a difference.
---
Quest hunter, me personally use highlander mage with 60 percent win rate to level 5
---
High cost card that you can discount are so dumb especially for shaman let alone adding rush to it...
---
as a devoted big priest hater in happy that priest isnt meta now. tho you all should know how hs balance team handles balancey they make single classes busted for a year and then nerf them again while making other classes s tier, right now its priests turn to be "bad" (barnes nerf, not really good cards this xpac). considering how unfair balanced galakrond is anyways, some classes get an extra legendary FREE card on top of their usual ones while others cant even use the neutral invoke cards, i dont think priest gala matters too much, you can still play dk anduin with other packages instead of invoke. imo priest has good enough cards to be able to deal with what will become meta, just let it settle and then you can start teching against it
---
No
---
Kk nostradamus you're right.
---
Indeed, it's close to my wrist. :)
---
Wonder if jade druid would be at all viable in this meta
---
Vs Shaman, it's pretty much "kill them before Galakrond", because you can't recover after.  So, no.  No trading.  They'll be trading with all their 2/1 elementals.
---
Really, you're just looking for Stormhammer.  My ideal hand vs shaman would probably be sharpshooter, faerie dragon, stormhammer, dragonbane.
---
I don‚Äôt blame players for wanting to win, I get it. There will always be those people who net deck the top level deck/decks for easy win, even though they‚Äôre not competitive or anything which really strikes me as odd.
---
You‚Äôre right, people love those absolute power crazy decks, because they‚Äôre just fun. And yeah, people are going to play it more.
---
I think the problem with net deckers is that they don‚Äôt try hard enough. They gravitate to these decks because they don‚Äôt want their time wasted with decks that *might* win. This creates a vacuum where the most ‚ÄúOP‚Äù decks just really aren‚Äôt ever challenged. People won‚Äôt put in the effort to hard counter the meta, but rather just be part of the meta.
---
Please do run a patreon to continue a Hearthstone talk show (with Whose Meme, or some variant)! Omnislash had a great balance of news analysis, meta discussion, and goofiness. And it‚Äôs really a treat to see my favorite HS pros interact.
---
What do you think could have turned out better? I didn't have a full HD picture of the item at that time, seen other hearthstones tattoos online and with the artist we tried to figure out what I liked and what I didn't of the other works I saw.

Thank you! I'm glad you like it :)
---
As a hunter first player, I think Dragonbane might be my new favorite card in the game.
---
I was nervous to try to complete the climb once i reach rank 2, but then i said screw it, i have to make before they nerf the shaman for the credit
---
Now THIS is dedication.

---
what about totems tho 10/6 rush
---
It's all oger now
---
I find Zul'Jin superfluous. 
---
IMO highlander hunter should be a fast burn deck that goes face at every opportunity. Most of your games should be put out of reach or won by time time Zul'Jin would even make sense to play.
---
Have you considered putting in Ursatrons to tutor Dragonbane and Amalgams?
---
Man, priest players are the saltiest! I'm having fun with my Galakrond control priest. Is it a little slow? Amen. Is Chronobreaker terrible? God yes. But Murozond is great (when discovered) and Galakrond's battlecry has saved/turned the game for me more times than I can count. I for one am thankful that I don't have to shove inner fire/divine spirit into my deck to have a hope of winning.
---
...no.  That's fucking brilliant.  Why didn't I think of that?
---
Again
---
Me.  Too.
---
They did, but it drowned in all the Shaman
---
i guess you ended up winning tho, so fuck him.
---
I. An seer now this is confusing, but battle cry only works from the hand HAND
---
So pre nerf it is then?
---
This game will never regain it's luster, and they have noone to blame but themselves.
---
&gt;So far Dragonsbane is doing absolutely nothing for me.
---
6 mana for 7 face damage and 7 mana for 8 on the next turn is real friggin good if you can keep the boot on your opponent's neck early.
---
4 mana?
---
That's why I rope every shaman I see. No one wins.
---
r/woooosh
---
7/7 f2p btw
---
hahaha make fun of virgin hahaha
---
They finally made a good rager.
---
Just build a collection and it will be much cheaper. I‚Äôm f2p and have had highlander mage since Reno came out. And I have highlander hunter.
---
r/fuckthes

That would be great. The insects won't know what hit them
---

---
It went away after about 5 hours.....i actually had to work at work.....so frustrating
---
The new tog priest seems pretty good. Murozond lets you trade back after the enemy player pays the Kings Ransom.
---
they really need to add a 4 mana 7/7 to shaman....

Point well made. The first deck I try after every expansion is Priest decks, and after playing 3 games I realized they have nothing. For me, the worst part is that Galakrond HP is the only to have no immediate impact on the board - Warrior gains attack, Rogue gains lackeys that can be played for just 1 mana, Warlock summons minions and Shaman goes without saying. Priest has NO rush minions and only 1 taunt, and most other minions require deckbuilding around them. While, yes, you can luck out sometimes, Invoke cards are generally understatted to balance the impact that invoking gets on the board. Since Priest has NO board impact from this, you are playing understatted minions to get more cards - and losing a LOT of tempo in the proccess.
---
Sucks that this is the state the class is in right now, and sucks even more to think that after the rotation things might get even worse if they don‚Äôt address these issues you mentioned. The game right now is all about board fighting (even mages deck this year revolved around Conjurer‚Äôs Calling to play big minions), and Priest is the absolute worst class at this right now.
---
Seym#1690 NA. Trading 80g quest
---
Yeah it happens to me as well... Let's hope they fix it.
---
And also is budget quest warlock good or the Galakrond just a better way to go
---
Too bad Shadowreaper Anduin isn't in Standard anymore, as well as Barnes and the "enough good cards" you're talking about.
---
Oh God I miss Voidform so much....
---
the spirit is there and it's what matter the most, but the ressemblance could have been better especially the blue fluid part. The 3d impression also could have been better if he had done a transition in the top/left part between the grey and the black line (not as much as the bottom one but still one is needed imo )
---
Yes dalaran can't attack ethier
---
Maybe you forgot the "viable" part which, who would have guessed, it's quite important.
---
Just because you happened to lose a match against a Priest (the class doesn't have a 0% winrate) it doesn't mean it's playable, even more at competitive levels
---
My dragon control pally has been doing nicely in casual and I've only seen 1 shaman out of 15 games
---
Wow, now this is quality content, +1 Internets points
---
Thanks dragon dad üêâüíö
---
How can you not havea choince
---
just play wild LOOOOOOOOL 4HEad
---
on a serious note, please abandon standard, its ultra p2w compared to wild, has been in a worse state than wild forever now, even with sniplock around wild has been way healthier. wild meta rn is basically the dream of every standard player ever. only thing thats a pain in the ass rn is secretmage but thats why we have renodecks or secreteater in basically every deck
---
PogChamp
---
I hope they destroy this deck. Shaman will still have an older style quest deck to fall back on and a powerful aggro deck. So they can gut galakrond as much as they want.
---
For the shudderwock fantasy and quest synergy, obviously.
---
I had this earlier only mine said rush.
---
I've played a similar deck but cut Frizz since it didn't really put in that much work, I also used Leeroy instead of the 6 Mana Legendary Dragon and Tracking instead of Frizz, it's been working really well and will work even better when Shaman gets nerfed I think.
---
It‚Äôs still a pretty tough match up. The pressure from this deck is unreal. If you draw bad (2 bankers and your holy wrath) early in the game it gets out of hand.
---
"I've yet to meet Priest players that actually, really, like Inner Fire priest."  
---
x100 times this: it's cool to have a non Control Priest sometimes, but this is straight boring. You play a game hoping that a high health minion sticks and then you blow up your opponent out of nowhere. It's strong ok, but a player doesn't main Priest for these shenanigans.
---
Well ther is the 4 mana 5/7 dragon I guesse?,
---
6 hp is just wtf
---
Battlecry, Inspire, and Deathrattle are keywords that tells you when something happens.
---
Invoking Galakrond, especially because no Galakrond Hero Power is targeted, could happen more than just when you play a minion. Deathrattles, Inspire effects, or on Spells (such as Invocation of Frost) are all potential triggers for a Galakrond Invocation.
---
Choose One and Combo are the same. Choose Ones are on-play effects that you choose between, and Combos are on-play effects that only occurs when you've already played a card that turn. Both are twists on Battlecry, and thus are themselves their own trigger.
---
Glad to help! I was trying a heavier midrange version of this earlier with Zilliax and the evasive rush and evasive taunt. It felt like a delayed aggro deck and couldn't reestablish board against faceless corruptor, which I'm sure is getting nerfed.
---
Your version looks a lot stronger for aggro, with great results.
---
It is utterly ridiculous they nerfed Priest the *instant* it gained any strength last expansion.
---
I guess they were getting their ideas from CThun, which consist of only Battlecries: + to CThun (or other effects).
---
Nice details
---
Hoenstly Galak Shaman would be good even possibly tier 1 without Quest but Quest is what really makes it and Shaman in general absurd. I don't know how they thought printing such a design limting Quest was ever a good idea. Well I guess it's not design limiting because they just decided to ignore it exists and give Shaman even more Battle Cry minions so they could be even stronger.
---
It feels like they didn't even playtest the Galak cards with the Quest and if they did somehow playtest it they were out of their minds to let through. Honestly I think Quest should be nerfed to 7 or even 8 Battle Cry minions because while it's still in Standard in its current form it makes every Battle Cry card way too good.
---
1/144
---
\*the chance to have the same minion three times on your first round in battlegrounds.  
---
1/1728 if you're only looking at mecharoo.
---
Can someone please tell me what software is used to make videos like this? This is awesome!
---
The problem with Reno Priest is that it has just 2 gameplans, and no other way around it: play \[\[Spawn of Shadows\]\] and go combo, or bore your opponent to death (and probably lose nonetheless).

4/5/4 | Inspire: Deal 4 damage to each hero.  
---
A little off topic, but is playing spirit + max upgrade galakrond with 8 malygos in deck even worth to make a deck around? It would be +35 spell damage (if you can kill the spirit), one sinister strike and you got 38 damage. Or that would be an overkill? :D
---
Priest is still paying up for razakus machine gun era.
---
Agree with you.
---
JUST MAKE THE 5 MANA 3/3 - DEATHRATTLE INVOKE TWICE AND I'M GOOD!!! would be nice if corrupt the waters would require to play 8 battlecry minions.
---
I disagree with your reasoning. Telling someone to wait for multiple expansions (4 to 8 months) before they can use cards they just bought is ridiculous. By that time Priest's Galakrond would be on the verge of being rotated out.
---
Even in a "control meta" Priest's Galakrond is too slow/unreliable. I was playing against a Dr Boom Control Warrior earlier today and ended up losing because I never had control of the board - while I was spending 9 mana playing a War Golem (hero power + Velen) he'd spend 9 mana killing my Velen and filling the board. Half the time when I hero powered I'd get a almost useless minion:
---
* A 1 mana 0/2 Test Subject that does nothing because I had no way to kill/buff it.
---
* A 5 mana 5/8 Crystal Elemental that "dies" to 1 damage because I had no way to heal it.
---
* A 6 mana 5/5 Lady in White that actually _lowered_ the attack of the minions in my deck.
---
* A 6 mana 5/5 Cloning Dude that I couldn't activate because I had no buff spells.
---
etc.
---
Now remember that each of these minions effectively cost 2 extra mana due to needing to hero power. So you're locked into playing one massively overcosted minion per turn, while your opponent could at any point swing the board back in their favor - hope you have an extra removal/AOE spell. Hell, I often end up unable to use the hero power because my hand is full of crap that I don't want to waste my turn playing. This'd continue until he chipped my health down - which I can no longer heal back due to the new hero power, unlike Dr Boom and his blast shield - and then he killed me with Grom.
---
This isn't even just a matter of balance. The hero power is frustrating and unfun to play with. And it's clear that they changed it late in development without much thought (they mentioned it used to give you a Priest spell, which are much more reactive). It's almost funny that the reason the hero power sucks is because the rest of Priest's minions suck... or maybe we just have to keep waiting for a meta that they're perfect for...
---
I think starting the nerf with removing Rush is a good idea though as it doesn't kill the card but it does make it a good amount worse. Further nerfs after that if necessary would be a good idea.
---
I'll also add Corrupt the Waters along with Shudderwock as cards that should of never been printed. Corrupt the Waters is such a design warping broken level of a card it's absurd they thought it was a good idea. Every Battle Cry card now needs to be balanced around the existence of that card which is fucking stupid because only Shaman can utilize them disgustingly well.
---
I'd like to see Corrupt the Waters nerfed go 7 or 8 Battle Cry minions and I hoenstly don't think you can realistically nerf Shudderwock without further limting the amount of Battle Cries it can repeat.
---
It would definitely limit its usage more. Decks like Zoo Warlock would still run it but I doubt every single deck in the game would run it.
---
What ever happened to priest lol
---
\&gt; I don't think we've ever had a keyword being activated by another keyword 
---
Recruit.
---
I se the communism sickle and hammer on that card
---
HoFing Prep would of been way way better because then they could of given Rogue stronger spells and not need to design around Prep existing.
---
"Volunteer" volunteer is without a reward
---
I'm not an expert but it seems like a bad version of Tog Druid which has tools like Naturalize to burn you out after the switch and much better draw to get to your win faster.
---
Bump
---
4/6 taunt * 2 (twin emp.)
---
cost 7 Mana, require (invoke) C'thun twice, legendary, considered the OP card of WOTG.
---
It's ludacris they think dragon pack is fine, also it had nothing to do with dragon.
---
A very simple nerf is require holding a dragon.
---
Dude just discover better 4Head
---
Just tried the deck out. 2/2 vs shaman this far, last game the shaman mutated his Mogu unto Grommash and attacked face, straight into my Flame trap + Misdirection.
---
10/10
---
I've been playing Galakrond Zoo Warlock and I tend to win the match up unless they draw the nuts. It's anecdotal but I find Shaman tends to struggle to deal with my early pressure.
---
I also have some bliz money from WoW tokens that are cash equivalent. Any good deals going on right now with the new expansion? Thanks!
---
Galaxy brain discover 5head.
---
Nah i'm not complaining about discoverying worse than opponents. It's just weird and super random. I get that discover is a random mechanic but you can at least control it a little by restricting self generate or self discover.
---
What's your general playstyle with this deck?
---
I have tried before to contact Blizzard support to try to get people like this banned. Their official policy is that they‚Äôre 100% within their right to intentionally ruin the game for everyone they come across. Blizzard is literally on the side of the griefers on this one and it sucks.
---
In the meantime, just ignore them, don‚Äôt even give them the satisfaction of doing an emote, play your turns well to beat them, and play something else to pass the time while you wait.
---
HSReplay tells you what to keep in the mulligan too, the steps are just less direct.
---
It would also be a Nerf on any sort of galakrond rouge cause they all run spirit of the shark
---
Swap demons with elementals and there ya go
---
Yeah i just wanted karma :), ur kinda right
---
Now that's a galaxy brain idea :D I think it's worth a shot, seems very interesting. Gotta live the meme dream!
---
I genuinely did not know they were separate. I actually thought Omni was Kibler, Firebat &amp; Frodan (that added others later)
---
TIL
---
Which would be ideal.
---
A bad internet connection would make you DC or lag one or two turns, not rope perfectly while playing your turn every time. It‚Äôs extremely easy to tell the difference.
---
‚ÄúNo u‚Äù - you probably.
---
If it said summon that would imply minions only, this includes spells so it says play.  As others have mentioned battlecrys only work when played from the hand.
---
oh no no no PepeLaugh
---
It spread like flags have -1 attack
---
Yes, you can get banned for this. Disguised toast was banned for showcasing something similar on stream some time back.  [https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/06/zero-to-legend-hearthstone-player-banned-for-using-free-win-priest-exploit/](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/06/zero-to-legend-hearthstone-player-banned-for-using-free-win-priest-exploit/)
---
In the past i tried the dollmaster combo wombo, basically i emptied my deck, than shuffled like 15 malygos in my deck and than drew 3 for 0 with wondrous wand, 3 1/1 malygos + 3 full size malygos for 0 mana, that's +30 spell damage, but the combo itself was very inconsistent.
---
Has anyone tried it against a summoned Jaraxxus?
---
How could anyone think that Chronobreaker is fair when Abomination exists and is completely unplayed? The card is so bad it's insulting.
---
the reason the invoke for priest is bad is not because it offers no tempo, but because the minions you get are random. mage quest had the same problem, getting a random mage card for 2 mana was terrible, because it had no synergy with your deck. You would spend 2 mana and got a bunch of draw spells in fatigue, or simply unimpactful cards that you just cant develop your win condition with. Same with priest invokes.
---
ah see, you failed to realize that Priest IS the meme.
---
Lol. There are so many people doing this, roping every turn on purpose. It has nothing to do with internet connections.
---
201 with Shaman then you just won a game with this
---
Fuck blizzard, fuck ressurect priest and fuck priest cards. I muss Cthun priest:(((
---
Also queen of pain and i think that secretkeeper changes
---
u/DisguisedToastHS
---
The perfect man for the job!
---
Shudderwok is the part I can't beat either.  My rogue deck can beat all the other shaman bullshit one time, but infinite Shaman Galakrond turn after turn is unbeatable by any deck in HS besides Holy Wrath paladin.
---
Toxic reinforcement on 1 if possible agaisnt all matchups except warrior.
---
Vs warrior its the only time you fight for board in the first three rounds. Your important cards vs warrior early on are dwarven sharpshooter and explosive trap.
---
You only play sharpshooter on 1 if you are going first. When going second you only play sharpshooter on 1 if they have no turn 1 play. If not you coin out sharpshooter on 2 and take out the 2 dmg unit with hero power.
---
Rest of the matchups when going first you always hero power on 2.
---
When you have coin you can often coin out your turn 3 card, especially if you have two in hand, ie eagle horn bow or animal companion.
---
Phase stalker is exclusively round 4 or higher play, hes the only value engine of the deck, unless a situation arises where you can coin him on 3 with hero power.
---
Is starting basics.
---
Nut hand is toxic reinforcement phase stalker eaglehorn bow, except vs warrior its dwarven sharpshooter phase stalker eagle horn bow.
---
The only 5 cards ever worth keeping in mulligan are dwarven sharpshooter, toxic reinforcements, phase stalker, eaglehorn bow and animal companions.
---
All other cards are hard mulliganed for those 5, priority being to your turn 1 and 3 play, so toxoc reinforcement being best 8/9 matchups, eaglehorn bow best turn 3 play. Youll settle for dwarven sharpshooter and animal companion
---
I meant a chef nomi priest sir XD
---
I don't think the Priest player fantasy necessarily has to be a control deck. I think all of us Priest players want to do is interesting moves, clever board manipulation, shadow stuff etc. Nobody wants just to play a big minion and hit it with the hero power for the rest of the game.
---
The priest class has been a disaster for years. Sure, once in a blue moon the planets align and they get a disgusting combo deck that no one, not even us priest players, want to have in the game but other than that...
---
At this point they are just throwing random gimmicks at priest and hopes something sticks. A little resurrect, a little copy-your-opponents-deck, a pinch of deathrattle, some lackey, some random combo piece.
---
It's just all over the place and nothing comes together. And this has been pointed out to Blizzard for quite some time now.
---
But the Bug only works if you have the cards crafted right? For me it still shows 28/30 and asks me to autocomplete it.
---
Priest has better survivability tools though in terms of board clears and removal, plus the deck draws pretty damn fast by using the speedy Amara package (Dead Ringer, Thalnos, Twilight's Call bolstered by copies of Exploding Sheep)
---
It comes from the tooltip of invoke cards. (Add a *lackey* to your hand, summon a 2/1 with *rush*...) On PC the bold word comes up before the rest of the tooltip but it doesnt stay there like that.
---
How long did it take you to get into 12345 club?
---
Member when warleader used to buff your enemy's murlocs?
---
It‚Äôs true, people get upset their homebrews they spent 10 minutes on get demolished by decks that were refined by thousands of people over tens of thousands of games. I still think Shaman needs a nerf though, just to avoid two metas in a row of Shamanstone

You‚Äôre scum
---
By not having the dust to create a wild deck
---
Awesome deck! I pulled a Dragonbane, is that a worthwhile include? if so what would you cut?
---
F to pay respects to your opponent.
---
Also, once you invoke, your opponent now knows that you have him in your hand, right?
---
I don't know why Galakrond wasn't a steal card to fit Priest's theme. Invoke - "Add a random card from your opponent's deck to your hand". Sure, you'll occasionally get useless crap, but I'd wager even the worst of it would be _way_ better than garbage Priest minions like Test Subject, Lady in White, Crystal Elemental, etc.
---
It's really obvious they didn't put much thought or effort into Priest's mechanic. Originally it added a random Priest spell but they changed it because your hand would get clogged with "unusable conditional spells"... yet apparently they don't care about your hand getting clogged with conditional minions (like the ones I listed) just because you can play them as a ball of stats? Thanks for the 3 mana 0/2, 9 mana 5/5 that nerfs my deck and 7 mana 5/1 Blizzard.
---
&gt;cow dick
---
Wut?
---
Idc what other people say, you shouldn't either. This is fire, ive played hs since i was like 15. The blue in the little swirl is really cool too
---
Same here. Unless they get some early Sandstorm Elementals they're a little too slow to keep up
---
But it feels soooo much better to beat shamans with cyclone giant mage or freeze mage :D (i have to confirm: went yesterday from Rank 1 to 3 during 2 hours, but man those wins felt amazing :D )

Highlander Warlock better
---
Probably because omnislash found out that they all played shaman.
---
God forbid people actually want to experiment and try new things instead of playing/playing against a refined deck in the first week of the expansion, am I right?
---
Blocked and reported.
---
Trading 80g quest, miggy#1331 NA. I'll show and you go

Just punch in a face everyone who has preordered, might. Change something
---
Hsreplay
---
Is this a common complain?
---
Highlander Warlock...
---
after I had to freeze them for more 2 turns I realized that maybe the triple is not so worth but eventually I won the game
---
Thinking the dragon tribe has too much synergy right now. Take that away. Buff its stats to 7/7 to compensate?
---
You could maybe cut 1 life drinker for dragon bane, as lifedrinker is often your turn 6 hero power/life drinker.
---
Youd have to test dragonbane out, you just dont want it to hit units lol, could add spice/fun to the deck, rng element for extra 2 damage potential
---
But lose healing side, often 3 hp is a factor between surviving and dieing
---
You can still evolve it into Charged Devilsaur after your other charge minions have attacked.
---
But then rogue would become completely OP in Wild if they didn't balance around Prep existing anymore.
---
Oh wait, they don't care about Wild.
---
Mogu Fleshshaper, 8 mana, at the end of your turn, become 8/8 and attack a random minion, then go back to its previous state.
---
Who would‚Äôve possibly thought giving yourself more time and glitching a minion is an exploit üò≥
---
Your last statement is correct. It is random.  If a dragon discovers a dragon, the pool it is drawing from are all the dragons, which would include itself.  What would you do to change this?
---
Fuck you cunt. I'd beat you with any starter decks.
---
Taz'Dingo is so wholesome
---
Because excluding themselves would be against the wording on the cards?
---
ive actually been avoiding Shaman because he just feels so... off to play, he used to be my favorite archetype when hagatha was just about 3 weeks out. loved it, now he just feels... too much rushed.
---
What? There are other Modes in Hearthstone then Battlegrounds?
---
All I‚Äôm hearing is excuses.
---
Like a gender studies major complaining they can‚Äôt find a job.
---
You want someone to fix a problem you are unwilling to take the steps to solve.
---
It started around a week ago. It's been happening on and off, and since last night I havnt been able to log in at all.
---
Everyone: Shaman meta is a bit fucking much don't you think? Maybe we dial everyone up a bit or dial them down a bit?
---
Blizzard: Hey check out this new expansion and all the cool new toys for Shaman.
---
same here gonna make a post too.
---
I wanted to see more of this.  Awesome!
---
Having Zuljin as a 1/30 card to retake the board, allow choice of 2 damage targets and often get a buffer can be quite crucial to finishing off games that you might not be favoured in. The secret reload also can save you.
---
Idea for a card. Dragon Equalizer. 8 cost spell that for the rest of the game, ALL dragons are 6/6. It's legendary.
---
You can't beat Witch-Hunt with Toki, mate.
---
ok
---
Only if it costs 4 mana
---
same problem, hope it will be fixed soon
---
I cant log in either
---
Maybe stop crying and build counterdeck? Every time when streamer don‚Äôt show counterdeck people saying ‚Äûop,  blizzard nerf!‚Äù It is first week, meta not stabilized.
---
Try galakrond rogue or talanji galakrond priest

The perfect man for the job doesn't even play Hearthstone?
---
I understand a certain level of powercreep is inevitable, but the Hearthstone team did nothing in this respect to prevent it from happening. On the contrary, they encouraged powercreep by obliterating the usefulness of basic cards and a lot of classic cards with the standard format, which constantly rotates in better versions of these cards. Plus their refusal to let games be decided by RNG, e.g. 1-cost class cards that can discover 10-cost cards which give you the win next turn. 
---
Of course classic and basic cards can't keep up with that. It's really sad to imagine what Hearthstone could look like today if it didn't go down that RNG road. 
---
Anyway, it could be easy to call the developers incompetent, and it would be warranted if looked at standard, but Battlegrounds was a huge saving grace lately, so that speaks for them.l
---
I then wrote three paragraphs of fairly in depth tips for people who care....
---
Because that is typically the way minions have an effect when played.
---
Battlecry and deathrattle tell you *when* an effect will happen.
---
Other keywords like Adapt, Recruit, and Invoke, tell you *what* an effect does.
---
What a chad
---
Same for me...
---
Well first, a multi million company should be able to fix such exploits fast enough to prevent damage, not just banning people for their own mistakes.
---
Second, it maybe would be a problem in a world where this effect could be easily set up (Nozdormu at below 5 mana for example). But you have to invest so much resources to just make it work, and then it's always a slower variant of the already existing otk maly variants. So I don't get it why a weaker meme variant should be bannable but the op variant who instantly kills the opponent is not, which was the reason some of the set up cards got nerfed in the past (aviana/kun/malygos).
---
Same
---
Arena mvp

It's not like hearthstone is consistent with it's own rules.
---
Just a qol to improve gameplay. "Discover another dragon", "create another murloc".
---
I just think it's is healthier and wanna know what ppl think.
---
You must be new to blizz. They‚Äôre a small indie company who would rather ban first then fix it.
---
Same. I think blizzards servers are gone (
---
How long have you not been able to login?
---
I was able to log on a few times today. However, it's been a few minutes since i haven't been able to.
---
Just word it with discover another dragon, create another murloc.
---
Discover sometimes feel like a more powerful echo.
---
Because that shit is rigged. I'd beat your main deck with any starters.
---
Imo, Reno Priest is worse than Renolock, but better than Reno Mage (especially if they don't have Luna's Pocket Galaxy on 7).
---
You know when a sub reaches meme video quality of /r/wallstreetbets something has gone horribly wrong
---
I tried to login last night got disconnected saw this. I tried again today and this is what I got. It happened a few times last week too.
---
Obviously I'm not a pro or self-proclaimed Hearthstone wizard so I'm not going to try and analyse every single replay but just from a first glance I'd say your deck is really underpowered. I assume you're a F2P player? Nothing against it, I even applaud it.. but obviously the deck and cards you're using won't cut it in this expansion, or the last one for that matter.
---
If you're going to want to climb the ladder in this meta, you're going to have to improve that deck. Get some cards in from the last expansions. I'd look up the latest Tier 1 decks and do your best to make a budget version out of them.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That or, just play Shaman for ez wins, lul.
---
Good luck!
---
Edit: I see your last couple of replays are a Shaman deck, definitely looks a lot stronger. Should help you climb in the long run. The mage decks is definitely severely underpowered though.
---
You can do that as much as you want but don't expect others to do the same.
---
Lol most of the time I see it end with a pair of wyverns and one of them eats a marked shot to its face.
---
A few minutes. I quited game and a few minutes after my friend wrote me that he can't log in. I tried and couldn't either.
---
Yeaa i membe ( with sound of member berries)
---
Right, and after you lose you'd complain about that being rigged, too.
---
Why you are so sore about this I don't know, rofl.
---
Bullshit. There's tons of accessible Wild decks and most top tier Standard decks nowadays are just as if not more expensive than the Wild ones.
---
Thrall is the chosen one...
---
I DIDN'T KNOW
---
**Murozond** 
---
Is actually big in wild right now.  (Togwaggle-&gt;Murozond is the second most played deck in wild at the moment according to HSReplay).  Doesn't necessarily mean its going to dominate the meta, of course.  (Pirate Warrior is the most played deck right now, and I'm skeptical about how good that deck will be when the dust settles; I think there's better aggro decks.  Likewise, Tog-&gt;Muroz needs to compete with warlock mech'a'thun for the control deck with a combo finisher, and maybe that deck will turn out to be better).
---
Still, finding a home in wild means something.
---
More like F to pay respects to OP for playing Galakrond priest.
---
I love Op for playing the deck though, Galakrond Priest is the first thing I crafted golden when the DoD came out
---
I got disconnected last night. I tried logging in today and this is what I see. I think my previous disconnects are unrelated though.

My only experience with Mindflayer was the following:
---
Choose enemy King Krush, then kill it &amp; pass. 
---
Opp plays Zephyrs, discover Shadow Madness, steals Mindflayer, trades him &amp; kills me with new Krush.
---
Cause they're shit cunts who can't even balance anything properly. How the fuck is it that I cruise through with the other 3 guys and get shit fucked with a shitty luck based bitch gnome
---
It saw play in bomb warrior, the only deck it can be included in...
---
First time someone played the 3/9 taunt that summons 3 1 cost minions they summoned the barrel for me. That was annoying to say the least.
---
And you wouldn't beat me to begin with m8
---
Same here
---
Dunno mate. How is it you lose your head over it as well?
---
Wild decks don't require any more dust than standard decks.
---
Some valid points, but I can't help but notice that the amount of commas in this is beyond ridiculous
---
Because they're cunts and I want them to see this. I really hope they do.
---
Yeah,others will just netdeck the current best win rate deck without thinking and then shit on others actually trying to be creative like the above commenter.
---
Are you talking about the mage deck? That's the arena of course...
---
I tried to uninstall and reinstall the game, it did not fix the problem.
---
then rogue might actully get good spells for wild
---
Same, can‚Äôt log in.
---
It‚Äôs definitely not bullshit. Take me for example. I‚Äôve been playing since release and I dusted all my wild cards as they rotate so I can afford new decks in standard. I literally don‚Äôt have the dust right now to switch if I wanted. How is that so hard to believe that not everybody can instantly switch to wild at a moments notice? Especially newer players at that.
---
If they did, they'd almost certainly laugh at how pathetic you're being.
---
Some salty rager who can't remotely contain their emotions over a couple of losses is probably far from being even remotely enough to make them concerned or hurt.
---
Packs please
---
well this is FFFF awesome.. hehehe.. !
---
Fizz is cute but only a single card. Quest Hunter is better because you can unleash+hero power for a lot of burst after they play the invoker.
---
That would only be relevant if dusting cards gave back a 1:1 return but it doesn‚Äôt. So if I have no dust and a standard deck, how do I get to play wild please?
---
same here, EU server

Zoo does not do well against Secret Mage. They have better tempo and defensive tools.

Was playing a game,then it said game was recorded and have to restart,then couldnt start HS agan(same message as in thread here by op) and battlenet wont start either now for me.

Thats not how blizzard's nerf work. They will probably increase 1 or 2 mana.

I once had a game as Nefarian and had murlocs with poisonous, divine shield, wind fury and another buff that I forgot

It was pretty broken

Combo Priest is still a thing, right?

You're the dumb cunt that can't even beat me. None of the post was even directed to your bitch ass. You're White Knighting shitty devs. Good job shit bag. I would tell you to get cancer too but you already are.
---
I think it is unreasonable to be frustrated that the possibility of infinite value exists.  The percentage of times you get the same card more than once in row is extremely small.
---
With that sweet, sweet, Al'akir synergy?
---
wait its eye and not life?
---
packs please, upvotes to the left.
---
Broke what?
---
Priest isn‚Äôt in the best spot at this moment but if you play it amet has great synergy with the reborns because the 2nd copy come back at the health of Amet instead of 1 as well as the other guy said combos still possible I believe
---
&gt; You're the dumb cunt that can't even beat me.
---
Oof.
---
And I could beat you up IRL. Fite me kappa.
---
Man, Flick will just destroy some decks in those Tavern Brawls where you pick two or three cards and get a whole deck of those.
---
I'm going to guess you're not a wild player.

It should be 1/20 * 1/20 * 1/400 packs, so 1/160000 (if I'm doing it right and the source is right too)

You'd get shit wrecked even worse irl m8. I would literally make you my bitch. You'll be reminded of all those days that you got bullied.
---
Frustration is a pretty strong feeling for a casual card game. Just wondering why since discover was created all we get is the abusing of the mechanic and the loops it generates.
---
I don't really get why after frigthened got "nerfed" we are still getting the same thing.
---
I don't understand why also play shaman what's the point winning? I rather not play so they see how shitty their card design is. if people just play no matter what nothing is going to change and next xpac they gonna do the same and we have another supercancerspaceaids in the game
---
Nice. You got a deck list?
---
I'm an idiot, nevermind.
---
Just slap a Northshire Cleric turn one on the board. Add a few Powerword shields and divine spirits and finish it off with Inner Fire. Isnt that the way of the Priest since forever? Really a pity.
---
No, guys!!
---
He was talking about Mogu Fleshshaper...
---
Aww bloody heck man I was being satirical. You're already a laughing stock you don't have to commit more to it.
---
Never blame the QA. Most bugs are known, it‚Äôs just that developers are never given enough time to fix them. aka ‚Äúknown shippable‚Äù
---
HEEEYYAAAAAAHHHH
---
Wild is neglected, devs hardly care and the meta is horrible, allowing truly broken stuff to remain for months.
---
Oh wait that's standard too the last months üåö Pick your poison I guess, it's a few good moons since developers cared about this game except milking the sunken cost fallacy out of already addicted players.
---
okay but you're cute as hell üòç
---
As with the Imps it works for Zombeasts.
---
This assumes you spent all your dust already, which already is pretty risky if you didn't build the obvious best deck.
---
Me too thanks
---
Downvoted for not shitting on Shaman.
---
Haven‚Äôt played in almost two years. How powercrept has the game become that someone is able to say their weakest 3 drop is animal companion?
---
I think the joke isn't that you shouldn't hate the shaman deck. It's that a huge chunk of this sub who complains about shaman is also playing shaman.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk outjerked again
---
Mogu plays in a most of Shaman decks: Murlock, Galakrond, etc.
---
You should be satiafied.
---
Inciting a riot was not my intention lol
---
Lol I keep forgetting that card is still in standard.
---
Sorry that happened
---
Great addition to my post, very enlightening comment. I would literally bombard you with platinum and gold if i had any.
---
Hogger has 4 of the letters too!!! its an obvious reference to the N word
---
Some people think if Galakrond's power was discover instead of random, Priest would suddenly be good. They are the kind of people that have zero idea how hearthstone works.
---
Priest is the only class that doesn't get rush minions. Since Blizzard is giving every single minion rush, Priest is being left behind.
---
Whizbang.  He is needed now more than ever.
---
I can't even open the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app main window. Like, it loads and the system tray icon shows up, but i cannot open the main [battle.net](https://battle.net) window at all lol, and when i right click the tray icon to load a game from the popup menu it either opens the game and fails during the connect part, or it doesnt even register my click at all.
---
After shaman nerfs, it does have a chance. With pyromancer it can sort of take care of zoolock and pirate warrior, maybe teching some more boardclears (their dragon breath comes to mind) and it could come back at least as a tier 2.
---
Some people are in that situation so I don‚Äôt see how that makes what I said wrong. Even if they built the best deck, it doesn‚Äôt change that fact they‚Äôre unable to switch to wild at that moment. How is it so hard to believe that some people are not in a position to switch to a wild at any given moment?
---
If they changed the hero power to add the 2/1 rush to their hand think it would be much more balanced.
---
Though shit? Again, you're allowed to experiment and people are allowed to play competitive decks. Even if we didn't have the BS that is Shaman right now it would've been something else.
---
Plus, if all you want is to experiment why do you even care if you win or lose? Or are others just supposed to let you also win with your meme deck?
---
Murlocks are nerfed Pog
---
The priest deck is ass since it has no card draw and you cant reliably draw your answers to shaman. Control warrior is a much better option.
---
Yeah, a lot of people want to try the best deck it seems. I suppose if you can't beat em, a lot of people think "join em". If people wanna play that deck, fine, just play what you think is fun, and if winning is fun, then maybe we shouldn't be surprised that the top winrate deck is the most popular.
---
Personally I've been having a blast with Waxadred Rogue and Dragon Reborn Paladin. I'll admit I tried to do the infinite shudderwock thing, but ended up losing my first game and not attempting it again.

Fuck Priest. It's the most annoying class to play against when it's powerful.
---
Copying your cards, stealing your minions, resurrecting big minions, doing the same old inner fire combo
---
Motherfucker I've played more in Wild than 99% of this sub. Wild isn't this mythical place where every deck is filled with legendaries. Some of the best decks in the format have always been quite cheap.
---
GreasyPoncho#1235 Trading 80g, I show you go first.
---
EU
---
I have the same problem.
---
Probably is meta knowledge.
---
Having a tier 1 deck and knowing how to play hearthstone is not 
---
 enough, you also need to know the MATCHUPS. Shaman galakroind can get you far, if you know what you need to mulligan in what matchups. So even if you play a good deck and can see all their lines of play, you need to know what other decks exist in the meta and how to counter them (how to play galakrond mirrors, how to play against pirate warrior, etc...).
---
Arena changes every 2 months or so, with the sets they include, so the arena meta might change, good classes change and you are getting a bit lower average due to not knowing that. Again, you may be a great player, but you just need to familiarize with the current state of the game to improve and get back on the spot where you left.
---
Its like, maybe you are very good at many cardgames, and you decide to try a new one. You will surely be better than the average noob since you carry some knowledge of previous CCGs, but that doesnt make you the top tier player you are in the other games. You still need a ton of time to reach that spot, but still less than the average player.
---
Not the bugs. How overpowered the deck is. Also, simple fix is just to delete galakrond temporarily.
---
QA isn‚Äôt the balance team.
---
If playing against aggro just play him as a 3/2 on an empty board to not gimp your draws. If playing a value matchup on Togwaggle or Kronx. Also if you are very unlucky with your draws and you draw both Mechanical Dragonlings before the Apothecary you can play it on one of the Dragonlings to combo your Apothecarys.
---
8 face damage vs 5 face damage
---
Authentication servers are down.
---
There is no way to ‚Äúabuse‚Äù this mechanic.  It is random luck, and the chance of getting amazing value is very low.
---
How did Frightened Flunky get nerfed?
---
All they did was to HOF Mind Blast because of "class identity".
---
The only problem is that devs never enforced that for other classes.
---
Yh but if you use the double battlecry you get 4 8/8 that‚Äôs still scary
---
Or else we will stop playing Hearthstone1!!
---
I'm gonna go ahead and call you out on that. 9 times out of 10 the wild deck will be much more expensive.
---
Take highlander mage for example. Your legendaries in standard are new reno, new alex, old alex, and zephrys.
---
In wild, you need new reno, zephrys, brann (if you didnt buy expansion), kazakus, old reno, thaurissan (again if you didnt buy xpac), Frost Lich Jaina, Bloodmage Thalnos, possibly lich king, possibly new alex, possibly old alex, possibly Zola.
---
Why wouldn't any deck require more dust? Wild is supposed to be better versions of every deck, right? Why wouldn't it make sense that they would run more legendaries available in wild, except for the fact that they dont have the dust?
---
What is the combo?
---
Against what decks is this combo strong? Against what decks is this weak?
---
Can warrior (or other class) achieve a  similar combo with similar strenghts and weaknesses, but in an easier way/more consistent way?
---
Sorry for all this questions but I know nothing about the deck and I dont get still what is the strenght of this deck compared to a normal control warrior. I need to know more or less where the idea is to suggest replacements to help you reach a better deck that can pull off this combo.
---
8 face damage tho. That's 8 damage.
---
Quality Assurance dude. Not only bug testers. They are meant to assure quality. In this case, the final product (expansion), not having unbalanced cards inside it (Shaman Galakrond) that reduce quality of play.
---
Maybe I'm just overly competitive, but I don't think those people have a deck to play standard either in that situation. I've played since the open beta so I understand that I have gotten the staples just over time, but one can take a standard deck to wild and slowly upgrade it to a higher tier wild deck.
---
only viable decks are shaman galakrond decks
---
Take your pick:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/364989394395987968/655077068463144960/day3DoD.png
---
There's multiple decks over there that are under 6k dust and are plenty competitive if not tier 1. 
---
And dusting your Wild cards was always a stupid idea just like wasting said dust crafting random shit was. What exactly did you do with all that dust? You presumably play since release(tho I call BS on that) yet I've been playing since LoE and can still play both formats.
---
So yeah, obviously if you throw your dust and cards away your options are limited, big fucking surprise. How's that short term dust bonus working for you?
---
No no...finish the scene.
---
What cards do i need to craft
---
Maybe they need to change the cards they are giving. I hate playing big priest too, divine spirit is now a necesity. No one likes playi g it , not even the priest.
---
Nice!  I gave up on Hunter Dragon from losing to Shaman, but putting in a more aggressive beast package seems exactly what my deck was missing.  
---
What do you think of Scalerider as a 4-drop budget of your legendary 4-drops?  It was an all-star in my full dragon version, often having 6-8 attack. But this list runs less dragons so maybe it will be 2-4 attack too often.
---
Also, I‚Äôm surprised about the fire-tree inclusion.   I cut that card because I was often getting discovers with nothing I really wanted.  Do you think it‚Äôs important for the deck?
---
Yeah, there aren't that many dragons in the pool, so it's probably more likely than some other chance happenings, in fact I'm pretty sure I got alex from alex once, so yeah. Still that's crazy, 4 times? I did some quick math, even if it's a 1/17 chance its still like 1 in a 1000 chance, that's actually crazy. 
---
I'm surprised my comment score was this low from just a reaction comment lol. All aboard the downvote train I guess. People on the internet are weird.
---
If you‚Äôre a hunter against a shaman and the shaman double battle cries and you drop bran he has 4 8/8 with rush and you only have 1 8/8 with charge. Not that big.
---
you can't run away from nerf
---
iPhone 6s. Same.
---
Since you have the hs-replay premium, could you do me a favor and look for the matchup winrates of the Galakront Shaman?
---
Since almost all of the Shaman Decks have like &lt; 60% winrate while they most of the time just play each other, the winrate against the other classes must be even higher, right?
---
It needs to preserve the soul of the card. And the main idea of the card is not about rushing or charging, but about having an effect related to the number of minions in play. Therefore, a more appropiate nerf could be:
---
7 mana 3/4: Cost (1) cristal *more* for each minion in the battlefield.
---
moonbore#1486 on NA - I show, you go first.
---
for me it's ''how about a new wife''
---
Yup. I use freeze mage and reno dragon mage. You have to get really lucky to win. Its basically just hoping they play their big cards when you have the removal for them. It sucks. I usually get down to about rank 4 every season, but I cant push past 9.
---
same for me,tried restarting pc mumtiple times,running bnet as admin,closing evything in taskmanager. Nothing works
---
Yea bro this is literally worse than shamans

hahaha i can't wait for the nerfs!

1. Lazul is just bad.

2. You can't really use the Dragon synergy consistently and I wouldn't add more Dragons, but rather just cut it (aside from Breath as we'll gladly run Volcanic Potion). If you really want to force it, get Dragonmaw Scorcher or Evasive Wyrm.
---
3. Faceless Corruptor is an insane card, but you don't have the activators.
---
I don't know. It's gonna take some time before Priest gets figured out. At least wait until nerfs.
---
Same with a lot of other keywords
---
Same!
---
EU down?
---
I think you mean [[Rabid worgen]], not [[Raging worgen]]
---
Yes basic cards aren't as powerful as they used to be, but at least they're still seeing play.
---
"Lol play this one other deck that beats shaman, you lazy ass"
---
You don't see the problem with that statement? At all?
---
They lowered considerably the possibility of discovering himself. If team 5 moves a finger to do something that does not increases their preorder sales is because it's obnoxious lol.
---
That's why i wonder why they don't change discover altogether and reduce unneeded variance? I mean you said it's so unlikely that is meaningless to Even exist.

3/3/3 | Has +1 Attack and Windfury while damaged.  
---
Yes
---
While there hasnt been a statement on this specific one there was one similar where you can skip your opponents turn with two radiant elementals and repeatingly play shadow visions this would cause the opponent to be stuck and have their turn skipped, toast tested this and showed this on stream which resulted in a tempt ban
---
Just because there are ridiculously expensive wild decks doesn't mean all of them are. Secret mage only has 2 legendaries  and one epic. It's a total of about 5k dust for a tier 1 deck. Bit more that the cheapest budget decks but way less than most standard decks.
---
I dont think amalgam is the problem, and niether is poison, however gentle megasaur giving poison/divine shield  to to your whole board is an issue. If it was only toxfin, I feel like itd be more balanced (or maybe if poison was removed from gentle megasaurs adapts or something)
---
That would be a buff. I'd rather have a 5/4 Rush than a vanilla 6/6.
---
Good call, Brann‚Äôs summoned minion is definitely getting nerfed to lose Charge.
---
Yh I‚Äôm still a bit sad :(
---
Yeah problem is i have most of those cards since they were printed, and some if cards i put in my reno are like 4 years old.  I didnt have to craft them again they are here forever.  And forever will be free good pick
---
Wait, is this real!?
---
Now it‚Äôs working again
---
He got banned for spreading it, not for playing it.
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone‚Äôs so obsessed with pirate warrior just because it oppressed before that by no means means it‚Äôs still good
---
For showcasing it, not for playing it.
---
But what if just kill the shaman?
---
There always will be a dominent class. I love playing shaman since they added Shudderwock and you know what? I DON'T FEEL BAD. I will play whatever i want and not what people on reddit will tell me to play so stop complaining about people having fun
---
Love the hanging picture changed to Ben Brode!  Nice touch!
---
But you likely can‚Äôt as galakrond gives 5 armour too.
---
Okay so if someone‚Äôs is 2400 dust short of one of those decks what are supposed to do? Take for example the shaman deck which has genn and epics. 
---
Any deck that has a wild legendary I wouldn‚Äôt be able to make. This is also applies to new players who decided to start playing standard and would not have any of the wild legendaries or epics. 
---
No ones saying it‚Äôs impossible. Just that some people cannot do it at this moment in time. 
---
Dusting my wild cards was not a stupid decision because it meant I didn‚Äôt have to spend money on packs in order to craft all the decks I‚Äôve managed to craft. 
---
I also don‚Äôt really care if you believe me or not. I don‚Äôt gain anything from convincing you. 
---
This short term bonus has worked pretty well for me considering I haven‚Äôt put money on the game for nearly 3 years now so thanks for asking. 
---
Don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so hostile over the internet but hope you‚Äôre attitude gets better
---
That‚Äôs what the 8 damage is for
---
You know what you‚Äôre right.
---
I would hold off on making a deck, as the meta is about to shift abit when Shamans get nerfed next week. I dont personally know which youtuber id recommend in terms of learning the game in general, but if you find a deck you like, you can find many streamers in general. Concepts I wish i understood sooner when I started was, Card advantage, tempo, and the general signs of what makes a card good/bad.
---
After the league defeats them do you think they will be able to control Galakrond? Or maybe we will find some treasures to better fight against Galakrond? Because we still unlock cards for standard in the adventure right?
---
 EU Hawk#2287 - Trading 80g, i'll show first but please go first. Thanks
---
Any luck?
---
Standart with only Priest &lt;3
---
It would be finally viable
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
Time to go outside!
---
Toast has been coming back since Battlegrounds and he's also started playing DoD.
---
[He has a separate youtube channel for Hearthstone content now.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfl_9KvN0Mjre_JmSDmbBlA/videos)
---
Strictly speaking, exploiting bugs is against code of conduct, but Blizzard rarely bans and if they do it's for much worse offences. There have been plenty of Nozdormu skips in the past and as far as I'm aware nobody has gotten banned for it. Toast had a short ban for showcasing another exploit, but not for playing it.
---
&gt;Why wouldn't any deck require more dust? Wild is supposed to be better versions of every deck, right? Why wouldn't it make sense that they would run more legendaries available in wild, except for the fact that they dont have the dust?
---
Because you still only have 30 cards in a deck and most of the times you'd rather put useful rares and commons instead of more flashy legendaries that don't help you in any way. There's top tier decks in Wild that are sub 6k dust
---

---
And I love how you omited the fact that Std Highlander Mage also runs stuff like Ziliax, Kalecgos, Thalnos, Siamat, sometimes Pocket Galaxy and a ton of other niche epics.
---
Omg, finally someone noticed :D 
---
I tried to be sneaky about it though!
---
And Divine Spirit will almost certainly be hall of famed during the next rotation.
---
Turn 1: invocation of frost
---
Turn 2: doesnt matter
---
Turn 3: doesnt matter
---
Turn 4: devoted maniac
---
Turn 5: corrupted elementalist
---
Turn 6: dragons pact
---
Turn 7: galakrond
---
Result? Legend
---
You mean the new warsong? And yes, it's a reference to the heavy nerf warsong experienced
---
If they play by OG Adventures, I would hope so. Let's not keep our fingers crossed though, it's likely to be another Dungeon Run.
---
Won't the game end in draw on turn 50?
---
Same, EU region, it says cant find the blizzard account and that scares me
---
First off, Hi, I agree with you. Just wanted to add to your point.
---
There have been *some* metas where if the most recent set is strong enough, standard decks could be highly competitive in wild. This is due to the number of people in standard refining decks that make use of the latest high power level cards. The best standard decks are more refined then the best wild decks.
---
I don‚Äôt have a cutlass yet, but I do have 2 Stowaways that I put in. Thank you for the advice.
---
They have PART of HS covered, if Omni has wild vs data then ill switch for sure.
---
Don't dust your cards. You'll regret it. Just pay for the next card bundle deal the give out and build from there. Eventually you'll want to go back. Playing both is where its at.
---
So your telling me to get my hopes up? Gotcha! I'm excited! My hopes are up!
---
I found that I feel worse when I realized I don‚Äôt have enough money/dust for the new shaman deck than I feel when I play against a shaman
---
alright I'll start with those, thanks man.
---
How is dusting your wild cards just as stupid as crafting random shit is lmao? Is this how *all* Wild players think? In that case I‚Äôd rather not even try it then...
---
Instead of trying to get people to try Wild, why don‚Äôt you try Standard for a couple weeks and see why we decided to DE our wild cards in the first place
---
Priest's winrate is bad cause everyone is trying to make shitty decks work. If they just played divine spirit inner fire priest, the winrate would be fine. I'm not saying that's necessarily an okay situation but the winrate is a bit deceiving.
---
This exactly, they want priest to get into the combo bandwaggon, but it want to be fair so no card draw, healing or over 30 damage... Priest players want to play control, the ones playing inner fire play it because it is the only option, not a good option.
---
Not anymore.
---
&gt;Okay so if someone‚Äôs is 2400 dust short of one of those decks what are supposed to do? Take for example the shaman deck which has genn and epics.
---
The same thing they'd do in Standard? Get dust and craft them if they want. And BTW the Epics aren't even necessary in Even Shaman.
---
&gt;Dusting my wild cards was not a stupid decision because it meant I didn‚Äôt have to spend money on packs in order to craft all the decks I‚Äôve managed to craft.
---
Except I didn't dust them and still managed fine without paying. You just probably suck at dust management.
---
&gt;This short term bonus has worked pretty well for me considering I haven‚Äôt put money on the game for nearly 3 years now so thanks for asking.
---
Doesn't seem like it considering you're saying you don't have enough dust now. Meanwhile I'm still hoarding a few k dust waiting for the meta to settle and nerfs to get announced.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre so hostile over the internet but hope you‚Äôre attitude gets better
---
Ah the good ol' "Why you mad bro" defence. 
---
1. I'm not mad. You just assumed that based on basically nothing
---
2. I'm just tired of geniuses like you claiming dusting a crapton of your cards for 1/4 the value is a good idea then turning around and bitching how Wild is expensive(it isn't) and how they don't have the choice to play half of the available Constructed game modes
---
Mindflayer and Murozond would be absolutely ridiculous with those changes. You do not want cards like that around, or you're getting another Secret Agent Coming Through situation.
---
I had a bad combination of quests today: play some minions for 50 gold (after reroll), and event quest to play for 50 turns. I didn't want to finish that 50 gold quest, so i made spell hunter (or what i had in my collection that looked like one) and went to wild.
---
I played 7 matches in wild. I got crushed 3 times by pirate warrior, 3 times by Galkarond Shaman (all six of those matches ended on turn 8-10), and last match i played against Highlander Glakarond Priest. It was a long match, where i managed to last until fatigue, and finish that quest. 
---
But, how is this any different than Standard? Or i should climb higher to face anything but Standard decks?
---
Ups just read it my bad
---
What's the problem with Shudderwock? It's an expensive payoff card that creates a big board. Strong, but hardly the issue with Shaman. The only fix it needs is to shorten those Invoke animations. We really don't need to see a Galakrond getting maxed ten times over.
---
I'm really surprised to see all the nagging on Murozond in this thread. It's just straight up a strong card, even in non-combo decks. Priest needs different base cards or buffs on identity cards, not buffs on already great cards.
---
"Take Highlander Mage" I mean shit, you really couldn't pick a more expensive one? There are plenty of Wild decks that are far cheaper than that, and cherry picking a Highlander Deck of all things is asinine. Of course those are expensive, but let's not pretend you need 10 legendaries in your deck to make a good one.
---
fwiw i've been doing well with reno mage but feel the same way that it needs good random outcomes and it's still really close every time
---
Hall of fame Shudder would be nice to see
---
&gt;How is dusting your wild cards just as stupid as crafting random shit is lmao? Is this how all Wild players think? In that case I‚Äôd rather not even try it then...
---
Nice reading comprehension you got there...I said they were both stupid things to do, not that they are equally stupid.
---
&gt;Instead of trying to get people to try Wild, why don‚Äôt you try Standard for a couple weeks and see why we decided to DE our wild cards in the first place
---
I'm playing both formats, genius. This isn't either or. Well at least it isn't if you aren't one of the brilliant people who dusted all their past cards for 1/4 the value. And before you claim anything, no, I didn't buy any packs with money. I just know how to actually manage my dust.
---
Galashaman is literally the quest deck playing a galakrond package instead of the evolve package and hasn't changed since day 1
---
Sounds like you shouldn't have dusted
---
Plate breaker would like a word
---
I would prefer when they generate free cards they can't generate themselves
---
The Murozond suggestion is really bad, because it's already more than good enough. Adding Battlecries is insane because you straight up take cards that took a long time to set up (Galakronds, C'Thuns, Tess, Shudderwock, etc.). That's not fun, that's just 8/8 on top of winning the game. "Situationally broken" is still broken.
---
Exactly, just because you manage your dust well, doesn‚Äôt mean everyone does as well. It‚Äôs unfair of you to assume that just because you can afford the dust required to play in both Standard and Wild, everyone else can too
---
corruptorCD
---
Honestly I think Blizz going to nerf elementals to 1/1s with Rush, maybe nerf Dragon's Pack to 6 mana and make  faceless corruptor unplayable
---
Divine Spirit should be. That‚Äôll let them release more high health minions for the class, which feels like it should be core to the class identity without every one being an OTK candidate.
---
Thanks for that answer! Really helped me decide whether to try it or not!
---
They way I justify the Nozdormu play: I could easily play the malygos variant and oneshot the enemy for 100% success in the same turn as I played it. Nozdormu is just a more unreliable meme variant which basically hopes for strong enough pulls of Ysera to finish the enemy off the next round. Thx and hf!
---
Alright well this is going nowhere. You‚Äôre a F2P Wall Street level financial economist when it comes to dust management evidently and I‚Äôm clearly inferior. Enjoy your Victory of the internet. Win 2 more times today to collect 10g üëçüèø
---
i believe so but idk
---
f2pbtw
---
Great ideas.  I‚Äôve always wondered how Blizzard could incentivize playing a variety of decks/cards.
---
Maybe even implement a new game mode that rotates card pools you can make decks from.  Like they did with arena but quicker turnaround like every month.
---
I mean, though shit? Are people who waste their dust supposed to be sympathised with now? If you craft random shit and waste dust why would you expect to be able to play multiple decks or formats? There's nothing unfair about it.
---
I actually think Divine Spirit is the bigger problem. But either way, one of them should go. Inner Spirit let‚Äôs high health minions to become board threats. Divine Spirit opens up OTKs, which just feel bad.
---
What rank are you currently?
---
I tried this deck, ia really fun.
---
It's not taking advantage of it, more like taking disadvantage of it tbh. You can always play the easier to set up and 100% otk version with malygos. Nozdormu variant is just a weaker meme one.
---
Murozond more than good ...not sure about that sir
---
Yea tell us something we don‚Äôt know already. Now go play your game
---
QA it's still not the balance tram. They can say X card is powerful or underpowered but isn't on them to change it to what.
---
13, pretty sad i can't win on such a low rank
---
Sorry, I'm a lawyer and that's how we write in my country.
---
2 5/4s
---
Yes, it totally is!
---
Warsong pog
---
You guys feeding off each other is so badass rn.   Keep up the good work fam
---
haha its really tough playing against shaman this meta,good luck man!
---
b o t t o m t e x t
---
At that point you done hecked up. Maybe in the future only craft one deck for the new meta and try to create your own cool deck from the packs you opened. That's what i usually do until the meta settles.
---
Spicy shitpost!
---
TrixMTL? Trixie Mattel?
---
that would be ok but rush galakrond stuff has priority nerf
---
Yes, it would because losing 3/4 of the value of your cards is never worth it. Disenchant whatever cards you know are useless or just pack filers and keep the ones that are decent, just like with Standard. And Wild will always be way cheaper in the long run.
---
What about the other expansions? What other legendaries do you have?
---
no problem man,good luck!
---
Ahhh wow that went over my head lol
---
incoming "blizz pls stupid 1 dust reward, can't buy anything"
---
Priest and Palladins are really the 2classes where blizz needs to choose a theme and stick with that for most of cards for atleast a few expansions. New archetypes/ideas is good,but shouldn be 5 differentt/new archetypes evry expansion either and then not focus on any of old ones(what likly will happen with no neutral cards)
---
Pirate Warrior - it‚Äôs like they finally made a MTG red deck in HS. Super fun to play.
---
What of instead Priest Galakrond's Battlecry killing minions, it Mind Controlled them instead?
---
These aren't even comparable
---
It's a joke
---
He‚Äôs saying the people complaining are also the people playing the deck not that it isn‚Äôt a problem
---
only class they enforce class identity on at all really is rogue and their lack of healing,aoe or taunts or just damage mitigation of any kind.
---
rest is basicly whatever
---
Yeah, I do it in standard with every expansion I'm done opening packs for too. It's super stupid to dust ALL wild cards, even the ones that are obviously good. Even if it's only for tavern brawls some cards are too good to dust.
---
My mistake for misunderstanding adventure vs expansion. Thank you for explaining.
---
My point remains that your attitude is damaging to the game. It's bad if Blizzard just releases terrible cards for one class with the idea that a future release will fix it. We, as players, expect that Blizzard is doing their best to keep the game balanced. Blizzard holds up their end of the bargain by trying their best to keep the game balanced.
---
I'll never join the dark side!
---
this has been one of the most embarassing threads ive read on this board. Thank god I dont know anyone as mentally ill as you in real life OP.
---
a man of honor.
---
Diversity and power level are the keywords you are missing. It's not so much of an issue when there are multiple strong decks that make up a diverse meta than just one that is decimating everything. *How much* stronger is also a question, losing closely is something else than being decimated completely. 
---
People don't want to play "meme" decks, they want to play *different* decks that might be still viable but not top of the meta. That doesn't mean they want to lose every game against the same deck. It also doesn't mean others are supposed to "let" them win, again, not everything is black and white. You have a very narrow way of thinking. Either it's shaman or something else, either you play comp or meme, that's not the only thing that exists.
---
If you had infinite amounts of dust, how would you improve upon this deck? I was unlucky(?) was enough to unpack 2 copies of Toxic Reinforcements on day 1 and I‚Äôd love to take this deck out for a spin, but I just wanna know some improvements I could make to it if possible. Much thanks!
---
Goes to show how much worse the quest variant is, yet people still play it
---
yes, try it vs shaman right now and you will get horribly beaten up.
---
I dont think you wrote enough to say how bad Envoy of Lazuul is. It is so insanely bad. Not only is it stupidly difficult to guess what there is in hand, but even if you could get it right every single time, then it would stillnbe a horrible card because it is just a 2/2 body on mind vision for an extra mana? Mind vision is already not played because a random card from the opponent is rarely worth it the deck slot... And as the source card gets more expensivene it gets even harder to play the stolen card. With how bad the effect is, the body at 3/4 probably wouldnt be played. If the card stole randomly like mind vision, it would probably be played as a 2/4. The only way then current iteration would ever see play was if you also got some discount on the stolen card...2 mana at the very least, and then it would only be used to steal choice cards when opponents hand size was pretty closely known ie tournaments.
---
There should have been shudderwock in the end, as the final nail in the coffin.
---
owww so that must be what the priest was playing i faced earlier and why he seanced his own thalnos.
---
hey jaina, i know we couldnt skype tonight, but thats alright. good game girl, ill see ya on ladder

Agreed, ive been playing dragon Galakrond Priest and whilst it does work sometimes and is a lot of fun to play generally, it needs SO much improvement, I really hope Priest gets buffs soon
---
I actually thinking about crafting that!Is it good against shaman?
---
I think it would be too OP tbh.
---
No, my gamertag is way older than that. Its short for trixster and mtl for montreal
---
Point is there will always be stronger competitive decks and the matchmaking algorithm at the least tries to not match you up with the same class/deck. There's nothing stopping you from experimenting either way. But don't expect all your different decks to be competitive.
---
Good meme
---
how about ? same effect but, can't be targeted by YOUR  spells!
---
shadowform/shadowform is what ive been wanting for ages for priest but they never get anything basicly and shadowform was in need of a buff even in classic :/.
---
and without mad scientist type cards or start of game to buff/pull out(or cards that get buffed by having shadowform) will aslo always be worse then anduin. why deal 3dmg and spend multiple cards and do nothing on board when can deal 2 that refreshes and have a board clear ontop.
---
How do you want to do it? There are a lot of f2p players that only have one viable meta deck. Do you know how bad it would feel if your one good deck would get banned and you had to play with an all common/rare cards deck because you barely had enough dust to get one good deck?
---
The quest is 3 times worth more than regular ones? How are you complaining about 200 gold everyday, and a normal quest on top of that?
---
thats exactly what i am saying yes
---
Good one
---
The point is that no priest player really likes combo priest so saying that combo priest was Tier 1 doesn't really make Priest players any happier. If we gave Priests a card that said "Battlecry: Win the game" that would be strong but it won't make Priest a fun class nor be fulfilling to priest players.
---
We can make any class stupidly competitive but if it's not any fun either to the class or its opponents then what's the point?
---
The way i see this bug with the grey message to√º right is, that your local cash somehow gets corrupted and doesnt line up with server data. Hence why deleting all these temporary cash golders fixes the issue because HS creates them anew. What causes that disconnect when going into the collection i really dont knoe
---
I'm pretty sure you're just experiencing positive variance. [The stats suggest it's not a good match up.](https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/346/galakrond-shaman#tab=matchups) It loses close to 60% of the time.
---
Indo agree with you on the decks that have little interaction(insert my most hated deck of the past freeze mage) I've found Galakrond Shaman not to be one of those, a lot of it is about board control, and I honestly haven't come across that many, my games have been pretty varied.
---
Hunter is a hunter, even in a dream!
---
I've actually got a lot more than that, but I digress. 
---
It's so I can afford to have several higher tier decks from different classes in the beginning of expansions. Basically, I dust any legendary, epic, rare cards that'd be available for other classes to craft more useful ones that'd make a high tier deck without putting in a crap load of time into grinding ladder for 100 gold a day. (I'm very casual and maybe play a handful of hours a week.) Using this method I've accumulated a crap ton of high tier decks without spending a dime, and the only thing it costs me to access them is logging into another account.
---
I run a similar style with Leeroy, I find that Leeroy+unleash helps me finish out games I otherwise wouldn't have been able to. However, I am still kicking around at mid level ranks. I'll give this deck a shot, I'm glad for the return of face hunter
---
Did you ever see LifeCoach play before he quit Hearthstone? It‚Äôs a very bad idea to ban people based on them roping. It‚Äôs annoying behavior, but good luck proving someone else‚Äôs intent.
---
Warcraft lore is really something. Since I don't play WoW I really wish they would use expansions to explain the lore in part.
---
As a ftp player whose 2 legendaries this expansion were the two priest ones, I am a sad boy.
---
It is already a warrior card
---
Hype train. Go go go
---
Because pirate rogue rampaged in wild with Kingsbane. It was my favorite deck, killing big priests within 7 turns even with their 4 mana heal 12 spell
---
Been trying this out in casual but haven't won a single game yet. Lost to pirate warriors, tempo rogues, galakrond shamans, even a meme-y silence priest. Seems like the minions don't have enough health to build a sticky board, and there's no spells to try to swing things back.
---
I likethe look of this, well made. :)I still think I prefer Quest Hunter though. In part because I didn't open Dragonsbane, but it also just seems fun in general.
---
Hakkars blood is also but with the meta now I doubt you will see anyone playing it
---
Have you played G-Priest? You never play it for 4,you play it for 2 because the tempo loss ia beyond obvious and you usually cant afford to play 4 invokes.
---
Regailia#1250 NA trading 80g quest.
---
I know. I also loved the deck, but nerfing raiding party to 4 mana should be enough to balance it. 
---
I also remeber when leeching poison was a thing and rogue could more or less use a control archetype... all gone.
---
They have stated that they are looking into it
---
Brann has always been terrible, then again the only way Blizzard has ever known how to make hunter legendaries is to give them high mana costs and a battlecry.
---
Also add the Troll champions from Rumble run,and the heroes from Monster hunt,they all got ervy emote except mirror emote one but compared to whole new (or even multiple) that isnt to much. 
---
And all are just ready to be used ,sitting there doing nothing :/
---
They explained most of those in interviews, but not at the same I think.
---
Nobody is saying that the meta isn't broken right now. Only that people playing meta decks doesn't put you in some sort of moral highground for choosing to play off meta ones.
---
A lot of people play to win and that's fine. The ladder is meant to be competitive.
---
Bonemare was a 7 mana 9/9, 4/4 of which had charge... and it got nerfed. this is a 9/7 where both parts have rush. Not sure why they thought this should cost 3 less than bonemare

Mostly druids for me.
---
Ruined for you maybe. Day 1 i had a ton of fun with my home brew warrior from rank 14-4 then ran into trouble with shaman piloted by good players so i joined the dark side and now I‚Äôm legend. One of the most productive week 1s of any xpac for me.

13 gold for a single quest? Boy it's been a long, long time since I've played that game.
---
&gt;remove the divine spirit combo
---
Exactly. It's unbelievable they didn't Hall Of Fame those yet.
---
How do I clear the cache for Hearthstone?
---
I‚Äôm playing discount non-pirate galakrond warrior, which sure is a mouthful.
---
Boar TK deck is the only acceptable answer
---
I'm just a regular everyday normal motherfucker
---
Yup.
---
And how did the bot scan that?
---
wait, I thought Inner Fire Priest was still a good deck? has it fallen off completely?
---
Pinkman#2333 EU 80g quest trade. I show, then you go first.
---
still searching...
---
ASCHIMILATE OR DIE
---
I explained it in the post, it doesn't the best luck I had with this deck was actually a Zetalot "tempo oriented Dragon package with lot's of neutals" and it was hyper underwhelming to be frank. Still Zetalot knew better.

You're right, but my poinst stands that Hagatha didn't make Shaman get bad spells for 2 years, if anything it got really awesome spells to randomly get.
---
"We need this problem to solve this problem"
---
that deck is so degenerate. big thumbs up to those players on the easy win and emote spam the whole game.
---
Evolve shouldn't exist. That card should be removed and OPs nerf should still happen. Even without evolve mogu is too good.
---
Even shaman. A very strong deck that only needs 1 legendary (Genn) to work well.
---
Jade druid is another option, since it also only needs one legendary: Malfurion‚Äôs DK.
---
If you have Baku,Patches and Leeroy, odd rogue is recommended. In my opinion is the best wild deck at the moment.
---
Finally, secret mage - another top tier 1 deck - only needs Aluneth as a legendary.
---
Secret mage is all you need
---
&gt; They gravitate to these decks because they don‚Äôt want their time wasted with decks that might win.
---
This is an important factor. I would add that the financial burden of experimental deckbuilding also drives this pattern of behavior. A typical player simply doesn't have the resources to craft the niche epics and legendaries needed to experiment with a large number of different archetypes.
---
Thanks, though it's not hard to see how incredibly busted that card design is
---
Just today I was playing shudderwock and got golden bran while playing murlocs. Had a bunch of angry, 60 health divide shield, windfury, deathrattle, poisonous froggy boys. Completely fair and balanced.
---
I would definitely keep. It‚Äôs a good classic card, so it‚Äôs utility will last forever. Unfortunately, however, it‚Äôs not a card that is strictly necessary in a deck.
---
Lots of the cards people are calling underpowered here are actually *really* good.  Priest actually got some brilliant cards, they just don't fit to make a cohesive deck.
---
Envoy of Lazul, however, is the worst card in the whole DoD set.
---
I wont say anything is wrong for this deck. I understand why people think leeroy is a good thing for this style of deck.
---
Personally i think hes not needed, but not to a point to make a fit about it.
---
If leeroy is easier for you to use and works with the shell, by all means go for it friend hehe, im happy you enjoy the shell.
---
That being said, the deck isnt as straight forward to pilot as it seems, and leeroy is a 5 mana fireball not necessary, but still not unplayable
---
I feel like it should be but blizzard likes making effortless money so fuck wild
---
I just don't understand why it also works with your opponent's minions, it seems like a really obvious choice to make it only lower the cost based on your own board. I feel like a card that rewards you for having a big board incentivizes the opponent to keep your minion count as low as possible, i.e. it has some fair form of counter play. Bloodlust is basically the same in that way. But the fact that it also works off of your opponent's minions, means it also punishes the opponent for getting ahead, or building a board of their own at all for that matter. If the only thing your opponent can do to "counter" your card is not play minions of their own, that's a pretty unfair card in a game entirely centered around playing minions.
---
Tl,dr Mogu Fleshshaper isn't *just* a catch-up card for when you are behind, or a win-more card if you are ahead...it's both. It's a bit too good in too many scenarios.
---
Except you never draft anything above 5 mana after you pick it.
---
Oh okay because a youtuber that goes by the name of The Penniless Player was mentioning this card with another card as a combo or something and I didn't quite understand how. It was really confusing.
---
Then you run [[Wyrmrest Purifier]] as a tech card  for extra meme potential
---

2/3/2 | Battlecry: Transform all Neutral cards in your deck into random cards from your class.  
---
I think i get your point, but they don't make this cases for Priest, they don't complete decks in later expansion with before seen legendaries, check them out, none of them work as Legendaries make decks better, they don't make decks and they try to make decks with our legendaries like Lady in White and both Zereks and Bwomsandi, Madame Lazul, Chameleos, Activate the obelisk didn't get a single fucking card to help this expansion. The only exceptions might be Muerte and Talanji and I would argue, without a way to make the deck work without them, the decks don't work, even with them.
---
See Priest legendaries, we always get meme legendaries all over the place that should work in some deck, but are never nurtered to usefulness by Team 5, even Velens, the most powerful effect in the game, even better than Malygos is a joke in a class that lacks damaging spells, we literally have the most powerful legendary in the game, but it only works as a War Golem as it doesn't have any meaningful use in any deck besides a mediocre, vanilla beatstick.
---
You can't look at winrates of classes this early in an expansion when people are experimenting so much.. Look instead at deck winrates.
---
loads of hunter decks with 1000's of games are well above 50%, several versions of pirate warrior are only 3% below shaman, several versions of galakrond warrior are 55%. versions of hand warlock and zoo warlock both at 57%. Holy wrath paladin at 58%, some pure paladin's at 55%. Mage has several at 57%. Rogue at 58%. Druid 55%. The only loser is priest which only has one deck at 54-55% which is combo priest.
---
Fellow albatross priest player i salute you!
---
I must say i have also consideres albatross hunter.. dire frenzy, 9 lives, would have some nuts games on wild with play dead
---
It‚Äôs a basic principle that‚Äôs in everything actually. Why do you think nerfs go circular? You nerf one thing and something else pops up and becomes stronger. That‚Äôs just the way things work in everything. Video games are not excluded from basic principles.
---
You'd think they would've learned their lesson with C'Thun, but NOPE!
---
Thats why they are 1 of tech, cause top decking only 1 copy isnt a bother when you dont use those 2, 
---
youll never double top deck them. They are 2 techs that synergise with the rest of the deck.
---
Timber wolf allowing for double kill commands as early as round 7 is enough, combined with the unleash the hounds potential.
---
The idea of this deck is to maximise damage per mana. So if hounds can give ya 4+hounds you should safely take the midround dmgs of that, combine with wolf when possible.
---
Also yes, you dont tempo out the spellzerker, you use 1 rapid fire to activate him, 
---
By round 7, 28 mana has been accessible by players, if you paid hero power ratio of 1 damage per mana, they should be nearly dead by round 7.
---
So if you find a spot where hounds plus wolf gives you 6 8 10 or 12 dmg for 4 mana, hounds +wolf, you should take it
---
Man I miss the days of shadow reaper anduin.
---
As much as people hated it, it was damn fun to play it and a fair class to play against.
---
It was the one and only time priest was truly at the top and it still had like 3-4 counters to it
---
It all went downhill from there
---
Same model. But putricides Frankenstein form was unique iirc
---
Is the bug taking a shitty video on your phone instead of just recording on the screen?
---
I can see this as actually being a good argument. I may just not have seen this enough. Usually I saw it being played defensively. Even when I put one out, then they just use theirs.
---
Yes, everyone hates divine spirit, I do too, also Auchenai and Velens. All those cards limit priest in more ways than they help them.
---
Priest has a 35 percent winrate there was no coming back for you... They struggle to close out a match.
---
Dude, my battlenet name is Shudderwock. I enjoy playing decks including Shudderwock and basicly i play galakrond shaman... because it was the cheapest to craft at this point. I had most of the deck from the get go i only needed kronx. I am not saying that the deck isn't overpowered, but just stop hating on people for playing the deck. You know in the end this is just a card game we play to have fun. Why should i go out of my way to craft a wacky deck that will have a 10% winrate and frustrate me more than making me happy. This is the last expantion of Shudderwock in standard and i want to make the most of it.
---
Well, I made a post about Priest, but I also play warlock... Can we just agree they all have sucked ass for a long time and Blizz does nothing to help them in a meaningful way? Warlock is doing /Relatively/ good this expansion.
---
It would be an interesting format where you had to create a deck that was \*Standard\* at a given point in time. So you could see stuff like Secret Paladin against current decks but without quite as much free reign as Wild.
---
If your deck has desert spear, he's worth it in my opinion. Without it he's nice, but not nearly as good.
---
Go get a life and stop complaining 24/7. The balance changes will arrive soon and we seriously don't give a fuck about your bandwagon of hate.
---
Wait, so you did this by key framing? Holy shit, that's just impressive,  I have so much respect for you
---
confirmation bias
---
No, I think you got it wrong.
---
[[King Rush]]
---
Except the source isn‚Äôt the opponent, or at least it should be, cause the text is on the card itself.
---
Which deck does Yogg are play in?
---
My mistake, I shouldn't have made it so underpowered when shaman is doing so poorly
---
I'll yoink every opponent's weapon just to hear RAKANISHUU
---
yea i feel you.

What the fuck
---
what?
---
If they wanted a value invoke they should have went with discover. Dr boom was busted because of rush, not because it sometimes got good minions for free. Probably still wouldn't have been good as discover a priest minion because so many priest minions suck. Maybe discover a priest minion, it costs one less.
---
The game engine is quite constrained and from the amount of current bugs and lack of playtesting i'm assuming they are already rushing ecpansions, so they mostly have to make do with what's already there.
---
Shaman is overpowered right now, so the ladder is full of them. Don't worry there will be a patch nerfing some Shaman cards (do not disenchant any cards as of now!), so take it with a grain of salt for some days.

do you have a list?

True, but to say QA shouldn't bring it up is to be a bad QA tester. If any of my testers had a strong opinion about any of projects and didn't raise it then they wouldn't be working on my projects anymore (QA tester of 10 years and lead of 5 in 3D GUI simulation software).

Quality isn't just bugs. QA needs to have input on the entire product from conception, through branch and into delivery.

8 mana 23/27. It's balanced because you lose tempo by playing a 5 mana 7/5.
---
yeah, instant death against highlander zhepyrs decks haha

omg, better than zephrys! nerf please.

Its pretty great all the trashcan shaman players are downvoting.  They're like "No its not overpowered I just finally found a deck that showcases how good I am!"  clowns

You sound like someone who might prefer playing Wild. Expansions don‚Äôt warp the meta like they do in standard. You can craft a deck and play it forever, only adding a few cards as needed. Some decks don‚Äôt change at all and are still competitive. I‚Äôm looking at you Mech Hunter.
---
That‚Äôs some nonsense. C‚Äôthun Druid was a monster.
---
There are a dozen budget decks less expensive than a tier 1 meta deck.
---
Whats the joke?
---
We making this a copypasta now?
---
Such a great film
---
With priest minions being conditional 80% of the time, and only having vanilla stats in a low % as well, costs - 3 mana would be ok as well lol
---
And I bet you will still spend your money on next expansion. Blizzard stays winning

I made a post a long time ago about what Dalaran heist hero people would want the most if ONLY ONE was going to be added as a hero skin. [See here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/d0hb2l/poll_hypothetical_blizzard_decided_theyd_add_one/)
---
According to a poll of that post most people want Captain Eudora, (the Rogue one) by 18.9%.
---
Second place is Hunter and third is Priest.
---
Last place at 2.7% is the Shaman one. No one likes that snake-person. Oh well.
---
This has very little to do with Hearthstone

I won‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt happy with a lot of their stuff in the past and that‚Äôs it. Go enjoy your shaman kid.

If you assume that I think confirmation bias = incorrect inclusion from data then you're horribly wrong.
---
con¬∑fir¬∑ma¬∑tion bi¬∑as*noun*noun: **confirmation bias**
---
1. the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.
---
Your belief: queuing with a deck that counters a specific one = less likely to match up with that deck
---
Your new evidence: you not queuing any Galakrond Shaman with Holy Wrath Paladin
---
Regardless of your expectation, you have a theory about it. That's why you made this entire post.
---
Nope. F2P
---
I just understand that people want a meta where lethal happens before in-game even starts. Si they'll call for nerfs on anything that keeps hyper-agro in check until the non-agro archetypes are gone.
---
Or maybe he did mulligan? Who says he didn‚Äôt? Crazy assumption about a game that literally has a knack of giving you a full hand of things you can‚Äôt summon until turn 4 maybe lmao
---
Is this OTK? That's only 10 damage...
---
I feel I'm the only person who actually enjoyed playing the game this week. Positive winrate against galakrond shaman with both waxadred rogue and galakrond warrior, both fun decks for me.
---
It's kind of funny that people can't seem to understand that different groups get enjoyment out of different things. MTG is very good at communicating this. They make cards for "Spikes" who mainly care about winning. Then they make big stuff for "Timmies" and wierd stuff for "Johnies". The community has gotten so used to this stuff, that netdecking is just assumed behaviour from the long time players.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
So Millhouse don't cause you to instantly lose? Also, who uses prep on 1 cost echo cards?
---
4 attack is a buff against priest too
---
Would a 7 mana 2/2 with those key words see play? Probably but I have no clue
---
 &gt;Might as well play Shaman.
---
Not really. I got to rank 5 with an even mix of galakrond warrior and waxadred rogue of all things. Then at rank 5 shaman is only like 20% of the meta.
---
Oh. True.
---
Cause that would make you spend less time/money to play
---
Power creep isn't when better versions of bad cards are made. It only becomes power creep when a card is stronger than any other card previously released. So basically, you should compare this to something like Dr. Boom rather than guardian.
---
There are people with millions of gold nowadays. There's an mount with an portable auctioneer that costs 5 million gold
---
The bug is the word Lackey staying on the screen.
---
Why is this that impressive?
---
I play odd rogue even without Patches (suboptimal but still work well).
---
Its a business model. A souless corporation only sees money spent &amp; play time, not player enjoyability or balanced gameplay.
---
If you want to measure your deck building skills don't play constructed in a popular game. Deck building is a small part of the game and some people enjoy refining their ability to pilot the best decks. If you want to measure deck building skills play with friends or play a deck building game.
---
Card tier aside, the animation is straight fire.
---
&gt; Yep, Mindflayer sounds good, is too slow
---
Is piloted shredder too slow nowadays?
---
Why?
---
Lol I tried to put it playful but it didn‚Äôt stop the downvotes
---
&gt;I'm not sure when was the last time Priest got a card they could simply play and potentially threaten opponent 
---
Point taken but priest is definitely the control archetype more than anything so having offensive card like that isn't its style. Combo priest aside, really good priest desks of the past are the best at board control and dragging you into the late game where they can play a bunch of huge minions. Death knight priest was really when it came out. Priest just hasn't kept pace with how aggro metas have become IMO. Which I think you are saying too.
---
Did you resolve the problem? I did. The thing was going to the blizzard case and delete the hearthstone one.
---
There is a good amount of RNG in Hearthstone - you just have to deal with it or quit. Also, the closest thing to rigging would be how Animal Companion seemingly summons the right one you need.
---
ftp btw

I'll look at it thanks !
