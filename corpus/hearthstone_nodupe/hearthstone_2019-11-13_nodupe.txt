Actually, literally everything he uses to make grilled cheese is what I use to make grilled cheese. I feel validated in my ingredients.

Also weird to think about Brode shopping in the same grocery store as me. He's a celebrity, I'm just a lowly pleb. Yet he buys the same stuff!
---
personally my favorite part of hearthstone is the single player adventure style content, so I would definitely recommend you get one and check it out and see if you like that mode. they typically dont come with great rewards for the money but i get hours of fun play out of them
---
best way to farm gold is being vigilant about completing quests. once you get some skill and can win 4+ games in arena on a regular basis, its a good way to get packs, gold, and dust.
---
Face has taunt
---
It's a computer controlled opponent so you actually have someone to fight in the next round.
---
I play on mobile and my internet is fine. I don’t have lag issues. My guess would be that unless the whole of Hearthstone is doing this to you that it’s probably because it’s still in beta phase.
---
you weren't supposed to tell

Itsa i play arena more than ranked situation

I keep either getting in the top 4 or in second place. I was so excited when the RNG rolled in my favor.
---
Yeah I've seen so many videos of krip playing this that I could've sworn I've had it a week now.
---
Well good luck to you!
---
Stupid question but I'm new to AutoChess:
---
My understanding was that minions attack L-R (hence positioning being important).
---
On a few occasions, I've had my opponents second (or sometimes first) minion swing for my far right minion, completely fucking me up.
---
Am I missing something? Are higher-tiered minions more of a priority attack wise than where they're placed?
---
Deryl's probably my favorite hero now. The playstyle is really unintuitive but surprisingly consistent. It's so satisfying to imagine your opponents asking themselves how Deryl is stronger than A F Kay on Turn 4. 
---
The strategy is to get as many things on the board as possible before turn 4, then buy everything EXCEPT the stuff you want, then sell your entire hand and board to put a billion hats on a couple of premium minions.
---
Good video but I'm a little disappointed he didn't hang dong.
---
If there is only 3 players left, one person will be without an opponent. So you are not meeting a real person, rather the computer using the board of a person who is dead.
---
Patchwerk is my bae
---
3 players left. 2 face each other and one a dead guy, a player that has lost before and thats why he has 0 health.
---
I find demons really stronger than beasts lol, except they do have mama bear. Then it's rape.
---
I think you mean the Animations being to long so people cant play properly far to meny interactions the game frezes and cant keep up no time at bobs tavern here take a look https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvdkn9/slow_animations_on_mobile_no_time_at_bob/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Pretty un-fun on mobile (android), constantly rushing the recruit turns due to lag and the interface (having to tap your hand to maximise it). A few times my tap has not registered on my hand resulting in not having time to play a purchased minion. My last game crashed during combat (before any attacks). 
---
Will try again after a few patches...more stress than fun currently as a mobile player.
---
Same here! Felt so good to finally win one!
---
He is very niche someones he is op other he does nothing.
---
What would you recommend for general tier leveling with demons?
---
They always communicate more when they are about to sell packs. It's hard not to feel cynical when [a developer directly states that more frequent communication is forthcoming in 2019](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ay645h/hearthstone_developer_ama_year_of_the_dragon/ei0v5j0/) only to contribute a small handful of comments in AMA posts when it is time to build hype for new sets.
---
cause it makes money once they drop the expansion and working on it more after releasing is wasted resources... aka money
---
From my expiration pogo is bad and is way to high rolly to be good, I attempted it and failed its a bait imo.
---
Yeah poison is extremely common, but I guess it does bring some form of balance to the game. Just hope the big boi can live long enough to do some damage lol

not yet sorry! will do in the future.

Will do in future iteration.
---
That’s alright I’m barely on reddit and wanted to tell a story. Don’t know how but that’s alright.
---
Isnt great in the late game, its the second best turn 1 card tho, and the early game does matter IMO.
---
Thanks for the help on this one.  I wish there was an officially published rule book.  Instead we rely on people's observations and the occasional dev video to know how all of the cards interact.  I know part of the HS way is to "try things and see how it turns out" but it would be nice to have an official document.
---
I'm guessing this doesn't take into account your opponent(s) already taking a minion (or minions). That is, if your on tier 4 you're refreshing for a Junkbot, but your opponent(s) already bought 8 of the 11 of them, your chances of finding one of the three are going to be more like 1.76%.
---
Still, this is a really good reference! It *should* convince me to perhaps not endlessly refresh for a triple when I could do other things instead.
---
It's like a danger zone level. Red is dangerous, green isn't.
---
Elise sounds like she'll be the most practical one, and Sindragosa seems to be the weakest, depending on the number of frozen minions they add to the game. Freeze deck didn't work in constructive, so maybe it will work in battlegrounds?
---
For example - you go menagerie and make a superbuffed Cave Hydra. You make 1 taunted creature on something with a specific number of summons - like Savannah Highmane (summons two 2/2s on death). If you place this 1 spot to the right of your Cave Hydra, then the order of events should go as follows:   
---
1) Cave Hydra attacks and lives  
---
2) Opponent attacks your taunted Savannah Highmane and it dies.  
---
3) Highmane deathrattle only has space on the board for 1 of the 2/2s.   
---
4) Cave Hydra attacks again  
---
Typically this would make your next 2 attacks come from both of the 2/2s (left to right). However, since Cave Hydra is in the place that the first 2/2 would have been, he attacks again and then the 2/2 that was summoned would attack second. Having a really large cleaver intentionally attack twice in a row to start a fight can be insanely impactful. This is at least how I've abused it most frequently.
---
Yup
---
I believe each deck that you can copy/paste is 72 characters long, but lets just be a little generous and say 80 characters. Since each character is 8 bits, that means 1 kilobyte can store 12.8 decks.
---
1 KB = 1024 * 8 bits = 8192, 80 characters = 80 *  8bits = 640 bits
---
8192 bits / 640 bits = 12.8
---
The animations eating away at turn time makes certain decks literally unplayable no matter how much APM you have.  30 seconds in the late late game to perform 20 actions isn't possible.  That gives faster resolving decks more time and I don't think that is by design.
---
Battlegrounds stinks because of this upgrading to a golden takesan excessive amount of time.
---
She's been banned multiple times for her behavior, so no, no double standard, and yes she should be banned longer than Zalae given her history. And even if I disliked her personally, it doesn't mean I have "dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women".

---
So am I the only one who got a first place win on my tracker for the tutorial? Hopefully that's a bug, because it's a little annoying to have to subtract one from my first place and top four wins when looking at my statistics.
---
How to find a list of Blizz tagged accounts?
---
For this one it's pretty clear. Only 13 comments in March before Shadows and 5 in July a month before Uldum.
---
Then its good
---
Yea I was worried about the lack of consistent (white suburb) flow. But at that moment you can tell he's at least thinking about it.
---
It's fun. But with no gold reward for wins I have no reason to play it more than the occasional what the hell game. But not a good use of time for a married with kids full time job guy. No rewards. No go. Next.
---
My god this is cringe.
---
One of these things is not like the other...
---
I've only gotten top three. Granted, I finish top 4 almost every time, cannot make it past 3 for some reason though.
---
yes pls. 21points for first place isnt realy that great :D
---
ok
---
I've got 5 first place so far. I'd say in 20-25 games today. Have played a lot of autochess variants and card games for a long time before that though.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This win was super close, went down to 1hp pretty early. Got that 1/1 demon dude up to a 60/60 by the end lol. Two amalgams with poison and divine shield taunt. It was pretty broken at the end
---
Are you really calling HIM stupid? 
---
Some people just don’t like to wear underwear. I mean let’s be real here, it must have been so brief because no one even has it clipped (yet).

And so what if someone saw a dick for a split second? Who was harmed here, really? 
---
Anyway, I’m going to sleep now.
---
Wasn't having an issue with battlegrounds, but damn this is smooth. ☺️
---
looking through the post of this reddit it seems like its not the only bug, but we can't blame them they are just an small indi company
---
&gt;First of all you need to survive the early/mid game playing murlocs, which is almost impossible
---
I might be wrong here but I've found Murlocs very strong in the early/mid game.
---
I think so
---
&gt; Zapp Slywick
---
turns out the minion tags in battleground are very messy...
---
An option to turn off animations and emotes would be amazing, if aesthetics are taking away from game performance for some then having the option to turn off to even the playing field should be a thing available to anyone who wants to use it.

Elise might be one of the best Heroes in the game. Assuming that tavern 0 is just placeholder for your new tavern. You’re always developing when you tavern up and it’s a best of 3 choices. You essentially can just tavern up quicker with less penalty. If it’s of a lower tier then still a good hero just not contending for the best.
---
I know Zappy was missing just now when I looked since there were 79 minions. Now there are 80, but there's 1 still missing right? :)
---
Pixel 3XL Smooth as butter
---
Wow thanks for a concise response! Looking forward to the changes.
---
Saw Trump do this a few days ago and had the same reaction.
---
I have an Xs and haven't had any problems with 10+. One problem I've had in mobile is I have to put the cards back to the side before I can freeze/reroll which has messed me up.
---
His answer wasn't here when i posted. He posted that he dit it only after my reply :/.
---
What i supposed to do: guess that he preordered and this is a bug, or assume the more obvious thing that he didn't?
---
I came in here to say he used excellent ingredients. I used to make sandwiches every day and this bread is far and away the best.
---
The bit that is rough for mobile is awkwardly having to open and close your hand to do anything. Having your hand expanded locks the bob controls. The amount of time I've lost from doing this. It makes it very difficult to do complex buying and selling quickly.
---
You will never reach the truth
---
Wow, we really needed a post for that
---
and it changes what exactly
---
Because its a game mode, within Hearthstone?
---
https://youtu.be/Hv6RbEOlqRo?t=36
---
The point is to get early triples and their rewards
---
Yeah I saw the video and gave him a try today. Won both my games with megafin.
---
The worst part for mobile is the way having your hand expanded locks the controls. The amount of times I've clocked reroll for it not to work because my hand is expanded. It doesn't even close the hand unless you click in the right area to close it first. This makes fast play very tedious.
---
You can waste 2 gold on rerolls, have less minions and are a turn behind on tiers if I understand you correctly
---
Imagine if they put eye for eye in there
---
I demand they fix the same thing for The Beast, would make it a top tier card
---
Battlegrounds is one of the most stupid things I ever played, hahahaha. The next time I'll play will be only if you get some extra bonus..
---
this isnt rap, its a song for kids, come on...
---
Ohhh, didn't notice that. Still pretty decent but not OP, then. Kinda sorta similar to Toki's ability to force high tier minion rolls.
---
Yeah, it's cosmetics. But another big driver that many people overlook is stuff like server transfer fees or faction transfers. Players sometimes have to change servers or switch factions to find guilds that fit their availability or raid times.
---
Inspire isn't new though, it's an established mechanic
---
I can't buy the new packs with gold until the expansion launches.  
---
If I could, I wouldn't be complaining here.
---
You monster
---
aight guys i gotta admit i may just be a bit biased towards jarraxus because i love demons / eredar / burning legion stuff and i had a blast playing him in bg. two times first place with him so far.
---
this post was made by jaraxxus gang.
---
it will continue to be an issue for 1 month out of every 4 every time a pre-order for a new expansion becomes available. this is the first time hearthstone has offered an exclusive in-game advantage for spending money. if you want to give blizzard a pass on this where will you draw a line?
---
PLayed first time, got to last two and found I couldnt kill a 54/54 1 drop so pretty much conceded.
---
Instacondeded second game for the packs.
---
Very cool mode they've made here, just not for me.
---
It [will not](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dsjrqo/battleground_bonuses_reset_for_every_expansion/f6rt6pv/?context=3).
---
&gt; In this situation - during the 4th month of descent of dragons you can have descent of dragons packs or the future expansion packs to unlock it.
---
It's not a full nerf.  
---
The previous version replaced the last minion when refreshed. This one creates and additional minion instead. It costs more mana, but also gives one more minion option.
---
Ya mobile is not playbale at the moment take a look https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dvdkn9/slow_animations_on_mobile_no_time_at_bob/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Depends what your goals are. 
---
But even if you're playing for fun it helps to understand what other decks are trying to do. 
---
You can't expect to win without putting time/effort into learning the game.  I would say the best way to learn isn't to just keep playing games, but watch twitch/youtube to see how a really great player plays.
---
Deck auto complete gives u the best deck for standard or wild that ur collection can create. It completely removed the hassle of regular netdecking for me. Probably the most underrated and awesome feature of hs.
---
Arena has the best rewards if you are decent. I think everyone should spend their gold there and not buy packs directly.
---
Battlegrounds is amazing too.
---
I'm sure there's a turn limit, but with the random way attacks happen in combat I it would be hard to guarantee that many ties in a row.
---
Mukla's effect looks more powerful but beasts aren't as good as mechs, so it evens out. Deryl doesn't always buff the minions you actually want to buy. 
---
Most of the hero powers are quite well balanced, there isn't too much in it.
---
Or 6 1/1s xD
---
PO-TA-TOE
---
You can in TFT
---
I think a great nerf to comps is actually just introducing a ton of good non comp minions. That way you wont automatically go "oh look, junk bot, I guess I go mechs", but actually consider your options. Zapp is actually a great example of very specific counter that requires consideration and very often deserves a spot on the board, even if it's just for a round or two. 
---
Hearthstone has hundreds of cards. They dont even need to nerf anything, just release a few more of the existing cards. Like, if they release carnivorous cube, it will just become an archetype on it's own. Rag the light lord could be an excellent addition too. If they added abomination, that would massively nerf Annoyomodule,  etc. Neutral units will enable counter play.
---
I like where you’re going with this!
---
It's not like there is any reward for being high ranked in that mode anyway
---
Toki is completely unplayable now. With the possible exception of tier 5 (when getting those 6-star cards becomes important), there is basically no situation in which paying 1 gold for the option to purchase a random minion from a tier above is worth it. Her hero power is objectively worse than the standard re-roll.
---
mainly? why don't we call it exclusively?
---
You have to preorder to unlock all 3 bugfixes instead of just 2
---
Rivendare can be good with 2 of those beast buff deathrattle minions, though still very niche obviously and more for mid-late game than end game comp. Brann is pretty different in that its a combo piece in midgame that you use for 1-3 turns and not leave it there for good. I guess you can argue that Khadgars use can be similar, but he doesnt give any future benefits, only a very minor rng dependent chance to win the "current" fight.
---
...wait a minute. I think you have ulterior motives.
---
If you tap and hold on hero it shows power. Don't get 3rd choice till you buy 20 dragons packs. So if you buy packs with gold (like me), gotta wait till December
---
I've gotten bored of battlegrounds pretty quick. I feel like you pray for a good murloc combo...settle for a beast combo and hope you get rating with a mech combo. I could just be bad (think I stopped around 4400 rating) but I've either won with murlocs or got stomped by them. I usually end up final 3 or 4 by committing to a tribe early on.
---
I agree though, it would be extremely more fun if there was more than those 3 tribes in your finals. Maybe I just haven't played enough but it's all I've seen
---
HearthStonene is HearthStoned
---
Is it me or does it have a bra?
---
Dragons are tricky, cuz you need to hold them in hand for most effects to occur. Although it can create some interesting strategies, if some OP dragons are allowed into the game, such as Nozari or Bone Drake. I think even elementals lend themselves better to this game mode though. Anomalous or Ozruk, for example could create some interesting strategies.
---
thanks
---
It's a A5 from Samsung it got quite laggy in the recent months but it appears like Hearthstone still fun just fine so it's not too bad I guess...
---
I'd rather not see say Dragon-Elementals or Pirate-Beasts creating decks that will likely end up being degenerate.
---
When Jade Spirit received an errata to make it an Elemental, it was all that was needed to make Jade Elemental Shaman almost tier one if I remember correctly.
---
I believe that they are 2/2s since I did this last night. Could have been some other microbot generator though.
---
I was thinking the same thing, yeah.
---
Anyone knows on what project Brode and his team are doing?
---
Thanks, I'll go for Pries then. The Deathrattle cards in Quest paladin being the Mechanical Egg and Whelp, will rotate out, so there is no core of that deck left. Maybe if some support comes out in the future.
---
I've won 2 out of 3 games, is there an MMR system? Seems a bit easy so far.
---
You can: "hey, mech lady has ds on her first taunt", or "hit with the cleave guy when facing X because Y"
---
Basically you gather info twice as fast as the rest of the pack.
---
I don' REALLY know if it matters, all I'm saying is: when we do it, we get consistent results. Maybe we're just good! :b
---
Thanks!
---
you can go in minus :O

a reddit post
---
Misleading Title... beta* is now live.
---
True, looks really good
---
you can also buy nice of dragons, better than decent tbh.
---
I sure have. I already bought the beginner pack (got Brightwing as the legendary Dragon), and I might invest more real money in the future ;)
---
More universal buffers would be nice. Right now I think we just have defender of Argus (and the taunt buffer kind of) and that's it.
---
What's the irl reward for playing Hearthstone?
---
Hi. What do you guys think about reading the previous posts on this subreddit?

This way we could save 1 minute reading reposts 30 times a day, resulting in 30 minutes of saved time.

Multiply this by the 273M people who read reports everyday and you have an infinite amount of saved time.

Probably enough to cure cancer.

Bran is fantastic
---
Faster animations means you get back to the tavern faster.
---
What was your full board? I know you didn’t flawless with just that and yeah losing no health isn’t impossible you just gotta get lucky with rolls and know when to t up dkne it a couple times now
---
Hello? God?
---
Agreed. 
---
Source: am dad
---
The only problem mech card is Junkbot coming down too early. Mechs are already balanced by poor late game scaling.
---
Okay, thank you for your correction. I'll never write "eroic" to mean "heroic", I swear. That was just a typo, nothing so special to enter this post and leave a grammar comment however. You could have instead give me a suggestion, but I'll try to don't be mean like you did.
---
Finally, did you came here only to show off your extraordinary english knowledge or can you advice me if it's a great deal the HEROIC Saviors of Uldum Bundle? Thank you :)
---
I really don't see the problem with Hyena. He's not even that good without the triple.
---
You're seriously suggesting a huge heal every turn would be a valid addition?
---
well it is an okish bundle. it was better during preorder, you missed out on a card back and a free legendary.
---
New win Animation that looks very Windows-Solitaire-inspired?
---
Yes, but the real question is how low can you go? Do you really know?
---
I don't think there is another microbot generator, but I got a golden replicating menace last night too and im certain mine still only popped 1/1s. did you maybe have mecharoo?
---
Like swatting ins.. Like swat.. Like swattin... Like swatting...
---
I don't get it
---
What I meant is that scouting is a huge part of all auto-battler (Autochess / underlord / TFT) and it should be the case in HS Battleground also :)
---
Even a single player should be able to do so
---
What is the king of late game atm?
---
There are minion buff cards that say dragon on them.
---
incredible early game and I was on top for the whole game but in the last two rounds against the second guy I got wrecked, not sure how good he does late game
---
Opponent conceded by turn 8, after I used [Righteousness] on my three minions with Bolvar on board since turn 4.
---
the need for meaningful stats.... rather than "feel good ones"
---
You can also use him to make tokens to cheat out upgrades if you get it right. Two kadgars with a token generator like taddy cat will net you 4 alley cats. The 4 alley cats will upgrade into a free upgrade of a mnion on the next level. Not going to lie, but you got to get some fast apm to abuse this interaction.
---
You definitely dont need to spend money if you dont want to man! I recently came back after a but of a hiatus and managed to put together a budget deck after a week or so. 
---
Just make sure to keep on top of your quest as much as possible and play a match whenever you have a second, even if its just in casual
---
Both of you are misunderstanding what he is saying. He is saying that your hidden MMR should be the same as your visible MMR. He is NOT saying that your rank on the leaderboard should be your MMR (ie rank 1 has 1 mmr). He is saying that the MMR used to calculate your rank on the leaderboard should be the same as your hidden MMR.
---
Kripp's smurf didn't reach higher than his main, but I would like to see how long it would take him to get to his main MMR if he did poorly on his first 25 games. It is naturally difficult to ride early large MMR gains past 7k.
---
I also wanna add I didnt lose a single fight after this, and well.. I didnt really BUFF it, I simply got low health, had a third pit lord frozen, used the dwarf that doubles the battlecry, played 2 pit lords, bought a third and played it again. I did change a lot after this prinscreen, and like I said, I lost 0!
---
Also one of my first games
---
The 7/11 windfury guy is a great counter and Brann and Baron can be really good.
---
*Herman Cain has entered the chat.*

It doesn't make any sense. Having extremely good cards and extremely bad cards doesn't balance RNG, it just makes it worse. If all of the cards were at a similar level, the roll RNG would be much lower, because players would go for more strategies, having a broader card pool, and picking what they want more consistently. Right now at least 4-5 players per game are going for Mechs, so not only it's a rather small pool of key cards to being with, but the fact that so many players are fishing for them decreases it further. 
---
If every card/strategy was at a (roughly) the same power level, then the RNG would be much lower than it is right now. How does adding a bad card "balance RNG"? It's not Constructed, when they add a bad X cost minion to balance Evolve effects - every player in Battlegrounds is seeing cards from the same pool.
---
Your pogos could be poisoned too, they're not as good as they look. Scaling is much better
---
Not even Wrathion counts as a Dragon, and he’s a minion. Sadly, if it doesn’t call it a dragon it won’t count as one
---
I have exactly the same problem since the latest patch... Tried clearing cash, app data, full reinstall... nothing helped... The game crashes before the menu loads with the "Unfortunately, Heartstone has stopped"... :(
---
There just need to be more neutral buffs if you ask me, or neutrals need to be offered a tier lower than they are. Boogeymonster should be tier 3 at least. 
---
Also, there need to be dragons and I will not be completely fulfilled until they are added 
---
Also also the amalgam that Curator gets should be a 0/1. It’s ridiculous that he starts the game with an extra token AND can buff it with anything.
---
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
---
Face down
---
Ass up
---
Yeah, the Micro Machine in the screenshot it golden already. So a triplet -&gt; Discover Tier 3 -&gt; Shifter -&gt; Mama Bear makes sense, even if it's the most luck anyone ever had.
---
&gt; The issue won't be with balancing the individual cards but with the concept itself
---
Nightmare Amalgam and Hench-Clan Hag are cards so this is blatanly untrue.
---
Team 5 has complete control over what cards are in standard so with some forsight this is absolutely doable.
---
Damn, to think I wasted so much time. (｡╯︵╰｡)
---
People before have made this accusation and then have been asked to provide data, and then everything all goes eerily quiet and we never hear anything back.  This leads me to believe that either:
---
a) Everyone is quick to throw accusations around but nobody wants to go to the trouble of actually proving it. or
---
b) People are looking at the data and it really doesn't tell the story they want it to tell.
---
Bonemare brann no thanks
---
 you win in BG of you are in the top four. Of course being first is nice, but in the end as long as you don’t get a minus value, you win.
---
This is too long to read honestly but... on number 4 that's absolutely wrong.  Pick 1 should ALWAYS prioritize a token generator regardless of tribe. 
---
From there you actually want too see what enabler you get and then go hardcore into that synergy. Typically that means pairing early so that you can discover a strong build around ( preferably from tavern 4 into 5). If you get a hit from that (lightbringer please!!!) You are off and cooking.
---
The only time I won with Demons is when I got an early Turtle from an Golden, then two more the next two turns.
---
Yep, still happening for me. I tried everything you said plus what was suggested in these comments. Nothing works. It'll work fine then suddenly I cant open the app anymore due to the *same crashes* I list in the OP. I also had a crash after winning a wild match. Guess we'll just have to wait again for the next patch and hope for a stable app...

---
And summaries theories based on the more vague powers;  
---
 The speculation is as follows; When Sindragosa's hero power refers to "Freeze", it's assumed it means minions you've frozen to see again for next turn in Bob's Tavern.  
---
Elise's hero power, as it triggers on the upgrade, could be either the next tier up or same tier, but it's agreed it makes more sense balance-wise if the recruitment map referred to the current tier.
---
People have also been asking "where's Reno?" and since nothing's been found, it's either assumed he's yet to be developed, or they're just showing him no love.
---
So THAT'S where they're coming from.
---
I think its pretty cool, a stronger effect with the cost of being a hand condition.
---
Not harder, more highroll-ey
---
Is it worth it to craft whizbang? Are the decks actually viable in standard or modern or is it more just a fun card to mess around with?
---
sent friend req
---
It did give you lethal, didn't it?
---
Cabal Shadow Priest onto the taunt, attack with all minions (including the stolen minion)
---
Yeah... no.
---
If arena wasnt so much RNG I would play it more. I get really salty about getting warrior, hunter, druid as my choices. I kinda wish they would keep the dual class option permanently.
---
Stolen minion doesn't get charge - only temporary steal effects like Shadow Madness and Potion of Madness give them charge.
---
Either one works.
---
Nice Togglewaggle scheme
---
OK, fair enough.
---
But I was talkin bout the smackaroo to face for 33
---
Hearthstone strategy doesn’t come from picking minions to attack. That’s a big deal in like Arena, but that is its own mode really.
---
In fact, if you look at Constructed replays, I’d bet you will find that wins rarely come from picking minion attacks at all, it’s a pretty inconsequential piece of the game compared to the things that really decide the victor.
---
In Constructed, wins come from your deck, your draw, and your matchup - none of which comes from the actual players input.
---
In BG, it’s much more likely that a win or loss is a direct result of the decisions you made as a player, even if you are deciding things amongst a sea of RNG, you are still always deciding. Not true of Constructed.
---
That’s pretty much all there is to get.
---
Cant you make your own decision?
---
Except when everyone goes mechs, then noone goes mechs.
---
The problem is still going to be having dual tribal cards and having that aspect of the cards truly matter outside of situations where it allows decks to play cards they really shouldn't be. (The breath cycle in DoD is one quick example of that.)
---
Well-chosen class restrictions would make balancing them easier, but outside of having more vanilla minions, interesting dual tribe minions (ones that can reasonably support both tribes it's a part of with its effect) would be a difficult concept to approach. As I mentioned, Jade Spirit becoming an elemental was enough to bridge Elemental Shaman and Jade Shaman into the same deck.
---
Stupidly strong for dual tribe minions could potentially be having any effect at all depending on the tribes chosen.
---

Because Snip Snap Lock needed to be a thing but Blizz knew it needed lengthy animations to balance it out, duh. /s
---
Just want to clarify that I'm not a dev, just a regular user. Lol.
---
It counts all packs you obtain. Do you guys really not open 20 packs a set?
---
I wonder if it’s using a signed 32 bit integer like everywhere else in hearthstone, which means eventually you could get the negative number to change into the largest possible positive number.
---
So enemy minions attack taunt first and then everything else (at random)?
---
sorry squire, the combos that use Wild cards won't work
---
Wanker
---
It's best not to worry about the other opponents' boards too much until you get to the final few games, and by that time typically you'll have seen your opponent's board at least once. 
---
There are also time considerations. Each game is already pretty long, if you added in the time needed to peek at your opponents' boards and tailor to those I think it would add even more time. Though admittedly I'm not too familiar with other autobattlers so I could be wrong on that.
---
What I want to do is to be able to scout... It's one of the main parts of auto battlers imo.
---
I have one minion for you to look at sir.
---
Wrath Weaver
---
Lol, well all your stuff was backed up by Donais, so I'll take it as legit.
---
Rat King is one of the top heroes. You don't have to stick to a single tribe. Rat King carries really hard if you drop the single tribe mindset.
---
Exactly!
---
This seems fun
---
Why would anybody ban tony lol?
---
Maybe don't spend so much time writing tips when you've barely played and half of it is wrong.
---
Your opponent will ban cinderstorm and any aggro deck will murder you.
---
At that low a rank, I bet there are many people trying the same thing.
---
What if they ban Flamewalker?
---
I wish they would be more liberal with adding/removing cards from the arena pool situationally to balance the meta. It could be a very fun mode if they were willing and able to put in the effort.
---
Almost, just add a huge foe reaper to the left.
---
Very likely. I can't imagine anyone legitimately playing, losing a few thousand ELO, and then \*still\* playing. XS
---
Same is happening to me on my iPad mini
---
In one game where it was down to two players, I was at 1 life, and had to beat the number 1 player three times in a row to win. And did it. It was glorious
---
This game mode is just infuriating.. the amount of rng needed is way to high and the fact you are at a huge disadvantage if you dont buy the bundles to get another hero slot just adds to it..
---
Highest possible is about 600 I believe
---
I have 6g of ram and its still unplayable...
---
Golden Boogey just got me 1st last game
---
I realized if you "put your card to the side" it usually fixes most issues
---
Yeah, such a huge disadvantage that people get rank 1 with it. Oh wait...
---
How does one get poisonous on all mutvollste btw? I just got steamrolled by a dude with 6 murlocs/amalgams with 4x divine shield and all poisonous and didn’t quite grasp how he managed to do that.
---
Why you got to do kibler like that
---
Quest Hunter smokes it. They can't beat the Sea Giants.
---
Man there is so many new bugs in this game it’s kinda exciting
---
Right, but lets say im the Rat King and i never get a demon when i have the demon buff, etc. etc. Or you are the Lich King and get no good deathrattle minions, making his power pretty lackluster.
---
Playing Arcane Missiles-Sorcerer's Apprentice-Flamewaker-Research Project  I lost to:
---
1. Evolve/Mutate/Fleshshaper/Desert Hare Shaman where they banned (arcane Missiles)
---
It's cool to get free things.  And these are iconic in WOW but would it kill them make it two copies? I mean man that's stingy.
---
Actually, this is pretty bad.  Since griefers know how this works, it allows them to intentionally BM.  I've already encountered this in a few games.  Opponent has a winning position, ropes every turn and won't finish you off, and removes your board so that you can't win.  I've conceded against them and gotten no quest progress.
---
Lost three times in a row against evolve shaman and got this weird bug where I don't get my reward.

Aah right. Never saw one so I didn’t knew it was in the mode. Thanks
---
Then don't put it on mobile?
---
max of 3 people there as well though
---
I'm glad you made the Tower Defense analogy. I've played several of those and didn't enjoy it, but I've known people who have. But I did enjoy Plants vs Zombies... probably because I *did* know who my units would be attacking, plus I enjoyed the silly theme.
---
Yeah, I'm seeing now that this is just Hearthstone applied in a different genre. A genre that I don't enjoy, but that's fine :)
---
My turn timer was running out, I quickly tried to sell that demon that's hovering over my opponent, but I wasn't fast enough. When the next match started, the game was stalled. The game hasn't frozen, but nothing is moving forward. Minions aren't attacking. I've been stalled on this screen for nearly 10 minutes now. I can still concede, but can't do anything else to get the game moving.
---
Hearthstone
---
You didn't ban Desert Hare?
---
The game expected you to finish second based on mmr so you didn't get points. Or it may be a bug who knows. People have been complaining about this for days for this beta
---
Stop Blizzard he's already dead
---
The only way to clear the 5 gold is to hope you get a 5 gold reward in arena quests only give 50 60 80 or 100
---
Nah they’re just lazy as fuck
---
Finally someone that sees that mode as what it is.
---
Can someone explain to me how this got 160 upvotes when you can queue with friends (at least one other friend)?
---
LoL people are so defensive over this game.
---
You cannot sell minions from hand you can only sell them from the board after they were played
---
That's *hat*!
---
I searched every folder and every sub folder and while I found some interesting things, I haven't been able to find a Options.txt file at all.
---
I found a few similar files that are in a .txt format
---
If other players see you are playing it they can choose to pick mechs and screw up your pool too as its shared pool.  Before I start choosing I see if any other heroes have predictable path and I'll pick their tribe if I can.
---
You literally can you just challenge them to a game of battlegrounds
---
Wait, you got to 4700 without a win?
---
Play a different deck I feel sometimes that you can become very angry after playing the same deck for a long time because you start to feel the draw rng a lot more after playing a deck for a long time. Also different decks can keep the game fun.
---
There’s nothing to talk about in ladder. Standard is still just a dull, Shaman-infested snorefest. Wild is about the same as it’s been for three card sets. You’re not going to get any meaningful posts here *anyways* unless it’s abouf Battlegrounds. 
---
I recommend just waiting until the new set releases, or migrating over to /r/competitivehs.
---
Well you didn't get first place, you just barely made 1o posto.
---
What happena with 1000 wins?
---
I seem to remember going from 0 to 4000 after getting first in the tutorial. That can't be right, can it?
---
I managed to get 3rd last night. I eliminated myself with that minion that hits you and gains stats when you play a demon.
---
It was so fun, I want to play more
---
If you play curator in the battlegrounds is it better to buy a minion with a token or the 2/3 murloc to buff your amalgam on turn 1?
---
Legendary quests always override one daily
---
Before the win I played 4 or 5 games and I always finished in top 4 or better, now you make me think that I got the points but he only displayed +0
---
Yes, it is really me. How ya doing?
---
Dancin' Deryl is impossible on mobile just tried, but the hats are too slow.
---
Its no more but the truth
---
It’s almost like it’s the beta.
---
You're 1) OK with a class being completely ignored, and 2) base this off the fact that it plays either entirely aggro or entirely control.
---
Ignoring the fact that Warrior has combo decks readily available (see: Mechathun), archetypes shared by other classes (see: Big Warrior, Big Priest), and quest decks (see: taunt), ...
---
... ignoring all of that, I take it by your statement that you prefer to play exclusively against combo and midrange decks?
---
They released new hero portraits for 1000 ranked wins

Warrior has been also top tier with tempo and combo decks... like patron warrior or dragon warrior in TGT.

You are only remembering pirate warrior and SOU control warrior.
---
yeah i didnt end up doing it lol.
---
What QA staff?
---
Golden Lightfang is pretty bonkers.
---
kinda... yeah!
---
A brann and only murlocs/amalgams would be the sickest board of this murloc would be in the game. Sure, they cannot resummon anything, but give them so many health buffs and poisonous and they don't need to resummon anything.
---
I bought it for me, then gifted twice, if u like hs pve, slay the spyre is that on crack. 
---
Super good game!!
---
who taught that "The Beast" would be a good card???
---
I absolutely love this combo - honestly I feel like the best ban would be arcane missile.
---
I agree with this in principle.  The problem isn't even with murlocs, it is with amalgams.  Getting poison on an early divine shielded, 15/15 amalgam at Tier 4 is gamebreaking.  Moving Amalgam to 3 would help a little bit.  
---
I would be much happier with Toxfin moving to 5 if there were another feasible Murloc added to the pool at 4.  I don't know what Murlocs in the current pool would work there though, but I have a few ideas:
---
*Hydrologist could make some sense.  There is precedent for secrets in the game from the Akamzarak.  
---
*Finja could work if it somehow summoned random Murlocs upon killing something.  
---
Scargill would work if it changed the cost of Murlocs in the Tavern to 1.
---
In the main game, this isn’t a problem. Cards that can do something are highlighted for you.
---
So for instance, in battlegrounds, if a card can give you a triple, it should glow, like it does in the main game. That would be a start.
---
In the main game, if you played Loki, you’re shown all 4 cards to choose from. Having 6 cards to choose from only happens at tier 6 in battlegrounds, but could be done very easily.
---
The mode is in beta for a reason. It’s no longer a ‘tavern brawl’ as it was originally meant to be. It’s going to become a real game.
---
Does hiding the effect of a card help new users or not? Seriously?
---
I don’t get the objections to this?
---
Those aren’t totally different games. Battlegrounds is.
---
Its pretty easy to get this comp everygame
---
Personally I think the most successful playstyle is rat pack/ scavenging hyena decks. early game beasts are solid, including the previously mentioned, and can be really easy to build up. Lots of different effects and more end game minions like mama bear, ghastcoiler, and Goldrinn. And of course, amalgam.
---
I've lost a few first places due to this. Came in second despite knowing what first place was playing as it's just us two left, but didn't have enough time to rearrange my board and upgrade/swap stuff at the same time. It usually happens if I'm playing big mechs and magnetising a lot of stuff
---
It isn't even the optimal strategy.  Getting a golden junkbot is certainly not a win either.   An early lightfang enforcer is far more significant.
---
Don't attribute to big brained ideas what can more easily be attributed to laziness
---
Hearthstone battlegrounds = 0 iq
---
would be nice to see the board of the opponent he last used against you. Like a screenshot you could literally do and put on your second screen. 
---
But that would be too much to ask for.
---
Toxfin should be 6 star
---
What the actual fuck are you on about lmao, I have zero of the issues you are having, and I play movile only

That's just being silly. There's as much difference between Arena and Standard as there is between Standard and BG.

Anyone gets crazy laggy on their phones after like 7 rounds? It gets so slow to the point that I don't even get to do the recruiting phase. I'm literally just A.F Kaying after that man
---
Ye, nice theory you have there
---
He was surprisingly decent. I don't know how good he really is, but upgraded, he has like over 10 health I think and gains +4 attack per popped bubble
---
TBH, I don’t think that goes far enough to make Evolve viable.
---
Make it Charge instead.
---
Game has been out for a day. At this point it's more about how much you've played than how good you are. One because time to grind, Two  because most people are new so it's testing your ability to quickly hit the skill floor than hit the skill ceiling.
