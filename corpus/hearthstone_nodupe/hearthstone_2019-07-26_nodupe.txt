I bet you're here in the comments to see the hero power reward, huh?
---

---
Don't. Watch the reveal video. It's like 2 minutes and is SO WORTH. Even if you DO know the hero power I STILL suggest the reveal vid. Trump's best.
---
No its mine :)
---
Brode reborn
---
CC is the reason I‚Äôm eking out a subsistence in wild with an immortal deck wishing I could bother with standard again
---
This is fantastic! I love how the video rips on Trump and Amaz for being bad.
---
I think paralyze ends after your turn.
---
You are informed? Lol. You don't trust into a variety of sources from the broad range of the political specturm, not the FBI, the CIA, the Senate and House committees... but you are "more inofrmed than me". LMFAO! 
---
And, trust me, I don't want to go where you are.
---
So, now, show me how informed you aree by actually posting some information pertaining to the issues raised. Also, please debunk the findings of the intelligence agencies. Or of Director Mueller's  yesterday's testimony...
---
Warrior is gonna be strong, lol.
---
How do you even analyze it, though? ‚ÄúPlayers conceded until they got the ‚Äòbest‚Äô deck‚Äù?
---
Oh yeah that works
---
thanks!!
---
I see what you did there, this is great
---
why is this downvoted?
---
Yes. I know I am. I absolutely know it, no doubt at all whatsoever. 
---
 Your attitude shows me this is a waste of my time though You seem *incredibly* young and you‚Äôre not there yet.
---
Im now playing the game of "who can concede the fastest?" in mirror matches.
---
Ironically CW can use this quest as a consistant infinite value source. You wabt to use weapon to remove stuff anyway during the game
---
This is much worse than people in this thread seems to think.
---
Big priest should be called Unicron Priest.
---
Big shaman value
---
Lol. YOu are so inofrmed that you know my alleged age..."young". Lmfao. You offer nothing to proof any of your claims... because you obviously can't. Also, what is my "attitude"? Do you mean actually being informed about stuff? Reading newspapers and reports?
---
Eh... not if they print a Deathbite clone again like bloodrazor lol
---
Worst part about prison is the 4 mana 7/7‚Äôs
---
How would that have even worked
---
I'm just so sick of warrior at this point that I hope this card is total trash. Maybe not the best reason, but that's what I'm going with.
---
The problem wasn't the reward or the clear condition necessarily
---
The biggest problem was having a dead turn one that does nothing, with a payoff that comes many turns later after playing a bad deck 
---
That's why the quests that revolves around tempo didn't work. It wasn't because the reward wasn't good enough it was just that it was against your game plan 
---
Ok top of that you have the fact that those decks were running unoptimized lists in order to complete the quest, and you just have a recipe for disaster 
---
Why give up your turn one and play a bunch of bad cards when you could just instead play good cards and kill your opponent on turn 7 
---
So to answer your question, the quests can't really work unless the rewards are so broken that it makes it worthwhile
---
Heads I win, tails you lose
---
Must be an avid aggro player then
---
When this minion attacks an enemy, it instead attacks your own hero. Twice.
---
I'm ready for the Overwatch crossover expansion!
---
You figured it out from the comments, what I want to add is that there are tooltips in game that tell you what mechanics/keywords like Battlecry do. Mouse over the card and it'll tell you. Like [here](https://sportsbard.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/hearthstone-screenshot-12-07-15-10-33-05.png). The in-game tooltip is *Deal excess damage on your turn for a bonus.*
---
She's extremely annoying and fake, makes me miss Brode even mpre
---
Brawl needs to go for sure, but since that won't be the case until next rotation (most likely), looks like warrior might have more playable clears.
---
Yeah, I've been playing a lot of silence priest this expansion and it's closer than people realize.  \[\[Extra Arms\]\] can snowball so quickly if you have the quality one drop to pair with it.  It just out tempos opponents.
---
Interested to see what else they print.  Psychopomp is really interesting and the legendary has some really practical combo potential.  Shaman's been looking pretty powerful though, I'd probably give the nod to them.

AFAIK, he doesn't play HS anymore...

She's really good, but people like Dog and Firebat are serious pros at the top of the game. Kibler is great but prefers to have fun with it, he's more of a professional streamer than a professional player. I don't even think he likes playing, its just his job. Great streamer though.

Every day you're not streaming, you lose subscribers.  Streaming is a snowball game, the more viewers you have, the more publicity you get, the more viewers you gain.  It's a really volatile occupation, much moreso if you have an inconsistent stream schedule that forbids you from streaming during peak hours.

4 in 5 games are not against warrior, but that 1 in 5 takes as much time as all the rest of them.

what if they made the mana values dynamic while the minion was on the board or something?

this might be a stupid idea but so is 4 colossi of the moon on the board
---
This won't age well. Warrior has literally an infinite amount of activators for this.
---
First thread of this kind that catch my attention because your deck has reasonable number of wins. Did you grandfathered it? Are all the wins from today/late yesterday after #280 spread?
---
Nice mage got even better:/
---
I have an idea. Big Paladin! There's \[\[Prismatic Lens\]\] which could fetch out some huge minions, and this set I imagine has the biggest bois given on the thematic of Titans. I expect \[\[Duel!\]\] to also to work here.
---
I didn‚Äôt grandfather it i only noticed this deck after losing to a Druid while using mercenaries and the wins I got from this deck have been from today.
---
The WoW TCG card that Ancient Watcher's art comes from is called "The Fall of Neferset City". It has the following flavor text:
---
&gt;"If we take down Dark Pharaoh Tekahn, the immortal colossi will fall and our armies will be able to march into Neferset City." - King Phaoris
---
It is more accurate to say that Ancient Watcher should be far stronger than it currently is, but it is certainly an immortal colossus just as Colossus of the Moon is.

---

---
Play Gods Unchained, you actually own your digital cards and can sell/trade them for money. Hearthstone is the biggest ripoff.
---
i've beaten a few with a "burn" mage deck.  the last one had ships cannon turn 2 and 4 patches turn 3.
---
had lots of removals and volcanic potion to early board control, then dropped lich king, and finished with pyro.
---
And hunter only has 3 weapons lol
---
&gt;  However I do see Mogu Cultist seeing regular play.
---
Define "regular". I would be flabbergasted, mind-blown, if Mogu Cultist was in even 0.5% of decks a month after the release, much less what I would consider actual "regular play". 
---
I guess I'll say this - I guess it's nice to be able to dream big.
---
This was the point of the brawl, I‚Äôm surprised it took so long tbh. And in NA it isn‚Äôt even a done deal yet, lots of powerful decks have been chipping away at merc280‚Äôs numbers.
---
No, this man is the enemy, join the fight with Big Demons 73 and take on the mercenary threat !
---
You're against a warrior, no hope to be found and your phone is dead. Out of the corner of your eye you spot him:
---
*Shia Labeouf*
---
Great
---
More support for control warrior
---
Wooo :/
---
Great video I didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with it editing wasn‚Äôt crispy clean but I dont expect that anyways
---
That's why you run redundancy in combo decks:
---
Amet
---
2 boars
---
2 topsy
---
2 pws
---
2 divine spirit
---
Now what are the chances you don't draw a 30 damage combo?
---
I concede to mirror matches too cause they‚Äôre boring.
---
That's Charles Entertainment Cheese to you, sir.
---
You traded five mana for ten as well, and new hunter can deal with that card exchange rate
---
I'm thinking of it as a revolution, gotta take power back from the mercenary dictatorship.
---
Yes, Cataclysm was a WoW expansion, and actually a pretty big one considering that it didn't just include the usual new areas of the world, but it actually changed the old maps as well into devastated new versions to reflect Deathwing causing the Cataclysm.  It was pretty much a hard reset of most regions of Azeroth.
---
Given how at least some of Hearthstone's expansions have been based loosely on WoW expansions, I'd be surprised if we didn't eventually get a Cataclysm one.

This is legitimately the nuts what the f. I don‚Äôt really see how a game could (realistically) end faster
---
Sadly, i didn‚Äôt record the entire turn, but basically I had 2 circle of healings, and coin only, and was definitely going to die to my opponent next turn. I got a super lucky draw, and I got wild pyromancer. Then I burned like a bijjilion cards due to him having 2 northshires.
---
Guess his reborn version is the sun
---
Thanks, i hate it
---
Icehowl had ‚Äúrush‚Äù so it had an immediate effect though.
---
I do.
---
Cho has real potential here, especially if you're running the final run with the mass spellcasters at the end.
---
After playing this game since closed beta ,making almost all decks from t1 to t3 each expansion I‚Äôve finally quit . It‚Äôs not fun anymore and you can get the same fix if not better from auto chess games .
---
I got merc 280 and out if all the mirror matches i have played, it felt like the majority of hearthstone players don't understand what to do in an ultra aggro vs ultra aggro situation.
---
it's not the best deck in the game mech hunter is and anyone with half a mind can easily beat a control warrior in the majority of matchups
---
I like this in wild mill warrior. Yum.
---
It's nowhere near UI.
---
5 armour to your hero is totally different to 5 health to everything. You can play 5 armour without thinking of consequences but do you really want to heal your opponent 5? What about their army of minions? UI also summoned a 5/5 which Overflow doesn't.
---
MERC 280 ARMY.

---
especially since you can restore the opponents heath, too, so you aren't limited as much.
---
Poison Seeds now is fundamental for Jade Druid in Wild to clear big boards, then block them with Spreading Plague or Starfall.
---
I guess it depends on what kind of deck you're running.  We'll have to see how it does, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was a combination of the two run.  Druid's gotten away with running a LOT of draw in various decks in the past.
---
It's just a card for non-Even Shaman decks, it's not going to kill the popularity of Big Priest alone.
---
Slightly-more-balanced Infestation  
---
even though the heal effect is mediocre, 7 mana draw 5 is still a good deal (cries in Sprint)
---
Nazis hate him, he is a living mockery of their ideology.
---
MERC 280 ARMY!
---
LIGHT... THE PYRES? LIGHT THE PYRES!
---
5 mana is a lot less than 9
---
To everyone who‚Äôs asked in the main thread and on this thread, yes, Mercenaries 14 is the exact same deck. There is literally not one card difference. It‚Äôs the exact same deck, the only difference is Mercenaries 280 is NA, and Mercenaries 14 is EU.
---
Say that to a board full of dormant Lucentbark
---
"Overflow" draw 5 cards + this is pretty much Prep+Sprint, probably better because you draw 1 more card and save 2 more mana (1 more mana if you consider that this card is overcosted), at the cost of flexibiltiy
---
Fine, I'll play with that Lucentbark you gave me
---
I forgot to say that in this but just added it as a reply- Mercenaries 14 is the exact same deck.
---
How do you mean he hasn't had to pay for packs in a very long time? Does he run infinite arena for gold or something? How is he getting free packs.
---
Merc 280 can suck it. Such a boring deck to play. I deliberately didn't play anything until turn 3, dropped a Southsea Captain, and won a few turns later.
---
Found the counter to the deck though, Protectors 1987 can wall up enough to stall through the pirates. Golakka Crawler can help with pesky Kraggs or Southseas.
---
I love this one! Draws one more card than \[\[Sprint\]\] AND heals your board.
---
Dust Devil Dream Prophecy Prison Trump has potential tho

---
Sprint draws 4 cards for the same cost. Well, Rogue got Preparation which significantly boosts Sprint viability, but Druid just got a Minion that synergies with 5+ manacost spells and feels like a Sprint equivalent.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs the exact same. I just edited it to reflect this.
---
You‚Äôre supposed to take snip-snap here, right?
---
Dev ran out of ideas &gt; let's reprint cards 
---
Druid has always been either super mediocre or super busted 
---
i wonder where is it this time?
---
OP on wild withe the 4/4 with the same effect
---
That face
---
I came here for this! thanks!
---
this vs sprint
---
Agree, Joe Rogan himself could not have said it better.
---
So at first I was all: "Eh, it's kinda whatever, you risk the chance of healing your opponent's board too." Then I saw Anubisath Defender and thought: "Well fuck..."
---
Big Spell Druid? I honestly think this could be a good card in a token druid deck where you‚Äôre casting that twinspell cars that gives you 5 2/2‚Äôs, hopefully allowing them to stick for a board wide buff next turn. I think this card could see some play tbh
---
So a lower winrate means it takes more skill?  That's a weird correlation to make.
---
Sprint was over costed because of prep though.
---
I would definitely take snip-snap there, but there's nothing wrong with a third zilliax tho
---
I love the giants and hated when Molten Giant got moved to HoF. I don't think they are bad, I think this spell is absolutely too powerful for the game that is happening in Standard play.
---
Kripp actually makes very little money from Donations / endorsements . He has publicly shown his donos before and for a steam his size they are almost nothing. 
---
He also doesn't take much payment from doing the sponsored games he does. Preferring to do games he wants an thinks his audience will like over big money.
---
Don't get me wrong, Kripp is doing well for himself (fairly when you think of the time he puts in) but he doesn't push it when it comes to wringing as much money out of steaming as possible as you see with a lot of streams
---
As long as you have the same amount or more minions than your enemy, this is a 1-mana Twisting nether.

I'm sorry, got a flash of horrible memories for a second there... UI... Ugh. Well, this is certainly different. A hell of a reload, with a potential brat of a board heal for a control druid, but I'm glad to see a potential shift away from Token, just a bit.
---
Fear not, they just added a 10 mana divine shield reborn to dilute the Sea Giant pool of minions!
---
Will be fun when they RNG 2 of those for 3 mana (and 1 more on the next turn).

sad that this is even an issue

Yeah I'm confused too. I know it's from r/hearthstonecirclejerk, but I don't know where exactly it comes from :(

Sometimes I meet a mercenary deck on EU with another number but it seems to be the exact same deck.

---
I am annoyed that you are forced to take your opponent's deck if you lose.  
---
I like the brawl, I like that it counts victories.   
---
But I don't like how it forces the enemy's deck on me.   
---
 As we all know Mercs 14/280 is the most common deck, therefore it is statistically the highest chance to lose to it and be given it.   
---
Every time this happens I have to concede games until I match with a non-mercs deck, then concede again to finally get a different deck.   
---
The Brawl is essentially forcing me to concede a few times after every loss until I can get a new deck. Instead of just giving me a random deck when I lose.   
---
I already see Mercs more than half the time, so why the hell would I want to play it instead of something interesting?Further, where's the fun in playing against the exact same deck? At least match me up with non-mercs to avoid mirrors, further the wins counter and make it worthwhile to play by having a chance of getting a different deck when I lose
---
Next: scarab rush. Fill your board with 1/5 scarabs
---
There was a strong discussion about that, many people said that the rogue plague was changed in the last minute to fit into the "Class Identity" theme, but Im not quite sure if it was confirmed by the devs.
---
Just stop playing when you lose some games in a row. If youre tilted you'll make mistakes and get even more tilted. Just do something else for a while, relax and ease your mind :)
---
Oh no, I'm not against giants, hell I loved using the Arcane Giants for the Mage Quest combo. I just think their mix with a 3 mana CC was very poor design, but odds are it just slipped through. Really should have been fixed by now though!
---
I think it's perfectly fine to power creep a basic card from another class.
---
This is the PM I voted for.
---
Cause he has good stats for the mana cost! Check his flavor.
---
Hitler was also vegan. Coincidence? I think not!
---
Ahhh yes, seems like Blizzard is going all in on my favourite archetype this expansion, self card burn Druid.
---
Real talk though, this at least looks interesting, especially compared to UI.
---
Reminder that most people thought prerelease this card wouldn't be very good
---
Naah 4 Patches in a deck is perfectly balanced.
---
I laugh at the idea that there will be a competitive priest deck in standard next expansion.
---
nah, I just dont post in /r/hearthstonecirclejerk, because its just more to follow and i dont feel like it. I knew this meme from here, and thats about it.  The meme was born on this /r/, not circlejerk's.  Don't pay for any more psych classes.  It's a waste of your money.
---
Magnetize this and you are good to go.
---
I've had a lot of fun with my Thief Rogue deck, it's not a hit in that it wins often (it doesn't) but the fun of the chaos and the thrill of a powerful lifesteal weapon against usually significantly stronger decks is just great! Would you want me to put the decklist or something, whether here or PM?
---
This is why I switched out Snip Snap for Dah Undatakah. Egg and pi√±ata synergy
---
It‚Äôs a better Sprint that heals.
---
Yea all 5 stated as well
---
I would have taken it there. It's more flexible, can come 2 turns earlier and actually has synergy with your 2 Zilliaxi. He's not going to lose to burn decks in arena so I think a 1st sn1p sn4p is better than a 3rd Zilliax.

But you lose a card, so it's not really free value. Never felt like arcane tryant was op or anything.

Three legendaries per 40 packs is well above average. Definitely a worthwhile investment
---
As a meme rogue main, this does hurt, lol.
---
Then its not draw 5, its draw 3.
---
Druid doesn‚Äôt get preparation
---
Such a strong spell with a powerful looking art.... for only 1 mana!
---
Remember Lord of the Rings?
---
This man aggressively defends semantics. Never get words confused in his presence.
---
Hopefully in two expansions they will fix this horrid power creep, one can hope it is that quick. /s
---
Honestly the spell by itself limits the cards they can and should make during this rotation, it needs to be brought back into a reasonable mana range so that the crazy full board of giant spam happens at the very least later in the game where there exists a few more board clear/removal options so that there can be a bit more play-counter-play.
---
I don't know, talk about going full northshire
---
Play Overflow and then draw into this?
---
Reborn on the whole magnetic minion would be op
---
This isn't even power creep what are you on about?
---
Nice
---
Well, you should do the legendary thing no matter what you do. If you have the spare cash and are not afraid to drop it on something you might not want to pursuit further, go get it :)
---
And i forgot to mention that you get classic packs for climbing trough the starter ranks (50-25).
---
I mean, so is the entirety of Hearthstone.
---
What Tavern Brawl absolutely is, however, is a playground to test new game features that may or may not make it into the game in some way. Stuff like restricting deck sizes, banning cards in deck building, cooperative play, etc. is all in the game now and can be used at any time if desired.
---
Just like Single Player content is a way to test new card designs. There's an insane amount of abilities, hero powers and outright cards from single player contents in the new expansion this time.
---
If you're going to play standard you don't have to worry about old (2+ years) expansions, so you don't have a lot to catch up to. Also, most of the cards of an expansion don't see play, so you only have to worry about getting some cards from older expansions, more specifically the ones you'll need to make your deck, which can be crafted with arcane dust.
---
Can you ever have too many zilliaxes?
---
I'm not so sure it's worth it. Game is over by turn 6 anyway, it's better to have a 1/3 and different hero power on turn 1.
---
THERE IS NO CHOSEN ONE, WE CAN ONLY SAVE OURSELFES
---
Absolutely not.
---
I know. Why couldn't they stick to the entirely consistent buffs-armour-healing-dragons-murlocs-dudes-swarm-otk-handbuff-sometimes murlocs again-secrets-divine shield synergy-mech theme that Paladin has had in previous expansions.
---
Flavor text is :"*This is fine.*"
---
That seems to be Paladins class identity lately. 
---
I am still wondering if they ever print an aoe for Pally again.
---
What's the score?
---
Playing a 3/5 taunt for free isn't losing a card, its tempo. Tyrant wasn't op, but it was really, really good in the right deck.
---
That‚Äôs okay they‚Äôll have it back next game.
---
I have not played in a while although I like to follow what cards come out and I'm just wondering if the dev's have reached a point where the cards they're creating are ones that already exist in old expansion packs or was exclusive to a certain class and has been made available for another class.  
---
It'll be interesting to see if they continue with this as packs rotate out of cycle if they just re-make them again and again.
---
but that dust is mostly acquired through a large amount of double cards which is mostly acquired through packs which are mostly acquired through spending money, is that right?
---
YOU'VE DOOMED US ALL, BETRAYER!
---
Which is irrelevant since this card is clearly meant for a control deck that doesn't care how much health the opponent has. Also, being able to heal the opponent means you can revive Lucentbarks. It *is* power creep. Might be a different class, but that doesn't stop it from being power creep. But we should expect basic and classic set cards to get power creeped. New expansions are supposed to do that.
---
Rogue doesn't get prep either
---
Me too man , they never give us aoe , or something that isn‚Äôt just some weeny garbage. 
---
The last good card was Tarim imo.
---
Sprint doesn't set you back a turn for Leeroy.
---
**#AND SO HEARTHSTONE WAS SAVED!**
---
Exactly how many decks are there?
---
reeeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
You should read the post again, OP is asking for the option to turn it off, not making it mandatory like it was.
---
Druid back boys
---
This doesn't kill Grave Horrors either.
---
The 5/5 and the deal 5 are a ginormous reason why UI was good, though, coupled with cheap removal (spellstone and naturalize) and even more ways to turn the draw 5 into immediate tempo (arcane tyrant). It‚Äôs hard to pay 7 mana for no immediate benefit unless youre able to value trade and get some sick heal value
---
I'm bored from HS righr now I only played 1 game with this deck, in a few days I will post result
---
Agreed; hair color and eyes are way too dark
---
Probably because thats not how bots work.  Manual intervention would be required otherwise the bot doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs making a mistake.
---
5 mana is to much, 4 mana is fair. You just want to nerf the card to oblivion. Which doesnt make sense.
---
Burgerking #1425 NA 80g trade quest. Ill show but youll have to go first

Primitive.
---
Does anyone know what the numbers mean? I assumed they were slight variants on the same theme but after winning Merc 40 v Merc 14 i was told the decks were the same. What do the numbers mean?
---
Well, now I have to downvote you, because "learnt" is indeed the right form of the verb "to learn" in this instance, since it functions as the past participle in the verb phrase "have learnt" - that is, if you're writing British English. You're probably American, since you only use learned. But American English is not the only kind of English in the world, which you should remember before you correct other people's grammar.
---
Depends on how much you play and how much you spend. For me, it'S 50/50. I spend 50‚Ç¨ on the preorder and buy roughly 50 packs with gold each expac. Some  people ¬¥buy both preorder options, some people are f2p. If you are god at arena you can go infinite, meaning that you get more gold out of it than what you spend for the run.
---
Ah, right.
---
Didn‚Äôt realise it was warrior card at first so was about to say ‚Äúsuper easy toggwaggle setup‚Äù
---
Lol again a druid OP
---
I just made a post exactly about this. Played a goofy lucentbark deck and got 4 of them on board. Mage froze my board 5 turns in a row with antonidas on board and just pelted me down with endless fireballs. 
---
Feels shitty
---
here is the deck:
---
[https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1286278-bondage-warrior](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1286278-bondage-warrior)
---
It is quite fun to play but heavily relies on drawing that weapon. I'm playing it at rank 9-8 with roughly 50% WR. Surely someone better can even climb with it.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure lucent will never be good since if it does become good there‚Äôs so much options for all decks to include counters to lucent deathrattle. I think it‚Äôs just doomed to be in an off meta deck.
---
Blizzard hire this person
---
I know it‚Äôs a different class but blizzard just wants to fuck [[sprint]]
---
My point is mainly that you often can't deduce where a person is from simply by their use of English. Most English users don't consciously decide to use British or American English, which is why this mix often occurs - I myself often use American colloquialisms, but "color" just looks plain wrong to me, because I've been taught otherwise since I was 10. Is it wrong of me to write colour, neighbour ect. even if I might "sound" more American in my writing? I don't think it is. If something is perfectly fine grammatically in one of the major types of English, it shouldn't be corrected.
---
Hence why I mentioned that you hopefully can destroy it during your turn. But I admit you probably won't bother playing the card until you actually had a way to sacrifice it in hand anyways, so having it silenced will be quite rare.
---
It shouldn't
---
Do you really think HS devs know this details about WoW?
---
Ok.
---
Fishing for lethal in a tempo list? Dingus.
---
People think that ain't how it be, but it do.
---
what the fuck does this mean
---
A much, much, much better solution: Make it 2 mana and target enemy minions only so it's actually a removal tool. It's just about impossible to make this card balanced when it can target friendly minions unless they can make it so minions preserve the mana cost spend to play them.
---
At 5 mana this is *still* a 5 mana spell to fully heal your 8/8 and summon another. Would a 5 mana 8/8 with Battlecry: Restore a friendly minion to full health sound balanced to you? What if it had 1 charge of Echo, that could be played on future turns?
---
It's still overpowered so long as giants remain in standard.
---
This guy gets it
---
My dad thought this was a joke
---
And it doesn‚Äôt even cost 10 so you can run it in a Spiteful deck
---
It do be like dat.
---
A lot of the grandmaster have spoke about how as the tournament went on they got better at adapting to the format, preparing for their matches and deciding on what decks to bring. 
---
It may not be a huge disadvantage, but it would still feel unfair to me if he was relegated.
---
Wallet Warrior reporting for duty
---
It doesn't die to hard removal, it dies to silence and hard removal. Only poly/hex deal with it cleanly.
---
Renolock before MSG. Love the deck variation.
---
Raza otk priest with velen and shadowreaper anduin
---
patron loved Blood to ichor. Improve morale is basically a reprint.
---
Shouldn't this summon an interdimensional robot from a teenage girl's forehead?
---
I mean, looks at pogo rouge. One of their biggest weakness is no card draw and no healing.
---
# It really yabba dabba do be like that sometimes
---
Well, Lei Shen wanted the Forge.
---
7 mana draw 5...
---
**Druid:** I am healing with water...
---
**Shaman:** What in the cinnamon toast fuck is this? Am I a joke to you?
---
PepeHands here we go again
---
they thought lets make a worse ultimate infestation, but a better sprint
---
No it not,it barely get play in other deck other than giants even with 3 mana.
---
No actually I did mean it to be an ongoing, consistent effect.
---
Spiteful even paladin comes to my mind, I‚Äôve been tinkering with something similar when someone posted that they reached legend with their build (which was obviously way better than mine) 
---
It was around a year ago I think (before the CtA and spiteful nerf)
---
Sebastian#1389 NA  80G Quest Trade I‚Äôll show, but you go first.
---
My guess is the Rogue Quest. A separate developer said that it was really interesting and, seeing how the last Rogue Quest turned out, I think they were focusing a lot on this one.
---
Here se go again
---
I wouldn't have noticed without you pointing it out haha, thanks for that. Awesome indeed
---
There is no chosen one.
---
Hmm, maybe they should have run this one back when the brawl was not on all week yet. We're only up to friday and it could already do with someone pressing the reset button to re-randomise the decks.
---
They makes no sense whatsoever.
---
But we already had grim rally...
---
Gvg/brm/tgt control warrior, tempo mage, and oil rogue. Combo druid was dope too!
---
So MSG Pirate Warrior gets countered by GVG Mech Mage.  A true battle for the ages.
---
Yeah 3 Zilliaxs is nice but have you ever had 3 Lich Kings?
---
It's a two card combo moonfire.
---
Well that *is* the classic centrist move, I'll give you that
---
Speaking of which, when is that exactly?
---
I'm going to say Recruit Hunter, the one with the Seeping Oozelings, Kathrena, and all those big beasts.  It was discovered in the middle of The Witchwood (June '18) and eventually rose to become 10% of the played decks at that time.  It was eventually replaced in the meta by Deathrattle Hunter, but not by me!  No sir!  I played it until most of the key pieces rotated out in April.
---
Honorable mention:  C'thun Druid, Secret/Tempo Mage, Even Paladin, Mech Paladin, Big Priest (stop looking at me like that), Wall Priest, Elemental Tempo Rogue, Hooktusk Rogue, Even Shaman, Dragon Warrior
---
Handlock. Something about getting down to 3 health, playing 2 molten giants and then healing back to full health with Reno and winning was just so appealing.
---
Where you‚Äôve gone completely wrong is in assuming this HAS to be used in a Tempo Warrior deck. This card gives insane value too. You could say this card gives you 4.5-5 mana worth of value, but you‚Äôre paying 3. That is plenty good enough to see use in Control Warrior decks as well. You play universally great cards in decks regardless, and this is a universally great card.
---
It feels like ancient of lore before it was nerfed but even better
---
well not good either
---
they basically find a nice image, they make a title that fits it
---
then they create a stupid power that has nothing to do with it
---
to me, it is just laziness
---
[https://i.imgur.com/1N0UjV3.jpg](Wow...)
---
If you count those wouldnt patron warrior be considered an enrage deck then?
---
No, that's my overall life goal.
---
Indeed.
---
Peace and love to you friend, it's too hot in Europe to be arguing on Reddit.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Not sure if Mech Hunter for example would simply ignore this. 
---
Also this probably almost always goes into a quest deck, wich means it‚Äôs a very poor 2 drop since you didn‚Äôt played anything on turn 1.  It‚Äôs annoying for sure, but also bad if you are behind on board.
---
It's just a 1.5 mana to draw period. See Novice Engineer (off optimal by 3 stat points), Gnomish Inventor, Shiv and Azure Drake. AD actually cheats curve by having spell power at no cost which is why it's so good. Novice Engineer and Shiv both defied the curve at one point and had to be nerfed because of it. To be on-curve Sprint should cost 6 and draw 4. But it's purposly bad because that's not the kinda card they want rogue to run.
---
The Lackey Wars have begun.
---
I think it was changed due to tournaments being playing in friendly matches, and Blizz still not making the tournament mode they promised.
---
Nah. This card is not magnetic. Neither is Mechano-Egg. But you can magnetize things on both of them - just not onto each other.
---
Lol I‚Äôm not trying to argue here, I just commented because I thought you might want to know. I studied formal logic in university, and you‚Äôre just using a word wrong. If you want to keep using it wrong, it‚Äôs no sweat off my back. I was just trying to educate you so you don‚Äôt embarrass yourself. It‚Äôs yours to do with what you will.
---
Sprint is *supposedly* balanced around Prep, but with Prep nerfed it just straight up sucks now.
---
More like ‚ÄúBattlecry: If your deck is all legendary restore 10 health.‚Äù
---
Swipe?
---
You do raise some good points. It certainly depends on how fast the control warrior draws his Dr. Boom, and how fast the rush warrior manages to complete his quest, but I'm still not entirely convinced it's good enough. Warrior has a lot more value cards than just Dr. Boom. The Omega cards do insane amounts of works, and cards like dynomatic can easily clear off most of rush warrior's threats. Even if bomb warrior has a harder time against this deck, I was mostly thinking of regular control warriors anyway (even though they might not be as viable right now), and I think the problem tends to be that you're forced to play 3 Mana 3/3 as threats, since you don't have a lot of cards to rush into. I also think that it you look at other quest decks, it just doesn't seem like quest and tempo are a good match. Having to waste a card AND your turn 1 is pretty bad, and it also doesn't help with the whole running out of gas thing you're referring to. But who knows, maybe quest warrior could be a thing, but we'll have to see whether or not the quest requirements are too steep for a tempo deck.
---
IS this a Penniless Player reference by any chance?
---
Hate being that guy, but as a Rogue main, I'm glad I stopped playing because of stuff like this. Class identity, give me a break
---
How do ye mean OP
---
I really liked both Mecha'Thun Druid and Midrange Hunter with Deathknight Rexxar. Those were the decks that I started the game with.
---
mercenary 280 about to go down in hearthstone history
---
Yogg and load hunter with summoning stone.
---
sure would, at it ran alot of "harm your own minion"-cards
---
I lost to Big Demons 73 or something, which I then beat four or five Mercenaries 280s with before getting taken out again because I didn't draw any of the early token generators it runs.
---
You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs going on about being culturally open minded. I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about that. I‚Äôve lived a lot of places too whoop dee doo. I care about logic and about what is right and wrong 
---
You were wrong initially and somehow you just can‚Äôt accept that. People are allowed to mix and match language however they want. Just because someone was speaking in American English mostly, doesn‚Äôt mean that ‚Äúlearnt‚Äù is wrong.
---
Just learn from your mistake bro and move on.
---
I just play the solo adventures :) no need to have some cool deck when you can have as many cool decks as you want!
---
I would, especially now that enrage isn't even a keyword anymore.
---
if your deck plays battle rage, and takes advantage of self harm effects like whirlwind and ravaging ghoul, you are an enrage deck.
---
No, it just means that some classes are better at some things than others.
---
Whoops. Sorry, I just saw the word mech and the PTSD from every Mech Paladin I ever faced triggered. My mistake.
---
Are you dense? Because of the fact that it's also beneficial to your enemy, you can't play it whenever you want. That's like saying deathwing has no drawback because you could just play it when you get your hand empty.
---
Bro does anyone else see a lava creeper head in the hat as well?
---
If you want to be as reductive as possible then sure its a two card combo moonfire.
---
&gt; requires you to run sac pact though.
---
Which...people do in wild to use on voidcaller.
---
Sacrifical Pact is run in 30% of Wild Warlock decks according to HSReplay, which is a pretty healthy number when you consider that zoo and combo are both popular warlock archetypes as well right now.

---
LOL @ all the newbs who just play the popular decks of every class and have no idea about the potential of certain cards because all you do is copy other decks and switch out a card or two.
---
You say this card pollutes kangors? THINK more please. A deck that doesn't use kangors with just a few mechs? You've never thought about that though cause you are too busy copy / pasting top deck codes from hearthpwn.
---
Trying to compare this card to other cards like master swordsmith probably means you have no idea about paladins. If you have half a brain, you realize how amazing redemption is with divine shield minions. Now please think about redemption and reborn minions. I'll give you an hour. Still nothing? Just wait to copy / paste a deck code with an accompanied youtube video explaining it a week after the expansion like a good little newb.
---
I think it could be interesting to ban the most common deck and all the cards it contains at the end of each day.

You'd probably just end up with a different early flood deck gaining dominance, but maybe not.

Haha, not this time Hitler, we've fallen for your tricks before!
---
Nah. I predict a 12 mana 1/1 with a huge battlecry..
---
Otter fatigue mage.  Not sure on the expansion, but it was pre-standard.   All the freeze, all the good board clears and you basically got as many deathlords as you could and slurped all the minions out of the opponents deck.  Then you played N'zoth and did it again, until you were around 8 cards ahead in fatigue.
---
I love playing lucentbark, but I definitely agree. Too often you just don‚Äôt quite get to your win condition. I would also add that if it WAS super reliable... it would feel super shitty to play against all the time.
---
They should just take the Mercenaries deck out entirely, the first couple of hours were really fun and I came across some interesting decks, while now it takes me several games before I encounter something different than Mercenaries 14
---
This.
---
Dont forget mechathun
---
This works well in a controlling deck which plays small minions.
---
Let's look at the obvious candidates:
---
- zoo wants a board to go face
---
- handlock wants consistent big drops
---
- plot twist wants big deathrattles but if you can pull off a plot twist combo you have won anyway
---
So this requires some buildaround:
---
- Play with Rafaam'd scheme, play all of plot twist/quest/darkest hour to consistently do powerful stuff by turn 7
---
- mid range-y deck that summons tokens with snip-snap, reborn, eggs, lackeys
---
They should let us modify the decks somehow after every loss. Maybe a Bartender Bob type thing.
---
Chickenmaan#1915 trading 80 g quest on Asia. I'll show, you go first. Still available!
---
2 mana weapon justified at 3 mana because of Beast synergy.
---
Synergies are only good because they add value. ‚ÄúDocking‚Äù mana for a card because it provides synergy immediately nullifies that value.
---
There is no reason to replace Hatchet or Eagelhorn in respective decks with this card. 
---
It will be a decent pickup from Hunters Pack, which is in itself a questionable inclusion at this point given Beast and Spell Hunters already strong card generation.
---
i alternate between games usually
---
Issa Hunter weapon though
---
Makes sense with all the reborn effects
---
Good shout on Houndmaster, a card that is very powerful but hasn‚Äôt seen play in a while. And now Midrange Hunter can choose to play Survivor‚Äôs Pack instead of Master‚Äôs Call, allowing them to run powerful non-beasts in their deck while still generating a lot of value
---
In what way? This will see play, that never did.
---
I think folks are sleeping on this card. We‚Äôre losing War Path, which means we‚Äôre going to see Whirlwind return to the meta. This gives Warriors an actually reliable board clear. Brawl has definitely helped more than it‚Äôs screwed me over, but it‚Äôs been hard to run an aggressive deck when I can‚Äôt reliably remove big threats.
---
Yeah it only enables a 0-mana 3/5 taunt, what a rip-off \s
---
The real fix is change it to two minions that cost half as much. Not only does it make more sense but the results are way more unpredictable.
---
Agreed. I ALWAYS look forward to new expansions. It‚Äôs super fun seeing the different cards and theory-crafting. I‚Äôve already taken my fair share of downvotes for saying this, but I‚Äôll say it again: Why do Control Warrior or Cyclone Mage or Mech Hunter care about any of these cards? My gut-feeling says...they don‚Äôt.
---
*Hunter* weapon
---
Ah nice, my "clear everything" warrior just got stronger.
---
Oh darn. I also thought it was Witchwood. Right, it was printed along side the druid recruit cards. Also, I do play wild but Ultimate Infestation is still a card
---
\[\[Piranha Launcher\]\] came back after a vacations on the desert, he lost a few mana and is in a rush right now.
---
Control quest priest with benedictus and chameleos. Such long games. So much stealing. No win condition but outwit, outplay, outlast.
---
That or early Togwaggle Druid, when people weren't expecting it. You'd swap decks permanently and see them mouse over a couple things and sit there in disbelief, then concede.
---
What I'm saying is I want my opponents to suffer.
---
Mine was fatigue mage, during naxxramus and gvg, nothing brought me more joy than watching a hunter cower in fear at my endless army of deathlords
---
Ok senpai..I acknowledge your skill.

Because then they are *alway* there. reprinting allows it to not exist sometimes.

---
And that was paid at game's completion, I assume? If so, yeah, that makes that point less relevant.

when i loose vs cc mage, it feels like i loose vs one single broken card. And cc IS 100% broken, 3 Mana + Twinspell is insane. 
---
you don‚Äôt even have to play good, set up this combo and there are 2 options what happened now:
---
1. Your opponent has an answer  immediately.
---
2. Your Opponent has no answer. The Game is over.

At this point I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre trolling or just really this obnoxious.

---
would you play a card that gave you 1.5 copies of springpaw? the answer is yes. especially since you get to control when and where you swing and create more 1/1s with rush.
---
Yes, however now that i think about it, Houndmaster might not see play still because of how good masters call is.
---
And with ultimate infestation rotating out of standard. If I recall that was the glue that made the mana ramp pay off, because you knew you could have a solid swing turn to reload your hand. 
---
Without it mana ramp is nearly a guaranteed death against aggro

It was run in really early Zoo decks to heal up after trading, but that was with a very small card pool.
---
4 expansions in a row of epic warrior weapons...
---
Classes really don't change that much over time. Plus, Mech Paladin really is not that big brained.
---
I get this is probably a troll post looking at your account age, but this really isn't funny.
---
[Low-res image of token taken from the reveal video.](https://i.imgur.com/f2imCzM.png)
---
It's not bad tho
---
lol i guess sometimes itll be possible you get starving buzzard off hunters pack and this card will make you feel less bad about that
---
A lot of people are sleeping on this, but if springpaws see play as 1/1 rush, a 3 mana, 3 springpaw weapon should see play.
---
Similarly mill/kingsbane rogue was my favorite deck. It would often outright lose to aggro, but against more control oriented decks it was just so satisfying to slowly burn all their resources and their combo pieces and then finish them off with a swing from a massive kingsbane.
---
High rolling / games where it feels like there's absolutely nothing you can do feels bad.  It's sort of the big priest of standard.
---
That and mage's winrate is lower due to unexperienced people playing it generally.  Sort of like how razanduin got nerf, despite a T2 winrate.
---

This must be a joke right?

Any civilized person with a smidget of decency.

Now I see it, thanks

You need the play 3 tavern brawls quest to complete it

In addition to making your Lackeys 4/4s, he also changes all of their effects to Titanic Lackey: https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2019/usgamer/HS-CARD-REVEAL-TITANIC-LACKEY-TPT.png/EG11/resize/640x-1/quality/70
---
Kind of wish the card was more clear...
---
Remember [[Acolyte of Agony]] ?
---
Yeah--shows how trash that card was if they can reprint a neutral version of that type of card now.

3/3/3 | Lifesteal  
---
Vegeta Aryan
---
&gt; This is some auto include in everything but agro.
---
I have a janky OTK deck that relies on summoning two different deathrattle taunt minions that unfortunately I can't put this in because it has taunt.
---
Glinda enables them to play 4 lackeys the turn she comes out with only one generator required.
---
None of the other legendaries are tol'vir, what makes you think this one will be?
---
Yup, that's some filler.
---
I thought it used BtI to activate 1 mana exectue. Summon slime + kill minion for 2 is crazy tempo
---
Hearthstone finally gains Ajani‚Äôs Soulstriker.
---
I actually like that point, well said!
---
Same here, loved that deck. It carried me to my first golden portrait, was gutted when Raza was nerfed.
---
Because Garrosh is a bigger Hero than Rexxar Kappa
---
while principals are important, i would say that what already is manifested in this card is more important right now
---
And yet people try to tell me power creep isn't real...
---
Instead of having more weapons, I'd rather want tutor draw for weapons.
---
as a pally main very dissapointed, only interesting card is sir finley and we will have to see if making a paladin highlander deck is even viable with the card pool paladin have right now.
---
Where does it say that?
---
Legit, that looks like a Magic: The Gathering card
---
You tone seems very pointed right now
---
If you're playing this on T4 using the hunter draw 3 on T3, you've already lost the game. Hunter can't afford to skip a turn like that.
---
Yeh but I think Priest need a new Lackey generator rather than the one they have currently that see‚Äôs no play.
---
Hero power face starting from turn 2! Oh don't forget about the Greater Heal Potion on turn 4!
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. He just got lucky and got 2 titanic lackeys
---
So far, I see little impact to the decks I like to play (Renolock, Tesspionage, Theft Priest), so it all seems like a big 'Meh' to me. Puzzle Box of Yogg Saraon is the only card I'm actually excited about. None of the legendaries have filled me with wonder. Some are solid and will be annoying to face, but they're not exciting.
---
I do like to mess around with Mage, so maybe I'll try Secret Mage, but more likely I'll just try to make the Puzzle Box go off as many times per game as possible.
---
Agreed, It's also a very Warlock-ey card (Great power at a cost) and really should stay in Standard.
---
omg I need to check this out LOL
---
Spirit of the shark + lab recruiter combo can easily fill the deck of it
---
Another warlock one and another neutral one would be neat
---
The Shaman quest is already entirely about battlecries. Do you think they would give Hunter the same thing?
---
It was broken AF, but I absolutely loved the Mysterious Challenger Paladin decks. Whenever you got to play him, would always get this feeling like "lmao this is so busted". Im sure it felt terrible to play against, and so I decided to not play Pirate Warrior at all when it was T1 deck as punishment for myself.
---
At least this dude put the picture on the post rather than us needing to click a link. Always look on the bright side :)
---
I kinda like the idea of Garrosh taking it up the ass though.
---
OMG LOOOOOOOOOOL
---
I like it. It's a nice balance of simple yet useful and that's what makes these Lackeys pretty fun to have in the game.
---
Or a ton of annoy o trons
---
you made my day
---
I could see them not giving another lackey class card to rogue. They can already take such huge advantage of them. But we‚Äôll see
---
If you value trade the lackey won't it be dead before you can eat it?
---
It could be interesting in a self-harm warlock deck. A tempo source of healing in the early game and it‚Äôs demon tagged.
---
I'd be very surprised if there wasn't another lackey generator for all 5 of the evil classes.
---
Shaman and Warrior both have new ones, and I don't see why they'd be asymmetrical with those.
---
... as for if it's playable or not is another matter.
---
Deadpan comedy. I like it. &lt;3
---
I mean it‚Äôs aggressively costed for the stats.  Put him in a zoo deck and beat face
---
LOL "Dark Pharaoh"
---
They could just give them a bad one like they did for Priest and Warrior last set.
---
You don't
---
Yea it‚Äôs much better vs Aggro than anything else, and definitely better than a vanilla 3/2/3 vs Aggro. But in either case, at 3 mana it‚Äôs just too slow to be good vs any respectable aggro deck.
---
Hunter already has pretty bad tempo 1 and 2 drops. It can‚Äôt afford bad tempo on 3 as well and expect to not get rolled by aggro.
---
The one case it might be decent is against Lackey Rogue, but again, at 3 mana, it‚Äôs just really slow and I think it‚Äôs too risky to give Rogue that much tempo waiting for this thing to pay off.
---
It seems like it‚Äôs be so bad
---
You dont.
---
Yeah, they're "native" to argus
---
Too much variance.  A 3/2 deal 2 is maybe 3.5 mana at best.  Also what warlock deck would run it at the moment?  Zoo?
---
Priest: Blizzard, why hurt me, why...
---
Extremely good card. I assume the Locust is a beast so all the usual synergies apply. Really really good.
---
Polluting lackey pool
---
That‚Äôs the 1 new lackey this expansion! Why are people not flooding the sub with this yet??
---
There's that one Paladin 7 cost 1/1 that recasts spells on herself. [[Lynessa Sunsorrow]] maybe?
---
Example: You have a 4/4 Lackey, opponent has a 3/4, you kill it with your Lackey and then eat the Lackey to get a 5/5.
---

---
7/1/1 | Battlecry: Cast each spell you cast on your minions this game on this one.  
---
Could be twofold:
---
1) in an aggressive/midrange deck that is hoping to burn your opponent out before they have a chance to fully utilize the discount
---
2) could find its way into a control deck. Say you are holding onto a sweet board clear, but you want your opponent to overcommit to the board using the new discount you gave them. They dump their hand, you kill it all with a well-timed earthquake
---
...all this being said, I don‚Äôt think this card will see any play
---
All of the ‚Äòevil‚Äô classes got a tol‚Äôvir as their legendary minion except Warrior and Rogue. But Rogue‚Äôs legendary minion is WoW lore-inspired anyway. Shaman is an ‚Äòevil‚Äô class and the last one without a legendary minion revealed.
---
This comment is actually genius.   Take my upvote
---
A sometimes arena pick at best
---
Oh I thought you were talking about the 1/1 earlier in the game for some reason. That makes sense.
---
value trade means that you make a trade in which your minion survives but the oponents dies
---
This is really about Prep. Rogue is in a bad, bad state.
---
will this be in the pool of lackeys you add to your hand? if so, thats decent. would never add this to a deck independently. also, i hope they add more minions like this in general, that serve some sort of purpose even if small, rather than more vanilla pack filler.
---
It‚Äôs unity, precision, perfection for a reason
---
Every night in my dreams
---
I see you, I feel you

Odd mage and Spellhunter.
---
Idk with the advent of zoo priest, or so it seems with the cards spoiled, I could see EVIL conscripter being played.
---
Man I actually forgot priest had a lackey generator
---
I like this a lot. Zoolock is getting tons of attention with Uldum. 1 mana 4/4 starting at turn 4 with coin/turn 5 is very good, and it makes your lackeys more impactful on later topdecking. 
---
Mage, Warlock and Druid seem to be the three classes I'll focus on the most this set.
---
It's such a tempo loss tho
---
And the main warlock that uses lackeys is Zoolock
---
Do you want this on Zoolock?  
---
Can you run this on Zoolock?
---
I feel like this is a slightlybetter [[Mistcaller]] but [[Mistcaller]] sucked ass so...

6/4/4 | Battlecry: Give all minions in your hand and deck +1/+1.  
---
&gt; All of the ‚Äòevil‚Äô classes got a tol‚Äôvir as their legendary minion except Warrior and Rogue.
---
50% doesn't make a rule.
---
sounds cool but too complicated to likely actually happen.
---
I guess I can see how I didn't state that clearly, I'll try to correct it
---
Is rogue rogue anymore? I think rogue is done.
---
I would not sleep on this card. Lifesteal is a very strong effect.
---
A little off meta, but I've been playing a Warlock deck posted here the other day that could Sea Giant + Shadowflame.
---
Idk Snip Snap is a very powerful card and it makes your Zilliaxes better.
---
That's brilliant. I love it.
---
I really liked The Grand Tournament one, even though it wasn't the hottest set.
---
"... there's even pirates riding parrooooootsss...."
---
Snip Snap is pretty good tempo.
---
That's a bad strategy anyway, warrior had sparring partner for 2 years and never used that actually reliable combo. This would be random chance.
---
meanwhile, lethal with second roar... SMH
---
Considering Zoo just auto loses to a conjurers calling this will 100% go into that deck.
---
It's the same guy posting all card reveals, he isn't short on karma
---
Quest Rogue Lackeys but in Warlock.
---
I don't care what anyone says, actually playing this deck was great. Plus it meant you could one-shot Jade Druids. At the time that was all I wanted to do in life.
---
If a hunter has the secret that plays a 4/2 cat when you cast a spell, and you play flame strike or something similar, does the cat spawn first and die or second and live?
---
Not being a smart ass, I actually dont know. Just saying there is a way to test this if anyone wants to.
---
Overflow: *exists*
---
Sprint: "Am I a joke to you??"
---
What if Sargeras yells "Enough!" stunning all the Titans and Illidan long enough to make his getaway?
---
True, since lackies are a 3 expac deal. Cant put too many in each
---
The spell itself is fine. Giants are and always have been the problem.
---
I was under the impression that was supposed to be the card that was revealed in that sand event thing. But that card didn't seem overly complicated so I probably misunderstood.
---
&gt; Rogue‚Äôs legendary minion is WoW lore-inspired anyway. 
---
I've never played wow but I like to look at the lore connections between it and Hearthstone but I can't find anything on Anka. Could you link me something if you get the chance? I'm loving reading about the WoW lore and this expansion is really interesting.
---
you don't
---
\#RememberThousandNeedles
---
Maybe you should leave your gaming basement once in a while.
---
really killer with weapons buffs great card
---
Tavern Brawls are different every weak...
---
It's not always just choose a class, get a semi-random or pre-constructed deck...
---
Plus, monthly rank resets are preferable to yearly, especially with the down four ranks system instead of the everyone's around rank eighteen system the game used to have.
---
Odd Mage. I loved how it was a control deck that achieved its goal more through pressure than stalling tactics, it actually fought for board control the whole time which was awesome. It made every game feel like I was playing against my opponent, rather than my luck of the draw.
---
In terms of card advantage, I'd argue an 8-mana 4/8 killing two 4 mana 4/4s _is_ a value trade overall, because you dealt with two of an opponent's cards with one of your own. 
---
I'd definitely classify killing the first 4/4 with your 4/8 as a value trade, but using your remaining 4/4 to kill the second 4/4 seems more of an even trade (rather than a value trade) though. Not nearly as valuable as a trade because you're killing your own creature in the process, but a trade nonetheless.
---
That's the point. That deck would obviously lose so it gets removed from the pool. With the algorithm there's really no testing needed. We know which of their pushed archetypes are the strongest.
---
Token druid has a low win rate in higher ranks because there are more mages. Play around the sea giant costs. You dont need a full board to kill a mage with savage roar. The only taunts are images and zilliax.
---
50% damage + healing increase &gt; 50% mana increase
---
The fact the card sucked is because it was a priest card. Priest doesn't care about lifesteal cause they can heal themselves.
---
&gt; they may not have hit a 4 patches deck in testing
---
I think many of us went into the event with the assumption that these decks would follow the regular deck-building rules, i.e. only one copy of any Legendary. 
---
If they're gonna break that rule for one deck, why not every deck?  why not have a Murloc decks with like 10x each of Grimscale Oracle, Bluegill Warrior and Murloc Warleader.  aggro AF, no spells or anything else, just go face every turn
---
a 5 mana sprint with prep would be "draw 2 cards for 3 mana"
---
absolutely insane!
---
Many cards are bad. Millhouse mana storm has a similar downside and is completely unplayable. This card is also completely unplayable
---
I want to build a deck for every quest I get - quests are fun. 
---
Also I want to try a gimmicky shaman totem/mech deck with that new weapon.
---
You can just turn down your screen brightness if it really is somehow an issue.
---
I'd like to know is this collectable or just a random lackey
---
Is there an aggro problem in Hearthstone?
---
I'm coming from MTG where even in Standard aggro decks can win within 4 or 5 turns, and that gets lowered to 2 or 3 in Modern. I feel like even when I play super aggro decks in HS I never win before turn 5. So I'm not sure what the aggro issue is.
---
So is killing a 1/1 with an 8/8 a value trade? That doesn't make sense. It's never used that way.
---
I loved the more midrange demon zoo decks (that had high end like Dr Boom and Mal'ganis). Wasn't braindead to pilot and relied a lot on fundamentals like positioning and trading. That or Raza Priest, because it was the shit.
---
"Reducing the power between aggro and slower decks" well I guess there won't be a gap if one of the two doesn't even exist.
---
Wow, they nerfed the lackey pool.
---
And no, before you ask, this is worse than most lackey. Why? It's pretty simple, on equal power, the is a passive lackey, whereas the good lackeys we have are active lackeys.
---
- Kobold Lackey: deal 2 damage (active lackey)
---
- Ethereal Lackey: discover a spell, which you know are pretty good comeback mechanism. ( active lackey)
---
- Goblin lackey: give a minion 1 attack and rush. It allows you to make trades, whether you're from behind or you're ahead. ( active lackey)
---
- Witchy Lackey: evolve a minion. (Passive lackey) but it gives them a lot more stats AND it has the potential to give you lethal out of no where.
---
- Faceless Lackey: summon a random 2 drop. (Passive lackey) it puts stats on board, but unlike witchy lackey, it's stat that gives your opponent t pretty good value trades. Doesn't help you come back from behind.
---
Given the nature of this Tavern brawl, one would end up being the strongest from the start.
---
it's like easily 0.5-1 mana worse than scraphound because scraphound is a mech and gives armor. So buffs are way easier and armor is never bad, while healing is wasted
---
Just like my shield, for.
---
What about trading first and then using EVIL Recruiter? Double value Pog
---
You can‚Äôt legitimately argue this card would be *too strong* if it could target enemy minions. Pulling an enemy minion out of taunt protection is rarely useful since it only matters if you have minions on board AND you‚Äôre still giving it the +2 health bonus AND you‚Äôre using a lackey you could have used on your own minions. The opportunity cost is too big for such a mediocre and niche advantage.
---
Even if Priests could reliably generate Lackeys, this is still a 1/5 generate, hardly enough to pull reliably.  Probably more useful in something like Zoolock to protect your Carpet or other minions.
---
How so? There's enough people playing that stronger decks would be entering the pool constantly.
---
The first week of witchwood I crafted the deck and had the most fun ever in hearthstone, I cackled all the way to the bank while playing that
---
This card is artwise my favorite of the set so far. That design is really beautiful.
---
I'd like to see them do a complete reset and see if the end result is any different, or if we just wind up with Mercs 280 again.
---
You guys don't think it makes logical sense that Blizzard didn't want it's league players to compete with them for viewers?
---
Really?
---
C'mon.
---
Plague of Healing ü§î
---
You can whisper ‚Äú*We must protect the Sunwell*‚Äù while you play it
---
Obviously an 8/8 attacking a 1/1 isn't (often) going to be a value trade because you have to consider everything else you could attack (like face), but in some situations there is some inherent value in dealing with a 1/1 without having to use a card (spell, weapon, trading another minion with 1 health, etc) and having an 8/7 left over that can then provide additional value.
---
Thanks for the explanation :)
---
EVIL conscriptor isn‚Äôt a bad card, it‚Äôd be insane in basically any other class
---
Warlock desperately needs healing. Something with Lifesteal and demon synergy might see play if we have a deck that values both.
---
But would you play a 3 Mana 3/3 rush minion that equips candleshot? It's closer then you think. It's just the 3 slot for Hunter is always a little full, but I think it will see play
---
It's meant to be an aggro card, that said it's prob not very viable.
---
Classic drops on August 27th.
---
1/2 that summons a 1/1&gt; a 1/3 especially with the effect. Probably still doesnt go in a slower mech deck.
---
Isn't anyone gonna mention that this is a healing card with water, and that is SHAMAN that heals with water not fucking DRUID?
---
Could it be that this "Enrage" is that old Hearthstone mechanic that was used on a small number of old minions that functioned in the manner "when this minion is damaged..." which was deemed to be too confusing for new Hearthstone players by Blizzard and got renamed by Blizzard to "when this minion is damaged", a move met with hostility and eventual placidity by the general Hearthstone community for being overly *verbose?*
---
Not necessarily. Pretty quickly something resembling one of the mercenary decks with four or more Patches and a good handful of other pirates would pop up, leading us to exactly where we are now except with on average worse decks.
---
Also dont forget we will be getting 2 new sets of lackey's. Id be suprised if theres not a lackey that adds a lackey to your hand at some point
---
Yes drawing 1 cost cards and reducing their cost to 0.... no i dont think so
---
Too bad the card itself is extremely lame
---
Nerfed Hunter? That tier 2 deck that is worse than Rogue, Mage, or Warrior?
---
Three. Take it or leave it.
---
Mimiron Mage - Journey to Un'goro 
---
I've seen that animation, sooooo many times now...
---
(The variations of this deck now with all of the cards now is also great, so definitely feel it is a lot better now... so I still play it quite a bit)
---
I added you. 
---
We will fight.
---
Why are you linking that subreddit? I‚Äôll have you know r/hearthstonecirclejerk is a very serious competitive hearthstone subreddit
---
I don't see why tempo bomb warrior can't happen.  
---
"Gee, it'd be a shame if I just... copied this Augmented Elekk so I can... copy these bombs... while I hit your face with a ton of lackeys and actual minions."  
---
To me it makes bomb warrior more dangerous when he's actually attacking your face instead of trying to sit back and wait for bombs to be drawn. Get down to 10 hp from aggro minions and all of a sudden those 6 bombs in your deck are a huge problem.
---
5 mana 4/4 that gives 6+ minions in your hand, in your deck,  and already on board, that you are happy to play as 1/1s because their battlecry effects are great, +3/+3.
---
Seems like another good mid-game tempo swing that warlock needs. Lackeys that are 1/1s can already provide a tempo swing.
---
It's also going to create a few very powerful and very memey arena drafts when it hits the generators.
---
Glinda + 4/4 spell lackey almost sounds playable.
---
The weapon can poke down some early threats from token decks, and the lackeys can help compete for board control. The 'discover a spell' lackey can help warrior in control matchups by discovering value spells such as brawl, omega assembly, warpath, execute, or any of the new warrior spells.
---
That shit felt dirty, but *damn* it was good. 
---
I feel that way playing Secret Mage in Wild today.
---
You could do evenlock in wild if it weren‚Äôt for elekk
---
I was wondering if only uldum cards could summon this one or if old lackey generators could also get it.
---
Paladin has around 4 dragon synergy cards. That‚Äôs counting wild. Nowhere near enough support for that deck to exist
---
None of your business!
---
A card with "Titanic" in the name shouldn't be a 1/1, imo.
---
Alright but you should realize the things people are complaining about don't conflict. 
---
The designers are forcing archetypes (super obvious in the Quest) but then not providing enough support for any of those archetypes. So you end up with a bunch of cards that are unexciting due to how mediocre they are.
---
Ok mb, I didn‚Äôt know. But Kripp‚Äôa opponents will still play at least 2 in every game.
---
This is a very serious competitive post, it deserves to be there.
---
All of the other lackey generators make evil miscreant look insane. Since when is a combo activated ability supposed to be more powerful than an equivalent deathrattle? I can't believe it used to be a 1/5 too.
---
Doesn't Zoo already play lackeys?
---
Well, my mech pally isn't an odd deck. Hence why I'd try this card out if I opened it.  
---
Hell my deck isn't really optimized, I just find it fun and it wins(*hence the climb to rank 4 so far*), so I don't mess with it too much. Hence why I'd try this card out if I got the chance, since it's a win more card, it's sticky, and above all, it's a *cheap* mech.
---
Old school Miracle Rogue. I'll always have a soft spot for that deck.
---
Out of the loop: how did they nerf Kingsbane?
---
I'd have to say per class.
---
Warlock - Reno Lock (I actually got to my highest rank with this deck, 5.)
---
Mage - Exodia Mage
---
Hunter - Spell Hunter (with Zul'jin + the legendary weapon)
---
Priest - Deathrattle Quest Priest
---
Druid - Jade Druid
---
Shaman - Evolve Shaman
---
Rogue - Miracle Rogue
---
Warrior - Bomb Warrior
---
Paladin - Secret / Christmas Tree Paladin
---
Okay, I'm gonna put it simple for ya:
---
[This one sparks joy.](https://youtu.be/qlHx7YNWYGY)
---
[This one does not spark joy.](https://youtu.be/MG3nb7Oam4k)
---
&lt;/circlerejk&gt;
---
Of course they can, but at that point I think they found a really nice recipe that brings new players from ads on yt that are not instantly skipped, keeps players hyped up and gets much more views because of replayabilty.
---
Also this songs are dope and every trailer without one is a reason to mourn.
---
The video is totally worth it, 10/10.
---
Jokes appart 'Miniature' should be a visible enchantment.
---
This will make players less confused when they silence a minion and gets full stats again.
---
Waaaah golden legendary!
---
&gt;So basically a 2/3 weapon for 3 with some additional flexibility?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This adds a ton of flexibility. Wayyy better than a 2/3 weapon.   
---
&gt;It's worse than a 2/3 at SMOrcing, but I think that's about it.   
---
&gt;Or against lifesteal taunt mineurs   
---
&gt;Also worse against stuff like Acolyte of Pain and other "on damage" effects 
---
Those are the comments I see that were posted prior to yours... literally no mention of beasts. Pretty sure we were just comparing Desert Spear with other weapons as a whole.
---
So this is kind of like if piranha launcher didn‚Äôt blow
---
I think the problem is that people expect any small synergy to be supported enough for solid deck, but not every needs to be relevant in the meta. Some people want to play off-meta decks, some people want to play Wild, some archetypes get additional support later. Not everything needs to be supported in the same way or to the same extent all at once.
---
I'm hoping this archetype can make Glinda worthwhile. Generating a 3/7 and 4 4/4s with awesome effects using 2 cards simply sounds fun.
---
I believe Anka is a new character to Hearthstone, But is heavily inspired by the crypts and such lying beneath Uldum.
---
Agreed.
---
Any deck that runs this card also runs execute.  But this is essentially a 3rd and 4th copy (of execute) with potential upside against a really wide board.
---
Ew
---
I'd put you in charge of editing text for the entire guild üòÇ
---
Yup that‚Äôs a mistake you only make once
---
Well the reason is because to combo it early, you need a 0 mana card. The problem, coin greatly helps this.
---
I honestly think the coin should have an effect that states (this card can only give mana and does not trigger any other game abilities). It should be a neutral card that only allows for catching up because you are going second. But nowadays there are many cards that just benefit from going second. It is kinda lame.
---
Other than that, I think 2 lackeys for a combo is fair. But I think other classes should have gotten 2 lackey generators as well. Warrior needs a better one as well. It's cool they got the weapon, but the other card is really bad.
---
It has more than that in Standard alone. You can build a fun off-meta Dragon Paladin in Standard in you want.
---
Look at that lad, doing a merry jig on his foe's offscreen, defeated corpse.
---
My two cents: it seems to me that Blizzard is trying to push Control Hunter.
---
The only thing needed to have a nice Control Hunter is another hero power.
---
I also think that the quest will be secret related.
---
I only ever played it when I went double deathrattle priest in the dalaran heist.  I tried it once in arena and was like "wtf, where is the other lackey?"
---
Agreed, needs to be 2 lackeys or priest lackey synergy is dead in the water
---
Also Glinda.

I feel like they are too scared of Paladin having a tier 1 deck again so they are doing everything in their power to prevent paladins from being competitive in the meta. They probably just don‚Äôt want another odd Paladin yet, which I can kind of understand, but it‚Äôs kinda disappointing to us Paladin mains. Or at least it would be, but I play WILD, THE SUPERIOR FORMAT
---
Cubelock and Patron Warrior
---
&gt;catched
---
Hmmm, a repost.
---
Anti synergy with Recruiter AND Evil Geniu
---
Good catch!
---
I love every flavor of combo druid starting with malygos druid in kobalds + catacombs when it was still a meme, and Hunter really farmed druid with all those 5/5s
---
loe/wotog wallet warrior with elise
---
I'd rather aggro be strong enough to compete with control, combo, and midrange than for it not to.
---
If lackey zoo becomes a thing, can we call it Lockey?
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk wants to know your location
---
Dear lord I have been blind.... Thank you for that haha
---
Yes actually, that‚Äôs literally how the counter works, so if it‚Äôs not bugged, then 54 times yeah.  If two of the same deck get matched against each other, it doesn‚Äôt change though.
---
I was virtually guaranteed to win with my hand and board presence. Played Yogg for giggles. Wiped my board and my hand lmfao

5/-/- | Deal 2 damage to a character. If that kills it, summon a random Demon.  
---
It‚Äôs a better psychmellon that heals!
---
Fuck yeah. Slamming down a justicar and tanking up until that fat elise pack. Its why I was so excited for baku, but odd control warrior didn't end up being nearly as satisfying to play.
---
But all the decks did.
---
I play a similar deck in wild still that I love. Too bad it gets rolled hard by big priest.
---
Just completed my first heist on normal and annihilated khadgar with these monsters. it was a blast and i was wondering if a turn 5 lethal is something special here.

Bittertide hydra got played in warrior and hunter. The point is over statted minions NEVER get played if they give your opponent tempo because then you lose the benefit of an over statted minion.
---
A deck called damaged 3101 is a perfect counter for 280, it got two whirlwind and two ghouls and a frost warrior.
---
In Wild: Reno Mage, still, I just love it. In Standard, when Witchwood enabled Hadronox, with Master Oakheart. I play it in wild sometimes still, but the one I play isn't very strong. The deck I wish for the most is a working Reno N'Zoth Deathrattle Shaman, though!
---
I'm brating Merc 280 with Robotic + Small Army 19.
---
2 Zilliax and Kangors.
---
It‚Äôs a PW:S that only ever draws a wisp
---
Anecdotal experience is not evidence, and discussion of "ideal draws" is irrelevant when talking about winrate.
---
The data shows that the player going first is favored in most matchups.
---
It would be the first time a 10 mana "do nothing this turn" was played, that's for sure.
---
Look how they butchered my mount in wow
---
It doesn't have charge so they'll get a turn with the discount, which usually is too much.
---
I haven't seen or played quest rogue in a while.  Are those cards now run in the much weaker new iterations post 2nd nerf?  OG quest rogue wasn't getting to turn 7, nonetheless 10.
---
Hearthstone hipster checking in with Molten Giant Warsong Commander Charge Warrior from the beta.  The mirror matches of that deck were always a strange balancing act of having little enough health that you could combo your opponent but not so little they could kill you.  It was my very first combo deck so it holds a special place in my heart.
---
this slows it down a lot, which isn't bad
---
Paladins new identity is instanly losing to warpath and dynomatic.
---
What is so hard to understand about card games designing cards for different people? Just because you don't like playing that way doesn't mean others feel the same way.
---
You also don't need to completely destroy your own board. Yeah, Unwilling Sacrifice never saw real play as it is expensive, but a whole board, especially when it is wider than your opponent's, is a very high cost to pay.
---
They are overall incomparable.
---
Plus, if there's any deck that'll play this, it isn't Zoo Warlock.
---
IIRC they said Rogue wouldn't be getting another lackey generator because of Heist Baron Togg
---
LIGHT THE PYRES.
---
Nah it's awful in arena. Cards like Solider of Fortune are good because you gain a ton of tempo by playing a 4 mana 5/6 and the downside comes later, this card loses all the tempo it could possibly create by frontloading the negative effect which actually most likely gives your opponent more tempo than you gain.
---
Yeah I agree with you and I believe you can even afford to run the scheme even in a zoo deck just because the combo is so strong.
---
Plus sometimes the scheme is ok on its own, maybe even with a knife jugglerü§î
---
Shoutout to Chains of Mephistopheles for winning the ‚Äúmy playgroup has no fucking clue how this actually works‚Äù award.
---
Pretty sure this post is a meme submission...
---
That out of the way, MERC 280 ARMY! LIGHT THE PYRES.
---
\#Velhomestre1496 I show. You go first. NA
---
Druid confirmed better than rogue
---
I don‚Äôt understand how they just type stuff for the card text. You‚Äôd think they would have a dictionary with actual lines of code that correspond to strings, so the card text is generated based on what it does...
---
Molten Giant Warlock in season 1 of hearthstone. Fill your hand, let your hero get cut down to nearly dead. Drop giants for free, give them taunt. Faceless manipulator. Glory days of basic/classic set standard play.
---
yeah I‚Äôm unfortunately kinda disappointed so far.
---
Rafaam's Scheme is not a card Zoo Warlock would want to play in any way at this point. Magic Carpet can't do anything with the Imps, and it takes four turns for the card to become decent.
---
Magic Carpet itself is a much better tool for Zoo to deal with boards wider than it has too.
---
Drowns to... life?
---
Back in the eighties...
---
If you concede, do you get opponents deck to?
---
Maybe summon X different beats?
---
the problem for me is that there isn't really cards to build deck around, there are just some archetypes and lets say 10 cards which fit that archetype.
---
Nah i dont see anything game changing here. I mean this expansion is as  you Said game changing. We have even more archetypes. If thats not game changing then i really dont know what op thinks is game changing
---
How about Nozari? A control card on par with Reno Jackson, given to the class with some of the weakest, most expensive control tools. This card doesn‚Äôt make any sense in paladin, because the decks it belongs to are so weak that you can‚Äôt justify running them aside from memes.
---
If his twin brother is also a 10 mana 10/10 then I am not sure mage can be stopped.
---
They did change the mosh'og or whatever they were called
---
Am I the only one facing and playing merc 14 rather than merc 280??
---
wow never seen this before
---
That's kind of a stretch. For one you need Glinda, otherwise, you also can only play 4 lackeys. Plus, you don't really care about the summoning, evolve, or taunt lackes.
---
I agree with no new archetypes but they are adding lots of versatility to the archetypes that do exist which I think is better since the old decks will still be strong, these new cards just force you to build your decks in more interesting ways. Warlock with more versatility in both zoo, demon and plot. Mage with spells or secrets, murloc getting more morlocks, the new cards add a degree of synergy that wasnt here until these cards were revealed.
---
Boring card
---
New to this sub, sorry if it‚Äôs a common post.
---
are you playing my account?
---
How aren't cards like Anka, the Burried, most of the quests, Desert Obelisk, and Elise the Enlightened not cards to build around?
---
Done with Celios#1245

Iron and Steel 180, 4-0 against non insta concede 280s.
