I'd like to see the study on that.

Also, a computer can do millions of calculations at once, so...

You can't just believe something because it barely matters. People could just go around accusing them of stupid stuff, like /u/LetsHaveTon2 enjoys sniffing feet. 
---
True, but a lot of people like to play off meta decks too. Additionally in best of X you have to play other decks. That makes it so you won’t run into the same thing every game. It makes you have to be good with more than one deck to do well.

Yep, you can lose games from full health in a single turn because "Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive”

Back in the day, HS drama was something greater. MagicAmy was proper HS drama. Scamaz was HS drama. Reynad calling out ViciousSyndicate for being a "worse" meta report than the MagicAmy report based on no factual evidence whatsoever was... well, that was just Reynad being Reynad, but still more entertaining than anything going on in the Hearthstone community today.

/r/competitivehs is slowly becoming a desert with a few good posts a month, and /r/hearthstone has become a poor parody of /r/hearthstonecirclejerk – one or two years ago, /r/hearthstone was at least ahead in the circlejerk meta but this time is now long gone.

TL;DR: ded gaem

I don't think I could see them selling them individually, but I could see them selling them as the "Troll Champions" bundle or something like that. Same with the Witchwood characters. Considering that individual heroes are pretty expensive, I bet that it would be fairly cost prohibitive though.
---
I suspect one reason that they don't do this is because as with Mecha-Jaraxxus, they can use hero portraits as exclusives in the pricier pre-orders. Maybe if they find something else to make pre-orders more appealing, then they won't mind saturating the store with more characters for sale?

Ugh. You're spot on there. I have been completely sucked into it. What's worse is I know I've got an addiction, but I still get sucked in every time.
---
Time for Grabulfund's Odd "Black Beans" Shaman with the spell damage package.
---
If only you were as bright as you are angry :(
---
idk what your problem is. if you send $50 an expansion, by disenchanting the right cards, not playing wild (honestly, stuff wild but &lt;3 dane), and playing 4 of 9 classes instead of all of them, i get every card i want for standard. i've never had a problem with their pack purchasing to dust ratio, nor their reward system. hell, i haven't been buying anything but ultra value bundles for the last 2 years and by completing dailies i have more than enough.
---
so long as you're capable of making decisions as to disenchanting what you don't like, and playing what you do like, you'll see you have plenty enough to experiment and have fun outside of exactly 30 cards for some stupid meta deck.
---
50 dollars should absolutely not give you access to all 9 classes at full power. honestly i think the game's economy is exceptionally well thought out and fair. i've never been partial to these types of posts. 
---
f2p if done right should at least gain access to all the important/relevant cards of 1 full class, though i can't confirm this. people need to stop pretending they're kripp, noodle or kibler. these people spend thousands.
---
&gt; My main concern is that these cards do not support fun gameplay they focus more on building decks that are fairly straight forward (which can be good) but also result in very repetitive gameplay and do not make each game feel like a new and exciting experience
---
Because non genn/baku decks are different...
---
Cause he fights for his friends?
---
Inappropriate, kids can see this.
---
2/20 is a third
---
Actually, I have a hearthstone addiction. I have to work really hard to keep a lid on it, and quite often I fail and end up spending way more than I can afford. More cards never sates the desire for more cards. 
---
How am I white knighting? I'm just not seeing any real proof about MagicAmy not being realy. There might be, but it's not here.
---
I used to hate Big Priest, but now I love playing versus it. What's your class and are you playing Wild?
---
Why don't you actually try playing combo against aggro or even Midrange?
---
Even then, other card games can be just as bad. MTG has two card infinite combos, sometimes even in Standard, the card Armageddon Knight was capable of starting thirty plus step play sequences in Yugioh, and as far as I am aware (I could be wrong), EX Pokemon haven't been doing the best things for the Pokemon TCG since their inception.
---
the very last thing i wan't is a midrange curvestone meta. 
---
The price of having a complete collection for standard ranked play not being a joke. 
---
Yeah im curious 6
---
Wow you defend a culture that kill gays and treat women as property.
---
It's free? I haven't spent a dollar in the past 3 years I've played. 
---
Wait.... that totem isnt supposed to have a murlock head..
---
Can I say something real quick?
---
FUCK YOU, TOKI.
---
F2P players should be able to have a bigger collection. This has been a problem with Hearthstone for a while now. I used to play Hearthstone a lot but it’s deteriorated to the point where I don’t find interest anymore because I don’t have the decks. And I’m not just some rank 20 scrub either. I’ve finished high legend multiple times in both formats and also qualified for the wild open recently. I’ve done my quests religiously for the past year, and it just gets to the point where opening a single rare each pack gets tired.
---
His hand was full and he had no board, what else would he use branching paths for?
---
&gt;What I'd really like to see is some sort of overdraft system - maybe draft 33-35 cards but only keep 30
---
oh that would be really nice. draft mulligans. would have a big impact on the floor and ceiling of deck strengths. 
---
Not wrong, but this was true for Kobolds and Cheating.
---
This expansion? Not so much. Things are more fair.
---
The cheating side comes from Witchwood and Boomsday.
---
" Hey guys, we thought that there weren't enough anti-control decks. So we designed 6 combo decks for Boomsday alone. Oh BTW, we also pushed OTK Paladin and Kingsbane in Rastakhan's Rumble. You're welcome"

It’s their art tho... no gov or authority is forcing them to change it. 
---
Probably not the most helpful, but it just needs to be fun again.  I do Daily Quests to save for the next set but Hearthstone feels more like work.  When I started, I couldn't stop playing the game and now I just get frustrated playing and stop.
---
* Wild used to be a place to go where things were different and I could wait out a bad Standard set.  But s soon as I get hooked on Wild, Standard changes gut it for no reason.  (Mana Wyrm, Wild Growth, Nourish)
---
* If I'm getting beat by a deck, I want to go to my collection and find/craft a solution.  You can't outvalue things like Rexxar or stop an OTK/Combo deck.  There doesn't feel like any real agency to deckbuilding/teching.
---
* I'll be back for one last hoorah come April but if it's not fun, that's my exit point after 5+ years.  
---
Might want to wait for rotation. It only really works well in Odd, Elemental, or Frost Lich based decks which might not survive rotation. 
---
I don’t get it
---
Sully coulda made it to an airport
---
Literally unplayable
---
Or they could make it a snake, y'know?
---
This clears up nothing
---
Yes Paladin 
---
There's usually at least one new ramp tool per set. Some like MSoG have two.
---
Wild Growth and Nourish were changed not because Team 5 doesn't like ramp effect anymore but because Druid from the very beginning has typically played both cards in just about every deck that can.
---
Druid as a class has been having a hard time not just playing the same twenty cards in all of its decks. That is why it has in part been on the receiving end of so many classic and basic card changes.
---
There's bound to be ramp cards in future expansions. It's a core part of the class' mechanical identity.  Cards like Wild Growth, Fiery War Axe, Mana Wyrm, etc. would be fine in their original form if they just weren't a permanent part of Standard. I don't agree with how Blizzard decided to handle that problem, but my point is that I think we could easily see ramp cards in the future that are very close to Wild Growth's power level.

---
TLDR: Make Hearthstone better.  Literally!  
---
  
---
**Stop being afraid of making bad cards better.**  You know which cards see no or nearly no play.  Why not buff them, even a little, to add more experimentation to decks?  There are hundreds of cards to choose from.  
---
**Stop intentionally making bad cards.**  Don't playfully make bad cards with the pretense that people might maybe find ways to use them.  
---
**Don't stop supporting an archetype just because it failed once or twice.**  For example, it seemed like you put a lot into trying to make Moorabi work with support cards and it failed.  Then it seemed like maybe you tried again once or twice with later expansions but then for some reason gave up.  With one or two decent freeze cards (like, say, "Freeze Rush minions when played"), Moorabi could have been a fun meta deck.  But it feels like you just gave up on the entire package.
---
The same argument could be said about this change: It feels unnecessary.

Stop ruining this game with poor balance, small pool of viable cards leads to very boring game...
---
Tons of card need buffs, stop destroying classic cards.
---
Don't you guys have ideas?
---
&gt;you seem to not take into account that you can turn dust into the cards you want.
---
I explicitly take this into account by considering everything in terms of dust.  If you're buying packs for the dust content, then I can't fault you.  As I said, I think most people buy packs because "maybe I'll get the cards I need", and I don't think that is a good reason to buy packs--a more valid reason is "maybe I'll get the dust I need, and a couple cards", like you're doing.
---
If you don't do quests, this also lowers the amount of free stuff you get every expansion, which means buying packs makes more sense because you get relatively more crafting-dust-value from it (by opening more new cards that you don't already have).
---
So, you're probably a whale in that case, which means you're funding the game for the rest of us.  Thanks for that!

They used to get 40 bucks a year from me for the standalones, since they changed to 3 huge expansions with double class legendaries out of greed. They get nothing.

I think the second one is a bit more consistent because almost no cards are "dead cards," unlike the spellstone in the first list.

Not playing until Valeera start wearing Hijab.

Sucks that everyone is shitting on your idea, but every good idea starts with a brainstorm session. Not saying your idea is bad, though.

That’s what this is, just a brainstorm. I’d say, keep thinking things up. The likelihood that any random idea from reddit makes it into a design is slim but, who knows?

You can play Darkness Druid.
---
Darkness, Augmented Elekk, Floop. You shuffle like 9-18 candles into their deck and build two darknesses so that it is hard for them to remove both. Most decks can only hard remove one 20/20 at once. Naturalize forces them to draw candles.
---
Note that this is still worse than just playing usual cards like Togwaggle and Hakkar.
---
... and make card animations faster to accomodate that.
---
$60 should buy a whole expansion.

What HS really need is a fundamental level change. 
---
Don't worry, soon or later there will be yet another strong board taunt auto included in every deck and you'll see who's giggling afterwards.

You could make one of those anti big priest decks, with cards that put small minions on their side of the board and go play in wild. I heard 40% of wild is big priest now that shaman is nerfed.

OMG can you believe how Blizzard covered up Maiev Shadowsong?!?! Look at the mask and gear she’s wearing in the official portrait artwork!

---
I’ve been thinking about this a fair amount. I’ve been playing since Exodar cardback, hit legend a dozen times with most classes, have all golden heroes. Nothing feels new or exciting in the game anymore. While I appreciate how well balanced the meta has been this year, it feels like I’ve been seeing the same decks for the whole year. Dude/odd pally, even pally, Mind Blast Priest, Cubelock etc. There’s nothing I want in classic packs, nothing I really want from any of this year’s packs, and nothing beyond golden heroes to work on in that regard. From a game design standpoint, I think it was good to have lower power this year (the power level of DKs is unfun to play against), but freshening the meta with nerfs has its own downsides. I had just crafted two Doomerangs to try Kingsbane Rogue when it got killed by nerfing a common, so I was just out of luck on that 800 dust. If nerfs like that become more common at the same time niche epics are required to play meta decks, that’s frustrating. All my favorite Classic cards that I liked enough to craft in golden have been nerfed or hall of famed, and that feels bad too. 
---
To keep the meta fresher, I would rather every year get a core set comprised of a handpicked set of classic/wild cards, and when each expansion is released, the oldest expansion in standard rotates out at the same time. This makes every expansion standard eligible for the same amount of time and keeps a yearly cadence with the core set. Wild cards I’ve been holding on to have a chance to be standard legal again in the future.
---
Basically, nothing in the game feels like progression to me anymore, and reaching legend isn’t really rewarding, and it’s not fun to do it against the same decks all year.

Either way, it's still incredibly different from the leeching poison, as there's a limit to the life steal, and unless you're super cautious in how you play buffs you're going to lose a big chunk of that lifestealing.

Meta kinda sucks right now and everyone is waiting for April to come and the sets to rotate out.

Fixing these problems are not mutually exclusive, but it shows that the teams priorities are not focused on UI and gameplay features, but instead on their game's image.

Ouch, that's not a great legendary.

Two new types of decks, Odd and Even. Like the name suggests, they only have have cards of odd/even cost, with Odd decks having an upgraded hero power, and Even decks having the base one reduced to 1. This is possible thanks to [[Baku the Mooneater]] and [[Genn Greymane]]. People hate those decks. 
---
As for who's OP, Paladin and Hunter. Hunter may not survive the rotation, since they loose a lot of key cards, Paladins not so much. Finally, people seem to think Odd Warrior will be king next expansion.

Because I want to win... I want to see how good I am / get better at the game I (used to) love. Ladder is too long , and because of the duration, your rank often feels like a function of how much time you put in rather than your skill level. A tournament mode lets you buy in with either gold / cash equivalent, and play against other players trying very hard to win. This way you get to see how good you actually are, and actually get better by getting your ass kicked. Plus it's fun to chase the dream of "going infinite" on tournament modes. Magic Arena has this feature and it's great, low ish buy in, with a really high reward for going 7-2. It's a way for players to test their skill / chase more immediate rewards rather than the ladder system. On months where I don't have 50 hours to devote to hearthstone, I can't reasonably compete. But with a tournament mode, I can compete all the time. 
---
They pile them up
---
I've been playing again after a long time (shortly afyer the release of old gods)...its been fun at times but the control cards and OTK combos are absolutely ridiculous. I actually prefer playing against the aggro meta of the past. 
---
More importantly is the fact it takes godly amounts of money and/or time to build up a collection. I would enjoy the game a lot more if I could build decks with a variety of classes. I love trying to build new decks. Since I refuse to spend hundreds of dollars (or hours) to do that, I am basically just stuck to paladin since I was able to craft those meta cards (only by dusting all my wild legendaries RIP). If the dust economy was FAR less greedy, I would really enjoy myself a lot more.
---
&gt; resistant to change 
---
When said change is censorship, it's called regression.
---
Depends on if it’s something that does or doesn’t matter. If you say you’re angry with the state of hearthstone, ok, that’s justifiable. But getting mad over a small change to a character’s outfit is isn’t justifiable. 
---
If Trump doesn't want to be treated hostilely, he shouldn't act like a turd. And if the people who support him don't want to be treated hostilely they shouldn't support such a shitty president. Its not a hard concept to understand.

Also because they won't get any sympathy from him.

---
We don’t know what the team is working on at the moment besides the next couple expansions. And it’s perfectly reasonable to say that you think the priorities of the team aren’t right. But most people are just pissed they can’t see Jaina’s cleavage now, not about the priorities of the Dev team.

Yeah, in much of the world you can have naked people, but they'd censor the violence.

I see it more like a custom match,which enables you to only allow specific expansions (not standard or wild only) , sideboarding or any other features. sure you can do that with a friend, but making it public would accelerate the scene.
---
What would take to get Ben Brode back?
---
You see how that question sounds a little silly.
---
Not many people played hearthstone as main game. And very few people would return to a game they used to play as main game after they quitted.

Rush Warrior is a lot of fun. It's a pretty decent deck and catches a whole lot of people of guard. It's a lot more fast paced than you'd expect from a rush deck. Lethal on turn 5-7 is pretty common with a bit of luck draw. I can catch my list (I got it online as well) if you want. 
---
8.000 ranked. 73 arena (noob)

Yes, it’s viable. However Odd Warrior is one of Big Spell Mages most favored matchups, so this tells me you’re playing too much for tempo in this matchup. You need to mulligan everything vs odd warrior if you don’t have Jaina. Use Polymorph’s on Direhorn hatchlings. You should win every game vs odd warrior that goes to fatigue where Jaina isn’t the last 5 cards. Unfortunately, there’s almost no way to win vs otk paladin if you aren’t playing Mojomaster Zihi unless they make a mistake or you make a big board they can’t answer. If you play Mojomaster then the game plan is to play her the turn before they otk you, Zola Zihi back into your hand and then they die to fatigue. 
---
It goes both ways. Go figure they took the time to actually go out of their way and actually change it.
---
The images are still available all over the internet. They haven't been deleted from the internet. Would making her cloak red be censorship? All they are doing is changing one article of clothing on a character. What if they just really liked the way that bra look/shirt/whatever looked. They aren't suppressing anything.
---
I think OP's point is that not even 0.01% of players play in these kind of tournaments.

The button is also says Play Now instead of Play Free.

This is why I never spend a single $ in a F2P game. As long as you keep your "F2P" mentality you have some sort of mental barrier that help resisting the compulsive buy. If you start buying it once, why not twice? I'm perfectly aware of this and prefer to be on the F2P side than the whale side. The only exception was 10$ compendium for Dota 2 and at the end I bought it 3 years in a row because once it was done it was pretty "easier" to repeat. Most of the time the good habbit is to compare with what you could buy for the same price.

Nobody is being deeply affected by this minor visual change except the people being outraged over nothing, this is not a huge political issue.

Low level wild where most people just plays fun decks (in my experience).

I mean, I've seen multiple posts of "look how unlucky I am opening this bad legendary" on this sub, it's one of the tried-and-true varieties of shitposting.  That joke doesn't make sense unless you're thinking "if only I had gotten a different legendary instead".  Opening a legendary is never bad, it's one of the best results.  It's like when people post those Tracking posts of them Tracking-ing into a DK Rexxar + 2 other good cards--that's what you want to do with Tracking!
---
I think preordering every expansion is enough to be a whale, but I know different people have different definitions.  I imagine the devs salivate over players willing to pay $150 a year, it doesn't take many of those players to fully fund a game like this.

Just have fun and play the game. That's usually enough to complete the quests. If it's just a deck that you don't have that's a pretty easy fix. Make a deck with that class. It might not be the best, most hyper-optimized build... But it doesn't typically need to be in order to complete most quests.
---
This is coming from a guy with nearly no card base...
---
Hearthstone in general underutilizes the real screen estate so much it's kinda jarring. I get they want to keep things simple and clean, but the tradeoff for that shouldn't be losing out on functionality of the interface

Ah the polymorph Secret. That makes more sense

Can’t complain about complainers giving me great content.

I’m sorry, do you think these are areas covered by the same people and requiring similar amounts of work? Adding that bit of cloth was like a 5 minute job from a single artist. Thinking you can draw any conclusions about priorities from that is absurd... and I’m not even saying that the conclusions you drew are necessarily wrong. Just that trying to tie that to this is absolutely laughable. Like, this is the equivalent of getting mad they fixed a spelling mistake or alignment issue.

It was the polymorph secret

I'd generally advise against picking pillage the fallen as it is quite slow in comparison to most treasures and the benefits are quite inconsistent.

Yep, just my luck

What happened?

4 times in a row in the face , RNG did not favor me 
---
Not all opinions are equal sorry. Getting mad over this is done dumb, reactionary bullshit. Like why do you honestly care? It has no effect on anyone’s life.
---
why should ressurect or the other resummons be the issue, if the only reason your opponent can resummon Y'Shaarj on turn 4 is Barnes?
---
If we would only be able to resummon a 3 or 4 drop it would be fine..
---
Wait if Jaina now has a shirt, would it not make sense that it would be longer?

blizzard is dead
---
2x Polymorph, Dragon's Fury, Meteor, Blizzard, Flamestrike.
---
There's a lot more than 15 armour gain in there.
---
Its also OP's only source of "life" gain outside of Jaina. I wouldn't touch the Artificers. They're key against Aggro matchups to recover after the initiate waves.
---
OP if you have Baron Geddon or Keleseth, those are options if you have Gluttonous Ooze too.
---
Personally, I've found Keleseth to be rather underwhelming as I never really hard mulligan for him. Looking for Jaina or Removal options are usually far more useful depending on match up.
---
I use the standard Arcane Tyrants for mine too. Though you can do without if you don't want to craft.
---
Actiblizz covered up her goodies to please the Asian censorship, simple as that.
---
Meh, I actually managed to get to rank 15 with an Odd Mech Dragon had a Farm Warrior, but that's probably because it can outlast hunters fairly well. Still, I don't play much ranked either. 
---
Make it cheaper, 3 expansions a year are too much to pay for :(. And always rotate one out when one comes in. 
---
A lot, I've posted in multiple deleted or removed threads.
---
Odd mage is almost untouched by rotation.
---
It's actually not that much about people being able to make it to higher ranks. Not trying to shit on you, seriously. It's just that a whole lot of players don't like the grind. Especially since matchups became THIS polarizing as they are right now. Sure, there's always chances everywhere, but most of the time you know you can win or just leave it by turn 3-5.
---
That one really is stupid. How does the top follow her cleavage like that? Cloth does not work like that. Looks like they wanted to have their cheesecake and eat it too.
---
What about all the Jaina waifu complaints?
---
They didn’t change Lunara tho. Blizzard confirmed as furries. 
---
That was when the players were near the big screen without ears and chinese players could also hear the chinese audience?
---
This article seems to imply they were right though. It was actually someone else playing on the account unlike the hearthstone incident.

What does Urtimeismine mean ?

I'm guessing it just means "I rope you every turn and waste your time  haha"

They should have just changed at the breast plate. Now she's wearing an absurdly short shirt.
---
So, when you say 'save for the reroll', I understand that reroll becomes available if the quest is left hanging. I mean if I do not like a quest (say it only rewards 50 gold) AND I leave it unifinished, I will get the reroll option next day, using which I can try if I get a more rewarding quest. 
---
Is that correct?
---
That’s some dedication to your username right there.
---
We haven't seen what the new expansion is gonna be, what keyword will be introduced, or even any of the cards. Save everything, don't spend any dust or gold until we can have a clear picture of the meta. That means not crafting until about a month after rotation.
---
And later making a thread were he accused Amaz of viewboting, while he ( wich Amaz found out later) was the one who boted Amaz to make him look like the bad guy.

Lol imagine telling people that stonetusk boar is op 2 years ago

Odd version is decently effective but a little less fun without keleseth. Maybe I'll try it out and make a post about it.

as for tracking I just think every card is special and doesnt deserve to get discarded

I think there are different ways to play it, all what you wrote could be a way for it to work, depends on the game.
---
It's just a few, very loud and annoying people. Not gonna name any specific group of people, but well.
---
Yeah we might be more puritan than europe when it comes to dicks&amp;stuff in movies, but when it comes to silly stuff like "sexualized characters in videogames", this happened very recently and it's a very small % of the population... They're just extremely loud. Sadly some people listen to them.
---
It was actually the opposite: female nudity is all over the place, and it is a problem. The reactions to the "Jaina nerf", or the mere fact that it got called a nerf in the first place, shows how deep sexism is in gaming.
---
Female nudity the way we, males, want it is not "sacred" but plain sexist.
---
I hope no one was actually serious about that. Maybe I’ll do a bit of digging from when the change went live.
---
Take 3 meta decks, one should definitely be a Paladin deck and the other a hunter. The third could be something a little wacky but I would just recommend another meta deck.
---
It was obviously a reference, too subtle it seems, to the "Jaina nerf" drama that has been shaking the HS world.
---
I support this theory since day one.
---
What's memetic about it? Its not like Millhouse or Cho with an over-the-top effect. Its not like Illidan or Onyxia with lore nostagia. Its not like Da Undatakah or Duskfallen Aviana with a once-in-a-blue-moon combo potential. 
---
Its just boring. Besides being bad. It isn't worth much to memers or serious players.
---
that's the thing, when HS devs think about HS, THEY think about weaponized piñata (and other cards like this).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i would say it is a really critical realization, which explains all things they do, why they dont care about "hardcore" players and esport, even then they say they do. it is not about words, it is what they do and how they do it.
---
you know who cares about HS hardcore players? vicious syndicate, hsreplay.net, /r/hsarena 
---
Nothing is particularly OP, but Hunter and Priest seem to have a bit of an edge. The most popular decks being Midrange Hunter and both variations of Ressurrect Priest. I recommend the "Aggro" Odd Mage as it has decent macthups against both. The only class that really struggles is Shaman and Even Shaman is still pretty playable. Everything else can get you anywhere you should be at. 
---
Your legendary doesn't see a lot of play currently, but is quite alright. It should definitely see play after rotation, so hold on to it.
---
I agree, a 2 drop that snowballs as long as your opponents has tokens on the board, won me several games against aggro
---
This question has been asked by you and other developers numerous times over the past 4 or so years.  Little has been implemented.  Card games live and die by formats there is no reason to not have multiple formats with ranked ladders.  The old excuse that you don't want to fracture the player base is ridiculous.  So the logic is let everyone do the same thing for 5 years and instead of creating interesting ways to engage your audience we will just watch players numbers hemorrhage until we are forced to make a change.  You get to a certain point in a games life where players that have been around since the begging stop hanging on for dear life and just move on.  The people love this game and that have invested time and money are so bitter at the end it just appears to be nonsensical ranting and easily dismissed by developers.  Where all the people that care leave how can you ever get constructive feedback that i'snt just ultra casuals agreeing with blizzard on every front.  Its a shame blizzard pushed HoTS, that game was DoA, if that effort would have been put into HS who knows where this game would be.  In closing as someone who has spent close to 10k USD over 5 years trying to collect the only thing in this game to get golden cards, i'm coming to the end with HS.  There is nothing to do in this game.  There are no progression points for players.  No achievements, no real promotions to incentives players to play.  A perfect example is MTG:A alternate card art for special events players can participate in.  This game is constantly pampering the players that log in a few times a week playing less then 100 games a season.  This game has more than enough room to accommodate all types of players but for whatever reason refuses too.  Development on anything other than new cards 3 times a year is non-extant.  Like I said before my watch is coming very close to and end with Hearthstone.  Simply put nothing ever happens in this game, other than a new xpack every 4 months.  The cancellation of tournament mode is so telling on team 5's priorities I have to be honest the future looks grim.

I played against a roper last night... He didn't even play well, and I beat him by turn 8 with a Priest.

IDK why they are so annoying

It's not good, basically.

Wow, 8 whole wins in ranked?!
---
Bit too lite now
---
dont always come to this sub anymore, glad to see 2 people are fighting the good fight against infinite value, as much as I love DK rexxar, and as cool as it is, it really is too close to kingsbane/jadeidol which I hate with a fire beyond all else, I am ok with my control hunter wild reno deck being worse 
---
anyways, thats a lot of complaints, ty for listing them all
---
How are they going to plan for when the come across an opponent who ropes?
---
Haven't played for a year and a half, so  I am probably a little past the relevant target for the question, but I will give it a go. At first, I was a bit bored with the game. Upon moving onto both Gwent and then MTGA though, I think it's the fact that with my limited resources I find myself unable to have fun- as in, I end up saving to make one or two decks that I really don't enjoy much for the sake of doing well on the ladder. When I compared it to MTGA, there was a lot of netdecking there as well but my homebrews still felt powerful and viable, as well as other formats, so that if I did make a few more fun but less competitive decks I could still play and importantly, still get rewards for ranks and play. In Hearthstone even though Casual technically exists I really only ever played on Ladder and I think it was the ladder experience that killed it for me.
---
Do you have any example of this vitriol?
---
As others have posted, I haven't seen The Beast mentioned anywhere in ages
---
this video makes me want to spend all the gold I have..
---
Yeah fuck you too buddy.
---
Were there any feminists demanding this change?  Like, anywhere?  I wasn't aware of any big controversy surrounding Jaina Proudmoore on feminist Twitter or anything.
---
Played since early closed beta and pre-ordered every expansion etc...until the last.
---
The game has gotten stale as the only freshness is the cards, but even playing regularly and preordering the expansions I was falling behind (it also didn't help that every preorder I was getting the least amount of value possible out of my packs) and couldn't afford the dust to craft non-meta decks to play for fun.
---
The complete disregard for the player experience (same spectator mode bugs as beta, cancelling a very poorly conceived tournament mode, late and unimaginative card changes, etc..) showed me that A/B was content just milking the playerbase for money, so I quit participating in that.
---
At this point, unless the next expansion comes out cheaper and with new game modes I wont be back.  There are WAY too many great games out there for me to keep rebuying the same 6 year old mobile title and after you miss an expansion, recovering is too difficult.
---
Fucking HAX

I love DK Rexxar and I'm contemplating moving to wild with him tbh

So just add it to PC?

You're playing even lock? with penguins?

In the recent wave of Blizzard firings, they let go of the person who used to do the list.

No word on if they are going to keep doing it or if that duty will be passed off onto other people.

You posting this on reddit may be the reason xd

I love the noticeable pause after pack 2.. "Am I recording this? Is that really another legendary?"
---
Pack 3 pause... "WHAT THE F!!! This isn't happening!?" 
---
What an ass. They deserve every point of damage you dealt them. How did you manage to get to such a board state?
---
I can show them but I dont have any evicende to prove they are not fake. To be honest, I dont even have proof you exist. Show me proof or else I wont keep talking to a machine!
---
(See? if you are the guy claiming the opposite thing of the post, you are the supposed to prove your arguments. Everybody should be proving their arguments but you cant just come and expect everyone to feed you information while the only thing you have to defend yourself is "that proof is not good enough for me". This is probably the reason why everybody is telling you that you are white-knighting or similar, because it seems you are going against all the comments just for the sake of it or for the sake of magicamy, instead of based in any data)
---
Look at his comment history it's gold
---
For a golden legendary too? That is still pretty lucky I think...?
---
If he did, it would just have been a waste of time for both. The idea is continuing the game where they left off so whoever wins feel like they earned it.
---
This was my first thought, followed by "nice try Blizz employee".
---
It is almost like there are multiple issues here. Also, 
---
&gt; ...Oh wait that's you.
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
It seems the worst legendary minions have a much higher percentage of draw with this card. It's really a bad card.
---
Just like Heartstone likes to give you the most useless epic and legendary minions in their card packs. 
---
So that's where my luck went..
---
Sometimes this are visual bugs (like hovering cards). The game is still running in the back. 
---
What I do in this cases is (as fast as I can) close and open the game again. This way the bug goes away and you get to continue playing! If your fast enough, you might not even loose the turn.
---
But seriously, could they please remove genn and baku already

---
Undatakah Paladin, where you drop spike ridged steed on Undatakah and give him immortal prelate and silver vanguard death rattles, so you get a taunt minion that recruits itself every time it dies
---
After creating it, its easier to change it to make it appeal to a larger portion of the playerbase. The point is, the fact that it wouldnt appeal to everyone immedietly after being released, doesnt mean they shouldnt try and release and then improve it
---
The fuck just happened.
---
Been tinkering around with summoning stone decks. So far I've done druid and mage. Both are pretty great. The core idea is to play meat wagon and have that pull summoning stone on an unsuspecting opponent.
---
Can also combo with Barnes and Oaken summons to be more consistent in pulling out the stone.
---
Once it's out you can play cards like spreading plague to protect it or perform tempo swings with firelands portal or ultimate infestation. 
---
They've made opening packs on mobile way faster in a recent patch. Try it out. 
---
That was awesome. I opened like 3 legendaries in 10, one gold and back to back with another. But still, that’s pretty far from fucking 4 in a row. 
---
Would be interresting to have a monthly summary. I think weekly might be too frequent.

Screw mechathun. If I wanted to play with myself only, I'd have chosen pornhub not Hearthstone.

I mean sure. So is mountain giant turn  3 or 4. Killing everything off doesn't make a game more interesting. The cycle of aggro-control-combo is your 3 political branches of power with checkups and balance. If there is no early threat for control or combo, they will just be greedy and eliminate other inferior combo or control decks and the game is gonna be shit.

- Even Mech Hunter (no spellstone)

- Mech Warrior

Also trying to build Spell Damage Mage right now. But I need more boomsday cards.
---
Dragon mage and otk mage.
---
The otk deck is - stay alive - do 7+ hero power damage - play Luna's Pocket Galaxy - play: jan'alai, cube, faceless, faceless, deathwing - end turn
---
These numbers seem a bit low to me if Im honest.

Everytime someone does this to me I rope back until they stop while watching a show or something and then emote spam when I beat them

I saw 3 playable legendarys. I've been playing since open beta and I've only opened 1 golden legendary. Feelsbadman
---
Wow, and here I have to lowest average of legendaries of the recent six sets. Congrats though, they aren't all useless :-) 
---
I think yes. It never happened to me though, normally I beat her faster than turn 10.
---
Sounds like me lol. I swear I max the mercy counter each time. Minus the one time I got 3 in like 20 packs on a new release. Otherwise the mercy counter is my friend. With few years into the game and probably a few thousand packs opened I’ve still only received one golden legendary and that was about 2 years into it. 
---
The best part about this to me is that he's a rank 7 somehow
---
Wow, so many holier than thou people here... 
---
Oh I agree with you, I personally hate that 99% of "fixes" seem to just be mana adjustments. I'm just saying that anything other than mana is highly improbable, even if a nerf was to occur.

---
It does suck the life out of certain cards that they require a large build around a lot of set up and with one card they can turn your rock into a floppy dogs ear.
---
It is the entire reason Blizzard decided to make very few silence effects. They kill so many cards just by their mere existence
---
Should’ve played around it.

Cairne used to be good. Poor guy got power-creeped out.

Yes bro well played your too good for the game. I play since release of the game so now 4/5 y ago and never got single golden legendary haha i am a noob

Blizzard fired all their artists and are now outsourcing their art tastings to that weird girl in your high school who sat in the back drawing anime characters in class.

Oddly enough, you've decided to record absolutely no evidence of it occurring. That's like getting a royal flush eight times in a row and just going, "I'm sure everyone will just believe me".

If you had been playing for a year or two or would be believable. You went a little too big. 
---
Stonetusk, mctech
---
Have Blizzard censored parts of their games before to cater to a particular audience? yes, Undead in WoW is a prime example
---
Did it affect the rest of the world? no
---
Does this change affect the rest of the world? yes
---
This is such a minor change but could be the beginning of an era where anything that is censored in one country/by a loud minority will become censored worldwide. That´s my thought regarding agenda when I think about this, wtf did you get extermination of all games/white genocide from?
---
If they really want to make the game less sexual, shouldn't they give the same treatment to every image in the game, atleast to portraits as they are the poster childs? If you´re gonna cover up with clothes, at least do it equally across all the portraits, especially if you want to talk about better ''representation'' (just look at Garrosh &amp; Malfurion). I for one don´t get how this change will be a better female representation as it won´t introduce a new representation such as flat chested/body size/eye colour/race/whatever else you can think of.
---
Personally I don´t care if they replace old portraits with new ones (so long as the old ones are aviailable in one form or another), but when you go around &amp; change current images it just pokes me the wrong way. It´s not like she was covered in swastikas, so why even bother?

Can't really do comparisons though without including numbers like the number of total posts including not complaints or the number of subscribers.

Interestingly we are actually at a low point in the complaint cycle right now.  I think the upcoming HoF announcement and rotation has taken the wind out of a lot of complaints.  Would be interesting to see a repeat of this post when the circle jerk gets in full overdrive again.
---
History shows. Rotations make insane changes to meta game. Guess you forget cards like happy ghoul. Soon as the meta shifts so do weaker cards

The reason that creatures come back full size is not a bug, it's because (let's use Barnes as an example) he creates a copy of a creature with a "buff" which alters the statline to 1/1, same way that shrink Ray and equality show up on the "buff" hover. So when it dies, there is a dead version of this creature in the pool. Now, unless otherwise stated (kangors endless army) Rez effects DO NOT copy any "buffs" the creature had when it died. 
---
Additionally, there was a blog post earlier that addresses that buffs on creatures being removed if they moved backwards from the standard order of [deck~hand~board~graveyard] and that they retain them going in the proper order. 
---
The idea that silencing a creature would restore the original statline is just a logical extension of the 1/1 part being a "buff"
---
lmao not his fault valve doesn't give a shit

U open all my packs 
---
Day late but I love your username
---
I just open a pack with Hakkar, is there a deck playable around it?
---
What do Arena Leaderboards have to do with the dev team? It sounds like an esports or CM thing.
---
Cut it out, at least it's not a card you should dust.
---
Streaming is its own awful, exaggerated slapstick subculture, isn't it
---
It's like bitching about bitching.
---
Okey, I just heard that if you craft a card that is going to become wild you get the crafting cost back and you can disenchant aswell. which in this case would be 1600 from returned dust and 400 for the disenchant opposed to the 1600 for the golden.
---
If they decide not to do it then I'm kinda screwed so might just hold on to the Golden one, and Golden Sulfaras looks sick so.
---
Damn bro, save some pussy for the rest of us. 
---
The only reason I haven't purchased Medivh is the clash between his artwork and the hero power artwork. It just doesn't work.
---
A bit weird that they didn't change the date on the original announcement of the announcement then
---
More legendaries than Ive opened this set. Fuck you OP. 
---
Unpopular opinion: I like it 
---
I will repeat. He got barnes with coin on 3, he played 2 ressurects on 4. This is what the deck is suposed to do. If it doesnt do this, it loses. This tier 2 deck with barely 50% winrate is far from being as cancer as naga, nor it is limiting any other decks out of the meta as naga did. Also, it can be asnwered by far more cards than naga could.
---
Its nice to see also that you admit to being a roper, or that you think that roping someone that plays a deck you dont deem "worthy" deserves all the bad they can have. It says a lot about you.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Where do I report this disgusting hax?
---
I spent all my dust crafting a degree that's worthless in the employment metagame.
---
Yeah thats what i found out after googling a bit. Looks really fun doe so might try to make a fun evolve deck for casual or something. Playing with a Marin Quest warrior deck now so fun but random shit is up my alley.
---
oof
---
X22#2237 EU quest trade
---
Ooooo a druid getting crushed? I like it!
---
ELEMENTAL SHAMAN. I AM SHOUTING SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY PLAY AND REFINE THIS BEAUTY OF A MID-RANGE DECK WITH SHUDDER AND HAGATHA AS TOP ENDS.
---
You win against control most of the times. Zihi and Unraveller for anti combo. Not yet lost to Any mechathun or togg. Beat the only apm priest faced yet. Not lost even one game to any priest, thanks to hex. 
---
Hard matchups are super aggro like hunter or secret mage. BUT IT'S SO FUN.
---
If you haven't tried it, Odd Quest Warrior with Oondasta and big beasties is a ton of fun as well.
---
Echolocation/Meatlock
---
That sweet Glinda/Gnomeferatu combo, or just a board full of a Sea Giants is good too. 
---
I'm a simple man, I see a druid with 48 armor getting killed, I upvote.
---
I know your arguments about consistency. That doesn't make it okay to have this board turn 4. Anyone who plays this shit deserves to get roped to the ends of time.
---
It isn't as consistent as naga, but there are some classes that just have zero answer to this board no matter what deck they are playing in that class. Naga and this deck should have been nerfed, not just naga. Cheating out this many stars for playing three cards is nonsense.
---
I don't see why  you would defend this brainless deck. I'll gladly rope all the cunts playing it, and be normal with the other people as usual. 
---
The new Awesome Augmentation Spell Priest deck with a few alterations to make it more meta viable.
---
It's not the best, but you can get some insane value when you Seance a a grave horror, couple it with a couple zero mana spells, minion buffing and Sand Drudge and it's pretty enjoyable.
---
Can't play it. Don't give a fuck. 
---
Don’t get me started.
---
Sneaky Devil got stuck there for the rest of the game, which was annoying cuz he blocked me from selecting any minion under him
---
During the rotation, only cards being Hall of Fame'd gives you the crafting cost back while letting you keep the cards. These HoF cards are only from the classic set. Your golden warrior quest will not be HoF'd, so it will simply rotate out like the rest of the cards from the year of the mammoth.
---
I'm assuming it doesn't break the game... but what happens if you play Tess into Shudderwock or vice versa? 
---
Cause in my mind I'm picturing something like — Tess, summons a second shudderwock, triggering Tess's battlecry again, summoning another shudderwock... etc. 
---
Well, there are a great many chinese MMORPGs around that are nothing but cleaveage, dance emotes and shallow game-play loops.
---
So yeah I doubt they give a crap about Jaina, I think this decsion from Blizzard was largely for the US.
---
Currently at 7.9 average after 25 runs, never been on the leaderboards before, great timing once again for me ;) been playing everywhere to try to fit it in my life, on the train, doing dishes etc, kind of takes the motivation away for those last 5 runs 
---
People were very serious about that "censorship" lol
---
#2785 80g quest trade EU. U go first! 
---
That's a fair point actually
---
But odd hunter has 2 legendaries there... and one midrange hunter has 1 legendary, the Savanna Highmane /s
---
aww
---
this why I love this deck shudder tess
---
I mean I enjoy card games like these. I have put time into hearthstone and have accumulated cards too. I am above average at the game as well. It doesn't change the fact that these companies are exploiting their customers. I can enjoy card games and not be okay with how the executives try to squeeze every cent out of their consumers. I'm not trying to say you shouldn't okay or spend your hard earned money but certainly you can see the exploitative nature inherent in them. I just think there is a better way and fairer way for these companies to do things that can still net a large profit or perhaps even make more than games like hearthstone and magic.
---
After 4 legendaries I quit watching. Fuck this guy. 
---
I have a lot of hope for the next year rotation from Blizz, but I can say, if I never lose to another Inner Fire Priest in standard again, I'd be happy. 
---
It shows up in every meta, every year. It's one of the least fun OTKs to play against, if only because I've been playing against it for almost 5 years now, from Dreadlord to Steambot to countless others, it's just boring. Give Priest more options to be aggressive without being borderline unskilled (if the only thing you need to do in a game is draw or discover the spells in your deck, it's not really interesting or interactive). 
---
Over the last 2 years in standard - 
---
* We lost Ice Block mage
---
* We lost Super Ramp Druid
---
* We (kind of) lost Miracle Rogue (with delayed stealth)
---
Like - fuck druid and all, but this is just unfun and pointless. Why even bother having a board to contest anything if spells from hand are going to be the only thing that really matters. 
---
Haha, that’s exact the same I thought 
---
I just finished lunch but this post made me hungry again. Nice work
---
Is that bread even toasted??
---
Can't see why there couldn't be more modes when you hit "Play".
---
Maybe you hit Play and a drop down shows:
---
**Ranked**
---
**Casual**
---
**Pauper**
---
**Limited**
---
**Singleton (banning singleton specific cards like Reno)**
---
Etc. each new set they brought in would stay fresh for way longer. Bored of one mode? Switch over to a different and try your hand there. We would need more deck slots though...
---
Haha well played. Yeah it's childish I know but I can't help getting triggered by turn 4 Barnes into "wow"... I also think ressurect spells should be nerfed in some way. So if I had it my way it would be deleted as a deck as it currently stands. 
---
I did read your points and I know you are right on most stuff. That doesn't change how I feel when I face it though. It's the epitome of anti fun for me. Some people hate mill in the same fashion, but at least mill requires some thought so I don't mind it as much. If you did a blog for blizzard development or balance, I imagine the way you articulate yourself would make it popular. But still, fuck big priest. Have a nice day too :) 
---
Quest Rogue. 
---
Shadow visions should have been discover a spell in your deck and draw it. I have no idea why it has been this way for so long.
---
Give me a tavern brawl that requires exact lethal to kill. +70 attack on a minion vs a 30 hp guy? Useless. +70 attack on a minion against Druid? Sounds good.
---
Lol trust me, it is :P

---
I rarely get legendaries at all so I got all excited when I *finally* saw a golden glow around a card from a brawl classic pack.  
---
It was Millhouse
---
At this point of the game I'm glad late expansion content gets creative.
---
/r/evenwithcontext 
---
This is simple, craft Mill Rogue
---
He would have lived with 15 health if he played the auchenai after the potion
---
I wouldn't necessarily say better. It's slightly different and somewhat more enjoyable for myself having played elemental shaman previously. Rather, I would say it's refreshing since there aren't pre-conditions you need to meet by playing an elemental the previous turn. Ladder-wise, I've done well with it, having climbed from R13-R9 rather easily. It focuses on big minions that stick on the board while building a good value engine when you play Shudderwock. 
---
Against other control decks, it's typically an easy win because you can just out-value and win into fatigue with the Elise double/quadruple packs (Depending on how you play it). I'll typically hold mindbreakers to drop behind a taunt so Rexxar can't build minions.
---
Aggro is roughly the same. You have so many board clears and mindbreaker slows down their game play enough for you to catch a breather for 2-3 turns, if played correctly. It also can be hilarious to watch them scramble to do everything in their power to remove the 2/5 body that's blocking their ramp-up. 5 health puts it out of range on a chunk of minions attacks and removal spells in early game.
---
Combo is where it falls flat on it's face. It's a coin-toss on those. At that point, you have to stop holding minions for value and just slam out the strongest minion you can on the board every turn to power through their removal or burn down their HP.
---
I can send a deck list if you're interested. It's typical Shaman value playing with some dragon tribal and a few tech changes made on my part to counter the meta.
---
Fair enough, appreciate the answer.
---
Oh do we ever. 
---
Damn, dont forget to have your phone fully charged when you start!

---
It is bad, I agree. It is mainly there for having enough pirates that can be pulled by Captain Hooktusk, because you dont always get to play Hooktusk on turn 8 and sometimes your Minstrels draws you all the pirates except Hooktusk. Ofcourse these games are games you were not meant to win to begin with. But you have to keep in mind that EVERY pirate is a threat, because it is an extra 3 damage that is fired from the Cannon Barrage. This is also the reason why Sharkfin Fan is so scary, because every pirate no matter the size basically represents an extra 3 damage from Cannon Barrage. In this case the Freebooter is good because it is one of the few pirates which has a lot of HP, if you think about it there aren't really any other pirate in standard that has more than 4 HP other than the Freebooter. You would also be surprised how few decks that can handle a 4 mana 4/5 or a 4 mana 5/5. 5 HP is a sweet spot because it dodges a lot of removals such as Odd Warrior Armor Up + Shield Slam, Swipe, Flamestrike, Wrath + Hero Power, Evicerate.
---
It's a very aggressive build on an old classic.
---
Maybe just post a deck code?
---
Now if only my pity timer can give me a legendary...
---
Thx for letting us know, we all have been waiting for news about this. Also will there be an arena event for this expansion?
---
...I got two double legendaries in four packs (one gold) before.
---
This has been a known bug since Gral's release and it is not only limited to demons, any card Shark Boi eats has a chance to sit on the field for both you or your opponent.
---
I say let it stay because it isn't just a screenshot of a single pack, and that's the type of content to be found on the subs meant for hs packs. 
---
This is unique, back to back packs, I'm video format. Good enough, unique enough, effort enough.
---
[Ended up 5-3, was able to pull all 3 Oondasta's in 1 turn, totally worth it.] (https://imgur.com/a/SEgwDiu)
---
In wild the aggro secret mage builds are way more tight (you have stuff like forgotten torch, ice lance, kabal cristalrunner, mad scientist, one iceblock, and sometimes loatheb) so they dont run poly. You could put one in case you find certain matchups bad where it should help (like big priest) but mage is already favored against it and against other decks (like cubelock) it already runs one potion of poly, that is easily searchable with arcanologist, mad scientis or masked contender. So in standard it may be okey to use it as a "I go trought taunt" card, but in wild there is way more burn (that already goes trough taunts) and 4 mana for a minion removal is far to slow for what the deck wants to do.
---
5-3!
---
Beautiful, plays Hearthstone, knows you to do yummy toasts, this one is a keeper
---
Send these type of posts over to r/HSPulls that sub deserves some love! 
---
Nah, was able to pull 5 wins at the end.
---
Didn't get that in the draft, else i'd pick it :(
---
Shudderman, man.
---
Not necessarily BM, but wasn't sure if 40 was lethal as I had my eyes on the combo a turn earlier. Had to make my 2nd Linecracker gaurentee an overkill on the 1st Linecracker and survive if the 1st Linecracker overkilled the Acolyte of Pain. 
---
I haven't really spent money in over a year either. Its just not worth it. Granted I'm playing a lot less because of how bad the game has become, but there's no perks to buying packs. I see other games offer what Boomsday preorders were offering regularly. Hearthstone never has deals around Christmas either, or any discounts around Black Friday. I think their marketing department just cant figure out how to make the packs sell themselves. You give people value for their money, they tend to spend more. You get somebody to finally spend money and it doesnt feel worth it, they'll eventually stop spending that money. 
---
Quite possibly the luckiest anyone has ever been, maybe ever!
---
Whats up old guardian! Keep the vids and decklists coming!
---
That’s a nice looking roast.
---
Mass Hysteria triggers overkills on your turn and if the minion lives it can attack again. 
---
You should join hearthstone the community on Facebook. There’s a selfie contest going on today, winner gets 2 packs. Plus it’s a good group of people. 
---
renounce warlock is stupid fun in wild, every game is completely different and it can give surprisingly good results! kinda feels like playing randomium brawl on ladder
---
Inner fire/divine spirit is a classic card. How is that power creep?
---
For cube decks it was still better potion since the cubelock could just play voidcaller + void pact turn 5 to drop a nice voidlord/malganis.
---
please tell me you won
---
I totally agree well written, he will probably not answer here, or answer with some political general non-informative statement. 
---
They could add at least 1-2 new game modes it's not so much for 5 YEARS of development.
---
Admittedly, I haven't played much recently so my knowledge of the meta isn't as sharp as it could be but Yeah, Oakheart just dumping shit from your deck is dumb, especially since most decks don't have a way to clear everything he pulls and then you get rocked for 38 and lose. 
---
Also, even when I was playing multiple hours a day I rarely watched streams or youtube. I can't remember the last time that I watched one now so that ain't it. Kibler was great tho.
---
What’s this about?
---
Don't you guys have toasters?
---
The worst thing for me is the cost. I made it a few years of spending almost 200 a year on this game. Then I realized that I felt like that was too much for what I got in return with the division between wild and standard. 
---
I guess give me more value or don't take my cards away, but what you are doing now isn't convincing me to spend real life monies on the game
---
Opened them all! 
---
How many posts about Jaina's cleavage, though? I feel like I've seen hundreds
---
I'd be of the opinion to create a new rule for really exceptional packs, if they the content is made with enough effort
---
Yes - it is a good idea - if you are interested in playing Arena. "A little competitive" is a very vague term, but for a complete novice it will take at least a bit of grinding of daily quests to get enough resources to get even a remotely competitive deck.
---
Vengefully#2366 EU 80g. You go first
---
They should make tavern brawl multiple different ones at the same time. Like a weekly featured one and then you can also queue up other ones whenever as well. 
---
codexmax#1837 NA trade 80 gold. Will show and you go first.
---
Thanks Iksar. We have like 5 different threads all about this the last 2 weeks in /r/ArenaHS and we would really appreciate some guidance as to what is going on with January (and the future) for arena leaderboards.
---
Don't you run any low cost minions in your deck? 
---
"If you're playing Magic Arena. What change would it take to bring you back to Hearthstone?"
---
Well, for starters stop making intentionally shitty Legendary with no sign of being played anywhere like fucking Moorabi. Yeah, after one year and half I'm still mad about that.
---
The design of legendaries this year has been improved slightly. Some legendaries are not insane e but find niche use ( Glass Knight) while other at least can work in tandem with other good legendaries ( face collector being good with Tess). I could win in casual even with fucking Zerek. But cards like Moorabi or Emeriss or Lady in White or Splintergraft, no, those are frustrating 
---

&gt; HS matches have always felt pretty rock/paper/scissory to me. Hard counters have always been a thing. HS has never been the type of game, that if you swapped decks with your opponent, the better player would likely win.
---
Red herring. Did you read the VSreport article he is referring to in the text? It pretty clearly shows, with data, how decks have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY more polarized over time. 
---
No, it didn't "always be like this".
---
Then you throw around some numbers seemingly made up out of thin air so... Yeah. 
---
so the week that they're planning to announce something, they don't even have the details finalized? what other reason could there be to delay it twice. my expectations are at 0 and i still feel like i'll be disappointed by whatever it is
---
How is this tempting? 
---
Malygos Druid, Odd Mage and reroll the third
---
Tess Rogue is life... unless you die turn 4
---
I hate playing against this deck
---
How is that the same as firing "all non-essentials"?
---
Some mad luck! Happened the same to me, got back to back to back to back legendaries , golden warlock weapon, black knight, baron Gedon and golden Malygos
---
Golden waterboy. Never gonna disenchant. Way too attached. No idea why.
---
Freezing trap = Most unfair card hahaha i guess it is when you suck at playing hs
---
Sometimes I don´t understand why I keep playing hs
---
对不起，他妈的
---
1) If china would complain about indecency in Hearthstone, Blizzard would have to change way more cards, e.g: Succubus, then just Jaina.And in the past if blizzard had to change things in Hearthstone for china, they only changed it for the chinese localization, why would they now change their policy regarding this 
---
2) for people to loose their job, because of "PC-culture", you would have to have a big outrage about it and I didn't see any of that.
---
Dragon Warrior, made a deck after randomly realized that I have a golden War Master Voone. I literally have never seen that card played against me and don't even remember such card existed. I get a lot if wow reactions from opponents when I play it.
---
TL;DR ?
---
Now factor in one of the legendaries being golden. 
---
Demons give him indigestion tho 🤢 
---
Can you clarify what you mean by that and why the buff is necessary?
---
I think it's a good time to start. You have a lot of strong cards rotating out soon and starting now you'll be able to get some cards that will last you a little over a year before the rotation. I started a few months ago and the most frustration I found was wanting to craft some cards and not doing it because they will be leaving so soon! 
---
Last Paragraph.
---
&gt; In conclusion, what would make me return to the frequency I used to play Hearthstone? I think the game needs to be less frustrating and more agency needs to be placed in the player’s hands. Cards that let you interact with and outplay your opponent need to exist. Make player’s decisions feel like they matter by decreasing matchup polarization and removing swing cards like Barnes and Keleseth. Make resources matter again by removing cards that provide infinite value and address the feeling of stagnation that’s been created by introducing new features or by giving players more ways to play. Thankfully, a lot of this is already on the team’s radar, and I’m looking forward to what’s in store with the next rotation.
---
I'm not familiar with the game modes. How is vanilla different from other game modes and why should I be interested in it? 
---
It's usually better tempo than a 1 mana 1/1 and Even Pally works fine.
---
I feel like this hasn't been the case lately with MTG.  It's unusual for a Mythic Rare to be unplayable in both constructed and limited; Hearthstone routinely has legendaries that are not only unplayable, but outright hostile to your win percentage.
---
Nevertheless, I'd be interested in seeing a set comparison between the two games in terms of mythics/legendaries that see no play anywhere.
---
I think a lot of it stems from shadow visions giving you a copy of a spell 
---
With regards to your first paragraph I truly just wonder what the hell hundreds of people have been working on for 5 years?? 
---
As a season 1 player playing to legend almost every season I was always holding out hope for new things but the grind to legend for no reason at all season after season made no sense until I got tired and quit. Frodan’s tweet sums this up well in that there’s really nothing to do for the long time HS player. 
---
Super sad for a game that I thought had insane potential. 
---
Infinite effective life gain will make you hate a class. Uncapped armor was a mistake.
---
You mean Fizzlebang?
---
&gt;Standard rotation is coming, which will fix a lot of these issues/concerns.  
---
I don't think it will because they really don't seem to have their heads in the right design space.  
---
A good, really recent example for me is Shirvallah. Seems like a harmless enough card but when they had an interview with IGN on their design thoughts in the recent expansions and the idea of that card being "it would be "cool" to have numerous 0 mana copies in your deck" I was just left thinking wtf ... how is that in anyway "cool" for the opponent?  
---
Now it enables an ORTK and it's an incredibly oppressive card when it gets into play that basically asks the deck it's using to throw as much control spells as possible at the opponent to setup for when you can play this and the opponent is pretty much fucked.  
---
Mechathun another example before this ... just why make a card that enables no-thought required OTKs?   
---
It's like they are only thinking of the casual player who might get a cheap thrill out of a few games doing these "cool" things and not considering what it means to their meta or the overall feel of the game for players who vest more time and want a more strategic feel to the game.  
---
It's all nice Iskar asking for help and all and I'm sure he's a great guy but looking at his job title, reading the IGN article and looking at the sort of cards that continue to come out I think perhaps he is part of the problem more than the solution.  
---
Whatever thought process goes through his mind in thinking these sort of cards are a good idea he needs to stop and think it through from another perspective because this is the sort of thing that is leading to a decline in this game.  
---
Imo of course. :)
---
Some big changes include ladder. Ranked floors at 20, 15, 10, and 5. Once you hit them you cannot fall below them. 
---
Pack opening is different. You cannot open a duplicate legendary, ever. You cannot open more than two of the same card in the same pack either. 
---
If I recall correctly, arena is in a good spot and warrior is on top because of its excellent common removal and tempo tools. 
---
The meta just got shaken up but I think a pitfall of hearthstone in general tends to be its rock paper scissor style meta. Combo beats control, control beats aggro, aggro beats combo. 
---
http://standardhearth.com/
---
I'm pretty sure that's no different from most paper. If I don't buy, for example, any mtg for two years then none of my cards (outside of lucky reprints) are legal in standard and I'm relegated to legacy (the wild equivalent).
---
Not really no unless you play wild.
---
But those bad cards will at least have more opportunities to see play given how MTG supports a lot of secondary game modes like EDH, Singleton, Commander beyond Standard play. And of course, MTG's treatment of Modern is night and day compared to how HS treats Wild. On top of all that, '10x worse' is a gross overexaggeration.
---
Are you referring to Donais’ comment on the polarization or did Iksar respond to that too?
---
MTGA has quite a different economy relating to those cards than hearthstone, though.
---
MalyRogue looks like one of the cheaper ones.
---
Rogue, tons of very low cost spells, and one card that can summon a copy of a minion in your hand
---
I can agree that there is definitely a feeling of stagnation.  I keep looking for something a little different and find myself not finding much.  Sometimes changes to arena make me think about previous choices to current ones, but even arena has felt a bit more swingy as of late.
---
Additionally, you take Divine Spirit away then you leave Priest in even worse condition at the rotation than they are already.  Unless you overhaul the entire basic/classic starter pack for Priest I don't think you can just HoF that card.
---
Literally does per definition mean both literally and figuratively.

You were not prepared!!!

I was looking for this.
---
&gt;The top 5 letters in order of popularity are “S”, “M”, “D”, “B”, and “T”
---
I wonder how many of those D and S tags are "Shadow___" and "Death___"
---
How did he react? I'm out of the loop on this.
---
My request would buffs. Ever. PLEASE. Every patch it feels like the only way the game is modified is by taking value away from players, never by giving any value. If a defensive card was too under statted to fulfill it’s niche (Hemet for example) it should be buffed, if a card that was nerfed or HOF’ed in the past for reasons that are no longer relevant (Ancient of Lore (Druid ramp nerfed) and potentially Azure Drake (4/4 no longer good trading stats for a 5 cost)) it could be returned.

I had to discard the other inner fire to make sure I didn't misplay
---
No, play dotachess
---
I've never seen that jade art before. When does the art change into that??
---
Wild Discolock.  
---
I've been playing it since Un'Goro in Wild.   
---
I used to have to build the deck with cards that generate other cards in order to have stuff to discard while still keeping playing options.  
---
And then Rastakan dropped and introduced conditional discards and the legendary that multiplies each time you discard it.  
---
It's not 100% reliable but close enough. More consistent than it's ever been. Ever since un'goro there's been a stream of nice addition to the archetype that while they must be utterly useless in standard, they're doing wonders in wild. Cataclysm for instance. Turn 4 insta quest completion. High Priestess. Shriek. The 2/6 taunt that discard the lowest cost card in your hand. Soulwarden.   
---
Though I still haven't gotten any use out of Lana'thel. After 207 games played with that deck since Rastakan's release. And even before that I rarely got any use out of her. I am considering cutting her in favor of a second soul infusion or a Mal'ganis (though really the extra +2/+2 isn't needed neither is the invulnerability - might go for a tech card instead). (Get it to drop on a Tiny Knight of Evil, Zavas, Doomguard ... or best of all a High Priestess it's awesome - don't get it on a silverware golem though, the buff isn't retained on discard).   
---
Now you can sleeves your cards! And maybe eat em!
---
You're addicted.
---
Here is an easy way to check. Stop playing. 
---
Oh fuckkk yeah aluneth was so annoying, even when they didn't draw it, just by existing, their curve could be so ridiculously aggressive
---
Yeah maybe I'm just remembering before KNC happened and power levels became a joke
---
Trading Na quest Crankzone#1300 u go first
---
Some press got emails saying that it’s going to be announced on Thursday 
---
I 2nd that, I'm a free to play player, never had trouble making meta decks, and I don't play a lot at all
---
I currently play the game and think I have a much better view of the game and it’s state than others on this subreddit. This being said I do think there are a few things I want in this game that would go a long way for the community in general. 
---
1) Change the dust economy. We get a lot of meta staleness because everyone plays meta decks and people play meta decks because it’s a good investment of their dust. If we changed prices from 40 100 400 1600 to 25 75 250 1000 and kept disenchant values the same, people would have extra dust to spend on decks they want. Maybe even a couple ‘loans’ each month where you can get full value of a card back if you disenchant one you crafted within 3 days or something. People would be more inclined to experiment. 
---
2) A new game mode. Not the 2v2 stuff or anything like that because I can only imagine how hard that would be to make look good and work well on mobile, but maybe one where you can only use select sets. There was that tavern brawl that really felt like Blizzard was experimenting with the idea and it’s gotten major approval from the community. I would actually be disappointed if Blizzard didn’t try to implement this soon. 
---
3) Actual constructed events. We get a bunch of events that affect arena or tavern brawl or daily quests, but maybe there could be one that affects maybe Casual with random buffs. For instance for the Rastakan event, the class you play could influence the sort of buff your deck gets. Just something to change the way you play. Break monotony. 
---
There are separate pity timers for all epics, legendaries, and golden cards. All pity timers are based off expansion. The pity timer for legendaries is 40 packs per expansion. So of you open 20 ungoro and 20 frozen thrown packs you are not guaranteed a legendary. Same for all other pity timers.
---
You do understand that &gt;90% of Hearthstone's player base didn't even know they did Arena leaderboards, right?
---
Honestly your results seem pretty similar to what you'd expect. These are the breakdowns of total possible quests by percentage:
---
50/81 = 61.7% 50g quests
---
24/81 = 29.6% 60g quests
---
1/81 = 1.23% 80g quests
---
3/81 = 3.7% 100g
---
3/81 = 3.7% Pack
---
You were ~5.1% higher for 50G, ~8% lower for 60g, ~0.6% higher for 80g, ~1.2% lower for 100g  and ~3.3% higher for packs. Just to note you've only included 4/5 of the percentages and you've changed the 2.77% one in the diagram and in the description. I assumed the diagram is correct and therefore you got pack quests 7% of the time.
---
They all seem within the margin of error over that sample size so it seems that your data suggests that each quest is indeed equally likely to appear. You obviously got more 50G and less 60G than you should have by random chance. Did you always reroll? Would be interesting to see how the data changes with a larger sample size.
---
Not everyone has to try-hard for legend like it seems you want to do. People just starting the game would find the solo modes fun, as well as the rank 50-25 games not as oppressive.
---
Is Murloc Mage still viable? I've got all the cards to play it but I've been having basically zero success with it, which is annoying
---
F2P can get far IF they play often, you are right about that. If this guy wants to just play from time to time yet still be competitively viable, he's probably going to have to spend or play that one cheap strong deck (like Hunter atm) and play nothing else, which can lead to fatigue of the game as a whole.
---
Surprised no one have complained about the whizbang-keleseth issue this week
---
Do you have a list for us? ;)
---
replacement for Akali?
---
inb4 Shen
---
Quest and Odd Hunter. Quest in particular have given me quite a bit of chuckles the past couple of weeks.
---
combo always
---
Exactly my erection
---
You can't be serious.
---
You list zerek and treespeaker as good, but moorabi as shit? I think you just don't understand how hearthstone works. They are all in the same boat: You win if your opponent drew like shit, or if they are very, very bad.
---
Moorabis effect can be situtionally just as good, if not better than all the cards you've mentioned so far. Which is all you need for aa fun card. But you just seem like you can't play shaman or any sort of control deck.
---
Haven't played more than the first 2 weeks of set release in over a year now. Pretty good decision. I have a lot more money for actual games that deserve it and a lot more time. I'm also genuinely happier not grinding this garbage. The carrot on the end of the stick has rotted. No point in chasing it anymore.
---
I think you, and others, are missing the point.
---
You can easily make a cheap competitive deck. Congrats, you built face hunter or zoo. That's fun for a bit. Winning is fun for a bit.
---
Lots of people want to do more than play 1, 2, 3, face face face. You'll see all sorts of fun looking decks like Odd Warrior or OTK Paladin and that's when it all breaks down, because as a free-to-player you may never actually get to play one of these decks, especially not quickly. You can grind and grind and grind and eventually access one of those decks. Maybe. Just in time for it to rotate out.
---
For lots of people, especially casual or free-to-players, there is more to the game than "can I build a deck to win." It's easy to cheaply build a deck to win with. It's much, much harder to build a fun or interesting deck to win with. 
---
Especially since that now that I'm out of college, I only have an hour or so a night to actually play, so I get about 14 hours to experiment and have fun before I'm back to the dull grind and polarized meta.
---
Have you tried secret aluneth mage in wild? It's tier 1 right now. Potion of polymorph and explosive runes do wonders in this meta. 
---
I'm a programmer. You cannot begin to understand how painful this kind of code is to me.
---
Maly velen priest is fun :)
---
If you're a competitive hs player you should've been worrying long before now.
---
[https://xkcd.com/882/](https://xkcd.com/882/) said it pretty well.
---
You haven't tried those cards
---
I have
---
I also know a lot about shaman. It's the reason Why care so much about Moorabi.
---
How EVIL! This is Dark!!! :( :( :( :(
---
Yup, love watching streamers play fun decks and then I log on and can only play a couple good decks because of my card pool and I'm not going to invest enough to play Kiblers control evolve shaman that I can't pilot to a good enough reward level since I need all the dust and gold I can get to keep playing.
---
This is true, it could be made more attractive by offering all packs to be purchasable again and you do make a good option for helping to offer more packs for free to help out.  
---
Another option would be to change arena/brawl awards to be "select a pack" as opposed to a set pack. That would be really cool.
---
All this also helps make wild more viable which, imo, becomes less viable every rotation
---
I'm honestly not really interested in wild, majority of my collection are standard cards and the cost of entry for wild is pretty high isn't it? I'm at 5 right now in standard, just trying to play some niche decks because I'm sick of the paladin/hunter/priest meta, especially Priest (why do they keep getting ridiculous single-spell board clears every expansion)
---
I love memes decks. I use Liam with Baku and 26 1-drops, shudeerwock C'thun, burgle rogue, discover paladin (a favourite of mine !), Paladin quest murlocs....
---
the first time I saw this happen i think it lost me the game but it's my favorite counter to mecha'thun priest, that and just screaming a faldori strider into the deck randomly
