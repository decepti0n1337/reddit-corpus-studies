Quest druid is my favorite deck archetype of all time. 
---
Spellstone will bounce back, it's still an insane card at 6.
---
Dang. I never finish all my quests!
---
Also god damn otk priest as today it has otked me by playing it‚Äôs legendary spell into:Velen,malygos and the elementals who reduce the cost of spells by one into double mindblast 
---
Hi reddit,
---
long time lurker, thought this was worthy to share!
---
I've been playing since beta and pretty much played through all metas since then.
---
It's been quite a journey!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Honestly curious, if your haven't played in more than 2 years, how did you find this post?
---
I don't know why people are downvoting. I had a phone that just barely met the specs for hearthstone. Quite often it would just be running so slowly or disconnect so often that every single turn I hit my rope and quite often lost games in which I needed to make more than two or three actions in a turn.
---
Quests are terrible cards that make every game play out linearly from the beginning. At least DKs and other hero cards make the game mechanically more interesting.
---
Just play odd quest warrior.  I farm the ladder up to rank 5 the last couple months with that deck.  
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/UsGs0sf
---
Yea that'll show him, post him online and call him an idiut!1!1!!
---
I get that and it is really important not to run out of eggs.  I played another game where the Hunter cubed an egg when he had a 1/1 devilsaur on board from shrink Ray. He lost three turns later because he only had a board full of eggs left. I get that cubing egg has its uses, but players need to stop doing it so mindlessly lol.
---
Nice

---
I honestly never really liked the quests that much since I felt like there was little to no counter-play. You can't really do much to delay the opponent finishing their quest (other than a little bit Rogue, but they're still gonna finish it quickly) and most of them really weren't even that good or usable. I did sort of like the Priest quest though, that one felt alright to me.
---
100%? So... two out of two?
---
I‚Äôve had success with mid-range hunter and found it can be pretty cheap to craft. I even did ok without being able to craft master‚Äôs call for a while
---
How does Fortnite esports even work?
---
Yeah mulligan has been/is one of my biggest problems always
---
Assuming you have a decent classic collection, I would focus on packs from Witchwood, Boomsday and Rastakhan. While their power level is lower than Un‚ÄôGoro, KoFT and Kobolds, those cards will be legal in standard after the April rotation.
---
You can calm it that but watch any streamer playing it(warshack,trump on YouTube) and they‚Äôll probably mention that it‚Äôs a control deck for the most part some version are more combo like but the deck that I‚Äôm playing is control
---
Marsh Drake + Potion of Madness is another one of my favorite ‚Äúmini-synergies.‚Äù
---
Why would you ever admit this publicly? Im a sore loser, this is how i throw tantrums when i lose. profit?
---
So u r the god damn priest with 1 million taunt that stop my winstreak with face hunter
---
Did it ever get out of T3?
---
Astral communion + coin Kappa
---
It's a delicate balance between quest rewards having too little impact, and winning you the game outright (rogue). The best designed quest was probably the priest one. 
---
Paying thousands of dollars to huge companies always have me the sense of pride and accomplishment that no other activity could. Is it the same for you?
---
Watch WowHobbs vids on YouTube. He loves Cho and legit uses him in real Decks. He has a ton of different decks and approaches to making him viable. Might have some ideas to help your deck go from meme to dream. 
---
Newer players are more likely to spend on loot boxes to "catch up".
---
I might've misspoken. Their reveal of it was such a terrible failure, that it boosted their competitors marketshare before it even saw the light of day.
---
Anybody knows how many different 60G quests there are? I've seen one 80G and two different 100G quests. 
---
You are shown 3 adaptations from the 8 possible. Will work until April when Un'Goro rotates
---
The proof is in the winrate, and the down- talking to the users and creators of the deck.
---
Fucking what ?
---
You want a source on what individual professional illustrators ask for ?
---
I work as a concept artist so I know quite a few but Im sure as shit not going to spend time digging out their pricings for a dickweed like you.
---
And they dont make multiple pieces for each, that is figured out at the sketching/designing phase. Which is decided by either the artist or if they really need help with, an art director who wont need more than 10 minutes at most to figure it out.
---
Shit the fact that you put in the naming portion as something that would need to be considered in the price of the card tells me how uninformed of the production pipeline you are.
---
Next time dont try to aggressively pretend to know something when you dont.
---
i guess limit the pool to 4* best and add one mana to the zombeast created, would be pretty brutal but i dont see any other way
---
That's weird, I thought Hearthstone is a literal dead game.
---
me too! Any idea what month we might be getting teasers?
---
Quest Paladin has always been my favorite.
---
do ppl rely need 2 ask this lol wtf
---
F2P btw
---
There are crazier ones...
---
Yup.  Un'Goro priest was the only time I really loved the class.  Lyra and Radiant were awesome (APM priest before APM priest.) . And Free From Amber + Medivh was indeed awesome.
---
And Secret Agent Coming through.  But holy shit that card was buuussssteddd.
---
Uhhh. Impossible!!
---
Where can I find the deck code because I am too lazy to do this myself üôÉ
---
I think a combination of making the upfront cost of Rexxar way stepper and/or changing his hero power to somewhat match Dr. Boom's hero power would be how I would tackle the problem.
---
His upfront cost is really low compared to other value DKs and his battlecry is almost worth the 6 mana in itself (Shield Block into drawing Consecration would do the same for 7 mana and both cards get played). Removing the AOE effect and/or bumping his mana cost significantly would add a weakness against aggressive decks and make playing Rexxar a low tempo play just like most other DKs.
---
Since this would still not change the problem that Rexxar can provide a huge threat every turn, one could make his hero power rotating as well. It could e.g. switch between the current Make-A-Beast hero power and others like "Give a beast +2/+2" and "Deal 2 damage".
---
Dr. Boom, Mad Genius would also be overpowered if it would let you discover a Mech every turn AND the Mechs are on average worse than Rexxar beasts AND playing Dr. Boom is a huge tempo loss that basically does nothing that turn compared to Rexxar.
---
Find another game goddamn 
---
What does Harbinger Celestia do for the deck?
---
[https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1233244-dragonhawk-flock-otk](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1233244-dragonhawk-flock-otk)
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Yup.  Thalnos was my first legendary craft.  As an F2P I saw it as a neutral card that could fit in so many decks.  And he could fit in my control and aggro mage decks.  
---
(And he was super fun in the control warlock + defile days.)
---
https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-210.html
---
I disconnected
---
Or warlocks. They've always got 2 fully pumped spell stones after playing 2 librarians. 
---
I don‚Äôt recall all the quests offhand, but they may have been better if they required interacting with your opponent. Like, ‚ÄúDestroy 3 1-cost minions ‚Äú or ‚ÄúHeal 3 different enemy minions‚Äù. You know, something that makes your opponent play differently. 
---
10 possible, isn't it?
---
+3 ATK, +3 HP, +1/+1, Deathrattle, Poisonous, Windfury, Stealth, Taunt, Divine Shield, Can't Be Targeted
---
It's leftover from when the deck was more focused on copying the opponent.  And because I opened it and wanted to use it somehow. Will probably be replaced with something else soon. 
---
&gt;calculations 
---
but isn't there also math where because the second choice has one of the potential choices removed and the third choice have 2 potential choices removed from the pool, aren't the odds just a hair higher?
---
How necesary is emeryss?
---
Just compare Rexxar to Boom:
---
* Rexxar costs 1 less Mana than Boom does.
---
* Rexxar has a strong 3 Mana spell as a Battlecry, while Boom's Aura is hardly worth 1 Mana.
---
* Boom gets 2 extra Armor, which is about a 1 Mana difference.
---
* Boom gets a more flexible but also more unreliable hero power than Rexxar does. All of Boom's options don't do anything broken, while Rexxar has access to insane board clears and massive Lifesteal effects.
---
Honestly, there's a strong chance Rexxar would still be played at 8 Mana.
---
Congrats! How badly did you want rank 1? Lol
---
This is because the card draw portion of the battlecry has to resolve before the damage to face in case of a fatigue draw. Same as Druid spellstone and Ferocious Howl, the card draw resolves, then you gain the armor and thus upgrading the spellstone.
---
Only viable quest is the warrior one and that one is a bit op imo because odd warriors use it, get 500000armor and use taunts nonstop until you get do 8dmg for 2mana hero power.
---
Its a bit cancer to play against. But the others need a rework for sure.
---
You are* safe now. She enunciates the whole word.
---
If you're using it as a combo finisher then it's fine to only run one. 
---
I think they should start with tempo of any sort. Any new quests (of course considering balance) should give a small benefit when played.
---
Like spawn a 0/2 taunt, or add 5 armor, just something like this.
---
It works for the druid one too with UI, but DOES NOT with the shaman spellstone! Ancestral knowledge won't upgrade if you draw the spellstone. Not even the 2 towards it 
---
I agree that it works as expected, but it's something you might not think of / realize.
---
Don't try and understand em
---
It's wild viable, similar to quest Shaman. [[Deathlord]], [[Piloted Shredder]], [[Sludge Belcher]], [[Shifting Shade]], [[Sylvanas]] and N'zoth is all you need. Add a [[Crystalline Oracle]] if you need an early drop, as it's identical to Shifting Shade when resummoned with Twilight's Call.
---
&gt;That's not how stats work, you don't need hundreds of thousands of games to get meaningful data out of it, it's already wayyyy more than enough
---
True but scientific studies are selected in a more controlled way in most cases. 
---
the problem is with the announcement, is that they announced a game aimed at a totally different market then hardcore pc players.
---

Equality is only going down because of even shaman which it has never been good in

They don't have them in hand they just draw them and upgrade at the same time with branching or UI or ferocious howl

Played a turn 3 High Priestess Thekal which casted Reckless Flurry leaving me at 1 hp vs a hunter. Having played thekal a few times this brawl, I always thought it'd be funny if it casted flurry after and sure as shit it happened to me lol
---
Man you must really really hate Shadow Word Death and Shadow Word Pain
---
Well we‚Äôre operating on a very different definition of ‚Äúwin condition ‚Äú and I‚Äôll leave it at that.
---
Gul‚ÄôDan 
---
Okay? And? I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre telling me this. 
---
Start in hand but make it cost 3 mana. 
---
Reckless triggered Abomination and Mecha's deaths simultaneously and THEN reckless died due to Abomination. Mecha considered Reckless still present on the board. That's what I think happened at least.
---
Maybe? I gave up on the Big Priest format already. 
---
If you rope me turn 1. That's fine, benefit of the doubt.
---
If you rope me turn 1 and turn 2, I will rope the entire game in return, regardless if you start to play quickly. I have more self control and I'm content to tilt those who try to tilt me. Turnabout and all that.
---
Otherwise, it's unintentional on my part.
---
In that case, if you drew a fatigue that caused lethal with howl, but the armor would put you out of lethal range, would you still die cause the damage is applied first?
---
Lol no I didnt man sounds fun I miss wotog meta tbh that was the most fun I had in this game
---
open two packs one a rahstakhan's rumble and one a kobolds and catacombs becuase why not? first i got high priestess jeklik then i got a golden rhok'delar being my first ever golden legendary!
---
You're getting downvoted but I've never *seen* a Fortnite tournament streamed with casters or anything like that. Granted I don't really follow it, but considering its popularity I'm sure I would have seen more on the front page of twitch if it existed? The site you used takes numbers from Twitch and YouTube only, are Fortnite tournaments streamed on another platform?  
---
I've *heard* of tournaments and winning big money from it, but are they broadcast like other esports and are people watching? Because that is what this metric is measuring. Sure if you go by [*total hours*](https://newzoo.com/insights/rankings/top-games-twitch-youtube/), Fortnite is on top, because people are watching Fortnite streamers. But in esports share... ?
---
I've seen these statistics before and would appreciate if anyone downvoting this guy could answer these questions and link to a Fortnite tournament channel at least. I'm genuinely curious to see what a professionally broadcast Fortnite tournament looks like at this point.
---
There was a fun version with quest, reno, raza, justicar, coldlight, nzoth ect. In wild where you lived through everything and they died of fatigue. It died first with jade druid and then with infinity warrior, but for a while...i did ok with that deck and had SO MUCH FUN
---
Don't worry, you can unlock the old nsfw version on blizzard's patreon
---
This is the latest version of Yes Paladin and i'm telling you boys, we aren't gonna improve much more
---
They farm midrange hunter and aggro decks. 
---
Yeah, I miss back when managing the board mattered instead of just "rush them down" or "draw your entire deck". Back then, you could draw cards without drawing suspicion and it allowed "Surprise Mothafucka" combos. While combo decks are fun, the current style of them doesn't feel as satisfying to pilot. 
---
Golden legendaries, for f2p players are essentially dust and craft whatever legendary you need for a deck. Since rotation is happening, probably best just to hold onto it until meta settles down when new expansion drops. 
---
If they get hall of fame then you get your dust and get to keep the card. 
---
No it won't. Poisonous is specifically when this minion damages another minion.
---
We will definitely have a major crisis within 2 years 
---
Sorry I don't have a better screenshot, here's the replay:
---
https://www.zerotoheroes.com/r/hearthstone/5c5fb7dbdd32a60001fb4a2d
---
Isn't Psychic Scream rotating out? 
---
Some classes were hurt by this more than others. 
---
Well shit.
---
My typical Loss is to "turn five second  wave  board flood".
---
Ye, but Mecha'Thun's deathrattle should trigger after Abomination's rattle, because of the play order. 
---
The play order matters. That's why when you combo normally, you have to play Coffin Crasher before the Abominations. Otherwise, Mecha'Thun gets pulled last and won't take damage. 
---
It just looked like Mecha'Thun's rattle didn't trigger after, but it is suppose to. 
---
Yeah like I‚Äôve played non quest shaman murloc in wild, and I don‚Äôt think the quest is what‚Äôs making the deck decent lol. It‚Äôs everyfin.

It‚Äôs really disturbing how often that happens without Brann.
---
In my honest opinion, not enough. I hate Priest with a passion. It might be the lowest winrate class, but I don't care. I want Blizzard to nerf it into the ground. I've been waiting for them to nerf Priest hard since KFT. It's the most bullshit class in my opinion. I'd rather play against and lose to any deck archetype except for Priest. Pirate Warrior? Fine. Jade druid? Fine. Aggro shaman? Fine. 
---
But dragon priest? Bullshit. Razakus priest? Bullshit. Quest Priest? Bullshit. Control priest? Bullshit. Mindblast priest? Bullshit. 
---
With the exception of aggro priest the entire class archetype is basically wait, wait, wait, KILL MY OPPONENT.
---
But in all seriousness, they're losing:
---
Radiant elemental
---
Shadow visions
---
Psychic scream
---
Twilight acolyte
---
Shadowreaper anduin
---
Spirit lash
---
Diamond Spellstone
---
Duskbreaker
---
Archbishop benedictus

---
Shadow essence
---
Twilight's call
---
Shadow ascendant
---
Mirage caller
---
Curious glimmerroot
---
Obsidian statue
---
And last, but definitely not least, Lyra the sunshard
---
And thank fucking God because all of these cards are bullshit. I don't care if priest is already tier 4, I want to see it at tier 10. 
---
Totally disagree, the card cost is big but all the quests face that. The hunter and shaman quests are specifically the ones that get destroyed by the fact that you can‚Äôt start taking board control immediately.
---
Is there anywhere I can get a valuation on the account there? Because it wasn't an ad/account trading 
---
Since you are the only person who replied before it got deleted, how much would you really value it for? 
---
this ALSO does NOT work with the paladin spellstone and the 2mana heal 4 or lay on hands :/
---
Honestly I kind of liked spellstones. Some are a bit too easy to proc, but they work best when they require a slight alteration to your deck building to support.
---
I like "packages" of cards that synergize well with each other. Makes decks feel more modular and adaptable. It's almost like having a side deck, where you can keep a core deck of 20 or so cards, while slotting in useful synergies and tech cards as the meta changes
---
The shaman one faces a similar problem. Murlocs are all about taking the board early and snowballing it, they even have one of the strongest two drops in the game, Rockpool hunter... if you already have a murloc out on turn 1.
---
Apparently quests originally cost 0 mana but in testing people were forgetting to play them and that‚Äôs why they changed it to one mana or something. Seems weird to me, and sure sucks for shaman and hunter.
---
Some people on their phones and laptops has limited battery life. 
---
Some people are impatient and will concede.
---
That's all I can think of?
---
Thats crazy. I've played since beta as well, but tbh I went through phases with how much I played. I know i have like 4k ish wins in constructed and &lt; 1k wins in arena though.
---
The most i played was when old handlock and combo druid were top tier. AKA my only golden heroes. Still never reached legend. I think i've achieved rank 3 as highest

Yes, because who would be so stupid to expect a dog to bite him if you kick it, right?

Jeez, just use a deck that can win some games... there must be some ‚Äúfun‚Äù decks to be found with a winrate around 50%...

I don't even not-believe you, it would be entirely plausible for your opponent to concede in reverence of your cheeky play.

I built a similar deck once, but with a corpsetaker-mech package (tar creeper, corpsetaker, lich king, zilliax, venomizer, missile launcher) for extra defense. https://www.reddit.com/r/Gimmickstone/comments/agxmzs/direhawk_otk_hunter/ee9vi0v/?context=3

I only ever rope when someone is being quick and heavy on the emotes. But you don't do that, right?

---
UI is one of the strongest cards in the game and mind control isn't even comparable lol
---
way too nuanced for /r/customhearthstone
---
Ok, I just watched my replay from yesterday and I did play charge second
---
I really loved the mage quest. Exodia Mage is my fav deck
---
Yea
---
What, this was just a Dr. Boom's quote :p
---
What's your reference?
---
Don‚Äôt you have to attack with the voidwalker? His play sound is ‚ÄúWhy do you call?‚Äù.
---
I one game I played tyrion and then knife juggler (because I didn't know what order was) and continued by laughing my ass of.
---
"Put your Faith in the Light" *holy music*
---
"put this apple on your head" 
---
It just seemed so derpy compared to tyrion 
---
You misspelled /r/hearthstone
---
Please why won't everyone just ThAnk oF tHe ChIldren!!! 
---
If its on purpose, I'm doing it because you are a big priest player. I rope them all the time because fuck those giant cunts. It's even better if I'm crushing them.
---
However if it's any other deck, then iv either left my desktop to get a drink or something, or forgot to press end turn. I don't rope anyone else deliberately to be negative. 
---
I've had the sound turned off since I started playing, because I only play on mobile. The minions make sounds?
---
Suck on big meat(x2)
---
Arthas was a lucky dude before all that *Revenge- Death Knight- Lich King* issue..
---
Come on, surely you knew I meant it was an auto-include in aggro/midrange decks? Shaman gets a lot of support in that area. 
---
If one card getting nerfed condemns it to the dumpster, I think that card is too powerful for the future. Not in the current meta.
---
No
---
I mean how did your minion get so buffed, I‚Äôm new :(
---
Pretty disappointing they still haven‚Äôt sorted this out seeing as how quickly people brought this up 
---
Unity. Precision. Per-imitive.
---
&gt; D3 launch was shit but you can't blame it on "attracting more casuals". 
---
They took away complexity in the name of attracting more casuals, so yes, they did ruin the game for it.
---
&gt;  Why even shit on casuals, its because of them you are able to play games because that small % of "omg i'm so hardcore" gamers aren't enough to justify your games. 
---
Oh yes, because that huge franchise Diablo really needed the extra players, as if they wouldn't have had several million players anyway, the funny thing is that their attempt at attracting casuals didn't even work, instead it just attracted Diablo fans then pissed them off when they realized the game was watered down. What is even your point here? Just being contrarian for the sake of it?
---
&gt; And plus we've seen D3 doing an 180 
---
We have? When? I guess everyone is playing D3 a lot now then, right? Oh wait, no, they aren't because the expansion was nothing more than superficial bullshit, getting people to buy it in order to fix everything but in reality it just made people play the game for a week at the start of a season then put it down until the next one because you get geared in a week and then there's nothing else to do thanks to the lack of build diversity which is down to simplified game systems.
---
&gt; HS while not my favorite game is super popular 
---
HS is dying thanks to their greedy monetization that forces people to spend ridiculous amounts of money in order to keep up, this has been an issue since the beginning and they've done nothing to change it.
---
&gt; Overwatch a game that I don't like is also very populair 
---
Also a game that's dying because they don't add content anywhere near fast enough to  keep people interested, and when they do add a new map that is pointless because their map design is atrocious and every map they have is nothing but a series of choke points with a different look to it.
---
&gt;  wow since 2008 has had a extremely good expansions and bad once 
---
What world are you living in? Cataclysm was boring garbage, MoP was good, and then every expansion since then has only gotten worse and worse as they've turned the game into more of a slot machine, as they've made changes that ruin raiding, emphasized grinding mythics all day, and there's no content that's for dedicated players, everything is just pointless.
---
But hey, that's OK, you keep defending a multi-billion dollar corporation that wants microtransactions in a sub based game, loot boxes, and retarded pricing in card games and every other shitty practice. You clearly have no real arguments.
---
Found the necropheliac
---
How about a minion that does it as a battlecry (or as its own deathrattle it does itself) to any target minion?
---
Then it could see positive use for your own minions in decks that feature a decent amount of ‚Äúshuffle in‚Äù effects.
---
The examples you gave are about the whole concept of standard format. I think the people who don't understand that should not be our standard. Blizzard trusted us tho understand that concept, but not with Murk&amp;Parrot.
---
Players have go get accustomed to wild&amp;standard at *some* point. Blizzard wants to postpone that as long as possible but I think it wouldn't be a problem if players got those Wild cards before.
---
**Also:** They could make it so that the Murk&amp;Parrort as soon as you unlocked wild mode through any other means
---
That's the only situation it's resonable, and you're still a degenrate for playing Priest, which ia consistently a problem class compared to Hunter which hasn't been a problem sunce Undertaker rotated out

I was already at rank 1 this month (see chest) but indeed, it would've been nice to have had this achievement while being legendary. Alas I ran out of wins and the competition is usually quite fierce at the beginning of the month ;)

Her

How is it like windfury+divine spirit +divine shield. Sure, its like divine shield except you can only use it on the defense, you can't buff your creature and then attack a dangerous enemy creature. As combo priest, you generally do want to trade creatures at the start so that you stay alive. 
---
 I have no idea where the windfury came from. It is nothing like divine spirit--the main purpose of divine spirit is to use in combination with inner fire for a sudden burst of damage. This does not work on this way because the 6 health is not immediate. 
---
Valeera best grill
---
Same with 0 armor shield slam
---
[[Mindbreaker]] for a start of game effect, the drawback would have to be huge, because it would hose so many decks.

1. Your minions HP (or Attack?) is reduced by half (No lesser than 1).

3/2/5 | Hero Powers are disabled.

Cards will rotate out but that doesn't stop me from voicing my frustration with Hunterstone.
---
29 health. 
---
It's not even good against the very few decks it supposedly limits, it's useless against everything else. It's ridiculous to call it OP.
---
"LET ME SHOW YOU, the arcane!" and "BEGONE!"
---
Points for figuring out which cards they are.
---
Who shit in your cheerios this morning? Its just a drawing son. 
---
I care. Not that I care about Jaina, but I dislike Puritanism.
---
But priest was given a card to resurrect two deathrattles. They may come back as 1/1s, but that never mattered if you only care about the deathrattle effect. Especially since one of their deathrattle effects tutors for more deathrattle cards from their deck. 
---
Compare that to hunters who have a 5 drop which can pull two 1 cost cards. Playing two 1 mana minions on turn 6 is pretty bad in terms of survival. 
---
[removed]
---
Boobs got hid by a new camisole for Jaina. QQ
---
Of course I understand that most people don't have the time to go pro. That's not the point. I just wanted to emphasise how ridiculous the claim that optimal play is easy was. I agree there might have been better ways to spell that one out, but come on.
---
Yes, but the elemental doesn't do anything the turn you play Jaina. If you are behind versus an aggressive deck, playing Jaina can be very risky or simply suicide since the opponent can simply push for lethal.
---
It's funny (but at the same time sad) that all these people crying about things being to 'sexualized' are the same group of people that are trying to shove acceptance of 'drag kids' (aka sexualized children) down our throats. 
---
Welp, now I don't remember what warrior's one is. Summons taunts, that's all I've got.
---
I never called it OP.  And if it's not intended to be good against combo decks, why not just make it card draw?
---
 honestly the worst thing about this picture isn't the skin shown, it's that lipstick.

9 mana gain 5 armor. Nice.

5/4/2 | Battlecry: Destroy a minion with 7 or more Attack.

Yet again I'm thankful as hell that reddit isn't in charge of balancing.
---
Down down you go sir
---
Town of dustville, population: Keening Banshee
---
I think they are just strawmanning to seem important and show that they know so much about current events 
---
10 mana 0/1 with a battlecry maybe. Start of Game would just be laughable.
---
Forgot to mark NSFW
---
Laptops, all of you!
---
That's heavily situation dependent. If you have a board, you can heal at once. If you don't at all, at turn 9 against aggro, you've been playing a weird game where the opponent traded everything *and* brought you into lethal range. Not saying that situation doesn't happen but it seems farfetched to make a rule from it.
---
Wow, this really does show how excessive an amount of priests there are.
---
The only reason I see for Leeroy would be that Blizzard keeps moving away from Charge, however, there‚Äôs way too many Charge cards in the Classic set for that to be a valid reason for one specific card.
---
I could see something like King Krush getting moved to hall of fame just because hunters have so many ways to ‚Äùcheat‚Äù out the card, the card isn‚Äôt a problem as such, it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs never really played the way I think they intended.
---
*dies in jaina*
---
Yeah that would also be censorship, but that doesn't mean that what they did with Jaina isn't. Not everything needs to be extreme.
---
It‚Äôs more that every single priest runs Shadow Visions
---
I wonder what's the longest time period that mountain giant hasn't seen play. Feels like I've seen it in most metas since beta. Cards like that make me wish for a rotating classic set. 
---
Ofcourse Reddit is not in charge of balancing. The least you could do is write your objection. I am bored with the game at its current state.
---
I don't believe I mentioned free speech at any point. The concept of censorship applies to more than just speech.
---
"Neither snow, nor rain, nor witch."
---
Maybe in an elemental deck, but the most popular mage decks don't run many elementals.

That sh*t op they are probably nerfing it in the next update so i‚Äôll hold on to it if i were you.

Holy moley, I don't even know where to start here
---
Making something look a bit more family friendly isn't puritanism. Theres still cleavage in the new portrait. 
---
requires a dragon, is in priest and not warlock which has a vastly superior hero power
---
still super good, dont get me wrong
---
By my frozen heart!
---
Your comment is pretty much a definition of dying on a hill that‚Äôs just not worth taking. 
---
I don't see how a piece of clothing is an act of censorship 
---
It‚Äôs good to be understood, blizzard should help us players.How am I supposed to reach legend with my decks who are exponentially getting worse?Blizzard is making me spend more money on their game.
---
The greatest comeback 
---
I know right. 
---
If it weren't for this sub, I wouldn't have even noticed, let alone cared.
---
In set reviews I was a sleeper...
---
Thnxs I‚Äôll got with the deathrattle deck
---
But the secrets give me power in the early game if I won‚Äôt have low card minions don‚Äôt you think so?
---
Thanks

thanks a lot

Hold on, so that wierd thing she's got going on with her hair up top . . . I always thought it was her hair pulled up through a hole or something and that'd why it matches her hair colour. But in this picture the colours don't match. So it's just a plume attached to her hood? Why the fuck would someone want one of those if they're supposed to be sneaking around? Fucking unplayable.

MUSHROOM POWEEER!

MUSHROOM PUUNCH!

He played Coffin Crasher and triggered my Explosive Runes, summoning him from his hand.
---
You NO take candle
---
Mojo master zihi also. Just play him the turn before they empty their deck and you have four turns of them doing basically nothing. 
---
Shut up murloc
---
Well you‚Äôre screwed
---
I get the sentiment and have done it before, but I try not to do the fire on fire thing. "Never argue with an idiot, they will just drag you down to their level and beat you with experience". Doesn't matter what idiots I run across in life, I'm always trying to be awesome. (Failing more often than not)

There's nothing subjective about this. A fully clothed woman is 100% family friendly.

Get up and fight, fa*got!

Ya it‚Äôs the prep-coin of battlecries. 
---
nice

King Mukla
---
So the hunter never has a play on turn 1, cannot hero power on turn 2, and hopes to play a 2 mana beast that sticks until 3. Then on turn 3 you hero power and float 1 mana.
---
Seems weaker than the current implementation of Dinomancy.
---
Wait, so the definition of fully clothed is 100% objective?
---
I don't have lich king, I have the dust to craft but I don't wanna because he's rotating out, is there a good replacement for it? I'm using primordial drake rn
---
wow
---
concede costs 3 mana though
---
the other player gets 2 turns and then you get 3.
---
[It was rumored](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/87kaxh/lord_godrey_original_art_vs_witchwood_one_did_we/) that [[Lord Godfrey]] had changed art due to China‚Äôs censors, too.

7/4/4 | Battlecry: Deal 2 damage to all other minions. If any die, repeat this Battlecry.  
---
They gave her a boob apron. https://youtu.be/pvLrfnQjF9s
---
Literally no shaman lol feelsbadman
---
yes, imo it looks tacky as hell
---
Yeah literally only the most braindead of aggro players will actually hold that opinion. These people don't really care about concepts like game balance, they just want to win on turn 4 every match. 
---
Nerf doomsayer blizz! It's a classic card thus it shouldn't be played that much!
---
&gt; Everyone else making jokes about it.
---
Scroll down this thread if you really think no one's mad about it.
---
Wait, you're telling me other people aren't fapping to Malfurion?
---
When minions die I get cheaper...
---
I don't play odd paladin, but way to make assumptions
---
It's just great how every time someone gets him to more than 3 attack, there's a post with an IrOnIc AnD oRiGiNaL title. 
---
Let‚Äôs get this party staaarteeeedüê≤üê≤üê≤
---
yea but its about the vibe. it sounds funny to use happy new year randomly
---
actually makes me laugh when something happens then HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
---
The wiki confirms it's "Primitive".
---
Doomsayer to 3, Mountain Giant to 14. C'mon Blizz, these are *playable* classic cards here. 
---
Without a rank provided this is pretty meaningless. Not to mention that 8 games isn't even anything near enough to say "it works". 
---
If you put your heart in the game and are rank 20 all decks can be viable
---
If you want to go to war alone against an army, I won‚Äôt stop you. Just be prepared for downvotes.
---
Also note how I never saif you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Sound the bells
---
Don't listen to facts. This sub figured out anything possible about this game. 
---
**"This is our town, scrub"**
---
**^("Yeah, beat it")**
---
&gt;So the hunter never has a play on turn 1
---
Duh, just play quest hunter - then you *always* have a T1 play.
---
Probably Mal'Ganis. 
---
Every time I play dragons on odd warrior ysera gets stuck in my hand until I either already won or she won't do anything useful. I use amalgam instead and only one roaster and put in Zilliax for the other slot. Amalgam Zilliax is a solid play. 
---
They downvote you because you are right. Stay strong.
---
Do you want to make a post on Reddit about rush minions getting stuck? Because that's how you end up doing it.
---
Someone hasn't played with a female blood elf in wow before
---
&gt;Maybe they're targeting a demographic in China.
---
The Hearthstone-playing demographic everywhere is mostly straight men, and I'm pretty sure straight chinese men like boobs just as much as other straight men.
---
Thank you
---
I crafted alex forever ago and played it in many control decks.
---
Maly was the last legendary I got to complete classic and I never had issues having fun!
---
After the recent balance changes, Malygos Rogue and Cubelock both had a brief resurgence.
---
oh you meant this year. Then I agree.
---
You hearing a lot of protests about popular culture from Christian moms these days? Cause I'm only hearing it from the new left
---
"DO YOU LIKE TO PLAYYYY WITH POISSON??"
---
oh it rains
---
Wait one second, like you, I‚Äôm going to falsely and stupidly assume that cards are either top cards or bad cards. And yes, none of those are top cards compared to Keleseth, Baku, Genn, Shadow Visions, DK Rexxar, prenerf Creeper, etc. The difference? Creeper only sees play in one deck and isn‚Äôt crazily powerful (obviously, according to you, if it isn‚Äôt crazy powerful it must mean it‚Äôs hot garbage so wahhhhh) in that deck even. 
---
Some troll got a guy to whine on redidt. Success &lt;trolling continues&gt;
---
Happy feast of.... Hello. 
---
I know it. And so do you. But since you're pretending the opposite, it means you're trolling. I do not entertain trolls. Now fuck off.
---
No, the technology just isn't there. This would have taken millions of dollars and years to complete.
---
Dumb troll.
---
The world is waiting
---
Jaina was already designed. What we're discussing is just regressive stuff.
---
How the hell do u have 39k golds, reported for hacks !! monkablyat
---
Only 2 things I can think of is together with faceless cubing something strong.. or cubing the direhorns.. I wouldn‚Äôt include it
---
Lol 
---
I remember people saying that the card had been made completely unplayable when they removed 3 attack.
---
Too safe for work, need to go deeper
---
I don't spend that much but even if someone buys every released expansion, the cost is not that from the current cost of a regular netflix perscription.
---
Ironically some people frown upon spending money on a video game but yet will spend almost twice as much on netflix + hulu.  Meanwhile I am getting more enjoyment out of HS than I do out of netflix.
---
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM READY! I‚ÄôM NOT READY!‚Äù
---
I hate how they just drop a 2/14 divine shield and they just say gg cause they now u cant deal with it and next turn you are dead.
---
8 mana 2/14 divine shield minion: fun, interactive and such a creative card
---
Aka: "Thighs&gt;Tits"
---
In my opinion the best intro in the game, just epic.
---
*stomp, stomp, stomp...*
---
Eeh?
---
*WAAAAAAAARGHH!!!!!*
---
OH FK
---
I really hope leeroy is NOT HOF'd because I think it is good for keeping the meta from becoming too OTK or control heavy.  I don't have a major problem with maly either personally and none of the recent maly decks are OP BUT it does limit design space so wouldn't surprise me if they HOF it.  I do sometimes wonder if they would HOF baku/genn or not actually (I'd much rather that happen than a nerf).  Prep could also be HOF'd but hopefully will not be.
---
Anyway the way blizz has been going they'll prob HOF hex or something lol.
---
sadly none atm
---
Craft them with dust.
---
You just craft them like you'd craft any other card. Both are used on loads of wild decks, so if you want to play wild it's a good choice. 
---
Card backs have been expansion-themed on a number of occasions; in addition to the three Death Knight card backs, we also had three card backs for the Gadgetzan gangs, to say nothing of the one-off card backs like Naxxramas, Tournament Grounds, Un'Goro Mystery, etc. While these card backs are always patched into the game prior to the release of the related expansion, it has never happened that the card back was added before we even knew what the related expansion was.
---
Blizz should hire you to write every patchnotes, lmao
---
is it the only battlecry or he just got unlucky?
---
I think the current TB is flip a coin it just takes 20 minutes for that coin to land.
---
I can't remember exactly, but I reckon he had an Amara in the pool. 
---
She's still bae &lt;3
---
Each set has its own pity timer and we'd need specific numbers to say how unlucky or not you were, but no, they haven't removed the pity timers,
---
Same shit, different day.
---
Prep. Coin. Concede. 
---
So basically you said nothing at all of value?
---
I guess thanks for saying nothing?
---
Yeah Shaman's requires planning and even deckhuilding to fully make use of its effect.
---
You can just slap Deathstalker into literally any non-hero power based deck and its practically the best possible card. Infinite value that adapts to the situation... on top of an anti-board and armor battlecry.
---
Yes, she does look better, but if they wanted to change it i would prefer a new picture of her to censoring the current one..
---
7 mana lose the game is not good rng
---
r/threewordseach
---
that burn was fatal
---
I was disappointed to discover this mechanic with Jaraxxus and Guldan
---
(Understanding 10 is the typical counter)
---
Witchwood 6/10
---
Boomsday 12/10
---
Rumble 8/10
---
All prior to NYB and pulled 1 legendary from Boom.
---
I just wish they had the common decency to put it in the patch notes.
---
It's impossible to remain confident how the game works when they keep rolling out undocumented changes.
---
If you didn't notice, you're missing some punctuation and check yo spelling lmao.
---
It's not a bad sentiment but at current people are really annoyed at the gutting of the Classic set, so it's an impolitic time to suggest nerfing or rotating more of them.
---
That‚Äôs some Razzle Dazzle.
---
it's kind of unclear what you're arguing..
---
&gt;WotOG2
---
Ulduar? 
---
Uldir?(Probably not this one since we just did trolls), 
---
Azeroth cosmology expansion? 
---
Nazjatar/Nzoth expansion as a WoW tie in? 
---
Void expansion? (Featuring a warlock legendary that creates 3 voidlords when it dies)
---
You've spelled: You misspelled r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Mountain giant will see play as long as Warlock‚Äôs hero power draws cards
---
well i think it's fucking ridiculous that someone tries to get 20euro a hour for teaching hearthstone when there isn't anything at all to teach in hearthstone. and if someone else argues there is then please tell me what.
---
It's not perfect and there is room for improvement. I commented at a few key points. It's a nice run though. I hope you enjoy.
