Despite all the memes, you usually do not want to go all face in the first handful of rounds. The early game goes the same in pretty much all matchups-Establish a good board, remove their stuff with your weapons and try to maximize how many stats you can put per turn (Toxic Reinforcements is a tricky exception that depends on the matchup). One thing to remember is to almost never "trade down", like sending Misha into a minion-your opponent will have to deal with it and you get some juicy face.
---

---
By the time you get to turn 4, you should have a decent pile of threats and damage in. This is where it breaks up by matchup and what you're holding. Got two kill commands and an equipped bow? Face is the place. If not, do you have the tools to keep piling up stats? Then do so! If it's a mech-based build, never leave a mech standing. Zilliax can turn games around on its own.
---
If you're facing another aggro deck, the board state might be a bit trickier, and likely either one deck has snowballed out or you both have damage sent to the face. Knowing your matchup is key. Against warlock, for example, I like to keep unleash the hounds and explosive trap, since they tend to fill boards well and these cards can swing the game. Each turn you don't have lethal, ask yourself: "What can I afford to leave up, what burst damage could they have left?" Finishers include bloodlust for shaman, soulfire for warlock, and leeroy/shadowstep for rogue. Likewise, your own finishers are usually kill commands. They all have different setup conditions and critical turns, and so should be countered differently. If you feel safe against dying yourself, then you can try to finish them off. 
---
Face hunting may seem toxic and braindead, since all the opponent ever sees is "me go face", but there are still critical decisions to be had under the hood. Happy hunting!
---
---
---
I love this sm
---
You have kronx in hand and so can clear that next turn, stop complaining that you losing to the top deck, while are playing the worst of the expansion.
---
But aren't you glad there is a new bundle in the shop? Hmmm?
---
Works for me
---
I've hand this hand before and then I topdecked Anka on 5 :)
---
Likely you will be forced to play his decks in wild.
---
I hope he will rotate to wild, but that his decks will remain playable in standard
---
Alternately they could give each class 1 or 2 wild recipes that get updated each expansion for him to pull from and add a new version of him to the classic set
---
Amazing Deck. Rogue and Shaman are basically freewin. Lost vs a Shaman wo highrolled mogu into deathwing on turn 3. Disgusting. Havent matched Warrior, mage or priest yet. Lost vs a Paladin with Mass heal (the Drake who heals for 8 and lay on hands). The mirror is decided by who goes first or who draws better. Overall very fun to play. Its fast its fun.
---
huffer also go face

Token druid is pretty fun, plus the tree in the store is awesome haha i've loved tree druid ever since i started playing, i got the best luck and got goru in the packs, it's not too heavy on dust, i at least run a version which only uses vargoth and Goru as the legendaries.   
---
Can't speak for paladin, i ended up dusting a lot of stuff to make a quest paladin last expac but got bored after just a few games, it's super slow and would never survive in this face hunter shaman meta
---
wait what!! youre getting mad thats someone found a counter to your extremely powerfull deck... what a shame
---
They needed to release the new holiday pack sale before the holidays but they know they will get destroyed by the community  for trying to sell pack before addressing the shaman problem. So they just throw together a quick patch and call it a year.
---
Depends on the matchup/meta. 
---
I'm maining Highlander Mage on ladder above rank 5 atm, and I have something like an 80% winrate vs the no-quest version, and the reverse ratio vs. quest. Quest just has way too much for me to deal with when it all comes together, no-quest is much more manageable. 
---
If the rogue/hunter anti-shaman meta stays this aggressive, you'll be right, but if the meta changes (which it might), which version is preferable will change overnight.
---
If you went 9-7 playing with Priest no less, how could you possibly describe your opponent’s decks as being broken?
---
&gt; I hate to nitpick
---
Yet here we are...
---
hey you guys think its safe to craft anka? i had a golden version of her but i dusted it a few months ago like an idiot...

---
[I've dabbled](https://i.imgur.com/kbv9oHv.png).
---
I do agree with the name of your deck
---
This is some pretty strong aggro though. Board clears work against you now because of that side quest.
---
Yeah, playing against aggro decks or something even playing aggro decks is pretty boring, everything happens so fast that you don't get to actually play the game, it's just 6 turns of hitting face and then they either win or concede. I don't understand how people get any enjoyment from the game this way.
---
It’s so true lol
---
I’m talking about the general philosophy on how they nerf things, dumbass. They usually don’t incline to nerf cards  above rare. I reach legend a lot of times and have enough knowledge to talk about their stupid balancing work over and over again
---
I hate playing against Rogue almost as much as Shaman, super strong in this meta.
---
Lol really? Complaining as if a diverse meta should happen instantly? Not thinking the new meta could combat the popular decks in some way? Your way of thinking is too catastrophic.
---
Fair enough. I could have sworn they posted the Doombringer nerf along with HoF for Baku and Genn, that they said they were ok with everybody getting some extra dust. My guess is accounting shows that selling overpowered cards more than makes up the loss associated with the follow up nerfs.

Going to be a sad day when frodan moves on from HS, I would imagine he has lots of opportunities and won't be much longer before a better one comes along.  HS just feels like it's in constant decline.
---
looks like an aggro warrior. you can sort of see that he won the game with Grommash + Inner Rage + Bloodsworn Mercenary for 20 damage. His hand is another Bloodsworn Mercenary, a Battle Rage and two cards I can’t really identify.
---
This is so amazingly well done and in theme. Really great.
---
No he died with the nerfs today
---
Brainless control decks counter it.......
---
I did even shaman lol
---
"The nerfs have NOT betrayed me!"
---
dude that would be awesome wild looks really fun to me but also really hard to get in to.
---
mmm...sad to hear. I haven't gotten on yet.
---
Playing for several years but only made it to lvl 9 warrior. What a scrub!
---
They took a big risk, changing some cards just before a long Holiday. It could pave the way to a new OP deck, and it would take weeks before they do something about it...
---
combo priest still slappin hard tho
---
Just play aggro hunter lol
---
Yep. Not afraid of Shaman even before the nerf. Just gonna keep winning before next nerf
---
But the Druid is sitting in a dark room with a big red button called embiggen into breath of dreams (x2) and chuckling evilly.
---
They would first have to recognize the class exists.
---
Priest has been and will continue to be a joke. Anytime it was not a joke, it got hit with nerfs
---
They know making priest strong is bad for this game. No one enjoys queueing into priests since the class identity is “how do I bullshit my way through a victory “
---
They need to re design the core of the class to fix this class. That’s too much effort for this dev team that already struggles as it is.
---
Im calling ut now. The 3,2 dragon that gives you a random legendary. Will be put in with dragons
---
&gt;Arena feels too much like an RNG crapshoot where you never get offered any strong cards while your opponents have a ton of them.  
---
That would imply there is a system at play that knows to only offer you in particular crap cards and your opponent great cards.   
---
Couldn't be because maybe you're just bad?  
---
&gt;But there seems to be very little incentive to actually play Battlegrounds  
---
It's a game ... how about the fucking fun of playing it?
---
what you said about players dying and their minions going back to the pool is 100% correct, one dev clarified it here on Reddit but I don't have the link source rn
---
I understand but I don’t at the same time wtf
---
The true answer here is primalfin lookout  (+Brann) when PL generates cards he adds them to the pool, so every one you get dilutes the pool with more and more murlocs. 
---
This is why pre-nerf of PL it was so easy to run murlocs, the pool was so full
---
Perfectly valid when OP is bitching while playing what might as well be an autocomplete deck

---
No, he spelled "CHADowreaper" correctly
---
I wish these decks performed better as I adore it, but it's just not top tier at all
---
Had one used against me, didn't seem like good value, this variant resolves around ignoring taunts mostly so silence won't do too much, especially since people often double taunt up.
---
When a player dies their minions go back to the pool, and when you sell a golden copy 3 minions go back to the pool. Discovered minions are also from the same pool.
---
p much exactly.

Razakus Priest is all time favorite HS deck for sure. It was the perfect blend of control and combo, flexible due to the highlander aspect, and super fun to play. I'll never have that much fun playing a card game ever again.
---
It is indeed the same artist. He's a genius.

So far my opponents have evolved into deathwing 100% of the time. I wish I were joking.

Maybe even beats Shaman if you know the in an outs, this came in at 73% winrate from rank 5-legend

That's the joke

How so?

You might know of making copies of scion but nobody i have seen is aware that spirit of the rhino is amazing now.

Instead of complaining, let’s hear your suggestion on balancing a class with at least 3-4 meta decks right now, most of which use vastly different cards.

I didn't say winrate, I said played winrate. So when the card gets played it wins 65% or those games. I have beaten it when it has high rolled. Repeatedly. It is in no way comparable to Barnes. It's a fair card. Maybe even too fair.
---
The nerf doesn't do shit
---
Poor priest, not even included in the pic
---
Excellent. I'm starting to get why I'm not good at battlegrounds.
---
Brightwing pulled him shudderwock then he got all the invokes and scions
---
Lmao that explanation covers 99% of decks then. All decks care about face damage, considering you win the game by reducing the opponent's face to 0.
---
Are you slow or something?
---
I only got to rank 2 before getting bored and hanging up the spurs even with a positive win rate so I'll have to take your word for it but on the surface it seems really dubious pirate would outrace. They've got ideally 2 0 mana 2/2's and a slightly clumsy but sturdy pair of Ships Cannons. I would think that between those 4 and Captains, they'd likely have to draw an absolute minimum of 2 if not more like 3 pieces before turn 7 to put on enough pressure, meanwhile the entirety of face hunter's deck is poised to push damage very fast.
---
I'm also unsure about Dwarven on 1, it doesn't help you kill the opponent any faster, just sacrifice face damage for board control whereas a turn 1 quest means they're starting the game at between 22-24 health. It's the most amount of damage you can deal for 1 mana.
---
my boyfriend on the right

You're playing pirate warrior. Shut up

That was the first useful thing you've said. Thank you. Also, cute cats.

Another awesome video! That explain why they call themselves Blizzard Entertainment rather than Blizzard Gaming.

&gt; little by little you gathered your exodia pieces
---
It was literally 2 cards and then for the rest of the game all of your cards had 2 damage slapped on them for free. Why people pretend Raza Priest was some 300IQ deck I'll never understand. It was basically just "board clears, card draw, and death knight" like Big Spell Mage from KnC.
---
The deck is fine still. Mogu is a lot harder to play but mutating in to a 10 drop is really nice. I keep on getting Deathwing.
---
I think it’s because of the new patch the new hero (from the new patch from pc) is going to crash on mobile because the update have no ETA.
---
He doesn't have rush
---
I just can’t agree on the voices of Piest Galakrond. I can’t talk for the english voice acting, as I play in franch, but he has clearly my favorite voices lines in all the game. Like the « Ooooh, what a shaaaaaame ... » (I don’t exactly know what he say in english, but that’s the idea) on the oops button have the possibility to drive anyone crazy.
---
Vegan Important People?
---
It’s a really fun deck. I run Psychmelon, Zephrys, Elise, Sathrovarr, and Phaoris in mine, for the potential infinite healing with Floop. Not the most consistent and usually dies to aggro but lots of fun when it works.
---
It has to be dropped from Murloc Shaman now. Even Murloc Raider is better now
---
golden brann triples battlecry.
---
Mind Blast Priest was the Hearthstone deck that stole my heart. It's a control deck, but instead of obnoxiously drawing out the late game it brings a climactic finish. There's just something so satisfying about winning through pure burn after after holding off your opponent. 
---
And then Mind Blast was Hall of Famed with a bullshit blog post about class identity. 
---
Fuck "class identity." Team 5 isn't Wizards of the Coast, they don't have a well-laid out color pie where every mechanic has a well-thought-out place. They castrated my favorite class.
---
I’ve never once gotten one of these emails and I’ve been subbed to them for years.
---
It also doesn't change the fact that the quest version is still the inferior version and that there are counters to both versions, but people would rather complain instead of play them.
---
Bob is a damn liar.
---
Ham is like bacon.
---
Well the argument is not that one card is better,it's that one card is so incredibly much better than it's astounding. Two Mana less and draw a card bundled with comparable stats.
---
&gt; They get to play the “if you’re deck has no duplicates” cards that are broken. 
---
you what
---
&gt; Dont forget \~30 new cards coming in january 
---
:o I didn't even know they were putting new cards in. Will they be craftable or can you only get them from buying the solo adventure?
---
You people are never happy about anything. Making Mogu 9 mana makes it almost impossible to get an early Mogu + Mutate like before, unless your opponent is playing into it, which of course makes any card good. A turn 6+ 10 drop is way more reasonable than a turn 4 8 drop. That's assuming you even have Mutate, without it Mogu simply costs 2 more mana. That's massive.
---
yeah, I'm far from the best arena player, but the dragon discovers just feel so good to get right now. by far my best luck has been with druid; the 648 taunt discover boy feels absolutely amazing to get and play, and cards like shrubadier and treenforcements feel great for the earlygame(especially if you can lead them into power of the wild)
---
she likes to eat meat and doesn't like vegetables but he wants to prepare a balanced meal
---
&gt;  Making Mogu 9 mana makes it almost impossible to get an early Mogu + Mutate like before, unless your opponent is playing into it, which of course makes any card good.
---
That's quite literally what I just said. More people are playing into it b/c the decks that counter Shaman (especially Hunter) flood the board. I swear... You people are never happy about anything.
---
You wouldn't understand
---
Greedy is not the best word to use indeed, maybe a glass cannon deck?. My point is that trying to win with only high end cards or trying to win as fast as possible with the lowest curve possible are both sort of the same sin. But people tolerates hyper-aggro way more than greediness. There where the double standard lies.
---
Which legendaries? How did they change echo? Also, how did I not know about this?

Yeah, the post was pretty well tongue in cheek hah.

---
I do agree.
---
&gt; But thanks so much for at least saying "let's see what happens" lol, everyone else seems to be so sure they know exactly what will happen.
---
I can and must likely to be wrong, but I like making predictions, but I'm not a time traveler so is dumb for me that I know it will be like that. 
---
&gt; (Also, isn't it 3 shaman cards? Corrupt Elementalist, Sludge Slurper and Mogu Fleshshaper)
---
I see Mogu Fleshshaper change as a buff, and I think I may be right on this one, his winrates are going up according to HSstats, but is too early to make conclusions yet. In a couple of weeks or so we will know what happened.
---
Cards with echo can't be reduced 0 mana.
---
Not dead just slower.
---
I feels you, sometimes i have this very nice fucking board and i face the one guy who has an OP board twice and he makes me finish last while you know you'de be top 3 normally

It was given out free during Blizzcon, I guess the card still is a freebie now.

Just play any control deck with heals, it's a really bad deck that's only doing well cause it punishes gala shaman and deathrattle rogue

I’ll still sit at rank 17 playing albatross priest and no one can stop me

do you even see what minion that is? colossus of the moon. reborn? ringing any bells?
---
Its a visual glitch, if there are two seperate copies in the deck list it means you are missing one
---
its a meme
---
I didnt even know there was a post on there about the deck, if i saw it previously id forgotten, the meme is more generally about the subreddit, not a particular post :)

1. Warpath divine shield off - 2 mana

2. Warpath damage it - 2 mana

3. Execute it, it reborns with divine shield and 1 life - 2 mana

4. Warpath divine shield off - 2 mana

5. Warpath 1 damage, it dies - 2 mana

It's the only card (let alone legendary) I ever crafted golden. Think of the gold-value! It's 30 golden cards excluding cards generated by other cards, all for the low price of 3200 dust!!
---
Why was his board that wide? 
---
Reason for cropping out the rank? :)))
---
I think you are kind of missing the point. No one doubted that Shamans Win Rate would go down with these changes. The problem is that only face hunter and pirate warrior actually improved their matchups against shaman. Midrange and Control decks still have abysmal chances of beating it.
---
Yeah just 10 mana with 6 mana /s
---
This has to be a meme at this point
---
Just spam control warrior. It is the perfect deck now.
---
*Italian hand gestures intensify*
---
There are a ton of decks that beat face hunter, it's no where close to galakrond. You don't have go the uber control route, you can also just win the board.
---
I agree there is no much variety anymore in builds..  But arent demons stronger right now? Also i feel people are playing less murlocs.. maybe it works better now to force murlocs.
---
Buff or not, the "nerf" didnt do much good if we are still last. *sad priest noises*

No, thanks!

I like Hearthstone, not Yu-gi-oh!

Also note OP seems to be playing rogue, there must've been a lot of BS involved.  I would very much like to know the full story here, it looks incredible.
---
Probably just for rotation; I’ve got to play him 7 times so far and got first place 5 of the 7, his ability to level fast doesn’t seem like much but the extra gold coupled with the fact that you get first pickings in the pool of minions make him at least top 15 imo.

Ok but how cam he win without shirvallah to holy wrath, not saying its an absolute counter but its most definitely the best we have right now.
---
You are constantly playing a downhill game, that's the point of aggro.  They make your life total go down until you lose.
---
If you want to beat face decks, play more heal and taunt, don't run into Explosive Trap, etc.
---
Its obviously a main face huntard player, playing mage.
---
THX
---
Why is it poor? Your offered cards are not affected by your opponent. It’s not like LoL’s battleground mode where you gain more money/rewards from winning, which means a system like this would snowball you to a quick loss.
---
It's fine, the meta will adjust. There are plenty of decks that regularly beat it. People just need to get used to the board mattering again, which is what galakrond took away.
---
I assume the next big BG update will roll out with the event that’s coming soon.
---
My point is you play a bad deck so sometimes you cant react fast enough and it lead into this scenario (also your opp highroll with colossus)
---
You still can clear this : warpath 2 times (4 mana) -&gt; execute (2mana) -&gt; coin + whirlwind (remove divine shield) -&gt; atk with weapon. Take 10 dmg but you survive

  Bruh.... don’t blame bob.
---
agreed, as a Polish guy I'd never mistake these two especially as the word for 'rouge' in polish is 'róż' which is pronounced almost exactly the same as the original
---
I had a game earlier where i took 33 damage from a highrolling Toki who got brann and a huge direhorn early, before most people had even gone up to tavern 4. Straight from like 3rd to 8th place and all the progress from last 3 games gone.
---
Sometimes I wonder if there's any point in upgrading the tavern
---
What decks work well against it because I feel like I’ve tried everything
---
It's because winning games makes people feel like they played well even if they were just being carried by overpowered cards. Having said that though at least raza priest had a high skill ceiling, I remember points where it was around 50% wr on ladder but busted in tournaments. Gala shaman is just playing your cards that are better than your opponents cards for no reason.
---

8/8/8 Dragon | Battlecry: Play all cards your opponent played last turn.  
---
I played a lot of handlock in the first few days and felt like I always had an answer to galakrond shaman from nether to dark skies to zeph.
---
Face Hunter decks of old had to play Owl and/or Hunter's Mark, this current iteration of Face Hunter is by far the greediest version of the deck I've ever seen. But it makes sense given the meta
---
Bi weekly changes would be a dream. To bad Blizzard will never do it.
---
Imo I wanted the faceless rush minion to go down to a 3/3 for balance and flavor sake, but such is life
---
My man!
---
&gt; Edit: downvoted while I literally did this. Lol this sub, never change
---
Because anecdotal evidence is not the alpha and omega for determining what people can and should be capable of in a general sense.
---
Or, [in your way of dealing with disagreement:](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ecqjpo/is_blizzard_avoiding_serious_nerfs_because_of_the/fbd57ut/?context=3) it's hilarious how wrong you are, rofl.
---
Community is like ''MORE NERFS, FASTER NERFS'' . At the same time the community has no idea how balancing works and that lot of nerf periods means a lot more expensive Hearthstone. 
---
Still Blizz has to do a huge apology about how this expansions was released.... What are we supposed to expect, get a nerf period per month?
---
What we need is not nerfs but buffs there are like 4 really good classes and 5 trash tier.
---
Maybe mage needs so e love then because after playing around the 10 drop, 2 sets of buffed wolves &amp; gala, the shudder turn cant be answered unless puzzle box pulls RNG shenanigans to save the game, which in itself it's just stupid.
---
If we have a Treant Hero I think we don't have an excuse to not have a dragon hero. And human Deathwing doesn't count
---
I really want this boy.. any chance he'll come back again once or should I just get the 25 dollar bundle
---
Mage just isnt good against the current meta. That doesnt mean the shaman nerfs werent good.

I mean 10 games is a meaningless sample size and the deck is proven to be inconsistent and bad if it doesn’t highroll but ok
---
9 copies? You must have opened a bunch of packs.
---
Tier 1 deck? In this meta! HA!
---
How often do you play shaman? I don’t play it all that often but even I know 9 mana mogu will be infinitely harder to drop
---
DO DO DO DOOO, DO DO, DOOOOOOOOOO*
---
This is disingenuous at best.
---
Galakrond curves like a Midrange deck?
---
It's turn 1 plays were Sludge Slurper which is now a Cabal Rat that comes down a turn earlier and Invocation which is often saved later. 
---
Turns 2 and 3 were _Novice Engineer, Far Sight and Manatide Totem_. Hardly what we consider to be midrange power plays.
---
It's best early game play was Mogu and that was hit hard and made to be played around far easier now.
---
Comparing its board control status with Zoo is just off. Zoo trades through buffs and deathrattles. They're able to leave bodies behind. That Shaman 2/1 rush is not going to survive a trade. It's tempo-oriented board control doesn't even appear until Turn _4_.
---
Galakrond Shaman is a Value deck that takes off in the mid-game with bombs as finishers. Control crushes Aggro, they're not meant to beat Value oriented decks. The nerfs were intended to slow it down and make it susceptible to Aggro and it has done exactly that.
---
looking at matchup data on hsreplay face hunter has a lot more unfavorables than pre-nerf galakrond shaman.  
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/355/face-hunter#tab=matchups  
---
five of nine classes have a deck that counters it harder than holy wrath paladin countered galakrond shaman. do not mistake face hunter being stronger against the particular deck(s) you are playing for the deck being stronger against the entire field.
---
No they are not.
---
Min input comment for min input post.
---
you can call out the devs all you want for not balancing properly. But you simply cannot begrudge the players for playing a powerful (legal) deck, especially when you consider that the entire point of playing in the ladder is to rack up wins and get to legend.
---
Dude, you're just insulting me because a term means something you don't want it to. It's very common and well accepted.
---
"Morally bankrupt" for playing what you want rofl.
---
Oh dear.
---
8/30 cards in galak shaman and 6/30 cards in every other shaman deck got nerfed. I feel that's pretty serious.
---
People are being silly if they consider any of the nerfs jokes- yes, the cards are still playable, but other than faceless corruptor everything took a solid hit.
---
Nope, I'm criticising the ridiculousness of the term, but "insulting" you because of your ridiculous inability to grasp its flaw *and* your use of it.
---
If you swung and missed with using silly jargon when it wasn't necessary, not a problem.
---
But then you doubled down and called everyone else stupid. Which is pretty hypocritical.
---
If highlander mage was actually a decent control deck, then I’d give this to you...it’s not though...it’s really not.
---
And Deathrattle Rogue and Hunter do.
---
Depends on the draw. I've started running Swamp Leech and a Sunfury Protector to stabilise until they run out of resources.
---
Daryl would be better represented by a token-generating minion or a divine shield minion. Something like Alley Cat or Shielded Minibot.
---
Weren't they gonna change it so you could fsce the same opponent every 3 rounds?
---
As long as they’re not reducing the drop rates for packs bought with gold, why should it matter? A change like that doesn’t make the game any less F2P nor does it make the game P2W. Seems like a silly reason to quit.
---
God no. Bring back control priest.  
---
Holy Wrath pally already exists if you want to be boring and have 27 stall cards + a combo package. Go play that.
---
Last game before the patch hit, and I got this beauty up!
---
Obligatory 'and mage'
---
still tier 1 on 'last 1 day' data on hsreplay = nerfed into oblivion. TIL. have you even played the deck since the patch?
---
HSReplay statistics on my variant are in, thanks everyone for trying it!

I was playing dragon Druid vs a face hunter. I managed to beat him and I got a friends request. I’ve gotten a few requests asking for the deck code so i accepted. He began berating me for being a “dumb American” and threatening me with gun violence. Also was using some racist language. He unfriended me and I went to look for a way to report him and I’m showing you can’t report players not on your friends list? Is that true?
---
then CCGs aren't healthy and never will be. if you find the existence of polarised matchups unacceptable finding a new game to play is the only realistic solution.
---
Also I think you should just send a ticket, that's the only way I know to report players at all in HS
---
Ye I had the coins disappearing thing, that is just a display bug at least.
---
Ok now i have the same. Yesterday it worked fine. Had massive problems up to the iOs update. Random crashes all the time.
---
Yep, though I screen shotted someone that friend requested me after a match and proceeded to hurl racial and homophobic slurs before unfriending me. I sent a ticket through world of warcraft's report feature.
---
For the record mage is barely holding a better wr than priest.
---
The only control deck atm is Galakrond Priest except instead of winning off it's controlling value game it wins off a wonky ohko because that's how the game is nowadays
---
It's surprising how easily Shaman can deal with a turn 4 and 5 7/7. The Anubisath version is more consistent since your whole hand of minions are a threat for a good few turns if you draw well.
---
Probably not for a long time. I'm guessing most heroes you can buy will be buyable again at a later date.
---
The only card that took a solid hit is Corrupt Elementalist, but apparently that single hit is causing more damage to the curve than I thought. They are a bit more fragile to aggro and midrange (handlock) for example. Still tier 1 without a doubt but I guess that's fine. Rogue is the one getting a little bit out of control now but I don't think that deck is as difficult to counter.
---
Yeah, this was a huge set-up that I planned for months, and now I finally am able to get about 20 upvotes! SUCCESS!
---
Treant Druid seems pretty effective against it because you can outrace them because they don’t contest your board.
---
I very much enjoyed watching this

---
Albatross is not the theme or focus per se. It should be considered more along the lines of a tempo/tech card. The quest is the primary wincon. 
---
Albatross is very strong versus slower decks but it's an okay tool against aggro if you can afford to play it. Basically, one needs to consider whether or not they can afford to play albatross into the res pool based on the current game state. Sometimes, versus aggro, its not the correct choice and I keep it in my hand or mulligan it back. Realistically, versus aggro, albatross is regularly an inappropriate play since you may be better off healing face and protecting the res pool for something like convincing infilitrator, sandhoof waterbearer, or kharhut. The albatross is played primarily to beat shaman since it starves out their resources and, especially post nerf, they need time to ramp towards the end game. Shaman pretty much can't do anything with Mogu against priest since we run very small boards until late game which gives us time to draw the tools we need to beat them. Dragging out the game regularly forces shamans to play Galakrond or Shudder to aim to regain board control. If I've done well with albatross, by the time they get it, I can usually answer with mass hysteria or plague to clear the board at which point they lack resources to clear my subsequent mass res or even just taunt drop plus quest. Batterhead is a huge factor as well. Batterhead, with quest support, is a 6/15 body (6/18 if you can clear some smaller minions before healing with quest for 3/6). This generally allows him to clear all or most of anyone's board and essentially constitutes another board clear.
---

---
I actually just had a first place game as him, but I think it’s because I got two triples from his hero power alone which helped me get a Mama Bear pretty early on.
---
Ahh I remember the days of r/fuckdruid
---
Pirate warrior and face hunter are significantly easier to tech against than Shaman was
---
&gt;Because at that point you're not really playing against 7 other people
---
The other players are affecting your opponents, and thus you, even if you guys are not matched up.
---
I'm not seeing why they need to force every player to always meet with every other player. The fact that you have an equal chance each round to meet is sufficient. Random does not equal even
---
&gt;and the player will be able to choose a deck from more variety of decks instead of 5 top tier decks 10-20 will be valuable 
---
You *can*, sure, but quite often you'll see Spikes bringing either *the* two best decks or *the* best deck and the best counter to that best deck.
---
There's no easy, clear-cut way to diversify a format beyond the four or five best in a given best-of-one format. There can be some mind games by bringing some weird deck choices, sure, but those weird deck choices are quite often going to be lesser options overall.
---
There might be a little element of surprise when you bring a semi-decent Aggro Priest deck to the table, but as soon as your opponent realizes its playing like Zoo Warlock deck that's short on gas, you've probably lost more often than not.

Neither pirate warrior nor face Hunter have the problem that Shaman had, which was no serious counterplay. It was dominant in the early game from the lackey package, out tempo'd basically any deck in the mid game, and had one of the games strongest finishers. Now, it has some natural predators like hyper aggro decks. Pirate Warrior and Face Hunter have plenty of natural predators and thus aren't nearly as problematic. Anything that can brawl for the board effectively enough, or gain enough HP to survive till around turn 6 or 7, can expect to have a strong positive winrate.
---
Meat&gt;fruit
---
I'm still evaluating the nerf for myself, but I've said it before: when this sub wants to nerf something, there's always an urge to burn whatever it is to the ground. Too much of what the sub wants is driven by pure anger and an urge to punish archetypes that they've been frustrated by. The notion of actual game balance, which is what nerfs are supposed to accomplish, often goes into the bin once the pitchforks come out.
---
Exactly this.  Shaman just had too many high value, low card count plays.  Pushing Mogu back a couple turns forces the player to make decisions.  Does it make the deck too top heavy?  What other mid-range combo does it compete with?  Should one combo be cut for something more aggressive.
---
Photorino Kripperino
---
well you put him in a position where he either give you a 0 mana spell to silence a deathrattle minion, or give you a 0 mana spell to kill your opponents highest attack minion, considering he isn't programmed and can't know the effect of deathrattles I'd say he made the right choice
---
leper gnome and abusive sergeant both had the 1 mana 2/1 statline. They used to be key parts of aggressive decks, after nerf they saw huge drops in play rate. Overload isn't even a downside when you have decks like overload shaman that actively take advantage of that.
---
sludge slurper was definitely overtuned, it sees play in aggressive decks and as early board presence in busted decks like galakrond shaman. That deck doesnt really care about overload since it doesnt have many early game plays anyway.
---
I think people are just experimenting with other decks right now. I went against a variety of opponents last night and honestly I see way more aggro hunters than anything.
---
And from my experimentation, Hunter is hardly the flawless monstrosity people are pretending it is. The meta is too slow and greedy, but once people adjust I expect Hunter and Warrior winrates to fall. They're super easy to tech against. Literally just a Ziliax, or a couple rush or taunt minions is often enough to lose me the game instantly.

Rouge the bat made me familiar with rouge.  And yet some people verbally call her rogue.  Maybe because she is quite roguelike.  Of course they aren't rougelikes on Steam.
---
Wow I have never heard such a stupid comment like yours, wanna see you play a non meta deck and still get to rank 1. 
---
You are completely stupid if you think Treant Druid is an easy deck.
---
Wow clearly an idiot who hasn’t played Treant Druid.
---
I much prefer this to what we actually got....there's something just offputting and out of place with it....wish we would've gotten a Tauren Hero....or even a Worgen or Cenarius..
---
Every pro considered it busted two days ago. Since then it got popular. Then people learned to play it. Then it plummeted. You are right that in the couple hours between our comments the projection curve for the deck has corrected to be above 50%, settling at just under 53%. When I looked it was not predicting the stabilization that can clearly be seen to have happened after my comment and before yours. When I wrote my comment the deck was projected in the red. TIL that curve projects a bit. Either way the played winrate of the apothecary is under 65% when played. Which is only 2% lower than I'd you get it in your Mulligan. So unless you were fudging your stats in your favor in the 9 hours between our comments Mulligan winrate dropped 3%. And a sub 65% winrate when played means people are figuring out how to deal with the deck. It has been solved without being teched against, unless it is just me not seeing a lot of people running silence and such. The card is balanced.  It isn't rogue quest or Barnes where hitting your combo dramatically increases your winrate.
---
 Also the Reynad argument is flawed and disproven. Statistically if players play against like players.  Casual players against casual players. Rank 20 against rank 20. Legend against legend. The skill of the pilot can be ignored. The reason lesser played decks lose winrate as they become more played is opponents start to see them more than once. So therefore the deck didn't take a nose dive because the pilots are getting worse, it is because the opponents are learning.  Look back two days ago at a pro streamer playing at legend. Constant misplays. Look again tonight. Much less.
---
Glad to see your luck turn around there.
---
I thought I was lucky with my golden murloc...
---
Phaoris?  
---
5/5 minion on 10 mana
---
in decks like aggro shaman overload (1) is a positive on 0-1 cost cards
---
slurper in a vacuum is ok, but when its in a class with a double battlecry quest and murloc synergy and overload synergy its no surprise it was the most played class card in the game
---
King phaoris is a low roll , and if you see the stats its much harder to pull of and a lot of people cut mogu
---
Exactly what I meant. 100%. My exact words were ''he's 100% right end yourself''. 
---
Stop making things up, because I said I understand  why he was angry and I don't like netdeckers too.
---
Ha, I’m not sure but good idea!  I wish we could get this pinned or something so other frustrated iPad players could see it.
---
That was literally the first thing I noticed.
---
I’m amazed how quickly we all forgot about that. The outrage over that deck was insane.
---
Go fuck yourself, you muppet.
---
At the time, Drake had been a staple in every meta in HS history. Think Zillax level include in decks for a 5 drop. 
---
The versatility of the card draw, spell damage, and even dragon tag actually pushed out a lot of other 5 drop options over the years. Now it's funny to think about, but drake used to be overly strong for it's mana cost.
---
Malygos Druid has been a staple forever, so I think it’s only a matter of time before we find a list.
---
Rogue
---
There are a lot of toxic people on this sub. They probably kill kittens.
---
''Netdecking'' is just a way for bad players to achieve something in this game with copying and abusing the most broken thing at a time. It's pretty boring and pathetic.
---
Face hunter was already a deck before the nerfs. Now shaman is more in line with the power level of hunter and warrior (ie. still tier 1). Plus face hunter will almost definitely get worse as the meta settles and people tech against it. There's already shaman lists running witch's brew and I saw firebat playing deathrattle rogue with swamp leech yesterday.
---
Druid cards from this expansion is literally disapointing.
---
Almost like he knows he did something that will result in being insulted. Hmmmmm...
---
Not to mention that it's straight-up gambling. I assume Blizz would basically reduce the pity timer to make it work, but if they don't you could have a "bonus 50% chance" and still end up with *nothing* extra.

True, forgot to account for the twinspell. And mark of the lotus was proven to be very strong during its time in standard, seeing as blessing of the ancients has to pay 2 mana just for the twinspell effect.

---
hes on a plane
---
What type of deck would you say this was? Agro? Midrange?
---
I've played a variety of meme decks to Legend. Treant Druid has very clear plays at every turn. Face Hunter less so.
---
It's no different than a token druid deck that has a bunch of board buffs or even Paladin with Blessing of Kings. Against Shaman, you're incentivized to trade down the board size. Also, it's not just one card, because several other lackeys are capable of buffing their board - another Titanic lackey would've been good for the Shaman here, as an example. Could also have been ethereal lackey into the 1 mana +1/+1 to all minions. Point is it's not about punishing for having minions, it's punishing for not reading and going face.
---
Proud of myself for not wasting money on any packs this expac but dang, those animations are pretty cool. Pretty bmglad i got the new deathwing from the free packs. Singleton galakron warrior is kinda fun and certainly one of the best animations this time arouns
---
What would you change about it? Getting rid of rush would severely change the decks plan, and even getting rid of 1 attack could cripple it. 
---
Id say with galakrond its better to nerf surrounding cards than nerf galakrond itself
---
There will be a some kind of token/aggro gala list with the usage of +1+1 and deal 5 damage card i think
---
It's not as bad as old secret Paladin with Boom, or Face Hunter back in the day. But it is a bit frustrating. Thankfully there's a lot more counter aggro cards than there used to be
---
I hope you are right but the problem is they need to communicate to us if that’s the problem.   Also I did download a patch on my iPad yesterday so I’m not sure what you mean.
---
lmfao on how good his deck is.
---
I dont like spending money for card packs, so this deck is just perfect. It even makes fun when you lose somehow :D Thanks for sharing it and fk all shamans/rogues.
---
Right? That's still a good metric. Also "this overtuned thing isn't as strong as that overtuned thing" is an awful argument
---
Zephyrs doesn't seem to weight deathrattles as a high priority target. Last time I was up against face hunter I think I was offered Healing Touch, Arcane Explosion and a big taunt minion. But I also hadn't taken much damage so take that with a grain of salt. Maybe with deathrattle rogue gaining popularity they'll do a slight fix so Zephyrs offers silence against dangerous deathrattles.
---
tbh Slurper should go back up as more and more people figure out that maybe Overload shaman is an actually good deck
---
Also these are certainly not "card in class popularity" but "card in decks" popularity, which will go down as the class play-rate goes down.
---
The real story will be if Slurper is an actually ok card at 1/1 (Overload 1)
---
I think it is.
---
where can i filter by „last 1 day“? 
---
My only time frame options are, besides last 30 days, premium only and none of them are last 1 day. Are you checking under „decks“ or a different category?
---
No matter whether I use data or WiFi, it doesn’t open -.-
---
I tried it at rank 5 and I am currently 7-1. It is very good against face hunters and it can also rush the opponent with smorc.
---
It was... your fault.

Idk I only report in games for griefing and throwing anything that ruins the game. I think people should be able to say what you want as long as you have the option to just not accept the message/block. In my opinion if you accept the friend request or don’t block the person you kind of accept the “risk” so to speak.

What's Enena?
---
It does fall under the same category. Deathrattle rogues are also a problem and Zephrys does not recognize Necrium Apothecary to be a "threat" and offers meaningless options. I did not mention that since I have seen posts towards Deathrattle Rogues. But yes it is a problem when you don't even get the chance to react to the board.

Hey Highfivesghost, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Right, there are some serious high rolls, but I'd rather face a cheated out consistently big minion on turn 5 than a slightly less consistent big minion that got cheated out on turn 3. Also, it's a little harder without the turn 5 cultist that could spawn 3 things with one card. The changes aren't huge, but they might (I hope) add up to a big difference in how games play out.
---
Quest also does worse in the mirror if your opponent doesnt use the quest
---
Yes it is good, because it beats face decks and can get pressure decks like dr rogue also
---
The meta was never going to be all desks have the same shot against other decks. Hs is a bo1 format with no sideboard, natural predation of decks based on archetype is always going to be the way it is. Whining about this makes no sense.
---
But in this case, Zephrys would need to know exactly what DR the Apothecary has (give all minions +3/+3), then make an assumption on how many minions would get buffed, and how bad that is for you.
---
\*You\* know that because you know what the opponent deck list is (for the most part). \*You\* know (or at least can make a safe assumption) there's a bunch of Charge minions in their hand ready to come out cheap and buffed. Zephrys does not. This isn't a secret, it's been explained before with other DR combos.
---
Red powder distinction?
---
It makes me laugh that deathrattle rouge didn't make the list after everyone complaining that it didn't get nerfed.
---
I was so confused one time when I copied a Frostlich Jaina, and none of my elementals had lifesteal. Then I realised that this aura is the result of DK's battlecry
---
&gt;well the problem is that is not random at all. Every single game you face a guy, next game you face another guy and then in the third game you face the first one.
---
This is just bullshit.
---
I'm not sure why it's hard to understand that every matchup has a 1/6th chance of a rematch with Ur prior prior opponent.
---
I went from rank 4 to rank 5 and no stars without playing. I start a game, then the app breaks and when I can finally reconnect I lost another star
---
This has almost nothing to do with legend, I used legend as a representation of a somewhat accurate depiction of the meta
---
I thought the same with Carnivorous Cube at first too.
---
Why does that have Malygos? The only spell that really benefits from it is soulfire
---
Nah just in general Zephrys is really bad at handling deathrattles and prioritizing silences. Would definitely benefit from higher valuations on silences as at least an option
---
Hmmm well you could say "ok,its not your problem, Keep going etc" instead
---
I don't mind new heroes, at this point Hearthstone's storytelling is better than WoW's (because Horny Steve wanted to make MoP2 with his own self insert and then forgot to put in any humour) so I have no problem with them inventing things. Morgl was a way cooler option than Rastakhan.
---
 
---
But you know what would be cool? A more diverse selection of races. Oooh Sylvanas Windrunner, fantastic, cause Alleria didn't look super similar and fill the exact same role. Totally wanted her over say Lasan Skyhorn or some Rangari they invented. Oh Deathwing is the new Warrior character... a human form dragon? Err ok but what about a Vrykul or a DIDwarf. Or how about a Nightborne Mage
---
I'm pretty sick of face aggro metas. Face hunter has to be the dumbest iteration of this in a long time
---
So you want to be reported or what
---
Sad p2w priest noises because i can't help
---
Exactly this.
---
It really doesnt
---
u wot kid?
---
Sad because I created all the cards for gala shaman because I like shaman :( But you’re right
---
Remove the Overload from Sludge Slurper, increase its cost to 2 mana, make it neutral.
---
Because you paying well the pre purchase bundles and packs and you are satisfied because you play broken decks (hunter rogue warrior)
---
Umm wtf, all packs cost the same regardless which expansion they are.
---
Mathias Shaw would be great for it.
---

Blizzard released a broken expansion, **already nerfed things as a result** and as far as I can tell kripp hasn't made a video about any of it.
---
...Maybe they got to him guys.
---
Maybe battlegrounds was the Kool aid to keep kripp from taking about expansions and balance..
---
I watched several streams of kripperino and found him pretty chill and quiet. Is the whole "salt" thing around kripp a joke to tease him ? or a reference about one situation that happened in the past ? or maybe I just didn't watch enough of his streams ?
---
Not hitting t3,4,5,6 on t6 is about 3%. Nothing particularly spectacular here, it happens often enough.
---
What? Cable Rat is a 2 mana 1/1. With your suggestion Slurper should be exactly the same card, but one mana cheaper.
---
Yeah forgot about mad scientist, that card was total bonkers.
---
Well, that's the choice you make when going FTP. Even so, it doesn't take that much time to accumulate 2000 dust. Like I said, you need to be ruthless about dusting cards when playing like that. Either that, or you just need to be willing to submit to some grind time.
---
What happened? Dying against face hunter?
---
How come I still see only Shaman when I order decks by win rate
---
You might consider replacing the mutate + Fleshshaper combo
---
I think that changing the 8/8s to 6/6s would be a good place. It's really strong, but you won't be able to deal 26 damage with the card over the course of two turns.
---
Say no more
---
This seems to have worked FYI, thanks again!
---
I realize that, but I stand by what I said. I don't think the overload is necessary if they're taking away what, in my mind, was the reason it would have the mechanic in the first place.
---
Wow, that’s my version of Galakrond Warrior that I hit legend with this season, here’s the guide I wrote on r/CompetitiveHS: https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/ebnmkt/galakrond_control_warrior_rank_3_to_legend
---
I hit legend before the nerfs so it was built purely to beat Shamans, which accounted for 64% of the decks I was facing. I’m stunned that the unchanged list has a 59% win rate, with thousands of games logged on HSreplay, that’s so incredibly gratifying
---
[I got my treants to 7/7 so far](https://imgur.com/M6vjRRw)
---
I lost a single game of Hearthstone = nerfs were not enough
---
Glad to hear bud!
---
I guess I really don't know. Because cable rat is 2, but if you raise it to 2, then it'd destroy the card, but at 1 it's even more ridiculous outside of overload Shaman. I don't think that it was that big of a deal that it needed to be nerfed, but w/e.
---
I still think they need to go one level deeper and nerf shudderwock to only replay MINIONS battlecry.  I get why they won't (1600 free dust as it's about to rotate out) but it would do wonders to future proof wild against wierd hero cards or triggers
---
Yeah. A lot of the time arena games are decided in draft or by hand and first few draws. The saltiest is when you go second and opponent has the good curve and you just play your best minion each turn and take chip damage until you lose.
---
The whole "strong but niche cards with inconsistent card draw" completely kills the class. Like you said, synergy isn't there. When there is synergy, Priest becomes the best class in the game (with a combo deck. It's always combo...). They need to cut these garbage cards for cards that support each other.
---
[[Radiance]] needs to atleast be able to target any friendly character.
---
There needs to be a 1 or 2 mana minion that draws [[Shadowform]]
---
[[Mind Vision]] doesn't give you a card advantage because it's 1 for 1. Might be better if it discovered 3 cards like Lazul. "Mind Vision" would makes sense as a name if it did.
---
[[Divine Spirit]] just needs to be removed entirely or made a flat buff. +4 health perhaps?
---
[[Holy Nova]] needs to be made into a half-decent board clear. It needs to deal 3 damage. Maybe it can heal 1 less, or replace it with lightbomb, I don't care.

I agree. I think there’s cards that are just fine to be strong, for example Zilliax, whenever I go up against it, it doesn’t bother me at all, and when I use it, it feels so great.
---
You ever heard of Anka and Necrium Vial

Of course they were

I agree. I got [2,700 dust](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ed18ch/2700_dust_from_the_nerfs_not_bad/) myself. I even opened another Mogu Fleshshaper from the new bundle. :) I have [more duplicates and extras](https://imgur.com/a/e99ND0v) waiting for nerfs.
