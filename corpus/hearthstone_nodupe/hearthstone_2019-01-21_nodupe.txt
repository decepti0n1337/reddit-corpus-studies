Positive score rating though, not bad.

---
Not really. Does the game contradict itself by having Molten Giant start at 20 mana?
---
Don't underestimate the power of the one mana 1/1
---
What? The game doesn't contradict itself. It's very clearly stated and the interaction is clear.
---
To clarify: I got Aviana off the Confessor, which gave me the start of turn card discount. Admittedly, it wasn‚Äôt particularly useful in my situation.
---
That was Tinkmaster during the early stages of Hearthstone. Neutral transformation was deemed too strong. That card is 3 mana however, so upping the cost for a similar card could work.
---
You're using Rexxar wrong if you pick the mediocre beasts. He's strong because you can create powerful rush and lifesteal minions that can't exist as collectible cards. 
---

---
You are not seriously comparing 2 mana deal 1 damage to all enemies and 8 mana fill your board with 2/1 minions or 8 mana shitty Twisting Nether right? One is a cheap filler, the other is unplayable in 90% of matchups. 
---
Murlocs have it tough. See also: Hellfire

Play warrior and draft every dragon roar you see.  Play 2 Deathwings every game

I'm guessing it's because you're more likely to draft a decent mech than a decent murloc
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
If you barely have any basic cards then I would purchase until you have most of the commons and rares, but if youre pulling for epics and legendaries you may as well just craft them instead. 
---
Same with Malygos. If one has an 11cost minions, it can be playable with a Thaurisan tick or something. 
---
Hunter is worse 
---
I mean, if you‚Äôre a man of culture you‚Äôre playing Merps‚Äô hyper aggro Hunter to begin with, in which 1/1/1s are not bad. Went 10 wins with that 1/1/1 beast that reduces the cost of a beast in hand. 
---
(Might sound dumb) what‚Äôs a bm 
---
I personally kinda like it as it is. I think the problem would be best solved by just removing the squelch option. Because some people (or the majority if that‚Äôs the case) ask for it and it‚Äôs an easy fix isn‚Äôt really any argument for blizzard to change their game. It‚Äôs such a small issue but still from a multiplayer design perspective might be important to them that people can‚Äôt just opt completely out of the fraction of human interaction that‚Äôs in there.
---
-I lost my final boss 2 times to big priest who killed me out of nowhere with 80+ damage right before I had the combo 
---
-I
---
This is why it needs to be like 32 cards and then you get rid of 2...like other ccgs do when drafting
---
I agree you can find moments of stupidity but this really takes the cake. Trying to coin out an 11 mana minion when you're a pro player is a joke.
---
Damn, this is bad. And yes I know, everyone makes mistakes, but still...
---
It's also much worse than coining a mountain giant imho. And yes a lot of people have done that one, but doing something at rank 18 and doing something in a major tournament are two very different things.
---
I once scored a "own goal" when I was like 7, it's not exactly the same as someone scoring a own goal in the olympics or in the playoffs, where it'll follow them for the rest of their life.
---
Hakkar shuffles corrupted blood into each player‚Äôs deck. When the warlock plays cataclysm to kill Mecha‚Äôthun and all other minions, a card is added to their deck, and preventing Mecha‚Äôthun‚Äôs effect from activating.
---
Not trolling i know illidan is closed to a demon but i just imagined him be played in druid since he is malfurion brother, idk maybe it will bring demon druid or something like that, iknow its crazy but this is just fantasy talk
---
I've drafted Dreadscale Knight a couple times before. It's under-scored by HearthArena on classes that lack healing, imo.
---
There is a lot of RNG, yes. But there is also a certain mindset that you need to have to play well, and for that you need some experience of the game. You need to know the cards, know which RNG pools you're dealing with, and depending on which deck you're playing there are different things you have to keep track of.
---
It's even worse with the bucket system. Like, it's always the game choosing to dick you over, but there's something way more personal about the game picking the worst bucket than just randomly picking three shitty cards. It's saying "And fuck *you* in particular!"
---
XDV1906 #2710

I'm on EU tho :)
---
If it were clearly stated, this 'pro' wouldn't have made the error.  
---
Nowhere on freezing trap does it say '...if minion costs 9 or more, turn it into an unplayable block in your opponents hand'.  If that's what you mean by clear interaction. 
---
The card should cap the minion cost at 10. 
---
If can no OTK, SMOrc.
---
Its best case is deal 1 damage heal for 1. Its pretty garbage however you look at it.
---
Gotcha
---
Cynicism doesn‚Äôt make you interesting or even even correct. 
---
If you buy packs it'll matchmake you against favourable opponents to get your brain to associate purchasing with the rush of winning.
---
Yeah, I get an old black and white drawing.
---
is that good enough? Is it even useful against any other decks?
---
Sleep with the Fishes. That one creeps me out.
---
I saw on hsreplay that something like 40% of people are keeping Rexxar *in the mulligan*.  I'm sorry but that is **WRONG**.  It's not wrong in a few matchups, but it is wrong in most of them.  That stat should be like 10% or lower, you want to execute your gameplan, and Rexxar is not your main gameplan.
---
If you hadn't stopped already, now is a good time to stop giving any money to blizzard, they do not deserve any support when shit like this has existed in the game for years 
---
Handlock hands down (pun intended)
---
The tap to decrease health for more cards to make twilight drake, mountain giant, or molten giant play is awesome. The deck is not autopilot and interactive with your opponent.
---
Also priest with thought steal. This is the only deck (before the introduction of their rogue) where you can play cards from two classes.
---
I also enjoy demon deck with Malganis, evolve shaman, deathrattle hunter (love both feign dead and play dead), raza reno priest, and any pre nerf Yogg deck (don‚Äôt care who wins, I play if for crazy ‚Äòfireworks‚Äô).
---
Can‚Äôt wait for Hearthstone Vanilla.  This game needs a good version of principal designer.
---
I would rather not feel like I have to play a specific deck. Controlock and evenlock aren't that great in the meta. And I am playing priest, scream is pretty useless, because they never play more than 2 minions at a time and draw 5+ with auctioneer. Feels incredibly bad to play against it. 
---
The Branching Paths play was extremely common when Mossy Horror was prevalent. But the most obnoxious part of that video is the suggestion that the obvious play was UI. Taking one of the million minions on the board is the obvious play? Over a wall of taunts that they can't get through? Who would think that?
---
Amazing! That's the same combination on my luggage! 
---
It was the best deck, but IIRC Aggro Shaman was right on its tail still and it was still overall an aggro meta. But it‚Äôs been a while, I could totally be wrong. 
---
Ah man, Shamanstone. 
---
Its vague in the original comment, but I'd support a Barnes nerf. Barnes coined out on turn 3 is very polarizing without a Hex/Polymorph, kinda like how NSW was an insta-win if you dont have Poison Seeds.
---
This, the deck was so much fun to play.
---
Which 1?
---
Tempo Mage with Flamewaker. 
---
With the addition of Jeklik and Hi‚Äôreek. Both even-cost cards with huge potential if used correctly. 
---

---
Glyph is a mage card. So if it is just a colour palate of priests, the colour palate was deliberately chosen to look like a priest card instead of a mage card. Also this is the flavour text:
---
&gt; It's the Ancient Tol'vir symbol for "Whoops!"
---
Which makes no sense for glyph, but does match the shadow word:horror card art. 
---
In terms of *new* content, the game is pretty barren. How has the game turned over such an insane profit margin and not added something as simple as achievements, or stats, or any form of replays, or tournament mode, or a core set, or any revamp to the painfully outdated Quest/Level pop-up, or any of the countless and simple QoL changes (like adding more than 30 cards to a deck when crafting, or rearranging decks, or a scroll-bar for the history tab)? The majority of the new stuff in this game are the cards, and it feels like 80% of them can be considered filler garbage upon the first glance. I guess they make pretty card backs once in awhile, but most people just find one they like and stick with it.

They have ruined the game with these death knight cards. you can win the game with one or two cards now and its bullshit.

Hunter Hero Power can. 
---
I play lots of odd paladin, just to beat all the hunters and OTK decks out there right now. About the Mecha'thun decks (Druids and Warlocks)... they have so much AOE, healing/armor, defensive tools, it's like impossible to beat them... Is Mojomaster Zihi the only counter? Or is odd paladin just a bad matchup? 
---
Literally just learned what a cigar isn‚Äôt
---
Should take one of your mana crystals away from next turn 
---
Reno Mage for sure. I played variants of control mage from the Naxxramas era (Sludge Belcher + Duplicate shenanigans back when you could win games with solid value) then slotted in Reno as soon as he came out. Kazakus obviously made the deck a lot better, but I kind of preferred it when it was an off-meta sleeper.
---
Frozen Throne shook things up and FLJ was fun, but K&amp;C just made grinder decks obsolete with Cubelock and Bloodreaver, not to mention that control mage lost much of its identity with Banker and Zola being neutral. I switched to Renolock a while back, but still miss when the deck was viable.
---
TIL Primordial Glyph and Shadow Visions have the same glyph.
---
"Pro player"
---
It looks like underwater, got the feeling of nagas, maybe they changed plans or delayed just as BFA is sinking.
---
I don't think the math checks out.  You're probably still better off taking the Dreadscale early in the draft if you have no mechs.  What are you expecting to have in your deck, one, two?  If anything that might encourage you to make bad plays just to try and get value out of the Lumi when nine times out of ten you shouldn't.
---
It's from the [Year of the Raven announcement blog post](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/21534739/).
---
This is madness!
---
hunting for the fucks
---
You can play Amara with Auchenai on board. It was like a year or so ago that they fixed it.
---
Incredibly boring.
---
Same as OP, old school contor warrior. Followed closely by freeze mage and handlock. 
---
I mean, it should only be applicable to &gt;10 mana cards and it shouldn't work like overload.
---
Lets say you play a 25 mana molten giant on turn 1, you'll "block" 24 mana. But unlike overload, it's not just -24 mana next turn, but generally. You'll have 22 blocked on turn 2 with none to spare etc.. and while this applies you can't play any cards that cost too much mana obviously.
---
Which stops the potential imbalance of just dropping everything on turn 1, stops plays like dropping lich king on turn 1, and still allows you to play cards like freeze trapped 9+ mana minions while not making freeze trap too much worse.
---
i advise you: Craft Zilliax.  
---
It's auto-include in many decks.
---
 I have not regretted since I crafted it   
---
Can you not read? Fine I'll explain it even more: Since you have 22 mana still blocked, turn 3 won't also happen, then you'll have 19 mana blocked. Turn 4 15, Turn 5 10, Turn 6 4, Turn 7 you'll have 3 mana to spare.
---
I think a few of these is okay but the game suffers if you just keep adding more and more of them. I also think it‚Äôs lazy to just keep making cards that all do roughly the same thing - get an op card added to your hand each turn. You might think having to design all those op cards it generates is extra work but I disagree, usually they‚Äôre not terribly interesting cards themselves (true here also) and they don‚Äôt need to be especially balanced.
---
Good design doesn‚Äôt add complexity just for the sake of it. The complexity here doesn‚Äôt really add anything here in my opinion. These types of cards are a shortcut to being ‚Äúcreative‚Äù because the more stuff is present, the less you need to focus on each part of it to make it new or distinct in at least some fashion. I‚Äôve a lot more respect for people who can create individual cards which are unique or cool in their own effects than people who just layer on more and more card generation.
---
It's [The League of Explorers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK8rNtiJYWs)
---
I'd be willing to bet it's not a simple coincidence.  The art team definitely knew what they were doing here.  They're all priest spells, the glyph symbol is the same, and the murlocs are featured in 2 of the 3 cards.  I think it's pretty clearly intended, and here we are talking about it (not the first time this has been posted), so it also clearly worked.  
---

---
He did have a good chance to win later though if he saved the coin with an 11 Mana Velen res/coin/vivid nightmare/mind blast/mind blast for 40 dmg
---
You do sacrifice an enormous amount of tempo the turn you play this card though. In Hearthstone that's a big deal.
---

I meant to imply when having DK Jaina of course. It's a lot of value in the late game.
---
I think qualifying for a few seasonal championships earns you that title
---
I think that is usually true but the wild tournament this month is causing everyone to tryhard in wild legend
---
i'd say best bet is a deck with a couple of 3 damage aoe and a skulking gheist.
---
and for non 1 mana spell mechathuns i'd say one who has a lot of face damage spells
---
so go for mindblast priest
---
How about they change Eternal Servitude to silence the minion it summons. It would just be a pile of stats but they wouldn't get the healing and taunt from statues, the taunt and card from LK, the free rag shot, etc.
---
I love it. But these kind of cards should never be printed. Hero cards should only work in tandem with cards in your deck. It should not work as a single endless value card like DK Rexxar.
---
The hero battlecry is awesome. But I would replace the other cards that are cheaper but don't work on their own so other cards in your deck are more powerful because of it.

Do you mind sharing a list, not sure i saw deck with void contract.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
No, you clearly can't play it if the amount of mana is impossible. 
---
Thank you very much. 
---
The fairness or not of such tools depends on the the depth of the information given : 
---
Giving an in the void value of a card is ok, saying that their value increases if you have some sort of cards allready in your deck is ok, making adjusted calculations of their value depending of cards allready picket is not ok.
---
For example you have to pick between a mech and a murloch, cards that usually have strong sinergy with the ones of their tribe: if the tool gives a fixed value of card and says that is better with others of same kind ok, if they calculate adjusted value depending the number of mechs and murlochs you already have and withones you have, not ok
---
I meant a card called Littletooth
---
The guy has 1.2 million twitch followers and 970 thousand YouTube subscribers. Like him or not, he's one of the largest influencers in this games community, of course people are going to talk about him on the games most populous forum. Nobody is forcing you to click these posts. 
---
Your initial statement that new players can't get into Wild at low/no cost is false. They can, and they can do it with any of the four main archetypes (Aggro, Midrange, Control, Combo).
---
What they can't do is get into Wild for free with expensive Wild-only cards. That's a different argument. And I hate to say this, but "I want the most expensive item in the store, and I can't afford it, therefore the seller should cut the price because it isn't fair" doesn't actually make a good case.
---
No problem.  Most everyone likes the 4 mana 4/4 that heals for 4 over farseer, but I liked the 3 mana version.  
---
Though, if you're really facing a bunch of priests you should still probably switch decks.  I was 2-8 vs priest.  After I hit legend I swapped to odd secret mage and went 9-1 and smoked 4 priests.  
---
Those were useless.

Why is the 1/1 lifesteal worse than "give a friendly mech +1/1" when you don't have any mech synargies yet.
---
You wont know if you get [[Corpsetaker]] in this draft.
---
Last year I took a detour to Wild and crafted Renolock. I missed a ton of cards and ended up spending around 11000 dust. It was worth it; I now have alot of legendaries that are useful anyway, like Kazakus. 
---
I still can't play many Wild decks, but I ended up just investing a ton of dust. I still own a decent standard collection (can play most decks except Paladin and Druid) but I must say, I did spend around ~150 euros last year. This gives me decent standard collections and enough dust for some crafting. 
---
If you choose to play both Standard and Wild, I would advise to really maximize the economic part of this game. For example, I reroll my quests as good as I can, I play around 5-10 wins a day and usually don't craft meme-cards. Especially for Wild, I only craft cards that are useful in multiple decks. I rarely disenchant cards except when they are golden; in that case, recrafting them is free (you only miss the gold portrait). I notice that now, after 2 years of playing (with an 8 month break), I own a decent standard collection and my wild collection keeps on growing. In around 12 months, I expect to be able to play pretty much every deck, and will never have to pre-order again, because saved up gold is more than enough to craft/unpack the useful cards every 4 months.

Well he doesn‚Äôt have a battle cry. So unless you have a mech that costs 3 or less. You can‚Äôt do much the turn you summon him. I think the 2 extra armor doesn‚Äôt do much. Plus the community enjoyed the ‚ÄúDr 7‚Äù gaining 7 armor theme.

My rule is if the other guy does the same emote twice when he had a good turn or I had bad RNG I squelch. Nothing is more frustrating than having some kid spam hello 6 times after top decking a board clear and before passing turn.

2/-/- | Secret: When an enemy minion attacks, return it to its owner's hand. It costs (2) more.  
---
Pardon?
---
The fact that i am complaining about is that the Hunter Decks are so strong even in casual nobody seems to be Playing anything else. Not about the fact that people are netdecking
---
If you had an immune minion that functioned as a taunt that was the bug
---
Or just open a book and learn something to be able to drop something positive sometimes.
---
;) 
---
Tesspionage rouge. It's either 1 mana UI by turn 5 and another one down the line, or 1 mana Pounce and another one down the line. There is no in between.
---
But boi is it fun. Winrate is kinda crappy tho (either too slow combo or too shitty rolls in cards you get. Or both.) But if you can pull it off fast and get good cards, oh boi. No counterplay allowed.
---
Nice! Congrats buddy!
---
miracle maly rogue with pre nerf Flurry. I really miss those days &lt;/3
---
Also, Sulfuras to the face. *SMOrc*
---
i'm allowed to express my dislike for your eceleb
---
I agree.  My point is that hero cards generate infinite value out of one card, which just kills the point in running late game cards at all.  Why run late game minions when you can generate infinite 2 mana water elementals?
---
You can just glance at the end turn/reload button. If you killed your opponent it would be yellow, if failed ‚Äî green
---
Jokes on you they're playing mill mage and just looking to fill your hand. All planned.
---
Triclass card counts for 3 classes in the same moment... EZ
---
I don't think you'd really need those against that particular boss though. Still, that's an interesting coincidence.
---
Skill on all servers is basically the same except for maybe top legend but that should not matter for a new player. 
---
Auto squelch when?
---
Mean Streets of Gadgetzan introduced a host of tri-class cards, of which Kazakus was one. The three groups were the Grimy Goons (Warrior, Hunter, Paladin), the Jade Lotus (Druid, Shaman, Rogue) and the Kabal (Mage, Priest, Warlock). Take a look through the cards of that expansion, and you'll find them.
---
I hope so! I was lucky enough to open both a Golden and non-Golden one.
---
curious george is a hozen, change my mind
---
I would watch that. At this point disguised toast is so bored, he‚Äôs playing mechathun without mechathun in the deck. I‚Äôm looking forward to see who goes full hero cards first, kripp or toast.
---
you would think this is something to know before you compete
---
Wow...
---
Congrats. Paladin was my first golden aswell, and naturally my favorite class. Too bad N'zoth pally has fallen in strength
---
Wild Control Priest with Justicar and N'Zoth. 
---
I still think using the +1/+1 from Lumi to trade up with a bigger minion will save more health on average than just a 1/1 that doesn't trade with any minion and might get you at most +1 health.
---
If you use the Oculus rift, look under your opponents hand and see what they have. ezwins
---
I'm just commenting so I can find this later, excuse my lack of contribution 
---
Garrosh did/does go with Boom in certain decks.
---
Sstopped reading and downvoted your post.
---
This post is misleading you need to relax your sphincter and let gravity do the work.
---
The 1 an only
---
No.
---
and before you compete in a tournament :3
---
#A TIME TO PERFORM BEYOND ONE'S LIMIT
---
Like this ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø?
---
oh look a bug in the game. better make a post about it 
---
I think it's a reasonable request. It's better for everyone if all the game modes were more accessible for new players. 
---
Tesspionage rogue: guaranteed to make either you (70%) or your opponent (30%) want to quit the game forever.
---
The Great Third War of the Shinob.... Oh *Doggos*
---
That's more like not remembering you have to tie your shoes before you go out on the court 
---
The meta will get slower with rotation, and then they'll see play. But right now, not a chance.
---
so instead they used the troll themes introduced in BFA? 
---
Water Rogue 
---
How can one access the old adventures ? I have only standard cards.
---
&gt; Gotta reel the kids in while they‚Äôre young.
---
FBI, open up!
---
When I first made Odd Rogue, I had maybe a 20% winrate over 20 matches. I then watched some pros play Odd Rogue because I knew the deck wasn't bad, but I was playing it wrong. Winrate increased to ~60-70%.
---
The deck is not bad, you are playing it wrong.
---
Midrange druid. The first deck that i took to legend in 2014. 
---
There might be some random Hearthstone stream website. Back in the days, Teamfortress tournaments were hosted both on twitch, and on Teamfortress.tv 
---
Might be something similar for HS.
---
For the overall game it's probably better to have as many people as possible in standard.
---
I understand why people would *like* to see cheaper wild cards, mainly because it feels weird to pay full price for cards which aren't available in one of the game modes, but there is really no reason why this should be the case. When you craft wild cards you craft them with the intention of playing wild.
---
Not to mention the fact that the entire game mode of wild probably only exists because the community would become angry if their cards literally became unusable after rotating (also this might be illegal in most countries, though I'm not sure). I can't imagine it being a good business move to promote wild in any way which does not involve buying packs.
---
Blizzard will use this an an excuse to say Big Priest is fine.
---
You have a point, but there does seem to be a difference between infinite value being designed for with many card choices and play choices vs putting in a one card infinite value generator.
---
You used to construct decks to create major value, now you just include one card. You can literally tech infinite value into almost any deck these days.
---
i have always enjoyed playing quest druid and maly rogue. they are both shit now tho.
---
He very likely does know about it but like i said nervousness and anxiety can melt your brain considering he was playing in a tournament
---
Thanks you all for reading this report.      
---
Last week was amazing for me!      
---
You voted me for 2. most valuable contributor to /r/hearthstone, thanks!      
---
Also my tweets about Best Players of all Time got so much attention, it's my most seen tweet of all time, many pro players saw it, feels really great!          
---
And also thanks for giving me tips last week about my own website, want to get started with it very soon, so i hope my quality will improve!
---
And with the ‚Äòrecent‚Äô nerfs in wild I thought they finally were working on making sure its at least a bit balanced.
---
Guess not.
---
Man in yellow hat: 5 mana, 5/4, battlecry: draw curious george from your deck
---
Curious george: 3 mana, 3/3, beast tag, battlecry: shuffle 2 bananas into your and your opponents deck
---
It's not absolute chaos until you add Mayor Noggenfogger (from Toki) 
---
GLove #1360 NA trading the 80g quest.  I show, you go first.
---
I would have tried to play a lot of different things just to see what the quest is (I'm stupid like that). Playing mechs would have been one of my last ideas.
---
This.

Prince Mukla
---
I just said that I dislike emote spamming and squelch it when I see it end of story, have a nice day, lets be done with this pointlessness.
---
12 wins?
---
Wild is still a thing, so you could play that while grinding for your standard decks.
---
Obviously that's when you coin hero power their face turn 1 and then use the 2 drop and carry on the game as normal
---
&gt; because i assumed there's an admin watching his screen behind him. 
---
This was not a thing when I competed at locations for prelims.
---
Well damn. Thanks man. Is there any trick to opening packs then? Should you only open packs from the same expansion in one go for the pity timer?
---
The core is Preparation, Espionage, and either Tess Greymane or 2  spectral cutlass + draw weapon effects.
---
Both tess and spectral cutlass have proven to not work well together, although if you want, you can just smash them together too. Appart from that, things that steal from the opponent (Blink fox, allucination) to not have to rely completely in espionage, and a lot of draw to be able to draw the 1 cost cards and use them quick (fan of knives, elven mistrel...). Finally, fill the rest with good rogue cards that work as removal (sap, backstab, SI:7,  walk the plank/assasinate). I dont recomend vanish even if its a great card because your minions will have their full cost once they go back to your hand, so if you have a big board of expensive minions created by espionage, it will cost you several turns to play them again.
---
The only expensive cards are the epics and legendaries. You have already the main legendary (tess) and both espionages (epics), so you only need Preparation (epic, 2 cpies will cost 800 total) and maybe spectral cuttlas if you want to go into that directon (2 copies 800 dust). The rest is mainly common and some rares. If you go cutlass, run Caver shiny finders too (common card, 80 dust total for 2 copies).
---
It was definitely a thing. Probably be mentioned on meta reports of the time
---
TRADE Europe, contact me.
---
Please note: I will NOT go first. Can show you all proofs I have quest.
---
I think that was probably more because what you said isn't correct
---
Buy more packs, or doggos be sad(((
---
0 attack minions are bad? ShockedPikachu.jpg
---
Why would it make another appearance? It doesn't make them enough money.
---
I think they're pretty locked on to keep the expansion-only thing for years to come.
---
R.i.p your opinion
---
It was all neutral minions too, basically. I had a couple of ‚ÄúPlay 20 [Class] Cards‚Äù quests and it was extremely slow to complete them in the brawl. One of the worst ‚Äòrandom‚Äô brawls we‚Äôve had I think. Not even random in a fun or silly way
---
Well, vilespine is not obligatory and can be substituted with assasinate or walk the plank. Bloodmage thalnos is not obligatory either (also not used in most versions) and could be substituted with a loot hoarder (most of the time you want it for his cycle). The only oblygatory cards are probably prep and cutlass (depending on the version) and yeh, those are epics though. But prep is a good investment for rogue anyway so not that bad.
---
The spacing doesn‚Äôt matter, same sitting, months apart, makes no difference. The more packs you open of a set the higher your chances get a legendary until you get to 40 which is when you instantly get one. Getting one resets the timer. There‚Äôs no trick (unfortunately) besides just get lucky and get more packs.
---
&gt;That just means playing true aggressive decks just got more attractive as they'll beat out OTK a lot of the time while control match-ups will be few and far between.  
---
Control seems to dominate:  
---
&gt;https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/252/mechathun-warlock#tab=matchups  
---
Aggro not as much.  
---
&gt;Granted, Mecha'thun Warlock, while popular, is the least successful Warlock archetype currently.  
---
That's what I don't get.  Past 7 days it has a really poor win rate yet it's the most popular deck for warlock.  I feel those meta stats are skewed by the worse performing "most popular deck" when there is a much better version floating around.  
---
It's not that it can't be beaten it's just that matches just becomes incredibly uninteractive - they get the rng they need and win or it doesn't pan out right and they run out of resources and lose.  
---
It just doesn't feel like I'm playing a game.  In saying that I feel the same about playing the likes of control priest, otk paladin etc. too.
---
wait when was the first tavern brawl?
---
Hard to say what the winrate really is because the deck listed on HS is a poor performing deck compared to the best performing deck with better stats that I've found does much better against aggro and hunters.
---
&gt;Yep, same with me. I saw this too late :(
---
Anti-beast tech cards confirmed
---
I INSTANTLY thought the 3rd teaser was something to do with Netherstorm. Where Dr. Boom is located. &gt;.&gt;
---
Competitive HS is an objective JOKE.
---
Blizzard has made it so.
---
"Dorian's Deathrattle Derby" Warlock deck. Fun combos : 
---
1) 8 mana Dollmaster Dorian and Sense Demons (I use it for Voidlords)
---
2) 10 mana Spiritsinger Umbra and Rin, the First Disciple (guarantees not losing the First Seal)
---
3) Bloodreaver Gul'Dan into a Void Ripper for major burst damage
---
guys, stop. one more thread and we are back to 9.
---
Scammer
---
I really miss them. They were the reason I got into Hearthstone, and I am feeling increasingly burnt out the longer they have been gone. IDK, maybe hearthstone is not worth it anymore.
---
Blizzard should be able to do both, most other devs can fix bugs and other small issues AND have a vision for future improvements 
---
Real question is why were you watching Curious George with such close attention?
---
Ah, general kenobi

Hey DonDrexler73, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters.

So, sure, players should exercise discipline and be aware of the cheating policy/rules or whatever. But, this whole kind of thing could be avoided if Bliz would just develop a tournament client, they could just have an option for the tournament organiser to disable chat or something. 
---
Ok I will 
---
No Neutral equivalent, the closest thing is the Rummager, but that only returns a destroyed weapon to your hand.
---
Fair enough
---
Ouch! So much salt. 
---
I'm suggesting that people don't delude themselves in to thinking they can get a full collection without money. They should either buy packs or be content with an incomplete collection
---
As I said, I'm perfectly fine with this system. However, I think people should know that they can never get a full collection without money.
---
oof...
---
Beat an odd rogue the other day beating down with 4 mana 5/6s when it was obvious I was two turns away from activating combo in mecha'thun priest. was satisfying.
---
Am I the only one who...
---
6 words
---
Corned beef hash is delicious‚Äîif you try it, just know that canned and homemade are incredibly different (I like both though)
---
I am not talking about banning like ten or twenty cards when playing. maybe one or two or three. 
---
If your deck consists of many standout cards, lack of one or two cards would not affect your deck. If your deck has one key card and the deck is not very polular, most people won't ban your key card. If your deck has only one key card and that makes it the top of all decks and the most popular, that become a boring game.
---
:'(
---
I'm so disappointed by this.
---
Now I can't really watch his streams anymore. What makes this doubly disappointing is that Pathra mentioned that APX was one of the only people who was willing to step up and help her with some coaching.
---
And now he's cheated...that sucks.
---
Fuck I wish they repackaged the Dungeon Run. It feels like they keep trying to "make it unique" but that just makes it less fun.
---
Log into the Blizzard.com website with the account you play Hearthstone on, then purchase it from the web-store.
---
Main issue with Cubelock is not drawing the weapon, but there's nothing that can tutor it unfortunately
---
I'm questioning your statement that I quoted.  
---
Clearly some say otherwise to what you say so how are you justifying it being "in a good spot"?
---
I guess it was karma, I hit a win streak at rank 8 and got all the way to rank 6 5 stars with it. He also had two gnomeferatu‚Äôs, one of which he played on turn 2 (which is a terrible play), but the second one burned a combo piece after I played Hemet. Conceded after that.
---
Just felt surprised that I‚Äôd get targeted like that lol, haven‚Äôt ran into any other OTK decks today, but I guess I was lucky.
---
[http://www.hspacktracker.com/](http://www.hspacktracker.com/)
---
This is super useful
---
also it looks like an gurabashi arena with the opening just how the circle is on it
---
If there's a pack you haven't opened yet then do so. You have a guaranteed legendary on the first 10 packs of each expansion(once you open a legendary just stop buying from that and go to the next one).
---
Usually buying from the last expansions is the best because that's what you are gonna keep for more time. Kft, kobolds and Ungoro are rotating to wild on April. Witchwood, boomsday and rastakhan are staying until april 2020. Keep that in mind.
---
Also...this is something I did, but you might not like. Since tavern brawl and some quests will give you classic packs,  theres not that much point on buying them, since you will eventually have all you need from them. If you are missing key cards from that you might want to buy/craft anyways. But that's all on you.
---
Look up the hidden achievements that give you gold so you can get more packs, try to always have 2 quests ready so that when you get a new one you can reroll the "worse" one. This will help you with getting more gold. You dont care about 50 gold quests, anything is better that those, try not to complete them so you can reroll them. 
---
So your logic is that broken shit should be ignored and not fixed?
---
That‚Äôs your average MechaThun Druid player.
---
Most Mechathun Druid players are actually good but ok...
---
Skip to 3:20.
---
That will show him cards he has only in gold, without the regular version.
---
Possibly playing around silence? They didn't play their outs, for sure.
---
You're right, everyone has those days this whole month
---
But all that buildup. Gotta get invested in the story before you read the end. Still, thanks.
