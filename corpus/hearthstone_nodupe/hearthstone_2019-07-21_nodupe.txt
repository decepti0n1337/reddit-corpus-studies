ive probably played just as much this expansion as i have every expac since frozen throne, just happens that its 2/3 weeks before new expansion release and  i've discovered TFT.
---

---
Hearth usually runs in cycles and these last 3 weeks pre new expac are always the quietest.
---
Nothing to worry about tho, you'll still queue games almost instantly. Not like it's Artifact.
---
bees + gloop look the most consistent and easy to pull of one. But I think in wild is where we will see the real elise druid combos.
---
Not playing Hakkarchivist warrior smh

Mindblast died to Vargoth.

You misplay a lot.  Everyone does.

Yup. I predict blizzard will cease to exist as a company in 5 years
---
Tavern Brawls are a thing.
---
No even druid in wild its either jade or token druid.
---
So you start with a 10 card deck and play a game against another 10 card deck while you both have 15 cards, meaning the first match is decided on mulligan. Compared to rest of the matches which are decided mostly on which treasures you lucked on.

I've been streaming for the last 3 years a variety of games but mostly hearthstone and get 3-4 viewers on a good day. It is really hard to get any attention so I think this thread is a really cool idea and wish everyone else that is struggling to make it as a streamer gets some love.

[Check out this Wild Casino Mage list to get a general idea of the deck.](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1223695-wild-casino-mage)
---
Your intuition was correct: Casino Mage is all about generating random cards, summoning random minions, casting random spells, etc. In Wild, [[Frost Lich Jaina]] provides a decent win condition with (theoretically) unlimited healing and minion generation.
---
why are people talking about a hat being blown off???
---
Oh god, as someone who has suffered in thr mechanical hands of those self rightous bits i find this hilarious
---
How many secrets do you usually have at one time with Paladin? We have a few 3 mana 2 2/2s that are unconditional and have synergy.

---
Yeah man a comic about a frog doing stuff like peeing with his pants around his ankles is pretty racist.
---
I’ve been trying, but I can’t figure out how a remastered Diablo 2 could ever be a bad thing.
---
Just like they did with my boy scourgelord garrosh :(
---
Dr Boom DK lmao
---
Theres also a sticky thread on the official forums for this reason.
---
Do you play Hearthstone off a fuckin microwave or something?
---
Or just add me now
---
its animation looks like the vulcan gun with crystals he holds in the key artwork. Gems rotating and shooting bullets at random enemy minions.
---
A good life granted, but likely a short one :(
---
likely because the later expansion were pretty much more loosely connected to wow like Boomsday Project or Gatzethan and Whispers of the old gods to name a few
---
Now this is why kept Emeriss as a F2P Player
---
Nope, RDU lost to Doc Boom.
---
This is now my headcanon
---
Old player just coming back into the scene after 1.5 years away.
---
Is exodia mage still possible? Loved playing it... nothing felt better than winning with that deck.
---
The blast from the Staff of Origination seared the brim of his Explorers Hat. Simple
---
&gt;What if you played it on 6 mana?
---
Both cards have a conditional - that isn't that unfair of a comparison. 
---
When the first Reno came out, if it was an omega-style conditional, it might not have had the same impact on the meta considering you were dead on turn 7 anyway. That said, omega-Reno would be pretty broken.
---
Yup, random everything, the all in method is to just search for the word random in the collection and add every decent card there.
---
Your main win condition is usually playing the value game as mage can generate so many extra spells and minions. Other than that, your opponent can fail to play around a card that you've already played twice or having some crazy luck.
---
“Hmm, well played”
---
If you like to play secrets, try out the Mysterious Challenger card in wild. Makes those secrets much stronger to get them all on the board at once and for free. Might be a fun thing to try out.
---
Love it man I definitely prefer yours. I think if you did a little more on the energy effect than you’d have a truly extraordinary card that captures the reno we know and love.
---
RANDOM resource generation
---
If I play Spiderbomb, you know it won't randomly generate a Hunter's Mark to my hand.
---
yeah, the biggest problem with this art is how it isn't made for an oval card frame, if you watch something like [this](https://youtu.be/AJ7fclkxv8k) it immediately shows how this kind of preparation makes for much better art
---
Between these animations and the music I'm regularly impressed by how they make it so that I never get tired of them despite being exposed to it for hours.
---
I'll check it out in the solo adventures or something. I don't like playing wild, it's like everyone has decks packed full of Legendary cards, or are playing super cheesy decks. It's not fun.
---
Only in wild, but yes, still possible!
---
I dont mean this in a negative light? I Play exclusively standard and cards like the explorers seemed aimed at it. As well as the discard Warlock card which seems perfecr for [[VoidLord]] and guldan.

The hat is missing a piece so that way you can look upwards. You don't lose line of sight or create blind spots, especially on targets that are above you.

Hats like this aren't typically worn to keep your eyes out of sunlight
---
This man has been away from front-line development for many years, and seldom appear in public. I don't think he is able, or would be responsible to make whatever difference you are thinking about.
---
Speak of timing, there can never be a good time for a co-founder to retire or quit the company unless everyone wants him to go.
---
A few years ago when Allen Adham returned to Blizzard, ppl didn't make that a big deal. It feels like these founders and early employees have to work into there 80s to stop conspiracy theories. When Chris Metzen retired after a successful release of Overwatch, a lot ppl still think he was forced to go. Just like I said, there is no good time.
---
You can say “No duplicates” and this will give you a list of all highlander cards.
---
I'd done some googling a couple days ago, and it seems most people share your sentiment. It seems like the people who do try to get new player into Wild, just want some fresh players to stomp, cuz wild has an very low and unhealthy population (idk if that's true, it's just what some users said).
---
Unless Reno's battlecry was literally "Make you feel as happy as you remember being, some years ago."  it was going to be a let down.

It's even worse. It's quest odd rogue paladin
---
Artistically AND mechanically!
---
Smash face, cutthroat, same difference.
---
Technically, it's still possible in standard via Luna's Pocket Galaxy, Baleful Banker / Faceless Manipulator, Jepetto Joybuzz shenanigans... But consistency and survivability is a real issue
---
Yes lil Timmy you win a gold star! For effort
---
Materia#6805 NA 80g quest trade. I will show but you go first.
---
People were arguing if that was his hat or not 😂😂😂😂 it’s obviously his hat.
---
Tho the combo guy made it irrelevant
---
Thats one hell of a board clear
---
Might be useful in arena but won't see play in standard with it being random and not discover.  
---
You get better value from Henchclan Burglar for 1 less mana.
---
I feel like this post is missing something.
---
It’s Azure Drake with rush.
---
it is i had a picture but it didnt show how do i add it i just made this account haha

nvm i figured it out its processing now
---
Yes... I dont know if i want disenchant it... Last time i disenchanted Golden Onixia and it was bad feeling :D
---
The bigger animations I saw for Magic felt kind of out of place to me personally.

Activision will replace them with more souless cronies.

Can you give examples? I can't think of anything (other than the Reno support).
---
Post buff, you mean.
---
I am a Fan of ... Violet ... Gadgetzan ...
---
Well let’s think about it for a second. Maybe people don’t like it.
---
I mean, as for Mindblast, changing it in such a way would give it a Druid-class mechanic: Choose One. And beyond that, it would just make the card more powerful than most set cards, which is not how you want introductory cards to be made. And as for Holy Smite, Clerics (essentially Priests) in DnD do something very similar. It's low yet reliable damage that you can't just scream "HERESY!" at simply because "direct damage is not in Priest flavor." Direct damage is in every class's flavor, just varying in strength. Mind Blast was an ultra-efficient burst card (dealing 50+% more, bordering on almost double, damage per resource (even taking into account the former card's lack of flexibility) as Fireball, a spell from a class that is known for burst damage) that neither fit Light nor Shadow Priests. Not to mention it easily combos with a previously-mentioned Classic card, Prophet Velen, making it even MORE efficient burst. 9 Mana for a 7/7 and 10 damage to the enemy face doesn't sound like something a Priest should be able to do, especially with some of the first cards given to you.
---
Each time you play this against a full board the animations would take sooo long.
---
why not boar?
---
I know that. 1 101/101 Pogo can kill 4 30/30 jades, and if both players summon the same amount of pogos/jades, Rogue will eventually win.
---
How am I getting these coins, exactly?
---
Bauble#2990 EU 80G Quest, You Go First!
---
If I had kept the coin.. idk
---
Hahaha okay. So firstly, the only emote I actually used during the ‘spam’ was ‘well played’. The only emote I her before that was ‘greetings’ because I was going to pull off a really rare combo. Secondly, I’m not gonna remove my post just because you don’t like it 😂😂
---
This would be better with stonetusk boar
---
Seems like you are the only one who likes it.
---
Every legendary card has that dragon on top.
---
Well that’s all that matters to me :). Harassing me about this is pretty contradictory, friend.
---
minions are definitely better for rogue,  rogue tends to run a lot of spells as standard and tends to lack beefy minions.
---
also minions work much better with tess greymane.
---
Pretty, Fun AND knowledge?! what a trifecta!
---
I mean, it's all still WoW music, with the exception of a few like Lazul and the League of Explorers.
---
Boar is played in more than 0% of decks above rank 15 already!
---
Yeah, but it's not worth it if I can't use them on my main account... :/
---
Holy fuck it's one card. Were you actively playing Mind Blast priest? No? Then what the fuck is the complaint?
---
Vanish was at least a someone commonly used card and the only tool rogue had for dealing with wide boards, yet for some reason people can't get over Mind Blast.
---
They slacked I guess? I hope they never get to release a card again... I'm sure it's not a big deal for them any way.
---
They are sleeping in on a nice sunday
---
The white hair woman looks waifuish.
---
can we get this to the front page, this situation is frankly unacceptable
---
because it's a japanese website?
---
Hunter must be smorc
---
Rogue must be tempo
---
Druid must be token
---
Honestly im tired of this. The developer must find a way to get rid of this so this game will be more interesting.
---
Burglar rogue is fun and not too bad atm. It is not too bad vs agro, so good vs control but its very bad against midrange such as token druid or giant mage. This is is a welcomed one imo
---
If most people understand it to not be a joke it’s definitely not clearly marked and wouldn’t be a very well done joke. Can’t blame reddit for that.
---
Everyone ignoring D.va
---
Plague of Locusts seems thematic as the set is Egyptian in theme.
---
Thats nice. Really impressive. I long for the day I get the same.
---
Absolutely true *cough* Ultimate Infestation *cough*
---
Yeah, but you see how that could be a problem for the "fun" mode.
---
Seems like a very solid Arena card. It's gonna kill a lower cost minion, stick on the board as a 3/3 and draw you a random minion.
---
10/10, would draft
---
I think the still unrevealed neutral legendary will be the meta defining highlander card, and Reno will be played in those decks because why not, but then he'll end up being really good anyways.
---
Oh it's there. I start the first level b4 I took the break.
---
I can just imagine the thought process going through this guy's head...
---
"Hmm, how many generations should his ancestors get fucked for....16?  No, too few......20? No, no, too harsh.....Ahh, yes, 18!"
---
nah, it's a classic chinese insult. i have no idea why it's 18 though
---
i hope its oger
---
Lol gReaT BurN BrO!
---

50% chance to destroy the Warrior matchup isn't bad IMO, although I think if you are gonna run that you should also run Jepetto, *or* just run Azalina instead.
---
Got it, it is a grammar fixing card that when played fixes all grammatical errors on cards that are currently on the board.

---
This would have been been very fun if it was done in like 4-6 hours. But now there will always be that one crucial piece of info that will be revealed tomorrow.
---
Mountain giant is quite popular in this meta friend, you can't just pretend the Omega part doesn't exist.
---
Boom and devastator are in the same class , they are somewhat meant to go together in a deck . IF you play Boom , you play mechs . Its like judging Conj without kadghar . Since they exist in the same class and are from the same expansion you have to take other card synergy in consideration when judging balance .
---
Do you have the picture in a higher resolution? Because it is very hard to read anything on it.
---
It's one thing to be salty and ask for huge nerfs but then pretending Conjurer's Calling is OK is just pathetic lol
---
And that interaction works especially because, if you look closely, [he has a Golden Dr. Boom hidden up his sleeve, implying he cheats](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/bpyxrd/the_great_akazamzarak_has_a_golden_dr_boom_up_his/)
---
So basically he creates these random legendaries, gives you one, realizes he gave you the one he uses to cheat, and then takes it back. The Great Akazamzarak is probably one of my favorite Dalaran Heist characters. He's a magician in a city full of mages!
---
Too weak, will never see play.
---
Make it "Play 1 of the same minion"
---
Mech tag doesn't make a difference in this case...
---
Fool, the best card is the one true God of Hearthstone, Gruul!
---
Pretty solid result overall, when else are you getting 4/8 off UR?
---
Over rank 25 sharks and pogos arent really played right now.
---
Would the game have elements which will be key to figuring out the card? And if so, would the said elements be reveal at once when the game starts or at a later time after the game starts?
---
A bit less drastic change would be to specifically exclude it from being Discovered by either the Assembly or the hero power. This is where it becomes ridiculous.
---
Not really an apt comparison. This is much more like a Malygos -1/-9 for 4 less mana that has swaps the dragon tag and spell damage for rush and random minion generation.
---

P2W SCUM HOW DARE YOU BLASPHEMIZE THE NAME OF THE SACRED BOLDERFIST OGER WITH THE PRESENCE OF LEGENDARY TRASH
---

---
O
---
I'm not even salty. Conjurers calling is only OP when used on giants because only 2 minions cost that amount of mana and so you can get insane consistency. If you use conjurer calling on a 2-8 drop your results will vary vastly. 
---
Is Conj+Giant OP? Yes.
---
Is Conj+any other minion OP? No.
---
Its neutral legendary between 5-8 mana.
---
Possible with 4/5 or 6/6 stats.
---
With Battlecry.
---
Maybe highlander card or maybe with taunt
---
the later
---
Doesn't look like it.. looks more like a Fire Elemental with some armor.
---
Some elements to the game are not currently live. There are two concerns that force us to delay things slightly: Timezones (giving Americans a chance to play along too) and ensuring clues are uncovered in more or less a specific order.
---
Think "Do X and unveil Y"
---
Wait what? The actual card will be revealed 2 days later?

---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias  you pay more attention to negative outcome. Btw. AFAIK in history of Hearthstone only few decks really benefited from starting with coin: cyclone mage and some rogues. Almost everything else had lower winrate with it. If you still don't believe install deck tracker and check after 100-200 games.
---
Take Murloc tag off of Underbelly Angler too and it'll be perfect LOL

I play [[Topsy Turvy]] on [Mana Chest](https://i.imgur.com/3sejgZW.png) and then play my epic neutral card u/SecretsOfUldum which has been hinting a very long time now.
---
Doesn't the silverback get the boat from the untamed cards? You still have to play them after you get them with crystology right? Which would take 2 turns unless you have 6 mana. You'd also have to hope you're opponent doesn't kill your Untamed cards, which would be very unlikely. You couldn't play it all in one turn since it costs 12 Mana.
---
And by then people won't give a shit
---
I use my mana and play /u/SecretsOfUldum, then I pass my turn
---
Okay, Darkkmane

The "5 mana award" was granted, similar to reddit silver or gold.  That part has been completed.

Yeah basically. More in depth would be. Draw bomb, take 5 damage, draw (another) card, then fill your hand with bombs.

rly solid card, decent stats and it has rush for good trades

I have thought a lot about Dungeon Run online. It'd feel like an arena, but it'd be actually interesting.
---
My thoughts as well, I would like your suggestions. It would already help, if the Giants wouldn't spawn the Grave Horrors. But I agree with you, it's so hard to fix CC. Maybe it was simply a mistake that it's designed as a twinspell.
---
I actually like Dragon Mage a lot, but it feels so polarizing to play. Cyclone Mage simply feels like cheating, especially in wild right now with the Quest.

But idk as well :D

Our dear OP just changed the flair, can anybody assume what changing up the letters mean? What else could we mix up the same way as he did with his flair!

FLAIRS = AILFRS

To be fair, it's unlikely that the HS Japan folks surf the internet, looking for errors on non-Japanese sites regarding when card reveals are scheduled to take place - if the English site posts the wrong date, they post the wrong date . . .

Looks like we gotta unscramble something

No, thats the opposite of true.

A year or two ago these 'busted' cards would have maybe been playable, but probably not even tier 1.
---
The card quality is so garbage that the few playable cards we have seem oppressive. And both omega (turn 10+) and conjurers (draw for 3-4 turns then make a play) things are only good because they've not printed any real aggro cards in years.
---
His hero power has a dr boom card up his sleeve. Hes a 'magician' in WoW that does card tricks and essentially the joke of the interaction would be that he gave you the wrong card.

Can't wait to lose against it and not be able to get mad at it.
---
Others else pointed it out already, but it's similar to Star Aligner in a way. Hopefully Blizzard learned they lesson and made sure it was playable this time around.
---
Even if you did Elise shenanigans to get 3 of these, the 8 card combo that deals 15 damage and can hit minions is not quite viable
---
Maybe he's Nexus Champion Saraad lost brother, Nexus Squire Naraad
---
Well yeah, if your goal is to just slap them down at full cost. but when has any combo been good without cheating pieces out.
---
This is what I love about wild and what I envisioned it to be when they initially announced wild. tons of decks that were viable and unique.

Hench clan hogsteed, the rush 5/7 taunt, witchwood grizzlies, somebody put cobras in their list which is iffy. The problem is that you want to protect the untamed beastmaster with taunts, but also buff them before playing..

The lowest of effort.
---
Yeah but if you're gonna cheat out 10 mana worth out cheaper, why not pick ones that do something instead of nothing?

Yeah, there was no single player content for Goblins vs Gnomes.

Great job, all reno are welcome here!  Post a pic when you've finished it.
---
What I’m curious to see is what class makes use of this the “best”. It’s obviously only going to be a meme combo deck but that’s what I’m wondering.
---
Quick, look for Sombra clues.
---
This is exacly what I thought. No way I would play this card even if it was a one-mana-cost-card. What a joke.
---
Don't worry, there's bound to be a Corridor Creeper in there somewhere. 100 crap cards, 30 deckmeat ones, and 5 completely busted cards that make people tear out their hair for three weeks until nerfs go out... to different cards.
---
I don't understand what this card does !
---
Where the hell is Evil Miscreant
---
because people like having fun, and making fun combos work. I highly doubt this is going to be a card in any top tier meta deck but it has a really cool design and has a lot of potential for many different classes to make memes. I feel like it'll find a place between mechathun and star-aligner.
---
You were nice in your review by using the word “seems”. 
---
It’s a meme card only useful as a combo deck that likely won’t really ever be played
---
Nope. Like half of the melee classes can use 2h axes I think
---
Star alligner is very different from this, the only commonality is they basically say "if you control *things* do *things*" but this is so very different from star alligner. 
---
Someone just wants to be a negative nancy.

This in my portal priest deck will rock.  All it needs to do is die once with my stealth death copier and the rest is all 1 dropping copies :)

yes

---
Nah thats for sure the axe pictured. Whether its worth anything is out of my league rn but thats the one.
---
This is basically what MTG does with Standard, Legacy, Vintage, and Modern.
---
This isn't very much like Star Aligner. Star Aligner requires 7-health minions on board and deals 7 damage to all enemy characters. It's also a battlecry. 
---
This requires 3 of three exact same card (already an obstacle for some classes) and deals 5 damage to a random enemy for each one. It's also an end of turn effect. 
---
They're only the same in that both require certain minions or types of minions to be on board and they deal indirect damage (not the same amount of damage or targeting).
---
These are the same just like Reno Jackson and Antique Healbot are the same...
---
how is going to betetr then malygos, or togwaggle with or without hakkar?
---
My exact reaction
---
What a great pull!
---
3 of these 5 damage 3 times to a random enemy. I mean 15 damage split in 3 sets of 5 sounds neat, but then you realize the effort of trying to make this work can't possibly be worth it
---
Does it work at 4 or more? Or specifically only 3?
---
&gt; Except you pay 10 mana and 2 cards for nothing
---
That's not how successful combo decks work. If it going to work at all they'll cheat it out.
---
&gt; 2x Unsleeping Soul
---
They would silence the first obelisk, you wouldn't get any trigger, only the boardclear and resurrect strategy would work
---
I like it too.
---
I don't know if you can even live long enough to get seven of those on board, but I know I'll try.
---
Fair enough, if your standard for cards is "good enough to see play in meme decks".
---
What the fuck is this
---
Oh absolutely, a hundred percent. Hundred percent. Young Jamie pull that up.
---
I mean ofcourse it's not entirely the same. It just reminded me of it.
---
And no I'm not. Most of the time I'm super hyped about new expansions, this time I'm not, is that not allowed? I know people try to fit every single card in a deck and 'make it work' but fuck that. This card is bad and I don't care about it. On to the next.
---
Oh shit u right
