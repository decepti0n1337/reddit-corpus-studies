4/-/- | Put a random minion from each player's hand into the battlefield.

because not often druid have more than 2 choices
---
&gt; The game should just have more options to punish large hands or counter things.
---
You punish large hands by going aggro before all that value pays off. And everything does have a counter.
---
Instala has deathrattle in its text but he isn't a deathrattle minion.
---
I guess fandral sinergizes with choose one cards but he isn't a choose one card.
---
I could've sworn watching a video where someone said back in the 90s (for the period while the mechanic was allowed) people would abuse the crap out of the mechanic and pull out literal toolboxes full of cards, though...
---
Is it? Seems like a better more flexible mana tide totem.  You can, for instance, coin this turn 1 then play the quest, draw, attack, and get quest progress on turn 2.  Seems good.
---
But you're only getting 7.....
---
That's like 1/5 of what they get...

---
If Kilber waited to play on turn 3 he would have got 4 mana 7/7....
---
But the Frogurt also has potassium benzoate...
---
Didn't one of the devs mention months ago that some card from this set was being a pain to code, but they were thrilled because they finally got it right and were excited to see the player reaction? It's almost certainly this card.
---

---
Arena good maybe. Too vanilla to be useful in constructed.
---
I‚Äôm so fucking ready.  *Welcome to our domain.*
---
"it's not power creep if it's a class card"
---
If I remember correctly, they said it was easier to understand the effect of the hero power in one read with the "both effects combined" they were not going to compromise the easiness of understanding the card for just one card.
---
It was something like that more or less but I can't find the exact quote.
---
I think people are seriously underestimating the power level of the Paladin cards. 
---
People keep saying that [[Pharaoh's Blessing]] won't see play because it's not as good as Spikeridged Steed. People also said the same thing about Marked Shot when compared to Flanking Strike, and yet Marked Shot still sees play in Midrange Hunter.
---
[[Sir Finley of the Sands]] reminds me a lot of Prince Keleseth. If you're playing a Highlander deck and you can play it on turn 1 or 2, then you're pretty well off. You could even try to tutor for it with Call to Adventure, Witchwood Piper, or even Murloc Tastyfin in the hopes of getting it out before Bomb Warrior gets going.
---
[[Subdue]] is basically a 2 mana Polymorph, which is ridiculous (remember when Hex was 3 mana?). Sure it doesn't get rid of Deathrattles or continuous effects, and it won't stop that minion from being resurrected, but we've yet to see if that's actually going to matter or not.
---
[[Micro Mummy]] is likely going to be an auto-include in Mech Paladin. Not only is it a great follow-up to Glowtron and Mecharoo, but it's also a really good sticky minion to magnetize things to.
---
And finally, [[Salhet's Pride]] is actually my favourite card from the entire set. It's possibly the strongest tutoring engine ever printed and can fit in a lot of decks. It can fetch Twilight Drake for Dragon Pally, Novice Engineer for OTK, EVIL Cable Rat for Aggro, a variety of Murlocs, and a whole lot more.
---
Sure, they may not have a distinct identity conveyed through their cards this set, but I believe the versatility of many of these cards more than makes up for it.
---
[old] quest rogue synergy?
---
And even if you don‚Äôt bother apparently it‚Äôll give you 3 solid choices at any point. 
---
Although for pros who put in the effort to learn him, he‚Äôs a very high skill ceiling card.
---
Okay but it‚Äôs dumb to wait to collect anything other than common right? All other cards should be crafted as needed.

I started playing back then and put maexxna in every deck. Of course it never turned out to be the best decision but hey, I was so happy I could put a legendary minion in a deck
---
Another card from this set that's pretty much a worse version of something from a previous expansion.

Spring paw is still better.

It‚Äôs an upside consistently for Shaman.  Shaman has always valued elementals, murlocs, and to a lesser extent, totems.  We still have [[Earthen Might]] and [[Elementary Reaction]] in the pool for the next 2 years.

No. Aggro is basically just "use high damage, low cost stuff to kill your opponent as quickly as possible" whereas token is more "use minions that generate minions to create a sticky yet relatively low-damage board presence and control the board until you get a big board-wide buff like savage roar or bloodlust as a finisher

‚Äúforgot to mention that paladin only has two barely viable decks in the current meta‚Äù

*cries in Druid*
---
Nerf it to a 4/5. Then I think since it's overcosted at 10 mana and 2 cards, make it 4 mana. But you can only play it on turn 10. Wait, shit, now you can play 2 on face. Let's make it just target minions.
---
Balanced card, let's effectively give it Rush, as Mage is weak right now.
---
Any midrange or control variant will auto-include these for sure
---
I mean, this card still is really good on turn 6 lmao
---
Which one in particular?
---
I‚Äôm curious what the discussion was for this card costing 2 instead of 3. You discount your secret by 1 and tutor it, and you can invest the mana early and play it later for the perfect moment or a combo of some sort. It‚Äôs already strictly good in a secret deck at 3 mana, 2 just seems overkill
---
Awesome! Thanks so much for posting this!
---
Why are you comparing wildly different cards with wildly different purposes?
---
Discardlocks may like this card
---
this was toasts card btw
---
One aspect of this card showcased in the reveal stream is that it‚Äôs also basically a +7 completion to the hunter quest, which is one of the decks I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be run in. It also helps with Beast synergies. But yeah otherwise I can see both sides regarding this card, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll end up being as broken as most people think.
---
Suffer
---
4 mana 7/7
---
It's a bad card, but intends to work with cards like [[fiery temper]], [[extractor demon]], and [[deep analysis]], as well as a counter to cards like [[ebony owl netsuke]]. There's basically no reason to run it nowadays, given that [[Lion's Eye Diamond]] is basically it except costs -3 mana instead of 1, and is older than one with nothing. One with nothing is technically playable in modern, whereas LED is not, but typically self-mill strategies are stronger than self-discard strategies. EX Dredgevine, a self mill deck, is the strongest deck in modern, while the closest thing we have to a self-discard deck is Mardu Pyromancer, which uses cards like [[faithless looting]] and [[seasoned pyromancer]] to power up [[bedlam reveller]] and [[lingering souls]], turning the card disadvantage into a temp advantage u/mtgcardfetcher
---
I believe brave frontier is also one of the top mobile games also
---
Imagine this with cube in wild. There's a meta defining deck for you.
---
Aggro versus Control Match-ups always come down to the following questions:
---
Can the controlling deck stabilize before the aggressor's initial onslaught is completed?
---
Does the aggressor have enough reach to close out the game before the controlling deck can start producing its threats?
---
At most, it was Zilliax being the last nail in the coffin in your deck's initial onslaught while propping their life total up enough to fully negate whatever reach you had left alone with whatever other healing they used. Zilliax alone wasn't the reason why you'd lose in the same was as say a turn three Corridor Creeper could.
---
there is a new 4 mana 7/7 in the game.
---
you just have to controll a secret when you play it
---
Even though this expansion is one of the more lore-backed expacs in recent memory (seriously, even [*Armagedillo*](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Armagedillo) is based on something from WoW-Uldum), I can‚Äôt find anything on Zephyrs the Great.
---
Looks like he‚Äôs a brand-new character!
---
Oh yeah your right lmao, disregard this shit it‚Äôs weak.
---
Set rotation makes it so that won't happen, power creep does nothing but make games slowly become yugioh.
---
Yes, but the adventure sets are much smaller than proper expansions
---
At 8 Mana, seems a bit expensive to be bouncing. For face damage I'm not convinced I'd run this over lifedrinker
---
Lei‚Äôshen? What
---
Yeah I thought as much... Guess I'll save up and buy them over time
---
I am still on the fence.
---
I don't know if i wanna purchase the 80 or just the 50. Only reason I would get the 80 is because I want that skin, and more cards is good. But, 50 seems reasonable because I actually don't care for this set. I think a lot of the cards are meh.
---
There's only a handful of cards I want to experiment with. Going to hold out a little longer
---
Hearthstone is dead tft the way to go
---
the game is played in more than one language, that's the problem we hit here.
---
The text for ‚ÄúMystery Choice!‚Äù says ‚ÄúAdd a random spell to your hand.‚Äù That means it can be from any class. While most would want the Discover option, Rogues probably play this for the Mystery Choice.
---
&gt;Which means that a card that is that insane dictates on its own whether the game's strongest decks are of a certain archetype or not - which leads, invariably, to less deck diversity, less variety, and overall less fun
---
Sure. Maybe in your mediocre vision of the game where ladder is still basically the only way you can play this will happen. 
---
Also in your vision...the game will be dead. Who cares if it's balanced if it has less players. Player numbers peaked in KFT and have been in decline ever since. 
---
Trying to make ladder hyper balanced is pointless. Ladder will always suck. 
---
&gt;Having a set selection of cards being this insane means that the decks making use of them will constantly, completely break the game.
---
This is what power creep is designed to prevent...you're the one advocating for horizontal upgrades. 
---
&gt;Pre-nerf Patches
---
About as strong as ultimate infestation or pre nerf scarab thing. 
---
A real game breaking card would be like Arcane golem with charge. Or leeroy at 4 mana.
---
I mean. I guess odd paladin could throw a patches package in and be pretty scary. 
---
&gt;is in that same category of cards that have an effect that literally cannot avoid seeing play
---
Just print something stronger. Ez
---
We running nomi hunter bois
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Nope, not gonna pre-order. Reborn mechanic is boring and uninspired, it's a deathrattle we've seen on cards already.
---
While the highlander cards look decent, highlander decks WON'T be a thing until bomb boi rotates. It also doesn't seem like it's worth building your entire deck around 2 cards. In the instance of paladin for example, it's a really, really great effect. But if you don't get Finley early it's all for nothing. That's what made Reno and Gadgetzan Highlander legendaries good. They weren't even meant to be played super early. You could, you could benefit from it but mostly they were better later on. 
---
There isn't a single neutral legendary im excited about. The class legendaries feel kinda meh as well, for the most part.
---
And lastly the quests. I LOVED Un'Goro quests. But this time... I'm barely hyped for the Rogue quest. Some of the rest seem really interesting and I'm looking forward to experimenting with it. On the other hand, we have incredibly strong and consistent builds currently that I don't see many quests around. Why would anyone play quest warrior instead of trusty bombs and/or control warrior? Paladins quest is... Questionable... Remember how Stratholme had to be purged? Well Fook it, we doing necromancy now bois... Priest looks promising and if we get a list in which it works well, we might have a problem.
---
All in all, I don't want to say that this is a bad expansion overall, I'm just not hyped whatsoever. I'm kinda underwhelmed even to be honest.
---
I don't think it's reasonable to argue that. Mad scientist was so broken because of the body. 2/2 stats is worth 1 mana, secret=2 mana in hunter or 3 mana in mage. The body gave the tutoring effect that extra oomf it needed to see play.
---
Can't wait to pull of a Twisting Nether from Zephyrs when my opponent has a full board.
---
It's a small indie company, what do you expect?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the whole point of the mystery choice is to give players the option of trying for another class‚Äôs spell. Otherwise, why bother?
---
It was a couple of months. Turns out Aviana + Kuhn enabled really crazy minion combos. And Kuhn has 7 health.
---
‚ÄúWell I win unless he has like Octosari or somethi-‚Äú 
---
*opponent plays Octosari* 
---
‚ÄúWhat the FUCK dude this is BULLSHIT!‚Äù
---
What I wish it did was show the card when swapped so then that play would have been genius.
---
This even playable?
---
Surely include line cracker with bees for the potential 80 damage
---
I don't personally think this card is good since there are no good mage secrets in the format like to tutor for ice block. Seems worse in wild than mad scientist too. Just don't think this makes the cut anywhere unless they print some absurdly powerful secret or secret synergy cards in the next coming sets.
---
Noone remembers Big Recruit Warrior? I thought that was pretty damn fun.
---
Does he choose from the hall of famed classic/basic cards when played in Wild?
---
This is one of the strongest mage cards ever printed
---
Looks like a white vulpera to me
---
I keep seeing people say how high the power level of this set is, but after seeing the whole set together, (and maybe I'm just being pessimistic) I don't see control warrior or big mage slowing down AT ALL. Dr. Boom is just too good, and there will continue to be games decided by 3 8/8's on turns 4-6.
---
and deck is what a stack of cards is called.
---
rys... the ending is "phrys"
---
say it out loud
---
What in the holy eff dude?
---
I've been already playing Bomb warrior the past days with great success and a lot of fun. There are quite a bunch already since it's a pretty well paced deck that performs super well.
---
If highlander turns out to be very powerful and consistent, you'll see even more Bomb Bois.
---
Honestly, I don't think highlander will seriously kick off until bomb warrior rotates or they print support to remove the bombs. If they print "bomb removal" it would kill the entire archetype as well tho.
---
thank you. But Ogre is the best card in existence.
---
The mystery choice will be taken by Rogues that are looking for activators for their thief synergy cards.
---
I like how the tauren seems to be heading towards an oasis, the location of two of the new choose one cards, Hidden Oasis and Oasis Surger.
---
Don't need to breathe when you're a MECH.
---
what's an aggro deck in the meta ever that wasn't a token deck? even going as far back as the original zoo the idea was to swarm the board with 1 and two drops; minions don't have to come from 1/1 generators to be synonymous with a token strategy. the one differing factor of playing a bunch of burn spells in an aggro deck isn't even classified as aggro anymore, it's combo
---
And plot twist
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Well this will be removed soon
---
for some reason he's diminishing the term of a token deck down to needing to buff the board, which is archaic and reminiscent with MTG when in reality any deck that's filling a board with cheap minions is a token deck
---
except deck tier, they won't have a tier 1 deck anytime soon
---
Any moron can use Defile lol. It's literally just counting up numbers.
---
Let the format play out a bit first.
---
Chances are with no new tools looking like they'd definitely fit within Bomb Warrior and mechanics like Reborn primed to really stretch how far their control tools can go, the Highlander-Bomb Warrior match-up may very well become rarity.
---
WARRIORS OF THE FROZEN WASTES, RISE
---
&gt; Sure. Maybe in your mediocre vision of the game where ladder is still basically the only way you can play this will happen.
---
Okay, I don't know what dream land you're living in, but you're obviously playing some strange, otherworldly version of Hearthstone that us mere mortals can't touch. I don't know where this ladder thing comes from, since we were talking about power-creep and card design. If you want to advocate for another system than the current ladder for Standard competitive play, that's fine, but it's a completely different debate.
---
You are correct!
---
This is one of the strongest expansions to date. You must not play a lot
---
I dont give a shit about context. Im reporting this ignorant shit
---
Wrong kind of randomness though. It's hard for me to explain but ML randomness feels more wrong because it's usually right and so the wrongness takes you off guard
---
Heart of the cards: the card.
---
If chickens aren‚Äôt mammals why do they have breasts
---
Remember when they said they wouldn't make anymore Highlander support?
---
Microtexh controller, rafaams scheme, scarab egg - would be broken.
---
lmao who upvoted this obvious hoax card? 
---
haha it's a fake card guys hahaha you feel for it, it's a fake card it doesn't really exist it's fake I can't believe you fell for such an obvious prank. 
---
it's fake.
---
Go on r/hearthstonecirclejerk for serious discussion.
---
True, and that elemental tag is still very relevant.
---
well then your question wouldn't have been answered. But since they don't, it has.
---
Have 2+ spells in your hand. Play this, then play [[King Phaoris]].
---
Is the set fully released? I wouldn't be surprised if they printed some sort of neutral anti-bomb card like [[Skulking Geist]]
---
Well I tried to look for high cost spells and these were the only ones that fit the mold and as for treant synergy, the only synergy is with the high cost spells, so I kinda avoided it

---
I think the new mid range decks will be way more faster, and bomb warrior will lose his place in the meta, I just hope for it.
---
The new quest are more fun to play in my opinion, especially the druid one, and are not that difficult to finish depending on your starting hand.
---
I think bomb warrior will be pushed aside in the first 2 months.
---
This card is undoubtedly strong and fun, but I don‚Äôt think it will be enough to push highlander decks to t1 because the AI just isn‚Äôt smart enough to consider your hand/deck and your opponent‚Äôs; rather only considering board state and mana.
---
For instance, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre facing an aggro swarm deck like murkoc shaman. T1 they drop tidecaller, t2 u drop this...it‚Äôs going to check board and your mana and think ‚Äúhey give him a tempo 3 drop!‚Äù You know you need board clear to survive the oncoming onslaught, so Animal companion won‚Äôt really save you...especially if you already had a good t3 play in hand....but this card will only see one 1/2 and not consider board clear.
---
What happens if you play this t3, floating one mana, against 2 murlocs? You‚Äôll want something like consecration, but would it offer only 1 mana options? Even if it offers 4mana options, i doubt 2 enemy minions is enough to warrant board clear
---
I‚Äôm just skeptical that this will be quite as good as everyone thinks and along with how much highlander decks are weakened by their requirement it may not be quite enough like Reno + Kazakas were.
---
Is that a reference to a certain morally gray action taken by a morally gray character?
---
What? No, I mean actual Even Shaman. Like, with Genn Greymane.
---
Intense spoiler season for Set 16 begins!
---
Idk I just think the card goes against what the deck wants to do. Don't get me wrong I think it's a powerful card, just not in this deck
---
Nobody plays 3/2s in Arena. If you watch streamers they will always pick a 2/3 over a 3/2
---
With supposedly morally grey reactions?
---
This is great. *OBLIVION!!!!* im going to run sacrificial pact
---
Wow that guy is trash, rank 20 with BP? No wonder he takes that cancer to casual.

Overload is way better in the early game as you sacrifice Mana for tempo to snowball an early lead. It is why Totem Golem and Flamewreath where the powerhouses they were.

Not against decks that fill the board.

Maelstrom Portal but Overload 1 and you always get an Enchanted Raven. That sounds pretty good actually.
---
Boy I wish I had Zayle
---
One of the best (or worst) options this could pull is Shirvalla the tiger.
---
Promptly transformed into a 1/1 sheep the next turn.
---
Secret Hunter will be top-tier off the back of that Hyena alone, mark my words. That new Hunter secret is actually pretty legit too.
---
*&gt; black cat ~~walks by~~ moves to hall of fame*
---
oh, I meant to type "also" but it somehow became that and I didn't even notice
---
Damn that was fast
---
Looks like it's playing a e guitar, can't unsee.
---
Pretty sure the HoF is considered it's own set.
---
Pog
---
And yet, vs Giants Mage you still have to actually kill the giant.
---
What? Bomb warrior is the one of the most commonly played deck in standard
---
Ultimate Incineration
---
I only roped him one turn because I was trying figure out how to maximize the shadow reaper anduin hero power
---
Found the Murloc shaman...wait, even Murloc shaman would love this. TF are you on about?
---
It also has great synergy with clerics and pyro which are priest staples. I think the best comparison is to a flexible circle of healing/spirit lash. It will be used for draw most of the time, but combined with even one or two useful pings that‚Äôs good. So you don‚Äôt need to be wiping out a board full of tokens for it to be good.
---
It's almost $130 in New zealand what a joke.
---
Or reborn, or is part of a token/lackey deck, or leaves a target to buff/magnetize, or can be silenced back to full stats, or resurrected...
---
A polymorph this is not.
---
I get that, but everybody knows the decklists after the meta settles so you'd just assume they'd have the card anyways.
---
Wtf? The power level of this set is insane. This is going to have an immense effect on the standard meta.
---
When can we begin?
---
Probably works like Likkim
---
Hey, no wishing for more wishes!
---
I just realized I misread this argument hours ago. I'm with Steve on quest priest sucking XD
---
yeah that would be terrible UI.
---
&gt;But this card gives you the secret immediately, which is insane.
---
Getting the secret immediately isn't insane, its just ok. Getting the secret immediately vs getting a 2/2 isn't even close in terms of powerlevel. Mad scientist didn't see tons of play because of the discount in mana or the 2/2 body, he saw play because he provided both at once. Getting both is a 2-for-1, meanwhile this is just card parity at a minor discount. This card is good in a dedicated secret deck, meanwhile Mad Scientist and Arcanologist are good in any deck that happens to have even just a few secrets in it. This card is far worse than both of those cards, not to mention that the secret pool now is worse than its even been before with the lack of Explosive Runes and Ice Block in the format.
---
I wouldn't disenchant any of those, Loti is getting support next expansion but if you had to I would choose him.
---
I guess, the choice is for Mojomaster Zihi, because 2 other cards could find a place in some decks.
---
Not to be hateful but rather worried - what it's happening with the card art quality recently?
---
I've seen at least 10 new cards this morning, and they all look like they've been painted by a struggling to break into the industry amateur.
---
Is blizzard that cheap nowadays?
---
By the way would that card be used in like a zoo Deck would that work
---
When can we open them? Cos it‚Äôs technically August 1st (1:30 am)
---
That is the reference being made, yes.
---
Not even for the memes that makes it somewhat playable
---
Basically I only need 400 more dust King Mukla lol basically because I think I can make a really quick killing Hunter deck
---
Damn, I thought only Tekahn would have an important part in the lore of this expansion. I thought to myself Vessina should appear, considering all other legendaries we've seen weren't the henchmen for the class they represented.
---
I'm glad I was right, but I'm also confused as to what will she do for E.V.I.L. in Uldum alongside Tekahn.
---
And its f2p friendly
---
Can be used to tutor [[high priest amet]]
---
Have fun running highlander decks for every class then.... this card will not nearly be as ubiquitous as Zilliax.

4/2/7 | Whenever you summon a minion, set its Health equal to this minion's.

These options are so restricting.

What if I am purchasing 200 with only gold? It isn't an option.

I am going to buy one of the bundles and use coin to get 120 packs.

Na.. Naga Sandwich?
---
Like the design. Will change the flow of games. Let‚Äôs see it in action for a few weeks. Good job, Blizzard
---
It is and they didn't.
---
HS devs were different 5 years ago when they were releasing the game‚Äôs first ever expansion.
---
well reno is there    
---
so thats a dragon for you
---
Quest priest will literally be a tier 2 deck
---
It does, said someone with knowledge on r/CompetitiveHS
---
Dayum
---
My reaction to this card as an aggro player: *** WWRRRYYY!!??***
---
You need to specify in the title that the lucky topdeck was drawn by you and not the bomb warrior. People are easily confused here like if you say dr boom some people think you mean the o.g. dr boom from ungoro and others think you mean the rise of shades dr boom when in fact you intend the hero card. It just gets diggicult to differentiate in card jousting gamed after they are active a few years many cards have similar names. Anyway at least you have provoked a healthy discus here and other new card jousters will be made aware of this from my comment also
---
There's so many good ones...
---
Oh that Rogue spell Shadow of Death I really liked the colourful but menacing purple aura radiating from the tomb...PLUS DAT BOOTY And the Shadow token art looks dope too
---
You forgot ‚Äúdiscard a card‚Äù
---
second up is **hunter**!
---
**existing archetypes**
---
mech hunter (tier 1)  
---
deathrattle hunter (tier 4)  
---
midrange hunter (tier 4)  
---
spell hunter (tier 4)
---
**quick ratings**
---
NAME | RATING OUT OF 5 | QUICK SUMMARY
---
---|---|----
---
Hunter's Pack | 2 | decent enough in standard, but way too unreliable in wild's card pool. maybe playable in spell hunter to add a bit more sustain to your zul'jin
---
Pressure Plate | 4 | not great against wide decks, but there's always the chance that it hits the biggest threat on the board. plus it can, rather hilariously, immediately kill a freshly resurrected big priest minion
---
Desert Spear | 1 | understatted and a rather bland effect. you have better removal, as well as better token generators. use them instead
---
Ramkahen Wildtamer | 2 | combo potential, but if you wanted to run a combo, you'd just use hunting party, which is actually reliable. still, maybe useful for a little more gas in midrange hunter
---
Hyena Alpha | 4 | not too hard to trigger, and a 4 mana 7/7 ~~overload 2~~ across three bodies is pretty damn good. secret-oriented midrange hunter isn't really the flavor du jour but this and pressure plate might be enough to bring it back into style
---
Swarm of Locusts | 1 | makes your zul'jin garbage, and doesn't even provide a particularly strong removal for the cost
---
Scarlet Webweaver | 4 | a useful combo enabler, unlike wildtamer, and is also decent enough in midrange beast hunter, allowing for a big swing turn after it drops. unfortunately, i don't see any useful combos at the moment, but keep an eye on this card in the future
---
Wild Bloodstinger | 3 | fuck yo combo. also really bad against big priest unless somehow they have barnes in their hand on turn 6 or later. a spicy tech but doesn't really offer anything that dirty rat doesn't already do
---
Dinotamer Brann | 3 | hell of a finisher, i guess. also pairs disgustingly well with his loe counterpart. not entirely sold on reno hunter, as its lack of aoe and removal is a big red flag, but at least it has an endgame plan
---
Unseal the Vault | 3 | very good reward for midrange or spell hunter, as both generate enough tokens to get the reward before turn 20, but it's still on the slow side, making it a lategame contingency for decks that don't generally look to play the super long game. plus, you typically don't want to spend your turn 1 playing a quest in a tempo-oriented deck, which is more a problem for midrange hunter than spell hunter. interestingly, this is probably the closest we'll get to a playable double quest deck, vomiting 1-drops then buffing them up
---
**is the new quest better than the death knight?**
---
no. dk rexxar creates infinite, gamechanging value, while ramkahen roar makes your existing minions a bit better. rexxar will singlehandedly swing control matchups, while ramkahen roar might put your minions over the top, if giving up your turn 1 didn't already cost you the game
---
**any neutral cards worth looking at?**
---
almost nothing. khartut defender might provide a bit more survivability to deathrattle hunter, as an alternative to applebaum. otherwise, there's always zephrys for the giant question mark that is reno hunter.
---
**changes for existing archetypes**
---
hyena alpha and pressure plate slide nicely into midrange hunter, and pressure plate and possibly hunters pack can fit in spell hunter. otherwise, mech hunter gains hilariously little (just the flaming garbage pile that is mortuary machine), and deathrattle hunter gets a few subpar options for budget players
---
**new archetypes**
---
just reno hunter, which still has the same old problems of having fuck all hard removal and aoe. hell, you might end up needing dinotamer brann as removal, not a finisher
---
**how about our lord and savior of jank, mogu cultist?**
---
that's gonna be a hard no. there's stitched tracker but otherwise absolutely nothing. now, if mogu cultist was a beast, then you'd be in business, with hunting party and ramkahen wildtamer making a handful of mogu a feasible goal. but as it stands, don't bother
---
**overall**
---
a weak **2/5**. support for reno hunter without fixing its problems, nothing for mech hunter and next to nothing for deathrattle hunter. midrange hunter and spell hunter have some toys but considering their current spots in tier 4, i don't see them becoming major meta decks by any means
---
i'll be back tomorrow with the remaining seven classes, until then, feel free to leave any corrections/questions/feedback/death threats/mogu rogu decklists below
---
Four months is still a long time for a class to be shit in Standard.
---
It is not that big of a deal really: There's a Demon on board? Here, kill it.
---
RIP for the Eredar Lord of the Burning Legions though...
---
probably dodging what happened with deathstalker rexxar, the community getting pissed that card doesn't update with new expansions
---
Also DMH Warrior
---
This would be insane coming out of a piloted shredder
---
Definitely the best of the 3 :D
---
Fuck you mean, till 2020?
---
Doesn‚Äôt quest Druid seem more like an anti aggro deck though? This card, the 6 mana taunt heal, the  new arcane tyrant etc. are all good vs aggro but not control. I still don‚Äôt see how quest Druid will ever kill a control warrior. If you want to target control, lucentbark is better. A lot of these quest Druid cards seem to be targeting aggro..
---
Why does [[Dreampetal Florist]] reduce cost of a minion by 7?
---
No real reeason, there is no real flavor in all cards nowadays.
---
I don't think Caverns Below was the easiest to complete, even if on  average was the fastest (I'm not 100% sure on that either). It definitely had the most broken reward though.
---
I feel like the natural companion is cards that gain an end of turn effect if you have no unspent mana. I worry a little that it'd promote curvestone, but as long as it's not a huge mechanic just a couple cards I think it'd be cool.
---
Yeah I totally get that. You‚Äôll find it easier this month though because you‚Äôll start at a higher rank. I used to grind to legend each month (I‚Äôm not f2p) until I released that it‚Äôs not worth the effort when the reward is basically the same as rank 5. My advice would be to keep trying, get your legend card back and then just enjoy getting to 5 each month without the soul destroying grind :)
---
These dodes used minecraft logs lol
---
This comment is long and has a lot of upvotes, which leads me to conclude that in 8 months we will all be laughing at this comment in its naive glory. How we could have ever questioned Unseal the Vault will be a chuckle for generations.
---
If you're looking for profit, play wild. You don't need to spend much dust unlike standard.
---
and rexxar, fun enough the card that change hunter's hero power to +2+2 to your beasts is playable so i kinda trolled myself there XD
---
Blizzard heard about suggestions for conjurer's calling to be nerfed to five mana, so they made it happen.
---
Legitimately just you.
---
Holy shit - Why even watch his stream?  This simulated version is scarily accurate.
---
Have you ehm... Ever won a game with this deck? It seems very slow.
---
Calm down Kripp.
---
You know during the pirate warrior days and even today to a smaller extent, bots would just spam pirate warrior all day. Surely two bots have played eachother countless times by now, but who's there to watch??
---
&gt; Remember Fel Reaver?
---
The arena card? It saw close to 0 play in constructed; Not even among those who wouldn't die from fatigue, nor played combo decks.
---
Eh, it‚Äôs decent but after Kalimos rotated it‚Äôs much less powerful. Un Goro was the expansion that really made elementals strong
---
Combo disruption disruption...
---
Fine. I'll take it.
---
Is it a running joke to call Rogue "rouge"? I see so many people doing it.
---
The card was played several times and it yielded the same three options each time and Peter Whalen went on to say, and I‚Äôm paraphrasing, that on an open board or small board early on it‚Äôs just about always going to pull those three cards because after 500+ games those 3 cards were considered the most winningest cards in that situation. Similarly to how later on, he predicted the three cards it would pull by looking at the board state and nailing exactly what it would pull which I believe was flame strike, brawl, and ancient of war. The way he explained it made it seem like there was a decent level of predictability to it once we get used to playing it.
---
why would you turn a 3/4 rush into a 1/1?
---
Because there was more tools to interact with minions with lower attack back then.
---
And as the other comment below, the power level of cards is much higher now. 
---
Many things that were played back then, wouldn't see any play in this meta.
---
How is jade Druid tier 4? All the meta reports I‚Äôve seen place it much higher, at the very least high tier 3.
---
It also requires another card to function. Sure you can use zap but it‚Äôs more likely lightning bolt will be used which would make this effectively 5 mana. I don‚Äôt see the point bloodlust is just better.
---
This card is great. Literally the first decently costed, damage, removal spell Priest has gotten.  Synergy with Thalnos especially with Holy Ripple also present. Synergy with new Priest quest. It's even thematic, for those who didn't know Penance is a Discipline Priest signature spell and Discipline Priest specialise in dealing damage and healing themselves and allies based on how much damage they do so the Lifesteal is appropriate.
---
[Mad Summoner], summon 14 minions for 6 mana. ;)
---
Don't understand why such a succesful streamer give a fuck about reddit.
---
Damn nice catch, edited
---
Squemlish is so cute! If Blizz were to make him hero skin I think it'd be my very first time to purchase skin stuff.
---
Yeah but tokens die to small aoe. Quest druid doesn't at all
---
In the words of tal Bachman... She so high.
---
I think this some result of machine learning at work. I was suspecting the same with automatic deck building in the last brawl. Electing the best decks and making slight changes / optimisations is would be a cool way to teach the algorithm.  Perhaps this card also has ML behind it rather than static suggestions. Would be cool to read an article on this if its really true .
---
Would be cool if perhaps /u/mdonains or /u/IksarHS can confirm deny : ) Just for my curiosity
---
Mr. 8/8/8 top b8 I rate it 8
---
This is played when you have a full board, mossy horror is played when you have an empty board. Completely different cards that go into completely different decks.
---
I was thinking similar idea but knife juggler instead of Edwin.
---
Can rel8, str8 appreci8, no h8
---
It would probably still give you a flamestrike since it does take the possible trades into accound.
---
However, if you're facing a board of 5/5s and have a coin and arcane explosion, it would give you a flamestrike after you played the explosion and coin, but if you didn't damage the minions first, it might go for something like twisting nether or blizzard instead, depending on other circumstances.
---
I can't wait to play with that card!
---
Except*
---
Maly Rogue is back?
---
I mean, the community was kind of right here, he didn't play Hearthstone for a good while now, and you have many Hearthstone content creators (Like Thijs, the example from Toast) that didn't get to reveal a card. 
---
They would probably feel bad if someone who barely plays Hearthstone lately got to reveal a card while they play the game daily and produce content and don't get to do that.
---
Yes, he did put himself second to resolve this problem, but it was the right thing to do, so props to him.
---
"Alriiiight dude... alright... huffffffffff"
---
It either tries to spend the rest of your mana or the next turns mana perfectly and according to the board stage picks very specific good cards from classic or basic set
---
If they have doomsayers they give you the 2 mana alchemist that flips his stats or it gives you sac pact vs jaraxus or board clears regardless of class.
---
Warlicky
---
Bingo. If the meta features multiple wide decks, this might get teched into them. Otherwise it's just a good arena card.
---
In that case, you may want to fix your image, since you're suggesting Zephyrys is the correct spelling.
---
Doesn't that hurt your OCD?
---
This is the power of GER
---
In wild holy wrath paladin, running Baleful Banker alongside call to arms is sometimes awkward. maybe this will mitigate the downside of CtA pulling banker such that you can put CtA and Crystology into the same deck...
---
Decklist?
---
Ye rogue is the main reason we dont get good neutral taunts/healing anymore. Back when rogues had access to healbot belcher and deathlord they were deemed way too broken.
---
Well technically it's 373 because amazon coins
---
Naxx out?
---
you still have to kill it tho, so you have to combo with something else.
---
Savage roar? :-)
---
*heavy breathing*..... Noice...
---
I went sceptre of summoning, double battlecry, and c‚Äôthun. It is also important to pick early game  tempo plays if you choose this path as you need to survive until turn 5 to play multiple c‚Äôthuns
---
You shouldn't hate people for having different opinions...
---
Yeah, but what is easier 8 damage or any ping? It basically makes any minion 1 ping away from death, so it is 2 mana if you can deal any damage to a minion, destroy it
---
May be worth trying out some combos with the new Quest... though the Quest itself doesn't seem like a very playable card atm.
---
Fountain would do.
---
The thing with the CC mage matchup, is that this card still requires follow up to kill their first giant, which makes it true mana cost higher. Then if the opponent has multiple giants already, its not as good, leaving you in the same scenario you were in with shrink ray. That scenario being that you don't have enough mana to clear both giants and if you just leave em as  1/1s they come back next turn as 8/8s. 
---
So the dream scenario for a pally mage matchup would be you have a silver hand knight on board when they play their giant and then you play this and get a free trade. Once that happens once, mage will never play into that again lol
---
I have a feeling people will be wrong about this card. I don't think summoning 20 minions would be that difficult really, what with all the mech 1/1 deathrattles. And then you have a load of sticky deathrattles which suddenly become very dangerous once you have the quest hero power.
---
Holy shit they decapitated the carousel gryphon and put a damn statue on it. Finally we rejoice
---
No division line between Rogue and Shaman cards. Yes. It is a minute mistake. But surely worthy of being pointed out. It basically invalidates your post. Jk. Nice picture.
---
I have tried a few variants of this deck and the biggest issue is a lack of card draw. I think the new 2/3 draw if you have a quest helps, but it still is lacking
---
No furious Ettin?
---
I usually play this deck when i am at rank 20 15 10 5. I concede freely to anyone but big priest. Once I see a priest  I destroy them without any mercy. I simply give the ranking system the justice it deserves and encourage these who's been frustrating by the virus
---
They already play Elven Archer and your hero power makes 1/1s. They also play Crystology to find Novice Engineers and whatnot. It‚Äôs even well worth using a Truesilver Charge to get rid of a 1/1 Giant if you have to. None of those options are available if you use Aldor. That‚Äôs a huge difference.
---
‚ÄúhoLY shit‚Äù
---
-this thread
---
I don‚Äôt know about that, just that I personally didn‚Äôt think about the Mountain Giant combo and nonetheless thought the card is way too good.
---
#MY JAWS THAT BITE
---
Cool this Posts exists purely to Show us you got a golden jaraxxus or what youre trying to Show us here.
---
But honestly, if you can't kill one or two 1/1s on Turn 4 or 5 then you're already in a losing spot. 
---
And that was one example, you can use this for any big minion. Even against a 4/4 it is stronger than most removal (2 mana deal 3 is the standard but also remove 3 attack).
---
It‚Äôs been awhile since I did it, but I think I beat dungeon run with priest making a zoo deck. 
---
I agree though, priest was by far the hardest for me.
---
I got priest done on my second run... Didnt know it was hard
---
Equality died for this.
---
[[Call of the wild]]
---
Genius
---
Is he playing a guitar ?
---
Obviously you would follow it up with a kill, you wouldn't leave the 1/1 giant on the board. By turn 4/5 if you don't have the ability to deal 1 damage you're in a bad spot. It is hard to remove both giant but even removing 1 giant with a 2 mana card is better than nothing.

how do you ping in pally? maybe in OTK pally you have elven archers. Pyros are another option.  I understand what you're saying, but im not sure it improves my chances against CC mage without putting other bad cards in my deck

It already cost 7

This sandwitch looks delicious
---
133 from preorder plus 3 from tavern brawls. Then however many from gold until I reset the pity timer. Then wait for additional free packs handed out from events, then reset pity timer once more.
---
Or you can play shaman and not lose against anything else
---
Sorry, but this can't be forgiven. You are now banned from r / hearthstone.
---
Its one thing to have a different opinion, its another to be a dick about it.
---
i actually think in aggressive vs aggressive matchups, titanic lackey is quite strong. one of the better options for sure. It makes your opponent send their waggle pick or savage roar'ed minion into your minion instead of your face. This is a lot better than getting a semi random, often useless spell.
---
Come on, man, cut me some slack...
---
Its name rhymes with rich, and I can't use *rich* without mentioning Reno, not in this expansion.
---
It's also a Mage card (like the new Reno), and it could definitely make a cut in some variant of Reno Mage (Pyroblast, Puzzle-Box of Yogg Saron, 10-cost Kazakus Potion, etc.).

---
Why? Which advice is terrible to you?
---
Nah this game is clearly on its last legs.
---
twitch and 5 second wait times seem to be telling me otherwise
---
It's a 5 mana 3/12 after shaman's new quest is fulfilled. Sound familiar?
---
And mage was premium class just because of flamestrike
---
But.... those are relative terms.
---
Back in the day we used to say a mage deck wasn't worthy without two frostbolts and two fireballs.
---
Yeah it's absultely not a given that there'll be a free wing again
---
What about rogue? With fire fly 1.5, burgle for 2 mana but spells, more expensive blinkfox with rush, open the waygate but ez pz that gives you the fiery candleshot?
---
200 is usually what's needed to get the full set, maybe more if I want some Golden's but I usually craft those first.
---
Well if you wanna continue playing baby's first card game I'm not gonna stop you.
---
I know it doesn't give you 3k.... But there's 10 packs you'll be able to open early.
---
And, besides that, if the wings open similar to how it was last time, there will be a month or so between the release and the last wing.
---
I started during wotog and didn‚Äôt actually buy packs until un‚Äôgoro and I play wild quite a bit.  While that means I do have most cards from JUG onwards, I have been able to get by missing previous cards and only crafting a few specific ones like sludge belcher, deathlord, gangup and healbot. I also did buy the league of explorers expansion, mainly for brann, Reno and thaurissan and that‚Äôs been pretty useful.  Overall I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôve been playing for a couple years and have a decent collection you probably can get by, even without having bought packs.  But if you‚Äôre just starting out it is definitely pretty daunting and most likely impossible to compete without spending money as you‚Äôll get run over by almost every deck, since in wild pretty much everything is busted.  Still, you don‚Äôt necessarily have to craft every old card, as there‚Äôs tons that are never played and many of the fun and powerful cards (think thaurissan, N‚ÄôZoth, Rag. And Sylvanas) and even some of the common basic cards like the healbot and deathlord I mentioned previously, are neutral so once you craft them you can use them in for any deck/class
---
first card game? my friend you have not a clue.
---
Naga sandwich sounds like the wurst sandwich in the world.
---
I think he means Wild. 
---
The Explorers are alright, but there doesn‚Äôt look to be enough support for any highlander decks this expansion, so I‚Äôm doubtful this card will see much success in Standard right now.
---
Obviously in Wild it will be slotted into every existing Reno deck right away.
---
One of the reward's name contains Obelisk, though.
---
It's going to be a rip-off if you pay gold
---
Why the fuck has this been downoger'd?
---
Do you mean immersion?

It should still pull from Basic/Classic (*not* Hall of Fame) so I don‚Äôt think it should matter.
---
It seems like the only things it looks at are current/next turn mana, number of minions on each side of the board, attach/health on each side, cards in hand, etc. The deck builder gets awkward in Wild due to not basing picks off winrates, but the stuff should be the same to measure in any format.
---
But isnt the quest hero power too good to replace it with hagatha?
---
I have one though it's also what I'm studying. Programming and illustration. 
---
Also no one hurt me I just feel like talking shit. :)
---
I played it like you're saying, and it wasn't very good. I was not running a meta/viable deck.
---
Ogerkill
---
Damn.. was looking to run an executive producer deck
---
~220
---
It didn't. They literally just said that, twice.
---
This looks like a gatekeeper deck for one of the rank floors (or legend)
---
Control Warrior will indubitably remain the best deck in the game. Nothing beats an infinite value machine + 29 removals.
---
yeah, thought i'd have to change my game plan to being the beatdown instead when the first pogo dropped.  
---
then i saw the scheme + goblet on Zilly.. welp.  
---
GGs!
---
Bots exist
---
The cease and desist must have arrived before they could announce it.
---
Appreciate you posting these. I try to check myself, but I seem to miss them. Same for the amazon coin deals. Always notice them after the deal is over.
---
I think all your points are fair. Hunters pack is probably the least likely because it's RNG, whereas Raiding Party is not. But I still think Beees is possible because if it's not the Linecracker OTK, then there are still other crazy synergies that people will try to find.
---
the scheme, goblet and barista lychen combo..
---
vs my 2 owls.
---
you can also put a copy of that weapon that prevents you from die
---
Control Pally in Un‚Äôgoro was awesome, with Rag Lightlord and forbidden healing and finite resources. It was strong in the right hands but never oppressive. Then Death Knights came in and changed the game, then Equality was nerfed without any real replacement AoE. 
---
Heal Paladin seems like it would be fun to me as a heavy midrange list, but it‚Äôs usually too reactive to be consistent and doesn‚Äôt have a real win condition.
---
Secret/Beast hybrid was something I tinkered with recently that just wasn't *quite* as good as the current optimized Secret deck with the non-beast synergy cards.  
---
This new guy might be enough to cut Secret Keeper and Masked Contender for some juicy beast synergy cards.   
---
Also, we shouldn't count out the new beast/secret/weapon generator.    
---
We might start to see Zul'Jin almost guarantee a complete hand refill every game!
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt realize that lol. That‚Äôs a relief haha
---
That‚Äôd be a big brain play
---
Dude is literally just running around threads mentioning how he'll get 400 packs. Dude probably will have 10 with gold and the couple of free ones.
---
Also there are board states where you wouldn't want all enemy minion attacks affected, just one. Not power creep
---
And how do you think that relates in any way to being able to suggest cards in a real game? Do you understand basic logic? Do you even play this game? So many questions.   
---
&gt; Being able to complete a deck by copy pasting a known meta deck is absolutely nothing like being able to read a situation and suggest a useful card.
---
concede in game

&gt;this box has been left intentionally blank for use at a later date.

Agreed, which is why Maexxna is better
---
Yes, and?
---
Last I checked, there was more than one republican.
---
I've heard plenty of conservatives say that equality of opportunity is bad, because opportunities have real costs and because the market needs to stay free. In practice, plenty of republicans (and even many democrats) support things like private education which, while not inherently bad, do inherently fuck with equality of opportunity. Nobody tries to ban expensive private tutoring. Nobody tries to ban exclusive networking events. Nobody tries to ban you from investing massive amounts of money into your child's business. So no, not all Republicans even want equality of opportunity, and the ones who do don't always make it a priority.

Ah yeah I forgot the duplicate thing
---
clarksa#1228 NA - 80g trade, you go first
---
You really expect that Cyclone Mage will let you get to 9 mana ?
---
Drawing 24 when there‚Äôs nothing in your deck and you haven‚Äôt fatigued yet is 300 damage. If you can get the 5 to stick before you activate feign death you draw 40 and get 800 damage
---
My suggestion wait for the expansion cause the cards are insane in the new expansion.. However don't craft any cards until a couple of weeks into the expansion if your playing to win on the ladder ..
---
Sent FR.
---
I didn't know duplatransmogrifier was in standard
---
Europe, sorry forgot about it and it's kind of crucial
---
Tribute summon 7 allied minions with the name "Mogu Cultist"
---
It is... If you wait enough turns.
---
save it I think
---
Wait, did your opponent actually just take one of the top standard decks and play it in unranked Wild? I think we've found Satan's account everyone.
---
No
---
I meant the other one xD
---
couldn't rememberrr, the greatest card in the world
---
**Somebody ordered a bomb!?"
---
Fill board with imp card just found its use. Also the bees one in the new expansion
---
your hero power creates ping dudes, that they cant answer with their own ping the same turn they play a giant in the early game because of lack of mana.
---
You can't cheat out Hunter's Pack for 0 mana with Prep.
---
K is for Khadgar, the more the merrier!
---
He won't know how to power up a Van Cleef because he doesn't know private information, including which cards are in your hand. You'd also probably rope long before he got off thirty knives with a juggler, and skipping turns with animations has gradually been getting better, as the server estimates for extra time have gotten more accurate.
---
But yes, I now see the general issue with a card that can be replayed infinitely.
---
Doesn't need to be slow necessarily. The AI could play faster than you could follow. Only slowdown is effects, and those can be sped up as well.
---
I wish for Infinite Wishes!
---
100g fot the pack
---
the 80 dust is about 2 packs - 200g
---
a golden rare - 100g lets say but actually worth more, + 200g
---
Yep, definetely. There is a song with the same name and it's constantly stuck in my head.
---
Unplayable
---
Yeah odd pally is hated but it's effective however most people can't stomach playing discard warlock due to the devastating RNG effects so not only it's bad but people hate playing it but I love it
---
Kazakus is still more powerful IMO. Zephyrs can't polymorph an entire board of mechs/big priest minions BUT he can be more useful at earlier stages in the game.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt think quest Druid is as good in standard as there isint a ton of good cards for it
---
Darking#1612 NA 80g quest trade. lfm
---
80 dust is the worst case scenario for 2 packs, so I would put it at 150.
---
Golden rare is definitely not worth 200 gold
---
LoE Aggro Shaman was pretty good
---
&gt; Chadd was on the record about cards that allow him to replay himself being excluded for gameplay reasons - https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/1156638516614455296
---
I don't think you need archivist in this deck. Seems like you have enough juice to bait removal and have extra to build a board and push for the win in control match ups.
---
I dont see how this deck can manage to deal with Mage but against Rogue this deck should be able to hold and you should be able to out value warrior.
---
Damnit, I just pre ordered last night thinking there hadn't been one for a good while so it was probably safe.  Just my luck.
---
Some people assume that HS follows M:tG terminology in which your "deck" is all your cards.
---
My bad
---
Purifier, PURIFYYYYY!!!!
---
what did I JUST SAY
---
Just keep checking the hearthstone store page once every hour or so.
---
I mean, yeah, they really should still go back and fix those. Cards like [[Swashburglar]], [[Hallucination]], and [[Blink Fox]] are still gimped in wild thief rogue, and it's still really fucking annoying. But I'd settle for them fixing the bug where I have to restart my game every time I use my golden evolve otherwise I can't use my minions.
---
Ah well, there's always the next time.

Did you use this one?

Yeah I tried to play this game out since I was in ranked, but I ran out of steam before my opponent since I basically wasted both of my books. I had to Astromancer a 2 drop and a 1 drop at one point in the game. It wasn‚Äôt pretty.
---
Ah yes when I want to play priest I want to ruin other people‚Äôs days with big priest in wild
---
This should help explain how it all works. If you go to a prerelease event at a fireside gathering, you can open them early. You should be able to create one pretty easily without establishing a tavern, but you might have missed the deadline.   
---
Otherwise you just have to wait till release day!

---
Should work.
---
Yeah you might be right but I think that 1 card to really increase your winrate against warrior and control chaman is fair as you have a ton of draw
---
At that point I think you‚Äôd be running too many deathrattles in a battle cry deck. It‚Äôd be cool to pull off though.
---
I think having a really really bad one could be
---
That's why I was comparing Octosari to MUE in Odd Rogue specifically. Odd Rogues would basically never be 8 cards away from fatigue. Odd Rogues couldn't prep it. Odd rogues would only get a 3/3 on the board during the MUE turn. 
---
Although this can be silenced, I really don't think this is too big of a deal; Either your opponent silences it and leaves an 8/8 ready to go face, kills it and gives you a refill, or silences AND kills it. If your opponent has been holding a silence and a hard removal in anticipation for your Octosari turn, Octosari did it's job long before being played, and if they just happened to have it the entire game without feeling pressured into using it, a more tempo-positive minion probably wouldn't have helped your situation too much.
---
I am so sad right now.
---
_Hiro-san! Show Miss Weaver what's in the box!_

---
Keep duplicates of the powerful cards for maximum profit.
---
I don't know that recurring villain is good for undertakah, he would come back without deathrattles which makes him just an 8/5 body.
---
[[Majordomo Executus]][[Ragnaros]]
---
You get to put 6 cards in your chess deck, just put these 2 in.
---
Come to think of it, I think this version of Big Spell Druid looks better than Highlander Big Spell Druid. I like Elise a lot, but Barista does what Elise does in terms of winning the game for us (add more King Phaoris to our hand), and do you REALLY need more than 3 Phaoris's? I don't think so. You're also less likely to get gimped out by bombs, you get to use a ton of imba cards like Hidden Oasis and Oasis Surger, Barista is just nuts with Oasis (yes, I would play to play 10/10 worth of rush and then add two copies of Oasis Surger to my hand thank you very much). 
---
So my thoughts are nix 1 Forest's Aid for 1 Overflow and replace Elysiana with Barista, since we want to win the game and Barista is useful in way more match-ups. 
---
I would also like to somehow squeeze that 2 mana 1/4 draw a card dude. Warmage is the most likely card to drop - it's awkward on turn 5 because it prevents us from playing Hidden Oassis or Hidden Surger on turn 6 and once our quest is online its completely outclasses by other cards in our deck. 
---
Other than those changes, yeah, I'm going to say RIP poor Elise, this is the direction to go with the King Phaoris shell.
---
What's even going on in this picture?
---
And now I pass my turn to summon HIM.
---
You always get one from a pack or by crafting, no in between, classic.

8/8/8 Elemental | Can't attack. At the end of your turn, deal 8 damage to a random enemy.  
---
Oh I can imagine. I've been playing this type of deck lately, while very fun, if you low roll on the book it can screw you over in many ways.
---
Mmm I actually never thought of your hand being "private", that's a bit sad, if you play it on turn 2 and have an excellent turn 3, it proposing you turn 3s is not nearly as good as it could be :/
---
Yes, more, you can take screenshots and share them
---
Well i wouldn't say the "easy way", it's just the deck and class you feel the most comfortable with. I really like priest and have played a lot of decks with it (spiteful, highlander, big, zoo, dragon, etc) other than that i liked paladin, warrior too on the early days, but i dont like control warrior or otk paladin for example right now. Murloc paladin was on another level on the LoE days, and pirate warrior was just superb aggro, but mostly i try to build priest decks that are non meta and learn to pilote it
---
What???
---
Imagine saying a 6/6 taunt that restore 12 HP and 5 mana 10/10 rush is bad. I don't... what? What?
---
Have you heard of 0 mana sound the bells?
---
I was watching Allistraza's theory crafting stream and she dropped Zephyr against Druid and it offered her Harrison Jones, lol.
---
And of course, because QA is hard (I get paid for it) , Titanic Lackey is something you can get from Lackey cards.
---
ok thanks i will do this then, since u play from older expansions, i am confused about the packs on the arena, after the new expansion comes out, are we gonna get the uldum packs 100% everytime we play the arena?
---
ah ok, sorry I got confused, I thought he was talking about the paladin legendary in the pic
---
Could also change out Inner fire for Topsy Turvy. Add in a smite or power word shield for that last bit of damage.
---
Do u not  check  my hero power?
---
Hero Power is \*public\* info .
---
&gt; I lowkey wish blizzard would rebuff the card either to the first iteration
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Card_pack_statistics
---
According to this, 102.71 dust per pack is estimated
---
The lulz over Warriors is hilarious.  If you're so triggered by warriors role up a deck in wild and stomp on them.  This is the first time Warriors have been good in standard in ages.
---
The only one I can think of is Curious Glimmerroot, but you don't have control over which card you get with that card.
---
He's not Classic/Basic.
---
Mind if I null Mead?
---
Yep yep! I can't tell you how many times I get a turn 4 Mountain Giant, turn 5 Khadgar into Conjurer's Calling for some insane value. Almost as bad as Naga Sea Witch in Wild back when it was still 5 mana.
---
I would like soo much to provide a screeshot.... i defeated 9 bosses in total with priest. On the other hand... i have around 150 bosses on hunter amy tips?
---
I can't wait to burn my retinas out playing reborn minions that glow couldn't be a bit more intense? Like it's so over the top it seems like an impaired vision helper feature
---
One good answer in a deck that can‚Äôt find good answers the rest of the time. SO OP
---
Hard counter. Not even worth running if it's gonna get removed that easy
---
it's pretty clearly photoshopped...
---
Hey now yours is doing the same thing!
---
Aura effects before Crystal Core always had an obvious source, however - a permanent you could see generating the aura. Crystal Core had some unintuitive elements; even Brian Kibler mentioned that it seemed like you could silence it off the minion (like you can with Barnes, etc.)
---
Damn, that makes it a lot better. Consistency-wise, earlier turn lethal, and 30 with 10 mana 6 cards.
---
Yeah it only looks at public info.
---
Almost as if Obelisk and Ra are two commonly referenced Egyptian themed things
---
Oh good grief.  Dr. Boom will rotate out eventually and you'll be moaning about another class.  Just go to Wild if it bothers you so much, warriors are trash there.
---
 Secret mage is going to eat that strategy for breakfast, isn't it?
---
New secret + flakmage is not going to be kind to token boards.
---
That one makes sense. Heal opponent makes a lot less sense imo
---
Sonya is core to the deck and they nerfed the interaction quest rogue had with Sonya, this actually is a pretty legitimate nerf to quest rogue (not that it was super meta in wild)
---
Or just ignore the fact brawl is an auto include in every single warrior deck and always has been. Name one other card that‚Äôs been the same way?
---
can't wait to see this in ~~Impossible~~ completely plausible OTK combos
---
You just post this over and over and it's not funny
---
I meant it's put to shame by the original leper gnome. 1 mana 2/1 deathrattle deal 2. 1 less mana for the same stats and only daeling 1 less.
---
its also only going to run like five secrets and two are already clears anyway. but yeah its not going to be a strong matchup.
---
How I was supposed to know his Reddit account when I added him in Hearthstone?
---
In fact his ign is different than his Reddit name.
---
Glimmerroot is strictly worse than a random thoughtsteal, it only looks like discover. (Well, I guess if you know your opponent's deck, you have the option of not getting the card with glimmeroot, but eh).
---
Why would you wanna limit yourself to a highlander deck just to get this combo? Shaman doesn‚Äôt have another highlander card to make this worthwhile.
---
Check the new posts and see for yourself.
---
no
---
Haha, you're absolutely right. When you're on the lookout for it, it is so easy to spot but uhh... yeah, I normally give people the benefit of the doubt and wouldn't expect some tard to shop like that.
---
Would magic trick be played without sorcerer's apprentice though?
---
Druid and hunter look strong.
---
Warlock looks shit.
---
It's auto included because it's the only true board clear that warriors have.  Seriously, if Brawl was so unbelievably great then why is it that warriors suck in wild?
---
Mike Donais helped Regis build a deck centered around this combo on the theory raft stream today, so yes, it does.
---
No one cares about wild at all
---
So can I get new legendary through Rafam?
---
No, it could just burn a random card and neither player would have any idea that the burned card wasn't on the top.
---
However, if you Mischief Maker, and then Gnomeferatu, then it has to burn the card from the opponent's deck, so the order has to be preserved after Mischief Maker.
---
Cuz it looks like fun
---
Maybe the update intended to push the lackey before the cards since it doesn't affect collections? Was that in the notes?
---
Yeah, its almost as if I didnt actually mean what I was saying and instead used an absurd comparison in an attempt to elicit humor from the greater community...
---
For le epic memes!
---
Yup these stealth nerfs are bullshit. No reason not to give out dust for it.
---
atleast is something said and wasnt tried to pass of as a bug fix like tess(when they said it would work like prenerf yogg) same for lynessa being random order after said it was fixed. And both got a cap of 30 cards which they orginaly dint have aswell. but tess change was reverted(acting like nerfed yogg) so maybe this could aswell?
---
Arcano egg and zilliax come to mind. Could run kangor's too to get them back. Those are the best targets I've thought of. I'm not sure it will be enough however
---
So downvote it and produce what you feel is valuable OC.

I really want a video of this. All I can imagine is Brann starting to swing onto the board, then swing away as Carnassa storms in.
---
the deck wouldnt be issue at all would be pretty niche anti control deck, if was 4bounces and 5mana giggling then id yeah would be issue but it isnt.
---
Its because alotta time people wana also have fun in wild cuz all the cars are there. Fun decks with more decisions tend to be slower and those are the decks that just get farmed by big priest.   
---
Also decks just unfair
---
The perfect card is going to just be zombie chow every time, every... time....
---
Not sure what youre feeling but it aint salt. More like disappointment. Looks in post history and finds that you made one of those shit posts ha!
---
Good question. Blizzard, why do you hate priests?
---
The deck 100% needs at least 1 Tundra Rhino. It's your finisher. Turn your 4 mana 7/7 into an extra 7 face damage. Turn a hand of 3 lynx and rhino into 13 face damage. You need Rhino to go face against decks that can ping off your board repeatedly with whirlwind effects, dynamotic, rushing microbots, etc.
---
You mean you can get it right now before the expansion is even live?
---
I just jumped into a draft and it offered me the cards from Grand Tournament, and GvG. Is your deck still intact? Are you able to queue up against other arena decks?
---
Because it starts tomorrow
---
Ive played like 50 runs this expansion and ive seen about 7 legendaries
---
I dont remember how i won with hunter, probably with big minions or permanent stealth
---
Of course, how could I forget the memes?
---
But really though, its a stupid interaction. Its already sad enough that Warlock's class legendary is completely unplayable in most metas anyway, but its even more stupid that in the small chance that it is good, it can literally be 100% hard countered by a single card.
---
Congrats! üôè
---
Yes, and when Sea Witch was nerfed it offered a dust refund. Same as the past 2 times Crystal Core was nerfed.
---
HCT is standard? i was on about wild. Quest rogue was not played in wild outside giggling at 5 for 5/5's

Hey Zethfox, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".
---
It's no deckbuilding constraint, but one of the current best decks hard-counters it without even trying.
---
It can‚Äôt give greater arcane missiles though. It can only give cards from basic and classic.
---
What is the best way of getting those? I ubderstnad that my cards will not be useable in a year or so.
---
great explanation! But damn it is hard to neatly explain stats spread between two bodies. How do we properly compare this card's worth to a single bodied minion? What is this value or tempo equivalent of this card put to one body? 
---
Or is that impossible to gauge because of the nuances?
---
All I did was put plague bringer in my deck
---
I wonder if it takes overloaded mana crystals into account.
---
Gonna be tough, I only play as Paladin.
---
It seems to prioritize providing something playable that turn and if that‚Äôs not possible provides on curve options for the next turn regardless of what your hand looks like.
---
Report back once you've tried it. I find most of my games end when I have 10-15 cards still in my deck, so I'm skeptical you'll see much benefit, but maybe if you had a partial-highlander deck (only have 2 of a select few cards), it might work out.
---
Why would anyone roll greed, ever?
---
Eh wot
---
Well basically if you dont need it. For example if its a hunter helm, thats technically an upgrade for you, but your a warrior and you wont use some of the stats. You hit greed, and if none of the hunters actually need it you might get it. But if you hit need and steal it from the hunter the guild might kick you.
---
Uh oh...
---
Porque no los dos
---
Presumably that would work.
---
It‚Äôs called common courtesy
---
I agree. CC should cost more and they need to print new "bad" 12 and 10 mana minion. Now they have colossos of the moon to play with. It is a toxic deck.
---
None of your business!
---
Agreed. I like to play midrange/control type decks in wild, but have pretty much a 0% win rate against big priest. Pretty much the only way to win vs big priest is aggro and kill them by turn 6. I hate playing brain dead drop every card in your hand and win by turn 6 aggro decks.
---
According to the patch notes, they did it to keep consistency with the new Warlock legenedary that makes your lackeys 4/4s.
---
They wanted a quest reward to be consistent with a battlecry minion. Buzz off, Blizzard. At least call it the nerf that it is.
---
Haha, I was joking, I'll add a /s.
---
Wasn‚Äôt today but I pulled a Golden tirion from my TB pack and a golden nozari from a 2-3 arena run.   Not too bad!!  Haven‚Äôt found a home for nozari yet.  The search continues.
---
It's going in my Reno Casino (original)Quest Mage deck for sure. I'm assuming we can't have two quests at the same time.
---
Which did you get?
---
Arena update already seems live. I got cards from new rotation.
---
open the waygate and elise trailblaizer
---
WELL MET!
---
Free Priest quest card
---
I haven't played a multiplayer game of HS since One Night in Karazhan.  Just single player stuff a bit and then check out the previews before each expansion.
---
Having the cards in English would help me understand this quite a lot.
---
That‚Äôs a really a super fair trade off.  As long as it‚Äôs golden it doesn‚Äôt really matter if you opened a crappy legendary, you can just do what you did and trade it for a regular version of something better.  Congrats man!
---
The possibilities are endless
---
I‚Äôm so sick of Blizzard not fixing it. It‚Äôs being raised dozens of times on their bug forums yet nothing ever happens.
---
I imagined the quest would be played in an aggro deck, making heal both player effects counter productive
---
This is the worst market strategy. It's so bad that Blizzard abuse this so much.
---
They weren't really given any new cards either.
---
I love lazul but this is one of those cases where knowing what‚Äôs coming does almost nothing for you.  Still such a great card and the next logical step from chameleos (pretty sure I spelled that wrong lol).
---
&gt; the Draw 2 murloc card should give you 2 worthless murlocs too if you don't have murlocs
---
While I understand your point for consistency this would be a HUGE buff to that card. Even two 0/1 Murlocs would be huge to get since they are all about buffs
---
What do you mean? This card is worded the same way as [[Hunting Party]]. She adds a copy to your hand.

5/-/- | Copy all Beasts in your hand.  
---
lmao at least you don't have 6 different useless weapon :v
---
it's been there since the beginning, it's just much more rare than bob
---
It says "copy a random beast in  *your hand*."
---
It should be pretty easy to figure it out from there.
---
Added you
---
Wizbang is in wild?
---
Too large of a buff to prep.
---
F
---
It should be an exception to the rules
---
Because it looks pretty much the same. I don't know why they wouldn't choose a different color at least. Not to mention how stupid it is that every reborn card glows by default so the entire board looks like a christmas tree at all times. Like you couldn't put the indicator on them if they've already revived?
---
Old Quest Rogue had a similar problem. Abysmal winrate, but in the games it won, it won easily, and people loved playing the deck. 
---
The core issue is that Big Priest, like old Quest Rogue, is a very polarizing deck by design. It very easily wins its favored matchups, and very easily loses its unfavored matchups. The rest of the meta is shaped around this fact, and people love the deck and aren't going to stop playing it.
---
And Quest Rogue ended up getting nerfed. Twice.
---
I don't know man, I can't say I'm a strong advocate for it, but it definitely seems like Big Priest should be addressed by the logic of Team 5 and how they handled the Rogue Quest

That system altogether barely exists anymore. They have changed it to personal loot, both in raids and in dungeons. Meaning you can only ever get dropped items you can use. And the need/greed system is no more, instead you just get the item. Say a boss dies in a raid of 20 people, 5 people might get loot, rest get nothing. 
---
To workaround this of being unfair more established guilds are using addons like Loot Council. Meaning after the boss dies and players have looted the items, every player in the guild gets to choose between different options e.g. "Minor or Major upgrade, maybe even BiS, off spec, pass, or just for transmog etc." Then when everyone has picked their option the GM and Officers vote on which player gets what. Then whoever looted the item trades it to the player who "won" it. 
---
But in Guilds who aren't using that or just pugs you can go through a raid dry if you're unlucky and everyone needs the items they're getting. If you're lucky the say they don't need it and everyone who does writes /roll 100 and then you'll might get it that way. But that's the closest it really gets to rolling anymore. Sorry for the long answer.
---
A refund to what all?  Caverns Below only?  Doesn't make sense, many other cards were affected.  Cards affected by the change like Sonya and Barnes?  Not a hard line, many cards were impacted by the nerf without being directly affected.  What about the cards only run in conjunction with an affected cards, like Waxy?  What about cards that one dude may have crafted to run in an impacted deck but doesn't use otherwise?
---
Slippery slopes are a problem when core rules are adjusted instead of individual cards.
---
You want people to continue playing with you on future raids. Not all characters can use all equipment. If you are a hunter in need of an item that a mage can't use, it makes sense for the mage to let the Hunter have it in many circumstances.
---
I think there is an option to not be in the running for the item too. So you can choose "I don't want this", "I only want this if nobody else needs this", or "Gimme, gimme, gimme." Then you hope other people are equally generous when it comes to items you need.
---
Quick someone check if whizbang allows you to play the recipes early like last pre expansion patch
---
What‚Äôs confusing? Shitting on Blizzard for upvotes I suppose
---
This card should be compared to flametounge totem rather then bloodlust. Flametounge cost 1 less and is unconditional but has terrible stats and onlyn affect adjecent minions. This card has much better stats on its own, and works better with Thunderhead, I could see this being playable.
---
Kripp called Bomb Warrior last expansion in his early access so, no.
---
Yes, only that card is live already
---
Oh wow lol. I'm sure it'll get patched. Neat how a lackey got throygh.
---
Ah excuse me, I tried to search around but I couldn't find anyone mentioning it!
---
Welp.. thanks for the correction.
---
English is ambiguous,  Op is correct in stating that in can be interpreted in different manners. As someone else has pointed out however is that there is already a card with this text that does as you say, "adds a copy to your hand" but if we've learned anything from blizzard its that they suck at being consistent thus it is still a fair question to ask. Not so straightforward especially if the previous card didn't exist (or you're new to the game) as a reference point.
---
You have to shout, "Heart of the cards, guide me!" when you play it.
---
Wow I didn't even recognise day9 for the first half of this video.
---
It was basically trash before.  It's never had the strength to be particularly competitive in Wild, especially post-nerf.
---
Can we open packs early again?
---
Im a little dissapointed that Jan‚ÄôAlai didnt get any support :/
---
For some people, it kills the hype. For some people, it makes them cash out. Obviously more people will cash out, otherwise Blizzard wouldn't do it.
---
Remember the last time they did this, with multi class cards being changed to not trigger burgle synergy, weakening the deck significantly in wild? You probably don‚Äôt, because blizzard refused to acknowledge the nerf and everyone forgot about it. I‚Äôm willing to bet this will play out in a similar fashion if people don‚Äôt make a big deal out of it.
---
[PLACEHOLDER], the mightiest of all bronze dragon flight.
---
Doubles a Beast in your hand. Seems pretty clear.
---
A good player, now pad yourself in the back
---
Sometimes things like that need approval/update from other groups before getting pushed.
---
i hate my options getting more and more limited. Now Quest is gone.
---
I really wish an unnerfed mode, or sth like that.
---
English is ambiguous.
---
But this is pretty standardised in Hearthstone.
---
It adds a copy to your hand. It's not ambiguous at all if you know how Hearthstone vernacular works.
---
I won't double down on this statement, but I believe if it were to be put on the board it would say "summon a copy of a minion in your hand" or something like that. I could be wrong though lol.
---
I definitely remember that, and I still feel they should have given some refunds there.
---
It‚Äôs not 1 lackey though. It‚Äôs a choice of 3 so you get to pick from a very small pool
---
THE LIGHT SHALL BURN YOU!
---
Must be nice not having any other problems in your life.
---
Sounds like me trying to pad out an essay
---
Dr. Boom was one of the only remaining hero cards so it had way less to do with the new cards and more so the hero card still there. Why Control warrior is super strong without the bomb package. Your complaint still is pretty inaccurate and silly. One streamer knowing one deck would be good isn‚Äôt refuting anything. Of course we know some cards will be good and some archetypes look very good but these streams and early access don‚Äôt refine the Meta faster or prove anything.
---
Oh god no.  If you think that Quest Rogue is trash in Wild after this nerf, imagine how it'd work against unnerfed Machine-gun Priest or Pirate Warrior.
---
I am the same as him.  Never seen in game chat or on wow reddit people say "leggos". Played for over 6 years.   
---
Maybe it's a guild and server thing for you.
---
&gt; no means a WoW lore expert, but from what I know, the Mogu are heavily Pandaria related, and have nothing to do with Uldum.
---
*Cracks knuckles*
---
*Actually...*
---
[Lei Shen the Thunder King,](https://imgur.com/MQOlPZo) who you might remember from the greatest Mogu Empire to ever exist (which is around about the second greatest mortal empire to ever exist on Azeroth, just behind [Queen Azshara's ancient kaldorei empire](https://imgur.com/9P6hAOh)) and [the newest Shaman Hearthstone Hero](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/The_Thunder_King) from around abouts the time of Rastakhan's Rumble actually *met his demise* at Uldum.
---
Now, for anyone who doesn't know, Lei Shen is [one of the most badass mofos](https://imgur.com/3YrdJOF) when it comes to power level. Granted, he would easily fall to the likes of the leader of the Burning Legion, Sargeras. I mean, [the dude could cleave Lei Shen's planet in half.](https://imgur.com/0oAJbxj) But let's take another famous villain who we know he could beat one-on-one. [The Lich King.](https://imgur.com/3eDZIqy)
---
Yeah.
---
Lei Shen can beat the Lich King, [according to Dave Kosak.](https://mobile.twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/759552173579591680) And for what it's worth, Dave Kosak is a pretty good authority when it comes to Warcraft lore. [Word of God](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod) and all that.
---
So, how did Lei Shen and his Mogu+Zandalari troll armies fall in Uldum?
---
Well, one thing I pointed out when [I first speculated that Uldum would be the location of the Year of the Dragon's second expansion](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aw2d4h/the_next_expansion_could_be_sewers_of_dalaran_aka/ehjj3je/) five months ago (let's just kindly ignore that I was wrong about Algalon the Observer showing up) was that Uldum is for all intents and purposes, a Titan superweapon. One capable of wiping out nearly all life on Azeroth.
---
But hey, at least Uldum has a dial the Tol'vir could use to tune it down a notch and make sure only *the entire region of Uldum was obliterated.* The result? A lifeless desert, devoid of Lei Shen, Mogu/Zandalari armies, and even many of the Tol'vir's own.
---
So... do the Mogu have anything to do with Uldum? I would say that their short-lived relationship is, despite its longevity, very significant. Their presence in Uldum marked the end of the greatest (not necessarily nicest) Mogu Emperor to have ever lived *and* the start of the fall of the Mogu Empire.
---
Don't get me wrong - going to Pandaria and seeing the Vale of Eternal Blossoms or something would be utterly fantastic. [There's](https://imgur.com/yuNJyBm) more [than](https://imgur.com/EL2B7x2) enough [badass](https://imgur.com/TYkjYku) Pandaren [art](https://imgur.com/FPX7fNR) out [there.](https://imgur.com/pIRn0Y7) But I wouldn't say that the introduction of the Thunder King (especially during Rastakhan's Rumble, where Zandalari trolls got their fair share of representation) is a great indicator of that.
---
I don't care where they go so long as they give me my bloody Algalon the Observer, damnit.

Just log in after launch of the expansion
---
You get the new Hunter or Paladin quest, then you get a new Tavern Brawl which rewards a pack from the new expac at first and then over the next few weeks it gives packs from older expansions and you may get something extra like double gold from quests if they're feeling very generous.
---
That what I theorycraft made a Mech Quest Paladin 
---

---
Then why can't you heal him with minion healing only effects?
---
I used to buy the preorder every time but haven‚Äôt for the last 3 or 4 because I felt there wasn‚Äôt enough value in it. Now because I had a good amount of cards from previous sets I just save gold starting from like 2 weeks after the expansion until the next and that will get you enough gold for 50-60 packs which is more than enough for me now to make the decks I like.
---
so the only way to get the cardback is with real money? not coins?
---
It's just a small indie company, stop nitpicking, they're too busy nerfing Quest Rogue.
---
One of the best
---
The thing is Dr Boom is an infinite value card in a meta where no other deck has access to that. And nothing has changed because none of the quests are on that level (a good thing). So until Boom is changed there is no room for any other control deck.
---
Why even include the quest in this
---
There is absolutely no difference at all. Pros will always theorycraft decks in advance and play it from day one and post it on their social media and people will immediately copy any deck that shows signs of success.
---
It will be merely hours before you will see the same decks over and over and over again because streaming and social media spreads the stuff no matter them streaming the decks in advance or not.
---
Nothing will change for the average joe. Plus, as multiple ppl pointed out, nobody forces you to watch it.
---
Did you guys know that over 74.6% of statistics are made up?
---
ok when hearthstone releases your favorite animal as a card back NOW THATS AMAZING
---
Litterally one of the main complain about Hearthstone is running constantly against the same few meta decks again and again. Now we should also complain when people get creative when building decks ?
---
You think the people who don't look before they post are somehow gonna see this?
---

---
8 mana 8/8 draw 8 makes more sense, octopi are all about the number 8 anyways.
---
No problem, to each their own!
---
Most people just play slightly modified versions of the same decks anyways. A new "OP" deck won't emerge right away.
---
4 if you count today's patch "consistency patch"
---
Oohhh... *Oooh.*
---
See, I remembered Siamat, but I forgot Zephrys was an Elemental. That is indeed very important for a No Duplicate deck to have greater consistency in drawing one of its strongest cards.
---
Cloud Prince could be a thing, but I'm not sure you want to play a Gnomish Inventor in a deck that seems like it would go as ham as Secret Mage would. But it's worth keeping in mind.
---
But what does Pot of Greed do?
---
if you‚Äôre still playing bomb warrior when this expansion drops you‚Äôre a fkin nerd
---
Yes it‚Äôs for all your minions.
---
look up hearthstone gamepedia. You can look up every card in the game and at the bottom of the page for any given card it gives you every patch note for that card
---
Was she at 4 Mana? Probably gave her a good minion to play the next turn. Or if she was at 5 mana left, that turn.
---
Thanks!
---
Do you still have your quest?
---
80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first.

---
The pool of random cards and discover effects is still the old rotation too
---
let the pAiN speak to me
---
you play naga ahead of time to set pyroblasts to 5 each forever. Then you play malygos and sorceror's apprentice for 1 making pyroblasts 4 mana apiece. that's 10 mana 30 damage
---
1st card: new highlander pally sir finely that lets you choose an upgraded hero power
---
2nd card is zyphrs which uses ai to pick a good card for you based on board state, life totals and number of cards in your hand. used to pick priest minion that makes all your heals do damage.
---
3rd card is prismatic lens, which draws a spell and minion from deck and swaps their cost.  used to get a nozari down to 1 mana.  The nozari(dragon) has a battlecry: heal both heros to full, in combo with priest minion, it would kill you both, but....
---
you play the pally card "time out" which makes you immune until the start of your next turn.  so you then play nozari and otk your opponent.   its really a two turn kill, but if you just assum you droped sir finely way earlier in the game it is effectively an otk.
---
Who that
---
&gt;leggos
---
Sorry what?
---
It's not an unpopular opinion.
---
Blizzard are spoiling the Hype of the entire HS community with retarded decisions.
---
For me and my friends, expansion night is an event, we gather at someone place order Pizza open our packs (get salty when we don't get enough legenderies and envious at the one guy that get 8 legendaries in 70 packs).
---
Try to invent some cool decks and watch streamers struggle with us on the same time.
---
The highlight of the evening for me is usually when I don't have the strength to play anymore and I just sit and watch Dog   figure out on the fly one of the best decks, try different stuff and eventually get rank 1.
---
Most of this is spoiled now.
---
It's spelled 'rogue' you dumb dumb.
