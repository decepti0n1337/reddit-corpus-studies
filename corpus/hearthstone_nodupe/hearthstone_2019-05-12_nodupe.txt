Just draw them all, duh

The reason the packs are so important is because if there were no rewards than the adventure would be worth nothing since we got a great adventure for free in KotFT and it even came with some small rewards. And the adventures before that gave actual specific cards which was great for players who can’t afford to spend a ton since you can get all the new cards for 25 bucks instead of having to buy a shit ton of packs
---
The nerf in Elysiana is only reasonable to people get a better gameplay in warrior mirror matches. I agree with it. Coin is not a problem and never was - the opposite is true: going first is almost of the time better for tempo and aggro decks; for control the coin doesn’t matter too much. Evil miscreant is too strong and in fact needs a nerf, but i think being 4 mana is too much - but also playable. And maybe a nerf to 1/3 on stats is too conservative. The fact is: rogue is unbalanced in standard, mostly because of raiding party and evil miscreant. Warrior cards don’t need a nerf - omega devastator being probably an exception -, since warrior is good on beating rogues and outside of this matchup the class is balanced.

Pick is a 4 mana pyroblast with a shadowstep attached to it.  It needs to lose 1 or 2 attack.

Am I the only one who thinks EVIL Miscreant doesn't need a nerf?
---
This is the point of view I'm astounded by personally. I think comparing it to older adventures and solo content is the problem. Don't think of this as being another copy paste of the Dungeon Run formula like Witchwood and Rumble were. Don't look at this as like the old adventures either (besides KFT) that WERE the expansion of their time, because you got that set's entire card pool from the adventure itself. Look at this new adventure as a standalone, new play mode, specifically played solo. KFT is honestly the biggest outliar here and seemed to be the start of them trying new stuff with their move to things like the KnC content we've been getting. 
---

---
This is the first big thing HS has had for a while in terms of new play modes, because this last year of solo content has been amazing, but always felt lackluster and had a small amount of replayability, as much as people argue it's infinite, it's really not. I've played well near 500+ runs of Dungeon Run and have gotten similar matchups even when forcing strange or awful deck archetypes several times. 
---
I'd look at this coming up solo content as a new mode people have been wanting for a while. Sure, we've gotten solo content in the past, but this one is meant to blow those out of the water.
---
I hope they gut dr. boom.  The card is so miserable to play against.
---
Agreed, stop playing a control deck with no win condition.
---
And that's the Kilian Experience ™
---
The problem with dirty rat in arena is your expectation that the opponent has optimal cards in there deck and by pulling one you ruin there strategy is unrealistic because just like you they had to pick random, so typically "control" style match ups are hard to find, and that is where dirty rat shines, but in tempo matchups or heavy aggression ones, you are only giving them fuel. Your best play with dirty rat is to use it when there hand is empty or they are in top deck mode and didnt slam the card off the top.

I personally don't know, but i think Zayle will basically be an expansion-specific whizbang deck. I am assuming that they will have a new one from this point on. Meaning when the next expansion comes out, you can still play rise of shadow decks, but I don't know why you would want to.

Warrior is falling of tho. There are lots of control decks that are better and not run ely. You could say summon mage and big shaman are controllish decks that counter warrior and also don't run elysiana.  Other than that it's only rogue and hunter for on the ladder.

is it that period of the month?
---
Conjurers call on giant is cheating out like 16 mana. (12 mana giant played at 4 mana = 8 mana discount x 2)
---
At the very least, the grave horror needs to be moved out of the slot since the 7/8 Taunt High rolls are usually GG.
---
I feel like the issue is that EVIL Miscreant generates value that can itself generate value. Lackeys are cool in relatively small doses, but it feels kind of absurd when Miscreant pops up like 2-3 times and your opponent buries you beneath a horde of Lackeys and their generated spells/minions.
---
A lot of games, my hand has been looking like this or containing Emeriss/Alexestraza/Nozari. They're good cards to have but they never help me.

---
What you said doesn't make sense to me, so I'll reiterate:
---
You should only buy the adventure if you're interested in the single-player/Zayle.  If you want to spend an extra $20 per expansion to get more stuff, then you should buy the adventure with money.  If not, you should buy it with gold.
---
Compared to other specials on packs like preorders, the adventure is *roughly* the same value for the money.  So it's a question of how much you want to spend, not so much what is "the best deal".
---
People only talk about the pack value because the game mode is going to be bad, that's it. Adventure were silly fun but people played those because the cards you will get wer meta defining. The content itself didn't worth 20 or 2800, not even close.
---
Given that, people expects the same kind of silly fun content that is nice for like half and hour. I would much prefer the approach that they had wow KcK, WW, Boomsday... At least they were free, now we are getting basically the same for money, it's a hard pass unless i see it's quality content.
---
Where are you accounting for how the loss of 28 “free” packs effects you going forward? If you usually get the 50 preorder and have at least 2800 gold to spend on packs that means you are usually opening 75+ packs. In the next expansion after you buy the “adventure” with gold, and all future expansions after that, you will only open 50+ on launch and 65+ total.

.... Look at the pool of dragons available.
---
No seriously look at them.
---
70 percent of the dragons cost 5 or more mana.
---
A little over half of them at 9 or 10 mana.
---
Obviously you would be getting mana heavy cards from dragons roar. Idk what you expected from it.
---
&gt;The solo content is worse if you're above the 3-win average, better if you're below.

---
The best part of prelate paladin is when the warrior realizes that he can’t deal with an Undatakah with lifesteal that does 3 damage to all minions N times when it dies and summons X copies of itself as well, then goes back to your deck, attempts to just race your face, and then you sound the bells it
---
Innervate: Gain 2 Mana Crystals this turn only.
---
I don't think you know what infinite value means.
---
It's not a midrange deck, it's a late game control deck. It just seems like a mid-range deck because there's a ton of super late game decks out there. Hearthstone has never had a good generic card that allows you to skip fatigue indefinitely. (30+11+10 is 41. You have to suffer through 4 or 5 rounds of Fatigue. With armor gain, that's not too terrible, so its basically indefinite as far as the max turn counter).
---
The reason why they swing at your face is that they either don't think they can make it to the late game against you (rare), or they know they can't outvalue you in the super late game, so they try to burn you out before Archive matters. Or they try to force Archive out sooner, to disarm all the bombs - then they switch to attrition. 
---
Bomb warrior is interesting, because it trades attrition for a ton more reach. I've even seen some Bomb warriors side in Leroy, and Mind Control tech with Panda instead of Banker. If they don't think double archive is going to matter, they'll leeroy and MC tech as a combo. Or they'll MC Tech Panda MC Tech, or Leroy and Panda leroy back to use as further damage or control (it's a fireball that costs 1 more afterall).
---
Hell, there's some decks that don't bother running banker at all, and just are satisifed with one Archive. They run a more aggressive suite of cards, and go for the kill during the first 10 archive cards, and just deal with the fact that they'll lose in the ultra late game if they get there.
---
What's goose
---
A way of looking at the problem is imagining today's Conj Mage without Giants. How strong that deck would be then? In my opinion, nobody would play it, or they would at least cut Conj altogether for something else, since the one broken thing it does now is multiply Giants.
---
What are things that I should absolutely know about Paladin or how to play him? I win most of my games but I went up against my friend who's really good at the game and I lost horribly, and I fear that I'm not good but my opponents are just plain bad.
---
Is this going to be the next Stonehill Defender meme for next 2 years?
---
&gt;running 4 mana 3/3s in your tempo deck
---
You understand how that card works right?  You don't play it when it costs four mana, you play it when it's severely discounted because a 1-2 mana 3/3 with Taunt is *great tempo*.

---
What about playing cho into myras to give your opponent a copy and then using the saboteur to make them cast it and kill them with fatigue, omg the meme potential

I had a run where opponents Heckle Bot'd my Kelthuzad out of my deck twice.  Anti-combo cards are probably best left in Constructed.

P.s. I'm an experienced HS player (highest rank : 11) and been playing since KOFT
---
P.S. I pulled kalecgos and crafted Harrison Jones and zilliax before khadgar. Why? I do not know.
---
If the sales don't meet their expectations, I'm expecting they will include something like 5-10 exclusive cards in the next PvE content, essentially forcing players to fork out gold or money. Most likely it will be applauded since the new cards will cause some sort of shift in the meta.
---
Done with Wolo
---
Alexstraza"s champion now gains +2attack. So a  2mana cheaper korkron eilie aslong you have a dragon.
---
Even if he plays that, depending on the fatigue, you'll still win with your much better hero power.

yeah i know the feeling, thans i do a reboot and mis out on a turn or 2.

*debtoverload: (10 years)
---
Coin shouldn’t be a card imo. It should be like a tumbler on a game board that will give you one mana crystal for one turn. It shouldn’t affect hand size or activate combo.
---
The Whisperer’s hero power is “all spells have echo”.
---
I've tried his recurring villain deck, this was not too bad as well. Though Zetalot is really struggling in this meta as priest got such a weak set.  He's not sure he can make legend this season which is a bit of a bummer.
---
He's changing up a lot lately to try and find the right balance, but if he techs for warrior, rogue beats him, if he techs for rogue, warrior and hunter beat him etc. Quite a difficult time for priest. I'm struggling to break back into the rank 5 zone, 7 and 5 stars is the best I've got this season, really sad.
---
That's unfortunate...
---
Hagatha is unusually balanced for a hero card in the fact that she can run out of resources.
---
Scammer btw.
---
It's against the Monster Hunt boss, the Mistwraith. That boss has a hero power passive, "All spells have Echo". Ysera generates a random dream card at the end of each of your turns. One of them is a spell, Nightmare, which costs 0 mana and gives +5/+5 to a minion and kills it at the end of the turn.
---
If you get Nightmare from Ysera you can play it infinite times on any minion on your board, since single player bosses do not have a turn timer.
---
Just make her 10 mana. Problem solved.
---
It seems I have been foolish in my haste to claim shop. I did not notice that little 2 hiding away. 
---
I am now very curious as how one can attain 1002 attack.
---
Random walks. A 45% win rate can still have a chunk where you do much better than your average.
---
You should consider getting a real job.
---
Yes.
---
Damn, beat the other two to the karma, lol.
---
Congratz!!
---
I watched you destroy Minnesota, gg.
---
Yep this has happened to me twice. It's like rexxar pulling tech cards out of nowhere again.
---
Nah it hasn't lmao. I lose quick to them or beat em quick. 
---
But when queue into them when I try basically to home brew any type of control deck with other classes it takes fucking ages to play...CW is not fun to play against. There is no minion/board combat. It's just play removals and heals. Outlast the opponent with Ely. The end.
---
I don't think thats boring. The minigame  of coutnerqeuing commences.
---
Yeah I honestly don't get how someone can call Elysiana bad design. An 8 Mana 7/7 that doesn't provide immediate tempo beyond her body, card advantage, or disruption is like... *how* could that even be bad design outside of winning the game on the spot?
---
The fact that Warrior has so much removal and value generation (Omega Assembly and Dr. Boom primarily) is what lets it go into Fatigue to begin with, and that's where Elysiana shines for them. Elysiana is not a problem, but a symptom. 
---
And she's only a "bad symptom" when you get into those mirror matches and don't play a win condition that intends to win sooner. She was a bit unfun for me at the start of the expansion because I was spamming Bomb Warrior, now I'm playing Secret Mechadin (or now, Kibler's Handbuff Mechadin *which is dope*) and she isn't even a factor.
---
PERFECTION
---
Definitely a bug, it should have evolved into a Snowfury Giant, the only 11 cost minion.
---
Your titel is wrong. It should be "My dungeon run opinion" LUL.
---
The reason you can "force everyone to play the same card" is because you're so good at surviving till that point. Which Elysiana does not contribute to, and which is why Warrior is so strong. If Warrior had that weakness, it would be more susceptible to most faster decks, which would encourage it to be less greedy, and thus not run Elysiana.
---
Elysiana is not the problem here. Nor is she bad design.
---
I think the maximum possible damage is 2,147,483,647.  Any more and you run into overflow because the game doesn't store more than that many multiples of 2.
---
Not fun when you have to keep that 1 damage going.. swiping to his face for 40+ times
---
I expected "targets chosen randomly" to fuck it up and wipe the board anyway
---
Well, damn. That sounds pretty rough. .-.
---
Thanks for the insight, that was fairly educational.
---
But the face *is* the place...

plus side : control warrior rolls over and dies to any deck that says mech in the name which means mechs are finally viable!

There's one aspect about the single-player modes this post doesn't really address. Hearthstone single-player's biggest competition isn't other card games or other games in general; it's Hearthstone's multiplayer. Hearthstone's core mechanics were built from the ground up to be most engaging when you enjoy them with another person. And whenever you boot up the game, that version of the game is both free to play and just a few clicks away from the Solo Adventures menu. The rewards for purchasing the single player *have* to be good bang for your buck for the multiplayer aspect too, or players who prefer the competitive side of HS will never, ever buy it. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?
---
I don't understand the question. Are you asking if meta Mage decks run Polymorph? 
---
No, Polymorph isn't really in the meta game right now. The two common variants of Mage are [Conjurer's Mage](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wp-content/uploads/Alex-Conjurer-Mage-1.png) and [Miracle Mage](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/wp-content/uploads/4-Giant-Miracle-Mage.png).

So easy to let boss to die of fatige before you do when boss got more cards in his deck and can play minions and spell when you can't.

&gt; When dungeon run was released, streamers did a tournament to see who  could defeat all 9 classes without losing once in a fresh account to get  a price (and I think trump won it, you can go and check his videos from  that time). Many people got their times and they beated all the classes  in one go. Its not a grind, its skill + rng, akin to poker.

I am not a proffesional like Trump or any other streamers. I am just a regular HS player who wants to play, not set records.

&gt; Ever heard about people playing the game for... fun? You dont lose  anything by not playing, since the cardback is a cosmetic. People play  it mostly for the fun of it, for its replayability, to try something  new, to test their abilities, or to go with the wakiest wincondition  they can come up comboing the cards offered, and seeing how far they can  do with such deck. The gamemode is not a grind, its a gamemode. 
---
That's exactly what I mean. I want to have fun, not grind. You say it's not grind, but what is it then? Grinding  refers to the playing time spent doing repetitive tasks within a game to unlock a particular game item. Dungeon Run forces you to start the run from the first boss every time you lose, making the entire mode a grind.
---
Hero cards were a mistake. That's the real issue
---
Priest Nomi sometimes needs to risk a bit in terms of card draw, and considering that that priest only overdrawed 2 cards out of such a big deck, maybe that risky play works out 6/7 or 7/8 of the times, so that play instead of a missplay is a result of a risky risk management.
---
Lol, awesome! Now I can go climb the ladder with my homebrewed mech shaman!

I remember getting those emails a year or so ago. Sadly that feature is broken now

Zoo my boys. High roll and draw all the cards you need and win by turn 6. Ez mode. On a serious note I’ve been having a lot of success with bomb hunter. Warrior seems like a free win unless they extremely high roll. Aggro is key for this meta warrior usually struggles to board clear in the early game.

Hmm....never seen that before.
---
Somehow people doesn't concide even when their win condition vanishes. Just for appearing a few extra minutes in Thijs stream... (I don't think that the priest didn't concide to train that matchup)
---
Lmao this is exactly how I killed Talanji as a final boss with Thief Rogue, I just ran over him more since I happened to steal his Sneeds and Nzoth.

Maybe this is too broken but im sure someone in custom hearthstone can balance it better.

Arena is percentage plays, on average rafaam will give you rubbish legendaries, OR unplayable cards when behind or ahead. Its not even close here, Rafaam is by far the worst choice of the three, the other two have merits depending on how you want to draft the deck

---
Being forced to choose between playing greedy cards to beat control and defensive cards to beat aggro on the ladder has been true since Hearthstones inception. Nothing new in that regard.
---
Im sick of going to the wild reddit ladder and seeing always the same big priest complain posts. Yes, I know they have counters like reporting them or hiding them, but still, I just want to reach frontpage with my own homebrew posts and all this net-posters are just driving me crazy. The amount of times those posts can revive is insane, something needs to be done.

You misunderstand, I'm pwning a dungeon bosses hp, not a control warrior :(

I played Kazakus with a deck which I constructed with no dupes. Unfortunately I already played [[Portal Keeper]] that game, so my opponent was immensely puzzled as to what other shitty options I had that were so bad an inactive Kazakus was the best play...
---
or Light Bomb, or PS, ect. The Priest must be " oh. that's cute."
---
Good luck my dude! The beginning might be tough, but once you open a few packs youll be good to go! In case you dont know: blizzard changed the way the first few packs drop legendaries. So you are guaranteed to get a legendary in the first 10 packs of any expansion you didnt already pull a legendary from.

Have you actually played in hex lord in those 17 games? In my experience he just sits in your hand all game
---
If that was me I would get lackey 10/10 times.
---
fortunately no since the prevailing mage deck are the ones running giants with an even faster version running some cards that you find in a tempo mage like sorc apprentice + a bunch of cheap spells and refill with that 2/2 elemental. they could care less with 1 poly when they can generate so much value by turn 4 and basically steamroll other decks
---
Adventures were popular because the LCG monetization model is actually consumer friendly. Almost nobody did the adventures again after they got the cards, and for good reason. They were either super easy, or total bullshit with no real in between. That's been the case with pretty much all HS single player content. They can't make it difficult without making it incredibly unfair and tedious.

Yeah if you include all the time building and testing and tweaking the decks. Which means the actual play time might be something like 18 hours, which includes queue times and stuff.
---
Ah right I was getting them confused!
---
The higher ranks are more control based, specifically to counter fast aggro decks that climb in no time. You gotta be smart if you’re playing aggro against control. Bait out there clears with a couple threatening minions. Don’t do savage roar unless you can either kill the opponent, or get them really low that they’re forced to trade, add a charger like Leeroy to finish em off.
---
I want to, but WHAT is he doing with his voice?? I feel bad for him if that's his actual voice. He sounds like he's pretending to have emphysema. I'm sure the content is great, but the pacing and tone of his voice are just not doing it for me :(
---
I'm sorry OG if you're reading this and it's not just an affect you're putting on...I guess just recognize you could definitely be talking a little faster.
---
Polarization is at a low right now. You can easily beat warrior with rogue and you can beat nomi priest with warrior. That goes against polarization rules (aggro bearing control and combo beating fatigue). 
---
Infinite value is not even a real problem here. The problem is that there is NO viable quest rogue type/combo deck to punish extreme greed.
---
All that said this is one of the best metas in hearthstone ever imo. It’s no deck is over 53% winrate in the last vS report. Polarization is so much lower than before rotation.
---
Elysiana isn’t really a problem. Play azalina or a proactive win condition and they just die.
---
You mean 6x Kalecgos.
---
Ah you are talking statistics where as I am talking about how the game 'feels' because of what the card actually does when you play it - gameplay I guess. So secret hunter or whatever has a 30 70 winrate against it, that is not what I am getting at....say the warrior has been lucky on removal draw and hunter is getting towards fatigue and this card comes down, it just doesn't feel right at all. Reminds of Jade Idol - Bad design. The positive win rate is meaningless at that point. The bad feeling is amde worse once she's been bounced. I don't play hutner, i pulled example out my ass to make the point about the mechanic.
---
yea I should feel bad for the strategy that requires one person playing solitaire in the 2 player game

---
Jade Idol was problematic because Jade was problematic because it was polarising.
---
Just like The Caverns Below.
---
Elysiana is polarising but she is intended to be a tech card. She is not your win condition against non-Control or non-Fatigue.
---
I don't see why you would "feel bad" as a Midrange player getting Elysiana'd. It sounds like you already lost at that point. If they can afford to play an 8 Mana 7/7 on Turn 30, you don't have the steam to win.
---
how does the locomotive work? can u draw a sketch of how you saw it?
---
I'm probably just out of the loop, but what is the Medivh one in reference to?
---
Sure. I understand. I pretty much aim to hit rank 8/9 each month in both standard and wild
---
Yeah but Garrosh is shit.
---
25 to 5 is trivial for any competitive player.  5 to Legend (and even moreso low Legend to high Legend) is the actual skill-testing grind.  That doesn’t diminish how hard 25 to 5 can feel for other players, but watching a well known streamer demolish new players at low ranks wouldn’t be interesting or informative.
---
I was tempted to include Dragon Priest over Reno Mage in MSoG, but well, Kazakus is Kazakus
---
Rabble Bouncer doesn’t bug me. It’s a good anti aggro tech card. Khadgsr on 2 is also ok since it’s part of a combo piece.
---
Conjurer’s Calling should NOT be three mana. That is just idiotic design.

Not at all, the most played lists in hsreplay have, brewmaster, because it is só much better than banker in most situations, to bounce back devastator, zilliax, dynomatic. Its actually not even clos3. Not to mention The chance tô get your elysiana put on board, by opponents hecklebot.

---
ok, I still don't get why people run panda over banker...
---
I think my toilet is way more polished
---
&gt; It's funny that you say that people will always complain about the cost of HS, and then you complain about the grind. 
---
What's funny about that? Complaining about the cost of HS is *objectively* wrong because HS costs $0. You can pay $0 and make it to legend, you can pay $0 and have the best deck in the game. 
---
Are you arguing that complaining about the grind is *objectively* wrong in the same way? 
---
I think you missed one of my important point; Even if you "grind 40 hours to legend", what does that get you? You can make a tweet about you hitting legend? The fun is PLAYING in legend, but if it takes you 40 hours to hit legend and you play 40 hours a month, you play... 0 hour in legend. Even if you play 60 hours a month (2 hours a day, not many people can afford that, other than highschool kids I guess), you spend 2/3 of your month grinding, and 1/3 of your month playing in legend.
---
That the grind takes such time ONCE, I have no problem with it; as I said, I made it once. 
---
But that it takes that time every single time, is what turns a lot of people off going for legend, and that's sad, because playing in legend is fun. But the grind is not. 
---
So there's a lot of people who have "legend potential" but don't make it because of the grind. Grind that they have to do every month, for a week or two of legend play. If it was every 3 months or so fine, you spend 2-3 weeks grinding then you play 2.5 months as legend. But when you have to spend half the month, 3/4 of the month grinding, every month, it's not fun, and the reward isn't "permanent legend" it's just "legend for a week or two".
---
Making legend hard to get the first time is fine, it's an achievement. But after that, it shouldn't reset that low and force the grind upon you every month.
---
Oh, and the fact that it doesn't reset to 16 anymore doesn't really mean anything... If you're legend potential, rank 16 to 5 is trivial, you'll have a winrate around 65-70%+, and with the bonus, climb like crazy. 
---
The only real grind is rank 5 to legend. 
---
Hell, I'd be happy with just "If you achieved legend once, you get bonus stars in rank 1-5 like any other rank". Anything to lessen the grind, and increase the time spend in legend play.
---
*7 missed lethals and counting* 
---
"to err is human"
---
*wins anyway*
---
Considering that the competitive format for this year is Specialist (unless they abandon it), you only need focus on one class and different versions of one deck. Which means you shouldn’t need to spend much at all.
---
As for which deck? Hard to say, as the meta is still settling and nerfs are expected at some point. Currently,  Control Warrior, Lackey Rogue, Giant Cyclone Mage, and some version of Hunter seem like the best options for Specialist, but people are still trying to make Shaman and Paladin work as well.
---
Go check out the results of recent opens. Decklists are public, so you should be able to figure out what’s been successful, and either try to emulate them or counter them.
---
I play one to five games per day, depending on what the daily quest is.
---
Also: _I'm pretty bad at the game; always have been._
---
Sick dude!
---
Right what I needed!!  
---
Keep it up!
---
Thanks! Any opinion as to packs, bundles or amount of packs to start with?
---
A well written guide, thank you OP and grats!
---
"herp herp LOL look how stoopid Hearthstone is it carnt find a replacement for this completely unique card which has no replacement lol lol"
---
I got you!
---
It probably isn’t able to read the data stored on your sd. If reinstalling won’t fix it, try to move different things on your sd card so you can install the Hs data on to the main memory. I think Hs app only takes about 2 to 3gb space nowadays so moving some pictures would be doing the job already.
---
I just came back as well. Made a Bomb Hunter and Control Warrior. 
---
Got some success with those!
---
I was having a "debate" with someone telling me leeroy just got popular in the last year or so, but I wasn't going to open up all the meta lists from the past to prove him wrong, ty for this.

---
I also won with him as last card vs warrior.
---
You've obviously never played mario kart on it then
---
I think this happens if you afk right after a match ends? like you know you get the "Victory/defeat" screen and after that you get back to main menu, but you have to click, so i think if you don't click there you're stuck in this limbo where you're not in a match, but your screen is busy and not in the main menu, so they just made the text said they're hanging there as there is where they're supposed to go next, also not necessarily afk in there, any time the game is loading that screen you're technically in the main menu but if the screen hast fully loaded at the same time you're not? I guess they should add a "Heading to the main menu" text
---
He won regardless. No need to increase the chances of op drawing his own bloods and drawing the game

Leery was nerfed to 5 mana because it was fuking bonkers before with shadowstep combos. It was always very very good and included in almost any aggresive list, and in some combo lists (the warlock otk with leeroy + power overwhelming + faceless manipulator, for example).

Leeroy has always been a card seen in almost any meta that had an aggro deck.

I tried playing a few years back and it wasn't fun. The community's obsession with doing everything in the most "efficient" manner, the people trying to trick you at every corner, calling you offensive things over anything and the fact that the game is essentially PVP that's based around a random number generator + grinding for an ungodly amount of time...

Encouraging playing hearthstone at work!? I just get yelled at when I play Hearthstone on my phone at work :(.
---
Honestly I’m so over it 😂
---
Maybe it’s not the top tier deck or whatever but at ranks 15-12 (where I live) bomb warriors with 10 omega devastators and an archivist are driving me insane. I come and go with hearthstone, been playing a ton for the past month and a half, but I’m ready to hang em’ up.

Just got hit with 4 omega devastators in 3 turns, no joke.

I see what you did there

Congrats! If I can ask, what did you win? I think I read that it was a scholarship but I wanted to ask if you were not already on scholarship. Also, what is the eSports program like at GT?

How long are you staying on the toilet? Or are you talking about toilet time at work?
---
If it’s not for you it doesn’t mean it’s bad. I’ve played a lot of osrs, made lots of friends that I’ve contacted even out of the game. But the best part is ironman mode, where you can’t trade and use GE, it feels amazing when you have to grind everything for yourself and in that case there are no possible ways to get scammed, only phished if you enter your password somewhere. The mode is amazing. And about efficiency, it’s your choice to do what you want to do, I’ve done a lot of things that are not efficient, but i enjoyed them.

Except you got 4 copies of this one and it also has the utility of working as a combo tool for your own deck.
---
Imagine if you had 4 copies of Polymorph that you could also use on your own minions to get massive board advantage. 
---
It's just too efficient as a 3 mana Twinspell.
---
Still no autosquelch. *Sigh*
---
They aren't pretty weak, they playable. 4 mana 4/5 is a ok stay line if you have no other choice and 1 mana discover a mech is quite good and in arena you use to have 4 mana 2/6 taunt which is also decent for the game mode.
---
That's as creative as Blizzard gets these days /s
---
That's a pretty complicated subject. Perhaps I should examine it at length at some point.
---
Some quick pointers:
---
* Think about your mana curve, you generally do not want a lot of empty turns (control/combo may work differently)
---
* What is your win condition? You need a way to win the game. Support your win condition.
---
* When you're building for a stable meta, how do you respond to the threats of common meta decks? Do you have answers or can you force them to answer you?
---
* How do your cards support each other? Yet, in general, do not run bad cards just because they may work well with another card.
---
* You usually want to be effective and dull over ineffective and cute.
---
The only time I have beef with the card is when it gets copied. IMO it should cost ten so it can't be easily brewmastered.

This screenshot is completely pointless, the game isn't even over by any means, Mass Hysteria or Psychic Scream and you're topdecking for plays.
---
Can I still get two of the same card from Power of Creation?
---
Pay to meme

reroll!

Typical rank 15 wild player, lmfao kill yourself

Might be playing Token Druid. Warpath not only jacks up Warrior’s arsenal against wide boards, it negates most efforts to make them stick against standard removal tools.

He does stream most (EU) evenings!

I am at the link https://i.redd.it/v73rw3dfbtx21.jpg on my phone and the chart is unreadable. What do i have to ammend the URL with to see a large version?
---
it’s bottom 3 classes for win percentage, it’s safe to say it’s one of the worst based on that
---
There was probably a lethal available, but this was better.
---
Happened to me 4 times today and i am honestly full of it.

How?

I'll show mine, you go first
---
How do they use so many devastators? I'm thinking of building the deck as I've liked warrior decks
---
Necessary, sorry for filming vertically I know only fools do this. I finally tried to film the making of one of these cards as a few people asked how I reproduce them. 🦎
---
Actually if I was a new player wanting to play standard their video is actually quite correct. You want power right now. Not long term value. You should not buy too many classic packs if you are just starting out because the newer expansions are worth more in terms of power and usability.
---
You're not wrong. The grind was part of the reason why I quit OSRS for RS3. Honestly OSRS is the perfect example of why ladders/leveling in games hook people in. (Sorry Artifact)
---
The first 2?  6 packs.  3 each wing.  The rewards are backloaded in the 5th wing to make it start to be worth it.  (Golden Zayle and Golden Classic Pack)
---
What about light the fuses?
---
Short term they are obviously better. If you want to get into the game right now you should get the newest expansions. You can just get the classic cards more slowly. Otherwise you will be very far behind in terms of meta even regarding low ranks.
---
Yeah, people always talk about playing Hearthstone on the toilet, but whenever I go to take a screenshot I accidentally flush instead. I once tried to play APM priest and ended up with a plunger on my face.
---
I think 2 copies of Book of Specters are way more important than late game bombs vs Control since it helps you get your early Giants online more consistently. Also I wouldn't cut Firetree since it's your biggest reason to run dragons.
---
The deck naturally does well against Control and struggles to interact with early boards so maybe going for the full aggro tech (MCT, Ooze, the 7 mana taunt) is the best approach. If you're low on Dragon synergy consider adding another Crowd Roaster or Scorcher.

During live streams i try to entertain my viewers and listen to them. I mainly focus on creating budget and meme decks and making them as competetive as possible. I try to be unique and do not play with the same stuff all the time, like tier 1 decks.

&gt; It was literally over next turn
---
Because he didn't draw the AoE, you were twice as lucky.
---
50
---
K, i will. Tnx for the quick reply
---
That's no moon
---
I think devastator should have its mech tag taken off but that may destroy the flavor of the card. I am fine with control warrior but bomb warrior is too good for its low skill floor.
---
Hey look it’s more Priest cards that carry an expansion’s advertised mechanic that never see any play. Put them into the trash bin with the others.
---
Yeah but as soon as you switch to the class that counters the class you see a lot, you'll start seeing only counters for the class you switched to.
---
It’s not one of the top tier decks but I love heal Druid.  If you can afford to wait on lucent until you have a Floop in hand they really can’t stop the lucent train either.
---
Bonus:  everyone mulligans against token when they see me playing Druid.
---
Token is situated the best when decks can also focus on removing minions as counterplay. In the current meta, they have way too many ways to spawn wide boards that most decks have no way to handle in time for the savage roar turn. My point: token in the past felt way better to play against than now
---
I think that's more in our head than anything. I hop on ladder as rogue and I think I see Warrior literally every damn match, but in reality, my data says they're like 24 percent of my matches. That's still a lot, but 1 in 4 isn't 90 percent. Just figure out what classes are actually played the most at what ranks, play the class that counters it, and you'll do well.
---
10 damage -&gt; 8
---
Or base stat changes pls.
---
The card is too valuable for warrior that can make it to 10 mana extremely easily
---
I added you.  I'm Dolus#1746
---
It might not be written on its card. But some say its secretly coded inside minecrafts coding files that it always wins brawls.
---
I believe it said; Bad RNG Curse
---
I only play on mobile.  I've played maybe 5 games on PC. 
---
All these screenshots of the full art boards with the easter eggs and stuff sucks for us.
---
I'll never forget the game where I was sticking out a warrior game with token druid. He used all of his removal and was down to two cards in his deck after archivist. I still had one dryad spell and a couple +1+1 in hand so I was feeling ok about my chances. That's when he dropped the second archivist he made with the first... The salt my friends. The salt

Make Paladin Control Again. I’m pretty convinced Priest and Paladin we’re going to get strong control tools during RoS, but they were pulled at last minute. Priest, in particular, was probably going to get Madam Lazul as a hero card with the passive hero power on display in this week’s Tavern Brawl. It’s triggered like Hagatha’s passive, but with spells instead of minions.
