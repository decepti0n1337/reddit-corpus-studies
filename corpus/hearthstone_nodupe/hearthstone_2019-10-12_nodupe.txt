There's going to be a lot of collateral damage to a lot of good people in EVERY situation that deals with China unfortunately. The sad thing is, this is just the start. Corporate CEOs Bening over for that china money while employing hard working and honest people to help them get it. It's kind of a lose lose.
---
Wow this is really well made
---
please stop
---
It is a common treasure like any other. Just play more often and you should see it offered in the tavern brawl.
---
Because it's a low effort, unoriginal, shitty named throwaway.
---
The person loses nothing if it is banned, so it posts low effort garbage content because the person has nothing better to do in life then regurgitate recycled memes.

It was confirmed that this was not deleted by the admins, OP deleted his account.

Y’all are wack, whining about HK when it doesn’t involve us, ppl should just learn to leave other countries to themselves and not mess with it, only gonna cause more issues.

Yeah, but one of the ways you can get a scar is by being extremely scared. Not all scars are from scares and not all scares cause a scar. I feel like Dr. Seuss could make a book about it.

Awesome!

Thank you.

Oh that’s interesting! Thought it was a glitch.

He didn't get a $10m bonus. It was 10 in stock options and perks, most of which he wouldn't receive for years because it was linked to his job performance.
---
They didn't just straight up give him $10m and then for 800 employees.
---
Thanks. I just used my prime sub on his channel.
---
"encouraged "  is a strong word my friend, they didn't intervene sure , but by any means they encouraged 
---
a employer can't also afford a PR disaster like this, because  by firing those 2 and giving that message to the chinese government they have destroyed any good will/image thet had left
---
Seriously??? I just upvoted because this is a brilliant idea!!! PLS PEOPLE PLS.
---
Exactly. 
---
Which shows just what kind of hollow shell of a company Blizzard has become since the Activision merger. It's fucking sad, really. If you had told me 15 years ago that Blizzard would be a shill company, much less for China I would've called horseshit... hell even 5-7 years ago after the merger.
---
i agree with your main idea but i've seen some 50-100k upvote threads about the issue in the OW sub, it's some good fuckign scores as far as reddit goes. This time it's a bit more that yet another outrage, it will die out for sure but i'm pretty optimistic about its influence on blizzcon because the event is pretty close to it. Lucky.
---
Someone needs a history lesson.
---
"Largest gaming market" is awfully vague here when Blizzard has been in it for 20+ years and it's only 5%-6% of their revenue. Investors are dumb as hell when it comes to China and it's going to continually bite them in the ass until it's legislated against or they get burned ultra hard over and over again. 
---
It's not exactly what they did. They outright then used their corporate account as a platform to support the CCP's policy. They sacked casters who had no part in it other than being there and not stopping it. They enforced an arbitrary, discretionary rule in a way that goes against the beliefs of the nation they're based in and the entire rest of the world.
---
Chinese consumers don't even come into it. ActiBlizzard solely wanted to appeal to the party to not get their upcoming mobile titles banned. The consmuers don't care. Blizzard went way too far and the fallout is going to continue. Even internally there's massive fallout among the employees. 
---
You'd have to explicitly call out hypocrisy to call it out. I'm not okay with enforcing the CCP's propaganda internationally. My outrage is over a company actively enforcing the CCP's oppressive stance outside of China. There's nothing in this world I can boycott to impact the CCP in any meaningful way. Boycotting Blizzard, and any other company that wants to enforce anti-human rights propaganda internationally, sends a clear to message to companies that I do interact with.
---
"You shouldn't do one good thing because you're forced to interact with countless bad" is not how the world changes. 
---
Calling it outrage culture is a joke. They crossed a massive line, and I'd be in support of our own government stepping in and sanctioning them for it. I'm glad multiple senators and some politicians from Europe have spoken directly about it. It's not okay to allow China to continue to be a bad actor on the international stage who doesn't play by the same rules as everyone else.
---
I stopped watching him because of this :(
---
I can’t take credit, this isn’t mine but I reposted here.
---
Glory to the Almighty Communist China, comrade.
---
I grant you +50 social credit points for your support.
---
Yeah man, don't get yourself banned. Use your ability to post to contribute and talk! You're much more helpful if you're joining in with us than locked out.  
---
Support the message, but it's not worth the ban, so just tell us about how you as an individual feel about this instead, so that 'low effort' content enforcement isn't a risk at all.
---
Thank you comrade. Long live the people’s republic of China. Death to the filthy imperialist supporters of Hong Kong
---
Casting GMs all day today since Kibler and Admirable quit and TJ is out on medical leave
---
Because blizzard didn't take away somebody's prize money, banned them for a year, and fired the people who interviewed him for saying a 5 second phrase during their 15 seconds of fame to raise awareness Iraq? If the Country was Iraq, I'm quite sure people would be more or less outraged. lol
---
That stock part is fucking cringe
---
What do you expect frodan to say about a player who willingly violated his contract and was punished according to the contract?
---
The guy is usually spot on with stuff like that.
---
Okay, and? That has literally nothing to do with what I posted.
---
You know they’ve run professional stock pickers against throwing darts at a dartboard and had better returns on the dartboard, right? Pretending to know the market to seem superior to those making a meme is twice as ridiculous to anyone who has a college education+ lol.

He didn't get a $10m bonus. It was $10m in stock options and perks, most of which he wouldn't receive for years because it was linked to his job performance.
---
As much as I loved watching HotS as an e-sport and still enjoy playing it, they said it really wasn't profitable. They came into the moba genre way too late. From a business standpoint it doesn't make sense to continue a product you're losing money on and doesn't shows signs of trending upward.
---
Ppl are going to start calling me an apologist now. What they did to Blitzchung was shit, but the facts here just are not right.
---
Finally !  I'm not sure how hopeful to be though.
---
You right it’s that simple, everyone is an idiot. /S
---
How about the mods locking comments now, was that just more OW sub sanity or am I just being full of shit?
---
Some people are supporting families or in bad financial situations.
---
I don't know how good the welfare system is in America.
---
You’ll have to suck my dong first (to free Hong Kong).
---
Captain America would be a great candidate for getting Marvel banned.
---
Nothing. But the fact remains that Blizzard (or any company in this situation) would want to set the record straight where their image has been in jeopardy.
---
Guess we'll just have to agree that we disagree on this whole "Friday after 5pm" thing, though.
---
I never liked Activision after they dropped the Tony Hawk games after a few failed experiments. (downhill jam &amp; the skateboard peripheral no one ever talks about)
---
And then they butchered the series with THPS5.
---
The thing that upset me about the whole situation is not that the player got banned (He knew the consequences of what he was doing)
---
But the casters got banned AND are still banned even if it's only 6 months.
---
This is a black mark Blizzard's going to have a hard time washing out
---
the chinese client of hearthstone already had alternate art for years (skeleton knight, unstable ghoul)
---
if blizzard wanted to make these new censored arts for china they would have put it only on chinese client, as they normally do
---
if blizzard wanted to "universalize" their censored art they would also change the other arts that are already different on their chinese clients
---
this change has probably more to do with wanting a lower rating in the US than chinese censorship
---
I'm betting you are a paid to post this stuff to.
---
FUCK THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

Why?
---
You don't have to do anything.
---
I'm protesting and boycotting.  Boycotting requires no real action.  Protesting requires you be able to articulate why you are loudly voicing your concerns.
---
Agreed. I can’t wait for Blizzcon to burn.
---
Man fuck this nonsense
---
&gt; Or should we start broadcasting every horrible thing that's happening all the time until it all stops?
---
Yes. Stop trying to blind yourself to the world and what is happening.
---
Too Late
---
Blizzard fining him over this is ok, he broke the rules. Something on the level of being late to an in person event. Banning him from competition, effectively kicking him out of grandmasters, is not ok.
---
I wonder if Blitzchung will use the prize money to help the cause of Hong Kong. I reckon he will.
---
Competitors in both Grandmasters and the Collegiate Championship (and any other official Hearthstone event) are subject to the rules in the [2019 Hearthstone Tournament Player Handbook](http://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/px/PXYB9IHSRQLF1564507343607.pdf):
---
&gt;2.2 Applicability of Rules.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;5 (a) The terms contained in this Handbook apply to Hearthstone Tournaments in the Asia-Pacific, Americas, and Europe regions, including the following Tournaments:  
---
&gt;i. **Hearthstone Grandmasters**  
---
&gt;ii. Hearthstone Masters Tour  
---
&gt;iii. Hearthstone Masters Qualifier  
---
&gt;iv. Hearthstone Inn-vitational  
---
&gt;v. **Hearthstone Collegiate Championship**
---
and
---
&gt;6.3 Illegal and Unethical Conduct.  
---
&gt;(a) Players are required to observe all laws applicable to their participation in all points of all Tournaments, including all games, matches, media events, autograph signings, photo sessions, sponsor events, and other gatherings or events occurring with or as part of the Tournament.  
---
&gt;(b) **A player may not, during any Tournament, commit any act or become involved in any situation or occurrence which brings him or her into public disrepute**, scandal or ridicule, or shocks or offends the community, or derogates from his or her public image or reflects unfavorably upon Blizzard, the player community, Hearthstone, or any other products, services, or sponsors of Blizzard.
---
&gt;7.14 Penalty Investigations Process  
---
&gt;(d) Blizzard takes allegations of misconduct seriously and investigates disqualifications or activity that may constitute cheating or unsporting conduct. In addition to Tournament penalties outlined in this Handbook, Blizzard may, but is not obligated to, impose additional sanctions against offending players who commit misconduct in ladder matches within the Hearthstone game client, in Tournaments, prior to or after Tournaments, or in connection with Tournament related events. Punishments may include, but are not limited to the following:  
---
&gt;i. **Suspend the player from participating in any future Hearthstone Tournaments and events by adding the player to a public list of suspended players.**  
---
&gt;ii. **Revoke all or any part of the points and prizes previously awarded to the player.**  
---
&gt;iii. Terminate all licenses granted to the player for Blizzard titles, including Hearthstone; and/or terminate all Battle.net accounts that are held by the player.
---
These events do have their own supplementary rulebook but those exist primarily to lay out the groundwork for tournament structure, prizes, etc.
---
As a software programmer I can tell you that that excuse was 100% horseshit.
---
If you want to mess around with it, it's included in the starting Shaman deck, along with a spell that turns all minions in your deck into copies of a friendly minion.
---
No, the fact of the matter is, I really don't want any discussion.
---
I don't want to waste my time talking to people who can somehow justify what's happened and will enforce total non-rules, with no explicit terms, judged at bliz' sole discretion and whim, as totally fair and reasonable terms.
---
It's absolute nonsense. I'm pretty sure I said initially I don't care about your opinion and you will not change my mind on this, because I don't think employers should be shitheads to their dedicated and passionate employees. You wanna think it's all fair, you do you, just don't fucking talk to me about it because it's annoying and I said from the get-go, I do not want your opinion.
---
You are absolutely boring me with stupid metaphors to try and justify ridiculous behaviour by execs, and if the rules are not explicit, then in my mind, they cannot be explicitly broken. Their "rules" need a thorough review, because they provide absolutely no information as to what would constitute a breach.
---
Now, do us both a favour and stop replying to me, because you won't change my mind and your essays are wasted.
---
This is... a complete non-statement. 90% of this is just Business speak with no substance or relevance to the actual situation, and the 10% that is relevant is just vapid and empty of value or real meaning.
---
I expected nothing from Blizzard, and I'm still disappointed.
---
That may also be a consequence of mass deletions. It's possible that many people attempting to delete their accounts may be automatically treated as a potential instance of mass hacking, and trigger tougher requirements.
---
Always remember their response to China:
---
" **As always, We will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost** "
---
Yep this.  China has their tentacles all up in Irvine, and no one on the exec team has recieved the rubber stamp to speak out.  
---
They used to be a company led by gamers, now they are led by second rate, out of touch shills.  Morheim out, brode out, metzen out, brevik out, Im out.  Fuck Chizzard
---
What answers are they demanding? Blizzard can just state that the participant and casters violated their rules and acted accordingly.
---
This is my concern also. This statement addresses just enough so that those wanting an excuse to not have to care about this any more have it.
---
Does it matter? They lay off staff even whilst announcing record breaking profits.
---
That is NetEase, Blizzards chinese partner, not Blizzard US.
---
I always saw HotS as a brand building thing, literally Blizzard moba. And I think all those teams that had the plug pulled on them due some exec looking at the raw numbers was a bit rough, I still feel they should try and find a way to give warning in these decisions.
---
Yeah, no man.
---
I'm protesting and boycotting and this does not speak for me
---
Maybe what you reposted? Google mickey mouse and a meme creation website and BAM! Alot more effective and you have done what you've just told others to do in just 2 minutes. Then add a description of the only 2 sentences that was any bit useful "We turn Mickey Mouse into a pro Hong Kong meme ... Disney &gt; Shanghai &gt; New Disney Park"
---
Tell RemindMeLaterBot to remind you in 12019. :)
---
Nah, way before this issue. You can ask around or make another thread asking for examples (after this dies down). But the Blizz forums have been a heavily moderated place for a while now.
---
Blizzard did admit in the post it was of their decision:
---
&gt;On Monday, we made the decision to take action against a player named blitzchung and two shoutcasters after the player shared his views on what’s happening in Hong Kong on our official broadcast channel.
---
That's because it's UTC no Z offset.
---
Apparently Blizzard thinks no one on the Internet can read Chinese and see they are so obviously licking China’s boots.
---
Isn’t LoL owned by Riot Games which is 100% owned by Tencent?
---
&gt;In the tournament itself blitzchung *played* fair. We now believe he should receive his prizing. We understand that for some this is not about the prize, and perhaps for others it is disrespectful to even discuss it. That is not our intention.
---
What is this meant to imply? Are Blizzard legit implying that Blitz might not of "played fair" to make people think he might of cheated?? Why is this comment even needed, it makes no sense.
---
I could agree with that, it’s just that people don’t seem to understand that it’s a distinct Chinese company and you can’t expect them to say anything differently.
---
They are paid to speak on behalf of blizzard. Blizzard approved them to represent blizzard. Their words are blizzard's words. They cannot hide behind another company that they paid to speak for them. I am sick of this bullshit excuse
---
I mean, I think it sucks that Blizzard is the first gaming company to deal with the public outrage of bending the knee to China. I wish it were EA. But this issue was going to come to the forefront sooner or later. Especially with Tencent dipping their fingers in every Western Gaming company they can.
---
Hijacking the Top comment here to clarify some things if you don't mind! First of all did not expect this to blow up in the way that it did, been really fun reading all the comments both positive and negative! And second of all, yes it is a turd! Saw some people confused if it was anything else but nope, just turd.
---
Last and most important! This art was not done by me, but by my very good friend who wanted to remain anonymous and asked me to post it for him, he's been checking the thread every so often to see what people are saying so feel free to keep commenting if you want the artist to see it! He's also blown away by the reception this has gotten and greatly appreciates it! #FreeHongKong
---
If that was really true, then they'd fucking fire the guy who wrote, "we will always defend the dignity of china" in the official post that started all this, or all this talk about wanting to keep the messaging neutral is shit.
---
I'm happy with this. People for some reason expect them to be heads and hands on the floor begging for forgiveness. They messed up and corrected themself. 
---
Not sure what everyone else wants out of them.
---
Keep strong. Don't play. Support HK and the players. I'm not going back.
---
Hey yea that is a good point, glad to hear. I should tone it down, it is just kind of tough, I always have thought of regardless of how the world is acting Blizzard and the NBA have always made me happy to participate or talk about, this week they both failed me.
---
Blizzard: "our relationships in China had no influence on our decision"
---
Blizzard-Netease: "as always, we will defend the pride and dignity of china at all cost"
---
Blizzard:
---
Well, you know what my feelings on the matter are, and you are expecting me to reply to you with them.
---
So you should be punished for them. You're responsible for enabling me, so this is your fault.
---
Why is this Hong Kong citizen punished for protesting and not the Americans who did the same thing? 
---
They did worse than not apologize and tried to placate us instead with this BS. 
---
“Apology” NOT accepted and I won’t resubmit to WoW until they really apologize and recognize their mistakes.  
---
Reinstate him NOW and apologize for not disciplining Americans in the same manner.
---
They definitely could have backpedalled a LOT harder lol
---
And why can’t your username be freeHongKong? I’m talking about in game not on twitch? I’m guessing you can use a name like ChinaOwnsHK
---
Ok gotchu I will if u do to
---
Yeah, so Blizzard is reducing its support for the Chinese Communist crackdown in Hong Kong (in the form of its punishment of a political protest) in the hopes that this will ameliorate peoples outrage that a company that allegedly supports diversity, freedom and tolerance has declared its firm support for a regime that stands against all those values. Sorry, but, no. 
---
You are silencing brave voices while tacitly supporting oppression and political violence.
---
Yea, they were basically stuck between a rock and a hard place. Either enforce the rule that Blitzchung would have known about in advance (including the punishment) and lose the goodwill of the West, or make a political statement in support of Hong Kong and probably lose billions of dollars and access to a market of over a billion people, possibly even pushing them to bankruptcy. Both of those choices were shitty with no winners, and they were pushed into this.

Lol funny how it’s still worth it for the people that dusted their entire collections
---
Banned for 6 months now as opposed to a year I believe.
---
“Wow, Blizzard first Hearthstone game ratings are way down over an already really bad last year comparison. Viewership declined 13%, the lowest in over a decade. If the players stood proudly for China, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back? Otherwise worse!” 
---
-Xi Jinping /s
---
Taiwanese players can't even have their countries flag displayed. Not influenced my ass.
---
China is a lot more concerned with suppressing the message that is sent to the Mandarin speaking audience, which is the audience Blitzchung was speaking to. That is the audience that is a much larger threat to the Chinese government, as if young people in China start to support the HK protesters in greater numbers you could see major change.
---
China is not concerned about AU students doing that, especially not when the audience are English speaking and likely almost all western. (I am not saying that China directly dictated to blizzard what to do. It is more likely that Blizzard is trying to anticipate what the Chinese government wants and is trying to meet those demands.)
---
But both Blitzchung and the AU players broke the same rule. But because one is a threat to their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and the other isn't they punished Blitzchung and the casters and not the AU players.
---
Every time you think you're appeasing the bully, all you're doing is raising the bully's expectations for next time.
---
I think you're right. Blizzard has millions invested in OWL and there are three teams set to host games in China next year. They have to hope that either fans let Blizzard slide with this or that China is completely satisfied with this "apology". They can't afford to lost the fans and China right now.

---
Why does the punishment have to be the same?
---
If I stole everything out of an electronic store and you stole a loaf of bread in different burglaries, would you think the punishments have to be exactly the fucking same? No. You wouldn’t.
---
You’d hope the judge would consider ALL context and punish accordingly. 
---
I know you think all rules should be black and white 
---
But this case has been an eye opener for many people 
---
Why oh fucking why would you want them to overreact twice? 
---
So you can be mad? Sure seems that way.
---
Human rights are incredibly controversial... what are you talking about? 
---
They claimed he violated a contract and was punished for it regardless of the message. How can that be argued? We have seen the contract and we have seen what he did. We can disagree on whether or not the punishment was too severe, but he did violate his contract and that's why he was punished.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Now, maybe you don't believe he was making a Human Rights statement when he was asked to say something on 8 words or less? 
---
Whether he was or not, Blizzard has the right to determine if they want their platform used for that. This messaging is inherently divisive globally, and they stand on the platform of using their game as a unifying platform / experience for gamers. People like you are requesting a company take a political side on an issue YOU agree with.
---
Truly the most important part of this thing. Maybe this was their plan all along 5head
---
Note that blizzard is a company with different groups of employee.
---
The Chinese social media accounts are managed by Chinese employees who obviously are nationalistic
---
Of course he won’t come back. It’s just buzzwords.
---
Considering it’s Disguised Toast of all people, he just wants attention that’s it. He’s fine with the money he is getting from paying TFT.
---
Also you know Taiwanese players can't even have their countries flag displayed. Not influenced my ass.
---
Blizzard thinks that allowing only progressive politics on its channel means it's not a political platform. Because progressivism isn't "politics" - it's scientific progress, or something.
---
Blizzard doesnt pay to NetEase, NetEase pays them licence money for opperating Blizzard games in China and they get profit from those games. NetEase are not Blizzard US emploees, they are partners.
---
[It's depressing how similar Allen's statement is to this clip..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kncw-8smn9Y)
---
Get a life loser
---
You realize china is not communist right?
---
Esports is just another version of sports. You'll see plenty of sports players who bring up major political issues.
---
And that's a slippery argument. Nobody's going to screw their careers just to tell people about those politicians.
---
The casters do not deserve any sort of ban. If there are things that are off-limits on stream, then it should be a delayed broadcast with a producer controlling what gets streamed. They've made 2 innocent people scapegoats for their own incompetence.
---
And he didn't get fired. At least the NBA is somewhat standing up for their employees and democratic values.

---
It's not even a suspicion at this point

I made [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/dg4tze/6_suspicious_accounts_in_pro_hongkong_thread/) to list a many very obvious shill accounts in a single thread
---
I also fucked up the tiltle, I mean  "pro china"
---
That's why they made it.
---
What a shit apology.
---
Blizzard is dead to me.
---
I mean, yeah you can.  Netease's comment was very strong.  'Blitzchung has been banned for violating tournament rules' gets the message across without the jingoistic bullshit.
---
Bootlicker
---
&gt;Amature
---
Ah i see youre already drinking
---
Half-assed attempt at an apology that admits to doing nothing wrong but "reacting too quickly" and denies China's involvement. Well done, I would expect nothing more from this company now.
---
Love it! Fuck their apology and /r/FuckBlizzard  
---
FIVE DEMANDS NOT ONE LESS BLIZZARD
---
1. Reverse all bands related to Hong Kong's fight for Liberty.
---
2. Publicly come out in support of Hong Kong
---
3. Mei Hong Kong Protest Skin
---
4. Reverse all actions taken against Blitzchung and casters supporting him.
---
5. Publicly apologize on both your website and weibo.
---
And for everyone that says "politics should be kept separate", the official announcement doesn't even say what actually happened, or what the breach of rule was. It said the penalty was as it was to prevent it happening again, which basically means they need it to blow up on social media for the message of what you cannot do to spread.
---
Almost seems intentionally badly handled it's just that much of a mess.
---
I mean, it seems like Tuesday morning at 2am would be the time to do it.
---
You've needed an ID to do big account changes for years at Blizzard. That's just how they handle security.
---
Fortunately for you I don’t think China cares about aladdin
---
OWL has hundreds of thousands of viewers, has been successful live at every homestand, and has been more successful in the general public than any game except for fortnite. What about it is dead?
---
Posting my comment from r/Games:  
---
  
---
This was NOT the response they needed to give. The opinion he had was not divisive, unless you're talking about being divisive between China and the rest of the the world. They are lessening the punishment while defending their actions and claiming that they support their values of Every Voice Matters, etc. even in their reports events, but then saying these broadcasts are no place to express such values. They're contradicting themselves and this won't blow over the way they're hoping it will.  
---
&gt;The actions that we took over the weekend are causing people to question if we are still committed to these values. We absolutely are and I will explain.  
---
&gt;Our esports programs are an expression of our vision and our values.  
---
&gt;However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.  
---
Contradict yourselves and try to say that the desire for freedom is a divisive political message. Quality shitpost, Blizzard.
---
A step, but a small one. I really don’t appreciate the lie that Chinese politics played no role in their decision.
---
Maybe or maybe not, I was basically not touching hearthstone at all  already and decided to move on to other games to actually have fun
---
Two wrongs don't make a right. Although I guess a case can be made for pushing a law to expose its flaws and get it repealed, but that's evidently not the aim, here.
---
Blizzard has betrayed their country, America.
---
Human right are absolutely political, but they damn well shouldn't be considered "divisive".
---
i dont forgive them at all. ive seen other posts about them catering to china super hard. they dont care. if they did, they would have not banned them at all.
---
J. Allen Brack has always been a swine. This man can never fill the shoes of Morhaime.
---
Personally, I don't know.  @Slasher has been a pretty good source throughout this debacle but he's just passing info along in this case.
---
Sweet! I might have to grab a beer and dive in.
---
And yeah – I get that lol. It wouldn’t be reddit without a little fucking around. I appreciate the update on the Blitz situation. Just, as a general note, if you *are* tired of the complaining - be careful that you don’t accidentally end up throwing yourself into the midst of it. I tend to end up harboring a good bit of negativity through things like that; it can be an easy trap to fall into.
---
Reverse all punishments for this. Not one less
---
Hello. Can you explain why that is?
---
In fairness, that's not saying the opposite, that's just sucking their dick, which may or may not being related to their relationships.
---
Blizzard: First place in organ harvesting!
---
If this had nothing to do with China, why are homophobic remarks worth $2k and 4 games, and racial remarks $4k and 4 games. Why is a collegiate team **allowed** to do it with zero in the way of repercussions? To the point they were expected to play at the next level and had to recuse themselves?! This doesn't even pass the sniff test!
---
No, too late ,and the ban is still here.
---
Ahhh got it. Sorry, it obviously went right over my head lol
---
I don't know. I don't have anything to do with that policy. I'm just saying it's been around for years and has nothing to do with the flood of account deletions.
---
If Hearthstone had bent the knee to advocacy groups against abortion, gun reform, gender equality etc, there would be equal outrage.
---
But did you read the entire thing though, or did you see other people shitpost that same quote and just decide to ride the karma-wagon too?
---
Quick give him his prize money and it'll all blow over!
---
&gt; I guess i should have added in relation to gaming.
---
How is it diffirent?
---
Things don't happen down the line without the approval from the top.  
---
Who do you think signs the checks?
---
Uhhh, everyone is fucking pissed. This is a red hot topic on pcgaming and pcmasterrace. And 4chan. Sadly 4chan is not pissed enough or Blizzard security is too good for them to be Sony'd, which if you don't remember means getting hacked so bad noone on their platform (PSN/Bnet) can even log in for a month, followed by all of Sony Pictures' upcoming announcements and several scripts getting leaked.
---
I’m even happier now tbh
---
They didn't even give a reason why the casters were banned LMAO. They also hand waved over why they took the prize money after the ban unless I'm missing something
---
Are you an asshole or do you just roleplay one on days that end in "y"? I ask because there are shills all over the place. Oh wait, you are probably one of them.
---
LMFAO oh lord we have another bandwagon prick. Just because it's brought to spotlight doesn't mean I'm gonna pretend I cared about the Hong Kong situation before it blew up, it's so fucking disrespectful. Just like the college kiddos who literally proved nothing, they're just taking a cheapshot since either blizzard bans them and it gets more publicity or they ignore the brats and still get trashed. Stop trying to be cool for a second and look at both sides fucking clown 😂
---
Should we let these companies bend over to china and slowly but surely keep losing more and more ground as china takes over then?
---
This is a pretty harsh translation. Someone on Twitter parsed it out a little more realistically. Someone can link it if they wish, I ain't breaking rules.
---
Nah, I bet if anyone got banned, and the internet blew up about it they would reduce the ban just to calm the titties.
---
This is nothing more than damage control
---
I'm surprised they didn't ban the cameraman along with the casters.
---
might as well not have said anything if this is the bullshit youre gonna spew out.
---
Lol no it doesn't
---
Hover your mouse over the date and you'll see it is because all news posts on the site are displayed in GMT.  Europe time.

I have been following this China bullshit for a while, various companies, Valve was a bitch as well, I think this is a stipulation China puts in: they are never responsible and you must publicly say so.
---
Protest for keeping human rights has nothing to do with respecting human rights. Ok.
---
Sir, this isn’t a Wendy’s.
---
&gt;	And if small comments are representative of the overall viewpoint, why would blizzard risk their public view in china by saying they would’ve punished a pro-China statement in the same way, if they’re really only sucking up to the chinese government?
---
Because everyone involved, China included, knows that's a lie.
---
That's fine and all, but there's an equal chance that you're the naive one as we have *literally* no proof that either of our "strategies" are correct. "Dumping" the story, that a gamer consumer base has been focused on, at the exact time most US gamers would be getting home (or are already home) is just as possible as your news dump theory.
---
So let's not throw accusations around baselessly, huh?
---
The blog states that he cannot compete for 6 months.
---
Oh noooooooo, you're wrong.  The content had *nothing* to do with the punishment.  If blitzchung had diverted attention away from the tournament by saying hi to his family or sending greets out to his kids Blizzard would *totally* still have banned him for 6 months.  The *only* thing he did wrong was speaking off-topic.
---
/s
---
I fucking hate corporate snakes.
---
Not a shill, just someone who isn't mad at blizz saying 'respect China!' one day and 'China had nothing to do with this' the next. Got it.
---
&gt;4) They didn't talk about any of the process that led to the ban in the first place
---
Which is literally the core issue of the outrage, no less. Who the fuck was whining about Blizzard breaking their own rules?
---
Quality shitpost from another subreddit just to get more updoots PepeLaugh.
---
So ur comparing the olympics to a hearthstone tournament
---
&gt; The specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no influence on our decision.
---
The best joke I have heard this week.
---
*needs
---
Slightly misleading, the “at all cost” seems to be an embellishment, but I wouldn’t call the translation an outright lie.
---
Tl;dr we're still a bunch of cunts.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
Except Xi doesn't represent Hong Kong, he is the oppressor. He doesn't deserve or want the Hong Kong flag.

it is a athletic event. While that may be "basic human rights", what place does it have in an athletic event?
---
Fucking wow
---
I agree with you but I want to add one caveat. Blizzard is expecting you, the gamer, to overlook their China bootlicking. How about you put the freedom of another people ahead of your entertainment and cancel your Blizzard accounting.  Do more than “thoughts and prayers”.
---
"We're sorry that you feel bad about us acting poorly, but here's why we acted poorly..."
---
Desperate damage control at it's finest. Even by doing this, their image is ruined indefinitely and BlizzCon will be a shitshow.
---
They should have banned the kids. Then they are being consistent. Yes it is a lose lose, but then they are applying it with an even hand.
---
they couldve just pretend they didnt know  but they made it clear they knew instead
---
**FREE HONG KONG**
---
This made me chuckle.
---
There’s also no direct reference to China.
---
You understand that this Netease making the statement which is Blizzard China basically, who was the one that banned the casters in Taiwan.
---
The great news is that this tactic is slowly becoming obsolete, especially in the gaming community. 
---
Places like Reddit and other Social Media platforms, as well as YouTube creators, allow news to spread over the weekend. I’m sure creators like Yongyea or TheQuartering will have videos out about this tomorrow and those videos will have more views than an IGN/Kotaku article will on Monday. Hell, they would probably have more views than an article put up tonight. 
---
In the near future weekend news dumps will only benefit the people manning the desk at the corporate office that will have 48 of not having to think about it, as opposed to providing the benefit of less coverage.

So everything reverts to horrifying political nihilism and we cannot stand for anything.
---
not buying what Blizzard is trying to sell here.
---
Lies and deception
---
A hearth stone guild was forced to change their name. Their original name was "GAY BOIS". So I'm pretty sure blizzard still censors that.
---
“Play nice, play fair”
---
None of what China is doing is any of that. 
---
Stand behind your statement.
---
I never said anything about that. I asked /u/PushEmma about all the other "tons of issues" which were never brought up in the statement.
---
If people in China are honestly offended that people from Hong Kong want freedom (and I doubt there's that many)... uh, fuck 'em. Whether it's because they want social credit, they are jealous that the people of Hong Kong are braver than they are, or if they honestly support the CCP, just fuck 'em. 
---
That goes for Jackie Chan too. Breaking my heart, Jackie, come on!

Really glad most of you saw right through the bullshit about this trash statement. Fuck blizzard, fuck China.

&gt;We absolutely are and I will explain.

Usually if you have to explain why you're a such good person/company using this sort of language and approach... you probably aren't.

32.15K dust
---
Wait, you actually believe this drivel?
---
i can think of 2 billion reasons
---
plus shareholders who demand infinite profit growth, forcing companies to find new markets
---
I'm gonna say this... I still think the punishment is heavy handed. Imagine that you said "Say the 8 words and we'll be done with this interview." I don't think any Hearthstone caster would say "Yup, that statement will definitely get you suspended without pay for half a year." Maybe it's just me but I think that the casters should have got a warning and that Blitzchung should have gotten banned from the just the next major HS tourny. I agree with Blizzard that these HS tournaments aren't not the place to scream out extremely divisive political views, but a 6 month ban is still over the top IMO for a first time offense.   
---
Since I watch the NBA... I'd be just as mad if a player got suspended without pay for half a year for wearing a hoodie to support Treyvon Martin.
---
What human right did Blizzard violate?
---
Again, for the 3rd time, Activision-Blizzard has no control over that account. Netease, a Chinese company that Blizzard is forced to work with does. They can't walk back that statement because they have no influence over it. This is why China makes them use their marketing in the first place, to prevent anti-chinese messages getting to the public.
---
1.No bans
---
2. Actual apology admitting their actions were wrong, unjustified, and unjust
---
3. Admit their decision was influenced by China
---
How much do they pay you to post this blatant lies?
---
Say what you want, but that's getting me thru my senior year right now
---
Keep pulling on that thread blizzard u are not getting past thid one guy
---
Actually this theory seems to be spot on: [https://twitter.com/sgbluebell/status/1182817588147052544?s=21&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ov7j7luxAp7WddBLzcUAHWrHW0sbwylXjxeM5f\_x9e2YV1EGTyoSsefw](https://twitter.com/sgbluebell/status/1182817588147052544?s=21&amp;fbclid=IwAR1Ov7j7luxAp7WddBLzcUAHWrHW0sbwylXjxeM5f_x9e2YV1EGTyoSsefw)
---
Something felt fucking weird when I read that statement, now it makes sense. Crafted by China for Blizzard.
---
"Linguistic analysis" = random conspiracy theory that happens to align with bandwagon mentality
---
Literally just making stuff up now to fit narratives, I love it
---
Have you ever considered that maybe Blizzard SHOULD quit doing business in China? 
---
They have demonstrated that they would rather lick the dog shit off the communist boot than stand up for freedom and liberty.
---
So we can all come together and just say collectively, fuck Blizzard. Nothing changes.
---
Then ban the player for a month. The penalty was over the top because that’s what China demands.
---
There's no way to do this without hitting someone.  There will be other jobs for those employees, and the companies they go to will know not to be this stupid making a better work environment for them.
---
Let Blizz die, let it die now
---
Most Listed Companies post things after the market close on Friday.. because they don't want the reaction to have an impact on the market... that's the common practice
---
Thanks for the clarity
---
Oh my
---
Hehehe I came into this thread to reference The West Wing. Take Out the Trash Day is a great episode, which is to say it's an episode in the first four seasons.
---
Glad someone else has already made the connection.
---
They already deemed the Blizz China verdict too harsh and gave a lesser punishment
---
That Twitter thread is wild. I was wondering why the statement read so strangely, and that theory really makes sense.
---
[They said the opposite to their Chinese audience.](https://i.imgur.com/xZylqhd.jpg)
---
Most big companies (google, apple, etc.) have systems in place to remove negative reviews posted after a controversial media incident.
---
Fucking wankers
---
As if it’s impossible to support Hong Kong but also understand where Blizzard is coming from? 
---
Blitz knew the consequences of his actions and decided to make his statement regardless. Hate to break it to you but actions have consequences. Was he wrong to have those beliefs? No. Was he wrong to use the tournament as a platform to express and share his beliefs? Absolutely. 
---
This is basic stuff.
---
Not a Mistake in the eyes of public opinion. So that is where you are not seeing it.
---
Dumb ass.
---
They've always had weirdly written news. Take this one for example: https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/starcraft2/23139226/war-chest-blizzcon-2019    
---
No one says "ramp up to", its "build up to". Also, "engage with Starcraft 2". No one engages a game. They play or enjoy it. "You earn XP toward your progression" is painfully wordy, and which SC2 player doesn't know what XP does? These are all weird because they're passed through a bunch of PR professionals wanting to maximizer the audience reach.
---
Not good enough.
---
Fuck em, Boycott Blizzard.
---
Yeah this shit reads weird.

As a native speaker I will say I could read it all, the whole statement, but some parts were a bit odd sounding. Word choice could have been better in some areas, it almost came off as someone being too prim and proper sounding, I had wondered about it. I thought it was just someone writing a very unemotional, proper, toneless response to people about the situation. I did notice some of what was pointed out and it was proper but not common, I'd expect it from someone trying to sound important perhaps.
---
Also, at the date listed for the post was October 12th. At the time this was posted, China was one of the few countries where it was already the 12th. The post actually could’ve been written in China, by a Chinese person.
---
That's because Chinese nationals are part of a racist regime, and have to project that onto white people in order to deflect scrutiny.
---
All this tells me is that the pressure is working. Keep it up! This company doesn't care about what is right they only want money.
---
This makes me angry.
---
What is transpiring in Hong Kong \*IS\* ethically and morally wrong.
---
What Blitzching said to draw attention to the event, as far as I am concerned, is not a political matter, it \*IS\* an ethical matter. He has full rights to express and inform what is happening in that part of the world.
---
The casters are innocent. Their job is to cast games and interview people. They interviewed an individual with a perfectly valid viewpoint. Any retaliation against them is completely unfair and a travesty.
---
This non-apology is a an extremely translucent and sad attempt to placate people following this story, while catering to the powers that currently control the company.
---
I would love to believe that Blizzard and it's leadership is being strong armed to deliver this tripe. I know that a lot of Blizzard is appalled both at what is happening in Hong Kong, and the original repercussions of Blitzchung's sentence.
---
Brack, as \*the\* representative of Blizzard, if you have any dignity and integrity left, stand up for your employees, for what is right. Cast off the shackles of the shareholders, of Activision, of potential Chinese markets, of any monetary influence, and do what is right.
---
Just.. Christ..
---
Maybe they should have a rule forbidding politics in their interviews/streams/tournaments.
---
They don't.  He was punished for hurting the Blizzard brand.  But since China wasn't a consideration in the decision it begs the question:
---
Who finds human rights of a free people that want to stay free... damaging I guess?
---
Blizzard made their bed, they can sleep in it.
---
Yeah let blizzard just wave their magic wand and fix Hong Kong lmao
---
Really? I don't think that's even proper grammar.
---
No one is saying it's illegal. You have a right to be a total asshole, but people will call you out on it and stop associating with you. Blizzard is essentially being an asshole here.
---
It actually is. Slavery used to be a divisive issue as well. It still sorta is.
---
You should have just shut up and said nothing Blizzard.
---
Nop, my plan is boycott til the decision is reversed and they admit they fucked up.  Instead we get a half measure and mostly just blaming blitz and the casters, with no apology to be seen.  They were actually winning back some good will with me via Classic.
---
Lol this is the state of this sub right now, people who don't even play the fucking game are pontificating about problems with the current meta.  Hey points for having a post about the game rather than China garbage.
---
Taiwan's version
---
https://news.blizzard.com/zh-tw/blizzard/23185888
---
note that this site is for players in Taiwan/Hongkong/Macau
---
China /Netease has a different website.
---
Solid catch.
---
I made a mistake. I thought one of the announcements was made by their upcoming opponents. You're right, only AU forfeited.
---
Damn, this is huge. This strongly suggests that this statement was at the very least *partially* written by Tencent. My guess is that Blizz's higher-ups sent their version of the statement for approval earlier in the week, which then got altered. The "when we think about.." part in particular strikes me as something that was possibly re-written.
---
This leaves me wondering why Blizz didn't catch all that before releasing this statement. They could have easily done some minor changes to convey the exact same meaning in a less heavy-handed english. 
---
Maybe J. Allen Barack actually sounds like this and this was written by him when his previous PR wasn't. 
---
Or maybe Blizz was told to use this exact wording and they complied. 
---
The truth often lies in the middle. I'd say they were probably pressed by time (had to say something by Friday 5pm). And the few Blizz higher-ups who had access to this Tencent-approved document didn't notice the flaws before releasing it to the public. After all, it took a CN speaker to see them. 
---
In any case, this is yet another concerning sign coming from Blizz.
---
Too little, too late.  We know exactly who they are.  I'm done with them as a company.
---
[Sure,](https://i.redd.it/7vtkmn8rh0s31.jpg) but only when it's profitable.
---
Even if they said that, they made the Weibo statement first. No matter what happend they were fucked.
---
It's not even their "apology", evidence points to major parts being written by Chinese non-native speaker. Here's a great sentence: "We now believe he should receive his **prizing**."
---
Twitter has the analysis: https://twitter.com/sgbluebell/status/1182817588147052544
---
Because those of us who wanted nothing to do with it are now forced to make a political choice based off of Blizzard's response.
---
Especially considering that thos would have been written by the PR department
---
well lets just go through his "analysis" point by point. first he does not like the two sentences "The actions that we took over the weekend are causing people to question if we are still committed to these values. We absolutely are and I will explain." he claims that using a "topic sentence" is not something commonly done in english and could therefore be written and translated by someone in china. I see it as the dude (or his lawyers. whoevere wrote it) trying to say "this is why people are mad at us and they totally should not be. 
---
He next talks about the 3 things they did and how they could have done it better. He says that the questions before paragraphs is odd in english but normal in Chinese. I cannot speak for what is normal in china, but to me it looks like he is just trying to separate out 3 points and what they want to do better in the future without it just being a huge wall of text. he also mentions here that he thinks there are 2 speakers(?) one writting the headers and the other copy and pasting official blizz responses?? i dont understand that reasoning at all...
---
his last point is he does not like these 2 sentences:
---
"When we think about the suspension, six months for blitzchung is more appropriate, after which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses. There is a consequence for taking the conversation away from the purpose of the event and disrupting or derailing the broadcast."
---
Apparently it should be "thinking about the suspension..." and "There are consequences for taking..." and writing it this way would only be done if it was a Chinese author. This seems like really weak evidence to me...
---
All 3 of these points adds up to conspiracy theory at best IMO.
---
I'll leave you with this: Even if someone in China did write this, why would they not have someone (or a team of people) make sure the language used sounded like it was written from a native english speaker? this is obviously an important statement from blizz to their english community. you would think they could spend time making it sound like China did not write it even if they did right?
---
That "I" did sound/look weird there. It's too personal in a sentence that otherwise isn't as personal. It should have been worded in another way - a better way.
---
Stop spamming this shit.
---
Which would be relevant if she was in China.  But if you look at her bio, she's in the UK.

Yeha wtf is this "sentence"
---
&gt;At Blizzard, our vision is “to bring the world together through epic entertainment.” And we have core values that apply here: Think Globally; Lead Responsibly; and importantly, Every Voice Matters, encouraging everybody to share their point of view
---
Either this person has a middle school education or English is not their first language.
---
Oh gosh. Did they think we wouldn’t notice? Thank you for sharing that. I’m so horrified at this company, of which I used to be a massive fan.
---
BUt not really LOL
---
At the very least they reduced the punishment. Still tooo harsh, particularly against the casters, but no longer nuclear.
---
I suspect this is as far as they were allowed to go without suiciding in China, and I would be almost ready to start healing over this, if it wasn't for that "totally not related to China" bs. I'm ok with PR speak, I'm not okay being this blatantly lied to.
---
Again, that's semantics. You didn't even use the same word in your example. "Divisive" and "divided" don't carry anywhere near the same potential negative connotations.
---
That's also now a pretty big bias on your part. I don't know enough about linguistics or chinese/english to make a judgement on that. But in plain English theres some thinly-veiled apologetic bullshit on the nose is All Voices Matter - But Some Matter More Than Others^tm and  Thinking Globally - About Geoeconomics and Politics^tm
---
I'm upset that they have shown money outweighs free speech.  Their change in tune is only temporary unless they feel they can't get away with this again in the future.  They only understand $.
---
Don't do it, just wait for the blowout to be posted for free lol
---
What sort of proof do you have that they are bots?
---
I bet Pooh is a veritable Pinata of Honey.
---
If it was almost any other issue people would be laughing at Blitzching talking about how he deserved ban.  Problem is the Hong Kong situation is especially sensitive right now.
---
I don't know if anyone has mentioned this yet, but they didn't address the disgusting tactic of preventing users from deleting their accounts. Abhorrent.
---
This has no hard facts or evidence. Get this crap outta here.
---
This is well written and addresses all the issues. However, it's ambiguous and also towing the line. Corporate-speak.
---
I still don't understand why the hosts are still banned. What rile did they break?
---
Will Blizzard share user data with Tencent?
---
Will Tencent share your personal data with CCP?
---
Username checks out
---
Nah. If blizzard america said that china would have freaked and to me it would have proved it.
---
I am writing this note not for you fine folks visiting reddit but for blizzard and the bots that roam the internet that will report back to them. You guys may also read tho.
---
Blizzard,
---
I have loved your company since day one. Diablo, Warcraft, WoW, Overwatch, and ect.... I could go on. I bought stocks into your company because I thought you were awesome. I couldn't believe the actions you took here. I can't believe you came back with this weak statement / half assed apology. 
---
Freedom of speech is one of the most sacred human right. And I hate calling it a human right. It should be considered a human norm. What type of species are we when we limited the topics of convo and when and where you can bring it up? 
---
I myself will no longer be buying into companies that bend the knee. It's goodbye for now. Let me know when you want to come back to the human side.
---
Ex Blizzard fan.
---
&gt;  a Chinese Blizzard employee or affiliate wrote parts of the statement?
---
Be president of Blizzard    
---
Get company accused of supporting China    
---
Have statement issued    
---
Have native Chinese writer type it out in their own words    
---
Reddit sees through your bullshit
---
Every human knows what human rights are.  Yes, even people in China.   I hope you're being farcical.  If not, you may want to start here: http://www.hrweb.org/legal/udhr.html
---
Yes - the exact definition may be contested, but given the facts, reasonable intelligent people will be able to agree "yes, this is a violation of human rights" or "no, this is not" if they do not have an alternative agenda.  
---
Could you actually look up what shareholder activism is?  It's not a silver bullet.  Nothing is.  Suffice it to say, it turns out companies do have as a primary concern, human rights, given sufficient incentives.  I worked in legal for a large company.  There was a division dedicated to human rights.  
---
Again, if you could put something together with substance, maybe it would be interesting.  I like how you just assume everyone knows China is an "oppressive authoritarian regime".  My wife is from China and her understanding is that the Hong Kong protesters are a bunch of terrorists because they do property damage and randomly beat people up in the streets.  I, being a proud libtard, think she's been brainwashed by Chinese sponsored propaganda.  But I don't know the truth.  But apparently you've got it all figured out.  
---
Nothing personal, but with phrases like "virtue signaling" and "liberal idealist values" you just sound like an edgy 19 year old to me.
---
I just enjoyed [this](https://i.redd.it/7vtkmn8rh0s31.jpg) hypocrisy. Not to mention the increased severity of this case as opposed to other more egregious offenses such as personal/political attacks combined or literally cheating (because it's only about the game, right blizz?)
---
You pitchforkers don't want an apology.
---
You want Blizzard to come out and say "Fuck China" and completely cut ties with them. You're power tripping on your keyboards demanding unreasonable things because you have no idea how these things work.
---
Dude got his money back, his ban has been reduced but now you still want Blizzard to get on their knees for you and beg forgiveness for not deciding who is the good or the bad guy because you have the luxury of reading and saying whatever you want about China in complete anonimity. They don't get to decide that.
---
Why is it garbage?
---
I mean, what part do you not agree with?  You are of course allowed your opinion and I'm curious what it is?
---
And yes, I played other Blizzard games but not Hearthstone.  But since you can't protest in Blizzard forums this was the next best place to congregate.
---
Thanks Chima
---
I hope they fried those boots before swallowing them whole
---
Hence why this guy guy goes back willingly twice a day
---
What a load of shit
---
You thought you wanted an apology, but you didn't!
---
they did not ban the american players who held up the pro hong kong sign and have not use this rule before if they had done it before I would not care much.
---
Dude. Sapphiron, Sindragosa and Lord Marrowgar are all edited for China. Have been for literally a fucking decade.
---
Oh, thanks for pointing out. I was misled by the phrasing of "Chinese speaker and English student".
---
I'm with you, they must've had to bounce it back and forth multiple times and then rushed it out Friday. Couldn't even mask obvious problems like: "We now believe he should receive his **prizing**."
---
This is either someone with a middle school education or not a native English speaker. These sentences are a fucking mess.
---
Strategic posting time. Friday, markets closed, journalists went home, most people will be out and about, an entire weekend to let people forget. Not to mention, the apology itself has a bunch of fluff to hide their "no influence from China" bit. It's a BS response.
---
For sure it's more complex than meets the eye. Most redditors don't know shit about eglin AFB most addicted "city" either from back in the day, that's OG shit. 
---
either way, blizzard are greedy phony fucks (like most every corporation these days) and I'm glad they're getting dunked on regardless of the reason. I'll clap every time a megacorp gets rolled like this.
---
You don't stop being a "native speaker". All it means is that you learned the language by growing up in that country. If it's a multilingual country (like South Africa, Singapore, or Ireland in certain areas) then you could be a Native speaker of multiple languages.
---
Children of immigrants are another example, where they tend to speak one language at home and another out of the home, making them a native speaker of both languages.
---
HK is fighting on the streets in fear of actual police retaliation, please let's not equate boycotting a company by putting a gaming account on the line to what the HK population is going through.
---
The sad part is that we're holding a company to a higher standard than our own governments.
---
But money
---
"Every Voice Matters, encouraging everybody to share their point of view." How does silencing someone accomplish this in any way? This reads like complete BS because the statement directly contradicts itself.
---
Oh that's disappointing, but expected.    How pathetic can you be.
---
Lol, yes this made up word is just amusing as well...and a give away. I wondered at the time why use what I'd figure a Chinese person might write/say in something written in English. I mean it is written how I imagine a Chinese person, with little ability to speak English, might say the word prize. It just struck me as wrong.
---
&gt; there wasn’t even a tavern brawl post
---
ahem -- https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfjbpv/tavern_brawl_this_week_is_doom_in_the_tomb_oct_9/
---
sorry if you expected it to get sticky-ed, but I'm not an HS mod
---
I read the whole damn thing. It's good... it's really good.
---
But fuck them.
---
There was some excuses. Some responsibility taken. A combination of many things.
---
But at the end of the day.
---
They decided to use their fine print as a tool to make more money. Fuck Blizzard
---
Integrity?
---
Interesting. Do you consider Canada a "third world shithole"? Norway? Denmark?
---
I mean, to be fair, it's "divisive" in that it divides China from the west.
---
What's interesting, though, is the fact that it's such a fundamental American value that people who almost never agree on anything are, for once, on the same team.  It's nice to see everybody pretty much on the same side for once, and to be reminded that there such things as fundamental American values.
---
&gt; Maybe someone can give a speech about non-binary genders after that. 
---
Actually that has happened in past streams in Overwatch.
---
In fact they did an entire official stream segment in support of LGBTQ
---
So yes actually they have in the past used their streams as a soapbox.
---
So why stop with only Hong Kong?
---
I mean in Western world it is not even as divisive as people being gay.
---
In fact if anything it seems to be the only political topic that has united most of the western world.
---
So this should be less controversial than a stance they have already taken and shown on an official blizzard stream.
---
Reasons why I don’t believe that the China part was a part of this:
---
1. The speed of the punishments.
---
2. The lack of communication since then.
---
3. Releasing this on Friday night (aka when no one is watching the news)
---
4. They didn’t really say what he did wrong just that.. he did? Like he did something against the rules he agreed to but what???
---
I get the feeling they couldn't change one.single.word. That's how you end up with obvious Engrish sentences like: "We now believe he should receive his **prizing**."
---
Ironically the age I was watching the west wing was right about when I was deeply involved in playing Blizzard games.  Still one of my favorite shows....  Glad I am not alone in fondly remembering those episodes.
---
The internet outrage mob is just focused on Blizzard because it's the hot take this week. Next week they will be outraged over something else. Loyal fans just have to weather the storm.
---
This just goes to show you how fast people forget the good Blizzard does in favor of a few missteps. 
---
Also, this goes to show you who the true fans are.
---
Better than a text with ‘sorry lololol’?
---
Have you read the statement? The grammar is clearly awful, and even if it wasn’t written by someone in China, it clearly wasn’t written by someone proficient in English. That alone is something worth criticizing Blizzard about.
---
I mean I played since beta and quit this week. The state of the meta isn't some phantom zone. 
---
Desert Hare plus Evolve is just dumb. Lightbomb, Mass Hysteria, Plague of Death, Sylvanas, and N'Zoth in standard all in the same deck is also dumb.
---
“ I did not have sexual relations with that woman”
---
I have a genuine question.
---
When people bring up the issue of censorship here in reddit others say that Reddit is a private company and that free speech doesn't matter much here.
---
Doesn't the same apply to Blizzard here?
---
To be fair, Taiwan is not recognized as a country in most places, this includes the US as we stopped officially recognizing them as a country in 1979. Not surprising that blizzard doesn’t recognize it either.
---
Heil Chairman Xi Jingping. Lynch the traitor publicly!!!
---
and what is the detention for the 6 months? for clearing voices for the CCP?
---
You can reference facts. Asking what it is a reference to doesn't dispute it's validity.
---
Except one is an opinion on a president, and another is someone calling for the freedom of a country, where its own military are killing the citizens for peaceful protests. Last I checked, the right or left arent killing peaceful protestors.
---
I highly doubt the sincierty of this...rather weak excuse.
---
Save the organs, please.
---
Why not ? Hot topic - easy clicks
---
Had they done this from the start, sure. But they're only doing it because they may have spawned the biggest shitstorm in gaming history, and for no other reason. Plus they dare to treat us all like morons with this statement, and not even say anything that even begins to look like an apology?
---
No, I would've not been terribly upset if this was the way it was handled at the onset. But now? After this? Fuck no.
---
please ignore this person, thank you

Asshole - a stupid, irritating, or contemptible person.

If you ask me I picked a very fitting term. Certainly a lot better than calling a polite person aloof or mocking them for not understanding a secondary language.

---
They aren’t trying and don’t need to convince all of us. They just need something to calm down the people who are on the fence or close to it. Anyone who was sitting back and thinking to themselves...’hmm, I’m not sure how I feel about this’. Can now comfortably lean forward and start playing Blizzard games again. 
---
“See guys it’s cool, they backed down.”
---
Hell yeah, man. How laughable is the attempt at damage control.
---
Because a big part of a corporate lawyer's job is to word things in a way that doesn't accidently say what you don't want to say, commit to something you don't want to commit to or is ambiguous in a way that can be used against you.
---
It kind of sucks that the higher ups don’t take more responsibility and this is because they just want to show how much they can make the company in terms of profits and then move on (unless they built the company themselves in which case they are usually more emotionally attached to it). The CEOs should be held accountable for these decisions and the higher ups not the employees. As profits drop they’ll just fire people and point to the profits and say “look at how much we’ve made this quarter” and the stakeholders will be happy. No, fuck that shit, there is no punishment for immoral decisions that lead to more profits, except for us consumers that will attempt to boycott as much as we can over this, but even then the CEO could just move on and no one knows or even cares except for a handful that follow that kind of stuff. 
---
Please don’t let this die out, part of our demands in fact should be the higher ups taking the responsibility for this mess and not just firing a bunch of people to make up the loss the boycott has caused, though I’m doubtful how much effect that will have it is frustrating to constantly see other people get thrown under the bus and the higher ups just continue on their merry way showing off their quarterly earnings reports
---
Yea that's my feelings as well. Although I don't agree with what Blizzard did, you bet I will buy Diablo 4 day 1. Me not buying anymore of their games won't affect any of their higher ups that actually make decisions. The most it will do is get some poor employee fired.
---
Hey man, stop accusing Activision of valuing human rights. They don't need that.
---
Guess what?? Adam Silver had the balls to still stand for free speech. And the NBA has many million more invested in china than blizzard even does. So yes, blizzard had the chance to make a statement that coulda meant something and instead got a pr bullshit WRITTEN BY THE CHINESE.
---
I actually already looked (i.e. I did a half-hearted Google search back to 2000), but didn't find anything. I don't think he writes many public statements. He seems to be more of a speaker than an author.  
---
 
---
However, I don't think it would matter, because this statement most likely wasn't written by Brack. It was *signed* by Brack, but the bulk of the statement is certainly a composite of statements by many team members, including lawyers, Brack's VP's, and possibly internal consultants. Brack probably collated all of it and put his own flourishes in it to make it sound more personal, but I really doubt he wrote the whole thing himself.  Other people's language influenced the final product, but that doesn't imply that it was the Chinese.  
---
So, all of this is really grasping at straws. I mean, if you need any further convincing, our own President can't even form a coherent sentence in English without autocorrect. And even then he somehow fucks it up.
---
A genuine one?
---
I replied to the wrong person, whoops. To you I would say that I would like to hear what they think this opposing view point is exactly, to lay bare the kind of thinking they are giving equal weight to exactly.
---
Here's my piece, as a very average Blizzard gamer;
---
 This faux apology is nothing but propaganda, intended to snare  a few of their outraged cash cows into ignoring the obvious fact that this company is the PRC's bitch. Nobody believes that Chinese money wasn't the ONLY reason behind your "quick reaction". Fuck everything about your reaction, I don't care how quick it was.
---
I'm satisfied with this response.
---
I fully agreed with Kibler that the punishment was too harsh, but in principle there needed to be punishment. This reduction is reasonable. 6 month ban is honestly not that significant as far as this kind of violation is concerned. 
---
For anyone who doesn't think there should be any punishment, [I've shared my thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dg7d9m/au_player_here_we_arent_being_punished_for_the/f3dl66v/) on that in response to a series of comments.
---
This needs to be posted everywhere.
---
Ahem, here's my statement:
---
Fuck you, Blizzard.
---
At HS tournament with university teams students used their webcams midgame (or at the end, don't remember) and hold sign with support for Hong Kong movement and Blitzchung. Only thing that happened was that for the rest or tournament webcams was off and there was no post-interview, and Blizzard said they'll not punish team.
---
What's the big deal about this anyways? They banned a guy for speaking out about Hong Kong. Why are people making such a big deal about it.
---
Ironically your last paragraph is the US censored version, the original version had communists instead of socialists.
---
Same..let's see
---
No answer so far..and not very high hopes that they will "release" arena wins in some time TBH..
---
&gt;about what the guy had said live on broadcast. Get a fucken grip
---
Asking for basic human rights isn't political or controversial, you need to get a grip and get your brain checked.
---
Not that it matters here but i hate how the translator completely changed the tone.
---
The original was a very bland, corporate apology, for example the last sentence actually says
---
&gt;at the same time, we will also continue as always to resolutely defend national dignity
---
The word earlier translated as "highly" got translated as "at all cost" (the best translation is "determined", but I chose "resolutely" because it flows better and basically means the same thing), added "pride" for no reason, and specified "china".
---
I live in China and edit articles written by Chinese speakers regularly.
---
It feels very Chinese, especially after it starts going into the numbered sections. The first few paragraphs feel like a native English speaker but the rest is structured the way a Chinese person would structure a statement like this.
---
It seems someone doesn’t follow sports.
---
Uh-huh, Blizzard? Not buying it. I can read Chinese. I saw what you wrote to your overlords, man. 
---
They seriously think all of us are stupid. Literaly stupid. That's not me assuming. Blizzard legit thinks we are uneducated idiots with a short attention span.
---
Even before opening it I don't think anyone (okay, maybe a couple people) thought that Brack wrote the statement himself, but click through and read a few random news stories from Blizzard. You won't find any odd punctuation or indentation (without bullet points or quotes) or awkward phrasing because those news stories were, in fact, written by Blizzard's main public relations department. Given the way this situation has been handled the writing in this statement is dubious at best and it's not out of the realm of possibility that it was written, or at least heavily influenced, by someone with other interests.
---
usually when pre-orders get filled up, a sold out tag appears on most online stores
---
 At Blizzard, our vision is “Money.”  
---
...nah that doesn't sound right.
---
 At Blizzard, our vision is “to bring the world together through epic entertainment.”  Nailed it!
---
Calling this "whatever they want" is a stretch.  They're a Chinese business, run by Chinese people, headquartered in China, with Chinese customers.  What part of this post was in appropriate for them to post, as a Chinese business headquartered in China?
---
Not a shill, I just know to look at the whole picture and not just feed into outrage culture.
---
I'm 100% with HK and their plight and fuck China. Doesn't mean we should be obligated to use everything as a grandstand for it.
---
I did look at his post history afterward. It was a disappointing adventure.
---
Probably for the same reason it was posted in whatever place was the 12th like 6 hours ago. Hint, not California.
---
Remember that the Hong Kong protests started over a bill that has since been retracted, YET THEY STILL FIGHT. It is too little too late for Activision-Blizzard
---
I teach English and work with companies on localizing English content. This reminds me of everything I've ever read by a Taiwanese business or school trying to add English to their official statements.
---
HK is protesting against China's political encroachment among other things. When HK was handed back to China in 1997, they were promised autonomy for at least 50 years, making that up to 2047. This joint agreement is registered with the UN. It is only 2019, and already there has been attempts to draft up a law that allows extradition from HK to mainland China, where rule of law doesn't apply and prisoners often vanish into organ harvesting camps, never to be seen again.
---
These people are sadly bad with distinction, nuance and investigation in general. They see antifa involved with a event that has a fight and they rush to say because of that all antifa is bad, that what happened wasn't justifiable, or that they just buy into a false narrative of events because consuming accurate information is apparently hard. They want to be morally superior and are more concerned with being right than anything else.
---
I see, you were just trying to be as accurate as possible with the translation. I just wanted to make sure that it didn't muddy the waters if possible
---
Fuck Blizzard. Let’s see THEIR tax returns.
---
Can you imagine if someone after winning a tournament said something   like "Black Lives Matter", or "I support gay rights"?  Like hell Blizzard would ban them, the casters, and take away prize money.   Seriously if, they're going to stand by their no politics stance, they have to ban, and if they do, watch as all the social media rage about Blizzard being intolerant and racist. 
---
Their stance is inconsistent at best, and straight up false and manipulative at worst.
---
Aren’t you guys endorsing wholesale slaughter of Kurds just now and were/are putting kids in cages? I don’t see how an opinion on that president is so different
---
I mean I think this is basically the OP's point. If your definition of "divisive" can include very morally clear-cut things like ending slavery, then saying "our platform is not a place for any divisive views" is just not morally justified.
---
Like, just imagine that this whole thing had happened in the 1850s and blitzchung had used his post-match interview to say something like "Free the slaves!" Yeah, that would have been super divisive - but if Blizzard tried to stay "neutral" by banning him for it... there's nothing to call that but complacency in the face of injustice.
---
What do you want them to support HK? That completely goes against everything they were saying, about not having ANY politics in gaming. I agree they should’ve punished him if he was for or against HK. Gaming tournaments are not a place for politics, it’s a place for gaming
---
It wont hurt blizzard? WHAT.   
---
Bo-hoo you paid some money, guess what? So did the people that will protest, they just chose to take a stance for humanity, something that sounds too expensive for you
---
What's wrong with communists?  And what does that have to do with China?
---
If it helps you feel like all that time was worth it, I consider this a bestof worthy post and you excellently tore open the core of what's truly at stake here.
---
Thank you for taking the time to share it.
---
the statue was on preorder, every thing else was released from before so they probably have a warehouse full of that other crap
---
Also like.. the average quality of life has quadrupled in the last 20-30 years. Economic success goes a long way to making people trust their government. If we had the same sort of improvements here in the west we wouldn't be so fucking pissed at the people in control of our societies.
---
Start at 89 seconds in, should be during his speech.
---
I agree and am happy to see this
---
"tending to cause disagreement or hostility between people"
---
That's the definition of divisive. That's what's happening in HK right now.
---
Damage is done and the statement is a pile of bullshit. So disappointing because Blizzard to me has always released the best games, but they will never get another penny out of me again.
---
Just in case you think they are being honest:
---
https://i.imgur.com/xZylqhd.jpg
---
China is trying to end democracy. Not taking a political stance is a stance. 
---
We like to pretend the Cold War s over because the Soviets fell. But China is there to pick up the sword.
---
This is absurd. These companies are bending iver backwards for a nation that happily steals their intellectual property and promotes Chinese companies over their own.
---
No they did that by themselves. Blizzard has been declining for a long time. This might just be a death blow. They lost all reputation and now all favor as well
---
You really think that it isn't true and they wouldn't do the same for an opposite statement? Lol
---
Hey, can someone take the Wayne's World "sponsor" scene and modernize it to match this crap? I mean, if we can just get those actors to do it, it'd be even better.
---
I'm sorry but they are when they're being infringed by a state actor, while we all agree that China shouldn't be infringing on them, they are.
---
Not to us
---
To be fair it is pretty divisive to ask for human rights in China.
---
&gt;Can’t make the Chinese mad at us, no no
---
What do you mean by "Chinese"? Chinese people, who will boycott Blizzard games for supporting Hong Kong? Or Chinese govenment, who will ban Blizzard games in their country for Hong Kong?
---
Thus statement in no way gets blizzard off the hook for me. Blitzchung was forced to use the only outlet he had to bring awareness to the probelms facing Hong Kong. If blizzard really cared about his voice they would provide a platform for him to speech on.
---
Tons, of which you know none.
---
Eat an elephant one bite at a time.
---
&gt;Blizzard is done in the west
---
Internet hypocrites are funny lol
---
someone should try it
---
this is a western way of thinking. in China, image matters more than reality. people have absolutely no problem buying counterfeit or imitation goods. it doesn't matter if your Gucci purse or iPhone is real--what matters is that your neighbours see you using it.
---
"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."
---
If you disagree, you're un-American and an evil authoritarian. Period.
---
You spineless, sycophantic cunts
---
While I’m on board with the apology being written by the Chinese, I have got to say that as someone who speaks two languages “natively”. Languages totally mix in your brain in super subtle ways. 
---
Right now I study one of my languages at a higher level and the teacher have criticized my writing for using the wrong grammar.
---
A Twitter plug and analysis by a grammar nazi.
---
You do realize this is the same kind of bullshit tactics  that you are currently "fighting" against right? You're trying to fill peoples heads with baseless information and trying to pass it off as fact. Literally propaganda. 
---
Absolutely detestable what the internet's version of the protest has evolved into.
---
Stepping stone, HK has been in a weird political situation in general even without taking protests in mind, if mainland sees HK succeed in protests (propaganda coverage may be more difficult with how close they are and language not being as big of a barrier) it could raise questions in mainland.
---
Anyone who does see HK as being under China right now (even if it’s inaccurate) would view this as a rogue state, and any victory there could be seen as anti-China. Think about it in USA terms for ‘good’ things, once one state legalizes medical marijuana and it doesn’t collapse on itself, then others can see if there was any benefits and try to pass it themselves, so if the head of the USA sees marijuana as bad then they’d see the trend as appalling and harmful to the USA.
---
just google it like every other player in the game

Reminder that CoD Mobile is awaiting the CCP's approval.
---
Hmm.
---
To  everyone trying to  wave off the weibo post because it's from netease.  Understand that netease and  this account in particular is intended to represent Blizzard in China.  This isn't some random independent company  posting, they are partnered.  Blizzard is fully capable of clarifying this Chinese weibo  statement  if  they wanted to so it doesn't conflict with what they're  telling western  audiences that this doesn't have to do with Chinese  relations. Instead,  they are ignoring it completely so they can play  both sides.
---
There's nothing from  netease that says, "oh btw, nothing we just said  represents what  blizzard thinks, it's just our opinion and we have no  real idea why  these people got banned".
---
If a US  diplomat made a formal statement in China that was opposite of the US   government's actual viewpoints, you'd be damn sure the US government  would clarify that.
---
Sorry about the money, but blizzcon is the best place to make their investors see problems in blizzard. It is in the best interest of people upset with blizzard to make it known to all the cameras there.
---
Chinese Government
---
Ad hominems are a bad look, just so you know. And you're comparing someone's forum post to an official statement by a major corporation which just shows that you're reaching and don't have any real meaningful input.
---
I think that's a fair point of yours. However, based on what I've seen recently, I just doubt if there is no factor at all of China behind the decision, and the exact wording doesn't mean much anymore...
---
Frankly the problem there is that the punishment for xQc was too light.
---
I have lived in Hong Kong for 14 years, and 15 outside of it.
---
it is an absolutely divisive issue over there. And HK people have all sorts of viewpoints. I have friends, family and relatives on both sides of the support. Meanwhile people who are reading a couple of online posts are screaming they know the right and the wrong, and this is pure oppression and somehow freeing Hong Kong is a solution?
---
This isn't even about HK vs China. What is 'Pro Hong Kong'???  What is in the best interest of Hong Kong people? 
---
Here is what is 'Pro Hong Kong' :
---
1. There are HK people who supported the extradition bill, and don't see it an issue. 
---
2. There are HK people who supported the extradition bill and wanted immediate lock down of the city and exercise martial law. 
---
3. There are HK people who don't support the extradition bill but wanted peaceful protests and nothing to do with violence. 
---
4. There are HK people who don't support the extradition bill, and once the bill got axed they are happy with it and don't want any more civil unrest. 
---
5. There are people who don't support the extradition bill and continue to get the 5 or more demands fulfilled from Lam. 
---
6. There are people who want the 5 demands and would use violence to get it. 
---
7. There are people who wanted complete independence. 'Free Hong Kong' 
---
8. There are people who want the British to take Hong Kong back. 
---
... But somehow some people know exactly what the collective of Hong Kong people want. 
---
You can't just label it 'basic human right', the world isn't black and white. 'if its a human rights issue, it can't be a political issue', this is naive thinking. 
---
What Chung expressed was the sentiment and ideals shared from a portion of Hong Kong people. He could have said this in his own channels and outlet, not through an official tournament interview. 
---
It doesn't even matter how blizzard respond, people just want to carry their pitchfork. Damned if they do, damned if they don't.
---
Fuck off, bootlicker
---
You're right. Something a bit more native would be:
---
&gt; After some consideration [or "deliberation], we have decided to reduce Blitzchung's suspension to six months, after which time he may once more [or "again"] compete in the Hearthstone Pro Circuit.
---
The entire thing is awkwardly phrased for what they want to convey. It wasn't written by a native speaker.
---
CK plays in the NFL, for one thing.
---
Why do you doubt that, when people get up in arms regularly for companies that do just that?
---
Busted
---
Companies want to distance themselves from politics for good reasons. Blizzard and other companies aren’t here to do that, they’re here to provide products and services.
---
I'm willing to wager everything I have that Blizzard would react just as harshly, if for no other reason than to appear impartial.
---
This is what I'm excited to see/hear about. Had I still been living in San Diego, I would have likely been going to blizzcon with signs to support hong kong. Probably end up removed from the venue. But fuck Blizzard. They can go get their Chinese money.
---
Red shirt guy knew this would happen. He was telling us something...Pog
---
Bull fucking shit
---
People are gonna forget about this whole thing in less than a month anyway
---
bro, it's not their fault they caused such a backlash that early in the week.  They did what they did and said Future Blizzard will handle that shit I'm going on break.
---
Ever owned a China knock off... Even if they have the knowledge to make them.
---
Two weird things, mate:
---
1. You're ignoring a ton of the people who acknowledge that Blitz was breaking the rules, but saying it was the *severity* of the ban that was too extreme.
---
2. You're preaching about democracy and "how people should behave to value democracy" (your version of democracy, anyway) while hilariously failing to acknowledge that China *isn't* in a democracy and that, while standing aside and remaining completely uninvolved is one way to go as a viewer of the drama, Blizzard *is forced* to take a side. Either they listen to China and hammer down on Blitz and the casters, or they don't listen to China and risk losing their market.
---
What Blizzard is doing now seems to be a precarious middle ground.
---
Just to illustrate the point of how your black-and-white thinking ignores the people I mentioned in point #1:
---
&gt; Now, first, the broadcast was supposed to be about the game, Blitzchung broke it, so here he was wrong.
---
Just because someone punches you doesn't mean you have to pull out a gun and shoot them.
---
It's called proportionality. You fit the punishment to fit the breakage of the rules.
---
Finally... do you not see anything wrong with Blizzard pretty much flat out lying about their connections to China having nothing to do with the severity of the punishment instigated against Blitzchung and the two casters?
---
Because if you believe that, I'll have you know I'm also a Nigerian Prince who is in a bit of a bind and would be *very* happy to reward you if you can loan me some money...
---
This person is getting paid by blizzard to write this....
---
This just shows that you understand nothing about the complexity of the Western companies operating on the Chinese market. For example, Blizzard aren't legally allowed to sell their products directly in China, so they need licence the rights out to a Chinese company, in this case NetEase. NetEase is a large independent company, there is no way blizzard vets any statements they put out beforehand. Sure, they might be able to threaten to tear up their contact with them if they feel they abuse the hearthstone name, but that would mean exiting the Chinese market completely.
---
Have fun getting your comment deleted for review bombing... Google takes this shit pretty seriously.
---
Oh yeah I'm definitely the baddie for not wanting Nazis and supremacists at my table. You got me. Glad you could show me an article where antifa members say they're going to fight supremacists because they feel these people are already coming after them. Genius. 
---
Keep making excuses for bigots. They love folks like you. That's why they're couched well into the GOP now since you've put chairs down for them.
---
🇹🇼
---
Still 6! Months
---
My Formal Response to Blizzard: Eat my entire ass.
---
Seriously, you wait so long to release a half-assed "adjustment" in which you lie to our faces and never apologize for your actions? You never admit wrongdoing or actually address why this caused so much consternation in your community/ You fill it with marketing doublespeak to try and sell us shit even now? 
---
Fuck you guys.
---
The next tournament winner should bring up something like his pets or a movie that he just watched in his interview and see if the same thing happens to him
---
Stop making excuses for fascists, bigot.
---
I wonder how much you guys paid the PR firm to type this out... FUCK CHINA
---
&gt;Rehiring the casters
---
&gt;With regard to the casters ... suspension to six months ...
---
yeah... no.
---
I am with you on this. Blizzard are trying to stay out of politics, but got forced in to it, of coarse you punish the one that forced you.
---
If Blizz really wanted to make things right they would end Blitzchung's ban and allow him to play again now if he wanted, same with the streamers let them work again to show the community a true sign of goodwill as well as give Blitzchung his prize money.  They would apologize to him and the streamers then they would apologize to all the fans and promise to support free speech and not put greed over their company values.  But you know money is the motive here so they're gonna keep sucking on China's dick.
---
This is straight up conspiracy bullshit at this point. it's definitely formal and diplomatic language, Crafted by a PR team over the past couple days
---
Don't even acknowledge the fact that they were blocking people from deleting accounts
---
At this point this is not really about Blizzard, it is more about the bonding strength of a common enemy and the sensation of doing something for a cause. The best thing Blizzard can do is to be silent and wait it out, literally anything else would lead to uproar. The interesting thing is the close date of Blizzcon.
---
You don’t think my words are valid in talking about ethical capitalism because of your definitions, so therefore I can’t be referring to a concept? What kind of semantics is this? 
---
Do you think I don’t know how the government works? The whole problem here is that you do not understand that by participating in an economic exchange, you are committing an act that can be viewed as moral, amoral, or immoral. That’s just how interactions are, dude. At a very basic level. You can’t claim economic actions are exempt from moral judgment. You can’t claim that the physical people participating in them are exempt from moral liability in the same way a corporation protects them from financial liability. You are ignoring this and saying “it’s not their place” but that can’t be true because they are participating with the authoritarian regime. Again, for your point to be valid, it boils down to countries having such a large economic influence that they are “too big to fail” and therefore we must tolerate any and all actions, but this is itself a moral failing. Why are economic sanctions the correct action? Because it forces the immoral actors into lockstep with the moral ones, not because people have to keep driving the car towards the building until they are explicitly told they have to stop.
---
&gt; they told him to go ahead
---
And for the last time, **that is literally what they should not have done.**
---
It wouldn't even matter until earnings anyway stock prices are basically algorithms and a boycott won't actually effect the stock price until we see hard declines in the next report
---
That's just what a corporate statement looks like after its been proofread by dozens of executives, publicists, and an entire legal team.
---
infamous
---
"Our relationships with China had nothing to do with our decision"
---
Press X to doubt
---
Isn’t remotely satisfactory?
---
It straight up insults me.
---
If it had no influence the us team would also get a 6 month ban including the shoutcasters.
---
dear mod, considering this apology moving forward what will the state of this subreddit be like? will we continue with non stop HK solidarity or ...
---
Did xQc say those things on Blizzard's official stream while on screen or did he say that on his personal stream/ in chat? Do you not see the difference there?
---
Can we have a 5pmFridayNews sub where we post bullshit like this that they try to drive under the radar with blatant tactics?
---
"Hey! Remember that time there was an issue with the actual game so we left reviews on the game about the game? Fuck that, let's just review bomb Hearthstone and get our reviews deleted so I have an excuse to post this again!"
---
Completely random heads up: "penultimate" means second-to-last, as in a list i.e. "this is the penultimate level of the game, after this is the final boss".
---
Yes, people can bash on Trump for a lot of things, but his stance on China has been pretty good and consistent. He acknowledged Taiwan, Called out Xi, took a stand for Uyghurs and HK (and backed it up with more tariffs), and recently called for the removal of its "developing" status. Honestly really well done. 
---
China is now avoiding talks and hoping the next administration goes soft, but unfortunately for them, a strong China policy is shared by both parties. With the public's opinion It's only going to get worse. 
---
I saw a lecture a few months ago about an expert saying the authority of the CCP relies heavily on economic growth, and that stopping could very possibly lead to a regime change. Nothing crazy like democracy, but still, hopefully something better.
---
What you more? You want them to go talk directly to the Chinese gov and say “you bitch, stop it” ? It’s a fucking video game company and they make video games, they don’t have the power or influence to fight for HK. Use your fucking head and find a real solution instead. Maybe a real movement? Maybe right to your president/gov of your own country? Ask for a real war? I don’t know... but for fuck sake be smarter than that lol....
---
Neat. And just like Hong Kongers, we shouldn't stop protesting until ALL of our demands are met. Fuck soulless multinational millionaire-led corporations pushing for censorship.
---
First Symmetra now this? I can't handle a world of W+M1 classes...
---
Sorry not sorry. Keep buying our stuff
---
The very last one in the thread, “there is a consequence”, is enough red flags by itself that you only need to add the stars.
---
im assuming you dont know they apologized?
---
You keep chanting your core values over and over again but they mean nothing.
---
YOU'VE made then mean nothing. Core values are nothing if you don't stick by them. Seeing them keep chanting these values while making up excuses for not upholding them is maddening.
---
Welcome to Mob Mentality. Half the people raging are just here for fun and they don't actually care about HK.
---
Does the average person not consume more news on the weekend like me? I'm dead fucking busy Mon-Thur so i've had minimal time to sit down and look at this shit tbh, but now it's the weekend i've got nothing but time.
---
Had they released this earlier i potentially could have missed it, admittedly had it not been for the giant shitstorm, but posting it on a Friday after work is practically a guarantee i'll come across it whether or not it's flooding Reddit.
---
Same in Sweden. Oddly quiet around all of this.
---
That's what you get when you have a very effective brain washing system
---
We did it, Reddit! We saved Hong Kong!
---
&gt;NetEase is essentially Blizzard CN 
---
No, not really.  There is no "essentially Blizzard CN."  It's a separate Chinese company.  Blizzard doesn't control it.  
---
&gt;If Blizzard wanted to distance themselves from these remarks they could 
---
Sure, if they wanted to breach their contract with Netease and get themselves taken out of the Chinese market entirely, they could do that.
---
It's against the ToS to use names of real people and places.
---
I really like Kibler's point that something seems off when it takes Blizzard only two days to ban someone for speech the Chinese don't like but for proven cheaters it takes longer.  Seriously, wtf is that.
---
Also, how is it in any way possible to moderate all kinds of political speech.  
---
There's no way he gets punished if he doesn't speak out against the Chinese.
---
As you mentioned, not all style guides require spaces and those that do really only do so when you are using ellipses within quotations. That being said, if someone was, for some reason, writing this based off style guidelines then where is the double spacing, references, etc.? It is *very* unlikely that Brack (or whatever public relations person actual writing) would use an ellipsis without spaces one month then with them a few months later.
---
Well that, and the whole post saying they'll defend China's honor.
---
You mean replying to people spamming misinformation about the Weibo post.  People think that was posted by Blizzard, it was posted by Netease.
---
&gt;We don't need China to have spyware on so many PCs
---
Ok come on now, you act like the US doesn't spy on as many people as it can, installing backdoors into processors when they are manufactured and so on.  It's not like the NSA ceased operations just because Snowden spilled the beans.
---
halF tHe PEoPle rAGING ARe JuST HEre fOr Fun and they Don't aCTuALly caRE AbOUT HK
---
Fuck Blizzard
---
&gt; you've already admitted you support violence against people whose speech you don't like?
---
And what speech is that which I don't like pray tell? 
---
&gt;Is it the documented fact that some of the violence was against a reporter?
---
What do you consider documented and which reporter is that? [Ngo?](https://www.portlandmercury.com/blogtown/2019/08/26/27039560/undercover-in-patriot-prayer-insights-from-a-vancouver-democrat-whos-been-working-against-the-far-right-group-from-the-inside) So a reporter that goes around antagonizing antifa with a fight seeking right-wing group gets a fight to fuel their smears?
---
Honestly this shit is pretty weak.
---
Apologise?
---
Complete non-apology. Incredible. Also, apparently advocating for democracy and human rights is "divisive." Just a reminder to everyone that corporations are inherently autocratic institutions. They put up with democracy, but they have no need or desire for it and would rather it stay away from them and the serfs they control.
---
This. I don't know who was posted those "Day 1" "Day 2", etc posts to make sure the protests against Blizzard didn't stop, but remember his posts, because we can't stop. Their statement is fucking dogshit, so like OP said, continue the boycott and if you're going to Blizzcon, go as Winnie the Pooh or Mei!
---
Nah, fuck that.  The damage has been done.
---
&gt;rehired the casters
---
That's the most laughably ridiculous comment I've seen for some time.
---
Do you think someone who was instantly fired by knee-jerk reaction has the clout to come back after 6 months to the same job that they were forced out of? What about the people they hire in the meantime while this person is on suspension.
---
If you can't see that the casters are still effectively fired, I can't help you.
---
"Oh wait, you have a contract that says you could do literally whatever you want for any reason at all solely up to your own discretion? Well then, to the gulag with him."
---
I hope players will not be swayed by their eloquence and carefully crafted rebuttal to the response we gave their actions. They can't get away with the the blatant actions they took in regards to a political issue by favoring their large and profitable Chinese market. I'm not sorry Blizzard, and I'll never be back. Fucking ridiculous.
---
I understand the reasoning “the content didn’t matter, no political expression is allowed in order to protect our vision of the forum.”   Even if true though, which is completely their prerogative, my prerogative is to support companies that *support* human rights and dignity.  
---
If you want to ban players for advocating against hellish tyrannies so to preserve your venue’s precious neutrality, fine.  I’ll choose to take my business elsewhere.  
---
All that said, Blizzard is being disingenuous.   Read their statement posted in China.  The speed and harshness of their initial reaction makes their motives clear: protect business interests in China at all costs.  
---
No thanks Blizzard, subscription will stay cancelled.
---
It's ironic to see reddit decrying app removal now, when reddit was previously celebrating it and mocking anyone who warned it was bad precedent.
---
https://i.imgur.com/RZMANw5.png
---
K but would you for some odd reason make a claim of us patriotism for us while saying you're very angry at political views being on your broadcast? We can go back and forth all day but thinking what youre thinking just makes 0 sense. Makes 100% more sense to think they're speaking as hearthstone china and therefore are talking about their country.
---
They didn't invite him to do anything. Production allowed the interview to continue, and there was no way he was going to sign off without protesting, as he already had the mask on well before the casters gave him the last word. Do you think casters have a button in their desk to control what goes on the stream? The blame is squarely on the production team. With the caster ban, Blizzard is trying to set an example and appease China. Nothing more to it than that.
---
I hope blues scour those threads for intel for higher ups.
---
Dear Blizz, I grew up on Starcraft and Broodwar.
---
This is obvious blatant damage control. Not an ounce of a nod towards humanitarian crisis happening in HK.
---
This is about money and everyone knows it.
---
Still deleting my account, selling console versions and kicking you in the nuts with GDPR requests.
---
Wish you stayed Blizzard North.
---
I mean, the world did it to Germany, twice. And Japan.
---
Thanks I'll try that.
---
No one is dismissing anything, but to act like the 5 demands aren't controversial us laughable. If everyone agreed then it'd hardly be news, would it.
---
Yeah but if it were a Chinese player giving the opposite opinion about Hong Kong, you wouldn’t punish him and risk passing off your Chinese customers.
---
They did return the money. I was more talking overall, not in addition to what they've already done.
---
My bad for not making that clear enough.
---
so you mean its not right to think that either you support HK or you're literally harvesting human organs? 😂 people think HK is a black and white issue it sure as hell isnt. as someone else from a previous British colony i know for a fact these problems are complex, in my country there is a part called kashmir which is claimed by 3 countries all 3 of them hold different narratives to the resolution of the mess that it is over there all 3 of them when thought about from their own viewpoint are correct. point is people always have differing views.
---
There are worst things than being labelled a racist. Say boo. Stand up for your principles no matter what
---
Are you using Chinese device or ?
---
That’s not necessarily indicative that it was released in China though. They could’ve heard of it through the grapevine, or, you know, good ol fashioned skull and bones.
---
So Blizzard claims: "If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would have felt and acted the same". This is complete bs, there was no way they'd issue such a punishment to both blitz chung AND the casters without an influence. Sure, they reduced their suspension, but it just isn't enough. Remember that by sucking off China they chose money over basic human right for the people of HK. DON'T let this be the end of it
---
What is your strategy in this "debate," exactly? Just lie through your teeth and hope any passers-by didn't see the other posts?
---
I could answer your disingenuous question, [as I did before you even asked it](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfoxte/as_a_hong_konger_thank_you_rhealthstone_for/f3e8bwu/), but why bother when you'll just come out with the same trash reply as before?
---
We're done here. There's no more point debating someone like you than debating a CCP troll. You'd both rather kill me or send me off to a gulag than have an honest discussion. You are the baddies, and deep down, you know it.
---
What did Blizzard apologize for exactly?
---
Fuck China, death to the CCP

Op is trying to say that us who have such a low barrier to protest and do our part should do our part because its easier than being teargased and shot at with rubber bullets (and real ones too)

Intelligent individuals and those with empathy understand that the view that some races are lesser or need to be purged from our society is absolute bunk. Keep defending them though. It's amazing that you can sit there and defend a Nazi's right to speak about their racial superiority while getting a patriotism chub. Maybe someday you'll realize the irony in you defending actual fascists and racists.
---
Pretty easy to understand. Other issues are not as divisive and the stake is low.

There was a crisis meeting of HR, PR and Big wigs who tried to find the least counter reactionary statement for the investors. No company does any thing publicly without investors at heart. And don't think for a second that you're one of them.

Title of the post starts with "A LINGUIST."  It wasn't a fucking linguist.  It's literally some random college student who isn't a native English speaker.  They have no fucking clue what they are talking about.
---
&gt;You saying that the statement was "definitely written by committee with input from multiple executives" is complete conjecture, just as those who are suspicious of the origins of the statement. 
---
No, it's just fucking fact.  You'd have to be an idiot to think that this wasn't reviewed and edited by multiple executives.
---
Blame Clive "Fatty McFuckhead" Palmer.

Totally agree with them not having to. Totally agree with that they shouldnt. Totally agree that its a terrible thing. The actaul genocide and actaul violence is horrible, and honestly should be stopped, but no countries will care enough, nor be willing to risk it all in order to help. But with the censoring, and surveillance of their citizens, thats not other countries problem. People in china are not even totally against it, and if its the will of the government and the people let it slide, its not in the hands of us to say its not allowed. Thatd be like China saying its fucked up the united states allows their people to speak freely and that we all need to get together and stop it.
---
Well I'm quite agree with you.But sometimes rationalism means nothing changes.
---
And protesting for human rights shouldnt be political, same as LGBT. Its just a basic human right. And shouldnt have to be political. But in this world we live it has to be in order to maintain it. Is what i think he was going för.

Freedom is possibly one of the most divisive topics there is. To say people have different opinions on what freedom means, who should be free to do what and what people ought *not* be free to do is a complete understatement.
---
So yes, it's very divisive.
---
I can tell you confidently that the twitter post is correct. JAB did not write this speech. In this case I am not sure who wrote this wether it was his PR team or someone from China. But someone else in fact wrote it and he just looked it over and changed a few things to make it sound more to his liking. I am also sure that someone in Activision also had to approve this messaging.

They would 1 million % ban someone who did that right now. Are you kidding? That would be such a gift to Blizzard, to the point that they should seriously consider staging that just because of how much better it will make them look.
---
China is extremely touchy about territories they view as parts of China asserting independence (Tibet, Taiwan, now Hong Kong).  There are no two sides of a coin, they are part of China, period.  This is the reason no one in the world recognizes Taiwan as a country or why Taiwan has to go as Chinese Taipei for Blizzard Events/The Olympics.
---
With Hong Kong, its viewed as a separatist movement by China to a degree, and its something they will not accept, so saying anything about the protests is an attack on the state (see the NBA where Darryl Morey made a statement supporting the protests and the NBA's on the cusp of being banned in China due to one tweet because they won't fire him for it).  Any statements in support, especially on an official channel, would hurt China's pride/honor, hence the reaction.
---
The American equivalent would be going to a die-hard Republican and telling them Trump should be impeached (as of a couple weeks ago) or that Abortion should be legalized.
---
If say 2/10, would not create account again
---
Sure, but the implication is that any divisive statements would draw punishment, when as far as I can tell, that isn't the case.
---
Clive palmer is scum
---
That was the only one that really screamed red flag to me. The others were maybe plausible, but this is the only substantial point I see in the points they made.
---
And instead of walking it completely back, they just said "yeah maybe we were kinda harsh,but rules are rules, guys! We're still right, but hey, prize money!"
---
It's you. If you had enough of one game just move to another.
---
Translated from IGN. "We express our strong indignation [or resentment] and condemnation of the events that occurred in the Hearthstone Asia Pacific competition last weekend and absolutely oppose the dissemination of personal political ideas during any events [or games]. The players involved will be banned, and the commentators involved will be immediately terminated from any official business. Also, we will protect [or safeguard] our national dignity [or honor].”
---
I’m really glad he got the money he deserved, but still a big fuck you to Blizzard. How naïve do they think we are?
---
It is not just you.
---
I quit the game a year ago and never looked back.  From your description it seems I haven't missed much.
---
There's always bad shit happening somewhere in the world. You can't just stop everything until *all* intolerance and wrongdoing ceases. These Hong Kong protests are not even that large in the scale of government overreach and tyranny occurring right now.

To be honest, the only thing that would be the ethnical and morally right way to handle this would've been to state openly that they support HK in their fight for freedom. Staying silent (which they did not) or activly removing content that shows support for HK (which they did) both would be not correct in hindsight of what is happening in HK and how china handles human rights..

Coward cucks

Ah the old cattle farm holiday
---
I fear people are gonna take this protesting at Blizzcon way overboard and people might actually get hurt...
---
Idk I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for saying this.
---
While I do agree that the severity of the situation is a bit extreme, Blizzard was just following through with what they have written in their rulebook. The thing that every player has to read and agree to before being allowed to perform at a professional level. "The rule in question forbids players from doing anything that brings them into public disrepute, offends a portion or groups of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard's image". 
---
There's other incidents of Blizzard banning pro players for not obeying this rule too. It's not like this is the first time. xQc was one of them. Whether their PR is BS or not. They were just upholding the standards set for all their players.

Good friend of 20 years came out as gay. He has a huge MAGA flag on the wall and is a staunch conservative. Reason being, largely, is he hates the censorship coming from the left, the **intolerance** coming from the left if you try to think for yourself and not eat up the CNN/MSNBC corporate narrative that every corporation like Google, Amazon, etc supports, the effort to ban guns (which he sees as a means of self-defense), and, to a huge degree, the left's love affair with Islam. 
---
He notes that in many Muslim countries, it's perfectly normal to execute gays. And we aren't talking about a small group of hateful detractors attacking gays. No. The entire fucking city of a few thousand people all gather to throw the gays off the roof tops. He also notices the left's vehement hatred for Christians, despite being pretty central to western values, but their love affair w/ Islam, which is the exact opposite of tolerance and western values. 
---
He doesnt wan't his entire existence defined by his sexuality. He doesn't want a certain political party to "own" him and shove him in some identity box. He notes he never faced so much racism and hatred until coming out as a gay conservative (he is also Mexican). 
---
What you see from these corporations is just pandering and virtue signaling. They push pride flags **FOR THE MONEY**. Because as soon as big China comes in and says to do something inhumane, they do it immediately, because at the end of the day, every action is ABOUT THE MONEY. China in my lifetime was crushing student protesters w/ tanks and gunning them down w/ machine gun fire. Literally 5 years after the massacre our entire establishment politician uniparty was selling out our manufacturing to China (clintons, bushes, etc). That's the thing some younger people don't see that those in their 30s and 40s HAVE seen. Is that the Uniparty is a very real thing. Up until Trump, ever single politician, right or left, talks about social issues slightly differently but in action does the same exact shit. Whether it be waging war, printing money, etc. They all cater to the rich and powerful. 
---
Just think - why does bernie sanders have 3 homes and drive super expensive sport cars while saying that YOU should be taxed more? I remember when bernie did that townhall and someone asked why he doesnt voluntarily pay a higher rate. He refused to answer the question and deflected to "why does Trump refuse to pay more taxes." Well dumbfuck... Trump is advocating for lower taxes for everyone. That is a consistent position. You on the other hand want me to pay more taxes! YOU GO FIRST YOU DIRTY COMMIE!

believe it or not, I, too, have taken Psych 101 and I, too, am familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of needs. keep in mind, however, that psychology isn't an exact science and that Maslow's hierarchy is naught but a theory — understanding Maslow's hierachy does not provide one with objective insight into how humans work. really, it's been highly criticized through the years. I truly have no idea why you've brought it up. 
---
and good luck with soccer, then. play in the name of all of your ideals, perhaps it'll do you well. 
---
you bring up interesting ideas about sports and I can see where you're coming from, but do keep in mind the difference in scale between the NBA and the whole of e-sports. certainly seeing Blizzard stand up in favor of Hong Kong would have been a wonderful rallying call of sorts, but realistically I don't think they have enough influence to spit in the face of the CCP... again we move back to idealism but evidently people do not like questioning their deep-rooted idealism. 
---
&gt;But you see what you did do though? You made up reasons and motivations for me and my actions to suit your points before hearing even a single one.  I can not think of a more close minded approach to a discussion.  
---
you called my article trash and alluded to the idea of people doxing me due to my apparently incendiary views... and I am the person coming at this with a close-minded approach? that's rather a hot take!
---
If you wanted to make a point to blizzard, you could have just done this and send it to them. But you wanted approval here.
---
This is like they took half step back after running 25 km marathon.
---
Dose he think we are all this stupid?
---
4 days ago, some low-level manager in China (that's probably anti-HK) decided that a year suspension and no prize money was appropriate. Now that the issue has reached the blizzard CEO, he's made a different decision.
---
Why not both? You aren't obligated to read every post.
---
I mean one can do both. Who are you to assert that this is wrong. Boycotting a store!= forcing the store to share your views, the business(store/streamer in this case)  has no right to your patronage
---
They’re trying to keep that Blizzcon attendance up.
---
Why the fuck is he still banned?
---
I absolutely agree. This sub has become a place for people who never even played hearthstone to begin with to shitpost about blizzard.
---
If you work for the company, you represent their morals and values. All blizzard employees have Hong Kong blood on their hands by staying
---
Yeah, I think the cows should have been questioned. They definitely planned this.
---
Not really sure how to respond, okay?
---
The thing is, using the sentence of the movement is a divisive way of asking for attention about the situation. Divisive and deliberate way can thus still relate to the contents.
---
I do agree that equating the whole thing to framing it as Blizzard saying human rights are divisive is an oversimplification.
---
Hate to be that guy, but wouldn't that be cow shit?
---
Yeah, they aren't going to remove it, and they aren't going to ever take those steps.
---
You might as well ask Blizzard to make an giant effigy out of 100 dollars bills.
---
You can go to the new /r/HearthstoneTheGame where the mods won't allow any political trash
---
Just as an emergency, temporal solution
---
And they still punished the interviewers even though they couldn't really do anything better.
---
It's debatable, it could also read as  *"(divisive social) or political views"*. It's quite a stretch to spin it like "divise political" so better stick to what's actually written.
---
Holy shit you're gullible. And I'm not referring to this, just your post history. It's cute watching somebody genuinely believe that they banned him **AND** the casters because of some vague rules (yet didn't ban the Americans doing the exact same thing &amp; straight up calling for a boycott of Blizzard).

In any case, HK can't really survive by itself without China. They have no infrastructure to do so. It's a commercial city. What China is trying to do is slowly integrate the city into the mainland over 50 years because if they just change everything overnight in 2047, there's going to be problems.
---
HK really doesn't have a choice in the long run. They want to push for China to honor their deal with the British in the handover but fighting every little change but that's only going to make things for difficult for them down the track.
---
A statement that lies will never be accepted
---
Thanks for the correction.
---
While we’re on pet peeves, one of mine is when people argue against a point I didn’t make, like the claim that China wrote the statement.
---
it is divisive because human rights dont exist in china
---
or really anywhere the authoritarian left gets power
---
For a PR statement, this reads awkwardly. It is essentially making the point that Kibler’s statement pointed out (they don’t want people to use their broadcast to spread political views), in a much more roundabout way that is also trying to emphasize how they were trying to maintain their “core values”, and how it was not China causing the ban or that it was the Hong Kong statements specifically that prompted the harsh ban.
---
With how awkwardly the sentences read, I can totally buy into the theory that it’s someone with English as not their primary language who wrote this.
---
Honestly, if they want to go the route of ‘we punished Blitzchung like we would have any person using our platform to promote political views’, they need to have a standard punishment laid out that would get applied consistently, rather than the arbitrary punishments they are doing now.
---
Oh, makes sense, and yet I still haven't beat the tavern brawl yet

What a crock of shit.

Did you draft any human rights?
---
&gt;I think it's about time we move the discussion of this topic to more suitable locations,
---
This debacle has united the community in ways I have never seen before actually and created content and responses like never before on a topic that actually revolves around the Hearthstone community instead of the usual memes. Not sure what your idea of suitability is, but the response speaks for itself. Until hearthstone removes itself from the equation by utterly and irreverently undoing the harm they have caused (i.e. you miss the point if you think this is purely about Hong Kong or the punishment), then there is nothing to forgive or forget. 
---
Blizzard actively chose NOT to take the neutral middle ground to initiate this wide reaction. So vice-versa, do not expct the community to be satisfied with a neutral middle ground answer.
---
I mean... Saying that organ harvesting is wrong is also divisive in China... M but you know what? I'm comfortable with offending them if they truly support such measures.

Sometimes "let's think of everyone's fee fees" is the coward's way out.

Well it is better than the Pride and Accomplishments statement but we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here

When a company says they will defend the national dignity of a country, that shows you where their allegiances lie. To say now that it had nothing to do with China... they must think we're retards.
---
Them recalibrating their  doublestandards is Not enough. An American College Team demanded to boycott Blizz and free HK on blizzs official stream and got No Sanction, they didn't even get kicked Out of the tournament, blizz actively advertises the LBGTQ movement, however If a HK pro demanding freedom For HK blizz suddenly doesn't want to get invovled in politics. Blizz Just Tries to apease the Western audience by Promoring freedom while also following the Rules of silenceing Any hasadeur in China. All the Western audience demand is that they Chose. They cannot Claim to be a Brand who openly promotes freedom while Helping oppreasing the biggest peacefull freedomfight (i give you that it's Not 100% peacefull anymore but that Always Happens) of Our time. We have other big companies with way bigger biases like Nestlé trying to get asociated with saving the Planet etc.pp. but what they do better is that they Made it so we all Know but still don't Care. They scandalised it with Chinese blizz twittering, that they will Always Protest the Honor of China.
---
They didn't say "We want to stay neutral" because they needed to apease China after what Happens in Stream so they went a step to much and actively confirmed that they will actively Help China to censor.
---
This New Statement can simply Not be trusted. We're at a Point where anything below. "You're right, but we Need the Chinese Market more than the Western and we Accept that you leave us" or "You're right, we're sorry, we Accept him and the casters Back in Our Tournament even If that means WE get blacklisted in China."

The cashmere conflict has nothing to do with this even though it's easy, England legt colonial India, the Land got divided, basically dependent in which was the Major Religion in the Region. Nobody can have a Claim on cashmere, but due to the riches and it beeing "free" Land the Other Lands want it. Every Land trying to militarily occupy cashmere is the Bad Guy. Easy black and white. What makes it complicated is that cashmere itself is also divided in minoritys that all want to be Part of their respective religion. The Problem can't get solved, still it's black and white and easy. 
---
HK has Special rights due to a treaty with China that the Chinese gov wanted to Bypass with a New law. PPL demonstrated against it, Police Strike Them down. This don't shut down HK citizens but strengthend their Numbers. China can't give in because the audience is to big so they try to sit it Out AS they previously did. Then again the concrete political Situation in HK is completely irrelevant. The outrage of the HS Players is Blizzards bias.
---
They represent Blizzard in that market. Blizzard has decided to continue working with them, so they do not disagree with Netease's position and statement enough to do anything regarding their partnership.
---
I climaxed twice while reading it, fun all around
---
A 5 game suspension is basically the same as a 6 month suspension in Grandmasters because it basically guarantees your relegation.  It's just messier because it makes the numbers uneven and someone has to have a bye every week, which then makes it unfair on other players who don't get a bye.
---
Fuck you blizzard
---
It must be nice to be so sheltered and ignorant.
---
Yep.. I was on board the Blizz dissapointment train the first few days but redditors like you take this shit waaay too far
---
wtf? Not even going to apologize? Not even going to say it was their fault.
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out
---
At least when EA fuck with their customers they fuck with all of us an equal amount without any discrimination. Id rather a company be greedy than corrupt.
---
Yeah, this is something I'd like to see them clarify.  If they say "you can tweet about the Hong Kong protests all you want", that would be big.  But right now there is a cloud over everything, leading every player that needs GM to be extra-cautious.  Even support staff for non-Hearthstone esports teams are scared now (especially after the whole NBA thing).
---
If Blizzard wants to come out and say that it's OK to be political on your own time, that would be great.  Right now, there is only fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
---
 That statement was bullshit. You care about your bottom line instead of the players. There was no apology. Nothing.
---
can you remind me?
---
Imagine thinking that you need a corporation to "allow people to publicly say" anything

I dunno what business class told you that you need a signed permission slip from a company to speak, but you should get your money back.

Comparing ICE camps and guantanamo bay to China's concentration camps are completely disengenious which only shows that you are nothing but a China shill. 
---
Both are wrong but on totally different magnitudes. Hint: One have millions locked up for forced labor and organ harvestation. 
---
Hint 2: America will not ban you or send you to prison for condemning the ICE camps or the Guantanamo bay. Actually you are comdemning it right now here on an American website and most Americans would agree with you.
---
They posted the statement where it could not be downvoted. Clever.
---
Well, good that Blizzard tried. But I don't believe for a SECOND that Blizzard's connections and dealings in China didn't affect their decision making.
---
But one thing I agree with. They acted too quickly. They should've taken a few days, maybe a week to think of approarite methods. They should've remembered that the world is on the side of Hong Kong so severe punishments (like a ban and taking the prize money) would get a big and bad reaction from the community. More approarite would have been a warning and that such actions as what blitzchung did would result in more severe punishments in the future and explain why.
---
But, hindsights a bitch!

i guess reddit cant detect sarcasm hehe

Congratulations.

Happy to see a post related to the game. I hope the offended army leave this forum alone soon and we can back to normal.

Why does it matter? Blizzard says the issud is that its a political statement,not that its a radical political statement. Saying " climate change is bad,I hope we do something about it" or "Hitler was bad" are equally political statements but I doubt Blizzard would do the same type of punishment for that. Which they according to their statement should
---
It's just gamers finding another way to shoehorn in their general hate for lgbt people into an otherwise decent cause. Look forward to more spam along these lines making out that gay people, character, streamers, events, or anything else similar, is "political". Completely weakebs the original cause/focus (ie, hong kong) and makes them look like a pack of twats but they will still do it.
---
Basically the only things we would be mourning if we condemned the protestors' vandalism would be some concrete and some glass. Dunno about you but if that's the case I'm very in favor of letting them smash windows.
---
You're all such crybabies.
---
Yeah. More like why is this relevant to r/hearthstone. And who is that guy?

They ducked before he said anything. They knew what he was doing and as such equally deserve punishment for being in violation of the contract

DAY 4: THE KARMA WHORING ENSUES

Eh they can go fuck themselves anyway, bunch of greedy goddamn wankers.

Played WoW since BC, played Hearthstone from about a year ago, played Diablo 3 since launch on PS3, own all historic Blizzard games.
---
I sat through BS "balancing" patches in Wow, I sat through expansion after expansion where changes were made to dumb down all of their games and accepted that there was no amount of bitching that could bring change.
---
Frankly this response (and the timing of it) is so BS. Its an effort to keep their margins ahead of the will of their player base. Only this time its way more abvious than dumbing down a game to make it more accessible to all.
---
I think this is the problem, Blizzard can't openly support Hong Kong for fear of people lives, it sounds insane but it isn't.

Do you actually know what you’re talking about??? Do not make this stupid comparion. Do not make the point obscure. We are not idiots.

Oh come on! It was my turn to get karma for this today

It has to do with how the news cycle works and how people engage with the news. Masses of people are far less likely to engage with the news on Friday evenings, Saturday and Sunday, all for a large variety of reasons but most of which should be obvious.
---
Simple they don’t want there stocks to fall hence why they posted it so late on Friday too. The stock market closes. Pathetic company!
---
I'll carry on playing whatever games I enjoy playing. I'll also carry on believing facts over some idiot 14 years old being angry at Blizzard for completely manufactured reasons. 
---
Also you have 0 argument or comeback, so you went with the "Carry on being apologetic for Blizzard" because you know you're wrong.
---
Biggest pr stunt
---
The exact same thing happens in League. Happened to me, happened to dunkey. I ended up quitting because of it.
---
...As a tax write off.
---
Every time you talk about the topic of security or perceived security, you have to talk about freedom. Because security will always have to come at the expense of (personal) freedom. You being punished for killing someone else is a restriction of your theoretically existent freedom. And that's just one example - as the other poster already said, no topic is more political than freedom (unless you don't understand what the actual meaning of the word "political" is). You should really think this through.

To steal the post of /u/J780 in /r/Blizzard ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dgnw1a/blizzards_official_response_regarding_last/f3dmlvb/?context=3))
---
 This is the rule he violated.
---
&gt;Engaging  in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public  disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise  damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and  reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other  remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s  Website Terms.
---
Which directly contradicts this.
---
&gt;The  specific views expressed by blitzchung were NOT a factor in the  decision we made. I want to be clear: our relationships in China had no  influence on our decision.
---
As per the rules own wording:
---
&gt;Blizzard’s  sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or  group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image
---
According  to the rule, it is your view the content of what he said violates the  rule. The rule clearly states the content of what he said was the sole  reason he violated the rule.

Fuck blizzard  and fuck China

1. Do not admit any mistakes were made.
---
2. Apply your core values selectively, e.g. \*Every voice matters\* is just the community, pro-players do not matter (they rely on our goodwill, poor souls).
---
3. If you have to apologize to have punished someone, make sure it stays a collective punishment; otherwise punishing them is wasted. Also make sure the punishment is still overly harsh to deter other people trying the same.
---
4. Just hurl phrases, do not explain yourself. You never need to justify your actions.
---
Or "We're pretty okay with the status quo and don't want things to change".
---
What load of fucking garbage. Fuck blizzard, free Hong Kong.
---
"Hitler bad "
---
 Blizzard: Stop mentioning decisive social issues in stream! Many believe he was not and we are too interested in their money to make them feel not welcome here!
---
Wait, we were boycotting Borderlands 3? Why?
---
I was happy that someone else made the repost of my original post yesterday so that it wasn't about me getting this "karma". I wish a mod would make these threads so that no "karmas" would matter. Heck, I would gladly delete this karma system from these posts just to keep the main point in the topic itself. If a mod reads this, could you please repost this thread by yourself so that no karma would matter?
---
Outstanding move blizzard. Now re-enable the ability to delete accounts so we can end this song and dance already.
---
Must be a Chinese bot!!!1111
---
Fucking genius level reply
---
Homosexual content is banned in china, so this doesn't make the "Blizz make their decisions based on china" point, kinda the opposite.
---
The sales of borderlands 3 were not crippled. They set a series record
---
China isn’t current revenue, it’s growth. It’s 1.5 billion potential revenue streams that they can’t tap into unless they play by the rules. And the reality is that, as a publicly traded company, what matters to the market and investors is growth and not current or past success.
---
Chinese dog go back to weibo
---
Reddit tho
---
At this point it would have been better to stay silent.
---
KEKW ?
---
Hey Tequ, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
Why should I go to a small sub to talk about something this sub was created to talk about?
---
Plus side, Blizzard just gave  *blitzchung*  his money back and reduced the suspension to 6-months for him and the casters. The damage is done though and they obviously lied when they said China had nothing to do with their decision. At least it's something.
---
Freedom of speech applies to both sides. You can say whatever stupid thing you want and someone else can criticize however they wish, as long as nobody is banned.
---
Censorship is when you cannot make a statement in the first place.
---
It does require understanding. We have that understanding. It's $$$.
---
You're the one who's just sort of throwing up their hands declaring "we can't possibly know!" in the face of what seems the plainly obvious explanation that "Blizzard didn't want to risk the Chinese market".
---
Ok so i was just about to comment "is acceptance of people really a political opinion?" But i quickly realized that i could also ask "is supporting basic human rights a political opinion?" So yeah fuck off blizz
---
Tbh that is a good response, people just want to be outraged.
---
LGBTQ helps their wallets because most cis gendered folks are not willing to stop playing bizzard games and blizzard gets to appeal to the LGBTQ market.
---
You people get mad when they don’t release a statement and then get madder when do they release a statement.
---
Damned if you, damned if you don’t. Blizzard shouldn’t even engage, because it’s quite clear none of you will listen to reason.
---
Don’t engage this troll. They’ve been bootlicking for a China all night.
---
This is in Chinese timezone how can they have f**k it up meanwhile saying: "China have nothing to do with it" absolute bs.
---
... they do realize we aren't stupid right?  We have translations of their Mandarin-language statement, which as I recall was basically "WE LOVE CHINA KEEP GIVING US MONEY PLZ" 
---
But now they ask us to believe this had nothing to do with China.
---
Yeah...
---
Stabbing someone with an 8 inch knife and then pulling it back out 4 inches is not progress.
---
Seriously, do you actually stand by the position you put forward above? That's the logical conclusion of what you are arguing.
---
Nope, sorry...
---
Fuck you Blizzard :3
---
Obviously not because Blizzard is lying in this statement and currently has their mouth sewn to Pooh’s honey-shit spewing asshole.
---
It's about 10%, but growth potential is huge, especially with the new mobile titles
---
First of all supporting LGBTQ might not be that big of a deal in the US, but in many parts of the world these people are severely prosecuted, so it's not as easy of a stance to take as you think. Second of all it doesn't matter in the end because it's still an expression of a political view and in their own words : "the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament".
---
It put pressure on companies not to do appease China when dealing with them meaning China loses economical leverage(Blizzard will be one example).
---
China doesn't want to lose business partners either(see current trade war) meaning in the long run they cannot enforce something like  "Taiwan, China", "Hong Kong, China" and "Macau, China" in the long run.  Forcing China to accept the current constitution.
---
This means they won't be able to slowly assimiliate those countries and make it look like it was just a change of the constitution and the entire world already played along with their plan
---
If they want to take control over autonomous regions they need an annexation and that something the G7 won't take meaning China will be left to deal with Russia as strong businessparter alone and outsourcing moves to India instead of China. This hurts China's economy and creates civil unrest. China will likely execute everybody unknown participating and arrest those who are known.
---
This will tighten infraction on China even more. When the point is reached even soldiers families are suffering there will a coup d'état and a military regime will be established removing the current regime. The first step will be appeasement towards the West+Japan.
---
So basically enough pressure forces China to keep the Status-Quo which helps Hong-Kong or they create a cold war like scenario which destroys the current regime in the long run(this will last several decades) but this will remove the current regime and their families from power and the appeasement politics forces the new regime to liberate the annexed countries.
---
I remind you there was once something called Soviet Union. Eastern Europe is entirely free now.
---
False analogy. Here is correct analogy.
---
Olympics ban sportsman for using racial slurs for life. But after backlash they reduce the ban to a year or so.
---
Well, Donald Trump just streamed his rally on Twitch yesterday, so...
---
this is a bruh moment
---
The only way to test this is for someone to make a pro-China statement on ait and wait for Activision to shit their pants.
---
Try reading the rules sometime.
---
I ain't giving up man. Any time I think about forgetting about it I just think over Chinese police pepper-spraying my loved ones. Gets me right back in mood.
---
Thank you, that makes sense!
---
Keep the politics out of esports. It is as easy as that. When I open GN strean I only care about HS. If I wanted to hear politics, I would go to Twitter.
---
In official match, American Univ students did similar thing(holding Free HongKong,  Boycott Blizzard sign) and this video quickly cut away. But blizz didn’t ban them. Their decision is not rational, and this can be the answer of your question, I think.
---
Horrible apology, but at least its a step in the right direction, the drama will continue, and that will prompt them to have to make other statements before Blizzcon, or even during it, as it is more than likely gonna be flooded by protestors
---
Are you sure?
---
I was interested in bying some Starcraft merch I've seen on stream, but I have never seen it in the Blizz shop, until next big sale with marketing push happened.
---
Not good enough, at all.
---
You say you want to hear how a person at the top of their craft is feeling.
---
I'm feeling like you dont like free speech.
---
See the problem? No, you probably don't.
---
It's not about it being divisive so much as it being definitely a social view, which they said they don't take sides on.
---
The cognitive dissonance is deafening.
---
Who will win, EA or Blizzard. Which post will rein supreme as the most downvoted post on reddit.
---
Fucking disgusting. Do they think we are fucking retarded?
---
Exactly. In the same sense we can point them towards /r/hongkong
---
Yes, and if someone is told that they are not welcome on a public forum to express their opinion, how are they supposed to make their statement?
---
Not to mention the personal insults because somebody has a different opinion.
---
King Kong lives! We did it everyone, let freedom ring.
---
\&gt;2 month old acct
---
\&gt;one of the 1% of accounts online defending Blizz
---
\&gt;completely irrational, but tells everyone else they're wrong
---
Yeah i'll take chinese or blizzard (same thing I guess?) shill acct for 500 plz
---
I 33e
---
I want western companies to maintain western values including basic fucking freedoms. Do I want them to support HK? No. I want them actually make decisions without the influence of China. If you believe the decisions blizzard makes is not because of politics you're a fucking idiot. 
---
They didn't punish AU at all.
---
The mei statue is removed from the blizzard official store after mei was turned into a pro HK symbol. You honestly think that wasn't to appease china?
---
So what is the difference? The nationality of the person protesting?
---
I bolded one part of the post for a reason. English isnt my first language so it's not super easy coming up with good, understandable analogies
---
Did they ever placed sold-out tag?
---
IRC with SC2 merch, it just vanished after like a month.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy
---
I hope you don't think he's talking about the Democratic party..
---
They're a corporation right and wrong mean nothing to them. All they see are marketing stats, popularity charts, and money
---
So mate what are your feelings on this protest?
---
Would you want to have suppressed this one so you could avoid seeing something you don't like?
---
&gt;The 1936 Berlin Games forced American athletes to decide how best to object to Adolf Hitler’s Aryan agenda. Harvard track star Milton Green, fencer Albert Wolff of France and basketball players from Long Island University chose not to participate in protest of the virulent anti-Semitism in Germany
---
You literally quoted that he played fair during the ganes but not post-game content lmao
---
What? You’re not making sense at all, but I’ll try my best here. You think that the punishment being so harsh, is because Blizzard for some reason succumb to the Chinese government? 
---
So to be clear, the level of punishment for a rule they self made long before Hong Kong riot, tells you that Blizzard is a chinese shill? 
---
This is, at the very best baseless speculation. If you whole argument is based on that, you’re too emotional to think clearly.
---
It is not shady, it is just "appealing to a different audiance".
---
"Just business" where you have all the shades of grey
---
They wouldn't listen to that, instead we move away
---
Very thorough point, topping it of with an insult.
---
TAIWAN NUMBER ONE!!
---
Oh wow opposing a totalitarian genocidal communist surveillance state is just sooooo divisive.
---
Edit. Perhaps it is time for the protests to go line up along the CEO route to work. Maybe then they will understand.
---
Didn’t they issue a statement apologizing to China and saying they will work to protect China’s reputation.
---
Their stock dropped for a whole 4 days and it's right back to where it was. Investors dgaf here.
---
This comment is so true. I laugh so hard when they act like canceling their subscriptions is gonna cause a regime change. They want to play revolutionary from the safety of their ProGamer2019 Chair lmao
---
Do you think your biggest problem would be slacktivism on twitch if you were born in North Korea? What the fuck kind of stupid statement is that
---
so is the post game not part of the tournament?
---
This is a strategy of appeasement but not apology or fixing a mistake. It is meant to try and get people to not be upset *as much* while trying to placate everyone. Blizzard, it almost never works (as you've probably read).
---
So maybe try this instead:
---
1. Aplogize for what happened and not with a corporate speak "we acted to soon". Be specific. This is something we all learned as children--if you punch someone on the playground, you don't say sorry for acting hastily. You say sorry for punching. Maybe talk about the complexity of being a corporation in a political world while also honoring players' rights of expression in a globalized, social world, and how you don't always get things right.
---
2. Identify what caused you to make the mistake. If you punched that kid on the playground, was it because you didn't want to share, or lost your temper, or didn't have the coping skills to deal with that anger? In this case, maybe you should revisit your policies and how you inform players of the policy and how you discipline them. Perhaps a new strategy of player expression is needed in the world we live in where players are *more than* employees.
---
3. Choose now what you will do different next time. Again, be specific. When you punched a kid on the playground, you might say that you will learn coping strategies, tell a teacher instead of hitting, or find another avenue of expressing displeasure. In this case, you might have to get creative. Instead of having players being punished for expressing themselves, why not create a secondary prize fund for tournaments where players can choose a non-profit of their choice that blizzard will donate to? Create that win-win that will allow players to express themselves on the international stage.
---
4. Set up accountability for the implementation of your choices for the future. Create a team of players, employees, and community members who will oversee the changes you want to make. Keep them on as an advisory board when making future decisions, and don't be afraid to listen to them and implement their ideas when it might cost you a bit financially. When you have a community of *all* your shareholders helping to make difficult decisions, good things will happen in difficult situations.
---
Excellent story. This statement was written by a total coward.
---
&gt;With regard to the casters, remember their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament. That didn’t happen here, and we are setting their suspension to six months as well.
---
Why were the casters banned at all? This wasn't their fault in the slightest. It's like blaming Mike Myers or the camera man when Kanye says W is a racist and hates black people.
---
我不喜歡中國
---
Are you stupid or what?
---
Haha ok
---
 ChInA iS nOt CoMmUnIsT
---
我很不喜歡中國
---
I know, but there isn't a chance they would move, so instead we populate this new sub at least temporarily till this situation dies down.
---
This is very similar to what the nba did. They think we're dumb
---
Seems like you're the minority here so.. lets pull a China and make you go away
---
They downvote because truth hurts. I laugh so hard when they act like canceling their subscriptions is gonna cause a regime change and this temporary outrage will die by next week. They want to play revolutionary from the safety of their ProGamer2019 Chair lmao
---
I have some sympathy with your post, but then i turn to Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Company.
---
They were just a company that helped people on their journey.   They just wanted to deliver people to where they wanted to go. Surely it was in everyone's interest that they are and remain a non-political organization. 
---
No ?
---
I don't mind reasonable attempts to keep things civil, friendly and respectful.  This isn't that.   I do mind the attempting to crush dissent.
---
Neglible.
---
I rly don't understand you guys. The punishment being too harsh was the only valid criticism here. Why do you expect them to get active in politics by providing a platform? They are a videogame company.
---
Didn't they come out and admit that the mobile Diablo game they're making was specifically for the Chinese people after all the backlash about the next Diablo game being a shitty mobile app to milk idiots of their money?
---
Pretty blatant lie imho. No influence what so ever? They really do think we're all idiots don't they...
---
&gt;	how are they supposed to make their statement?
---
Just post a statement. Nobody can stop him unless he's banned.
---
Personal insults are rude, but that's also a part of free speech. You are free to call him out on this front, nobody stops you.
---
short answer, yes
---
long answer, yes. do not trust what they have said there are endless inconsistencies within their apologies and they honestly have not fixed their situation.
---
Does anybody else feel like this statement is kinda worded weird? Like, not written by a native English speaker? I don’t want to sound like a paranoid conspiracy theorist but it just reads sort of strange.
---
The hero Hong Kong needs
---
It's one and the same, boyo.
---
I know you're just a troll but please tell me how China meets the definition of communism:
---
communism
---
/ˈkɒmjʊnɪz(ə)m/
---
noun
---
a theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs.
---
Yes, Thijs would rule North Korea if he was born there.
---
&gt; equal rights only has one right answer
---
Equal rights are a social construct. There is no such thing.
---
1) Gay marriage is cultural appropriation; cis-gendered community invented marriage. Gay marriage doesn't exist because marriage is more than casual sex, it's the building block of society. creating a community, raising kids, being sustainable intergenerically. Gay people cannot do this so for them to claim they are "married" is devaluing marriage and it confuses the straight community with regards to what is marriage. 
---
2) all civil rights are just a redistribution of negative rights from group x as positive rights to group y. There is no such thing as creating rights. You are simply taking away the rights of 1 group and giving to another. e.g. desegregation (open borders 1.0) took away the right of white people to live in neighborhoods with people like them and gave the black community the ability to force diversity on whites which then resulted in white flight. Likewise open borders between America and the rest of world takes away the right of Americans (mostly white people) to live with people like them, same thing. You are denying group white in this case the right to live WITHOUT diversity and giving another group (mexicans, muslims, blacks, asians) the right to force diversity on whites. Civil rights always hurt "one" group in order to "help" another group.
---
Basically the post is about hypocrisy with them coming out taking a stand that they should not use official channels about politics, but they do it.
---
So it becomes "It is okay if we do it, it is not okay that you do it" that ironically is just fueling the hong kong case since that is one of the main issues with china vs hong kong.
---
A lot of good points there but let's do a thought experiment where Blizzard is a Chinese company and the exact same events unfolded.  Would Americans boycotting Chinese Blizzard fall under the same treatment?  I assume politicians and mainstream media would not hesitate to speak out on this topic.
---
But I don't have the link. Why not just check hot on the same subreddit you are on? It's everywhere.
---
But China is doing that, they think globally, think they lead responsibly, and everyone that supports them has a voice that matters.
---
Ahh, Sorry thought we had moved on from activisionblizzard for some reason
---
You have zero argument here. If they allowed other political views, s i.e. «Sanders for president», then you this would be outrageous. However, they don’t. There are no other political views that has been allowed at any piint in Hearthstones 5 year history. 
---
AU team should be punished as well, and it might be coming. Given the current situation, they might want to think it through before they do anything. Like they said - they were too quick with Blitzchung.
---
Reading comprehension nowadays seems to be lacking
---
Considering some countries criminalize LGBT and some don't, it's a pretty divisive issue
---
Girls can't resist those upvotes
---
"Also includes pre and post-match conduct."
---
Damn dude this is a real bad attempt at quote-mining.
---
r/engrish is leaking
---
Yup, even well educated people sometimes write poorly
---
&gt; One of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player,  everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious  beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games. 
---
Clearly they didn't want people who support Hong Kong to feel welcome.
---
Michael Jackson
---
Summary : full of contradiction,we think that you are all idiot, we are still against freedom of speech, not all voice matter,we try to convince you that we are not the little slave of Chinese government but in reality we still lick Winnie the Pooh balls.....Continue to dig Blizzard you will soon find Bedrock
---
In the sense that they are expression that people in a free society can make, yes they're equivalent. If you believe otherwise, you're saying that businesses have no right to their *own* freedom of expression.

You know Blizzard has done the same thing you see countless people on reddit do.
---
Reddit mods clean out and remove comments they dont think are necesarry to have on their subreddit. This has included political stances on both sides. 
---
My comment will be downvoted because people dont like what I am saying and want it to be hidden at the bottom where few people actually read it. Thats limiting my right of free speech. 
---
People attack others for saying anything political all the time, we live in a world where people are afraid to state their opinions because other people may disagree with them.
---
Blizzard have done the exact same. But because of context everyone is gone over their heads. 
---
Blizz did screw up, but thsi outrage is a cycle of self hypocrisy.
---
Yeah. From what i've seen ignorant people tend to be the vocal majority in most "big" communities
---
If you are not a platform for **social** views, you pretty much can’t say anything beyond the scope of the game. Can’t talk about people who might be suffering after a hurricane, no “happy holidays”, no Halloween, no 4th of July (might offend the English!) or any other independence day; cannot show in any shape or form any support for any group whatsoever (LGBT, countries, sports clubs, religious organisations, demographic groups, etc.)
---
And yet of course we know this isn’t the case. Which just proves that these blanket statements are just a justification to censor at will. 
---
Happy 4th of July? Sure! Happy Hong Kong day? No.
---
RemindMe 13 days
---
See you soon.
---
&gt; 
---
The statue is not good. Defend China.
---
I mean, they handled the situation very poorly and far too quickly. But, I do agree with the END of the statement and that part ONLY.
---
Politics do not belong in sports. 
---
I tuned in to watch Hearthstone. I tuned in to watch the NBA Championship/The Super Bowl. I just want to watch that. I get enough politics every single day. This is supposed to be my escape from that. Something ENJOYABLE where I don’t have to hear about the fuckers running the show for ONE SECOND. 
---
Please, in your post-match interviews, tell us how much this means to you. How long have you been playing? You practice that much?? You deserve this man. Good for you. 
---
DO NOT tell me your viewpoint on current topics. Most likely, my views are the same and we can all fight the power in 20 minutes. Right now, enjoy the bright lights. Grab some confetti. This is your greatest moment. Smile!
---
Just don’t bring up the bummer of a world we live in. Let us, your competitors, and most importantly, let YOURSELF have one moment of pure joy. Please. You deserve it.
---
Well, how (in what words) should they apologize for ultimate satisfaction?
---
&gt;If you don't hate China and Blizzard with all your heart, apparently you're a communist Chinese
---
Well, if you feel like there's nothing to hate about China's and Blizzard's behaviour, this is entirely up to you. There is freedom of speech after all... at least for now. You know, there are places that you could be banned anf persecuted for that.
---
Have fun facing the innkeeper
---
Bruh, I'm disappointed from you. I've been a follower for the past 3-4 years, and you perma banned me from your chat for calling you out, that you said people have to be subscribed to you to get the free Little Legends from Twitch Prime. You're as money hungry as they are.
---
Also, the quote was "...not a platform for divisive political *or social* views."
---
Whether we like it or not, the level of LGBT support in these games is definitely a divisive social view.
---
While this meme is good, I will have to report it. Memes are not allowed here
---
Not to disagree with you, but a wiser stance is probably "be skeptical of anything you see"
---
Possibly because he claims to be an English major, but does not know how to use punctuation.

That was well written and addressed all concerns in my opinion 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
A shining example of totalitarian way of thinking. Rainbow ideology at its best :) Ban different views, then dehumanise those who have these views as "brainless and heartless". What usually comes next, as history tells, is extermination of  non-humans. Is it on rainbow agenda next after adoption of children?
---
I can't give you any statement but the caster did confirm on stream.
---
lol
---
At least I haven't played a control warrior since Doom in the Tomb, so that's something
---
If you have a platform and don’t use it to help make the world a better place then you are wasting it. This man took an opportunity to bring attention to a place suffering from human rights violations that is what a good person does.

I'll do it for you:

Fuck Human Rights. Fuck Freedom.

I hope it helps

You know what else isn’t working? Your retarded little so-called protests that honestly do jack shit other than karma whoring and clogging up this sub
---
I hope this informs all of your decision making. This is the most half assed response i've ever seen. His specific statement didn't influence your decision given your ties to China? J Allen are you even believing this as you type it?
---
We've already seen from the NBA that organizations with deep ties like Blizz get communications from CCP on issues like this. To say that they didn't at least expect a response from them on this, and that that influenced their decision, seems completely absurd. This reads like the United Fruit Company trying to tell us that the presence of bananas in a given South American country didn't influence their decision to dismantle local politics. Absolutely silly Blizz, people can read through the line on stuff like this and I pray that you all receive precisely what you deserve for bending over to a regime that wants to murder millions and harvests organs from innocents.
---
You know, I've seen comments like this a lot in the last couple of days. Would you be so kind as to tell me what details are getting overlooked? Is it about the player actually breaking the rules? AFAIK that was discussed a lot and I suppose that since the rule itself is rather unclear in itself, it's up to the individual how to feel about that. Is it about the statement being from Netease? That was also mentioned a lot as far I'm aware. The account deletion stuff? I believe that issue was also discussed I think. Is there more that I don't know and that gets down voted to oblivion? If yes, then please back up your statement and point me towards it. I'm always happy to broaden my horizon on issues I'm exposed to :)
---
gotcha, very interesting!
---
Removing the Mei figure, "protecting the dignity of the country," not posting updates on the Chinese site, and posting on dead hours all point to Blizzard trying to pander to CN.
---
In about 2 weeks* this will wash over like epstein and amazon burning lol.
---
I think He's more drawing attention to the other causes blizzard would have sided against if China asked, like all these: https://www.google.com/amp/s/theundefeated.com/features/athletes-and-activism-the-long-defiant-history-of-sports-protests/amp/
---
Sorry if he did offend and I'd love to think that anti-pride nobs would find little love or shelter amoung the people here.
---
Tldr I want blizzard to go to politics
---
You gotta understand that not everyone wants to be a part of a protest. This is the Hearthstone subreddit. A lot of people here just want to get updates about the game they play. It doesn’t make people cowards to not want to participate in your protest. Everyone has their own free will.
---
Blitzchung just confirmed on stream that he can still play GM in 2020 if he wants to.
---
I don't like what you're implying here. Whether or not it was the smartest financial decision, including all the diversity that they did in OW has caused tangible good for hundreds of thousands of people around the world. We don't require that company's make financial sacrifices to include us, good representation for any reason is a step in the right direction. We don't need to "fall for it".

Welcome to the protest We stand with Hong Kong

This whole thing is a joke lmao

How old are you btw
---
Erasing the field IS possible. You simply enforce your rules. Where I worl we have a completely apolitical enviroment and it works wonders. Is there causes that are so important I want to scream it out to every person I meet at work? Sure. But we don’t. 
---
Look at the World Cup in soccer. It’s a huuuge event, and for the most part they’ve actually managed to stat nom political during the gamesl (grtting hard in 2022 but). If fuckign FIFA can do it then surely Blizzard can do it.
---
Oh god, we’ve hit the white genocide level of delusion with the comments.
---
&gt;Saying 'We're all against Pedophiles', would offend Pedophiles.
---
That wouldn't make it ok for you going into the random school to scream "We're against Pedophiles" either.
---
Also, had he say "We're against negroes black people" you would be screeching endlessly and vouching for Blizzard to lynch him.
---
Sure. Ignore the fact that this is as official a statement as Blizzard will make in China and that Blizzard has not distanced itself from this statement at all. Nothing to see here.
---
Send it to them instead of littering here with more offtopic spam
---
Being gay isn't a political view idiot
---
Part of me wishes TotalBiscuit were around so he could rip blizzard apart for this.
---
The American government is at fault for the Turkey invasion. American’s can go out and protest this anywhere even in the nation’s capital. Hong Kong is in a militarized police state and in China in general their citizens can be easily jailed for any kind of political dissent even just protest.

Nice post about nothing mate. Being against us here proves you would have been on the wrong side then. I know ethics is a hard class for children but you should look into it.

Name on time that Blizzard did your Hypothetical... zero... number of times a Gamer has said something Racist... less than zero... the difference is that didn't effect their bottom line...
---
What’s with all the blizzard and corporate apologists being out in full force. Chinese influence in western media was shown in full display, the effects it had on our society, but muh developers. Why is it that people like to have it both ways. Companies don’t care about us but we’re supposed to have empathy for them? It’s a machine and everyone there is a cog.
---
It was under the name Blizzard. They gave that control away willingly, and haven't visibly resisted that kind of usage of their name in official media.

I don't care who's at fault. Should we boycott or not?
---
insult, no argument.
---
Indeed, case in continually perpetuating point.
---
What do you call it when Blizzard openly supports LGBT/ Diversity/etc. causes? Are those not in the same realm as this? Are they not being political when its convenient for them to make money?
---
You ask what we want.  Easy.  Don't lie. Don't call yourselves a champion of "every voice matters" when you stand for nothing else but cash.
---
Start with admitting the decision was based on profitability, admit that the fear of being cut out of China was real and then work from there.
---
Oh, I didn't know that. Now a lot more makes sense. Like why Fanta seems to be way more popular in EU than US
---
it reads more to me as "sorry you got so offended" as opposed to "sorry for supporting a genocidal regime"
---
Umm no.
---
A CEO blatantly lying to our faces would probably wind them up in prison because that would potentially affect the stock market, and I don’t think the SEC would be too happy about that.
---
CEO’s are paid so much because they’re smart as fuck, experienced as hell, are cutthroat businessmen, and know how to navigate the ship, that is the company they work for, through shit storms.
---
Lawyers, marketing, sales, etc; are all involved in the process so it’s not a one man decision.
---
Dozens of hours are spent among various individuals, if not teams, to perfect the statements that are made to the public so the company does not seem complicit in any crime or wrongdoing.
---
Oh, in case that you don't know, Germany supported Hitler in WW2.

This is coming from a guy who claims to be an English major while using terrible grammar/punctuation (Does not use any capitalization in his tweets, tons of run on sentences, uses shorthand such as “ppl” , which most English majors hate).
---
Maybe its time China sees it from our perspective rather than us always trying to sympathise with them?

No I do not and no I wont. Did you read the article i posted? People are free to sit out and make the morally bankrupt choice but that does not give them the right to not face criticism.

Oh I'm boycotting China entirely over this shit.
---
I'm good with this answer. I support HK, it's a beautiful city and I would like to return someday, this whole issue has stirred up a LOT of attention to what is going in in HK. So Blitzchung has succeeded in helping the cause. He took a risk by breaking the rules, he is paying a penalty. I think by giving his prizes back Blizzard is backing him while still punishing his rule infraction with the 6 month ban.

Unless those views fit in with a narrative that will make us more money.

NetEase wrote it using a Blizzard account on its face. If Blizzard doesn’t agree with that statement, they can disavow it. Easy solution. Until then, that statement represents Blizzard’s view.

Or they sold out of the specific statue...  Like use your brains, does it make sense to ban one rendition of a character, but not the products with the same character?  You all have clinged onto her as a symbol and as such promoted her more than any other overwatch character if you attempt to order 10000 of any of the other statues you only add weird numbers of them to your cart, indicating (as anyone who even remotely understands how warehouses work would know) that the statues have a limited number that have already been manufacturered and the store doesn't allow backorders.

---
&gt;That's a lot like gambling.
---
But it's not actually gambling, it's buying a product with the hope that it will contain something you want, but the knowledge that you might get something you don't. You're still always guaranteed to get a product in exchange for your money. That is not gambling.
---
Some people say oppress everyone who isn't me, some people only oppress that person, both sides are oppresses, we better not take sides. /s
---
They've had plenty of political statements before, but this one is not allowed. And why? Because China.
---
Prizing is the official term they use in [the Grandmasters rulebook](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/qi/QIJ8ZBM27S141553902812951.pdf), so I would say this is another example of the statement skewing to overly-official.
---
Is anyone using their brains a shill to you? You selling your stock actually helps out other investors try using your brain before you talk.
---
No they fucking aren't. They're both corporations that can ban you from using their platforms for speaking. The human rights act is a set of British anti-discrimination laws applied to public organizations (i.e. the government) in 1998, not 1988, and doesn't force private companies to allow "free speech" as defined by the constitution. You cant breech a contract, as blitzchung did, and yell about it being a human rights violation to get out of it.
---
Wow subscribers are ants, if a few unsub, it will be nothing for blizzard, 
---
what i am wondering—let’s say blizzard came out and said we agree liberate Hong Kong, then what happens?
---
Blizzard games are banned in China, maybe it would cause more of an uproar in the protests or something. But now for the people who work shitty jobs slaving away, they can’t even look forward to coming home to their favorite game?
---
I’m wondering if this is more of a pick your fight and when to fight thing.

The right to not be disappeared by the Chinese government to an organ removal facility. The protests started when Pooh Bear tried to force through a new law in HK that would allow China to grab any HK citizen any disappear tham for any reason.

I will forget this post within the next 10-15 minutes.
---
Wish I hadn't read this because now I can't get rid of this stench of bullshit.
---
That statement is so full of shit, it's ridiculous.  The decision was absolutely made around the content of the statement.  When the central premise of your explanation is a lie, the rest isn't worth reading.
---
This should be on a separate thread imo. This is important.

&gt;"First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season." -MLK
---
&gt; Anyone who does see HK as being under China right now (even if it’s inaccurate)
---
Then what are they, to be accurate. If they are a still a province of Britain why is Britain not stepping in and assisting them with China's encroachment? Remember Hong Kong has never been an independent state. China jumping the gun halfway is encroachment, but this would've happened in the next few decades anyway.
---
Well, I would probably stop lying about China not influencing their decision for suspending Blitzchung, considering Blizzard's China side saying they were defending ["the pride of China".](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1181925730877345793) That would be a start. But [YongYea covers all the milarky from Blizzard's press release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMlqJ7Bd8HM) better than I could, so yeah, Step 1 would be stop lying. Let's work our way up, instead of letting Blizzard dig the hole they have further down and claim "this is an improvement" that they aren't being so cruel.
---
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER E.V.I.L. OR EXPLORERS, WE ALL NEED TO FIGHT THE FINAL PLAGUE!
---
Well, if it doesn't bother you, that your beloved franchise is directly supporting acts like aforementioned, that's only your choice. Ivolvement with China is one thing but serving their demands, is on whole another level.
---
Lol esports.
---
I'm not saying that out of a defense of corporations, I'm saying that out of a 'fuck capitalism' place.
---

---
I just thought I'd leave it here for anyone else curious
---
Lmao it was posted from Chinese time zone, same with the tweet.
---
They've shown before that they are fine with "political statements" on their streams.  Now that the target of these political statements is China they are brutally enforcing the "no politics" stance.  Then had the nerve to say that someone speaking up for basic human rights has a **divisive** viewpoint.  Blizzard can do whatever they want with their company.  We can also do whatever we want in response to their actions.
---
Alright friend, you do you but I have a question:
---
What risk are you doing that you can make as bold as "Liberty or Death"?
---
Mods should really make some megathread for fans of politic on /r/heartstone.
---
Where has Blizzard explicitly said this?
---
I'm literally crying... I can't believe it. We did it Reddit!
---
Blizzard should've never merged with Activision, it was the psuedo death of one of the great game developers :c
---
Ah. The classic, if we can't have this, we shouldn't have that similar thing either argument. 
---
The narrative of a lot of people going with this isn't "Blizzard is being hypocritical and should treat the situation at Hong Kong and the freedom of expressing opinions the same way it has been doing this"
---
and instead it has malicious intent on the lgbt and we all know it.
---
Lol ok, guess it couldnt hurt.
---
"Prizing" is used in the official Grandmasters rulebook.
---
a lot of it looks like it's mixed in with some native english speaking. all of it was definitely not written by J. Allen Brack. i wouldn't be surprised if he didn't type any of this out himself. i mean just take a look at this line
---
&gt;We now believe he should receive his prizing. 
---
who the fuck talks like that? i also can't remember the last time i heard someone say "prizing" who wasn't a foreigner.
---
And it won’t because companies have done miles and miles worse and increased in profits. The internet will one day realize that the over whelming majority don’t give a shit what a company does all they care is what they make and if they want it. Blizzard makes video games people like so people will play them. Most people don’t need to virtues signal their moral anti China high ground while going around and supporting far more pro China companies.
---
If you want to fix these sort of problems you go after the government not the cooperations. Any cooperation that backs out will be replaced by another because welcome to how the world works.
---
That's a lot of effort!
---
Ya good luck with that. One word for you...
---
EA
---
Not to mention, Chinese punctuation has wider spacing. 
---
Chinese:  。。。
---
English:  ...
---
Those are different things though. The protests in Hong Kong are not the actions of a monolithic majority. There are people in HK that believe the protests are violent and disagree with them, or agree with the thrust of the protests but not the way they've devolved. Some protestors even want the return of colonial-era British rule, a possibility which is widely unpopular in HK. 
---
You associate Blitzchung's statement with a call for democracy, but his statement ties into a much more complex and nuanced political landscape than just that; the idea that support for a revolution in HK is equivalent to a milquetoast statement like "people of all races deserve equal treatment" is imo a bit of a false equivalence.
---
First non-hong kong post i've seen in the last 72 hours lmao
---
Where has blizzard said that the views of NetEase are the same as Blizzard's?
---
It’s telling that you think the only reason people are participating in this is for an abstract ‘win’. It sends a message to board members, shareholders, and other companies that there will be financial backlash for behaving like an arm of authoritarians. It creates more avenues for HK to spread awareness. It’s actually really significant how we respond to this specific moment, when multiple US companies are being put in a similar bind. 
---
Also, I know everyone’s talking about blizzard, but I think most know it’s really EA. I personally have been considering this an EA boycott from the beginning.
---
Married conservative women are the best lays because they always say shit like "I feel like I'm alive for the first time in years" and sexy shit like that.

No one from the original company that was blizzard is there anymore. It wouldn't make a difference. Blizzard is Activision. There is no more blizzard like we used to know.
---
This
---
Fuck that. I'm done with Blizzard.
---
Blizzard is from US
---
US is in a trade war with China
---
I made a joke along the lines of this to my friends a while back.
---
Absolutely. It's just not like "the message came from China because it says Oct 12 but it's still Oct 11 where I am reading it, but it's tomorrow already in China!"
---
There's enough to legitimately point fingers at here, let's not give credit to tinfoil hat memes that detract from the real shit.
---
Letting an OWL team show respect to a social issue that is the Parkland Shooting? It's okay, we get good PR for it. Hong Kong? China's PR will rip us to shreds, we gotta act fast!
---
I'm taking a large profit, donating to the cause, and opening a short position.  Can you not read?  Do you even know how options trading works?

#HKstrong
---
How about not thinking globally and thinking about the country that made you what you are and where you are based out of, and the principles we founded our country on, like freedom of speech and not conforming to a communist country just because you want to make a few extra dollars
---
Sincerely,
---
The fans that bought all your games for 15 years
---
Which is the same as telling China to fuck off, and get banned in the Largest Country on the planet. It's not just greed for money.
---
POS companies will virtual signal when it benefits them the most
---
It went great thanks for asking. Enjoy prepping for thanksgiving a solid month early.
---
What a bunch of crock. They cut streams over this shit. Ply nice; play fair huh. So what about when I say I think somebody is cheating in chat then I get permabanned because I was killed in a suspect way? Because number of reports totally indicated that I was doing something wrong, instead of your shitty community defending cheaters with no consequences. (Which by the way, YOU are fostering the toxicity when you make a game that’s fun and the fuck with the formula after 6 months) Or how about your ever evolving tweaks and disbalancing of all your games, emphasizing bullshit mechanics? Or how about mismanaging every single online game being neutered after launch?
---
Fuck your blizzard. I’m done.
---
&gt; If the natural right to being LGBT isn't political, then the natural right of freedom of expression and self determination isn't either.
---
Exactly!
---
Thank you :)

/u/LpwjqIETvewop3Wykzad gives a [good breakdown in his comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dgnsy2/blizzards_statement_about_blitzchung_incident/f3efyqv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) about releasing something after 5pm on Fridays.
---
My post about social media and press release engagements from another commenter who asked a similar question: 
---
&gt;There are clear metrics for when you should be posting things for [engagement](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/) in [social media](https://blog.hootsuite.com/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram/) and for [releasing](https://conversion-hub.com/blog/press-releases/best-time-day-send-press-release-best-results/) [press releases](https://www.shiftcomm.com/blog/the-worst-times-and-days-for-press-releases/) to maximize engagement. I'm bringing these statistics up as they are the closest to representing the intent of releasing this statement, which I assume, is so that people will engage with it and news outlets will report on it. Regardless, I believe social media is relevant as it was broadcast through the Blizzard Twitter (and I'm assuming on the other Offical Blizzard social media outlets too).  
---
&gt;It's generally accepted that when posting on Fridays after 5pm, there'll be lower engagement on social media and news outlets are less likely to report on it in a timely manner as employees will have gone home for the weekend and as people are winding down for the weekend.  
---
&gt;While I know that this was an anticipated statement, it doesn't change the fact that the corporate PR and Marketing teams at Blizzard will know this and might've relied on this to not generate as much of a response to their statement.
---
I don't know if there are metrics for Reddit but given that it was an anticipated statement, I think Reddit would've been all over this regardless of when it was released. So maybe there's no good time for Reddit because anytime is okay for Reddit?
---
Cards are staying until “the next major update” which I’d guess means the next expansion.
---
Given the quote, I think it's just the execs.
---
No trying to defend Blizzard, but supporting an inclusive environment is not political in any way. Supporting Pride is not political any more than supporting drinking water is.
---
Deeper and Deeper they go...  they should just announce their loyalty to china and move on.
---
They are not coming back from this.
---
That blizzard gave the authority to represent them in china. Their words are blizzard's words. I don't see how that changes anything
---
I'm sure they will ban the next guy who says something about climate change, anti racism or pro LGBT rights, because you know, it has nothing to do with gaming and they want to keep out any politics.
---
Can someone eli5 why they fired/suspended the casters?
---
Sorry, the only benefit is see to these online protests is to bring the subject to light...
---
I don't see it accomplishing much other than hurting a game company.
---
Why would China care if a bunch of gamers delete their accounts?
---
Do you really think Blizzard has any sort of way to make China do anything?
---
You're spending money on the chance that you're gaining way more than you spent. It's gambling. It will always be gambling.
---
Cosmetic bloat. Not necessarily a bad thing but can be completely offputting. 
---
Quit LoL for 2 years, come back and there are so many new skins that I had no idea who was who. I died. A lot.
---
I went back and read the full statement because of your post. Pretty telling what’s not there.
---
&gt;It is extremely important to us to protect these channels and the purpose they serve: —to bring the world together through epic entertainment, celebrate our players, and build diverse and inclusive communities.—**We too love money more than freedom and democracy**
---
I'll believe it once they admit that they were influenced by china
---
Oh! Thanks for the advice:-)
---
Epic is what, 40% owned by Tencent? He can easily piss something off and then lose almost half his companies value if they break away.
---
Blizzard should have at least pulled Chinas tit out of their mouth while giving this statement. 6 month ban is still too long and they didn’t even apologize. This just makes me more mad. They can go fuck themselves
---
*Damage control*
---
And they ONLY did this because of the backlash and its barely anything. Wtf Blizzard/Activision Blizzard. At the very least, he gets his prize money. What a BS statement.
---
Free Hong Kong!
---
Even though the ban was shortened, I think he meant no ban at all, so I don’t think he’ll come back.
---
How so? All my third paragraph is saying is that the statement "free Hong Kong..." is divisive by definition. LGBT issues are divisive too for the same reason -- that world-wide, many people disagree with the position Blizzard has espoused in the past. You can point out Blizzard's hypocrisy there, though it's fair to draw a line between their own advocacy and that of a random grand master advocating on their platform. But I'm not sure how any of that is relevant to what I was talking about.
---
Globalism = Colonialism
---
Are you? Nothing they said was incorrect. I guess the boot was just looking too tasty and you couldn't wait to lick it.
---
Cute. Is there a nude version?
---
That would be so poetic
---
Lawyers were definitely not involved
---
May not be easy to just up and leave your job like that, and noble as it may be, no company is going to hire you for a reason like this. However, I do agree with your sentiment
---
And that was why the apology was lacking. All of it was PR speech that didn't really address the issue on the head
---
You haven't seen the wall of bootlickers then.
---
Moderators are so bad it's killing me. How can you let bunch of braindead people to turn 1 million followers gaming subreddit into trash can. I thought at least mods will kick them out after blizz statement was published but they continue to do nothing. So I guess every keyboard war from now on will be on r/hearthstone field because why not.
---
A couple grand.
---
Everything is political is not the same as recognizing there are degrees, a spectrum, with how controversial, upsetting, prone to controversy everything might be.  There's a stark difference.
---
It used to be Sports in the US were a good, neutral place.  People could get along where they otherwise might because they had a shared interest.  Now, sports are used as tools for controversial issues, and that benefit is being eroded for short term leverage.  
---
I don't agree with you.
---
Only dr. Strange could have predicted this. /s
---
Also the sponsor is Japanese and trust me they do not at all care for the Chinese, Chinese politics and the situation in Hong Kong. For many Japanese it confirms a lot of kinda racist beliefs about China and at least on the government side, making China have eggs on its face on the world stage would likely be a net benefit for Japan. So it’s not so surprising that Mitsubishi decided “Hey we don’t need to support this and we will get good PR for doing so”. It’s a pretty good business decision in my opinion
---
You should work in PR.
---
Sadly it seems like even this shitty """""apology""""" is enough for all of the Blizzard shills and Chinese bot accounts to crawl out of the woodwork and start to go "Ok guys it's been almost a week calm down".
---
We will not forget! We will not stop! 
---
Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times!
---
This channel has been banned from posting. If you think this is in error, please message the mods.
---
Sorry, I didn’t realize you only care about human rights when it doesn’t make you look like a racist
---
So fuck blizzard still.
---
Fuck the chinese government still.
---
And good luck to Hong kong in achieving their goals.
---
Sure, fair enough.  
---
Comparing a day they select to celebrate pride vs randomly sharing political / social views on their platform is apples to oranges.  
---
They've never done a China day where they're all wearing Chinese flags.  
---
If someone did a pro MAGA or anti vaxx speech I'm 100% sure they'd face consequences.
---
I’d be all for that, as long as relevant update post can be allowed it stickied as well
---
That said, suggesting us to go away because we’re the minority on the Reddit when we are discussing the authoritarian repression of minority groups in China is not a great look.
---
How do you misspell MITSUBISHI twice? lol
---
The biggest store in my town. It was actually multiple stores all across the country, and the message was from their account
---
The information is classified but the stores sell a metric shitton of Cola weekly.
---
And no, Coca Cola is not based in that country.
---
considering the terrible timigs i wont be surprised if this is the actual joe biden lmao
---
They're basically saying "You have one last chance to fix your shit before we get Parliament to rain hell on you."
---
Megathreads are where discussions go to die. See r/classicwow: They directed everyone to a stickied megathread, then unstickied it and now all discussion of this has disappeared from the sub.
---
I must have made some impact since you feel the need to comment on everything, sadly you keep saying the same and not answering the questions I return to you, so kind of a moot point to keep it up.
---
Yes, quite well in fact
---
They clearly don’t want political ideas spewed over their live airways.
---
Lol fuck you. China is committing atrocities. He should be commended, and his ban shouldn't be 'reduced' but eliminated. You greedy, greedy, pigs. Battlenet will remain forever uninstalled. No more diablo, hearthstone, or wow for me.
---
Bullshit and lies. That’s what this statement is.
---
This post was doenvoted 10 times today. Linguists don't fuck up English that badly.
---
&gt;People who say “keep politics out of my (insert thing here)” are not ignoring that politics pervasively shapes every aspect of our lives, and for those without the privilege of living in even a fairly democratic society it’s the equivalent of hearing the rest of the world saying: “I don’t want your suffering to ruin my good time. “ 
---
My man. Great statement!
---
I've got some tin foil, make sure to make the hat shiny side out though.
---
HKers get the fuck out. Make r/hearthstone great again.
---
I don't want to talk HK politics because people who weren't there won't understand but "fighting for human rights" is end we all support, but **the mean to achieve it is also important.** 
---
The mean HK localists include stuff like ambushing polices during the off-time, catapulting projectiles into police family residence, doxing police and their family and threaten to sexually assault them, smashing and blackmailing shops owned by people migrated from mainland, use of 20th century racist slogan used again Chinese by Japanese (which is kind of hilarious), and most recently, almost beating an old HKer to death who called them traitors...just to name a few. They are usually very young and mostly student, who are more or less likely to fall to more extreme appeals. There are also opposition politicians and media who are rile these people up but HK's political landscape is hard to explain to so I won't get into it. 
---
Bottom-line? They are not just divisive, but also violent, extreme and their methods are getting worse day by day. 
---
HK's current pro-democracy movement consists of millions of people, who are mostly peaceful, and like you said "trying to fight for their fucking basic human rights"...we should all support that. But there are people you shouldn't support -- unfortunately, asking Reddit to distinguish that seems a bit asking too much.
---
&gt; Cartman
---
&gt; Thanking anyone else ever
---
I dont think that script is going to work
---
Well, you could see any event other than the one you feel the strongest about as a distraction tactic, and it's not uncommon for governments (or any large entity) to use it. China is spewing a lot of propaganda blaming the US for the HK protests, which isn't even \*entirely\* incorrect (look up National Endowment for Democracy), but it's nonetheless a diversionary tactic. Every government entity does this. But all you can do is choose the things you want to spend your energy on, and the committing to that, right?
---
That's why when people say "oh but if you're going to boycott Blizzard you also have to cut out X, Y, Z etc.", it's meaningless drivel. We can only pick our battles, and it's unfeasible to fight them all at once.
---
Oh look, another shill!
---
Not to mention the cognitive dissonance of driving their political ideologies for profit (pushing lgbt when it makes bucks) but censoring this event.
---
"Blizzard is not a platform for politics" my ass
---
So did Kibler in his attempt at a diplomatic statement, comparing this to a NFL player kneeling during the anthem. This is about people being unjustly imprisoned in labor camps, murdered, and organ harvested. Not which candidate people in a free country back.
---
/r/thegoodplace is leaking
---
Continental Taiwan is pretty scary
---
I doubt Britain has any time or energy for this conflict considering their struggle to maintain their own nation with the whole Brexit drama.
---
Last thing they want to do is get into international drama and pull their parties appart even more.
---
I don't believe blizzard feels they did anything wrong. Players and the casters violated a TOS that they themselves agreed too.
---
The rules were broken. Blizzard responded. 
---
The political situation that was brought up is a very sensitive one and Blizzard handled the whole process about as bad as possible.
---
It's difficult to imagine a company the size of Activision Blizzard having such a clueless PR department.
---
 I agree. Same goes for Blitzchung response.  
---
I hate this passiveness people directly linked to this controversy take.  
---
I understand wanting to cool down emotions and keeping a friendly and healthy vibe.  
---
But what Blizzard did is unforgivable and the same thing can be said about many other controversies.  
---
Dealing with this with such lighthearted approach will solve nothing. It will only help this sort of actions and behaviors to take place in the future since the offenders will see this as a way out of any shit they do.
---
They will know they can get away from any shitty situation by just saying some sweet nothings and encourage their targets (Blitzchung) to do the same, to tell others to cease hostilities.  
---
No. Shit like this will never get solved if we keep giving a "out of jail" card to corporations like Blizzard. They will continue to do the same if they feel like there is always a way to get away from the shit they pull.
---
Continue the protests, continue the pressure, continue to raise awareness regarding this issue, don't give Blizzard any break. They poor excuse, their poor reasoning and clear attempt to get on the good side of Blitzchung after this ordeal shouldn't be enough to let this shit go.
---
Are you suggesting companies shouldnt make products that a billion people want because you personally dont like them?
---
I don't feel that anyone is blaming Blizzard for "the HK situation".
---
I completely understand that it is in Blizzard's best interest to stay out of politics. But Blitzchang didn't put them into politics. They did. A long time ago. At the very least, they did it back in June selling pride pins. Probably earlier than that.
---
Yes. That's what I'm saying.
---
I signed on yesterday and had 50+ people online.  Haven’t seen a single drop on my end.  Would like to see the actual numbers though.  
---
Twitch numbers for Blizz games don’t seem affected.  
---
ATVI stock didn’t take a hit like everyone assumed it would.  I sold all my shares thinking it would drop but it didn’t.
---
What a load of horse shit.
---
This anti china and free hongkong just became internet meme, ppl are spamming it during LoL worlds tournament right now in chat.
---
And the tone is in stark contrast to what Blizzard posted to the Weibo Hearthstone account. They aren't sorry they got caught, they are bitter that this was an inconvenience for them.
---
J. Allen Brack,
---
That is the biggest load of crap ive read in history (besides Donald Trump's daily tweets)
---
Basically you are telling us again that we are dumb, stupid and retarded ? just like the last time when you said to your loyal customers "*Don't you guys have phones ?"*
---
Who is the real idiot here ? the person smart enough to see trough your bullshit or the person dumb enough to think everyone will accept what you just said ?
---
So here is my answer to some real facts:
---
1) The only reason (and goals) you are posting here is because the stock market, you actually don't give a crap for the game(s) and as long you get your monthly paycheck and bonuses you give a rats ass whats right or wrong.
---
2) Ever heard of the Streisand effect ? Guess what you made it just 10x worse.
---
3) Your claims do not support anything what Activision/Blizzard has done here infact you have broken your own rules multiple times, and right now you are still bashing on the casters and the player blitzchung. Only because of the negative effect on the market you have decided to "loosen up" his punishment. Again only for your own personal gain and not the moral.
---
Again, less than 10% of Blizzard's revenue comes from China. They only want to retain China because it is an emerging market for them, and they're willing to sacrifice their core market in order to make it happen. Folks like you are enabling them in doing so.
---
Blizzard holds all the cards. They can literally walk away at any time, with all their IPs, brands, and titles, and the company will be intact. Thousands will not lose their jobs because Blizzard does not actually make that much of their revenue from China, they just want to in the future.
---
If you want to keep playing their games, fine. Don't try to excuse Blizzard's behavior here though just to scrub your conscience.
---
How’s your sex life?
---
The hypocrisy just leapt out
---
You shouldn't measure others by your own standards.
---
Are people really that sense that they can't see the difference?
---
Or written by a dozen people who all had their fingers in the document and it was taking too damn long so the top execs just grabbed whatever they had, ran it through autocorrect and published it at the end of the business week without having PR properly sign off on it.
---
Crazy stuff man. Crazy stuff.
---
this is so important.  computer games used to be fringe stuff but these days they are big business and the consumers *can impact big business* when concerted pressure is applied.
---
let's think about what happened here:
---
* people in HK protest.  literally hundreds of thousands.  in the streets.  potentially risking their lives.  for months. - meanwhile media in the West is focused on Trump and Brexit.
---
* singular voices speak up on Twitter (Darel Morey) and during an esports stream (Blizzchung)
---
* western companies heavy handedly attempt to silence the above
---
* the audience finally reacts
---
* the audience votes with their wallets
---
* an entire government takes notice
---
think about that.  and there's still people out there that day their voices don't matter!
---
"every voice matters" (oh the irony)
---
Blizzard shill.
---
So their are two Governments directly responsible for this whole situation and one is getting a free pass?
---
&gt;pretending that LGBT right are or should be a sensitive political topic is not ok
---
Look, maybe in your narrow-minded alt-right view of the world that is the case, but in the *actual* world there are many countries where LGBT**Q+** rights are a very political topic. In Iran you can be sentenced to death for gay sex. In Russia you can go to prison for "gay propaganda". Politicians all around the world are using the LGBT**Q+** community as political fodder and the only way to tackle it is in the international political arena. Take off your MAGA hat and see the world for what it is.
---
&gt;just like lots of reddit users using it for free karma.
---
I see this argument a lot. Name me one Redditor who gives a rat's ass about upvotes, lol.
---
It is 12%, everyone else is citing wrong or outdated statistics.

---
the company have made me not only made me not interested
---
If you have someone who ascribe to a certain political ideology and party, what would you refer to them as? If those players and/or persons consider themselves in the CCP how is specifying those involved in the CCP applying a false narrative?
---
She is. Just not in China...
---
In addition to a boycott of Blizzard games, I think it's time that  J. Allen Brack, President of @Blizzard_Ent , be asked to step down. His statement failed to apologize, he lied abt the content of blitzchung statement having nothing to do w/ it &amp; he assumed Hearthstone players are idiots.
---
The following illustrate their contempt for the community:
---
1. Their 3 day delay hoping the uproar would pass over thinking we are dumb animals 
---
2. The bold faced lie that this has nothing to do about blitzchung
---
I personally don't want to be "entertained" by a company behaving like Blizzard is under the leadership of JAB.
---
Uninstalling HS &amp; Battlenet from my PC was hard to do. I still reach for my phone multiple times a day to play a quick game of HS just to be pissed off again because Blizzard is being a dick.
---
Every day JAB is on the job, their brand becomes more of a nasty taste in my mouth that won't go away. I've already explained to my kids why we need to find another card game to play. Blizzard is ruining their brand one kid at a time. Don't they realize the damage they are doing is going to last for years to come?
---
Do you think it's a social issue? If so, please reread what Barack said. He clearly stated SOCIAL and political
---
Not as cool as you. Did you make the 'I quit HS' thread yet?
---
"This was posted by their PR guy, not Blizzard! How is Blizzard supposed to ever control the people they hired to represent them?"
---
Yayaya, I'm so ignorant. China is equal to the US in every regard. They are different culturally though. 1:1 baby, I know it hurts your ego to be compared to a Chinese person.
---
"List of Demands", oh great for a moment there I was worried that this community was lost to hubris...
---
But why stop there, while we're at it why don't we add to the list? I "demand" Blizzard to openly support:
---
Independence for Tawain
---
Independence for Tibet
---
Independence for Catalonia
---
Independence for Western Sahara 
---
Independence for Ambazonia
---
Independence for Katanga 
---
I also "demands" that they 
---
Condemn US for leaving the Paris Climate agreement
---
Condemn Japan for whale hunting
---
Condemn Israel for the actions against Palestine
---
Condemn Palestine for their violence towards Israel
---
I also "demands" that each eSport contestant gets 3 minutes of camera time where they'll read lists of political demands. 
---
There's a lot of issues worth talking about and supporting/condemning but is turning sportscast into an arena for activism really the way to go? 
---
Of course we want companies to act ethically and stand up for human rights but lashing out on them for saying "This broadcast is not the time or place" seems like a very slippery slope.
---
Walk me through how caring about human rights means hating Islam
---
I’ve done the same thing. 
---
Well done
---
Thanks.
---
Yep. Want to be linked or are you already too triggered, poor little guy?
---
I assume the mods are trying to bracing themselves to step in front of the shit-cannon.  Maybe realizing it was a mistake to let the mob turn on the shit-cannon in the first place.
---
im probably the only one. but i feel prize money you should keep. 3-6 month ban \[rule breaking, not because of what you did\] casters should never have been let go.
---
&gt; it is about the issue that blizzard deems some political messages ok, while others (like hong kong) are an absolute no-go 
---
The distinction being that Blizzard clearly endorsed one message and the players followed suit vs. a player utilizing Blizzard's tournament as a platform to voice his/her own opinions about a political issue Blizz has remained silent on. 
---
What's pissing people off *isn't* that Blizzard came down hard on a player who voiced a political stance. What's pissing people off is that Blizzard came down hard on a player who voiced a political stance *that people support*. 
---
If Blitzchung spouted off nazi or racist political ideas and Blizz banned him people wouldn't accuse Blizzard of silencing players. 
---
That's what is confusing a lot of people. People are pissed b/c they *want* Blizzard to take a stance similar to their own on this issue. People don't want Blizz to be neutral, nor do they want to voice an opinion contrary to their own. They want Blizz to actively advocate for their position. 
---
I don't think that's a reasonable expectation. I also don't think the punishment was proportionate to the offense.
---
People need to be informed of the results of their actions. This post contains valid information that isn't posted widely on this sub, not karmawhoring.
---
I really dont think so
---
 The guy here knew what he was doing what get him in trouble.
---
I like to create new and exciting decks to try on rank. Sometimes i'm enjoying it, sometimes it fails (ranging from rank 18 to 13, once only made it to 10 haha). Meta decks are okay but having to fight the same deck tires me a lot. Its not that i have many cards on my collections, but i dont really need the meta decks to play hearthstone. I play just for fun. Even if i rarely play hearthstone anymore, i still enjoy what decks i made.
---
Why the indent? Probably to break up the text and not have a giant wall of text. It helps our brain separate topics and recognize a shift in conversation. 
---
There is a consequence for your actions ... I mean you could argue that it’s not super common, but I’ve told my nieces ‘if you do x and y there is going to be a consequence’ plenty of times. 
---
Not dismissing, but some of these points seem a little grasping at straws to say the least.
---
Equating human rights with divisive social or political issues is weird to me
---
Being gay isn't a political view what lol
---
Some might say it's a social issue? If you think so, please reread what Barack said. He clearly stated SOCIAL and political
---
Like everyone else is saying, it may be technically correct but it is extremely awkward when used conversationally. When I read “Brack’s” statement, I instinctively stopped at the word “prizing” and thought about how odd that sounded. 
---
If I was a CEO releasing a PR statement this important, there is no fucking way I would let it go out to native English speakers sounding like this. 
---
Why Blizzard wouldn’t translate the statement into conversational English stumps me. Unless is was written by a Chinese official with the demand that it be released unaltered as a condition of continuing to do business in China.
---
Massive update just came out and nobody can talk about it. If you want to help HK support the kids who are dying on the streets to get their freedom. Posting on our subreddit is doing nothing.
---
FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING SHILLS
---
Ok, you got me there, I'm not going to put more time into this argument for now, you can go on doing your thing, and I can do mine, you win.
---
I am glad that you guys are actually helping to try and improve the situation for Hong Kong but we have gotten an official response from both Blitzchung and Blizzard on this matter, it should be enough for now. I understand that some people may want to further discuss this which is why i would suggest a megathread for the time being for anything non official.
---
If you truly want to help the situation in Hong Kong though you could also try donating, ive seen many people do that and i honestly heavily respect that!
---
I just don't like this kind of discussion on a hearthstone subreddit, i think if you truly want to help there are far better places than this place and much more effective ways (its also saddening to see people being ingenuine about their support and just trying to farm Karma).
---
No end until the CEO steps down.
---
But do you guys have phones ?
---
I think he is making fun of Trump recently saying in a conference that he will not help Turkey against Syria because they didn't help the US during the World Wars or some crap like that.
---
The two aren’t related, but this statement is eerily similar to the recent apology from Stack Exchange’s CEO (no actual apology, contradictory stances, repeatedly stating vague company values, dragging their feet to undo the damage done...)
---
If you have a look at the comments, homophobes are definitely here, but they are getting downvoted pretty hard (rightly so). This isn't really about Blizzard supporting LGBT rights it's about there outright objection to anyone even supporting a very similar, perhaps even worse, human rights issue.
---
Is that sarcasm or did I actually manage to change someone's mind?:0
---
Dude that bills been dead for weeks. Thatd not what the protests are about anymore.
---
Did China approve this statement?
---
Let me know what the penalty for apostasy is according to the Quran  and get back to me
---
ok
---
no not politics as in they should be commonplace, thus dont need to be debated
---
Ah yes, who else to speak out about someone else's integrity but Buckley, the guy who banned everyone on his forums criticizing his webcomic until he shaped his audience into exclusively people who lick his boots.
---
Oh well if he didn't come up with the slogan then it must be apolitical!  
---
THAT MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE.  What the fuck are you talking about?  The slogan itself is EXTREMELY POLITICAL.  That's the fucking point!
---
Everyone would like just not to be involved in anything and earn money. Unfortunatelly it's not that easy and by involving in business with China, you're going to get involved in politics at some point.  
---
By punishing him so severely, they have served politicalally inclined punishment, because that's the kind of message, China wanted to see. The same protest on american soil, would have way lighter impact. Politic 101 and it's not only blitzchung, who was dealing it.
---
This statement is written in an asian accent and it's fucking adorable
---
wait so are human rights political or not
---
Plus the fact that Chinese economy was never stable. The fact that merely putting tarrifs on them weakens them drastically says it all. Trump just needs to keep the pressure and this helps him greatly
---
based
---
I strongly believe the people that are saying that this will just blow over, saying other things of that nature, AND big content creator's still playing blizzards games with the opinion of being pro Hong Kong are a part of the problem. I don't care if that's their game of income, they're just as bad as Blizzard in my eyes. So a big f off to asmodgold.
---
Shut up with the "deny your rights and take your organs" shit. You have no idea what you're even angry about any more do you? Just repeating the same phrases over and over and over.
---
I think a lot of the rage stems from the point it gets worse and the fear it will get really bad. 
---
Right now you can get twitch prime loot for a chinese mobile game which is basically a walking copyright infringement towards League of Legends. The funny thing about this is that Tencent won a chinese Lawsuit against them but Twitch is also on the Pooh-train.
---
I can already hear the tank mains celebrating
---
I mean, pls don't shout on them because they are active in pride movements.
---
Man, you're such an idiot. It's not my government. I live in NYC. I'm trying to weed out the reason you people are keyboard protesting. I'm beginning to think it's two folded: people with no job, no money and general discontent with life. You people are miserable.
---
It seems he's considering it.
---
I happen to disagree with that, but I'm not a legislator. I'm just an asshole with an opinion on the internet. So it really doesn't matter what I think.
---
They pulled to not be associated with any anti-China sentiment. They're on the same side as Blizzard or any other international company.
---
Actually that is a good question.  I can't say for sure that Blizzard wouldn't have taken action.  Maybe they would have.  And it would be harder for me to say that it was truly a controversial statement. 
---
And it would be harder for China to be as offended as they were... That's a fun thought experiment.  Maybe someone will do that next time and test the boundaries.
---
Nobody cares about politics until it affects them, and by that point it’s usually too late to change anything
---
Okay, I will go on then.  Thank you for the quotation.
---
&gt;public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image
---
Either saying "free HK" or saying "fuck" could qualify for this equally, as both could be offensive or cause disrepute.  We are in agreement that political language is not targeted, because you quoted the part of the contract where it is not targeted.  So... your quote supports what I said.
---
kill probably at least, organs maybe
---
Well then you should probably start a farm so u can survive
---
Gay people existing is political.
---
Thanks /u/littlebobbytables9
---
Still doesn't explain why they didn't take action on AU so....
---
ffs, are people new to hearthstone twitch? there are tonnes of blacklisted words in that channel. stop acting like a huge conspiracy is going on.
---
This helped me to realize, I'm wasting my time and money on online games(and supporting China's communist regime without knowing it). Thank you Blizzard.
---
FFS stop already.  You're wrong, and it's okay.  It's going to be okay.
---
I'm so glad that I haven't given this shit company a single penny for years now. And now I have the more reason not to.
---
It does nothing. This will be forgotton after the weekend.
---
I'm honestly interested in whether there's a word for that. Might try on /r/whatstheword for that. In crime stories this is the point where someone shockedly points out *but only the murderer could have known that!*.
---
This is stupid as fuck. Gay people existing is not a political viewpoint. Like what the actual fuck is wrong with all of you?
---
Yeahh unfortunatelly their purchasing power is not that strong, so we are were we are. This is not merely about numbers, because with those alone China is bigger than NA and Europe combined. Still not the strongest market, though.
---
I mean short of them inventing a time machine, I don't think any demands are sufficient. The damage has been done and I see no point in *ever* giving them another cent no matter what. That's just my opinion, but I don't see any fathomable way they could repair this situation.
---
Sure it is
---
According to google:
---
Politics: "the activities associated with the governance of a country or other area, *especially the debate or conflict among individuals or parties having or hoping to achieve power.*"
---
Basically any discussion revolving around LGBT issues revolves around how much power/rights the group has in a country.   Current media pushes the LGBT politics in every movie or game they can.   If in today's society, being _straight_ is oppressive, then sexual orientation itself is a political issue and the LGBT has gained a lot of power over public opinion.   
---
So basically, in order for LGBT issues to *not* be political issues, then the LGBT community needs to be as commonplace and unoppressive as the straight community, where there is *no issues* to discuss.   When the LGBT becomes the LGBTS (S for straight) where EVERYONE accepts each other no matter the condition and it becomes the norm, then it's no longer political
---
They can move to an online card game that doesn't support a communist superstate which violates human rights constantly.
---
So basically the people creating and upvoting these posts are probably not even Hearthstone players.
---
Hmmm
---
You don’t speak Russian Sans, you’re like a fifteen-year-old with access to the Internet.
---
All this was is a hate train on blizzard, people love to hate blizzard. Most people dont actually care about the issues. There are HUNDREDS of better ways to support Hong Kong, than spamming video game chats, and reddit, instead of selfishly stroking your blizzard hate boner, why don't you do something that actually helps someone instead.
---
If only 700 more people quit Hearthstone Hong Kong will be free.
---
I mean, people have been advocating to boycott apple for years. They actually lobby for anti-consumer policies in order to monopolize control of their hardware. If people (especially americans) are going get whipped up into a frenzy about China, Apple should be front and center for all the bullshit they do not including China, and then all the stuff in China.
---
the supports would gladly help too
---
Formal..proper..same idea. But yeah. That I picked up on cause I'd have expected it to be less formal as a whole and it wasn't. Strange over all.
---
I’m not really sure if this is related to protests though? A bunch of random items are removed from the Bliz store because they’re switching vendors. The Lucio statue is also missing and I’ve heard some WoW merch is also missing.
---
The hatred has only really been since the late 1800's when Japan went to war with the Qing dynasty over Korean disputes. Before then, Japan has pretty much been China lite. With Kyoto old buildings looking a lot like Chang'ans(modern Xi'an) old buildings. And many Japanese Kings and emperor's have been tributes to many Chinese dynasties.
---
What if Im disappointed on them reacting to this ¨community's¨ outrage and lowering punishedments?

I know exactly what I'm angry about, I think taking the OP and twisting it into something that it isn't is just plain stupid and invalidates any point you're trying to make.
---
It's highlighting the VERY HUGE difference between what's being actually said and an actual regime. I think poor equivalency is a poor argument and I think you entirely missed the point of what I was actually getting at.
---
I'll totally accept if I worded it poorly, but I'm very aware of my stance on this issue and frankly I don't think anybody here should be compared to what China is doing, because that is wholly irresponsible and diminishes the way China has actually been behaving.
---
I'll concede, I made my point in a shitty way and obviously the wrong message was put across, but I still stand by the message that I was at least trying to convey
---
Come silence me, fucking greedy asshole company
---
Blizzard offended LGBT people on so many occasions they would need to ban themselves but i guess you're only a "group of people" if you can point a gun at them.
---
Ouh no, you people actually exist...
---
I'm so sorry buddy...
---
There is literally a person who had got paid and had a job to "remove cleavage from artworks".
---
Let this sink in...
---
Being against people disappearing in the middle of the night isn't "politics"
---
I didn't say that him not coming up with the slogan makes it apolitical.
---
I said the slogan is what is used and recognized internationally to draw attention to the human rights problem in HK.
---
If you take the slogan out of context it appears as a call to war.  That is not the message.  If it was, it would be political.
---
After throwing more insults than information I'm thinking you aren't interested in defending your point.
---
Yeah I mean "lots of people are quitting" right?  Shouldn't that mean the community would be getting smaller?
---
It just baffles me how this even happened, I was using the hero successfully only yesterday and there wasn't even an update since then so wtf actually caused this?
---
Such a shame, I really enjoyed overwatch. But I enjoy freedom of speech more.

That says “I don’t speak Russian.”

---
You got timed out for spamming mindless shit on their chat from their broadcast, where they have every right to do so? That is crazy
---
How the fuck is gay and trans rights divisive politics? maybe it's divisive in the same way that not holocausting jews is divisive to nazis?
---
Because you cannot censor hong kong as politically divisive then go shill hard about defending chinese dignity
---
And that coke mac donalds comparison of yours is not correct. This is much closer to a company who agreed to let another company to speak on their behalf, given authority to net ease to speak for them in order to be able to do bussiness in china. When net ease releases a statement, it is on behalf of blizzard. That is the cost of bussiness blizzard have accepted. So when net ease say something in their name, blizzard can't just deflect responsibility like that. Net ease's statement in blizzard's name runs contrary to the apolitical stance that blizzard claims to adopt. 
---
IF NET EASE DOES NOT TRULY REPRESENT BLIZZARD'S VALUES, BLIZZARD NEEDS ONLY TO MAKE IT CLEAR. THERE SHOULD BE NO ISSUE IF NET EASE TRULY DOESN'T SPEAK FOR BLIZZARD RIGHT?
---
No he isn’t.
---
Jesus, this guy is actually so smart. I wish others on subreddit were.

А по ебалу за такое?

Not liking the Epic store vs. complicity in genocide and wide scale oppression.  Oh yeah, comparable animating causes.  /s
---
Sure, you get a fruitless discussion. Still has literally nothing to do with censorship.
---
Not really.  Someone elses statement has no impact on their own personal values or whatnot.  If American's bowing to China bothers them to that extent, then more power too them.
---
Тебе, сукаю с левой или, сука, с правой?
---
Okay so what is the right reason to do the right thing?
---
Not from that part but a few others did sound a bit more formal/proper to me. Not that line exactly. But some parts did. And I did read it twice and I'd certainly say I'm a native english speaker.
---
this is bullshit. right wing gamer bros using weaponizing support for the LGBT movement as if they actually give a shit about LGBT people.
---
No he is absolutely right. I just didn't mention this. I live in Taiwan and I have been here for the past five years. I also have a degree in Chinese language and literature so I'm capable of pulling information directly from sources

You said you already read it why do I have to show it to you?

You can discuss it here on r/Hearthstone. No one is stopping you. You getting downvoted is just people not wanting to have your discussion interfere with theirs. It’s just not that important to the people downvoting you. It’s not stopping you though.
---
Part of it is the strong showing of call of duty mobile and the continued strength of candy crush.  If it the stock was only blizz it would have taken a significant hit.
---
I read it all. It doesn't say shit about the reason for the casters firing, so that's why you need to show it to me. You keep referencing something that does not exist
---
This has as much weight as people in the US claiming the Black Lives Matter movement is hurting the US and kneeling football players are disrespectful to our troops.
---
Didn't they delete that already though?
---
Its not unreasonable given that the chinese market isn't the majority of their earnings, and their desire to be in the chinese market is negatively impacting me as a costumer.
---
Certainly valid moral and humanitarian reasons to argue, but I'll argue now as purely a costumer.
---
If Blizzard is willing to negatively impact the majority because they will lose a minority if they don't, then the majority has the option to leave them and instead look to put money towards a company that does prioritize us.
---
As an example, the diablo immortal fiasco came straight out of their dealings with the chinese market, and for me as a costumer was a massive waste of what they can provide me.
---
There is a lot of interesting concepts imaginable that don't comply with chinese standards, and I will miss out on any chance to experience their implementation in games if they prioritize pleasing china.
---
If Blizzard is left with the option of "lose a minority" versus "lose the majority" of their income, it seems perfectly reasonable that they drop the minority, and for me as an individual customer in the majority that is better.
---
That's the amusing thing.  I bet so many people saw this story on some news  site and thought "hmmm, I haven't played Hearthstone in a while, I should fire it back up".
---
Do you believe your original reply was pushing a discussion or an argument ? Seems to be me like you purposelessly lashing out.
---
Thanks
---
Well yeah, that's capitalism.
---
Companies will never care about democracy or about the customers, they will alway side with profit and never care about ethics.
---
History has shown that time and time again, whether it were american companies profiting from nazi germanys market or american companies profiting from chinas market.
---
Link for the lazy?
---
Tirion quote.  That we fought for freedom and the safety of our people
---
Our money doesn't rely on chinese products to exist - China relies on OUR money to exist. 
---
Less money = less power.
---
But this isn't just about money, it's about international corporations cowtowing to chinese censorship. Blizzard has joined that list. You don't have to live in the woods to not support the spread of chinese censorship.
---
Blizzard would much rather lose NA than lose China. The market is way too big to lose.
---
There's way too many factors to seriously ask a question like that. Morality isn't some kind of blanket statement all the time where you can just go "Yup, that's good and that's bad and there's nothing inbetween."
---
But I can tell you that donating to a charity because of corporate greed *isn't* the right reason.
---
Maybe.  It is speculation, you're right.  I just don't see why Blizzard *wouldn't* consult with such important stakeholders regarding the decision.
---
&gt; An American company, Blizzard, banned a competitor and fired casters (now suspended for 6 months) in order to please the Chinese government. 
---
This is just uninformed when you actually research into the situation. All signs point to this being out of their hands and done by their Chinese partners. Yes they do have a responsibility to it,  but let's not act like the entire thing happened faster than Blizzard  has every moved on a situation.
---
The only thing Blizzard has done involving the Chinese Government is not retract statements made by their partner in their name. Because THAT would be intentionally offending and entire country. It doesn't matter if it's China, England, Mexico or whatever,  retracting a statement like that would get you banned from business in that country.
---
blitzchung what was gonna happen when he did it, and he knew he was "in the wrong"...
---
While i understand "why" blizzard did what they did, the process on how they did it was pretty Horrendous... A better action would've been admonishing blitzchung publicly BEFORE they banned him so that then could've made clear on why they did it to lessen the backlash... Then again, im just a loser typing away at my computer. (i really cant care less about the politics behind what happened but i do care about the backlash it caused)
---
Hate to be a China apologist, but don’t think Saudi Arabia or India is any better for LGBT
---
&gt;given authority to net ease to speak for them in order to be able to do bussiness in china. 
---
Netease does not speak for Blizzard in China.  They publish Blizzard games in China in order to comply with Chinese law.  Netease isn't speaking in Blizzard's name.  I don't know how many times I need to say that.  Netease doesn't speak for Blizzard.  Chinese game publishers don't speak for the game companies that they license in China.
---
Yes most definitely. The school is now punishing the children. That's ridiculous.
---
The CCP is just as bad as the Nazis and anything but absolute antagonism toward Nazis should be viewed with disgust.
---
Doing their dirty work should be grounds for a great big fuck you.  Blizzard has chosen to be an enemy of basic human rights.
---
Fuck Blizzard, fuck the CCP, and fuck anyone who is neutral or supportive of either of them.
---
If we wanted to piss off china really badly we could start calling Taiwan the real China because the two countries fight over that a lot. It would be petty but it would also take a hit at that national pride that they care about if people did not recognize them as the real china.
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) 
---
 just for a basic coverage of how much they fight over who is the real China
---
Blizzard gave the go-ahead to the player who was in the TFT tournament on his phone.  He had asked them about it beforehand, maybe there was a miscommunication but that's why there was no punishment.
---
Yeah I dont want to shit on the mods but every other blizzard subreddits mods handled it perfectly.  Every other Blizzard subreddit is back to normal, while this one might as well be r/hongkong2
---
That’s cool and I wish him luck. Many people are still upset that a company we loved so much decided to abandon its “core values” for its Chinese market money. 
---
And speaking from the stand point of what is or isn’t a Hearthstone topic this is still one as it started with and revolves around HS and the company that made it.
---
Might I suggest /r/competitivehs for more only gameplay topics.
---
I cut off a chinese driver the other day and i speak favorably of the Japanese. Im very woke.
---
That's awefully defeatist.  In my experience of all areas in life success is significantly linked to determination.
---
I have no intention of burning out on this anytime soon.
---
Most stores but blizzard removes sold out items. Always have as far as I know.
---
Blizzard Execs : but but but China = $$$$ + bonus
---
You need to take your sufferage blinders off and get educated on the world around you.
---
1 man who was democratically elected by a massive proportion of the US population.
---
What brought them into disrepute? What if one were to say that they respected the LGBT cause? Certainly that would be divisive; should those comments be outlawed too?
---
My point is that many things can be seen as divisive, and the open ended nature of the rule he broke means it will be up to Blizzard's discretion. If their judgment is seen to be lacking, as is here, then they will get feedback, even if it TECHNICALLY is against the rule.
---
Cops can write tickets for everyone they pull over, but sometime they don't. If a cop only gave tickets to black people, and let off white people with warnings, technically he is within the law. But the optics sure wouldn't look good for him.
---
And good RNG
---
I am trying! Google / Apple is more difficult because phone options are basically Android or Apple, but I think speaking out about and making an effort is better than nothing at all.

Soon only supporters can be employed. Dissenters will be dismissed.

Do you respond to people laughing at the D in DPRK with a mocking "Not real Democracy"?
---
That's really the antithesis of what anyone who believes in capitalism wants. All of the moral philosophy surrounding capitalism is about the importance of individualism and how the ideal moral arbiter is the individual. Being forced to capitulate to someone else's morality when it conflicts with yours is immoral in this view. It's a big reason why liberals (individualist capitalists) did not forgive those who were "just following orders" in the trials at Nuremberg. You are expected to be your own arbiter of morality.
---
Like you're making fundamentally capitalist arguments against "capitalism."
---
Reported for astroturfing and shilling for Blizzard.
---
"Ridiculously lenient"... yeah, like giving him only, say, the same amount as a cheater.
---
I think it's just reading way too much into it.  
---
Like the Mei statue, several other statues aren't up either f.ex lucio, some from WoW. And that new hero umbrella. Likely just reached the preorder limit or something similar to this. If it was due to ominous reasons, then wouldn't they removed ALL Mei related stuff?

It's just that people seem to dig deep and make connections with very little substance in order to rile people up.

&gt;Not every religious person disagrees with it, just some people from some religions. The amount of people is irrelevant because whether it's right or wrong isn't linked to the quantity of humans.
---
You do realize that people do not dictate the religion right? It's a sin in religion. It doesn't matter how they feel about it. It is a sin to them. 
---
&gt;And religious beliefs aren't biological,

No, but you need a sperm to fertilize an egg. The entire point of sex, by biological standards, is reproduction. You can't reproduce with without a penis and a vagina.

shaman is looking less like tier 2 and more like tier 0, esp if they draw well a turn 4 evolve with double mogu is usually game ending. too much value being generated even before the event this deck was annoying af to match up against but now it has truly been unleashed. everything else seems pretty fun tho
---
they targeted gamers
---
Let's say you commit vandalism in a public place, like a park or office building. Now let's say you do the exact same thing, except at a national monument or government building instead. You will obviously be punished far more severely for the latter even though you technically did the exact same thing in both cases. Is that considered a double standard?
---
It's roughly the same situation here. Hearthstone Grandmasters is Hearthstone's biggest, highest-stakes event. It's a worldwide tournament has the highest viewer turnout of any Hearthstone competition, both online and in person. Of course violations of player conduct are going to be taken far more seriously there than at a collegiate championship. Especially if they involve politics.
---
Like they had a choice
---
They don't even apologize to Blitzchung or the casters.
---
Honestly until this incident, this was my first time hearing about the Diablo Immortal thing, and the Star Wars poster.  
---
Which means those things were covered up by the media.  Goes to show just how far the influence of China goes.
---
Shaman is pretty roll-dependant. According to HSReplay, it has 55.97% WR
---
yeah that explains why NBA basketball is popular worldwide. super dogshit lmao
---
The Hong Kong stuff makes (or made, let's see) the frontpage, because there are still people in here that don't give a fuck about HS content and are only here for the shitstorm. And the people that want to talk about a children's card game are in the right, this is a Hearthstone sub, it's purpose IS to talk about this exact card game.
---
Go discuss your stuff elsewhere, please.

Ress priest is a nice new deck that I will play once I get some more dust.
---
&gt;  I denounce all authoritarian forms of communism
---
well that is the only form of it that can exist in reality
---
reason being, communism relies on taking from those who produce to give to those who do not
---
you can't have that without a big and powerful government
---
communism killed circa 250,000,000 people in the 20th century. Mountains of skulls commemorate it in combodia. Smashed students commemorate it in China. Mass graves commemorate it in Russia. 
---
Meanwhile the west has prospered exponentially more than any human has in all of history thanks to small government, capitalist, and freedoms via a constitution. I'm never going to give up my western values to try some shitty ideology that has never worked.

---
&gt; noble as it may be, no company is going to hire you just like that for a reason like this. 
---
If you're working at a company like Blizzard, you will be able to find another job. There's no reason for another company to know why you're leaving.
---
&gt;May not be easy to just up and leave your job like that
---
Obviously, which is why I said *look.*
---
You really want to twist the principal of "I'm allowed to hoard as much wealth as possible with no consideration for any other person" into a just and righteous thing, and it's not. You think in modern capitalistic America (and elsewhere in the world) that people aren't being forced to do things that compromise someone else's morality? Give me a break.
---
Hard to prove, even harder to pin on anyone specifically.  But I have been a member of this sub a long time and seen a lot of drama come and go and this one is unusual.  While I am sure a lot of people involved in the protest are random Hearthstone players who are either concerned about Hong Kong, or angry at Blizzard, or just enjoy drama (basically redditors doing normal redditor things) there definitely seems to be some 'coordination' happening somewhere this time.  The voting patterns on threads and comments are very odd.
---
And what makes you think the outrage is new?
---
FFS, people being supporting Hong Kong since they started their movements months ago, you just have to look at some of the highests posts of reddit and you can see it. This [post has 101k upvotes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cg1sh2/chaos_and_bloodshed_in_hong_kong_district_as/) Its 2 months old.
---
 People have been criticizing China since they heard about the Ughyurs and the social credit system. 
---
You think this outrage is because of Blizz alone? Only if you have been blind and deaf to any other form of media and news for these past months.
---
If you have a look at the official Grandmasters guide, 'Prizing' is consistently the term they use to describe the monetary side of things.

tbh my guy i don't see how that's the same thing. China is communist, north korea is not democratic.
---
It's a higher % of profits, though they don't disclose the exact figure.
---
They don't run any of their games in China -- instead they license them to NetEase which incurs all the costs of operations and marketing etc and pays Blizzard a royalty. That royalty is what shows up in revenue, not game sales, and those royalties are almost pure profits.
---
Also looking forward as they launch more mobile games (Call of Duty Mobile, Diablo Immortal, new unannounced games) China is a huge market for that so overall % should grow.
---
Please do not let this die. Cross post this so people understand we are making a difference.
---
The enemies of the West do not concern themselves with intellectual consistency, which is ultimately a power construct developed to preserve patriarchy. I’m not memeing shit, this is literally what “philosophers” like Derrida and Foucault wrote about in the 60s-70s.
---
I don't know how they measure their reviews, but to have moved this review from 4.2 to 4.0 if it was just averaged would have taken a relative loss of 320,000 stars.
---
This is not nothing.  Nor is it a small number.
---
What do you mean "you guys"? I sure don't. I dont see how me saying I support Hong Kong means I endorse putting kids in cages.
---
How is this Hearthstone content? Shouldnt unrelated garbage like this be moderated?
---
You could always have done research and not supported chinese products. But an industry defends its assets in a foreign market as Capitalism states they should, and now we are mad? You shouldnt have been supporting them long before any of this happened if you truly believe them to be the bad guys in all this.
---
yes, boycotts are effective, amongst a sea of opinions and views, companies will definitely see their financial statements showing losses.  Learn how to be consumers.

I agree police brutality is a fact, as I said, but here are the two videos of why police shooting is justified:

After brexit, ukraine, iraq and HK, many chinese believ democracy is just a joke now.
---
Many chinese believe korean gov and japan govs are just puppet of US. I thjnk thats wrong, can you tell me more about the korean gov?
---
It also depends upon the industry and where it's located. Silicon Valley companies have to be much more supportive of LGBT rights, otherwise they'll face worker rebellions.
---
In 2014 Mozilla made Brendan Eich, who financially supported Prop 8 (CA's same sex marriage ban amendment), their new CEO. Since Mozilla's staff is really pro-LGBT, and they're headquartered in California, that didn't go over very well. If you know your CEO financially supported taking away your rights, can you trust him to treat you fairly if you're a member of that group? He ended up being forced to resign very quickly from the backlash.
---
Yea. I just wish that just once something like this would happen to someone who has a bit of conviction and integrity. I'd have made a video to blizzard saying screw you...keep the money if you think I'm a bad person for caring about people. It would have sent shockwaves across the world I tell ya! And things actually might have changed!
---
To many this helped bring light to these situations as well though. (Not to mention I’ve heard of people boycotting China for a while now; and companies that abuse their cheap and harsh labor to save money) It’s easy to not realize the severity of the situation if you aren’t invested in it; and when a game you play by a company you know comes under the spotlight it also opens up the whole story to a lot of people. If people start their activism later than others it doesn’t devalue what they’re trying to do, no matter how small, and it doesn’t have to all happen at once. 
---
People are allowed to be upset, and people are allowed to take gradual steps towards making their message. People shouldn’t be expected to just chuck their phones in the ocean and storm China’s borders. You can’t change everything overnight, even within your own lifestyle, but people shouldn’t be faulted for trying.
---
Our capital city Prague have deal with one of China city. Prague mayor decline contract that we would agree with politics of One China. Now China threat Czech republic, that will diverts china tourist and cancel  subsidies for football club if we dont sign this. Our president is angry (he is pro Russia and China). Fuck China.
---
I'm not Blizzard, and I'm not losing money to PR. Whether or not something is morally correct, and whether or not something is the best pr most profitable course of action are two separate things.
---
THANK YOU
---
No if I cared I wouldnt have answered your question and would have made 25 HK posts and how virtuous I am by oh look I dusted my collection, and oh wow I uninstalled battle net im soooo special
---
&gt;China is scared
---
You stupid, self important children. You really think shitposting in a children's card game subreddit has any impact whatsoever on global events ?
---
No if the pro HK people on Reddit were a true hive mind then you used it fine, but a hive mind implies people being brainless and brainwashed by propaganda. Just because people disagree about a human rights issue, and don’t share your opinion doesn’t mean they’re a hive mind

That's the question really, and the answer really changes everything.
---
Exactly, just like Crimea was never annexed, oh, wait.
---
Dude delete yourself and your post please,, this is embarassing. Dont talk to people like this when they're trying to help you
---
Also, by your argument communism is good too.
---
The goal of communism isn't to create a totalitarian government, that's just how it always turns out. 
---
So communism is just as good as capitalism. I'm warming up to this now.
---
As long as you ignore what has always happened historically, everything is good.
---
Who’s asking Blizzard to dump China? Blizzard is bending over for PRC so China won’t dump *them*.
---
&gt; They explained how keeping the Chinese market also aligns with their ideals.
---
Ignoring ethics so you won’t be barred from a huge market does indeed align with the collection of profit, that part seems pretty obvious.

Classic PR strategy. Also the stock market is closed.

Blizzard already had to roll back some of their punishments and publish a (non) apology. It's pretty clear people are doing *something*.

This is value. Even more value could be added by photoshopping Vargoth to Winnie the Pooh and Rag to supreme leader, son of the sun, Lord Xi Jinping

Oh shit didn’t see that part my bad. I don’t follow most other sports, but I assume politics are prevalent in sports across the world based on others replies.
---
Cool, thanks for proving my point which is that you don’t actually give a shit about the issue at hand, which is HK’s relationship with China (and the way China wields its power in affecting public opinion on the issue), you only care about having something at which you can be angry for a few days. 
---
You comprehension of the issue and why it is problematic is so limited and two dimensional a two year old could diagram it in his Monday morning arts and crafts. 
---
What a joke.
---
I dunno why you keep bringing up LGBT in America as if it's somehow a lightning rod issue. There's not a single person I know who even cares anymore. In 2016 it was not brought once during any of the Trump-Hillary debates, and so far in 2020 the only candidates to bring it up are the irrelevant ones trying to drum up any support for themselves they possibly can. You can tell an issue is settled when even the politicians have moved on because everyone's largely on the same page.
---
That's why it was so feckless and weak for Blizzard to "bravely" support it. It's about as brave as saying "At Blizzard, we're against slavery and don't think ANYONE should be enslaved!" Like yeah. So is the entire country, and we got there a long time ago. 
---
With Blitzchung they had an actual chance to stand for something, or at least step out of the way, and they did the most cowardly thing possible. Which should prove definitively that there was never anything brave about them supporting pride month.
---
Man. I wish people would take back the power in their hand and choose to not fuel such a system...
---
I upvoted it for that alone.

Someone post this idea on other subs, 4chan, facebook etc.

99% of china will be pissed!

Sorry i thought you were American

Nothing to do with capitalism. Communist and socialist governments do the same
---
All 3 of his comments are a joke, and I'll link them to further your point:
---
* 1 - In China the same picture and video footage is widely circulated as demonstration of the benevolence of the army. As in any other country the guy would likely have been rolled over or shot.
---
* 2 - What incursion? Chinese military has stationed in Hong Kong since the handover in 1997
---
* 3 - The brainwashing is strong in this one. China has every right to ban supporters of the extremists who are attacking civilians and burning public properties in Hong Kong, just like the Americans hated the attackers in New York on 911.
---

---
It's a conflicting apology, that in no way *apologizes* for what they've done. They silenced someone, and when it didn't go well, they "apologized"
---
It's sorta like saying your "sorry" for being caught stealing money, not for doing it
---
Theres a better link below, but the short of it is that China tried to force an extradition bill that would allow china to arrest Hong Hong citizens and bring them to china for trials. China right now with its "president for life" (given the recent removal of term limits for a president) is an authoritarian government. Being forcefully sent there for trial right now seems pretty sketch.
---
So hkers are pretty pissed off about that.
---
A megathread would not work because the mods would have to keep deleting posts and point people to the megathread and then they would be under fire for censorship. 
---
If you want a sub just discussing the game go to /r/competitiveHS

Them saying that his opinion had no influence on the decision to ban him is just a blatant lie
---
The deck is good against aggro but the meta is mainly mid range to combo. What deck list are you using? The deck relies on combos alot so make sure to throw in some good card draws. You cant beat a control warrior but you should be good against combo priest if you can draw the combo
---
I'll delete the post but are you really gonna tell someone to basically kill themselves because they're in a bad mood about a video game.

You're right I was being an asshole because I had to let of some steam but telling me to 'delete myself' over it is going a little far, don't ya think?

Apparently the only people able to effect change in the entire world are the media. Kind of funny considering history clearly disproves this, but who's to argue with the wise and knowledgeable /u/Fanoran.
---
Sorry to say but that is never going to happen. Unlike a company such as Epic (ironically), who is majority owned by a single person or group, Acti-Blizz is publicly traded and thus, means they are run by a board of directors. The "leadership" you want changed are the ones who \*literally own stakes in the company\* , and they aren't going to replace themselves to appease angry gamers.
---
Asking for the impossible like this simply makes it easier for them to dismiss us entirely, whereas if we can line our outrage with \*realistic\* demands, we just might be able to make them cave.
---
Bullshit. The two aren’t even remotely comparable. Trump was democratically elected. We have a separation of powers.
---
Exactly. What CCP fears the most is getting exposed to the sunlight. What Blitzchung and Morey did these days is that they forced their hand. We gotta do this more often. We need to force CCP's hand, back them into a corner. We need to keep provoking them
---
The funny thing is that if you watch any of Kyle Bass's videos, he explains very clearly on just how dependent China is on american capital. America could at a moment's notice literally pull the plug on China's economy

We need to start a petition to get Ben Brode to come back and bitch slap some sense into Blizzard execs.
---
&gt;Q: Do you accept that Blizzard DQ'ed you based on "non-political reasons"? Will you accept the returned prize money? (note that DQ in Cantonese sometimes refers to a ban like in this case)
---
&gt;A: I have to think about that. (seconds later) I will accept the prize money. I've already talked about it. About the DQ, althought I'm still having emotions about it... yeah to be fair I did signed a contract when I agreed to play in the Grandmasters, and I did break the rules, so the punishments are acceptable.  
---
he accepts blizzard's statement that their rule designed to be selectively enforced wasn't enforced in this case for political reasons? fair enough if he doesn't want to be involved in protesting blizzard but he's actively co-signing their bullshit here.  
---
"any act that, in Blizzard’s discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of
---
the public, or otherwise reflects unfavorably on Blizzard"  
---
"in Blizzard's discretion". they are openly stating that this rule is designed to be selectively enforced.
---
I really like those iconic and kinda busted cards coming back, Ragnaros sniping the opponents face over his full board is just great =)
---
And talking about Warlock, while the overall winrate might not be great, Plot Twist Warlock is really fun. It naturally plays high cost minions and deathrattle, you can fit basically all of the neutral legendaries in. (Maybe even The Curator, haven't tried that yet)
---
I have played quiet a lot of N'zoth Priest, which is really coool and not as busted as Big Priest in wild and Tempo Mage, Flamewanker ist just fucking broken :)
---
Highlander Paladin is cool too, but it's too tempo oriented for my taste. Currently trying to build a control N'zoth Paladin.
---
Have played against quiet the number of Quest Druid and Kun is sick.
---
I wan to add, that it was definitely justified to sent Rag and Sylv  to the HoF, they are just being slapped into everything and are immensely strong.
---
I sadly don't believe it for a second but if only Blizz could go bankrupt on this ... Fan of them for 20 years, yet at some point enough is enough
---
I have to respond in a similar fashion.
---
Go outside as in "Step outside my front door"?
---
To be honest, given complete financial independence - I'm fairly certain his response would have been different. 
---
I don't judge him and wish the best to the guy, but acting primarily upon fear for income and stability although rational, can be defined as selling out, yes. 
---
Also, I don't think the fiasco deserves giving any respect to Blizzard, and trying to offer any after everything that happened looks more like trying to gain stability rather than a genuine expression of ones feelings towards the company.
---
It's he's choice to decide whether or not the statement is adequate in addressing concerns, or are we a hive mind now?
---
The masses of people with virtual torches and pitchforks clamoring at their doorstep tends to call for action over more stellar communication. 
---
Also large corporations always have trouble putting out big communications like this crisply. It needs to be clean &amp; factual above all else, but often loses that warm organic voice (unlike a more intimate, flowing discussion, like with blitzchung himself).
---
Blizzard knew they had to come to a resolution, communicate it to those directly impacted first (blitzchung most critically), and then get the info out to the world before the end of the week. The time zone difference between Blizzard and blitzchung alone builds in an effective 1-day delay (late business day California time is early morning in Asia). 
---
That's a lot of logistics for big corporations, especially ones in "oh no what have we done" mode. Big corporations, in my experience,  move very slowly on everything that isn't routine and they're more chaotic internally, even near the top, than most people think.
---
Blizzards communication was effective in my mind, not perfect, but acceptable at a base level. This dialogue from the hero himself fills in the gaps and gives us the best insight possible. I'm glad he took the time to speak with everyone and hopeful it encourages people to support the fight for human rights internationally for the long term. 
---
We should remember that the behavior these companies are exhibiting are ultimately side effects of the real problem. A terrible government with a gun to the world economy's head.
---
Because Democrats aren’t acting authoritarian at all right? Protecting corporations right to censor people on the internet. Wanting more government control over our lives. Want to ban guns and strip people of their rights and ability to fight back against any authoritarian government. They are both the same. There is only one party in this country and they don’t give a fuck about any of us.
---
I admit I made a mistake with my usage of "public". However, while the penalties for vandalism vary from state to state, they generally add additional penalties for defacing certain buildings like government property, monuments, or graveyards. More often than not, the punishments are not held to the same standards.
---
It is, once again, the same situation at Hearthstone Grandmasters. Almost all of the rulebooks on the Hearthstone website forbid making political statements, but only the Hearthstone Grandmasters rulebook prescribes a set punishment - immediate forfeiture of the tournament and cash prizes - for violating this rule. The rulebooks for less serious tournaments state that the punishment is up to Blizzard's discretion and can just be limited to warnings, which the AU team likely received.
---
In my opinion, in addition to the collegiate championships being less serious than Grandmasters, the internet would have eviscerated Blizzard for one reason or another no matter what the punishment was, so giving a lighter punishment was the best choice.
---

All subreddits really
---
Honestly I am really not a fan of how this controversy was moderated at all.  Way too much power was put in the hands of people to create repetitive spammy content with no effort at all to allow people interested in discussing literally anything else to use the sub.
---
Generally I appreciate the mods on this sub, I think they do a difficult job where it is impossible to please everyone and they mostly strike a good balance, but this time around it's a thumbs down from me I'm afraid.
---
tell ya wha. If 1,000,000 people boycott Blizzard, I will boycott it too. Fair?
---
This issue concerns the dev of this game you cabbage
---
Glad someone corrected that. My wife is from China and has visited Japan several times, including once in a school trip where her whole class went for two weeks and a couple times with her family. She absolutely loved it and always talks about how nice everyone was over there. The three languages she learned in school were Chinese, Japanese and English. Her favorite show growing up was Detective Conan, etc etc. 
---
It's pretty reductive for him to say "Japanese people don't like Chinese and this confirms their racism is right!" I'm not sure why peddling that narrow-minded viewpoint even has anything to do with this thread.
---
Apparently fiduciary responsibility is.... Largely not a legal concern unless it's paired with something else illegal.
---
Sort by new, you'll see a lot more posts actually about the game.  At the moment a lot of people have flooded the boards.

I think it's good to be critical of capitalism. I just want people to be critical of what capitalism actually is, not some absurd cartoon version of it.

---
&gt;I have some idea. Religion doesn't necessarily stay the same, it changes over time.
---
The sins have stayed the same, the perception of sins have changed, and the amount of which the government is influenced by it has also changed. 
---
&gt;Neither did what you said, but I tried to address it anyway. Human reproduction is just one type.
---
Of reproduction. We aren't talking about any other kind of reproduction aside from humans, where you require a fertilized egg to reproduce. 
---
&gt;People don't necessarily need a penis/vagina to have sex to reproduce, if that's what you were trying to say before.
---
You need a sperm, which is exclusively made by males, and an egg, which is exclusively produced by females, in order to create a human. 
---
&gt;I've read that there is research into turning stem cells into sperm cells, and something similar may be done for eggs.
---
What you've read on salon.com doesn't matter in reality where it is required to have a male produce sperm and a female to produce an egg.
---
I love HS and wish I could play. There are many who feel the same, but don't wish to prioritise their own personal enjoyment over other people's human rights.

Communism, unlike capitalism, is both a political ideology, AND an economic system.
---
One can be a capitalist, but also authoritarian  in their political system (see South Korea immediately after WW2).

Communism inherently has political goals. Capitalism doesn't.

Ah, yes, the old "everyone who disagrees with me must be paid to do so".
---
I'm already never going to chance going to China, just in case I've offended with my trackable history.
---
With just a team of a dozen or so sharp devs, it wouldn't be hard to find flaws in people's posting history and track it down to their real identity. Then correlate that with some sentient analysis too.
---
It would be all too easy.

If only you'd realise that r/hearthstone is a relevant place to discuss it because the company that owns the game is at the centre of a shitstorm.

That's not how the burden of proof works.

❄️ 💧
---
You convinced me. I was criticising people to deciede about the political aspect you greatly explained on the last paragraph, as I coincide with your point of view with that.
---
On the other hand, I don't think that we should overpolitize things (I'm definetly not doing it) but after reading you I really don't care anymore if people does.
---
I mean, it's fair trade, even though they gave an explanation similar than what I thought, and that I think is legit to punish a player forcedly pushing political stuff on official events, they clearly overreacted and they absolutely deserved comuinty's overreaction.
---
Now I'm not gonna do that, I don't think is the right thing to do, but I'm gonna respect those doing it and I'm not gonna defend blizz from what they called for.
---
You used the word “When” not something like “if.” That gives away your interpretation of what you want to happen in HK. You want the Chinese to go all out so you can be right. I might be evil, but not as evil as someone who wants tragedies to happen to prove themselves right. 
---
Also, manipulation goes entirely what you want you message to be. These corporations have to be voluntarily participating for you to have any basis to want hold them accountable. You don’t hold the person who was manipulated responsible for their own manipulation, manipulation implies they didn’t know they were being controlled, you hold the manipulator accountable. Under what you said it would be comparable to victim shaming blizzard by boycotting them.
---
gamers are so insecure they’ll literally go as far as to pretend to care about what’s going on in hong kong to drag down lgbt people/activism, pathetic really.
---
Not all of the people of Taiwan even agree with that now a days. Mostly just older KMT hardliners.
---
A lot of the younger people have given up on claiming to be the "true" China. They are simply content being their own country.
---
Don't forget the people who go out of their way to explain how we're blowing this out of proportion because nothing ever happens.
---
Hahahaha. You guys don't miss a chance to throw shit at the LGBT community. Now supporting us and respecting our existence is suddenly political. Fuck China anyways, but fuck you guys too.
---
Priest definitively seems like the best class for speedrunning this, right?
---
Unless you are employed by someone who cares about what you say in public space because you are public figure,
---
 or unless you are on private property,
---
 or unless you are on a publicized platform which someone else is responsible of.
---
freedom of speech to talk on a street corner means shit all when the majority of communication happens through private online platforms, at private business events, or as we have seen private entertainment outlets.
---
...They'll have to openly support the Hong Kong protesters before I forgive them .-_-
---
Shitstorm is over, kiddo. Blitz is less offended than you are.
---
Your ignorance and selfishness is astounding. I wonder if you would still have a “no politics in my games” if you were the one being persecuted by the Chinese Government.
---
They can't win. That's the consequence of actively showing support for certain political movements then trying to remain 'neutral'.
---
$1500? The fk is wrong with you.
---
&gt; We have to continue to push this for as long as necessary to force Blizzard's hand. 
---
So you think Blizzard will step in and further damage ties with China just because the subreddit is being spammed?
---
I mean, if democracy also had a rule that said you get more votes per amount of people you've killed - then of course!
---
You're right, it does. I'm an Angry 'Hard Thing'.
---
Are you fucking kidding me? 6 days before that video, that's when the tape was recorded. 6 days after, this shit came out. That's why people don't believe a lick of it, not that it matters now, it's 5 demands, and NONE OF IT IS UNREASONABLE UNLESS THERE'S SHIT TO HIDE.
---
As for where's china in this? You can hear the it on the tape, china ordering the tightening against the withdrawal. You are asking where china's in the story? How about starting in 2003 culminating in 2014 when the NPC broke its 1 country, 2 system agreement. That's why I said you only started paying attention in june, cause you don't even know the gradual pushing of the envelope by the CCP. Do you know what the NPC did? Do you know WHY the umbrella is a symbol to the protest? Cause if you do, you wouldn't even be asking how china has been involved.  
---
Lam indeed does take order from CCP, as for the "independenists", wtf are you on about. There's only a handful of HKers that even want independent, majority of them just want the autonomy promised in the 1 country, 2 system, something that some americans are confused on thinking they want independence. And china would've indeed gunned down the city if they didn't worry about their own economy collapsing as well as destroying HK's infrastructure. 
---
Corrupt cop doesn't necessary equal china oppressing hk, did you read the entire reply?! I was spelling how your so called "manipulated media" only covered the stuff that DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE REDDIT FRONTPAGE. Compare that to the shit that pop up and Xinghua and similar networks, let's see which is more blatant in manipulating and twisting the truth. And do I have to spell out the sequence of events with the NBA? You know, the lead up with this mess with HS?
---
Haha, I was throwing many of my tavern brawl runs by multi-tasking on Reddit or Twitch. I also had a few other 10 minute runs that I forgot to screenshot, including the game before I finally got 9 minutes, where I got 10:56.
---
Oh yeah and the that weibo statement doesn't represent blizzard's official stance just because blizzard gave them the authority to speak on behalf of blizzard in china or something guys. And the reason blizzard wouldn't denounce that statement if it doesn't align with their views is....
---
I'm sure you'd like it to be so you can go back to burying your head in the sand. Sadly for you, that isn't the case. Go to r/competitivehs if you really want what you say you do. The mods have allowed the sub to continue to push this issue because it's important. You're welcome to leave if you don't agree.
---
You’re the one with the black and white view. Where did I say they hate free speech? I’m saying they are supporting the status quo by banning any politics. The status quo is massive human rights violations in China.
---
Damn dude. I suck at arena. My drafts are so weak. I swear my best is going 5-3 or something equally terrible.
---
Which is why they as a company want to be neutral, thus its a breach of contract to do this stuff.
---
Don't let the bullies win. Not China, not Blizzard, and definitely not these Tencent shills whose accounts were created recently because of this scandal.  
---
Ignore the trolls, because when it comes to human rights they couldn't care less, their hateful selfish opinions are much less valuable than human lives.
---
They do not want to be a platform for *other people's* political views. They will make political statements if they want to, but they don't want every random person with an opinion using their official streams to voice their personal politics.
---
Sure they raised their voices and they made a change but then they continued playing their games. Anyone who says they cancelled their sub is a lying keyboard warrior.

EXACTLY. If someone speaks for you and you don't make any kind of effort to say "hey that's not what I mean" it's because it is what you mean, you just let someone else say it for you.

Yeah, I tried using Togwaggle first, but it doesn't work. I tried Lazul yesterday and it clicked. First run was already a respectable 13 minutes.
---
Not what I said and is a severely reductionist view of the entire situation. Not taking that bait.
---
The mods have allowed this shit to happen because they can't mod. And competitive hs is about... competitive part of the game. It is not a place I would post replays of Renounce Warlock or show brawl beong completed in less than 10 minures, is it?
---
It's not possible for them to remain neutral anymore when they've already shown favoritism towards a particular political view.
---
I am young and naive but I never realized blizzard fanboys would be so willing to overlook so much stuff to forgive blizzard. Well shouldn't had expected better from people I guess
---
I apologized to target if you read the title ;) owo
---
To Blizzard: Us, your once faithful consumers, did not start this war, but we sure as hell are going to end it.
---
Agreed. It's nice to have a standard res priest that has solid threats and good cards that haven't been around for years.
---
It’s funny really, a company has the ability to take this stance at just the cost of money, a single person taking this stance could very easily forfeit their life. They are in the absolute most advantageous position to do these type of things.
---
But yah, they could lose like a billion dollars and still have many other billion dollars that makes an impossible amount, so can’t have that, gotta have that insignificant amount too.
---
you are a man, I randomly walked in on this, but I stand by you as a real man. 
---
Thank you for trying to inform this OP in a nice manner. 
---
I don't even play this game LOL.
---
Ahh, you don't agree with them so they're incompetent. Got it.   
---
Sucks for you then.
---
Then in the context of your post, what does "push this" entail and how would this force Blizzard's hand?
---
This belongs to r/trashy
---
Then the friend can reply with:
---
"The casters were fired because they knowingly allowed the rules to be broken."
---
"The AU team's punishment was decided by Tespa, not Blizzard Taiwan. A western faction of the company would judge things differently in this case. Furthermore, they likely did not want more backlash. This is an example of inconsistency compounded by multiple unfavorable variables, not hypocrisy."
---
"The rule I sent you applies to Hearthstone Masters participants, not Blizzard as a whole. Policial pandering, such as gay Overwatch characters and designated pride days can and will occur to help the game reach a wider audience."
---
Then the friend can add:
---
"Blizzard also restored Blitzchung's pay, reduced the ban length to 6 months, and restored his slot to Grandmasters (effectively making the ban obsolete). The casters can also be brought back within 6 months. Lastly, Blitzchung himself is still playing Hearthstone and is considering returning to Grandmasters. So, again, why should I quit playing?"
---
That's... actually a good idea. My guess is they would have to ban the person saying this, but no one has the balls to do it now since they've seen was Blizzard did to blitzchung. I'm guessing no one wants to banned from competing for 6 months. Also assign a flair.
---
Would competent mods allow karma whoring to continue for 4 days?
---
&gt; What is this comment even rooted in?
---
Did you even read title of this thread? lol
---
How odd that those of AU didn't get banned for doing the same thing. That's so very strange.
---
If you can't understand by now, another explanation won't help you.
---
It's been on the list of fastest growing subs for a while now, a lot of people start their posts with "I don't play hearthstone, but...". You are absolutely right
---
Have you considered that people actually care and aren't karma whoring?
---
Facts.
---
no you didn't have to. It's an asshole move, it's childish and you are only making some guys miserable work shift even more miserable.
---
No, Reddit. 
---
Your faux outrage did precisely fuck all on the international level.
---
However, you can claim victory in that you helped to overturn the overly punitive actions taken by Blizzard against Blitzchung. 
---
So, you have that going for you, which is nice.
---
This is BS Blizzard and it took you 3 days?
---
Fuck china.
---
Granted, they are 40% owned by Tencent, so how much that works in practice is questionable.
---
Barnes? Master Oakheart? Zerek's Cloning Gallery?
---
I think you are probably right, and I wouldn't blame them at all. It's a big ask to forfeit what is potentially one's main source of income.
---

---
A list of the type of card you’re looking for is in this entry, under “cards”.
---
4 same posts in a row. 8 same memes, despite rule 2. 10 repeating other memes. 6 posts about pseudo-linguist finding marsian influence in blizz writing. That is grade A karma whoring
---
We will always defend the dignity of our nation.
---
I thought voicing the opposing point of view is supposed to result in the same consequences.
---
Guess the Chinese didn't think of that when they were writing that poorly translated pile of garbage for Blizzard's President.
---
Lol, what the actual fuck are you spewing right now? Hong Kong has been brainwashed into preferring freedom rather than authoritarianism and tyranny?
---
I'm genuinely curious. Did people not know what was happening before the NBA or Blizzard situation? It had been on the frontpage of /r/all at least a handful of times. Plus it has been covered by the news in my country. I think the reason it gets so much traction now is that people feel there's an actual way for them to show their support for HK. 
---
It's been difficult helping HK, because no country or even company is in a position to stand up to them in a way that matter. Hopefully on a long term basis, with enough people caring we'll see things shift more rapidly. I think in a small degree we have seen it happening in some areas, but it's not as easy as "don't do business with China" for every company or country.
---
He's been answering random questions in his twitch chat. I don't think there were rooms for PR help. Also he sounded very genuine.
---
I saw your blue demon stripping. Noice!
---
China is just turning into one big season of Black Mirror.
---
"Today is Hong Kong independence..." Once again a slippery slope argument.
---
You're arguing the potentiality of more demands refutes his current demands.
---
"But sure, 'wHy dOn'T bLiZzArD jUsT sAy fUcK yOu cHinA, fReE hOnG kOng'. Life is that simple when you don't think about anything for more than 3 seconds before going on a moral crusade"
---
Once again a straw man argument. You take legitimate demands, reduce them to the point it's non reflective of his point of view then attack it.
---
You do realize it's possible to argue a point without logical fallacies right?
---
&gt;Well yeah because the end is the same. Either they don't release their game in China that has gay characters
---
You found the right answer!
---
Either your morals are resolute or they are up for sale. Blizzard's are up for sale.
---
&gt;as for the "lgbtq promotion when its profitable" part
---
It's an insult to everyone who actually fought for it to be acceptable in the west. That's why it's loathsome. Civil rights aren't something that should be embraced only when it's "hip" or profitable. You believe in them and their importance or you don't.
---
The hive mind is those who assume that every single person in North America is up in arms regarding this whole thing. 
---
I may be wrong, but from what I've seen over the last few days, people on Reddit seem to think the entire population of the Americas is ready to drop this company in its entirety. 
---
That is not the case. Those who are up in arms about this are the vocal minority. But looking at Reddit it seems as though everyone believes it. That is a hive mind.
---
I don't think capitalism is to blame for wealth inequality.  I also don't think america is really a true capitalist society.  However, the parts of capitalism we do have, I believe, are detrimental to our society at this point in time.  
---
IMO, the idea that freedom of business will solve all problems that have value is not how this system will ever function.  The idea that greed is good is not something I can get behind.
---
That wasn't my point. My response to the original comment was that we shouldn't be COMPLETELY ignorant of the world's problems. If people need a break, of course it's reasonable and I am not blaming anyone for it.
---
Blizzard going on war with China, duh.
---
Yes I did. You were wrong. Sorry fam.
---
I was just making a factual statement, you are ignorant and selfish.
---
Nice try.  This shit is hours old- You’re pathetic scanning comment threads trying to spot anything you can to pounce on. Away with thee, Troll. Crawl under another bridge.
---
I don't know where you're getting the idea that I am against a distraction or a break. I simply said, in response to the original post, that we shouldn't be completely ignorant of politics or pretend it doesn't exist.
---
Private Enterprise getting in bed with government *is* the endpoint for capitalism. That was Marx' entire point. That's why his book is called Dad Kapital.
---
All the communism stuff was just him spitballing. Economic fanfic. As far as his actual analysis goes, capitalism tends to aggregate capital, and at a certain point that capital corrupts functional government and you end up with fascism. Communism is a response to that process.
---
Until about 1985 or so he was spot fucking on.
---
Correct.  Google is just too dominant.  To the point where we very likely need federal intervention to deal with them.  You can't just boycott them.  They are within and behind so much of the digital infrastructure that you would seriously be hard pressed to disentangle them from your life, and the majority of people who are less tech-savvy would have no hope. 
---
The same way that back in the day, and even now, a boycott of Microsoft would be so difficult, because Windows is just a default for so many people in their lives and work.
---
It's not sticking. Pretty much everyone involved in streaming who has stepped down or has said they're no longer doing Blizzard stuff has stressed the same point. But pitchforkers gonna pitchfork.
---
Well, a ton of company can just not piss off the Chinese nor the Western part of the audience. It's pretty simple actually: 
---
You just censor it out from the Chinese feed, make an actual neutral tweet/comment or just don't comment on it, fire the casters as they did (because they were the ones dragging the company into this as they knew and endorsed it) and tell the player to not abuse their platform for his political beliefs next time and just to be sure, monitor the GM more closely.  
---
It's long, but it's not hard and pretty much a solved question. And the matches are on 45 min delay as an anti-cheat mechanism, so it's not like they can't spot it in time.
---
Truth
---
Capitalism is the sole reason as to why the western world is as rich as it is. Even the poorest people are rich in comparison to other parts. 
---
People who oppose capitalism dont care about the poor; they just hate the rich.
---
Get out of your hate bubble.
---
Most savage comment I’ve read
---
Yeah, I got the golden on my first run just by chance.  Not sure why they didn't have the rewards all listed out before hand.
---
Thanks. Was looking for this. This should be upvoted more.
---
Acitivision Blizzard is name of old Activision...
---
I honestly think that we are close to that reality.
---
There were questions asking him details about the movement like what does the slogan mean. He replied with "It would be too long of a lecture" and "I don't want to talk in details because you can Google it online and see for yourselves."
---
you're a dumbass dude.  I SPENT ALL THIS MONEY ON HS PACKS.. but im gonna disenchant everything..  Some stand bro.
---
&gt; A lot of awful stuff is happening every day all over the globe. There's ongoing genocides in Africa, atrocities in the middle east and China being awful isn't entirely new either.
---
I think part of the difference in reaction is that genocides in Africa are not going to impact Western lives. 
---
China's cultural war against Western/democratic moral values and forcing authoritarianism down everyone's throats will, and it already has, and will continue to escalate if left unchallenged.
---
It is the inevitable result of every system. So get a better argument against capitalism.
---
&gt; Of reproduction. We aren't talking about any other kind of reproduction aside from humans, where you require a fertilized egg to reproduce. 
---
Not initially. You just mentioned sex was for reproduction and you can't reproduce without particular sexual organs. I'm saying that that's not necessarily the case. But no matter, it wasn't particularly relevant in the first place.
---
&gt; You need a sperm, which is exclusively made by males, and an egg, which is exclusively produced by females, in order to create a human. 
---
Yes, which is different to a penis/vagina. Those organs may be involved in sex, but are not strictly necessary for reproduction. It's the gametes that are important.
---
&gt; What you've read on salon.com doesn't matter in reality where it is required to have a male produce sperm and a female to produce an egg.
---
Is salon.com your favourite hoster of scientific articles? I'm afraid I can't comment on it, as I haven't visited it and I get my scientific news elsewhere. Anyway, in reality there are people who are researching these topics, and in the future there may be humans that originated with "artificial" sperm and eggs.
---
I’m not the one automatically assuming someone is Chinese with a vehemently negative connotation. That’s on you, and you have to live with that.
---
Not my fault you got caught. Oh wait, it is.
---
They did this in English, outside of China.  The Chinese government gets to block the Western platforms which they put these up without people batting an eye. Within China the government gets to point at the statement up on NetEase as the latest official Blizzard statement.
---
Obviously, but semantically that region as we know it and it's history.
---
Everybody is cheering and upvoting this, when in reality they pulled sponsorship to avoid pissing china by getting in the middle of this quagmire.
---
R-o-t-fucking-l
---
under 40 is for the extra reward. No rewards under that.
---
I did an 11m 10s run and no change. I highly doubt under 10m would be different, as I was running the most broken deck possible mostly killing the bosses by turn 2/3.
---
The problem, old boy, is that you equate our systems with good, and the systems of non western countries with 'suffering'. Its rather chauvinistic, very American, and altogether not very helpful.
---
We need lasting impact on Blizzard and the NBA. Cancel your subscriptions, stop going to the games, stop watching them. If there is lasting impact then other companies will take heed and won't bow to the Chinese mafia.
---
LOL.
---
If I am not wrong King's Last year's revenue was 2 Billion dollars and judging from the trends it has almost paid off the amount it cost to acquire it. Why is it not earning its keep?
---
Are these up to date and the only demands? Article is from August, and I'm curious if something has changed since then.
---
Also, how unified in the demands are the protestors? Are there more "less important/popular"? Idk if that question is phrased super well, but I hope it makes sense.
---
You realize they pulled sponsorship to avoid pissing off china right?  They don't want to get involved in this quagmire.
---
That last paragraph is freaking beautiful
---
Literally killed the game. 
---
Randomly pulled the plug on the professional scene. Pro-gamers, streamers and casters all lost their jobs with the public announcement.
---
I think you all should stop demonizing a culture you don't understand.
---
That guy made a montage of Kaplan talking to make him say stuff. Pretty hilarious.
---
for me it makes no diference  netease employees  are  chinesse nothing wrong with them calling china  "our country "
---
Slag off, China.
