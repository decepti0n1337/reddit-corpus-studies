Can’t unsee that.

1 star. No deck that can use it; besides healing for 2 for 2 mana isn't how you kill opponents; to target a minion you need to have a minion first. If your game plan is killing with minions with +3/+3, then you don't put this card and a lot of healing spells in your 30 card deck.
---
Not really, they don't. They can present threats and stack enough damage to kill you in a turn or two. And priest really doesn't have strong board clears, so they can't do much about it.
---
I can see the resemblance,  except Ventura couldn't  do the kicks like Reno.
---
The average dust value of a pack is actually 100, so you'll be able to craft a bit more than that
---
Was thinking mage should be OP?
---
Yeah, I agree that it was an over the top reaction to say “Go through all that trouble” but I would rather play a more reliable card that won't clog my mulligan.
---
Yeah, I prefer this way, instead of requiring 2 legendary of a class in same expansion to make a archetype works
---
Not during League of Explorers. It had even less threats than before and games regularly ended in fatigue. Nowadays, there are at least some threats from Omega Assembly and Dr. Boom.
---
Its either Mech hunter or Mech warrior. That's about 90% of games.
---
California explicitly doesn't tax digital purchases. Probably because the tech giants are based there.
---
Lamp summons or puts Zinnar in your deck, and zinnar gives you wish cards at the end of your turn?
---
There are a lot of brick and mortar realtors who want Amazon to be forced to start collecting that tax saying it gives them an unfair advantage. It really is a screwy system.
---
But in the end Dr.Boom still won
---
Big true!
---
These comments are always so entertaining and exaggerated. You literally do not have to pay anything to play this game. It is a free game. If you pay money it is simply to get something faster. Saving up coins between xpacs gets you more packs than buying the preorders. Dust the cards you don’t need/duplicates and tada. You have enough shit to make atleast one top tier deck every xpac. For free. And you can play as much as you want. For free.

People are so entitled today. You seeiously want more out of something ** are getting for free**.

He's right though over the years theyve added so many cards that decide the game instantly based on rng, or draw rng if youre going there

---
From left to right: Warglaive of Azzinoth, Thunderfury, Shard of Azzinoth, and Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
and now rogue but hindsight is always 20/20
---
An infinite pre-nerf Fiery War Axe that doesn't cost a card and makes it so you don't take damage when you use it. It's like Odd Rogue but on super cocaine.
---
Would you even run questing explorer in this deck because you complete the quest so quickly
---
Maybe bring back the mid-range madness focus that describes early HS (all about good trades to vie for board control). Now it's about... Nothing. The game just doesn't feel like what HS meant to me as a card game that felt distinct from others. You know the game has probably changed for the worse when spells like Frostbolt and Flamestrike are too weak to compete at any time in like the last 2 years of the standard meta.
---
Additionally, remember when you used to hit top deck mode in HS? Running out of cards in hand before being dead is like a fringe case now, why did they allow the game to shift like that? Isn't it ridiculous no deck really dumps their hand anymore because the cards that actually see play have so much value that you'll never end up empty handed?
---
On that note, I hardly ever hit fatigue anymore in HS, which I think is tragic. Hitting fatigue used to be so fun, as you had just had a long game and it was coming to this climax with fatigue damage rolling through. Fatigue might as well not even exist these days since games are over at like 10 Mana and 15-11 cards left in the deck, and it shows how rushed games feel with these over valued cards deciding games super early.
---
Additionally, the entire concept of only being able to run 2 copies of a card in a deck but only 1 copy of a legendary is just awful game design, because it leads to high roll bs like Keleseth on 2 and Raza on 5 that makes my input into the game feel useless, which is an inherent flaw of all card games anyway due to the nature of random draws, but feels especially prevelant in HS because the game let's you use so few copies of cards compared to other games. When hs first came out it was fine because legendaries weren't too strong or highrolly, but new legendaries over time just feel bad to go against sometimes. Never hated Dr Boom (OG) but fuck Prince Keleseth (and not OG boom).
---
&gt; the reward is very strong.
---
How? We had this [this card](https://media.hearthpwn.com/avatars/339/764/62838.png) as a standalone and it definitely wasn't close to "very strong". 
---
You have to start down a card and run a bunch of burgle garbage for this? Not to mention I don't see how this reward has any synergy with a Burgle archetype. 
---
We need a viable way to buff its durability or gain extra copies. But even then, it doesn't seem "very strong".
---
Blink Fox doesn't in the mirror though.
---
It won't.  The google text looks like it's saying that shadowblade CAN make you immune while this CAN'T make you immune to the fatigue.  But the quest can make you immune over several turns.
---
... Oger
---
I don’t think it’s that great. Yes, Blink Fox and Hench are good cards, but you will never draw and play all those before turn 10. Yes, you can play things like Shadowstep, but quite often you need those minions on board to contest the board.  Especially if you’re wasting turn one playing a quest. You can’t afford to spend entire early turns doing nothing.
---
So, that means you have to run other crappier cards to get this effect more reliably. Making your deck worse overall.
---
If you commit to a heavier burgle package, you might as well run the life steal weapon at that point.
---
No prob, Rafaam
---
ppl say it op,i say it's ok.  
---
lock dk had better hero power which healed them and ignores taunts the only good thing going for it is to easy to activate in wild but in standard it might be ok
---
Wait until we see the full expansion. There may be more cards that enable the quest.
---
Hmm, pilfer t1, violet haze high roll t2, blinkfox t3...
---
Did nobody mention Crystallizer?
---
Turn one you play the quest and not a one drop, so don't think this quest is what thief rogue needs to win games

Fiery Win Axe is back!

Kind of anti-synergy with [[spectral cutlass]] but still a cool reward
---
Actually you would just not summon any minions, but you would still destroy 1, since its not transform.
---
Where’s breakfast.
---
Perhaps. But I did complete my daily quests thanks to him. If he ever wants to play again though I would love to. I had a lot of fun and that’s what hearthstone is all about :3
---
little bit late
---
No loss on tempo? A hunter would've 2/2 Mecharoo, 1/1 mech, 2/1 firework technician, SN1P by the end of turn 3 and this alone beats your tempo all the way till turn 4. I am not saying that what you played all the way to turn 4 is negligible against all decks, Mage for example does not play anything for the first two turns, but in no way I would call the turns you described "no loss in tempo."
---
Then it's not longer super easy if you're including bad cards like \[\[Bazaar Mugger\]\], making bad tempo plays like bouncing a Blink Fox, and using your Shark to steal cards, which might not be that great.
---
The quest reward is pretty great, but does Rogue benefit more from an upgraded Hero Power on turn 7 or from playing good cards and playing for as much tempo as possible.
---
i feel like you want to jam your deck full of a lot of bad cards that can help you get this reward quicker, that is how good getting this quest completed is. Violet haze, pharoah's cat, raven caller, Jay sealer. and of course pilfer, blink fox, henchclan burglar.

---
What? 2 mana 3/2 weapon have proven themselves to be 100% nutty.
---
I imagine that the original design was much lower (maybe draw 10 cards), however, reducing a card to 0 cost is very dangerous for combo potential (even if it isn’t reliable), so I imagine they had to nerf their plans very early on.
---
It still broken I think, I can 'devolve' enemy minion with this new effect. The best nerf is to remove the twinspell keyword
---
I think this will make a good tempo build because it gives you an unlimited supply of 3/2 weapons that can smack the opponent in the face.  It is better than Spectral Curtlass that was vulnerable to weapon removal.  There are already tournament tempo rogue decks out there running the thief package.  
---
Sometimes if you haven't won by turn 8 you run out of juice, this keeps going.
---
Can't win now. Concede is the only option

---
Already pissed at this. Oh well I will get over it
---
STICKEY FINGAAASS
---
Well, besides sacrificing one card in their opening hand, which rogue really doesn't want to do. Oh and you have to draw all 4 copies which is super unlikely.
---
This is a quest reward. Those are very different things.
---
I deleted my comment though, I didn't realize it was a Hero Power lol
---
Holy shit. Very easy to get, and it pretty much guarantees board control. I think its great.
---
Insanely overpowered. Really easy to complete, and the quest reward is insane.
---
Please repost this meme in a different format, as I cannot use my Bingo stamp with this list. Thank you for your understanding.
---
Upgraded Hero Power : Am I a joke to you?
---
See, he was just helping you out! ;)
---
I bet he'd love to play again, as soon as he wipes the tears from his eyes
---
It just needs to go to 5 mana.
---
Perfect fit in tempo rogue
---
So they made odd rogue strictly better and with less restrictions
---
That card isn't run at higher tier play anyway (at least enough to warrant comment), it's almost always far too slow.
---
OP too lazy to add description.
---
Quest: Add 4 cards from a different class into your hand
---
Reward Hero Power: 2 mana, equip a 3/2 weapon that makes your hero immune when attacking
---
Better yet, **whats** breakfast?
---
and don't forget that Blink Fox doesn't work against Rogues
---
would academic espionage work once drawn?
---
That’s actually a valid consideration, but I think you hard mulligan for it since it is so good.
---
Otherwise you get a 2/3, which isn’t horrible
---
Fanmade card Neltharion the Earth-Warder (later known as Deathwing) that says "the opponent is limited to one minion on board".
---
This isn’t overpowered at all.
---
Aladdin confirmed
---
In a vacuum this is better. In practical application within the context of the (likely) general meta, and the necessary deck limitations of throwing this in, the Priest quest still seems better.
---
Cutlass is barely played anyway in higher tier play, so this has a solid shot
---
Imagine having a gladiators longbow every turn
---
I think the priest one is great as well. I was mostly just talking about Rogue.
---
There are a few I think will see play. Priest for sure, Shaman as well.
---
It is 6 HP each turn (and 3 attack).... At some point in the game you won't have enough resource to beat it anymore. This is an insane win con though. Imagine casting this on top of Lifesteal minion everyturn and you can go through fatigue easily
---
Or destroy a 1 drop and getting two high costed  one.
---
To all the Priest mains saying that you were crying in the corner with Paladin, you can come out the corner now.
---
Putting it in quotes doesn't make it less racist
---
hey that's me, I agree it was unfair
---
Would have been interesting if giant mage and control warrior weren't 2 of the best classes. I tuned in a few times, saw it was C warrior mirror and just instantly closed the window. I dont need to see 45 min of draw, press, pass
---
Well at least they got the country right ^^I ^^think, unlike people using "chinese cartoons" to diss anime.
---
Wtf this quest make the warrior quest a joke lol
---
~~Picnic beside the Vir’naal~~ coffee shop near my office.
---
I think the hero power is very insane though.
---
Rogue finally getting to use the weapon to control board without worrying about al the face damage they take. I think this pushes thief rogue to a really good spot.
---
nice
---
After thinking about it more, this may be better for Tess decks over the Cutlass, as it means you don't have to run weapon synergy cards.
---
Rogue otherwise isn't a class that wants late game value, while running out of gas is a problem, that's much more likely to happen if you're removing gas in order to make this quest work.
---
The thief package works in Tempo Rogue, because cards like Hench-Clan Burglar, Blink Fox and to a lesser extent Vendetta and Underbelly Fence are playable without any synergies. This quest requires at least another 4 cards to work, which means you're making your deck worse for a reward that's probably not worth it.
---
This Quest needs one more really strong thief card in order to be relevant to the meta.
---
Blizzard: we rotated genn baku because of how the meta was and the power of the upgraded hp.
---
Also blizzard: give rogue unnerfed fuery war axe lol.
---
Don't worry. There wasn't any Dinomancy deck. It was all just a bad dream.

Where is the live stream happening? Youtube Twitch or somewhere else?

This post will probably be good in arena but won’t see upvotes anywhere else
---
yep, even if i drop $200 bucks on an expansion, i play a little Hearthstone pretty much every day, it costs me about $2 a day for 3 months (at least, but i play wild, so my cards and investment are always worth something to me) to play. Its nothing. Where as a big release game for ps4 i'll play through once for $80 bucks and it lasts me maaaybe a week.
---
Twitch, the PlayHearthstone channel.  Sidebar should link to it.
---
But some people get entertainment from discussion, I don't watch reviews to KNOW how good a card is in advance. Just to talk about the game and the possibilities. They not knowing for sure doesn't cancel anything.
---
Completely unrelated to the subject, but why do you have (at least one) Baleful Banker in your Mech Paladin deck?
---
it is ridiculously cheap, not everyone's supposed to afford an expansion on a f2p card game
---
I'm happy that I dust my wild cards every rotation because theres some awful cards I'm happy to leave in the past
---
Bro the anti synergy with spectral cutlas
---
One card wrong does not mean he reviews every card wrong. Kripp has his bad prediction as well. For example he said flash of light could be run in aggro decks even if novice engineer exists
---
Dude this does NOT belong here.
---
I was meming with a Mech Paladin that runs Baleful, Wrath, and Shirvallah at rank 5, funnily enough, it won me my second game with the deck
---
Everyone's big on the 6 damage and the thief rogue setup. I'm hype on the immune portion of the weapon. You can trade favorably in a class with weak healing. That's big, and I love it.
---
This has considerable counterplay too - it gets obliterated by aggro for example. OP just passed six turns in a row and let his opponent have free run of the board. 
---
Anyway why argue against salty fuckers?  You guys are right, mage is unbeatable and should be removed from the game!
---
I mean, it literally says "Custom 135 card expansion". Not sure how you can misunderstand this as 135 new cards with saviors of uldum.
---
Got her in my Boomsday pre order.
---
F
---
Lol wat
---
I think it's really easy to generate 4 cards from other classes as well. The thing is...in a mirror match it's going to be hard. If you face a rogue then chances are you're not going to complete the quest I feel.
---
I mean by that logic every combo is a 15+ card combo because of all the ca ds you play to cycle through your deck to get to the combo. If you haven't restored 15 health by turn 10 in that deck you're doing something wrong.
---
Actions per millennia?
---
None at least until Saviors of Uldum has been released and its effects on the format is allowed to be felt.
---
It's your fault for playing RANKED LADDER and expecting fun decks.
---
Why would that give 15 healing? Sorry, I'm a fairly new player and don't see how turn 2 heal would complete the quest
---
Thanks🙏
---
None of these are powercreep
---
"kudos"
---
You could just run [[Swashburgular]] to pull a patches turn 2 and be perfectly fine
---
Ah can't run it in a Tesspionage deck since you need the lifesteal weapon :(

1/1/1 Pirate | Battlecry: Add a random card to your hand (from your opponent's class).  
---
Going from top left to bottom right vertically:
---
1. The two extra health on Destroyer is enough to make it just a trade off compared to Reborn
---
2. A neutral 4/4 isn't necessarily worse than a class restricted 3/5 with Taunt
---
3. The mana costs of the cards are too different
---
4. The Flunky is class restricted and the statlines of both cards are incomparable for their mana costs
---
5. The cards really aren't comparable as one being directly stronger than the other. They can be seen as a 4/5 that restores four for five and the other as a 3/5 minimum that restores six for six.
---
6. Those card do not exist in the same class.
---
7. Taking the body away from a minion's battlecry and reducing the cost hasn't resulted in a good spell yet. See Rebuke and Loathed.
---
8. Obliterate's not even a collectible card.
---
9. How is a four mana class card even comparable to a two mana neutral one?
---
Obsidian Destroyer and Wrapped Golem.
---
Generally speaking, I agree. Wrapped Golem is the stronger card. *And* it's Neutral, that's also a big deal. However, Obsidian Destroyer was not good enough to see play. Is the original Dr. Boom power creep over War Golem when War Golem never saw play? I wouldn't say so.
---
___
---
Stonehill Defender and Frightened Flunky.
---
1 Less stat for 1 less Mana is an excellent bargain for the Flunky, but it is a class card, and it is by no means *strictly* better. This isn't a good example of "power creep," when both are more than good enough to see play, and the inclusion of Flunky in the same meta as Stonehill Defender would be *nowhere near* enough to make the Defender unplayable. It can't be, Stonehill Defender was a fantastic addition in more than just Warrior decks.
---
King Mosh and Plague of Wrath.
---
This isn't power creep, this is Plague of Wrath possessing the utility of King Mosh without the 9/7 body. I think Plague of Wrath is *stronger* without a doubt, that doesn't make it power creep. The same way Play Dead is not power creep over Terrorscale Stalker.
---
Arcane Tyrant and Anubisath Defender.
---
This is again not an instance of power creep. "Class card" arguments aside, it's pretty clear to me that the Anubisath Defender is the stronger card. But so what? **Both of them would see play in a deck that would want to run either of them.** The fact that both of them aren't accessible in the same Standard meta just means that neither card contributes to a straight-busted deck.
---
Rotten Applebaum and Kharhut Defender.
---
You're off your head if you think this is "power creep." Kharhut Defender is good, but it's not *that* good. It's arguably worse than the Applebaum. 
---
Obliterate and Riftcleaver.
---
How come Plague of Wrath is "power creep" over King Mosh but apparently Riftcleaver is "power creep" over Obliterate? Obliterate is the utility without the additional cost and body attached, just like Plague of Wrath is the utility without the additional cost and body attached. You're being contradictory here - it gives the impression that you've made this thread just to whine, and that you're not willing to think rationally.
---
More so when you consider that Obliterate is a Death Knight card and is immensely powerful. A big differentiation between Obliterate and Riftcleaver is that Riftcleaver gets to be printed as an actual collectable card - and it gets away with that *because it costs 6 Mana.* Obliterate is too flexible and too powerful of a card to be added to any class, which is why it is accessible as a Death Knight card instead.
---
The bottom line being that neither of these cards are really comparable.
---
Saronite Chain Gang and Tomb Warden.
---
This is not power creep, rofl. They are extremely different. Hell, Tomb Warden is nearly double the stats for exactly double the Mana. That doesn't make it "power creep." Being so different in cost and statline makes them incomparable.
---
Reincarnate and Wretched Reclaimer.
---
See the whole "utility without additional cost and body" points being made with King Mosh+Plague of Wrath/Obliterate+Riftcleaver. Reincarnate is more accessible at 2 Mana than Wretched Reclaimer is at 3. And sure, a 1 Mana 3/3 on top of a Reincarnate sounds pretty good.
---
Except Wretched Reclaimer belongs to Priest where Reincarnate belongs to Shaman, and the one time Reincarnate saw any amount of significant use was when Shaman could combo it with Kel'Thuzad - an **eight** Mana card, something Wretched Reclaimer couldn't combo with.
---
So again, not even comparable.
---
Hench-Clan Hogsteed and Restless Mummy.
---
Not even comparable once again.
---
Shitpost ^(3)/10. You made a decent effort and the formatting is good, but man did you overreach far too much for this to be an appreciable post.
---
this is really the first case as such
---
we usually don't get cards that synergize with anything out of standard unless it's a horrifically broken interaction that clearly slipped through the cracks (a la naga giants), i'm guessing this is the first set designed with both wild and standard in mind
---
i'm not complaining, since wild is a substantially more fun and unpredictable format, and the top dogs don't seem to be getting many toys this time around
---
Outjerked, yet again.
---
That classic power creep of *checks image* paying a different mana cost for some of the same stuff but also some different stuff at the same time.
---
Or you can just play standard.
---
Mech Hunter...egh... -. -
---
Dynomatic is also crazy busted. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher.

I was expecting that give rogue some combo card.
---
No matter where you go in card games, if winning maters at all, you are going to find Spikes.
---
Plus, changing the Big Red Button like that can itself be seen as a nerf.
---
It's probably cheaper to go play a cheaper side of an MtG standard deck than a HS deck. Especially considering you can target purchase Mtg.
---

---
Yeah bud that's the joke.
---
Yes he got cards wrong, just like every other card reviewer does. If you dont want to watch trump reviews that fine. But out of all hearthstone content creators kripp is no where near as good as predicting cards as others. And if you want proof look at trump's newer reviews. He got most right
---
Always the correct move. Don’t let anybody tell you otherwise.
---
Oh fuck I dont wanna deal with this
---
Worst quest ever
---
I think a better comparison here would be Barnes. Barnes wasn't nerfed either, and only really worked/works in big priest.
---
Paladin can still easily just PYro + Equality that.
---
And play water downed, incomplete decks ? No.
---
I would say For the Alliance but no one on the alliance really cares.
---
\[\[Pharaoh Cat\]\]
---
It wouldn't complete it it would just count towards the quest.
---
You definetely need Dorian in this deck.
---
Inconsistent? Unheard of!
---
[deleted]
---
OP missed that too, so by association you are calling OP an idiot. Rude.
---
ZULULUL
---
Nomi priest?
---
Wouldn't Wretched Reclaimer be more of a powercreep on Terrorscale Stalker than Reincarnate? 
---
Also you can't really claim that higher cost cards are powercreep on cheaper ones, their cheapness lends them advantage in being played more easily.
---
Hmmm, interesting, I also love when I get my face busted by a conjures calling mage that has the same problem of not having enough clears
---
Hey I'm very new to deck building, and I just kinda threw this together. Any ideas to make it better, maybe more spells? idk Thanks!

---
I don't think the rules have ever really been consistent, despite what certain pretentious hearthstone redditers say.
---
If you go to arena the only one losing to 5 copies of it in a deck will be you
---
Yep that's mostly it. 
---
(actually, the "Play" mode is divided between Standard and Wild, Wild being a format in which Expansions never rotate out and where all cards from all Expansions can be played ; but the powerlevel of the deck there is extremely high and the decks are usually quite hard to craft since they require legendaries from old expansions. I advice that you stay in Standard for starters ;) )
---
This is wrong. 
---
On play effects (like auras) happen before the battle cry. It’s one of the most common HS interactions that people get wrong.
---
Neither do you.
---
2 mana, add a wait this isnt actually that good to your hand
---
0 mana twinspell, deal 3 damage to an opponents minion. this card is treated like a weapon instead of a spell, while you hold this card you can hold 11 cards and can no longer use your weapon slot.
---
Omg mage practice is forever stall board
---
Ye. Typhoon mage is a tiny bit OP atm.
---
Could be Tyrande. In WC3 she was kind of a hunter.
---
Day one golden craft thief rogue tier 2 finally
---
I mean just run cheap board clears or out-tempo the shaman. If they run out of steam before you do, they’re toast every time.
---
I'm glad I did not buy this expansion. Heck I'm glad I didn't buy the last two expansions. 
---
The last expansion I genuinely enjoyed was Wrath of the old gods. Everything that came after that was either mediocre or complete shit.
---
We currently have the most and best burgle rogue cards available and even the tempo decks include them in their strategy, for vendetta reasons. I have absolutely no doubt that that kind of deck will be tier 2 or at least at the top of tier 3.
---
Are you sure? Maybe it only counts once the quest was played.
---
&gt; It was a neutral card that could be (and was) used by nearly every class.
---
Not at all, only Warlock made a good use of it. If the class didn't get an insane stall in Kobolds, Naga would still be unnerfed by now.
---
What's proven is that it's unreliable. If Priest could just casually draw their deck with one combo every game, it'd be top tier.
---
It's really good but it antagonizes [spectral cutlass] which is one of the only reasons that burgle rogue was able to survive. This is probably something that will see play in a tempo rogue that runs some burgle cards.
---
Launch. But it's probably best to do it the day before to be safe.
---
Probably because their financial analysts have realized that a low power level doesn't sell well.
---
Except that pw shield can be the last card in your deck and it's better put to use cycling and giving you better trades against aggro than being saved for the combo, the quest starts in your hand so you're guaranteed to have it, and restoring 15 health in priest is easily done before turn 10.
---
So is every other card in the game....
---
Oh its definitely insanely strong tempo wise, just saying it might also open up control decks and not just strengthen tempo
---
Unpopular opinion the problem is mountain giant not cc. Cc just amplifies the problem but isn't the cause
---
So this is just a little off-meta warrior deck I threw together using a few new Uldum cards. It is almost entirely Enrage-type synergy, with cards like Mad Bomber and a multitude of whirlwind effects that can be used in conjunction with both Plague of Wrath and to damage your own minions, which can spiral out of control fast with cards like Frothing Berserker and Gurubashi Berserker. Let me know your thoughts!
---
Yeah, it's completely stolen IP. Look at the first 30 seconds of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcLMiewpqnE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcLMiewpqnE) and have a look at the descriptions for the heroes.
---
I mean, nomi priest WAS top tier for a while, until Warrior found a way to counter it, but that was a 2tk, and this is an otk. Also mechathun priest was tier 1 for almost an entire expansion. They both used the same draw engine, and it was plenty reliable in both of those decks.
---
You can literally play at the same time stop complaining! Go to a fireside gathering or host one yourself and play for yourself. You’re such a crybaby
---
In all other cases double battlecries did  ot let anything resolve inbetween (like triggering deathrattles or secrets).
---
So it should work imo.
---
It was +2/+2 but still, yeah
---
Warlock used it the best, but I've seen the giant package in every class besides Druid (since combo Druid was just stronger on average, and could counter it with poison seeds)
---
Almost as if Mountain Giant enables that sort of cost reduction with no counter play (as opposed to Sea Giant where you can kill off minions to increase its cost).
---
And Pilffer
---
If your deck contains no duplicate, add a Wish to your hand?
---
I'd like to think they will all make an appearance. Then hopefully as paladin we get to play as Karl against George for some nice little Easter eggs.
---
Or when they nerfed Patron? Or freeze mage?
---
You're not sacrificing a card anymore than you are for every other card in the game. Mountain Giant sacrifices a card in your hand too.
---

The coin is good as it is.

No they didnt, but they 4 are the posterboys/girl, for one of the most ruthless organizations on azeroth the [Explorers League](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Explorers%27_League), were you get forcefully displaced from your home when somebody finds a piece of clay with titan runes on it.
---
Well deserved for recording your screen with a cellphone.
---
Yeah it's obviously not as sweet,  but its exciting because honestly this really helps a tess deck. I don't think it will be tier 1, but tess rogue is already a deck that is legend viable and it just got better.
---
Got the quest. Scarybyte#2255 EU Server. Please go first, but happy to show.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPAsYTzi-iI
---
That's true.
---
I wasn't kidding when I said I don't really play hearthstone, I primarily play single player adventures at this point.
---
I love the aesthetic of the hero and would use it if I ever play ranked or arena or anything but it still bothers me that heroes aren't available outside of these timed gates, and especially such an expensive one.
---
You had your chance.
---
I know the feeling, I've never spent a real-world cent on the game and it can be frustrating when you're new. 
---
You're not wrong- most decks you'll see on the ladder have better cards overall than the deck you posted, but I wouldn't give up just yet. I didn't have a single legendary for a long time, but you don't need rare cards to be competitive- just cards with more synergy. 
---
Look up a few budget decks online and look for the ones you already have some of the necessary cards for. True to their name, most of these use cheaper cards and only include a few rares or epics, if any. It shouldn't take you long to earn enough dust to build one of these. 
---
I wouldn't normally recommend disenchanting other expensive cards for dust, but when you're just starting out it doesn't hurt to sacrifice one or two you don't think you'll use much. If that buys you 5-6 of those "key" cards and helps make you competitive faster, I think it's totally worth it. 
---
I know it sucks getting 'sploded by Dr. Boom all the time, but with just a few additions I think you'll fare much better. PM me if you want my HS tag, I'd be happy to play anytime. I'm no Trump, but I've played a LOT of mage, and I've picked a few things up over time.
---
Most earlygame cards are pretty bad if you don't have them earlygame. And you don't complete this quest until probably turn 6-7 at the earliest unless you're making a deck without winconditions. With a lot of other classes (every?) lategame will once again be a lot more competitive, and only having the quest will not be enough.
---
FourKA#21639 NA - 80G quest trading, I show, you go first
---
Warrior: aww look at that 14/14 edwin, what if I told you I can clear it with one card that I can generate over and over again?
---
Not until amazon gives 30% coons back
---
probably not, judging of the fact that Skulking Geist hits 1 Mana Spells even if they are discarded, so those kind of "spell in your hand" interactions seems to go off the original cost. Draw a Twisting Nether with Tome of Origination and you´ll still get a 8 Mana Minion I think
---
People playing casual LUL
---
Thats a 9 mana Yogg-Saron!
---
Bill Cypher is it you?
---
yeah, It looks more like druid colours than paladin
---
My favourite kind of karma farm is one that talks about karma farms.
---
It just sucks since i'm having tons of fun actually playing the game and feel that i'm OK at it, but I have no idea what makes a deck "good" and how to make one. I HATE using premade stuff in games like this, though I guess i'll have to use a deck I find online instead of making my own. I do have a couple legendaries I don't think i'll use, maybe i'll dismantle them for some L̶e̶g̶e̶n̶d̶a̶r̶y̶ ̶S̶h̶a̶r̶d̶s̶  Dust.
---
And then lose in the end. The only way to torment warrior is by roping them every single turn and never conceding, eventually either he wins or he runs out of time and has to concede
---
I understand where you're coming from, but I think it's way too hard to heal 15 health fast enough for the admittedly insane effect to be relevant for the kinda deck you need to build to make it work.
---
Tortollan Primalist is (potentially) better if you are a brand new/budget player and haven't been able to craft high rarity spells that you'd still be interested in playing, such as Pocket Galaxy.
---
Can confirmed, 9 = almost 10
---
Upvoting because I was going to post the exacly same thing, both in requirement and in reward!
---
That's not a fair assessment of the context of Naga nerf. 
---
Was Naga meta warping? Yes. 
---
Was it used by EVERY class? Hell no, only Warlock could somewhat consistently utilise it and there were some Naga Hunters, but that's it. 
---
Was Wild meta "simply Naga Giants regardless of class"? Not even during the peak of it were numbers of Naga Warlock really big, even VS Reports and other meta reports highlighted, that it was more of a Boogeyman of a ladder - not very common, but if you meet it, you just lose on turn 5. 
---
Tldr: Only Naga Warlock was meta warping deck, but even during its peak numbers were not particularly big.
---
Sheriff here, Mr_Jeeves is mafia. 100% confirmed, hang me after if wrong.
---
I'm supposed to be explaining that?
---
Imagine calling lunas galaxy turn 5 into phaoris turn 6 bad. Or straight up phaoris turn 10 with a bunch of big spells in hand.
---

---
The combo is Webweaver, Tundra Rhino and Zul'Jin.  Deck should be played as follows:
---
1. Draw your deck as fast as possible while protecting yourself.  Don't use tracking unless you're vs. aggro or you got two parts of the combo. 
---
2. Discount Tundra Rhino with Webweaver.  Make sure Subject 9 and Hunter's Pack beast is not in hand.
---
3. Play Tundra Rhino into Zul'Jin.  If you played 2 Animal Companions and 4 Unleash the Beasts, that should be at least 30 damage + 3 weapon damage and your Deadly Shots and Multi-shots will clear some board for you.
---
4. Good luck with the Warrior's remaining 20 armor.

I don't understand why can't they make rectangular part of the card a class color like for all other cats? Weapons have unique border anyway, so I don't think it will be that hard to mix them up with other types of cards
---
If coldblood was reverted then wild would be fucked. Odd rogue is already the top wild deck right now.
---
Is this card is actually good enough to potentially make blade flurry playable again?
---
I agree with your overall point, but don't you mean 6 damage over 2 turns?
---
... and why not simply use existing class colors?
---
e.g. *paladin* weapons are brown which is a *druid* color.
---
Came for this
---
Yeah, 4 SUCKS, I hate it. I really wanted Control Paladin to be a thing in Rastakhan's....
---
We got 2 good combo decks so that was okay but there wasn't a heal Control Paladin which was saddening...
---
Then they nerfed Equality
---
That was awful.
---
By the way, the Hunter combo costs 8, unless you mean discounting both with 1 Galvanizer tick or 1 with 2 ticks. Or Mechwarper in Wild? The 6/6 is better but Equality Consecration would allow you to keep a board for cheaper in the past to be fair. That said though, on an unrelated note, the Missile Launcher+Venomizer is actually really good to play against IMO. It kinda means I can't immediately win board back and have it permanently against aggro, and it adds another skillful form of playing around it, saving minions, knowing how to commit and when to, trying to bait out Venomizers early on, etc. But it does suck to lose to one of the pieces topdecked....
---
I know now where to go when I want some “instafuns”
---
Missing cards are Pressure Plate x1, Desert Spear x2, Hunter's Pack x1, Scarlet Webweaver x1.

Don’t forget 1 mana reborn cat could easily give class card, also 5 mana rush ogre is great as well.

---
Nah, lacks mustache.
---
Who won?
---
Well if there was something inherently wrong with giants then they would be played in more decks.
---
I'm ok with CC on ladder. It really needs to highroll 3 cards.
---
What they really need to do with CC is ban this card from arena. That card solely ruin all fun.
---
Immune can sometimes be better lifesteal if not equal if if all your doing is hitting minions.
---
I think the quest weapon is better than cutlass. I just think the quest reward is quite underwhelming. I don't know why but I was expecting something different.

&gt; I don't think you're ever unhappy if you get this randomly,
---
I am literally never sad when Wrapped Golem is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card
---
I mean just because they are paying a team to design cards doesn't mean that others can't come up with ideas that are just as good, if not better. I didn't even come up with an idea here so much as just a small change that would make a big difference to the power level and viability of the card. Maybe they did think of this too but in testing decided it was too powerful. I don't think it would be just by going from my intuition of knowing the game very well.
---
I'd really like to see this come back soon with truly random decks (generated with the algorithm that makes random decks in Dalaran Heist, which ensures you have a few low-cost minions).
---
Even without multi-Patches, forcing deck themes means pirate warrior and silver hand paladin are going to dominate randomly-assembled slower decks, and that gets old fast.
---
Old quest rogue was literally completely built around the quest, or did I miss when Bounce Rogue was tearing up the ladder before the quest released?

not sure, they come off as annoying and childish to a lot of people I guess. then they'll just downvote you. just thought I'd let you know!
---
I’m gonna assume one of the decks is hunter.
---
Except you do because the card costs 10 mana! For a 10 mana card to be powerful it needs to do one or more of the following:
---
1) proactively deal with the opponents board (eg. Yogg, clearing the board or deathwing)
---
2) create a powerful board that sets up counter lethal and/or helps defend via having strong taunts in there (eg. Nzoth with deathrattle taunts)
---
3) be reliably cheated out for less mana than the cost (eg. Sea giant, y'shaarj via barnes or just in druid bc of ramp) '
---
4) win the game. eg. Meca'cThun
---
An instant board filled with 1-4 drops for 10 mana is really not very impressive at all. Exotic mountseller can already do the same thing for 10 mana and doesn't see any play (eg. you can play it with sorc and get a board full of beasts) - and Vex Crow does it for 2 drops and occasionally sees fringe play in Mage and again is much cheaper to do.
---
Aside from Mage also where you are randomly generating spells quicker than you can play all of them, every other class is going to be wanting to use their spells before 10 mana to stay alive.
---
I’d actually say Trump’s card reviews are one of the only ones that are worthwhile. Anyone can look at Madam Lazul (Priest Legendary discover a card in your opponents hand) and say ‘that card is good’ - but what is that worth if it never finds a deck to fit into? 
---
Instead, Trump looks at that card and says ‘it clearly has a strong effect but I just don’t see it fitting into any of the strong Priest decks this expansion’. That kind of analysis is worthwhile.
---
Furthermore, as the OP alluded to, Trump’s rating system is the only one that can be objectively judged. Once again, anyone can look at Madam Lazul and say ‘Wow, that effect is nuts, 5 stars’, then after the card sees no play they would say ‘Well it’s still an insane card, it’s just not it’s time’. There’s no way to go back and evaluate ‘Is Madam Lazul *really* a 5 star card?’ without setting exact parameters for what a 5 star card is.
---
Trump does that. He rates a card 2 stars and it’s a very specific prediction that it’ll see some experimentation the first couple weeks but end up getting cut from all the top decks before the meta starts to settle. You can go back and definitively verify whether that prediction was correct, which is something you can’t do when someone says ‘Yeah, cards alright, 3 stars’ with no other context.
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
Why don’t they hall of fame the fucking mountain giant and sea giant. 5 years later people are getting tired of still losing to these cards.
---
[Cries in Forbidden Words]
---
why? its not even that strong
---
One
---
2
---
The bigger issue than its slowness is how devastating weapon removal is, and that weapon removal is common in the meta.
---
Before prep nerf you wouldn't have needed the coin.
---
Blizzard thought of this.
---
Quite a neat idea. I won't make a fuzz about how one deck is gonna e way stronger than any other, cause that was always a given. However, I would suggest instead of having "randomized" decks built around a theme, instead have a bunch of pre-made decks instead. There were games where I couldn't do anything because of either 1. I didn't have the card for that turn or 2. Even when I did, that card sucks.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Another idea for a rework is to have players construct the deck and the loser equips the deck that beats them. ~~That way people can netdeck without effort.~~
---
Star Aligner is where you use the new priest legendary and japetto/spirit some cheap star aligners into your hand.  Not as likely as just using the new legendary to APM some 7 health boars but it has style.  
---
The Elise one seems interesting as thanks to Floop, Elise, Barista, Gloop, and Bees you can set up multiple different win conditions in one turn.  Hell Gonk becomes a game winner in the event you don’t want to just Maly someone out.  
---
There’s also making a pair of 5 cost King Krushes with 16 attack each (Emeriss) though that will probably not work as well.  
---
None of these should be gimmes, but there feels like more of them compared to the past.  Definitely comparable to toggwaggle/hakkar.
---
Elder Scrolls Legends has the coin as a seperate button instead of a card in your hand. It can also be used three times on seperate turns which I think is pretty imbalanced. At least it would be for Hearthstone.
---
OMG, I spilled my soda xD
---
We’re still yet to see the rest of the cards, all 135 will be out by 2/3 pm today. So far it looks like Hunter and Warrior will continue to be good, but we won’t know for sure until the first few days of the new expansion
---
Wait, **you** bring him back? What did you do, add an enemy minion that died this game to your hand? You already ruined the combo!
---
I'm actually not sure the healing from a lifesteal cutlass is going to be better than the reduced damage from immune-while-attacking weapon-based removal.
---
Good stuff but nothing from the past few expansions seem to have the wow factor like death knights or the old gods did
---
Is there any reference I'm missing? Or it's simply a Kibler compliment?
---
No idea why someone would downvote this
---
Well, it just so happened that this meta there wasn't one clear top deck (more like 2~3 clear top decks, not that it's all that different...), but it's hardly unheard of historically, e.g. when Raza Priest was absolutely nuts and more or less perma-banned in tournaments, and I believe the same happened at the peak of Cubelock?
---
..still not have basic quality of life mechanics like achievements, rearranging deck slots, auto-squelch, etc.
---
This expansion is turning out to look pretty damn exciting so far
---
I mean, better than a board full ready to attack.
---
Yuck browser games.
---
I'm ready to get wowed by all the legendaries in the reveal stream and to aggressively overlook the lowkey broken common in the Facebook dump
---
I guess it will be the other highlander card, that is still missing
---
Is it easy to complete though?
---
* Turn 1 Quest
---
* Turn 2 \[\[Questing Explorer\]\]
---
* Turn 3 \[\[Blink Fox\]\] (provided you don't play the mirror)
---
* Turn 4 \[\[Hench-Clan Burglar\]\]
---
* Turn 5 \[\[Bazaar Mugger\]\]??
---
* Turn 6 now and you're still not done lol. And this is with the PERFECT curve.
---
I think people are overhyping this quest.
---
People are forgetting that sometimes it's even a pain to activate Vendetta, and somehow think it's super easy to do that 4x to complete the quest lol
---
Have an upvote from me, so little Timmy can have one more slice of bread.
---
Remember when Kibler burned Guldan? Hope that doesn't happen again this time!

4/4/3 Pirate | Battlecry: Discover a spell from another class.  
---
Yes, I know. I'm saying, the existence of Shrink Ray meant that imo we were not going to get a replacement. And yes, I do think the same as a sort of a pet "theory."
---
I think that’s only true if the meta involves a lot of high-attack minions or weapon removal. Otherwise the cutlass will out-heal most damage you take. If anything the cutlass’ biggest weakness is that it has to be run in a full thief deck to get enough charges, and those decks aren’t viable. This just needs the thief cards rogue runs anyway
---
How can people ITT possibly think this card rivals Zilliax? This card is nowhere near as good and is certainly NOT an auto include in decks. Could see it being very good in Rogue, shudderwock and possibly conjurer mage though.
---
Then the priest plays Gruul.
---
I liked the brawl because it was something completely different from what we've had recently. However, I think following deck-building rules and having more random cards instead of forced synergies would have made the meta less stale a day in.
---
Holy fuck, I've played this game daily since Naxx and though I never packed any Star Aligners I couldn't understand why it was so bad (rather than just regular bad) and saw no play in any decks.
---
However you've just made me realize that it isn't minions with 7 or more health, it is minions with only 7 health... Damn that is reeallllly bad!
---
Thank you, kind ser.
---
This one particularly was a lucky match but it’s been pretty consistent as disrupting their conjurer combos. Only times I’ve really had trouble are when they get multiple freeze turns in a row and I don’t draw mass hysteria
---
It's only a matter of time at this point. It's one of the few remaining OG finishers. At least Bloodlust and Savage Roar require a board
---
&gt;What is the weapon really worth? A war axe with an effect is about 3 mana and you get it for 2 AND it's a hero power so it's like a persistent card in your hand. That's quite good.
---
But you can't have it on turn 2, which is where war axe was so broken.
---
Now that I look at it, Hunter's Pack doesn't exactly specify what kind of secret and weapon. Another bad thing about the English language.
---
I'm positive I've read the first sentence of your response in another thread, years ago, probably for a similar card, in a similar class.  
---
Also, most of the original quests where not that great.  Warrior and Rogue were tops.  Mage and Priest saw play, but the rest of the quests only saw a smattering of usage.  This card has almost no drawback in most, already existing Rogue decks, and even adding some "lesser" card generators isn't that bad since you start the game with this!  
---
I remember how little this community thought of the original quests.  I was there and I thought the same thing too.  I don't plan on repeating my mistakes.
---
His opponent can concede at any point he wants.

Noice!

Toight!
---
Shit even secrets.
---
If void contract became a somewhat playable card it would just completely shut down all combo decks cause then every controllish type warlock would use it.
---
Right now its what the card should be, a good meme deck and nothing else.
---
Didn't they take a dip over the past year financially?  I guess that might explain it.

---
Trumps reviews have been hilariously off the mark, and I think that’s part of the fun. Of course he’s going to misrate cards, and of course decks will pop up that he didn’t predict. 
---
All I’m saying is the rating system he uses is strictly codified and defined ahead of time so that we (and he) can go back and *definitively* determine just *how wrong* (or right!) he was. You can’t do that when someone uses a star system as a vague heuristic. 
---
My point is that because Trump defines *exactly* what each rating means, his predictions are some of the most valuable because he can conclusively determine a measurement of how good/not good they were. Not because they are always right or even right more often than other reviewers, but because they are **concrete**.
---
Don’t forget trashing everyone who isn’t kibler
---
Did you even once played this card in your life? It's not as good vs combo as you think.
---
It would look atrocious and compete with the card art in visual hierarchy.
---
I don't think you need to say it's a stretch. I really don't play warlock very much so my opinion probably doesn't have too much value
---
I agree, and I wonder if they could have held off a little longer until the "buff patch", maybe they would have put Shrink Ray to 4 instead of Equality to 4.
---
Cutlass also dies to weapon removal.  This doesn't.  You just have to spend 2 mana again.  
---
I've played with cutlass off and on.  It's fantastic when your opponent can't do anything about it.  If they just randomly have a swamp ooze it can really ruin your game plan.
---
I was wondering about this. I noticed the schedule for card reveals on the website only goes up to yesterday. Are they revealing the rest of the set today?
---
I play some really stupid mill warlock deck in wild and I play it a lot. It sucks but to answer your question: yes, Ive played the card a lot and even crafted it golden 2x
---
They meant that the quest reward is an instant hero power upgrade, rather than a card you have to play to get the reward effect.
---
? You play with an unreleased card? 
---
I'm talking statistics here. So far there's 8 neutral + Rogue Reborn cards revealed and only 3 cards that count towards this quest. Assuming every class gets one Reborn card, the maximum chance of getting a card that works for the quest without knowing the rest of the reveals is 50%, and you can safely assume there are neutral Reborn cards yet to be shown. 
---
Pharaoh Cat is most likely going to have a sub 50% chance to generate a useful card, and its attractiveness as a 1-drop is undermined by the quest needing to be in play before dropping Pharaoh Cat.
---
mainly because many of the cool cards are epic or legendary. Everytime there is a "fun" card revealed, I am expecting that purple or golden button.
---
Wild is another story completely, I'm talking about standard.
---
Yeah I genuinely thought this was neutral the first time I saw it, the border it pretty hard to notice
---
Druid?
---
Well boys, this might very well be a free craft! Nerf incoming, enjoy it while you can! A few weeks of being OP, then we get our dust back. : )
---
But my point is, that if this card ever becomes 5 mana or something like that it just has a risk of instantly shutting down a deck archetype and that is something that shouldnt be risked
---
lol who actually buys these trash mobile games?
---
with this mage deck, u will get this start 1 every 50 games so let him have his fun
---
This is u/wpwpw131's deck list
---
Just so you know it’s common courtesy to link your post, it’s hard to expect others to search for your post
---
Kibler did Great.
---
Nope. Wall priest is good past rank 5, but warrior does usually still win.
---
It's also half of a Justicar effect for free. I'll take an eventual face heal hero power upgrade for 1 mana in any of my priest control decks
---
Happy baked sweet soft frosted bread day!
---
Yeah, no. This would be so goddamn OP in druids.
---
He also had to play a naked giant right?
---
3 mana: give all minions Reborn then destroy all minions.

Wasn't this on custom cards reddit?

Yes, just like spells compete with creatures in a horrible ways
---
Hot dog!
---
It actually does, as there isn't another identifier attributed to it. If they had broken each part up to say something like, "a random Hunter Beast, a random weapon, and a random secret" then you'd be correct.
---
When all classes have a tier 2 deck . Tier 2 is not that impressive

---

---
Question: why you?
---
especially if the card is a priest card, just say how much more obnoxious big priest will get with it

I made a fun version of even hunter with bombs exploding sheep and feign death. Not as  consistent as straight mech hunter, but way more fun and a chance for 32 face 8 board combo.

8/8/8 | Taunt At the end of your turn, add a random Death Knight card to your hand.  
---
Honestly, it's all subjective. Whatever excites you.
---
No u
---
yep i got confused by that at 25 you get 2 classic packs
---
JUST LOOK!
---
He's no Ben Brode, yeah, but he doesn't "objectively suck". I think Whalen does a great job.
---
Personal preference.  I'd rather a few weeks of theorycrafting than a few hours of 'oh wow' moments.
---
Neat idea. 
---
How would that work? Like when the vehicle "dies", it leaves behind the minion that was riding it?
---
Agree with almost everything you said, I think this cards only viability is with the last thing you mention, building a deck with jar dealer, raven caller, violet haze. although I disagree and think these sub par cards ARE worth the reward. In particular, rogue loves 1 drops so getting those randomly isnt that bad. additionally you can keep tempo with the reward, underbelly and vendetta. Finally you can top this deck with tess who hasn't seen much play because of rogues survivability but the weapon helps massively with that
---
Yeah that'd be better.
---
Feels like its a bug. The card says "return THIS to life with 1 health", and prelate keeps all enchantments. Kinda like when you got pyro's deathrattle with undatakah, you are supposed to get a 6mana 6/6 or 10mana 10/10 undatakah, but instead got pyro back
---
But on average, you will have at least one large boardclear. There's always some situation where you'd want to pick one over the other, but still *in general* the new tortolan is significantly better.
---
Wow. It's almost as if they're different cards with different rarities and different effects created within the context of two different classes and as a result their mana costs are different.
---
don't come to Reddit if you expect actual humans
---
Do you read the stuff you write?
---
We got it with Nether Portal, and minions that can go Dormant and never leave the board.
---
I'd like to see a lot more though.
---
No

I think it's 50/50. Either happens or it doesn't.

Bring back Joust and Inspire you cowards!
---
I don't know why they abandon mechanics. Even if for each expansion we only got like one Inspire and one Echo card, that would be cool.
---
BEN BRODE GOOD PETER WHALEN BAD. 
---
Really sick of this circlejerk.
---
The only downside I can see with that is being penalised for using more decks in the top bracket, for instance losing 2-1 as opposed to 2-0
---
I wasn't aware that Ben Brode invented laughing.
---
The only think that sort of effect would encourage is degeneracy.
---
With Reborn you could say everyone is the new shaman.
---
have you watched him?
---
Don't be a fucking asshole.
---
still not have a good classic set for priest
---
Actually Reborn and resummon this minion are not the same thing. Reborn only revives with one hp.
---
I did an analysis of the cards from the card dumps after the final stream for Rastakhan's Rumble and Rise of Shadows.  
---
The most meta-defining card from RR was **Scarab Egg**, which can/could be found in Zoolock and Token Druid.  **Former Champ** is a fringe player in Evolve Shaman, currently a fringe deck.  Spellzerker receives a bit of play in some Spell Damage Mage decks.
---
The most meta-defining card from Rise of Shadows was **Witch's Brew**, which can be found in slower Shaman decks.  **Vicious Scraphound** occasionally makes an appearance from Omega Assembly or a Dr. Boom discover.
---
The lesson here is that if a card doesn't appear in this afternoon's live stream and hasn't been revealed yet, don't expect to see a lot of it over the next 21 months.
---
don't forget the starter quests that players complete before hitting the ladder
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Quest#Introductory
---
The rewards from those include 3 Classic packs, 400 gold, 95 dust, and 1 free Arena ticket (which at minimum will yield 1 pack from the most recent set, even for a 0-3 run). 
---
So added to the rewards you mentioned, the total haul is:
---
* 13 Classic packs
---
* 3 Rise of Shadows packs, and 2 packs each from Rastakhan's Rumble, The Boomsday Project and The Witchwood
---
* 400 gold
---
* 95 dust
---
plus all the starter decks.  not too shabby
---
That expired on July 1st, along with being able to get Archmage Vargoth and Snip-Snap.
---
I think you've gotten enough comments here in the thread that people feel like the post is pretty mean spirited, even if you just thought you were joking. 
---
One of the biggest issues for years with the HS Community has been the lack of dev dialogue/involvement in discussions with players. In recent months it's been really good - let's not spoil the good faith the game-builders are putting out there by making them the butt of lame jokes.
---
Totally right, it just feels like nothing matters anymore. Dr Boom, Conjurers, Omega Devastator, these are all cards that just make what you do meaningless.  You play a big creature? I have 2 cards that just blank it and I get to develop with 6 mana. Get you down to 14 life by turn 6? No worries I can generate 1-2 7/8 taunts next turn. Its just silly and frustrating.
---
Maybe deathrattl-y stuff? Although I guess that went to the rogue legendary.
---
arcanosaur pissed on my fucking wife
---
"Everybody gets one"
---
Still be on most of our phones
---
I meant more like...Nevermind.
---
Any other useful information like this?
---
IKR, can’t wait to sigh wistfully as it refuses to work with my renolock.
---
The one aspect I liked about Joust was being able to peek/spy into your opponents deck. You could sometimes get some valuable information that way that changed how you played. I'd like to see them revisit that at some point.
---
Exactly the same that happened to me...
---
I mean,
---
Pfffff you're so stupid, I knew from the beginning that this was a Rogue weapon. Omg, you should be so embarrased of yourself!
---
Hopefully, Priest being the new Shaman will go the same as Rogue being the new Priest in terms of card theft. That is to say, the Priest version will actually see considerable support beyond the basic package.
---
But even if you don't like him - this is just unkind.
---
&gt;It most ceartainly can. Powercreep doesn't mean strictly better.
---
Yes it does mean that. 
---
The meaning of the word has died long ago it seems. You guys are talking about something entirely different that needs a name of it’s own.
---
Besides in arena I think OG turtle is better. You’re not going to be able to stack good spells in arena, so a big pool of random spells is gonna help more. Even if you do draft a flamestrike, you’re probably gonna draw it early and be left with an 8 mana 5/5 that casts frostbolt on itself.
---
Crystal Stag feeling pretty salty about this one.
---
Reverse power creep of [nerubian egg], but standard doesn’t have that egg, so this will probably be played instead, however I don’t know how many egg popers/buffs are in standard for me to rate this properly
---
Interesting that you choose a class for the cards, but it doesn't count as a class win :\
---
Both options are decent, in a class that struggle with single target removal. Pretty good
---
this with Druid quest is pretty nice, I suppose.
---
This is sooo cool, especially with the new quest
---
I honestly dont even know how they do this
---
the holy hammon
---
Maybe that is the card why Nourish have also been nerf.
---
Oh shit
---
He should get a prize or something
---
Is it discover? Or does it give you a card based on board state? Are those all the options, or is it like the wizball from the Heist? Can we get Ice Block, duplication, etc?
---
Now I’m excited.
---
And the deck they're showing that off in only has 2 secrets in it so it didn't draw anything lmao
---
PogYou
---
That really is incredible
---
Fam
---
Frostwolf Grunt doesn't die to Execute. Check, Gin, and Yahtzee, my friend.
---
SHINING DRAWWWWW
---
Wow. Appropriate for the League, exploring brand new design space. This could become universally beloved or or universally despised with equal odds, but I'm glad to see Blizz taking the risk. Zephyrus is the kind of card that only Hearthstone could make.
---
Reborn can a) be healed and b) trigger deathrattle/effects that hit summoned minons twice. Silencing them is more useful than divine shield.
---
Lightning Helix what have they done to you
---
I think you want the copie 90% of the time. Very good with the quest. Scary.
---
It is even situantionally better than mad scientist.
---
There's no perfect card:
---
If your deck has no duplicates, pray for top decks
---
It's obvious he has a time machine.
---
Seems decent on its own, and it’s incredable with Fandral or the quest reward. Will be played
---
Couldnt have been easy at all. I just really hope a bomb warrior meta doesnt make this unplayable
---
I wouldn't sleep on the Druid Quest
---
Looking forward to some Trolden highlights where the algorithm takes a huge dump and gives nothing remotely useful.

So if my opponent is at 6 health and I'm at 6 mana and drop this, I should get a Fireball, right?
---
I'm still not sold on Quest Priest. 15 health is a lot.
---
Instantly better than [[Witchwood Imp]] and it's neutral.

Yup. Instant-access makes it really good for Secret-activation cards like Flakmage or Cloud Prince. Plus it immediately thins your deck. Insanely good card. The fact that it even compares to Mad Scientist says all it needs to.

1/1/1 Demon | Stealth Deathrattle: Give a random friendly minion +2 Health.  
---
Oh God oh fuck why is this a thing
---
Jokes aside this will be played and I will be hating it
---
I can already see the screenshots of the "perfect" cards like the card replacement mechanics during the deck building, recommending haunted creeper and thalnos for a death knight.
---
Why have secrets be 3 mana when you can just play them for 2? Or get a 4/3 body attached?
---
Secrets are only played because the synergy is through the roof.
---
Drain Soul wasn’t even a bad card either. This is just nuts.
---
First thought is that this is better than mad scientist in wild freeze mage, which is insane considering mad scientist is one of the most powerful cards in the history of the game. 
---
Second thought is just that this card is simply really, really good. It's effectively a coin that also cycles. Auto include in any deck running secrets, and honestly good enough to justify running secrets in *any* mage deck.
---
If this works correctly it will be good in any singleton deck. A neutral card with premium stats that generate a good card is powerful to say the least.
---
Albeit a bit weak against the threat of bombs. Not too many lifesteals in the basic set
---
KNC Warlock is another level of power
---
With the quest reward , are they both 5/5?
---
They got new ways to activate the lackey generator they already have.
---
Is it always basic/classic card?
---
Why not? It works well once you complete your quest.
---
[[Druid of the Water]]
---
Oh I don’t know that. Thanks !
---
tutor a secret and reduce it's cost by 1. This is like the best all around card I've seen. It would be good even if it was discover a random secret, but drawing one from your deck is amazing.
---
For sure!  Anyone can get there as the game is actually very generous with rewards, it’s just that catching up to start with is a grind and really pressures people to sink resources before they should.

5/4/4 | Choose One - Transform into a 4/4 with Charge; or a 4/6 with Taunt.  
---
So... they reprinted Kazakus?
---
It really isn’t when you have cards like Divine Hymn and Circle of Healing.
---
Because I a shit poster
---
aw shucks.  originally I was doing the list as a comment at the spreadsheet thread, but then I was like "hey!  I should just do my own thread" (lawl)
---
Also helps enable that 3 mana 3/3 transform a lackey into a 5/5.  So 1 mana discover to get the lackey you want for the situation, and then buff it into a 5/5, effectively nullifying the 1 mana tax.
---
I really wanna try to make some kind of aggro mage deck with these cards
---
This card is affected by spell damage too...
---
Like the other 1 mana discover cards, it probably won’t be played, but choose one is such a small set of cards you might be able to justify this
---
Priest continues the cycle of being the worst class in the game for months and then getting 1 obscene power level set to make everyone hate them again.
---
Tbh I prefer that over some of the unplayable garbage in previous sets
---
I mean compare [[Darkbomb]] to [[Frostbolt]]. Warlock just always gets slightly worse cheap removal.
---
Ouch. Nobody is making you pay for it, nobody is making me pay for it. It’s a game I enjoy and it’s a choice I make because it provides value to me. Sorry if that upsets you. 
---
And the only reason I chose the pre-order is because it is $1 a pack. You will never find a better deal that that. If it was $10 a pack I wouldn’t pay, that is a very low value transaction.

This card is legendary in quest Druid. You can just dump constant threats.
---
Loti, Druid of the Claw, Cenarius, Tending Tauren, This?
---
Every card becomes a threat. Reminds me a lot of Even Warlock.
---
I have literally have no idea how some people make it that fast.
---
Good arena card, and one of the better reborn for paladins quest
---
That is exactly what I thought on reading this card, only in the quake III announcer voice.
---
I hope this card just gives me Leeroy on 7-8 and Pyroblast on 9-10.
---
I'm quietly optimistic about this card. Both harvest golem and scarlet crusader saw *some* play in the early days of hs, and this is handily better than either of those. This might be the 30th card in some tempo/zoo strategies.
---
woops!  had a little D&amp;D on the brain
---
Lol this card is nuts, even plays super well with Mana Cyclone
---
As someone who mains Aluneth Mage in wild, it's hard to tell which is better between Mad Scientist, Arcanologist, and this.
---
Mad Scientist is the usual choice for clear favorite, but just because of Arcane Flakmage I think the other two choices are a lot better now.
---
I really don't know how the deck will shift, if Flakmage doesn't turn out to be as good as expected Mad Scientist will stay on top. If Flakmage overperforms then this'll probably be a two of. Those three cards will probably shift based on how much aggro you're facing
---
Sounds like an ice cream flavour.
---
&gt; I wonder why they didn't call it Lightbomb?
---
It already exists
---
Yup
---
Light bomb exists already.
---
Rush makes this card so strong. Since the quest is easy to accomplish this will always be 2 5/5 with rush. Good luck aggro.
---
I'm not suprised a design like this would end up being Priest, but I would have rather it been a Paladin spell like Holy Shock. Priest already has a billion ways to kill things.
---
Developers has just again forgotten to remove it from minion pool or ...
---
they do it on purpose: to reflect this game being sheer RNG a card may be revealed faster if disvovered or summoned during a reveal stream.
---
In the same vein, the other EA abomination was the mobile version of Dungeon Keeper, a super old school PC game. Like if you wanted your dungeon to build faster, it was just pay EA more. Uninstalled that real quick.
---
Seems weak, but a swarm deck might play it? It might be good in arena? I’m grasping at straws here
---
Golden craft day one if I don't got him as the golden legendary ! 
---
I love those cards. I crafted Prince Liam and prince Rafaam golden day one, and got golden Whizbang as my golden legendary :)
---
Of course it wont be over 130... only like 20-30 cards for each class are scored that high
---
They already have a lightbomb from GvG, check your hearthscan bot reply lol
---
Most classes can't heal, and silencing to avoid a Deathrattle is itself more of a reason than Reborn by itself.
---
Yes, it will make  sense silence cards like Khartut Defender and Grandmummy, but each of those has much more to do with the Deathrattles than the Reborn.
---
Think about any ~7 cost rush minion: attack into an enemy minion, use this card on it for another attack. 
---
For taunt, where in many cases especially in arena, it could survive a turn.. so after a favorable trade next turn, use this to get a fresh one. I'm not gonna say its utterly broken - it can be used in many situations where minion trading is one of the most important factor.
---
You are, in fact, welcome here
---
They should happen in the order they appear on the card, so yes.
---
He brings out Blood of the Ancient One
---
I don’t understand why you can’t just purchase the packs once they come out with gold. Or do you mean to purchase the pre-release bundles with gold?
---
Yes
---
That's the outer border of that area. That's not actually where the color ribbon is. The border indicated by the arrow is always that black color, on every class
---
ya i wasnt complaining :)
---
What?

Can someone add me? I don't know where to post this, sorry if it's the wrong place.

Worthy to be auto include in any deck with the quest.

If the AI is decent, how RNG is it, really?

Yeah that's the color they're supposed to be but not what they look like.
---
What is the mystery choice? Is it "a perfect card" but you don't get to choose?
---
[removed]
---
" to appreciate the improvement " lol what, who do you think you are to judge someone doing his job on reddit, gtfo. He was good in every stream not only this one.
---
So.. do you get to choose between 2 spells and a question mark, and the question mark just gives you a random spell?
---
Honestly, discover a spell is really not that bad of an effect.
---
Yeah, my post had some typos in it which are now fixed.  Started typing it then thought I deleted some and retyped and it was a whole mess.
---
The cutest egg so far
---
"Can I light your fire?"
---
yeah reddit has a really high bar for pettyness you got that right
---
Double ~~Pyroblast~~  Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron in the same turn? Sign me up.
---
Yep, I totally agree
---
Are warlock spells worse or are cards from other classes just better because they are supposed to better at that particular thing? Oft course priest gets a better healing card than warlock and of course mage gets a better damage dealing spell than warlock (frostbolt vs darkbomb) but in areas where the theme isn't as class defined warlock does absolutely outrank other classes a lot of the time. Defile is just insane, forbidden ritual is still powercreeping cards to this day etc
---
This notion that warlock gets shitty cards because their hero power is pretty good is the biggest load of bullshit I keep reading on this sub
---
Are we gonna complain now that mortal strike is worse than fireball and blame the armor up hero power for that or are we just gonna acknowledge that dealing direct dmg is a mage strength just how healing is a priest strength
---
*Let me change your mind*
---
And you just go gang up rogue in wild and laugh historically to your 700 fatigue damage
---
4 Mana 7/7!
---
He actually played it later on turn 9, and got Flamestrike, Ancient of War and Brawl.
---
It's more like a 7/1 offensively and a 1/7 defensively.
---
We probably won't find out what the mystery choice is until the expansion is released, unless a designer clarifies it on Twitter.
---
Coin
---
worth noting that you can shuffle your deck by playing any card that puts a card in your deck and will make you draw a random card rather than your opponent's. At least that's how it has worked before.
---
If people never run dark convic
---
tion in there deck then why dp they need to run this
---
you dont want to run the 2-mana AOE tho. 1 damage doesnt do enough against most meta decks, and you can complete the quest in more efficient ways between penance, lifedrinker, zilliax and waterbearer. i think you'd much rather complete the quest by playing minions than playing spells, so you run few spells and several healing minions
---
Oh, yeah, for sure, I'm pumped, especially because I was already running eight or nine reno decks. Reno Warrior will still struggle, but I'll manage.
---
what does "a pick a mystery choice" implies?
---
Sure, I never said anything about the value of the information, that wasn't the statement I was disputing.
---
I don't get why they waited till the last part of reveal season to show so many interesting cards. Would've pre-ordered way earlier if they had  spaced out all the cool cards revealed today
---
goes nicely with big shaman
---
It's likely 4 options with the fourth being the mystery one.
---
Jahahhaha
---
This goes well with Carnassa + Dire
---
Good stats and great with small minions builds.
---
I’m so fucking excited for secret mage!
---
I think it may be tier 2.5 for now. 
---
Kibler basically McGayvered a win con with a created by khadgar janalai combo.
---
or **a** pick a mystery choice. okay
---
I can't wait to see the algorithm completely worked out on day 1 this goes live.
---
Love this card, it's going to be an instant craft for me.  Also because I love burgle rogue, and this just fits right in.
---
4 Mana 7/7
---
Hah. As if secret wasn't pushed enough. Hyena is fitting. I'm laughing.
---
I disagree. Even with Swarm of Locusts, 20 is *a lot*. You'd have to build your deck around it completely, unlike some of the other quests. And even then, the pay off is only *okay*. And on top of all this - Zuljin will wipe out your new Hero Power. 
---
Outside of control hunter blindsiding me - I think this quest will see as much play as the previous hunter quest.
---
Did you mean to say Drakonid Operative?
---
Mage looks really fun
---
That could be abused pretty hard; Most decks lowest cost minions will be 1 to 3 mana, but you could empty your trash minions and keep only the 8-10 mana ones.
---
Peter made sure that Kibler traded first. So it probably would have given just 1 AoE before, or something.
---
Hireek Warlock tier one.
---
4 MANA 7/7 IS BACK BOYS
---
Oh God you're right

everything that Blizzard does in their games is based off of tests like these or incorporate mechanics that other games have done and are known to work.

4 mana 7/7

It is incredible how iconic this video is within the hearthstone community, still now after all those years. The only other video I can think of that comes close to the level of quality of that video is the Ben Brode vs Kripp unicorn priest video.

Copying from another comment:
---
&gt;Sure, it's not a true discover.  I was just generalizing because that's what it feels like.  It gives you a choice between three instead of putting a card directly into your hand.  
---
&gt;It gives you the best card in three buckets and you choose one of those so no, there's no weighting in terms of class. 
---
&gt;The only weighting is 
---
1) what you need
---
2) what you can cast; priority given to something you can cast this turn.
---
Would also like to add that I did mention how the card works.  I was just trying to generalize based on what it feels like.
---
Arena and random 10 cost card only
---
There's just so many ways you can complete the quest. Reborn minions alone up the viability like crazy.
---
The bainchent juan yessss.
---
I’m still waiting for the big reveal that Reno is a dragon in disguise. Any expansion now...
---
Actually looks more like a Gnoll. (The race that Hogger and Ol' Barkeye are)
---
Depends on the situation when you use it.

Nice to see some Dark Iron representation!
---
Oh boy
---
We did, there were several new legendaries sprinkled through out two weeks
---
If lethal is available?  Yes.
---
I beat it two times with a dragon-mech paladin deck. Granted merc 280 had like 5 patches but I had many answers that let me clear the board and I won pretty handily both matches. I was retired by swarm 815, I found that deck much more overwhelming at the start because it was difficult to clear the board with all the buffs.
---
Everyone mentions "Choose One Druid" but here i stand and sy that this card is nice in token druid too!
---
Tol'vir have always been borderline fetish fuel... because "Taur" exist.
---
Two possibilities:
---
- I'll get one from a pack on the first day and it will never be used.
---
- I'll never get one from a pack and it will be in the most broken OTK deck in years.
---
if you play it on turn 2 with nothing on board it will give you the option on this post screenshot
---
its not gonna give you the best card in the match up,its gonna give you the best card on the current state of the board,your mana,and your hand when its played
---
OGER
---
its not better than zilliax most of the time, i don't think you run only one of this and zilliax. i constructed a quest priest deck that peaks its mana cost at five, so i run zilliax, 2 of these and infiltrators for anti-aggro
---
It would probably give you a fireball on 9/10 unless you are at close to full health and the opponent is at or below 10. It prioritizes cards you can play this turn over cards you can play next turn and obviously this cant be played on the same turn as pyroblast.
---
The reward itself isn’t even that good. Why make so many control hunter cards then print a tempo hunter quest?
---
This is actually smart. Wow.
---
You'll probably be playing both. Zul'Jin is still a good finisher even if it wipes your hero power. Or you try to drop Zul'Jin before the quest finishes since Zul'Jin will go a long ways towards completing the quest. The Hunter quest seems like one of the slower ones to finish so you may hit turn 10 most games before it's done.
---
Hey AnalCurry, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "PSA". Titles should be phrased with an informative, declarative statement that can stand on its own without the use of "PSA".

This is the FIRST EVER Taunt minion in the 10 mana slot.
---
Uh... This and apprentice will be disgusting. It seems that reload mage is here to stay.
---
MUDA MUDA
---
I think this was Toasts card reveal. Definitely powerful like he said. Dang.
---
Pack filler, but notable for being the only minion to naturally have poisonous and 3 attack
---
YIKES, another Emerald Spellstone.
---
oger on steroids
---
I love it
---
Assuming the fourth option is mystery that’s cool.
---
Mystery choice means any random card?
---
But might screw up you 1/1 Mechathun.
---
If this was 7 mana you'd put it into a huge number of Standard decks (see: firelands portal). At 8 mana it is less good but good enough that the possibility of combo'ing it with the Shaman Quest hero power makes it a card you play in that deck IMO.
---
My poor, Boulderfist Ogre, look what they did to you
---
Damn... fetishes have made it into hearthstone
---
Perfect card: Examples were if your opponent has a full board it will offer a board clear. 
---
If you're low health: a health option.
---
It tries to appease how much many you have remaining. So turn 10 if you have an empty board it might offer a Tirion. 
---
It only takes from classic and basic.
---
And can be any class.
---
That would be interesting but bad for myself as I am a horrible typerister
---
My favorite hero in the Heist, now a Legendary minion.
---
You should end with Zul'Jin's, but he recasts the quest.
---
Poor Jaraxxus.
---
Yep, quite easy to do with a macro/script ready.
---
There were also 0 krakens in year of the kraken!!! Fricking Bli$$ard!!! /s
---
But if you play this on curve the card it gives you will not nearly be as useful as it’ll just give you some generic 3 drop
---
Don’t forget the more information you give, the better cards he gives part! If you want the flamestrike, you should set enemy as many minions’ health to 4 as you can to increase your chances.
---
you cant evolve sea giant
---
As much as I love rogue, it’s such a frustrating class to play; unlike mage, you always get utterly wiped by board-fill Aggro with too few counters, so there’s a good chance you’ll die before pulling off anything interesting.
---
Why?
---
This is absolutely insane.
---
Sorry you didn't assign a flair.
---
Well now they have to change the art smh
---
Lyra but 100000x better.
---
Zoo cards are awesome. Don't bother with control cards, control warlock will never work without a broken heal card(reno, spellstone etc.).
---
I think Kobolds, Frozen Throne, Rise of Shadows and Gadgetzan were all more powerful.
---
This could potentially be a 2 mana do nothing off of Cyclone.
---
We haven't seen how the match-up plays out yet. Maybe it won't be as bad as it seems.
---
Additionally, much of the rest of the set is primed to test how far the limited control tools Bomb Warrior uses can go, and thus, the deck might functionally drop out of the format.
---
I wasn't expecting anyone to catch it, either, but seems people like it. The mouthfeel, that is.
---
Obviously you’re too dumb to realize that it isn't very powerful and it won't be played, just like druid of the claw or stag. Or maybe it will, at rank 11 or whatever garbage you are.
---
Yep, it was a limited time arena event. Halloween iirc.
---
Well, if it were play the number would be lower
---
Definitely!
---
Hell ywah I’ve seen some board clears get up into the 6-8 health range and it’s just crazy setting that up
---
4 mana card
---
Yup, definitely better.
---
why didn't he?
---
Conjurers is only tier 2 anyways
---
And that's a strong cc buff.
---
If you get your oppenent to 10 hp then start top decking. This is the best possible thing to get. When it dies you draw youe burn and smorc
---
exactly this
---
Wow...
---
It’s not exactly any card unless you select only one as a destiny card in Tag Force, afaik. You have to select a pool of cards that are the “destiny cards” and when you use Destiny Draw it’ll draw a card from that pool instead of the top of your deck. The cards in the pool still come from your deck, too, so once you Destiny Draw it, you can’t draw it regularly.
---
It can’t always come up with the perfect solution, but if you pick your destiny cards right, you can significantly increase the chances that it does. I usually selected Swords of Revealing Light since it’s a 3 turn stall given they don’t have spell removal or burn damage.
---
TAUNT BACKWARDS!
---
but why would a tempo deck care about the immune part? i feel like waggle pick is just better, you hit face and kill people, that's what rogue does atm. will you stop running waggle pick and leeroy? that's a 20 damage combo that doesn't compromise your gameplan at all.
---
So when is shaman getting Thunder Cross Split Attack
---
But why?
---
I'm glad this isn't a Druid card.
---
They could add one in a similar manner to SN1P-SN4P
---
No he explains in another tweet that it does not read your own hand either. Only info that both you and your opponent have.
---
I know what you actually meant to say, but my brain read that as "amia miley" at first(don't google it, guys).
---
I dunno, I don't think it fits mage. Now druid seems good for this.
---
\[\[Wild Pyromancer\]\] was the only proper answer to token druid in standard.  This card easily puts Priest decks ahead in that matchup.  Great get.
---
oger daddy
---
Remember my name when the time comes..!
---
If it blows your mind that people defend a hero power that is extremely powerful then i don't know what to say for you.
---
&gt;hunters have no card draw
---
They have several things to help them cycle through their deck, hell there's that new card that draws you a card just for having your quest active, then there's [[master's call]] and [[tracking]] to get further in your deck and there's [[hunters's pack]] for further card generation
---
&gt;look at this compared to token druid
---
You shouldn't even be comparing the two, both classes are objectively different and work towards different gameplans

2/3/2 | After you cast a spell, deal 1 damage to ALL minions.  
---
where the video
---
I still feel sad that all these cool effects get turned off by bombs :(
---
True, but it will be much more common to drop this 7-drop for 3-4 mana and evolve it into a beefy 8-drop than unfortunately evolving a 6-drop into this.
---
Priest has gotten the best cards compared to baseline. Priest was effectively dead in standard in Rise of Shadows, and Saviors has probably provided enough support to force a viable standard Priest deck. The quest, the 3 mana kill and resurrect guy, penance, the faux Spirit Lash, and Psychopomp all look fantastic. Then you have a 2 mana Injured Blademaster as a neutral option. 
---
 Plague of Death I still don’t see getting played because control Priest lacks a real win condition against Control Warrior and only Control Priest would play that card, Reborn spell suffers from not really providing more than a 1 for 1 in most cases, and I still don’t see Grandmummy working even with the crazy stats just because of the kind of deck if requires. But overall, this looks like the start of a Priest revival.

Shadow priest combo is another board clear. It would be useful if you wanted to tune the deck to be more viable against aggro as the one I pasted struggles against tokens.

Didn’t fit it into the deck but is probably solid to use. Between mass hysteria, holy nova, shadow madness, and the 3/3 guys that steal and enemy I didn’t include it
---
Rat Trap tends to stick around for a while.
---
They sure are throwing caution to the wind as far as Arena goes.

Glad they finally realized the thief archetype’s biggest problem is facing other rogues because stealing cards for your opponent’s class is already a gamble.
---
The flavor of this set has been top notch
---
AI dominance?
---
Basic and classic
---
Well, you'll always end up with not-so-good cards, that's just given, but people often sleep on powerful things.
---
Mainly because you can't really predict the fully changed meta in your head and play through every potential new deck matchup in your head - we're not supercomputers.

In a vacuum, jeah, the 20 summons seem dauting. But since it's "summon" it can also rack up pretty quick. I'd not write it off completely, but it's certainly in the "Has to be tested" category.

---
Basic/classic set cards should not be so broken. Do you really want to play when EVERY priest forever is going to have that broken version of holy nova? That's not what those sets are supposed to be.
---
That Tauren is definitely one of the /r/HydroHomies
---
Are you telling me that you're not playing card reveal bingo?
---
Really? You came here to say that?
---
They must be hoping all the AoE cards like the Shaman murloc plague are going to control mage boards
---
Cute card of the set.
---
There will be moments when you don't get why it offers you a specific card until you see that you missed something.
---
Right now he has 16k viewers on TFT. It may be more than the entire HS viewers at the moment. I feel he will stick to TFT. Insane numbers.
---
One bad match-up rarely if ever completely undoes a deck. Tempo Rogue at the beginning of this format is proof enough of that.
---
I'll take the mystery choice! It could even be a boat, you know I always wanted a boat!
---
You don't get class credit for the class you chose your cards from.
---
Can't win as warlock/warrior, etc.
---
I'm gonna call this card "I Know a Lackey"
---
Well, you often don't have any spell damage.
---
Siamat
---
Yeah, 4 days before the cards were revealed. It was a leak, not a prediction. If you wanna give a guy credit, someone made both Defile and Plague of Murlocs.
---
Zephyrus-Shadowstep-Zephyrus-Shadowstep-Zephyrus for three Trackings.
---
Seems if your opponent is under 6 health and you have the mana, this should give you fireball every time. Even if you have a few minions on the board and 7 mana, it should give bloodlust if there is lethal to be had. Seems ridiculous
---
Oof my brain tunneled on the naga name and thought it would work the same as naga sea witch but it’s an actual battlecry holy shit.
---
Watching the VOD. Twitch chat sure dissappointed me here.
---
Not going to be good at all, but in wild with Daring Escape/Vanish, can activate your quest (after spending 15 mana total assuming no reductions) which these also benefit from.
---
Does it?
---
When you add to opponent's board, it counts as their summons. Leeroy's whelps trigger *opponent's* Knife Juggler, not yours, for example.
---
The fact that you can deal 3 damage while taking none with a weapon you can get unlimited times from a hero power is a big deal.
---
Unless you are playing a 4HP 2 drop and 3 drop, both die for free while they take no damage and develop their board.
---
Well.. Hunter had the most fun Deathknight (and pretty powerful on top) though, so it's a give and take.
---
This is a build around. Maybe it works out, maybe it doesn't. Depends if people find some nifty combinations that aren't apparent yet. It wouldn't be the first time a deck needs a while until it comes to fruition.
---
WHY BLIZZARD MORE BIG PRIEST BUFF
---
Holy fuck, even shaman just got real hard
---
Say sike right now
---
Only imperial Storm Chasers are so precise.
---
I've noticed it the other way around too, where people forget how frustrating cards were while they were in standard just because they don't see any play in wild.
---
Somewhat debatable by arena standards
---
Hmmm, can we nerf Spreading Plague again just for design space's sake.
---
Equality + Pyro
---
I actually haven't watched it LUL
---
Yeah this is a lot closer to [[Mad Scientist]] without the body than Arcanologist. And people played Mad Scientist a lot without even caring about the body. This card is insane.
---
Aww shucks, thanks so much everyone &lt;3 Really appreciate the feedback, both positive and critical... it helped us lock in a really good feel and format for these livestreams. Much love!
---
Also, I'm glad I could speak today as well!
---
I had to say I had no idea about this before you showed me. Thanks a lot, friend!
---
I don't even run waggle pick in my current list. I know it's a pretty decent card and will win you games, I jsut dislike its design and am not a friend of the "random" part of it. I just run shadowstep and that works fine as well.
---
Nofunallowed.jpg
---
Have I got a bomb for you!
---
At least the nice thing about having the highlander and quest mechanics is that they are more difficult to "solve" and will encourage a lot of experimentation.  Not something we haven't seen before but this could be an interesting meta
---
Octo-yes-Rogue.
---
Drop this guy, after making it a 1/1 for 1, then you play baron and necrium vial to draw 32 cards, and your opponent concedes.
---
There is no priest card generation. Re-summons yes... but not enough value within the class to survive. We will get outvalued and out stomped.
---
this should be the lowest rated brawl. not only is this THE most boring brawl ever thanks the mercs, but it hurts so much more because the idea was great but the execution was terrible.
---
They have different aims. Heartharena is for the majority of low level players, while Lightforge is better for correct play.
---
Doesn't matter how good the ai because highlander decks will still suck even with this
---
That face when you are outdone by a common
---
You mean a blatant Kimba the white lion reference
---
This is really good.. Quest Priest is going to be nuts if it
---
 works.
---
Every time you play it, Darude Sandstorm starts playing.
---
Highlander hunter card fo sho
---
This is pack filler, most customHS cards are build-arounds.
---
Hogsteed shits on 3/2s. That's the point.
---
Hey, I agree but seriously look at the reveals. People suck at understanding things like “all” “from your deck” “win”. These effects are always powerful wether you can enable it or not is another story, cards can be really powerful and not have an enabler but these are cards people did not understand on release, N’zoth was released right after nax rotated out and most of the best deathrattle minions in the game at the time had left. So in a meta with no belchers people thought that there’d be nothing keeping you from an F.O.N. Savage roar, but people forgot pally had tirion. People forgot about warsong when patron was announced, people forgot that in an Aggro deck drawing all of your deck is great cause you’re out of cards and you don’t care about fatigue. It’s always been like that.
---
As a control player... I have board clears, but not that many.
---
*All charged up!*, *All charged up!* **END TURN** *♪Dum, dum dum dumm♫*, *Light the fuses!*
---
Get it, get it.
---
nah, they did that in year of the raven but then for some reason started doing ridiculous power levels in year of the dragon.
---
Just look at conjurer's calling
---
I'm not sure what you are on about. The original comment literally only said.
---
&gt;It is even situationally better than mad scientist.
---
I’m wondering how perfect the options will be. From gameplay they look great but I’m not sure exactly what parameters it’s taking into account. Probably a lot of work was done to code this card lol
---
Definitely super strong but will probably take some feeling out in order to semi-predict what options you’ll get in different situations
---
Plus, Elemental tag which is a possible upside down-the-line.
---
Oh ya, I forgot how shit [[Totem Golem]] was.
---
Yes, these are not literally berries, though. Google an explanation if you must...
---
Wild big rogue likes it a lot
---
does that mean revolution? xD
---
the problem is that they're introducing a lot of archetypes this expansion but not really providing support for a lot of them.
---
2 fast stats is no joke for zoo on turn 2-3 and this is a solid aggro-control card in general.  The only time you're playing this on 1 is after coin 1 drop, or if a priest deck works and \[\[Extra Arms\]\] is in your mulligan.  Seems like a nice boost for decks that will run \[\[Magic Carpet\]\].
---
Titanic Lackey is generally superior to Witchy though, especially in aggro decks
---
That was the joke dude.

---
3/1/6 | After you play a 1-Cost minion, give it +1 Attack and Rush.  
---
Maybe like discover 2 kinds of beasts and stitch them together?
---
A -3 cost sea giant with rush but worse stats. I'm pretty sure this will see play. The question is, is it a good anti-aggro tool or just a token/evolve tool? It probably doesn't make the cut as an anti-aggro tool just because it only is cheap for wide boards but it doesn't really answer wide boards, it just helps.
---
Hogsteed is better reactively. This card splits the difference and is better proactively. I still much prefer the former though.
---
I read your comment and it suddenly occurred to me that I am one of those people, and I have not made 1 comment on the quality of 
---
 the expac.
---
Talk about a moment of self awareness lol
---
Can we make him a Cultist instead? Then we can work towards ®️ancient One!
---
Any minion that isn’t a good rez on it’s own (other than barnes which is broken) isn’t good in big priest. Big priest is also mostly spells, more often than not your hand is entirely spells.
---
If you’re at 10 health against an odd rogue or odd paladin on turn 6, do you really want to get this from essence?
---
Trading a **Challenge a Friend!** quest on **Europe**. I'll show you my quest in game but I'll let you go first. I intend to play a suicide deck and be done with it in a couple of minutes. Once we're done we should post each other's battle tags here for future reference.
---
Add me on Europe: **Chizzle#2690**
---
Like more boring then War Golem?
---
&gt; not overpowered like you claim and obviously Hearthstone devs have tested it and agree with me.
---
Well, they've done plenty of nerfs since the inception of the game, so I'm not sure that holds water. Cards are always going to slip through the cracks, they can't feasibly test every interaction/deck list in the game.
---
Calling it now: This card will see competitive play. Players will lock in their decklists for an event. The AI will break.
---
Not really. If the upside doesn't outweigh the downside then it's a bad csrd. It's that easy
---
I don't know what you guys are smoking. If hunters had a savage roar they would be insane. If they could run two savage roars hunter would be broken. If you get this quest off and can cast a savage roar EVERY TURN for 2 mana that LASTS AS LONG AS THE MINIONS ARE ALIVE.... it's basically game over.
---
Token hunter all they way. Too bad priest and mage are gonna be cancer.
---
&gt; Unless it's a machine-learning algo, of course, but I highly doubt they'd implement something like that.
---
MLegends vs. PversusNPriest is a matchup that would get me to log back in to this game.
---
Or Rogue Spirit card
---
I feel like this is the surprise/sleeper neutral of the set.
---
It won't be run in every deck, but decks that care about tempo or winning early board are going to want to play this card. Only paying 2 mana to protect your board state (and develop a 3/2 minion at the same time) is ridiculously cheap. You don't even pay any stat penalty for the effect.
---
Agreed. Hopefully I'm wrong, but I don't see any deck coming to break the paper-rock-scissor that is right now. Conjurer's mage still the same, Bomb/Control warrior maybe experimenting a few things, and Rogue getting more power tools.
---
So what's with the magic lamp from that reveal? Didn't show up as a collectible card did it? Maybe something from the single player content?
---
Something something seven seven...Can't quite recall, never saw nor sees play anywhere.
---
Fun fact. If attack first this guy can solo both Cairne then Baine Bloodhoof and get out alive with full health. Guess who the real chieftain now lol
---
Not sure if you're joking, that is confirmed as the new Hunter quest. But it's 20 minions, which could be too many to be viable.
---
Hey WarrenDWhite, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
yeah, the only spell damage minion most decks running this would consider is BloodMage unless there's a strong spell damage minion I'm forgetting this expansion. Maybe it's interaction with Wild Pyro and running 1 Thalanos could make it really good with Quest
---
This is so bad
---
Its also
---
*Dynomatic + Zilliax or Omega Devastator + Zilliax*
---
True, if by turn 8 you have an empty board as a hunter you're pretty much dead anyway.
---
Plus the fact that it's a played spell, which is useful to mage, and not a played minion, which only elementals are really very useful to mage.
---
Awesome thanks for the link and info!
---
Reno Quest Mage is my pet deck in wild. I'm so happy with the cards they released.
---
Wtf that’s the second time today I’ve seen someone use historically instead of hysterically on reddit
---
It's Zephrys.
---
Thanks for the info!!!
---
Oh ok, cool. I haven't had a chance to watch the VODs yet so I was trying to piece it together from various other comments 😂
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I try, what's great is that you can do it with a ton of different combos too
---
They mentioned it in the stream. It was the Priest quest.
---
If that was the case we wouldn't have a non-rotating set.
---
After I already said that the Secret Mage power level is off the charts.
---
They were adding to what I said, not just making a stand alone comment. Hence why it's below my comment, not just posted by itself.
---
&lt;mouses over deck&gt; 9 cards left in the deck and he draws that.
---
Your highlander cards don't work but that doesn't mean your deck will fold and you'll die.
---
Grim Patron combo was literally showcased in the BRM adventure content. 
---
But, really, you can't compare the current community to the first few sets. People have grown to be much more proficient. This Reddit is still wrong on a lot of predictions, but your examples suck.
---
Keep in mind we never had the possibility of 0 cost rhinos before.  Now you don’t need the hyena.  😎👍
---
Also, my comment was about the set.  Do you... kind sir... think this set is “fucking bonkers”?
---
They design these cards 9-12 months in advance. So maybe they had it in mind that Baku/Genn would still be in the meta and were designing around those decks which were dominant back then. Shrug
---
This should have been called Power Creeper.
---
Quest shaman synergy hype
---
I said at most. I didnt mean to say it was a consistent way to win but rather a burst potential that at most could result in 23 dmg if all the cards fell in place. More likely than not you'd be luck to get more than 10 dmg from it (not counting minions on your side of the board)
---
why not 2x [[Play Dead]]?
---
I almost assure you highlander hunter will not be a deck.
---
This cared makes conjure mage a little worse.
---
I could see a meme deck running Locust Swarm and Revenge of the Wild if Locust Swarm's tokens are beasts

1/-/- | Trigger a friendly minion's Deathrattle.  
---
except by the 20th minion, you've already expended a lot of resources.
---
And another benefit of savage roar is that you can play it whenever along with a second one. You don't need 20 minions played first.

Definitely taunt warrior, with all the hand buffing cards they get in this expansion.

Or Vargoth.

You thought it was Zoolock...
---
**BUT IT WAS ME! DIOR’EEK WARLOCK!**
---
Auto include lol. The card is trash. Mark my words
---
100% going to be played in aggro.
---
So has Blizzard addressed Bomb Warrior negating Highlander decks? Haven’t seen much regarding that so pardon me if I missed anything
---
Charge forward?
---
I think there were a few MTG cards that would allow you to use literally any card you happened to carry around with you and that is one of the funniest things in any card game, I love that this is now what I’m looking at here.
---
***~~NONONONONONONOPLEASENERFTHISTO8MANA~~***
---
Serious question: how is this "insanely good" when [[Pit Lord]] is generally considered a pretty mediocre card?
---
Like, I agree; this *does* look good, especially since you get to "control" the damage in order to synergize with cards like the new vulture. But at the end of the day, you're probably gonna be  taking at *least* six damage with this, compared to the five you'd take with Pit Lord.
---
Is it simply its flexibility/lower cost that makes this better than Pit Lord? Because otherwise, they're both cards that give you +1/+1 in stats in exchange for taking hero damage. Oh, and this isn't even a demon, almost missed that bit.
---
Seems like a graphical allusion to only being able to have one quest active at a time
---
Seems like it might be strong for something like Tempo Rogue, which can make it 10 damage with the Spirit card and can bounce it back to their hand fairly easily for future turns.  Not amazing or deck-defining, but might find a spot.
---
It's not BRG strong but you get it *so* early... It might be.

You punish large hands by going aggro before all that value pays off. And everything does have a counter.
---
Instala has deathrattle in its text but he isn't a deathrattle minion.
---
I guess fandral sinergizes with choose one cards but he isn't a choose one card.
---
I could've sworn watching a video where someone said back in the 90s (for the period while the mechanic was allowed) people would abuse the crap out of the mechanic and pull out literal toolboxes full of cards, though...
---
Is it? Seems like a better more flexible mana tide totem.  You can, for instance, coin this turn 1 then play the quest, draw, attack, and get quest progress on turn 2.  Seems good.
---
But you're only getting 7.....
---
That's like 1/5 of what they get...

When AI has to play game for you
---

---
But the Frogurt also has potassium benzoate...
---
Didn't one of the devs mention months ago that some card from this set was being a pain to code, but they were thrilled because they finally got it right and were excited to see the player reaction? It's almost certainly this card.
---
Arena good maybe. Too vanilla to be useful in constructed.
---
I’m so fucking ready.  *Welcome to our domain.*
---
"it's not power creep if it's a class card"
---
If I remember correctly, they said it was easier to understand the effect of the hero power in one read with the "both effects combined" they were not going to compromise the easiness of understanding the card for just one card.
---
It was something like that more or less but I can't find the exact quote.
---
I think people are seriously underestimating the power level of the Paladin cards. 
---
People keep saying that [[Pharaoh's Blessing]] won't see play because it's not as good as Spikeridged Steed. People also said the same thing about Marked Shot when compared to Flanking Strike, and yet Marked Shot still sees play in Midrange Hunter.
---
[[Sir Finley of the Sands]] reminds me a lot of Prince Keleseth. If you're playing a Highlander deck and you can play it on turn 1 or 2, then you're pretty well off. You could even try to tutor for it with Call to Adventure, Witchwood Piper, or even Murloc Tastyfin in the hopes of getting it out before Bomb Warrior gets going.
---
[[Subdue]] is basically a 2 mana Polymorph, which is ridiculous (remember when Hex was 3 mana?). Sure it doesn't get rid of Deathrattles or continuous effects, and it won't stop that minion from being resurrected, but we've yet to see if that's actually going to matter or not.
---
[[Micro Mummy]] is likely going to be an auto-include in Mech Paladin. Not only is it a great follow-up to Glowtron and Mecharoo, but it's also a really good sticky minion to magnetize things to.
---
And finally, [[Salhet's Pride]] is actually my favourite card from the entire set. It's possibly the strongest tutoring engine ever printed and can fit in a lot of decks. It can fetch Twilight Drake for Dragon Pally, Novice Engineer for OTK, EVIL Cable Rat for Aggro, a variety of Murlocs, and a whole lot more.
---
Sure, they may not have a distinct identity conveyed through their cards this set, but I believe the versatility of many of these cards more than makes up for it.
---
[old] quest rogue synergy?
---
And even if you don’t bother apparently it’ll give you 3 solid choices at any point. 
---
Although for pros who put in the effort to learn him, he’s a very high skill ceiling card.
---
Okay but it’s dumb to wait to collect anything other than common right? All other cards should be crafted as needed.

I started playing back then and put maexxna in every deck. Of course it never turned out to be the best decision but hey, I was so happy I could put a legendary minion in a deck
---
Another card from this set that's pretty much a worse version of something from a previous expansion.

It’s an upside consistently for Shaman.  Shaman has always valued elementals, murlocs, and to a lesser extent, totems.  We still have [[Earthen Might]] and [[Elementary Reaction]] in the pool for the next 2 years.

2/-/- | Give a minion +2/+2. If it's an Elemental, add a random Elemental to your hand.

2/-/- | Draw a card. Copy it if you played an Elemental last turn.

I thought he was playing a guitar at first. Might be intentional given the flavor text.

No. Aggro is basically just "use high damage, low cost stuff to kill your opponent as quickly as possible" whereas token is more "use minions that generate minions to create a sticky yet relatively low-damage board presence and control the board until you get a big board-wide buff like savage roar or bloodlust as a finisher

“forgot to mention that paladin only has two barely viable decks in the current meta”

*cries in Druid*

Nerf it to a 4/5. Then I think since it's overcosted at 10 mana and 2 cards, make it 4 mana. But you can only play it on turn 10. Wait, shit, now you can play 2 on face. Let's make it just target minions.
---
Balanced card, let's effectively give it Rush, as Mage is weak right now.
---
Any midrange or control variant will auto-include these for sure
---
I mean, this card still is really good on turn 6 lmao
---
Which one in particular?
---
I’m curious what the discussion was for this card costing 2 instead of 3. You discount your secret by 1 and tutor it, and you can invest the mana early and play it later for the perfect moment or a combo of some sort. It’s already strictly good in a secret deck at 3 mana, 2 just seems overkill

Awesome! Thanks so much for posting this!

Why are you comparing wildly different cards with wildly different purposes?
---
Discardlocks may like this card
---
this was toasts card btw

One aspect of this card showcased in the reveal stream is that it’s also basically a +7 completion to the hunter quest, which is one of the decks I’m sure it’ll be run in. It also helps with Beast synergies. But yeah otherwise I can see both sides regarding this card, I don’t think it’ll end up being as broken as most people think.

It's a bad card, but intends to work with cards like [[fiery temper]], [[extractor demon]], and [[deep analysis]], as well as a counter to cards like [[ebony owl netsuke]]. There's basically no reason to run it nowadays, given that [[Lion's Eye Diamond]] is basically it except costs -3 mana instead of 1, and is older than one with nothing. One with nothing is technically playable in modern, whereas LED is not, but typically self-mill strategies are stronger than self-discard strategies. EX Dredgevine, a self mill deck, is the strongest deck in modern, while the closest thing we have to a self-discard deck is Mardu Pyromancer, which uses cards like [[faithless looting]] and [[seasoned pyromancer]] to power up [[bedlam reveller]] and [[lingering souls]], turning the card disadvantage into a temp advantage u/mtgcardfetcher

I believe brave frontier is also one of the top mobile games also
