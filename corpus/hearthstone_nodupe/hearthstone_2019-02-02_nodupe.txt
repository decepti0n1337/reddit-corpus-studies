I'm actually really excited for the Brawl they did recently, where you could only use the cards from the four expansions (and not Classic). I'd love to see how that changes their view on the sets and possible future designs.

---
I thin it depends how they do the balance changes.  Nerfs that are like "your deck is now just bad and so is anything else in that  class archetype, and you get no dust refunds because we nerfed a basic card" can't be too frequent.
---
The only ramp spell that could ever be considered tempo-negative is wild growth, but that comes down on turn 2 where it does not really matter all that much to lose a turn. Would you rather play a knife juggler or a wild growth? If you answered knife juggler then you're an idiot. As for the other ramp spells:
---
Nourish? Gives you back two full mana crystals the turn you play it.  
---
Darnassus aspirant? Passes the vanilla-test as a 2/3 for 2 mana, does not slow down your tempo in the slightest.
---
Jade blossom? Gives you a 1/1 at the absolute worst and +1/+1 to every following jade card.
---
Greedy sprite? Slightly below curve, but still an okay creature if you consider the ramp aspect of it.
---
Innervate? The definition of a tempo-play, giving up an additional card to ramp out a creature ahead of curve.
---
I don't really see any cards here where you "lose your tempo" by "spending your whole turn ramping". Even if you did lose tempo by playing those cards you can make up the lost tempo on the next turn by having more mana available and from then on you are permanently ahead of your opponent.
---
If you coin out a wild growth it's like you changed from "going second" to "going first". How is that negative tempo again?
---
made a spinoff from your deck list to replace the cards I don't have

equality and flametongue nerfs suck, but this coldblood thing was long overdue, kinda stupid to give this start to  rogues without any real counter most of the time... and hunters deserve every single nerf they get, stupidly dumb and overpowered class...
---
Wow I thought that Warsong was OP but with that new information I can now confidently say it's trash tier
---
I loved that brawl!
---
I want more of it. It was amazing to see what the game was like sans classic. 
---
He talks about Even Shaman (and Odd Rogue) being a powerful deck and uses this as a justification for the Flametongue nerf.  
---
Yet the Data Reaper reports clearly show that Shaman is the least played class in the game (3.7% of decks), and has been in a pretty sorry state for over a year now.
---
Only Shudderwock temporarily boosted Shaman numbers until it got nerfed and that deck didn't even run Flametongue.  
---
Is Even Shaman actually overpowered right now?  
---
It’s 10 face, a 2/2 break the shield, then they 5/x and a 2/2 kill Tyrion, face with the 5/3, the 3/1 and a 2/2
---
Raising health does a really good job for aggro as well though.  If an aggro deck could choose minions with +2 health, they would definitely take it, probably over the +2 attack unless you're face hunter.  
---
Literally unplayable
---
Probably that during the lunar event, the in game quests for gold will give more gold and also arcane dust. 
---
I also love that it is referencing this subreddit on how it is supposed to work.
---
probably just to make it different
---
Have you defeated the mode with every shrine, or do you have a few favorites that you revisit a lot? I recently started attempting to "100%" the mode by winning with every shrine and am currently at 9/27 complete.
---
I don't find the a fault.  Its a business decision, QA/developer resources that would be better used on the next set have to be re tasked to this set.  The idea that they are doing this for LOLs in the middle of a healthy meta, instead of prepping for next year's rollout, is ludicrous.
---
You don't know anything about this industry, you are just a fan.
---
Right now Shrink Ray may replace Equality as a board "clear". 6mana Wild Pyro + Equality to clear the board still isn't bad. Even 8 mana Equality + Consecration still isn't that bad. It will definitely make the combos much less of a swing though because you can't immediately play your own minions on the empty board.
---
10 mana 1/1 and still broken 
---
That only really affects one deck though, and only makes them more vulnerable to more aggressive decks.
---
So they'd work if they were in your opening hand, right? This change, along with making them always in hand pre-mulligan (so that you can choose based on the matchup to throw them back and get a better card, or keep them and have the upgraded hero power) would actually be interesting. Probably terrible, but interesting.
---
This is pretty silly tbh.   
---
Think of it this way. If you have a minion that is ready to attack and use faceless on it...does that minion have the ability to attack? No...that faceless minion has summoning sickness. The charge affect lets you attack on the first turn minions only, but that faceless still has summoning sickness.
---
Pretty straight forward when you look at it like this. Otherwise faceless would be a constant charge minion.
---
I probably do this so often - I emote "greetings" at the beginning of every game, but usually no one greets back. When they do, I forget if I've "greetings" already and don't want to leave them hanging...
---
I'm definitely still mad about the cubelock nerfs :&lt;

Lol what? This community usually goes into a frenzy of outrage claiming how every balance change is the worst thing that could ever happen and how team 5 are idiots.
---
Have you even been to this sub? 
---
No, I mean if you draw malygos then you need the  baleful banker to get one more, otherwise you're counting on luck
---
Uh. Lol.
---
The irony.
---
Holy shit, this is a great idea! Thank you kind stranger! 
---
Blizzard hard nerfs the fuck out of cards all the time.  People keep talking about balanced when they just spent the last 3 years of balance patched gutting cards.  The game is better off without these cards then with them.  Get rid of them. 
---
Actually idk bc you need the malygos on the board to stash it then galaxy 
---
Nice! Academic Espionage is the card i have more fun playing with rn, trying to make decks and something... i'll try your 2nd deck since i'm lacking cards from the 1st, thanks for sharing!
---
&gt; The only format you play. And it is not Standard. So you have to ask yourself how relevant that is to the playerbase at large.
---
If you think nerfing the base sets doesn't impact Wild then you're in for a fucking shock. 
---
&gt; you do not represent the majority of the playerbase in your playstyle.
---
Did I say I did? What part of this
---
&gt;all these nerfs have done is ruined the only format I play. The Wild meta is a fucking disaster because of these nerfs and I know for a fact Blizzard will not address this as they implemented the change to Naga Sea Witch YEARS after its release and waited over 7 months to nerf it. That card was fucking degenerate and they didn't touch it, but then they're going to nerf Equality for the rest of Wild's history? Fuck that, that's horrible game design.
---
or this
---
&gt; All the last 3 sets of nerfs have done in Wild is push the 3 decks that held Big Priest in line (Kingsbane Rogue, Even Shaman, Star Aligner Druid) to the bottom of the tier list, leaving Big Priest as the only tier 1 deck besides Renolock. Feels real fucking Wild right now.
---
about my playstyle? That is meta analysis of the format I play. You're just an asshole.
---
Why do you think that Activision would do that in the first place? Blizzard has made some bad decisions recently and everyone blames Activision. In all seriousness Activision-Blizzard have CoD and WoW making most of their cash, so why would they go after a card-game to lower the number of players? They are basically killing Hearthstone with no replacement, and Activision and blizzard have equal say in publishing with majority of control on blizzard for blizzard games and vice versa. Blaming another company for failures is stupid unless you intend to credit them in the good times of Hearthstone, as their power over it is equal to what it was before
---
Well it's stops you from taking 20 damage in one turn
---
It's simple, just have emperor live for 3 turns.
---
I don't know, because I don't pretend to have the prescience of a deity. I have no idea what the next 3 card sets will look like, nevermind beyond that -- *all* of which Equality and Hunter's Mark have the potential to impact in their nerfs.
---
Which is exactly why I used the rotations and nerfs of cards already in the Classic/Basic set as an example. How different would the meta look with 5 Mana Auctioneer, 4 Mana Leeroy, 2 Mana Owl, old Force of Nature, 2-cards Ancient of Lore? Etc.
---
And then you realise that these cards having been nerfed has thus had an impact on the metagame for much, most, or even *all* this time.
---
My not knowing doesn't discredit any of what I said. I'm just not bigheaded enough to act like any *specific* prediction I make is good enough to stand as an actual argument. 
---
So I give you the broad prediction that all four Classic/Basic nerfs will have a bare minimum *some* impact on the meta over the next year or two. The same way the Force of Nature change (among the other Druid card changes) has had a profound impact on Druid deck construction since its change years ago.
---
Ooooh, okay that makes so much more sense now.
---
Smorking kills
---
Ahh, that makes more sense now and that's a neat take on it.  
---
Haha, get over yourself. I frequent this subreddit. I saw a new thread, saw that the OP was spouting the same nonsense I encountered a few days back, looked through my history and saw that it was you.
---
I clearly demonstrated how incorrect your idea was in that thread. Even if I was wrong, a poll wouldn't help your argument. If anything, it shows you fail to even understand what it is you're trying to argue.
---
Well I've never won 100g by winning 30 games one day... Don't know what it looks like :(
---
&gt; If you think nerfing the base sets doesn't impact Wild then you're in for a fucking shock.
---
Lol.
---
Come on, man.
---
Let me be explicitly clear: **Wild is not the primary concern.** Never has been, and never will be. Sorry to say it so bluntly, but that's that. They care more about Standard and its playerbase.
---
&gt; You're just an asshole.
---
For telling you that I can't use or care for your anecdote when talking about something that involves far more than both of us?
---
Okay then, lol.
---
Where have I followed you to another thread to continue dumping on you?  or do you not understand what irony is?
---
Lol are you kidding? There's no endgame, just more reasons to buy packs because viable classic cards are becoming less common.
---
Its tempo negitive because you don't interact with the board, giving up a card and a turn to get ahead of curve. Nourish giving you two mana the turn you play is still tempo negitive *because you had 5 to start with*. Playing a two drop and passing on turn 5 is a negitive tempo play because your opponent played a 5 drop.
---
Thats all tempo is, its not bad to ramp but it costs you cards in the moment, you trade tempo now for more later. In hearthstone early turns and tempo can matter much more.
---
Innvervate isn't ramp, noone classes it as that. Rouge coins aren't ramp, its basically a ritual, trading a card for a brief advantage.
---
Well at higher ranks than 25 (I.e. lower numbers), the vast majority of players have either been playing for a long time or have spent money on packs in order to craft strong decks. It’s only at the 26-50 ranks where you find the true “I just started” players, or people who have started alt accounts and don’t have enough of a collection to run anything but hodgepodge decks, as you call them.
---
The reality is that even at rank 20, the only decks that can climb are well constructed decks that don’t overly rely on basic neutral cards or unfocused strategies. As a result, players either run meta decks or they lose. People like to win, and so that’s why the meta resolves around the same decks/strategies.
---
It’s a long term problem with the game and one of the reasons people call for alternate modes, rotating core sets, etc. 
---
No, you're absolutely pestering him. No way it wasn't the case that you were stalking his account for several days till you saw he posted again on /r/hearthstone.^/s
---
But that would buff odd shaman, /s
---
I'll own this one.  I clicked on your comments and thought this was to my poll thread.  \*opens mouth and inserts foot
---
Did you buff the cthun more after you played it but before playing sudden genesis?
---
Nah. If you look at the sidebar it shows that I didn’t. No idea how this happened.
---
Dragon's roar is not a tempo play. If you coined out a 2 drop for the board, then that would be fine.
---
Also, just because you won the game doesn't mean you made the optimal play. 
---
You have been following me around dumping on me.  I shouldn't have projected your crappiness onto chasmang
---
new update
---
In that case, BLIZZARD!!!
---
I think it's a joke about Griftah's behaviour. In World of Warcraft, he sells you items that enable you to do things you can... do anyway.
---
Like jumping. From the "Stone of Stupendous Springing Strides."
---
Or healing from eating and regaining Mana from drinking. From the  "Polished Pendant of Edible Energy."
---
In other words, he's trying to rip you off into crafting him.
---
It actually looks like the Sudden Genesis copied the Minion’s stats as is (which makes sense), then the game realized that the minion created is a C’Thun and gave it its buffs. 
---
Surprisingly enough, that looks correct
---
I would assume that it doesn’t keep the Charge keyword on the second turn, which isn’t clear from the wording, but probably what’s happened here.
---
Oh, boy...
---
It's not weird at all for the exact reasons you gave. They're two different abilities. Them costing the same doesn't mean one is off.
---
I hate to say it but I bet there are many more potential situations like this.
---
Blizzard is sloppy with their cars texts &amp; have little holding them accountable.
---
I can just see this guy at his computer just looking back and forth at the combo thinking he’s cracked the meta wide open, scrounging through his collection to find cards to dust, making the deck, and then finally the disappointment when it doesn’t work. 
---
Hey guys we have just hotfixed the glitch which could allow players to gain gold through playing this game!
---
Emeriss and Dragon Roar is a match made in heaven. Got the same thing off in my Dragon Warrior deck, but I had the troll legendary to copy them and ended up with a bunch of insanely overstatted minions 
---
If Genn/Baku had "Start of Game: Draw one less card" would that be a reasonable nerf?  
---
We're not on the same page here, man. Just look at the VS report and check out how all the control decks are dead and buried because unless you can OTK or combo you can't win. These are not the same archetypes anymore. Alex + Grom could be beat. Four horseman can't.
---
With a rotating set you can also bring back cards and maybe throw in some alternate art, maybe a deathknight or 2 stick around, maybe kelthuzad makes a reappearance. It does have to be all new fully fleshed out core set.

What happens in the smorking room?
---
This is true.
---
The hunter's soul leaving the game
---
Found the hunter player
---
&gt; I think prime targets for HOF are the Loot hoarders and novice engineers. Notice how many solitaire decks use these.
---
That's mainly because most classes that want to run combo decks don't have access to the better class-specific draw options that decks like Druid, Warlock, and Warrior have. There are also very few neutral options for card draw, so of course Novice Engineer and Loot Hoarder get used a lot.
---
Time Out is easily the most broken class card of this entire year.
---
Yes, it can replace the spot Rag or Sylvanas left open.
---
Hogger isn’t that good
---
Oh yeah, so many hypocrites suddenly jump out from the woods...what were you doing when Warrior gutted by Fiery Waraxe nerf? Laughing? Now it is your favourite class turn and you can just whine nonstop? Listen, Blizzard gonna nerf everyclass signature cards to keep the balance. Warrior, Mage, Druid, Hunter, Shaman, Paladin, Rogue got hit. Now, its Priest turn and the card they gonna nerf for me will be Power words : Shield. 1  mana card draw is already OP really
---
Odd Paladin didn't use Shrink Ray, so why would they use Equality with no way to combo it? The reason why Equality got nerfed to 4 was to keep it in Even Paladin so that deck still has a board clear.
---
Don't you think the death rattle version is a lil bit overkill on the card draw? I think you may add some deathrattle cards with more utility
---
By the holy light!

OP didn't say it's not working properly, he said Jaraxxus is already a bad card that noone ever plays. Do we honestly need the insta lose condition for such a card?
---
I don't think so. If you copy a minion that's affected by any other aura - say, raid leader - you don't get double the effect of that aura. 
---
Genn is only really a problem in 2 classes: Shaman and Warlock. Even Warlock can get a turn 3 Mountain Giant, and Even Shaman has a host of cards that benefit (Eel, Thing from Below, Draenei Totemcarver, and Flametongue Totem) from the cheaper totems.
---
"Quest were a mistake!", "Hero cards were a mistake", "weapons are a mistake", "charge was a mistake". Damn, man, its like for some people Hearthstone its just a whole mistake that have been around for 4-5 years
---
1st game, spell hunter.  Had no trouble answering everything but then his Rhok'delar reload bursted me down.  Actually thought I was gonna win in fatigue (he had used Tracking and had 4 cards left in deck, nearly empty hand.  I had a lot of cards left.)
---
2nd game Dead Man's Hand warrior.  Kind of an auto-loss.
---
What turn is "this turn"? There is no indication that it should also affect facelessed copies on turns when charge wasn't played!
---
Next time : weekly post about putting Whizbang on classic set !
---
&gt; How can you make that argument but completely ignore the possibility of new decks springing up and becoming relevant parts of future metas because cards like 2 mana Flametongue Totem or 2 mana Equality are allowed to exist in the game?
---
I'm not ignoring that.
---
But then, I'm still playing against the same 2 Mana Flametongue and Equality that I have for years, aren't I?
---
Same reason I wouldn't mind Frostbolt or Fireball or Flamestrike rotating out. Yes, they're really good cards while not being "oppressive," but if any Control Mage I go up against is running Flamestrike, it doesn't matter too much what new fancy shenanigans they're running. I'm still playing around that Turn 7 board clear. The play pattern is the same.
---
&gt; Even ignoring the impact on the diversity of the current meta and only considering the future (past the next rotation and beyond), how the hell do the two not at least balance each other out?
---
Because if they "balance each other out," then by default that is better in my opinion. Because now I'm not playing against the same cards and designs I have for years.
---
This, by the way, is why I preferred Flametongue Totem and Cold Blood specifically to *rotate out.* Because I think they were overkilled -- I think the other nerfs were justified, and that Hunter's Mark and Equality could stand being taken down a peg or two.
---
But Flametongue Totem and Cold Blood were well balanced in my opinion, and I just think a rotation would have suited just as well for them. Better than a nerf, hence why I would prefer it. Because there's no reason you can't *rotate them back in* to switch things up once again after a few years, and have them enable new decks to spring up and become relevant parts of future metas like you described.
---
Rotation is not a bad thing, and I don't mean it as a special code word to say "Throw in the bin." I absolutely want Ragnaros the Firelord or Sylvanas to return to Standard some day, if only for a year or two before they reenter the Hall of Fame. I think the same can be said for lots of beautiful cards that have rotated naturally, like Reno Jackson, or Justicar Trueheart, or Gormok the Impaler.

Hey everybody - Background, I'm a competitive hearthstone player that didn't really touch wild until the announcement of Blizzard's Wild Open tournament...and to be honest after playing wild for a while now, I actually had a lot of fun.
---
There's something about playing older familiar cards that evoke nostalgic emotions (sometimes positive...sometimes negative). Overall I wanted to share a really fun video capturing how the wild meta is still developing and to celebrate wild as a format. 
---
The video posted is a snippet of the journey I took towards attempting to qualify (finishing top 100 legend) the past month. Here's the [FULL VIDEO](https://youtu.be/i1pm17nPT60) if you are interested. Hope you all enjoy and please consider queuing up a wild game here and there!
---
Also the song is fire. 
---
not one but 2!
---
I get what youre saying. 
---
How prevalent does a card have to be, to say that it should be nerfed? Look back at the past 3 or 4 wild meta reports. From the past 2 I read, Even/Odd decks made up about 40% of the tier 1 and 2 wild meta decks (5/12 and 5/13). And like I've said the problem is that these decks play out extremely similarly, by design, every game. So they make up currently 40% of the meta decks in wild (probably SIGNIFICANTLY more in actual playrates percentages vs deck variety numbers shown here) AND by design are repetitive. 
---
Reno Priest and Reno Warlock were both on both of those lists, too.
---
I can't see how you argue that even/odd decks are fine because they always ene on turn 4, because half of the good even/odd decks are midrangey (evenlock, even shaman is a bit on the quicker side, and odd warrior is the antithesis of quick games), of course the paladins and the rogues are much faster, but on average the Genn/Baku cant be that much faster than a typical deck.
---
So antifun aside, how meta defining do cards need to be to warrant change is an interesting question. 
---
And like I said even if you don't care about wild and think it should be left unbalanced/untuned, these cards in standard are gonna suuuuck for another year, so i'm praying for at least something to address them in standard 
---
Togwaggle / Hakkar is viable. Togwaggle / Azalina is too slow. 
---
The card we’ll get as the “answer” to Baku/Genn and OP hero cards. 
---
This will backfire and be bitched about more than the cards it was designed to counter.
---
Dude have you seen wild Odd paladin? 
---
An effect like this would need to cost at least four.
---
The higher your rank the less of these people you see.  Sometimes at higher ranks you’ll still queue into people who emote a lot but it’s almost always someone playing a polarized deck and you’re their good matchup.  Much more common will be that you both emote “Wow” when RNG screws one of you over, plus people who always say “Well Played” at the end as a part of good sportsmanship.
---
it's so funny to see anyone on this sub say that after the whine fest that was the pirate warrior/aggro shaman metas lmao.  god you couldn't even say 'i like aggro' without being downvoted to hell.  now everybody wants their aggro savior!!  
---
Wait, what? The deck with cheaty anklebiters, novice engineer and acolyte of pain, that uses the soularium as a "discard 3 cards from your deck" card, has Godfrey as the only non-combo piece above 5 mana and fully intends on decking itsekf by turn 10 is control? *seriously*?
---
Well I have a different question about that, I'll try and pm you about it

---
How did you face talanji with a priest shrine
---
Just do some other restriction.   Like when they are in your deck you start the game with one less card in your opening hand or even two less. Whatever makes people seriously think twice about using them.  They better really love that hero power upgrade.   Evenlock would survive but maybe not something like odd rogue with a restriction like that.   They need to force more support cards into the decks to make them interesting and less ubiquitous.   It shouldn’t just be shove Genn and Baku into a deck with even or odd cards.  
---
But why give the buff when you copy the minion. It has no sense. In my opinion it is a bug. There should not be any buff when you copy Cthun
---
I truly believe now that we'll see hero power disruption in the next expansion and Blizzard will herald it as they great new way to interact with your opponent. Don't bother actually making Baku balanced, just print new cards that "fix" the problem.
---
A lot of beefy pesky rascals huh

There was a time when old monthly cardbacks mattered but not anymore. No one gives a fuck about how long you’ve been playing Hearthstone, especially now. The gap between veteran players and new players has become wider and wider over the years. You look at new players joining Hearthstone at the moment, they are guaranteed to quit within the single standard cycle. These players aren’t going to sit in games jaws on the floor with awe because they see a Pandaria cardback. It doesn’t mean shit to them.
---
Now, players that really become invested in Hearthstone later on realizing they are locked out of free items that could have attained only to find out they can’t because they played in 2020 and not in 2014 isn’t necessarily going to leave them feeling all warm and fuzzy either.
---
Holding monthly cardbacks to such a high dumbass standard diminishes genuine achivement cardbacks such as eSport attdendence and finishes and exclusive cardbacks that people went out of their way to pay money for. The logic behind that is stupid. Either make all of it forever unavailable or only make tavern brawl and monthly cardbacks available again.

I don't agree with everything you say, but the equality nerf feels right. Equality Pyro and equality consecration were always too good. It's probably the reason we haven't seen good pally control tools in a while until now. If anything, this should allow some experimentation in that direction.

Faster fatigue for them and really strong tools to kill them with. It really hits hard when you start stealing their treasure cards off their deck early on.

Rogue is my favourite too.

I'm playing this deck and I'm enjoying it a lot. I think it's perfect as control rogue, it's quite slow but funnier than the other high tier decks right now. Here the code, let me know what you think

Agree to disagree, Id rather believe the developers statement than a conspiracy theory
---
Funny, because only kids have problems with "toxic players which hurt your feelings". And you then wonder why you get bullied and beaten up in school...
---
I dont play any of these classes and its still bad. Why didnt they nerf Rexxar? What about Candleshoot? And Cube. These nerfs are just not enough. 
---
I have 80g, i'm adding you
---
I don't see any ***body*** in this pic
---
Odd rogue is still very powerful, they just have slightly less reach now. People thought the Level up! nerf would kill odd paladin, but the main problem with odd and even decks is the hero power. Nerfing the cards is all good and fun but it doesn't seem to have much of an affect on these decks. 
---
I doubt Kingsbane can be good enough without their broken deal 8+, heal 8+ every turn, and quest rogue sucks. 
---
Didn’t you get the memo for OTKstone?

---
I made the comment in reference to the suggestion that genn baku buff minion attacks by 1 in decks that they are in
---
A person commented every deck would become 28 cards plus 2 - aluding to them all being minon based
---
Hence the comment - rip spell hunter
---
Please no. No more shitty draw this to win fixes like geist. They are terrible. Fix the fucking card you wanna fix, don't make increased draw rng a part of every expansion. 
---
blizzard only wants cash .
---
I think I feel my deck slots slipping away...
---
You dont get double effect but let say i have a 2/2 minion, i play raid lider, now is a 3/2, right? Well lets swap attack and health, now is a 2/3 base and with the buff is now a 3/3, same thing happends with stormwind champion, from 2/2 to a 3/3 now swap, the minion is now a base 3/3 and get the buff and now is a 4/4
---
I like changes. Regardless of what nerfs they are. All these cards were strong and I don't mind them being brought down a peg.
---
However big priest needs a nerf in wild, and also genn and Baku. But can't have everything at once. One day I think big priest and genn Baku will be nerfed.

Tempo vs value is a question as old as the genre itself.
---
It depends on what your next play(s) are and how much you know on your opponents deck list, mulligan and matchup.
---
The pirate decks is one of the stronger decks? Is that a joke?
---
You really think Equality was broken, and that its somehow balanced now? Good lord, you must have Gary Busey levels of brain damage.
---
These nerfs are so crazy. Why equality and flame-tongue? Thats seems so random.
---
It's just my honest opinion as a player, no need to get stressed about it :) Have a good day.
---
It copies the minion and enchantments. It doesn't become the minion, which is why it will be asleep when targeting something vanilla. Perfectly consistent.
---
Its less about whats the immediate impact and more about these cards are all overpowered compared to other cards and need nerfs. There are lots more needing nerfs in the classic set. Equality at 2 mana is super BS if you think about it. Flametongue needs a nerf even if no one is playing shaman. When shamanstone was around I'm sure there wouldve been no complaints of this nerf.
---
"this turn" is the turn where its played. And yeah charge card wording should be uptdated to "give a friendly minion rush"
---
And what happened to you isnt a bug. You copied a minion that had rush. Dont try to be queue with semantics, hearthstone doesnt care about semantics. 
---
Hope you can still find fun in hearthstone and if you dont.. well dont feel too bad. Game sucks.
---
The only problem i can see is that people make decks around the upgraded hero power. Odd mage uses janalai, fire eater ect, odd rougue uses deadly poison, odd and even paladin use silverhand synergies. I think that a rework of the current upgraded hero powers would be better.
---
Because there is not enough randomness in Hearthstone, we gotta add more! 
---
Thanks! I have some other ideas I have already made and I am not a part of the balanced team but I think they are fairly balanced. My biggest idea with this is each class getting a "Champion" that has a heroic ability. For example, Hunter has an 8 Mana 7/7 (all 8 mana 7/7's) Heroic: Summon an Animal Companion, cause what is a hunter without his little friend. Is this stuff I should post to the subreddit in more detail do you think or no cause I already made this post?
---
I think its a good nerf. 4 mana remove all minions was way too overpowered. I dont think it would have worked at 3 mana because odd paladin has silverhand recruits it could use in conjunction to punch through taunts.
---
You should make a big post with all the ideas you've already come up with, I'd say!
---
Sorry, I have no glue about this.

---
Have a banlist. Banned cards still could be played in CASUAL MODES but not RANKED MODES
---
Easy fix. 
---
Not really, since it’s either hand disruption, or an obvious trap to gain some health. You’re combo SHOULDN’T be unbeatable in the first place, but warlock is the only one in standard that can destroy it. 
---
In combination with Shirvalla and Kangor.
---
Nice!! I think Capitalism should cost 1 mana and overload 9. Low cost with great debt.
---
Because if HP is not good, as in really really good, there is almost no point on stopping it for 1 turn, or copying it.

Imagine a world where no deck runs minions, is MCT actually a good card?

---
If you look at Google trends HS grew until MSoG and has shrunk since. For the first part of the life cycle you want to concentrate on new players but after the peak you need to switch to the existing player base (which they are slowly coming around to).
---
It is though, and I’m sorry you can’t see that. Unless you can enlighten me how that’s not how it works at all?
---
Craft all Murlot’s and get the legendary Murloc you can dez!
---
So I think everything bout it is great except for the fact that the final boss starts with 3 Mana (2+1) and many games you essentially lose on turn 1. What I mean is regardless of what your plays are for the entire game it's not possible to win.
---
In dungeon run that was almost non existent. Complete vs togglewaggle draws could give you a 0% chance to win but it usually felt like you still had 5-20% chance to win. I have about 145 clears (probably around 2200 wins) in dungeon run and did about 10 clears in  RR but just can't get into it. No matter how many tries I give it.
---
it works one time bro :/
---
Because even shaman is out of control in Wild. 
---
One big post for this ability
---
So the real reward was not the number 0 in the centre of the screen… but the one in the lower left corner!
---
&gt;Not sure how people miss the fact that good cards that are around forever getting changed or rotated makes for a big deal when it comes to Constructed gameplay in the long run.
---
Problem is, in the long term, we are all dead. The real question is the meta until the rotation. If you want to fix things for the long term you do it at rotation so as not to invalidate decks.
---
CHEETIN? I NEVAH FIGHT FAIR.
---
Looks cool. Might try it out.
---
That is a very convoluted way of explaining that lmao
---
Just a little bit delay without changing the core effect should be fine.
---
Rogue cannot contest opening minions witha turn-2 2/2 weapon.
---
Warlock can't tap turn-1 and cheat Mountain Giant asap.
---
Warrior isn't fast enoguh to collect too much armor in the opening. Should be countered by aggro.
---
etc.
---
This is why Odd and Even cards was a mistake, they’re going to have to do this shit all the time to swap the values on cards and it’s not going to get better when they move to just Wild

Honestly just remove the cards and admit it was a mistake

How would you ever make Baku/Genn balanced though? It could be a 10 mana 1/1, it wouldn't matter. You never wanna draw it already anyway. 
---
Make "no" mana like shifting scroll but declare an alternate cost in the text. Like make it WL only and have it say "Discard two cards" in addition to the text.
---
Disrupting the opponent is a WL thing anyway.
---
Nope, that's why the names are a combination of letters and #1234 so that even if the name is already in use, you can still have it with your personal humber. It's actually great so you don't have names like alex123, 4l3x and so on.

Hunter's Mark used to be 0.
---
It was total bullshit at that cost.  I groaned whenever my opponent cast it regardless of what deck I was playing.  And Candleshot didn't exist back then.  Just saying.
---
I thought it was OK at 1 mana, but I checked HSReplay statistics on Standard, and it's the 11th most played card in Hunter, 20th most played card across all classes, and currently played in games more frequently than cards such as Freezing Trap, Explosive Trap, Deathstalker Rexxar, Keleseth, Kobold Librarian, Mind Blast, Fungalmancer.  It's clearly still reasonably high power at 1 mana.
---
Is this the gronk the raptor nerf?
---
Yes
---
That's basically what I said.
---
Many ppl asking for a dirty rat in classic but combo decks losing to geist should exist. Just cause u play slow decks u should lose to combo otks? Not of u can disrupt them. Thats tbe whole point of interacting with opponents 
---
For clarification, I was playing a homebrew shaman deck in casual (I'm rank 20). This guy was playing aggro odd rogue (rank 4), and decides to add me after he concedes against tar creeper into spell totem and lightning storm.

In a hypothetical perfect system, if true capitalism existed, the cost to consumers for products and services would be as low as physically possible. Of course, we don't exist in a vacuum, which is why laws and regulations exist; however, communism is on the far other end of the scale. Socialized programs are generally more expensive and inefficient than private.

Spot on. None of the people who praise Communism or Socialism have any clue how it functions, or why it wont work in the real world, where greed is still a part of human nature...
---
I remember it being played a lot at zero.
---
&gt;you're selective in which propaganda you believe
---
Yes, exactly correct. Some things which are exaggerated or heavily hyperbolized are worth additional scrutiny; and among them, some hold up better than others to that scrutiny. Pertaining to this specific instance, I believe the documentation of the events of the Holocaust to hold more weight than the claims of "100 million" preventable deaths occurring under regimes which purported themselves as socialist.
---
Yeah, from the pic it seems that Mecha'thun costs 9 and he's in fatigue so he must be running just one galvanizer. Idk, bloodbloom+cataclysm is way more efficient than this. Maybe if you lack the cards but you happen to have mecha'thun, you could give it a shot. But other than that, if you wanna craft the full deck, don't go cheap on the combo.

When you send a copy of cthun to your deck it does not add again the buff. Why should it add when you copy on the board?
---
Hey, at least in capitalism your crystals keep increasing, with communism they stay at 2.
---
They don't really warp anything; they created new(ish) archetypes that just so happen to be very strong in a couple cases.
---
The way a Warrior uses Baku the Mooneater is very, very different from how Paladin uses it.
---
Sounds like someone just lost to a shudderwock deck
---
 Oh, gosh, you've no idea what communism is. I could lecture you for a while, but, know what? I don't care :) 
---
Maybe not very balanced but I would play the hell out of that card to shut down Odd Paladin and make Warrior games a litlle more bearable. However the wording on this is not very clear. Baku and Genn both make the game *start* with an upgraded hero power so would that work? To make it more clear I would word it more like "Change your opponent's Hero Power to a basic one" or something like that.
---
There's a half million ways to make it a powerful not not auto-include card an entire deck is built around. Lower it's cost and maybe stats to a playable range and make its effect a battlecry. Or have it only affect your first X hero powers. Or have it cycle between unupgraded and upgraded hero powers. Or make it a pseudo-quest where it starts in your hand as a 1 cost neutral card which would reduce your hand by 1 and prevent runaway turn 1 bullshit.
---
That's with 60 seconds of thought.
---
If the effect is going to be immediate, it shouldn't be permanent. If the effect is permanent, it shouldn't be really powerful. If it's really powerful it can't be immediate. All of this on top of in all fairness a very very manageable "restriction" for several classes.
---
That doesn’t seem ideal so I tend to disagree with that statement. An ideal Free Market System works very similarly to a communist society, where in that everyone gets what they need through the kindness and willingness of others to give. That would be ideal, but humans are selfish
---

---
Who also are victims of the global capitalist system created by the western world.
---
Play Floop and Starfall if you see that many decks running Geist. There is currently no competetive deck in the meta that actually runs it but. You can tech against it if you want.
---
we live in a society
---
At four mana for equality you still have the wildpyro clear for a total cost of six and the consecration clear for a total of 8.  Still viable--though obviously not as good.  
---
Well someone was sick of Odd Paladin.
---
Nowhere on reddit is safe. Everything is political apparently. Can we just not?
---
That would make them into fundamentally different cards, and that is not how card changes should be done. Thankfully, that has only ever happened once in the entire history of the game with Force of Nature, and Baku and Genn should not be the recipient of the same treatment.
---
Targeting the specific hero powers that cause issue, The Silver Hand, Tank Up, one mana Life Tap, etc., and making whatever Hero Power upgrades each card then offers specific only to them as to avoid affecting cards like Justicar would be the most appropriate change to the cards if any.
---
I don’t deserve shit because I haven’t worked for shit.  Once I’m educated or experienced AND work to the best of my ability then I will deserve something.
---
It is a bit different. Warlockk may have a lot of super board clears but they can't really use them as well as Paladin. Paladins can fill there boards up quick and strongly after they remove a board, Warlocks can't without substitute cards like Guldan. Besides, clearing the board is a part of Warlock's cataclysmic flavor.
---
If ever one has one kid then it’s nerfed to 0.5 health 
---
At least 7 I'd say.
---
Like 7 mana 5/5
---
Are you still available? Just added you.
---
When you have a full board you're already winning the game anyway and this could actually bite you in the ass because of Doomsayer (not that it's a very common pick in Arena but).
---
Can you post the codes for all 8
---
Lackey was the one card I think was rightfully nerfed. But my boy dark pact didn't deserve the hit (I did like how they needed Dark Pact though)
---
Dust you enjoy wasting isn't wasted dust
---
I hate it when people assume we live in a perfect world where the dev process is both flawless and brilliant, and also that their opinions are "obviously" the correct ones.
---
It's 2 attack if you cast it before an SI or Vilespine, which happens more than occasionally.  It's not always 4.
---
Which is A, very different from "control decks", and B, also odd distinction. Those decks all went for those win cons for a good reason, and control priest has been running mindblast for a very long time now.
---
Even if it's not wanted by Spell Hunter.... I'm sure Even Hunter gladly accept a 6 mana 12/12
---
There’s also Warsong, Blade Flurry, Tuskarr Totemic, Dreadsteed, Tinkmaster, Blood Imp, Charge, Yogg Saron, and Unleash the Hounds. If you want to be even pickier about the ones I selected, you could say that the most changed ones in terms of fundamentals were Warsong, Tinkmaster, Blood Imp, Charge, Yogg (he became a lot more of a gamble than a likely clear and draw card), and Hounds. 
---
That’s beside the point, though. I get that you want the cards to keep their spirit, and not in the Warsong Comannder meme way. The part that’s concerning for me about your argument (not the fact that you’re making it, just something I think that you might be overlooking) is that this approach might work right now, but it doesn’t hold up well in the future, both in Standard and Wild. They would have to constantly adjust which classes are affected and how based on future card releases and their interactions with the hero powers. If you change the bonus to something not related to hero powers, you don’t have to worry about it as much. You can simply tweak the bonus instead of having to tweak tons of other cards to work with the two legendaries. It’s also a lot less confusing in a game that tries to keep things relatively simple. 
---
I think it's funny and a perfect example of a shitpost of a terrible nerf, so it should stay
---
I disagree. I think a card as powerful as Hunter's Mark being around forever means that any card that can deal one fast damage will feel busted in Hunter. It's not *just* Candleshot, it's also Springpaw, the Battlecry of Deathstalker Rexxar, etc.
---
I agree that when a new expansion card comes out and is OP, a nerf is good, but I think the Classic set definitely needs some changing as well.
---
I don’t think Reno (nor Kazakus) is broken either. I just think that as more and more cards are added in the coming years, cards with super powerful deck building restrictions and buffs like Odd/Even/Highlander decks will push out other decks in the meta and stifle deck building creativity.
---
I think it would help against the win rate of those decks, but I don't think it would make those matchups feel any more interesting.
---
Yes it is
---
Imagine if Blizzard decided to nerf cards back in GvG.
---
We would have gotten a 4/2 shredder after 4 months of playing it as a 4/3, instead if seeing for two years.
---
Same can be said for Doctor Boom: 1-3 damage boom bots instead of 1-4.
---
Was it not good when Blizzard decided to nerf Small Time Buccaneer? 
---
Fuck it was great.
---
The problem is **what they choose to change.** When they change classic cards, that have no reason to be nerfed, you're gonna piss off a lot of fans
---
^(Pssst, not to be an asshole, but they already worked it out, that's the joke)
---
It's not, it's not charge. It has a spell called charge which basically is rush lol.
---
&gt;The reason you are getting downvoted is that nobody thinks that Faceless should be ready to attack on the turn summoned unless it has charge, which it does here. 
---
This is exactly what I'm saying...but OP is describing a scenario that doesn't fit with the basic mechanics of hearthstone. The assassin has the text of rush, which doesn't allow face damage on that turn of being summoned. The faceless is summoned and can't attack face that turn, which directly relates to the fact that faceless can't attack face on ANY minion that is ready to attack unless it has the affect of CHARGE(NOT THE CHARGE SPELL LOL)
---
You could just make it 
---
If any Hero Powers are upgraded return them to their original they cost (2)
---
So it wouldn't effect extra HPs
---
Typical bullshit response. 
---
It doesn't take a developer to have common sense.
---
Giving an already dominant deck access to a good card that it didn't have access to before would be an unnecessary buff. Pair this common knowledge with past changes to this game, that being nerfs to mana cost by TWO is a lot more uncommon than increasing a cost by 1.  
---
What reason would there be for them to up it by 2 instead of 1, as they usually do with cards? Easy. Because increasing it by 2 keeps the card even, which keeps Odd Paladin (A top tier deck as of this patch) from using it. Coincidence? Not at all. Its common sense to not buff a top tier deck.  
---
Hence, its stupid for them to say that Baku had no sway on the decision. One of Baku's best decks would be buffed by Equality going to 3, which would be a terrible idea. So it as upped to 4 instead.  
---
Also, you sound like you have a lot of faith in the wisdom of these developers. Personally, I can't see why you would. As someone who's been playing since beta, I've gone through many cycles of the game. And in my long experience, the Dev Team has been notoriously bad with balance. Easiest example to point out would be Patches. Another example is them giving Spreading Plague to druid.   
---
So yeah. I don't have any faith in them at all. And of course, I'm gonna call bullshit when I see it.  
---
Why would they nerf the most unique and integral part of HS instead of 2 cards printed 4 years after release?
---
Thanks!
---
I do agree with others. Just play wild. Standard keeps changing, and it can be hard to keep up. 
---
The issue is that there really isn't a way to meaningfully change Baku and genn. You could make it a ten mana 0/1 and it wouldn't effect it deck rates that much, most likely. They're already considered dead draws and often sit in people's hands for the entire game. That's why these cards are so bad for the meta, there's no way to stop their effect and the actual minion card is just an afterthought.
---
Yeah.  I'm still stuck on a few Dr. Boom level puzzles.  
---
It doesnt matter how much you love it. It is damaging to the game and will continue to be damaging for the rest of time. They were shit designs and it is Blizzards fault for not doing something about them sooner.
---
"I have fun with this deck" is not a good enough reason to leave them as they exist. Players had fun with Patches too. Doesn't mean you can just leave it be.
---
There is no option here that makes everyone happy, so they should go with the one that makes the game healthy.
---
Can confirm.

I can hear this cat snikering as it is played.
---
&gt; Yeah fuck blizzard fire the whole team and hire DarthGogeta to do all the balance work! He truly understands the game.  
---
  
---
My god how fucking stupid can someone be. You're a perfect example as to why inbreeding is illegal in most countries.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter that they have a stupid amount of data pouring in constantly and metrics on the individual performance of cards in decks.   
---
Like the data that they had before the first rogue quest nerf?  
---
&gt; You realize btw that they did nerf the rogue quest, twice?  
---
Thats the problem with you farmville players. You really dont understand that just because a card can be underpowerd and still be unhealthy for the game.
---
Because if it was a battlecry it would be overpowered. It is a tradeoff where the card will be kinda weak without the ability but strong with the ability of the requirements are met.
---
errr... 
---
I play wild. Standard is a god awful wasteland of flavor of the month decks propped up by whatever overpowered card was released 2 months ago.
---
Nerfing Patches like a month before rotation after it had terrorized standard for 2 years was one of the most blatant "fuck you"s to the player base I've ever seen from a developer. You had pro players making videos *1 week* into Mean Streets saying Patches was a huge mistake in design. They decided rather than take a huge revenue hit and give every player 1600 dust they would let the problem fester for 2 years. God only knows how many players they lost when they released that hilarious blog post saying they were finally nerfing him. I stopped playing for a long while. 
---
Oh no The Lich King, Hagatha and Corpsetakers are literally useless in other decks...
---
If you nerf the specific hero powers that are problematic and leave the other ones as they are (ej odd shaman's) then it'd be solved without completely ruining the point of the cards. 
---
Norwegian. Null is the word for both null and zero.
---
And forge back! 
---
??? Nerfs affect wild decks too. They have even made nerfs that specifically target wild decks(naga sea wtich, aviana). 
---
Also every time new expansion is released, wild decks got upgraded by new cards. Your wild decks will eventually get outclassed if you dont keep up by adding new cards.
---
Oof.. double oondasta.. with the grizzlies, bears and beast master
---
No demonbolt though?
---
We will have new metas after nerfs and after rotation+new expansion.
---
&gt; Archetypes get supporting cards, supporting cards make archetype too strong
---
Except the "supporting cards" didn't make the archetype too strong, it's the 2 broken neutral legendary cards that make the decks too strong, but they nerf cheap or free supporting cards.
---
Not exactly the best beast in that situation
---
Especially since Epics are usually the glue for weird archetypes, and those 800 dust really slam the door in your face if you wanna try new things
---
Odd rogue will still be viable. 
---
It’s okay, for Classic packs I’ve still somehow managed to open [[Patient Assassin]] and [[Ancient of War]] about six times each without getting a single Brawl or Shield Slam.
---
You asked us to deal with animation times, and we listened!

Giving dust refunds for every card in the deck is completely insane. Blizzard would lose so much money when a nerf to one card gives potentially over 7000 dust, and I think that’s completely overkill. 
---
I do agree it’s pretty unfair that people spend so much dust on deck just for it to be nerfed and not getting any help to craft a new deck. But being to disenchant every card from that deck is also pretty bad. Just because flametongue/equality were nerfed doesn’t mean that the rest of the cards are made unplayable, and i think it’s a bad idea to encourage players to disenchant entire decks because of one nerf.
---
A better idea would be to have some event that gives a ton of gold/dust immediately after nerfs so that all players get a boost on trying to get more cards/dust to be able to craft new meta decks faster. 
---
Strong work
---
Well to be fair I only spent money for midrange shaman but yeah I totally get your point.
---
Thanks for choosing to share my Wartbringer OTK! It was a great surprise to see one of my least viewed combos get some attention out of the blue :)

Hey IvorySpeid, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
You don't really have to buy anything to achieve that. You get nearly two dozen packs for climbing the beginner ranks (50 through 25) and you can use the gold your earn doing that to buy individual packs of each expansion until you get the legendary that's guaranteed within the first ten packs of each set. There's also a free legendary death knight in the Frozen Throne solo content and you should get a free Rastakhan legendary.
---
But if you're interested in spending cash to speed up the process, the Welcome Bundle and the New Year Bundle will guarantee several legendaries on a fresh account.
---
I took odd druid to legend from rank 5 playing nothing else a few seasons back
---
The nerf to nourish has rogered it though
---
Lots of decks are viable, they are just not played because people mostly braindead netdeck
---
If you can point me to another current meta deck that uses Hagatha, Kalimos, and Al'Akir, be my guest. 
---
Players have been clamoring for more frequent nerfs for years. 
---
NA, trading 80g you go first please

Gold#1441
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
"This turn" means the turn it is summoned. This should be clarified.
---
Sure, this is a possibility, but Shaman has no other decent decks to turn to that could rise in performance. Barring drastic innovation in a class that sees very little play as it is, we're looking at two and a half months with no good Shaman decks in Standard.

Control/ressurect big beast priest

This is 100% a viable deck.. i ladder with it and had it to rank 2 season before last.. play it like a control deck with huge bwonsamdi swings.. gallery is integral for rushing in beasts to make 1 mana copies

I haven't seen whatever you're talking about, but are you sure those are discounted cards, and not just the unnerfed versions?
---
The 'Hall of Champions' brawl, which I have seen, directly accessed the older card files rather than modifying the current ones.
---
Controlwarrior should also work quite well
---
Uh. I didn’t find it hard at all to do as Shaman (I had win as a shaman that day).
---
Use freezes to stall your opponent’s one attacker.
---
Keep a windfury or two in your hand for when you have half their life.
---
Keep rockbiter on hand for that turn for an extra 6. 
---
Hope you can do it before the priest has 10 mana and can take your guy. Even if that happens, he still can’t use him that turn so keep freezing.
---
I’d post my deck but honestly it’s probably not even super efficient because I’m a totally free to play player and don’t have a ton of amazing cards.
---
&gt;Hopefully, we see a focus back on skill based, decision oriented game play. If not, its uninstall as opposed to preorder.  
---
Yeah I'd like to see that too.  There is such a massive dive in skill levels across the game right now it's fairly frustrating.  So many decks play themselves and when you do want to pilot a deck that requires a little more thought and planning you often hit the wall of the more mindless of the autplay otk/combo decks.  
---
I'd like to see some more true control decks come back (you know, control the board as in actually get a presence on it to win with, not just clear, clear, clear play I win card(s)).
---
There is almost nothing left in that area.    
---
I imagine many players may struggle after rotation without the get out of jail free cards of Guldan, Jaina and Rexxar.  Unfortunately Mechathun stays as well as what I imagine will become one of the more hated cards in Shiravallah.  Another really big bonus is recruit is pretty much gone which is great as that means far less cheating out minions.  
---
Cube goes as does a lot of control cards (there is just too much control cards right now).
---
Things look good but then odd/even remains so we could very well end up with a very aggro meta for quite some time. Which is better than what we have now at least.
---
OTK are not a problem if they suck ass.
---
Blizzard tried it's best to keep Quest Mage at bay and it succeeded.
---
The problem is when they intentionally make a OTK deck good like some Mecha'Thun decks and OTK Paladin. That is a a problem.
---
my refresh rate is 60 but it was locked at 30 and staggering hard.
---
I don't play clone no, I don't want to craft the Lyra cause of rotation.
---
Meta decks that I think are harder to pilot than clone priest? Off the top of my head...Even pala, Control priest, mechalock, maybe like holy wrath pala etc. I find the more choices a deck has turn to turn, generally the more difficult it is to pilot.
---
Having said that I haven't played clone priest so maybe I'm wrong but from watching it played at HCT/on streams most turns look fairly straightforward in terms of decision making to me.
---
Also the difficulty of piloting any deck can vastly change from matchup to matchup. Clone priest is no different nor are any of the decks I listed. My only point being labeling any deck as THE hardest deck to pilot doesn't really work imo.
---
Recruit into 5/4
---
Pyro (8 mana left)
---
Consecration (4 mana, 13 health left, clears his board and pops tirion's bubble)
---
Tirion goes face (7 health)
---
Equality killing pyro and tirion (2 mana, get 5 atk weapon)
---
Hit face with weapon (2 health)
---
Bluegill face (0 mana, 0 health)
---
This is just from looking at it, but I think those interactions work as I'm thinking and give lethal.
---
I have been around just long enough to remember people crying out for Control to be viable. This was just before Frozen Throne and the DK debacle. 
---
I loved DK's at first. I still have Hunter and Priest to this day. But Rexxar is problematic. Infinite resources are bad in any game. And Mage can very nearly get there, too, though it has to work for it a bit more. 
---
I wont miss this Meta. More Aggro, and games that dont require 20 minutes, would be nice. Heck, maybe we could even get a Hero card that grants Warrior a useful hero power for something other than seeing how long you can make a game last, and to what degree you can bore the crap out of opponents. 
---
Yeah... Until a good removal for pala, I lost my deck. And it was wild, so also I had ragnaros lord of light, and other awesome cards, epic and legendarys.  I lost a lot of time making that deck. Is really sad cause blizzard really don't care and nerf the most cheap crap. I think i'm not going to play anymore, for a long time.
---
Yeah, its pretty much bs. We had legendaries being nerfes left and right.
