He’s getting down voted because he said to play hunter
---
Hunter is currents very dominant all over and has a lot of hate right now
---
seems great, until you play when it first starts and your deck is full of unplayable stuff
---
Ahhhhhh. Taverns of Time cards. I never even considered those.
---

---
Yes, great examples of cards that affect your deck in a more localised sense. 
---
And I agree that more deck-interacting mechanics that are more controlled random than *anywhere* (Void Contract, Fal'dorei Strider, Seaforium Bomber being examples of pure randomness and general deck influence) is a fantastic place to explore in Hearthstone. 
---
I agree that a rock-paper-scissors meta isn't healthy for the game, and it's funny how many people parrot the same line about "aggro keeps combo in check, combo keeps control from getting too greedy" while at the same time complaining that rock-paper-scissors is boring. 
---
The fact is there is one and only one archetype matchup in which the potential for *both* players to have fun exists, and that is control vs control. Aggro vs combo/control: whoever gets better draw RNG and wins is going to have more fun. Combo vs control: the combo deck gets to play solitaire for 20 turns and get a free win. Control vs control: every turn of the game is interactive, important, and depends significantly less on draw RNG with the exception of death knights, which the devs have basically admitted were a mistake and are rotating anyway. 
---
People here do not critically engage with this discussion, instead regurgitating the same shit about "aggro keeping the meta healthy". They forget how the community basically unanimously loved the meta during UnGoro, which was probably the most control-heavy in the game's history. 
---
LUL cause what else am I supposes to do with class:druid dot deck :(
---
I played a game against one of these decks with exodia paladin the other day.  "75 armor? don't care"
---
Which server? 
---
Then two more questions arise: how "pseudo" is the random, and is there an approach that is less "pseudo" random? If the answer to the latter question is no," it seems like a moot point anyhow. It's as random as it gets, even if it's not perfectly random, which makes it as balanced as it gets.
---
If there is a more random way of doing it, then what is it?
---
Leaving aside that having such a powerful all-around card as lich king in the classic set would be horrible....
---
They wouldn't even consider it due to the expansion literally revolving around him.

Thanks! I’ll take a look.
---
It seems like a lot of the players you noted are making big mistakes. Maybe they are practicing to learn how to use the deck properly before heading to ranked so that they don't lose rank? Good thing there's a place where anyone can play any deck to practice and play against a real opponent without wins and losses being a huge deal.
---
Thank you for the compliment! 
---
&gt; OTKs are fine as part of the meta but if you don't give players the tools to deal with them it just becomes boring and frustrating. 
---
Well put. I can agree that they are, in fact, fine to play against, but as long as you have the tools to deal with it. Thinking about this, it makes me think that OTK variant decks are almost outside of the "rock paper scissors" meta. Because in the cycle of R-P-S, there actually isn't much to deal with OTK, unlike how you can easily counter aggro, midrange, or control. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Unless you roll odd shaman 
---
Wow. Didnt know Overkill worked with heroes. Guess its somewhat relevant for this.
---
Yeah it was meant as a satire... some of them make good plays and others don't but it was meant as a dig at them playing net decks in casual mode and hence not being able to handle ranked.  I have also faced some net deckers who make optimal plays.  They also should go play ranked!
---
So... like half the regular brawls?
---
I am not paying less, every euro is worth a certain amount of dollars EUR/USD rate is 1.14. The expenses are just not as painful to me as for people living in poorer countries. A dollar or euro is always worth a dollar or a euro. 
---
In terms of what I could buy instead of spending it on packs nothing really changes. And I surely wouldn’t be playing this game if I was living on €50 every month, I would be looking for a job. To be fair it sounds like a wild exaggeration to me, the only countries where it is normal to live on €3 a day are third-world countries. 
---
Blizzard charges $49.99 for 40 packs in the US, which has about the same cost of living as rich EU countries, we should therefore be paying $43 for 40 packs. Instead we pay €50 for 40 packs which is $57. Not a huge difference but it still means that Europe is paying the most compared to other *currencies*.  
---
Great concept! I love the idea of an evolving brawl, it will keep players coming back throughout the week instead of winning on wednesday and peacing out. Implementation is just details that I'm sure blizz has the data to work out.
---
Who do you think gets gutted the worse upon rotation... priest or hunter?  
---
Seems each lose an archetype (Deathrattle Hunter and Res Priest).
---
Man they really should have changed Dr. Boom #3 to make the animation bullshit go faster. Every time I tried and failed I had to wait 5 minutes for all the overdraws to process. So obnoxious.
---
Not every basic variant of every class can be viable all at the same time. Aggressive Warrior decks haven't been popular since the change to Fiery War Ax and Patches, Aggressive Priest decks have never really existed, control Shaman pretty much doesn't exist, Midrange decks haven't really existed in Mage, to some extent Priest, Warlock before Genn Graymane, and more or less Rogue, and so on.
---
As for slower Rogue decks, most of them end up being combo oriented at this moment, Malygos/ Deathrattle Rogue would be a current example and the design philosophy in Hearthstone is that aggressive decks beat combo, control beats aggro, and combo beats control. 
---
A full on control Rogue as seen during the Legaue of Explorers format three years ago now I believe won't come around again as long as great neutral defensive and healing options like Sludge Belcher and Antique Healbot are no longer being printed. 
---
Thematically, playing the long game won't be something Rogue will be able to do well. It's just not
---
Boy oh boy I cannot wait for that Spellstone to go bye-bye.

/u/unidan is that you?

Which boar? Serious question
---
What is the relation to HS though when we don't really know how a "shuffle" might work do we?  
---
I.e. is it shuffled at game commencement and remains that way or is it rng at each card draw? If it's a set order after an initial shuffle what happens when cards are pushed to deck? Are they inserted into this order randomly or does the deck get a whole new shuffle?  
---
Seems to me you've highlighted players misplaying their deck and are using casual to refine and learn their deck.  
---
Why would they use ranked where they could tumble down ranks whilst learning? That is just silly.  
---
If you don't like facing net decks in casual too bad, it's a game and if people would like to use those decks in casual then so be it.  
---
Do you know how broken patches is ?
---
It actually gives cthun as an option quite often.  On the flip side, I'm not even sure if omega assemy gives it I've seen it so little.  
---
&gt; was trying to put some satire up to make people laugh.
---
Reads to me that you are pissed off with netdecks in casual, wanted to complain about it but didn't want to sound like a complete asshole so added the whole "misplay satire" part to it which in the end just justifies why people SHOULD play those decks in casual.
---
Well direraven and I are friends now. Lol!

---
The reason that I put in mind blast is that one of the main reasons a card gets put in the HoF is if it limits design space for other cards. 
---
And like you said, mind blast is only an issue when you can get 4 of them or you can cheat minions that make it deal 20+ damage. Having it in standard limits blizzard's ability to print cards that would let you get duplicate spells or cheaply increase its effectiveness. 
---
I do agree that the card is the whole point of the KotFT. But the Lich King is a major character in the universe. Similar to Deathwing, Illidan.
---
The power level of the card though I don’t agree. Isn’t Ysera the same? 
---
Dude can you tell us the same shit but it costs real money?
---
I’m not 100% sure on the Asia one, I think it’s right, but the NA and EU ones are definitely right 
---
As the comment below suggested, zilliax is a good addition but I assume you dont have it, so my other advice would be to replace the cheap shot with something that gives better early game tempo like si7 agent maybe?
---
gadgetzan auctioneer - it surves a specific purpose and sees plays every now and then in a lot of decks that want to cycle cheap spells.
---
Congratulations, You played yourself.
---
But Boar is a basic card, so they'll just give it Rush or something
---
Me but with almost all of the classic set Warrior epics (Shield Slam and friends) and most of the classic set Giants (never opened Molten or Sea Giant.  At least I got to craft two golden Moltens when it got HoF’d).
---
I’ve just accepted that I’m probably never building a Warrior deck any time soon.
---
She's also a girl according to her voice

Congratulations! The closest I've been to this misfortune was when I failed at the last match with a totem 5 times in a row. It was vexing. I can barely imagine your frustration through this ordeal. So, congrats!

Yep. Took 2 more turns. I got a few more discards and was able to play a Jeklik each turn while he ran out of cards in hand so he just conceded.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
Yeah but I chalk that up to Dungeon Run being amazing more than Rumble Run sucking. I've actually been enjoying Rumble Run a lot recently, not sure if it's because of the patch or just experience.
---
Doesn't even need to be a transform card, a simple silence will do.
---
Did the tournament mode they mentioned in the Year of the Raven ever meet that beta?

Good point!

I have no clue. And has it really been 10 years since HS released? I played it occasionally during the first year and only recently came back to it a few months ago.
---
Thing I don't like about mind blast is you're either OTKing by combining it with other cards, or it's useless.

Sorry, I’m not sure you understood the theory. But others did – you can read their post.

If you compare average game time and average rounds played on hsreplay, mechathun druid isn't slow at all.
---
The deck is fun because you have very limited resources to deal with your opponents board and are reliant to have 1-2 very strong auctioneer turns. You then have to manage your draw, play your minions early enough, don't keep earthen scales until the end etc. There are a lot of things you can screw up with this deck, that makes it interesting to play. The skill cap on this deck is also wayyy higher than your traditional curvestone decks.
---
Most hearthstone decks are just played on curve and go for board control. How is that interesting or fun? 
---
Cheating is cheating regardless of who did it and whether or not they accept responsibility, they shouldn't be allowed to participate in something that requires integrity (Hearthstone or not). It is human nature, that change in behavior is hard, if he cheats now he will cheat again. Cheating is a form of lying and that means we don't even know if what he says about the situation is true. But we have proof he cheated, that should be punished. He didn't even plan to tell the admins about what he asked Frozen during the tournament, he would of just covered it up if he didn't make that the mistake of sending the message. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but I hate people who break obvious ethics especially honestly and integrity.
---
Well, the next time it happens, make a deck with whatever garbage you have lying around for the class, go into Wild Casual and do NOT under any circumstances attack your opponent's face. Kill off your own minions when necessary. There's a 50-50 chance they'll realise what you're doing and let you play out your deck, and if they don't, you just do it again.
---
And for Rogue, use bounce cards. At stupid times, it'll also help signal to your opponent. Those bounces also help if you get the Play 100 Murloc quest.
---
r/substhatshouldexist
---
I can't tell if his shrine will awaken, but if it does you lose. Plus you have no answer to majordomo and the rag as you only have 8 damage on board and 3 burst in hand, leaving you 4 damage short of KO-ing the rag for the win 
---
I would avoid opening the older three packs - Kobolds, Frozen Throne and Un'Goro as cards from these decks will rotate out of standard in a few months.
---
Too bad overkill completely flopped as a mechanic.
---
Pretty much the entire resurrection package is rotating (Shadow Essence, Spellstone, Eternal Servitude). If they don’t get it off on the Cloning Gallery turn, which requires insanely good luck, then the OTK is borked
---
Also Priest as a whole is losing Lyra, which was the decks main value generator to complete spellstones, and Psychic Stream is leaving, which means the only real board clear is Mass Hysteria.
---
Basically, the deck is fundamentally fucked

Why not? Combos and synergies have gone undiscovered for months into the meta before.

Good job! Are you old guardian on youtube? I watch your videos quite often, did an awesome job specifiying the decks!

No
---
I miss the neutral package meta... Board based games in HS are my favorite, not secrets and otk from hand. 
---
Suppose it comes down to the rarity and uniqueness of your username. If you're called Bob probably much more likely that x_xSmexxiLexxix_x
---
so your druid opponent has emptied his entire deck, played &amp; killed hakkar, and still has both naturalizes, and your haven't been threatening to kill him?
---
my point is you force him to skip hakkar (though i guess i could've been clearer about that)
---
in which case, hakkar druid only has 21 points of damage, and a useless hakkar in-hand. i get that odd-warrior esc decks aren't able to do this, but even other OTK decks (namely pally) can just put on enough board pressure to make hakkar suicide.
---
Level up came out in KnC too though 
---
Oh boy was it a bad deck. I was also a noob at the time, but even I knew 5 UI was a bad idea but I decided to just go all in. I think I got two wins with it
---
You can also watch the classic Uther vs Uther if you hav'nt already.
---
The fact this dude spelled the words correctly and punctuated his comment puts it in the top 10% of best r/Hearthstone comments of all time.
---
I’m aware that plenty of decks utilize odd or even but I was saying none of them feel like odd Paladin. 
---
Even after the changes odd Paladin feels disgusting to fight. Even when I win. It’s worse than turn 6 rexxar who then pulls a life steal charge poisonous minion every turn lol 
---
But Level Up was already top meta in K&amp;C with Dudeladin (well maybe just top Tier 2, but still a very solid deck and mostly because of that card).
---
It was all over the place before rastakhan. Turn three hench clan thug flashbacks.

---
How often you gonna repost this now?? 
---
Why do you think it’s bad design? I really think it’s cool and fun for the most part. You get a special hero power but you have to sacrifice things, big things.
---
Odd mage has to give up blizzard and polymorph. Even shaman has to give up volcano and lightning storm  (I don’t play the other classes so I don’t know what they give up lol) 
---
But I like the idea of building decks around a strict rule. Like my first deck was Murloc shaman and my second deck was elemental mage. Which was just all elementals removal and jaina lol but the theme was fun for me. Not the same thing but it’s similar in a way. Kind of lmao 
---
Cool, now you have time for other games.

This! Whenever someone ropes me starting turn 1, I just put on an episode of family guy or something. Then when it's my turn I play my cards and the let the rope burn while watching something. Most of the times they stop after a couple of turns or just outright concede.

How?

And Level Up coincidentally was not played in that list.

A challenge in this concept is that the decks that win are really good in a certain metagame. (Which changes every :round")
---
But i would still love this idea :). With a little more polished rules and some suggestion from this comment section tgis could be epic! 
---
(Also the 1 loss= deck is out thing is not a problem if you see it as an event. It doesn't have to be perfect ourcome, just awesome. (Also there are many possible builds for most decks. Extremely refined decks that need every card will be more unlikely to make it through. )

My main problem is the insane amount of possible card combinations, so they likely need to install some limiting rules for these seeds.

Sure the hero power is good, but missing out on hellfire, defile, 4 mana 7/7, sac pac, demonic project, nether, bloodreaver guldan, rin, gnomeferatu, many other good even warlock cards, definitely not worth it. The only good board clear is Godfrey, and a warlock is going to need more than that to survive an odd rogue
---
Level Up saw play in post nerf KnC iirc, Dude Paladin was a legit deck (CtA was super busted).
---
You have valid points and I also play Wild on occasion. I'm just trying to see it from the perspective of someone brand new. He wants to play the mode most people are playing. He wants to open packs and build decks from those (A lot of Wild card packs have to be bought outside the game, this puts people off from it)
---
His game knowledge is limited and its a lot easier keeping track of Standard cards and meta then the wild.
---
Well, I'm guessing this is how a new person would think.
---
Yeah it would of been great as a tri-class. Baku, Genn and a Highlander based legendary would have been great for an expansion
---
Not quite as good, they nerfed summoner to 7 as well and honestly I haven't really seen the deck since.
---
Gamepedia's HS wiki is not an official page my dude
---
At a 51% winrate you need to play 100 games to win 2 stars. A 70% control warlock will gain 2 stars every 5 games, roughly. So the warlock would climb much faster.
---
Obviously if you're below rank 5, that changes things because of the winstreak bonus.
---
Very true, but then even warlock smashes odd rogue, the card doesn't work for every class, but then even mage wouldn't really work either as you lose soo much 
---
I think it just means cards which have the word "Raven" in their name
---
Hmm the "download quotes" feature doesn't seem to work, I type "s" and it asks which minion quote I want then after that it just creates empty folders by the same name as the minion I was looking for. am I doing something wrong ? 
---
Explanation is in my initial comment. TL;DR - the Overkill effect can still trigger and kill you in fatigue damage, even if your opponent is dead. Beware!
---
this post didn't quite hit the mark
---
Exactly, thats the main reason why baku is problematic, not all classes can utilize them equally.
---
Dammit! my secret is out. Proceed downvoting to make sure this will never get on hot
---
Dude I loved the Corridor Creeper meta.
---
Tho at the time I was new to the game and playing Midrange Hunter at around rank 7, so idk.
---
Dude Pally was a legit deck in post nerf KnC.
---
Yes
---
At this point if you are not running cards that can deal with the hunter spellstone, you're asking for it. Priest is good right now and I run 5 cards that counters it, and my win rate vs hunter is amazing.
---
I think Bloodlust would be a bigger issue.
---
Nah not really... I don't get mad at HS (not that I haven't in the past!!) just switch to Netflix if I don't wanna play.  Thought people would get more of a kick out of my post but apparently not.  Oh well.
---
A good point. But Malchezzar is a random effect, the others are consistent. Plus he's wild now.
---
Murlocs.
---
OK I see your point. Even I am still confused in the wild meta game because there is conflicting and unclear data from the lower player count. Making tapping into the meta harder. And most streamers play standard making it easier to learn from. Standard does actually seem a lot more new player friendly 
---
Shirvalla is a she
---
What app did you use to record on iOS?
---
The problem is drawing cards while in fatigue. I've tried my own list and fatigue damage killed me before I could do the combo 
---
At the end, opponent thanked you for ending his sufferings

Tbh priest is my favorite class and it was the first one i did and finished in this run
---
Let me knw if you need some advice! 
---
&gt;The last meta before Rastakhan saw every class pushing two or three viable decks easily to rank 10, most pushing to 5.
---
I don't even how to respond to this. This just isn't not how you measure balance.
---
Genn and Baku were really pushed by Blizzard because they wanted their theme to see play. They ultimately ended up having to nerf cards because of this. This does warrant some critique.
---
they can just change the hero power upgrade? Make it summon 1 2/2 dude or a 1/1 with Rush/Charge/Taunt/Windfury/Lifesteal randomized

took me longer then i'd like to admit to figure it out

---
Yeah but a lot of the heropower synergy cards can still be played after the DK, like the ragnaros card.
---
DK will rotate in the spring though. 
---
Sure. It is like many things a matter of taste.
---
But this topic here ("Lets take a moment to appreciate the amazing art of hs") implies that this is a diskussion about quality and hs-art is no good quality in comparison even if it completely does fit your taste (and this of many other hs players).
---
You are not guaranteed to draw Malchezaar's cards though. You could go a few games without ever getting to play them. It's also arguable whether it's a reward - random legendaries are on average worse than your deck, so they dilute your deck and make your draws worse. 
---
Except Warriors and Priests.
---
&gt; he is still right tho. Level Up is overcosted at 5 (and now 6). If you compare it with the 4 mana dinosaur and the 5 mana dude in wild which buff the dudes
---
I mean, even before odd paladin existed, Quartermaster was a really, really strong card as a 2/5 that gave silver hand recruits +2/+2 (but not taunt).  I think it's fine that level up is not as good as quartermaster.
---
Like...sure, I can see the argument that if they wanted to make Level Up as good as Quartermaster, they would have made it a battlecry on a 2/2 body or something.  Two things though:
---
1. Quartermaster is super OP, so they probably didn't want to make Level Up that strong.
---
2. That would be basically better than fungalmancer if you have a board with two silver hand recruits.  And fungalmancer on two silver hand recruits is already a play I tend to be fairly happy to make.
---
Like...here's a tempostorm snapshot deck in Standard pre-witchwood that was rated tier 1 by tempostorm and which used a 1-of copy of Level Up:
---
https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/decks/dude-paladin-standard-meta-snapshot-feb-28-2018
---
So no, it's not just the Odd Paladin hero power, level up was good enough to squeeze into a tier 1 meta deck pre-Witchwood in standard with the 5-mana cost.
---
5 mana was honestly probably the right cost since it was already seeing play at 5.  4 would be EXTREMELY pushed (having two silver hand recruits makes it better than Blessing of Kings, and it would be a problem in Wild forever with the curve of turn 3 Muster into turn 4 Level Up).  3 mana...no, fuck off.  Savage Roar but the buff is permanent and it also buffs health?  No.  Just no.  Anyone suggesting 3 mana clearly hasn't put very much thought into this.
---
Sadly some lessons are learned the hard way.
---
You should also take the habit of checking how many card the opponent has and how many has in deck for fatigue turns or milling opportunities
---
For spell hunter, don't play recklessly. You don't NEED to go full throttle aggro. Flood the board with hero power and save one drops to reload after explosive trap/rexxar. 
---
Losing 3-4 dudes that didn't cost you any cards isn't bad when you can instantly refill the board. 
---
Lol, just to clarify, it was a painful moment for my opponent
---
What is it?
---
"You can get to rank 5 with almost any deck that you throw together." 
---
Yeah. Exactly. That's a good thing. With skill, there are any number of ways to climb. Why isn't that how to measure balance? How are you measuring it? 
---
Shutdown, I have it though...
---
Tbf, Baku wasnt even out when this screenshot was taken. It also appears to be before Patches wss even nerfed based on the context. I feel like I'm watching Fox. Just dig up something that sounds bad today, but give zero context and watch everyone get uppity.
---
What? Then how did retsamerol take this screenshot? Her deck is empty and in the history she took fatigue damage. Or am i misunderstanding your comment?
---
"Just take a moment" is the evolved "Does anyone else think"
---
What I was missing is Reddit is still showing me your old comment, lol
---
And imo, that's still a bad bot because it was wrong and you had to save face for it
---
Sounds like Sonya Shadowdancer. It's a rogue legendary. 
---
Nvm i m wrong. You cant purchase them with coins only with $$ from the Blizzard Shop. As ypu can do with Naxx and Karazhan
---
Thanks guys I am just so used to old Druid meta I forgot they had other cards. I only ever saw gloop in token Druid but I guess it’s expanding 
---
What's even more disgusting is that if you click on the link to the mmoculture article in OP's post and scroll down to the picture with the two women standing in front of the banners, you can see that the icon for the App is exactly the same as hearthstone's. It's kinda hard to see because of the lady on the right's head, but you can tell its the same weird star thing that HS has going.
---
Also I have no idea why they have QR code stickers on their arms but it freaks me out.
---
Priest was the hardest for me to clear at the time.
---
Your best shot is double deathrattle and jam as many draw/busted effects from treasures as possible.
---
I think you could also create some powerful lyra or combo decks but i would not count on those tbh.
---
Not really, i don't mind paying for stuff that i enjoy playing. Purely the game has one dimension. not enough interaction in games. pretty much you know by turn 3-4 who wins. or you get blown up by 5 mindblasts on T10 or some stupid rng ..... just not worth it IMO...
---
Hunters do pretty well vs odd rogue so odd rogue is less popular at low ranks where you are likely to see a large amount of hunters. 
---
Just stop now.
---
&gt; Why do you think it’s bad design?
---
A summary of the Rastakhan's Rumble reveal discussions:
---
"(card) is good/bad because it is/isn't odd"
---
"(card) is good/bad because it is/isn't even"
---
The odd or even value of a card was the only thing that mattered. And it was quite obvious in the design of certain cards that they  had their mana costs altered to avoid a particular synergy in Genn or Greymane. It was an awful design decision that defines and confines deckbuilding for an entire rotation.
---
So you are saying that no matter how if you can reach rank 5 then the balance is good? No matter how many games it takes in between?
---
That seems very reductive to me. It is not so difficult. Just look at representation of different decks and their winrates. If you there are many decks with about the same representation then that indicates balance if their are some with lower representation but about equal winrates then that also indicates balance.
---
Oh I see. I was unaware early edits don't leave a note about that. Thanks for explaining
---
For that is it not important that it is balanced, but making sure that playing is enjoyable.
---
Glinda Crowskin? You said it did stuff when you played other cards and Glinda’s background is similar to the picture you provided. Also, I’d recommend browsing through the Witchwood expansion to see if the card you’re looking for is there since I think it has a lot of card with a similar background. 
---
[removed]
---
Yeah that part was absurd. But the 5 mana being over-priced wasn't too absurd. 4 mana is a decent cost at the time printing the card. Personally, I think the devs did well by baking a bad card good in later expansions.
---
In that same thread it was suggested that [[Vex Crow]] is probably a raven.
---
Apparantly ravens are a subset of crow, i.e. all ravens are crows, but only some crows are ravens.
---
Whizbang I wouldn't mind but Lich King would just be Ragnaros 2.0. Basically just included in almost every deck it could fit in.

4/3/3 Beast | Whenever you cast a spell, summon a random 2-Cost minion.  
---
Thanks you! I'll start with dusting some of my old cards which I presume a no longer usable in standard. 
---
Instead of releasing trash stat-fat Legendaries (like Oondasta or Subject 9) and epics every set, they should instead take those trash Legend and Epic cards to release cards with outlandish and/or interesting deck building challenges but provide no additional support.
---
Because those cards (akin to Reno) are the ones that are actually interesting to see what the community can come up with. Magic does this with every set with cards like Experimental Frenzy and Aggressive Mining.
---
Yeah, sure, most of those cards will be so outlandish that they'll just be a dud, but at least they're fun to mess with and will reward creative players.
---
Cards like Kazakus (who'se text is, essentially "PLAY THIS WITH RENO") feel patronizing.
---
Congratulations! It is a lot of work, even for a 5 years period. I would love if they had intermediate accolades. For example: silver for 250 wins, and so on. 
---
“You know what would be good, some early board control. Let’s throw in patches with a couple pirates. Hmm might as well throw in some more pirates to add consistency.... Now corridor creeper is good with minion based decks. 
---
There you have it, Thief Priest! now better with pirate package
---
The game really lacks nuance. I was glad to read through this thread and see it talked about a bit. The last big CCG i was into was Legend of the Five rings which is on the other side of the spectrum as far as nuance. I get that a game that is played on mobile may not be able to have all of that, but it is obvious they only want people to net deck.
---
There are three high tier odd decks out of nine classes and odd mage is pretty close if it isn't. Odd druid is also an easy legend deck if you want it to be.
---
Usernames.
---
Cool
---
My brain am stupid.
---
&gt; if someone still wanted to have that challenge they could either not purchase or aim for a golden collection instead.
---
Unfortunately that doesn't work if other players have a path to easily get full collections. At that point, the reality of the meta would force you to do the economically and competitively sensible thing which is to also get the full collection, thus effectively eliminating collecting as anything but a very quixotic choice. Indeed, if full collections were an option, it's doubtful that Blizzard would even bother selling packs since there would be no incentive for people to buy them.
---
As to your final paragraph, you do have choices. You can play a game that emphasizes collecting, like HS, or you can choose to play a game that uses an alternative system. My only point is that the collectible aspect of a game like HS isn't just incidental to the game or a product of greedy marketing; it's part of the genre which provides an experience that is meaningful to a lot of players. 
---
I love big markets. I love choices. If you want to encourage developers to create card games where collecting isn't an element then, please, go and try to drum up interest in having games like that. But let's not try and make every game like that. HS is what it is and what that is includes the concept of building and curating collections as a core part of the experience. We don't, in my very strongly held opinion, need to mess around with that. 
---
The vast majority of card games are not like that.
---
Of all the card games I've played (and I've played almost literally every single other one) the only games that do cards whose text is essentially: "PLAY THIS CARD WITH CARD X!" is Hearthstone and YuGiOh. Every other card game does this WAAAAY less and much more occasionally.
---
In Hearthstone every deck comes all but premade from the spoilers with all the: "PLAY THIS WITH THAT!" cards.
---
There could certainly be different effects for Baku and Justicar if that was actually a concern.
---
DeepMind (the company behind AlphaZero) started with AlphaGo, which took \~40 days of playing itself to beat a top human. I believe AlphaChess took \~24 hours of playing itself to beat top computers (No human has beaten a top chess program since 2004).
---
Go/Chess are considered "perfect" games, since there is no randomness. You could potentially calculate the entire game start to finish.
---
Currently, DeepMind is teamed up with Blizzard working on training its AI to play a Starcraft 2. This is a different challenge, since there are unknowns and imperfect information.
---
The comparison to this challenge is tough, since humans may play sub-par moves, and the "best" deck may be far from it. It would definitely be interesting to have DeepMind take on Hearthstone, and let its AI go so far as to create its own decks. I have a gut feeling they'd be far from our current meta.
---
I think that's a super good distribution too. Rogue, shaman, and pally all have valuable even cost spells that are typically played in all non odd decks. Their powers at 1 are strong but not oppressive (even shaman though cough cough). On the flip side, the odd classes have the exact opposite - powerful hero powers when upgraded that all feel lackluster at 1. Consistently powerful odd spells (except maybe druid). The last classes were the 3 that built Reno decks in the past, so why not make them again? Wild is already a shitshow. 
---
Bottled terror, 2 parrot mascots, and 31 pogo hoppers
---
"Odd warrior is so good it prevents an agro meta"
---
"Odd rogue is the best deck at legend rank"
---
What?
---
Never play against with over 10 attack against Warrior when he's running out of cards.
---
I'm EU! Still looking ') 
---
The salt is delicious. And since you made a throwaway for this, I'm going to assume you know why emotes aren't going away, but still wanted to baby rage on the sub. It's okay, we all win some and lose some.
---
Even paladin is strong.
---
Probably not.
---
Decks built with restrictions are weakest when the card pool is at its smallest. While people are predicting an Odd and Even apocalypse on the dawn of the rotation, it probably isn't going to happen unless April's set very specifically fills the hole in every Odd and Even deck the rotation will be creating in each of them. 
---
At the very least, Odd Mage, Even Paladin, Even Shaman, and Even Warlock should no longer be viable, so an off-meta Odd deck really doesn't have a chance.

4/3/4 Demon | Deathrattle: Put a random Demon from your hand into the battlefield.  
---
looks like me in real life
---
Honestly, odd mage is ok too.  Second tier.
---
But that’s part of the problem. Genn and Baku’s abilities have both turned up before, but they were locked behind cards you had to dig through your deck to find and, in some cases, deck restrictions. And were balanced against that cost. 
---
As it turns out, upgraded powers designed to be unlocked by playing a 6 drop are overwhelmingly powerful when they are automatically available at the start of the game. Even with severe card restrictions, because the hero power naturally fills in the gap. 
---
Not exactly, the Mountain Giants are the perfect start of course, yet they are very slow and weak against cards like Righteous Protector. Therefore, swapping Guldan to look for something like defile makes more sense.
---
Still the first time I got this hand in over far more than 100 evenlock games!
---
This is an absolutely phenomenal idea that would be a TON of fun and would create some really fun insights into the game.

The standard required for making this statement is to provide data from at least 100 consecutive games at rank 4 or higher.

Wild mill rogue
---
My memory could be playing tricks on me but im almost certain we hear it voiced in the Rogue Class Hall Campaign and that its pronounced like the bird. There is also a chance its voiced in the cata legendary dagger quest line but ive never personally done that one.
---
Cause they aren’t minions. Jaraxxus is a minion that becomes your hero. Those two are always heroes 
---
Editors note
---
AAECAZ8FBJ74AvEFpwWvBA3W5QLR4QL70wKVzgLjywK4xwKDxwLrwgKbwgL5 CvUF8ANGAA== here is a sample odd pali list that hit legend, there are other builds with cauldron so its up to your pref. 
---
Shaku, Cutpurse, Bladed Cultist? 
---
It's not like they recently made that interaction a thing, when he started getting worse
---
Sorry, I didn't realize he said it isn't this card, my bad 
---
But heros don’t have tribal tags. Minions do. That’s my understanding of why it works this way at least. 
---
&gt;ut those matches would be against other unplayable decks
---
Which would be extremely unenjoyable. Regular "random" brawls have restrictions to their decks, ensuring a decent curve and enough card quality. Purely random decks would be way, way worse
---
From wandering monster. Being a 3 drop is actually his only use.
---
I've played a few games with the deck in casual and at rank 5 and I think I have some ideas for imporovement. 
---
Valeera is a low tempo high value card. I think you can safely cut it for some more early game. 
---
1 walk the plank is enough I think. Sub in some more early game. SI:7 can work well.  
---
Like someone else said I think Farseer is a low impact card. Sub in an aggressive 3 drop like Thug, SI:7 or Blink Fox.  
---
Vanish, Prep, Backstab, Evasion, Eviscarate, Sap, Zilliax, Auctioneer and Minstrel are all pulling their weight. Wouldn't remove any of them. Fan of Knives is good against Paladin, mediocre against the rest. Good as a draw engine though. Same goes for Shiv. Maybe it's worth getting better cards for them, I haven't found any yet.  
---
The deck does really well against control and other Mecha'thun decks. But loses to aggro hard.  That alone will put it in Tier 3 or 4 at best. I'll be trying the Rogue Spellstones after this. Maybe that will work. 
---
Great deck idea, not top tier, but fun for at least a while.
---
While we’re on the subject of wonky interactions a lot of people apparently don’t know, it’s worth noting that unlike the modern hero cards, Jaraxxus (and Ragnaros from Majordomo Executus) also set your armor to 0. So when you get one off your Sindragosa from Dragons Roar and think “oh 15 health isn’t so bad with this 20 armor”, *don’t*. 
---
Actually not that bad vs priest.  They have only a few ways to deal with 4 attack minions, and after the first Milhouse, they should be out of spells.  You might have to deal with a 28/28 Northshire Cleric, but hopefully you won't.
---
Can I see a decklist?
---
Cress#1717 NA. 80g quest. Have traded a lot before, have a history you can check. Would prefer you go first :)
---
I was looking for the programming joke, thank you sir
---
I don't think they gave him a tribe, but if they did it would probably be mech like the new C'Thun.
---
Played league of legends long time ago. Friends name was Falcon932 a guy on enemy team was Falcon239
---
If only the mana cost added up.....
---
Odd Mage wants to be aggresive deck though. Jaina is great if you plan to grind through all your deck, but what you really want to do is to use HP as efficient removal, thus generating early tempo and leaving minions to go face and close before turn 9.
---
or just craft Rexxar and you're good to go with pretty much every Hunter archtype out there
---
Did it work? In the brawl I just played my opponent dropped a Skulking Geist and to both our surprise it didn’t do anything at all. 
---
I personally never complained about that meta as it made it much cheaper to build decks which I find important as a person that does not buy card packs outside pre-orders. 
---
A card that forces high cost cards? Like some sort of **High**lander?
---
The main thing you mentioned as a problem with the card is that it gives you 15/20 of guaranteed stats. You mentioned your concern that it would dominate even more after rotation. So obviously people are going to comment on the fact that it won't build a board like that anymore when rotation happens.
---
And it's very important to keep in mind other cards when evaluating the powerlevel of a card.
---
I feel they made this hero card in the way hero cards shouldn't be. IMO a hero card should work as a means to upgrade the late game, and to survive during it. Not as a finisher. So far they had done it well, mechanics were more centered in hero power and a battlecry that worked in the long term. I agree 100%
---
i agree on the points, but it also make the game more complexe for crustructed games. Otherwise if we suppress  all what you are quoting we have just arena looking decks where we select the best arena cards. 
---
But i think that YES i would prefer hearthstone if we follow all yours edvice (except n°2 which is really fine imo)
---
Hidden interaction since lore wise hes a demon
---
Deadly shot, twisting nether
---
This is one of the reasons hearthstone has such a tight grasp on the CCG market as well, IMO. No other game has such a smooth and silky *feel* to it.
---
&gt; See this is the problem with this community. Stop looking at the card within the context of other cards, look at the core design.
---
Uh.
---
The core design matters based off of the context of other cards. Many "broken" designs can be "unbroken" by just not having a card to be broken with. Like how Warsong Commander was broken-but-no-one-cared-much until Grim Patron made it into the game. Prior to that, it was broken only when it gave *any* minion charge and that worked with even Molten Giant.
---
This isn't a problem with a community. The problem is on your end.
---
&gt; Yeah yeah the Spellstone rotates out, so? What about Baited Arrow, what about literally any card that could be printed in the future?
---
Right, so you're looking at it in the context of other cards?
---
And you're acting like Zul'jin is problematic based off of... hypothetical cards we know nothing about yet?
---
Bold strategy.
---
Run
---
Lol
---
I dont know about you but I definitely think the oppressive nat pagle needs to be removed from the game
---
The merciless dead man's hand warrior, plague of tier 0
---
Touché 
---
I just have one advice for them: Dont listen to reddit.
---
5% win rate.  I'll pass
---
Problematic.
---
It does have the highest attack of any minion in the pick, I guess, at 2 + up to 3.
---
&gt; other than Evenlock which loses too much
---
Err...what?  It doesn’t lose Mountain Giant or Twilight Drake, and the other 26 cards don’t matter cause it mostly wins by playing Giant on turn 3/4.
---
(Ok fine, losing spellstone is a big deal.  Nothing else is all that big though, including Gul’Dan which doesn’t tend to summon very many demons anyway—upgrading the hero power is good obviously, but the deck probably benefits from other decks not having hero cards more than it loses from the loss of its own hero card).
---
Looking at a typical build on HSReplay I see 14 cards that aren’t rotating, and a bunch more that could be added like Doomsayer, Shadow Flame, Siphon Soul, Twisting Nether.  Might be worth trying out Omega Defender.  It’s losing some early speed bumps like Vulgar Homunculus, so something like Belligerent Gnome.  Not sure what to replace Plated Beetle with, but a second Acidic Swamp Ooze is probably fine.  High Priestess Jeklik seems fine even with no discard synergy.  A replacement for Shroom Brewer could be good; Derranged Doctor or Lifedrinker sound fine.  This list doesn’t have demonic project or sac pact; might be worth adding.
---
Pretty sure it’s going to get back to 30 cards no problem.
---
So many cards over the years with amazing effects. My favorite right now is Jan’alai, The Dragonhawk. It has a cool animation on its own, and well, it summons good old Ragnaros, which has one of the best animations ever made in the game. 
---
I’m playing Secret Odd Mage, just to get to that point where I can use it. Even if you end up loosing, it’s just satisfying to watch.
---
I have never related more with a post than I do with this one. :(
---
It’s honestly hard for me to evaluate which class is losing the *least*. Each one is losing an insane amount of powerful and core cards. Year of the Mammoth was just on a whole other level. Excited for the rotation!
---
Oh my.
---
What device were you playing on?
---
If those odds are correct, then the premise that the average is 70 from higher up in the thread is wrong.
---
You bm'd recording it on your phone you muppet
---
Are you daft?
---
Deathstalker Rexxar became much more oppressive with the introduction of certain beasts. Why wouldn’t the same thing happen with Zul’jin? 
---
To mention future potential cards being problematic isn’t looking at the context of the cards per say, it’s to illustrate the point that given *any* context the card is dangerously powerful. Which is to say, the card is designed poorly.  They have to tiptoe around printing any Hunter Spell that generates minions for the next year.
---
Plus it's inconsistent because there's a murloc hero but it can't be destroyed by hungry crab.
---
It is pretty much a worse Mad Scientist, which should indicate just how nuts of a card Mad Scientist was.
---
OP just needs to pray for magma ragers for true synergy.
---
I believe he does! Or at least I hope he does, because they all look fantastic.
---
Prince Liam affects 1-cost cards, including spells and minions, but Geist only affects 1-cost spells.
---
That and capping your health at 15 is pretty terrible with all the OTK decks out there.
---
YES
---
When you have rank 1 and 5 stars, win
---
Wait, this actually works??? I always assumed otherwise but it makes sense
---
Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the number of free card given out total. As someone who plays a lot of FTP games, I think Hearthstone is very generous. I just enjoyed it more when a few cards were saved out as incentive for beating the solo modes. Made those modes more fulfilling for me.
---
good chance of instalose vs cloning priest 
---
The core design of the card is generally fine. Only recently has Hunter been more than a minion heavy class. Sure, Baited Arrow exists, but a Baited Arrow cast randomly will rarely summon a 5/5, especially since it can target heroes. 
---
I also doubt Team 5 will print minion generation tools as strong as Emerald Spellstone or To My Side while Zul'jin is around seeing as this format is meant to be the send off for the entire archetype. Hunter is unlikely to get any board sweeping effect more powerful than Crushing Walls, Unleash the Hounds, or Explosive Trap.
---
Without value generation tools like Deathstalker Rexxar, the class will rarely if ever be able to play the long game, so a ten mana hero whose Hero power doesn't really do much in the grand scheme of things won't be that attractive to a deck that will likely play two Master's Calls and two Trackings.
---
Is it still on or you done it? 
---
The saddest thing is the way I read this made it sound like you were going to burst into song and become the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz.
---
Oh shut up. To counter combo decks you just play aggro and aggro is by far the cheapest archetype.
---
I'm rly sick of people blaming their losses on the fact that they don't spend any money.
---
&gt; Deathstalker Rexxar became much more oppressive with the introduction of certain beasts.
---
Right.
---
So you are looking at things within the context of other cards.
---
Are *you* daft? This is just what you criticised the community for.
---
&gt; To mention future potential cards being problematic isn’t looking at the context of the cards per say,
---
Per se*
---
And yes it is, rofl.
---
&gt; it’s to illustrate the point that given any context the card is dangerously powerful.
---
"Dangerously powerful" applies to tons of good and interesting cards, or even just simple but powerful cards. Limiting design space is something you *always* do when you print a card that is playable.
---
&gt; Which is to say, the card is designed poorly. 
---
Given what I just said, you just called every single playable card "designed poorly."
---
Which is obviously daft.
---
&gt; They have to tiptoe around printing any Hunter Spell that generates minions for the next year.
---
Which isn't as much of a problem as you seem to believe. 
---
Greedy late game decks.
---
They really designed a poor UI for the single-player campaign of Rastakhan's Rumble.  I've resorted to using a spreadsheet for keeping track of which heroes/shrines have been completed.

He's more comparable to N'Zoth right now, and the minions that were summoned by him weren't usually removable by four mana board sweepers and usually did something when they did die.
---
The only reason to play him IS the battlecry seeing as the Hero Power kinda sucks as an upgrade even just compared to the other post-Frozen Throne hero cards, and when Emerald Spellstone, To My Side, and some of the better secrets rotate out, what Hunter decks are left might not really want to play him.
---
"I deserved to win" lul
---
Man, you really are daft.
---
The fact that a certain *type* of card is limited due to one card is a general statement, not a context-specific statement. There could a card called Rexxar’s Anus for all I care, the point still stands; in any context, the card is too good.
---
&gt;Given what I just said, you just called every single playable card “designed poorly.”
---
Except this is completely different, numbskull. Were you around when they nerfed Yogg? Tell me, why did they nerf him? Because he was winning too many games singlehandedly. You think a card that can  do it MORE consistently isn’t problematic?
---
Hard disagree. I dislike playing all the odd decks at the moment, but cards that cause interesting deck building are the best cards in the game.
---
It might not seem like a big deal to those that just net deck everything, but its far more interesting for those who don't.
---
Continue your hiatus
---
Queue up as hunter and roll your face across the keyboard a few times.
---
I outplayed him in every sense. Then he refilled his board and cleared mine.
---
Any minion-centric deck without AoE faces this problem. And guess what, there’s a ton of decks like that.
---
I sincerely hope you get no karma.
---
Why do you record this on your phone? 
---
Because I wanted to Snapchat my brother and I couldn’t take the video twice 
---
So you lost to a guy playing to his win condition. Yup, you definitely outplayed him ^^^lul

This is only covering whether it is worth to re-roll a 60g quest.  If you are completing primarily high value quests (as we are) the numbers get even worse because those are on "cooldown" and out of the eligible quest pool.

Yeah but I’m lazy and didn’t feel like looking up the hot keys and then uploading it from there ..
---
How could you nerf baku? Stats of Baku herself just DON´T MATTER and changing the effect... oh well.
---
&gt;The core design of the card is generally fine.
---
It isn’t, though. They nerfed Yogg for the exact same reason I’m complaining about with Zul-jin. And Zul’jin is even more consistent.
---
[Same here lol](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T5bkExGVSGIGKriWjc1GYkwy2EnTwjt_/view?usp=drivesdk)

---
I’ve been playing this game for years. 1 card is a win condition? Gtfo with that shit
---
&gt; The fact that a certain type of card is limited due to one card is a general statement, not a context-specific statement. 
---
It's only Hunter Spells. And even then, there are *plenty* of Hunter Spells that aren't limited much at all by this.
---
&gt; There could a card called Rexxar’s Anus for all I care, the point still stands; in any context, the card is too good.
---
Sorry, you're an idiot to believe this.
---
&gt; Except this is completely different, numbskull. 
---
No it isn't. Every playable card limits design space. This is how card games work. It's not "different," you're just too tilted to see clearly.
---
&gt; Were you around when they nerfed Yogg?
---
Been around since Beta.
---
&gt; Tell me, why did they nerf him? Because he was winning too many games singlehandedly.
---
More so because he was just an all round powerful card that also led to a poor tournament experience.
---
&gt; You think a card that can do it MORE consistently isn’t problematic?
---
You mean clear the board and draw you cards? Zul'jin barely draws you cards, and does more to build a board rather than take one away. 
---
I get it. You're pissed off. But grow up for a second and stop seeing red instead of sense. Zul'jin is a powerful card. No one is saying otherwise. Zul'jin limits design space. Again, no one is saying otherwise.
---
But acting like it's an offence to card game design or that it is inherently a problem is naive and stupid. 
---

Some of it is good, yes. I really dislike how Disney-like they went on some of the cards. That plant legendary the rogues have is some of the ugliest art I have seen, ever.

It’s the absolute worst.

My experience was worse, Literally about to win, disconnects from match. Wasn’t able to reconnect. So my opponent won
---
Hunter should've got a Something Knuckles weapon that has Knuckles' effect.
---
Oh cool. But damn that seems like an extremely stupid way of doing it... 
---
Every time they make a card that works on demons they have to go the extra step.
---
Agreed this is cool. I had trouble picturing it from the title/concept. Too bad regular OTK mage isn't viable and only requires 6 cards and one turn. This requires way more setup and is blocked by taunt.
---
No, because then people would avoid using those STRICTLY COSMETIC heroes.

Done it well you say?  I say put the game into a far worse state than had none of these sort of cards even been printed.

They should just leave hero powers the fuck alone.  
---
I'm looking at a white house.
---
Right, I know that part, but it still feels inconsistent. If those heroes don't have tribes / can't be targeted as having tribes, Jaraxxus-hero shouldn't be treated as a tribal either.
---
Explain his other, non-golden minions.
---
There was even a kirpp video when reviewing KFT that stated the combo with the happy ghoul, and people were like "2000 iq play lul" and "its too inconsistent, better play real aggro".

That's canon.

Fair point, but sac was teched in during the reign of cubelock, even when DK guldan outclassed him anyways. If some more crazy demon shenanigans happens after DK guldan is gone, jaraxxus also has a chance of resurfacing so sac would still be usable as more than a jaraxxus countertech
---

Yeah DKs were such power creeps for control. I really hope they stop with the hero cards
---
Correction, it never works with random decks. Brawls where you create your own deck has it working fine. 
---
Wow, this deck is 100% legendary... This game is so fucking P2W
---
Or off of all the hunter secrets/spellstones/deadly shots/rain or toads. Jeweled Macaw is silly sometimes.
---
Thanks, no need to downvote a question though. 
---
What other cards would effect Jaraxxus because of his demon typing that don’t? There aren’t any. All other demon related cards apply buffs (and a hero doesn’t have stats to buff) or affect the card when it’s still a card, like drawing it, or recruiting it from your deck. 
---
Not a single exception has to be coded. It’s simply a demon and a hero. 
---
That wasn’t me.
---
I’ve always wondered: why do mechathun priests use the quest? From what I’ve seen it only seems to mess up the combo by adding amara to hand

---
I won't lie, I loved the new Elise 
---
On the other hand, when the card pool is small, the strength of the hero power sticks out even more.  And other decks may lack the synergies to overcome that.
---
For marginal or reactive hero powers like Mage and Warrior, or for midrange or control decks that care more about high card quality to outvalue people (Genn decks, Mage and Warrior again), those decks need card quality to supplement the hero power.  But Odd Paladin or Odd Rogue can just assemble whatever 1drops and 3drops are around, and steamroll off of how proactively powerful their hero power is.
---
Did i get a good minion this turn? Oh I didn't. Guess Ill concede then.

Tavern brawl in a nutshell: [https://i.imgur.com/wnmkJr6.png](https://i.imgur.com/wnmkJr6.png)
---
Snapjaw Shellfighter and Mosh'Ogg Announcer are other 5-drops that could see their way into Odd Rogue.  Unfortunately they are both Epics.
---
I wouldn't recommend it, odd rogue is all about early aggression, your weapon makes your life a resource in a similar way to how zoolock risks being low health for drawpower &amp; stats. You have to play confidently at low health since you don't really have any late game plans, and a 3/2 rush minion just isn't how you want to be spending 5 mana in this deck. Myras is a great 5 mana legendary in odd rogue that really pushes you to close out the game early while also giving you resources to do so, though a leeroy is without a doubt the first legendary I'd add to the list suggested here.
---
This opinion is correc
---
Hm, maybe it's worth a try.

Does the 10 pack rule apply for journey to ungoro or Knights of the frozen throne as well? I've opened some packs from it before but not 10 packs.

---
However, I have had no success in building the archetype on a budget. There are multiple key legendary cards in it - Luna, Leeroy, and Jan'alai - and I cannot figure out any good way to replace them nor have I been able to find any bigger structural changes that would enable a budget version to succeed. It just lacks too much reach.
---
However, as you already have Jan'alai, you might be able to get something done with that core. I have not tested exactly how many of those legendary cards the deck needs to be viable.
