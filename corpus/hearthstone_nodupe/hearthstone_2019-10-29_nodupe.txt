nope .i quit AROUND that period i rmb genn and baku got in hall of champions? or qhatever it 2as called i forgot. 
---
but i quit because its a pain to get new cards w a new rotation and was generally f2p didnt have much money.
---
---
---
But, again, there aren't any other one-card combos that happen when they are reduced to 0 mana.  Reducing most cards to 0 allows you to play combinations maybe, or it gives strong tempo.  But having one zero-cost card does not win the game on its own.  Emperor is good if you hit Naturalize + Elise + three other cards, you get the idea.  It's not good if you just hit Elise.
---

---
Like the Priest deathrattle card.  It wasn't a problem when it was reducing Devilsaur eggs, but as soon as you could pay 5 mana to play infinite Snipsnaps, they had to prematurely ban it.  Snipsnap uniquely exploits cost reduction in a way other cards don't.

I forgot the word "than" in that first comment. Thanks for pointing out the error.

It's probably called something dumb and cheezy like "Dragonblight Fight!"
---
That's a shame.
---
the problem is that its not particularly fun to die turn 5. i know blizzard wants to appeal to quick mobile gamers instead of people who spend longer amounts of time on the computer, but nobody is entitled to have turn 5, 2 minute games.
---
this is something i feel like people are wishing for and its simply not enjoyable for the other side. aggressive decks are fine but they shouldt regularly end games that fast. people shouldt just be able to race through games like that, no matter how much people want turn 5 lethal.
---
especially considering that control is supposed to counter aggro, so aggro isent supposed to beat control on turn 5 normally.
---
Is this game not f2p friendly?

I'm legend though 🙄

It’s true that I was not a big reddit user before blizzard’s blitzchung decision. But their action upset me so much as a dedicated Blizzard fan for decades (WC2, SC, Diablo, HotS, and of course HS) that I needed to find a place to come to hear other players’ thoughts on it and to speak up myself too. Before their decision, I played HS for hours every day for years, since the BRM/GvG era. I watched every tournament on the PlayHearthstone and Dreamhack twitch channels, as well as any other tournaments I could find, such as Seatstory. I watched numerous streamers and YouTube channels. I watched the HS twitch rivals events. I was really excited about the dual class arena coming back, getting to play with the wild cards that were temporarily back in standard that I didn’t own like N’zoth, finishing up the latest solo adventure, and playing the Halloween special events. My love and passion for the game is what made blizzard’s betrayal all the more painful.
---
And sunshine hunter
---
Or the game just gets boring after all those years
---
you are awesome
---
Because I'd much rather have a 2 mana 3-2 than a 1 mana 1-2. 1 mana 1-2s are terrible in arena. Just ignore each card's text, because it's irrelevant most of the time.
---
Used Zephyrs, best choice it gave me was frost nova.

Cubano#1167 NA Trading 80g quest, Ill show first then you challenge
---
Well I've been playing since before the release of BRM, been a contributor of the VS since early reports, and have been an avid fan of the game, but the elitism, greediness (3 exp per year, doubling the cost of decks (2 legends per exp, etc etc), lack of community acclaimed QoL improvements over the years, and the drop that spilled the glass the whole Hong Kong development plus the upcoming release of LoR has made me sail away from the HS ship and invest my money/time somewhere else where they do hopefully care more about its player base.
---
The meta where the game somehow gives them their 100+ dollars back so they can leave without feeling like a moron.
---
Sunk cost fallacy is a bitch and it’s usually the reason why people who bitch about the meta constantly stay around.

If you’ve not played arena recently, it’s good to get a single abysyl enforcer or fellfire potion, to get this many is like 1%
---
Woof. That is ***NOT*** a good sign. Seems like Blizzard pissing off the communities of their games has affected the playerbase dramatically, and people fucked off and left the game. I'm surprised it's that dramatic, that soon, and we have no idea how Blizzard will fuck up Blizzcon starting on Friday.

What about a vanilla 10 mana 100/100 lul

It’s a really creative idea and I love how you made it, but I think people prefer just collaborating the old fashioned way, by spectating their friends and helping each other find the best plays.

2: people can't complain about class dominance anymore.
---
3: ???

4: $profit$
---
Could be due to you either running a bit of a different deck than most others, or just your playstyle leading to different matchups. I remember a few years back when I played Midrange Hunter Freeze Mage would usually beat me, while I had a good win rate against Zoo (when it’s usually supposed to be the other way around). Out of habit I just never played aggressive enough to quite beat Mage.
---
What do you think is the correct play? Ballsy move at this point would be tirion and pray he doesnt have silence. But safe play probably would’ve been hero power first to get siphon from zeph, then trade huffer and snip into nozdormu maybe, and rest go face.
---
I feel like when you're using the Morgl poryrait "A Murloc" should be a 1/100 spinning wheel outcome for your opponent when matchmaking
---
Thanks :)
---
I know, my comment was agreeing it would look bad ass if it was
---
Its a average snip turn, there is apm tricks to up snipcount tapping and moving other minions
---
Ya, I would have hero powered before zeph.  With this board I’d blizzard, kill the taunt and go face with weapon and one snip.  Hard to gauge with secrets, but at least he would be 2 off lethal next turn with plenty to trade of he needs to stall again.
---
Murlocs, or any aggresive deck really. Add in a mossy horror for the frostmourne phase, and you’re golden.
---

I been playing this brawl for 5 days, you can't play around a paladin that gets coin when the board rotates counter-clockwise.
---
hmmm alright lol. whats the meta like? when i last played it was all reno kazakus mage and odd or even pali
---
it’s not the deck that people hate it’s the fact that if they have 3 specific cards in hand and manage to stick a mech on board before hand they can hit you in the face for 30 on turn 4
---
so much this.
---
* shamen is NOT op. there are so many vaible decks at the moment its crazy. 
---
* people love playing shamen. since we know its not a free win, it may be a deck people like to play for its mechanics. (i know i do)
---
* all the cards will rotate soon. no need to nerf something that will be gone seconds after.
---
Is this the guy that had a weird speech thing going on? I remember he cleared his throat weird or something.
---
this one’s ~~an inn~~ keeper!!!
---
same, not because it's particularly ugly but because I see it so much. It's gotten pretty boring because a lot of people don't bother to unequip it.
---
Did it ever occur to you that some people don't like super aggressive playstyles? 
---
That's not even the point though. N'zoth itself isnt the problem. It's Nzoth with the CURRENT MECHANICS on top of already Cancerous Meta decks that's the problem. I have lost to N'zoth Rogue with all of my decks. Control, Attrition, Aggro, Tempo, doesn't matter. Nzoth Quest Rogue Wins. Period. 
---
It's gotten to the point where I just auto concede whenever I fight a rogue because of tired of dealing with it.
---
It's pretty balanced I would say. It only works in specific decks once you're drawn a specific hand, and it very rarely survives more than one turn.
---
It's certainly *annoying* in the way it allows dank combo decks, but it's never been a dominant card in a meta. It just makes some particularly degenerate decks viable.

Ok thanks
---
That was a good read, thanks. As a (mostly) standard player that was absent during all time-related-shenanigans (RIP Time Spiral block) it is surprising to me that even in modern this card might be too slow.
---
I mean, if you are dead T4 then you don't really need this card. After all "dead men draw no cards".

Plug the person who made them I'd buy some.

To be honest this dr boom we are talking about if anyone were to accidentally discover the earth is round and not realize it then it would be him

Illuminaty confirmed !
---
evolve shaman is lame but you can adopt some counter-measures (which is somewhat fun) and it needs to actually play a game. maly druud, flamewalker mage and similar otk-from-hand decks are more annoying than shaman. also priest is too strong
---
Should’ve used your phone to take the picture like everyone else here
---
Thijs is such a lucker
---
I wouldn't expect a balance change before the next expansion since u/IksarHS basically spent the day on twitter telling everyone who was tired of the meta to go fuck themselves.
---
To summarize his thoughts, the fact that literally everyone is complaining about Shamanstone means nothing because his personal expertise and incredible intuition as a game designer tells him that everyone actually loves the Desert Hare, Mogu and Evolve combination. At Rank one Shaman is currently at over 40% popularity, which is clearly because everyone is having so much fun and not because it's by far the best class in the game.
---
since this BS will never end till evolve goes back to wild just wait, they already said nothing will be done
---
I have seen Big Priest lists that have dropped Ragnaros, but all Big Priest decks still use Catrina.
---
So if you don't play a class with board clear on turn 5, in order to beat Shaman's Evolve combo on turn 4, you need to fight an 8-drop and multiple 4-drops while not using more than three minions to play around MCT?
---

This is literally backwards logic. If you have seen decks do that they’re playing bad lists.

except for that you cant get eye for an eye and soulfire because this is arena. /s

But the Adventure based expansions also introduced a lot less cards. Personally i quite like the amount of cards we get right now.
---
I said a long time ago they should have added red shirt guy to the wheel.
---
In standard. Once the cards rotate to wild reno rogue and warrior will go back to being pretty much a joke. The only reason shaman works is because of Shudderwock.

Hmmm spoilers maybe? But boy say what you want but I absolutely loved that ending. That shit was risky but it turned out to be pretty awesome.

There is just about 35% of the player base in this game that will always net deck the most popular deck. I  think it's always been that way.

carlosgalan#1745 NA - trading 80g quest.
---

---
quickly restart the game next time, it will reconnect
---
Same problem here, doesnt matter if you have taunts or minions on board when they just brainlessly use battlecries to damage your face. It feels just as helpless as when I used to play against face hunters every second game.
---
No no the real Trailer goes live during the BlizzCon opening ceremony on Friday 👍
---
I always said we should have class bans on ladder. I still believe it'd be a good thing.
---
Every other expansion has some bullshit decks that are either way too strong, or just super unfun to play against (Shaman is both in this meta; way too strong, and super unfun to play against).
---
And the arguments I see against this are always the same 2;
---
*People would be able to make really strong decks if they can avoid their 1 bad matchup!*
---
People are already able to make really strong decks, they're EVERYONE's bad matchup and we can't avoid them.
---
*People who play the best deck would have really long queues if everyone bans them!*
---
Shamans can play each other, and have all games decided by who gets the better RNG evolve. They make up 35% of the meta, so they won't have long queues. If shamans ALSO ban shamans, then maybe there's a huge problem in the game, and 'Shamans having long queues' might not be as bad as 'People having to play vs shamans'.
---
&gt;  A one weekend event would have been ok, but not three weeks, including grandmasters and other tournaments with so much on the line
---
This is the part which confuses me the most about the event.
---
I'm sure Blizzard is heavily invested in its GM product on twitch and take it very serious; why then, do you insert such a huge change right before your playoffs which could drastically change the balance of competition?
---
Imagine if the NBA played 90% of its regular season and then the commissioner announces for the remainder of games including the playoffs, the height of the rim is changed to 12 feet and there are no longer 3-point shots allowed.
---
I haven’t played or followed HS since start of the last expansion. What happened between 5-18 October? Why did Shaman popularity go up so fast? A new archetype?
---
Jokes on you turn 4 desert hare.
---
Anyone else bothered with the choices of colors for different classes?
---
Its litteraly the oldest trick in HS book...  If you don't have the time to wait a full game, don't start a game or play casual...  I don't personnaly do that but when I need the full rope to make my decision, don't come here crying like a little baby that the opponent take to much time.  The game allows you 70 seconds to act, you can fully use that time every single turn if you want.  And to be honest, it not a current behavior, even within the top rank so when it happen, lay back, take your time too and beat the guy.
---
Their profits are hinges upon this delicate dance.
---
They can’t make changes too often or they would have to refund too much dust/investment.
---
They can’t make changes too slowly or people gets pissed obviously.
---
Their only goal is to make sure their meta is stale enough to establish “the best” decks for people to buy, while also making sure it’s not too stale that people won’t buy them.
---
Shaman is really tough to make good without becoming too good.  They're a class with a really broad identity and especially heavy RNG elements (although at least they're not still printing stuff like Crackle.)  They're a jack-of-all-trades class that packs tons of the game's most powerful effects (board buffing, mana cheating, transform removal, etc.)  When they're tuned to be good they're intensely frustrating because they can do everything and cover all of their weaknesses.
---
Obviously you could make similar arguments for other classes, too.  I don't think Shaman is uniquely broken or anything.  I just feel like they more than any other class could benefit from a real reshuffling of the game's class identities.
---
Ah i see, damn thats sad then:(
---
Thanks for reply buddy
---
If you think that your opponent having 3 * four mana minions and a Ragnaros (or 3 * four mana minions and a Tyrion, etc) on turn 4 being bad design isn't PAINFULLY OBVIOUS, I don't know what to tell you.
---
*Just don't play minions so their Mogu won't be free LUL*
---
Good luck beating shaman by not playing anything. And even if such strategy worked, it's not viable to run such a deck in the meta. Then again I suppose if they do nothing, the meta will soon be 75% shaman so it might be viable then.
---
"You will beg for mercy, and I will deny you!!!"
---
It's not good per se.  And with the new expansion looking likes a dragons one, mech probably wont see many prints.  If you need the dust, dust him.
---
I am just speaking from my own experience as I was beating lich king recently as well. The murlocs just didn't work for me most of the time(except shaman and 1 more hero I think) and went to find another decks which I finished it with after.
---
I've been gone as a warlock main for a while now 🤔
---
I’m rank 5 and normally concede if I see a rank 6 in the queue. This isn’t true if they are playing Shaman. I crush them...
---
I see a lot of Mages close to losing with a secret play as if it is Ice Block
---
It's usually take less than a week to nerf unbalanced cards in gwent. Mtg used to rebalance card IRL, which is way more harder. There is no reason for HS to be that slow. It's else money involved or lazy, incompetent and ignorant team. Their "collect data" excuse is literally joke.
---
Not just Shamanstone, but I really abhor Sylvanis/Khartut/N'Zoth-Stone as well.
---
Becauss its inconsistent? Same reason why pogo isnt meta, card draw rng. That doesn't change the fact of the matter.
---
You're missing the point. **Often**. This meta isn't your run-of-the-mill bad design, this is blatantly, grotesquely, bad. That's the point. Most bad design is more insidious than this.
---
Excited for another year of warrior being unplayable because theyre scared to give them anything good again lol
---
You keep your free tickets, and you only see how many you have when you're about to purchase a new run.
---
My only class seems like the least played lol
---
I’ve been gone for a while, what is happening?
---
As the winrate increases, many more people inexperienced with the deck pick it up, bumping up the playrate and decreasing the winrate. Also, because Shaman is so oppressive, it's being heavily teched against and you are more likely to see decks that pray on Shaman but lose to other matchups. It's a vicious game of rock-paper-scissors. We do not want to nerf decks because they are more fun to play than others, we want to nerf them because they are unfair strategies. Combo Priest beats Quest Shaman, but loses hard to Tempo Rogue. In return, both primary Shaman variants destroy Tempo Rogue.
---
Let's hope this is for the best.
---
From turn 4 including turn 4. And you die on turn 10 to Mechatun if you somehow manage to kill every single shitty mech.
---
Rastakhan Hunter had Spell (no minions + Rokdelar + Zuljin), Midrange (Small beasts) and Deathrattle (Cube + Sylvanas). 3 decks that were quite different.  
---
In comparison, Evolve is in 74% of Shaman decks, Mogu in 90% and Corrupt the water in 57%.
---
Wait I thought the wild cards were going away Nov 1.
---
Honestly, all the wild cards need to go. If you only fixed shaman, then the control decks would be everywhere. Having N'Zoth without enough aggro to keep it in check would be awful. Not to mention, infinite Quest druid with Kun would probably run rampant. 
---
The game was far more balanced before these cards came into the picture.
---
Yeah, I should have been more precise. You are right, it wasn’t necessarily the 8/8, it was the two 8/8s that fucked you.
---
That's some kinda zoo right? So unless he taunts him you're not really in trouble I think.
---
Does murloc shaman even play evolve?
---
Let me guess. 3/3 Elks?
---
Spell lackey is waaaay too OP in quest shaman. 1 mana find an answer to the board. They consistently pull shit out of their ass and find ridiculous outs with this card, I've stopped playing as least until this meta passes.
---
Shoot, meant Kathrena Winterwisp

nope, actually it's super situational and requires your opponent to have multiple minions with value battlecries up on the board at once. So basically in extremely few cases it'll pay off, and even then you draw only 1-2 minions at most. Vast majority of the time this card is hot garbage.

Appreciate the level headed response. Honestly just kinda tired of so much hate directed via generalization. Move on and just see this as another "rant" post I guess.
