OMG! That's not a cigar!
---

---
Yo I thought he had a cigar in his mouth this whole time
---
We were actually told by blizzard that it *would* add new beasts with subsequent expansions, at the time of its first release. That was why people were still hyped about it
---
Team spirits be the best spirits.
---
Actually it looks like the opposite. Cards designed for Aggro specifically is getting rarer and rarer in newer expansions. Without Baku and Keleseth, getting that last bit of damage in before two turns of big taunts will be hard for many classes soon. The Year of The Raven didn't add much to help that... unless you play hunter 
---
Plus Loatheb battlecry to basically lock the game
---
I picked him because of his name and because he was European. My friend did it for the same reasons and we are watching the GF now. 
---
He wouldn't have though.
---

---
People hate on Rexxar because he's a one card win condition against control decks. Even with the old pool, he still would have done that. Most of the beasts you make with Rexxar are pretty mediocre anyway, but since they never stop coming it doesn't matter.
---
He would have been a worse card with only the old pool, sure, but not in the way that people complain about.
---
SAME it's my most hated card ever. It's the core for my two most hated decks, cubelock and deathratle hunter
---
By final chapter, I mean the one with the massive battle that ends the war. She even [said it, herself](https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5119836.stm) when referring to the battle and the deaths therein.
---
I hate this card
---
Reminds memoreof nagrand than stranglethorn
---
They look gud, and it's a luxury. I from the start never dusted gold. I wish I had never started collecting them though, Id probably have every card. 
---
a few expension later, none of the classic cards were playable. classes identity changes every expansion 
---
You shouldn’t use Tracking on turn one. The goal of that card is to maximize value, you use it when you need a specific card in a specific situation. Not on turn one, when you don’t yet know what you are going to need. If used in turn one, it’s nothing more, than deck trimming, which hunter generally doesn’t need,

That’s pretty much how arena works. You think you’ve built the best deck ever, with constructed synergies and combos, and you’ll still go 0-3 because of rng. Fully random cards with low tier scores are just as capable of getting 12 wins as they are getting 0. Arena always feels like a casino game to me, and strategy so rarely comes up, that it’s better to just play everything on curve. 
---
&gt;Cards designed for Aggro specifically is getting rarer and rarer in newer expansions.
---
Unless they literally stop printing new burn for Mage, token synergy for Druid, cheap efficient minions for Warlock, etc. and fundamentally change the identity of the classes by removing Basic and Classic entirely, the potential will always be there.
---
Some classes only need one or two aggressive cards every other year for it to happen in Standard.
---
Yup. People think that legacy is a faster format than modern and it isn't because of force of will. It really adds a lot of depth to the game 
---
done with pszemek#21805

Does rexxar summon three 1/3s and summon two 3/9s when he dies?

Rexxar and Cube the two worst cards in this meta
---
The elephants guide me.

I'm not sure what you mean... ?
---
Ah this again. Can I post it tomorrow?
---
Should have gotten a 2 year ban from all hearthstone tournaments, instead blizzard lets him win their biggest tournament of the season.
---
Currently 2/2 on choosing Bunnyhopper for my alt account. Zero for like three years on choosing absolutely anyone successfully on the account I care about.
---
Going be downvote but did roger cheat in this championship? If not ? Why so salty ?  He was punished by blizzard already , so why not just let it go 
---
Nope. He lost. Part of the game is giving yourself enough time for plays and being accurate with your input.
---
This if like saying, "I out played you by sneaking up on you, but missed the head shot, so you killed me."
---
I said:

---
You said:
---
&gt;They did all of that in the Year of the Raven.
---
Here are some cards printed in the Year of the Raven that could easily be part of the aggressive archetypes I described post rotation (note this doesn’t even take neutral cards into consideration):
---
Cinderstorm, Cosmic Anomaly, Stargazer Luna, Elemental Invocation, Wispering Woods, Floop’s Glorious Gloop, Landscaping, Ratcatcher, Doubling Imp, Soul Infusion, The Soularium, Void Analyst, Demonbolt, Grim Rally, High Priestess Jeklik, Spirit of the Bat.
---
Some of these have already seen play in those exact archetypes. Ignoring that these cards exist and suggesting that Blizzard will never print cards like them or even more aggressive ever again is a baseless claim and demonstrates a lack of understanding of how metas form. Power is relative, and the Year of the Mammoth was extremely overpowered, diminishing the effect of a lot of Raven cards over the last year. But after rotation and the Hall of Fame, the relative power level will drop bringing a lot of these cards into viability.
---
There’s no reason to think Hunter will be the only aggressive class in the meta much less that Blizzard is intentionally removing aggro from the other classes permanently or even temporarily. Obviously we'll have to see what's in the new set, but your claim is based on nothing and ignores cards and history that contradict it.
---
Surrender at 9 mana or 8 if you still have coin to enable psychic scream the next turn. Combo surrender with Zihi. Never surrender early. Try to surrender before drawing too much (so long as you have survival tools in hand). The spirit is a luxury, and not really worth looking for.
---
For mulligans you're looking for keleseth, tar creeper and northshire, basically survival vs aggression. 
---
It would probably do nothing to change the outcome.
---
People take losing pretty hard. To be honest, I’m just really sad that this behavior prevents people from wanting to accept friend requests after matches. 
---
Often I just want to tell someone that was a great game, or ask them about their deck or something. When they don’t accept, it makes me a bit sad because now they probably think I’m angry. 
---
I did and it was equally as useless as everything else you said.
---
Unfortunately I am on the Asian server - Pm me your username anyway and il see if we can make something happen.
---
Winrate wise, it might not be hugely different but that lifesteal+rush beast haunts me to this day.
---
How hard did the Espionage Rogue beat you for saying that the card should have double cost?
---
the only class that ever gets a coin in expansions 
---
GMAC921#1889 looking to trade 80g quest on NA 
---
Yea, they’re awesome but I can’t afford to keep them; need the dust and then I hate inconsistency. 
---
He didn't cheat on hct winter bruh..
---
-.-
---
Oh, so when I do it it's considered bm and slowplay
---
I think the skepticism is that there aren’t 3400 legends on day 3.
---
Consistency
---
I'mma miss this card
---
I think 1 year for all of the offenders would've been sufficient, 2 years is practically death, but 1 year allows you to still have rehabilitation as a possibility.
---
Yeah, I play a ton of Rogue and neverending Obsidian Statues can absolutely fuck my day up
---
Wtf
---
Actually, it's the grand tournament that has the "no dragons allowed" policy (and even there it's rarely enforced). It might be perfectly legal in gurubashi arena. 
---
I always thought he had a cigar in good mouth not a handle to a mace lol 
---
That was definitely rough, though not quite as bad imo. 
---
Dude you're missing my point.
---
1. Again, I have no issue with you avoiding lethal to pull off the big boar, but its the fact that you made it sound like you were aware of them all and intentionally missed them that rubbed me the wrong way.
---
2. Just answer my question. If the point is to highlight the OTK and you didn't care about missing/avoiding lethals to achieve it, then why even bother with this statement, "I missed lethal a couple times in the video, but I was just going for the big boar"? What was the purpose of acknowledging the missed lethals the way you did at all?
---
3. Perhaps you should actually address my question instead of going off on a tangent again.
---
can we talk about how 12 penguins can kill deathwing?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
**TREE IN ART**
---
Oh you were taking about Kobolds, missed that. Carry on 
---
Fiery war axe isn't that bad in odd warrior
---
Pretty hard without Rexxar unfortunately... note that all dk will rotate out in April, so even if your win rate may not be great without it, as a f2p you might be better off not crafting it and use another card such a Savanna for instance 
---
To be fair, it could be reasonable guessed that nobody would actually play counterspell when their opponent has the coin in his hand.
---
Not exactly an automatic misplay based on that. Hindsight is 20/20, but there is legitimate reason why it wouldnt be counterspell
---
Modo is just a name for Mtgo, the old online MtG client. It is quite ugly by today's standards, but has the majority of sets available.
---
The prices are also among the cheapest if you want to play with an official product, even in standard due to the rising popularity of arena lowering prices. 
---
And yeah goblin guide is the most expensive card in the deck, mostly because it sees play in several formats. It's funny to see powerhouses such as Price of Progress being much cheaper simply due to supply and demand. 
---
But he DID cheat. He didn’t even get a one year ban from all blizzard tournaments which I think would have been a suitable punishment. 
---
Not Hearthstone, but a parallel to MTG would be 15 squirrels killing Emrakul (I would call her the equivalent of the most powerful Old God as a comparison to WoW I guess).
---
except he cheated multiple ways and was never punished for the 2nd way, which is what qualified him for this tournament.
---
I don't think being punished once means you are now immune from ever being punished again in the future, but maybe I'm wrong.
---
Blizzard literally doesn't care about Wild enough to proof-watch a 2 and a half minute video
---
Four Horsemen, that's Magic as Richard Garfield intended
---
Narrator: it wasn’t
---
The only reason I mentioned them is because you fucking commented man. When I said I missed lethal multiple times, on purpose, it was referring to all the turns I had the combo and didn't play it. I didn't see the play you're referring to and I already admitted it. Absolutely insane that you're still going honestly. Sorry I "rubbed you the wrong way." 
---
Wow. This has been in my deck forever. And I am just now realizing it’s not a cigar 
---
Toast's ShudderYogg Reno deck. A pretty decent deck if you don't get uber crushed by aggro. After Saronite was nerfed I replaced it with Sabetour I think is his name (TGT card with battle cry to make you opponent's hero power to cost 5 more next turn), but Zihi can work as another substitute.
---
Also: Concede Warlock is hillarious.
---
You can also win with dragon burn priest. Currently iceblock isn’t really popular 
---
Nope.
---
Hunter should be nerfed long long ago 
---
Savj's Weasel Priest. Fun vs big priest. 
---
lol... thats justifiable.. /s they nerfed fiery war axe as an answer to pirate warrior, which was insanely busted at the time. after the deck shifted out, they nerfed the card that shouldve been in the first place( 1/1 charge for 1, free cast when you play a pirate) 
---
oh i see. good to know.
---
thats fair,w ell mtga is on the rise! 1 million in prizes i believe. 
---
no fetch lands &lt;3
---
Am I the only one that's never noticed the Kobold inside of him!? 
---
no, i've seen streamer like thjis loses over misclicking a card. whoever missclicking deserved to lose. you had 75 seconds to play a card and you misclick because the rope start to burn out? serves you right slow player 
---
I think blizzard needs to seriously start upping their casting game. I know I’m not the only one who can’t stand 90% of the normal casters at HCT events. They need more confident, skilled players casting. I personally love it when they have competitive players cast events just like firebat. Better casters = more viewers 
---
The average pack has about 100 dust for 100 gold. Karazhan costs 2800 gold total and has a dust value of 2950 dust. Which is about 105 dust per 100 gold. So the difference is just do you want to play the solo content or have the chance to unpack cards that you will actually use. IMO I really enjoyed karazhan’s bosses and they each had some interesting mechanics. So I would go for it unless you are short on viable ladder decks currently, but the difference is minimal.
---
This. Comparisons to Legacy don’t hold water when (generally, obviously there have been exceptions) the format has the tools to police itself. Legacy should be what Wild aims to be, and currently its nowhere close. 
---
Shudderwock Jade Shaman sounds really fun!
---
Just looked it up. They did, but only for 3+ wins. Only got 2 this time, so that'd be why.
---
Guldan: That was a my stake
---
Lol you mentioned them even before we started this conversation, it was in your original comment...
---
Can you answer the question now or are you going to continue to dance around it?
---
Seems like you're the one making your comments extremely negative. One condescending apology after another really doesn't help. 
---
Does the repeated Battlecry count the ones from Yogg's castings? That would be really fun
---
Weasel Priest, Weasel Shaman, Jade Rogue, Mill Druid, Mill Priest, Happylock, Glinda Echolock, basically I really enjoy how powerful you can make meme decks in wild just by knowing the meta and building around it
---
No disparagers of the magmarager!
---
For that one time it was the best Servant of Kalimos pick in Arena.
---
ONEPUUUUNCH!!!
---
Oddly enough, you’re almost better off running more traditional Aggro Paladin decks since minions like Minibot screw with Defile and Hellfire pretty hard. I’ve been seeing a lot of those recently. 
---
This is fine...
---
Things are gonna be okay. 
---
What are the keys for Mill Priest? 
---
That sounds right up my alley.
---
It’s a win more card. If you already have board control on turn 4, you can afford to play an understated minion, which will give you hightened value in the next several turns.
---
It can make sure you snowball an early lead in to a win very easily that’s why people pick it
---
Deck? 
---
Kingsbane was sorta nerfed as well, which killed the Mill variant that used it.
---
As of now, there's only 44 legend players in North America.

---
I'm just going by based on what they've said about Aggressive cards in interviews and announcement. The quality of aggressive cards and burn has gone down in the Year of the Raven and many aggressive cards have been HOFed and nerfed. If this continues, positivity for non-Hunter aggro in a post rotation world without Baku and Genn doesn't look good if the control and combo cards keep coming.
---
Perhaps I might be wrong. However the constant complaints about aggressive decks and cards in any class but Hunter by the devs worries me. It seems like they will push many of them to Midrange decks.
---
Embarrassing for Blizzard and for Hearthstone. There was post-game interviews discussing how it was "controversial" for him to be at the tourney that made me feel physically angry. 
---
Imagine a football player stealing the playbook from the opposing team, in addition to paying off opposing teams to let his team win... essentially what has happened, in real-time, and is then actively celebrated my Blizzard who go ahead and reward this behaviour with the top prize.
---
Says a lot about the state of the game &amp; community as a whole. Bad look.
---
Quest, Dancing Swords, Coldlights, Spirit of The Dead, Seance, and Deathlord, with twilights call, seance and spirit of the dead you just mill them so quickly, while still having all the removal and healing of priest, I can send my list if you are interested
---
He was caught win trading on ladder the last day of April 2018 to get a good finish for HCT points. ← it's not true. He get rank one in Eu server that month. And he surrender to his friends in Na server.
---
In Wild, a warlock can die on turn 3 if he starts on the coin:
---
Turn 1: Coin, Bloodbloom, DOOM!
---
Turn 2: Bloodbloom, DOOM!
---
Turn 3: Chittering Tunneler discovers DOOM!
---
wow thanks for sharing
---
That's cool though, if your own creation isn't broken, you aren't doing it right :D
---
Rest in hell, DK's.

That's why I no longer watch any tournaments anymore. If Blizzard isn't going to care about the integrity of their tournaments then why should I?
---
Raza is still good. Reno Priest is still a very real deck in Wild. 
---
If they’re designed cards expecting them to alter the meta so significantly that they need to be removed quickly, they’re just designing bad cards.
---
I member patches yeah, but Fiery War Axe was in every control warrior deck as well and isn't called fiery win axe without reason
---
Apxvoid cheats too.He should be ban as well.
---
Dane's Big Rogue
---
DOOM FOR EVERYONE
---
Could be. I always liked Huhuran and thought it was weird that the stalker was better than the legendary.
---
Me eat face?
---
It's the opponent's turn. Hero can't have an attack value except on your own turn. 
---
I heard POTUS cheated too
---
They had to pick the least trigger-inducing card in HS. Imagine if they put in something like Malygos, people who see the ad would be like "Oh shit that's still in the game? That's so broken, Why would I want to go back?"
---
That sounds amazing, but I'm glad I never had to face a Hagatha Yogg in Standard ladder!
---
I vote for more deck slots!
---
When Hell freezes over?
---
Deathrattle activator while summoning more Deathrattles on top of a decent body?? 
---
This has happened to me before and I was so conflicted about whether to add and message them(I didn't). Not to tell them "you didn't deserve the win" but just to vent like "OMG I missed lethal 2 turns before you won! I'm an idiot!"
---
Odd priest 😔 🙏
---
Thanks, I couldn’t even explain to the people around me why I kept giggling 
---
How is it high risk? Most of the time it gets triggered the same turn it gets played because most of the triggers only cost 1 mana.
---
there should be though, sounds like a Gift feature would be cool.
---
Shhh you sound silly sweetheart maybe once you reach legend you’ll understand a thing or two about the game! You can stop replying now 💅🏻
---
Yeah but then people would have proxy accounts to farm dust and then donate it. There is no way to make the system work
---
Legacy is the only other format I play besides Modern. Not saying it’s common nor busting on the format at all. I think it’s the most balanced of the non-standard formats. But it’s always hilarious when a turn one win does come together. 
---
How so?
---
Eh, It's not the best deck out there. While it has a lot of removal, if you get rushed early and draw poorly you're kinda fucked. Not to mention Yogg can screw you just as much as he can save you, so take that for what it's worth.
---
r/iamverysmart 
---
I’m pretty sure all ladder grinders are doing shady stuff.  Having multiple people play their accounts , screen sharing matches .    I guess it doesn’t matter now since ladder doesn’t matter but with online qualifiers it opens new ways s cheating 
---
&gt; nobody is saying he didn't. 
---
the comment right above you is saying that actually   
---
the comment by SW-DocSpock
---
when I first started, i quickly realized how useless it is compared to a 2mana 2/3 
---
Aviana Kun and a bit of luck. If you get the return a minion to your hand Spare part you can play cho and Innervate to return a Nozdormu infinitely with Azalina
---
This. Before witchwood his role was spam random big dudes against control and hope they run out of removal, but realistically even the heaviest of lists just needed one turn of killing a zombeast and developing a threat to win. Hunter has very few ways to take back a board and once that switch is flipped they're pretty done if they can't burn out the opponent. 
---
With rush, and lifesteal to a lesser extent, they were allowed to make a big dude that kills something and survives which completely changes up that dynamic. Nevermind the super highroll combos involving rush/lifesteal/poison or aoe that allowed rexxar to act as a stabiliser when losing.
---
While I hate the card and very much dislike how it turns some games into draw this and win automatically, or at the very least have a chance in a lost game, it would have been extremely weird, inconsistent and just outright wrong to not update him with new expansions like every other card. Could have just not printed scalehide though. Singehandedly bringing back quest rogue and enabling rexxars dominance as a 2-drop. Ugh.
---
Cringey
---
Because it's not the thread to ask questions you donkey
---
It's an amazing card! It's the only card I ever managed to play against the lich king before dying in the first solo mission of KoFT! 
---
I think that's a bit of a false equivalence.
---
I agree. However they say they nerfed these last cards bc they were ‘auto includes’ In ppls decks. Zilliax is so good there is often space for him in many decks. That might eventually nerf him. 
---
Well I guess we know who the number one most rooted against player at worlds will be 
---
Cubelock was called cubelock because of the overwhelming impact of the cube.
---
It would either combo with Doomguard to win the game or combo with voidlord to win the game.
---
Cube is also an integral part of deathrattle hunter.
---
uHhM aCkShUaLLy I rEaLLy aPpReCiAtE tHe iNpUt
---
You just asked a question tho
---
that was the best part
---
No, not necessary but your winrate will tank against control decks.
---
Or you could be dealing with two groups of people. 
---
There are the camps that think hunter is just fine as is, and they love queuing it up every day and will tell you how it's fine that they can take nearly any set of cards, stick DK Rexxar in there, and have a semi-viable deck in many situations.
---
Then you have other people making posts talking about how happy they'll be when Rexxar is gone.
---
Same goes for any card and they'll vote the way that they will.
---
However, as long as Zilliax is in Standard, it will be extremely difficult for other neutral five drops to see play at least in  decks that aren't leaning towards aggressive. It's a small drawback, but it is an important one to consider.
---
Strong neutral cards are nice, but they will be seen in every deck even remotely interested in playing with them. It's a problem that is difficult to remedy properly.
---
What's the only Animal Companion stronger than Huffer? Another Huffer.
---
If a card is NEVER kept on the opening draw in any matchup, it's probably balanced enough...
---
People did guess the trolls really early on, because the white marks = troll teeth.
---
Ever noticed how they never nerfed Psychic Scream, which is obviously an auto-include in Priest decks.  Oh well, I guess they chalked that one up to "rotating soon."
---
I just don't feel like that is the end all, be all, of their criterion.
---
2 mana 6 damage is just super efficient.
---
Losing one game is not win-trading, not by common-sense and not by Blizzard's rules (read the rulebook, it refers to "excessive wintrading"). If he had been doing it regularly he would have been sanctioned, as players have been in the past. 
---
As for trusting him, no need, but he's the most popular Taiwanese streamer, and consistently has 1000s of viewers. He has qualified for almost every single prelims over the past few years, and the majority of his play (including his late finishes) have been on stream. No questions about win-trading have ever been raised. 
---
As a nearly exclusive wild player I'm a big fan of this. While they're thinking about Deathstalker Rexxar I would hope that they also include every beast costing 5 or less (instead of excluding minions with both unique abilities and keywords). I know it only affects two cards (king of beasts and witchwood grizzly) but it would be a nice quality of life change.
---
Thanks for the reply, I crafted the gold common cards
---
Yes that's the B.S. part...
---
Yes, especially strong neutrals with Taunt (as we’ve seen lots of those, Saronite, Tar Creeper, Sludge Belcher, Stonehill. 
---
I hardly ever lose to Shirvallah decks. Once you recognize a Shirvallah deck, you can win before the combo by not overextending your resources such that Wild Pyromancer + Equality puts you into top deck mode.
---
It works 60% of the time, everytime.
---
I don’t want my suicide to be facilitated Tunneler rng. It feels like cheating my way to death. 
---
You could win playing on the draw on the upkeep of your opponent before they could play anything. 
---
KnC2, featuring 2 mana Prince Kobold Death Knights
---
For March they went with a cool card back with an anchor instead (nice for pirate deck): https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/1101542662405013504  
---
Maybe they'll do it for April.
---
Not to mention that a) Kripp has 0 control over that, and b) given that he wins around 70% of his games, unlike ladder where the best players are still just north of 50, he’d need to be seeing more than twice as many people conceding to him because he’s Kripp than people sniping him with crazy decks and then using his stream against him to beat him for all of it to wash out in his advantage. That’s very obviously not the case, he sees more snipers than people giving him wins. 
---
Knowing when to heal, and when to use for removal instead of for heal.  My guess from your comment is you spend more time playing against decks with mechs than with them.
---
molten giant...
---
That's a horrible example if you mean American football. Look up spygate. Also teams lose to other teams for better draft picks or at the end of the year to get worst teams into the playoffs sometimes. 
---
Or just save it in word kid 
---
Whats better than 1 death wing? 2 DEATHWINGS! WHATS BETTER THAN 2 DEATHWINGS? 4!!!!!!!! 
---
This was for stream sniping. He wasn't punished for win trading.
---
I am not too impressed with Whizbang, some cheap deck like beast hunter even without the DK will give you better winrate. But I would definitely try to save as much dust as possible to invest into cards going into hall of fame.
---
Actually there were people that claimed they thought the last one would be troll-themed, though there were numerous other explanations as well, including some (under)water world IIRC and something Panda-themed.

Also, some threads heavily demanded content for "Zappy Boi" Zekhan. It wasn't completely unexpected.

Yo real shit, I've been playing Odd Mage and I had to learn the hard way not to start a game if my phone was at less than 15% battery... just in case
---
Yeah, I was missing him on the casting desk (although I don't watch many tournaments). 
---
Free up storage space and see if that helps
---
If you're losing badly by turn 5, how is a 6 mana card going to help?
---
It’s an unfortunate example because the Patriots were also insufficiently punished for both Spygate and Deflate-Gate, but it’s still a good example. The NFL should’ve levied harsher penalties and Blizzard should as well.
---
I think they meant patches the pirate
---
&gt; What was his punishment? Please don't tell me you consider "being disqualified from a tournament you cheated in" to be a punishment.
---
&gt; That's like saying that if you take the goods back from a shoplifter, he was punished. No he wasn't, he lost nothing at all (but his time).
---
i forgot to mention that the "warned" part refers to the "punishment" he got for wintrading, and yes disqualification does seem light of a punishment when the they ghost the other player intentionally.
---
 i was being sarcastic in my first comment that blizzard did their best in punishing cheaters.
---
I agree. In my opinion if he qualified through cheating he should have been banned from the tournament. 
---
I don't think that it's such a great effort from blizzard to come up with clear rules. If they don't want to do it themselves they could easily ask the community. And let the community to stand on guard of those rules. If there is obvious cheating, with evidence, players should suffer consequences. 
---
The next expansion will likely be more powerful than the last three; I would wait until that comes out before deciding which cards you really need.
---
I'm the age where Donnie Darko was a big deal.
---

---
Why would you want to blow all your gold on WW packs? What outcome would you want from this path?
---
As other people have said, it's just personal preference. For me, it has nothing to do with obscuring class colours or anything like that. I just find them aesthectically displeasing. It is just as reasonable or unreasonable as you liking golden cards.
---
As an aside, which video are you referencing? I'd like to watch Zalae call golden cards 'yucky'.
---
&gt; Since many of the card rotated are witchwood
---
witchwood is not rotating this year, it's next year 2020. http://standardhearth.com/
---
Divine favor and naturalize were also big anti-control cards and with a few neutral combo distruptors printed i can see a potential control vs midrange meta but dont forget so many cheap taunts are rotating which is always good for aggro. I am overly hyped for the post rotation meta. It will feel like a new game. 
---
Play priest, it outvalues warrior.
---
Or play merps hunters, its hard but bodies slow decks.
---
I agree that it's important to have facts straight. But that's where Blizz eSports team should come in with inquiry results official statement. 
---
Hoping to get golden genn/Baku and their odd/even cards is my guess. 
---
One time I was playing a spell hunter and he had rok'delar equipped for lethal but then he replaced it with a candle shot and I was able to win two turns later. I messaged him after the game and it turns out he forgot he had a weapon already equipped.
---
Well... we're fucked
---
I mean the HoF card
---
That’s probably the most card draw a hunter has seen in the history of hearthstone. 
---
I feel like you're just messing with me at this point lmao. In case you haven't played the card, no, you can't make a zombeast that costs 10 out of a 6 and 4 mana beast, minions over 5 are **never** offered in the first place. And the categories for beasts are first text and second keyword/vanilla. That covers every beast type in the game.
---
Ask in a stream or take it up with a dev on twitter or something if I still haven't convinced you though, I'm done.
---
Yeah, you don't play leeching at all anymore
---
When is the world championship?
---
Not if you don't make any assumptions, no.
---
It definitely wouldn't become a brainless inclusion, but considering how little grief it causes despite how ubiquitous it is, I don't think it's necessary to nerf it.
---
At least, not yet. Come rotation we'll see if Zilliax becomes excessive.
---
pshychic scream is not an auto include
---
But those old limitations still exist. Limiting it by expansion would get adding an extra limitation.
---
You could always play wild
---
Untamed Beastmaster + Call Pet, such a great combo haha
---
I don’t think so, no. It would have just polarised rexxars matchups a bit more. Calling that “fixing the meta” is a bit much I think.
---
Wild sheet only big priest. Fucking trash
---
The text says catch up with **classic** Hearthstone; that's why.
---
Dread Scale and Giant Wasp is already a thing
---
Just another thing to add, if you don't like or agree with a particular rule then you're probably better off contacting the mods to have a discussion about why that's there and why you think something should change so the mods can see particular reasons something might not work while also explaining their point of view as to why something's there.
---
Simply downvoting does practically nothing in regards to changing things.
---
Yeah I know
---
im on for at least a few hours a day so if u wanna add me its czerk#1414 :)
---
wtf that's so strong
---
I know Right! My friends think I'm crazy!
---
We are a month from the expansion, it wont be a mistery for that long
---
I probably will till I know what to build
---
When the person who makes the video can't even be bothered to netdeck an anyfin list that includes anyfin... feelswildman ='(
---
Its the same difference between not knowing how to spell something and making a typo.
---
&gt; My question is, how do I know what deck to build after the rotation?
---
You don't. In fact, no one does. Some players can be good deck builders and find great decks from the get-go, but even then it often takes at least a couple of weeks before these decks get refined. Oftentimes lots of theorycrafters on /r/hearthstone or /r/competitiveHS puts some elbows together and crack a deck that most people miss because the synergies aren't so obvious.
---
But just check how often people's anticipations and expectations are *not* met or are outright contradicted once an actual card set releases. 
---
&gt; I like finding decks online and then grind dust and gold till I can afford them. But how do I know wich deck is effective in the current expansion?
---
The best thing you can do is to wait about a month post expansion release before spending your gold and dust, if you want to be economical.
---
&gt; I could just do a post about it here asking what deck to build, but if there's a website where I can read on the best decks currently etc that whould help alot!
---
[Vicious Syndicate.](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/)
---
They do a Weekly "Data Reaper Report" where they tell you what the most powerful and most popular decks are according to their information. It's a very, *very* useful tool.
---
With this said, if I remember right they tend to take a two week break or something after a set release, if only because things are so volatile and so many things are being tried out that the information isn't particularly useful. Like I said, it takes time for decks to be discovered and refined.
---
I hope this helps!
---
I don't really agree. For me it's like when people say Fire fly or stonehill defender, or tar creeper, or saronite chain gang are fair cards, they're fair because they're neutral so everyone can use the cards, which in the end make it fair. But when you see how often these cards are used, I don't think it's right. What makes Zilliax better is that it's a legendary so you can only have one copy of it but it's still an auto include in a lot of decks that don't even use the mech synergy.
---
It's an issue when a card is almost always good, and I think we should have more situational good cards. It's a taunt, it heals, it's a removal and it can also be a buff for mechs, it just does too much and it's too flexible which makes it almost always good. We've had a lot of cards like that recently, things like branching paths or shadow visions, cards with an insane flexibility that always provide at least one good option at any point in the game. But for me the worst of all is Fire fly. It's a neutral 1 drop that can also be used as a 2 drop, it's used in token decks, in most aggro decks, in elemental decks (shaman/mage), it's in most rogue decks, it's a great combo activator, it used to be the best card to complete the rogue quest, most odd decks use it, spiteful druid use it, it's the best card to upgrade the mage spellstone, and the list just goes on...
---
I'm okay with strong cards but it's dangerous to have too many strong neutral cards because it makes the game repetitive when every class has to use the same neutral cards. I think the best example of the risk is spiteful druid, you have a deck full of neutral minions and even if it's not the best deck in the game (it was almost the best at one point) it's still totally viable. It's difficult to find the right balance because if we have too many strong neutral cards, classes will lose their identity but if we get a few strong class cards, everyone is going to play the same classes which is also going to be repetitive and boring. But I don't think strong neutral cards are a such a good thing.
---
best Craft ever

One of the events was great to watch and I watched a lot and loved seeing soo finally take his win (poor serral though). One event was super boring and I had it on in the background and never really watched it and then turned it off. I'm happy that the money is in a game of skill and not the win-trading cheater game of randomness. 
---
Currently, my espionage/control rogue is the only fun deck left for me in the game. Really scared they won't add anything to keep control rogues going when vilespine and Valeera rotate..
---
Did you get shadowreaper anduin from KFT pack? If yes, go play intro for KFT singel player. You will get free random DK.
---
Choosing whether or not to attack even though he has rush? Why the fuck does everyone on hearthstone act like they're so smart and so good at the game that they've never had to use any skill whatsoever?
---
He did cheat this time, wintrading for higher HCT points so he got qualified
---
Thank god us Warrior chads still have [[Smoulderthorn Lancer]] 
---
We don not know an exact date yet, but based on previous years trend and speculations it will be in the start of April.  
---
Which also means that if you want to get packs from ungoro, frozen throne, kobolts and catacombs you will have to do it soon, at least if you plan on only spending gold on them
---
Zilliax also makes it pretty tough to print efficient mechs.

Not the worst deck if you can coin up a 10 10 on turn 3.

I certainly won't miss it, cheap "remove anything" just hinder bigger/more expensive minions from seeing play.

Seeing a lot of remarks and too few people saying actually thanks, thus thank you op!
---
I think you did a great job especially for noobs who don't know how the hall of fame rotation works.
---
Kripp has some great videos on YouTube for people new to arena. If you watch his stream you'll pick up good habits as well.
---
The problem with low-cost taunts is that if it's effective enough to reduce early-game aggression, it's also effective enough to protect an aggressive board. Tar creeper is the perfect example of that: a barely aggressive card with 1 attack, but perfect to protect your board since the opponent will most likely have to trade two of its minion on the bad boi.
---
To me, the only way to bypass this issue would be to print a new keyword similar to taunt, but that says "this minion protects your face but not your board". However, I think it would be very hard to balance such minions as to not completely shut off aggro. 
---
I am at last win for Rank 5 floor.
---
me evenlock vs hunter.
---
I keep spellbreaker for the obvious hyena.
---
Turn 3 he gets a nice hyena with diremole and one more beast on board.
---
I coin silence, thinking "nice, can relax for few turns"
---
Nope, has another hyena, makes it 6/4(using diremole and silenced hyena), also razormaws for more health.
---
I just play my drake as 4/7.
---
Plays flanking, timber wolf, kills drake using razormaw. Hyena is now 9/8. Hits face.
---
Just drop some 2 drops, had no other play.
---
Hit another razormaw on hyena, windfury with timbee wolf on board. Dead on turn 5.
---
That was just the LITERAL nuts and for my last win for rank5 as well. 
---
Alllrighty, time to do other things in life.

Zilliax can be also combo'd with Mechs. But it's not that powerful as Cube.
---
I agree that Elekk is a good card too, and maybe Untamed Beastmaster. BUT "I win the board or game because I'm able to use these 2 cards together" is horrible design.
---
Carnivorous Cube is definitely that.
---
From that perspective, I prefer Zilliax as versatile minion over a minion that's only purpose is to combo with another minion and nearly instantly win the board

Cafe Stella in Norfolk?
---
there still waa room for gradual nerfs. Cube could spawn each minion with 2 or 3 less attack or health. Or cube could make one real minion and one vanilla 5/5 token. There are ways
---
The magnetic mechanic in general makes it difficult to print powerful or at least offensively statted mechs.

I lost to a rogue deck that consisted of bran,some minion that makes a 1 mana 1/1 of a targeted minion and another one that kills a minion and adds his stats to ctun. I was playing big priest at the time and loved every moment of that game. I got hit by 60+ dmg from ctun anf it wad fucking epic
---
Not sure where the meme is, game just gave you a pretty solid card in Hemet.
---
Huh, didn’t think of that. That’s really nice of them. 
---
It's also proof that rush mechanic is stupid and needs an additional keyword to work. The more used rush minions are those with lifesteal, Divine shield or poison. One of the possible causes of Rastakan failure
---
&gt;How did the HS player base become so confused about wild?
---
Keeping cards around forever and keeping wild from getting completely out of hand are two separate things -- and again, team5 has been showing more interest than ever before in achieving this
---
I wish you could see all 3 options when they choose the wrong card so you could see how they messed up lol
---
I agree glimmerroot is a well-designed card , but slagging off zilliax as lazy garbage is clickbait. Balancing a legendary with so many key words is extremely difficult. If the stat or mana value of Zilliax had moved up or down, the card would most likely be broken or unplayed. As it stands as a 5 mana 3/2, Team 5 hit the sweet spot - not an easy thing to do and the antithesis of poor card design. Not to mention it creates interesting gameplay interactions and 'unity, precision, perfection' memes. 
---
SAVE for next expansion pls. Witchwood rotate in 2020. But next expansion in 2021
---
Indeed.
---
Nah, only odd Tempo.
---
What?
---
Why?
---
You're both wrong. It has nothing to do with beast combos, just the actual text format of the card.

yea, 1/1 voidlords and doomguards are not scary but 1/1 dino eggs or even mechano-eggs look stupid good. I wish cube was just pay the price to eat a minion with 2 vanilla 5/5s payoffs. Good value, nothing broken coming out of it tho
---
Zilliax is fucking sweet and is one of the best cards they've designed in a long while.
---
Powerful on it's own, yet has ridiculous potential when paired with certain other cards (cold blood, magnetizing a robosaur from the paladin egg).
---
&gt;It doesn't require any skill

No card requires skill by the way you phrase it

They really should have made it for three turns or something.

I feel like it would’ve been somewhat better if they just reduced his attack or something lol. Like make it 1 or 2. That way he’s not a strong minion on his own and it’s his deathrattle that people gotta rely on. It wouldn’t fix broke  combos but at least its something lol
---
Hah true. Still you got comment-baited ;)

Then average 6-8. Christ. Does it fucking matter? I infinite arena for fun on the weekends after work, I'm not here to wave a dick. "Just stop lying" -- How old are you, seriously.
---
Divine Hymn is pretty weak. Honestly goes to show my point given that it is the premier heal tech. Spirit Lash is only particularly effective when comboed with neutrals. It's wildly inconsistent.
---
What if it was 8 mana, build 2 beasts that cost 6 (only 3 drops in the pool) and summon them?
---
Oh, whoops. Guess I need to brush up on my WoW lore.

Yeah, that's what I meant.

---
I agree with you. It's absolutely unfair to compare them 1:1. 
---
For starters, Legacy is a competitive format. 
---
Or changed kingsbane to only keep damage buffs.  No one ever played envenom anyway.
---
This post is worth your read: https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/
---
&gt;just are mediocre
---
So their effect to mana cost ratio is bad because prep exists. 
---
No, it's enough. If the general power level of the game goes down in standard, kill anything for 4 mana is extremely efficient. Just not on the 10% autoinclude levels Vilespine was. 
---
Yes, but sometimes people also pick wrong on purpose because the correct card is useless and will clog up their hand.
---
shadowpriest tho, with no innate heal haha
---
Nah doesnt need a nerf, its not terroizing wild or anything, and deck as a whole isnt that common.  And besides you got a exreme highroll anyway/ Ive done it aswell with token druid for example. Most aggro decks can have a turn 3/4 win. It Doesnt need a nerf and its the main card that makes deck work anyway. 
---
What is smart about this card design is that it take advantage of the digital space to create something cool and skilltesting that could not be done in paper TCG. And what is deep is that it not only allow player to get an additionnal card when they know the meta in constructed, but also encourage people to play uncommon cards and decks to deny their opponent this extra card, I agree this is not enough to completely wrap the game by it's design, but a step in an interresting direction, at least in my oppinion.
---
Hemet is also one of my favorite design, actually I hesitated between the two but I find Glimroot to be more subtle.
---
I think C'Thun and by extension his support cards are probably the best 'designed' cards.
---
If you have a golden and non-golden, you get the value of golden + non-golden assuming the max playable copies are 2.  The gold is applied first and then the non-golden.   I assumed that it wasn't a Legendary but that would be the only way it is wrong.
---
*warsong crying in the corner*
---
It was a skillful card in arena but in constructed it was just “get a card from your opponents deck”
---
But Zilliax doesn’t need synergy cards, as a magnetic mech, he IS a synergy card. It’s like if terrorscale stalker fit into a bunch of non-deathrattle decks as a general well rounder, add a few eggs and think what he’s going to be.
---
Quest hunter?  Glad you took screen of him never seen anything Like that. 
---
What do you find "creative" in throwing down several keyword on a card and finding a good balance for cost and stats? Honest question.
---
Yeah I agree with this.
---
this is a repost and everyone said this last time (including me, check my comment history).
---
clearly it is time for standard to rotate when a mediocre screenshot like this gets reposted within two weeks.
---
But it’s not a big deal that they later change it to not work with some beasts , it’s just a quirk like how king of beast can’t be used.  
---
It’s way worst what they did to glen and Baku and people seem ok with that

Normally I would recommend Hemet but our deck is missing draw and we could really use a 2 drop. :)

---
I seem to remember people bringing up a Twitter post from a Dev where someone asked that before release and the dev said yes. Can't for my life find it though
---
Well, by THAT logic, everything that Blizzard has ever HoF'd is an unbalanced card. And I don't think that's the case.
---
Things mainly get retired because the company wants to keep things fresh - not necessarily because they are too powerful.
---
I think you forget that Rag and Sylv, as well as Azure Drake were all implemented in 2014 and then retired in 2017 - that's three YEARS of those cards. 
---
Ouchh that must hurt... I also came so close last week but I lost at 11 wins, with one loss being because of an afk due to real life distractions. But you'll get there eventually if you keep trying!!

While I use Zilliax because he's a strong card, I also don't think it's really as strong as people think. I'm NOT saying that it's a weak card by any means, but people keep bringing up magnetic, which was a massive failure since boomsday came out. It saw at for the first few weeks until people realized it didn't make the cut although, mech decks may see some play now that Genn and Baku are being hucked into the hall of fame. Maybe not, though, since the really competitive playable mechs are few and far between.

It's not overpowered by any means, because unless your opponent leaves it alone, which they won't, this card can't single handedly win games. It can turn a bad situation around, but it really only gets you into a clearing for a turn or two before a faster deck can get to it.
---
This card has never turned around a situation around for an opponent of mine. 
---
at least midrange hunter will see play diminish since paladin wrecks them
---
Fuck off this is a stupid post
---
Bruh#2
---
Curious : has this led to you actually getting the card? Even once? 
---
But it’s so satisfiyng 😢
---
It mostly applies to newer designs. If a new five cost legendary neutral minion has any chance to see play, it will need to do something better than what Zilliax currently does, and Zilliax does a lot as is. As such, it will most likely be stronger than Zilliax more often than not, and push the general power level of Standard up as a result.
---
All I know is if we finally get a Dalaran expansion and mage still can't break into tier 1 I'm gonna be pissed. 
---
I dont think its a priority item, we’re so close to rotation and a new set anyways that I don’t think its worth changing anymore cards until it happens and we can analyze data afterwards.
---
Well it is good that its a legendary so itobly takes up one spot. 
---
But still a disadvantage. 
---
ITS A PRETTY POOR COMPARISON AND LOADED IN SUCH A WAY THAT KARMA WHORING IS BLATANTLY OBVIOUS. 
---
It being legendary means many people don't own it and it's still in 1/3 of all decks played.
---
im saying that train of thought doesnt matter because thats how card games with an open pool are. the best cards will always get played the most
---
I'm currently at 560 wins, many of them containing 0 to 3 win runs (I kinda sucked at deckbuilding before I guess, even with the help of tier lists)
---
Hagatha's battlecry is like hands down my favorite line in the game tho
---
That's more of an issue with kidnapper being a shit card rather than vilespine being overly good.
---
Which one? The kitchen sink part is its card flavor. 
---
even deck  instead of 1 you have 0 mana  Kappa 
---
Spirit of the dragon is not being nerfed, it couldnt fit the odd decks and even mage doesnt exists. It still the same card as it was
---
You have no idea what I’m capable of!
---
I’m so sad I dusted her after Boomsday, I really hope they introduce some more burgle stuff in the upcoming expansions.
---
4 is max
---
Coin topdecked minstrel is better.
---
Not too long ago I drafted an arena deck with 7 of these. I really like the guessing game provided by the card and I pick it every time and that time I got really lucky
---
Zilliax is meant to be a spooky lil mech that functions well with the magnetize mechanic and general control deck. Glimroot is supposed to be a tricky lil guy that priest uses to find strong cards, fuel, and guess what deck he’s up against. 
---
Very different cards. Op knows this. Op wants attention. 
---
I mean he was OP.. but what an awesome card man. This thing made so many interesting decks.

This deck is surprisingly solid, it plays just like zoo but with super sticky minions and boards.  Let me know how it works for you!
---
Lately I’ve been playing with adding the spirit of the dead and bwonsamdi, I’ll let you know how it goes.
---
Yes. That is true, but I did admit that neutral taunts are a necessary evil and this is ultimately a minor issue, a side effect of popular designs.
---
"Baited" is why
---
Except it is not skilful, you just need meta game knowledge, there are a ton of cards that require more skill than this.
---
Hemet 10/10 times. Play him late game when topdecking and only draw your big stuff 
---
Very obvious derp
---
OK, it's time for Blood Manos post.

Yeah man, like nobody really expects Stonetusk boar in priest decks nowadays lmao.
---
Shows how messed up the esports scene is, how many other sports where you are proven to be a cheater to then go on and use that said cheating to progress enough to make it to the main tournaments associated with your said sport.
---
Yet again blizzard dropped the ball big time on this and should have dealt with it sooner, the fact he has been part of a team that cheated as well as cheated himself, seriously how can anyone respect the results of tournaments he is in.
---
Also topdecked prenerfed saronite was great
---
Why zili :((
---
What karma is ? And why you need it ? Still don't understand. 
---
Too many broken cards, not enough good.  Not saying game design is easy but there is way too much filler and useless stuff even a Timmy couldn't care less about, while way too many straight up broken cards.
---
Lmao one time I used polymorph and they got a 44 sheep. I conceded. Never played against quest rogue before that lmao 
---
Why is getting information about what your opponent thinks (thought) a bad thing?
---
This is an actual high-effort piece of original content though.  It's well-made.
---
When i play rogue, I'll miss it. The rest of the time, I'll be thrilled its gone.
---
This was probably a little top efficient for the cost tbh, and its a resouce that odd rogue really didnt need 
---
It's not generally played by odd rogue according to hsreplay.  The variations of odd rogue that do play it have wargear and amalgam, so they're playing it as part of a mech package.
---
And it is played in various tempo rogue decks, but I wouldn't call any deck that plays Lich King to be "agro".  That is also the only example of a midrange deck playing Zilliax without real synergies outside of Corpsetaker.
---
It’s my own version for Shirvallah OTK, many 1 cost spells and Geist. 
---
In my opinion it’s the fastest version vs control, but stands no chance against aggro, as it has little removal.
---
They've already played a 3 Mana 3/3 with no upside if they guess wrong. It's a sufficient drawback as is. The card already has a negative win rate with only a 0.5% inclusion rate (for reference, the most popular class card is another Priest one, Shadow Visions, at 16.8%).
---
Or play it out. After 2 losses I play risky and fast, I had a run go from 1-2 to 8-2 with a deck that wasn’t that great. Cheesing out the pack doesn’t get you better at arena which is really the only skillful part of this game, and even then the skill cap is lower. 
---
&gt;Let's be honest no card game is competing with HS right now
---
Isn't Magic the Gathering a competitor card game actually picking up some decent momentum?
---
Just checked on Twitch, and there are currently 21k viewers of Hearthstone and 8k viewers of Magic. That's a pretty significant fraction.
---
That explains it! Thx!
---
The reality is that the LoL playerbase was and still is absolutely massive. Yes, you and I might not know a lot of people that still play and the numbers have most likely gone down but that only means that the game is now closer to other competitors for first place.
---
It still has an absolutely massive following for a game that is 10 years old and probably a much healthier influx of new and returning players compared to other games of its age.
---
Wow, I haven't been watching for a years or so when Firebat was getting traction as a caster. I was sure he would be a staple by now.
---
Fortnite is so popular even players in the NBA and NHL have been known to get pretty addicted to it. 
---
If they actually made a comparison, fine, but they didnt. They just namedropped firefly
---
... and zilliax is in a ton of decks because it is a good healing neutral card. Like the naxx healing bot at a time. Doesn't mean it's op, could just mean we lack of diversity.
---
Espionage Rouge vs control warrior :/ not much I could do especialy he gained a lot armor Early game... 
---
&gt;surprisingly
---
tfw the biggest esport in the world continuing to be the biggest esport in the world is surprising
---
I’m still at rank 17 :( 
---
Hmmm.. well my apologies then. You truly deserve your PhD.
---
Yea this is why I replaced tracking with flare 
---
Disagree. The whole reason it hit the sweet spot is exactly why you’re wrong. It’s balanced, and powerful enough that even without synergies it gets included, while not being game breaking. 
---
jookie#11201 Asia 80 for 80 trade. You go first
---
Honestly espionage rouge is so fun. Especially the Tess version lol
---
You need to be careful right before an auto-retire because sometimes you won't be able to start another run.
---
Assuming you have a 50/50 chance of winning the next game, your betting a guaranteed 150 gold value arena ticket for the chance to get 30-50 extra gold? Doesn't seem worthwhile to me. 
---
Even if I were at 7+ wins on the eve of a new season, I'd probably stop if I can't start a new run. 
---
Area 52. A little area so popular it’s got a realm named after it. Can’t think of another place inside a zone that got that. 
---
it’s funny how you make it sound like they just slapped a bunch of keywords on it without any consideration. It’s a bit more than that and certainly not lazy. 
---
The thing about the brute force approach is that it doesn't require the designers to design a bunch of individually good cards for the archetype, just one really good one. This is why it's so attractive and why we see it still used in Hearthstone and in other TCGs. 
---
 Let's say you nerf Duskbreaker to 5 and make Temporus good. Now instead of the deck depending on 1 card to be a certain power level, it's depending on 2 cards. There are more knobs and dials to adjust and it makes it harder to balance correctly. 
---
There's also the fact that Blizzard doesn't usually print many class dragon synergy cards at a time. Some archetypes just don't get many cards printed; if the designers want to see those archetypes played, they have to crank up the power of the few cards they do print.
---
An aspect of design that wasn't mentioned when referring to powerhouses is how subjectively fun they are. Elise, Lich King, old gods, Sylvanis, and some of the deathknights were more tolerable because people loved playing with them. 
---
Powerhouses that were more vanilla face greater hatred. Such as Keleseth, kolbold librarian, all of the preist dragon cards, emerald spellstone, doctor boom, and call to arms. If you are going to make a powerhouse make it more interesting than just health and attack.
---
Damnit beat me to it. You gotta improve that title though by throwing shade at other people’s favorite cards
---
I remember your struggle. Once you get classic cards they last forever though(Until Blizz HoF's them)
---
There was an OTK deck around this and knife juggler but defile caps at 20 ticks 
---
&gt; I think The Lich King is more of what Zilliax wants to be. Still a very popular card, but not necessarily one you just always run
---
Zilliax is not a "must always run", though.  There were times when I cut it from my cube hunter as I had tar creepers to keep my health high, and it felt like a worse Flanking Strike.  I eventually added it back in, but it was right on the borderline of being in or out of the deck and a little meta dependent (I felt it was particularly bad against Odd Rogue since it's a 3/2 and dies to their dagger).
---
It's a "must run" in decks that have synergy, so like corpsetaker decks and mech decks.  For other decks it's a decent neutral taunt/lifegain, but just because a deck is slow doesn't mean it's an auto-include; the various OTK paladin decks tend to skip it for example.  I'm looking at a quest mage list without it.  Dragon control priest doesn't run it.  And so on.
---
"A neutral card with taunt is the most played card on HSReplay" is very often the case, whether that card is Tar Creeper, Stonehill Defender, Zilliax, Giggling Inventor, if memory serves there was even a brief moment when Lich King was the most included card.  Is this always a good thing?  No: Giggling inventor was a real problem card for example.  But there's nearly always a best neutral taunt, and it's nearly always played a lot.  4 of the top 6 cards right now are taunts (Ziliax, Tar Creeper, Stonehill Defender, Lich King).
---
Explain how daring fire eater is unplayable now. You get 3 damage instead of four, but that’s still pretty decent considering mage can target any minion. Also, this just means that janlai comes out later. It’s still an extremely powerful card, you just probably won’t be able to play it on curve. 
---
Don't conflate frustrating or overpowered instances of these kinds of mechanics with the entire mechanic itself. Card games have limited design space, and a lot of it is found in bending the conventional way things work.
---
There's nothing wrong with being able to trigger deathrattles without killing the minion as long as what you're doing doesn't become problematic for the meta or overly frustrating to play against.
---
Nope, and from what I understand he has even offered to cast for free before but has been turned down. He casts once and a while but  I don't think it happens very often.
---
I hope you won.
---
I think Zilliax was intended to help push the magnetic mech archetype. This failed because each mech class only got one good mech and the nuetral mechs we're too close to vanilla stats and effects.
---
It is but we are beyond card game vs card game.  It's a competition for time and frankly with so many games as a service style games these days there is only so much money and time to get from the players.  
---
Well they should print more decent fucking 5-drops then. Zilliax is immediately impactful. So was Azure Drake. Applebaum isn't immediately impactful and can be removed, Fungalmancer and Scalebane require you to have minions on-board. Go [here](https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/cards/neutral-minions-5-mana) and uncheck all the non-Standard card expansions. If you're playing control or are at all behind on board or whatever, how many of these cards will help you make a comeback? I'm not saying single-handedly win you the game or whatever, but at least help you stabilize.
---
Just imagine Zilliax wasn't in Standard. If you have no minions on the board, what 5-cost minions could really help you push for a comeback? Rotten Applebaum, probably Witchwood Grizzly. Maybe Dragonmaw Scorcher.
---
If people are avoiding a particular mana slot in terms of cards, that seems like a pretty big issue to me. Of course I could be entirely wrong in my interpretation; I don't play competitively by any stretch of the imagination, and that might be obvious. But this is just the way I'm seeing it. 
---
I try to avoid that shrine now. 
---
Its actually, probably, the 2nd or 3rd fun shrine to play... But they forced the new expansion cards as the priority draws in the buckets and it actually makes the shrine weak. 
---
Where is "thun choices? Where are the dragons? I get offered Murlocs dam near every win. 
---
Firefly is a good turn one open and maybe drop another on turn two, but you basically hold them until your ready to pull off a turn 6 or 7 Elemental combo....However, you'd have to hold them and prey on those turns your shrine is alive is bank off those combos. 
---
PS: They dont offer Hero cards anymore from what I understand (at least in Rumbles) because not all heroes have synergized effects with their new powers and shrines. 
---
I've asked so many times for them to update the buckets with more cards/choices and make the choices in each bucket balanced enough so its better, but nothing. 
---
Vilespine and Fal'dorei Strider are 10/10 cards that I'll miss so goddamn much.
---
So you don't want us to recommend you a meta deck, but yet you'd prefer if it's a good competitive deck?  Here's a list of good decks:  https://hsreplay.net/meta/  Decide which one is your desire level of power.  
---
Same, Cutlass rogue is really fun (and gets absurd pretty fast when you play against thief priest).

---
speaking of poor card design, how call all three be beasts if you only discover one?
---
Hearthstone replay has it in 21.1% of decks, and if you are at high wins the chances will be higher 
---
I actually am 15 and offended:(
---
Yeap
---
Whatever floats your boat I guess.  But there's 30+ decks in that list, you should be able to find something that looks fun.
---
Who cares about the long term health of the game as long as we don't have to give dust out and slightly lose profit right now!?   
---
  
---
Seriously I wonder how many players have quit the game out of frustration because they're so desperate not to give out dust. 
---
The value of it being one card is outweighed by the fact it's 7 mana do nothing this turn in a class that relies on tempo and has little in ways to heal. It's not as overcosted as some of the other Rogue cards, but sprint almost always relies on prep to be able to play.
---
Tyler screwed me on my main, had Bunny and Bloodyface on my alts, so its not all bad.

---
The classic/basic set is problematic in general. 
---
Blizz needs to take a page from MTG book and have a different base set for every year. 
---
Considering how long we've been saying that Hunter needs some kind of draw, a bit better AI w/ a deck restriction sounds fine.  And for a top meta deck, midrange hunter is that minion based incremental value deck that everyone seems to want for top meta.
---
I would try to argue with you that Hearthstone is not a money vacuum, you don't need to spend anything to keep up in Standard reasonably even with the early rotation of Genn and Baku, and the new solo content is being sold at the price of the rewards within it and there's no reason to buy it if you're not interested in the content itself. 
---
However, you're obviously not in the right mindset to let yourself be convinced of anything.
---
master's call is great.
---
1) deckbuilding restriction: u must not include any non-beast minions.
---
2) disruption: if your opponent is able to shuffle non-beast minions into your deck, this card is greatly weakened.
---
Im not following the competitive scene anymore but pretty sure I picked bunny just because of the name since I didnt even know anyone else. Was a good bet ;)
---
Of course against an odd paly too - bad luck. 
---
Master's Call and Book of Spectres are examples of cards that really strongly push an archetype, but for a price. And I think I'm okay with that. 
---
Master's Call means you can't run Untamed Beastmaster or Houndmaster, or even Houndmaster Shaw.
---
Book of Spectres means you can't run... well, Spells. Like Frostbolt, Fireball, or Polymorph.
---
I prefer these cards compared to Arcanologist or Duskbreaker: minions who are just straight-up amazing and make you *want* to play whatever they synergise with. With Master's Call and Book of Spectres, or Small-Time Recruits as another example, they are cards that require the cards they synergise with (what they draw) to be good.
---
This is why Small-Time Recruits wasn't successful, but Master's Call is. Because there are lots of good Beasts that Hunter can run, but Small-Time Recruits can only net you 1-drops, which aren't *so* desirable.
---
With that said, cards with powerful effects that require that you sacrifice something tend not to be too interesting. Once they are "figured out" and their power level is revealed to us, the question isn't about the risks and the effect and the synergies, it's just a simple "yes" or "no" to if it's worth it. And that does risk making them pretty bland.
---
*However,* it is also a way for Midrange Hunter to reload itself in a cool way, and centralises the Beast archetype. It is a playstyle from Hunter that we haven't seen so much of before, because reloading is something Hunter has historically been pretty awful at.
---
Same for Book of Spectres and how that facilitates Mountain Giants or Archmage Arugal. And how Mage leans less on their reputedly powerful spells and more on minion synergies like Elementals.
---
It's an interesting discussion to be sure. It's not like Master's Call is the only good Beast-synergy card in the deck (Scavenging Hyena, Crackling Razormaw, Tundra Rhino), and it's not like it's without a price (Houndmaster and Houndmaster Shaw), but it is clearly worth its current cost of sacrificing those cards so this can be included.
---
The average player often pick the greedier cards. At high wins you only end up seeing fanatic in decks that either has enough control tools or enough taunts and rushes to benefit from the delayed buff.
---
I made a video here talking about the card. It's blatantly overrated by many players but they often will pick it again because they don't see why a 2/3 on turn 4 is horrible. 
---
Deathrattles inside deathrattles inside deathrattles inside deathrattles are completely unfair and broken against control decks. It basically renders them useless because it creates 100% unclearable boards. So the game purely becomes aggro vs combo, killing off one of the major deck archetypes. If you can't see why that's terrible design then there's something wrong with you. 
---
Thats not what I'm saying, but you just added to the side, that means theres only a 21% of pyroblast being in a mages deck, and out of thirty cards, theres probably gonna only be 1 pyroblast (2 would be pushing it and very high ended). So you have a 1/30 chance to pull out Pyroblast from the pool of 3 random cards generated, 1 must be in their deck.
---
Way too low of a chance to be relevant, even if you repeat this for a multitude of deck defining cards
---
They're supposed to be relatively equal in power... Why do these posts get upvoted?
---
I love my thief rogue deck. It's definitely more fun than and meta rogue decks *cough* odd *cough*. I haven't played rogue since the cold blood nerf, but when I want to play for fun, I def pick up thief rogue over anything else.

---
It is a Swiss Army knife that does things better than every other card, but then again. It is the only real neutral booms day (besides mecha) that is played at all, so. Meh
---
I play for fun. I also have an otk hunter with angry chickens
---
Mostly I hate aggro because you don't need the entire deck to win. I will admit I've been on an OTK kick lately, mostly mecha'thun and holy wrath paladin, but before the era of OTK I was largely a control player. For me, the deckbuilding comes from selecting 30 cards with the intent to play ALL of them and reap ALL their value. Aggro doesn't do that. It's just "include a bunch of cheap fast threats". While the decision of contesting board vs going face is in there as you mention, the deckbuilding itself is quite bland, yet it is incredibly aggravating to constantly play against aggro deck after aggro deck, and never be able to do the cool things you built your deck to do because you're dead on turn 5.
---
Truth be told, my favorite decks, while hardly ever anywhere near the top of the meta, are infinite *value* decks. Not so much infinite for the OTK, but ways you can constantly generate value each turn without having to give up cards. Back in the day, I played this deck I concocted myself called [Swarm Host](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqAaZks-8xo), which was a combo of [[Hogger]] and [[Master of Disguise]] (back then it granted permastealth) to generate infinite taunt that couldn't be removed (the only way it could die was to Flamestrike or an errant Ragnaros hit). I loved Grinder Mage back when that was a thing as well. Nowadays, it's a Priest deck that uses the Dragon Soul weapon and a combo of Test Subject -&gt; Seance -&gt; Binding Heal x2 -&gt; Regeneration x2 -&gt; Topsy Turvy (repeat all that a second time) to heal your face for 20 and generate 4 5/5 dragons each turn.
---
Side note: I hate playing discolock for the same reason, even in the face of the Warlock quest being that infinite value generator that I love so much. What is the point of having a card in your deck if your intention is to just discard it? Thankfully, discolock isn't nearly as oppressive, and I can counterplay it with many lategame threats, infinite combos, and OTKs, so it doesn't stick in my head nearly as much as aggro. But I almost always reroll a discard quest because I hate the idea of a card's value being nullified by the effect.
---
Cheers bloodyface, easy money.
---
I love picking this card in arena, the only time I got did dirty was when the correct choice was breath of sindragosa against blast wave and flamestrike.
---
So many people in this post are saying that zilliax is too powerful because it is played in too many decks. Let's look at what other 5 mana taunts we can play.
---
Earth elemental, voodoo hexxer, tar lurker didnt see play before zilliax. Druid of the claw was only played in spiteful druid because druid had too many other defensive options. Witchwood grizzly was played TOGETHER with zilliax in deathrattle hunter, wall/resurrect priest, direhorn hatchling is played with zilliax in odd/taunt warrior. The only other taunt(not counting pre-nerf giggling inventor which was obviously op) that saw play and fell out of favor because of zilliax was applebaum.

---
With quest and everything I have enough gold because my packs are usually either deuces down to 60 gold or free from arena. And better yet, I don’t have to play against boring unoriginal garbage every game because I’m constructed nobody plays anything they make. 
---
I never got this whole don’t finish the run tactic. You’re spending time just trying to get an extra pack. Spend the gold and learn arena. I have about 9k gold now? I’m fairly close to having a complete non golden collection. I mainly play at lunch and during League of Legends or Counter-Strike queues and maybe some before bed. I don’t play ranked in any form because I don’t believe a casual game should have a ranked queue/ladder so most of my cards come from arena entirely. 
---
It’s a way better game mode, and it rewards you for doing well. My advice is completely against your original post. Don’t tick runs over. If the deck is super bad retire it. I’ve retired a 1-2 to just save time when I completely butchered my draft. I’d rather do that and get a real run going than ever let a run tick over for a free ticket. 150 gold isn’t that much anyways. 
---
And in the same thread people shitting on it lmao
---
fun and interactive! /s
---
That is truly garbage card design. Is this a joke thread? 
---
Probably just a mental ‘quick math’ error. It’s real easy to go ‘and the last two attack each other’ and accidentally skip that it means there’s actually 2 attacks there. 
---
If you assume that Zilliax or Healbot were killed by a small removal spell (e.g. Frostbolt) then they look remarkably similar to me.
---
Heal for 8.
---
or
---
Heal for 3 and remove a minion.
---
Why would you use 2k dollars on Hearthstone?
---
?
---
I'm guessing your win condition is the turn 50 timer?
---
100% agree. Although I'd argue Zilliax is not only beautifully designed (seems like just a bunch of keywords but the numbers are so beautifully balanced for that combo of keywords) but also an incredibly healthy card for the game. I think Hearthstone needs a few staple cards that aren't op, just flexible. I think the Lich King (while I...I love him) was a bit too op and slightly lazy design with just an 8 mana 8/8 taunt bomb that always gives a card that most of the time is insanely powerful. But anyway, Glimmerroot has always been in my top 3 cards from Ungoro and sadly overlooked these days. (Although was popular in pre nerf Raza Priest, and still popular in Wild Reno Priest (although the least popular of the Reno decks).
---
I’m sorry but what are you talking about? They print a few warlock beasts and now suddenly they’re beast based? 
---
The beast tags on the minions are irrelevant, they just fit the expansion theme. They’re not looking for you to make warlock synergies around beasts lol. And there is still plenty of demon synergy stuff coming out so I’m not sure what to tell you. 
---
I'm going to disagree. If Hemet was used in a tier 1 deck no one would like him. All the strategy is done before the game. And that is only done by the guy who made the deck. Once in game, you always know you when and how you want to play it.  And the game hinges on weather or not you draw it by T6 or not. If you do you get better draws. If not you have to deal with a bunch of weak minnions in your deck. 
---
Unpopular opinion: I hate 1 drops. Go first, play a 1 drop, and you've boosted your win rate exponentially.
---
Guys I'm not saying every card they print should be like zilliax, and I'm not saying you have to be a supergenius to play it. I'm just recognizing a difference between a card like zilliax and cards like Genn/Baku and keleseth. There are lots of other cards with good design, but I'm not talking about them because they generally dont see as much play (ie curious glimmerroot)
---
Unless I'm misreading, the top matches seem a little too coincidental: what the odds two different games both peaked at exactly 74,363 viewers? Is there some significance to that value? (Like if they were both exactly 65,535 I'd think it was some integer or overflow type of error)
---
10pm EST start? Oh well
---
and there I was thinking someone actually played Bright-Eyed Scout
---
I don’t get it
---
I see this is blowing up as a response to my post and I think people are taking it out of context. This is why I commented on my own post:
---
&gt;now a days
---
These are some good finds. Interestingly enough, the Magic of Dalaran cardback shares a similar design of star with the background artwork we see in the images for the "choose your starting deck" screens that were revealed with the pve content info.

Upper ranks have so little population that you can near guarantee running into the same person by queuing at the same time.
---
And Blizzard never implemented anything to prevent you from being matched up against the same person in back to back games.
---
Now everyone can technically be an infinite arena player
---
Exactly! My post about zilliax wasn't saying it's "the pinnacle of card design". I think curious glimmerroot is a good design too, but I was talking about zilliax in the context of being very strong as well.
---
I feel like this sums up the polarizing opinion of the front page right now haha 
---
OMG, I actually got the top result for once by picking BunnyHopper solely because I liked his screen name. :)
---
Not sure how true that is to be honest. For some 1-drops like Old Mana Wyrm, or Northshire Cleric, I can see this being the case.
---
But how good having a Dire Mole out on Turn 1 is for your winrate... I mean, it's an increase to be sure (otherwise why run Dire Mole?), but I'm not convinced it is *that* much of an increase. Unfortunately I don't have premium HSReplay to check out how much your winrate goes up by having played a 1-drop on Turn 1.
---
Considering Keleseth was surprisingly *not* such a blow-out-the-water card, I'm going to guess a 1-drop is going to have notably less impact than you believe it does.
---
Though I will say that certain combinations make 1-drops far, *far* more dangerous. Dire Mole into Crackling Razormaw. Argent Squire and Cold Blood. Etc.
---
I like to jerk myself thank you very much
---
You do know that only the cards that go to the HoF give you full dust refunds and that all the other cards that rotate to Wild give you no refund other than their normal dust value right? New players DO NOT DO THIS
---
Excuse my ignorance but how exactly does win trading work?
---
If legend #10 and legend #11 play each other and one throws the game isn't there a good chance they'll be matched against other opponents?  Or what if they time their ques they fight each other again and one of them just keeps conceding to the other?  I don't care to win trade or know anyone to trade with, just out of the loop here.
---
It sounds like you started dating my ex best friend lol y'all ain't just get married right?

Hasn't he begun streaming now? You could check his stream then.
---
I think the top thread is a bit heavy-handed in its description, but I also think the general sentiment is a lot more measured than that.
---
I also think it's possible to enjoy and appreciate Zilliax for its power and how its popularity belies how fun it is to play against, while still recognising that its "design" is dangerous, especially when not properly moderated.

#CITIZENS OF DALARAN

say that to sniperinno kripperino

Kinda seems like Zill is broken, but anything that doesn't kill you or immediately stop you from killing the opponent doesn't feel broken and people don't rage at much. 
---
MeddlingMage#2695 NA, 80g quest trade. You go first.
---
Good thing this is rotating out. I love to see all the ungoro cards leave. Makes me wonder what neutral 1 drop every class is gonna use now
---
SECRET AGENT, COMING THROUGH!
---
yeah more midrange pirates.  more aggro pirates will not be good for wild
---
I’M JUST A MEAN GREEN MOTHER FROM UN’GORO, AND IM BAD!
---
Usually ovepowered cards are ones you have no answer to or can't tech anything to counter them. I would say that Vilespine was pretty much that. Not that overpowered cards are really rare in hs but it's hard to see Vilespine as anything different than one of the best cards in the game.  
---
Also, let's give it a keyboard, like Rush, but I want it to be able to hit face.  How about: 
---
Rush
---
This unit can hit face the turn it is summoned.
---
We don't have it yet! 
---
Lol!
---
&gt;  But still, Lackey's power level to me seems completely reasonable. 
---
And this is what I have to disagree with completely. Voidlord is a pretty bad card imo playing it for its cost but pseudo-drawing it then putting it into play on turn 7 while healing for 4 is very unfair vs. aggro saying to them you gotta kill me before turn 7 hits. The same kinda follows for Doomguard vs control, a 5/7 with rush is already being played and it comes with taunt, replacing that with charge is an incredible tempo gain and both these minions come with the inevitability that they will be rezzed with guldan locking out the game even further or simply just OTK'ing you. I think the requirement is negligible since they gave warlock 4 great targets in their deck to combo with. 
---
But yes I do agree that Skull is the sole ruler of the deck and it needs other things to be good, but I would if they wouldn't just print obviously good cards that combo insanely well with one another in one set. An example is Captain Hooktusk and Raiding Party. Hooktusk wants you play decently statted minions but those minions aren't the type you want to draw b/c they make her bad later on (and those minions are pretty bad on their own) so her and Raiding Party don't seem to fit in the same deck b/c you don't really want to draw those other bad cards. Stuff  like this is what I want to see.
---
Sigh....
---
Chillwind Yeti is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at 4 mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a pile of stats to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 4/5 can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the CY is just so positive. It comes on the board like "grawl" and I'm like "yeah CH i do want to growl let's do this shit" and when he attacks he's like "ROAR!" and I'm like "yeah roaring is fun." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "nah ROAR!." And it looks so happy. I mean this is a snow monster literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. [I mean look at his face he's just so happy.](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/330/210/31.png)
---
I am literally never sad when chillwind yeti is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card.
---
I like the idea of the champion getting one more pack than the runner-up. Intuitively, it feels to me that picking the winner should reward more than the runner up rather than equal. Not that I’m complaining about free packs, of course. 
---
Who knows - I think you might be right, but at the same time, that's how MTG runs a lot of their Pro Tours. The tours are often run early in new metas, so players get a chance to see new stuff in action.
---
But maybe I'm being hopeful, I also don't want to wait until May for cards.
---
Wow golden yetis? P2W scum
---
I could not see that in that video.  And also it’s not like blizzard would ever do any action based on 1 game.  Unless he has a pattern of behavior to indicate wintrading consistently nothing will be done.  It’s not like blizzard does anything about the guys who’s accounts are being played 24/7 obviously being controlled by multiple people
---
It doesn't make complete sense to me either but Blizz is giving the free packs so they make the rules.
---
Thanks mate! Reminders are always good!
---
Remember when Ungoro was just a week or so away, and suddenly this Dinosaur came outta nowhere(he had multiple adapts), and threw the meta slightly for a loop?
---
We need **that**.
---
If this is a joke thread I'm not sure I get the joke.
---
If this is a serious thread, know that "Balanced" doesn't mean "Not overpowered".
---
This card sees no play because it's *not* balanced.
---
It makes sense when you consider that Easter falls on April 21st this year and maybe vacations/time off are impacting their availability during those two weeks.
---
How exactly is this Lethal ? I dont see it. 
---
TL:DR OP was like, I want fair strong and fun cards and less OP one that need to be nerfed. Then everyones like GLIMMERROOT IS THE BEST CARD EVER DESIGNED! and Excuse me, there are there are other types of strong neutral cards that are healthier for the meta.
---
IMO:Dude in danger on the front page is best card.  
---
Don't spend that gold!  You are going to want options to buy the new set in April.  Get your first legendary in 10 packs.  After that spend your Hall of Fame dust to craft missing cards you need.
---
If you are missing any HoF cards craft golden copies and gain extra dust when you disenchant those said golden cards for an extra 25 percent free dust.  
---
People who get butthurt in casual...
---
Why are you so insecure? It's casual? I played odd paladin in casual today, I destroyed my opponent who was playing Control Priest. Am I crying they played control priest against my tier 1 deck in casual? No. Because I just wanted to complete my quest quickly, and didn't want to play odd paladin in ranked because I think the meta right now is unfavourable.
---
Cry me a river. It's casual. If it pisses you off, concede and move on. That's the beauty of casual. It literally means nothing.
---
Deep sigh...
---
Firefly is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at one mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you  another 1/2 to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 1/2 can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than the FF is just so positive. It comes on the board like "Fwhoosh!" and I'm like "yeah FF let's woosh" and when he attacks he's like "Fwuhhh!" and I'm like "yeah they are SO Fwuhh!" He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "nah fhwuush." And it looks so happy. I mean this is an inanimate insect literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. [I mean look at his face he's just so happy.](https://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/avatars/335/100/55466.png)
---
I am literally never sad when Firefly is on board. IDK if he's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty chill card
---
How the hell does saying ThatsAdmirable bit about free stamps for ice cream evolve into this.
---
Vilespine Slayer?
---
English bro
---
Not sure why you think Fire Fly is better designed than the other offenders like Zilliax and Sludge Belcher. You can fit it into almost deck that isn't hard control. 
---
I think a 1/2 “add a 1/1 mech to your hand with magnetic” would be good
---
Alley Cat was a really good 1-drop, too. Always felt fine, just a nice, solid drop.
---
summon al' alkir 
---
And then they have some broken board clear cards. 
---
I love this card, especially in arena. It gives me insight into what kind of deck they drafted or their mindset. Example: a person chose holy smite over squashlings and baffled me
---
&gt;When a tribal synergy card is sees heavy play without any additional support, that's a red flag.
---
Fire Fly sees play in mostly non-Elemental themed decks. But Fire Fly is a great designed card? 
---
What cards are going to be switched to wild? Can someone please link me a list? 
---
Love this card, works so well with my sac pack 😍
---
&gt; This is the point right before the rotation where everyone decides to jerk off all of the ridiculously powerful cards by calling them “well-designed”.
---
Well-designed cards are allowed to be rotated, you know. It doesn't matter how well-designed a card is. If it sees play, it's going to get boring after long enough.
---
&gt; Cards like Fire Fly, Keleseth, Tar Creeper, Azure Drake, Stonehill, Chain Gang, prenerf Bonemare, and yes, Zilliax, that are just so much better than other options in their mana slot lead to a more boring game, where 35% of decks are running the exact same 10 card neutral package.
---
You really, *really* shouldn't be lumping all of those cards together.
---
Keleseth is polarising based on draw. That's already bad.
---
Azure Drake was extremely versatile, where sometimes the Dragon Tribal or Spell Damage mattered. It wasn't broken, but it was too versatile making it too ubiquitous, so its rotation out was healthy. I have no problem with Azure Drake's design, nor do I have a problem with its rotation.
---
Saronite Chain Gang following its nerf sees play in 5.5% of decks. That's healthy.
---
I'll give you Tar Creeper.
---
Stonehill Defender, while as popular/strong as Tar Creeper (21.4% to Stonehill compared to 23.8% to Tar Creeper) is a lot less boring, because it utilises the Discover effect and has a degree of variance to it. Not only this, but Stonehill power relies also on other cards in the rotation. Stonehill in Odd Paladin is largely so appealing thanks to the amazing class Taunts that Paladin has (Righteous Protector, Tarim, Tirion).
---
I'll give you pre-nerf Bonemare.
---
I'll give you Zilliax on account of just being *that good,* but boring? Eh. Zilliax is fine in its current state, I am just concerned about it next rotation.
---
Now... Fire Fly.
---
Fire Fly is better than any one of those by design. Better than Zilliax because, unlike Zilliax, there are different reasons you may play Fire Fly. Fire Fly can be useful for Tokens for Odd Paladin, it can be useful for Combo activations for Rogue, it can be useful for Elemental synergy in Shaman (or Mage), and it can be useful for hand size retention in (Book of Spectres) Mage as well.
---
There are a ton of decks running Zilliax that don't care about the Mech or Magnetic, only the rest of the card. And Zilliax is by far the most popular card in the game as it stands.
---
Point being, Fire Fly was good for synergy, not just good by itself. It was decent by itself, but its popularity is not just because it's "technically" a 2 Mana 2/4.
---
&gt; It’s possible to like a card’s flavor or enjoy playinga specific card while still conceding that it was probably a little overtuned.
---
I wouldn't change Fire Fly at all. With Zilliax, the only "satisfying" nerf is making it cost (1) more Mana, but that's a *big* nerf that doesn't need to happen right now, because Zilliax feels A-okay to play against.
---
I'll piggyback on this seeing as how the comment was deleted, but I want other people to read this to have a better understanding.
---
If like that person said, we should respect someone trying to complete a quest, then I would like all my opponents to just concede against me as I am trying to complete my own quest as quickly as possible. I don't want to play odd pally in casual, but I really wanna get my win 1 paladin game quest complete ASAP. So please, from now on, if you see me running Odd Pally in casual, just surrender and respect that I am trying to complete a quest. /s
---
See. this is why this mentality is really... dumb.
---
It's casual. People can/will play whatever they want, and you know what. That's just casual. Deal with it or go find another game if you are too sensitive.
---
My elemental Mage will miss you deeply
---

---
Millhouse + Cryostasis gets close, but it will never fill the hole it left in my heart when it left standard.
---
For once I agree with OP. Well said.
---
I was referencing the Modern format due to how it went from being just another format to being an important format that players need to master if they intend to compete on an international level. 
---
The Wild format will most likely be incorporated in Hearthstone tournaments when its meta game differs exponentially from that of Standard both in terms of power and style.
---
I agree, though people did take issue with it because it was very difficult to fully remove in time for Crackling Razormaw to drop down.
---
mikemage#2310 EU, 80g quest trade, I'll show and you go first.
---
They do fix these, either by giving a coin or reducing mana cost. There is one with Equality still at 2.
---
Only when it goes face though! SMOrc
---
That's weird. They said all the cards in these puzzles were snapshot-ed so so they wouldn't change with card changes. 
---
This, having strong neutral cards dilutes the identity of decks, and in turn cause all games to play out the same way.  You can have strong neutral cards, but have them be more niche that fit in very precise deck archetypes., ones that showcase the strength of class identities not overwhelm them.
---
It also allowed for smoothing out curves for odd decks.  And gave many decks a 1-drop that was better than passing the turn, but had more value than the average 1 drop.  It also gave cheap bodies for Funglemancer.  It also provided Flame Elementals as a quest completion option for some quest rogues.  It also gave big spell mages flexibility to combine with their pings in early turns to remove key targets.  It also provided token druid with cheap minions to setup Savage Roar and buffs.  It also provided Shaman to setup Bloodlust turns cheaply and Hagatha/Shudderwock value (on top of the aforementioned elemental activator).  It provided paladins with cheap buff targets.
---
It was extremely versatile.
