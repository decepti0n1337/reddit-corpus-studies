If you run into a lot of decks with weapons, run weapon removal. That’s the idea of a tech card, you only really should play them if you specifically will benefit.

Bad bot

I always hated those MEP guys and their fancy mafs….:))

He does. Don't be afraid to play him either. Millhouse Manastorm warns you against playing him if you draw him, but she doesn't have any spells to work with it.
---
makes sense, do you think i should remove the ooze and just run harrison? im just worried i will get weapon destroy too infrequently with just 1 minion with it. thanks

The issue is that he hero powers at the end of his turn and can bully the weak minions on the right side of your board and steal your good minion still.

I'm in on the meme but I think bots like these should never be called bad bots. I've never personally known someone to commit suicide but if any of my friends or close family would do it I'd be devestated beyond belief. Bots like these may save someone on the fringe and should always be applauded no matter the context.
---
I don't think that's going to go all that well.
---
N'Zoth is the safe pick, but I'd be romantic and ask Lord J to the prom.
---
What they need to do is make the decks better, or even better, let us make our own 10 card decks we can use, then we can get buckets as it is now.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Nothing shittier than using a deck with fucking togwaggle's scheme and daring escape or other weakass cards that have extremely weak synergy (and then not even getting the synergy buckets) and getting runover on run #1 or 2 of heroic.
---
Around 70, too much, renolock
---
I'm a casual and 15 WINS is too much. I could maybe keep that up for a month before I got burned out on my decks. That being said I couldn't care less about single player content. Never really did like single player games
---
I think that just Harrison is most likely fine, however if you are worried about weapons then running both isn’t necessarily a bad idea either. It really comes down to personal preference. Would you rather have 1 card that will help you once in a while when you have it and the right opponent, or almost always have a tech card, but it ends up being two dead cards in your deck with the wrong matchup?
---
Personally I think you’ll be fine just running Harrison, so give it a shot and see how it feels over 10-20 games. You can always add the ooze back in.
---
I know this is a bit of a meme, but if you played the more common version in the last standard rotation, the nerf means another deck you might have played and loved is no longer playing the same in Wild. 
---
More time goes by... the more I wonder... What's the point of Wild? Feels like a significant chunk of decks never get to Wild unmolested. They have this fancy HOF mechanic, but then they arbitrarily decide to nerf certain cards instead.
---
It's a single classic pack don't fret
---
She doesnt concede off of 2, she has an emote instead.
---
Giantslock utilizes that combo the best. A decks wr doesn’t mean it’s toxic... it’s how the metas forced to react to it. Like the gadgetzan pirate decks were toxic even though their winrates were close to 50% because of how they polarized the meta. It’s rare even a deck to get a ridiculously high winrate with a high play rate because hs by design has an adaptable meta so op strategies are countered by metas full of hit decks meant to beat it. That doesn’t mean that type of polarization is good for the game.
---
To my knowledge, hearthstone operates on two levels: first, a check if a spell can be cast, and second the actual casting. 
---
So in this case, dire frenzy can be cast on leok, so it passes the first check. Then, it applies the spell (+3/+3 + shuffle) on leok, which triggers djinni's abilities, so then djinni casts the spell (it does not recheck the condition). 
---
That's why if you cast backstab on a minion and then something copies it (say that one shrine in rumble run), it will deal 4, even though its not "undamaged" after the first one. Similarly eviscerate will also deal 4, as the combo check doesn't trigger the first time, so it won't trigger in the copy.
---
Twitch.tv/gravyllama
---
The spell requires that you **target** a beast, however Djinni bypasses the need to target with its card text, defaulting to itself.
---
My mistake! I’m thinking of the new one.

It'd be insane if buffed cards got their full dust available considering the sheer amount of legendaries that are getting buffed. Then again, I can think of worse things to happen. I'd love it if they did such a thing.

A lot, more than I care to disclose, and my alltime favorite deck is Secret Mage.

Battle Cry:  draw 2 cards.

Deathrattle: discard 2 cards.

My uneducated opinion is that it has its place with the challenges it brings, but definitely find it not as fun. Maybe it's the OCD in me, but the carts make everything feel clustered and uneven.

Wich causes a sense of futulity bc your is deck is made by rng and sometimes (8 out of 10 for me) theres nothing you can do agaisnt him.

I really should have caught that considering that the screenshot shows three fireballs and a power word glory in hand. It doesn't make a huge difference since the discount anomaly makes it easy to dump extra cards and my final number is a "probably accurate to the nearest order of magnitude" kind of answer already.

Hearthstone stores values in 32-bit signed integers. That makes the max value for things like attack and health 2,147,483,647. When you pinged it that final time it caused an overflow and the game loops it right around back to 0.

Yeah I feel the same of 2 or 3. Though tbh I feel like most often the one on chapter 2 doesn't make much difference, I feel like you still play the same as normal except occasionally get an impactful prisoner.

Yes, the card itself is castable, but it will have no effect.

I'd say the previous ones were at least somewhat interesting or funny in a way - the others weren't made with the purpose of why everyone posted those, they were some sort of combos. But this is literally what the treasure is *supposed* to do, nothing interesting about that.

It won’t hit anything because they are dormant

But its mine and i feel entitled to share it with all

Every "adventurer" boss can be in every chapter. Because lorewise, they are just world of warcraft players that get in your way.
---
Imagine if THAT was consistent. It would be even worse than Nagalock. Btw Big Priest is also not consistent, but people hate it passionately, because it creates non-interactive gameplay just like this BS in the video.
---
Thats not inconsistent, thats perfectly right.
---
Look at [[Cleace]].  The "three cards" should not be the Eyecatcher. The important thing is if the opponent play 3 cards the interaction will trigger.

Yes, they’re replacing the HOFed cards in an upcoming patch. The plan was to add them before the next set, so in patch 14.4 (the rise of mech patch) or 14.6 (the set 15 pre-order patch).

OP in previous comments before ROS stated they were playing odd paladin deck for reference and this is a new account post-ROS.
---
I beat it on my first try with the mage power that reduces a card in your hand by 2, later in the wing i got the hero power costs zero and can be used twice passive, then pulled fat legends like lich king, didn't sweat it once honestly
---
&gt; since odd warrior is gone
---
Baku wasn't deleted, it was rotated.
---
I'd say big priest is more consistent than this deck. You have ways to tutor the things you want.  I don't think this will be above a tier 3 deck for that reason. Unless a cheap spell comes out to tutor minions you want for mage. Iv been playing this deck all week, it's unreliable and I'm not a fan. Nobody needs to worry about it being oppressive.
---
They shouldn’t have nerfed prep. But gotta weaken the classic set so people buy more packs, I guess.
---

---
Quality post.
---
Velen doesn't actually affect Unexpected Results, because he doesn't give Spell Damage. The fact that it show it on the card is a bug, that's why you summon 2-drops in this case.
---
However, if you had 30 Spell Damage (possible through the use of Velen's Chosen), you would summon nothing.
---
Probably just the golden candle
---
Really? I had a hunter deck with lots of swarming cards and it went just fine for me.
---
Thanks for clearing that up, i wasn't aware. Appreciate it!
---
You can add windfury to minions through other cards
---
Tried this combo, got Valeera’s hero power every game apart from 1, feels bad man
---
Stage III Heroic has been beating my ass. Its honestly a really nice change of pace from past heroic content.
---
I think that the best is jaraxxus, everyturn you do a lol of value with the 6/6 demons
---
This is intentional because if you glance at the card you might see 3 and think that's the amount you will draw.
---
It keeps putting dr boom in the tiny hunter bucket too.
---
Is this whole comment addressed toward me? I'm not longing for a return to earlier days, I was just reminiscing. I'm more or less fine with the RNG that's in the game now, as it's an intended design goal.
---
And Kingsbane the year before that.
---
Also, Prep would get nerfed or HoF'd sooner or later. Better to do it now and open up design space (like it or not, it's a valid reason) for upcoming spells than do it later.
---
*G L U E A D V E N T U R E*
---
Yeah I agree. It has been really hard having a tier 1 or tier 2 deck every expansion
---
My very first heroic run , i used rogue wih rush + armor when minions die.
---
Went for a kingsbane deck with a fatigue option using coldlight oracles and re shuffle.
---
Traded and cleared every turn until i could outsmorc using my weapon.
---
100% win rate.
---
Idk, at least make it “expansion only”
---
The armor inspired from the dragon scales ( year of the dragon ) idk man... they could remove it like the other expansion words ( i.e. Adapt ) 
---
It is not that complicated..
---
No
---
HOW'D YOU GET NO LOOT! WHERE ARE THEY
---
Not disagreeing, but the fact that there are so many thief-like cards in priest, it seems in Blizzard's best interest to make it affect the spell damage with Velen. But hey, maybe I'm wrong lol.
---
I just find her a bit hard as a first boss, but aside that, I didn't lose that much against her.

Maybe Khadgar for Jan'alai.

As I wild player you either aren't very high in rank or your bad at counter play.  As a wise man once said "Build a generic warlock deck, and replace all duplicates with random tech cards then boom you have renolock". Running cards that clog up their resurrect pool is a great way to put a stop to their games. Learn to counter your worst match-ups.
---
Amazing job!
---
Garvey#21613 EU 80 gold quest trade. You go first.
---
You have sense demons and tap for warlock plus you have board clears and stuff in the meantime. Big priest doesn't even rely on Barnes, it's just one of the ways to get going. Two shadow vision, Barnes, vargoth or the 2 copies of the 6 mana spell to get rolling. You only need one of these. 
---
There are no tutor mechanics in this cyclone deck to draw your minions. Therefore you can get more unlucky whilst doing very little on board. I don't rate it. Its strong with a good hand, but if your minions bottom half, you fucked. The 4 mana 2/4 draw elemental I guess would improve that, but I don't like that card. This will never be a top deck with the cards we have available.
---
but devastator cant kill minions with divine shield or 12 health dragons! so he totally needs the +1/+1 in stats to be usable /s
---
every Hearthstone forum: whiny posts about big priest every day for many months
---
OP: "nO oNE sEemS tO mEnTiOn It"
---
It is literally the card text and you can see the board state &gt;.&lt;
---
It will be on your account forever, and every character can use it. There is no time limit.
---
Not at all. But if Warrior continues to be king of the Hill, are any of those suggestions bad?
---
I wouldn't say any of them are. Omega Devastator is premium removal and at worst a Vanilla body. That's insane.
---
Dr. Boom is one of two Hero Cards in Standard that can generate amazing amounts of value. Even if you outright removed Security Drone, Dr. Boom is still a very efficient and powerful card that you'd still run.
---
It just so happens that between nerfing Mech-Rush, nerfing Security Drone, and removing Security Drone, I went with the nerf that *least* reduces Dr. Boom's power.
---
As for Shield Slam, Brawl, and Supercollider... all of them would still see play at +1 Mana. None of them are unreasonable at +1 Mana. I can see why Supercollider was printed at 5 Mana. Many people doubted if it would be good.
---
Turns out, it's really, *really* good. So 6 Mana probably works well for it.
---
And Dyn-o-Matic... well. It's efficient. I wouldn't say make it 6 Mana, I think that's overkill. But making it a 3/3 wouldn't be the worst change in the world; giving it the EVIL Miscreant treatment. Nothing wrong with that.
---
So... nah, I don't hate Warrior. If it helps, I also think that Team 5 will (and should) *eventually* Hall of Fame a myriad of Classic/Basic cards, including Frostbolt, Fireball, Flamestrike, Eviscerate, Consecration, Truesilver Champion, Savage Roar, and many more.
---
There's no "Warrior hate" going on here. I can suggest a massive variety of nerfs for different cards if you really want. I'm only suggesting Warrior ones because they're on top right now.
---
Is there a class *you* hate that you want me to bash a bit?
---
Weeb
---
Fortunes can be replaced with barista lynchen and khadgar
---
not if you had rolled all darknesses
---
Any Mech without Rush already becomes "too strong" with Rush.
---
That's a Dr. Boom feature. That isn't specific to Omega Devastator.
---
Even so, that's when you play Devastator on Turn 10 after having already played Dr. Boom. That's two notable requirements.
---
Vilespine Slayer was good, and one of the reasons why was because it could be used as early as Turn 4. Omega Devastator can only be used as strong removal on Turn 10 or later. It's a massive difference.
---
Is Omega Devastator too strong at 5 Mana? It very well maybe. But coupling it with the Dr. Boom nerf and the fact that a variety of cards are getting buffed (*neither* of which benefit Warrior after my Security Drone nerf) and wa-la, it's a realistic chance that Warrior won't be a dominator.
---
Valeera is not the best HP but also not the worst (Garrosh and Thrall are). I mean, she's a lot of extra value for trade in tempo, which is fine in late encounters as you can't aggro down these bosses anyway.
---
It says 5
---
Yeah but if you introduce better format the variety would arise bit and would be so stale.
---

---
Umm, gold grinding?  Just crafted the meta deck and want to get used to playing it before you take it to ranked?  Lots of perfectly good reasons to do that.
---
The wording on Whirlwind Tempest is "Your minions with Windfury...". If the card said "Your Windfury minions..." there would be no issue for the reason you stated.
---
Dude you didn't even try to have the slightest effort for this post. not even cropped the Google screenshot, if you hope for upvotes go to r/hearthstonecirclejerk
---
Yeah, I agree. 10 damage kills everything except the beefiest of minions, so it's just a guaranteed 2 for 1 almost every single time. I think that the developers want to test with minions that have these effects, but a straight kill is just too powerful to be at 4 mana. 
---
BGH and Slayer are both 5 and have pretty strict conditions, and have no tribal tag.
---
I think that what we are seeing is a dire lack of playtesting by the Hearthstone team. Omega Devastator will probably be fine next April, once Dr. Boom, Mad Genius, Omega Assembly and the Magnetic minions (except SN1P-SN4P) rotate out. However, this is the team that admitted they did not realize the Reckless Experimenter/SN1P-SN4P interaction. They probably just underrated the power of Devastator because Devastator is best from Dr. Boom or Assembly, not necessarily as a card in your deck. I fear that the buffs to Security Rover and Beryllium Nullifer will have the same effect: card is still not worth being in the deck, but simply better off 'Created By', which is a slight buff overall.
---
Hopefully the future sets and content additions will have more testing (or at least a public test server), as it seems that several critical interactions have been missed or underestimated in the last year or so.
---
It should be noted that this is only for Vincent’s ultimate weapon, death penalty, which gains damage based on the amount of enemies Vincent has killed.
---
You get 3 packs for getting to the 5 boss i think in every chapter, so maybe you want to at least get that reward, and a golden pack if you clear it
---
Because the different decks have different synergies and different challenges (e.g. random deck can be super hard).  Completely the game on easy mode when you've already done it on hard is pointless...  I mean go and do it if you want - each to their own.  But there is no way i'd bother doing another 180 completed runs.  The first 6 runs on normal i completed on my first try, so it's a hell of a lot easier.  But i'm not going to waste time and do the rest.  Hell it's already a waste of time trying to do the 180 on heroic, but i'm a completionist so...
---
&gt;I think what the guys above are referring to is mega-windfury is checked on the worgen but the worgen isn't damaged so it doesn't have wind windfury and the game thinks it's fine. Then the worgen becomes enraged but the mega-windfury check happened earlier and is never reevaluated. At least that's how I interpreted their speculation.
---
So what you're saying is,  Bug: Raging Worgen doesn't interact with Whirlwind Tempest (Mega-windfury does not apply to Raging Worgen)
---
IT RECOVERS FROM LAST STRIKE
---
I'm quite sure that Mega-windfury would work even if the card got windfury through a buff (e.g. adaptation or the windfury card in shaman). The question is: if the worgen got windfury through such buffs when it is undamaged and could attack four times with whirlwind tempest, why couldn't it attack four times after it was enraged?
---
I think the percentages reflect the entirety of the Hearthstone deck pool. (So, for example, Zoo and Bomb Warrior are included in the Miscreant percentage.) Basically, the only thing this diagram shows us is that a lot less people are playing Tempo Rogue. 
---
In order to see its inclusion in decks, refer to the number next to the percentage. It is 2. So pretty much every Tempo Rogue deck around still plays two copies. Relative to Tempo Rogue, Prep usage declined ~33%. Raiding Party usage declined ~70%. Very rough guesstimates.

I killed him with the horsemen as well but I didn't have stargazing. Guess he didn't consider them too much of a threat.
---
Just small indie dev things
---
They try to convince him it’s not a bug so he can exploit it without getting banned 👌
---
Awww, single player posts triggering people who think they're going to be competive hs players, how cute
---
Go back to watching the GMs and thinking your ranked plays actually mean anything.
---
Look on the left. You can see 2 attacks. It's getting the buff, but the game is throwing an "already attacked" error. 
---
Buff isn't functioning as intended.
---
Surely not. Bob is our boy and he wants us to succeed, he would never tease or mock us for our misfortune.
---
In heroic, winning is the main and only source of fun and satisfaction.
---
I’m dumb and still sort of new, could you explain what the dust refund window is?
---
It also works for barrets
---
Prep Sprint
---
Duh, I know. I'm countering the point that he is not considered a windfury minion. The game clearly acknowledges that (and yet does not work).
---
For a time after a card is nerfed you can dust it for it's full price rather than the normal 1/4 price.
---
Doesn’t sound right. It has the mega wind fury buff visible which means the game knows it should have mega wind fury
---
Wasn’t this in a HysteriA video? Coulda sworn I’d seen it.
---
I wish they'd left preparation as it was and only done the othee 2 rogue nerfs
---
He did kill the one horseman I have played on the first turn, but he have only coin+taunt on the second turn.
---
Well, just vanish it

Kinda looks like Baymax, which I guess kinda works with the äs you command" line haha
---
I love your comment. You literally have 0 clue what's going on and try to argue. 
---
Your point is: "it should be able to attack twice, not once".    
---
When in reality it attacked twice, but should attack four times. Mega windfury.
---
But then again the text says "Has windfury while damaged", which probably overwrites the mega-windfury.
---
This is painful
---
I beat this boss to death with a rock 0 mana 1 damage and echo? OTK BABBYYY
---
Secret Deathrattle Mech Hunter has some unneeded tech double rattrap and ooze IMO is overkill
---
It will still see play in wild, so no reason to dust it personally. But like I still dont see the point in dusting commons/rares like Raiding Party or whatever the nerfed cards of the moment are. The minute amount of dust gained doesnt seem worth it. Epics and legendaries are different.

Personal gratification used to be the only pay off in video games. In fact I would say it’s the most powerful motivator.

Notice people who do great things in video games typically didn’t do it for the payoff.

After you play a 1-Cost minion, give it +1 Attack and **Rush.**

---
Mage was always worse than rogue. 
---
Only reason it wasn't at a super high win rate is because Rogue could often kill them by turn 6.
---
I always just assumed it would max out with a 10 cost minion or something. Interesting! Thanks!
---
Like dr.Boom's lackey. I like it

Not sure if it would actually change revenue at all, just let me get rid of cthun and Marin.

Can somebody explain why this is so good? He plays a bunch of cards and... That's it? I don't see how this has any impact.

&gt;I never said he is the gold standard. I could easily quote other streamers I watched, like thijs, casie, mryagut, asmodai. I just dont have the clips. Also dog is a very well respected pro player whose opinion is cared a lot by the community.
---
I'd be surprised if they all said prep was overpowered, but that doesn't even matter. I don't care what they think, I care about their reasons for thinking it. If you point me to a pro who says: "I think prep is overpowered, respect my opinion I'm a pro", I'll disregard them. If they say: "I think prep is overpowered because of x and y", quote me those reasons and we can have a discussion. The same logic applies no matter the person.
---
&gt;Using winrate of unrefined decks played by unskilled players in an meta that is still trying to adapt is an equally bad metric. A lot of people on reddit dont know how to interpret data since they dont look at the context of the data. When they see post like this, their first reaction is just that rogue has died. It is extremely misleading.
---
Am I doing that? Never once did I quote winrate. Unless you're referring to the part where I talked about the VS power rankings, but surely you're not saying that the pre-nerf meta was unrefined and legend players are unskilled.
---
I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you weren't talking about me, in which case you didn't respond to any of the points I made (again).
---
&gt;Vanish was already not used in the meta before nerf.
---
Hence, "the possibility" of building any remotely slow rogue deck. If it wasn't seeing play before the nerf, it sure as hell won't after. Nevertheless, it has seen play in the past, as you mention in your historical overview, the point of which escapes me.
---
&gt;Almost all the high legend rogue players have cut waggle pick and greenskin. I believe you can do the math.
---
You said: "You cant mindlessly go face with 20+ damage from hand any more.". This is objectively untrue. Obviously you can't do the 20+ damage combo if you don't play the 20+ damage combo, but that's a pointless statement. Since the combo is still around, clearly that was not the target of the nerf.
---
&gt;No one is arguing that the new deck is stronger than pre-nerf lackey rogue. But you can compare the winrate of pros playing shark rogue and the average stat on hsreplay.  
---
Do you think cyclone mage is a bad deck just beause it has low winrate?
---
Exactly, no one is doing that. I don't think cyclone mage is a bad deck, looking forward to the point you will make with that information. Hopefully it isn't: "better players play better", because that would yet again be a pointless statement.
---
You haven't really responded to any of the points I've made. You've written responses, but they don't address what I said. That's why I may come across a little, I don't know, annoyed? I'm just trying to get to the essence of the matter.
---
I know it's a neutral, but 60% is absurd.
---
And I honestly don't understand the hate for Mana Cyclone.  The deck isn't overly strong, the card isn't overly strong, it's just that Mage has no identity and zero early game right now
---
I’ve seen lots of players been discouraged because gold purchases of heist aren’t efficient, while cash purchases are. this would make it favorable
---
Chameleos and shifting scroll that turn into secrets freeze the game. Reboot game
---
This might have been one of the most skill testing situations in Hearthstone ever. 27 seconds left in the turn, suddenly your game plan flips, you need to start thinking about the mana costs of the cards left in your deck, how to draw the most without overdrawing next turn and leaving the best board. Of course the power level of the combo you accidentally created is enough that you can still win with less than perfect play, but squeezing that situation from say a 85% win into a 90% win is not easy.
---
The more you know, thanks 👍🏻👍🏻
---
This argument is stupid, craft 1 legendary while throwing away 5 decks and 5 future decks since they will update after year rotation
---
IMO, this is no different than poker tournament. Yes, luck is a factor. You may see a total newbie doing random all in with a 2-7 off suit knock out a seasoned pro with pocket aces because the table flopped three 7s. But you still keep seeing the same faces on the final table.
---
Your one of those so called optimists right?
---
It is slightly, but not by a large enough margin for me to choose playing a deck I find far less fun.
---
I would disenchant it if i could, I dont want to play a random deck I want to play my deck
---
It would be fine If it didn't have Rush.
---
Mage also has the most bullshit and annoying card ever printed in this game. Ice Block.
---
And carpet
---
Even when disenchanting zayle, that doesn't suddenly become cost efficient
---
Oh yeah, im fuckin stupid. I can see a 1 cost hunter in the future with a bit more support.
---
Yeah you’d think for a billion dollar company something like that would just be a given.
---
Yeah I think you have enough AoE with Flamestrike and Blizzard tbh
---
Did you mean tempo or do you mean myracle?
---
There are several ways you can nerf that card which would make it still playable but less oppressive. 
---
The problem with Mage still remains though. That entire class is being carried by a single card. That's very bad, not only for the class, but for the game in general. We already have Pally in the dumpster. Priest has the Nomi deck which is playable but not very good and Mage being 1 card away from joining them at the dumpster.
---
I thought about Defender too, but I have at least seen that played. I genuinely don't think I've seen Agent ever outside of arena. I think that goes to show how powerful the Omega restriction is.
---
The slower rogue decks lost to Myracle Rogue pre-nerf. By Myracle, I mean the list with double Corsair, double deckhand, life drinkers, leeroy, etc. The burn list, not the janky stuff with Nomi or the Burgle package.
---
I guess you need a good deck and starting hand. The thing to remember is that he summons a 1/1 copy of each card he draws. I found that having my minions permastealthed meant that he couldn’t ever pop those 1/1s, so as long as I killed off the big minion he played from hand, he would eventually just have a board if 1/1s, while my board is full of fatties.
---
My one fan being destroyed by the cruel acts of reddit. :(
---
Don’t want to sound salty or anything, but this is the reason hs stays popular but isnt anything close to competitive. All the rng mechanics, its fun to watch but trying to play it competitively is just slowly draining the life out of yourself.
---
Do I spend 4800 dust on a deck from someone who doesn’t have 400....
---
:P
---
Yes probably. I’ve never gotten legend!
---
(Really hagatha, archivist and shudder are all probably playable for a while...$
---
It's also the idea that silence doesn't remove tribal tags.  The power of a lot of the mech decks is the ability to magnetize onto one another for immediate damage.
---
The magnetize effect turns every minion into a charge minion and that's the real threat.  The Hunter or Paladin or whoever doesn't necessarily need to build a massive minion to win the game.  They just keep slapping mechs on one another for burn.
---
I've been playing a lot of Kiblers mech paladin lately and have faced a few priests who have mass dispelled my board and emoted me because they thought I lost losing the big mechs.  It didn't matter, I slapped new mechs on them and immediately went face.
---
This card exists to piss off quest and cyclone mage players.
---
Sea giants
---
Well not sure what happened, but i was happy that it doesnt cancel the run
---
I actually beat it with rogue on my second run, its all about making as efficient plays as possible and utilizing trades to make room on the board. draft with the idea that minions are not supposed to last they should be controlling the board and generating value.
---
This thread made me 800 dust, because I legit 100% forgot that you actually *could dust* prep. My brain slotted it into the 'undustable basics' bin and didn't even bother checking.
---
I wasnt aware that it took hours to do the dailies. In any case, I guess its nice that they gave you exactly the same amount of content for free as they did last time, hey?
---
That's what I figured.  That the bomb is completely nested within the book.  Thanks for the feedback!
---
Just went back and totalled it, came out to $640
---
First 4 paid adventures, welcome bundle, pre-orders for Grand Tournament, Journey to Ungoro, Frozen throne, Kobolds &amp; catacombs, witchwood, boomsday ($80), and rastakhan rumble, 
---
Also the mammoth bundle, and 122 classic packs
---
Starting with Rise of Shadows I've stopped paying real money, as I've accumulated enough gold and dust to play whatever competitive decks I want (currently around 11,000 gold and 30,000 dust if I mass-disenchant)
---
You are again confusing the lootbox with the content.  The content is the solo player adventure.  Whether or not you think it's worth $20 is completely your own opinion, but expecting it to be free is just wantit it to be microtransactioned.
---
No i am comparing it to the completely free game with a completely free wing that is fully operational on its own.

Why must my rank 15 Wild Thief Rogue suffer for the sins of Tempo Rogue

This was a shaman run!
---
Lmao what's the fucking difference between 36 and 30 dmg on board?
---
Haha we don't care!
---
Not really. Overreaction implies that you are reacting too strongly. For example, saying "this is the best day of my life" when you won $5 on a scratchoff would be an overreaction, but it does not have any negative consequence and isn't really an illogical thing to do.
---
Dusting Prep now does not have any negative consequence, but it is also a bit irrational to instantly dust it when there is no good reason to. If you agree with the guy saying "wait til the meta settles" that implies that you aren't a good enough player to figure out if you would still personally run the card.
---
♪ He's got stealth and a whole lot more... ♪
---
Sadly I can’t seem to get insane high rolls for the last boss.
---
The reason for me is that I use Prep in my thief rogue deck and would like to continue playing that deck.
---
Nice! I am at 2245 with mage. Next closest is 1031.
---
I love how it took him two attempts to spell 'fuck' properly.
---
Being trying to play a tess deck but most of deck dont work with me, mind sharing your deck?
---
Just test it out at a rank floor. That’s literally why they exist.
---
Over five years I’ve spent $1,000 (technically around $1,020) on Hearthstone.
---
Let’s do-Let’s do-Let’s do-this-Let’s-this-do-Let’s-this-do-this-Let’s-this-do-this!
---
If this is for both standard and wild, there is a chance odd warrior has something to do with this too. If it is standard only then elyssianna just didn’t get hit that hard
---
Give up your treasure!
---
Someone doesn't know how to read
---
Thief Priest don't see that play. 
---
And the Classic Set from Priest is worst compare with the other Hereos. So i dont see a problem to reduce the card at 2 mana. 
---
What to you think about this?
---
For burgle I agree ti reduce the cost because its random .
---
But thoughsteal, I think it should stay as a 3 mana because it gives information about the opponent deck.
---
And the deathrattle
---
I think the real solution is to HoF giants. Having neutral cards with that kind of mana reduction has always lead to powerful strategies revolving around them. And while I have always loved the giant mechanics (Good old Ecco Giant mage/grinder mage were sweet), I think it is better for the overall health of the game to move them out. Neutral mana cheating is just hard to balance around.
---
What if you can win every game in every mode with 5 Millhouses? Secret exodia!
---
Very accurate. I also run 1.8 copies of raiding party
---
Give Mage back Ice Block, just don't let it be in the pool for random card generators like Magic Trick. I think there would've been a lot more experimentation with luna's pocket galaxy if ice block was still a thing.
---
Guaranteed he broke something in the house after and his mom yelled at him about it.
---
Had to look that meme up, dude got a geico add because of how much he says dog? lol
---
I dunno. Players up to rank 10ish are really bad. I can believe he didn’t drop a game until closer to maybe rank 7
---
Still obviously tier 1.
