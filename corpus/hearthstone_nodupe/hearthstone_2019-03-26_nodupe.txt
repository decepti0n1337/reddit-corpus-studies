Maybe by "Add a bomb that deals 1 damage each turn, upgrade each turn (upgrading the damage)" would fix it a bit.

I seriously don't believe they could have done a worse job.

Why do you care about about t games that are  out the door? Why play something that's over and done with, you have to get over it. Everything ends and hearthstone, may not be "ending," period, end of discussion, but if you've been playing since launch you can easily see they just want to print weak cards. Hearthstone was never about tame, but you put it the best Dr.Boom in this set is just Dr. Boom with a condition, that's their philopshy- make it more tame, make it cost more, make it have less stats. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Move on to another game man it's time. You think you cant but you're probably like me and have an obsessive personality if you love hearthstone so much still, I guarantee you you'll obsess over another game. 
---
Would this include cards that summon copies, like molten reflection? If so this would improve exodia mage

---
Aren't the spell stones rotating? 
---
Isn't it better for the game to have weak cards that have very niche utility rather than card's that have no utility in any circumstance? I get the idea of printing Bad cards in order to reduce the power level of random effects, but it seems absurd to put out cards that aren't intended to ever see play. 
---

It's obviously not a great way, but it's supposed to be approximate. A 5 Mana should be stronger than a 2 Mana, but khadgar is stronger than most 5 Mana minions. There are always exceptions of course, but this is the biggest misrepresentation of power I've seen in hearthstone.
---
As jaraxxus you can even destroy yourself and replace yourself with yourself. 
---
if my opponent does this combo I would not mind it. 
---
Seems alright.  If you build a deck around it he might be the same power level as a neutral boom, maybe better.
---
The fact that you have to run this is an archetype probably works against it, but it will be funny to play it with 6-24 points of damage summoning and with 5-30 damage of traps in your opponents deck
---
Strength and mana cost don’t either.
---
Chakki was great 
---
Out jerked again
---
I read this like a Magic card and my eyes almost popped out of my sockets before I realised minions aren't spells in HS. Yeesh.
---
8 Mana 10/24 or 20/48 lool
---
Callback things are cool. Probably. 
---
Smashing!
---
Just imagine playing this on 3 with the lackey you get and they all seem pretty good
---
1/1 + 2/1 with rush
---
1/1 + random 3 drop
---
Two 1/1s and a random 2 drop/deal 2 damage/discover
---
Art is off on this card. I would see some play if it was gain 2 armor per turn or starts with 6 armor
---
that's because you're playing the equivalent of pirate warrior except its worse because the life total is only 20. a game's cost is averaged between combo, control, and aggro if it were just aggro hell you can play just zoo over and over and over and over for like 2000 dust
---
a 2 mana 2/2 that makes two 6 cost minions is pretty talented
---
Arguably great. 
---
Hearthstone was released 5 years and 14 days ago.  Of course people will eventually abandon the game, it's simply inevitable.  I've been playing since closed beta and I'm still enjoying the game to a certain extent.  
---
They also had a massive bug which disrupted the flow of every match.
---
The reason it was such a huge deal is because the entire Priest class was unplayable at the time. Then they gave Priest a horrible card with no support.
---
Purify is a bad card, but to call it the worst card in the game is insane.
---
 It seems like all they care about is money. Game is becoming more and more boring and stale. Card designs are getting worse.
---
As I said. this is what happening to this game. for example new solo adventure COST 20$. besides the packs and rewards now they are charging us for the (previously free) Solo adventures. Isn't this enough?
---
Maybe it will be played in mirror matches. You already win in fatigue with warrior against any other class 
---
Boom's Scheme is just a badly designed card, even if it does somehow end up being good. It shouldn't be prinited in it's current state. I thought the team really cared about "theme and flavor" above all else but this is clearly an exception. It's pretty disappointing.
---
If the golden version has the belly bounce, I'm going to use my entire college fund to buy packs.
---
Murloc Mage big oof
---
Does this work with Seaforium Bomber?
---
that's not a good sign.. is it?
---
there were more people quitting this year...
---
&gt; It's obviously not a great way, but it's supposed to be approximate.
---
Hard disagree there.
---
Otherwise Old Gods would have to be like 25 Mana flat.
---
Titans would have to be 1,000 Mana flat when they're introduced.
---
And the Giants would not be equivalent to *freakin' Dragon Aspects.*
---
&gt; There are always exceptions of course, but this is the biggest misrepresentation of power I've seen in in a card in hearthstone.
---
Nope. Old Gods are much more wildly misrepresented than this.
---
"It's supposed to be approximate" is extremely baseless on your part. Have a character with a seriously powerful effect of high Mana Cost -- like Varian Wrynn or Alexstrasza.
---
But if you're going to have a powerful effect that *doesn't* have to be gated by a high Mana Cost, such as Khadgar's? It is actually stronger to have him be low Mana Cost -- and thus more accessible for combos -- than for him to be high Mana Cost, and for his effect to be more difficult to take advantage of.
---
Hence why Arugal and Khadgar are both more powerful than if they were, say, 4 Mana 4/4s or 6 Mana 6/6s.
---
When To My Side was revealed I was still expecting them to unveil the Reno of the mechanic, a powerhouse to make the condition make sense, so I didn't get caught up in the circlejerk. I was optimistic. This card... this card I have a hard time being optimistic about. I have a hard time thinking of any mechanic that could make this card work that isn't overly contrived and doesn't make the other armor gain cards overpowered. Spell-only Hunter may have sounded weak at the time but the potential was there. I just can't see any potential here.
---
And it prompted a mass exodus when ported to Gwent :D
---
Asking the question I came here to pose. I'm out of the loop on where the card reveals are coming from, so I wondered if the card was revealed on a British stream or something.
---
I think this is the worst card that will ever be printed, I really can’t think of anything that was worse 
---
They didn't even use inhouse developers for that iirc. It's made by NetEase with Blizzard art assets.
---
I think this card may still see play because Warrior will only have Shield Block and this card as unconditional armor gain (I guess Weapons Project also kinda counts). If a Maly deck gets popular, they can add one of these as a tech card. Like the 5 mana BGH, it doesn't matter if you are terrible if there isn't a better option.
---
rip in peace
---
Two 1/1s and a random 2 drop/deal 2 damage/discover a spell
---
inb4 a huge reveal video of Heroes/Champions for the remaining 4 classes with no villains.
---
[removed]
---
This bad to summon boom boys originally. No way is this the original idea. 
---
Their legendary cards are consistently amazing, and most can be auto included in any pally deck. I don't think any other class is like that, correct me if I'm wrong. I've never enjoyed facing paladins tbh.
---
The best defence is a good offence. 
---
His point was that they force him to be like brode and the paper thin intentionality of it is another point towards hearthstone being a paint by the numbers metric machine that would rather capture some sort of statuts quo than be innovative, which is what got them success in the first place. And I for one agree with him, now what matters if I think that and others don't, nothing, but then why discuss video games ever, because at the end of the day the whole topic of video games is benign. 
---
It's supposed to be an anniversary set that has callback cards
---
Don‘t you guys have Lackeys?
---
I'm just grateful that just MAYBE, for once in the history of Hearthstone, Druid and Paladin won't dominate ladder.  Seeing the same 10 cards get overplayed for years begins to wear thin.  It's not personal, it's just one of the most overplayed classes in the game, because they consistently get fed the best cards (applies to both aforementioned classes).
---

I'm not trying to argue that 'Blizzard cares'.  I think believing that any company 'cares' about you is laughably juvenile.  Blizzard, Valve, any for profit company (and quite a few of the non-profit ones) do not.  Valve supports Dota2 like they do because it's profitable.  No other reason.
---
As long as you can consistently have 3 bombs in your enemy's deck this thing will fill your board no matter what. Add on the Dr. Boom hero card and all those boom bots have rush giving this card a solid body and a decent amount of removal/burn. 
---
While in wild Dr. Boom hasn't been used because of the insane amount of synergy... Well this isn't wild and the power level is significantly lowering meaning the bombs, the Dr. Boom hero, and this card all help each other significantly in an interesting control/burn deck. 
---
The shudderwock player also had shudderwock. And you wouldn't play cards that would dig you into fatigue. And sometimes you'd play banker. Remember that shudderwock is an infinite pile of board clears, healing, tech... It's not even a control matchup at that point, shudderwock is a one card combo.
---
Jeeze, what do you think you're talking about.
---
At least it’s common and not Epic.
---
Ok?  To me it seems like you're just trying to make something out of nothing. If you're not enjoying the game anymore, then just move on.  Just because a game is losing people doesn't mean it's a "daed gaem".  I went through that with StarCraft, and this is nothing like that.
---
They did, they said [[Drakkari Enchanter]] makes scheme cards upgrade twice as fast :P (Kappa)
---
This was supposed to have been a response to the OP, I didn’t mean to attach it to yours. Shame on me!
---
My guess is that after Dr. Boom blows up the reinforced metal door he looks at the metal shrapnel left behind and thinks to himself, "I can make myself a new suit from this stuff!". 
---
The longer you wait, the more powerful the explosion is, which causes more metal bits to fly loose from the barrier and then be used as armor.  
---
Is it actually his rat? If so that’s awesome
---
You could throw it in renomage pretty easily since it runs all these cards anyways.

The way I see it. The game is on the decline but it's no where near die'ing. It used to be in the top on Twitch but even on normal weekdays it still has a steadily 20k watching daily, which says a lot. 
---
You never have to wait long to get into a match.
---
E-Sports still has a massive prize pool.
---
And there are probably more reasons to why it isn't die'ing. I do hope that with their 50% money-loss that they are going to change/add some QoL to suit our needs; adding in tournament modes; more achievements, etc. 
---
I honestly don't see it happen anytime soon since they haven't for the last 5years but I believe this game is still here in another 5 years and I'm going to enjoy it :D

Feeding blizzard for pumping out shit is part of the problem.  blizzard obviously doesn't give a shit about the game as a whole or you as a player and are milking you for as much as they can before they take hearthstone behind the shed.  This has been the plan since they introduced standard. Fuck fixing and balancing the game, let's just regurgitate expansions with overpowered mechanics that the players will be required to buy to stay relevant.  You can compare this to magic's buisness model where they prioritize keeping the balance of the game above all else in a bid to keep the game relevant in the long term.  Each new expansion is another nail in the coffin for hearthstone but another dollar in the pocket of activision.
---
I think people are upset that it's a signature card that is boring and bad, coupled with how early it was revealed
---
Got any good lists by any chance? Also is it odd secret or normal secret? 
---
Sorry i forgot to mention that i talk about specialist format/sideboard. 
---
So... deal 1 damage to a random enemy wasn’t on the table I guess?

---
So you could use different dopple gangsters? I did not know that.
---
Oh boy! Another reason that charge should be removed from the game...
---
Did we just find the Boom's plan deck?  Woot!
---
Personally I don't think you can build a control shell around 50 damage, there still too much healing in the game for that to be anything but an auto-loss in a third your matches.  Which means that you have to win on the board, using the booms as a form of chip damage to let you deal with the negative tempo.

---
Imp Scheme only needs to be in hand for 2 turns (3 Imps) to be passable, and it becomes a solid Zoo card on the 3rd turn in hand (4 Imps). Warlock also has numerous synergies in Standard and Wild for it. 
---
Did you count quest, if you did the odds are better
---
&gt; Tournament mode. Pauper. 
---
God yes. Y'know the Masters qualifiers tournaments have absolutely highlighted just how direly needed the previously announced and then cancelled tournament Functionality is. 
---
For starters, blizzard has employees coordinate and manage this shit on a buggy 3rd party platform as well as handles communication via yet another entirely separate outside of the game platform. 
---
Things like needing to screenshot your games, reach out to admins for questions or view tournament announcements on discord, or just basic shit like auto-ensuring that people aren't playing multiple tournaments at once and wasting people's time can all be automated away by building it in the client. 
---
Not to mention you can literally save the 3 people's labor who are constantly monitoring and running this shit (Kyle knudson MVP) as well as give your players a way to, yknow, test their decks in your new goddamn tournament game format outside of sponsored tournaments. 
---
They seriously dropped the ball on this and it is completely unacceptable. 
---
Combo druid with 3000 effective health probably isn't going to care much

---
If revealing new cards was the purpose then why was she roping multiple times and missing chances to reveal cards. Also the conversation was dull and useless
---
Could one not argue that the games economy should be measured by its relative share of archetype, and not just equal weight to all archetypes? Yes It’s an aggro meta, but that also means it’s a cheap meta.
---
Dual lands help with efficiency, but the tap lands are a more than adequate substitute while one grows their collection.
---
The expensive decks are certainly within reach if you play every a lot and plop down some bucks. And if the retort is you only like to play expensive decks, then it’s a bit of beggars can’t be choosers isn’t it?

I'm not aware of how exactly the match-up actually plays out, but in theory, Jade Druid makes you mill proof.

It's a "callback" to their themes and adventures, but they're not THE callback mechanics the devs were talking about

5-10 years probably seems like a good amount. You're being silly if you think pro-neutrality people actually believed the internet would go to shit literal months after it was repealed. You're also being silly if you think they haven't already started engaging in shitty practices that will no longer get them sued. Verizon was secretly doing very anti-net neutrality throttling years before net neutrality was repealed and legal action was brought up against them. Now they are in the legal right to do those things, there's no way in hell they, and other ISPs, aren't doing targeted throttling right now as we speak.
---
go for the long con it's not going to be playable until rotation
---
Hope that means they get something special.
---
Based on the art it may have been deal 1 damage to a random enemy character, and had the dynamite from mad bomber, but I am not veteran enough to know when 1 damage per turn would be worth 4 mana.
---
Then act accordingly?

Epic combo with onyxia

---
  
---
ActivisionBlizzard employs people specifically to figure out how to emotionally manipulate people into giving them money, they'd never let one of their employees just do whatever. I don't think Brode was more genuine or unscripted than anyone else, he's just charismatic and knew how to convincingly guffaw for 90% of the reveal stream.

Over the past 7 hours ive been discussing different effects for his scheme and everyone has given good feedback thats better than what they made. But i mean if it was bouncing blade x amount of times would be better
---
She wasn't alone on the stream, Chris was all over the place talking about his games against the Inn keeper and all the technical difficulties weren't on her. I didn't enjoy the stream either but I can point to half a dozen reasons why and none of them are her fault. 
---
Firebat and Kolento get up to 20k viewers on twitch, they both have youtube channels with 100,000's of thousands of subs,  how are they not more entertaining than these people. It's literally their job to entertain and no offense but you couldn't pay me to watch the people who were casting today on stream, they have no idea how to talk to an audience only how to talk down them or try to sell to them.        
---
Kibler and Frodan would be fine and they would definitely be more corporate and maybe give a lot more faux excitement about the expansion than Kolento/Firebat but that doesn't really appeal to me or any of my friends.    
---
I said in another post you don't even have to go outside of Blizzard I used to love watching Chakki stream or appear on other people's stream he's a funny guy, use him.
---
Yeah... I don't see it. The tempo behind getting in enough hero power damage is abysmal. 
---
Just you.
---
Prevention is better than a cure.
---
As such, preventing Standard from getting to that point is better for the game than allowing it to first get to that point.
---
Hell yeah, I honestly played a tempo silence combo priest for a while- sometimes it would just get board with a silenced 4/8 and some +3 health buffs from the 3/4 and steamroll everything, sometimes I’d sneak in a 2/5 charge double divine inner fire for 20 burst lethal. Super fun deck 
---
Prominent lore figure. Carried us thru two expansions.
---
2 cost. Dies to a single Backstab.
---
Tried jade druid, most of them run geist now sadly. 
---
They are too slow to add new fun gsme mofes to compete other ways than standard ladder. 
---
Yeah that three person thing felt really forced. 
---
What real card?
---
Strangely enough the Mana Cost of Boom's Scheme doesn't matter all that much when you'll never play it before turn 10 anyway. The problem is that it's effectively a dead draw for at least half of the game because of how painfully slowly it upgrades. The other Schemes become cards worth designing around after 3-4 turns in hand. Boom's Scheme needs at least 10 turns in hand to get a 4 Mana version of Bring it On.
---
Thanks!
---
Probably won’t see play in standard, but great for arena
---
Yea why the fuck would you give your opponent time to think in a card game!? Absolutely ridiculous!!
---
They are, that wasn't sarcasm. One's a guarunteed hit, the other's hope they have to trade into it.
---
I do. I dont watch the streams anymore after boomsday
---
Sorry, what does Trolden mean?

King's Defender never saw play because FWA existed, and even after it was nerfed Taunt Warrior would rather play Blood Razor

Why exactly everyone loved Ben Brode, aside from his laugh?

~~As an aside, just as an FYI for anyone who might for whatever reason want to pick up Shadowverse after reading this, if you do it in the next two days (before the new expansion), that will net you 10 packs from the expansion that's about to rotate out and then 10 from the new one when it drops.~~
---
&gt;1 for a lackey, 6 for the card) and Discover the effect?
---
Don't forget that you can shadow step. And rogue drawing 3 cards for 3 mana + changing cost to 0. This gonna be insane. Tempowise isn't that bad, 6 mana 5/5 ( or 7 mana considering the need of a lackey on board).
---
No. Prevention in this case, as with most card games with a rotating Standard format, is to have a block of sets noticeably less powerful than those that preceded it. Much like how getting a flu shot can make one feel ill shortly after getting it, there will be side effects. Last year's sets were the reset you mentioned.
---
Plus, MtG gets by just fine without a noticeable power increase between block sets.
---
bli$$ard
---
Spot on. There is no other remotely comparable mobile card game experience.
---
That could be true if it were a random 6 drop instead of a discover.
---
That's the problem though. At least on the surface it seems like there's an extremely small amount of design space between "card that makes this playable" and "card that is too powerful".
---

people were leaving HS because games felt predestined before they started, so when there are loads of other CCGs sprouting up these days a beggars CAN be choosers by the fact that they have the option to leave to begin with.

also in aggro metas of CCGs, you play decks or cards to beat the meta which if anything would lend to control cards/decks more

no.

Will the 10k viewers going to continue watch HS if Kripp/Thijs retire from HS? Maybe the channel total viewership will drop to 10k+
---
&gt;I played a lot in that KnC meta. A quick google of a Viscious Syndicate report from March 2018 indicates Spell Hunter was solidly tier 1 at all levels.
---
Alright, I stand corrected.
---
...or maybe not so much? Actually looking at the Spell Hunter decks at the time, they didn't seem to include To My Side anyway. [The one in your source, for example, does not.](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/odemians-spell-hunter-hct-toronto-at-elgx-2018/)
---
&gt;To My Side reveal thread. That doesn't even include all the lazy memes like the one posted here making fun of it. Sure, you could cherry pick a couple people who saw it's potential, but it's absolutely revisionist history to say "Everyone knew at the time that To My Side could be great if Spell Hunter ever became possible." Not even close. It's pretty well documented how few saw it's potential, which is why I referenced it in my comment.
---
No, this isn't true. They're not actually *saying* why they think the card sucks, but it's pretty clear from the memes that it's the condition. At the very least, I'm not seeing any posts saying that it'd be real weak without the condition.
---
And why would it not? 3 mana summon 1 companion was seen as strong, 9 mana summon 3 was seen as strong, but you really think people thought 6 mana summon 2 - without the condition - was seen as super ultra weak?
---
&gt;That's an incredibly closed minded statement, which is the point of my post. I'm certainly not saying it's good currently, as I wouldn't put it in any deck or archetype that is currently known. But I'm willing to acknowledge that many seemingly bad cards have found a way to be played under the right set of circumstances. Perhaps we don't know what that set of circumstances is yet.
---
Would you like to suggest some possible circumstances then?
---
Posts lucky hearthstone videos on youtube
---
 Darksun#1904 - NA - trade 80g quest. you go first. quick trades. you can win both games for quests 
---
Only if the opponent cheats lackeys in your hand while you are selecting. 
---
Yeah but shaman generally wants board control and its scheme kills minions on both sides. I want to see this in action first, and with what other cards exist, but I'm hesitant to say it would be played even at 3 mana until I see good synergy. 
---
Ultrasaur can survive a direct hit from Deathwing. He’s like

&gt;Holy shit that hurt

Instead of like
---
&gt;Holy shit I’m dead
---
Ya peter acted like he had a school boy crush on her awkward
---
Yeah idk if I'm just unlucky, sometimes they dont have geist but most the time they tech it. Cause there's still a lot of good 1 mana spells in wild that it counters. I dont find mill rogue broken at all though. Aggro just stomps it, but havent really found any good control or otk decks against it. Probably just gonna end up playing tempo and midrange decks cause I've been seeing a lot more around rank 10.
---
Except one of those options cost 40 mana.
---
A while back,  warlock was the one without any reveal  until 3 days before release. Glad the torch is passed around this year.  
---
Nailed it!
---
I didn’t appreciate it at the time. You never know what you have till it’s gone. 
---
Easy inclusion for Murloc Mage
---
The art with the effect is very awful and this card is garbage just like [[purity]] when it was released. 
---
Yeah but that adds more cards... And then the opponent might have deathrattles. I am looking at it for a more "competitive" standpoint, so I may be misunderstanding the whole point.
---
I quit MtG around Urza block and it was not that "power creep" at the time, but I guess it's because previous decks were still pretty strong in the meta.
---
Better than only putting one of everything in your deck and praying to draw a legendary that still wouldn’t clear the board

---
Would you... Omegamind it?
---
The fact that people who spectate still have to do some hamfisted overlay bullshit to see both players hands is amazingly ridiculous lol.
---
yeah, but what about the other cards. Case in point, my example that pissed me right off:
---
I crafted the legendaries needed to make Highlander Priest (kazakus, Anduin DK, and Prophet Velen). 
---
I got the deck two weeks and then it got nerfed. I got dust back for Raza---the only one I already had.
---
I spent 4800 dust (basically all of it) to have my deck get shit all over....and not get anything back except a, metaphorical, "sorry pat" on the back. 
---
It's not especially bad in a control deck, like basically every scheme. They aren't too good until after a lot of turns, but if you have 'em in your hand, then you just are able to gain a lot near the end. The point of schemes are literally to be terrible until a couple of turns in.
---
Yeah im not sure what the issue is, walk the plank, vanish, sap, cheapshot is enough to draw games out, esp with dagger
---
Start from 1, most likely
---
Everyone has to play with any system, if that was enough to be fair then any system would be fair. One could argue if the results of a run are too far from a players skill that could be unfair. I don’t know why you keep saying there would be no variance in such a new system. There would be less variance, the question is would that be bad enough to warrant not looking into? I think the constructed argument is weak. Constructed style/quality decks would still be extremely different than arena. I don’t know why you only think hardcore players would play closer to their mean, all players would be closer to their mean which is arguably more fair but potentially less interesting.
---
Thought about crafting him for this reason but I am pouring all my dust into HoF cards right now (and dusting every soon to be wild card I've got since I don't wild) so might have to wait.  
---
Reveals stream is the worst stream
---
It would actually be reall fun if it upgrades enough. Imagine flinging 20 or 30 missiles randomly, like a mini yog
---
This game *could* last forever if Blizzard got their shit together and started releasing actual card game features. 
---
Should be: summon 1 boom bot
---
Well,  if any class can make this mechanic work,  it's warrior. Afterall, slow control fits will with bomb mechanics
---
The others so far only take 2 turns tops to be "average." Every turn beyond that they become excellent.
---
This takes at least 11 turns to become comparable to any other armor gain or heal spell.
---
I think it was more the previous power level of mammoth that meant so many cards have no relevance in recent metas.  
---
Once these card rotate and we're left with less powerful cards it could (and fuck I hope it does) lead to far more interesting and thought out matches as opposed to the RNG fest we have right now.  
---
I personally really enjoying watching a paladin game fold out for 20 minutes getting to see all the new cool paladin cards
---
Made for a really fun and enticing experience, constantly exceeding my expectations 
---
With the upcoming rotation I would not be surprised if mechs and magnetic will see more mainstream play. And I am betting that my favorite Boomsday mech, Weaponized Pinata, would find its place in tier 1/2 decks.
---
GQLLFM
---
But whhhhhy?  We just went through 2017 of overpowered, swing turn, auto win shitfest decks; they purposefully lowered the power level in 2018 cards, and then release this??  It's super easy to trigger and the treasure cards when choosable are just broken.  It honestly makes me not even want to bother with the xpac after all.
---
Just thinking now, Imagine if there is a minion gain x attack as the amount of armor you gained this turn, than this card would be used, or a giant discounted by armor ( what would be unbalanced, but could be armor gained this turn, what could make this card interesting...). Just thinking. I still think the original  idea was related to bombs on your opponent deck (it's the warrior idea for this expansion) and that would be out of hand, so they just created this filler card. Even the art is related to bombs, nothing on armor.
---
unclear. zul’jin casts upgraded spellstones
---
Glad you could bake it, Uther.
---
Can someone tell me why pile of bombs and dynamites is supposed to give you armor?
---
I'm not sure about boring. Dr Boom Hero with the Boom Legendary, the weapon that shuffles in bombs, seaforium bomber, and the new mech bomber which can be found via Discover hero power or Omega Assembly. Plus you can shuffle in extras with Augmented Elekk!
---
I'm excited for the archetype. I also play Wild so I'll be using Coldlight Oracle and Brann and Iron Juggernaut too!
---
I agree it’s bad - I said specifically that it’s barely reasonable at turn 10... around turn 15 it’s starting to edge out in value... then finally it’s worth playing at turn 20+...
---
It’s bad... only possibly viable as a one-of in extremely niche fatigue decks.
---
This is bad card design since it is so explicitly limited in use.
---
It's the combination of a few things, but I think the two most significant factors are the casual nature of the game (and what kind of audience that attracts) and the nature of F2P models in general.
---
One of the central tenants of Hearthstone that made it such a huge success is the casual simplicity that runs through the mechanics and interface. This drew in a huge, diverse audience including a ton of people who never played (or at least *seriously* played) a competitive card game before. As a result, I think Hearthstone has a very card game-illiterate audience. That sounds really dismissive, but I don't mean it in a condescending way. I simply mean that there are things people who physical and more complex card games like Magic learn about their game, card game design, and game design in general as a result of how those differences affect the way people play.
---
Magic's design team is extremely transparent compared to most game companies I know. The lead designer, Mark Rosewater, has been writing about Magic and game design for over a decade now and posts it all for free on the Magic website. He has a Tumblr blog where he answers dozens of questions almost every single day. He's so pressed for time yet motivated to share his knowledge that he records podcasts about the game and design on his way to work.
---
And while I'm sure only a small minority of Magic's total audience actually reads or listens to these things, the nature of Magic as a physical game that is more complex than most naturally brings players together in person while attracting the sort of people who crave this kind of information and sharing it. So even if you're a super casual Magic player, you might end up hearing some of these design insights from other players just as a natural result of playing the game.
---
In Hearthstone, this doesn't really happen and wouldn't likely happen to the same degree even if Team 5 made an effort to be more transparent. That's because the game is far more casual, entirely digital, and naturally attracts a smaller minority of players who would bother to concern themselves with this kind of information.
---
As a result, you have players who are very passionate about the game yet don't really know much about its design, the design of other card games, or games in general. When you're in that kind of position, you don't know what you don't know to the point that things that can be very beneficial to the game seem terrible. A good example is why bad cards need to exist or why it's not a great to buff cards. It makes sense at first to make sure all the cards are good and to "fix" the ones that end up falling short. But there are all kinds of issues with this approach that would likely hurt the game rather than help it.
---
Another example is nerfs and their effects on the meta. Look at the Giggling Inventor round of nerfs. People threw a fit because "Druid wasn't touched" outside of maybe Token Druid. On the surface, it makes sense that if a deck or class is problematic, you nerf that deck or class directly. But if you look at what happened, Druid fell out of the top tier almost completely following the nerf because metas are far more complex than that.
---
The other factor is the nature of F2P economies. We've spent most of our lives purchasing things through a traditional economy where you simply pay for what you want. And considering the casual nature of Hearthstone I mentioned, a large number of people associate the game more with traditional video games than they do card games even though Hearthstone has way more in common with paper card games than it does traditional video games. As a result, some players naturally quantify the amount of content you get in Hearthstone for the price you'd normally pay to get a full video game and find Hearthstone extremely lacking. But these comparisons almost never take the F2P nature of game or the differences between it and traditional video games into consideration.
---
In general, in a F2P model you get more for nothing but less for something. That's because you're already getting something just for showing up. Sure, you can view what you get for your cash in isolation from what you get for free and apply a personal value to that investment, but you can't expect an entire game as big as Hearthstone to cater to your personal value, especially when you're not taking the full picture into consideration. There are a lot of players who play for free or close to it and still manage to have a great time and be competitive. Even a tiny adjustment toward more value for your dollar could have a huge, negative effect on profit for a game like this.
---
A lot of people apply the argument that if they made things cheaper, more people would pay, increasing profits overall. But I think these people ignore that it's often a much more favorable situation needing to rely on relatively few people making a large investment than it is relying upon a large number of people making a small investment. What sounds easier, selling a skin for ten bucks to eight people or selling eighty packs with a golden legendary and a skin to one person for eighty bucks?
---
Sorry for being so long winded, but I spend a lot of time on this sub and think about and discuss this topic quite often. I don't always have an opportunity to share these thoughts, and when I do, they're often downvoted to hell, but I think this exactly why Hearthstone gets so much hate in general. Of course there have been legitimate issues with the meta that I think are finally getting resolved and there's just the outrage culture of the internet in general to consider as well.
---
I’ve done it. Surprised you’ve done warrior as it took me significantly more tries as warrior than any of the others 
---
Since his combo doesn’t include Khadgar, I’d guess he means currently in Standard.
---
\[Theorycraft\] If the original ideal was to shuttle bombs into your opponent deck, like those new cards/possible archetype is it would be op even on 10 mana. It would be a OTK deck, and frankly a quite powerful one. having a ultra defensive deck ( possible for warrior only with the standard + year of raven cards already, in a world without rexxar/jaina and infinity resources) and dropping this when your opponent is on fatigue/few cards away from fatigue would be OTK.
---
The good 'ol Prep tax.
---
Uther DK, um Ok...
---
They did give Warrior a new Omega card in Omega Devastator, so that theme was covered.
---
Where are those droid E.M.P. Operative dekas????
---
*Cough* the entire yotR *cough*
---
I agree with this.
---
This was an absolute disaster of a reveal stream, the worst one they've ever done. But it's wrong to place the blame entirely on any one person's shoulders.
---
All the criticism this stream rightfully deserves should be leveled at the whole group responsible for it.
---
I think you phrased that slightly wrong, the card art isn't bad but simply completely unfitting.
---
My point was that, within the design space of gaining armor, this card is significantly different from the vast majority. A card like Shield Block plays a specific role in decks it appears in, a role that is likely very different from the role Boom's Scheme would ever play, and shouldn't be called "worse than" since it's apples and oranges.
---
I guess it was originally about BOOM parts.
---
But that's because Spellstones change their card names and art when upgrading. So each possible state of a Spellstone is treated as a unique, individual card. Greater Emerald Spellstone is its own card that reads "Summon 4 3/3 wolves.", so if that's the card you played then that's the card Zul'jin will cast. I think because the schemes don't change into new cards when upgrading (I assume), it will most likely cast the first turn/unaltered version.
---
puresin#2558 NA trading 80g quests.  I show you mine, you go first.
---
I think you can fit both packages into the same deck and make something midrange.  We’re losing a LOT of cards.  If you use the rush package (7-10 cards) and the bomb package (5-7 cards revealed so far) you still have a lot of space for classic staples and maybe some mechs.   I’ll be trying that deck on day 1 for sure.  
---
All of the bomb synergy cards revealed so far are low tempo (3 mana 3/3 and 4 mana fiery war axe). So this has to fit into some sort of control archetype. But since when has control warrior cared about face damage, especially if it has to sacrifice deck slots that could be filled with aoe and removal for it? I hate that Blizzard is trying to force this "bomb" archetype when they should just be printing solid (but flavorful) cards for warrior.
---
True, but you would have to get the card early on for this to remotely work. Drawing a 10 mana card that shuffles a bomb into your opponent’s deck would be incredibly bad but still true to the art.
---
Purify was 100% better because it made a high class meme video.
---
"Grandpa, why would you put this card in your deck?" 
---
Hope im not the only one thinking about Goblin Slayer right now...
---
*cries in freeze shaman*
---
It's already out i think, but it won't use Dota 2 hero models.
---
The difference is that Paladin is a class that is actually SUPPOSED to use large minions as defensive options or closing power in the late game. "Minion Mage" is not going to be a thing, no matter how much Blizzard tries to push it.
---
Paladin has been crap for long stretches in Hearthstone history. They were one of the weakest classes before GvG gave them Minibot and Muster, and once those cards rotated out Paladin went back into the dumpster for the entirety of the Year of the Kraken. They were decent in Un'Goro and KFT, but not amazing.
---
KnC and WW are the first times when Paladin has been the definitive kings of the meta since the Challenger days of TGT. They really aren't a class that's problematic or boring.
---
Everyone is shitting on this card without realizing its true potential.
---
I think it's gonna see tier 2 play eventually.
---
Totally agree but as I origanally said people some are being mean for the sake of it and making stupid jokes and it bugs me if your going to write a critisism comment then at least put the comment in to context like I felt I did. I'm not a fan of what they did in stream it was a travesty but personal attacks are not right.  
---
RATS
---
Most of the time Khadgar is near you he is teleporting dozens of people out of trouble at a time, effortlessly massacring dozens of enemies with surges of arcane energy, and basically spearheading the efforts of Azeroth to stop your enemies in two whole expansions.
---
His card stats are mean he is literally a tiny bit healthier than a single iteration of a walking, replicating pumpkin. If the squashling was hit him in the face, that pumpkin would slaughter hearthstone khadgar. 
---
The difference is hilarious. It’s not a huge issue, i like the card but maybe this card could’ve been called something like “Arcane Defence Protocol”, and Khadgar could’ve been something different. Having him share Antonidas’ stats with an effect like “every time you cast a spell, cast greater arcane missiles at random enemy minions” would’ve worked
---
Most definitely. It's another card that could work, especially if you can get 1-2 ET discounts for it.
---
That much I haven't worked out yet. There is no way this wasn't a deliberate strategy though. Others have pointed out it probably has something to do with extending the stream for more live viewers and more advertising revenue. I don't know though.
---
Why do I feel like it was supposed to shuffle bombs in the opponent's deck?
---
So due to your own anecdotal evidence that means it's false?
---
You're delusional if you think it's false. Besides the fact that there are some people in the highest level of tournament play who don't come close to having a full collection of cards, there are hundreds of videos/streams of people starting fresh accounts and getting Legend without buying one pack.
---
You're either trolling or willfully ignorant.
---
[[Purify]]
---
It is really significantly worse though.  Deck struggled as is, then we lost hallucinate.
---
&gt; So any amount spent is lost
---
You can immediately and consistently turn cards into other cards. You can't do that in physical games. Extremely rare cards can be worthless in a physical card game, and even if you have something work some money, you have to put time and effort into getting anything close to the value it's worth.
---
Also, saying Hearthstone is priced like a physical card game is just plain false.
---
Did we see all the upgrades yet? 
---
Paladin was terrible all throughout the Year of the Kraken.
---
At least you only need to kill one body 1 time instead of 16 like with old cubelock + Malganis + coined Naga sea witch + 50 8/8 giants on t4 with 40/40 of stats on board with no clear. Old Wild Cubelock / NagaLock was so disgusting. 
---
That is one of the best ideas I’ve heard. And I’m subbed to custom hearthstone
---
There is literally never not aggro in the meta
---
For me it's the art style and overall feeling of the game. Hearthstone has good paced animations and the feeling of weight like when you attack with 6+ attack or summon something fat. Shadowverse feels like an early 2000s game with highly saturated colors and effects.
---
It’s non legendary, so you can have 2 in your deck. Even a few turns, let’s say, 4-5 it would be ridiculous amount of damage.
---
Punishment for 1 year of Odd Paladin
---
Of course Iron Hide is bad. I'm saying that this Scheme is even WORSE.
---
BIO! got play in DMH Fatigue warrior where you could continuously cycle your 10 armour boosts into you deck when it was very thin, because at that point the minion cost redux didn't matter as much as gaining 10 armour every couple turns.
---
This card would need to sit in your hand for 10 turns to get the same effect, while costing double.
---
They don't want to play 7s. Vinecleaver and Rag are way better, that's why they make the cut. Stormwind Champ is a much better 7 drop in odd paladin than Boom and yet regularly doesn't make the cut. There's a reason odd rogue doesn't run 7s. Dr. Boom is just blatantly not a powerful card by today's standards. It's a completely fair midrange curve topper in a world where midrange doesn't exist and everyone's doing super broken stuff.
---
I’m assuming their lore is that Khadgar is leading recruitment for the Defense of Dalaran. 
---
Not out of character for him, not also not what he’s known for
---
Even if they're vanilla stat balls, you could at least talk about the theme, character and art of the card. 
---
Yeah and I miss him.  Everything is riding on this expansion - between the new set, the massive rotation + massive hall of fame update (genn/baku + more), he has to play a bit of HS again, even if just for a few days, right?
---
I guess what I'm saying is that if this doesn't pull him back at all, nothing will.
---
This is insane value! Just wait 30 turns then boom 4 mana 30 armor. Even better than Reno “gonna be rich” jackson himself
---
Too bad, you’re dead by then

Wait is this not a jojo reference?

FIRST YOU PLAY KHADGAR

---
Hello future cats!
---
Let's be real. Artifact should have been f2p from the get go
---
Big Hand mage was one of decks of this set.
---
Yeah on second thought it might be too strong. Especially as a finisher when you start to hit fatigue. Pop that card twice for 15+ damage per bomb, one shot that rez priest.
---
Power creep oof
---
But at least it's a bad meme deck instead of just bad.
---
Clearly the ramifications of not being able to interact with your opponents on their turn have finally come to a head. Without it, there's just so much less room for innovation.
---
He clearly wasn’t zoo :(
---
Yeah I was thinking about it more and it would definitely be OP.
---
Maybe another alternative would be shuffle 1 boom bot into the opponents deck, with it scaling up.
---
Screw up their deck with alright minions, similar to weasel tunneler. Could be useful vs things like Rez Priest
---
The suggestion is just a remix of the Warlock scheme so I doubt they would want to repeat it; putting 1 bomb in opponents deck (upgrade each turn) is an idea that would never have left the design board.
---
My idea is 'explode 1 Bomb in opponent's deck (Upgrade each turn)'. Overpowering but requires some set up and fits into the idea of the art. It's also an idea that's hard to implement and scrapped halfway through.
---
You followed “they don’t want to play 7s” with two different examples of 7s that they play.  
---
Love the Rick's. Love the Morts. +1 as I poop, play and drink 
---
Do 1 damage to a random character (upgrades each turn) would be flavorful, though 4 mana is still a lot for the effect
---
I see what you mean now
---
How about 4 sylvanas/ imperators thaurizan?
---
Fair comment, but IMO it would be worth the investment. 
---
No thank you. For a player like me the heroic brawls = "no brawl for a week".
---
Not that I think they should never happen, they are definitely fun for some people. I just would never ask for them to happen more frequently.
---
I think at 1 mana it *may* see play. 2 or more it won't. 0 mana would probably be OP
---
Maly Rogue, Deathrattle Rogue and Big Rogue all beg to differ.
---
interesting isn't the word I'd use. You'd be a mage or warlock or priest playing a control game against a warrior, get them to fatigue, have a big advantage and then just die instantly because they had two Schemes and shuffled them both in. That's horrendous gameplay. The card would be utterly degenerate if any fatigue deck exists, which it would to take advantage of such a broken card. It would also be extremely highrolly - the games would come down entirely to whether the warriors drew them early enough to OTK you.
---
Had to scroll far too long to find this comment, but i'm glad you are out here wutangoku :)
---
Also it means that even if you open a good card it’s useless without all of the other cards you need to make up the deck that it goes in. 
---
It's cool because the old treasures barely saw any play and they are cool af
---

---
If this post is up, it means I'm still looking! 
---
It's hard to imagine a card so narrow that it would not only buff this scheme into playability but also over a card like shield block or iron hide. It would have to be designed so it only affected the scheme, but blizzard doesn't typically design cards this narrow and specific.
---
Verdict: unlikely.
---
You ain't wrong I just dont know what. This was great as my reflexes for twitch shooters suck now.  Recommends? I'm sad artifact failed lol. 
---
Oh, you're a villain alright. Just not a super one!
---
A two card combo that does 30+ and can't be interrupted? If warrior wants to go to fatigue, it can go to fatigue.
---
TGT, right? Wasn’t Justicar from TGT?
---
He was an incredible public face for the company. People like that naturally get tons of credit and little blame.
---
I'm not saying he brought more bad than good to the game in terms of design, just that I hate the baseless conspiracy theory that he was jumping from a sinking ship when it's far more believable that he was presented with an opportunity to be part of a new company he would have a major stake in.
---
If you criticize women you are _automatically_ a misogynist. That's how it works, get with times.
---
heartharena tier list, there are multiple 3/5s with near useless effects above silvermoon guardian
---
Thanks I've been playing them for the better part of my life and am used to being disappointed, like when [Ludevic, Necro-Alchemist](http://manabasecrafter.com/commander/ludevic-necro-alchemist) was finally released as a card in MTG and it turns out the \*\*necro-alchemist\*\* just draws you cards. But for the most part MTG does a really good job at capturing the essence of a character in their card. This? What does Khadgars card have to do with Khadgar lol it's laughable.
---
Talking can be good, it’s this pandering baby shit that is unwatchable 
---
Runespear can do some insane stuff if you high roll at least, and you have 3 chances to do so.
---
Boom's scheme should have been to summon a 1/1 boombot for every turn the card was in your hand (so more like rafaam's) and ~~nefarious~~ rafaam's should have been something different entirely....namely "shuffle X curse of rafaam's into your deck.  When a curse is drawn, put a curse of rafaam into your opponent's deck, draw a card, and deal 2 damage to the opponent."  Something like that.
---
Chances are, this was more or less planned at least as far as the reveal season for The Witchwood. New sets for card games begin development roughly a year if not longer before they're even announced. The AMA will maybe have a serious effect on new designs for December's set at the very earliest.
---
With the cards that have dominated the last two years of play leaving Standard, no one knows what exactly will be viable in the format in less than a month now. Giving players some amount of context with designs similar to older ones may make the whole process far less jarring than it would be otherwise. It can also act as a sort of soft reboot for the whole of the game after the event that was last year.
---
Given that Hearthstone is a collectible card game, and most collectible card games you can think of started in the nineties or early two thousands and still manage to find new ways to feel fresh, I doubt Team 5 is out of ideas for the game. The only thing that stops a CCG's design team from doing new things is themselves and how far they're willing to push design.
---
Also, rushing to conclusions as to what the Rise of Shadows solo content is exactly before having more to go off of than about two paragraphs of text will also ultimately prove to be foolhardy.
---
lol
---
and still worse than UI
---
And Warrior can't deal with early game threats or finish off 1 HP minions with their Hero Power
---
I don't believe the concept behind the card is the atk and hp. Combo it...
---
Cool I agree with you as long as they would represent Khadgar in any way in his card I would be okay with it but as it stands it might just as well have been any other character for as much sense it makes.
---
And also the new Hunter legendary supports bombs too
---
In what way does this card represent Khadgar as a warcraft character? 
---
i duno why the fuk ppl always grab the most pixelated version of a card with improper aspect ratios to put in their posts
---
Toggwaggle at the end: "So many treasures! Heh hah - now to be showing them to Rafaam..."
---
That makes sense.
---
How about Khadgar [the Shitty Wizard](https://youtu.be/z1j2BMPe7L0?t=133)
---
in fairness, at least Duskfallen has some funny edge cases from being summoned randomly or meme potential. IT sucks but it's not boring as fuck. This is just idiotic, and basically is 4 mana do nothing at almost every stage of the game and takes insane time to gain value. It must have been a last minute change.
---
Espionage is currently the only deck I'm playing.  Not because I only play rogue, or only play any one class...it's just the most fun deck I have by far.  Always a different game.
---
Why do you want them drawn sooner? 5 damage in the early/mid game is nothing. You want it at the end when they're out of resources to armor up/heal.
---
There's been shit cards in the reveal streams of every set, don't worry
---
Where's my favourite glampire at? 
---
I hate it. It punishes an aspect of the game I can't control with unpreventable damage. Bombs should be hard to pull off, creating a million bomb maker cards will just create an entirely uninteractive experience for the opponent. It's legitimately stupid on the level of Shudderwock.
---
Temporus synergy for sure 
---
Auto chess is fun for a week.
---
I wish man. I’ve given up expecting anything new from this game and gone back to playing Tabletop Magic. At least then when I’m done I can sell my cards with the possibility for a profit.
---
Why every class can be strong but no Warrior? Why?!
---
Brode was replaced by Chode
---
I disagree. I think schemes need to be online so to speak and be worth their mana after 2-3 turns max. That's about where the other schemes become worth their mana compared to similar effects. 
---
This bad boy needs 10+ turns to be considered fair for its cost compared to previous healing and armor gain spells. Warrior also has the 5/5 dragon, armorsmith and the 1/3 mech for armor gain if a meta developed that we need THAT much armor. 
---
This card should probably cost 0 and even then it wouldn't be stellar. It would need 3 turns to be on par with the healing spell regenerate and would be more in line with the other schemes timeframe. 
---
I can't think of a single card that could have its cost reduced by 4 and still only be "ok". Even purify at 1 mana would have being a combo staple and at 0 would be auto-include. 
---
It'd be like annoy-o-tron but worse. I'd shoot myself now (or just stop playing)
---
Makes more sense if you don't see it as cloning but instead summoning/teleporting in reinforcements.
---
Janalai is already played in some big spell decks.
---
Hmm yesterday had come to me 3 packs but today there are no 3 packages. Is it normal? Because they said: **Login between March 25 and April 2 to get free packs.** I don't get that **o\_O** 
---
Have they ever retconned the art on a card? (Other than Jaina, I guess)
---
Which was bad for design space because it meant every deck autoincluded the "alright on curve" and "dicks all cards with 7+ attack completely from the meta forever" everything else. On a neutral card.
---
If they printed OG BGH as as class card in an expansion so it was only around for a rotation that would be less bad, but still not great. Its core to the game to want to play big stuff and do big things. The era of BGH was defined by the top end being Boulderfist Ogre.
---
Booms scheme is one of the worst cards in recent memory I mean like... it couldn’t start at like 5? God damn man...
---
That you for being real while the rest of the sheep here circlejerk. I would say the Brode streams were better than these but yes they've always sucked.
---
Maybe if we just give them more money, it would motivate them to print better cards! :D
---
Unique effects also make epic cards likely to be reevaluated in the future. Remember when Nether and Far Sight were terrible, terrible meme cards?
---
Just allow us to make our own tavern brawls with cards we “own”.
---
Feels bad for those F2Ps with Legendary cards in classes they don’t play.
---
If they at least allowed us to play Cross-Class at the bare minimum of friendly match. Don’t give the players too much control over what they “own”.
---
PS: you don’t actually “own” your collection 🙄🙄
---
It would work on any deck, you'd be the one shuffling bombs into them.
---
Inb4 this gets removed by the mods.
---
You're definetely right about the community not being able to predict what the game will look like in two weeks, but I feel like there are some pretty evident signs that Team 5 may be actually running out of ideas for now. 
---
It's been a while since we've seen something actually new. Quests, Hero Cards and KnC's legendary weapons were arguably the last bits of impactful innovation being implemented to in-game strategies, and that was more than a year ago. When you think of last year's mechanics, most of them were somewhat bland reinterpretations of things that already existed, like magnetic buffs and rush, or not quite good enough to make real impact, like shrines and legendary spells. Even/Odd decks obviously stood out from the rest, but the concept of discounting and upgraded hero powers as a payoff was a thing since TGT.
---
The whole point of the new expansion being about old mechanics doesn't help either. A new Dr. Boom that does almost the same as his old card? Toggwaggle being a better version of a meme card that just rotated? And there's also Rafaam who's basically Golden Monkey on crack. The only villain card that doesn't scream lazy design and really brings something new to the table is Hagatha. Sure, Jan'alai as a Rag reprint in RR was kinda cool, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
---
I think with the rotation, the game will be at a slow enough spot that some of those cards will see play. Whether for better or worse, it would seem that there are less impactful 1 and 2-drops. That's really good for Mage as Mage has had issues with early game lately. I think it will really depend on what tools Rogue gets. They're probably in the best spot with regards to tempo currently. Warlock may still have Zoo to fall back on but with the removal of Doomguard, I think they'll struggle to keep their footing.  Hopefully Khadgar can finally redeem himself after being such a shit wizard
---
Man, I was looking forward to the drinking game, "Every time Kibler interrupts a developer." Guess I'll be doing a "drink every time there is a bug" next time instead.
---
But those decks have Jaina. Is control mage going to exist when Jaina rotates?
---
All of the lackeys have been revealed.  I heard this too but obviously was something different or incompetence.
---
I doubt this bug will be present at launch but just goes to show you how the development of HS has been.  Less people playing, cant get more recognizable streamers to come in, etc etc.
---
I didn't think of that. But I'm glad I didn't. The screenshot was worth it.
---
Maybe. Considering priest and warlock lose most of their control tools.
---
People are shitting on it because it’s a shit card. It’s taking something control warrior can already easily do and putting it on an overcosted card that can’t be played until the end of the game. Purify and To My Side both had potential, this card doesn’t do anything new, it does something other cards can do but worse. 
---
I think we had the bad variant of cards in WOG kinda of and here we go again and probably they will keep doing so because they ran out ideas and in a desperate need of me helping them but unfortunately I am too busy to do so.
---
Ok I see what you’re saying but would you rather have a superficial face of some douche who has no say in design or a dude like peter who is a senior designer with some support? I think the stream would have been fine if they just had better people. Like dude pay toast kibler krip or shit even some less known streamers with good followings and good personalities. They really should have done that. They don’t need to get rid of peter they need to find better support 
---
But it doesn't fit the art. Maybe shuffle X bombs that do 1 damage when drawn?
---
Lol you weren’t around when Purify was released I see. Or at least not on this Subreddit
---
Decks that thin themselves already have an in-game mechanic that punishes them, it's called Fatigue. And Warrior is naturally strong with Fatigue already. Rogues don't have a consistent source of healing in Standard, they're never allowed to play Control or any sort of long deck just because Warrior exists. It sucks.
---
You won’t be building Even/Odd decks in Standard after the rotation...there’s loads of synergy here.
---
Except that one time he was overly enthousiastic in revealing Artifact.
---
Okay. I had to go down the rabbit hole. I love this link. This is nothing at all different than someone being white and claiming to be black because they "feel like they should have been born black". Then someone says,  "well... you're white". Then police swing by and arrest you.
---
I've bought the last 4 expansion preorders. I'm gonna wait on this one.
---
Yeah just lazy design, the trademark of the new Blizzard that abandons their good games to give us Diablo Imortal.
---
Anyone know if there will be a new hero legendary this expansion?
---
So I don't need to look for a team??? I can just register?
---
Compare that to the World of Warcraft system. You have to pay a subscription to keep playing and you can develop one character at a time. You can spend months gearing up a single character while paying a subscription to do it.
---
In Hearthstone you can pay an equivalent amount and craft all the cards for a single class.
---
No but you don't keep it as a dead card in your opening hand and plan to play it later as a top deck or something you play close to drawing 
---
Ye in reality thats infinite value u just need to play stuff
---
Yup, I think maybe once every 2 months or so we have a Tavern Brawl that is actually good and repayable where it doesn't give solved almost immediately. I think the last one was the one the card pool was from a few random expansions.
---
Reno bacc
---
The card art makes no sense at all, it'd be better if he was paneling a mech or something but piling bombs doesn't equate to armour to me
---
Fortunate Son intensifies.
---
Sorry u Had to zoom ;(
---
You will never please everyone.  Reddit is merely a sampling of if more people agree or disagree with an idea.  Just because it is upvoted doesn't mean people don't also disagree. (and vice versa)
---
* It's too late to tell developers what we want, this set is locked in.  And I personally don't feel they listen very much. (or they disagree with community suggestions and don't communicate it).
---
* The better the game state is, the happier people will be.  If we have a good/balanced meta, meta complaint posts are usually downvoted or pushed down.  But because we've had two stale sets (Boomsday/Rastakahn) , people are already upset and were more critical.
---
* Technical issues happen but that just puts more pressure on the team to carry the broadcast.  I think it feel short but the livestream success has no correlation to the set strength or design.
---
I'm all for staying positive when a company has a strong track record or earned it.  But after this past year, and very few updates to the client, I'm personally more pessimistic towards Blizzard.
---
Perhaps you can try getting more steam surgers through Simulacrum, which will give you more geysers or replace Fireball with something more useful (like 2nd anomaly)
---
Getting him from this spell will still be good
---
I honestly don't even know what you just said.
---
Sometimes it's just about fatigue.
---
Its not about beeing a Caster makes you bad for this.
---
But you should get out of your Caster-self for a reveal stream... The reason I enjoyed Day9 so much was because he was very exited and did basicly everyting he could with the new cards. Like multiple clicks to hear the exact the attack sounds and stuff.
---
This card need to cost 2 or 3 mana. Even with 3 mana i think nobody will play it.
---
Just don't pick meteorologist...
---
Because these days even Blizzard accept that he's a pretty shit wizard.
---
THIS DARKK MANE REFERENCE XD LOVE YOU FOR THAT
---
Why not do 4 more dmg with reckless rocketeer?
---
Who is the Hench-Clan and why do they have all the good cards?
---
Him being one of the main faces (if not *the* main face) of MtG:Arena certainly won't help either.
---
Any damage coming from a Scheme must only affect minions, period.
---
I meant it more in a sense, that he will take up a slot in the discover pool rather often. Discover bias towards class cards and that that. Arcanosaur is basically the same as well, with an added elemental tag.
---
Why wouldn't you?
---
Will heal paladin take off from this? Maybe
---

---
It's an interesting design, does anyone get the feeling they are building an entire archetype on 3 cards (2 for planting bombs and one Dr.Boom).
---
I wonder if that will have an effect on their new tournament mode. You can have 25 good cards + Bomb package.
---
Seems pretty bad
---
It would’ve still been broken at 10 mana. If it was in your hand at mulligan, by turn 10 it’s 50 dmg to your opponents face and it’s very very hard to counter. Yes, they have to draw them, but now their deck is half bomb cards, so that’s very likely to happen in short order. Or you could highroll and win the game there and then, your opponent not even getting another turn. It gets better (worse?) if you wait more before playing it too. Frankly, it’d still be OP at 11 mana^in^wild.
---
Your other suggestion of minibombs is better, but now the card is too weak, if anything.

3/3/4 Beast | Whenever you shuffle a card into a deck, shuffle in an extra copy.  
---
Is this why they didn't show new Paladin cards yesterday? This is bad.
---
I would agree on that point, but I think the art on the card suggests something should explode
---
Depends. With all the synergy that this mechanic might get, this card might be really good. 
---
Did I stay awake for this 
---
Hold on Blizzard. This whole operation was your idea.
---
thanks for sharing
---
I feel like a young man of eighty

Cancer Rogue player spotted
---
Definitely seems like a Healadin card, but not even sure if it will be run there
---
Pretty sure it's common rarity not rare... 
---
Assuming that Thaddius follows regular second declension noun in latin (i.e. servus) then the plural should be Thaddii. Well actually I guess Thaddios is more suitable as the accusative plural. Let's go with Thaddios.
---
Okay, the song is legitimately good. Like, way better than it really ought to be for something this small.
---
At least I can enjoy one reveal stream today.
---
2 mana do nothing that generates another 2 mana do nothing. Even against aggro 2 mana and heal a bit won't win you the game. 2 mana heal a bit into another 2 mana heal a bit is such a huge tempo loss that every non class cannon aggro deck will push you down for it.
---
And just imagine if the other deck doesn't even care about your life total since it will just outvalue or combo you down.
---
Pretty bad card 1 star.
---
If you dont want to play anymore, just play something else. Whining on reddit won't get the devs to suddenly change how they run the game.
---
Did you overlook the fact that its warrior? Warrior can drag the game out better than anyone.
---
&gt; If you can get a way to clear your own bombs
---
Voidripper already offered that and it was bad
---
The new cars is shit, but still better than this one. I would really not like to play against this. 
---
Spooky!
---
Awesome card for getting the 4 mana 8/8 taunts active. Immortal prelate + thekal decks incoming
---
Yeah, you can silence/transform this, unlike kingsbane. Also kingsbane had "charge" and this doesnt.
---
And while prelate is on the board, they cant cast tarim/equality/shrink ray, so its way more balanced and interactive than kingsbane.
---
I said this in another post aswell. Maybe it takes r turns for the bomb to deal 5 damage and each turn after that you shuffle +1 like in turn  you would shuffle 3 bombs. And make the scheme like Idk 6 or 7 mana? 
---
Eh she was okay.i think 3 people was too much, with too much focus on playing well over hype and fun. Who cares if they play well
---
The problem with that is that its very unreliable,it'd actually have a lower winrate than exodia mage. Bombs are good in a situation where you can make sure your opponent draws them, which translates into a long gameplan where your opponent draws at average 20 or so of their cards. A burn deck wants to end by turn 6-7,and theres no way your opponent will draw the bombs fast enough for that gameplan to work.
---
The Dr Boom Hero card actually stacks armor. Not that I disagree with the general feeling that the scheme is inappropriate, though.
---
1 mana without twinspell maybe. But with twinspell, 2 mana is fair.
---
turns out I was right :D people are clueless about this game for the most part.

He could just kill you in the same turn

[Big Red Button (2): Hero Power Activate this turn's Mech Suit power!]  
---
I would much rather hear the devs talk than the guest talking over them and cutting them off.
---
so how did it turn out?
---
Have a snickers, you're not you when you're hungry
---
OTK pally got nerfed very quickly though and Even Paladin wasn't dominating ladder or anything. I like the point one of the other posters brought up: the class has had consistently good legendaries. I don't think Paladin has always been tier 1 or anything, but it has always been pretty decent at worst. 
---
But things have been shaken up for the class with the nerf to equality, so I'm interested in seeing how that's going to turn out in a new meta
---
ChuCking#2775, EU, 80g quest trade, you go first
---
This turn
---
lul :D still waiting for that dust bro
---
The 3/4 was very useful though, that cannot be understated. It made the card an auto-include in virtually any rogue deck, something I just don't see this card doing.
---
Tek ma te, Bra’tac
---
For the moment. This is the only paladin card revealed
---
This card has some synergy with: Zandalari Templar, Immortal Prelate, Thekal, Kangor, Glass Knight and most importantly, Wild Pyromancer. Why are people not at least slightly conviced this is worth a deck alot in some sort of control/Healadin? Do you want more synergy than this?
---
*My Jaws that bite, my claws that catch. How long can this go on..
---
I am just refering to your last sentence, which implies the only reason they decided to change anything was because of community pressure
---
Get them to watch *this* hearthstone reveal stream 
---
No, that's not what Khadgar does. He makes Jan'Alai summon one extra Ragnaros, he doesn't summon an extra Jan'Alai. 
---
He kinda looks like Geralt 
---
I think I can say with confidence that Kibler was the best part of this reveal stream.
---
Are you actually defending this shit card
---
These guys weren't kidding, someone put effort into the reveal
---
Well after your turn you have to wait for enemy 1, then Ally, then enemy2 before its your turn again.
---
Also, the only Allied Hearthstone is those Tavern brawls where both players work together to kill a boss (super stacked minion).
---
Here is an interesting take, the copy of this spell counts as a separate spell for the purposes of Zul'Jin.
---
This means you can go turn 6 with Unleash the Beast, turn 7 with it's copy and at turn 10 you cast Zul'Jin and get back 2 5/5 rush minions AND the "echo" copy on your hand (as a by-product of Zul'Jin casting the twinspell version)
---
I expect lots of complains about Zul'Jin in the future. 
---
At least the rarity is common. You don't get mad when your epic card turns out to be this.
---
lol, me too. Kong Fu Panda was a good movie
---
Just too much talking in general imo. Maybe they were nervous about his chat would respond to a bad play, but Christ they roped every turn trying to figure out the best thing to do. They should have just focused on having fun. 
---
in the reddit?
---
Maby make It like a 6 mana summan 1 boombot upgrades each turn or something like That. Or Even Better 4 mana summan a 1/1 boombot upgrades each turn 
---
It is totally canon, yes. It is part of his dark and mysterious past that he became the most esteemed engineer for inventing the Babyhands Ray!
---
Discovered minions are much better than average minions.
---
Fun fact, trolden means "the troll" in danish
---
I think this is correct
---
And inaccurate, it's a spell that summons a 5/5 sure but that's the limit of it's comparison.
---
On stream yesterday they said Twinspell is the mechanic exclusively used by the good guys. Are hunters actually good guys, then? NotLikeThis
---
Overall a decent value card for non-aggressive decks, unlikely to be abused apart from a Zul'jin power turn.
---
We got nothing for Prelate last expansion because Prelate itself was last expansion.
---
Why wouldn't they make the interaction more clear though? Just change the text from "Upgrades each turn" to "upgrades at the end of your turn".
---
That would also prevent confusion as to whether or not it'd upgrade at the end of your opponents turn. I know that's not the case but the wording doesn't make that clear. 
---
Now that's some special armour!
---
I think every response is either "this is amazing" or "this is dogshit".
---
Anyone doubting the power of the card needs to remember in standard almost all high power level cards are rotating. Heal paladin will be left with a fairly solid core. This card will 100% see play most likely as a 1 of in control paladin. Way, way, way too many synergies between Glass Knight, Wild Pyro, Templar, Thekal, Prelate, etc. Plus there will obviously be decent neutral or paladin taunts to throw this on.
---
It would be stupidly easy to use at 0 or even 1 mana, and balanced at 2. Definitely sees play.
---
This is a card that powers up your finisher (Zul'jin) without losing tempo *or* card advantage. Unless you're really far behind or the enemy has a totally empty board, this is a good play.
---
It being an actual thing on the board is an advantage
---
Can blizzard lift the 7 minion cap total? Cause this is really hindering hunters who don't like rng
---
Remember that due to this being discover instead of random, you are very likely to get an above average minion each time.
---
There are soooo many simply unwinnable matchups in HS, historically. 
---
No matter what, unless the other party gets absolutely fucked, you're NOT beating an Odd Warrior with burn mage if you dont pop off with Aluneth. And there are dozens of nearly instant concede matchups throughout the 4 years I've been playing. 
---
And card games by design are heaaavily pushed closer to 50% winrates than most other games, because variance.
---
Demon Hunters and Monks when
---
You don't play Shadow Essence for the 5/5, you play it to add a monstrous minion to your rez pool. Plus in wild, you get a powerful end of turn effect with Rag or Ysaarj.
---
Well quest rotates?
---
I just think lifesteal on something like tirion comes way to late and if you have to put it on a great card to have a great effect why don't you just play more great cards?
---
Odd warrior is currently one of the best decks in the game lol nice meme 
---
Uhm, it seems that the secondary and third decks will have to share **25 cards** with the Primary, and not have at least five cards different from each other like you said. It means that they can only have up to 5 different cards. 
---
Why would you ever summon 4 Arcanosaurs? Like, what are the other two picks in that scenario?
---
They being hall of famed.
---
True. Walk The Plank is a card too so this competes with that
---
Your Shudderwock statement applies to Zul'jin too, ya know
---
Aw come on man. That’s not an argument. This card won’t see play.
---
[Hold my milk tea](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/b5orbh/from_rhearthstone/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Their way to go infinite IS prelate though. 
---
Running 2 to 4 prelate (with faceless and/or Zola shenanigans) basically give you an infinite deck. 
---
I lost hope for my prelate deck with Steed rotating out to standard, but maybe there's something to do with this card (and potentially future reveals too)
---
Well Bolf is essentially 9 armor for 6 mana, which still sucks but he also doesn't have to be in your hand for 8 turns. 
---
The Hearthstone hill is not the hill to die on.
---
Honestly the bugs were the most entertaining part of the stream.
---
This will be nerfed 3 weeks into the expansion.  Value this card brings is insane.
---
With one bomb you’re less likely to do *any* damage.
---
Obviously you cant count on bomb to win you games. You have to pressure your opponent on board as well, Dr.Boom blastmaster is terific for this job. Stacks in good 5,6 and 8 midrange minions. 
---
I disagree. Its certainly not good, but its more likely to see play than the travelling healer that was also just revealed. 
---
Gaining 15+ armor with a single card is super strong. Hard to pull off, sure, but this card can still be good in decks that plan to go super deep into fatigue or in something like DMH warrior.
---
The thing that sucked about bolster was that it was common back in the day that arena card distribution was rarity based not bucket based.
---
Bolster as an effect has seen significant play in recent metas with the 4 mana druid minion in the token druid deck.
---
glass knight too i think?
---
Yeti#21265 EU Looking to trade 80g quest. you go first but i can show quest. will remove post if i found partner.
---
The problem with it is that your win condition has to die for you to delay the fatigue
---
New best friend for dire frenzy.
---
We will see at least one clip in Trolden with hunter using dire frenzy into messenger into kalecgos into pyroblast.  
---
Shirvallah synergy
---
I did have some good use of poisonned blade outside of Rogue. 
---
Turns out if you don't have to destroy your hero power it's not that bad.
---
Blackguard+Pyro+this card on 10 could be fun.
---
And that is the only Warrior's deck that is viable right now. Also how many Warrior decks have been played in last few months? Not too many I guess. 
---
Armour is actually useful. Bolf just takes damage, and he was present the same time Antique Healbot was.
---
Dr. Boom's Scheme you could actually consider running in a Fatigue deck. Very likely not a good option, but at least if you wanted to go the extra mile it's a card that comes to mind.
---
Bolf, you never consider running in any deck.
---
No, man. Your words are not an argument. It's like seeing Master's Call only sees play because a Hunter deck is full of beasts. Greater Healing Potion can be used by any control deck and commonly sees play in Dragon Priest and Reno Priest which are the only other two Priest decks in Wild.
---
Dr. Boom's Scheme will definitely not see play but you shouldn't have compared it to Greater Healing Potion.
---
Well the thing is they made this amazing feature for standard and thought “...wild? Nah.”
---
This is going to be crazy good in Arena, Steel Rager is already a solid removal card so attaching a body to that for 2 extra mana is fine. The real value is in the Twinspell though as card generation is extremely valuable, just depends on Hunters being able to play a slower game.
---
That's great and all, but it's kind of like saying that you just learned that "Dorothee" from One Night in Karazan is based on a book, or "Julianne" and "Romulo" (from the same) are based on a play. If you're not a native english speaker it's understandable but The Jabberwocky is culturally significant, famous and celebrated. It's been made into films, TV series, featured across a variety of media; you've really never encountered it until HS?
---
Well what he said “sounded” correct and this sub is to stupid not to upvote wrong stuff. It’s like this subs super power on reddit.
---
This could easily have been 4-mana, looks like the power level for this set is going to be really low.
---
"Struggles for draw"?
---
Master's call? Flare? Tracking? Even DK Rexxar while not technically drawing still adds powerful late game tools to your hand. You also don't need to "draw" when your spells actually summon 2-4 minions and your deck can easily kill the opponent in less than 15 cards basically.
---
I literally don't know how else to describe the state of support of HS over the past couple years besides literally just barely above minimal. 
---
The ONLY significant changes I've seen in this game were the introduction of standard/wild, dungeon run, and the implementation of the bucket system in wild. And the first one they HAD to do to continue to sell packs.
---
So in 4 years I got a single player mode that was dope for like 2 months and a better arena system, conveniently locked behind a paywall. 
---
I summon Pissed Off Leokk, in attack mode!
---
PunOko
---
I’m curious whether the shuffle portion of Jade Idol will, when split, shuffle 3 OG Jade Idols into your deck, or shuffle 3 dead cards (with the exception of using it as draw with auctioneer) that say “shuffle 3 copies of this card” back into your deck
---
Is your day that ruined by a bad reveal stream that you make a hate thread for it? Things could have been better for sure, but all of this spiteful circlejerking is really toxic 
---
Not all cards from an expansion must be good
---
Good point on the order. Not only that, but at the time, priest had some flat out terrible cards. People were more upset about the fact that Purify took one of the slots away from priest. Priest of the feast and onyx bishop were pretty good as mid-game drops and for the late game. Lightbomb had just rotated out. It was rough. 
---
Incredible!
---
Because I’m lazy and don’t feel like checking exact numbers
---
Seems pretty cool but half the cards of this expansion are just recycled ideas. That kind of concerns me...
---
The real question is did you win or lose this game?
---
By having to put things in their deck that can contest the board, or atleast slightly stall, until turn 7?
---
I saw that. I didn't want to include that but it also depressing. Especially since my buying hasnt gone down. 
---
İ got deathwinged
---
So in 8 turns you would have Spreading madness? Would be more interesting but still horrendously underpowered.
---
Imagine if this could work with Minions and you had Loti after Stalladris
---
*Ratchet and Clank
---
People are sleeping on this card. This shit's nuts, you don't even need Zul'jin to make it good. Zul'Jin does give it a bit more power, but this can be played in a regular midrange hunter or beast hunter that doesn't run Zul'jin. 6 mana, 5/5, Rush, and Draw a Copy is nuts.
---
It's Spells only. I know, I made the same mistake
---
There was pretty large outcry.  The Korean community in general demanded refunds and so forth.
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1118
---
The 2/2's would be better against single-target removal, but the 4/4 would be better against AoE.
---
LUL
---
Card draw
---
Seems like an original HS character
---
Isn’t this just Fandral but takes longer for your opponent to decide?
---
lol kappa face am I right????????
---
This+ wardruid loti
---
Plus can go face
---
https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1115
---
Damn, good work guys. Only took 16 hours!
---
Warth, Druid of the Claw, Mark of Nature, Power of the Wild, Nourish, Keeper of the Grove, Ancient of War, Cenarius, Starfall, Ancient of Lore, Tending Tauren, Wardruid Loti, a few others that I had trouble telling if they rotate or not.
---
Card draw is super important in Hearthstone, and for a good Cheap Shot you likely have to spend all your mana on it. As far as tempo is concerned, Shiv is a lot better.
---
Yeah I tried it before I asked the question and unfortunately I found nothing.
---
They both arent great. Shiv is really only run in decks as a way to add card cycle - so yes, for the card draw. 
---
&gt;you're NOT beating an Odd Warrior with burn mage if you dont pop off with Aluneth. And there are dozens of nearly instant concede matchups throughout the 4 years I've been playing.
---
Exactly, but if I could side-deck in even just a few value/fatigue oriented cards the matchup becomes much more reasonable. Let that burn mage drop a few of the weaker burn spells or card draw cards out in favor of things like Jaina/Antonidas/Syndragosa/Etc and it goes from an impossible matchup to a probably still unfavored, but playable matchup.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
It's annoying that they're so stubborn about changing up ladder options.
---
Does this work with [Wardruid Loti]?
---
Hold it 3 turns to be a solid card. More to be a very good card. A bunch more to be an utterly broken card. That's the point. 
---
OBLIVION
---
Accurate argument*
---
Let's be honest it won't see any play. Unless we get some type of exodia/mill pala or an op synergy with heals I really don't see it being played. 
---
It was an indirect nerf/response to an OTK Murloc Paldin deck with Anyfin can Happen. Cards like Old Murkeye, Captain's Parrot, ETC and Gelbin were no longer standard legal since they were promo or quest reward cards. Old Murkeye was the only one that was run in an oppresive otk deck.
---
Don't forget our boy Thijs
---
For some reason I thought you were referring to glass knight and not the card in the post. Lightforged blessing could make it but indeed it can be pretty useless sometimes.
---
Makes you think when it used to cost 4 mana
---
Of all the cards that could be good in that moment, you choose the one that doesn't have an immediate impact on the board?
---
Wow. So I take it that the announcement came out of the blur? Had the Hearthstone team never previously talked about the prospect of having a rotating limited format like most other long-term CCGs like Magic?
---
twinspell = dalarans exlusive keyword... said the new brode in the reveal stream. cant remember his name lol
---
It does work with Wardruid Loti, it is a Choose One effect. It will give you 4 cards in hand.
---
In reality neither are used very often.  Shiv is a classic card though, so it's recommended for newbies because it's better than other classic cards.
---
Interesting. Are we to understand this is a "hero" card, unlike the villain legendaries? Or is this a bad guy too
---
Lol, he said trash stats; golden kobold is a 6/6 with taunt if you need stats and no RNG
---
People that disenchant Bloodmage Thalnos belong in a very special corner of hell.
---
The point I was trying to make with the math above was that if you have 10 meta decks right now (arbitrary number), if you didnt spend any money on the game, on average you would still have 8 meta decks. I didnt mean to say 15% of your collection wouldnt make any viable decks so the money you spent is useless.
---
I spent a decent amount on the game, not quite 500$ but I also gave the figures on how much more I would need to spend to get some of the meta decks.
---
Im not saying that I am not getting enough content from hearthstone. I think f2p gives plenty as it is. I just do not think the money you spend on the game improves your experience by a small amount. So I will be using my money on things that give me better experiences. I would like to spend it on hearthstone since I enjoy playing the game, but I just find it too inefficient.
---
Some people talked about the possibility of it happening since other CCGs do it, but the Hearthstone team never explicitly said they'd do it before the announcement.
---
Can still get a refund I believe
---
Implying it's not already in every one of my control decks.
---
Really strong card on paper but as many said already, there aren't many choose one playable cards. We have to see though what other choose one cards will be printed. I believe he will be a must in most druid decks in the next expansion. 
---
You'd think they'd be at the end of their rope by now.
---
No they will the same cost as the original spell. 
---
*Golden bloodmage Thalnos 
---
You can't use shir'vallah, you can't discover cards from another class
---
To My Side is rotating out and requires no minions.
---
Then maybe put cards that have more value so you can refill the board after getting Screamed.
---
Also there are times when you scream 4 times and that Odd Paladin still smashes your face in refilling the board time after time.
---
Doesn't have to be double, it's difficult to get the 8/8 taunts active in some matchups without using thekal and with the loss of Tarim/LK and Stonehill those taunts will be a lot more popular imo. 
---
That happened to me last night but I didn’t pay much mind to it. I’m surprised it’s a consistent bug
---
"Whenever your opponent casts a spell, give your minions +2 health"
---
About as hard as it is just to figure it out on your own in &lt;20 seconds.
---
Glimmeroot saw play and has the chance to fail.

2/2/2 | After you summon a minion, deal 1 damage to a random enemy.  
---
God forbid game mechanics feeling outdated!
---
Epic*
---
\*laughs in Lightbomb\*
---
Well, no, they have enough board clears to handle value. It takes cards like boom or at least omega assembly (three better-than-average cards for 1 mana, fine I'll take it) to make a difference in value... But brawl still counts for more than omega assembly.
---
But the point is, you don't want value, you want value *generators* that can turn into infinite value, or else you want something to deal with fatigue.
---
By the wording im pretty sure its before which is pretty insane 
---
Quick question - has Team 5 ever explained the reasoning for paladins having secrets? Doesn’t seem to be much of a flavor fit
---
It's really not. The weapon was never essential to spell hunter. It was often your worst card, tbh.
---
I mean - if they gave me the choice, It would be huffer 66% of the time.
---
It's more that Priest was in a terrible state when Purify was released and was one of only three class cards because it came in an adventure meaning Priest was going to be trash for at least another four months.
---
oh no, point and clicking! for more than 7 times! D:
---
Boring
---
This actually may cement odd paladin as the best deck in wild. This counters warlocks, priest and other aoe wielding classes so hard. I already hate it
---
Twin spell will replay, giving you a non twin to hand
---
Yeesh. This is very good. I dread playing against this, especially in Wild.
---
Gaining armor alone is too bad. They would have to change the effect. The scheme is worse than "Gain 5 armor" for 1 mana after 4 turns in your hand. I know you play a lot of dead cards in control warrior, but this takes the cake.
---
I do think that the bomb mechanic going to warrior is cool enough to let it slide tho.
---
REEEEEEEPOST
---
I dunno I’m pretty sure that’s one of those generator sites. You can set rates for what you pull
---
This is crazy. For the people who don't know, the drop rate of a legendary is one in 20 packs. This mean that a random card in a pack has a 1% chance to be a legendary. The chance of having four legendaries in one pack is (1 / 100) ^ 4. This event will happen on average once for 100 million opened packs. This is crazy.
---
neat, minor answer to mage/warlock aoe
---
There's Seaforium Bomber too.
---
We don't need a new card type every single expansion, and the burn out on concepts like Hero card and the legendary weapons is already here between Deathstalker Rexxar and Kingsbane.
---
Last years card did not have an impact on how the format developed because they were not designed to do so. Give it a few days now, and we should see more of them having an impact when the year of the Mammoth stuff finally rotates.
---
Basic hero power enhancements were also something that hadn't been explored in roughly three years before the release of the Witchwood.
---
Iteration on older, well-liked designs is not a bad thing. Just look to MtG or Yugioh for proof of that. Sure, Hearthstone is not as old as either of those two games, but MtG does quite often make reference to designs that are only a couple years old in newer sets.
---
The card is basically starfire, but.. Better? Cant go face, the 5/5 can survive the rush attack and be a big threat? I dunno, with zuljin it's nuts i suppose
---
Specialist format? I haven't heard of this.
---
Oh I didn't notice they are two different guys lol. Thanks for the reminder and the link! And thanks for everything you did. You've always been of great help! :)
---
I understand how Twinspell works, but it's Zuljin doing the casting, not you.  I just don't know if it's been confirmed or not how it will work because I said it does not work that way with Echo spells if someone else casts it.
---
There's [[Seaforium Bomber]] too.
---
It has so many play modes, the cards are typically well balanced, jank(meme) cards are always extremely cheap regardless of rarity. Play mode costs range from 10,000s a deck to a dollar a deck. 
---
Yeah if Rogue goes the way of druid where their core strength is compLetely gutted, I'm out like GOUT.

The racial thing is just bizarre to me as well - I've been playing wild with a fairly inexpensive agro shaman deck around rank 15. First play of the game, this guy drops a Small-Time Buccaneer, while I'm holding a golakka crawler. Fearing the return of pirates from the Gadgetzan era, I coin out the crawler to stem his momentum early, after which he ropes me on every single turn. It was a close game, but I wound up winning in the end, he then friend requested me and says "You're nothing but a p2w ni**er" (my censoring) 
---
I'll admit I've spent some cash on this game (more than I'd like to admit) but my mid-level income and current situation allow me to do so, so whatever... Being curious I asked him what made him think I was "Pay to win" he said it was my card back - I like the heroic Naxx card back, so I use that one most of the time - then he launched into a more offensive diatribe, so I removed him... just kind of baffling to me... I showed the exchange to my wife,  who was just as confused as I was. 
---
So what is the interaction here with [[Wardruid Loti]] then?

3/1/2 | Choose One - Transform into one of Loti's four dinosaur forms.

---
Dodged a bullet there.
---
Unlike kingsbane this has counterplay.  There was no way other than janky warlock bs to remove kingsbane from the game.
---
I am thinking a card along the lines of one we saw in the rumble run :  
---
"When you gain armor, gain twice as much"
---
Zentimo is definitely a good card held back by lack of a good 
---
archetype to fit in.
---
Just watch Chumps recent videos to see how much value you can pump out of that guy once you build a deck around it. Now that deck isn't good in the current meta, but those can change.
---
How does this help against boardclear?
---
If your opponent kills your minions the +2 attack doesn't help them 
---
Such a tired joke
---
Protection against board clears for Aggro Paladin? I can dig it.
---
That's a big ouch for Wild
---
but considering traps played by zildjian do not empower the spellstone, I have a feeling this will not give you extra cards either
---
It's not quite reprint but it's not far off - maybe this wil lall lead to great game balance but right now it's hard to look past the lack of new ideas.
---
Nope! It's a rare.
---
Amen, I was about to crap bricks.
---
How
---
What deal did you strike with the devil for this?
---
congrats! one of the best packs I've ever seen. as mentioned, all those legendaries are playable as well, with one or two being high tier.
---
Dr7 is back!
---
This secret dont so helpful against board clear cause it triggered after spell playing 
---
No idea
---
I feel like I will need to craft a second Geist now and play two in each Wild deck....
---
"both"
---
Unfortunately, your submission was removed because it is a pack opening.  All pack opening submissions should be added to the [Pullsday Thursday pack opening threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=Pullsday+Thursday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).  They are stickied to the the subreddit every Thursday and allow you to show off your crazy or unlucky pack openings.  You are also welcome to post in /r/HSPulls.

That is bonkers
---
They could be 2 damage dynamite so they arent bombs
---
Idunno, could serve as a win condition in control mirrors. 
---
Ohhh you mean like dungeon run. I guess i wasn’t considering that an adventure since you don’t get any rewards etc. thanks!
---
Perfect joke because as you mention we cant actually use it, and also because when we can use it, that card is going to be great imo.
---
Yes.  You don't even have to dust them.  You keep the card and the dust is awarded automatically when you log in after April 9th.
---
They even do it when they show archive footage of past expansions with Ben Brode present, which is kind of hilarious. I figure that if they want to go as far as suspending people to keep viewers’ attention off of their new competitor, they should probably not show clips with him in it. I’ve seen a bunch of people get suspended because they got baited into typing his name by the stream itself. 
---
Oh for sure. It’s losing a lot in rotation. But I just wonder if a new deck of a similar archetype will emerge. That’s the fun of cards like this!
---
The issue wasn't that there weren't any targets for Purify when it came out, it's that Priest literally already had silence for 0 mana and drawing a card wasn't worth 2 mana. The influx of silenceable cards after that made only having 2 copies of 0 mana silence meant purify was shoehorned into the deck as another option, especially with it being a cheap-ish spell you only really wanted to use when Lyra was on board.
---
Aye. If they passed out another 2 packs per wing, there wouldn't be an issue with it, but it's fairly vampiric as it sits.
---
UnGoro that card old af
---
Rafaam's does. He turns his trash scheme into a legendary
---
Easy deck doesnt mean high winrate deck.
---
Also, even if the deck its easy, at ranks 5-legend, most people know how to play their decks, so the increased winrate for being an easier deck is diminished. And if I remember correctly, only even paladin and midrange hunter are ahead of secret pally in rank5+ and legend ranks in terms of winrate.
---
Also, I wonder why every single tier 1 deck is considered easy.
---
Does this trigger when you have no minions on board, or does it need at least 1 minion like Competitive Spirit did?
---
Yeah it definitely works, you’ve gotta manage your resources and do not kill her until you have c’thun maxed and ready. You may have to even to take her to fatigue but t works 
---
Ok, you have to topdeck a dead card and have this in your hand for 4 turns before it becomes a 4 Mana iron hide. *Eleven turns* before it's a greater healing potion.
---
And armor is good because it helps you stabilize. If you're able to wait 5 turns for this to be even slightly useful, you've already stabilized. It's atrocious.
---
yes youll only get 400 net gain of you have to craft it. you only get the dust refund for 2 copys of a card (golden or not doesnt matter still only 2) but if you are missing a copy craft it golden for more dust. if you already have copy just keep it. dont disenchant to make a golden one because you end up with the same net amount.
---
Does branching paths say "Choose One" ?  
---
It does not.
---
Ohhhh. Thank you so much 
---
This with the add 3/3 and 3 copy's could be a crazy endgame. 6 mana 8/8s with rush sounds fun 
---
They're making fun of the time he rated all the Priest cards in Ungoro one star b cause he thought the class wouldn't see competitive play, which was an understandable call considering his rating system and Priest's poor competitive history up to that point. He rates cards based purely on what level of play they'll see in the immediate meta. It's a harder but potentially more informative way to review cards. 
---
Difficult to analyze this card. It's a card that's very bad when activated at the wrong moment and almost broken when it's activated in the perfect situation. If paladin is strong it's going to be very strong, but if you can play easily around most of the other paladin threats, this card won't be a big threat either. But if there is an oppressive paladin deck, this card might be insane.
---
Here's hoping they change the card after listening to the feedback.
---
Have any secrets (besides Ice Block) ever seen play without support cards for them? Baku Paladin can't run any Secret synergy cards like Sentry or Challenger, so I'm not sure they would even want this.
---
That's where I am thinking it would go best as well. Even just playing him as a 2-drop isn't horrible due to his vanilla stats. Play a 1-drop, followed by him, into another 1-drop and PotW, which gives you a buff and panther to play, and can then be followed by the Loa spell. He can definitely snowball if left unchecked. And can really give you some good refill to a boardclear.
---
Then maybe even throw in the treant Twinspell as yet another double board flood.
---
It's got potential.
---
Basically play this gain one in your hand. The one in your hand does not have twinspell effect. 
---
Warth is a [Day9 reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9uRMJ95q80), not sure if intentional tho 
---
TLDR of this thread:
---
Token druid!!!1!11
---
WaR DrUid LoTi SyNeRgY
---
Jade idol 👍
---
Yes.
---
I think its start of turn
---
"Heh, Priest."
---
"Lol, Priest."
---
"But you know, Priest. Womp womp."
---
*Dr. Boom's Scheme is like Purify.*
---
So you're saying it's laughably bad but in 2 sets it will synergize with one card and create a reasonable deck until the next set where it'll go back into obscurity?
---
This is going to be a massive buff for token Druid. 
---
Didn’t know that but 99% sure that’s a typo
---
&gt;Even though I routinely wipe my Reddit history, you can still find dozens of times I've helped people detect/report bots and 0 that I've promoted or encouraged using them.  All flagged bot programs get banned immediately when using them (including the one above).  Which, you can go back to August and see on that particular forum.
---
Eh you're just pretending you're not botting anymore, last time people pointee out you were botting on reddit, strangely the post on that bot forum where you have been active all got wiped out. All your comment and post of bragging of botting and not getting caught suddenly dissappear?
---

---
You act like you're helping people on reddit but on the bot forum, it's the opposite right?
---
Does anyone know how the card would work with dmh? 
---
Will it keep the armor or start from 1?
---
Most pirate decks run two copies, not sure what the miracle variant is about but I haven't encountered Auctionneers in a long time. Keleseth/Tempo, Pirate and Odd are pretty much all of the Rogues decks I see, and they all run it.
---
I feel that’s because you are playing Zul’jin, and zul’jin is playing the secrets. Since the spelstone requires you to play the secret it doesn’t upgrade.
---
Think if zuljin was a minion with the battlecry: gain a random secret; should it affect the spellstone? No because you didn’t play a secret, you gained a secret as effect of a battlecry
---
I wondered for a moment when they was it that they implemented the 'A Choosen One' card.
---
Haven't played for a while.
---
Yes but who the hell is searching "Rastakhan" or "Kobolds" like hmm 
---
Kinda reminds me of Starfire, where the card you draw is always a 5/5 rush for 6. (and the 5 damage can stick around, of course) Very strong Arena card, and I bet it's stronger than it looks for Constructed.
---
So useless it could be an epic ! 
---
What year is this?
---
How long do you expect a Drakkari Enchanter to stay on the board? How much armor would a 3-mana 1/5 need to give to see play?
---
Fandral was a fence sitter!
---
My first reaction: ooh, it's a Hench-Clan something, I can't wait to see the Hench-Clan flavor!
---
My second reaction, ok, so it turns out "Hench-Clan flavor" means... having 3 health.
---
This expansion is so underwhelming so far. I understand that this is a callback set, but we just had 3 sets that were all underwhelming, the last thing I want is boring old mechanics. 
---
This might be a good time for me to stop playing. 
---
Awesome thanks for sharing. Totally missed that. Ching ching ching ♫♪
---
i made a thread asking this before in regards to zuljin and other random cast effects (yogg). One of the game designers answered and said it will add the extra card to your hand.
---
What happens with branching paths?
---
Purisima#2134 EU Trading 80g quest  
---
You go first, but i'll show
---
Yeah. 4 mana, make 2 jade, shuffle 3 idols is nutty. Now just add an auctioneer
---
Also not in standard for when this is valid.
---
well i'm not 100% sure if the minion itself will also cost 6 mana, sometimes the generated minions are cheaper(or more expensive) then the spell that created them.
---
Arena exists. Its actually pretty damn good right now. 
---
Can confirm as someone who has been memeing with Immortal Prelate ever since it came out, it's not OP at all. It's very good, and can win you games, but you need to play around transform effects, silences etc.  
---
It's actually pretty rare that the prelate stays infinitely, even so it's still a good card. More often I just get 2-3 uses out of it before the opponent has a silence or something.
---
2/2/2 with deathrattle has both tolerable stats and some value in it. Quite good early game minion which doesn't become useless later. It shows potential 
---
Thx for the suggestion, ill look at mechanism hunter and some vids on it and check it out
---
Not sure why you would dump your Naxx account.  If you didn't want to play Wild, surely there is more dust there?   Save your dust for HoF changes to get more back.  ([Year of the Dragon Checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b1thmu/year_of_the_dragon_checklist/))  And pre-orders are generally the best value you can get, maybe there might be an Amazon Coins promotion to eek out more value.
---
----
---
Anyways, here is what I tell beginners:
---
##Getting Started To Hearthstone Tips
---
1.  First, all this information and more can be found in the [Reddit Beginners Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6tbyp5/hearthstone_beginners_guide_year_of_the_mammoth/).
---
2. The best way to get gold is just finishing Daily Quests. (Always re-roll 50g quests)
---
3.  Get all the classes to Level 10 and beat all the Expert AI bosses.  Jump into Ranked as soon as possible (Casual mode is locked until you are Rank 25.)  Don't worry, Ranks 50-26 is a one time climb.
---
4. Also, get one class to Level 20 to unlock Tavern Brawls which get you 1 free Classic pack per week. (Wed-Sun)
---
5. Complete the Prologue in Knights of the Frozen Throne for a free Death Knight.  Death Knights are *very* impactful.
---
6. There are also special promotions still active that get you free packs in the game.  You can even use an emulator to knock them all out quickly. (*Use Google*). (Play a game on iPad, iPhone, Android Tablet, Android Phone, and Samsung Galaxy phones)
---
7.  Open packs in each set until you unlock a Legendary.  In your first 10 packs of a set you are guaranteed a legendary whereas the normal drop rate is 1/20.  I would start with Knights of the Frozen Throne in hopes of getting another Death Knight.  Or start with a pack released in 2018 (Witchwood, Boomsday, or Rastakahn).  
---
8.  You can also complete all 3 Wings of *Knights of the Frozen Throne*.  In total, this rewards you with 1 Legendary Death Knight (Prologue), 3 Packs, and special Paladin Portrait.  (F2P Guides courtesy of TommyJTheGamer)
---
  * [First Wing of Ice Crown Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6sydke/im_the_guy_who_did_the_mostly_free_to_playbasic/)
---
  * [Second Wing of Ice Crown Citadel](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6uf7g5/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/)
---
  * [Final Wing, and hardest, of Ice Crown Citadel] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6w4koa/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/).
---
9.  If you buy 1x Kobolds and Katacombs pack you will get a free Legendary, Marin the Fox.  It isn't competitive, you can't disenchant it, but it is free.
---
10. Aim to get 5 Ranked wins each month for the free cardback and rewards.  The best rewards are at 20,15,10, and 5 so these ranks are important.  (Compared to Rank 5, Legend is only +45 dust)
---
11.  Buying in bulk is usually best.  If in doubt, focus on Classic (will always be good in Standard) and sets released in the current year.  Right now that is The Witchwood, The Boomsday Project, and Rastakahn's Rumble.
---
12. You only get cardbacks but if you want help on the solo player content you can find it here:  [Kobolds and Catacombs Dungeon Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/7qtrt9/noblords_guide_to_dungeon_runs/), [The Witchwood Monster Hunt](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/8ff4wy/monster_hunt_overview_and_monster_hunter_guides/), [The Boomsday Puzzle Labs](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/guides/puzzle-lab-guide-release-date-experiments-card-back/) or the [Rastakahn Rumble Run](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/a8ddw7/guide_to_rumble_run/).
---
13. If you play Arena, you can get drafting help with [HearthArena](http://www.heartharena.com/) or [Lightforge](http://thelightforge.com/tierlist).  You can also find the ["Rewards Table"](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Arena#Table) here.

---
The bomb cards so far aren't that understatted, just 1 stat point off.  I'm not saying they're *strong* tempo plays, just that they're not on the level of Freeze shaman.
---
Because people have been hyped up before, only to be let down.  If the expansion is good, then people will call it good, but the Hearthstone meta has been so stale for a long time that they will wait to see how it actually is before praising it.
---
If you looked at most of the meta decks in the last year, most of the cards being used were either classic or cards from year of the mammoth.  Genn/Baku were the few consistent Raven cards you'd see in top meta decks.
---
Well ill try it out
---
This is the pinacle of dunning kruger.
---
No one understands how "mana cost and effects" are not just compareable like that. 
---
E.g. in controm priest and control warrior manacost doesn't matter as much as they don't play for tempo, the only thing it decides what else you can do in the turn in wjich you play it.
---
Also having a dead card in hand is horrible in a tempo deck, but a controm deck with 7 to 9 cards in hand at all times doesn't care as much.
---
I don't say the cards is necessarily good (except as sideboard choice) but your comparison is fundamentally flawed and simplified. 
---
It is a value card not a tempo card. 
---
Lol no one is gonna do anything over botting in a game. No one cares. He’s not gonna receive death threats and he’s obviously overreacting. You didn’t dox him, he probably just didn’t want his Battletag blacklisted or his account banned by Blizzard. 
---
Yeah 'decline' is a bit of a deceptive phrase really.  Every game will have a point where it sells more units than it ever has before or will again and after that point it is technically in 'decline'.  But that decline can take decades to really mean anything (if it ever does).  WoWs peak was in 2010 and it has been in decline since then.  Magic's best selling set was Mirrodin and that was back around 2005.
---
I’d say craft the good neutral legendaries. Thaurissan is a good start if you’re not gonna buy blackrock.
---
Very true. I forgot about the experinenter tbh. Hmm could maybe see this working out. Hope we get some cool tools this expansion!
---
Magic Arena, its massive right now and has lots opporitnites for you to slowly get into physical magic if you want, which will then open up the possibility of having a gathering every Friday with like minded people who want to nerd out about a specific topic together. 
---
There's also autochess out right now, which is massive and still in its infancy so that give you a lot of room to grow with it. There's also rumors that valve may pick it up officially. 
---
And you seem to like fantasy so why not try something that's not as aggressive as a fps but is slightly more demanding than a card game? Elder scrolls online is in a great place right now and has a full road map for future updates it'd be like getting into hearthstone during the grand tournament.  
---
Fallout 76 gets so much shit, but that's because people demanded it be something that it wasn't. Honestly, it's perfect for people like you and me who want a more relaxed atmosphere with a lot of collecting, crafting, and improvement potential that also comes with the possibility of comradery. It's a very chill second life sim that has a lot of cool aesthetics, think sea of thieves set in the fallout universe and crack open and beer and enjoy the world around you. 
---
Maybe even diversify and download some source mods, watch tyler McVicker's youtube channel-there are so many new, fresh and inventive source mods that will allow you keep a breast with an active community and play fun games that are FREE and are not too mechanically demanding.   
---
Are you playing on mobile?  Some people have had similar issues.  But if you can get on other servers on the same device, probably not.
---
A new addition to Wild Quest Priest decks, nice.
---
I personally made him a mod on the wild subreddit after this information was known, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.  He's been honest about botting in the past, apologized, and is no longer doing it.  He is one of /r/hearthstone and /r/wildhearthstone's most helpful and active users.  There are hundreds of examples I could point to where u/cgmanama has spent a substantial amount of time contributing to the subreddit and helping others.  I am proud to have him as a member of our community and the mod team.
---
I think it is important to recognize people make mistakes and acknowledge he has shown remorse for his actions in the past.  Along with apologizing he has gone out of his way to help detect botters and reduce them from the game.
---
[[Eternal Sentinel]]
---
Yeah maybe like you pick out of armour, attack or raw a card for 2 mana, and then you can cast it again?? Call it something like Panching Braths or somethingv
---

2/3/2 | Battlecry: Unlock your Overloaded Mana Crystals.  
---
So everyone is getting a guaranteed legendary before the release of expansion? In addition another one guaranteed within first 10. What about if you pre-ordered the expansion where it gives you a free legendary? Does that mean within my first 10 packs I am essentially guaranteed 3 legendaries? Seems like a good deal to me. 
---
&gt;A common card is not very good. Game is dead
---
Zoolock will be strong tier again because of Lackeys. This is so sad.
---
F2P Wild is definitely possible. Mech hunter is a top tier deck and is very cheap, for example.
---
This would be absolute hell in control warrior. They fatigue you and then drop a bomb into your deck that deals 20 damage. 
---
Average armor gain is much higher than 15. You would keep this on the mulligan, so your probability of drawing it early is higher than just randomly pulling cards off the top of your deck. Also, you can play this a couple of turns into fatigue. This is probably around 25 armor on average in the matchups it's intended for. Your Chillwind Yeti example also ignores the fact that because of AoE and weapon removal, there are usually more answers than threats. Often times you'll have an excess of removal in hand when the game ends. This is particularly true given that Dr. Boom (the DK) gives hero powers that directly contest board.
---
Fair enough. I guess we have different methods of evaluating cards. I generally rate them like Trump does, where the main factor is how much they appear in the meta. 
---
Alana is pretty bad tbh and dragon priest doesnt need the death knight (partially cause it's hard to play it without killing your own guys and losing all tempo). I'd suggest waiting after expansion drops as it's only a few weeks now. And in my opinion some of the best cards for big mage and dragon priest are in Naxxramas and BlackRock respectively.
---
r/TodayIlearned Cockroaches are a race in WoW
---
Actually it only turned into 1 :(
---
hey wait a minute
---
Same race, qiraji
---
Odd is rotating from standard, but I agree that it looks like aggro/token might get pushed based off these two first cards
---
tbf with the way novice engineer is used, as a cycle, this has a completely different purpose as it generates a specific type of card. Depending on if there are more cards that benefit from having lackeys out this card could become a lot better or a lot worse. 
---
T1 Flame Imp/VW
---
T2 Egg
---
T3 Evil Genius + Lackey
---
Can have 5 tokens by turn 3. All lackey's except the spell lackey will provide some board presence by either upgrading a minion, summoning one, or help killing the other. Pretty damn powerful opener. 
---
 Have you considered buying the Adventures, keeping 1-2 cards (like Emperor Thaurrissan).   The Adventure are super high value to buy for Wild.
---
Big Mage, and Dragons, are getting support so I'd at least wait for the new set.  You cna't go wrong with Emperor Thaurissan though, he goes in most Midrange/Control decks.
---
Going from cheese cubes to scrambled eggs huh? 
---
There are quite a few strong decks currently. Not entirely sure which is the strongest.
---
I’ve been playing a lot of aggro pally lately. Ngl but I wanna play something else now 
---
Someone watches Chump
---
I'm playing on pc. Also important addition to the post is that when I try to log in to the same account from my phone it works perfectly fine. 
---
If you think about it 1 second you know that it makes no sense to upgrade it twice between each turn. Gruul is on the field therefore there is a practical differnce. 
---
But i don't see any reason to use a longer card text because one card that is played about 0.01% of all decks and is intuitively different could confuse some people. 
---
I bet with you if people had to bet 90% would assume it is only each of your turns. 
---
But yeah i get it. 
---
And the reason why they did it,
---
Isecause they likely decided against it, streamlining text is important to them. 
---
Explaining fringe cases and transperency  is apparently not as valuable to them. And i get why they would think that. 
---
&gt;Which was bad for design space because it meant every deck autoincluded the "alright on curve" and "dicks all cards with 7+ attack completely from the meta forever" everything else
---
Not every deck ran it, decks very rarely ran more than 1. Main reason decks ran BGH was to have an answer for turn 4 mountain giant against handlock. 
---
&gt; The era of BGH was defined by the top end being Boulderfist Ogre
---
No one played boulderfist ogre.
---
I think this is a garbage card unless there is some sick Lackey synergy card (ala Togwaggle) that they haven't revealed yet.
---
99% chance this originally shuffled bombs into opponent's deck. For something that scaled infinitely how could they not have caught the imbalance early enough to change it into something better than trash? Why would they have ever thought that would work? The only other thing it could have done is put boombots on the board but that's too similar to Rafaam's scheme (and outright better).
---
I dont think this will really affect jade idol at all to be honest. They don't shuffle until their deck is basically empty. Unless you drew both idols immediately and also happen to have this card in hand and then it pushes your idol progression up one, I guess.
---
Too close to Hagatha's Scheme.
---
I don't know if it's meta or whatever but I'm all for qiraji !
---
Best contact Blizz support or hope another player has an idea.  I'm out of them.
---
#¯\\\_(ツ)__/¯
---
Yeah dude. I promise nothing, but go do a search thru the deathrattle cards, tons and tons of good stuff. Undatakah, Festerroot, pinata + Zilliax, voodoo doll, etc. Losing cube and Spiritsinger but there's still a lot of firepower.   
---
Here's hoping! 
---
Yeah at least give us that
---
I usually do not like people correcting the grammar of others on the internet, but damn you are so nice and friendly about it. Cheers.
---
I wonder why it's a priest-only card? 
---
I've been ready for them to HoF prep and finally print some good rogue spells for years

Thank you so much for saying this. People are too often ready to let an unqualified person continue do a job just because that person deserves credit for trying.

I did not dump my naxx account, I dumped my pre-naxx account because I can't, for the love of god, remember the email, nor the account name that I used to create the account and I didn't register it to my own name (don't ask why) so I can't get it back with my ID.
---
Thanks for your response, I googled and only found in-depth guides from 2-3 years ago but didn't think of searching here, my bad.
---
I’m gonna assume Blizzard hard coded this interaction to be different than what we expect. 
---
This would be a great time to start buffing cards. Why not tweak it after release instead of letting it be unplayable trash forever?
---
This is a much more fair Fandral, IMO
---
Hearthstone the community on Facebook is good.

Why does it say May 30 in the corner there?

No worries, best of luck getting going.  Every Tuesday there is also a stickied help thread for new players you can post in (or just post in the main sub too).

---
It’s more likely we see a nerf , like last time when they hit wildgrowth and equality. 
---
 Btw. when people were rioting over Ultimate Infestation, i half jokingly said they will probably not nerf UI, but Nourish. ... You could also say Nourish by itself does nothing, but obviously it kinda combos with your whole deck. So, yeah Prep is a hot candidate for a nerf.
---
Same lol
---
Guess that's why power of the wild got updated 
---
I agree. I kinda miss playing midrange and long game paladin from a few years ago. Its a shame Uthers deathknight didn't see as much love as I hoped in the long run
---
The more lackey cards I see, the more underwhelmed I am. All lackey generators seem too random to be used in competitive decks(save for some value oriented synergies such as togwaggle).

this seems interesting 
---
Draw! secreto!
---
Plenty of game-changing cards were announced late in the reveal season of previous expansions. 
---
Nope made that mistake once, will never do it again.
---
But you already paid for them lol
---
wait 10 turns for a 10 cost rng roll? HELL YEAH! /s
---
I know reddit loves day9, but I can’t stand his fake enthusiasm. 
---
Plenty of game-changing cards were announced late in the reveal season of previous expansions.
---
Now this is the kinda shit I want to see in this game
---
Easily one of the most outrageous cards of the set. This card should see play in MANY druid decks. Heck, even if it's only for the synergy of this with the draw and mana crystal card.
---
I’m not saying he needs a good Discoverable card to be playable, I’m saying the fact that this is Discoverable makes him better. He just needs expensive spells to be available in Mage, whether you include those in your deck or just rely on discovering them. You’re reading my comments incorrectly. 
---
true, the only case where this would be "good" is if you wern't running guldan in which case it would be a 6 mana clear the board of everything but your dreadsteed regardless of divine shield, deathrattle summons etc. which pyro equality couldn't do though that was a 4 mana combo until recently.  
---
That's a bow. I can see the idea of a legendary bow with increases the damage of your spells in hunter.
---
Thori'dal can be useful for getting a baited arrow that is more likely to overkill. It might also be useful for getting some extra burn damage with things like bomb toss, baited arrow, arcane shot and kill command for finishing off games. All we really need is one more cheap spell that can directly hit face and Vereesa may very well end up being a reliable burst finisher.  
---
The bug thing (Qiraji) are old god minions. The troll fortune teller works for the old gods and is part of the EVIL alliance 
---
Yep. I tooled around with a Sacrifice-themed Zoo deck that was actually decent, just not as good as the established Keleseth+Heal package.  
---
In other Classes, lackeys seem lackluster (lackeyluster?) unless they get lackey-specific synergies. But in Zoolock they actually slot into a sacrifice theme really well. Their worth is basically in their battlecry, and that useless leftover 1/1 is a perfect target to kill to buff you other minions.   
---
Also, not that it matters, but this is like, *totally* on-theme for "evil henchmen".
---
[Not](https://youtu.be/PoNtyi2B_8I) even [remotely](https://youtu.be/H9t2eY0cNQ0).

Then you know exactly what he meant by “one extra mana”.  Unless you didn’t realize 6-5=1

Yeah, I don't think this will be a meta-altering combo---but if there are combo/control shaman decks that are running lots of big removal, it might be enough for Omega to find a spot. 
---
With Mages being able to summon 4 copies of a 6 mana minion/if Chef Nomi somehow found a spot in the meta or any other late-game fill-the-board decks become prominent, bringing this scheme and holding it in some matchups may make sense. If so, Omega might find a place too.
---
&gt; Clearly no one can see how your point is related, which is why i asked you to clarify.
---
Clearly only you and another guy are the people struggling.

It's at 25 points, and one guy added onto my point after agreeing with it.

Evidently, many people are not struggling to understand what I had said.
---
&gt; My perspective is the correct one, im not sure how you can be so off base on this.
---
Back at you.
---
Wait do you choose which lackey you get then? Why does it say random?

Worthless right now, but in wild it can probably be absolutely insane.

Nobody talking about jebaited arrow with this

I know, but I feel like hunter is all about the beast (and clever traps... but not really)... and not weapons. 
---
Ya catch my drift?
---
Congrats, I pulled a Rotface with mine
---
i think it should have been something like add 3 mana add 1 boombot to hand, upgrades. this way it is pretty slow but gains ok value with time. 
---
I think you’re right. This could be a sick combo
---
Savannah Highmane?
---
I am way too happy to see more skeram cards :333
---
Yup. Planning ahead, filling out your curve efficiently, managing board size, and trading well sound better than: "mulligan for Keleseth or Ghouls"
---
With dragons fury and meteor rotating, there’s no longer reason for control mages to restrict deckbuilding to only high costed spells so I doubt big spell mage will remain as a control mage subtype (in standard)
---
WinningStyle#1709 NA trading 80g quest. I show, you go first
---
Aye, Justicar is a Grand Tournament card, *but* combining it with Finley could be the excuse.
---
But, I suspect that Card Sets 2 and 3 of this year will feature heroes and villains from previous sets as well, and I would not mind at all seeing another Confessor Paletress, or Justicar Trueheart, or Bolf Ramshield.
---
Kidding, Bolf Ramshield can sod off.
---
It's not as if my perspective is unique, your claim is anyone who thinks you misunderstood OP must be misundestanding your comment, which is a hilarious strawman. 
---
Qiralji life matters
---
It just means Jan'alai won't be an automatic turn 7 and be more of a late game finisher like she was probably intended to be. Being able to put Jan'alai in an aggro deck thanks to Baku was insane, now she'll probably end up in a control deck of some kind with Khadgar as a combo piece to making two Ragnoros for 9 mana or something. 
---
At least we got Kelecgos, he's not directly linked to Dalaran but just to magic in general.
---
Send good in Spell Hunter. I'm a big fan of face hunter so I kind of see this as a potential for some crazy burst damage to close out the game. Don't even have to be face hunter to do this I suppose. 
---
I don't understand, why print this as a minion that grants the weapon? Are they that focused on promising no legendary weapons this expansion?
---
Not too clear on something - When a minion says "Gain [buff]", usually that means the card itself gains the buff. That would mean using the last charge of the weapon won't give you Spell Damage, as the weapon that should gain it is already broken. But that also seems really unintuitive, to have a 3 durability weapon that can only grant its ability twice. So does Spell Damage just go directly to the hero?
---
Jade Idol should be nerfed to 8 Mana.
---
You get what you want
---
Yeah what the hell bombs tend to do with warrior, warriors never used them... “Psss, hey Garrosh I think they forgotten that thing you did in Theramore”
---
I really think, if they were going to scrap the original idea, they could’ve at least made this playable.  “Gain 1 Armor for each enemy minion.  Upgrades each turn” would at least be playable.  This is just a sad failure.
---
But bows are there in hunters basic set. Also in WoW they had guns and stuff. So idk.
---
I think we're gonna get some kind of egg/Lackey zoolock that uses [[Grim Rally]] to push damage. 
---
Exactly. I actually enjoy playing old-school Zoo. But the Zoo of the past couple years is just soooo lame and uninteresting. 
---
That’s definitely not true. It’s not a tier one deck but it doesn’t need reno to win
---
You call divine shield, bubbles. Not bad.

But what happens when blizzard releases a card with three options? 
---
Or a quote from Dune
---
it's like deck slots on steroids!!!
---
You're talking about the people who came up with things such as Shudderwock.
---
The nerfs are just annoying, because they don't fix the lack of counterplay that made the cards too strong. Just give me new ways to counter cards before banning or destroying them, like stuff I can do on my opponent's turn. Because I really hate prostrating myself in front of my opponent every time I end my turn.
---
Give it a fucking rest, dipshit. 
---
Does it break on the third swing? If so, it's only two turns.
---
Thijs said on stream while playing wild that he wanted a card like this in standard! His prayers have been answered!
---
I backed it up with a paragraph of statistical analysis.  I analyzed all common scenarios.  You want me to go further?  There are 12 meta spells that can easily kill 2/2s but not a 4/4 (I didn't even include Frostbolt, mage has ping hero power), and 7 spells that would be reasonably used to kill a 4/4 but not a 2/2.  There are also 7 weapons which aren't trash which would not attack into a 4/4 without additional aid, and 2 which would.
---
I have pre-purchased the 50 pack would have ordered the 80 but budget would not allow it and in my dreams got both. (I LOVE THE GAME)  Only tend to purchase at start as rotation means a lot of decks become invalid. It's a bit easier in the second expantion to stay competitive as you have deck's to fall back on.
---
I would one day like to do the get the whole  set day 1 thing but that's a bit far off.
---
Right now, your deck is very much a new player’s tempo rogue. This deck does not need preparation, your dust would be much better spent on strong minions. The bloodfen raptors and shenjin shield masters really aren’t very good cards.
---
Check a website like hearthstone top decks for tempo rogue decks.
---
Having worked in PR for more than a decade, I would assume you understand the importance of context and seeing the whole picture. I acknowledged the abundance of issues with the stream and my role in its failure. That tweet was in response to the number of people telling me that I wasn't qualified for the stream when in actuality I have a Bachelors degree in Broadcast Communication and 3 years of professional Hearthstone commentary experience. It was also a response to the people telling me that the only reason I had the job was because I'm a girl, which is abjectly false. You can continue to further this narrative if you'd like, but it simply isn't the case. 
---
We still have a lot of legendaries to go, maybe we'll see some of these
---
you can buy from the US store as far as I know, but that price gap is mostly due to differences in taxes.  80 EUR includes VAT, 80 USD does not include tax.  
---
&gt; your claim is anyone who thinks you misunderstood OP must be misundestanding your comment, which is a hilarious strawman.
---
That's not a strawman, and yes that's what happening.
---
I didn't misunderstand OP, and I responded to OP knowing what they were saying.
---
You on the other hand responded to me not having a clue of what I'm talking about.
---
That's on you.
---
And congrats, your perspective isn't unique. Neither is mine. Whoopdie-do.
---
US price is before taxes. 
---
Yes but if youre not playing guldan in wild youre palying a bad deck.
---
why does this card say "random lackeys" when other cards just say "add a lackey to your hand"? see evil conscripter for example
---
Millhouse reprint.
---
Defias Ringleader?
---
Taxes; no, the only thing I can think of is using amazon coins if your country allows it: you'd basically pay 70 euros for the 80€ bundle. Google it and use the search function, you'll find all you need

Cora didnt get defensive about what you claim she did. If you actually read the thread, she was referring to the fact that there were an insane amount of sexist comments in the chat feed saying she was only there because of her gender.
---
Huge misrepresentation of what she tweeted.
---
Ele tribe got me some great ele procs from other card generators vs ele decks
---
Powershot, Exploding Shot, Grievous Bite, Flanking Strike, Wing Blast are all non-face spells in Wild
---
So my guaranteed 5 armor is going to lose to your 1 armor when it’s the last draw of your deck? Lol
---
Specialty cards suck, and are rarely played. Warrior got a 1 mana gain 5 armor card that never has seen play, by your own logic that’s an armor specialty card. Priest got purify that saw play for a week before silence priest died. Every discard warlock card added the past 3 expansions all specialty and none played in winning decks. I don’t feel the need to go on
---
As i said, "for now"
---
Blizzard: what card do we reprint now?
---
Blizzard: let's make a new fan dral but even better with half the mana cost! 
---
qimonBruh
---
That one can at the very least be used in some meme decks due to the unique effect. This is not only bad but also boring.
---
Prep + Coin
---
Since it gives a temporary buff, and not a bonus through an aura, it should remain after breaking.
---
*looks over at magic*
---
Just release more cards and add actual, real, counterplay and the game wouldn't get so boring.
---
But its a digital card/image right? Why in hell do they apply a screen green effect 😅. I feel weird looking at it  
---
Not curator
---
This looks like straight out of /r/customhearthstone. And not in a bad way, it's rather awesome!
---
Not only does it create a more interesting way to have spell damage that's harder to remove than the board (since all decks have ways to impact the board, but weapon removal is a tech option specifically), it *also* prevents Rogues from gaining acess to cheap spell damage from discovering the weapon, since it's uncollectable. Additionally, it's a minion, so cheap damage spells/mechanics can still be printed if they are balanced around 'if your deck has no minions' in the next 2 years.
---
And there's also the option to bring back the counterplay of ratting it out in the future, if it was deemed necessary.
---
Not saying I agree with going as far as "garbage," but draw 1 from your very optimized, synergistic deck is incredibly different and far better than generate 1 random (even high value) 1-drop.
---
I predict Sea Giant will rotate the next rotation. I'm not gonna do anything if I'm wrong but I want the glory if I'm right.
---
baited arrow aint that bad
---
So potentially equipping a 4/3 weapon. Kinda slow, viability largely dependent on what spells are revealed. Im imagining more control and less face stuff. 
---
He's currently one of the members of the Council of Six for in Dalaran
---
yeah the hero powers of Mage/Rogue/Druid are very reliable ping
---
I didn’t catch much of the stream, but when I did tune in, the only problems I really noticed were completely out of your control. I really admire how you handle yourself, even when the community can be so toxic towards you. Wishing you all the best in everything you do &lt;3
---
&gt; Its not wasting my time when im completely vindicated by your shitty responses,
---
Lol what.
---
"Vindicated"? 
---
Do you like, actually care or something about how you look here? Do you actually feel "better" because of my "shitty responses"?
---
How easily influenced are you rofl?
---
For clarification, an “alternate timeline” clears the board saving the minions, effects, or anything relating to the current board state. The idea around this is that you can use this card to clear the board and  setup for a combo to win in that “timeline.” Or you can use the twinspell to return yourself back to the timeline you originally were in if your plan doesn’t work out like you though.
---
i dont know, seems like kill command hits my face 100% of the time. id be wary.
---
Nice!
---
&gt; sadly ZJ does bot have many damage oriented spells to cast in the hunter class.
---
What?
---
Kill Command, Arcane Shot, Flanking Shot, Explosive Shot, Bomb Toss, Grievous Bite, Toxic Arrow, Multi-Shot, Baited Arrow, Wing Blast
---
&gt;And if hunter did, this could easily back fire(like giving ZJ to mage)
---
Still usually worth it.
---
I hate Anduin and they’re not selling Tyrande so I preordered. Didn’t feel great about it.
---
It will be an easier decision if/when they let you choose which golden legendary you receive instead of making it random. I’d value that highly.
---
I'm already considering crafting her day-one, and now I think I'll pull the trigger. 
---
I think you might be onto something. They found out that it's original effect was too strong so they needed a quick fix and were like "warrior?" Guess they'll just get another armor card. Even if it started at 6 armor it would still be garbage. 
---
he's fucking invincible
---
In Paladin, assuming you own, have drawn, and played the 3-mana legendary, yes.
---
&gt;Anyway, I'm sure this author isn't getting paid much for an article like this. Freelance journalism blows, I would know, but the quality of this article just feels very low.
---
Seems appropo. 
---
Presumably no one was getting paid much for the reveal stream, the presentation blew and the quality felt incredibly low. 
---
Ah, snap.
---
BLIZZARD: GIVE HER AN INTERACTION WITH ALLERIA!
---
Always other packs to come :)
---
All Year of the Mammoth cards go to Wild. Hall of Fame is for extra cards NOT in Year of the Mammoth that are getting moved to Wild in addition. It has always just been for Classic cards until this year, where they are also moving Genn and Baku + the other 4 Odd/Even Cards from the Witchwood to Wild. You will get a full dust refund for Hall of Fame cards, but not for Year of the Mammoth cards. 
---
I'm not sure why that word you found so interesting.
---
You proved my point, i read your original comment and went, this guy is full of shit, and now its apperent to anyone who reads this thread, Yes, you are full of shit. Vindicated.
---
Might wanna post this on r/customhearthstone instead.
---
I know. :p
---
Hmmm, tbh I typed in the wrong subreddit. Cheers guys, you’ll see it there soon
---
Hey Cora it's Dylan!
---
As someone who disliked the reveal stream, nothing that I disliked about it was your fault. Part of the reason for roping was the issues with the lackeys, as well as the fact the reveal streams have gotten rather stagnant. I thought with what you had available you did a fine job. 
---
Keep doing you Cora 
---
Upvote for visibility as well as honesty and acknowledging critique (when relevant and not just hateful). It's not a common trait these days.
---
&gt; What's the difference between being HOF'd and going into wild?
---
The Hall of Fame is for moving Standard cards to Wild that normally wouldn't be leaving Standard at that time. It was created to deal with problematic Classic and Basic cards which, by default, were never intended to leave Standard. But now with Baku and Genn, we're seeing the first expansion cards going to Wild early via the Hall of Fame because they were deemed to problematic for Standard and couldn't really be nerfed in a suitable way.
---
&gt;Will all mammoth cards go into will wild?
---
Yes. They're rotating out of Standard since their two years are up.
---
&gt;I pulled a golden Sonya and i didn't see it in the HOF dust list, and I don't have a rouge deck. So I'm wondering if I should dust it now, or wait?
---
It's not getting HoF'd. As with any card, never disenchant unless you have an immediate and specific need for that dust. Since we're just a couple weeks from a new expansion and rotation, there's next to no reason you should be making any significant crafts right now, so you're probably better off holding onto Sonya until you know exactly what you should be crafting with her dust.
---
&gt;Or can I save it and build a deck around her for next season?
---
She's rotating out, but if you're interesting in making a Wild deck with her, sure.
---
Huckster was literally never great
---
&gt;Hero Power which will be ~~free because you played Fencing Coach the previous turn for 31 damage~~ unnecessary because you're playing Hunter.
---
I was personally ok with the way you presented my biggest gripe was the lackey bug thing which was out of your hand.
---
I personally don’t like overhyping or hyping in general so I felt at home with the stream
---
But there has only been Classic and Basic cards that got HOF’d up til this point, so who knows what they’ll do.
---
Cora. I want you to know that you are a fantastic caster. Don't let any negative reactions you might have received from the stream let you down.
---
Wishing you all the best.
---
You did alright, considering all the technical issues. I would hope that next time, there's less idle talky talky and more action. Or at least something interesting. 
---
Like the other posts said, don't spend 15 minutes reexplaining each of the lackeys and twinspell, repeating the cards that have been revealed already. People who watch the stream already know that.
---
Spellstones require you cast the spell. Zul'jin does. Even then, Twinspell is a component of the spell rather than a dependent variable. The effect of the first twinspell is not only cast,  but add a nonrecastable copy to your hand. 
---
[[Arcane Shot]] just went up in value as well. 
---
Well, what do you actually play in spell hunter from these: 2x KC, 2x Flanking, 2x Baited arrow. Still looks cool, just not as cool. 
---
This is why the game needs a configurable auto-squelch. Remembering to squelch each and every time is a bit cumbersome.
---
Even warlock is one of the best decks in wild and doesnt use DK. 
---
Here in stranglethooooooorn
---
Thanks for doing the data here! It's good to see some examples of the lucky draws (like Argent Commander, Sunwalker, etc.)
---
The Mage 6-drops are going to pollute the pool quite a bit. However, if they get a good 6-drop revealed in this expansion, or over the course of the year, that could significantly improve this card (and Khadgar's) power.
---
Also way less flavor

1/-/- | Deal 2 damage.  
---
Yes and no. In an era post Shielded Minibot, the best two cost minion the game, it's difficult to make a two cost card attractive to decks to the decks that are fine with just playing Keleseth like Zoo Warlock.
---
It's more that Keleseth ended up invalidating quite a bit design space, the middle of the road two cost card, and unless the two cost card was incredibly pushed, it isn't going to see play.
---
With knc and kft rotating out a lot of boomsday and rastakhan cards are gonna look viable. I seriously cannot wait for April's rotation.
---
Candy crush makes is currently the second most profitable mobile game 
---
Even better than a 2 mana Flamestrike, it also hits face.
---
cool
---
There is a priest card that is 2 2/2 doesnt destroy but only gives one lackey. 
---
it's like fandral but worse!
---
Equality and shrink ray can help surviving though.
---
There's also ways to modify or cheat this spell out.  Both of the new mage legendaries have very strong synergy with this card.
---
Looks a bit odd to me
---
If you could get them in the same class,  it would. 
---
Yeah I feel that the price is really steep.  The hero portrait bundle is priced at 110$ for me
---
Honestly, I don't think most people were bugged by it. The big things that bugged me were how many cards were revealed during the stream, not the play or the discussion. You also don't need to defend yourself here, or apologize. You did a great job!
---
That word was interesting because it shows how unnecessarily seriously you're taking all of this.
---
And it's apparent to "everyone reading this thread" how pitiful that is.
---
no please this place would be flooded with rank 90 players asking why the card is bugged
---
"Some people crave attention so badly". Assumptions assumptions. I thought you were smarter than this. It's your fault for interpreting my first comment as condescending in any way. That wasn't the intention, I greeted him, I said good bye. Also stop looking at my history, you creep. I am being a douche against people who deserves it.
---
well whalen was preeettty out of his element in a 1-on-1 reveal stream. I think throwing in a community manager was supposed to make up for any conversational shortcomings on peter's end. it kinda backfired tho.
---
1.  Not much.  Hall of Fame is just for problematic cards to rotate early (Genn/Baku) or Basic/Classic cards that aren't supposed to rotate (Evergreen)
---
2.  It can be useful in Wild, if you plan on playing Wild I'd keep it.
---
3.  Don't go crafting things before April 9th.  A lot of decks will change with rotation.

#[Hearthstone: Year of the Dragon Checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b1thmu/year_of_the_dragon_checklist/)
---
Card sets from 2017 will be rotating and unplayable in Standard, specifically:
---
* Journey to Un'Goro (Un'Goro) *released* April 2017
---
* Knights of the Frozen Throne (KFT) *released* August 2017
---
* Kobolds and Catacombs (KnC) *released* December 2017
---
So here are things you want to do before Year of the Dragon begins (April 9th).
---
☐ Make sure to finish KFT Prologue
---
&gt;Finishing the Prologue rewards you with a free Legendary Death Knight.  Additionally, if you finish the Adventure you can get up to 3 more KFT packs. (F2P Guide for [First Wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6sydke/im_the_guy_who_did_the_mostly_free_to_playbasic/), [Second Wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6uf7g5/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/), and [Final Wing](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6w4koa/im_the_guy_who_did_the_basicfree_to_play/))
---
☐ Have Purchased at least one KnC pack
---
&gt; Your first purchase of a KnC pack rewards you with a free Legendary: [Marin the Fox](http://media-hearth.cursecdn.com/attachments/55/661/2017-11-03_17-05-30.jpg).  This card cannot be disenchanted or crafted.  
---
☐ Keep an Unfinished Arena Run at two Losses
---
&gt; When the rotation happens, your Arena draft will contain "illegal Wild cards" and be auto-retired.  You will get a free Arena ticket and the rewards for however many wins you currently have.  So once you have 2 Losses, stop playing, wait for rotation, and get a *minimum* of 1 free pack.
---
☐ Craft for Hall of Fame
---
&gt;  The full [Hall of Fame Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/)  can be found here.  This is a great way to get a 12-50% return on your dust (or just free dust if you already own the cards).  You can even save cards if you think they will be nerfed in the future with no downside, e.g Genn and Baku. (See *Example 4* in the guide).
---
☐ Year of the Mammoth Events
---
&gt;Log in March 25th through April 2 to receive 3 free card packs! (one each from Un’Goro, KFT, and KNC)  The Tavern Brawl starting April 1 gives you an opportunity to earn a Rise of Shadows pack and [on April 5th you get a free Rise of Shadow legendary that is immediately usable in Play Mode. There will also be a quest chain on launch \(April 9th\)  to reward multiple card packs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dooJlmBjfpUzI-kML8I2dFvSM52qAliUsWAXymYQ0xs/edit)
---
☐ Pre-Release Party (April 5th-9th)
---
&gt;The [Pre-Release Party](https://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/the-rise-of-shadows-pre-release-information/) is a special Fireside Gathering event where you can open and use your pre-order packs early.  These cards will have no class restrictions and there are pre-built decks with new cards to play against other attendees which don't require you to open any packs.  You can [go here to find or create](https://firesidegatherings.com/en-us/) a Fireside Gathering. (if it is your first one you can also unlock a special cardback and Warlock Portrait, Nemsy)
---
☐ Special Pity Timers
---
&gt;You are guaranteed a Legendary within the first 10 packs of a set.  If you haven't opened a Legendary in Un'Goro, KFT, or KnC, you might want to open packs with gold until you do. (even if they are not playable in Standard, you can dust them)  Wait until March 25th as you will get one pack from each of these sets and you might get your Legendary then. 
---
☐ Disenchant Rotating cards
---
&gt;I do not recommend this as I enjoy Wild and I've seen a lot of regret posts about people dusting Wild cards.  But that is your decision to make, not mine.  [Here is a sheet that will use the cards you own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PtV8vuwufp0nB54lNB-phcDFWhQ_XKviuwvYfQtXEDs/copy) and, using Wild HSReplay stats, allow you to view ones that are and are not used in Wild.  (Works with Hearthpwn and HSReplay accounts).  Anything below the 10-20% range is probably safe to dust.  **However, new cards, mechanics, synergies, or nerfs may invalidate this list so be warned no guide is 100% accurate or safe.**
---
☐ Anything I'm missing?  I try to keep it simple but I'm not perfect.  Let me know!
---
Idk, I think it's completely unreasonable to expect anybody to not be defensive when confronted with the overwhelming and depressing negativity embedded in twitter criticism, much of which is much heavier on insults and personal attacks than it is on respectful critique
---
This card is a good for making mountain giants cheaper. It is also pretty great for drake. 
---
I guess this is assuming you're playing against a combo priest who does nothing for 20 turns.
---
I mean, the combo will exist in Wild. 
---
I was legitimately unaware that card exists, holy shit
---
longbow0921#1683 NA trading 80g quest, you first 
---
2 5 damage bombs is different than 1 10 damage one
---
I didn't particularly feel the reveal stream being kind of a shit show was your fault or anything. Did you get any serious hate for it? Wouldn't take it personally tbh.
---
Yep
---
It’s the real one 😱
---
https://hsreplay.net/cards/51159/revenge-of-the-wild#tab=recommended-decks quite well for the midrange decks that run it. Whilst not the most popular midrange deck it sets up a pretty great win condition and those decks run within the range of the win rate of other mid range decks.  
---
To be fair, I dont think it was the minority claiming the stream was awful. Whether it was Cora or various other reasons is up to others to argue, but I'd say the majority disliked the stream.
---
aren't all the "if your deck has no minions" cards rotating? 
---
I hate the part of the community that makes this feel like its necessary. I just cant stand the negativity. I really enjoyed the effort and your demeanor during the stream! Just keep doing your best
---
too strong to be white card then if you change starts to this because of the blastmaster mechanjc
---
I echo that having a third person, although fresh and new, was probably the wrong call. Having three makes the conversations awkward and forced, unlike when it’s just two people they can just talk back and forth.
---
if this had spell damage +2 until your next turn after attacking, explosive trap would be possible....but thats in another reallity.
---
None will survive
---
but not what you neeeeed
---
Honestly ive been looking at something for a big warrior build.  I saw that rejected rakhastan card that draws 3 of your highest cost minions and felt like that would be an awesome new build.
---
I invest so much making a recruit warrior and loved it so much, i just wanted some more support with bigger minions
---
Only if Hunter gets a “Deal X to the enemy hero” type spell, or a non targeted board clear. 
---
Especially with the cannot burn cards adapt. 
---
why don't you play it then?
---
We just want to see the new cards we can deal with everything else 
---
No offense to you, sure your a good person and appreciate the post even. But its the fact you have a Broadcast Communication degree that i think ruins it.
---
I don't some professional type, I want a true just fan of the game.
---
A streamer or just pro player ever. Someone more focused on the game, then doing what they were taught to do in school. 
---
this makes me sad. people on here / twitch can be very mean and misguided. you did a fine job; your enthusiasm was infectious. i also very much appreciate your candid and courageous address of criticism in this post.
---
That would be me your looking for.
---
Q can just be used as a fancy k
---
Oooooffff
---
I have lots of useless epics that is unpopular at all should I disenchant them and craft good legendaries like [[zul'jin]] ?
---
I think showing poise and good humour throughout the technical problems was very professional of all three of you.
---
Much more enjoyable than if you got stealth. Windfury on the other hand... 
---
Honestly Cora you did fine.  
---
It felt like people took some small annoyance (slow game play) and made a much bigger deal of it than it needed to be.  I know people are going to down vote me to oblivion for this, but I honestly think it's because of your gender.  
---
I can't count the number of times some far more cringy, screwed up, awkward hearthstone production gets mostly ignored but for some reason people rioted over this one.  I also can't count how many times i've seen another host of whatever event be super demeaning or passive aggressive to you for no reason and you always just shrug it off. 
---
You're doing great, you're like one of the three casters I don't hit the mute button on. 
---
Hi Cora! I personally feel the community needs to understand that this is a different kind of stream. All big streamers are what they are for a reason, they know how to talk and act in this situations. Like comparing a normal person with a Hollywood actor...
---
On the other hand, this was your first time doing this streams, and you only have time and room to improve! Take some of the good and bad comments and use them to learn how to improve, but don't let them feel bad!
---
Thanks for writing you feelings and thoughts!

10/-/5 | Battlecry: Cast all spells you've played this game (targets chosen randomly).  
---
[Berserker Throw (2): Hero Power Deal 2 damage.]  
---
There won't be, for a fact.
---
Am I the only one thinking Blizzard is out of creativity / unwilling to design fun cards? This is just dumb. 
---
You have here a very good point. They absolutely never interact with chat. So the live is not necessary.
---
Almost always do
---
That's part of the risk. No different to the hunter secret that summons a random 3 cost minion and you end up with Howlfiend.  
---
That's part of the gamble.  
---
Did that secret see play? Damn straight it did.  
---
I will silence Thier screams!
---
This single post has done more to generate community goodwill than anything Blizz has done around the expansion.  Well done!
---
I always thought it was excited inhalation
---
I don't think it holds me back, but it does mean I have a different style than a lot of the others. It makes my casting stand apart which is nice, but some people don't love it.
---
As far as being a true fan of the game, I've been playing since open beta and didn't start casting until over 2 years in. I don't think it's fair to categorize me as just being a "professional type" because I'm not. I'm a player who just happens to know how to speak on camera and has a piece of paper to prove it. 
---
the trick is to wait a while to accept the friend request 
---
You did great! I really had no problems with any aspect of your performance, and you shouldn’t have to take the fall like this!
---
I agree that it's a 4fun deck, but I'm not sure what control shell you'd even run for rogue that doesn't rely on tess. Like mage has alanna/ jaina/rag, alongside significant aoe board control.  Priest has Anduin/resurrect etc. alongside huge board control abilities.  Rogue has what? single target removal? Rogue isn't good at generating meaningful card advantage without burgle effects.  Value rogue needs to generate cards and tesspionage is the shell that enables it/gives it a win condition.  
---
Well, if you can find a way to heal yourself for just one, then you'd get an exact board clear, or do exact damage until you're full health, whichever is less, because the damage dealt by Blackguard is equal to the healing you received.
---
Healing for just one might be better, situationally, because if you overkill minions, you might hit full health before you clear the board, where a smaller heal might still get you to full or close to full while killing more minions...but it probably won't repeat 29 times due to loop protection.
---
So does grim patron, takes ages because it summons multiple grim patrons after a while.
---
Cora wasn't the issue anyway. The fact that it was set up to play 5 games with only 3 decks while only showing a dozen cards was just a bad decision. The amount of talking and over-evaluation of every single turn was also really terrible but this isn't the first time on a reveal stream that that's happened. Honestly, in my opinion, with the way the stream was set up it probably would have sucked regardless of who was hosting it.
---
A lot of the errors were out of her hand, but a lot were also in her hands too.I could deal with some of the technical issues, but there were many other issues that turned me off from the stream and yes, multiple were because of Cora. 
---
There are definitely areas where she can improve as far as reveal streams and similar, and I think that while she did an okay job, starting a positive "you did so great!" vibe is not fair at all.
---
She misplayed a lot, took too long on turns and generally dragged out the stream. She definitely could make a better structured stream and try to take the conversation to more interesting topics. No, she wasn´t terrible, I don´t hate her or anything (and I think the third complaint is absolutely idiotic, nothing suggests that she got the reveal stream position in any unfair manner), but she definitely did contribute to the worse experience of the stream, and these are the areas she should work on. Sweeping that under the table is wrong. It´s not how people improve their performance or become better entertainers.
---
Cora herself admitted these issues, and that´s great. She is a good caster and she has room to improve, and she knows where to improve. That doesn´t mean she completely screwed the stream and that she is "the worst", but it´s good constructive criticism and it´s okay to say it. We shouldn´t spin it and suddenly go "nah not your fault, you were great" because that is not true.
---
Yeah, Wild Growth and Nourish both increased in cat by 1
---
We don't know if Zul'jin will be good next set.  The card is good but will it have the support and be the right meta for it?  Best to wait.
---
Epics can also be good/bad next set depending on the cards and meta.  I'd wait at least 2-3 weeks (usually the first VS Report) before going on a crafting or dusting spree.  The only "safe" card I think is Zilliax and that's more of a support card for a bunch of decks.
---
Has it been that little time? Feel like at least a year. 
---
Maybe I'm just out of the loop
---
The game's been on a downward spiral for 2 years now so.. what do you expect?
---
Exactly. It's the whole concept which was not entertaining.
---
Eh? What is this post even about? No image or video link to serve as an explanation.
---
How does he define starts?
---
Yeah I know, previous poster was speculating how it'd work if not.
---
I enjoyed the stream *especially* because of the fuckups. Nothing like some good shadefreude. In any case, I thought you handled it perfectly.
---
What I'd be *really* interested in would be seeing Chakki's side of the stream. I don't expect a video of it exists, but do you know what was going on with him as the lackeys started to fail? Did he panic? Roll on the floor laughing? Was it really him cheating the lackeys into your hands? That was a great save.
---
So yeah, props to you all. It was hilarious to watch.
---
I think what you’re saying is a personal opinion. I agree with you about nostalgia but this is still a game within that universe. New stories are what make it interesting to a lot of other people.
---
Cool combo. Although I think I like it more with pogos. Small setup, then whenever you want to, you can play 3 pogos and drop zilliax to be rich.
---
https://www.hearthpwn.com/
---
&gt; But the comments I received about not deserving that role and just being there because I'm a woman were simply not fair
---
Totally unfair indeed.
---
My criticism isnt gender based, rather it is your focus outside of the game making discussions and explaining things people already know or are not interested in.
---
Let us be honest, If we had to choose between a gameplay stream and a facebook reveal where those cards will be shown all at once, we'd probably choose the later.
---
Again, it has nothing to do with you being a woman, or any other streamer for that matter ( i hated when kibler/day9 did it and i love both of their streams ) , rather we want to focus entirely on the cards.
---
The community was bored from a stale meta, frustrated by the year of Baku/Genn , the least we want is to sit watching an hour worth of rambling about cards we all know 90% will end up being dusted.
---
Yes, i understand that the lackey bug was bad, but just apologize and move on, trying to make us forget about it by making little discussions only makes it worse.
---
TL,DR : gameplay reveal streams are bad because you guys try to drag things out, what could be done in 20 or so minutes is dragged to 90 minutes of boring conversations.
---
   
---
Oh are we getting full dust for hall of fame cards again?
---
I assure you Wild is full of life. It's an awesome mode!
---
What is with that wording? They have never used "destroy a minion TO gain __" lazy as hell to not look up similar cards before writing it. https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Grim_Rally
---
Grim rally for example. 
---
It takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there like this and respect you so much for it. 
---
If you did another I wouldn’t be upset. You obviously care a bunch and you clearly want to do the best job possible. 
---
If they're good,I hope so! :p I love paladin, but I get the feeling they won't be as good this go around (as they're losing some solid cards and have been meta relevant for a while now)
---
Oh no, not a new Fandral
---
Boogeymonster is pretty atrocious, as is Bolf Ramshield.
---
Not sure what THE worst card is, though. But those two are pretty up there.
---
Actually,
---
Harbinger Celestia.
---
THE worst card in Hearthstone. Probably.
---
Legendary! 
---
While I get my HS information from Reddit, a lot of people don't. My so said she liked the way you talked about everything because you made it easy to understand, and we found it very enjoyable to watch.
---
Cora was great.
---
Sorry you received so much backlash for something that was not your fault. To be clear I blame Blizzard for its increasingly poor organization. You didn't have to post this, but you did and I think that speaks volumes to the quality of person you are. We need more positive peoples like yourself in this community. I myself have been very negative towards some of the cards released. I will take what I have learned from you here today and try to view things from a better perspective.
---
Thank you!
---
Imma miss odd mage when the new expansion drops...
---
Duskfallen Aviana for sure
---
If all 3 are playable (which they very well could be) then its just a nice bonus when it happens and not a requirement for the deck to function. 
---
Mirror Entity for 4 mana but not actually secret. That legendary is the worst card in HS history
---
Dr. Boom's Scheme can get you that much armor if it's been in your hand for 145 turns so the warrior is still gonna win :)
---
Yeah I suppose that makes sense. People are much more likely to state their negative opinion. In any case it's human to be nervous the first time. I'm sure you'll do much better next time.
---
Following up on what he said, as......spammy.....as twitch chat can be, when the dev said they couldn't see twitch chat that was a bit surprising. They should have it available for you guys. The chat was losing their mind over Prep + Wand and it might help snap you guys back into the game.
---
I feel like there's some value to it being a live stream. It adds some sort of authenticity to it and if it were pre-recorded and edited people would scream how fake it is and how it's tailored to make "shit" cards look cool. They obviously try to make them look cool now, too, but when the person playing sees the card supposedly for the first time and they talk about their decision to try to make the card shine, it's adds a certain layer to it that a recorded session would lack. 
---
Thay's not saying I don't see the benefits of a recorded reveal( especially since the chat on YouTube war disabled) , but I see the appeal as well.
---
And a good supply of weapons. 
---
I didn't watch, nor have I seen much of the drama, though I saw some complaints in another thread.
---
Just know, 99% of people likely didn't care. Only the loudest complain. Ignore the internet - it brings out the worst in people.
---
WoW isn’t in a very good place right now and it’s probably better for blizzard to keep the two games more or less separate 
---
\&gt; Expecting consistency from Blizzard.

---
Plus it does nothing when you're at full health, which will happen pretty quicky if you're running a deck with enough healing to bother with the glass knight
---
&gt; quickly
---
Why do people always put this word into their backseat developer comments?
---
Creating a fully-stable fully-tested deployment doesn't take some trivial amount of time. It takes almost all of it.
---
Running a demo off of an older snapshot is likely to create more problems than it is to fix, as most of the changes since that snapshot are going to be bug fixes you'd like to include.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
you play this
---
2dmg + skill command 5 + arcane shot 4 + hero power 2
---
2dmg + 2dmg hero power
---
basically 5 cards for 30 damage 
---
I watched it just today with my friend. It was a little off but seriously the internet is blowing it way way wya off the rails. Good games. Nice 3/2! Also great job on thinking on your toes and randomly generating lackys via the admin prompt!
---
Is it just me, or does this look like a custom fan made card? The art just looks like a random picture they slapped on there.
---
All these people taking about potentially useful but bad legendaries when the game has amgam rager, savagery, the 7/6 ogre that can't attack properly for 6, way too imaginative.
---
Just start with renounce darkness.
---
oondasta + thor idal combo?
---
It wasn't and I got Leeory out of the Frozen Champion for lethal lmfao
---
This is what frustrates me. I didn't care for Cora's style, but thats just my taste. I don't much care for watching a number of popular content creators online. It doesn't make Cora bad for me to not care for it.
---
And the lashing out against Cora gets jumbled into the valid criticism of blizz's shit QA. Blizzard needs to make this style of apology post and squarely say: We failed to demonstrate an attractive product because our code was shit. 
---
I didn’t watch the stream, but seeing you out here, communicating with the people, I wish the HS team had even a quarter of your communication and outreach.
---
Good job!
---
Even as a casual deck you need to draw 3 different legendaries and 1 regular card. meaning that you are likely to have to draw all or almost all of your deck to get them.
---
here i thought that was a beefy nigga with a robe and not a giant fucking roach/beetle hybrid
---
Premiers are a thing on Twitch.
---
Neither is this game
---
Nah, they typically completely forget about these things in between expansions. Except discover. That's the only new concept that's still around.
---
