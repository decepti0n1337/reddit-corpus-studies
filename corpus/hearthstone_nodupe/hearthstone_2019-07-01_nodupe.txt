zOwO
---
Oh shit thank you
---
You don't just lose... at least not in my case. I played silence priest at rank 3 and had a decent win rate. Also if a Mage fills its board with giants you lose with most of the decks if you don't have direct answer for that.
---
it's true, there's plenty of posts, just look at more and stop being a whiny baby
---
My god if Hearthstone ever does an expansion as a jojo reference...
---
Watch it end up being like thousand needles or something.
---
Fang#12818 NA 80g trade, you go first
---
Too slow
---
They can still craft the card.
---
Still not enough.
---
There is no reason why a card with such a powerful late game ability should come with a 4 mana 4/5 body.
---
Hmm, ok. But it's only one more mana than Aya.
---
Oh, simmer down.
---
You will be frustrated a lot at first. Don’t give up. Do quests every day and in a month you’ll be pretty good and have some good cards.
---
It's bad in ranked. It's only a OTK in this version (or TTK technically) because you get to attack with your minions on the extra turn. If you want something close to this on ranked, use Cyclone Mage: https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/11/cyclone-mage
---
McFrizzle #11679 NA I show you go
---
Sounds like a load of crap
---
Tbh, I'm half trolling half serious.  Idk what the top decks are, but even if they're not mech themed I bet they all have a significant amount of magnetic cards.
---
Consider, however that class mechs are 3x more likely on drone delivery. So you'd see less of them being pulled by chance.
---
I wouldn't use conjureers calling.  AMD ironbeak owl is my main hunter go to cause it's also a beast, but two of those aren't enough 
---
We need moar silence!!!
---
brawl.
---
Damn ok I’ll have to try that. Thanks for the advice
---
You can't obviously, but jade chieftan you can run 2 so I was clarifying that for the sake of my arguement
---
If you bait out both brawls they concede to endless army+vargoth combo
---
I wouldn't use conjurerers calling.  AMD ironbeak owl is my main hunter go to cause it's also a beast, but two of those aren't enough 
---
Yeti is untagged
---
Hearthstone is a game you can easily get on,so don't worry too much.Soon you will find yourself fell in love with this game.And as a tcg game,for newbies like you,the most important thing is never to disenchant your cards casually,espesially the legendaries.
---
Like 4 or 5
---
Even people who play MTG usually have a disdain for control. It's a fine strategy but can utterly destroy the game if it becomes too good.
---
*You're playing Vargoth?!* Man, I didn't even think of that. I mean, the combo is too expensive anyhow, isn't it? What else do you combo Vargoth with? Consecration? Prismatic Lens? Crystology?
---
Ooo, Crystology. That's pretty dope.
---
I beat the 5th with mage today. Its was a long fight. I used the hero power that reduces mana cost, the initial burn package, lots of big spells and the summon minions when spells cast anomaly. I think I got the robes treasure as well. Wasnt easy. Still string to beat #5 with bomb warrior.
---
try this

hope this works :D
---
Fuck i miss yeti 4years ago draft 4 yeti in arena consider toptier deck, iwish they made them powerful again
---
Congratulations, is there a reward for completing all 100% both normal and heroic mode with all decks, hero powers, etc.?
---
If the brann survived the brawl (and other removal somehow), would janalai and khadgar with brann then make 4 rags?
---
It should
---
I'm guessing you just played against a Dr. Boom who popped out four of these in one game.
---
Plus 1 to that, Loved that ycs when the time turned back to 1453 and the turks were sieging Constantinople because of all the fucking cannon soldier combo decks
---
Look at me...i am the warrior now
---
**WHY ZILLIAX IS BROKEN (and not just a "tar creeper" lmao)**
---
  
---
3 attack trades well into most 3/4 drops in the meta, so zilliax is already doing good there  
---
3-6hp lifeswing is already good against aggressive decks, and can help pull you out of lethal range  
---
Divine shield + taunt lets you just play it without even trading to soak 2+ trades that you get 3hp from  
---
and that's only when you play it vanilla...  
---
when you magnetize zilliax:
---
you gain a minion with ((usually)) 7-8 attack that heals you for that amount and gets a free trade against either   your minions, or it can just go face and you either have to trade into it healing them for a bunch or sink a removal spell into it  
---
as hard removal is relatively hard to come by atm, its difficult to actually have the tools to remove the zil minion   and also deal with the next threat, or even have it in hand because you used it on the previous threat  
---
current hard removal is also so inefficient rn that if you use it to remove the zil minion you most likely still lose 
---
because of the tempo swing + life gain from it  
---
On top of that, it's seeing play in 63% of decks, which is much, MUCH higher than tar creeper was. You don't see play in 23% of decks by being a "filler card".  
---
**SNIP-SNAP**  
---
Snip is the 2nd most played card in the game after zilliax (32%), so it also is obviously very strong. It's so strong that even control warrior is slotting it in. An another note, notice how the disparity between zilliax and snip's playrate is **over 30%**, and the disparity between snip and the 3rd most played card (mecharoo) is over 10%. 
---
On top of that, it's seeing play in 63% of decks, which is much, MUCH higher than tar creeper was.  
---
**DR. BOOM**
---
Hero boom is being played becuase he's fucking crazy, not because it's out of necessity. He has a 70% wr when you get him in mulligan, which is **INSANE** for a 7 mana card. Blastmaster boom is played because he's also fucking crazy, boasting winrates similar to that when you get hero boom online because of the massive tempo swing it provides. There are multiple other warrior decks that have support (dragon, etc.), but they don't see play because none of them provide the damage + tempo of blastmaster boom.  
---
**OMEGA DEVASTATOR**  
---
He sees play in every single warrior deck. He's nuts. Meteor can't be played on 4 as a yeti for tempo/beatdown. Deva is nuts.
---
I called my doctor cus shitting seemed abnormal to me. He said "You. You are good!" So, you have nothing to worry.
---
When a person makes these posts its basically a screen shot of a rank. We've all seen what the rank icons look like. There are a million people hitting a rank and wanting praise. If they all start posting will it be funny to you? Make a separate megathread for people who want validation. We have one for pack pulls. Why not this. Pack pulls are at least more interesting as its a different combination of cards. These posts are just a picture of a rank.
---
You toss Yeti on the field, Priest SW:Ds it. Can't do that to Omega so Priest can keep the card for a later minion, such as a precious magnet fed Zilliax
---
Can’t get past the second chapter on normal. Nice to see it is possible.
---
As a Shaman player with 1,100+ wins I would love that!
---
Spellbreakers are good for silencing magnetised mechs. Also conjurer's calling is good to target their low lvl magnetised mechs and its also has the versatility of being able to widen your board and its a twinspell
---
I think he was going for irony
---
Hey no problem, I was curious enough to check it out and figured some other people might be too
---
I had the treasure that made my cards cost half but could only play 2 cards per turn. I figured since I didn't have lethal in my hand already, one more spell wasn't statistically going to help me win.
---
I was in the process of doing this then week four came out and all my heroes had crowns over them. Kind of a bummer.
---
Hunter is almost always strong, and usually pretty cheap to build decent decks for.
---
Yes mage is good right now
---
Don't get your hopes too high. If the previous Togwaggle tease was an announcement of announcement of announcement, then this one might be just an announcement of announcement.
---
You're a cum stain of a human.
---
Yeah I know it’s op but r there any other classes that r better?
---
Ex Paladin cuz muster 4 battle
---
Totally true but sad btw :(
---
With Pulisic being the new captain!
---
Team 5 will get absolutely raked over the coals if any cards go against the new 'class identity' though...
---
I think that Blizzard to give some serious consideration to a rotating core set as the pros outweigh the cons.  
---
The biggest advantage is that it free's up design space for the current year!   
---
They would still need to be careful with the core set obviously but make sure that no class' power level is out of control.  
---
I would love to see a core set that consisted of selected cards from previous sets because it fits that years theme, the meta would seem fresh from year to year if they do it right.  
---
Conversely the constant nerfing of evergreen / classic is getting messy and somewhat irritating.
---
What the hell, you seriously are mad about this? Who cares it's just a simple little animation.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I have the exact deck you linked. So no Highmane then?
---
Post a replay of a match for specific advice. In general you want to try to outvalue bomb warrior and heal, so look for Zilliax / Devastator etc.
---
I don't think that's controversial at all. It's because of the mech tag.
---
They can't even make tournament mode. If you are going to make a demand, ask for a bundle. They are good at that.
---
Or a card back for 12 arena wins? Nah. Might confuse the casuals
---
Naru41#1699 Asia 80G Quest trade, you go first
---
Yup I'd play it. My advice though is not to make it different for the sake of being different. You can attract players purely based on your IP's, so don't radically change gameplay and possibly fuck up what's fun about the genre. For example I'm sure lots of LoL players never gave a shit about the Autochess genre until Riot did their own.
---
It's a priest player. Don't ask me how I know...
---
Happy for you. I used to hate Hunter because I thought it was super easy no brains, but it is a super fun class to play and has a lot of cool things you can do with it.
---
Manawyrm Pog
---
There isn't a sharp line that separates them, but a better example of a value play would be Flamestrike/Twisting Nether'ing a full board.  Your 1 card dealt with a lot of the opponents cards in an efficient way but you aren't necessarily now ahead on board if the opponent gets to develop first.
---
   
---
These are aggressive decks. But the warlock must save the board, and the hunter can return it at any time.
---
58% of the time it works 100% of the time
---
i am not sure about that but i belive Dota and lol using the WC3 engine 
---
and overall many of Dota characters are copy paste of Warcraft 3 characters and units 
---
[Dota&amp;WC3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00BOuEKfm1o)
---
I thought our favourite card was blink fox.
---
Why was carousel a mistake? Lol it's not extremely difficult. You just gotta play around it until fatigue most of the time.
---
run a copy of [[Ironbeak Owl]] or [[Spellbreaker]] in your deck if this happens to you a lot. I play mech hunter at legend and like 75% of zoolock decks run spellbreaker. token druids simply kill me faster than I can get the combo down or use [[Soul of the Forest]] to create a resilient board.

[Berserker Throw (2): Hero Power Deal 2 damage.]

Seeing it now, this card was utterly busted at two mana in the classic set
---
Watch them just shift whatever skeleton crew works on HotS still over to it.
---
Nobody would like to get a litterally unplayable card in their packs or their arena draft though...
---
His identity is to be in charge so..
---
Combo on minions acts like a battlecry. It's literally unplayable!
---
Is such a deck actually viable? The only Jade deck I found on hsreplay has 40% win rate, but it is very different. I love the idea of using Zentimo because of Jade Lightning, but a few other things could probably be cut (Rummaging Kobold would be my first cut).
---
That's real fuckin neat actually. I dunno if miracle mage needs any MORE support, but goddamn if I wouldn't mind seeing something with a mechanic like that get printed.
---
OTK Shaman that does Mad Summoner into Bloodlust and Math Warrior that plays Worgen, Frothing and bunch of whirlwind effects. It was really cheap and skill intensive.

I suggest using hearthpwn quest trade thread. You get 160 gold out of it!
---
May be make activate with card that didn’t start in your deck but this will make discover too good but without this mirror match was very hard
---
Is it all tri-class cards or only the jade tri-class cards that don't activate vendetta?
---
This reminded me that the mulligan mechanic gets changed with the next rotation.
---
Midrange Hunter is a very old deck.  Back in the early days of Hearthstone, decks were a lot more aggressive.  Face Hunter was a popular deck back then, it played a lot of minions with Charge and a lot of burn damage like Kill Command that it all sent, well, to the face.  Compared to something like that, Midrange Hunter was a slower deck--it even played 6-mana minions (Highmane)!
---
Nowadays, Midrange Hunter is more like an aggro deck, I would say, but the name remains.  And it has enough value generation like Marked Shot that I wouldn't fault someone for calling it Midrange.  More typical midrange decks nowadays tend to play a heavier curve, with more 4-8 drops.  
---
If you want a more stereotypical example of a modern Midrange deck, look at [Book of Specters Mage](https://hsreplay.net/decks/O1l9wAWKh257xkMGx2r1kc/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD).  It plays all the way up the mana curve, trying to make the most out of each mana on each turn without burning through its resources too fast.  That's exactly what a Midrange deck does, it tries to weather aggro decks while building overwhelming pressure against control decks.  It's in the middle of the two, hence "midrange".

Okay, now my brain hurts

For me it is not just conjurer's calling but it happened to me with almost all twinspell cards
---
Dalaran has format of old adventures where you buy wings. All previous since KFT were free. Not saying it is the case in the next expansion (especially if people are paying), but we won't know until they announce something.
---
oh yeah, you were right. How could I forget Kazakus? I´d be so hyped to have him back. I thought I saw that on customhs too thought, but yeah, good find. It´d be awesome to see anything like that
---
I mean, the HS community has pretty much guessed the location (Uldum), the theme (desert) and the central cast of characters (League of Explorers).
---
The only thing we don't know is the official name and main mechanic.
---
Vendett shouldn’t work with a card you can put in your deck but a card that says
---
“Get a Card from your opponents class” when your opponent is one of the other jade classes and you get a card that should be one that triggers vendetta but you get a lotus agent instead of say a random shaman card
---
Last I checked, tri class cards buff spectral cutlass and work with tess, no reason they shouldn’t work with vendetta or underbelly fence
---
Small indie
---
super late addition, but I remembered another HS original character that I could see as a Dragon: Saraad. A Nether drake, probably. Any idea for him? i could imagine him as a Kabal Character
---
which was stupid, they couldve easly made it way rarer or banned vendatte for example out of arena. instead of impacting constructed.
---
Here are 4 slightly different lists: https://hsreplay.net/decks/#gameType=RANKED_WILD&amp;wildCard=yes&amp;sortBy=winrate&amp;playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;includedCards=39941
---
Where do I see those 5 decks?
---
I'd  say it's underpowered because youd have to wait till turn 7 with the coin to be able to consistently kill it without the opportunity of it being silenced. Maybe it should also read your hero power costs 0.
---
More like incest...?
---
I know people have been saying this verbatim the past week or so, but good god did they pace out this expansion well. I don't remember the last time I didn't feel an expansion dragging on and desperate for new stuff. Hopefully this is a sign of better things to come ( I hope)
---
Video with expansion name, maybe a few cards, and then wait two weeks for a developer sit down with an annoying streamer, where they hype up the expansion  more with a dozen cards, then the daily card reveal schedule after that.
---
At least one person is smart here
---
:D
---
Anyone knows what time will they go live exactly?
---
Or Blizzard Korea, Brazil etc.
---
I don't understand the 10 damage. Why 10 when 5 would still be good? The other Omega cards are underpowered and lack synergy. Assuming Boom has been played this thing rushes in and can kill a 14 health minion for 4 mana, that's an Ultrasaur! The mech tag means it is easily discoverable and can be magnetised. Make it a dragon that breathes a 6 damage fireball, that would make sense.
---
True, but as long as the card is actually good (but not too good) and/or fun to both play and to play against, who cares? It’s not like hearthstone has ever had a policy of treating WoW lore as canon and unchangeable.
---
Plus it would be dope as hell, of course (imo).

This is literally their solution, if you contact customer support on Twitter. It works, but it’s a hassle.

You might want to check again. This was changed a while ago
---
Do you mean class?
---
Will do. Honestly I havnt played burgle rogue since Shadows was released. Ive stayed pretty much exclusively in the single player content
---
The number of times I've prepped a Necrium Blade on 5 just to Sylvanas their Shadow Essence on 6 is too high to count - the deck just destroys Big Priest
---
Its a reasonable control counter as well - a single Toggwaggle's scheme can let you outvalue most long games, and its fairly easy to make boards that are difficult or impossible to clear with Brawl, Twisting Nether, etc.
---
It gets absolutely rolled by aggro tho (Odd Paladin), there just aren't enough good spell-based anti-aggro tools in Rogue
---
How dare you
---
Still too powerful....
---
Directly translates to "Flash of Frost," which is interesting. 
---
What's more interesting is that Google Translate, if the full phrase is typed in, it gives the translation of "Frostbolt."
---
And so have I
---
Why y'all gotta make Reno hot like that. Stupid sexy Reno.
---
Yes. Mage only have one good deck. It is bad against aggro, specifically hunter.
---
Which teaser? [This one?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwAftFk4Vek) Or is there another one I haven't seen?
---
It's a lovely vanilla deck and a great way to learn the foundations! Midrange basically means that it plays aggressively against slow control decks and plays a defensive control role against aggro ones.
---
Yes, this one (it's the LoE music).
---
This exact thing happens to someone every third day. Write to Blizzard support, they will fix it very promptly.
---
12 mana 6/7ish, costs 1 less for each armor your opponent has.
---
Didn't notice...
---
 (health) (love) (bolderfist oger)
---
Alright,i geniunely want to know how ? The elixir and a bunch of cantrips ?
---
Thats just because ( normally  it would directly say how much it would restore given ur deck so why it heals you that much is only important while deck building)
---
Doesnt really matter when u can play 2 more every turn 😋
---
Reno will be hunter's legendary card
---
Dairy because cow and drake because dragon. Cow dragon.
---
Ah shit I didn't even remember GHP. My bad.
---
Hmmm idk there’s never been a dragon hunter deck, I mean they only have emeriss and carrion drake and no dragon synergy
---
heheh IGN.

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
This guy's theory is right about in-game power of bronze dragon.
---
I love it! Great job! Only thing I can say is the mixing is a little off. Brode is quite quiet compared to the instrumental. Other than that, well done!
---
They should make a 12 mana 29-29 charge that dies immediately if there are other minions on the battlefield.
---
Thanks for the quick replies!
---
That's cute. Do you really expect 3 mana 3/6 Murloc with an incredibly powerful effect to be playable in constructed?
---
Turns out getting flame waker and arcane giants with the new cyclone card can be both good for sudden damage/board clear and also a safe 16+ damage by dropping both giants and warping.
---
This brawl would've been so much better if they just gave each player like 15 armor or max HP. You could still have had aggressive decks, which would've been forced to build into late game finishers, but also more thoughtful combo decks.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I loved the idea of this brawl, but 30 health starts are intended for minion-to-minion combat and board control.
---
I’m so ready!  (Heavy breathing)
---
Why would Reno mean there will be a dragon?
---
What makes you say that?
---
Well because he is a dragon himself of course
---
I’ve never played Wild. I don’t think I have enough cards to even stand a chance to be honest. I’ve seen clips and screenshots in this sub and I’m just sooo new to even get it half the time.
---
Oh I didn't know that. Checks out
---
The bug that changes the language of everything so you can't figure out how to fix it in the menu screens because you don't know the language.  That bug sucks.
---
We know how bad Murloc Shaman is right now, maybe it could do with a card to act as a sort of Loatheb effect for swing turns?
---
Is this canon?
---
Impossible to hate priests, they're a free star!
---
80g trade NA loldiamond1#1846 I'll show you go first
---
We have revealed Druid and Warlock quest, and since they represent other fractions (good and evil), I assume all classes will get their quest
---
What year is it? Are we in 3019 already?
---
One is dead and the other one is old. I check under her bed for sjws.
---
Sad to see they're doing the pre-release fireside gatherings again.
---
We demand full dust refund for those shitty nerfs
---
More board clears to make up for the lack of them in classic set ... every day in wild we get closer to ultimate control priest with literally just board clears
---
Looks like the Case Study treasure is getting an update.
---
How do you figure? Apocalyptic board clears seem perfectly in line with Warlock, IMO. I mean, Twisting Nether has been a staple of the class since the beginning, no?
---
This is awesome. Some players enjoy Tavern Brawls the most so this will help the game stay alive.
---
Being ahead isn't simply about having a board. It's about having a board that's impossible for them to remove or that is backed off by enough gas to recover quickly. Odd paladin doesn't give one single shit if you remove its board as long as it hasn't had to use excessive amounts of resources to get and maintain it in the first place (in which case, I wouldn't argue that they're necessarily winning).
---
outjerked again smh
---
I need a desktop background of that hijacked dalaran bit, that's amazing.
---
If you look at the pillar behind him you see the reflection of a dragon I think
---
Murloc Hunter?
---
Doesn’t matter if it was it’s not in Standard. 
---
Unless of course you play Wild then that’s differently.
---
The Reborn keyword is going to be annoying as all hell, and, like twinspell, it's simple enough to go evergreen.
---
Just wait for the inevitable divine shield reborn or taunt reborn.
---
I think you picked up on something there. "Mount" or "mounted" as a possible new keyword?
---
OMG boobs, must censor -\_-
---
HOLY FUCK BOYS I'M EXCITED!!! GREAT DAY FOR ALL OF US!
---
How sad.
---
Also a cameo in Warrior quest reward ;)
---
Can't wait for the Wild double quests lol
---
chicken breast don't upset people apparently
---
Thank you for the compliment!
---
Yeah we are all just guessing , I think Brann will be hunter, Elise mage (spell book ?) Reno on paladin (crystal is paladin kinda theme on HS ) and by default Finley in druid
---
Candles are just there to cover their bald spot.
---
And now is excessively cartoony
---
And now plague of death too
---
Although it looks pretty mediocre right now, there might be some better synergies printed so I'd hesitate in making an immediate judgement
---
Return of legendary weapons??
---
One of which is a Gatling fun of crystals??
---
Yeah, I think I’ll keep playing this game a while longer.
---
Among the Heist balance changes:
---
&gt;Elise's Journal – Acquired from purchasing one of the Saviors of Uldum bundles.
---
What is that? A new item you can randomly get?
---
&gt; ""slippery slopes""
---
you hate trans people and gay people then?
---
nice fellow you are
---
No, but they sure don't help anything. Except for sea turtles I guess, waging a war against plastic straws did help those.
---
She's in Paladin's Quest, not Druid's.
---
my renouncelock is going to enjoy this
---
Yes! I was just lacking a board clear in my wild priest deck :)
---
Well it was just purchased by Chicago investment firm...
---
Yeah, I really like this card. Simple, no-frills, but very solid quest support.
---
First turn 4 is early mid game already
---
Second Warrior already a meta defining force
---
Shudderwock &gt; Yogg Battlecry &gt; Yogg Box
---
They probably tried to print at least one good Choose One card in this expansion.
---
You're correct. You casted two spells, the box casted 10.
---
&gt; overly sexualised
---
a booty.
---
SOMEONE THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!!11!!one!!
---
Finely's pretty well read, he could certainly be the mage, and Reno's using a crystal cannon, and crystals are involved with the light and all.  There's evidence for things both ways I guess.  Either way, it's looking good.
---
Or discards cards. Warlocks have anti combo going on. Or it could turn all minions into imps.
---
Seems so big when you would normally play him for 0 mana, blizzard again with the lore inconsistencies smh
---
Maybe a Blue Dragon Reno for Mages? :P
---
No? Pretty sure they mean that for 90 days you can receive that one free legendary quest, not that you have to login for 90 days to receive another lol
---
Time to remove the gambling mechanics of randomized card packs then, for the kids of course.
---
this looks exactly like something out of r/customheathstone 
---
I love it.
---
I'm already theory craft a plot twist, hand fills deck that use Rafaam and this quest to draw 0 cost legendary minions
---
Children's card game.
---
I love gay people! I'm a solid 45% gay. I've even kissed a few dudes. It's had no effect on my long term sexuality.
---
I hate normalizing mental disorders and turning them into a social rather than a medical battle though.
---
great news for the nu-puritans on twitter but what about the chinese
---
i think they should remove all the skeletons while they are it, it's time to make a truly inclusive game
---
I imagine they were changed because the HS team couldn't think of a way to stay true to the theme while also meeting the art requirements. It's hard to de-sexualize a succubus.
---
They won't because blizz gets $ for current ones (mage is an exception).
---
Wild casino mage time
---
I think Quest call for bad design cause if they have big rewards they are too big. But theb new expansion feels so good that I'm willing to see how they handle them this time. They need to be less cost and less power level but enough to be worth a card in your hand.
---
If you question this change you are probably a trump supporter
---
Are they going to send to the streamers this kind of box for the card reveals?
---
I wish there are more mechanics specific to the "good" classes. So far we only have twinspell for them, while the bad guys have schemes, lackeys (yes this is not specifically EVIL, but 90% usage of them are in EVIL classes), and now plagues
---
Quests and reborns seem to be mechanic for all classes
---
Choose one cards have combined effects. What choose one cards currently on standard doesn't sinergize with token druid?
---
Not looking forward to seeing this on divine shield minions. I assume there will be a spell to add this keyword to minions.
---
Thanks for the phantom pain
---
You don't like [[Succubus's]] makeover?
---
Blizzard after announcing pre orders: “We’re going to be rich!”
---
Solid one drop, I think.
---
Yep, I already editted my post to reflect that.
---
The jaina nerf. It's spreading. Like a plague
---
They wouldn’t all cost 0, but yes this quest seems built with plot Twist in mind.  
---
Also note that plot Twist + Elekk means you get an extra copy of all the cards you shuffled back into your deck.

Well I mean obviously it's gonna be dope when it's a rehashed super popular song.. That's how many non-american musicians get popular by reusing popular american songs on their domestic market with changed lyrics.
---
Try on 1.5x speed. Can't go back.
---
Without some serious support this is awful. You might as well play it turn 1 since you couldn't count it that turn anyway, short of burning an Innervate, then you spend 4 turns behind curve just for a very slim handful of useful Choose Ones being good.
---
Probably to make it pg, but I personally think some of the new art looks better than the old stuff.
---
that's a bop
---
"What do you mean? 10 Pyroblasts to my face is great."
---
ftfy.
---
Really? Never faced him before.
---
Just disenchant the cards.
---
I can't tell if this is a joke or not but it's a Priest card.
---
It's the name of the new card back
---
Assuming Brann is the Hunter (I mean he uses a gun and is riding a dinosaur), I could see Reno being Paladin (OG healing effect) or Mage (new magical looking crystal gun).
---
Oh yeah, but the thing is, I'm wondering what card this would replace in the deck. All the minions in Mana Cyclone Quest Mage are fairly critical. Cyclone, Apprentice, Flame Waker, Luna, Giants, Vargoth. 
---
So if anything, it would replace a Spell. Which spell would get hit? Shooting Star?
---
Perhaps ironic, but the presence of Reno makes that really unlikely. They're not going to reprint cards.
---
hush
---
Holy Light, this is unplayable. Too expensive. Kills your boards which is priest's only way to deal damage. Priest cant deal face damage. ¿How do you expect to survive to turn 9, and what to do next?
---
Priest quest better be "destroy X minions" and give a HUGE board back or it is instadust. Even in wild its terrible.
---
Ok, Reno is Dragon as fuck
---
https://i.imgur.com/JrUDhs4.jpg
---
Scream had way more going for it than this card. At 7-mana it was a more reasonable answer to midrange and aggro decks. 9-mana is an awful mana slot and it could pretty easily be argued that Twisting Nether, a classic board clear that doesn't see much play, is a better card. Scream also had the luxury of being a core part of combo decks like Mind Blast Priest, Gallery Priest, and APM Priest, all decks that did not care about what was in the opponent's deck or fatigue. This card fits more as a tech card in Control Priest decks that want to slowly strangle their opponent of resources, I wouldn't be surprised if such a deck doesn't even run x2 of this, as two 9 mana board clears, no matter how good they are, still can clog hands and lose games.
---
because like other sane people you don't read the twitter of these lunatics
---
team 5 does though
---
Why did they change it though? It didn't even have boobs
---
Also you shouldn't be allowed to mount multiple beasts.
---
I already see a Quest Shufflock in progress
---
downvote the bot
---
That's Mercer singing!? Holy shit the dude's got voice
---
so is the druid hero power going to do all 3 for branching paths?
---
rip succubus, but i dont care that much about succubus, whitemane nerf was worst :(
---
I’m pissed.
---
but the reward isn't going to win you the game once you're in late game.
---
We Yu-Gi-Oh! now
---
You mean surprise mechanics?
---
&gt;Blizzard is a company, and they need money to go on, but they are neglecting their playerbase who have asked for various changes
---
if they dont feel the requested changes make sense, that isnt neglect. if this were a hard copy game and they were to not accept your old thicc tiddy booty cards, i could *somewhat* understand the complaint, but you're getting updated
---
They just freaking drop an announcement without a month of build-up? Have they *learned*?
---
The USA gdp is higher than China. USA 19.4 trillion compared to 12.2 trillion of China’s.

More people doesn’t mean more money. (Hint, go look at India for a shocker).

Not sure if they really try to prevent trouble with China or if they just had ppl complain about pixel titties/blood but they'll have their reasons for it.
---
Stampeding Kodo!
---
As a last hope hail mary this isn't actually terrible... In a low mana curve meta this is probably just a wasted slot since you most likely wont get to play it, but in a game that can drag out, this could just win a lost game.
---
Go to wild
---
Play Yogg-Saron
---
He casts this
---
Add opponent after game
---
"Yoggers Poggers!"
---
A Taunt minion with a minion hiding behind it would beg to differ.
---
I agree. This card being an end-of-turn effect makes a *huge* difference.
---
Omega Devestator is rarely a 4 drop, and it's just a vanilla one when it is
---
Mana tide is not a good card. No decks currently play it, and it has really only seen play in combo decks throughout the games history.
---
Whats control warrior? All I see is snooze warrior.
---
Will it be available within the ingame shop?
---
As a Casino Mage player, I am salivating. PRAISE YOGG
---
Yeah. Weird bite and the harpy got nerfed but whirlwind didn't.
---
He's actually really quite good in arena, not so much the other one.
---
https://youtu.be/3cZSvlgrjug?t=90
---
valeera's art seems fine (well, technically maiev)
---
np bro
---
Secret keeper, windfury harpy and queen of pain don't even look particularly less sexy, though.
---
Yes they changed some classic cards. Same as the Jaina nerf a while back but with cards.
---
also the [Skeleton Knight](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLpaESmWoAAk-LH.jpg)
---
 league of explorers - Level 30 hero's in a 30 zone. 
---
Saviours of Ulduar - Level 60 hero's in a 30 zone memeing around.
---
Most of these look worse, but I've gotta say, the new Windfury Harpy art looks amazing. 
---
Felstalker looks pretty good too.
---
I don't know that I would say it's 'broken' (it will be soon if they keep buffing the archetype, then I probably will just quit wild). There are still more powerful combos, decks and archetypes in Wild - every single one of them is miles more fun to play against...still y'know, feels like a game. Not a cow clicker based entirely on mulligan and draw order.
---
I mean lets be clear here - people were calling out big preist as a ridiculous mechanic before it even rotated to wild. "Nerf barnes" etc etc...we're now at a point where nerfing barnes wouldn't touch it, this very bad indeed.
---
I think it's bums that's the problem. Both her, the harpy, and the secret keeper were showing too much* buttock
---
 ~~Children's~~ Chinese card game.
---
Yes, but it is still something exclusive in this expansion for those 5 classes
---
Don't worry, they're getting around to it. They just gotta sift through all the cards and find the ones that are deemed too "offensive".
---
Wow the PR police are hitting this game pretty hard
---
This guy puts Rumbletusk Shakers to shame. Reborn being a standalone mechanic is unexpected. It's Ancestral Spirit being used as it's own keyword and it can't interact with deathrattle triggers, but with kill/resummon triggers like Cube in wild.
---
This card is interesting. You can tutor it with Town Crier (and Akali), it can deal 3 damage to one target, 3 damage to 2 targes or 6 damage to one, provided it dies in the trades. This might challenge Militia Commander's spot, as it can be more flexible and is more sticky, if it dropped for tempo, but it won't trade as nicely in some of the current meta minions while sticking around like Augmented Elekk. I can see decks run Mummies instead of Commanders or in addition to them or not at all, entirely depending on personal preferences and the metas we get.
---
Have you seen how matches for other eternal formats in other games go? Even games in MTG's Modern format can be pretty nuts.
---
Such is the nature of a format with thousands of cards within it.
---
Plus, outright removing Big Priest from being viable in Wild would go against what Team 5 wants for the format. 
---
Given how Star Aligner Druid was surgically removed from the format by changing one number on one card by one, something similar happening to Big Priest, a deck that actually existed in Standard, would likely kill the deck if it works out to lower the deck's power.
---
Well besides Magni
---
They put some bundles for sale in the middle of expansion...
---
In the leak I was non-existent
---
Anyone who says this isn’t solely an update to make the game more pg and thus more China ready is an idiot. Blizzard doesn’t care about good card art. Blizzard only cares about profit.
---
What does this mean?
---
and rope every turn

1/-/- | Each player gains 2 Mana Crystals.  
---
How stupid. Censorship like this should be protested.
---
what a banger of a track
---
the downside of that is that you would nees to hols your choose one cards until late game
---
Whatever floats your boat...
---
Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Slow it down there crazy future man. We don't have THAT level of technology yet.
---
Okay, so these are so bad I had to check the wiki
---
&gt; https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Primal_Fusion: Give a minion +1/+1 for each of your Totems.
---
So you use your hero power twice (total 4 mana) and then play a card that gives a minion +4/+4 if the 0/2 tokens survive, it doesn't come online until turn 4. Okay, very cool.
---
&gt; https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Thunder_Bluff_Valiant: Inspire: Give your Totems +2 Attack.
---
An inspire minion that costs 5 mana and has no immediate impact on the board, hmmmm, easy legend, maybe... hmmm, well... no.
---
Windshear I remember and it's the only halfway decent choice, requiring 5 mana sucks too, if your opponent is killing even a single token per turn you need to wait until turn 7 to "cheat" a 8 mana minion.
---
Look, these are all AWFUL. The ONLY decent card in the deck would be bloodlust except it would be hard to even reach that point anyway because the tokens can't defend themselves and cost 2 mana every time so your early game goes to wash.
---
I always watch his streams. He is so wholesome and knowledgable about the game. Even if his track record on card predictions is spotty, I am absolutely a trump supporter. He is a pillar of the community!
---
You can also get it off Kalecgos, so it'll show up pretty often even if you don't run it in your deck.
---
That's an amazing skin and it really bugs me that there's no way to get it if you don't want to drop $80.
---
How about quest rogue?
---
Plague of death...
---
...but the art shows a sinkhole?
---
Not *that* big of a deal by that stage of the game, Druid's hero power is decent but by no means as strong as getting your value oriented cards to pull double-duty. I think the bigger consideration is actually not being able to run this with Malfurion in Wild, since he's a staple in the kinds of decks this quest would also benefit.
---
I don't think this card is going to be all that impressive in Standard because there simply aren't enough good Choose One cards to go with it (though that might change as the year goes on, even in this set). But in Wild there are a *lot* of cards that will make this absolutely brutal.
---
They print so many good cards for warrior as of late it’s almost ridiculous
---
Does queen of pain still seem as sexual as before.
---
I think the main reason they created reborn was so that they don't have problems with insanely good deathrattles.
---
Plus, if you don't use it the second time, it stays on the board and can go face later.
---
But... why?
---
First they came for the blood, and I said nothing.
---
Then they came for the tits, and again I said nothing.
---
Then they came for the ass, and there was no one to speak for me.
---
Really shooting yourselves in the foot
---
Definitely not disapppointed in the amount of cards introduced :)
---
So I’m assuming completing the quest automatically transforms your hero power, no additional card like Un’goro?
---
They nerfed secret keeper just like Jains, this truly is the darkest timeline
---
A lot less cleavage and buttcheeks.
---
Hence I said since we got Hero portraits added in years ago.  Warrior, Hunter and Mage were first to get the new Heroes....only Mage has had a new once of those 3 and that was very limited and quickly gone
---
And you're a Snowflake. That's probably why you are a Blizzard fanboy.
---
Snowflake, Blizzard, get it? \*insert Ben Brode HAHAHAHAHAHA here*
---
Yeah you can actually kill 6 health taunt minion with this.
---
Lol no one said that cleave is now OP but it’s certainly much better than it was. Now if your opponent drops a sole secret keeper or flame imp or other annoying 1-drop you can kill it.
---
That let's you run two copies of it.
---
&gt; They give free heroes every year
---
That was your argument and it’s factually wrong.
---
Ehh, we kept saying the same thing about Discard lock, and even after it got a decent amount of support towards the end of last year’s rotation... Well, it still wasn’t blazing any trails.
---
I know that Plot Twist’s gimmick doesn’t have Discard’s biggest downsides, but I’m still skeptical about any deck that “just needs a few more supports to be good”.
---
Yeah given he was my only option for anything close to winning that game

Imagine deciding to put a person with zero charisma in charge of giving everyone a first impression of the expansion. What happened to witchwood style videos that were actually funny and cool. Now all they do is just sit in a chair and make lazy humor.
---
When the update launches. I think it's out on PC
---
Did they confirm if Yogg himself can cast Yogg's Puzzle Box?
---
&gt; Bonnie Tyler
---
Just a ~~~smidgen~~~
---
Thank god it's not my device only.
---
Keep in mind the new Hero portrait is Elise for Druid...
---
SAAAAAVVEEEEE (pause) Uldum!
---
Rafaam: why don't we just destroy the rest of Azeroth first then.
---
9 mana 7/7 heal your hero for 4
---
its a problem in cina fine change it for them only like the forsaken models in wow(no bones sticking out) and blood/flesh chanegd to bread.
---
A lot of these are fine. Just annoyed by felstalker, windfury harpy and queen of pain; couldn’t we still have our sexy demon/bird ladies in less revealing poses or something and just still have the sexy demon/bird ladies?
---
My disappointment is immeasurable.
---
What spell is this? The board clear?

The win condition is to rope every turn and hope your opponent has real life commitments more important than hearthstone
---
Sooo..
---
The track is a cover of I need a hero.
---
The Hero's are from a previous expansion.
---
The new focal cards are quests.
---
The new mechanic is rush + ancestral spirit.
---
Member when Blizzard still had an ounce of originality? Ooh I member.
---
You say this as joke, but there is a legit group for MTG that they're very upset about this
---
I liked the paladin one too. But I think I enjoyed hunter quest the most.   
---
After rastakhan, hunter quest deck was a very potent deck. Not really something with an amazing winrate, but it was fun. With halazzi, you could complete the quest much easier, you didn't have to put a bunch of useless 1 mana cards just for the sake of completing the quest, halazzi alone could do it for you. And playing carnassa broods with the hunter spirit on board felt satisfying.  
---
Overall, I had a ton of fun with that one.
---
Does it? People usually pay more for tits and ass
---
deki#2854 EU 80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first
---
&gt; coincidentally very close
---
It's not quite a coincidence. It's because  1/350 is very small. When x and nx are both much smaller than 1, you can approximate 1-(1-x)^n as nx.
---
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_approximation for more detail.
---
Fatigue isn't the issue; dying is the issue.
---
Well, yeah, a bit. But it's honestly more about "do not touch if it works". 
---
Also, removing blood from a card called "[Eviscerate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eviscerate)", but the name itself is apparently fine? Am a bit confused
---
I've been 99% out of hearthstone because I've been playing so much auto chess anyway, but this really just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
---
SOLDIERS OF THE COLD DARK
---
is this like twinspell? meaning when it is "reborn" it doesn't have the reborn keyword?
---
Every hero starts with 1 happiness. To win the game, you have to set your opponent's happiness to 30. The minions have Happiness/Health instead of Attack/Health.
---
Downvote for you
---
tbh that isnt that op if its just jammed into the current jade druid. it doesnt help you win vs control that much and it just hurts you vs aggro. on the other hand a super fast jade druid with auctioneer could get pretty insane with this thing
---
How are these nerfs?
---
I have definitely wondered what their intent is with the Auchenai style effects is. If they found a sweet spot where healing-turned-to-damage can work the same way that Dr. Boom's rush mechs work, we could find a decent control-tempo space for Priest to exist. But I don't think I they're ever going to let those damage effects go face.
---
I don’t really care either way, but some of the new artwork that’s replacing the old is complete ass
---
Booty aside, the old Secretkeeper wasn't drawn very well. The head and torso was way dis proportioned to the rest of the body (even in the context of the looking back pose). Its almost as if the artist went to the Rob Liefeld school of anatomy drawing.
---
"At start the of the game."
---
I think the ironic thing is Shaman currently has some of the best card generation in the entire game she  you take into account all their cards with Hagatha being the cherry
---
Everyone keeps saying this is about the China when there doesn't seem to be any evidence to that at all. Do you have a source for that? Because my guess is that it's more likely that they're trying to look more family-friendly to appeal to a casual market, something they've been doing for years.

---
-Muscle Mage.
---
+Might you cast us a spell?
---
-I CAST FIST.
---
Blizzard seem to be out of ideas, first Goblins vs Gnomes 2: Electric Boogaloo and now League of Explorers 2: Electric Boogaloo. Some might argue that Rastakhan Rumble was The Grand Tournament 2: Electric Boogaloo, but at least RR had a cool Troll theme.
---
I dunno guys, I'm quite disappointed.
---
I agree, there seems to be more situations in which this is better than situations where militia commander is better.
---
This makes me think Reno is going to be a Mage 6 Mana 4/6 battlecry: equip whatever that crystal gun was. Crystal Gun: at the end of your turn cast a random spell
---
Is this a late april fool's joke?
---
Fully disgusted with their art censorship. considering quitting for good.
---
I mean.  Don't you have to play through the tutorial and reach a certain rank to get access to arena?
---
They actually automatically substituted Mind Blast for Radiance in my Aggro Priest.

I feel like Mage is going to have a huge advantage over **Reborn** cards, as it always has an option to easily ping away the minion after it respawns.
---
Since this sub is full of retards it's 90% memes and LULS and giggles and 10% ppl who *really* wonder why now? After 5 years you change the game to be more "childfriendly"? 
---
Guess the lack of communication is the one thing that'll annoy ppl no matter what it is. Just make one comment about it and it's fine. "Due to a new law in X Y Z we gotta adapt some of our art to be more in line" or yatta yatta yatta whatever it is.
---
My heart is conflicted. The artist is Mike Krahulik from Penny Arcade, and people's varying appreciation for the comic aside I dig his art style in general, but it doesn't fit at all with the other cards in Hearthstone. He did Kill Command, Leeroy and Master Jouster and they all stick out like sore thumbs in your hand.
---
RIP SUCCUBUS
---
Source?
---
Literally unplayable.
---
&gt;How is that even bad?
---
Because it's turn 10 and all you've been doing is tapping yourself to death.
---
&gt;It would basically be "1 mana, reduce the cost of 5 cards in your deck to 0."
---
Except you don't actually get those cards until it's very late in the game, where mana is generally less relevant.
---
I would have guessed this was bundled with the Last update, but you are right, We may have to wait.
---
Now I dont know how to deny it when my parents ask me why I am playing children's card game
---
As a disclaimer, I wish they’d unnerf him in Wild since he wouldn’t be as busted in that format and people should be able to play old decks they loved. But I do dispute that he was only frustrating pros. By the time they nerfed Yogg in Standard, I was really just done with trying to grind ladder and having people regularly turn games into coin flips
---
Yeah, not perfect, but better than no decks at all. At least Mage can play control decently, so they'll have a chance of surviving long enough to play it at least once.
---
New players have always been matched in a different way than experienced plays. We've known this for years because an interview between [Hafu and Ben Brode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM1ByFwTjOw). Until this point, the new players have been treated as having an extra loss for matchmaking purposes. So, for a new player at 0-0, they're matched as if they were 0-1. This only applies for the first three runs.
---
Experienced players could always do this, if they wanted to. The difference now is that new players seem to have their own marker so that the matchmaking will prefer to match them with new players.
---
The safeguard is that the experienced arena player has nothing to gain from playing against new players on a new account. It's a small window anyways.
---
Oh, I know. I was there.
---
Its dumb cuz its literally from world of warcraft.  I play as a warlock and i have a succubus ya know?
---
Man everyone's excited about Reno but I'm super hype to see my boi Finley back, yes I am up for an adventure
---
Gross gross gross
---
The other ones are awful, but this one's an improvement for sure.
---
Is there a reason they changed [[Pilfer]] but not [[Blink Fox]]?

Reno gives me such a Saxton Hale vibe I love it
---
You're so angry. What the hell. Calm down.
---
I'm kinda confused why some people here are so passionately enraged by those changes. Sure I don't like those changes either, but my enjoyment of the game won't really change at all because there's a little bit less blood and tits. It's just a fucking card game after all.
---
Is there really anyone here that's upset by that, though?
---
Most realistic answer
---
0:48 Pre-nerf Corridor Creeper
---
Thank fuck for  Khagdar ball for creating multiple copies of [[Sunkeeper Tarim]] during my paladin run.
---
Missed chance for sarlacc pit with that art
---
Always depends on the meta. The meta we have have right now you can go take a shirt for first 4 turns and still have a chance against some decks, but during pirate warrior meta you were probably going to win  the game anyway already if you managed to complete this.
---
&gt; 5 duplicate cards you heal for 25.
---
I disagree.  I interpret this as being heal 20 with 5 duplicates.
---
They turned succbus into a bitch
---
&gt; After 5 years you change the game to be more "childfriendly"?
---
They've been making the game more childfriendly for maybe 4 years now, at least. You're just now noticing, because there are less tits.

Oh this could be decent if big spell mage gets some more support, already have a bit but a couple more pieces and it could be good.
---
Yep it sounds like each Explorer will represent one of the four remaining classes. This probably also mean that we will get class based reprint of the explorers as legendary minions.
---
Did you really care about what other people care?
---
Dangit! Love them 😁
---
Well, Rafaam got the Staff first.
---
This one here I like, but the new Druid portrait doesn't make any sense, looks nothing like her.
---
Why does Queen of Pain have human-like skin and not purple skin. If being too sexy was a reason to change the card, why did they make it more human-like in this regard? You'd think purple would be better and they'd just keep it the same. Weird.
---
Mistress of Pain didn't have much in the boob department.  She's pretty darn buff actually.  I guess it was too much thigh that got her in trouble.  The new one is a bit softer in the muscle department from what I can tell.
---
What about \[\[Silver Hand Regent\]\] ?
---
I loved the Warrior one. Especially with Stonehill and Tar Creeper around. Stall, stall, stall, Ragnaros Hero Power. Fun times. Also loved the Shaman one - it was exactly what Murlocs needed then.
---
I used the Priest one even though it wasn't super powerful. I tried very much to make the Hunter and Warlock ones work to no avail.

Everything about this reeks of censorship and overall "wokeness" at Blizzard.
---
No one but governments and people that will never play your games ANYWAYS complained about this card art.
---
According to blizz:
---
Sexuality=bad
---
Blood of any kind=bad
---
This goes even further as you even retroactively censor character models in warcraft itself, all to appease people you should never bend a knee to to begin with. when did they become so ...spineless?
---
Really? She was pretty robotic.

“The perfect card for a well thought out strategy”

---
Harvest Islamic organs? Yup. 
---
Depict skeletons? Nope.
---
It should be good in Nomi Priest.
---
Why remove succubus entirely? Every kid sees more skin than that when going to the pool or beach.
---
I should have explained. 
---
Hearthstone has two formats, Standard and Wild.  It also receives a new large batch of cards every ~4 months. This will make more sense later.
---
In Hearthstone, cards are rotated out every year around April. On that day, all cards that were released two years ago are rotated out to the Wild format, meaning that those cards are no longer able to be played in standard, but are still playable in Wild. Simply put, all cards ever released are playable in wild, while only the cards released last year and the year to date are playable in standard.
---
This is to help keep the standard meta fresh so that no one archetype has a permanent hold on the meta (and also makes blizzard more money). It also allows new players like you to be able to amass a collection worthy of a top tier deck in standard, as wild decks usually require much more resources and cards to make work right.
---
I personally play only standard myself as I joined last year during the Witchwood expansion, and I recommend you play standard for at least a year before you decide to join in the ranks of wild players.
---
If you ever want to play some decks that I’ve made, PM me and we can play together!
---
Boards which cannot be cleared easily can be quite oppressive for control and mid-range decks, essentially because aggro/tempo decks can put less resources in to creating a threatening board than it takes to clear the board.
---
If these cards are good, deck diversity might lessen.
---
It's the same amount of brawls why would extending the duration change anything?
---
Well, he was a man of his word.
---
Soularium seems to have anti synergy with the plan of a heavy deck that wants to play big things for 0, IMO. I see how the combo works now, though, thanks for the explanation. I'll experiment with it but I'm still not impressed.
---
What the hell are you on about?
---
Yeah, no problems once the update went through.
---
Username checks out
---
Absolutely disgusted that Blozzard is giving into Chines BS.
---
Chines gotem by the [REDACTED] "peanuts".
---
This is just.. wow.. I don’t have any words for this.
---
Changing iconic art because of boobs, booty and blood? Seriously?
---
Really weird. I updated just fine. But I just get stuck on the hearthstone menu. Before getting to the main menu
---
Priest already has an OK time of that. Not to mention you have to actually think about what decks it would be going into. I really don't see this as being that strong in wild, but regardless I fucking hate the card already.
---
....are you serious?
---
Kara was so good the song made it into WOW
---
Why are you booing me? I'm right!
---
Yeah I guess Blizzard employees don’t look at the card they’re naming...
---
tbh they kinda achieve the same thing.... Varg is nice to overdraw the opponent, and has some unique situations sure, but with this just recasting your idols as well I could see it.
---
We've known since April 2017 that Elise was a druid. Peter Whalen [explained](https://twitter.com/LegendaryFerret/status/854220925239148544) that Elise the Trailblazer's attack line "Aluth Neladar" (which is also the attack phrase for the new hero) is a "Druidic attack spell - she's commanding the plants to fight on her behalf. Especially powerful given the local vegetation."
---
Just finish this and then plot twist a hand full of combo cards away. Boom, your whole combo costs 0. Get ready for the memes and the OTKs
---
O.C.D kicking in..... 🥺🤕
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKbMIM2v4JY&amp;t=176s
---
Not all of them, and it's certainly not *insane*.
---
I've had a lot of success with Murloc Shaman lately. It's not too pricey, and runs just fine even without the one legendary it uses.
---
this politically correct is annoying. Sure lock new druid hero behind MASSIVE pay wall. You did that before blizz. But also force this non blood china friendly agenda? Or is this for kid friendly? Not like kids will stick around in this mess of a game. You don't go F2P with no prior experience.
---
Was he even played that much in Mean Streets? As far as I remember he didn't hit his stride before Knights of the Frozen Throne.

There are actually several felhounds in hearthstone, but they're tied to other cards for the most part. Tiny Knight of Evil rides a felhound, the portal cards from the latest set summon 2/2 rush felhounds, Rin's seals summon felhounds, and then Lakkari Felhound is... well a felhound with some tar on it. :P
---
Felpuppies are great and there should definitely be more as actual cards, but yeah I don't think that inclusion should come at the cost of removing another entire demonic race. 
---
I'm assuming they just won't ever print succubi cards again now since they specifically went out of their way to remove the only two in the game with one of them being from way back in GvG that has never really even seen play in wild or otherwise.
---
Hey eyalchen, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).
---
Then why even play malfurion.
---
Sure, but he also doesn't start in your opening hand and isn't as much of a super-charge to certain deck archetypes. Wrath, Starfall, Nourish, and especially Jade Idol are all *nasty* if you can get this completed quickly. Jade Druid is already a pretty decent deck in Wild right now, and while Malfurion is very good in the deck I can't help but feel like the pure value of this quest might edge him out.
---
Actually, weird as it sounds I wonder if you run *both*, and plan on mulliganing the quest in most matchups. You transform into DK Malfurion as soon as possible, spend most of the game that way, then lategame you play the quest/reward as a value engine vs other control decks. Or even the other way around in some matchups; play the quest, get a few turns of value where you toss Jade Idols into your deck, then transform into DK for the defense. Probably not the ideal deckbuilding strategy, but I could see it.
---
 Bootie nerf
---
But for what reason did Blizzard changed Succubus with that shit?
---
/u/shanedestroyer, the prophet.
---
Yes obviously, considering all of the speeches, TED talks, campaigns from feminists and feminist organizations critiquing the sexualization of women in media, specifically video games, etc. Idk if you’ve been living under a rock for the last 10 years, or in a basement, but women have been talking about this.  A lot.
---
On the topic of blood, I know that chinese laws are tighter than US ones when it comes to graphic violence, blizzard is probably making sure they’re compliant, considering China is the #1 country when it comes to mobile gamers.
---
This isn’t a defense of blizzard. It’s a defense of removing hypersexualized depictions of women from a video game.
---
I don’t understand how you can be so upset at the removal of giant boobs. It’s a game. They’re not necessary. Go make your own big titty sex doll card game if you want them so bad
---
Headcrack has a skull in it, which is a big no no in China.
---
We had Raven Familiar(?), which was pretty much just King’s Elekk for spells, so they clearly haven’t dumpstered joust, but we probably won’t see very much of it anymore.
---
first time i hear about. and your first one on sub ive ever seen that mentioned she was a druid. still disapointed she is a druid and not mage though.
---
Aight its kinda clear what's happening here so im out, just gonna uninstall the blizz launcher since I dont want any chinese spyware L O L
---
We do that literally every expansion. Mecha-Jaraxxus sold well enough that they decided to keep selling preorders that way and there clearly is no financial reason for them to do it differently. Meaning, there is no reason.
---
Moonglade
---
the varg highroll off oaken summons is too good to lose, plus its a must remove minion for opponent
---
I thought this said without any mana spent and thought its playable. Leaving a mana or two behind is easy, holy crap.
---
Ah yes, a card that is actually for Mage since her strength are board clears.
---
That's the joke
---
I think the better conclusion of this card being epic is the fact that Blizzard didn’t want Priest to destroy arena with every deck having 3 copies of that card
---
Literally Children's Card Game
---
RIP
---
My thief rogue begs to differ.
---
Warlock can already achieve a Mecha'thun kill, the problem is that the deck/class just sucks overall. Running a quest and gimping your deck to try and have an alternate way of Mecha'thuning is just laughably bad IMO when the deck's shell as is is already too weak. So no, this quest is not what's going to bring Mecha'thun back.
---
/r/holup
---
NO MY SECRETKEEPER’S THICC ASS
---
I've just never tested. Hopefully they work.
---
Blizzard kinda forgot about whirlwind.
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Damn, that’s the most explicit of them all, yet it made it through the censors. 
---
Maybe Blizzard has some kinda quota they have to meet once a year from the Chinese government, and was able to sneak this one by somehow.
---
oversexualized pictures promote objectivisation of women. I’m glad that Blizzard are ruled by mature and responsible people who understand unfair position of a woman in the modern world, though it’s too hard to understand for infants who in all seriousness value the tiny image in videogame

---
It vanished.
---
Ah you're right. I misinterpreted the card then. Anyways, it's still a bit worse than reno and forbidden healing (maybe even shirvallah), but you can still run it for healing in a mostly highlander deck.
---
Question. Im not a native english speaker. But when I read 'down to 1 hour' it sounds to me like the duration of tavern brawl is literally just 1 hour. Where the english teachers at?
---
Shh, no one tell Chine about the cleavage in Auchenai Phantasm or the bone that is visible in Coffin Crashers arm, or the 30 other cards that Chine wants to protect their peoples sensitive eyes from.
---
Trading card games are gambling. This might not be a "trading" card game but the gambling is still there. You buy a pack with earned currency, hope you get what you need/want, and then play a somewhat optimized deck of shuffled cards for the chance to win more. Packs are loot crates (or the other way around if you want to put seniority on it). I ultimately think its just a small series of stupid changes. It won't impact the game as a whole. Like I said above, there are different ways people look at it. Censorship of some kind seems to be a valid complaint from those players. The game thrives on players and the relationship they've built it over the time its existed. To see any changes big or small made without player input is concerning for them. There's only speculation right now for the players protective of the game state. What rules were put in place that said this had to happen? But Im enjoying this discussion quite a bit. I don't speak for you as you don't speak for others but the exchange of reasoning is nicer than most others Ive been seeing around.
---
I crafted two golden Headcracks, and two golden Mistress of Pain. 3200 dust spent solely because I liked the art on these cards, and I like to collect golden versions of my favorite art.
---
The art I liked is gone overnight. No warning, no nada. Disenchanting these replacement cards is a loss of 2800 dust. 
---
Blizzard, please reconsider your dust policy. I spend money on this game. I spent money on these cards. This feels terribly unfair.
---
I thought this was some dumb combo I couldn't figure out for far too long.
---
Yup, I don't think China is the reason.
---
Can we please stop citing Ben Brode? He's not part of Blizzard anymore and anything he said doesn't stand anymore.
---
Eh, I'm tired of this crap.
---
This is a massive paywall.
---
Hey now, you're not allowed to have an ass. We're going to have to change your card art.
---
\[Drools in RNG\]
---
No you will absolutely just die lol. Bomb warrior already counters combo, it would counter **warlock** combo that needs to draw it's whole deck stupid hard.
---
I don't even think that'd be the main problem though, if Bomb Warrior didn't exist Mecah'thun Warlock would still suck, it would just have 1 less bad matchup.
---
They said snippy boy will rotate out with Boomsday I think, even if he got introduced much later.
---
The moment I saw the portraits of the explorers pop up I got chills  
---
I'm fucking excited
---
BOOM, LOOKING FOR THIS??

I mean I run both... I cut out 1 oaken summons and 1 spreading plague for the 2 dirty rats, the oaken summons for that very reason and the spreading plague because its a card that in a lot of matches just sits in hand 2 copies with no way to get rid of (but keep 1 because it is amazing in situations where its good).. I found that to be a good balance.
---
Idk it possibly could, because now they have a bank full of brawls to switch to instantaneously. They don't need to spent as much time thinking up new themes, implementing new mechanics (co-op boss battles), or making pre-made decks (that are balanced to a decent degree). Obviously this all depends on how big a team they have and which are reponsible for these things, but wouldn't think it insane for it to be the case. Last few brawls I've played have been repeats of similar ones in the past, down to the same pre-chosen classes.
---
It’s probably better if you’re running thing from below in a wild deck. Can cheat him out quicker, and if it’s cheated out on the same turn as this, it’s about 300 times better.
---
Whether Sir Reginald the 1st exists or not is a mystery.
---
This seems like a Solo Adventure Treasure card.
---
This one even has bob and blood
---
[FTFY](https://imgur.com/gallery/GjQlbJP)
---
Can yogg cast more than one of these?? If yes that would be amazing lol
---
It could be that they've only changed a few to see how the community reacts to them or because they've gotten the artworks commissioned and they're still waiting on all the submissions.
---
This is actually an awsome background thanks
---
Stop defending soulless corporations and their censorship. Seriously.
---
https://imgur.com/a/XWe9IOe

I will not be seeing your future replies.
---
And icehowl... shit, if icehowl had rush instead of "can't attack heroes..."
---
Cannot cast itself.
---
Can someone please clarify, If I have this hero power and play \[\[Druid of the Scythe\]\] , will I have a 6/6 Rush/Taunt or a (4/2)/ (2/4) with Rush/Taunt.
---
Are you butt or tits guy?
---
Blizz:
---
That card was already nerfed terribly a couple of years ago, though; another nerf and the community would riot. 
---
Also, that’s actually a male Tauren, so that chest is just fine. Look at [[Illidan Stormrage]].
---
I can understand that giving us multiple options is too much but I don't understand the idea behind the changes like Jaina's chest and removing blood. Do they expect to reach new markets where people are not open minded about these topics? (middle east?) I mean at this point the playerbase is pretty much settled and I don't think I've ever seen a thread where people were offended by this kind of details. I'm fine with the idea of new artworks, they are nice, but changing details like drops of blood really intrigues me...
---
Because you're playing the entire game with 1 less card and missing turn 1, just to get a discount on a few cards at best without additional synergy? If you think this card is good standalone, then please I implore you to try out some random decks with it.

3/2/2 | Choose One - Transform into a 4/2 with Rush; or a 2/4 with Taunt.  
---
So the Shadows deck is just a dead slot now.
---
It should list your entire deck and reduce the count or grey out cards as you draw them
---
Exactly, the time between brawls is still one week. You're completely right
---
Nah man, it's always Myra's into Cataclysm.
---
Yah OP messed this one up
---
Just pare this with the image of the Corridor Creeper(?) being destroyed behind him in the fireball and you'll have a great meme for pointing out that cards are being nerfed. Thanks, Blizzard!
---
It's a voluntary choice made by the people developing it. There's nothing wrong with it.
---
You mean before he was nerfed. Now for some reason they give Yogg an unnerfed Yogg.
---
overlay with the old art or something like that plz
---
I play wild, so Id rather have the same priest board clear. Priest receiving new board clear after no board clear is not great when none of them ever go away.
---
Rafaam goes by the title "Supreme Archaeologist" in his adventure. If you think this is over the top, you might be pleased to hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK8rNtiJYWs).
---
glad to see they're keeping the theme throughout the classic set of the flavor texts being mostly fucking terrible
---
Sometimes they don't have a shieldslam. And you must try something before the turn 10 is coming. After turn 10 the game is almost lost if you don't deal damage. And don't forget that you can just straight up lose the board to control warrior and the game is over.
---
[removed]
---
No it wasn't hard to understand but it always felt weird to me.
---
Pretty trash. There’s been lots of other ways to have 0 mana Warlock hero powers in the past with Odd/Even Warlock and Wilfred Fizzlebang and it never works
---
That makes smurfing even less attractive, that's a lot of fucking work to kill newbies in Arena to compensate
---
I mean, it was said long ago that lackey support was going to be a thing this whole year.  If this is the extent of "card generation" in shaman this set, I think we'll all be ok.  Weakness doesnt have to mean non existent.  
---
And, I'd hardly call this card playable.  Its strictly worse than slurper, and I'd argue worse than cable rat too.  Lackeys aren't that important in most shaman decks as is, I hardly see this being the center point of any kind of deck.
---
this, so much this
---
edit: Thanks for the silver
---
That seriously makes 0 sense
---
True. If we get some control-focused lackeys, this card could find a home. But currently all lackeys have favored aggro playstyles (save, arguably, Ethereal Lackey which is useful in both aggro and control match ups) and this card is way too slow for an aggro deck.
---
Sure thing.
---
I think what they mean is no serious meta deck plays Twisting Nether, aka Zoolock doesn't run it.
---
I'm really trying to imagine why making a childrens card game more kid-friendly makes you sad. Were you also mad when they didn't print any new cards with blood on them... idk maybe ever?
---
 80g NA Choco#1508. I'll show, you go first.
---
it takes out the rather violent nature of the art, and updates it to NOT show someone being impaled, devoured, bloodlet, or with a broken head. makes the game more stylish and fits the aesthetic they go for in the animated stuff, players aren’t literally murdering eachother, just having a fun game of punch-fireball-swords
---
I craft golden cards because I like the art they way other people craft meta decks. Not sure how this makes me the bad guy or Mr. Moneybags. It’s a collectible card game. The art is the most important part of the card for some of us.
---
Finally they hired more staff to clean the mess after the brawl faster.
---
Did Activ shareholders came down to their senses and become more human ? Faith in humanity restored !!
---
Yes please
---
&gt; I will not name the region that this is clearly meant to cater to, because mods are already deleting those posts. Draw your own conclusions there.
---
Game already has China-specific alternative art, had it for years, mostly about skeletons. Why would Blizzard change that now and start using the same for everyone?
---
Regardless of the power or viability of this card, I just want to talk about its NAME. This was probably a pain in the rear for Blizzard’s localization/translation team to get right, considering Rafaam’s “Supreme Archaeologist” line might not have been so well known in other languages.
---
So it's also self-censoring that they never printed cards with blood since the classic set, are you also mad about that? Self-censoring also applies to things that are done pre-emptively after all.
---
Do you think there are zero limits on what should be in a product designed for kids?
---
Sexy woman = bad. To appease Chinese censorship, and also the type of people who want to ban cheerleaders and models and such.
---
Wild heal paladin gonna be sick with nozari, these two and reno. And before some of you complain that u can't heal w/ reno if you got duplicates; yeah. I know. Still got 3 max heals so shut up
---
Brand isnt a druid, he is a mage. If you want a druid you are better looking at Udyr or Nidalee, but Udyr is more shamanistic
---
It's crazy that [[spike ridged steed]] hasn't been mentioned yet. Its exactly what we're talking about? Or did I miss the joke?
---
After having more than 9 deckslots for so long, it's finally catching up to us. They're collecting our debt
---
RENO IS BACK BOYSSS EAT SHIT AGGROFUCKS
---
Yes but how is "play a murloc deck" more of a condition than "play a quest deck"?
---
but she's a blood elf

6/-/- | Give a minion +2/+6 and Taunt. When it dies, summon a Stegodon.  
---
The first 10 packs of a new expansion guarantee 1 legendary. After that a timer starts and the longest you can go without a legendary after that is 39 packs. The 40th pack will then have a legendary guaranteed and then it resets again.

---
Dave Kosak's voice sounded a bit strange in this video.
---
Yes.
---
Oh ok thank you for the info
---
You think 4 mana to draw 2 cards, gain 12 armor, and give your minions +2 attack isn't enough?
---
You just mulligan the quest against aggro, and against control you'll always float mana anyways and it gives you a huge amount of value.
---
😍
---
Not really, those two cards are only comparable in “played stats”. One re-summons a 3/1 the other not, one can go face and the other not and one heals you for 3 and the other one doesn’t. The damage potential of the new one is also double, due to Rush on the 1st and 2nd minion
---
It doesn't, I'm just giving you the context for OP's nonsense
---
I meant HC, I'm not 100% sober :P
---
&gt; It becomes censorship when it had already existed and then changed like so. Please search "censorship".
---
Literally not true. You completely made that definition up lol. Self censorship often happens at the creative level long before any product is made.
---
If you buy the 80 pack bundle, you're guaranteed 2 legendaries **at minimum**. The average rate of legendary drops from packs is still 1 in 20-ish. So you're still likely to get around 4. Hitting the pity timer is not a common occurrence.
---
You're guaranteed a Legendary within the first 10 pack openings of a new set. New set, in this case, meaning a set that you've never opened any packs for. Afterwards, the maximum distance between any two legendaries cannot exceed 40. So, the worst case scenario is that you get a legendary on your 10th pack and 49th pack.
---
Mass hysteria is rare though
---
This issue is actually resolved in this patch. Sorry it wasn't included in the patch notes!
---
Note that we were only able to get a partial fix in for this release, so you might see a little visual weirdness when this happens (but no more invisible cards). Expect that weirdness to be cleaned up with the Saviors of Uldum patch.

[[Bwonsamdi, the Dead]]

[[Princess Talanji]]
---
In the Dalaran Heist there's a boss with this hero power, and for all cards like that it summons the minions then buffs them.
---
&gt; Your attempts to explain how self-censorship isn't actually censorship are sad, pathetic, and embarrassing.
---
Except they're not even saying that, so your attempt to criticize them for it is what's embarrassing. They're saying everyone self-censors, which is literally true. There is no blood in any of the art for certainly any recent expansions, maybe any expansions at all, that is all "self censorship" as well.

Lorewise All blood Elves are High Elves,
---
There was always a Velen + Mind Blast +  Holy Smite combo deck floating around. I say combo loosely because it was more of a surprise reach in a standard control priest deck that no one ever suspected to have reach.
---
I love that these are a combination of quests and death knights without the most polarizing aspects of each.
---
This has literally been the tone of the entire game from the beginning. The only reason these cards weren't part of that is because their art was lifted from the old wow tcg.
