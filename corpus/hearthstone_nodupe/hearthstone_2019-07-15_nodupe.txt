I guess your right, but my main point was that other classes didn't reach that step quite yet and some of them are far from it
---
---
---
(Hmmmmm intensifies)
---
I only play Wild, so I had no idea. :-D
---
You can be F2P if you don't mind trashing your whole collection to make 1 or 2 decks.
---

---
If you wanna enjoy playing the game, it's like any other forms of entertainment, you gotta spend a bit to experience the real content.
---
Oh yeah you're right I actually meant to put it in
---
There's a way around it if you convert a deck to wild, then back to standard it should end up as the last standard deck
---
Nice
---
Gurubashi chicken is pretty underrated. It deserved it tho to be fair.
---
On mobile from a reasonable distance away I keep thinking it's a card with Kripp's face pasted on it
---
World record I think was deadly stare on turn one
---
But of course
---
1 hp minions without some deathrattle mechanics are just a bit underwhelming, specially if they have a mechanic that forces them to survive a turn. Rogue, Mage and Druid can kill it just with hero power.
---
*Sounds of crushing walls in the background*
---
I get the whole omega = 10 theme but yeah dealing 10 damage on a 4 cost vanilla statted minion is absurd in a deck that has endless ways to make it to 10 mana
---
Thoughtsteal
---
Druid didn‚Äôt have enough ways to trigger the eggs and it does what they‚Äôre good at already but do easier, which is flood the board.
---
Hunter did already ? I expected him to be one of the last to reach that. (And crushing walls isn't really a board clear it's more like targeted removal)
---
But it's a testament to how long you've been playing the game.
---
I can't help you if you aren't paying attention or your mind is made up after 15 of 135 cards. Feel bad for you, man.
---
Play Barnes, summon blood of the ancient one
---
Hell yeah, I just opened that baby and I can't stop playing it since. Mostly wild tho cause the priest version is a bit slow in standard, but fun in wild with Druid.
---
Was considering crafting Hemet to play it with priest too in wild, as it seems to be a better option maybe faster.
---
There are just too many decks possible using mecha'thun as a win condition, for every classes, both standard and wild, some obviously stronger than other but never short of a good laugh.
---
Woah. Stop.
---
They just don't know better. My win rate improved a lot after cutting it and there was a time when even vS wrote the deck was better without it.
---
So that's how you climb up the ladder...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm glad I finally get to afford a decent deck.
---
Dusting Mecha'thun ? 
---
What kind of monster does that ?
---
muster wasn't in standard when this card was
---
Maths also confirms it adds up
---
Woah what site is that??
---
My that claws bite!
---
Looks interesting,  looking forward to giving bgg it a go!
---
I reached legend with a Reno Lock a few months ago and I run shadow bolt for a fair amount of games. I changed the list a few times to address the situation but it was good when I used it.
---
That doesn't mean they always will.
---
I put \[\[mountain giant\]\]s in my miracle rogue. It's skill testing and having a lot of options. It is super unfavorable against warriors, while quite competitive against hunters and mages and shamans.
---
What is that?

Yeah but that‚Äôs a singleton deck so it can run less good cards. I‚Äôm not saying shadowbolt is bad it‚Äôs just fair. And fair cards aren‚Äôt too amazing in hearthstone. Adding a slight upside to a fair card won‚Äôt make it broken was my point, just more likely to see play.

How‚Äôd you get the third?

Thats a pretty smart move tbh I might try that out
---
Have fun getting it again
---
Prep + Coin
---
I didn't say it was in Wild. My point is just that Shadowbolt is actually a good card, by no means broken, but dealing four damage for three mana is better than it seems. Or maybe it was just because of Totem Golem. I don't think BEEES! is broken btw.
---
U also get better prize for 40 min

I looked at the rest of the at as well and I love a lot of the other creatures. Drawing humans is difficult

I always liked the way [Ivory Knight] gave you a choice between taking the "best" card and taking the one for the bigger heal.  It was also interesting how it gave away information about what you took.
---
If Paladin's theme is gonna be "1 health minions" I doubt the new cards are gonna be used. One health minions need to have very good effects to be even remotely playable. If you're trying to build a board by putting a bunch of them in your deck, you're gonna get assblasted.  
---
Mages have fireblast and arcane explosion and arcane missiles and just blizzard, Warrior whirlwind bullshit, Warlock just has better zoo and also imps and also just warlock control shit, Hunter has unleash the hounds, murloc Shaman has better zoo and other Shaman has lightning storm, Rogue has fan of knives... I'm not just listing any card that deals with one mana minions, I'm listing cards that are right now being played consistently because they're really good EVEN WITHOUT a one health centered deck running around the ladder.

Play around with the decks you have and watch a lot of streaming.  A lot of shit has changed in the past few years.
---
Also there's a new update coming out before long anyways
---
That's actually really cool, I'd wear it
---
imagine having this easy of a photoshop and doing this bad of a job
---
Best worst pack I‚Äôve ever seen
---
My heart stopped for a moment as I wondered "that's shouldn't be possible in the Rag Raid?" But yes while in Rag Raid it says "Big Bad Ragnaros" in the top left. 
---
Still, great job, Rag's gonna be feelin' that one for a hot minute.
---
I dunno about you, but when my entire deck revolves around a specific bunch of cards, it's very rare that I draw the exact cards I need at the start of the game, and for the subsequent 4 turns.
---
Unless of course you remove all weapons, secrets, removals and draw from your deck and run nothing but 1 health minions...
---
Seems blizzard have finally learned their lesson on snowball 1drops
---
So this isn‚Äôt available right now right? The only tavern brawl?
---
You will get 2 golden legendaries.
---
This is the quality content i stay subbed for
---
A new expansion is coming out next month, so I wouldn't do any major crafting or disenchanting until then. For now, I'd recommend you play with what you have and spend gold you earn on packs of the sets you've missed so you can get the guaranteed legendary within the first ten packs of each. After that, I'd start saving for the next expansion.
---
You can check out sites like HSReplay and Vicious Syndicate to see the best decks that are in the meta right now to get an idea of what to expect, but a lot of those will likely change when the new expansions comes out.
---
Bruh 2 headed giant is 2v2. Brawl coop is a 2v bot
---
I *think* the Arena is technically the more valuable; you're guaranteed 1 pack even if you lose three matches in a row right outta the gate, so worst case scenario you're getting 1 pack per 150 gold (which is 50 gold more expensive than just buying it at the in-game store). Having said that, if you can reliably get 4 wins, then that's likely going to get you 1 card pack, 50-ish gold, and another reward that could be 10-25 gold or a rare card. The value just increases from there.
---
In particular, this page might be helpful:
---
https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Arena#Reward_structure
---
Notice the way that it gives packs, though: your guaranteed card pack will always be from the most recent set (currently Rise of Shadows) and any others that you earn through the game will be from other Standard-mode sets. If you can reliably get 7 wins, you'll start seeing Arena runs literally paying for themselves.
---
I'd personally rather buy adventure modes because I'm all about story and PvE content and challenging abnormal scenarios, but I ultimately spent 2800 gold for fewer card packs than you'll get in the arena with 1400. Sure, one of them was a pack where all the cards were guaranteed to be golden, and that appeals to the collector in me, but it's not for everyone. :-)
---
Bruh, they're both based off cooperation. That's my fucking point
---
It‚Äôs up there, odd rogue and even shaman are stronger. Odd rogue is built to perfection, odd paladin is consistent. So far odd paladin looks like it got a few strong cards, but we‚Äôll have to see if rogue gets anything worth taking as well.
---
People are just tired of it, because it is one of most played decks for last two years.
---
3 average is breaking even.
---
6 average means you can get one run per day with the gold from your daily quest, huge profit
---
7 average means you can get one run per day without your daily quest
---
Congrats on getting your art onto the set :)
---
Hurr durr le shop!!!
---
As a Rogue player, yup.  üòï
---
Tha face and neck. It's funny, the first time I saw the card I thought "That's weird..". Apparently I wasn't the only one.
---
It is so popular at lower ranks because it is so easy to play and it is really hard to do something wrong. If you have 10 minutes on toilet and dont wanna think about playing a game much, big priest is your best choise.
---
What I did was 100% logical. If it didn't work I couldn't get the legendary quests anyway. You are the dumb one for not realizing that.
---
That's true, thanks.
---
Interesting, how it's going to work with 1hp minions :\\
---
I'd say it's worse having 2 Pyroblasts. You only need one really.
---

Great perspective.  Love to see an artist roll with criticism.
---
Thats not how art works
---
I mentioned **past** 3 turns not next. 
---
Your deck is clearly designed to exploit  slower, more passive decks and more proactive/aggressive decks like the two decks you mentioned just happen to be your counters. It‚Äôs normal for any deck. I wouldn‚Äôt be too fussed about it.
---
https://twitter.com/DarrochBrown/status/1149372308764540930
---
If you're an aggro deck though, you're not necessarily unhappy that they're spending their turn 2 pinging your 1-drop.
---
**Battlecry:** Cast **Erif Renni** on all minions in your hand and deck.
---
I don't know if I'm being a prick, but those last three Paladin cards were pretty boring.
---
Solid Card. Looks like Paladin will get some kind of Swarm/Zoo Archetype again this will make it a 1 Mana drop with 4-5 Attack in many cases can be killed off easily but it is so cheap that this wont be a  big problem.
---
put me to sleep.
---
GG
---
So I was right that you have not been on this Reddit for a long time :-P. Welcome back then, and hopefully you'll meet people who are nicer than I am.
---
btw
---
They already released two AoE's which can get through SotF.
---
they did it this way, because those quests are progress, not single quests. this way it takes only one quest space (out of 3)
---
god forbid they would make special UI for event quests (like is perfectly done in Hots), but hey, what can you do
---
Mental note to not communicate with foreigner by repeating the last word they say
---
I guess actually it's pretty sweet that it pulls the trash out of your deck so that you don't draw it late game.
---
It won't be the only win condition, of course. Just a backup win condition in case the other things don't work out.
---

---
THANKS OP!!!
---
Probably is a dick comment to invent conspiracies about evil things you think someone's girlfriend might have done.
---
Thats a fair enough point
---
The new one drop can snowball pretty dang hard and [[Righteous protector]] is a great complement to it.  I think it makes the cut in odd paladin lists.

This has more to do with feminism in the west than China.
---
Shirvallah and 2 new card was beast so i wonder if they will give beast support in paladin
---
I noticed this too yet I havn't seen any news about it
---
If its summon 1 health minions, then it shoukd be really easy to complete. Noble sacrifice, hero power, the new cards, crystology, Questing Explorer would all make it really easy to complete. It depends then what the reward is.
---
Found Best Girl of the set.
---
She's my waifu now! Nobody touch her!
---
*Back to your homes!*
---
Crystology is one *Attack* minions, not one Health. But yes, Crystology is still a fantastic option to draw, say:
---
1. Novice Engineer, if you want the card draw *that much.*
---
2. Bloodmage Thalnos, especially if the reward gives 1-Health minions Reborn (double draw).
---
3. Mecharoo - if it's "Summon 1 Health minions," then Mecharoo double-dips and contributes twice.
---
The thing is if it's "Summon" they could easily make the Quest require that you summon a lot. The Quest could read "Summon 10 1-Health minions," or it could read "Play 6 1-Health minions." Summoning 1-Health minions is easier, but they can counteract that by increasing the amount you have to summon.
---
Why? They're a sweet detail, even if it's fantasy stuff, it's cool to have some realistic touch here and there
---
They always just send one messages and then remove me from friends. All I want is to share 80g quests :(
---
Player 1: OK, I'll play a deck with no early game or board clears.  
---
Player 2: Swarms the board with low cost minions.  
---
Player 1: *Surprised Pikachu face*
---
Its not a conspiracy when the exact same drawing was posted here. His/her GF traced the original picture, or theyre ethereal twibs who think and act the same way without knowing each other, to the point where they create the exact same portrait.
---
Strangely enough that never happens to me and I mostly play RNG Decks like otk mage with help of lunas pocket galaxy or darkest hour warlock in standart. So to say stupid decks that can instalose with bad RNG but that makes a win even more satisfying
---
Ahh yea I forgot Shirvallah is a beast ^^ It's hard to tell tho, since beast is not paladin's identity. Kappa
---
Crowax is that you? GG.
---
That‚Äôs some bullshit man
---
a large number of leeroy jenkins and togwaggle's dice
---
Yes, both of those.  Will Odd Pally definitely run them?  No, but it could.  4/1 on turn 1 that grows even more every turn will steal some games.  If they kill it, great, they killed your 1-drop, big whoop.
---
The thing that grinds my gears. Is that back when I installed. You instantly logged in and could seamlessly continue where you were. This was somehow deemed inappropriate and replaced with a two minute login sequence that's repeated if you just swap app and check a text or any outside action.
---
Blizzard: "Let's focus on class identity"
---
Also Blizzard: "Let's make Beast Zooladin!"
---
I don't think warrior is there quite yet though. I agree he has a lot of removal but board clears are rarer I  warrior I think.
---
Yeah I agree that would be the meme dream
---
Against aggro you have chance only through good draws. Fan on 3, kobold into bunch of Rags and so on. Without that they roll through you with ease.
---
I'd like a ladder where you can ban one class and you never have to play against them
---
In the future how would I be able to tell if it‚Äôs active?
---
It will rotate eventually, and then we can complain about Shaman again.
---
The new event was fantastic. Because it was slightly underpowered, it opened the door to speed running. It totally changed my gameplay. 
---
The devs have been doing a great job on this whole expansion. I thought giving out meta warping cards like Sn1p  Sn4p and Vargoth for free was brilliant. It elevated the game for everyone and made the game more enjoyable.
---
You have hidden the best part!
---
I still disagree - if you want a full list, hunter has springpaw and scalehide, warrior as I mentioned has good one drops and is already good against aggro, shaman currently has zap and likkim, rogue mage and druid are self explanatory. 
---
This card cannot snowball nowhere near as hard as unnerfed STB could as it often gets killed before being able to attack. There‚Äôs a reason you don‚Äôt see 1 mana 2/1s that often - historically good one drops are good because they almost guaranteed 1 for 2 in one sense or another - argent squire and 1/3s are hard to kill, acornbearer provides value, deckhand often has an immediate effect etc..
---
Imo this card is perfectly fine by itself and calling it scummy/toxic is still an overreaction.
---
Thaurisan
---
Thats an honour to him
---
If your main reason to run Cone is to kill minions, it's just way overpriced [[Shooting Star]]. It has it's niches, but it's never worth it to run it in any deck other than super late game ones. When it comes to killing the new Paladin 3/1 token creator, first of all, it's a deathrattle so no three tokens unless the tokens are from a different guy. Secondly, you still only trade 1 for 1 as the tokens are included in the card so you're not getting any card advantage at all. Third, if those tokens would be 2 mana 2/1's as you stated in the "7 mana and 3 cards" part, no one would ever run that card anywhere. So obviously they are 1 mana 2/1's.

This is an excellent comparison actually. Donald Trump is not the sort of president that stands by and waits for the circumstance to be in his favor. Trump charges in and hits the issue hard. No one hit's their opposition so hard as Trump. Trump knew what got presidents elected, so he went for that and he got it. He has managed to go through his entire career without an extreme crisis occurring that tends to swoop political opinion, so I suspect he will win again (goodbye karma).
---
Trump is much like Leeroy Jenkins, like a Leeroy Jenkins who charged into battle laughing in the dragon's faces. So far he's killed nearly half of them on his own. We will see if he has enough chicken for round 2.

I know, but they forgot to update their page too, that¬¥s why I¬¥m making it.

Except they do nerf decks that oppress certain archetypes and are just unfun. If you don't think this being around for 2 years is problematic then I'm sure you were against the Quest Rogue nerfs too, after all that deck didn't have a high ladder winrate either.
---
You don't need to be so utterly condescending in your comments either. Shouldn't the fact that it doesn't have such a high winrate yet people still want it changes be a sign that there is a problem with the design, not just it being strong right now? Like why does it having a low winrate go with

Overkill works when something deals damage on your turn.  Otherwise spells with Overkill wouldn't trigger, since a spell can't attack.
---
If you consider it to be an honor to be compared to an openly racist pedophile without morals, scruples or even the vaguest sense of right and wrong, then I suppose there‚Äôs nothing that can be gained by debating it with you.

You have to be patient, they have limited resources so they have to go each step at a time.

Because it's bollocks? I'm sure they would rather Mage have good conditions, not rely on 1 broken one.

I haven't played much in 2018. How did handlocks get a giant out on turn 3? That's not possible with just life tap. Also a Handlock giant is not as bad because you can chip it down. Sure, you'll take some damage from it, but if you deal 4 to it this turn and then 4 next turn it will die. You have to kill all mage giants in one turn. If only one survives with a single health it was all for nothing. That's what feels so bad about it. There needs to be a low roll in the 12 mana slot.

this card will be an isue at some point if not already. its one of those effects that can be abused. even now with carfs like cult master acolyte and overkill. i would not be surprised if at some point this card can only target your opponent's units. right now it still seems fine though.

When they play their shit at the beginning of their turn and then sit there i tend to lean more towards BM.....and if it's consistently every turn like that not really sure how that can be thinking through a play.....if that's how you play you may want to consider doing the thinking before you play your cards not after

It‚Äôs a combo deck that relies on highrolling, and people feel crappy when they play against the high roll. That‚Äôs what combo decks are, it happens, I‚Äôve accepted that long ago. 
---
The only part that I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy is the freeze aspect. There isn‚Äôt anything fun about getting your board frozen 4 turns in a row while they peck you down with the one giant they tossed out and duplicate it further each turn while you can‚Äôt do anything with your minions

Well right now your comments are at -6 and -10. Guess that was all me?

SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST

That's not what I'm saying at all? I'm saying winrate by itself doesn't indicate if a deck is oppressive or warps the meta.

Yikes, I almost rerolled mine! Thanks for the heads up!

---
you: Do you require my assistance?

yes, i assumed so based on the fact you waste your own time because your opponent is playing a deck you dont like. maybe you wouldnt hate warrior so much if you didnt purposefully extend your games with them?

I mean, you're pretty good at smashing a wall.

And then on the other hand you have warrior which has 15 single target removal in standard so you can go tall, but also punishes you for going wide with brawl and collider.
---
If not for the early giants you couldn't keep warrior in check so...
---
The players are dragons?
---
Or it's just not very good
---
Difficult decks have winrates driven down by the masses that copy-paste when they see how good a deck can be. (See: patron warrior). The fact that moderate-to-difficult deck can be &gt;=50% while brainlets drive it down is a testament to how good the deck is

Agree, I think I'd much rather see this than other's ideas where you can summon a bunch of cheap minions in one turn and even give them all a deathrattle to all summon their own cheap minions and if on any turn the opponent can't clear them, use one of your cards that gives them all +3 to 5 attack to end the game.

I definitely have interest in adventure, I think it‚Äôs a nice mix up if you want something other than arena or ranked! It just seems like it cost so much, and I didn‚Äôt want to spend so much gold as a new player not knowing if it has better value than arena runs considering I don‚Äôt have that many cards yet. I‚Äôll give the site a check and see what it says though!
---
Holy shit thats amazing
---
Yeah, for some reason I'm seeing posts questioning the interaction between BEEEES and Overkill every day. But just one read of the keyword should be enough to understand it. Or thousands of comments saying that it works, or an official developer word. But hey, that's what sometimes happens when a new interaction is introduced.
---
A more complicated issue in this case is whether Bees will immediately disappear from the board after they die, or stay there until the entire spell resolves. And I believe that latter is the case (although that one is not as intuitive).
---
Player base is big, updates are every month or so, and you can play any deck you like bit there are always some decks that are just straight up better than others.
---
Nope. We already knew this (try playing Mass Hysteria while you have an Overkill minion on board). Besides, Peter Whelan confirmed it in a tweet back when BEES!!! was first revealed.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently working on, hopefully I can hit it before the event thing ends or whatever it is
---
You used 9 lives on a cost 1 minion?
---
Yep, same thing happened to me. Thought I could just reroll one of the quests that I didn't want to complete and still get the Legendary quest for the next day.... Nope.
---
Game is still very active there is a next expansion in the next month so things will get mixed up a lot again so if you start just save your gold until next expansion hits

No, you can test this using Mass Hysteria and and Overkill minion. Also, the devs already confirmed that BEES!!! + Overkill *will* work.

Thanks

Mojo master isn‚Äôt a card you build around, but rather a card you tech in to slow control or combo decks. Just build a fun midrange or aggro deck and play mojomaster as a way to keep decks like warrior from playing dr,Boom or what have ya.
---
Well hey, at least it was silenced so it couldn't summon any more dudes. A 2/5 is just a worm at that point.
---
Ticket Scalper is great, but it's purely a card draw mechanic. You get 8 cards for 2 cards and 7 mana = 6 cards advantage. In case of Cult Master, you get 4 cards for 2 cards and 7 mana = 2 cards advantage. But you also get a 4/2 body on the board (which can draw you more cards) AND you get to deal 4 damage to opponent's minion. Cult Master is also better to combo with 2x BEEEES on the same turn.
---
Both interactions are good, but for different things. Ticket Scalper is purely card draw, Cult Master is more like a mini-Ultimate Infestation.
---
Either way, the card is really interesting with the number of interactions, and it's the one I'm excited most from the ones revealed so far.
---
Are there any cards that i can only get if i pay or i can just play alot and get everything by time

I definitely should go watch some streamers and pause to see what I would do, and then see what they do. I might just try an arena run a day, and see if I can at least break even and get my gold back. If not, I‚Äôll just leave it be and keep saving. I did see some information about the new expansion. I don‚Äôt know much about it yet, but I guess I‚Äôll have to just do some research.
---
That's where the 0.01% comes in
---
I agree my judgment on the meta is not firm yet and maybe he reasonI've been fighting priest players is because they cant climb the ladder and are stuck in the opening ranks and that's why I fought them nonstop after a whole season of inactivity.
---
I defer to all that. Absolutely you're right. 
---
But my point still stands that priest mechanics are there to nullify your actions in the game - they frustrat without much resource spent on their part. the priests goal is to basically bring the game back to zero over and over  and over again. 
---
Am I desperate for a win? I should probably play bomb hunter or bomb warrior - easy.
---
I dont play to just win though I play to enjoy the game, I stopped playing the game for a while I wanted to enjoy it, fall in love with it again before dropping another 100$ on the uldum expansion. 
---
But instead I faced a lot of unfun mechanics that reminded me that TFT/autochess exists and is considerably more fun
---
Quest rogue got so gutted I actually agree it should come back in wild. It‚Äôs not like the deck is that good on ladder anyways. It was always a anti control pick that warped tournaments but on ladder, where the majority of players play aggro, I doubt it‚Äôll do well even if the minions go back to 5/5s lol.  
---
And raza priest honestly seems like such a fun deck. I started playing around that meta (I played cubelock in that meta), and those matchups were always very skill intensive.
---
Okay but like, I had a priest turn 3 summon obsidian statue after he coined to use barnes
---
I screamed
---
...Yes it does? It has rush still when it's reborn. It may not be efficient but it *does* kill it.
---
Barnes writes an autobiography
---
Absolutely insane luck. Go buy a lottery ticket
---
Cyclone Mage like the ladder deck one?
---
I agree. Make it single cast and it suddenly feels far more balanced.
---
Before the murloc raid leader was nerfed (just the hp +1 I think), I remember beating the lich king with mainly murloc decks for pretty much all classes
---
and the play 3 tavern brawl legendary quest
---
&gt;The reason why these decks are so successful mostly comes down to their performance against the two most popular decks in the current meta. Both Big Priest and Quest Mage shine when they‚Äôre given time to execute their power turns but run into difficulties when faced with unrelenting aggression. When the meta is defined by two anti-control decks, SMOrc becomes the way.

---
I play a ton of Priest and it‚Äôs the worst class in Standard at the moment. Still a lot of fun decks to try like Aggro Mechs, Resurrection, and Steal Priest. None are top tier but they‚Äôre fun and if you play them well you can still climb the ladder with them. In Wild I prefer my Dragon Spiteful Priest. Played over 300 games with that deck so far.
---
Contrary to what those guys say about it being not a build around card the only reason it isn't is because of 6 mana cost. At 5 mana you could easily make a deck around the combo. I'd say don't worry about it yet and wait for the next expansion.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest this either
---
A) Is an attempt to siphon more money out of hopeful players pockets but making an alt account and making a redemption post.
---
B) You ordered something from him and he half-assed and sent it to you for free as long as you make a post about it.
---
The craftsmanship is absolutely shit. Corners are jagged and the print looks like printer paper was used and just covered in resin. If you are happy with this and you did pay for it then that‚Äôs fin but I‚Äôd be interested how much you payed for this if you did. Anything over 10$ for this quality seems overpriced.
---
But it's a 3/2
---
Print screens where invented in 2020 can‚Äôt imagine the horror before that...
---
Am I the only one who plays rez priest without Barnes for this very reason? I'm sure it's just bad luck, but I either can't draw Barnes early, and the times I do he just ends up diluting the pool and I only rez Barnes. Or I constantly shadow essence Barnes. It's just Barnes all the way down.
---
It also doesn't help that a lot of the cards that were originally printed to help keep Mountain Giant in check have either been nerfed, like Big Game Hunter, Equality, and Hunter's Mark, or hof'd like Naturalize.

---
Wow...
---
That‚Äôs how all metas are? Aggro beats anti control/combo and control beats aggro? The only problem is aggro is super consistent atm with genn and Baku and has high win rates across the board even against control. Control decks just can‚Äôt keep up with the state of aggro in wild reliably.  
---
I don‚Äôt see why you expect anti control decks not to beat control. It‚Äôs kind of in the name.
---
And that‚Äôs why as control you tech a hakkar
---
Don't forget about that Janalai, as far as I'm conserned it does get activated by the warlock heropower, which means double Ragnaros with Kadgar + Janalai!
---
It has 2 health so it doesn‚Äôt die to be reborn. Running it in leaves you with a 3/1 with reborn and a 1/1 Patriarch
---
I hope you're prepared to never topdeck anything you need at the time you need it ever again... Your luck ran out.
---
Lol What's left to nerf there anyway
---
This is a really fun concept, but underpowered in its present state. What do you think of adding a minion with a battlecry that tutors both the giant and the spell-generating elemental?
---
Tutoring is a pretty underused and powerful mechanic, and it would be just the thing to bring a weak class like Mage - which currently sees almost no play especially in the Specialist format they're running tournaments in - into balance with other oppressive classes like Paladin (which is gonna be even more broken next expansion with their ridiculous new 1-health minions).
---
Also the case with Big Priest in Wild currently. I feel Blizzard don't understand the distinction between "anti-x archetype" and "almost unbeatable by x archetype".
---
Would you like some soup to go with your salt?
---
I am a small IQ individuak who thought it had 4 attack for some reason. *Whoops*
---
OTK/Mechathun combo deck are able to oppress control decks but this isn‚Äôt inherently a problem because they‚Äôre not successful in a wider meta (also a good thing to keep control in check). Problems occur when a successful deck oppresses too much of the meta and it really stales out. See: rouge+warrior meta from a couple months ago

Tried Murloc as well but I cant get him dead until turn 7. But do you have a deck Code? My murloc deck was a homebrewed derivat of the shaman murloc deck I used before to clobber him big time

---

---
Evenlock was a modern variant of Handlock though.

I am confused. How did he get that many curses in his name?

Do you think you are allowed to counter mountain giant on turn 4 with a pathetic zombie?

They don't have enough mana.
---
Thats debatably worse that the monkey.

Nah he's right, it won't die first time around if it attacks a 1-Attack minion. Do you reckon with all these 1 Health **Reborn** minions knocking around it might finally be year of the Silverback? Silly Ironfur Grizzly with its 3 Health!
---
Well, for full disclosure, I paid 30$ for this, ordered it in December but only just now received it in July, and there was an issue of me ordering a golden version but only receiving a normal version which was due to him claiming that the material for the gold version did not turn out well and changing to the normal version without consulting me. All that aside, I can also see that the quality is not the absolute best in every detail but in the end I am still pretty happy with it all things considered. I think it looks neat and its a lot better than anything I could make.
---
That was AWESOME!
---
I agree. The fact people are unclear if it works or not makes it a sloppy explanation in the first place.

---
I'm sorry this post confuses me? What combo is there that makes a good enough deck where the build around card sets you and your opponent to 5 mana? How is Zihi's cost the limiting factor here and not, say, the fundamental limited application of a deck built around setting your opponent to 5 mana?
---
I'm sorry but I fail to see a world where zihi is in any way a build around effect.
---
back in *my* day we had bgh for 3 mana, imagine if it was for 4! but no, we get 5 mana version :(
---
This is a Big priest counter if I ever saw one !!
---
I'll kick your ads in this game.
---
Every day of the week vs big priest. Board of small cost murlocs vs a board of 7/8/9 cost minions.
---
Reminds me of devolve, except it can also be used to deal with mage's giants flood. You probably wouldn't be using this when you have a board that often since your minions are probably better than the average murloc.
---
I don't know if it will be good or not but this is a great tech card with so many applications and outcomes. Shaman is on fire after Moorabi days. So many good and fun shaman cards were printed and are still getting printed.
---
Not bad. The Question is will this Card be played in a murloc aggressive deck. Or in a Control deck when lots of deathrattle/mech decks are around. Good against resurecct/big priest what could be a Thing in wild.
---
I thought that too but remembered voodoo doctor exists
---
What a powercreep I can't
---
Dang you're probably right, I think that'll be it
---
I'm a little surprised Blizzard didn't but silverback in the buffs just for the memes.
---
I see this a lot. But what if someone photoshops a screenshot and then takes a picture of that?
---
i agree--i feel like calling a deck overarchingly oppressive requires it to shut down enough decks that it makes a meta stale. e.g. rogue + warrior or pirate warrior ages ago or maybe even razakus
---
If control shaman is ever good, Warriors will just tech in azalina and insta-win.
---
Got me there.
---
Imagine both players having full boards in wild and you get a old murk eye or 2. That's insane
---
Still need to reduce the cost of the spell somehow.

They can be very anal about it. If the people enjoy it (which they clearly do here), let it stay.

This is good versus mechs, deathrattles and you can even play it to shut down a buffed Hyena for 3 mana.
---
This together with Lightning Storm (or any board clear, really) is almost a guaranteed board clear with res pool destruction. This card is amazing Shamans will love this
---
Vs any board with big minions this new card is just better than devolve. But with small minions devolve will be almost always better.
---
Call me dumb, but this seems insanely powerful? 
---
As a control tool, the largest murloc in standard is a 4/4 so its not totally chaotic RNG when you use it. If you've generate this off hagatha, then you can combo it with AoE you would hard run like hagatha's scheme and earthquake. It's also a transform effect, which in the past have proven to be very good (devolve/hex/poly), in particular this could destroy mages and their giants, mech pally and priest (if res priest takes off in standard). As a tempo tool, it might even make the cut (unlikely but who knows), generate a ton of lackeys and totems and turn them into murlocs to keep the murloc train going. seems nutso.
---
This card is ultra strong imho, don't know if murloc shaman wants to play this card, but a control shaman absolutely will
---
0/5
---
RNG and Murlocs are things I don't like.
---
Is there somewhere that I can go to read up on all this ordering of actions stuff?
---
Where's it say that?  And by official do you mean HS official, or streamers revealing cards?
---
You had ample warning not to do that. And why would you turn down a quest that gave you 2 packs for some really easy task?
---
I see what you are saying and do think it's a concern regarding endless resource generation, however hagatha does take minions to do that.
---
On the bright side it's nice to see blizzard offering counters to other board based strategies that didn't necessarily exist before (look at wild)
---
Hopefully there is a counter to resource based  hero strategy that doesn't involve building a board (I'm guessing warrior will still counter hagatha ) but would be nice to alternatives.
---
The Death Knights had other Death Knights to contend with. There is nothing currently in the game that comes close to Dr. Boom's power level.
---
Thx
---
Harison jones is better for you, since if you go against a slow deck the likes of control warrior he wouldnt want to draw. You dont want to drop this bad boy against aggro.
---
Oh yes, they will summon a full board of giant, and also proceed to play Alex, Tony and a Bunch of Spells.
---
The will have in the same turn a full board and threat of lethal from hand.
---
You'de be right in thinking there are no way out of clearing the board and putting yourself out of reach in the same turn. (After all, Witches Brew costs 2 and only heals 4. You need to use it for 6 mana to put yourself out of reach, but Scheme costs 5)
---
That is until you guys stop playing all the same list and start trying new cards. I've played with Omega Mind and Scheme, and when this scenario incurred to me (multiple times) I stomped the shit out of them.
---
Clear the board, got to full health. What will 2 fireballs in hand do?
---
The only way you _could_ lose from 30 health in one turn is if opponents has: 1 mana Alex, 1 mana Tony, two 1 mana apprentices, and shoot three 2 mana fireball in your face for 18 damage.
---
That is the only way you lose
---
[[Beakered Lightning]] has got your back.

0/-/- | Deal 1 damage to all minions. Overload: (2)  
---
Plague of Madness as it is is pretty much just a Project though. Those didn't affect the board directly (more the hand/hero) while the other Plagues have only affected the board.
---
40 is the fastest required, you‚Äôre good.
---
Were also in the unique situation in which such a card might be needed in the Standard meta game, though, with the potential of snowballing Giants in the early mid game. We will see about this card needing or not needing a nerf, I agree with you that it tiptoes around the edge of being too strong, but I will say that it won't need a nerf for standard reasons as of now.
---
Agree 100%. It's even clunkier on mobile.
---
Summon 5 Old Murk Eyes and 2 Warleaders, or 6 Old Murk Eyes and 1 Warleader for 60 damage.
---
The funny thing is that even if against deck that traditionally don't run damage, Jarraxus would still put you at risk. Dr. Boom has deal 3 damage hero power, magnetic is also another form of charge damage. Again, mech paladin runs magnetic mechs. Control shaman can get access to face damage through the spells randomly generated by Hagatha, or the lackeys. All above proves the fact that Jarraxus doesn't not fit into the current meta very well.
---
What do you mean from customhearthstone? The card is in hearthstone
---
lol fair enough :) was just rambling off the times where ya boi is a weakness
---
agree.  /r/hearthstone mods should remove this post, despite the robust discussion.  There's another post that says "New Shaman Card: Plague of Murlocs"
---
Best you can do is vote with your...erm...votes?  Downvote the post and hope the cream rises
---
[shh bby](http://unocardinfo.victorhomedia.com/graphics/uno_card-greenskip.png)
---
Yup the combo is being well over hyped. For example you could already do something similar with Halazi and Cult master in Hunter yet this draw combo (in a deck that lacks draw) is nowhere to be seen.
---
Ahh, thank you!
---
a priest mirror and neither is big priest, damn
---
I don't think that would meet even their standards.
---
Hero power shuffling is probably the most boring infinite value. With the lesson of Un'goro quests, I highly doubt if they will make this her power.
---
Wow it‚Äôs almost like silverback isn‚Äôt meant to be good and is meant to show players the game!
---
You got tired of freeze mage, freeze mage did not get tired of you
---
also its a murloc
---
Yeah, first post is fine, people will disagree via downvotes, but the latter replies are... yikes.
---
Interesting concept, but perhaps this would be better if it was a common instead of legendary, cost 2 less mana, had overload (2), had +1/+1, didn't have that battlecry, was a Shaman card, and was called "Flamewreathed Faceless".
---
Missed the opportunity to pixelate the art and name the post "Greetings, fellow murlocs"
---
Just a healthy amount!
---
Currently my day 1 deck.
---
I think it's just called Bee'thun
---
How long have been playing? A week?
---
Maybe play a non crappy Shaman deck?  Been playing Overload/Token Shaman and love the matchup.
---
Just type new in the search bar and it filters by only new cards. Then you can mouse over them and your done
---
Is the first one an adventure card?
---
fyi class cards are allowed to have more power over neutrals
---
Bend down Anduin and prepare your anus.
---
Yeah but if you're playing murloc shaman who cares, right?
---
Some might consider this cycle of retiring cards and introducing new expansions with slightly better versions of the base deck PAY TO WIN.
---
Yeah its in monster hunt
---
easily best post on this sub of the year
---
That's why it's an epic.
---
Just like Knife Juggler doesn't target dead minions the bees won't as well.
---
Yeah, you actually have to tap them on mobile which is super tedious.
---
&gt; This card is quite cleverly designed
---
I think is a really crappy design actually. Craps on anything that wants to win the game by anything that is not aggro or heavy control. So this card alone will polarize the game from hyper-aggro on one side or fatigue-control on the other side, so more Warrior vs hyper-aggro bs. A single card should not make the meta by itself. This is Cavenrs below levels of bad design..
---
yolo#1465 NA , trade 80g play a friend quest
---
Since I faced one just after this game I can confirm (:   
---
Also, happy cake day!
---
Oh ok thanks
---
And anything else as well!! yay?
---
Not the best solution, but if you search "new", you will have all cards marked as "new!" displayed, so that you can hover over them with less effort.
---
Don't want to sound mean, but "Battlecry" is most definitely a keyword. Keywords are common card abilities that are just compressed into a single word to save space on the card and to be easier to read.
---
Actually here you go. Thank me later   
---
[http://prntscr.com/offuau](http://prntscr.com/offuau)
---
Clearly he summoned the millhouse cause the spells in hand are zero. Against mage, that's a death wish.
---
That's different. Knife Juggler shoots a knife at a random enemy every time a monster is summoned. You have no control over it. Bees on the other hand is a spell which lets you choose a target.
---
...Why?  We know they track quite a bit of detail about the matches in the game from prior factoids.
---
I'm usually happy to get anything except Goblin Lackey. Its usage is much more niche than the others and it usually doesn't give you as much value.
---
Oh
---
The 40 minute one
---
Yeah.  I crafted it day one because I was so sure it would get nerfed anyway.....
---
Make one for Warrior
---
You're... actually trying to argue that random murlocs are stronger than random 7+ cost minions.
---
I mean more power to you I guess
---
I would say it's more like [[Devolve]].
---
Zombie flying murloc priest. Dont be afraid to add Talanji

2/-/- | Transform all enemy minions into random ones that cost (1) less.  
---
That's some sort of both lucky and unlucky :)
---
For reference, rise of shadows reveal trailer has less than 500k views.
---
At least warrior isn't broken. Could you imagine a deck that allowed you to play mech minions that gives them rush automatically...  
---
A hero power that allows you to discover another mech such as a Devastor, or Zillax....  
---
Might want to add in a card that does something like find three more mechs for the price of 1 mana. 
---
That might be a way to fix a broken Giant idea if it does happen, but probably won't so no worries.
---
...here in strangle**THORN**
---
Devolve saw a lot of play and this feels more powerful, especially when combined with Lightning Storm for a silence then board clear.
---
1) Goblin consistently gives an edge in minion trading.  For 1 mana, it's easy to hold on to and then drop with a larger minion for a surprise kill.
---
2) Kobold's 2 point anywhere for 1 mana is darn versatile.
---
3) Ethereal's free spell isn't always useful, but it's the best of the RNG alternatives.
---
4) I use Witchy for a free heal mostly, but oh boy, not getting a battlecry off can ruin that evolve.
---
5) Faceless.  The 2 mana minions don't have much impact.  If you've gotten Khadgar off of this, my hat is off to you.
---
Discover an X cost minion or Discover a minion that costs X or less.
---
Give a minion +1/+1
---
Oh god no
---
&gt; Just When I Thought I Was Out, They Pull Me Back In!
---
This was the the first thing I thought of when I saw the card.  Aggro Shaman in wild really wants this.   Devolve is used to get around walls mostly.  Big priest can be a barrier that isn't solved by Devolve.  This could fix that.  It may end up taking a tech slot mostly since it is not useful in all situations.  (Pro tip:  if it isn't going to help you at the moment, don't cast it.  smh)
---
Heal 6 on 1 mana card is a bit too much. I'd cut it in half.
---
Oh look +100 dust. Nice
---
G R U N D
---
Mage has been fine since Kobolds
---
Death triggers and removing the minions from the board are not the same thing
---
I'm 33 packs into my RoS pity timer. Send help
---
Let's not make Hakkar Hunter a thing
---
Just a better Flash Heal. Lackeys are supposed to be strong.
---
At this point should it be removed? I haven‚Äôt played since Kharazan so maybe I‚Äôm being harsh
---
....SO ABOUT THAT ANTI-MECH SHAMAN DECK....
---
They nerfed Hex for an AOE Transform Effect at 3 mana. Transform effects are insanely strong imo, polymorph, hex, devolve are all playable cards.
---
How about a simple 
---
1/1 Battlecry: Discover a Lackey
---
Is able to pick one too strong?
---
-Arcane book ‚úÖ
---
-Dressed as an academic ‚úÖ
---
-Shooting blue and purple stuff from her hand ‚úÖ
---
Yeah, she's a ~~mage~~ druid. Of course she's a ~~mage~~ druid. Who would be so stupid to think otherwise? Everybody know that's what a ~~mage~~ druid does
---
I didn't read but I would say nerf warrior , blizzard.
---
Seems kind of weak, maybe it would be better if the giants had a chance to have taunt, too? Maybe 50%? You'd have to bump the attack down by one though.
---
You know.
---
To make it balanced.
---
Probably a 3-5 mana card with some Battlecry.
---
It works the same as it does when the target mech isn't silenced. You gain the stats and the text.
---
‚ÄúDude, im gonna!‚Äù
---
No, he should not be a beast. 'Loa' is just the troll word for basically strong spirits. Just because the Loa released with RR appear to be beasts doesnt mean all of them are. 
---
Fun fact: Hearthstone had 'Loa' in it for a long time: Aviana, Malorne aaaand Wisps.
---
Holy fuck 199999999999999 stars. STROMGEST CARD IN THE GAME
---
Yeah didnt consider this actualy, still need a 1 cost reduction on the spell or gamble with a coin vargoth but can work
---
&gt; And on top of that, mech decks with tons of deathrattles have a way of surviving hagathas scheme and kill the shaman before they will have any time to play their earthquakes.
---
That‚Äôs what Hex and Earth Shock are for. It‚Äôs still too early to be calling any deck oppressive, but the deck certainly has a lot of potential to be powerful
---
"That card is broken, so we should we make other card cost less so it's just as broken!".
---
Yeah, I don't follow that logic.
---
Crypt lord is played a ton in wild token druid. Really good card still.
---
Obvious. DOUBLE TIME AND DOUBLE PAY
---
Banishing to the void (from that heist boss)  is the strongest. No res pool.
---
same here still play hs daily for quest casually but dont really watch hs streams anymore.
---
that is true and now that i think about it, this new card is also a good way of eliminating big deathrattle threaths
---
Better nerf warrior
---
I'd like us to get better-statted minions that can survive longer, and can be kept alive via our hero power. But Blizzard has always been concerned about letting the Priest class have any resilient minions since if one minion survives, Priest can end the game with the DS/IF Combo.
---
I don't want to put Divine Spirit in my deck. Ever. Nor do a lot of other priests. But simply because Divine Spirit exists as an available card, the quality of the minions I can choose from is less than it should be. That's why I want Divine Spirit gone.
---
&gt; 4 Old Murk-Eye
---
I like them both, but I sure did enjoy the interesting rhyming scheme in Rastakhan's lyrics.
---
What's your favourite, then?
---
Mine was certainly Naxxramas one
---
Works the same way as adding buffs to a previously silenced minion. Silence only removes previous buffs, it doesn't prevent any new ones from being added later.
---
Hiya!
---
Finally? I went back through every VS report from current one to 130 to 120 to 110 and so on. Mage was in the top 6 played classes in all but 1 of the reports, tops in 1, and often in the top 2-4 going back to mid-2017.
---
Dont need to waste both. Most murlocs have 3 or less health so Lightning Storm and other small AoE will clear the board.
---
What I think he's saying is that Blizz intentionally tunes Classic to be (in general, with notable exceptions) less powerful than expansion cards so that you're encouraged to use (and buy) the new cards when they come out.
---
So I think we all agree that your suggestion isn't ridiculous. It would be well in line with the power level of other hero cards, but Blizz probably doesn't want to buff Classic cards in general. They'd rather have it non-viable than powerful enough to use regularly.
---
Completely different. Murlocs cap out at about 5 mana, by devolving you give big priest 7/8/9 mana minions which are often stronger than a random murloc by far.
---
This seems like a really strong control tool? The one thing worth considering is that this could backfire pretty terribly, but I‚Äôd put this on par with something like Volcano.
---
(Where are the heroes?)
---
NA 80g quest trade Lightp#1333 you go first
---
But both cards are still good in that deck individually.  You don‚Äôt need to have them both for them to be effective in the deck.
---
&gt; Maybe starting at 10:00AM?
---
Notice that the times are on Central european time. Meaning 10AM in CET would be 1AM-4AM in USA. A weird time for them to be livestreaming.
---
I recall KnC's trailer was an ad too, also RB, can't recall about others though.
---
i think projects and plagues are just a theme for spells with symmetrical effects but plagues are for classes that did not get projects.
---
Interesting - witchy is definitively my LEAST favorite. But I don't play mutate shaman and the mutate effect has always been too RNG dependent for my taste. I can see how it would be powerful in that deck though.
---
Touche
---
both: "...fuck, now we have to put up with dragons!"
---
boom: "...no problemos my **sm0ll** bombs will kill dem"
---
There aren't many murloc synergies you can capitalize on when transforming them on the board. Most are battlecry synergies.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm gonna guess that‚Äôs a spell.
---
KnC also was an ad and is sitting at 1.6M, 1/3rd of this, same with RB, so we can safely assume that even if it weren't an ad it would be around 1.5M tbh (if the proportion stayed true).
---
Yeah, I think in a vacuum, Ethereal is clearly the strongest. Situationally, the others can be better pulls but overall Ethereal is crazy value
---
Not gonna lie, I listen to the trailer on my way to work almost every day, the song is just so damn good and catchy.
---
Correct!
---
That's a card.
---
Hopefully a controle card
---
He got them through Rafaam RNG
---
Yeahhhhhh having a 50% chance to discover yourself doesn‚Äôt seem like a good choice when spirit of the shark and new shaman quest around
---
*laughs in Rogue hero power*
---
They also have insane synergy though. Your opponent only needs a few minions to deal 10+ dmg with random Murlocs.
---
Yeah and to be fair, you usually lose as Druid anyway if you lose the board.
---
Personally,  I'd say that about Witchy but not so much Goblin. It is situational but situations where it's helpful seem fairly plentiful to me. I'd still place it no higher than 4th but I generally find I get my use out of it.
---
The reason Hagatha's value isn't complained about is because shaman spells are mostly conditional, niche, or backfire with overload.
---
Username checks out
---
I think they soon should do an expansion that isn't so cartoonish, it's been like that every time now for some time, maybe since wrath and old gods. 
---
I would like at least once in a while a series that is more dark or dirty somehow.
---
Its the grindiest tech card. At least other hate cards swing the game faster
---
Evil descends from the skies
---
With paladin, it could also add a 2/1 to your hand or something silly. It‚Äôs hard to tell.
---
Oh no not again
---
Just rope and end your turn that way. Ez
---
I love it when it is 1 mana 5/6 ;)
---
