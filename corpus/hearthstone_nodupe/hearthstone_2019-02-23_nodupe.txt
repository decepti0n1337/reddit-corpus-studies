Check out the link and it looks cool, forgive me but I could not see where to download the cards and such. I'm pretty useless when it comes to working these things out so if you could send me the link for the cards I will definetly try them out!!!

I dunno what everyone else is talking about, multiclass decks were the best part of the Halloween arena. Putting something like that in standard sounds beyond fun. Beyond broken too but beyond fun nonetheless. If you add a fun restriction to it it could be feasible enough to be added. Something like, "You can't have duplicates of any 2nd class cards" or "You can't have any 1st and 2nd class cards that are the same cost" or even "Your first class's cards must be even/odd and the 2nd class's cards must be the opposite".
---
Also, I just realized this but I don't think any of these cards on my list are rotating.
---
Deck codes made it kinda irrelevant for me.
---

---
I will admit I am completely blindfolded when it comes to tech/coding and the budget it takes.  
---

---
I was under the impression that they would have to introduce a client for the torunament format anyways, which would only involve 0.01% of the playerbase, under which logic it would be very much feasible to add said "Specialist-client" to the live server.  
---
If I am wrong though, i understand how this might be seen as a naive proposal.

Expecting Blizzard to utilize a modicum of common sense when it comes to this game. If that were the case Hearthstone would already have a tournament mode, permanent Brawliseum, more formats, etc, etc. Its five years too late to start thinking they're going to make Hearthstone anymore than a closed-alpha mobile game.
---
You wouldn't/shouldn't. The game is poorly written, simple as that.
---
Yknow I was writing a response trying to rationalise how they must decide where to put their effort, and how spending time on doing these things doesn’t directly effect profit compared to just doing the bare minimum in making a new expansion every so often with a bit more pve content to just about hold onto people; but it just doesn’t make any sense. These changes, amongst a few others like certain bug fixes, would be such low effort to implement its almost unbelievable that in both the long and short run these sorts of things wouldn’t boost the profit from the game greatly.
---
Maybe they’re just happy to let the game fade and move onto other projects, I don’t know much about how companies like blizzard function but this is the only thing I can think of that makes sense.

so increase malygos to 11 mana?

I wouldn’t run anything off a HDD any more. You can run modern things off a HDD and complain about bad performance any longer. It makes the biggest difference in legitimately any application.

---
Impossible! Think of the technology needed for such a feat!
---
This is really from a competitor's prospective. For a viewer, most of the pros in this article are like cons for a viewer. When tuning in a tournament, viewers wants to see what they don't see everyday on ladder. They want to see variety in classes, variety in how the game plays out, they want to see wacky decks, which is mostly only  possible in a targeting strategy.  And it is especially bad if there is any amount of polarization in the matchup. I will go to other channels immediately if I see an odd warrior against a rogue, an odd rogue against a priest or warlock. The match, if not the games, is just gonna be boring.
---
If you separate players by their ladder placings, then it encourages people to tank their ladder rank so that they get the easiest bracket in tournament mode.
---
I, for instance, have never made Legend rank.  And if a tournament mode is separated based on that criterion, then I will do my best never to hit legend, so that I can maximize in-game rewards.
---
There is a current rush glitch where the rush minion simply cant attack for the rest of the game If you click it right after summoning It. Have already lost one or two arena games because of that
---
That’s fine. So long as the rewards scale in some sense by rank it will work out. But there will always be people who abuse any system. 
---
It's only interactive if it forces meaningful decisions. As board clears and refills are so plentiful, neither player really makes any choices. The paladin just plays into the board clears as they know they can just fill again anyway. Priest just clears because they know they have so many it doesnt matter. 
---
But immediately as soon as they revealed Shudderwock, players figured out a way to go infinite.  There's no excuse for the state of Shudderwock on WW release.
---
???? the entire conversation you talk like honor guard is a permanent effect that has no counterplay but it is not. No shit 2 mana shutting down your battlecries permanently is strong. I'm done with this.

adding drag and drop to something that doesn't normally have it isn't trivial, however it is important enough for them to prioritise it.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
however my suspicion (optimistic) is that instead of just spending effort to add drag/drop to what we have, they are working on an entire UI overhaul which probably started awhile go but is taking ages to complete.
---
We appreciate the kind words. Hopefully you've gotten some inspiration for some cool brews after seeing all of these different lists!

My favorite cards to get at 1 mana are tyrantus, king krush. Then when they kill king krush you play tess for lethal
---
Idk, these are all nice ideas, but I would focus my attention on well printed exp, new modes (mixed exp e.g.) and faster rotations. You refresh the game more frequently and keep the players interested in trying out new decks.
---
Also, buff cards that did not see play and that we payed for. It's not like that to implement new strategies the only solution is nerfing or introducing new cards: you have potential solutions right under your nose!

Then stats, new portraits, exc. is fine. But that is flavour. How many people don't have all 9 golden heroes or all lv60 and are complaining all the same?

---
Shadow Visions is just really really good for priest though. They have a lot of situational/combo cards and being able to fish for them is amazingly good, as it being able to get three or four copies of divine spirit. Without it you'd have far fewer cards that act as "Health to Attack" and the ones you did have would be less flexible.

I played in the high school esports league last winter and summer season. I made it to the finals but had a record of 3:2 so I didn’t go to the top obviously. After that I didn’t play many ranked matches hell my rank on hearthstone is in Tier 13. But now that all of my other clubs have ended I want to play one last season before I graduate. I ask reddit because I don’t want to build decks that are for sure going to die next rotation. I have done a bit of research before which is why I have my odd agro mage deck. 
---
For a F2P player during the Chinese New Year event getting dust for quest was amazing, I was able to craft Genn and most of Odd mage with it. Please add back if possible

Agree, especially because most people heavily play select few classes.

After trying Magic Arena for about a week I want to say yes. They give you 15 free decks and whenever you do their equivalent of arena you get to keep your draft (arena) deck afterwards and you end up winning 1-2 packs on top of that and gems to use towards another draft run. The big differences are that 10 of the decks are dual color (think mixing two classes) and magic decks can have 4 copies of a card. But yeah I think hearthstone could absolutely give away a free deck every expansion and be absolutely fine
---
You could whip up cool WoW lore achievements. Saw this idea in Gwent, they had something like "have card X and Y be on the board at the same time". Something like "play Varyann card as Anduin".
---
Pretty sure whales care the most about having 999 deckslots considering they have all the cards. And those people are the majority of the game's income.
---
Add cool achievements such as "kill Malfurion with Illidan" or something like that.
---
I just wish there was efficient Resurrect counter. You could run Tinkmaster for example but it's too damn random and unreliable, hurts other matchups and doesn't do jack shit against Cloning Gallery full board. At this point I just alt+f4 whenever I see priest...
---
Oh my God

What have you done
---
I see people say this all the time but that's not how budgeting works. Use some of the esports employee wages on other stuff instead.
---
Event organizer perspective, We really need trusted match result tracking API.
---
* each player id.
---
* start date
---
* end date
---
* hero class and deck list
---
These data export to some trusted database that's really helpful. Automate many thing so easily. Currently Hearthstone tournament management is bad. All results are self-reported (or manual checking with spectator mode) It's unbelievably low-tech in 2019.
---
I have thought about implementation Tournament lobby on DeckTracker long time ago but I found that impossible to avoid cheating like forge fake match results. There is no way to manage tournament integrity.
---
I don't want much. Just only trusted match result API added to widen various utilization possibilities.

This QoL change wouldn’t negatively affect you or your playstyle in any way. You’d still be able to concede against decks that you consider boring. There would be no extra disadvantages or penalties incurred for doing so.

---
Could you really see the deathrattle?
---
This issue is here since jade idol. The removal of fatigue as a valid win condition as been very problematic for the game and reward people wasting ressources. We have a deck consisting of wasting all your deck as fast as possible to win and another one who consist of wasting your deck so you can give it to your opponent.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
We already knew the main issue with discard mechanic was the fact that a player want to play his card, not discard them. I don't see how having deck where you throw everything in the air is more fun than that.
---
In the past Freeze mage was considered as toxic because it was a 40 damages OTK ...
---
yeah, so i killed it to see if it was really deal 3 damage to all minions instead of +2/+2 (which is stupid bcs the whole board is just the opponent's minions), and it was 3 dmg.
---
Doesn't this fall under quality assurance or whoever is responsible for updating the reck recipe? This is a very simple thing as removing card and replacing it to/updating the recipe , i don't think they really need to modify a lot of things. It's a small thing but i wonder what's the excuse for it to go this long. Were quality assurance/the person responsible for updating deck recipe got affected by the layoff?

pirate warrior was stupid as fuck yes, but it was the dumb climb for free deck for that period just like Jade druid and odd pally

Its his turn 9 though. You shoudlnt have left the radian elemental on board, that way he wouldnt have enough mana to mindblast you 2 times. This was mainly your mistake.

The hunter prominence is very annoying for sure and I certainly agree hunter being insanely prominent is stifling to the game but you can still play a workaround.
---
hunter wont drop a stupid otk combo on you that you can't tech out of because of how easy it is to revive your otk win condition 
---
but yes I agree hunter overpopulation needs to stop
---
Hearthstone is designed to have blowout matchups and every deck is meant to have ~50% winrate.
---
Just make it so you still win
---
Freeze mage was not an OTK deck. Midrange also isn't "a mix of aggro and control", it's a value based type of deck that out-tempos control, as it has been classically in all TCGs.
---
Hearthstone Deck Tracker lets you have replays.

I always thought it meant new cards you got,woops.

how are Genn/Baku 'infinite value'? more value? yes

a lot of value? certainly

but not even close to classic infinite value compared to DKs (which also aren't infinite value like jade idol etc.)

It took me a while to see the Mind Blasts in the last list
---
I just checked. Last 50 games during climb to legend.
---
OTK: 18% (Wall Priest counted as OTK)
---
Control - Combo: 14% (Decks with finisher, which fight for board - Malygos Druid, Control Priest, Cube Warlock)
---
Control: 28% (Deathrattle Hunter counted as Control)
---
Midrange: 22%
---
Aggro: 18%
---
I know, YMMV, but until you play on deck floor, it shouldn't be much different. 
---
So, your point about infinite value stands, but it doesn't actually create OTK meta. And midrange stands in good place. Actually, it's aggro, which is in worst position right now - with only Odd Paladin, Zoo, and Aggro-Odd Mage, which is arguably midrange.
---
Well built midrange decks actually should be even or favorable against many OTK. Genn is not problem for midrange - it's the card that single-handedly allows to play 4 different midrange decks: Paladin, Shaman, Rogue, Warlock.
---

---
It definitely does though.
---
I agree with you.  Its run its course.  The game has kept exploring new and different things, but the design space is so small that it all starts to feel pretty samey.
---
Activision bought Blizzard. That's the only problem there ever was. Blizzard was loyal to its customers, and cared about the game more than the money. Can't say the same for activision

---
Hey Alex/ u/Popsychblog
---
Thanks for the reasonable and constructive post.
---
**Here are some of my thoughts why this mode is not just "a worse sideboard"**
---
Minor changes to this system have a significant impact. 
---
**Example1:**
---
 in an open decklist format, revealing 1 card that is in 2 of the 3 but not in the third deck gives your opponent some info what is about to come. Revealing a card that shows the enemy unequivocally which deck you are playing is a significant consideration and will impact gameplay decisions. 
---
With a sideboard showing cards that you did swap doesn't give you much information about the other cards you swapped. 
---
**Example 2:**
---
This specific ruleset will impact the tournament meta significantly as decks that have flexible gamplans with exactly 5 cards will drastically profit from this change. It opens up really unique deck building challenges compared to interesting on the fly counter pick challenges. But i kind of like the
---
 *"prepare your decks with a strong meta read and be rewarded."* 
---
Compared to a 
---
*"just drop in a few tech cards to hardcounter specific decks you are facing."*
---
Which could be a problem with how tech cards are balanced in hearthstone. And would likely lead to the same 3to4 cards being in most sideboards
---
I really like this  Aspect of this system that **it's about a gameplan not just tech choices.**
---
I personally would have **loved to see 7 swappable cards** for 3 duplicates and 1 extra flex card. But it strongly depends on the meta and core card packages of a class if that is better or worse. 
---
**unfortunately**
---
This comment section is just full of "blizzard is evil/stupid" memes. 
---
It is pretty hard to have a reasonable conversation when everyone is downvoted who says anything else. 
---
(Also everyone focused on the "tournament mode will never come look at deckslots" meme  instead the content of all the other good points you made.)
---
Have a good day. 
---

It’s gotta be a priority for HOF at this point.

It's a fine choice to include if you have it or just want to.
---
I feel your sentiment odd pally is the poor persons  dumb deck but it WILL rotate out. priests have been this problematic since day one
---
I forgot it existed tbh. Was super bored with the meta and came across it in the crafting section. It can be decent with poisonous and deathrattle minions.
---
fuul*
---
The chances Baku the Mooneater and Genn Graymane are rotated from standard early are next to if not outright zero. Whenver people bring up that is "might," they're talking about how much they want it to rather than how likely it actually could.
---
Crafting the card specifically to get that sixteen hundred dust back in April will prove to be foolhardy.
---
Yeah just wait it out. I have 3200 dust and am saving it for any legendary cards that are announced. 
---
I disagree, the reason for those super greedy control/otk decks is blizzard removing/nerfing cards used in aggro decks. 
---
I know yall hate aggro but without it control decks take place and it gives raise to otk as a result.
---
yes. yes it is
---
You are not alone, my friend.
---
The recipe itself is coded to either standard or wild. 
---
I disagree the design space is that small. It's no MTG, but there's all kinds of space they could explore in an entirely digital game like this. I think the problem in that regard is the set design. The Year of Mammoth's set design was terrible and other sets have mostly been mediocre. I think the game is capable of much better set design that can help the team explore more interesting design space.
---
Today i got this giant hand as my cursos in the pc client. Any ideas how to fix it? I tried restarting to no avail. 
---
Post your deck list, please.
---
The difference for me is if a deck needs to win a board or only needs to stall it. Malygos is weird deck. It uses minions to stall. If it loses a board, it can't come back. That's typical for control, so I prefer to name it Control with combo finisher.
---
And meta is not slower, it's faster and more minion heavy after nerfs. That's the reason why there are less OTKs. 
---
Another reason thats less likely to be mentioned: MTG Arena. The numbers are steadily growing and WotC is pumping huge amount of money into the project.

---
Touche’. That one was probably my favorite.
---
Yeah I kinda see what you're getting at there. But the decks in this brawl are constructed to be - I guess - intuitive. I don't mind this sort of variation from the RNG-fests that a lot of the tavern brawls are. And if all else fails: jump in, get pack, jump out
---
i understand and agree, but still, i wont even compare priest decks to just uninteractive priests and rather play against them, espeically against wall priest, as i usually play control decks, they are either free win or atleast something interesting
---
Togwaggle *could* be balanced, if Naturalize weren’t a 1 mana spell that was designed around a time when your opponent drawing two cards was a bad thing.  
---
I have a plays.tv recording of this rogue bitch saying Well Played when they don't have lethal and I got fired up to not let that happen. Cubelock vs Kingsbane back in Kobolds &amp; Catacombs. They were at 11 attack and perma-lifesteal but eventually we kept cubing voidlords long enough for the every so often fatigue to kill that asshat. 
---
Which doubly doesn't matter because its brawl.
---
It doesn't matter who has more health, it just keeps going until both people die.
---
Bruh who ares about the semantics? It gives you a shitton of value for no cards and only a little mana.

About unlimited deck slots: it's not as simple as you'd think it is. You would need to add a sorting feature and a searching feature, and have it run well, and have it fit the hearthstone theme, and make it intuitive. Hard to do, and will certainly take a while.
---
Also, just think of trying to find a specific deck you made a long time ago and you can't remember what it was called. You'd have to go through every other deck you've made for that class. That would really suck.
---
I could see them adding another page or two, but unlimited deck slots are not going to happen for a while (if at all).
---
It was rather high ranks so basically I opted to go control warrior  without Baku 
---
Rofl nice deck name 
---
any tips on how to pilot the deck? play stuff on curve, trade, go face? 
---
Morality of whoever is in charge aside, this has been going on consistently for 5 years now; anything beneficial to the player is squashed within a day. I remember one instance where the bug (can't recall which but it was during Brode times) was discovered on a Friday and sure enough, Monday it was hotfixed out immediately.
---
But again, it's been 5 years. The blatant anti-consumer decisions reached [my] limit a while ago, while the game is still starved for content and features and other annoying things are still not fixed/improved i.e. the "new" card bug that pops up every expansion (like seriously, if the dev who "fixed" that is reading this, you should be embarrassed).
---
yeah but you can see at the video that it was battlecry to get damaged by 5 and gain armor by 5, the armor came after entire thing went through, leaving op at 0 hp with 5 armor.
---
Sure, but when you can drain your deck and swap it with your opponent, or put corrupted blood in their deck, or you just need Mechathun to die, it’s a one mana win condition
---
PingWarrior#1552
---
Really, how long does it take to replace a single card? Just throw Amani Berserker or Loot Hoarder in instead.
---
Wait a minute...
---
The only card I don’t have is ysharaaj, maybe I won’t craft it though since expansion will be close
---
We've called them out on basic stuff for years. They just don't give a damn.
---
Too little because next expansion is coming.
---
I would love for someone to do a deep-dive into the history of r/Hearthstone and compile a list of every time they did this song and dance. Permanently stickie it to the top of the subreddit and warn any new players to stay away. Hurt them in the only way the public can to wake them tf up.
---
I do because it's a common card and it's drafted highly.
---
Hearthstone is gonna get HGCed in 2020. The 2019 season is going to have all of what, 1 tournament for me to watch in my time zone?
---
Don't like your answer choices. I think most of the critique, let's call it that instead of negativity, is justified and fair. Doesn't mean that I like it
---
Fuck I lost the game.
---
Still better than only razakus priest, jade druid, tempo rogue. Or cubelock and tempo paladin.
---
The meta is much more colorful right now. I miss boomsday where every class was strong and the only downside was the occasional extremely unfavourable matchup.
---
Cringe
---
UltimaRaiden#1841 NA 80g Quest trade. Yours first, can show mine.
---
Talanji order is just random, unfortunately.
---
Wow, I appreciate the time you put in to share your opinion. I would say that what warships does better is starting with a game that is playable for free and allowing for microtransactions to be implemented later rather than sooner.  I also see a better relationship between the fan base and the devs. They reward players who play consistently with sales and free content. After all of these issues how much do you play HS in comparison to Warships? And do you still spend money on both?
---
I fully intend on implementing your response into the qualitative part of my study. I also have a quantitative section over your general opinion of the business model here = https://goo.gl/forms/31ZVPW4q6PCJOKk42 . I by no means expect you to write any more than you already have but would appreciate if you spent a few minutes for some basic questions. Thank you for your response. 
---
I had a positive opinion of hearthstone for the longest time certainlonger than the people in my friends lost. but there are two reasons i quit the game:
---
 I got sick of the devs only caring about new players (and ex players now...) while doing nothing new for the game. tournament mode being canceled really stung but I shelled out one last time for the preorder because multiple devs said it was their favorite expansion ever.  
---
q reason two: the game felt the same for  too long. i thought I'd make it thru this year and enjoy a fresh meta after rotation but then the expansion did nothing good for the game. no new archetypes, shitty single player content, nerfs hitting the wrong cards... and Baku and genn are here to stay. 
---
I guess have accepted that hearthstone is just being maintained. they are not gonna come up with something exciting or new. it is minimal investment while collectimg money as long as possible. I lost trust in the devs, in blizzard as a whole.
---
 and I am not sure I would come back, even if they would come up with proper sideboarding or Something. there are other games that are fun to play...
---
Is there another deck around 6k or under that would be good to craft just to climb? Thanks :)
---
My reason for stopping is that literally all the decks are way too expensive to play, i have most cards of most decks but im always missing like 1-2 legendaries and 2-3 epics which i cant justify buying packs for because of how unlikely it is to get the cards i need
---
So i just stopped playing
---
Legendaries are recognized by their orange gem and special border. You can filter your card collection by set. And you should know which set you have a legendary from because you are buying the damn things with your gold.
---
Exactly. That's why justicar felt way more fair. 
---
dont craft anything now. just wait for the rotation and a new expansion. there might be a new deck that u really like and if u craft anything now (even cards that dont rotate) u will be kinda tied to paladin class and u might change your mind completely after the rotation when the meta settles.
---
I think you're letting your emotions get the best of you. 
---
I play Golden Whizbang too. I am a casual player nowadays. I enjoy know all the Whizbang decks from play over time, but I enjoy the "Hell, just pick a deck for me and I'll try to manage.".  
---
I exclusively play golden Whizbang in standard.  
---
In wild though I play custom decks. I play a Reno Recruit Deathrattle Hunter and a Quest Warlock mostly.   
---
Quest warlock is very fun since no game is the same. Though there is a clear difference in win rate when I get a Cataclysm by turn 4. It's like the Barnes of resurrekt priest. If I drop it on curve it's usually a win. Even more so if I get coin + malchezaar's imp in play on the same turn. Each game is different, and it is wild enough to have a decent chance of winning even with simply disgusting decks (Resurrekt Priest, Call to Arms Dude Paly, Burn mage come to mind). I somehow never managed to get any use out of Lana'thel though. I should cut her but I never feel like doing it. I know she's waiting for her big moment. High Priestess Thekkal is the MVP here.   
---
I can’t unsee this now. Thanks, I hate it.
---
And what did it cost you?
---
My matchup as Odd warrior vs some mid-range zuljin secret hunter. 
---
Now when he played zuljin he got tangelfur mystic. I took control of that using MCT. Then when I attached with it into freezing it bounced to my hand.
---
Now he transformed into DK Rexxar and started his OP beasts train. One time I had him at 6 hp facing exact lethal on board. He lifestealed to 18 hp. Fatigue was nearing and Boom was loosing to Rexxar. It was close but I had him because he was deeper in fatigue. Like 4 tracking deep. I was losing board. I played tanglefur mystic which gave the opponent immortal prelate. 
---
That was like so intense to beat but I somehow won by not letting him kill prelate few times but killing his zombeasts.
---
Apart from this Historically I had intense cubelock mirrors or vs razakus priest.
---
that may be, and I may be speaking in extremes, but the core of my argument hasnt changed priests doesnt allow you to play your cards without getting cheated out of it. be it mid range, aggro or even control 
---
What did it cost?
---
lolololololol. The fact that you are actually serious is laugh out loud funny. You've had enough internet for the day, kid.
---
How can you play old school control warrior in that meta? How could you possibly generate the value needed to counter the stronger control decks?
---
You should start saving the day an expansion drops. Do not buy any packs at all until expansion launch day, then use all the gold you've saved up since the last one. If you do the preorder too you'll usually have somewhere between 130-150 packs to open on day one.
---
One option that Kibler doesn't mention is cards that disrupt your opponent's hero power somehow. For instance, an effect like Finley's, but it is your opponent that gets the new basic hero power. Or something that permanently increases the cost of hero powers.
---
Nerfing these is so fucking simple im almost positive this is what they will be
---
Genn to: your hero power costs 1 every even turn
---
Baku: your hero power is upgraded every odd turn 
---
Adjust their stats and mana costs accordingly
---
 Hire me Blizzard. 
---
Ive never even gotten 12 games and im OG hahaha
---
 monmon#1955 NA 80g Quest. You go first.
---
I decided to not include too edge case scenarios. It is also true that warlock doesn't get more cards after they have drawn their deck or that the dagger is useless if you have another weapon or is frozen.
---
"Cancer ape" is a new one
---
Hokeypokey#1224 NA friend quest trade
---
The clear solution for the longevity of the game and all its modes is to delete them and return the dust. The obvious problem is that the ownership rate of these cards is likely VERY high and Activision does not want to return all that dust. 
---
To compare different games: take a look at what Epic just did with Fortnite. (I know, just bear with me.)  EA releases Apex legends to go head to head with Fortnite. It has a strong start - Epic responds by setting up a number of quests that, when completed, give the player next's seasons Battle Pass for free. Why? It keeps Fortnight players playing both games for now and increases loyalty RIGHT at the time when Apex's Battle Pass is going to launch. Absolutely brilliant, player friendly, marketing move. How does this relate to HS? Activision simply needs to take the near term hit, dust the cards, and move on. The players will be happy, the game will feel a lot more fresh, and it will extend the life of the game. 
---
As an aside, this is also why I was so sad Artifact was such a greedy bust. HS needs competition. 
---
If Blizz is considering HOFing them - that means they might be ready to take the hit. Please, do everyone, and Wild a favor - just delete the cards. It should have been done long ago. 
---
The 6 mana dragon is a decent win con against most decks too 
---
Pshhh 20 wins in a row at legend. I could do that...
---
...*i just don’t want to*...
---
I'm looking for quest trade on NA as well. Invulnerable#1285
---
[removed]
---
Hey man they also hotfixed Jaina’s boobs very fast, give them credit where credit is due /s
---
The 6 mana mech is usually a win con too against most decks; especially since he’s drawn the cubes to go with it 
---
As a Midrange player thank you.
---
Blizzard doesn’t care about western markets anymore. China is where the money is at (see diablo immortal)
---
thanks i nutted
---
It’s a struggle for sure but I find I’m playing against a lot more aggro decks so that’s how I rank. 
---
The other control decks i go against, I’m relying on dirty rat, tinkmaster and burst from Grom/Alex.  
---
It’s taken me to rank 5 multiple seasons. The only time I hit legend I played control a lot but made the final push with Aggro decks.  But even with the current meta, 5 is my goal and very much attainable with old school CW:)
---
IDK man, 2 copys of one card doesn't change the archtype. Using that logic every hunter deck is control because DK Rexxar exists.
---
*Woah!* It's your **5th Cakeday** StormpikeCommando! ^(hug)
---
It must make you feel really bad that I'm not doing what you're telling me to.
---
Like I told you in the first place: You're wrong, and no one cares what you think. That's obvious to everyone but you apparently.
---
It’s cool that you got mecha’thun, but isn’t he dead to fatigue anyway? Maybe not right away but he’s 5 health and you are full.
---
/u/zoortaax did
---
Devil's advocate (I personally agree they should be removed) - what about all the people that enjoy these cards?  
---
They are not universally hated after all and a forced removal could hurt the game more as it's seen as pandering to whales by making cheaper decks that utilize the likes of Baku invalid.  
---
Odd warrior. It is nor op nor boring. It can handle the meta well
---
Buff Mind Breaker to a 4/5 - 
---
I could be okay with Even Quest Warrior or Even Quest Shaman
---
not to mention beatiality
---
Interesting! I agree that the Taunt keyword was a bit too much, especially looking at Taunt Warrior as well as other aggro opponents that got countered on turn 3.
---
I could see higher mana cost and no other keyword and a slightly better statline be a thing in the future though!
---
Tess Psychic Screams herself into your deck.  Since she's now your minion technically, her battlecry continues for you.
---
Thats more complication thats unnecessary. Why add more variables when you can keep all the clients the same except for languages
---
Have you tried pocket galaxy&gt; jan'alai&gt; cube&gt; faceless&gt; faceless&gt; deathwing&gt; end turn?
---
Looks good, I just need a replacment for all the the paladin cards.
---
"fatigue is the most frustrating way to lose a game"
---
I don't possibly know how on earth you can think this, how the fuck is losing to some random shit RNG effect that happens to wipe your board when you would have won the next turn less frustrating than being outplayed by someone and running out of cards?
---
Suggestion: stop making suggestions to fix cards that aren’t broken. 
---
I’m glad others view it this way too. It’s like a business contract. They make a game, I like it and buy it or don’t. If they have people buying it they don’t want to change it. It’s kind of like being pissed that your fridge doesn’t have a feature your friends does. (Meaning we don’t have features other games do). You don’t send messages to the fridge company or tell everyone to walk away on the forums you just buy a fridge that has it next time. If you don’t like hearthstone, don’t play it. That doesn’t mean the developers shouldn’t add new and good stuff, but if they don’t does complaining do anything? Besides make you mad and make me roll my eyes that is. 
---
hoot hoot
---
Sorry, but what did they changed in her? 
---
r/losteditors?
---
Awesome work man! Any advice for certain matchups? I'm thinking about making secret paladin myself, is it worth the dust?
---
My suggestion is to not have the effects happen on [turn 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/au0ikx/just_push_genns_and_bakus_effects_back_a_few_turns/). Move Baku's effect to turn 5 and Genn's to turn 4.  Make them miss the first two opportunities to use the upgrade or discount.
---
Once i was playing tesspionage rogue and I drew topsy turvy every single Turn 4 turns in a row...
---
Guess most people think it’s an invalid opinion and rightfully downvote it. It’s how reddit should work.
---
I think Even Paladin and Even Shaman could survive it as well. It just weakens then to fairer strengths. It also would allow Team 2 to print strong 2 drops again. Odd Mage of both styles would be fine as well.
---
This change really only kills Evenlock, Odd Pally, Odd Rogue, and Odd Hunter.
---
Yawn
---
“Hall of famed” the cleavage. Noice noice.....

Oh dude I’m sorry for being so defensive. I got some dude in this thread arguing with me about how SSD doesn’t really matter for games, so I’ve been kinda a dick here, cuz that’s absolutely ridiculous. 
---
If you’re using a SSD, fairly decent processor, and at least 8GB RAM... it should not be doing that. I would be frustrated about that if I were you, especially if you’ve tried reinstalling and the nuclear option, reformatting. Hearthstone is not as simple of a game as people seem to think it is to run, but there’s no reason it should be doing that if your machine is halfway decent. That kinda stuff is so hard to diagnose and fix. 
---
There was one way to clear our some weird log file that gets created—have you tried that? Apparently that can help immensely. I can try to dig it up if you haven’t heard of that! 
---
The technology just isn’t there yet
---
I'm glad he remembered that people initially praised these as "Reno done right." 
---
The problem isn't that they're consistent (That's probably a very GOOD thing). People really have an issue with the particular benefit they give.
---
I really wish Blizz would put a greater emphasis on in-game decisions than deckbuilding ones.
---
Yeah don't listen to that guy.  There's a reason you were required to encrypt your drive, and props to that school for implementing it.  However, it killing your windows was obviously not suppose to happen, and they should be more than able to fix the issue (even though they clearly cannot).  
---
My advice is to make an appointment with the Dean of your program and tell them what your IT issues are.  It's another PITA step you have to unfortunately take but it will light a fire under IT's ass to get it fixed.  
---
It kills any deck that actually wants an early game. Which is most of them. "I can play behind curve for 5 turns" is *really* bad, especially since the mana discount is really important early on.
---
Good luck trying to build a board when your best play is two two drops in the first three turns.
---
Sorry, can someone explain?
---
wat
---
I can downvote you and not be mad. Most of us don’t get so infuriated on reddit that they can’t multi-task...
---
Yea, we just disagree. These two cards create such a boring, limited, repetitive dynamic in the game that it is not comparable to other deck types. 
---
I can understand your dislike for OTK decks, but this is much much worse. (I was fine when OTK was pretty much just Exodia mage, but it is getting out of hand right now, agree.) 
---
Yeah, all of those three are extremely similar. Norwegians are able to have conversations with Danish and Swedish people almost without any complications. Sometimes there is like one weird word we can’t understand, but the languages are basically just slightly different versions of each other.
---
Even decks literally will not have anything to do turn 1.
---
on it.
---
Hey Kibler you got some [[wild growth]] on your face!
---
Right, but you also have been whining like a bitch this entire time, so when you say you aren't mad, there's no one who is going to trust that. Certainly not even you.
---
Facts must make you mad, crybaby.

Aggro is the only archetype I find interesting. Every decision matters a lot starting from turn 1. I have no idea how people can play control games that aren't decided until turn 25.
---
Hooray, more horribly-balanced cards!
---
They should really limit the amount of legendaries allowed per deck. The dust cost of most decks are fucking absured.  Force people to be more creative with cards that aren't legendary.
---
wall priest doesnt impact the design of evry future card adn evry future nerf/balance change, wall priest way be more problematic/stronger now but baku and genn are design for now and future they have to big of a impact litterly evry single card needs to be be around them desinged.
---
I tried to argue for Genn not being less of a problem than Baku. They ruin the same things about the game mainly design space and balance. Yes even decks are not as good after nerfs, but after rotation most of the Baku decks loses a bunch of cards and will probably be weaker as well. They will not nerf any of them, they've said they don't want to ruin the cards and as you've most likely seen here on reddit, all the possible nerfs are too impactful or not impactful enough.

It was a nice article btw.
---
You reply doesn't make much sense in this context.
---
Decks can have alternative wincons and switch from aggro to control. Just like it's a very real wincon for druids to just smorc people down with hero power and minions.
---
How can you get this mad over something you also consider so dumb? I’m confused.

Anyway, stew on that. I’m pretty sure me replying to you and you acting better than me is about all you have going right about now. So I’m just going to block you and take away your one source of apparent victory.
