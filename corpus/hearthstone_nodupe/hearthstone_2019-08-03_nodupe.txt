Yes and no, I got zephrys, but no other singleton one, got the priest quest which could be nice. But to counteract that I got collossus of the moon which I consider the worst/least interesting.

Got only 6 legendaries in 133 packs, same result as Rise of Shadows... rng gods are failing me :/
---
Yes. It's a casual deck that I like to play.
---
I got 11 in 133 and 3 of them golden. Am I lucky?
---
Actually 13. Forgot about Elise and The quest
---
It's not that hard to have a secret in play. The new secret is pretty good and there's even a new card that adds a secret to your hand. Even if you play it on turn 5 it's still a 4 mana 7/7 with no drawbacks in one of the best decks of the set. Sounds pretty good to me
---
Well the pic says that "Minions that summon minions will summon 4/4" so I can bet that Moroes will summon 4/4's

Weird flex but ok

&gt;bad in the mirror
---
For what? Having one health?
---
It can just end the game if it's behind a taunt minion so why wouldn't I play it?
---
No, you can look at resources like pitytracker.com and the ratio of rarities in packs has never changed.  2 million+ packs data set.
---
He's saying he's lucky to get a legendary for every 30 packs he opens
---
Crazy man... which legendaries golden? I was 6/133 =(  only a golden arm (but I like taunt warrior - I loved the quest taunt war), but at least of the other 6 siamat, rogue/priest legend and dark pharoh were included.... \*looks down and to the side\* and that lame druid 1 of each card....

Poor warlock not getting any love

I can also confirm that I've set up a fireside gathering, and we're experiencing the same exact problem that the OP is. This is pretty lame, I gotta say.
---
&gt;So do I, in trhingg to run a control quest mage with Janali, khadgar power of creation, etc. Hope it works with the value from spells every turn
---
I ran power of creation for so long but found it lacking sadly, sometimes I got minions that were just really bad.

I mean, he's dismissing OP as not that unlucky, when OP is as unlucky as mathematically possible.
---
That has nothing to do with the piano unfortunately. You can open and close the gate by clicking on one of the stones in front of it. This reveals an item belonging to one of the four explorers.
---
He also makes some incredible budget deck guides. Can't wait to see what budget decklists he comes up with for SoU.
---
Lucky, I only pulled 1. I did get 3 Body Wrappers though.
---
Well, things like pity timers and a legendary in the first 10 packs makes averages not entirely representative. If I had the worst luck ever, I would have gotten minimum 4 legendaries still. So, getting 1 more than that seems pretty low, and comparing to other's numbers (I saw alot of 8, going to like 12 ish) I do think I did get below the average of what people are opening.
---
Same here the two ideal Goldie‚Äôs for me
---
Are Elise and Druid quest
---
I would love a suprise expansion or even just random card dumps so ladder feels less net decky
---
&gt;2 | 0

---
We live in a society.
---
Well i repectfully disagree!
---
Isn't everything more expensive when you buy from the mobile versions though? Cause Apple and Google take a cut? Last I checked, everything you can buy with real money is more expensive on mobile than the PC or MAC clients.
---
It‚Äôs balanced as far as hero cards go. 
---
The issue is that not all classes have hero cards so it makes it hard/impossible to play a control game vs. warrior. And if your deck revolves around pushing minion damage, and you‚Äôre against a warrior, forget about it.
---
I‚Äôm actually glad people are finally realizing the power of hero cards.. in KFT, since every class got them, people didn‚Äôt truly understand their strength.
---
No.
---
To be fair, Talanji would have been a brief speedbump for his opponent. It's like a 1 in a 1000 that Rafaam can win you the game from that position.
---
I feel man. That's what I got in RoS. But I'm being optimistic and got the 130 packs this time. If I roll bad again, idk what I'm gonna do lmao. Cry I guess.
---
Well, he says replace your hero with "lord jaraxxus" and since he is "lord jaraxxus" he replaces your hero. For him to replace your hero, he has to go to where your hero was, so he leaves the board. The interaction with shudderwok makes no sense though.
---
Brian ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt call me Brian ‚ÄúBrian ‚ÄúBrian Kibler‚Äù Kibler‚Äù Kibler‚Äù IS great
---
Definitely not. I‚Äôve been dissapointed in paladin for several Xpans now. Used to play the class a bunch back in mean streets for the fun of it but it‚Äôs just not going anywhere. At least I don‚Äôt feel like it.
---
Thing is, you CAN try all the meme decks, even after the meta is established. The two weeks after launch are a perfect chance for that. You just can't expect to win all the time with a trash deck vs people who actually want to win.
---
Whine more about not getting free cards. You probably frequent the complaint threads about not getting enough dust refunds, too.

Awwww I miss toast

you have nice mic quality but there is some buzzing noice then you can hear the clearest when you are silent so you should look into some filters and shorter video are more appealing so maybe make them a bit shorter around 20 min

F
---
If people don't know top tier decks right from the start it's much easier than win and the meta settling to decks to try our is easier and more fun than having stuff already set before you're able to play.

The question is why this should be a thing in the first place. Why do streamers have the ability to play? It kills most peoples hype

Awesome

Yeah but he printed Parasite Paracide

That would costs them money. Nope.

Same with how I get pissed at tech reviewers getting pre-production/engineering samples before they get released onto the market /s
---
No, I mean when playtesting it, I also played gorillabot. Once with no other friendly minions, once with only a novice engineer on the board. It gave me the discover both times.
---
Funny shit here, first pack I opened I got Octosari.
---
He is too OP
---
You get a legendary every 20 packs im average.
---
You just are asking the average to appear in two sessions of pack openings. Sorry but you don't get how chances work.
---
Dortner1#1115 NA quest trade. My game is glitching and not letting me accept friend requests. If you message me, I can add you.
---
I ain‚Äôt that far in the anime yet. Don‚Äôt know the card.
---
Hahahaha tbh the Odds are in your favor, give it 25 years
---
You have 4 packs from the event? Huh, I only have 3
---
Yes, in fact about 50 others posted the same thing
---
Piano? Meaning... megalovania in hearthstone?
---
Tried overflow for draw ?
---
I‚Äôd rather play maxenna
---
This is a super solid card especially if you're new. Getting any legendary makes this one of the most fun cards. Besides,most of the other dragon legendaries are pretty niche. You can slap this bad boy into any deck and not feel like it is hurting your deck.
---
Oh man, my bad. I tried checking the newer posts and only found one, and they mentioned it was for fireside, which I knew already.
---
8 legends. Pretty average for me compared to the last 2 pre releases I‚Äôve done
---
What did you pick??
---
If you drew those six copies before your hand got filled up, yes.
---
Once you hit ten cards in hand, Myra's Unstable Element just dumps the rest of your deck without really drawing it.
---
Imagine we still had Vanish in standard
---
Really? Aww, I had a deck idea but it required it to actually draw the copies
---
That granularity would not help anything. It would just make stuff awkward.
---
To be fair, Thjis did manage to go on a win streak with Quest Plot Twist Lock
---
I still think it's bad advice personally
---
Boy are you going to regret it in a year's time when they print a card that says "if your deck contains only legendary minions, your Poisonous minions gain charge and become Poisonous to Heroes".
---
Yeah? you‚Äôll think that way until you opened 4 millhouses in a row. ‚ÄúI could be having 3 other legendaries right now if I just held out on not dusting that one bad card for 400 dust‚Äù
---
I hope he gets recognition from Blizzard in the future. Criminally underrated Hearthstone youtuber.
---
Thnx mah dud
---
I upvoted you too haha. It might see play actually. At least i will.
---
Astounding!
---
Apologies for the poor title. I didn't make this to discuss the viability of the card. Can't say until the expansion drops.
---
I was opening packs and got this golden beauty and I love it. There's a few other cartoonish art styles (like Kill Command) in Hearthstone, but none like this. 
---
The foreground is active and is of standard Hearthstone style. The background is such a contrast that really portrays the "madness" ensuing. The purple and green swirls really spoke to me and I just wanted to share!
---
Star aligner counts itself as the third minion
---
&gt;His definition literally went against your earlier statement of freezing a minion being interactive.
---
Freezing is interaction. That's just a fact. Go cry somewhere else.
---
and dragon
---
Deep down, every paladin is Yes paladin.
---
What you're saying is not objectively correct it depends on what you want from a set. You shouldn't give out bad advice like this imo but Idk you do you I guess
---
There‚Äôs a reason I put ‚Äúnerf‚Äù in quotes, I guess. It‚Äôs not changing the card to be worse, but instead changing the card to be more consistent.
---
His name is Brian Kibler, his tag is Brian Kibler, and his website is Brian Kibler Gaming. So it seems he is fond of his own name. The first Hearthstone tournament he ever played in (this is like 2014?), Twitch chat spammed assorted copypasta about Brian "Brian Kibler" Kibler of Brian Kibler Gaming (maybe it was already a meme in MtG, I don't know, not familiar with that community).
---
Eh, Maexxna wasn't that good and this new one isn't going to see very much play, IMO. As the mana cost rises, each mana means more. 
---
Attack is worthless when it comes to poisonous. I'd rather this beast be 1/11 or 1/12 than 3/9. If it was 1/11 or 1/12 it would see play, guaranteed.
---
I'm not sure that's what the card needs though it's clearly broken and needs to be nerfed. Personally I think Delivery Drone should just be removed altogether so Warriors have to start playing Ysera/Cairne for threats which would weaken their matchups vs aggro
---

killerofhero#1645 NA. Wanting to trade gold quest. Wanting to do so with a tavern game too that I can win for my classic pack.
---
Pathetic.
---
Yup same here. 7 legendaries. Atleast the ones I pulled were bit good (I think). It just balances out that I got 17 legendaries from RoS 130 packs
---
The sun is shining.

I feel like hammer is worse ‚Äî the force is more focused while the pipe had more surface area.
---
Something something, no profit, something
---
Outjerked yet again.
---
Yeah fuck that card.
---
Seriously man whenever you feel like you need some help I am always keen to help the less fortunate.
---
Cenarius is more like Galaxy. It is a game winning powerplay. 9 mana for 13/16 stat in which 8/8 are taunts slit into 2 bodys is nuts. And even more insane if you have boards before hand. If a card make you deck much more powerful, then i will call it is required. Of course you can still play the deck without it if you dont have it, doesn't mean it's not important. And the main point i don't agree with you is your reason that you can get it from other means. Can we just call omega devastator not required because you can get it via Boom or OA? I guess not.
---
Yeah? I‚Äôm already keen to shoving my foot up keyboard warriors asses
---
All of those cards are awesome and having a single duplicate in a Reno deck is not a big deal.
---
Such a missed opportunity.
---
I have never downvoted a comment due to a disagreement in my life. Maybe someone is following the thread and downvoting you or you kissed someone off and they stalk you and downvote you.
---
I actually have you at +12 on RES because I've evidently agreed with you a lot on other threads
---
But I buy the same amount every time, it‚Äôs just a matter of customer satisfaction. Even if there was a limit on epics, it would have virtually no impact on the overall amount of money most people spend on the game.
---
Maexxna would definitely see play if it had 8 attack
---
Questing Explorer would work.
---
It was the same in game :https://www.reddit.com/user/Qsefthukoap/comments/clg167/nozari_bug/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link
---
IMHO they could remove the restriction and it wouldn't matter for Wild.
---
I bought the $50 bundle with $50 blizz balance and had $0.01 leftover. But maybe its different between states/countries?
---
 I opened 83 packs and got:
---
7 Legendaries (Sir Finley, High Priest Amet, Bazaar Burglary, Corrupt the Waters, Vessina, Armagedillo (Golden), Octosari) 
---
 21 Epics.
---
Quite satisfied although I would have loved to have opened Elise or the Druid Quest :)
---
Whoever decided keeper of uldaman should be a common card definitely never played any arena, screw him. Blizzard not giving any fuck about arena balance really remind me about WoW arena balance where it was obvious you were considered a second zone citizen compared to PvE or even battlegrounds, even though they kept saying it wasn't the case. Only a few changes would help, but they still don't even want to bother. Well I don't care, I play mainly constructed now, but still, blizzard never changes.
---
Play to win?
---
How are you able to open Uldum packs already? The expansion doesn‚Äôt go live for another 3 days.
---
What website is this?
---
LOL and it's not me this time!
---
How have you opened Uldum packs already???
---
In his newest videos he's been using Academic Espionage with the Auctioneer as an engine, if he changed things on stream I am unaware, and thus you may very easily be correct.
---
I think I put Siamat as a 5 and Zephrys as a 3/4 i forgot now, probs a 4. It will be played if there is a highlander deck and i think there will be at least 1. He'll be one of the stronger cards too.
---
/r/unexpectedshrek
---
got outjerked again
---
If you have 1 mana left in the late game, Zephyrs isn't gonna offer you 1 drops over big 9 mana cards like alextrasza and ysera, that's just not how the card works. It'll find you cards you can play this turn if any of those cards are good in the situation. If you play him on 8 you're pretty likely to see a 9 cost minion unless there's something more urgent. Maybe you have to use most of your mana first to manipulate him in that case, not sure.
---
I feel bad for Cenarius. I think he's a pretty good card on paper, but for whatever reason never really fits into any druid decks. Even token decks don't run him.
---
Zayle decks will be changed on the first expansion next year when some of the cards rotate out of standard.
---
Sanee#2973 EU, 80g,  i'll show quest, you go first

How many tries did it take you though? (for the paladin decklist)

Sure but they both put you in the hospital with permanent brain damage. The outcome is so uniformly terrible that it doesn't really matter which one is worse. Let's just not get bashed in the head with either of them.
---

---
forbidden APM?

I feel like you're not getting my point. They're both such bad outcomes that it doesn't matter. Honestly, I might even prefer death over permanent brain damage. Let's just not do either.

---
Well Written funny joke.Meh...

Oger: AHAAHAHAHAHAHA
---

---
At least I know how to use the word "literally" or "even" the right way. How this beats priest? You obviously play n'zoth over and over again, adding minions to the field which return enemy's minions back to the hand. It's cool if you don't care about that, but in my opinion this shit is more interesting than those stupid ass combos with new cards you see all around this thread which doesn't even make you smile anymore.
---
Is dis the new prep coin-cede rogue?
---
Yep. You can even get MCT now from discovers. Fun!
---
Personally? I'm actually against the idea of limiting our ability to pull duplicates. Including legendaries. Simply because if Hearthstone was an actual card game there wouldn't be a limit, you could pull the same card 30x and you'd have no compensation from the card company besides a note saying "Suck it up and buy another pack, that'll be $2.99 thanks". Is it a nice quality of life change to not receive legendary duplicates? Absolutely! Do I feel we have the right to request no duplicates? No I don't feel we should have any say in duplicates. Requesting no epic duplicates is like basically telling Blizzard "Don't give us any duplicates ever again I want to be able to receive the whole collection in only 54 packs" and that's just an entitled gamer mindset. So my advice, same advice the other card companies would tell you "Suck it up and buy another pack"
---
Yes, I know this. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. It only works on a mass level, and that won‚Äôt happen.
---
I‚Äôm not demanding this of Blizzard. It doesn‚Äôt make or break my enjoyment of the game. I‚Äôm asking if it‚Äôs a feasible thing they COULD put into the game to better the player experience.
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk will never be able to keep up
---
On the other hand, hammer can't be stolen by Cabal Shadow Priest. What, what are we talking about again?
---
With other card games, you can trade cards that you don‚Äôt want.
---
Blizzard does not do this. If blizzard did allow card trades, I would agree with you 1000%.
---
You don‚Äôt know that. They may have assessed that people bought less because the risk of pulling a duplicate was too great to justify purchasing a pack.
---
It could have actually raised their profits for all we know.
---
Give this man a medal!
---
Are you kidding me? Its the most important aspect of the deck!
---
I said MAINLY fringe
---
And the Luna's mage would be fringe without Luna's at 5 cost
---
It's not busted in the right deck, it's busted in both Mech and OTK Paladin
---
Master's Call stops the deck from running Houndmaster and Houndmaster Shaw, Crystology allows for REALLY efficient draw, which allows you to get more draw, and fill out your curve in OTK Pally, and allows you to draw good mechs for the early game in Mech Paladin. Having Crystology on Turn 1 usually wins you the game, it's SUCH a good card....
---
Best draw in standard, 1 mana draw 2 cards that you want to draw early on&gt;3 mana draw 3 cards which you may or may not want early on, with a fairly large restriction(it's still an insane draw card and is one of the carries of Midrange Hunter, it's so worth the restriction).
---
Hum ok it is...
---
I'm not so sure that works to be honest. Look at the Witchwood Pre-order. That was the first time I pre-ordered since Goblins vs Gnomes, because it was a damn good deal. It was well-discussed on reddit how good a deal it was, and how many people preordered because of it. I haven't preodered since the witchwood because they abandoned the offer, and we got crappy overpriced deals again.
---
&gt; Who gives a fuck about the amount of legendaries you unpacked?
---
What are you on about? He gives a fuck, obviously????
---
It's probably much easier to use HSreplay data then to rely on people filling out a survey
---
Huh didnt know that Saxon Hale would be three.
---
Yeah, it's a tough choice. Last expansion, I built a plot twist warlock with the two portal demons. It's fun, really fun, but it's shit. That's the risk I took, and I had enough fun for it to pay off.
---
I think this is the most up to date memeing I saw a company do.
---
by any objective standard $60 *should* give you a full playset of all cards in an expansion. yes, CCG pricing is exploitative. no, i don't have any sympathy for someone who spends $130 without researching what they're actually getting for that money.
---
Yep
---
Somebody just played a card from Uldum against me in the Tavern Brawl, the Hunter Quest. Is that expected behaviour or a bug?
---
I always end up spending so much money when a new expansion comes out. This expansion has been so boring I haven‚Äôt been able to gain gold because I‚Äôm tired of playing HUNTER!
---
They're legendary, so yes.
---
IMO, the best battle royale game!
---
Thanks! I would not have expected Finnish at all. Love his accent, it sounds so wise.
---
Maexxna really needs a buff more than any other card. It's embarrassing to be called a Legendary. I think if they gave her Stealth it'd be a good buff that wouldn't ruin the flavour. Or Rush, one of the 2. But since Rush wasn't in Naxx I can see them not wanting to include it. Can't be targeted by spells or hero powers could be good too, but potentially way too strong.
---
That's not a pun, but it is pretty funny.
---
It‚Äôs tough because new players need to spend quite a bit to get a good collection, but I‚Äôd guess they don‚Äôt want to make it achievable for a dedicated player to get every card without spending anything.
---
Plague of Murlocs seems absolutely crucial if Mech decks and Cyclone Mage are still a thing post expansion. With Scheme being our only big clear I can definitely see Earthquake getting a slot. 
---
Also, maybe a crazy opinion but Shaman has a lot of removal options and cards that are really powerful and synergistic but don't find it's way in most of the lists due to competition, so I wouldn't rule out a Highlander version with Zephrys from being semi viable.
---
Sorry, replied to the wrong comment! I'm not deleting it though, otherwise I'll end up being a little bitch.
---
No worries :)
---
You can get duplicate Mythics, but they are much rarer and you can get four copies before it starts converting it to gems. It's annoying for collection completion, but being able to draft and just snag specific cards balances it out a bit.
---
Delivery Drone into Weaponized Pinata, or Elysiana I'd guess
---
Earthquake, Plague Of Murlocs and Siamat.
---
Fair enough. I still hold my argument, but i can see where you are coming from. Sorry for the passive-aggressive tone from earlier comment though.
---
Yeah Hearthstone is terrible value for money if you actually want to own every card. Just get packs from gold and then craft the cards for top tier decks after the meta stabilises.
---
With paladin i went for huge magnetic minions. So your magnetized 15/20 [[upgradeable framebot]] will give him a simple 1/5 upon death. Similarly a giant magnetized [[mechano egg]] will be a huge threat for him and upon death will give you an 8/8 and him a 0/5. He also has no ways to buff his guys other than anti magic shell.
---
For warrior you will have to craft 2 [[stubborn gastropod]] and one [[alarm o bot]]. Then fill the remaining deck with mountain giants and sea giants and war bears and shovelfists and every big thing that you can find. Turn 2 gastropod into turn 3 alarm o bot will overwhelm him very quickly.

3/0/3 Mech | At the start of your turn, swap this minion with a random one in your hand.  
---
Hs is not a trading card game. It's just a card based rng simulator.
---
Are the parks available or something??
---
Yes but they probably decided in advance that "reborn" and "deathrattle" would be interacting a lot of the time, and didn't want to make the visuals hide that.
---
Don't preorder. It is an enormous ripoff. You learned your lesson unfortunately.
---
The payoff is not good? Imagine playing the hero power and then a sludge slurper. You get 2 lackeys with double battlecries, and lackeys have great battlecries. Thats a ton of value out of just 1 card. Then imagine playing EVIL cable rat too, same amount of value. And then if your whole deck is build around it, you can do that shit every single turn after you complete the quest. And then when you finally run out of value and tempo, you have a shudderwock to repeat it alle again.
---
I mean. They are both based on Tom sellic 70's manly men right?
---
houndmaster shaw on board, you are frost lich jaina with 2 health left, your opponent only has an abomination on board, and you have the blood troll sapper on board + need two damage from magma rager dying. Magma rager: rushes into the abomination, healing you past the point of death while killing the abomination and dealing an extra 2 to your opponent from sapper.
---
You can open them now if you create a private fireside gathering
---
Spell with battlecry. Nice
---
 Your opponent has played Loatheb off brann so you cant cast spells, they died smh by RNG generated from trades. Your opponents board is a 11/11 and he has played that card that lorewalker cho has in the tutorial where he is immune while he has a minion, he also has a secret that happens to be mirror entity. you have houndmaster sho and two 1/1s. Next turn you only have 5 mana.
---
I mean, the last triple AAA title I bought I played for 30 hours before I was bored of it and quit. I have poured hundreds of hours into Hearthstone and the last time I spent money on it was a Witchwood pre-order for $40. It's not exactly apples to apples.
---
Hyena Alpha looks broken

Accuracy = on point

I sometimes forget that arena is still a game mode.
---
Coffee addict seems about right!
---
Thanks:)
---
Makes me want a murloc
---
Haha, good luck with that.
---
Unless you send them an actual message, they wont know the reason. Droprates on epic/legendaries is probably the last thing they will change, unfortunately.
---
133 should be... 7.15 legends, not counting about half a golden legend. You're way behind average.
---
SAXTON HAAAAALE!
---
You forgot to explain how I defeated my own argument and hurled pointless insults instead.
---
Try again while demonstrating that you're actually reading these comments and say something convincing.
---
What about "Holding Out for a Hero" by Bonnie Tyler? 
---
It's the song that the Trailer song is based on.
---
Fair enough yea
---
I don‚Äôt think it will be enough- the thing is in wild control is the worst archetype
---
Is this a copypasta?
---
Fel reaver treachery isnt a meme. Its legitimately a really good combo right now in wild.
---
I personally think quest Hunter is going to be the new token deck that people climb with. Savage roar hp sounds too good to pass up for an aggro deck. Now I think it will play more mid-range but just summoning beast turn after turn can get you far. Only concern is that mech
---
Your argument is "I shouldn't have to wait, you can wait if you don't want to net deck"
---
Defeating your argument in the same way that someone does when they say "it's just a seat bro". Exactly, it's just a seat so find another one dipshit. 
---
Next time you try to shut someone down atleast read their comment first.
---
How's that a pun?
---
But also below the hair-line. That's probably what was confusing them.
---
The pricing of hearthstone has pushed me to auto chess honestly just easier.
---
I understand the issue, you seem to not understand the solution. Try reading any of my comment. Congrats you're a salty kid because someone gets the toy a week before you do
---
Yes, as Jaina and Sylvanas for magic maiden and drow ranger
---
Hate to break it to you buddy but this system has been around long before. Remember Kinder eggs? Now you have LOL dolls and loot bags for kids toys.
---
Better call your congressman if you want this business model to stop because it's obviously proving to be lucrative.
---
deki#2854 EU 80g quest trade. I'll show, you go first
---
just to answer one of your questions.  Physical tcgs like Magic cost significantly more to get a full collection than Hearthstone does. I used to spend hundreds for a tiny percentage of a new magic expansion.
---
Price is a matter of perspective and you have to take into consideration, that people actually want to get paid for investing their work into this game.
---
Is the expansion out?
---
I‚Äôll have to remake it so it might not be exact but it should be close.
---
"So many imps!"
---
I shall do that when I get home currently playing on my phone which is quite cool that I can play on both pc and mobile
---
decklist?
---
I agree with desert spear possibly being a sleeper but I dont know if it will bring back hunters mark. Hunters mark and candleshot was 3 compared to 5. You do get a 1/1 rush but it will likely not trade well. I think it just needs some more time and cards like candleshot.
---
Feel free to go play the DCG that lets you buy a full set for 130$**..**
---
The number of battlecries you need to play for Pollute the Waters will increase before it rotates. I'm going to lock that in as my final answer.
---
you're advocating that card games don't have terrible business schemes whatever way you cut it by saying "well you can roll a fucking rare or whatever in MTG!"
---
yeah guess what you can also win a million dollars in a lottery but that doesn't make it not idiotic to buy lottery tickets
---
I‚Äôll have to remake it so it might not be exact but it should be close
---
And bring back Enrage.

I assume pro players

I thought its a play on words for status quo.
---
Well i was wrong...
---
I‚Äôll do that currently just play practice matches as I need to win of them and been doing the first chapter of the dalaran heist
---
how is it ridiculous when is free??
---
Except it does? You only have 30 card slots FYI and rogue already has premium removal they need to fit in, along with the burgal package...
---
In my opinion Reno is the best of the highlander cards. But the truth is most of mages powerful plays they want to have as two ofs.  
---
I also think Brann is the weakest, but Hunter has enough good cards to have a singleton deck.  
---
I'm probably wrong, but I think Elise has a lot of potential. Being able to make so many copies of cards has got to be worth something. Maybe with Phaoris?
---
Do you even play this game?
---
They only charge that much because idiots actually buy it
---
We would also love for Brightwing to have it. Please, Bliz.
---
I got 5 legendaries.. Reno, siamat, zephyrs, hack the system and amagedillo and 12 unique epics, 3 of which are golden and a lot have 2 or more copies out of 80 packs. I think you just got unlucky
---
&gt;"I don't understand why you people think this needs to be explained."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;He then explained it to you. You then ask why you think its needs to be explained.
---
Read this sentence over and over again until you finally realize how stupid you are.
---
We'll have to see as its refined. First impressions thus far, is that I find it to be pretty strong myself. Maybe as things develop, it'll appear less strong.
---
Oh shoot that's a great idea!
---
I honestly recommend just playing in normal play mode. New players have exclusive ranks 50-21 (descending order), where you can‚Äôt get matched with veteran players. You can‚Äôt lose any stars at these ranks, and you earn a TON of free packs from climbing through those ranks. It‚Äôll also get you acclimated to the current Standard cards. Dalaran Heist is great but has a lot of cards you won‚Äôt see in Standard right now
---
or actually be able to dust you cards when they rotate out of standard rotation.
---
This is the only one of these posts that‚Äôs good
---
Trading would make the game way more expensive or at least luck dependent.
---
I feel like Zephrys is overrated. I dont see any of the other highlander cards being worth it to run only singletons. Reno is a good board wipe, Elise has some combo potential but I dont see it being consistent enough, Finley is way too draw dependant, and Brann is just a good tempo card, still not worth cutting your deck for. Dont get me wrong this card is an autoinclude if you decide to run a singleton deck, and its really good in wild, I just don't see it panning out as a really good deck in standard
---
Unlike tf2 hats and weapon skins in counter strike( some of the biggest gambling games in online gaming) that golden legendary is literally worthless wow you can use it for a year and then it‚Äôs relinquished to wild which I‚Äôm gonna assume you don‚Äôt play and ta-da a worthless piece of data with no resell value! I hope your having fun
---
\#Checkmate.
---
That's hilarious omg
---
As OP and several others pointed out, to reliably purchase the "full" expansion, you'll have to spend quite a lot of money. of course you can also spend a long time grinding for gold yet that's not what this post is about.
---
Thanks, but still, I can't get it done, am I pressing them slowly or what? :-D Can't hear anything after.
---
Damn my brain must have been sleeping when reading the sentence :(
---
I just call them Reno decks. If i feel like it, i'll call them Highlander. Never used Singleton in my life
---
Similar boat, this is my second expansion I'm taking a hard pass on. The cards in this set are definitely cooler, made it a lot more tempting to not sit on the sidelines for this one. I haven't felt like I've been missing out on anything at all since quitting though. Now I play a wider variety of games and spend faaaaaar less money on those games. The greed factor really got to be too much for me. There is so much that is broken about the HS econ that they'll never address.
---
They added random legendary in first 10 packs last year. The rest is like always: on avarage 1 leg. per 20 packs, worst case scenario:  40 packs for 1 leg. So could be very unlucky, could be close to average, I don't know how far you are towards your next legendary.
---
Thats the dream i just dont see it happening tjat often with all these beefy minions. We arent in the odd paladin meta anymore.
---
You can also just buy the exact cards you want and not have to gamble
---
I got my ass beatdown by a pogo hopper deck with the magic carpet...
---
Might be good with all this lackey support, but I dont think they work well together.
---
Amen. I'm very unclear what the best deck was in my region (asia). Would have been nice to see a post.
---
This is the exact reason why i quit playing the game. Every few months there's a new expansion, which you have to shell out large amounts of money for, just to keep up with the meta
---
reno reno reno honey
---
https://youtu.be/_fLMRJiysuE
---
Just save your gold. I've only spent money on adventures in my entire time on HS and I can play pretty much any meta deck I decide to build. I can't have every top tier deck, and I can't build many meme decks, but I get what I want out of the game and I don't spend any more to get there so I'm happy.
---
Only stops when someone dies
---
Congratulations! You solved it a lot faster than I expected!
---
Our sound and affects team worked hard to get that special event in at the last minute. As far as I know it is the only one.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm uk and I have 3 blue ones and 1 orange
---
**Elusive** for your opponent
---
I pretty much did this despite still being a whale. I craft nothing and own no decks for druid or warlock as literally nothing interests me in those classes.
---
Does that mean the mother is the cow?
---
I love when people take a whiny comment and turn it around on them
---
Its a heal and weapon after all... like he had to be jar before since shudderwock only repeats activated battlecries
---
Yeah that game is insanely expensive. What other game charges $50 (or $80) per expansion, 3 times a year. Paying a minimum of $150, and not *really* getting all that much for your money, is actually pretty outrageous, but the really outrageous part is people continue to pay for it. The only game I paid close to that much for per year was WoW, and let's be honest, Hearthstone isn't even close to WoW.
---
Blizzard has all the data they need to determine what price point will make the most amount of money and unless people stop buying, nothing will change. Unfortunately most people who are vocal on reddit or other forums about it probably still  pre-order. They argue how HS is too expensive but still pay because they don't want to miss out on getting more cards to play different decks. And all Blizzard says to that is "gotcha". They don't have to do a damn thing because they sellin' expansions.
---
That was epic!
---
They wouldn't sell as many packs this way.
---
Yup. Free to play means 90% of there customers they get less then 10 bucks from. The whales have to support the rest so they need to leave room for them to spend hundreds. 
---
Hearthstone isn't even that bad. U can do everything a whale can do just a little slower. Most ftp games give huge unfair advantages to whales and make it impossible to compete top tier without being one.
---
Isn‚Äôt the ability to host private fireside gatherings already public information? I remember hosting one to open packs early for RoS.
---
Calling this a hack is quite misleading.
---
&gt; when you compare the price of a full brand new AAA game being in the ¬£50-60 range 
---
check this out (totes SFW): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhWGQCzAtl8
---
TLDW, since the $60 price point has remained fixed for the last 20-odd years, but development costs have gone up &amp; up, game publishers have been coming up with more ways to get money out of players, above &amp; beyond the $60 box price. Namely paid DLC, season passes, loot boxes or related "surprise mechanics", etc etc
---
Tell me again: how much do you need to spend to buy 3 fucking Teferis?
---
Oh, look. It's just 20$ each. That's just like the preorder
---
Home network??
---
Checkmate
---
Thanks!   
---
The board secrets are my favourite thing in the game.
---
This one was tough!
---
Solved. Like the meta 3 days from now
---
It's supply and demand **at a price.** At $1000 a pack, supply is infinite and demand is zero. At 1c a pack, demand is high and supply is zero.
---
&gt; People keep excusing this with the old "b-b-but this is a Collectible Card Game" bullshit, when your collection is in fact just a bunch of 1s and 0s that can easily be taken from you anytime.
---
This is the part that gets me, really. If you play paper Magic, your stuff has resale value. I can sell my collection very easily where I live for a fair bit of money. Less than I put into it, sure, but I get something.
---
For Hearthstone, I could possibly sell my account to someone, but then I'd lose my other blizzard games, too. It's not nearly as liquid as a real life collectible card game.
---
They always do....
---
Yes you can.
---
Teleports behind you kid
---
You still have to buy a lot of them, since you get so little dust from dupes. And the no-dupe rule for Legendaries really encourages you to keep buying because you *might* get your final Legendary soon.
---
So mage has the most ones then.
---
Alright, mind sharing your BattleTag (your username + the 4 digit number that comes after it) so i can add you?
---
fact: maexxna would still be legendary worthy if poisonous were to never be a thing
---
This isn't a hack lol
---
Yeah, this place can be particularly bad at times. I‚Äôll ask a question about a niche interaction and get downvoted for some reason.
---
Not saying it‚Äôs always like that, of course, it‚Äôs just kinda baffling sometimes.
---
Doing this wont get me omega banned or anything?
---
It should have been echo.... everyone was arguing this - once a keyword effect is used outside of its expansion it should be an evergreen keyword.
---
Yea in magic you get 100% of your "dust" value/cost for your card if you sell it to another player directly and still prob better than blizzes if you sell it to a reseller.  I guess the difference is that many mtg cards are effectively worth 0 "dust", so maybe it evens out.  
---
Don't worry the "MTG is just as big a ripoff as HS" people will gladly jump in with their 0 sense.  On second thought, given post age their prob already a good portion of the 300+ comments.
---
"I don't use the available channels to solve my problems - it's someone else's fault!"
---
With MTG you're buying physical cards that have market value. You can get a good portion of your investment back when you're burned out on Magic, and potentially break even or make money depending on format/cards/the market in general. Besides that, you can trade cards you don't want for ones you do at a much better rate, or even 1 for 1 with other players. Not saying it's not an expensive game, but at least you've spent it on physical cards that can hold value.
---
"Cannot be targeted by spells or abilities your opponents control."
---
"Cannot be targeted by spells or abilities."
---
"Cannot be targeted by spells or Hero Powers." 
---
Yup, totally dissimilar. 
---
On a less dismissive note, they are incredibly similar and even have purposeful secondary interactions that still allows a player to interact with the card. In shroud or hexproofs cases, it's the choose wording, and in elusive's case it's battlecries.
---
So? If something else gets him then there will be other people having the same discussion about it. Just because people are weak doesn't mean you have to prey on them.
---
6 is the minimum amount possible. You got unlucky. I'm not sure how people are saying that's the average? Can anyone tell or show me how?
---
2 base for pre-ordering
---
1 for the first 10 packs
---
1 every 40 packs (120/40 = 3 legendaries minimum).
---
Unless you didn't get a legendary until the very last pack every time, you are close to a 7th one.
---
sigh.. i hate how everyones suddenly using fast pace meta. got dominated within 5 turns in 90% games since new season
---
Just to clarify, you feel better about spending $1000 on something and selling it for $300 than just spending $500 on something?
---
To be honest, I feel like a lot of people here think 130 is a lot.  Mind you, I'm not super rich, and I am indeed a functioning adult.  I ended up buying it because I sat down and financed it out.  130 is nothing over the time we've been able to purchase these bundles. 
---
The plus side is that s cards start to be revealed, and it seems the expansion might flop, then just spend your saved up money on something else (or invest it).
---
Where people get in trouble is when they buy the expansion the second it comes out, not worrying about the financial impact or even evaluating their opportunity costs.
---
Wow. I am clearly just sayong what i do personally. If i wanted to i could just go infinite in arena and never spend a sent on this game. I am saying you can obtain every card relatively easily and quickly without spending money. I choose to spend money because I enjoy deck building and using all the new cards they day they come out. In have done arena grinding and made 3k gold in a month relatively easy thats 3k gold plus the packs from the runs that i have done. Honestly with the gold and dust i have inprobably could have crafted this entire set.
---
its funny, because WotC usually like getting money. when even they do something like this, it tells a lot about blizzard.
---
The best jam is a toe jam.
---
Hearthstone is cheap.. i know someone spent 60k+ on lords mobile and he aint even in the top 100.
---
Few hundred dollars is the cost if you really really want all the cards from new xpac
---
Maybe you should make that(the art) the focus of your statement instead of whether or not the card will see play(it definitely will).
---
Give him 1 gold to be evil üòà
---
&gt;you know the drop rates
---
Are these given out by blizzard themselves or are these guesses from data analysis done by people?
---
Wait what?
---
Fortnite?
---
In paper magic, people don't really buy booster packs except for draft. For competitive play we just buy the cards individually. Only buying the cards you want makes it cheaper in some ways. Hearthstone shines in that cards will always cost the same amount dust. Dr. Boom Mad Genius will always cost 1600 dust no matter the demand, while in magic cards that are "essential" have the price driven up.
---
You can‚Äôt get shadow step from Zephrys
---
Zephrys cannot give you cards that could return him to your hand.
---
&gt;Yup, totally dissimilar.
---
They are very different. You're being disingenuous on purpose just because you want to feel correct. You can target these hearthstone minions with things other than spells or hero powers. That's why it's not a keyword.
---
Some standard decks can even cost over $400. 150-200 is being generous
---
This is amazing! Thank you for posting this so I could put [this nastiness](https://imgur.com/a/1IFuHwx) together.
---
Damn, every time
---
If lackey-heavy zoo deck becomes a thing, carpets are obviously optimal for the deck. History seems more effective for token heavy decks where you fill the board with little amout of cards. Whispering woods into 10/9 zilliax could happen in token druid i think.
---
Hey Thisisdanmurphy, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it includes the term "Petition". Calling a thread a petition is essentially a subtle request for agreement upvotes, and petition threads generally tend to be poor prompts for constructive discussion.
---
You idiot, the ‚Äúdoing‚Äù sound the pipe makes when it hits your head adds embarrassment to the pain, making the pipe worse.
---
Let‚Äôs fight.
---
Can we please not bring up politics in the fucking hearthstone sub?
---
Yeah this is also a great option if you have Luna's in hand as you don't want to use your other turn 3's Arcane intellect or acolyte
---
The fact that you had to couch your title with "(or at least 90)" to try and fend off the inevitable criticism that how dare you think that $400 a year should get you all the content in what is essentially a mobile game is part of the problem.
---
Ofc you're right, I know that which is why I didn't say it ^ ^
---
And In Blizzards defense, at least the money is sort of going into their other projects. Starcraft and D3 got decent (airquotes) support of WoW money, I was able to buy Overwatch for 40 bucks and still enjoy it 4 years later, with lots of new content (though I don't, but that's beside the point.). 
---
And I do think Hearthstone is the most "fun" ECCG on the market, at least from a pure gameplay/design perspective. But the grind fucking sucks. It's sooo ass, and every complaint about it should not receive as much backlash as it does.
---
Just preorders
---
Well, with the double Battlecry effect from the Shaman quest, 5 Pogo's would be enough to get it to 41/41 fairly easily.
---
Battlecry: Gain +2/+2 for each other Pogo-Hopper you played this game.
---
First pogo: 1/1
---
2nd: 5/5 (1 * 2/2 * double battlecry)
---
3rd: 13/13 (2 * 2/2 * double battlecry)
---
4th: 25/25
---
5th: 41/41
---
If you had some way to get enough of them in hand, then the Hero Power with 4 of them on the same turn (first one having been played earlier in the game) will get you pretty close.
---
When I play against other people it's only for quests really, and I try to concede even if I have lethal, I play on casual so I don't give a shit about wins.
---
Sent one as PaleHorse#12754
---
I feel like this would kill a lot of the fun that the card provides.
---
Not sure if sarcastic but might as well not even implement it at all if that‚Äôs what they did. Not everyone is going to open enough packs to even see it change more than once in your case.
---
Just because another game is terrible value does not negate the first point.
---
Hooktusk Rouge is kind of a thing only because of RR.  So that‚Äôs an archetype that actually worked as well, but I agree that the set was weak outside of masters call and Zul‚Äôjin.
---
Time will tell.
---
Really good batch this week. Flavorful and fun without being grossly OP
---
It‚Äôs because it is draw 2 for 2 is strong, and it is in a class that gets synergy just for holding the cards even if they are useful. The reason it had its rating is because it is uncontroversially good. The average reviewer thinks it is good.
---
From your examples, for instance, I have seen a number of arguments that Shaman Quest isn‚Äôt as good as many of the other quests, do those people would be dropping the average rating.
---
Yeah, wild is a different story, but which wild deck can afford the junky reborn minions?
---
Spectate my games. Averages mean nothing.
---
Exact same thing with me, still sadly play league though haha, hoping to get plat this season after being hard stuck silver since season 4, at gold 1 right now.
---
Nah I think i see more lackey posts
---
It's not 'fair' because it's random. You don't know what you buy.
---
You don't go to Louis Vuitton and buy a "random purse". You buy what you want for a fixed price.

Anyone who would sign one of these things is likely aware of how many people complain and how often. Their problem isn't a lack of awareness of one another, it's that they're unwilling to leave the game. It's super easy to stop paying because spending money is completely unnecessary to enjoy the game. As long as they still play the game while complaining they'll never succeed.
---
ooooo that's very dirty
---
I agree, they should buff zuljin so that he my hand size bigger so I can play hunters pack
---
Mech Hunter, Mech Paladin, and Cyclone Mage are basically all auto loses. Midrange Hunter, Dragon Mage, and Control Shaman can go either way. Favored against basically any rogue deck and zoo/token decks.
---
I liked control paladin too, it hasn't gotten any love for a really long time.
---
I'm not saying it's a perfect deck, but it has more of a coherent and workable game plan then the paladin quest has. Also, you can absolutely complete the quest well before turn 10, like I said unleash the hounds is close to half the quest by itself, and if you trade them in then you can use the spell that resummons all your beasts that died to double it up as well. And hunter has more ways to complete it then just that, that's just the first thing to come to mind. Nothing particular coherent at all comes to mind for the paladin quest. The hunter quest may not result in a top tier meta deck, but it will result in something, unlike the hodgepodge of the paladin quest.

For the better....?
---
They added 'legendary in frist 10 packs' and no duplicates but then doubled the amount of class legendaries and now sell 3 expansion packs + adventure per year.
---
Yay!
---
&gt; by both effects making a character unable to be targeted
---
again, that is not an accurate description of the effect.
---
The main problem with this is that this specific keyword has always been misleading. The minion can be targeted by minion effects so it really isn't Elusive. It just can't be targeted by 2 specific things.
---
I never understood people who log onto a video games just to complete a chore for rewards.

9/8/8 Dragon | Battlecry: Set a hero's remaining Health to 15.  
---
Check feary dragons in Warcraft 3, they are literally magic immune. So the lore is there. The counter point is that in Hearthstone they can still be hit by random spell effects and multi-target spells like Flamestrike, but that seems more like a gameplay mechanic rather then a lore addendum.
---
&gt; 1* Seems super low for some of these however. Ancient Mysteries, Flame Ward and the Pilgrim seem awfully strong.
---
they are powerful cards, but Trump rates cards in terms of predicted playrate and tier of decks they fit in over their text in a vacuum. it's more interesting way to look at it than just "this card's text is strong - 4 stars" that anyone can do imo  
---
  
---
but following his own criteria i can see a lot of 1 star ratings getting shifted up to 2 because they are strong enough that enough people will play them regardless. like how he preemptively gave yoggbox a 2 cuz he knows people will love that meme
---
People paying the same as NA would be better for them, once you realize that currently they pay MORE.
---
Even in NA people don't pay the same e.g. Canada vs USA.
---
Warlock has [[skull of the man'ari]]
---
I feel what would be really good is a Commander/EDH alternative in Hearthstone, something where everyone plays highlander, and starts off with more than standard health, as to how to implement commanders without game busting effects like using keleseth or Reno idk, but just a format where everyone has like a 40 or 60 card Singleton deck, maybe even remove the class restrictions and ban a few problematic cards

5/0/3 | At the start of your turn, summon a Demon from your hand.

'untargetable'
---
Woosh woosh motherfucker
---
Drawing 4 cards and destroying your deck is easier than a 7 cards that require a double thorissan
---
Fr?
---
&gt;whales' (vulnerable people)
---
Bro, stop trying to make yourself feel good. You sound insecure.
---
Sometimes it just be like that. What rank are ya? Maybe that had a little bit to do with it...maybe dunno
---
Also joust is the worst? Thats fucking unforgivable wtf
---
And yet, I'm sure you've wasted countless hours logging in for your daily quests, even when you don't really want to play the game.
---
Could you provide the deck you used for Paladin please?
---
Why not
---
I‚Äôm not leaving the game, I‚Äôm just not paying as long as this keeps up.
