Can you send me a link to that?

---
---
The meta changed. Are you actually that stupid or just trolling?
---

---
Why would something from an old meta ever be seen as proof of something for a completely different meta?
---
Take your burden of proof and shove it up your ass or you can pass it along to another one of you Reddit neckbeards who do or say that kind of shit.
---
I’m telling you like it is. You come and say pro tier lists would prove me wrong and then you provide a fucking blog made for noobs and say some nooby shit. I couldn’t care less to correct you or provide you evidence. Go learn for yourself or remain stupid.
---
I think it'd be better if the x axis scale was static rather than changing it to match the most popular deck
---
Were they dire frenzied also?
---
Q is the shirt vsn
---
Compared to the rest of the set. They're all great but there was no fanfare for these cards during prerelease.
---
It was an extremely popular day 1 deck
---
So what beats warriors?
---
Personally it's because most of the decks I've played want the weapon removal to be cheap.
---
Not a bad card by any means. I like it. But the big reasons I'd include weapon stealing are for necrium blade and ancharr, which I want gone before turn 5. That paired with also wanting another action that turn means it's hard to fit the card in. If it's turn 7 I'd rather be able to play a spellbreaker, swipe, brawl, crazed netherwing, etc alongside it rather than be limited to 2 mana and a plain 4-4, even with a weapon charge.
---
I do plan on experimenting with it though! Thats just my thought process

&gt;I am however interested in how Zetalot was using a card "months ago" when said card has only been out for a few weeks.
---
Just like how zetalot invented the priest deck in this topic, he also invented a time machine.
---
Dont outjerk r/hearthstonecurclejerk
---
I mean yeah, but don't be disingenous. The achievements we have are poo. There's no in-game menu to see them, there's barely any, and the ones we have aren't creative/in-game based.
---
Do you know how much more I'd play Hearthstone if I had something to work towards? The current achievement system does not provide that to anyone.

Where can I obtain this treasure??
---
I feel it happened when Blizz started employing him to do things for their game rather than him being in it, encountering ridiculous things that we all encountered and then blowing it out of proportions to a hilarious degree.
---
Its waty more fun to steal their buffed galakrond :)
---
Nice I have it on hunter and warrior but none else
---
I've seen plenty of games where someone got two Amalgams early, then still lost to stronger standalone minion choices and died before they got to the real endgame.
---
Plus, I found Amalgam offerings were consistent enough.  I would see them more often than not.  However, in the current version, my comps tend to flake out and fail to thrive at an alarming rate.  Like, I can have a good early and midgame, only to get to five stars and just never see any compatable or helpful offerings.
---
M4nu#2818 80g NA I show you go first

Albatross priest is a fun deck but the the card itself is whatever
---
&gt; Do you know how much more I'd play Hearthstone if I had something to work towards?
---
I'll never understand this mentality about games.
---
If your NA could I go against you and use your deck? I'm planning on crafting that deck and want to see how it feels, plz and thank you.
---
Congrats :) I dont have it on any hero but priest is the one I'm gunning for. Currently playing a Leeroy galakrond list
---
Yet this is one of the most upvoted posts post nerfs.

---
But like, if you switch comps because someone else is already picking the good stuff, it's highly unlikely that your new comp will beat what they already have.  Like if you realize you're not getting Coldlight Seer and sell your murlocs for mechs, then that's because someone else already has those health buffed murlocs and it might take a miracle to catch up.
---
Tbh I feel like people who abuse these brainless decks and reach rank 10 and above wasn’t actually earned in the sense that you actually worked your way there.
---
Your toughest games were the ones where your side quest wasn’t in your opening hand. Otherwise, it was win for you by turn 6.
---
Playing against countless face hunter decks, there actually is zero thought process outside of which minion should go face first. 
---
Someone reaching rank 10 on literally any other deck is more impressive than a face hunter reaching legend.
---
Congrats, I got to 6 last month, personal best
---
It's so sad to see such a not fun to play against deck in tier 1, the priest just does almost nothing until it destroys your board and start doing his bs
---
That's why you should play Random Mage
---
At what rating?
---
I'm gunning for Pally, but, I'm far from it. Congrats!
---
I play the 1/3 elemental that gains attack equal to the opponents hand size. It’s a good aggressive card for my top-end heavy highlander mage. Forces a lot of trades. It’s almost always a 5 attack card or more
---
Does anyone else hate this meta, both pre and post patch? It just doesn't seem fun at all to me. IDK if it's because I am enjoying battlegrounds too much, or if this meta just sucks.
---
I disagree.
---
This new meta is HARD RNG dependent. Oh you sold your  one drop to buy a hyena and rat pack turn 3. Guess I'm beasts
---
After 4 turns you may only see one or two good beasts after that, and now you're so desperately behind that it doesnt matter what you pick. Amalgalm let players have easier transitions and let skilled players actually make top 4 when given bad luck in the shop
---
But now it's just all shop luck and less focus on strats and attack order
---
You know, for a expansion with huge fun creatures, that's an awfully huge amount of insane aggro decks. Pretty disappointed in how the meta turned out, I wanted big dragon battles but all I got was a bunch of 2/1's and hunters facetiming me.
---
Yea, on a holy pally and stopping (2) 5/6s with taunt right after i wiped the board, even with my healing weapon is impossible.  Gotta love the 21/16 executable damage off of 5 mana from shammies.

Highlander dragon heal paladin is so much fun. I've had many situations where I'm just living till turn ten, put down a like 12/20 nozari and then just start unloading my hand full of gigantic dragons. Dragonspeaker 10/10 card
---
Great tips, thank you!
---
Idk I get random crashing pretty often. Hasn’t been too much of an issue, but still kinda annoying.
---
Town crier should be in every warrior deck.
---
Maybe because it's a defensive class? Idk man
---
Reach rank 25 and play Knights of Frozen Throne Solo Adventure

Necrium Apothecary is not a Deathrattle minion, it's a minion that gains a Deathrattle effect.

Don’t work yourself over Christmas, we can wait!

That was stated as not the reason
---
Pathetic. Complete dominance by a class until nerds and paladin is no where on this
---
Nope, they trigger at "the same time" kind of like how attacking with a lifesteal weapon and dying still lets it heal you
---
Funny bc Face Hunter got me to the same place, but now I can play my meme decks in peace :)
---
This subreddit is 100% better w memes
---
It’s autowin against any control or tempo list and nearly autoloss against any aggression list.
---
I think you're better off just making the most impactful legendaries from those expansions like emperor thurisian or reno.
---
I guess that's it. 
---
I play a good bit of wild and those are about the only cards that still see play in a variety of decks.
---
Could not agree more.  I really wish Team 5 would give us one damn season of control meta.  I’d love for my decisions to actually matter.
---
How does res priest beat rogue?
---
how does this deck win with malygos, you can only play malygos and 1 card no?
---
It’s because Quest Druid became easily countered by most decks right now. I’d never thought that would happen unless Druid got hit by nerfs.
---
No one has mentioned this yet, but watching streamers is a great way to learn how to play and how to think about the game as a whole. You would be surprised how many new players think they are making the right decisions only to get punished because they didnt know what to play around.
---
No it does not
---
This. I think the moment face hunter actually starts getting countered a bit in the meta and thus see a drop in play priest will finally be where it should this expansion win rate wise. All it is, is a counter pick meaning for no reason can it be called a tier 1 deck.
---
useless censorship is just a regular normal fetish in japan
---
Albatross priest tho
---
MMR 3000 stories
---
Veeaaary clever
---
Warrior was the first Galakrond I picked up on, because it seemed like a good addition to the old Rush decks.
---
I think highlander runs it but youd have to look up the stats.
---
Turn 1: Kabal, mana bind
---
Turn 2-4: Stall and develop enough board 
---
Turn 5 or 6: Platebreaker + hit face = gg
---
Kinda confused, but you're saying you were at 17 health and somehow self-killed from humonculous'/other demons with no wrath Weaver?
---
Pure Paladin, Galakrond zoolock and treant/token druids and all tier 2 deck so they them out! I’m a personally fan of Holy wrath but with the decline of Shaman and increase of warrior it’s been pretty hard to pull it off lately.
---
Hey man, thanks for the response! You bring up a valid point, and yeah a break from the game might do me some good. I think I'm just getting tired of going against face hunters and pirate warriors where they hit my face every turn; and then the games where I don't play against those, it's against galakrond shaman and galakrond warrior, both of which have board impacting invokes and rush minions like corrupt elementalist and scion of ruin that just completely invalidate playing for board control cus they can just take it back immediately.
---
That's been my experience with the expansion so far. Not very pleasant.
---
Chaining Dragoncaster into Power of Creation is gonna be busted in the future imo.
---
Do you think people just hate the portrait have an irrational hate of Priest or does that tell you something?
---
Honestly all of them for me right now. For some reason for the last like 50 games all of my opponents have had literally all of their answers on curve.
---
Batterhead?
---
Good. Now the things left to do are:
---
\- Move Cobalt Guardian to tier 4 (possibly even 5)
---
\- Remove Gentle Megasaur
---
\- Add ways to buff tribeless minions
---
\- More specialized tier 6 minions as tech choices
---
\- Balance the hero powers so they are at least remotely on the same power level
---
He was always easy with murlocs, so no
---
Highlander Rogue beats pretty much every non aggressive deck, that's not really a specific flaw of the deck in particular.
---
I beat the lich king will all classes right before the expansion, mage took a while but it just needed a lucky mulligan. Honestly if you get kabal lackey, molten giant, mana bind you’re most likely going to win, provided he doesn’t have obliterate. plate breaker will make it much easier
---
Extra cool!
---
Yeah because the reign of Control Warrior was so fun right?
---
As much as I liked playing Reno, Brann was the easiest for me. With Brann, I usually pick the gnome and the hero power that allows me to pick what to draw next. This increases my chance of getting the gnome.
---
What is face Hunter?
---
People are sleeping on treant druid and it's doing wonders for me. People have no idea what my gameplan is.
---
Control warrior feels really good with the new invoke card. So many 1 damage removals
---
Shirvallah paladin wasn't control?
---
This is equivalent to Keleseth into tap Voodoo Doctor double Happy Ghoul in heal zoo last rotation. It’s a disgusting highroll and almost always instantly wins the game.
---
Is this bot ranked?
---
Dear Blizzard,
---
Please don't push down mobile patches during the holidays.
---
Nobody is in the office to fix them if you fuck up.
---
Everyone else depending on their mobile device while stuck at their boring relative's house is screwed.
---
It's lose-lose.
---
Just instaconcede if they run a real deck. It's only a small minority and you can't lose stars anyway.
---
Well that’s when they start attacking you and your minions then healing them.
---
Yes they know, you are playing a slow deck and have no consistent control cards and they kill you quickly
---
No. He doesn't need a buff, and that would be laughably broken in more ways than one.
---
No goon. Although I do think goon is fun it is also too slow and it isn't necessary. Goon + hero power is an 8 mana ogre with 5 armour. Against aggro that's too slow and against other decks it's unlikely to be impactful enough.
---
I have been climbing with cyclone mage and honestly it’s not that bad, currently went from rank 5 to 3
---
I only knew about it because a reddit user posted the answer he got from CS.
---
Did they make an announcement? Is there a fix out? It literally crashes constantly on all ipads released the last 2 years. That’s a ton of users affected. Do you really think they missed that in testing? And they released it anyway, and then went on holiday.

that isn't the tl;dr, but those decks are rising in popularity right now so if you wanna play them I wish you luck. Is there something I did wrong in this guide that is causing all the dislikes?
---
Priest has mostly been bad since the games inception, but it was usually *ok* in the hands of really good Priest players who understand the meta and make refined tech choices. I've been maining Priest since the beginning and that's why I never complain about it being under powered, it's supposed to be by design. TBH when Priest is strong, it usually leads to very annoying metas. 
---
Now as for this expansion I wouldn't say Priest in the trashcan BUT don't for a moment act like it's strong on the whole, because it isn't. It's countering Hunter at the moment, struggles against nearly anything that's not pure aggro. Really Priest is pretty close to trash, it's hanging on by a thread.
---
Someone need to make a meme with a guy whispering in an ear "rush, lackey"

Thank you, please send me all in detail ^^

Just play hunter now. I got 3 runs with this class and 2 times 12 wins with it. And mostly facing other hunters in high wins.
---
Strangely enjoyable to watch.
---
:D
---
Wait what? You get these with arena wins now? I have thousands of arena wins and never got any of these, can someone enlighten me?

---
Yes, if you silence something that is MC’d via shadow madness or potion of madness, it returns to the opponent
---
Devour cards?
---
The Armor breaker exists...
---
I also started playing again after a long time (last expansion I played was KotFT). I played arena for a while, because you don't need any cards for it and you can still build your your collection. 
---
Recently, a guide about Face Hunter popped up on this reddit and decided to try it. The deck is very cheap and works very well, although I'm now facing more and more galakrond warriors which is a bit unfavourable. But I'd still recommend it. The deck is fun to play and games are generally quite fast.
---
lol all people shitting on this because it's an aggro deck... i got bad news: playing control doesn't automatically make you smarter. you are just average like rest of people no matter what deck you play.
---
Hey! Secret Mage and murloc shaman were the ones I played the last months to get to 10. That's the rank in which I start playing decks I really like.
---
If you're running cards that are only good when played with specific Priest minions, you might as well just run those minions and if those minions aren't good enough to be put in the deck on purpose the strategy is definitely not good enough to enact through random cards generated by the invoke.
---
The problem isn't that the deck is being built wrong, even if you can argue for more optimal card choices. The problem is that generating random Priest minions just isn't good enough for the tempo loss on all but 2 of your invoke cards. Disciple of Galakrond is good, all the others range from meh to terrible when used in the class. The payoff for your deck's build restriction is just too inconsistent to compete seriously with the kind of power that the average DoD deck has and that'll be the case until Blizzard prints some sort of powerful cards that synergize with this gameplan.
---
I use the same tactic when playing poker (rather succesfully I should add):  
---
The best pokerface is not knowing your own cards!
---
4 in 32 chance to pull lasso by turn 2. One in five chance to steal Rakanishu. Ugh. I guess this can work, but I already got bored restarting, one Lasso in 20 attempts, but wrong steal.
---
I sort of agree, playing out all 7 is pretty wasteful and you only need to play enough to comfortably pressure lethal. 
---
However, what if the priest plays cloning gallery or mass res and gets a bunch of defenders or the 2/6 assassinates? In that case, your play could be an under extension which would allow the priest to comfortably set up a situation where they can deal with your trickle threats.
---
So there can be an argument for “over” extending against priest, depending on the game state. It’s also worth noting that he has a decent reload in his hand with Emeriss buff and can easily play out a 14/12 and a 4/2 or Zuljin.
---
That said I may have held back at least the the last set of 0 cost dragons
---
I was so happy to see it gone.
---
Silence the shit out of it.
---
The Warlock cards that sacrifice their own minions for powerful effects.
---
Ah, I thought there was some minion with Devour in their name or something that I forgot about.
---
Arnt they all like face decks?
---
First of all you're talking about Da Undataka, not undertaker, which is also a card.
---
2nd apothecary gains a deathrattle, it is hit a deathrattle minion. If you got it on board without playing from hand it has no deathrattle effect.

You could try mech handbuff paladin, got from rank 25 (first time playing wild for me) to 15 without a single loss. The deck is super effective, often wins on like turn 5, and really cheap, so I would very much reccomend it!

It was king overall based on all games played across very broad archetypes, yes but it wasn’t even close to true if you actually had a premium account and dig into the data.
---
Thanks man. But tbh I really dont know how to play face decks. Usually I burn my hand before the enemy dies.
---
I don’t foresee much sympathy for Pirate Warrior forthcoming.
---
Battlecry: revert your opponent's sidequest progress to 0.
---
Yeah, they are. Highest winrate are usually face/aggro. Maybe a good control deck might work, big priest or mech warrior?
---
It is a face deck. Nothing wrong with playing it, it's healthy for the game to have it, but that doesn't make it a deck full of intricacies or hard decisions. Those few times where it's not 100% the right play to go face don't really make it intricate or hard to play. The average person can make it to Legend with it even if he misses the right play here and there.

Calin17#2110 EU, trading you go first

Whenever a Control deck pops up people demand nerfs too, look at Taunt Druid and Control Shaman.

Well with shaman, there’s at least a bit of decision making and with death rattle rogue. If you don’t draw apothecary on curves you’re kinda screwed
---
FYI, u get golden portrait at 500 wins. And it's your class that becomes golden,not particular hero portrait. So answer to ur question,  yes nemzi would become golden as well. At 1000 wins, u receive a entire new portrait
---
Is really!

Kelebias#2397  (EU) 
---
Not a scammer. You go first
---
Gee Soggoth looks terrible. Did he even see play?
---
Did they really give her that much? Wow, Blizzard really pushing her hard.
---
In an aggro v aggro match you need to recognize who is the control player and behave accordingly.
---
Why the holy wrath? For drawing big minions?
---
What was is comp??
---
The problem with Quest Rogue is that Control decks just could not win against it. You had to play Aggro or Quest Rogue unless you fancied conceding to every Rogue with T1 Quest. Frankly, Galakrond Shaman was more akin to old Quest Rogue.
---
Not saying that Deathrattle Rogue isn't an incredibly frustrating deck to lose to considering it has to draw Apothecary and also not draw Anubisath to have any chance of winning. 
---
But by that same merit it also has weaknesses Quest Rogue didn't. You couldn't silence the buffed minions, you couldn't stop the Quest unless you managed to Counterspell Crystal Core and whilst Deathrattle Rogue can make far larger 1 mana chargers than Quest Rogue ever could, those games are very draw dependant.
---
I think Apothecary should cost 5 mana. Not 4. It essentially cheats on mana (since you're paying for the Deathrattle on the minions, not the stats) and draws cards. Hopefully the next set of balance changes will address it.
---
I feel this one
---
Thank you!
---
So at 1000k wins does that change all portraits for that particular hero? Or would it just change the base hero?
---
Is Galakrond Shaman still good? Or the nerfs hit it real hard?
---
I would say it’s quite the opposite with your deck. My deck runs quite a lot of healing so it’s very effective against face hunter. While vs warrior or any control matchup I usually disguise myself as a plain Galakrond priest deck then surprise them with the Leeroy + grave runes combo for 30+ dmg. Against Rogue it’s pretty helpless because of the huge burst dmg they can do. Unless they get super unlucky, I would say it’s a 30/70 matchup.
---
Not exactly 17, lol it’s an exaggeration
---
But she has around 5 I believe, when playing against face hunter almost every 3rd card has a voice
---
I played against albatros priest in wild, he didn't know that i had flikk and 2 shadowsteps in hand.  He conceded after genociding albatrosses for 2 times
---
for pogos you better stay at t2 or t4.

One thing I love more than Christmas is when folks start insulting you when the truth starts itching them the wrong way.
---
Rank 5 gives you 400 dust every month yet you need to invest 600-800 dust in this brainless hunter deck.
---
And by your helpless sad defensive logic you just end up looking stupid trying to explain here how a 400 dust reward is a good enough excuse to play a degenerate boring deck.

Again I ask, if you don’t enjoy playing it and don’t enjoy the game, why are you playing it?

It's a pretty wacky list, I'm running Deathwing just because I have it golden and for dragon in hand activation, it actually won me a fatigue game lol
---
u/GOODWILLHAWK
---
My best game as Resurrect Priest was with a Warlock player. It was 24 minutes and I was down to 1 health until the last 3 turns. It was a good game
---
How do i waste dust if I get 90% the cards from previous versions of face hunter, and the remaining 2 epics get balanced out from the 400 dust grinds I've been doing?
---
As for why I'm doing it: again, because I always end up with more dust than before and eventually buy myself a better deck to have fun with, you dumb piece of shit. Although now i might just reach rank 2 just to make more people like you cry in reddit forums about how hunter bad made you lose :'(((
---
no, it may be a bug. there was a player who said that he can still use all 23 wild cards. He said that a week ago.
---
And it's a top deck
---
Not a single one of my opponent among 20+ i have faced not have an functional apothecary by turn5-6. And people say it is a high roll deck and that it actually did bad in GM. But then does it mean my luck sucks so bad. I dare you to call it bias. I am not exaggerating. NOT ONE HAS WIFFED. It has driven me to play control Dragon Shaman to hex their shit. Also incidentally the deck has zentimo and priests are also done.
---
So every deck against face hunter has to play control?
---
I had a guy play Albatross Rogue against me while I was playing Reno Mage. His first Albatross came down the turn after I played Frost Lich, dude clearly didnt plan it out while. Even though all my Highlander cards were dead, new Maly and 3 mana Water Elementals were too much for him to handle. One of my most satisfying wins this expansion.
---
Just keep in mind its rotating out of standard in the spring.
---
*Queueue
---
That is a good point but I doubt that is the reasoning behind it.
---
Holy shit, that sounds like Guy Ritchie script.
---
There are even people claiming priest is only viable because it only beasts face hunter and face hunter is very popular, when in reality it beats a lot of the other good decks and face hunter is slowly becoming less and less popular (and lowering its winrate too).
---
Its fun to see those 1000+ ranked wins priest mains saying how bad blizzard fucked up priest, that how could they expect priest to have a viable deck this expansion, etc etc... when still, even with few new cards added, priest still came into tier 1.
---
Everybody just jumped to conclusions way too soon. And I would even arge that it is still too soon to say that this is how the meta will look like for the next 2 months, who knows what new deck will come and take the top tiers by surprise.
---
seems like a huge overeaction to a weapon that can be played in a single copy.
---
This post to be removed.
---
It’s because people complain about the flashiest deck.
---
Lol pirate warrior? Hell no its not the best, it has no good reach against anything controlling and one reno ruins it completely, secret mage is consistently the tip dog right now and its easy to see why, midrange control the board for some early pressure then drag burn after burn to the face
---
The doctor is here
---
And even without checking the card text you can tell from the board that this is an N'Zoth deck.
---
Again, increasing your winrate by around 3.5% with average luck is absolutely insane
---
For a little bit of Backstory: my opponent had me dead to rights. I was on 1 health against face hunter as he slowly whittled me down across many turns. Then, I pulled exact lethal out of my ass with my buffed leeroy. To the hunter I was fighting: if you’re out there, I’m sorry.
---
I don't play this deck, but if you're only getting a +3/+3 off and don't have board control, I'd think you could use your hand of buffed Charge/Rush minions in to clear off a pirate board. Unless your opponent has Southsea Captains behind Taunts I don't see how you could lose that exchange, and if that's the case you could run Sap, silence, Vendetta with a Steal Rogue package, Backstab/Fan of Knives combo, Seal Fate with a Galakrond package...
---
 \[\[thromok the insatiable\]\]
---
You sound butthurt
---
Most of this sub is toxic to everything, but aggro decks especially.  Don’t let it get to you.  The guide is great, and anyone who’s actually wanting to learn and get better will find it valuable.  30-40% of the Internet is going to hate everything you do no matter what to make themselves feel superior, and gaming forums are by far the worst for that.
---
You’re doing great man, and reading it makes me think I was trading too much against Holy Wrath Paladin and Rez Priest.  Need to just embrace the variance and go for it.  So I definitely got something out of it.  Keep it up, and ignore the haters.
---
A.F. Kay is OP
---
So akazam could be the answer
---
wasn't opponent Akazamazarak?
---
You'd expect they'll learn that Priest takes a while to get going every time, but nooo.
---
I remember Cubelock being the better deck but it was more difficult to play.
---
I don’t get it
---
The Omega Medic's in the Priests hand are about to give him 20 health.
---
Quest rogue with Toggwagles scheme: me too.
---
Just sell the mech egg
---
never too early to learn that wild is a joke and every few months a bunch of your collection just disappears for no other reason than blizzard trying to make you spend more money on their game.
---
Blizzard devs hate him!
---
Im not saying you need to listen to random redditors. Just dont throw around bad sourcrs to try and refute them.
---
Oh you, you got me. I had meta deck in the title and didn't specify in the post.
---
We have no idea, but historically speaking, adventures have cost 2800 gold (or 700 gold per “wing”). It will definitely also be purchasable with real currency.
---
Sunfury Protector
---
They concede.
---
HSReplay tier list is a joke compared to vS though. Also, get with it, gloating at the people who thought the nerfs weren’t enough anymore was so last week. The complaint meta had already stabilized.
---
Control warrior with all it's epics got pretty expensive during Rastakhans Rumble and Rise of Shadows.
---
Currently, the cards that should have been removed with the release of DOD were not actually removed. There's a glitch that allows for you to continue using them.
---
I’m not sure what you mean. I answered the specific questions that I quoted in my comment. I also don’t know why someone downvotes me.
---
I’m 7500, I get 80-90 for 1st place
---
Highlander mage in SOU was 20k and was the most expensive one. It got nerfed very quick anyway (conjurers calling and lunas pocket galaxy).
---
I don’t think face hunter is that bad - there is something pure and honest about its play style.  Does it feel good to lose quickly bc you didn’t draw a critical heals or removal? No. But it certainly doesn’t feel like getting hit by 20dmg from hand bc apothocary.
---
Transmogrifier transformed my Rogue Galakrond into Lady in White (a priest card) so whenever I invoked I would get a random priest minion.
---
[Galakrond to Lady in White](https://imgur.com/gallery/hkLiJyB)
---
which card tracker is that for mobile?
---
Hey im trying my best to speak for him, didnt say he was smart
---
Cheers bro! Still trying to master the battlegrounds
---
For similar reasons, I've seen some warrior lists tech in that new spell (Ramming Speed) to help them deal with Faceless Corruptors and Galakrond Shamans.
---
I like the rotations, keeps things fresh
---
OG  control warrior and freeze mage meta was so obnoxious....
---
Yeah, the original comment just made it sound like no one's got removed. Mine all we're short of thirty after the update
---
I actually found on on the comphearthstone subreddit, if you look at one of my comments you’ll see the code and who I credited it to
---
Ahhh that's probably where it came from
---
The best deck in HS history IMO
---
Surely that's a bug as it transforms in your hand. Strange.
---
&gt; Galakrond decks also feel really draw dependent 
---
I disagree with this. Drawing Galakrond early doesn't give you much advantage because you're probably playing it without invokes, whereas Kronx stops you drawing it too late. There is some draw randomness with the payoff cards which can be quite good early, but I think the decks feel less draw dependent than the death knights did.
---
It is pretty polarised, but you can usually adjust a list to make the polarisation less extreme.
---
I think I've read somewhere that you need to concede with sub-15 HPS or reach a certain turn limit.
---
I've seen people play Warlock (in casual) and just play all the self-damage cards to do quests quickly.
---
I dunno so far most the comments on this thread have been well thought out.
---
Eh at that point I just go to something else and keep passing the turns. It's easier to code they way they did
---
Kick the Shaman while he's down!
---
I think you have to be under 15 hp - I had some games that gave me credit when I conceded with less than 15 hp.
---
[[Draconic Lackey]] should add a random dragon. Discover is too powerful with extra Alexstrasza, Ysera erc.
---
[[Scion of Ruin]] should be a 2/2. Invoking twice is not a difficult condition to met. 3 mana 6 damage seems balanced. Not to mention it gets copied with Dragon Breeder and Barista Lynchen. At the worst case it's a 2 mana cheaper Force of Nature.
---
[[Dragonqueen Alexstrasza]] should be 10 mana. She is too powerful on curve. That would give the opponent extra turn to draw a removal.
---
[[Galakrond, the Nightmare]] should make drawn cards 1-cost. 0-cost cards results in too much swindle.
---
[[Phase Stalker]] should be a 2/2. Challenging it should become easier. Currently it can equip multiple secrets, thin the deck while hero power chip-damages you down.
---
These are my current feelings. The meta is still changing. I might feel different few days later.
---
Yea, I know that's what ya mean. I don't expect Hearthstone will ever have a mechanic like that - it doesn't fit well with the way the game flows and it slows things down. Hearthstone's design is definitely focused on being easy to pick up and play.
---
And that's totally fine - Hearthstone doesn't *need* complicated interrupts. However, that means they have to be very judicious with card and deck strategies that are totally unblockable. Full-deck combos with commitments that can be slowed down or prevented - such as Holy Wrath Paladin - feel much fairer to fight against than something like Caverns Rogue or Apothecary Rogue, which happen quickly and with few ways to interact, even if you know it's coming.

2/2/3 Beast | After you use your Hero Power, cast a Secret from your deck.  
---
Cubelock was better though. Hence why it was even nerfed to begin with.
---
I'm pretty sure this is from hsdecktracker which takes stats from people who use it (which is enough to make a valid tier list).
---
I love bumping into it was either Galak Warr or Pirate Warr. Past few have just conceded after 5ish rounds.
---
Pirate Warrior generally wins more around turns 7-10 (two Arcanite swings+) so you probably just got highrolled.  Control the board along the way and if you get off your combo you should be favored from there if you’ve got Scalehide and/or Zilliax in hand.  If you don’t have healing you probably need to do the math the figure out if you can do 30 damage to them in the next couple turns before they can finish off the rest of your health.
---
These seem reasonable the phase stalker surprises me I would thought more expensive vs tweak stats
---
To be a bit more precise, this would be a Johnny deck. Timmy decks want to coin out War Golem on curve because he's a big boy.
---
IDK, seems pretty accurate to me and I'm currently rank 3.
---
Ah okay my understanding was you just couldn't concede but he I guess he decided he'd rather just throw a tantrum and delete his post when no one sympathized
---
It went from S Tier to more of a normal deck that has some rock-paper-scissors matchups.  If you’re facing a fair amount of slower decks it’ll feel the same but the aggro matchups feel much worse.
---
Mossy horror is a MVP, you can simply skip phase 2 by playing it...and it's neutral so you can use it with every class...you can also use vicious fledgling to win with most classes..
---
It's a good card against death rattle minions which twisting doesn't, plague of death is one mana more than twist and it can clear what ever is on board with no consequences, betrug turns are better than dorian for sure but if either drew the other it will be worse, cuz u only get like 2 or 3 different minions
---
It's a good card but needs just 1 more cheap elemental to put in your deck. Who knows maybe we will see one in the 35 cards that we are getting in January. If not then there is still a lot of time for them to print one.
---
I'll try adding 1 nether if it does good I'll consider replacing Godfrey with 2 nethers.
---
Im cut from a cloth if players who believe that a win with an off-meta deck counts for a lot more than a tier 1 deck win. I used to play tournament MTG. I always had way more fun playing with casuals at home because novice players made crazy decks and you never knew what you'd run into. I love the community on twitch and reddit and sharing things about the game, but I wish that more players wanted to innovate more than win. WE could decide the meta if we were not constantly looking to streamers and stats for guidance. But in the end. I'm using every resource available. And for now, I'm using heal pally at the floor of rank 5 to keep out face hunters and let in more of the other guys. Like a club bouncer.
---
Yeah but that just means they get two less class cards.
---
Why should he erase it? This bug needs attention and needs to be -fixed-, seeing as it is incredibly unfair towards some people. 
---
And no, "hurr durr, but it's fun" does not apply if it is onesided and gamebreaking like this.
---
Depends on your brand, I know that Samsung has a preinstalled application named Game Launcher which you can use to record games.
---
Hsreplay.net also has an application named Arcane Tracker which uploads your replays to their online environment. This is slightly less flashy but allows you to go through your games turn by turn.
---
The hardest part.
---
I had the same question. Is there anything that won’t take up so much memory? Also, is there any one in particular for recording on a MacBook that is good?
---
Is that weapon + invoke + HP + heroic strike?  Insane!
---
It's unreliable because people use it to support stances like 'Priest is actually amazing, fuck anyone who ever said Blizzard's handling of Priest is bad' and 'Deathrattle Rogue is OP it needs a nerf right fucking now look at it it's tier 1!!111!!!!!'. It fluctuates too often to give what people use it as - an overview of the meta. It's a good indicator of what people are playing, and what people perceive are good. 
---
Something like VS is much better for a proper overview of a settled meta. Quest Priest is not going to remain 'tier 1' forever (I'd contest it's even tier 1 right now, it's just that people don't know how to play against it and face hunter is still popular because of low dust cost). 
---
I'm definitely not saying HSreplay is a bad tool. It's a useful tool for almost everything *except* describing which decks are truly good or bad in a fully comprehensive sense. Quest Priest is good right now, but once people stop playing Face Hunter/the meta shifts to counters, it'll fall off quickly. Unlike stuff like Galakrond or Evo Shaman, Quest Priest has numerous counters, none of which are difficult to figure out. Hell, if Quest Priest was really able to be a tier 1 deck it would've done so during parts of the Uldum meta. Evo was definitely not the only deck that stopped Quest Priest, and that's when Quest Priest had N'Zoth, one of its most powerful tools.
---
Haha the door man killed me!
---
Oof
---
Oh god please erase this post and don’t let people see it
---
I hate the old adventures.due to deck bulding. The new system is better.
---
Baffled they printed a neutral card that just nukes ALL ARMOR lmfao
---
What exactly am I supposed to be seeing here? Is this some new  meme template that I'm  too boomer to understand?
---
Brave of you to run psychopomp in that deck lol
---
Reno priest is pretty expensive.
---
Reno, Raza, anduin, kazakus as a start.
---
Nowadays you can add zeph and Benedictus and quest and go really nuts
---
Pretty impressive that 5/9 classes have a tier 1 deck (last 7 days on hsreplay)
---
If you include hard mulligan for apothecary and backstab, the chance to have exactly one or more of either by turn 4 is 56% chance to draw, going first. The combination of having both backstab and apothecary isn't reliable and kind of hard to compute(my guesstimate is between 20-25%), but comboing with a 1 mana play on turn 5, well, getting backstab or one of the 8 one drops by turn 5 is 97%, so basically always. Getting at least one apothecary by turn 5 has a chance of 60%. The fail chance to draw both anubisath at this point is about 6%. 
---
Going second you only need the apothecary, and your chance to have one or both at turn 3 is 60%, again with the roughly 5% chance to get both Anubisath in your hand.
---
**TL;DR:**  
---
If rogue goes first, you can expect the combo 60% of the time to happen on turn 5 or turn 4. It's much more likely to be turn 5 because of lack of a combo activator and fewer draws. 
---
If rogue goes second, just expect the apothecary to happen on his turn 3. It will happen 60% of the time, and the chance goes up ~4% for every additional draw from novice engineer.
---
