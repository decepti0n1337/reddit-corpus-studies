Because of Shaman's ridiculous early game plays now.

---
Where is this happening and how do I get a ticket
---
Ty for giveaway
---
i should win bcuz im an og in HS been playing since the realease. Dont believe me blizzard? check my og card backs
---
As a dev I really like Blizzard's developer panels. Game/Card/Level Design is my jam.
---
Thanks for giveaway
---
Hello!
---
I am very sick and would love to take my mind off of it by watching new announcements for a game I love to play.
---

---
You see, I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.
---
I just want to see the shitstorm live if there is an open Q&amp;A. So i volunteer, i should win.
---
TheDog#21600 (EU) 80g quest. I can show you the quest and you go first.
---
Sometimes, you gotta seize a huge opportunity when you see one.
---
Would love to win, since I‚Äòm active in all Blizzard games and can‚Äòt wait for Blizzcon! Best of luck to all.
---
I'd like to win because I could never spend 50 bucks on my hobbies üòî
---
free stuff?
---
Nothing cool, just want to see the chaos that will be blizzcon.
---
Rostorroto sounds so strong, but very exotic at the same time.
---
you use this spell on yourself dude lol
---
While the  Blizz admin are messing up bigly, I still believe in the people making the games and I wish to still support them and their livelihood
---
Everytimeeeee
---
I'd like one because my friend got to go this year and I wanna be there in spirit!
---
It‚Äôs not worth to buy one if I can‚Äôt attend in person, that‚Äôs why I would like to win a virtual one.
---
People complaining .... RNG is so funny ! I'm pretty sure that when RNG is good for you, you're happy ... Right ???
---
This is like straight out of a Wronchi video.
---
If you traded gold for cards, no card should ever trade for more than 1600 gold since spending that amount of gold on packs and dusting all cards yields 1600 dust on average.
---
I woke up, spilled my coffee, slip on a spilled coffee then proceed to hit my head really hard, after i woke up some few hours later i realized that i was late for work. I exited the house, entered the car. Car won't start. Got back inside to check the reddit to calm down and wrote this comment. So, that's why i should win the ticket.
---
I have never experienced it and I'm broke. So yeah?
---
I should win because of my username - it would be very difficult to play Hearthstone without fingers.
---
Because I live in a lousy 3rd world country and I'll never get a chance to travel to an actual Blizzcon nor the ticket will ever have a value that is affordable by our exchange rate...
---
Free primo
---
Leave me alone, dad!
---
Imagine being a Doomsayer who correctly predicts the end of the world... And then gets reborn immediately after
---
I should win because I just spent $250 on chunks of plastic for a Christmas present and I'm going to be complaining about it inside my head for the next two months, so at least with this I'll get a short fifteen minute reprieve before I remember that I spent so much money on chunks of plastic again.
---
So come on, fifteen minutes!
---
I thought it was a good win. Why are you hating?
---
I should win because I don't want to win.
---
Here‚Äôs something even better mechs can‚Äôt be reduced below one cost. Jk mechwarper would be great.
---
where was the highlight? it wasnt lethal even if you didnt have the freezing, just a normal win. if you just wanted to post the fact that you beat someone in rank 20 wild well then you do you
---
So I am a mostly f2p player.  I never buy packs (or at least haven't bought one since open beta).  I buy every adventure with money (I am not f2p due to lack of funds).  I spend all my accumulated gold on Arena runs.  I will also buy arena runs with money when I run out of gold.  I am not a great arena player 4.5-5 wins, but I have only spent $12 on arena runs since May 2017.  I am of the opinion that Arena runs are the best investment. The reward for 4 wins is:
---
* One card pack
---
* 50-60 gold
---
* One random reward  
---
So getting 4 wins is worth at least the 150g investment, it is also at least an hour of entertainment.  So that's how I accumulate my packs.  The biggest issue with this method is you don't get all your cards when a new set is released you have to be patient and get them over time.  I also means I am playing \~2 hours per day.  It usually means I have to pick my constructed decks more carefully, but it works for me.
---
I should win because I like tacos
---
I had a dream today where Yogg floated down from the sky in a white robe and a leaf crown on his head. His tentacles moved eloquently as they soared through the sky. As he came to me he said: "Praise me and you shall receive the finest of all RNG". I then said: "But Yogg, I praise you everyday and each time I cast Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron it always ends with Astral Communion now that it is back in standard!" Yogg then placed his slithering tentacle over my shoulder as he saw the frustration on my face and said: "My devoted Yoggurt, today shall be the day that "random" in RNG will be replaced with "rigged" in your favour". He then floated back up to the clouds as I praised Yogg 10 times for each of the 10 spells in the Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron. That's why I should win this ticket.
---
You win.
---
here goes nothing
---
apparently its true, its been discussed on gwent subreddit 2 days ago too. its public information but not well widely known.
---
Of course you remove the comment calling me a dumbass. Real classy.
---
"SIIIIIIIIIIS, OBEY MY COMMAND"
---
Id like to win to get that sexy Genji skin and I never win anything
---
Your username hurts my soul 
---
:p
---
Strawman thing:  I phrased it poorly and edited things to reflect what I meant better, the wording was poor on my side.
---
As for the OP stuff:  Show me ANY data suggesting the quest is OP.  ANYTHING.  Literally ANYTHING.  Please.  i want to see where you're coming from, but there's no data beyond you saying "It's hard to beat when a late game strategy gets its late game strategy to come online"
---
Show me SOMETHING.  ACTUAL data, not a nebulous "Well the quest is stupidly overpowered, but it only supports a tier 2 deck"  There has to be SOME data you're drawing from here, right?
---
Or is it honestly just a gut feeling?
---
I should win a virtual ticket because I like free golden legendaries. x)  
---
Thank you very much.
---
While competition is always a good thing, I doubt a mobile client is what makes Gwent a HS competitor. It's just not very popular.
---
I hope the LoL game brings some attention and hype back to the genre though.
---
... but why?
---
And if you tell me because it's a free good card, let me remind you of snip snap.
---
Uninstalled today. Aggro stone is getting boring.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for years and never seen what the virtual ticket unlocks!
---
They fired all their community managers and out reach people a year ago.
---
My post isn‚Äôt about ‚ÄúYou should go play Gwent to boycott blizzard‚Äù or anything of that nature. I understand that the game is severely different and hs a **very** steep learning curve from traditional card games, but it‚Äôs the best example I could I think of current mobile card games
---
Because Anime cat girls.
---
Okay. Let me rephrase that. If neither player have brain damage, there is very little agency in the outome of the match so it makes it hard to gain an edge.
---
I would like to win since I want to watch in advance the Blizzcon event. And yasss Golden Legendary
---
They look as expected - they don't die at once, merely one after another, so... lel.
---
one ticket please :)
---
3+ piece combo's that require 10 mana aren't a problem in Wild, it's almost impossible.  Especially with nerfed ramp.  Psychmelon Druid was like a 1-piece turn 7 combo, that's the problem.
---
Rng clownfiestas are the best brawls. The dumb RNG is what makes HS interesting.
---
These nerfs are getting out of hand.
---
He is craftable. But based on when he came out, he should also be Wild-Only, which he also is.
---
It's not exactly the only card where this happened, it's been their procedure all the time.
---
They were problematic. Togwaggle and malygos were both real decks prior to star aligner. And the decks only get better. Aviana was going to need to get nerfed eventually for design space
---
I deserve to win because I love blizzard games but I won't support it's negative business practices and Epstein didn't kill himself.
---
It would be very nice to have another legendary
---
RNG away!
---
I should win cause I like golden legendaries, just like everyone else, but still. Ooh and fancy cardbacks.
---
I like golden legendaries
---
I should win because I like gold
---
üòéü§ôü§ô

I should win because reasons.

---
if u dont want to invest too much aggro mech paladin is still serving me well just hit 4 last night u basically just have to hope u dont run into secret mage or the odd rogues that run sap  then ur fairly fine u beat pretty much everything just by generating giant minions with no silence to be found i think its the best deck to climb because u win fast and if u loose its not a 30 minute grind
---
Did you both get defeated? That's a first by me

This fucking shit is impossible to win, I get mediocre at best, while my drooling opponent has perfect fucking cards
---
I should win it out of pure luck !
---
it's ridiculous how we open hundreds of packs, yet still do not have a single rare or epic card in a a set.  
---
rigged
---
[removed]
---
Well, don't mind if I do!

My horoscope said I will not win this. And I intend to disproof it for that unscientific piece of sh\*t that it is.
---
Yall not goanna talk about the generous mummy's plastic bag?
---
BRUH
---
Well i stand corrected then, but It does feel like blizzard is trying to squeeze as much as possible without doing as well. I believe the grandmaster format is significantly cheaper then the previous tournament format.
---

Regis is such a great streamer. Solem also did a stream and video on a wild variant treant druid
---
Try murloc shaman. Since mage and warrior fell off the meta, not a lot of decks run board clearing spells. Managed to lvl up to rank 5 with it.
---
Aviana, kun, bran, Cthun buffs
---
Aviana, kun, majordomo, clockwork
---
Aviana, kun, djinniof zephyrs, naturalizex2
---
Aviana, kun, togwaggle
---
Aviana kun, honk...
---
Etc etc.  Aviana was common card in all combos but melon.  Also, for Aviana togwaggle you could do a gadgetzan cycle, for the mill variation you would cycle with cold lights and infestation.  Basically hitting melon could result in just shifting to a different draw shell.  Hitting aviana made more sense.  Also, I think wild has been extremely fun and varied this year.   Snip snap has been a problem recently but not as long. As much as it's common to say "they dont care", I think there have been the most changes this year and responses to the meta.  Cyclone mage was the big bad, now its sniplock
---
No it doesn't. 
---
Some is more than none.
---
D
---
&gt; because we've had a ton of data from SoU before DiT, so you'd EASILY be able to find something.
---
Then you should have no trouble proving your ...  
---
&gt;It might have felt strong, but the data shows it clearly wasn't anywhere near OP.  
---
statement right?  Oh wait ... you can't.  
---
&gt;Highlander cards are closer to being actually overpowered,  
---
Lol yeah all those "for 1 turn only deal 10 damage to all minions" or "duplicate your hand this turn only" is anywhere near as powerful as a 2 mana "double your battlecries", you're tripping and that is probably the stupidest shit I've ever read on this sub from someone who actually takes themselves seriouslly. :)
---
&gt;The quest itself isn't broken either. Plain and simple.  
---
Still waiting for all your non existant data on that.  I at least managed to give you a data based example. You? You've  not got shit other than baseless words.  
---
&gt;Anyways, I'm done here, I get that you don't like the quest but you're clearly letting dislike of how it plays blind you to facts. I won't be responding anymore because you're clearly not giving it actual thought.  
---
Yeah heard that before as a pretty much standard reddit cop out. 
---
 I'm sorry you were found wanting in your illogical, strawman nonsense to date and you would actually "devolve" into such a statement. ;)
---
Playing F2P since release. 
---
Saw this post, used 12k Dust to craft all Epics that was missing in classic. 
---
Still miss 12 Legendaries.
---
A big fat no.
---
WOW WHOLE 100 GOLD?
---
The currency system is so broken in this game :(
---
If only. But yeah, alot of our wonderful soup here on the Blizzard subreddits is comprised of two ingredients: shitposting, and salt. And carrots, probably. Nothing ever really goes away.

No.

Hey everyone! Get in here!

---
Build a time machine.
---
I actually crafted the last useless epic I was missing a short while before the new cards were released. Lucky to have done so that I don't need to collect those trash cards.
---
Hadababyitsaboy and it's the ONLY way I'm gonna have time to enjoy Hearthstone. BTW new Dad legend past few months, it's a great thing being able to give up that free time to something so special.
---
Too late for that.
---
Sometimes I hold onto the 80g quest for a few days, in the event that someone adds me and rages. 
---
I ask them "80g?" and they often apologize when I send the invite. I then sit on the deck selection screen and wait for them to realize.
---
Doing something decent in this world? I understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but if you want to get that point across to people you‚Äôre gonna have to come at it from a different direction. Maybe instead of shitting on something good people are doing, make a post about something they can ALSO do. Inform people who donate and care about the planet what the meat industry does and why it might be morally right to give it up. When you shit in someone‚Äôs cereal they want to fight you, not listen to what you have to say, right or wrong.
---
I think they will let us decide the outcome between the League of Explorers and the League of EVIL fight
---
Lol no
---
Unless they upgrade the client, I doubt they can add anything new to it.
---
you don't need to be vegan to decrease your own personal impact. You can lower the amount of meat you consume on a weekly basis, buy foods from farms near you/farmers markets, decrease the time of your showers, start buying more environmentally friendly products, recycle more, bring reusable bags to the grocery store, use a reusable water bottle, etc. One does not need to go full vegan to be considered environmentally conscious. It is not all or nothing, because that is unsustainable for some people
---
Yeah as a wild player I have never felt like blizzard cares about wild
---
This Blizzard x Bethesda crossover looks incredible
---
people know what the meat industry does to the planet. they dont give a shit and im not sitting here sucking their dick for donating two bucks to this
---
I never win anything.
---
I'm here praying that RNJesus will give me that sweet sweet golden ticket. It's the hearthstone way. (spoilers I don't get the ticket or draw lethal)
---
Jill never leaves your side mate
---
This. You can get a lot of good cards for a gold legendaries dust.
---
I should win because I AM THE GOL-DEN GOD. Sorry spaced out. I would like to win tho :)

---
Came to make this comment :(
---
I don‚Äôt live in Europe so I can‚Äôt request to see all the data they sold to third parties
---
I should win because I made my username when Game of Thrones was still good and then that terrible ending happened. So now I'm stuck with it. It's a terrible reason but I got nothing else.
---
Good luck
---
&gt;My first game today; probably last.
---
Didn't you hear about the Hearthstone Racing Game?
---
Golden Legendary, the card that really pumps up your average to achieve that 100 Dust per pack, drops on average once in 100 packs.
---
I think that your idea of how many packs people open is heavily skewed. Lots of players (I would wager that MAJORITY of players) don't even open 100 packs in total from a single expansion. Because in order to open that much, you need to buy at least a pre-order, and I won't believe that more people buy it than don't buy it.
---
So no, you don't always open hundreds of packs. Not even close. A realistic scenario is that someone opens 50-60 packs when the set drops, then starts saving for another one. He has most of the Commons &amp; Rares he needs, but he's missing lots of Epics &amp; Legends. Now let's talk about an even more risky scenario - he ends up with 400 gold after opening all of those packs but he really need some Epic to play a deck and has no Dust to get it. Of course, ON AVERAGE, it would be better to just open 4 packs - he might get some more cards he wants, and opening just a single "useless" Legend he can disenchant would let him craft this Epic. But go into the game and try opening 4 packs in a row. Most of your 4 packs will be at least 100-150 Dust short from the goal. Again, average vs median.
---
That person is sure to gain more by opening packs IN THE LONG TERM, but I completely disagree with your assessment that it's a bad decision to spend 400 Gold here and there and be risk-free. People aren't playing the numbers, doing everything to optimize their collection - they're playing the game to have fun. They want to play a certain, specific deck that needs a certain, specific Epic to function (I don't know, let's say Holy Wrath Paladin and Baleful Banker). If they go for pack openings, over just 4 packs, MOST OF THE TIME they would end up having to wait 2 days or so in order to play it before they can gather more Gold for packs.
---
You would be right if Hearthstone was a "card collection manager", where your only goal is to optimize your collection over a long time. But that's not how HS works. People are managing their collection poorly all the time, and the main reason to do it is to simply enjoy the game and have fun. To give you other examples -everyone should wait AT LEAST 2-3 weeks after the expansion launches before crafting stuff, but they do it day 1 in order to enjoy the game when it's most fun. Everyone should re-roll the 50g Quests no matter what they are, but most of the players finish them if they are with classes / decks they enjoy. Heck, my friends (and I) even re-roll higher gold quests if they force them to play the stuff they don't want to. Again, bad collection management, but good decision if they want to enjoy the game.

I should win because I like golden legendary cards!

They are protesting against the Blizzard executives.

"Good game, although I tried to get you to concede, but you did great, man."

Glad to help.

I should win because I hit dad legend with warlock when it's Shamanstone. (wait.that'sillegal.jpg)

I can be youre friend(.
---
They made adventures cost money. I'm waiting for tavern brawls to cost money now.
---
Random selections are amazing
---
So it's entirely the consumers responsibility to enact change? 
---
What if we could come up with less damaging ways of farming livestock, rather than expect people to turn vegetarian or vegan? I believe that's achievable, and large movements like this could put pressure on organisations to enact meaningful change.
---
Once I've set off the nzoth + shadow step + scheme I have yet to lose, and I hate myself for playing this deck. I can't imagine how good it must have felt to hit that rogue in her stupid face.

---
Corrupt the Waters is a good card that sees play in standard and wild. Go for it.
---
They ran away due to the bugs all over the place.
---
Shaman has 2-3 decks at Tier One, including the only Tier One decks at Legend, and comprise 30-35% of ladder.
---
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve had that level of dominance since Druid had Aggro Druid and Jade Druid.
---
No need, I always had the two other slots open and the spectate quest is a highroll (1 pack = 100g).
---
People have gotten Legend with worse restrictions.
---
yeah, but that's for like 30-50000 people that know about the twitch, as opposed to all the players that got rewards at log in last year.
---
I completely disagree with your statement about AK47, aviana, and psychmelon. The fact that psychmelon has seen no competitive play since, where‚Äôs aviana has seen play before psychmelon shows how ubiquitous it was when paired with Kun. You could pair any number of Combo cards you wanted with the duo and it made it into a deck. This nerfed hit the correct cards, and it shows because if psychmelon was truly ‚Äúsprint that tutors‚Äù, it would see play
---
The yellow color crystal for next expansion does seem to be the "Spark of Tyr." Try is one of the ancient Titans who recruited Malygos and other dragon aspects to defeat Galakrond
---
The issue with Evolve isn't its randomness. It's how much on average it raises the value of the cards its used on.
---
Evolve turns a single minion worth three mana (Desert Hare) into three minions that are on average 4/4s. That's the issue. Too much gain for too little cost.
---
The Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron is, if anything, a minor issue in the grand scheme of things.
---
Lastly, you're playing a card game. Variance and randomness is *built in* to the genre. Especially when it comes to best of one games, skill is really only seen over the course of many games.
---
Rogue quest wouldn't be anywhere near the top.
---
When you post something as worthless as who cares, you are a dick head.

How do you know he dies if you had your eyes closed? If you open them, of course he might die
---
I should win because I've never really had the chance or money to get one, would be interesting to see all the panels, especially for WoW and for whatever new stuff gets announced (OW 2 sounds interesting)
---
I would like to win a virtual ticket, but I feel like all the live streaming and stuff should be free. I don't feel Blizzard deserves $50 just for a few cosmetics, many of which are for games I don't play, in addition to just being able to view their event.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who disliked Frozen Throne. I‚Äôll be glad if we never see a hero card again, especially not one that produces minions infinitely.

I thought it said "LIKE SWEATY INCEST"

This is not fully true, a site like Pokerstars allows you to add a certain currency and switch the currency around with the current exchange rate. Why not allow an user to convert these 60euro's to 50pounds?

When you waste your time with a response to an obvious troll in a half day old thread, I have advice for you. Get a hobby dude, this clearly isn‚Äôt worth anyone‚Äôs time. The only reason I started this was out of boredom

/u/Fordfff has almost exclusively whined about anyone criticizing Blizzard and the companies practices (with regards to Hong Kong as well as other topics) for the entire 2 year lifespan of his account. A true shill if I've ever seen one. Among his most common twenty words are: fuck, hong, kong, china, shit, and post. He even has a Huawei phone! Here's a brief sampler of his genius in action:

&gt;You need to get laid more dude (-2)

&gt;Probably need to get laid as well (-1)

&gt;You need to get laid more (-42)

That blizzard leak from a few days ago suggested that hearthstone underwent a precipitous drop in playership, more than any previous blizzard game. Makes me wonder if they are just using Blizzcon to hype D4 and OW2, which will not go over well.
---
&gt;Ng, a Hong Kong native, recently circulated in news cycles both within and outside of esports for his statements in support of the region‚Äôs protests and his subsequent 6-month suspension by Activision Blizzard as a result. Due to the ruling, blitzchung cannot compete in official Blizzard professional events, so his addition to Tempo Storm provides support at a critical time to a prolific player. The signing speaks to Tempo Storm‚Äôs unwavering commitment and advocacy for players and content creators. During his period of ineligibility in official Hearthstone events, he expects to increase his streaming presence and will continue to train and represent the brand abroad.
---
Not like they're trying to hide it.
---
The randomness in those games is the other player. In the case where you have two professionals playing, they‚Äôre not actually fun until they get off book.
---
So it's ok to make families starve as long as you make profit? Yeah, it's not the same but it's usually hand in hand,, like the superb bonus the CEO took home that could feed a small country.

And btw, Amazon has being doing extremely well for a really freaking long time now. What is next? Coca Cola is on the verge of being bankrupt according to you?

Bwahahahahaha  I've seen some low quality reply in my time but this takes the cake.

Yeah you caught me I love China. I love North Korea even more. And I sleep with my Stalin pillow.

Time to Hop over to bazaar i guess

I want to see diablo 4.

Aren't we getting an early legendary like the time they gave us Marin the Fox?
---
Yes. Take it to the bank.

Highlander Hunter has a few alternatives right now. What you are running is a mishmash between mid-range highland and secret highland which doesn't quite gel in objectives. 
---
\- Highland Mid-Range (Runs low cost beast/mechs instead of secrets)
---
\- Highland Secrets (Runs secret package topped at Hyena Alpha and Subject 9) 
---
\- Highland Malygos (Runs Jepeto/Malygos along with low cost direct damage) 
---
See all 3 archetypes here with common decklist.  [https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;gameType=RANKED\_STANDARD&amp;archetypes=321%2C330%2C329](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;gameType=RANKED_STANDARD&amp;archetypes=321%2C330%2C329)
---
Malygos works best vs N'zoth taunt decks as it shoots pass the wall. Mid-Range tries to burn slower opponents with Leeroy, Zephyrs or Brann before T10, while Secret package controls the board state vs most decks. 
---
I myself am running a Malygos variant - Dropping Zul'Jin and CotW in favor of more secrets. Meta is just too aggressive where I am to warrant the extra value. Either I get killed before Malygos, or I pull off an Emperor /Jepeto to win the game.
---
Said the two year old account with -16 comment karma.
---
Its relevant because it gives Blizzard zero credibility. You want politics out of blizzard games? It's too late, when Blizzard participated in the pride events they brought politics into their games. 
---
Now they are choosing to say "no politics in games" because it suites their bottom line. 
---
They would appease a government that murders and oppresses its  citizens rather than take a hit on its profits.

Divine shield was never a problem (except when [[giggling inventor ]] was 5 mana)

And if it ever will we have [[blood knight]]

i should win because im not even going to watch just get the legendary. Wont even take bandwith.
---
I have benen playing since beta, stuck with the game through the bad times (undertaker meta), and still to this day enjoy playing the game
---
I support Hong Kong democracy.
---
I feel bad for this poor gnome :c
---
My mistake I should have included that they didn‚Äôt report those numbers as far as I‚Äôm aware
---
Exactly which part are people complaining about in your eyes?    I don't see almost anyone saying they shouldn't have brought any cards back, it's usually a specific complaint against a specific mechanic.
---
Hey so this is a relevant place to put this:
---
For over a year, I haven't been able to add anyone - if I try, my client crashes. And similarly, noone is able to add me (it says friend request sent, but nothing comes through). I have 90 people on my friends list and no pending requests. Has anyone else experienced this?
---
&gt;, and ending at the absolute king of highroll the shaman who basically RNG's whole game.  
---
Sorry but for all the complaints against shaman how it RNGing through the whole game?  Which shaman deck?
---
TRUE LULW
---
The complaint isn't that new cards were added, it's that the new cards that were added... 
---
1) Made one of the strongest classes even stronger
---
2) Introduced the possibility of a very strong, often time game winning, play on Turn 4.
---
We are excited for new cards, but when they warp the meta this much it makes it much less fun.
---
E TU KEKW E TU KEKW
---
Except viewership is on the decline so if that's their goal they are failing miserably.  
---
I wouldn't want to watch matches out of this meta as it's no different to what I see every game I play.  
---
Skill factor is VERY low right now so far less "wow what an absolute genius play" - it's just same shit, different day.
---
E TU KEKW
---
Those are great counter arguments and I can‚Äôt say I disagree too much with any of them.
---
It is a public traded company. Every public traded company is be obligated to report revenue and   
---
net income quarterly. 
---
You can not just say to your shareholders. "We do great don't worry!!"
---
If a $60 paywall to new players along with still needing to open cards from various sets is the ‚Äúvalue of this once great game,‚Äù then I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs broken away from that.
---
Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
As I eluded to in another reply.  
---
I don't think having viewership as a goal has anything at all to do with why Blizzard would or would not increase RNG to the game.  
---
Viewership would be a side thought.
---
&gt;no i fucking wouldn't have issue with it then? 
---
No. You would.
---
You're mad at the average result of a Desert Hare into Evolve being three 4/4s or 3/5s on turn three, not that once in a while, the Shaman will get a Bone Wraith or REstless Mummy.
---
&gt;your opponent rolls tirion lategame because reasons, dont write bullshit like this its so sickening.
---
Yeah. That sort of thing is annoying, but that Mogu Fleshshaper turning into pretty much any of the good eight drops would be equally annoying.
---
If anything, you just sound like you need a break after losing a couple too many games.
---
The economy of MTGA isn't that bad IF you are okay with your cards turning into ashes every rotation.  The lack of a real, supported eternal format hinders me from wanting to invest money into it, but you can get ~all the cards by drafting (like HS Arena mode) 30 times or so.
---
I was incorrect in assuming they didn‚Äôt report those numbers. I updated my comment. Thanks for the clarification and additional info.
---
I would like to win a virtual ticket because, as a resident of Louisiana and father of three young children, attending BlizzCon in person is a virtual impossibility for me. I‚Äôve been playing Blizzard games As long as I‚Äôve been a gamer, but my favorite by far is Rock n‚Äô Roll Racing. Hearthstone comes in at a close second.ÔøºÔøºÔøº
---
The rng isn't the problem with quest shaman though.  
---
It's the Hare itself for the evolve part - 3 x 4 mana value for 4 mana?  That's not RNG that's just a plain mana cheating issue.    
---
The quest itself doubles the value of battle cries when complete.  Again not RNG but mana cheating of a sort.  
---
As for lackeys well I'd argue they are a large part of the problem in the game right now as it gives quest shaman a really strong platform to tick over their quest and not suffer as badly in the early game as they would if we didn't have lackeys.
---
You mean $20, right? And it was 2800 gold if you didn't mind paying that way. It was only $60 in your bizarre imagination.
---
When have they confirmed otherwise?
---
Granted, all card games are many things to many people and outright turning off a more competitive focused side of the audience isn't going to make the game any better.
---
This pretty much confirms what I've seen in my admittedly limited time on the total wasteland that is ladder. Also, queue times seem to be up significantly, which says I'm not the only one who hates ladder right now. Given the toxic state of the game, I'm not inclined to spend time outside of single player or the occasional Tavern Brawl.
---
Might actually be a good thing?  Maybe they're announcing something at Blizzcon that'll go live immediately.
---
You are laughably wrong about currency conversion. It is baffling that you are acting so confident about this when you are so wrong and are clearly talking out of your ass.
---
Currency exchange is the most liquid market in the entire world with over 5 trillion dollars changing hands every single day. It is so incredibly liquid and easy to move money between 2 currencies, more so if you are a large company like activision blizzard.
---
I always thought Lord Godfrey says "This will be a massacre!" instead of "This will be a mercy killing!"
---
Presumably, The Bazaar won't come out in china :o)
---
Why did you remove priest and warrior?
---
I can't imagine their bosses are particularly interested in allocating dev budget for anything that doesn't clearly increase their profits, unfortunately.
---
My mistake. I thought these numbers were kept internal, but yeah like you said these numbers are necessary to be made public.
---
I would suggest you to use my strategy. Im f2p, skipped one expansion long time ago. I have \~7000 gold now, which i spend at start of every expansion and save up untill next. Usually i gather around 8500 which results in 90+ packs since there are always some free. You can run few arenas instead of spending all money on packs instantly since meta doesnt settle for 2 weeks or so after new cards. 
---
I also dust all cards that leave standard format. If you do all these things and keep high enough self control not to rush craft random legendaries you can pretty much netdeck everything needed for decent ranked position.
---
I dont want to win.
---
*Gotcha, Bitch!*

6 mana 10/30

Each turn this minion is in your hand, it loses 3 life.
---
Battlecry: This minion loses 1 life for each enemy minion on the field, each card in your opponent's hand, and each card in your opponent's deck.
---
No, I mean $60, because assuming old adventures weren‚Äôt discontinued, there would be 3 of them in standard at any given time, meaning that you can‚Äôt even make budget decks since you can‚Äôt access the cards in the adventures without paying for them.
---
Imagine Odd Paladin actually playing equality.
---
It is absolutely not how every digital currency in the world works and they basically can convert currency with the snap of their fingers.
---
It seems like the only experience some people in this thread have with converting currency is trying to change your money in an airport after you come back from vacation.
---
Oh I agree that viewership is almost certainly not a metric they care about, my point is that declining viewership proves little if anything about the design direction of the game.
---
Looks like a yellow orb. The same orbs monk used to shit out with mastery.
---
You know that's stuck on your skin forever (ok you could get it removed I guess) right?  
---
Supporting Blitzchung who himself isn't boycotting blizzard or HS and has just signed with tempostorm?  What is there to support now?
---
&gt;Remember what Blitzchung stood up for. He risked years of work and sacrifice to utter one sentence.  
---
And now where is he?  "Oh they halves my punishment, I'll be quiet now".  Hardly the hero HK needs.  
---
At this stage it almost feels like a publicity stunt than a guy truly standing up for a cause he believes in.

Blizzard earned 384M in the three months leading up to June 30 2019 whereas they had earned 489M in the three months leading up to June 30 2018.
---
Q2 2019 vs. Q2 2018 they wrote: The decrease in Blizzard‚Äôs net revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2018, was primarily due to: (one reason) lower revenues from Hearthstone, primarily driven by lower revenues from the Rise of Shadows expansion, which was released in April 2019, as compared to The Witchwood‚Ñ¢ expansion, which was released in April 2018
