And if there 3 particularly bad minions, just reroll before buying. At worst you get a 2/2, which isnt good but for other heroes a 2/2 might be the best option.

15 min of video of what can be said within 30 sec nvm thats the content youtube wants
---
This 100%. I've played a few games where I'm able to get ice block the turn after triggering ice block. Unless there's some sort of invisible limit in place, you could hypothetically RNG your way to first place by rolling back to back to back ice blocks
---
&gt;What I'm trying to say - blizzard - don't give up on trying to keep the game fresh. The fressher the better.
---

---
If all they can offer is breaking the game (Buff Patch AND Wild Event) without any hope of reverting those changed, no thanks. They can keep their events and not keep ruining things
---
“I know, right? that’s a pretty fucked up ‘ooh la la’”
---
So hard to do gold quest right now, because I just rage concede when they hare mogu evolve on T4
---
So it really is a completely different card than glimmerroot.
---
Glimmerroot had a very high success rate because the two incorrect cards were usually very obvious, so it was more like a 3/3 "take a random card from your opponent's deck".
---
Since all three of Envoy's cards are part of the opponent's deck this makes the success rate of the card far less.  However, the trade-off is you are seeing three cards in your opponent's deck and getting a clearer picture of what it is.
---
Overall, I still see envoy being a weaker card than glimmerroot and far from an auto-include.  The main problem is knowing your opponent's deck doesn't matter if it's just a meta deck, which will almost always be the case a few weeks after launch.  As a result, the importance of gaining the extra card is valued higher than knowing what's in your opponent's deck - and it's much harder to guarantee the correct card with envoy.
---
Depends on the minion. Toxfin + Shudder is useless, Toxfin + Shadowstep is really strong. I‘m pretty sure there are example for the other way too.
---
I mean do we call the other auto battlers card games as well then because there is a square that shows up with a level and a unit name on it?
---
I never played the normal mode so I didnt know that lol nais thanks a lot!
---
Taken from his YouTube viewers with the channel not having any arena gameplay. It's like surveying whether people prefer pasta or sushi in an Italian restaurant.
---
But even he focuses on battlegrounds now
---
Yeah because the game was real fast. And nost rounds had10 dmg at least.
---
you’re definitely right. i was just referring to the sample size
---
yea - what is it that you like about a card game? Well, quite simple: you like to have just a slight edge against your opponents - because experience, skill. Wait: Hearthsone: Naaaaaaaaahhhh.... :)
---
I agree, amalgam is pretty fuckn gay rn.
---
Guessing right is even stronger when it works this way.  If you're right, you get a card in your hand, know a card in their hand, AND you know 2 cards they do NOT have in their hand.  Guessing wrong still has benefit as you know 1 card they do NOT have in their hand AND you know they have 1 of 2 cards in their hand.  It will also tell give you enough information to determine what deck they are playing almost every time in metas where classes have more than 1 meta deck.
---
well i tried it and went 14-1 in a session. played it till i lost once. seems bonkers to me that a deck with little to none decision making can be so good.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong please. But in my experience ice block is never offered after the turn it was offered in the first time. So you would need at least one turn in between two ice block turns.
---
Was literally just trying to get answers as to why I gained no ranking but ok
---
It is for sure, in HSreplay you can scroll down and see the top 10 cards played in the last 5 minutes and how many were played. This gives you somewhat of a gauge on player numbers. Comparing wild to arena the numbers are way closer than 13:3
---
Christ, just forget about it and move on.
---
This card is insanely better than Glimmer Root.  You should re-evaluate why you think it's bad.
---
So, the hero power gave me two khadgars really early in the game and I bought every murloc tidehunter for fusioning three 1/1 and getting free cards. When I leveled the tabern at 5, it was just a free win because fusioning 6 costs gives you another 6 cost card. I oneshot the first player.
---
In what world is a 2 mana 2/2 get a card one third of the time great? You think the information is worth the investment of a bad card?
---
Oh makes sense my bad
---
IN THE LAST VIDEO, HE LITERALLY PRAISED BLIZZARD FOR GIVING PACKS AND MORE GOLD ARE YOU KIDDING ME
---
I drink dumb bitch juice every morning so Daryl is too hard for my puny pea brain. I never pick him unless it's him vs Pyramad or something (please remove Pyramad i'm begging you blizzard)
---
That's when they hit you with blizzard.
---
They don’t want to change any of the cards that are cards in the rest of hearthstone. Not in stats and effect. 
---
They said they’re going to replace the amalgam with a card that’s basically the same thing but as a 2/2.
---
Most of the time I just survive until I find these minions. Every turn in the earlygame you must do anything to make your board stronger - do not look for good minions, replace your weakest minions with better ones you find in the shop and buff your board. A good time to start rolling a lot - 10 gold.
---
u/Chris_Attalus
---
I love ur vids. Shame that these people keep downvoting your stuff. Keep doing what you're doing!
---
There is a turn limit
---
he didnt said weak cards, he said meta-defining cards... Ragnaros, Windrunner, lightbomb, these are good cards, but not nescessarily meta defining, like Nzoth for exemple... they could bring back litch king, that charge legendary murlock, yogg... these are good cards, not evolve neither nzoth
---
Arena is bugged on mobile, making me mostly stop playing altogether. Many Arena players likely feel the same. Losing ten percent of Arena games from disconnects means that a huge chunk of your losses will be these games.
---
At a minimum, you will find out one card that's not in their hand. In some matchups that's huge.
---
Overgrown Dragon is awful design, it's just a 4 mana 6/7 at WORST. Really don't get what the point of this card is even if they just worted it wrong and it's not meant to work like that.
---
Also I see a lot of people either hyping up or complaining about Tomb Guard but that card would never see play at all, who the fuck would put a 7 mana 7/7 in their deck for just that effect? It's so situational and can still be dealt with first. This card would just be pack filler, doesn't deserve the hype at all, doesn't deserve the fear. It's just unplayable in reality, actually think about it for a moment.
---
I think the problem with Arena is that it is a huge time commitment. Either you spend a couple hours doing the whole thing in one sitting, or you do it over the course of a few days.
---
All the other modes are things you can just do if you are bored/have a few minutes.
---
Hahahaha oh my god that's so bad.
---
I’m been designing cards on this thread for a couples years, and I’ve gone ahead and created a separate thread for Hearthstone Battlegrounds cards with the hopes of it becoming an amazing thread like this one day. Please check it out and post your custom cards in there as well, I’ll be growing it everyday, so just joining is much appreciated: r/customHSBattlegrounds
---
Depending on how leaned-in on demons you're on, selling the 42/42 might be the play. Like for all we know you have a Brann and Soul Juggler off-screen and this is the optimal play.
---
How is it not a card game? Not every card game has to be like "each player draws a card from their personal deck each turn" you know.
---
You're likely going to know most of what's in meta decks a few weeks after launch, so the picks are probably not a surprise.
---
If it's turn 5 and you top-deck this the choice of which card is in their hand is a toss-up.
---
This card is far harder to guess correctly than Glimmerroot and probably will be cut first from new priest decks as a result.  It's not a bad card, but it's inconsistent and not impactful enough to support a win condition.
---
So what does this doe over /r/customhearthstone? Because right now it just feels like a knock-off of there.

Thanks.  I really do need to get a feel for cards I enjoy playing.  Just a bit complicated cause I don't understand everything atm.  Seems I might have to dust some cards I never use as it is hard to get.
---
What Paladin Secret can not proc in combat?
---
Speculation is that it's because it's annoying (or requires effort) constantly balancing the buckets so that classes aren't completely unbalanced.    
---
With every set/rotation, you would see many cards completely misbucketed and players would complain until adjusted, which was rarely reported by the Devs. Removing buckets removes that issue and leaves classes completely unbalanced and allows Devs to focus on the important things, such as selling expansions and tweaking the new game mode.   
---
tl;dr: Arena was abandoned, just like Wild.
---
If you're getting smashed by your opponent when you have an exceptional lead then you must be doing something wrong. The only way for your opponent to come back in that scenario is if you completely played into their hands.
---
You said it's hard for you to get a feel for the strategy but without specific context on why you are losing it's hard to give you advice on that front.
---
Barrel Rider!
---
I've been having nothing but top 1 finishes with George, that HP is so good late game when you know what you need, but that's just me.
---
He would if you wanted to play jarraxus
---
Wow, I was about to type something like ‚git gud‘ but your """advice""" seems to be soo much more helpfull!
---
Tbh. I never liked Arena.
---
Seems like I played into their hand.  Against a priest, he had 3 health and one minion on the board.  A minion with only 3 attack but a large health pool.  I had 5 minions on the board.  But he doubled the units health twice and then made the attack equal to its health.  Had 40 something attack.  Boom, dead.
---
Try not viewing having more health as “winning.” You either win or lose, it doesn’t matter how much more health you had at one point. Not every deck plays in a way where they avoid taking damage or try building a dominant board.
---
OK, so they're all marginally interesting ideas, but spamming a new post every ten minutes really doesn't work for the karma farming.
---
Is this for adventure? I'd really like to see this. Do I just beat that specific wing backwards, or the whole thing? I can't seem to get it to proc :/
---
I know that all days merge when you're unemployed and live in the basement, so I'll remind you that it's currently weekend.
---
I kind of like the idea where divine shield is (mostly) restricted to mechs.
---
Sonya is absolutely ridiculous in its presented iteration. Consider the following: I can search for the best few buff cards. I can keep replaying the best buff card I have access to each turn. This is the same sort of mechanic that makes amalgam so good- the ability to stay on board and get better. But the buffs could apply to any minions so it is not even important that the minions buffed be amalgams per say. And like others have pointed out this problem "doubles" (or triples) with Bran. Giving your board buffs that are larger than what light fang does and more consistently really seems broken.
---
Shaw looks good and seems like it gets great in the late game but not game winning. If anything its too weak but obviously the play style is cleave and I'm not sure how greatly that will impact choices and positioning. I assume this hero is good in the late game though; cleave wants to go first.
---
Edwin's also probably needs a Nerf. Eve if leveling up tavern isn't the greatest thing that can be done from turns 1-6 or so the potential to do that seems high. Also token generators are -1 gold not accounting for tempo loss. I thought about ways to make a nerf but I couldn't come up with anything, maybe someone else will.
---
Make a photo album. Please.

It's also a song!

last thing this modes needs is another tool to make hydra stronger.

Because it is fun, and I dont have to spend hundreds of dollars to be better than everyone else. This is why I quit after frozen throne. I was tired of buying like 40 packs and getting trash

You could argue of making it even higher since Cave Hydra exists. Cleave + poison sounds absolutely cancerous.

---
Scarlet Drake - It is definitely strong and very efficient but it won't be around for long enough that everyone will start getting sick of it. It's obviously a reference to Azure Drake and I think it's a similar power level. Just like how Azure Drake would be fine if it was around for a year I think Scarlet Drake is the same situation.  
---
Mossbed Strangler - It's pretty tame. for 6 Mana you'd expect a 3/7 Lifesteal Taunt, this being a 3/6 and dealing 1 damage is pretty much the same.  
---
BFB - A 4/12 Lifesteal Taunt Dragon for 10 Mana might be a bit much. But Obsidian Statue wasn't a good card to play, it was **only** good because of ressurection effects. That said BFB is pretty spooky in Priest but without cards like **Shadow Essence** and **Barnes** it should be fine.  
---
King of Sparks - The King is a good 1 drop, but it's very reliant on chance and only has 2 health itself, I think it's fine.  
---
Forgotten Arcanist - I'm fine with Arcanist hitting any amount of cards. If a 4 Mana 3/5 was printed that said "Battlecry: Reduce the cost of two random cards in your hand by (1)." it wouldn't rule the meta. I think it's fine as is and it not being used to its full potential is alright.  
---
Recursive Drake - This guy is pretty much Cairne for 1 less mana if you discard a Dragon. I do agree it gets scary in power level after the second Recursive Drake appears. It needs testing.  
---
Shepherd of Spirits - It's an alternate to Gadgetzan, 1 more Mana for +1/+3 in exchange for working with strictly 0 cost cards. Even if it's never used it deserves to exist to open up that possibility.  
---
Khadgar the Vigilant - He could be a bit bigger but I also think he's fine as is. This keeps his stat line from RoS as well. A free treant whenever you cast a big spell isn't all that negligible either. He's on the weaker side but perfectly playable in my point of view.  
---
Forgotten Fruit - Druids have had 1 Mana deal 2 before and healing their minions and self is something we've seen many times before. I think it's fine.  
---
Waling Shot - Wailing Shot was made to be run outside of C'thun decks. It's great with C'thun but is also there to support burn in Hunter.  
---
Dread Ogre - I agree.  
---
Booky Babbler - Mages have cared the least for 1 1/3s with the only one they've used being Mana Wyrm. Her Battlecry is a lot harder to trigger than you think. I would agree with you that she may be too powerful if Babbling Book hadn't come back to Standard. After seeing the Book not be played for Doom in the Tomb I don't fear Booky Babbler.  
---
Blessing of Resilience - I agree that it's not very strong most of the time, buffs are mainly used for immediate damage and the Blessing only gives you +1/+1 up front. I actually don't want it to be solid for trading funnily enough, that kinda defeats the purpose in my opinion. I might consider it giving +1/+2 up front and then +2/+1 the next turn.  
---
Ancient Judicator - I agree with you, I think it gets really spooky with G'huun especially. It's a pushed card.  
---
Incorporeal Colossus - I don't think it's bad design. A 5 cost minion with Evasion should be a 5/5 or 4/6. The Colossus is a 4/7 and a Dragon. It's overstatted and has a good minion type for Priest. I have no qualms whatsoever with the Priest not being able to target it with their HP.  
---
Mindweaver - The rounding up and down is a fair criticism. However, you will be told if you can target a minion with it or not and the general assumption is that effects like that will **always** benefit the player. Besides that C'thun typically grows in +2/+2 increments anyways and it's a very rare case that you won't get an even number to work with.  
---
Kriziki - Mindblast is only a thing in wild. Although I agree it's risky Wild has worse things they deal with. He'd need testing.  
---
Maddening Ooze - I was scared Maddening Ooze would be too efficient especially for Rogue. I think it could be a very interesting tool but it might be a bit much at 3.  
---
EVIL Pillaging - It's just a bigger Fan of Knives. I don't think it's out of flavor at all really, it's only 1 damage which Rogue has had before and it adds Lackeys to your hand. It's a nice solid Lackey generator with the bonus of pinging your enemies. 3 Lackeys is a lot.  
---
Visceral Elemental - Visceral is being pushed super hard. Mainly for G'huun Shaman but like you mentioned it's just great with tokens in general. I think it'd need a ton of testing and could maybe do with -1 Health.  
---
Swamp Claw - I think it's too specific to be played outside of Big Shaman, a 3/3 weapon that eventually summons 3 1/1s for 3 Mana and 2 Overload isn't worth it in my opinion if you aren't getting premier 1/1s.  
---
Revan - I changed Revan to a 3/2 last second from a 4/2, I'll change him back. However, a 6 7/6 Charge is an insane minion which shouldn't be printed. I may agree that Revan is too weak as a 3/2, but I won't budge any further than making him a 4/2.  
---
Swurgl - Swurgl isn't meant to be played in a Murloc deck, he was and still is designed for Control Shaman. The Murloc effect is just to encourage creative players to experiment.  
---
EVIL Restaffing - \[\[Lock and Load\]\] and \[\[Stampede\]\] exist, cards like this only need to be a cantrip if they don't generate value or only work if your opponent does something.  
---
Blood to Iron - Blood to Iron is pretty bad when you don't get the armor and needs to combo with something else if you do get the armor and still want to clear. It should be fine but is exceptionally strong.  
---
Carapace Crusher - Quest Warrior needs some help and no other Warrior deck creates enough Lackeys to really use it. I think it's fine in and out of Quest Warrior.  
---
Enigmatic Machination - It's 5 Mana do nothing when you play it, I'm cool with whatever degenerate combos people make with it especially since Boomsday rotates out. Mechs will still be printed and if this set was released Mechs would be printed with Machination in mind. It also always works with C'BOOM! (which will be receiving a buff)  
---
C'BOOM! - This bad boy will be buffed to give you 0 Cost Lackeys.
---
Divine Shield Mama Bear and Hydra? No thanks.

---
A raid in World of Warcraft. Nefarion is the end boss
---
Thought this card would make a cool addition to battlegrounds.
---
You gonna psot the whole ahearthstone Collection here?
---
Oh right, how could I forget only competitive top legend players frequent Reddit.
---
Oh lord TIL...  though I have been on holiday for 2 weeks so I couldn't play, I just learned the card pool is shared and there is a limited amount of minions distributed.   
---
This explains my bad luck (which was not bad luck at all it seems.)
---
I see. Thats's a dumb interaction but at least I understand XD
---
If you pick wrong you know that 1 of 2 cards are in their hand (which is meaningless in many meta decks these days as you just assume they have overpowered card X that you can't do anything about anyway) and the other is in the deck - you don't know which, it's 50/50.  
---
This only changes if it would be a card they'd played both copies of then you could 100% know from the card you got wrong (which wouldn't be the card they played both copies of unless you were an idiot) which card is in hand.  
---
At 2/2 this is a pretty bad card really, I'd be surprised to see it used outside of arena.
---
BFB - I beg to differ. Obsidian Statue came down and changed games just like that. They're also both really good with cheat effects.
---
Shephard of Spirits - Gadgetzan's statline just doesn't matter much anyways, because it practically always dies from hard removal if not from minion pressure. This would maybe make more sense if there was more than 1 0 cost card in this set.
---
Kriziki- I actually didn't know Mind Blast was wild. I just thought it hadn't been meta. I must've forgotten when it rotated. Yeah, it's cool. 
---
EVIL Pillaging - my problem is just that I don't understand what deck would want this card. Tempo doesn't want to spend a whole turn lightly damaging their enemies and getting some 1/1s into their hand.
---
Swamp Claw - you could definitely work it into an aggro deck, and especially run cards like Al'Akir to make it work. We saw it with Corpsetaker. People are definitely willing to run weird cards to make cards like this crazy good, and you wouldn't need to run that many because it can keep hitting the same minion.
---
Revan - I agree a 6 mana 7/6 is insane, but its insanely conditional that you get to play it as such. He's effectively a dead card until really late game, and lacks the OOMPH that other late game bomb cards tend to have.
---
EVIL Restaffing - Yeah, I guess it's fine. I just really dislike this kind of design, but it's more of a pet peeve then a flaw in this case.
---
Carapace Crusher - I guess it's balanced by the fact Warrior Lackeys basically don't exist, yeah. I'm just worried that with an attack boost or two it might become frightening.
---
I agree/no comment on anything I didn't put here
---
To be honest everything is auto lose vs that, especially when they all have 70hp
---
Yeah, a higher MMR is much more of a reward to me than more gold or a pack.
---
I was not criticising you posting your fun deck on reddit?
---
Actually it slowly starts getting boring. It's all about a handfull of cards. With Demons you go for the Wrath Weaver, Mal'Ganis and this Battlemaster. With Murlocs you go for Tidecaller and Warleader. And so on, and so on 
---
And all heroes are going for the Amalgam.
---
Blizzard is playing around with the Heroes and trying to get a good balance, but they are doing nothing about the OP minions 🤷‍♂️
---
I doubt it. I don't think they've ever released a free feature only to later gate it behind an entry fee, for any feature in any of their games.
---
You did it, you saved wild

---
Stop conceding. If you haven’t been conceding, find a new game.
---
A supposed mathematician should know better than to draw conclusions like this
---
This.  Each chapter needs to be defeated with all decks and powers.  Since there’s more decks than powers, you have to beat each chapter at least 4 times (while doing the 3 powers in that set of 4).
---
Giving your opponents easy wins is not bannable. HS isn't a team game so there isn't any expectation from the devs for you to actually try.
---
Might as well throw in totem golem if that's your baseline for 2 drop power.
---
BFB - It's hard to cheat out in Standard and shouldn't be a problem with Wild.  
---
Shepherd - I see what you're saying but also propose that they serve slightly different purposes. Shepherd can often sit around for a turn allowing you to potentially draw off of him longer than with Gadgetzan. He's not very strong but I think that's fine and he's a great building block for future cards.  
---
EVIL Pillaging - Lackeys are much more powerful than 1/1s and Rogues can use them better than anyone else. I think it's fine that tempo won't run it, a bit slower Lackey/Shark/Thief Rogue could make good use of it.  
---
Swamp Claw - I think you mean midrange deck, those were the ones with the big minions and Corpse Takers like Even Shaman. It's a strong card and I'd be interested in seeing how it would play out. One last thing is that many aggro and midrange decks run a lot of minions without valuable keywords and effects, usually a bunch of Battlecries. I think it needs to be looked at very closely but the thought of people making a weird card work for them because of its sheer potential is tantalizing.  
---
Revan - I'll move him to 4 Attack.  
---
Send me your Blizzard ID and we could do a couple matches.
---
I was wondering if Blizz would see this something like "lowering the enjoyment of players who would like to win the game by playing against a trying opponent rather than an afk one".
---
who's battlecries
---
I think “huge is overstating it a little.
---
I would play more arena if there wasn't no cost to play, but then the rewards would have to not be as good or not exist. Battlegrounds is ridiculously fun though, easy to pick up and play. Rather then drafting a whole deck, you play and draft your board. It's dope.
---
Demons and Murlocs are inferior to Beasts and Mechs. Demons and Murlocs also have far fewer minions than Beasts and Mechs. It's not a coincidence.
---
You can say the exact same thing about Hearthstone in general.
---
The fun fact is that I have never faced a N'Zoth Rogue since wild cards were brought back to standard. And yet I played about 300 games for these 2 months.
---
1. Nerfing Amalgam to 2 will make it very risky to pick up early. It will definitely have an impact. You can't remove it, as it's an integral part of the gameplay. If you don't have a minion you can invest in, you're left with very few viable strategies.
---
2. Mechs are a mid game strat, not a late game one. While it's true that Magnetic minions are strong, there are very few mech buffs available otherwise, not to mention it's the main flavour of the tribe. You would make mechs incredibly dull and incredibly bad.
---
3. No, there are already too few options to deal damage. Just remove the random Toxfin from Mounted Raptor and it's a pretty good system.
---
Okay, I definitely gave of the wrong impression.
---
One, I did too and still get what I think are nimrod and two (more importantly) it appears I didnt get my idea across. Let me edit real quick.
---
You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

---
Hearthstone BWL, not WoW BWL
---
Yeah, it's kind of a funny game design. Some tribes just have more cards than others. I think mech has the most cards. Demons and Murlocs have way fewer.
---
and the wild card ake it even more stale
---
I don't think the units knock down turrets, or flash or farm lane minions or have a map with a fog of war and a positional strategic control of the vision of that map. The latter of which is responsible for a huge part of the tactical nuance and identity of a MOBA. 
---
You're completely trying to ignore that there existed literal physical card games you could actually buy that are basically auto battlers that existed before Dota auto chess. It wasn't chess, but it they are very much so like this line up your monsters/ minions in a line and Duke it out round by round.

I would have bought 2 wolves, freeze, upgrade the tavern next turn and take the third wolve for a save T4 Minion this early.
---
Also should mention that tier 4 is a priority tavern tier to get to because you get another minion slot
---
If all the cards are taken the percentage is 0. If you have two copies the odds are much lower than your posted numbers.

If you play on iOS and try to refresh the tavern as the time runs out it crashes for you so you get the extra time... if you can reconnect.
---
The idea being to use the +3/+3 handbuff from the anub to give access to 1 mana 7 health minions, so you can Star Alligner from hand easily. I didn't realize until testing that Anub buffing Star Allinger means you need an additional 7 health guy :(
---
This is at best an early game card that you sell 3 rounds later cause you need the slot.
---
Rats...
---
The other guy did have a fair bit of divine shield and two poisonous but luckily still managed the win.
---
Well done, I've only taken 1st with no health loss twice and both times it was with Yogg.
---
Got a Shifter Zerus with my passive, and it transformed into Mama Bear. The other 3 I got lucky with my duplicates.

Happy cake day and yeah but nah it couldn't be

Completely right, any buffs like Overseer or lightfang make the number the overflow number -1 the maximum.
---
It's really comparable to spawn of n'zoth. Nice pickup in early/mid but falls off quick.

I believe 710 is the highest number you can achieve, this is insane too.
---
That's not the point. I know that Mechs are very strong atm, but the effect is inconsistent nonetheless. It should give 2/2s like Rat Pack
---
So did you lifedrink him or did he lifedrink you?
---
Eu DolBlathanna#2591 I show you go first :)
---
Spawn doesn't give tripled minions +6/+6
---
How many buffs did you put on that boi? 710 is the highest number you can get from Battlemaster/Brann/Patchwerk.
---
That's a lot of turtles.
---
I have no clue what you’re even talking about. Magnetic isn’t a downside, it’s an incredibly powerful effect
---
Awesome! I was tempted to doing it yesterday, but I was really low on health and struggling to stay on the 4th place...
---
I didn't get a chance to play the Brawliseum before you disabled it so I didn't get to use my free ticket. Will I get compensated too?
---
What happened to Reaper2r? He was here a few minutes ago making light hearted internet based commentaries and now he’s gone.
---
I’m looking forward to Legends of Runeterra’s expedition draft mode, people will be on roughly the same playing field and there’s no apps to tell you what to pick.
---
Mechs are stronger than Beasts. Magnetic is stronger than Beast effects. Having magnetic balances out spawning 1/1s instead of 2/2s
---
I was second and just started involuntarily shouting “for the meme”
---
The real play is to play him as 2/2.
---
Who is this player?
---
Probably because it’s not actually a good suggestion
---
Then quit Blizzard doesn't care about you they made a new game mode for people to get people playing Hearthstone again and I started playing again and you quit so it evens out

Next time for a real shit post! Lol.
---
I cited standard because it's was the mode being specifically discussed regarding metas, but I also mentioned it's not just this mode or this game. Any game those days, specially competitive ones, is infested with players using 'netdecking hardcore less effort as possible' mentality.
---
Imagine thinking demons are strong when lighrfang enforcer exists.
---
Why not? It only makes sense, having consistency without hurting balance is no issue. Do you really think that this will make Mechs too OP or something? It's no issue at all, get a grip. How many Golden Replicating Menaces do you see magnetised on? Having 2/2s doesn't help mech at all, separating them for more individual 1/1s is just better. This is purely for consistency and because it clearly should work that way. You are just being a contrarian whilst showing you don't understand Battlegrounds.
---
Otk means one turn kill, not first turn kill
---
 good luck getting rank 10 you little bitch
---
Zakazeu#1662 NA - 80g Quest trade, I show you go first.
---
What do you mean? This **IS** Kolento.
---
Americas Salamander#1380, I currently have an 80g play a friend quest
---
He's really hard to play if you are indecisive, especially if you luck into a short recruit phase.
---
I feel like Sindragosa should be higher. Like Deryl she requires some luck, but if you always freeze board for the first five or six rounds, you can get a pretty nice start to run away with.
---
you should really look at murlocs
---
Wait the person that tripled his card has an advantage over another who didn't triple their card? the horror!
---
I'm pretty sure Bob still supports the demon strategy, but he needs to be more sneaky about it so Blizzard doesn't find out. The play here is to pick up two Cobalt Guardians and freeze the last one. Then on your next turn you upgrade tavern, and make a Golden Cobalt Guardian. At that point Bob will give you 3 Tavern 5 options which are Mal'Ganis, Voidlord, and Annihilan Battlemaster.
---
Yup.
---
Did it work?
---
Yeah. I had selected bad server
---
Except you can't spawn 9. You could at most spawn 7, so 7/7 in stats. If you have a junk bot it's only 6. Still could be better for buffing junkbot, but its probably more subjective
---
Yeah, this is basically Manastorm for every minion...
---
Lol blizzard is a small indie company
---
\*almost the same exact wording
---
Not sure I follow mate, as far as I can tell the streamers are all largely playing Battlegrounds right now, but i don't watch that much twitch.
---
They used shifter zerres
---
No. you'd summon a 2 2 token instead of the usual 1 1. However if you had brann, shudderwock hero power or khadgar and summoned 3, 1 1 tokens they would combine into a 2 2,
---
The viewer numbers don't reflect their position in the list. Why is that?
---
You can get a triple from tokens.
---
However say you get 3 Murloc Tidehunters, you'll only be able to summon 2 before it gives you the triple for buying the third, meaning the tokens will be 2 regular and 1 golden so no token upgrade, if you get 4 Tidehunters and sell one before buying the third you'll be able to get both a golden token and golden Tidehunter in your hand.
---
People should be punished for using the time the game allows to complete a turn?
---
I really think there should be a report function for the game, but no one will ever get punished for not playing fast enough.
---

---
I think it's unfortunate that the interaction exists but making Sac Pact undiscoverable by Zephrys kinda detracts from the "perfect card" aesthetic. Sad for Jaraxxus fans.
---
I guess they could just remove the Sac Pact/Jaraxxus interaction. I personally wouldn't really want that to happen either though.
---
Triples have the stats of the first two minions you own combined
---
They just talk, sometimes streamers will do a portion of this before starting a game to engage with their audience (smart), and there are even people on twitch who stream without playing video games a lot of time
---
This is the stupid kind of shit that shows up in patch notes; I bet it will be fixed quickly
---
Beasts &gt; Mechs &gt; Demons &gt; Murlocs
---
Nah ur fine idk why you got so downvoted. I thought be meant the original one too.
---
Battlegrounds is gaining him some enemies.
---
In my opinion, I actually think Standard is pretty good right now. There are a couple very strong decks (as there almost always will be, realistically), but there's insane diversity among Tier 2 decks. I think if you set aside Evolve Shaman, the rest of the decks are actually quite fun to play as/against.
---
Wouldn't be OP honestly. Just look at microbot. If you take him turn 1 and keep for some time he can have insane attack, but has barely any hp and theres barely anything you can do to raise that up.
---
Even without "getting lucky" with rockpool, what you got was strictly worse than what you had on the board, and shows (i) you are committing to comps way too earlier; and (ii) undervaluing upgrades.
---
The correct play here is to buy two grandmas.  Freeze.  Upgrade next turn, then buy the third wolf.  You end up with a golden grandma and a discovered tier 4 on turn 4, and have a huge early game lead.
---
Bob for Smash

it makes sence just never thought about it

Even early Yugioh didn’t place an especially high value on information. Granted, early Yugioh could’ve had much better information-related cards than it did, but knowing what your opponent had was always outclassed by having good stuff instead.
---
Way too strong
---
mike donais said they tested it and it was indeed too op ...
---
While this would be a pretty standard or debatable weak 5 star, it would be very, very strong at 4 (AF Kay, Tavern rewards come to mind).  I could very well see them dropping it in the 4-Star category just to shake things up
---
You're down good minions but up a TACTICAL CHOICE
---
actually it and \[\[the boogeymonster\]\] would create and infinite loop
---
Turns out removing all the basic cards from the pool makes for a very swingy, very boring experience.

8/6/7 | Whenever this attacks and kills a minion, gain +2/+2.  
---
The stats and the text don't seem to reflect that though. Maybe it's just a visual bug in form of a leftover from the mechanic of golden minions producing other golden minions during vanilla Hearthstone gameplay?
---
how do you do the raid backwards is that even possible do you death ress run in it?
---
My whole life was a lie.
---
Definitely a fair T5 unit - starts really weak, but gets solid after 2 turns (8 attack), good after 3 turns (16 attack), great after 4 turns (32 attack) and basically Poisonous after 5+ turns (64+ attack). A nice snowbally minion that you have to put some time into - if you then manage to give it some health buffs (like Menagerie Magician, and I believe other Dragon buffers might be added too once the tribe lands) it should be a late game Dragon staple (assuming it gets introduced in the first place).
---
I've seen some people calling (potential) Scaled Nightmare busted in Battlegrounds a few times in similar dicussions, even too good for T6 unit, but I think that for some reason they forgot that Poisonous = infinite attack in this mode. In Constructed, getting to high attack amounts is way stronger than Poisonous, because you want to attack face. In BG, only minion vs minion combat matters.
---
Again, nobody was experimenting with it.
---
Alex was the best pick here.
---
I'm Rank 12 in Standard because I basically haven't played it at all the last 2 months. It's not even worth playing to get back to 5.
---
If I open the packs after they come out, will I no longer have a third hero option lol
---
This is new for me, never happened before. I have an ipad mini been playing for a couple years now,

~~I want to trade 80 Gold quest on NA, I can show it, but we play your quest first.~~

They said they're removing poisonous animations in a future patch, in addition to a few other QoL changes.

his lineup is much better tho

 Omega #23739, EU quest exchange, Ican show but you go first
---
You can tell it's an aspen by the way it is!
---
Now we need someone to get a triple off of golden murlocs from triple golden lookouts.
---
If you have a golden brann on board, you could conceivably do it with 1 golden lookout.
---
Vendetta checks for cards different from YOUR class, for example if you played shadow reaper anduin you would now be considered a priest, so if your theif cards would work off of rogue cards. (Know this because i have done something similar before)
---
OP ?
---
Makes sense. It would be too much.
---
So showing an upgrade arrow is a visual bug - the fact that he doesn't transform after he shifted into something else isn't (even though people semi-commonly report it as one).
---
Happened to me too, not sure if it's just a visual glitch or if I really got screwed out of my mmr
---
Also if you attach 2 of them to something, a 3rd purchase should still make it a triplet.
---
Thanks for your input :)
---
Thats true, but with only 6 hp left you cant lose a single game so i wouldnt want to risk it.
---
That's because they were designed for One Night in Karazahn, which had Dragons in it, and Lightfang was designed for Battlegrounds, which has specifically Beasts, Mechs, Demons, and Murlocs in it.
---
Another dragon I would like to see is Cobalt Guardian. It can buff tribeless minions but its not crazy op like lightfang.
---
Get nae nae'd
---
I assume that once it leaves beta it will have an Arena style entry fee and better prizes for the winner.
---
"Give twice the poisonous to any minion"
---
Now that is quality content!

It's a pretty genius build. I've been playing Mecha'thun Warlock ever since it was introduced, first with pure controllock+demon build and later with Hemet. I think your build is the fastest and most consistent build I've played. Thanks for the innovative deck, if it weren't for that deck, I would just play Battlegrounds.
---
But you still get normal cards instead of golden onces.
---
Does it still have a yellow border before played, even though it won't trigger?
---
I didn't call him trash bud. I just stated that he's rank 8 and he's trash talking a player which is a higher rank than him. I just don't think players that can't get rank 5 (which can be achieved with a below 50% wr) should be making statements about another player's ability.
---
Now I remember why I don't watch Amaz
---
Legendary!
---
It’s a visual bug. It’s been shared several times in this sub and has even had Blizzard employees confirm it’s a known visual bug (you still get the MMR adjustment).
---
Battlegrounds is in beta - these things happen.
---
He made this profile because he was suspended twice in the last couple months. He keeps making new accounts to harass the devs at every turn. This thread is basically an encore of [this one](https://old.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/drqvh8/hearthstone_battlegrounds_card_hero_library/f6l7dmn/?context=1).
---
Very helpful! Always nice to have new decks to try out.
---
That looks like a victory - I hope you at least took that early amalgam-heavy comp to Top 3!
---
Holy shit, a Battlegrounds video that I actually enjoyed watching? WHAT IS THIS MADNESS?!
