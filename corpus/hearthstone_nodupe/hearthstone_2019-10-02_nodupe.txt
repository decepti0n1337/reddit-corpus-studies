It would make my patches cannon barrage OTK better, so sure

---
I doubt it, making cthun viable would require bringing back his buffs. That and he’s a weak archetype that doesn’t see play to begin with. Same with yogg, maybe this is the plan, but I sure hope not because these cards blow.
---

I miss so much hearing him entering the battlefield yelling "I'm in charge now"
---
You really think someone would go on the internet and tell lies?
---
Highlander Priest is far from being a decent deck in wild so I would really like to see this change, Raza was my 1st golden legendary.
---
Yep, very cool indeed. Now I can view all of Matt Dixon's card artwork in a single click.
---
I didn't see a single thing Tekahn did in Phase 3 in my first run of his fight; I just Gatling Wand and Torched my way through it. Since I haven't gotten around to trying the other explorers, this is a cool theory!
---
So which four classes are the old gods, and which five are the dragon aspects?
---
Lucky me on the final boss I had a gahzrilla who made him completely skip over phase 2 lol
---
Worth noting that Earthen Scales + Radiant Elemental doesn’t require Elise’s Might or Darklight Torch; this is just another way you can OTK if needed.
---
Getting a card to be “good enough” and have it not fall into being not good enough, or being just a bit too good is a lot harder than it sounds.
---

---
If a card does end up being too good, then that’s a card that every player has, so you’d see it in most decks.
---
Nzoth seems pretty slow, not sure how it will fair vs quest shaman or druid. If cube or other really good wild rattles come back, I may have to rectify that statement, but right now, it alone wouldnt be enough. Even with anka cheating out good rattle minions, without vanish, i dont think deathrattle rogue will survive long enough to get value from nzoth.
---
I got mad when they nerfed him and dusted him. Everytime I look through my wild collection in the priest tab I get sad. Highlander priest was very fun for me, especially the dragon variant.
---
After playing a minion, shuffle two copies into your deck. They cost (1).
---
Draw 2 extra cards, you are immune to fatigue.
---
Grab Malorne from Bob.

No shame in making mistakes, even pro players miss lethal. While the point of the post is to tell people about a bug in the way Zephrys functions, we can avoid losing games because of this in situations like the one OP was in by attacking before playing Zephrys

This rotating core set then would remain free as this upcoming experiment will be?
---
sssssssssssooooooooooo how is this hs content?
---
Old gods were fun, but i would rather go back to Jades or have a actual dragon expansion
---
So would that mean the whole classic set I would assume?
---
80g quest trade EU Akarillon#2268
---
80g quest trade, porcino#1636 NA you go first
---
It depends on how they want to do it.
---
If they made a Rotating Core Set "proper," I would suspect that they'd add a few hundred cards to Classic, including old classics (no pun intended) like Sludge Belcher, Antique Healbot, maybe even Justicar Trueheart, and reintroduce/rotate them out as they see fit. If they do that, they may not be inclined to just give them all away; in which case, you can unlock them in Classic Packs when they're in the rotation, and once you have them, that's that.
---
If they really want, they can make it so that if you already own all in-rotation Classic Legendaries, opening another one in a pack gets you a currently unowned one not in rotation.
---
But a few hundred cards is a big, big, *big* step and is basically doing the entire thing in a single swoop. No need to do that when they can drip-feed it and just let us know what cards are coming in and out before they do it. After all, why tell us if good ol' Emperor Thaurissan is coming back to play if they don't plan on doing it within the next year?
---
Yeah, I can hear the picture in my nightmares.
---
It was sub-50% WR, I think around 48%? But you could say that was due to the meta warping around dealing with Big Priest that kept it weaker.
---
It was on the picking treasure screen so that's literally impossible..
---
[READYSIR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkx9lMaYrN8)
---
If you've played WW it's similar to the final fight there, you get to choose which explorer goes first, then when you lose their health you swap to a new one of your choice.  So if your first one can grind out Tekhan's first deck you can slap down maxwell (afte rhe uses both twisting nethers) and use the windfury hero power to make a big board of 6+ attack minions with windfury and then slap him with a good 100+ damage in one turn

I similarly cheesed him from the first phase by grinding him out of removal then placing down 3 of that Pandarian mage Ley? And used my Gatling gun which was charged to around 120 already

Exact same thought
---
Not sure why you're downvoted
---
Highlander decks are always going to be expensive given their limitations.
---
And they’re not dominating the meta, Quest Shaman and Control Warrior are doing so much better than any highlander deck right now. I don’t see a problem with diversity or with the average player having a good competitive deck.

I think my comment got flagged with controversy so I guess it was needed.
---
Surprised to find this wasn’t the most upvoted one. I thoroughly enjoyed the implication of the actual vs the translation on this one.
---
I feel like they would keep the class distinctions between EVIL and Saviors classes, so it would be something like this:
---
Rogue - N'zoth: Because the Nzoth rogue callbacks are too good.
---
Priest - C'Thun: Priests have a lot of cultist-themed minions.
---
Warrior - Why'SharJay: Warriors always had an affinity for big minions and recruit mechanics.
---
Shaman - Yogg'Saron: Hagatha giving you a constant stream of spells synergizes really well with Yogg.
---
Mage - Kalec: Would prefer it to be Alex for the Freeze Mage callbacks, but Kalec is the obvious pick.
---
Druid - Ysera: Obvious reasons.
---
Paladin - Nozdormu: They got lots of bronze dragon association already
---
Hunter - Alexstraza: /Shrug, its the last set.
---
Feel like Warlock would get either a HS-special lore character, because there isnt a 5th old god, but I could see Rafaam siding with some reincarnation of Deathwing to spread chaos along with the four old gods.... Or maybe Warlock gets some Void Lords like Entropius.
---
Lol what? I can’t imagine where.
---
nothing special, probably half of players did, it's easy enough
---
*Lit lord
---
Well its actually a alternate dimension rag, i think he either got redeemed or cleansed,  or he never got curropted by the old gods.
---
Wonder if it has to do with siamat, like in the siamat card reveal
---
pops up a lot for me, actually
---
You didn't like menstruation?

It’s a reward, yes. Packaged with more adventure content and priced at what they think is fair for it. I was just responding to the fact that some people were asking for rewards and after like rumble run a lot of people felt like it was one and done and no point. Their solution was to greatly expand on the content, add rewards, and sell it. It’s really up to you to determine whether that’s worth it to you, but to pretend it came out of nowhere is ridiculous
---
Shhh let people enjoy things
---
You still need to purchase all the acts.
---
I used to play a MMOCCG called "War Metal: Tyrant" before Hearthstone was released. One of my favourite threads in the community on the non-developer forum was called [Catyrant](https://www.kongregate.com/forums/12-kongregate-multiplayer-games/topics/290516-warmetal-tyrant-classic-thread-catyrant), where the various abilities found on cards were translated into cat gifs.
---
I think that relevancy can be found in the nexus of effort finding cat gifs that matched the spirit or the wording of the card ability/text, and the amusement derived from seeing how a poster linked a cat gif to an ability. In other words, it falls under the broad category of "fluff" in this subreddit.
---
The OP's particular example isn't great, especially considering the other top-notch examples in the linked thread. I think that the occasional well executed cat gifs of translated Hearthstone cards, abilities, text or conditions would add value to the subreddit, that the inherent effort required and the natural sorting process of up/down voting would provide an adequate filter against a deluge of these gifs from flooding the subreddit.
---
Thanks! (And I hadn't even noticed)
---
Hey just some random food for thought from somebody who did exactly 6 time less than you (going just for crown everything for now). From what I remember you like to cull your decks from junk a lot to increase consistency. This could be one of the reasons why you find Xatma so frustrating. You need some junk to give it to her, trigger board clears without losing important stuff and to slow down game progress without triggering bloods and fatigue to fast. Personally I find Xatma fights much more interesting and fun compared to first plague. Second phase is especially cool because there are many ways to use weak ai to your advantage. Of course I beat her only 3 times (300-0 twice) not 18...maybe I just got lucky. Btw. I agree with your class power levels, Reno 125/3 (bosses beated/runs completed) Finley 35/3, Elise 42/3, of course heroic.
---
Do you mean the curse of flesh?

i just find the whole thing ridiculous. it's an event to promote their games and i have to *pay money* to get hyped about things i will probably purchase in the future?

that feels like it would be the equivalent of having to pay to watch e3 or nintendo direct. most companies would beg their consumers to watch it for free, but with blizzard i gotta pay $40.

---
Congratulations mate! Really happy for you. Keep on going and let's see where we end up this time.
---
Explorers over EVIL, but Rafaam over literally everyone else.
---
I don't think its a goid idea. The card is too random and that healthy for a game.
---
I think the 300 damage idea was just terrible.
---
That aside, I don't think you should stress about getting virtual checkmarks on bad cards.
---
&gt;by the time I get to that point I'm just fatigued and can't be bothered
---
I think that points to a real design issue, but I don't think letting you skip to heroic would solve it.
---
I did, I was not impressed :(
---
Agreed, unlucking items AFTER completing the game is useless.  
---
There is no point for me to rerun it because there is no more reward to earn, so these collectibles are useless because you never get to use them.
---
He reached #49 from the dumpster. And I didn't say it was tier 1, just that the quest is far from bad that's what it's representative of. Try having a lucky streak with a meh deck into top 100 in the last days of the season.

And they'll tell everyone they'll get a special copy of this legendary if they buy a blizzcon pass. Then people will do it and then learn a week later that the entire player base gets a regular non golden copy anyways with no purchase required. As is tradition.

We don't know her true origins for sure yet, but whenever she speaks of the old gods, she uses pronouns such as 'we' and 'us'.

Every time I queued up my opponent started with freezing trap, misdirection, or pressure plate in their opening hand, and played even more as the game progressed. Why are secrets  especially hunter secrets that usually punish single minions, in a brawl where you start the game with 5+ 6-9 drops in hand?
---
Ok I'll correct myself. Draws are not counted as wins. Better? :)
---
I want this card unnerfed for unlimited - it is kind of broken anyway so why not - 
---
I mean who cares about balance in Heartstone at this point anyway - just let me play this card and bow down
---
Their domains are kind of all over the place in WoW proper. For example, Yogg-Saron probably has the most overt references in-game to madness; miners carving out saronite are losing their minds, the Titan Keepers have become possessed, and his boss fight literally has an insanity mechanic. 
---
And as the WoWwiki points out, despite his boast, he shows zero actual death-related powers (other than... y’know, killing you)
---
So if you think about it, hearthstone is a financial game

Right now in wild, the deck I'm seeing the most that frustrates me the most by FAR is the newer version of Big Priest and always falling behind by the time my opponent can just spam Convincing Infiltrator and I'm toast by then. The only thing I've ever been remotely effective against it with is a very uh... unoptimized Kingsbane rogue, to put it mildly.   
---
Historically, the decks I've had most fun with have been VERY tempo or have long curves, and I feel like I just can't keep up: older Quest Hunter, Big Spell Mage with Alanna, Spiteful Summoner Mage, Cubelock.  And uh...the only time I went to an in-person tournament, I only won matches with Taunt Warrior with Un'Goro, ahah. My main Wild deck right now is Spiteful Summoner Mage with a lot of dragons and only has an over 50% win rate against mages and warlocks. In standard I'm just losing to everyone with a budget secret Hunter because I'm not hitting my stride before they just crush me, especially Quest Druid. 
---
Zillax is definitely one of those "every deck recipe I see that fun has it and I don't" kinda cards. I pulled Brann yesterday for example, and I just don't think I have a deck that supports him, even if it seems fun. In terms of pre-built recipes, the closest I have is 29/30 for the game's recipe for Vault Hunter, I can definitely give that a shot, and I'll look at what you linked me to, as well.
---
I dont undertand why people put B before the original name of the card
---
And at the end of my turn I summon...
---
It was a joke from the original video
---
Yes with friends. No with bots (except 100 gold Win 5 Games quest and Watch a Friend)
---
There is a posibility to steal it and silence the lich king as priest in its fight. Its a fun easter egg.
---
Same can be done with mana bind with mage against the "turn the enemy hero hp to 1".
---
YOU KNOW THE DRILL BOIS
---
I nearly killed Tekhan with Bubble Blower Finley. Had his lance from turn 3 onward which helped, and when he finally did die the lance passes to the next hero you choose. Very nice.
---
There is a "flow of play". It goes: "Deck -&gt; Hand -&gt; Board".  These are also called "regions". When a card is buffed, it can only carry that buff "forward". Anytime it moves "backwards" in the flow of play it reverts back to it's base stats.
---
This is also true when you "steal" a card from your opponent. If you steal it from his hand (into your hand), you will still retain those buffs. If you steal it from the board into your hand, you WILL NOT retain those buffs because it went "backword" in the flow of the game.
---
Does that make sense?
---
I think you misunderstood, it means that you can't have 3 decks in your match lineup that center on Phaoris because you can only put him in one. This is for a competitive match/tourney ruleset, not as a rule for general collection.
---
I'd be more excited about this post if I hadn't made this same Vargoth, hero power, Death play myself before.

I wish I screenshotted it, but yesterday I was way behind on board so I figured screw it and went all in on buffing a minion. Had taunt, around 25ish attack and hp. Next turn the boss put down Sylvanas and the 'destroy a minion add lackey to your hand' and stole him from me. Pissed me off after wasting hours on the run to lose to that.

On one hand, I should applaud you for creating a deck that shits on Discardlock and Snip Snap Warlock.  On the other hand, god this deck feels horrible to play against, and I hate that you unleashed this evil.

Yeah but in Wing 4 (the Enrage wing) the game still pauses every time any minion takes damage, to give that minion +1 attack, then restarts the animation.  Not just Gatling Wand but Arcane Missiles etc.

Same. I had the double legendary treasure as mage. Pyros for days. Wasn’t even a close contest.
---
The reason is because that video was so spot on it made everyone want to watch it again and again.

Proving that the treasure shows up when you have a highlander deck unfortunately does nothing to prove that the treasure can't show up when you don't.

Interesting theory though.

It's definitely a hero killer. Since the decks dont really have any board clears, I've found that it usually kills you and forces you to pick another savior. I always leave Elise for right when this happens, since picking her starts you with the treasure that shuffles all enemy minions into your deck.
---
Yeah, my thought would be to play it when the minion you want is the ONLY one on he board, but that is difficult to set up
---
Maybe you can read the rest of the sentence before you comment again
---
It loses to the Discolock, DS Priest and Ice Block Mage decks that are running around. It's fun but it's got it's weaknesses.
---
I had a fireball so I used it on the boss to finish it. But if the boss dies &amp; you die to his hero power as well, you lose anyways and it counts as a defeat.

Damn man that top comment.

He/she is a good person.

i have finished every single adventure in the heroic mode, and one of the reasons i did that was to prove myself i could do something nearly impossible, to laugh about my friends that couldnt do it, because it was legit hard! for example, many tried to defeat toki and even after 999 tries they couldnt do it, and the ones who could felt proud about that. Now in tombs of terror is just a matter of time, you can be UTTER TRASH NOOB, if you keed trying you are eventually going to win, even if you only remove 1 health poing from the plage lord per try... so, i aint going to wast my time in something ANYONE can do it...
---
Shit yes! I kept thinking it doesn’t feel right, then u described it perfectly!
---
Hope to see an updated version from OP

“Yes?

Arrgghh. For the last time, I’m a DREADLORD, not a DRUGLORD!!”

I've found this to be very strong:

\-Daring Fire-Eater

\-Novice Engineer

\-Ancient Mysteries
---
\-Khadgar

\-Ice Block

\-Jan'alai, the Dragonhawk

I think that the forced normal mode can fairly easily be argued for : it's an interactive tutorial. The idea is that by forcing players to play normal mode before heading into Heroic, you let them interact with every single game mechanic once before putting additional challenges on top of it. 
---
However, there are a few issues with that explanation. First, as some people mentioned, defeating the plague lord will often take more than one run, especially when you begin. So you're actually forced to discover that mechanic a few times before you're able to unlock the challenging mode.
---
Another one is how unlocks are the same in both modes, but requires to be unlocked independently. This also means that you have to "discover the mechanics" again.
---
It was tried before by getting 39 packs with  no legendary card and open a golden one. you don’t always get a legendary.
---
Oh god, you got me
---
Owned in both senses.
---
What is this combo? I couldn't tell what the buff card was or the target. I know what the priest card that reduces spell cost is tho.
---
Can’t wait to see more!
---
1st thing i built was that but with Mogu Cultist instead of Grave Horror. Luckily I played against a crappy paladin deck because what i imagined did not work: couldnt manage hand size with low mana and when I did have 7 cultist in hand i had to kill off 2 radiants first, didn't get the combo off until turn 9 ;(
---
Did somebody say boom?
---
Definitely not the best deck but I’ve been running Elemental Evocation, Zephrys, Book of Specters, Zilliax, Reno, and Siamat. Basically mulligan for ele evo and Zephrys and let him carry early game.  Reno for clears, siamat for threats, and Zilliax for healing
---
Grave Horror instead of Divine is much better.
