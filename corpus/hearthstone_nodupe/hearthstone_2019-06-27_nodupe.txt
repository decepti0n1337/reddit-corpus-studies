I think Amaz made a new bet/game style of Arena where the goal was to win 100 games in 10 consecutive arena runs. This was a lot harder than averaging 7+ wins because one bad run would probably end you. I don't remember if anyone won or who did the best, but my guess is this helped Hafu gain more respect because things like the Arena leaderboard were only based on your top 100 runs or something, which made the averages inflated and favored those who had more time overall.

Windfury Shaman.

He'd be really strong with all the imp flooding spells as well though. Plus you'd have to remove him instead of going face which gives you another turn in survive in many cases.
---
Low key one of the best HS streamers. Such an entertaining stream
---
They aren't trying to do the class a favor. They're trying to keep the game fresh^(tm) while also never printing another card that anyone wants to play. 
---

---
They probably looked at their big pile of farmed data and determined that frustrating^(tm) effects like instant damage (burn that goes face, charge, mind blast) and stalls (vanish, ice block, etc) cause new players to quit the game before spending money. 
---
They certainly have not printed anything meant to engage experienced players since roughly K&amp;C so one must presume that they're trying very hard not to alienate players who only understand trump trading.
---
I pray for what is about to happen to your karma
---
I *want* to like him, but he’s so boneheaded. His streams are .1% clips like this, and 99.9% losing with the same shitty deck for four hours in a row at rank 10 while complaining about netdecks.
---
For a game based off WoW, Hearthstone has sure decided to drift away from the fun callbacks.
---
It was also good with the draw shrine and gonk.
---
Does blizzard just hate the idea of control style rogues ever? Why’d they rotate it I’m so confused.
---
r/flamewanker more like
---
Having a blast with handbuff charge paladin.  Time Out! is totally broken - you can stall for those crucial 5/6, 6/7, 7/8 turns.  Once you have 15 charge damage in hand it's over unless they have a taunt (and I haven't seen one yet).  Would be even better with Leeroy obviously but I don't have him.

the issue with Neptulon is there's literally a rare card that does his job but better. Hell, the quest does his job better.

I’d play that tbh

Manup#2508 NA trading 80 gold quest
---
I always thought Rhonin was Classic
---
Right now? Zoo...when there's not a bunch of warriors out. Japetto shaman is fun too...
---
Because Twitch is an entertainment platform. Being bad and entertaining will get more views than being good and not entertaining.
---
Even the people who watch with the intention of improving will pick the 100th best player who explains their decisions well over the 10th best player who doesn't.
---
He knew what he was getting himself into.
---
Y'know, all these posts reminds me of Mark Rosewaters old GDC talk: https://youtu.be/QHHg99hwQGY
---
Players are great at identifying a problem, but not that great at fixing it.
---
Yeah, arena should be free. It sucks and makes no sense that I have to either grind for a week for 150 gold or spend $1.99 just to play 1 round of arena that you make might just get destroyed on your first round and waste that hard earned 150 gold. Arena was SOO fun when I unlocked it and now I can never play it again cause it’s to expensive. Plus Tavern Brawl is only out for 3 days and gotta wait 4 days for it to come back, plus it might be something you don’t like. Then all you have is ranked/casual and solo adventure left to do. They need to understand with Arena how many players would just love to play the super fun Arena for free like every day as like a weekly challenge to see who gets the most win streak and your rewarded on your # of your most wins you got.
---
"we want to be careful with their power level so that Hearthstone can continue to feel fresh with each new year." is what they said, to put it simply, expansions fresh=new/old players pay money for em, classic buy and keep like a souvenir
---
Meh, at this point it would be much more beneficial to watch Old Guardians educational Hearthstone videos.
---
How does he not fit? Charge minions can also "rush" enemy minions... Or go face... Ya, always go face
---
Hit them in the face until they have no life and you win the game.
---
'Your buffed minions have +1 attack.'
---
Done and done!
---
It’s a love-hate relationship
---
When you run into a player using it, you get it, and the game then makes it your default until you change it back. Assumedly a lot of new players don’t know how to change it back and thus you see it a lot.
---
Not gonna lie, this would actually be pretty interesting
---
The fuck is TFT?
---
I mean, Baku IS pretty overpowered, that's why Odd decks utterly dominated the meta last year and why it was Hall of Famed.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But you're right, pretending that excluding half of the card pool from your deck is not a significant downside just because there are still ways to use all your mana each turn with lucky draws is clearly nonsense.
---
If you play against someone with the cardback, you get the cardback. And it changes your selection to that automatically. I assume people are just too lazy or don't care enough to change it back. Cardbacks kinda suck because you barely ever see your own cardback in game. You can literally only see the top of the cardback on the cards in your deck. It makes cardbacks trivial.
---
&gt; just as much as Stoneclaw totem is a snake, which is always.
---
What else is it supposed to be?
---
I haven't watched her streams much so I don't know the extent of it, but misophonia or not, seems like a perfectly acceptable reason to me.
---
But the class identity..
---
Radiant form.
---
Lightsworn Angel: 3 mana 3/4: Battlecry: Heal 5 to a minnion. If you are in shadow form instead deal 5 damage to a minnion.
---
Lucky Looker: 2 mana 1/1. Battlecry: Draw a 3 cost spell from your deck.
---
I think it would make it a lot harder to balance cards going forward if you had to consider 3 possible hero powers instead of 1 for class cards, and an absurd \*27\* possible hero powers for neutrals. And on that note, I think it would be really hard to come up with 2 new hero powers per class and ensure that all of them are useful while also ensuring that none of them produce utterly broken, degenerate decks using existing cards.
---
Seems consistent with the dev goals for playing against priest in wild.
---
Aztaraxxis#1906 NA trading 80 gold quest. I’ll show, you go first.
---
&gt; It's about Blizzard not helping her out. 
---
Hafu said she was 8th, right? Did Blizzard help the #7 through #1 any more than her? 
---
Kripparrian was a big name long before HS, Trump too. Blizzard's a business, they'll help people that help them in turn. A big name who makes top 100 (or even 1000) is much better than a nobody who finishes 1st. It's that person's job to get popular, *then* Blizzard will work with them, as it's mutually beneficial. 
---
Your ranking means next to nothing if you're not popular.
---
Hell, Blizzard works a lot with Disguise Toast... Is he among the top players, for either ranked or arena? Hell no. But he's popular. The only important factor.
---
Love any Office reference. Well done, sir.

Please explain this to me. How does your mind somehow hear turtle instead of eternal. He says I-am-e-ter-nal and he draws out the last syllabille forever, and there is clearly no second t sound there like in turtle. 
---
In summary I think this is a dumb meme.
---
DK Anduin definitely counts.

He was the ultimate shadow priest.
---
Hearthstone is such a shit game, why do people keep playing it?

I mean, Hafu was a pro world of Warcraft player for several years and competed at multiple Blizzard / wow arena tournaments. Arguably one of the more recognized players from the burning crusade era.
---
[Here is a quick video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNhP5b9YafM) if anyone is interested.
---
&gt;Reason why female gamers/streamers gets lot of hate is because lots of them aren't really gamers, and certainly not skilled gamers.
---
Unskilled gamers can attract people to their stream through various other methods, such as by being entertaining or attractive, or both. I think that people hate on the female streamers that rely on those methods because they're perceived as maliciously pretending to care about the game in order to get attention, whereas the men who aren't very skilled yet are still trying to get views are seen as just being innocently average or casual (as opposed to misrepresenting themselves). Informing this is the culturally ingrained (and possibly outdated) idea that almost all men play games at least casually but it is rare for women to take a true interest in gaming. It's easy to see how one would follow the erroneous chain of logic that if it's rare for women to enjoy games, and if a woman is playing a game poorly, then she must be doing it for some reason other than because she enjoys it.
---
I think this is the double standard that women are held to, to their disadvantage. Then the lack of good faith is turned into hate when it's combined with the feelings of their whole gender being taken advantage of by attractive female streamers who are able to manipulate men through their sex hormones much more effectively than vice versa.
---
Thematically, fuck yeah. Balance wise? Yeah hmn

Coin.  In 50% of all decks
---
Guaranteed start of game effects won't be able to be properly balanced, short of turning this game into yugioh.
---
Well, this is unrelated, but I'm currently top 1500 legend and use Hench-Clan Hag in my token Druid deck.  The amalgams that it spawns are mechs, and so can be magnetized by Replicating Menace and Sn1p-Sn4p.  I find it better than Explodinator because the 3-3 body is harder to kill by Rogue and the 1-1 amalgams trade better than the 0-2 bombs.
---
However, there is a druid card that, as a Battlecry, turns all of your Treants into 5-5s.  If the amalgams counted as Treants, then the 3-4 Nightmare Amalgam and the amalgams created by Hench-Clan Hag would synergize with this card, and Treant Druid might be viable.
---
That's not the deck we're talking about though
---
I'll never understand Vanish being hof'ed before Leeroy
---
Direct damage isn't in line with priests classes identity apparently. Mind boast going away because of this.
---
This post is prodding that sore wound.
---
Yes the hero power itself has more value than just the 0 or 1 mana, but as a single play in a turn it doesn't grant you tempo or anything by the extra mana it saves you
---
No I didn't. I said "one time I was watching her stream Auto Chess". It's like saying "one time I went to the store and I bought this". It doesn't mean you only went the store once in your entire life.
---
I never said she was emotional either. I was asking.
---
Still makes no sense to me what that has to do with anything
---
I agree Kappa
---
It would be better if they gave nothing.
---
Define "nice chance"
---

---
This is the first time I actually miss deathknights. Uther 2-turn kills were so much fun last time this one was around.
---
I don’t understand why she’s getting worked up? She literally plays video games for a living, is voluntarily putting herself in the public eye and people shit talk her. Seems like part of the deal.
---
Not gonna lie this girl looks like a huge biotch
---
The light shall burn you!
---
The only good warlock deck now is Aggro with magic carpet... has a decent win rate.
---
And no, is not disadvantaged in getting cards in packs, it has the same rate of dropping like any other class card (considering rarity), but if you look at only one class you have 1/9 chances if the card is not neutral...
---
I guess will see...
---
Dude fucking yes, she was so good, but that incessive humming and singing to songs was making me switch channels... I know it's fucking stupid reason, but it bothers me.
---
Yes. I’m have 19 saved and going to buy the welcome bundle when they drop.
---
&gt;If it's the majority could it possibly be that whatever they were saying was valid?
---
That's a fallacy [Argumentum ad populum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)
---
Miracle, Freeze and Control weren't *that* hard. New decks such as Cyclone Mage are significantly harder and the game has definitely become more skill-intensive over time. Even the dumbest decks like Bomb Hunter have some interesting decisions to make now, e.g. when to use Magnetic. You just have rose-tinted glasses because everyone was bad at the time, and the more difficult decks seemed hard in a relative sense.
---
I also find the top 800 L thing a bit specific. You mean to say you peaked there or is it a consistent thing?
---
*soylent chugging intensifies*
---
You poor thing. Having to craft shitty legendaries like Millhouse, Nat Pagle, Lorewalker, and others to get one achievement. I tried to do it but couldn't I lacked the resolve.
---
2x 2/3’s and 2x 3/4’s, in a time where there was a lot less removal in the game.
---
I sort of did this, but only in a half measure.  I didnt care about wild so just under 2 years ago I started dusting a LOT of rotated out cards.  However, I also left a lot of the cards I really loved that really defined certain decks, and focused more on marginal ones.
---
I've LONG since burned through the extra dust I got, though it was AMAZING at the time.  I was playing casually and had all the decks I wanted for like 3 sets in a row.  However, now I am as far behind in standard as my casual play would have you believe and, ironically, I've started dabbling in wild some since it is great when your standard is lacking.  Saving some of those cards really paid off, and while I can't make a shitload of wild decks, I can at least create some fun ones I remembered as standard decks back in the day with some alterations.  Enough to have some fun.
---
Just remember you are trading long term benefit for short term benefit.
---
I think you're not getting the point... being a troll to everyone is "fine", but just trolling a specific person isn't, and in this case it's pretty clear chat only cared about Kripp's and Adwcta's opinions
---
I blame lifecoach n his stupid sexy nipples for that
---
Annoy-o-Horn summons only mechs so i think it would work well
---
As Kalec was slowly dying in a single turn from 100 health while being overloaded for 50, I understood why we're the villains in this one.
---
I'm kinda surprised your missing those, since most of them have been in competitive decks for many years. I'm only missing the legendaries that never get played like Gruul, Hogger and King Mukkla.
---
Same year of the other Echo cards, when Witchwood rotates also Boomsday does and Witch's Brew is going to be the only "echo" card in Standard. Not exactly quantum physics.
---
Use deck tracker they said. /s 
---
But ya, sometimes it sucks.
---
“Best priest deck” is not a prestigious title most days.
---
A fun wild deck I play with is murloc shaman. It’s got unite the Murlocs Hagatha and shudderwock as the main win conditions.then just fill ur deck with some Murlocs volcanos healing rain and tidal surges and ur all set
---
Priest is becoming more and more like the white cards in MTG, that is the ones you summon through plains. All the effects are usually about high health and healing (and flying, but this mechanic doesn't exist in Hearthstone)
---
There may be new players with limited collection who would appreciate the random legendary effect, I guess. But yeah if you have a semi-decent collection this is pretty bad.

A simple way to win is trying to get [[Rin, the First Disciple]]. Combining it with, let’s say, the spells cost 2 less or spells cost healt instad of mana, together with trying to make rin cost 0 or make it start in your hand with the use of our beloved friend Bob makes for an easy clear.

Another way is to try and get as many [[Mal’Ganis]] and trying to get treasures such as making cards cost half or making all &gt; 5 cost 5 (this is how I cleared it).

Better than getting Nozdormu or (maybe) Onyxia. Especially for new players they'll probably use Brightwing much more than Onyxia.

Yeah no kidding ; I always see this popping up, and it seems absurd to me. Although there's a possibility that Reckless Rocketeer would see play if Leeroy was gone, people don't realize how worse it really is. Leeroy's 6 damage for 5-mana is large. Reckless Rocketeer, for one more Mana, has one less Attack, which is *really, reaaaaally* significant when you're counting up that lethal.

Achievements in HS as an Arena player? Wow, okay.

Just fyi (in case you forgot), secrent agent ([[Drakonid Operative]]) is from Gadgetzan, which was after WotOG. Maybe you meant [[Wyrmrest Agent]]? But I don't think anyone can really call that OP.

Well, the two main cards supporting Druids "class identity" (mana generation) were slaughtered by Blizzard for no good reason, Aviana was nerfed because they put a 4mana tutor 4 in the game and didn't think that was the issue. I just want to see Wild Growth back. I miss him.
---
&gt;Well, she's talking about achievements. As far as I know, her arena results speak for themselves, and she was consistent enough that you can't put it on sheer luck or anything  
---
So she is saying people en masse attacked her over her arena results on reddit?  This is what I'm not getting.    
---
Any quotes or references to threads where this happened?  
---
It's pretty bullshit to just make tweets to that extent and blame the "majority" when it may or may not have ever actually happened.
---
Wow. This will actually make me spend money on hs again.
---
I had literally no idea this card even existed.
---
I'm not a big fan of HoF'ing Vanish either. I think that card is one of the most interesting board clears in the game while also being not too strong, and really fits Rogue. I wish they hadn't decided to say: "well, if board clears are one of Rogue's weaknesses, they can't have board clears AT ALL". This seems like such a daft and short-sighted way of doing things to me.
---
So she was good at arena, cool.  
---
But makes some vague tweet years later occusing the masses of what exactly? Saying she wasn't good?  
---
Just reads like some childish soap opera drama, pretty easy to do when it's game you no longer support.  
---
Either make a point and support it with links to the threads etc. being referenced or just fuck off already.  
---
Otherwise it just comes across as yet another drama king/queen.
---
Greetings..
---
How are people still spamming this bell stuff?
---
Wow thanks this helped.
---
I thought each expansion atleast 1 set rotated out. Not 3 rotating out at the start of a year
---
nefarian would force us all to face our true class identity.
---
Its not worth it to put counters to one singular deck archetype since it makes the deck worse versus everything else. It was just an example.
---
Still not random enough... Make it restore a random amount of health multiplied by the turn number and then take the square root of that.
---
He said Zentimo on board
---
Not if the third one casts Myras, Free from Amber into Mecha’thun, then Cataclysm
---
You seem to have some serious issues, issues that are not related to her tweet nor what I posted. You deal with it.
---
Well, at least he's not acidic.
---
\-control decks are forever dead in Wild. If you think control as "an entire archetype" will comeback by removing BP, you clearly haven't played wild. 
---
\-all viable wild decks are OP anyway.
---
\-wild is doomed to have no variety. There full of bullshit cards. There is no incentive to play average or under valued cards whatsoever.
---
\-interactivity? pfft, tell that to aggro decks.
---
\-frustration? also tell that to aggro decks.
---
Im not defending BP, it is merely one bullshit in a gamemode that is full of shits. Focusing on it alone will do nothing to help. Remember raza priest? its was nerfed "for the sake of wild" and I doubt it could still be relevant. Its winrate was mediocre and people thought removing it will make the meta healthier.
---
Spoiler alert: it didnt get healthier. If Blizzard want to improve Wild, they have to address the whole wild pool.
---
Brightwing isn't trash.
---
While I might agree with the general message this was a truly annoying video to watch.
---
I think he was flabbergasted that Brightwing, a mere faerie dragon, would get added in the pool with the mighty aspects.
---
To be fair, he's probably a better dragon than 2 who went psycho, one that literally had you kill itself and one that got corrupted while on an extended nap.
---
i wouldnt mind a hof really, spares them from made utherly worthless with nerfs for wild and standard.
---
I wouldn't buy a 20$ bundle on an alt account.
---
What the fuck did I just watch. This is like somebody had an animation project to do and forgot about it until the night before/day of and had to finish it anyway. “Well, it IS a one minute animation....” they say as they submit their homework to the teacher.
---
entomb ealry on? drakanoid operative? duskbreaker? potion of madness? and the wyrmrest agen(2/4taunt if holding dragon) was hated ealry on back in days aswell.
---
You'd need Baleful in your opening hand or another one to also shuffle it back to your deck
---
Rogue totally didn't deserve a nerf, it definitely didn't have a positive win rate against every deck in the meta and every class as a whole.
---
Yeah, got really lucky this time with the burning wit combo AND rocket backpack —I picked up 2 khadgars early just cause the other choices were bad, didn’t plan on getting the rush passive as well! 
---
Sure feels good after wiping to kalec twice before this, was shaking when I had to mulligan for the last boss haha.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Indeed. However the amount people spend on HS positively pales in comparison to some other mobile games:

"nowhere did it say that Elza was a 1-in-400 pull, with each try costing about $2.50. He eventually got her, though — one character in a game with a cast of hundreds.
---
“I charged $1500 that day to get her,” he wrote."
---
This is assuming I give a fuck about getting the new cards as opposed to getting dust.
---
Lol. 5 isn’t bad at all.
---
*you should have picked mercy* 
---

---
lol xD   
---
Nice nickname
---
i mean it is snip snap otk which takes quite a while and have been seen a number of time so the opponent might just be tired of seeing it play out
---
all good :) to be fair, it could have been a joke about when naga giants was a thing
---
There are plenty of polarising matchups in wild. I can easily make a control deck that has 70% winrate against aggro or a combo deck that has 70% against control. Plenty of decks in wild have non-interactive matchups. It's whatever.
---
At least quest mage(the fast version) somewhat takes skill to play. You have to know when to go for quest, when to play for tempo. It has a non-linear gameplan, ordering matters a lot, you have to know what rng card generation give you the best chances, etc. The aggro matchups are actually pretty tricky. They dont have as much defensive tools as big priest.
---
In comparison, big priest has a very linear gameplan. Usually it only plays a few cards per turn. They are mostly playing with only cards in their decks. They dont play a lot of minions, so they have to do less trading than aggros. Look at the the top 10 big priest lists on hsreplay. The mulligan winrate of barnes is as high as 73% to 80%. With mulligan your chance of drawing it on curve is 37.85% going first and 37.95% going second(vargoth also has a very high mulligan winrate). The deck is way too highrolly. Losing to barnes on curve feels like shit as it takes no skill to play.
---
yes
---
Lol there's no decision making vs warrior.. they won't play minions till the end, if you play a board, they can easily wipe it.. you just go face, and try to do it early before turn 5 brawl.
---
They didn’t even take the time to realize that Vessina wouldn’t bounce up and down, seeing as she slithers
---
I will look into it tomorrow
---
This is what renomage is doing in wild
---
UN'GORO BELONGS TO THE TITANS!
---
Can someone explain how this makes him win? He's just destroying three low-cost enemy cards for 3 draws and -10hp?
---
No one hates a thing more than it's "fanbase" after all.
---
I totally forgot about that. Following along as people got close was a lot of fun.
---
Constructed had the rat race to legend which was fun while it lasted.
---
&gt;Mage and to a lesser extent hunter require you to make decisions and plan turns.
---
AHHAHAHAHAHHAHAH, you have to be trolling right?
---
Idk if that's much better. Gives them a huge health pool to magnetic a lot of minions onto it, could become really sticky and a way to attack with a minion that would originally only have rush.
---
nah i dont think so mountain giant can be deal with if its alone since the opponent gets to develop board while u are drawing cards but because of conjurers calling there are way too many giants to deal with
---
it doesnt have to be literal exceptions but limitations, ex: barnes summons a 1/1 copy of minion that costs 5 or less.
---
Put down the salt son.
---
even without giants they are still pretty strong tho just not as consistent as mountain giants but still strong
---
looks great. colored it quickly: https://i.postimg.cc/cC7kY88k/Untitled.jpg

Forsaken was a playable race in wow, it might seem like semantics but forsaken are people, IMO undead would’ve been like happy ghoul and other monsters. But that’s one of the issues with the tribe I guess it’s hard to define

If you get Syl out early it's def a counter. You just steal everything and the rezzes do nothing. Nine lives and the 1 Mana spell make stealing easy.
---
&gt;I (and, from what I've seen, a fair portion of the Wild community) would appreciate a Big Priest nerf.
---
*I (and, from what I've seen, a fair portion of the Wild community) would appreciate the nerf of "insert whatever card in meta decks here"*
---
There you go. You can stand by your opinion anyday you want because there s nothing to agree or disagree with that.
---
in a nutshell, your post can be conclude with "personally, I don't like BP", as I said before.
---
More reliable is Bob's card that says "Discover a Spell in your deck.  Reduce its cost by 3 this run" or whatever
---
They have to sprinkle in those words otherwise this community takes statements for fact and just runs with it. 
---
“B-B-BUT HE SAID-!!!”
---
Renolock. Many variants of the deck, can tech against most of the meta, has quite high skill ceiling
---
Rush should also prevent the minion from staying frozen.
---
What a click bait 
---
What a liar
---
What a shitty video
---
Just use the top winrate on hs replay, there are always different options for the deck, like conjurers calling differnt secrets, this list runs torch and apprentices and should do fine. Your deck is obviously a budget version and that won't cut it to get higher ranks. ### Mage

Why exactly do you call bomb warrior a forced archetype but velen mind blast isn't? Is printing any spell damage card blizzard forcing burn decks? Is printing any charge card blizzard forcing face decks? 
---
Cards can come in packages. The bomb cards are a package. You make the decision if you want to play it or not. If you just want every card to be individually strong then go play arena.
---
lol why are you getting so hot and bothered by people saying Quest Mage sucks to play against?
---
HolyDarkness#2520 Eu 80g trade quest

I crafted the mage deck, and its pretty high roll,

In retrospect.-
---
You're probably new to Hearthstone
---
&gt; Yeah ok it's easy to make shit up but where is the threads?
---
Why the fuck is her veracity even in question, here? She's a reputable member of the community who would have actually experienced this as it's relevant to *her* specifically.
---
I get it if you want a source but sort your life out if you're seriously questioning the possibility of a gaming community exhibiting sexist traits.
---
&gt; I just find that hard to believe personally that there are threats out there claiming she is effectively shit at arena even though the facts clearly say the opposite.
---
This was before those facts were released. 
---
*Listen* to what people are saying.
---
&gt; I can't be wrong or right because I just want to see the history and evidence and will happily support the view she has given when that's provided but I'm not about to just blidnly jump on this hafu bandwagon because she made a couple of tweets about a game she no longer plays.
---
No one asked you to jump on the Hafu bandwagon. If you're going to be such a cynic and a needless sceptic, go look it up yourself.
---
Wow. I got 3 legendaries. Zero golden. Not even a golden epic :/
---
No. This is clickbait bullshit and you shouldn't refer to "cancer" as a metaphor for a card game.
---
0/10 shitpost.
---
You can play Brightwing every turn starting turn 3 if you get lucky enough
---
Tbh, Arena is starting to look healthier all things considered (including budget).
---
The general collection building tip is:
---
- Build Odd Paladin on wild and ignore standard for a while. Save gold, dust, everything;
---
- When a new set hits, get ~70 packs + open packs until you get a legendary (pity timer);
---
- After one year, you'll have a decent standard collection when the next rotation comes*.
---
- Instead of using dust freely to craft a handful of meta decks, be extra stingy and stick with 1-2 decks because the devs are acting like headless chickens on panic mode, nerfing, buffing, adding new cards, etc. (essentially resetting the meta several times a year), which can make a lot of safe crafts (or even decks) a waste of dust.
---
*Classic Collection is on the fence, since they are stripping as much as they can from classic on their "save the game" desperation. The idea is slowly build up with classic packs and craft obvious legendaries like Leroy or Edwin.
---
Generally speaking, I wouldn't advise anyone to spend hard-earned cash on the game at least for a couple financial reports. It looks bad enough.
---
Brightwing will see constructed play sometime in the future in some dragon deck. It's at about ysera's power level.
---
It does look solid... should I use dust to snag Mal’Ganis? Or open GvG packs to get other stuff?
---
Man I want another expansion like Karazhan. The theme is just so great and goofy.
---
Yes
---
Sweet Leroy.
---
Brightwing will most certainly see a lot of constructed play in any control dragon deck, dragon warrior? Fills the curve, not terrible stats and replaces itself
---
The current quest Mage is probably the most skill-intensive deck that is viable. For fun but bad decks, I had a lot of fun with a Reno Mage (with cards like Medivh to apply pressure), you can adapt the standard Nine Lives Hunter to wild with Explosive Sheeps to clear the board. Dragon-Mind Blast Priest is very flexible and fun.
---
That’s it’s! Thank you. Wow, I feel pretty silly. But I’m glad I know now.
---
They do, but then big priest tends to take a dump on whatever deck you want to play unless it's aggro
---
Why don't you include Priests in the tiers anymore?.
---
Oh, okay. I didn’t know that, I guess I thought my account was linked to a region. Thanks!
---
Stealth nerf to woodcutters axe.
---
Your rush minions get +1 attack.
---
This is how you get gnoblins.
---
I dont get it
---
I unpacked Golden Illidan last night so make this happen.
---
All the Priest decks have low play rates, so their win rate values have variance that's too high for us to be comfortable with.
---
Unless I missed something, it doesn't. Not sure why somebody would think that.
---
wtf
---
Finally cracked an Al'Akir from this week's brawl.  I've wanted to try out Big Shaman for a while but was *really* not wanting to craft Al'Akir just for it.
---
Unfortunately, I dusted most of my Karazhan cards back when I decided not to play wild lol

Pretty sure Harrison Jones *is* in the League of Explorers based on dialogue from the old adventure, even though that focused specifically on Brann, Finley, Elise, and Reno. I seem to remember Reno had a friendly rivalry with Harrison, from comments he made.
---
When the RNG factor hits u just right on the battlecry effect
---
&lt;Inconceivable!&gt;
---
Yeah but it still dies to topsy turvey --&gt; pw:shield --&gt; innerfire --&gt; sw:death so completely unplayable
---
As soon as you draw any of those duplicates (you draw 4-5 cards to start turn 1) you suddenly have a single in your deck though.
---
Reno would use a musket though.  Which hunters do use.
---
They’ve done a great job of spacing out the content changes this time around.   We have had 4 so far since ROS launched and one more on the way.  
---
ROS launch
---

---

Single player content launch
---

Upcoming classic card additions
---
What if it was " Both players discard 3 cards and draw a card for each card discarded"
---
It was very powerfull, but it was "standalone" card... Actually the opposite, you needed to play overload cards to make it busted.
---
Standalone would be something more like silvanas or ragnaros, that just by themselves are strong enough.
---
Honestly sounds like beating a dead horse. There was no reason for the cleavage in the first place.
---
"We are theeeeee, Explorer's Leeeeeague, and we are in need of Explorerrrrrrrrs,
---
Adventure we seeeeeek, 'cross land and seeeeeaaaaaaa, won't you come and join us?!"
---
“wild, what is that?”

There's plenty of girls who play games and Twitch stream, most of them aren't popular.  The ones who become popular stand out for specific reasons, and while yes, some are just because they're attractive, Hafu is also significantly better, and more dedicated than the majority of other streamers.  
---
So yeah, it's completely possible for both to coexist, but it's really annoying when incels insist 'girl gamer only popular cus girl gamer' to literally every single woman who ever streamed ever.
---
Brightwing is quickly becoming one of my favorite cards. It's just so positive and generous. Practically costs nothing at all at three manas you drop her on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a legendary creature to use later in the game. And you also get this adorable little 3/2 that can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed.
---
But more than that BW is just so positive. It comes on the board like "Let us be friends !" and I'm like "yeah BW I do want to be friend do this shit" and when he attacks he's like "I HAVE WINGS!" and I'm like "yeah they are SO FUN." He doesn't say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he's just like "why poke Brightwing?" And it looks so happy. I mean this is a little dragon literally brought to life by magic. It understands it's life is a temporary magical gift and the dude is just fucking loving it. I mean look at her face  https://imgur.com/a/iAvHhiR she's just so happy.
---
I am literally never sad when Brightwing is on board. IDK if she's gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now she is pretty chill card.
---
No.

Considering it says “join us July 1”, and they typically have an April-August-December release schedule? I’d be shocked if it wasn’t the teaser.
---
so there are now as many elises as there are dr. booms? that's pretty neet.
---
I got 2 legs, an arm, and an eye... that’s the last time I get indebted to Rocket Raccoon.
---
Who knows what secrets we'll uncover?
---
Triple Elise + Triple Boom Warrior
---
That’s probably correct, but the fact people keep bringing it up in a community made up of mostly young men and boys sounds petty at this point. IMO
---
Yea that feels way better.
---
Yeah standalone not quite the right term you’re looking for, but get what you’re saying.
---
I also think pre-nerf undertaker takes this spot, absolutely broken card beyond all belief
---
Well isn’t divine spirit inner fire a finisher. I still lose to that trash can resurrect deck every now and then
---
&gt;That's a niiiiice deck...
---
“If your deck started with only duplicates or legendaries” would make it work tho
---
The idea that “universal” cards are somehow a problem is just pure &amp; unadulterated propaganda.
---
Remember when everyone complained how the solo content took over a month to be released? Turns out blizzard actually knew what they were doing after all!
---
BUT WHO'S SIDE IS HE ON?

So maybe...
---
Paladin - Reno
---
Mage - Medivh
---
Druid - ?
---
Hunter - Shaw
---
Not sure about druid tbh but it's been a while since I've played older adventures to know which "good" character best represents druids.
---
Reno: hunter
---
Elise: Mage
---
Bran: Paladin
---
Finley: druid???
---
This is actually a pretty good idea 😊
---
The way you type suggests that English isn't your first language, so I believe you may lack the ability to understand her tone.  When she says "I think I might be better than Kripp or Trump" she says it in such a way where she is asking the question to herself, like she believes it may be in the realm of possibility, because she feels that she has skills.
---
IT'S GOOD
---
A lot of people think hs is luck based. Is it really the case though?
---
Hsreplay says secret hunter, token druid and murloc shaman are some of the best decks, much better than cyclone mage and shark rogue. However pro players disagree with it and consistently pilot shark rogue and cyclone mage to top legend. GMs like feno have said many times that secret hunter, murloc shaman only have high winrates because the deck is easy to play and they think vs is wrong about shark. It is clear that the average players cant play those decks to their full potential.
---
A lot of people have difficulty getting to even rank 5. Meanwhile dog has got top legend many times with "meme" decks like dmh warrior, apm priest, mechathun shaman. He also once got a 39 wins in a row with cubelock and 12-0 with whizbang in brawlesium. Sure some luck was involved but you cant do that without skill. Most people might not even see the lines even if they got the high roll.  
---
Hunterace won worlds with control shaman. His list ran wild pyro, acolyte, twilight drake, omega defender that no other people ran. Was that just pure luck? Kripp got rank 1 on arena leader board despite there was an entire sniper guild devoted to sniping him. Was that just luck?
---
Sure a better player can lose to a worse player because of bad luck from time to time. However if you look at long term statistic over a large sample size, I am sure the better player will always win more in the long run. It is consistency that matters when you are looking at a rng based game.
---
This is the best card of Dalaran 😂
---
Shame on you for assuming the worst in people.
---
This is the stupidest post I have seen on this sub yet
---
It's honestly astounding that for a set with such few cards, almost every single one ended up being playable in some capacity. Some like Reno even allowed for deck building that incorporated tons of new and lesser powered cards.
---
Queen Wagtoggle doesn't deserve to be a hero 😂
---
Interesting idea!
---
I'm pretty sure someone has came with this idea before, would be neat if we could get it.
---
That idea's been proposed many times before, but I don't understand why anyone thinks it would make any difference. Warrior almost never plays more than 1 mech a turn, and when they do it's usually not to rush, but to build a board presence to apply pressure.
---
Honestly, the only significant impact this would have is making the micro bot hero power much weaker and let's face it, that's one of Dr. Boom's least-oppressive hero powers already.
---
I think I might have been unclear:
---
**No, I'm talking about the maul.**
---
You didn't make any points the mail isn't relevant to.
---
If blizzard ever does reprints to introduce cards back into standard I would actually play only Reno
---
I kinda like that idea!
---
Better, but honestly, anything that massdiscards cards from your enemys hand is such a massive combo breaker that I feel it would still be way too strong.
---
*COUGH* undertaker *COUGH*

You're looking for "Tom goes to the Mayor", one of my favorite animated comedies.
---
Per Wikipedia: The show features a crude yet distinctive limited animation style made by taking photos of the cast with different facial expressions and body language. The photos are then filtered using the "photocopy" image filter in Adobe Photoshop, resulting in monochromatic blue and white images resembling Ditto machine copies."
---
I will silence their screams!
---
Fair enough. Just sounds super impulsive to dust wild cards. I figured you did not have many to begin with. As far as your sentiments towards wild, I have felt that way before, especially during the Reno Prieat, cube Warlock, combo Druid, and Kingsbane metas. 
---
Wild is rough. I don’t blame you.
---
SLAY THEM!
---
Control/midrange I currently have morlocs and a agro shaman as well as mutate shaman, mech paly mech druid and bomb hunter as well as some obscure mech priest deck to try out
---
That couldnt be further from the truth. Not to say that your "worst" is subjetive. Some people are enjoying this meta, I have seen many comments in the new expansion teaser about "oh wow new expansion already, i preffer if they delay it a bit more since im enjoying this meta".
---
You missed quest rogue? pirate warrior? cubelock? the neutral tempo package from KFT? razakus? spitefull decks? unnerfed aggro paladin, then even paladin? togwaggle druid? combo-stone?
---
But why is it's Blizzard's responsibility to prove to the community that she's good? If she is, then surely just playing and streaming consistent 10+ win arena runs would accomplish that. There are going to be idiots who insult people for no good reason everywhere in life, yet somehow the world keeps turning.

Alliestraza (or however she spells it) has managed to do just fine, why can't Hafu? Could it possibly be because of her horrendously annoying habits on stream?
---
I think people just don't want to play the type of game that Priest forces. Entomb, Psychic Scream, 8 mana Mind Control, a dozen powerful AoEs... they're just not fun to play against.
---
Priest has so many holes in their kit, and Blizz just prints outright broken shit to keep Priest somewhat relevant. Nothing quite like playing through 2 copies of Psychic Scream, then another 2 from Shadow Visions.
---
They need to bring up some of their other cards so Priest won't need disgustingly broken cards like DrakonidOP to stay afloat.
---
Is that a crocolisk?
---
Token Druid looks like the best deck for climbing currently. Its worst matchups (Zoo, Control Shaman, Mech Pally) are non-existent or extremely niche these days.
---
What is the current state of the card Lucentbark? I have it and i'm not sure whether or not I should disenchant it? 
---
Other question is if I should spend money on this game and if so, what should I be buying?
---
And the dragon decks rn are trash, therefor the card in the current meta will be trash. No good deck will be running it.
---
YES!
---
No hope for that to be balanced and fun though
---
People used to say no, but I think after Rise of the Mechs it's worth reexamination. Having more mechs in the meta has improved the value of the Magnetic keyword.
---
Might be a good balance move to just remove a keyword from it. Take off Rush and it becomes a lot less valuable in non-mech decks. Take Magnetic off it and it is basically back where it was pre-patch.
---
I mean, yeah Big Priests has its problems and it might need a nerf but videos like this are just cringy "it doesn't matter what you do, you just win".
---
&gt; "Your turn 1 is do nothing, your turn 2 is discover a card"
---
Most control decks will skip their first few turns, check Standard, especially Mage and Warrior.
---
&gt; "Yay, topdeck!" (when drawing a Shadow Word: Death)
---
Oh c'mon, he literally timely just drew a removal card, why the drama. You can draw the right cards at the right moment in any deck.
---
&gt; "Spam AoE"
---
Point me to a control deck that doesn't want to play AoE.
---
&gt; "These cards are useless until a minion dies"
---
Mecha'thun is useless until your deck is empty, any exodia deck holds useless pieces until it assembles everything, any control deck will save pieces for later.
---
&gt; "Do absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing".
---
All classes use their hero power, warriors stack armor, warlock draw cards, shaman summon tokens, druids, mages and rogues clear the opponent's minions or get some cheap damage on face. It's only obvious priest, having the best defensive hero power in the game will use its hero power.
---
&gt; "Do we demonstrate how broken this shit is?" (after playing removal cards in sequence and wiping the opponent's board)
---
Yep the deck has a lower skillcap, we know that. You could say it takes less skill than just vomiting minions on the board and pointing face or just spamming removal and freeze effects until you get Antonidas and the rest of the exodia combo, perhaps it takes less skill than playing Mountain Giant and playing Conjurer's Calling in it.
---
J.U.S.T.I.C.E DEMANDS RETRIBUTION!
---
EVIL: *Chuckles* We're in danger
---
I wonder if and how they'll bring Finley and Brann back, those are my favorite cards from LoE.
---
Looks like you just solved it. Thank you. I forgot how every single deck plays and draws 3 silences for the statues and Vargoth. And don't worry, when they die they'll be resurrected silenced too.
---
And while some people tried out a Barnesless list, including myself, he is still very very much worth it as it's a 4 mana means of putting a beefy minion in your res pool. Ofc he's still in the list. The fact you occasionally Essence a Barnes is not enough of a reason to not run him.
---
Hmmm . . .
---
It's worth recognizing that one of the ways that "Hearthstone has come a long way" is precisely in how the devs have scaled back the power-levels of 1-drops. The game hasn't added any "growers" at 1-mana since STB in Mean Streets - and it got nerfed. They've avoided adding 1-mana snowballs precisely because of the lessons learned from Undertaker, and all the rest - having to immediately answer a 1-drop, or simply lose the game, is a pretty busted effect. 
---
It's also worth recalling that the deck ran busted crap apart from Undertaker - just looking at an old list that Firebat piloted, a total of eight cards in his deck have since been nerfed (again - "HS has come a long way . . .").  Importanly, one of the cards that wasn't nerfed was Mad Scientist - it was an incredibly powerful card which retains a high play-rate among 2-drops in Wild, despite the fact that only two classes can effectively abuse it (Rogue can also abuse it, but Big Rogue isn't very popular.)
---
All things considered, I suspect that it's pretty optimistic to suggest that the deck "wouldn't be too good" if it were currently piloted on ladder . . .
---
Deathwing and noz are both worse than brightwing
---
I don't think I've experienced a less enjoyable gaming experience than playing against Mechathun priest that just Psychic Screams over and over again.
---
Whoever ok'd Psychic Scream for release needs to find a new profession.
---
Read the comment I commented
---
You did, you were correcting the guy.
---
nah
---
Right now, this is a classic set card and will see frequent use over the years. And dragon Warrior is tier 4 and will definitely use this, and with the right cards in the upcoming set that can definitely bump up to tier 2
---
You declare, in a comment on a thread in r/hearthstone :P
---
There's not good data on it, but this person seems to have done a little bit of analytics on it .
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/6vmro6/hearthstone_demographics/ 
---
Seems like a very small percentage of the market for HS are below the age of 18.
---
Ah ok yeah I can see that. But say, where do you get your stats from? 67% winrate seems abnormally high, especially for a deck I consistently see placed in tier 3/4.
---
Just wondering about other's opinion about the 2nd lab recruiter in pogo rogue... Doesn't it seem a bit greedy?
---
Against board based decks like bomb hunter and token druid, I've been playing the deck as a tempo rogue. Even if i lose all my pogos, miscreant spam is often times good enough to fight back on tempo. Against slower decks like control warrior, i like to draw through most/all of my deck before going in with the scheme against slower decks like control warrior. The in betweens, like murloc shaman and cyclone mage, i try to play as tempo rogue but i keep at least one copy of pogo somewhere in the deck or hand, cause those decks have decent value generation (and miscreant spam normally isn't good enough). I sometimes shuffle a few zilliax to stabalize against bomb warriors or rogues.
---
Anyways, my point is that the 2nd recruiter doesn't make much sense. Shuffling in pogos too early against any deck can cause you to get exhausted on cards by turns 5-8, and a single 9/9 pogo isn't gonna help you fight back against a wide board, especially when most decks have decent answers already (earth shock/toxfin, conjurers calling/ray of frost, shield slam/spellbreaker/bgh, deadly shot/spider bomb/venomizer). Saving shadowstep for barista or the one of recruiter is usually good enough to beat the slower decks anyways.
---
I've been testing lifedrinker in place of the second recruiter for some more healing, but snip snap seemed much better, as burn isn't often times the reason i lose (it's usually because i fall behind on board).
---
But didn't Aya feel like the 'good guy' of the MSOG world?  She seemed like more of a Robin Hood type compared to Kazakhus (evil wizard) and Hancho (mafia-style mob boss).  I see no reason she can't be a hero.
---
*cries in* [nether portal]

It's not capitalized though, so I like the other one better.

You are correct sir

"Learn more on July 1st" ... which just so happens to be one day *before* WOTC releases its next set on MTG Arena (with paper Magic following on July 12th)

Looks like competition's back on the menus, boyz

Theres still the [[Hellfiend]] [[Treachery]] combo

3/-/- | Choose a friendly minion and give it to your opponent.  
---
Might as well give him echo
---
"discard up to 3 cards. Draw one card for each card discarded". Easy fix.
---
I'm sorry
---
Yeah, but at least that's a deck he belongs in.  He could cost 8 and they would still play him.
---
Not op enough, should be "[1] Give all friendly minions +2 health, gain 2 armor, and 2 Mana crystals until end of turn. Repeatable."
---
I can’t for the life of me beat the Lich King. Closest I got was with a home brew deck Murdoc deck.
---
Any suggestions? Not really trying to craft cards just to beat him. I just want the free pack lol.
---
Did you listen to what she said?  She didn't say Blizzard was being sexist.  She was saying that she wished Blizzard would release their ranking information because the gaming community wasn't respecting her as a player, when she was in fact one of the best (and better than Kripp and Trump).
---
"Saying anything negative about any female ever instantly labels you as a sexist."  I criticize women all the time.  And guess what?  I don't get called a sexist.  Very strange.  It's almost like you have an agenda.
---
Illidan has been modified a few times.  The final nerf was simply to drop him from 7/6 to 7/5 (same text as today).
---
That's right, Illidan was OP with 1 more health.
---
A 4 mana 7/7 overload 2?  Like that would ever see print.
---
Wasn’t lazul a herald of the Old Gods? And that expansion had paladin stand up to them?
---
I wonder what the legendary for pally was...
---
Copypasta Mech Pally deck online. Coasted my way to rank 4 just casually playing.
---
If there are new singleton reward cards, they will most likely not or at least shouldn't be within Mage, Priest, or Warlock.
---
Granted, I'd argue the play experience of singleton decks and reward cards on both sides of the table, while at this point rose tinted, was not very good.
---
MSoG format showed this expertly. Pirate Warrior versus Reno Warlock was mostly determined by whether Reno Jackson was drawn on or before turn six. Those games were determined not really by what's going on the battlefield but more so the order of cards on the top of the deck.
---
Get ready for 3 weeks of slow, very slow, teaser releasing
---
My btag is Sporkbacon#1686.
---
I'm not on a lot, but I'm happy to help folks out with quests.
---
Added you
---
Yeah, that would be strictly better.
---
Still convinced it will be a Halls of Origination or a Mogu Vaults themed expac, seems fitting the LoE would go to those places.
---
My guess for the 3rd will somehow be involved with Rag (maybe kelthuzad, malganis, kazakus, lich king, jaraxxus, one of the old gods ((hopefully yogg but probably c'thun)) aswell) they will be the real evil villains of this expansion. Pipe dream but i totally think they will bring rag back for sure.. they have to at some point hes too iconic and a cash cow
---
*porpoises

"Thanks for the insects"
---
I actually asked Mike Donais on his recent streams about time stuff, and he said the infrastructure isn't there to have Nozdormu mode or tavern brawl.
---
I have 4 wins in a row going first.
---
Lol, I dunno if you actively managed to to that, but huge congrats.
---
yes.
---
Why does r/hearthstonecirclejerk even exist at this point?
---
Interesting how everybody sees the Legendaries as belonging to different classes. If I had to guess, I would go:
---
Druid -- Elise (night elf + she "commands the plants in Un'Goro to assist her in fight")
---
Paladin -- Finley (Paladin used to have a Murloc theme, unlike any of the other classes)
---
Mage -- Reno (no duplicates was made more of a Mage/Priest/Warlock thing during Gadgetzan + Reno is featured on the Mage Spell "Forgotten Torch" much like Rafaam was on the Warlock's "Curse of Rafaam")
---
Hunter -- Brann
---
No problem! 
---
When struggling between picking “to” and “too,” think about it this way; are you going somewhere or are you talking about a lot of stuff? 
---
I have *too* much stuff. 
---
You use “too” when you’re describing having a lot of something. 
---
I am in *too* much pain. I have *too* many video games. I am writing *too* much. 
---
Think of the extra “o” as being exasperated. “UGH! I have *TOO* much homework!” 
---
“To” is generally used *to* connect two different nouns. 
---
I go *to* the store. I listen *to* the man.  
---
And of course, “two” is a number!
---
Can I just say that I haven't noticed the length of time between expansions because of how well they did this set. Good job folks
---
Thanks I conceded every time I got close to five this month and hit rank 2 last season to ensure I would be guaranteed a shot at doing this!
---
Don't get me wrong he's a douche but he's a bit right tho why are you playing casual with your full blown meta deck? I hated ppl like you so much when i started playing back then and practicing in casual mode.
---
NINE MANA NINE SIX!!!!!
---
Time to start hoarding coins
---
Damn, I didn't realize legend was in the top 0.25%.  I'm trying to get to top 5% in smash and it's been such a trial... I guess the fact that HS is F2P is a big difference, but still
