I went against the top 2 guys with crazy openers back-to-back 4 times

Shaman has a strong early game with Galakrond rushes and battlecry effects and high roll into 8 Mana evolve.  It has a strong mid game with even more rushes, overload mechanics  or double battlecry quest.  It has a strong late game with Galakrond Turn and Shudderwock Turn.  So it has no weaknesses that can be exploited.
---
How about potion of madness?
---
I feel like the only good things priest really had (consistently) was Mind Blast which is now HoF and divine shield inner fire. 
---

---
I love Priest but divine inner fire has always felt bad to play since its so dull to fight against.
---
i'm just happy all the battlegrounds posts are gone
---
wow man, that's extremely lucky, u/593shaun said it best. Out of 35 legendaries you got 14 (and the galakronds) lucky you!!
---
Mom: We have odd paladin at home
---
Odd paladin at home:
---
And the history repeats... how many times we had shaman being op at the start of the expansion and then nerfed to shit?
---
Yeah, I get that... but it sure goes against the idea of wishing for the perfect card.
---
You can also imagine new cards might come into the game, entirely new types of cards. Whether or not Zephrys will be able to handle those is entirely based on whether they keep maintaining his code.
---
Man I thought it‚Äôs Chillmaw üò´. Its been too long.
---
Would the card be better if it had the conditional that you had to already be Galakrond for the buff? Or is the efficiency just too busted?
---
You sound like a Shaman/rouge main, lol jk. But really preist had 2 decks that were good . Big priest was nerfed and made way too slow and combo has been hit or miss for a while and the new expansion didnt even add anything worth while to the deck. Priest got the metaphorical shaft on this expansion for sure comparatively to the other classes. Even comparing the galakrond decks priest has the worst one early but the strongest in the late . But the problem is getting to turn 9 means you are probably already dead or almost there. I am not complaining, I can see why people would ' cry too much', they gave all other classes some form of aoe, hard removal other tools they never had and priest doesn't really have an aggro or a strong enough early game.158
---
I'd say that has the panache required for the job. Well done!
---
I think this gotta happen once in a while in an RNG based game, but yeah, would be better if it didn't add itself.
---
Faceless Corrupter 5 mana to 7
---
Corrupted Elementalist 5 mana to 6
---
Galakrond the Tempest 8/8s to 6/6s
---
Necrium Apothecary 4 mana to 5
---
Self defeating argument?! Zalae demonstrates the power of shaman and it explodes day 2. You would have to be blind not to see that the popularity he sparked day 1 ignited the flame day 2 when the stats came in.
---
Normally a deck like that would hit closer to day 3 or 4. I'm not saying it solved the meta, that would be a retarded claim. But even you admit that there was only 1 day of experimentation until the first power deck hit
---
Res priest in doom in the tomb was desperating to fight against
---
Thats clearly not what you said you idiot. You said mage is broken now.
---
Learn to articulate your point dumb fck - you're directly contradicting yourself - moron.

I mean people dont play video games to have fun

Bet it hasn‚Äôt been so great vs face hunter, pirate warrior, or DR rogue. Just don‚Äôt see it surviving in a fast meta like this
---
Galakrond Shaman
---
I dusted all my wild shit every rotation. This rotations gonna be different. I love wild, can‚Äôt wait to expand my collection
---
A RED Spy is in the base?!
---
One summons automatically and the other needs a target. You should understand this
---
This is definitely true and it‚Äôs hyperbolic to say that the prerelease streams solve the meta. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs farfetched to say that it expedites  the process though.  Without it, we may have an extra day or two of the new-release experimentation.
---
Invoke Galakrond to have Players rushing to befriend you.
---
A six week break completely transformed the game for me. I'd recommend it.
---
Your necriums and anubisaths together giving you 1 mana 13/13 charge or sometimes even more.
---
There's a legendary called whizbang that straight up gives you a random deck start of game based on the current deck recipes so that would be a good place to start if you want to play standard.
---
Are you me? It's not that bad.
---
nice goldens :D Murozond needs some work though, he doesn't play battlecries and targets are random, not that big of a threat (and he's priest)
---
If I vs any of those, you're right. It has been mostly Shaman on ladder on my end, unfortunately.
---
I think misunderstand ‚Äúpotential.‚Äù It‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs a hard word to grasp. It speaks of something that isn‚Äôt there yet. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say Dragon is bad, I said it‚Äôs not broken. 
---
Cyclone has always had some good highrolls, and it‚Äôs gotten some more. 
---
I‚Äôve played a homebrewed cyclone mage mostly this season and it‚Äôs gotten me from 9 up to 4. (I‚Äôm a Legend player for reference, I took a few months off and I‚Äôm just coming back.) 
---
The meta is far from settled and even more will change with balance updates. Lists are far from refined. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is keep your eye out for it. I‚Äôm pretty partial to my list and it‚Äôs done me well so far.
---
Of all the things wrong with shaman currently, generating additional shudders isn't one of them. Not compared to 16/16 rush and a free arcanite reaper. Especially since they're 9 mana so you play 12 of them over 2 turns. 
---
Maybe if the meta becomes so heavily control that surviving the second galakrond is feasible for most decks. But not right 6.
---
Can confirm that I do this fairly often as a paladin
---
I always get two savagery from that dragon that gives one cost spells. :(
---
Both cheat cost duo combo are considered busted within its rotation.
---
I said the exact same thing in another thread &amp; was downvoted to hell lol. No excuse for this card to still be in standard, when it's only used for OTK combos, which Blizzard has said numerous times that they don't like.
---
Yes, but it is possible, but it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll be able to return and do anything you want.  You‚Äôll need to complete dailies, and it might take a few months to catch up without spending.  If you‚Äôre willing to accept that, you should have no problem.
---
In April, 3 sets are rotating out, so I would be working for the next few months towards then‚Äî collecting 6 sets of card is hard.
---
As for meta, a set launched last week, and nerfs are coming this week, so it‚Äôs a little unknown.
---
Also consider playing wild, where you‚Äôll have more cards.
---
This. Most GK decks dont even run anything that could bounce Shudderwock back to hand. If they turn a 2/1 rush into a 6/6 thats fine, if they got a 5/4 with rush instead Shudder would be even more powerful lol
---
&gt; the people brandishing stats to justify their position aren't looking to have their minds changed because they're just here to yell into the void. 
---
Yeah I'm definitely picking up that vibe, have people telling me Necrium Vial is bad when it's literally in two top 10 legend decks, from the responses I've gotten you would assume everyone here is Rank 1 Legend.
---
&gt; In the meantime I've got decks to counter and it's a pretty good spot to be as a brewer imo. 
---
It's always a good time :) I remember the last weeks of the previous expansion just dominating with my custom Quest Paladin.
---
Not to mention before that silence combo was pretty good during RoS, and wall priest was oppressively t1 for a few months before rotation, and gallery priest had been at least decent since BP.
---
There's also a brand new f2p mode called Battlegrounds that is extremely fun and easy to learn.
---
None feel any better tbh. I‚Äôve had nothing but dr rogue today at it‚Äôs just as frustrating
---
It has a 43% wr id hardly call that potential.
---
Not the only problem, just the main problem. Then comes apothecary, and then faceless (imo).
---
From what I saw it looked like one of the dragon shrines in Dragonblight which is an area in Northrend. Sind was revived much further north of Dragonblight.
---
It's not a bug but that does not mean that it should be player error. Sure, Zeph only would give you it if you had lethal on board but that's not what Zeph's description says. Zeph's description is "discover a perfect card". If you've been running through this reddit, you would know that that's not actually what Zeph does but if you haven't, and don't exactly understand how it works, you wouldn't know what you had to do. If it says "perfect card", you may assume it means "perfect card"
---
You have become they very thing you swore to destroy
---
yeah. the decks it ends up in might not be overpowered always, but definitely not the design blizzard wants to push.
---
Close but it gave charge to the minions when they were played. Your card text was actually a proposed nerf before blizzard just nuked it instead
---
This happened to me yesterday, had a full board of 7 with this, and opponents MCT stole only deathwing. Still won
---
Not really. For one it's slow, does nothing the turn you play it Hearthstone has gotten faster and faster especially in wild this card just doesn't cut it. This card used to be fun if not competitive before defile was released and the devs nerfed it because of the potential interaction. Now with the way the deathrattle sequence works it doesn't work with spirit singer umbra like it used to where before it would generate a full board.
---
If you want to play something similar but basically better in every way you can play a discard warlock that focuses on discarding cruel dinomancer and resummoning that into a full board. [[Cruel dinomancer]]
---
Last time it was a problem was actually test subject OTK priest, which was almost universally hated by the community.
---
You can always just play Wild. You can use your old cards there and there are some good cheap decks. 
---
Standard is Shamanstone atm till the nerf hits in like a few days.
---
It's at all ranks. That's exactly the deck OP is talking about.

Again, current win rate has nothing to with potential. That‚Äôs not what potential means. 
---
Secondly, I feel like I‚Äôm 6 months back. Understand what your data aggregate site means. It‚Äôs not the end all. There‚Äôs a large error in the data that isn‚Äôt even discussed. (And if you want to disagree, ALL data has errors. Data is much better when it‚Äôs error is accounted for)
---
I think part of it is jealousy that some people get to play early.  A meta can‚Äôt be solved by 20-30 people playing against each other (and most were playing battlegrounds in the days before the xpac anyway).
---
I've been playing face hunter a lot the past few days and have never felt Zilliax to be a problem or difficulty for the deck. Its three additional damage you need to get through, or worst case scenario, you dont draw your spells, six. Not a big deal for that deck.
---
Shaman? I've blown every shaman I've played against out of the water. Who cares if they play two 8/8s with rush on 7 when you've already got two 7/7s and two 11/10s and 20 damage from hand. The only things that seem to counter Rogue are good Pirate Warrior openers and really bad draw rng.
---
Please tell me I am not the only one that tried to remove the dust from my screen near the 'n' in 'don't'
---
Card draw is awesome and the health damage is negligible in the games current environment.  Easy to heal if need be but even if not your game isn't often decided by the fact you were a bit of health behind - it's almost always decided by board state.  
---
Thus the more cards, the more odds of a good board state.
---
LIVE INSECT!

SuperNinja#29169 EU 80g quest trade. I'll show you go first

I miss his laugh the most
---
Then the game would become boring like last year in year of the raven.
---
well. they did it for primalfin in battlegrounds, without any ingame explaination. discover and random cards not discovering themselves would be such a nice change to normal hearthstone tbh
---
I haven't had that issue. It's mostly been hunter with a little warrior peppered in.
---
I believe they're trolling you.
---
It's terrible practice to immediately Nerf or buff stuff after a day. For one, people will often exaggerate how unfair something is because they'll be mad, and also, they need time to figure out if there's other options that are better/counters. It would be even easier to make balance mistakes if they changed the cards after people's first impressions. In this case the first impressions were right, but nobody should expect them to immediately put out a patch after a day
---
Roxas#1781 NA. Trade 80 gold quest
---
Bro this would still lose to Shaman lol
---
It is so nice to see no snip snap on that list at all.
---
In one hand its frustrating demolished by shaman, but in other hand if my homebrew deck somehow can beat it, there is a spark of joy inside
---
And I thought I hated holidays!
---
Hard to say, really.  I imagine they want the galakrond deck to not require a specific archetype to go with it, so overload synergy kind of limits that.  
---
1/1s would be still pretty decent, but would slow it down a fair amount.  We'll have to see what happens.
---
We've all been there. The other day I queued up against another standard deck... So I didn't realize I was in wild until my 2nd game.
---
Did not play around devolve. 0.o
---
Never said minions? sand breath says hello friend. 1 mana for divine shield and 1/2 worth of stats. Used to be 2 mana for 2/2 and shield. Uldum got pharaohs blessing. Good? nah. Class identity? yes. tbf, rise of shadows didnt have divine shields. They tried to push A. dragonpaladin and B. secrets. secrets were also part of paladin for a while so this expa gets a checkmark too. Rastakhan sae shivallah, challenger, thekan, all thematic cards for its identity (timeout and ray too)  Boomsday. Annoyo, secret, kangor . shields everywhere. WW? gargoyle and charger. Literally every expansion sees some support to the core mechanics of Paladins class, and sometimes expas even add support for a new archetype like boomsday eith mechladin, but these new decks are also fitting for the identity. (secret pala also a good example)
---
I recall a friend calling it flamewanker back when it was in standard.
---
IE although it's winrate is low, it's cheese play involves ignoring what the opponent is doing to win out of nowhere as in all decks that end up being degenerate
---
Haha I hate you leper spammers
---
But remember anecdotal isn‚Äôt actuality and most people here are high ranks where this scumbaggery becomes increasingly common.
---
Yeah I realized how bad the screenshot was after I took it. Ill make sure I take better ones with more information in the future.
---
&gt;Old school patron had sub 50 winrate outside legend iirc but is still the strongest standard deck there's ever been (I think)
---
oh my sweet summer child: the deck was good but to say it's the strongest standard deck ever is beyond silly

Random Undercover Shaman Player: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing great with My Dragon Priest deck. I don‚Äôt know what people are complaining about.‚Äù

It has lifesteal. Beneath that cute bronze exterior is a soul sucking monster that doesn't just want to kill you, it wants to consume you
---
Midrange Shaman from ONIK, after the nerf to Rockbiter.  Had only one bad matchup (Freeze Mage).  And that was only slightly unfavorable about 45-55).
---
Both are viable. The Barista is straight gas, a versatile value engine. The DQ is new and more single-purpose, but still useful.
---
My uncle who may or may not work for Blizzard (and who may or may not even exist) told me that the nerfs were already done and ready to roll out today. Then Deathrattle Rogue happened.

shhhhhhhhhh. Don't let people know. We dont want people running taunt. Taunt is cheat.
---

Pure Paladin, if built right, is not a bad deck.

and can only be use on wild format/mode

BeeeTrAyYedd you

Hearthstone has class identities where magic has color identities ie druid has ra  mp, warrior has armor, mage has the best burn, priest has the best removal etc.  A game where every color/class has equal access to everything would be boring.  The galakrond issue some people have is that galakrond is an uneven cycle of cards.  By creating a cycle of cards that are extremely strong that only some classes have access to, they've pushed those classes above the others in viability.  The most recent cycle that excluded a color in MTG I can think of was the angels in Avacyn Restored, and they weren't meta defining iirc.
---
Thrall doesn‚Äôt dance well.
---
Well cubelock didn‚Äôt really get punished by silence at all
---
Wait, Renolock is Tier 2?? How come?
---
Make it a 4/5 that gains 4 attack if they have a dragon. A 8/5 is much easier to deal with then an 8/8 and a 4/5 is better for the non-dragon matchups so the card is more consistent and less binary.
---
Faceless corruptor to 4/3 
---
Galakrond shaman 8/8 with rush to 8/8 without rush
---
Corrupting elementalist 5 mana-6 mana
---
Sweet, did mine with face hunter
---
Yea. A shadowstepped Flick can really fuck your day.
---
Kneel before me.
---
I had an Uther potrait which was mixed up with the Whizbang portrait. Looked liked Uther on drugs XD
---
I played one game of Face Hunter today. I faced a Highlander Mage opponent. I ignored his board and went face. I won on turn 7. 
---
Then I took a shower and played Battlegrounds instead.
---
That is how it is supposed to work.  Every deck can‚Äôt be 50‚Äì50 against every other deck, but even if it were possible, it would be the worst Meta ever, since deck choice would become irrelevant.
---
Priests problems are directly tied to the prevalence of rush mechanics. Priest needs boards to do damage to opponents face. With so much rush out there, Priest can‚Äôt afford do any face damage whatsoever. Even healing minions feels horrible since what‚Äôs the point of faceless corrupter takes that minion down. 
---
Priests hero power is essentially used for healing face now. And, sad as that is, this is Galakronds biggest downside: losing that 2 mana hero heal is a huge deal.
---
Yeah lets all just play Shaman then dickhead
---
What's inside the cube, even more nightmares? XD
---
Wait. You're telling me that the quest where you effectively brick your first 5 turns should only be good at midgame and have no endgame? 
---
If i get to fatigue as a Quest Druid, I should have a good chance of actually winning. 
---
Personally I've been enjoying double Alex/Ysera/Zeph when it gets to that point of the game. 
---
Hell, Elise+Zeph often will be enough to stabilize leading up to the fun.
---
 I believe the max value that is achievable of anything in HS is around ~2.1 bil, the game just doesn‚Äôt work if it goes past that. Not entirely sure how the tech side of it works
---
HOW ABOUT A NE-HOW ABOUT A NEW EYE? ASSIMILATE OR-ASSIMILATE OR DIE!
---
hmm ok, to be fair by pirate warrior was talking about patches really, maybe it was not best example, just the first to come to mind.
---
Yeah, two more Nightmares.   I had three on board at one point, but had to make hand space to make sure I drew the taunt so I could go infinite from fatigue.   Never had a way to kill it after.
---
And Rexxar is a dreamboat!

and here is a great example:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/ec65q4/another_day_with_deathrattle_rogue/
---
Not really making it worse either.
---
It's trying to find you a turn 4 play, not a 0 Mana card that doesn't actually do anything to affect the board. 
---
This is more about you playing Zeph wrong than it is him not offering you something.
---
I was not familiar with Yata, cool stuff. Thanks!
---
yeah i can blame them and i do. they suck.

Congrats!

Just close r/hearthstonecirclejerk already.  We are done here.

---
That's why he's getting turn 4 options. 
---
He values Deathrattles as a low priority because on average, they are. Making a strong turn 4 play is more important.

People just still don't understand how to use him.

---
Weeks, it was nerfed weeks later, not months.
---
‚ÄúTurn it up to 11‚Äù is a cunning phrase. Many things are rated on a scale from 1 to 10, to turning it to 11 is to go beyond the normal/recommended maximum.
---

---
The reasons they're not being ran generally at the moment has nothing to do with Poacher.
---
If your deck can't compete with Galakrond Shaman, good luck making it viable, and the sort of decks that cannot compete with that deck, midrange and control, happen to be the exact space Dragon decks have almost always existed within that space.
---
They chose their path. They could choose not to be a skill less drag on the game. They could choose not make the game less enjoyable for everyone especially new players. Yet, they chose an easy win over fun. They deserve every bm any player gives them.
---
I actually disagree.  I've been playing duel paladin at rank 5 and above (below?) and due to the new 8/8 dragon legendary even that deck is performing well.  Highlander paladin seems right on the edge of being good too, it just needs shaman to get nerfed to compete since it's a pretty board heavy deck.
---
I have around 900 gold right now, I may have enough by jan, but I really hope these cards help out control decks and dragon synergy decks, since right now you could've fooled me telling me this was a dragon expansion, unfortuantely.
---
He knows it's a deathrattle, he just doesn't care. Silencing it doesn't improve the board state, it still leaves a 2/5. He doesn't know what killing it would do so will avoid that.
---
So with 0 Mana, he's trying to give you a turn 4 play.
---
I understand exactly why he was given the options he was. The person I replied to edited his comment after he realised the OP said he had 0 mana in the title.. before the edit he said OP should of gone to 0 mana to get silence.

"Coming Soon ‚Äì Galakrond‚Äôs Awakening:

---
it was already stated in the dec. 5th DoD prerelease notes that you'll be able to "collect 35 new cards" which is phrased in such a way that I'm not sure there's much room for speculation
---
Every class is annoying to fight when they are on top.  But when priest is on top, it's excruciating.
---
Ahead of the curve. Congrats!
---
Of course galakrand shaman is dominating everyone else an it'ss a pain in the ass to play against but it's nowhere near as annoying as combo priest, big priest, old machine gun priest etc.
---
Or not. In the 7 hours since you posted face hunger is the new hotness. By tomorrow morning maybe it'll be galakrand or pirate warrior. Then Reno mage maybe, or treant druid. Lol.
---
I hope this update can ease the meta up a bit, it's basically Shaman vs Aggro, it's pretty hard to test new cool decks when people are making it a contest of who can click the other player harder.
---
People say they hate control meta, anything is better than Pirate Warrior, Face Hunter, and Deathrattle Rouge imo.
---
Great post. Priest has always been the most obnoxious class to play against, it's the one class I refuse to play.
---
Spikes are going to Spike, and trying to shame them for playing as they want to play (which is to win) isn't going to make them change their behavior.
---
You can call someone a prick for playing the deck, but any honest person is going to point out you're being the prick in this situation.
---
Nope! Everypne else has a number of different strategies to actually win.
---
Highlander mage has pretty good matchups versus everything except that deck (even shaman) so you don't need to feel bad.
---
They had to take it to be able to pay the developers to finish WCIII.
---
Those sluts.
---
Face Hunter came before DR rogue, people have been running that for three days.
---
They always do.  Three lifesteal rush cards is 10% of the deck.
---
You meant 4 mana 7/7?
---
With your suggested line of play he can kill the Zentimo on the following turn. Therefore I will only be able to silence one at best. Also, playing the Invocation of Frost allows for counter play and or face damage.
---
Razakus Priest was nerfed super-fast and is one of literally TWO Priest decks that have hit Tier 1 in the history of the game (the other being DS/IF Combo which got buried under Evolve Shaman when Doom in the Tomb hit a month after SoU). Both times, they had sub-60% winrates and got nerfed far faster than the situation called for.
---
Big Priest was Tier 2 at its peak, but usually was a Tier 3 meme garbage deck with plenty of counterplay options (it had terrible winrates against 3 or 4 classes and only really won against control decks unless it highrolled against aggro)
---
The problem is the games that played out were not fun for the Priest OR their opponent. I think the Barnes nerf was the first (and only) time a Tier 3 deck with less than 50% winrate received a nerf.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also Raza was nerfed a month before it rotated, making the nerf entirely asinine and pointless. It was not going to be dominant in the next expansion because it wasn't going to BE in the next expansion. Do the most basic of research about the statements you make, please.
---
As someone else who got her back with Twitch Prime, nah
---
Deckhand says hi.
---
I think in general he is very very good he was good in the deck in the evolve meta as he basically wins the game against alot of deck if played on shirvala.
---
i miss it
---
I hope faceless corruptor keeps its attack, there are too many 5 health things that need to die.
---
Also, I hope shaman's Galakrond battlecry minions lose rush and gain taunt
---
Please everyone else hates Priest even when it‚Äôs dumpster tier. The class so shitty that it‚Äôs gotta steal your cards to use them against you. 
---
And this is all coming from a Priest main.
---
Probably when this comment is 7.5 hrs old
---
I‚Äôve read through all thing, thinking that this card was actually made by a child. ‚ÄúSummon 2 8/8, yeah sure‚Äù. It got to me only at the ‚Äúrestore 3 Health to your hero‚Äù.
---
I love when my opponent plays solitaire and then kills me in one turn by accident
---
I don‚Äôt like this argument. Like you don‚Äôt have to be a game designer to be able to critique a video game. That‚Äôs like saying you have to know how to make movies to critique a bad performance in a movie.
---
On mobile lately it has sometimes displayed my gold and dust as zero. But if I go to buy or craft something it‚Äôs still there.
---
The scalehides are absolutely necessary vs face hunter.  In fact, they plus zilliax are your only win condition.
---
lol I could be playing Rogue. It's the real op G
---
Shaman is (thank god) getting nerfed to secretary today
---
Lol
---
I hope they do something about mogu. Being able to mutate him into Deathwing, Mad Aspect is the most bullshit thing in the game.
---
Nice
---
Yeah that was nice
---
Please no. Let‚Äôs not make another shitty shoehorned archetype that barely gets any support and terribad cards.
---
Haha, couldn't agree more, but hope they don't forget Rogue.
---
Add "can't attack heroes the turn they're summoned" to all charge cards
---
It‚Äôs a straw man argument for sure and speaks to the level of intelligence of anyone that thinks such an argument is any kind of valid critique on whose opinions are valid and whose are not.
---
It is not like it happens one out of 122998 matches but aight
---
Cool but this has more legendaries in the deck than I have in my collection :(
---
You litteraly GoT lucky
---
Priests wincon is your opponent taking pity on you for playing Priest.
---
Welp, we will see if you're still eager to play it after the nerfs.
---
Congratulations! And welcome to hearthstone.
---
Well it‚Äôs not very rare actually, because it usually produces neutral dragons, and it‚Äôs more like a 1/20 ; twice
---
The one that summons three gnomes or whatever is great in conjunction with the 1 drop that lets you use hero power as removal and the 2 drop that pulls secrets from your deck. It makes face hunter‚Äôs damage inescapable and only gets beat by healing
---
This is the daily reminder why r/hs should not be used for competitive hearthstone discussion
---
Make it a 4 mana 7/7 for balance.
---
I am so glad I don't play anymore... The PTSD...
---
He qualifies for team 5
---
I‚Äôve found inconsistent success with mage (freeze spells and board clears) and better success with hunter because they have no healing
---
of course you can use it in ranked/unranked battles (wild) only
---
Honestly people can go suck a hobo joes dirty ding dong if they think shaman is broken and rouge is balanced. I main Galakrond shaman and Dragon druid and I‚Äôve won more games with Druid than shaman. Hell even my dragon paladin has been kicking ass as much as my shaman. People need to take a chill pill and let things be for atleast one full expansion and not off of the bat
---
It‚Äôs ok but would be more powerful if it filled your hand with 1-cost copies of it as well
---
Not if its the only minion in your deck!
---
Hired
---
play trash shamans to get legend and play your other decks when you reach there. profit
---
saronite chain gang died for nothing SMH
---
Sorry my english is not good, what does the phrase its nerf or nothing actually means? Thanks!
---
DQ Alex is too heavy for the current meta. 9 mana three body is not enough.
---
Come to Wild! Much more balanced (never thought that could happen) and many decent decks for all classes. Even priests have a decent deck!. And you mostly don't play against the same deck over and over except for secret mage, there are lots of them but is not as cancerous as Galakrond shaman.
---
Rogue becoming the best deck would be a trivial matter to deal with. Literally any Priest deck that ran some silence spells along with two copies of Cabal Shadow Priest would instantly ruin their game plan. Priests just can‚Äôt afford to be running such decks in the *current* climate.
---
damn son, why you afraid of a 1/1 boar
---
Thanks. Will check if I have them in my collection. Is it advisable to craft if i do not?
---
Oh yeah I forgot about that! Not an issue if you go second though.
---
Polymorph also works in the mage's favor considering their heropower, shamans can't even kill a 0/2 with their heropower, on avarage they would spend 4 mana and 3 turns to deal with a 1/1
---
Would be good if Rush was Charge, but right now, it just doesnt fit in any meta deck...
---
Nice.
---
Humility and Subdue can target friendly minions, so they could be used on the Egg for board advantage or an opponents minion for board control. Mechano Egg is equal cost to Chromatic, but with the downside of not being a Dragon, though it has the upside of always dropping an 8/8. Shrink Ray also synergizes well with the Eggs and Paladin's hero power, and would help avoid using a second Consecration/be a better board clear than it with or without any Eggs.
---
A New Challenger may be interesting, though from experience with Mage's Power of Creation there seems to be a good bit of 6-cost minions with their own Taunt so using ANC would be more about getting a copy of one with Divine Shield added.
---
There are only ~4 Dragons out of 11 in the deck that Utgarde Grapplesniper can safely summon without possibly screwing you up by missing a Battlecry. Some other form of draw would likely be better; Lay on Hands and Hidden Wisdom are expensive and possibly difficult, but may be useable. There's also Blessing of Wisdom, Hammer of Wrath, and Flash of Light -- FoL is somewhat nice as it's perfect for healing a high-health minion.
---
Glowstone Technician may be slightly better than Dragon Speaker as although it's weaker overall (-1/-1 to stats and buff) it can hit any of the 25 minions in your deck instead of just the 11 Dragons. Also obviously would work great with Eggs.
---
If it's not enough healing Ancestral Guardian could help, or maybe Lightforged Blessing as you've got plenty of big minions and it's Twinspell. Zilliax is also an option of course, though you may like to also use the new 6/4/5 Rush, Windfury in an attempt to occasionally make it a 7/7 Divine Shield, Taunt, Lifesteal, Rush, Windfury directly from hell.
---
Tirion Fordring is very good, especially when you can swing and not worry about your health as much, which I guess Nozari is a great help with (I was badly criticizing him the other day, but maybe that was wrong).
---
Cathedral Gargoyle is a 2-mana minion that gains Taunt + Divine Shield if you have a Dragon in hand that could be interesting, though it'll obviously die fast &amp; hard.
---
Farraki Battleaxe is useable if you feel like you have enough healing so it can help clear the board.
---
Redemption, the Secret, could give a nearly-dead second copy of Talritha, Fordring if you use him, or other powerful minions like Evasive Wyrm/Drakonid or Siamat. And Repentance could help with board control when you know your opponent wants to play something big.
---
Note: I don't even own many of these cards and haven't played a Highlander version of this, these are just some ideas. If you don't own any of these it's probably not a good idea to craft them.
---
Combo priest really became a thing after nerfs were directed at Control Warrior.
---
I think everyone was playing Highlander Hunter and Cyclone Mage before that?
---
Yeah, neither raven should get the buff - My guess is that ME somehow copies a relevant background attribute of my raven, that makes his 'believe' both ravens are on his side... or something.
---
What if it was like Yogg. Replay a random battlecry for every battlecry you played this game? Would it be played still?
---
What if??? And hear me out..
---
What if they fundamentally nerfed evolve/splitting (I.e. conjurers)  mechanics to reflect the cost of the minion at the time it was played. 
---
This would "free up a lot of Design space" as the devs are so fond of bringing up.
---
Plot twist: Nephew is part of team 5.
---
mutate is kinda op
---
I'm so glad I opened new Nozdormu...
---
Well done. You managed to fix Priest. You're hired!
---
I hate arena with all my strenght, it really needs to match you against people with similar cards, i have played 3 arenas with 0 legendaries. Have played against people with 2+. Fuck this game
---
#rant
---
I think when they were balancing the cards everyone f'n forgot that invoking has an instant effect.
---
Nah it was probably the best deck for extra arms got its buff reverted. They nerfed it before it really caught on tho
---
What are you referring to?
---
Trading 80g quest on NA. I show, you go first. xkcb#1811
---
Nah aggro decks are cool they arent very strong in the current meta the only strong one is face hunter which is not even close to as annoying as DR Rogue or Galk Shaman
---
&gt; in Wild also all classes have a lot of tools to deal with that
---
*cries in Warrior*
---
I mean, it depends on what you play, but Pal Shirvallah is literally destroying both of these decks. Successful with Handlock aswell, but it‚Äôs easy
---
I call it crappy because I never get Rafaam's scheme in the mulligan. Lol.
---
Lmao please not
---
I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN
---
They nerfed Patches even closer to his rotation
---
Are you playing Shaman?
---
Yes, I agree.
---
It was clearly a poor decision to frame it in that manner. That's why I deleted the post.
---
Second quest rogue wasn't that bad against aggro.
---
Every one is allowed to showcase what ever they find to be post worthy and the upvote and downvote system is there to decide what is more interesting and what isnt you dont need to be a dick about it.
---
You are not supposed to play it on curve but on turn 4 with hero power.
---
I am 3-0 against DR Rogue. Ooze and a single spellbreaker is good enough.
---
Classic packs still the way to go for new players?
---
Their philosophy is that basic and classic sets' texts should be as clear as possible without many keywords. It is a design decision.
---
**And is strong enough to take up pancakes!**
---
Don‚Äôt complain, you are playing shaman after all
---
Which is why giggling got a very deserved nerf.
---
I get that you're joking, but that nerf would not fix most of the reasons that the boar is a problem, since usually it sees play only when a deck can throw a lot of stats onto a body, and needs a charge card - any charge card, the cheaper the better - to carry those stats to the face.
---
As hilarious as a 0 attack minion with charge sounds, it actually would still be broken af.
---
Except that the decks she is in are pretty damn expensive:/
---
Taunts have 0 effect on a proper built version of this deck, and games end turn 6 before Galak, I have yet get a game that I was able to get off 2 side quests when drawn perfectly, haven't played a control warrior in ladder.
---
always kept unused epic/legendary until you really really **REALLY** need dust,you can always dis it later
---
There have been no silence priest decks in the last 2 years, if you‚Äôre saying more than 2 years ago there were multiple variants of silence priest that were different across expansions, maybe you‚Äôre right I don‚Äôt know because I don‚Äôt care about niche archetypes from 2 years ago to remember
---
Can we all agree that \[\[Shudderwock\]\] is a card that should have never existed?.
---
People complaining about priest being unfun to play against have ever had a 20+ mins wait for all the battlecries of multiple Shuds?. It absolutely kills the turn timer.

9/6/6 | Battlecry: Repeat all other Battlecries from cards you played this game (targets chosen randomly).  
---
But if he were to be holding the sun his name should have something to do with fire. How about Flamewreathed Faceless?
---
I like that we're now in a world where 4 Mana 7/7 wouldn't be that bad, relatively speaking
---
That card was literally the only priest card I actually liked, but back then there was no other card like it so it was a little bit strong at the time, I think if it was printed today it would be a very good and balanced addition to the standard set.
---
20+ minute animation, huh?
---
Always blows my mind how the shitlers at team 5 always out do themselves with worse and worse balance each expac
---
Die aggro, die!
---
Just merge the subs at this point.
---
have you actually played the matchup? holy wrath paladin has 26.5% winrate against deathrattle rogue on hsreplay  
---
https://hsreplay.net/archetypes/268/holy-wrath-paladin#tab=matchups  
---
that's about as bad as a matchup gets. in realistic terms if both players play perfectly the chance of the rogue drawing poorly enough for the paladin to win is about 3%. the rogue doesn't need to delete shirvallah from the deck with flik to win when they can consistently produce enough damage from buffed charge minions to kill the paladin before they can get to their combo turn.
---
This is why you save a board clear for turn 9.
---
1/6
---
Anduin is that quite silent white kid in the class that is usually not a problem but shoots up the hearthstone school with his death knight machine gun every once in a while.
---
Congratulations! Welcome to Shamanstone. Soon to be Roguestone. :')

And for the record I haven‚Äôt played anything but BG since it cane out IDC about shaman :)

This deck is rlly good. It‚Äôs essentially budget gally Warrior
---
*casts mutate
---
Oh no it's now r/hearthstonecirclejerk

[[Steamwheedle Sniper]] is a 2 mana 2/3 with that text from GvG so 1 mana cheaper for 1 less attack. Pretty good upgrade!

feels like budget as well.

2/2/3 | Your Hero Power can target minions.  
---
MtG also has effects that are not likely to be implemented in HS. Like, they don't have a separate Exile and Graveyard, enchantments, artifacts, lands, proper tutors, instants, and Stack manipulation.
---
Also, most Magic carda are unplayable in most formats. Like, I play EDH, and my list of playable cards is far different than Standard.
---
Dude this meme's from November
---
...but that's exactly how it works right now?
---
I‚Äôve played the matchup a couple of time, played mainly against Sham (obviously). The 2-3 times I‚Äôve went into Rogue it was a free win for me, but maybe the draw really poorly...
---
Nerfs are not dictated entirely by community feedback. They have internal data and analysts whose entire job is to make sense of it. Subjective "fun factor" and community perception matter, such as with the mind control nerf from 8 to 10 mana, but reddit has caused a shitstorm plenty of times before. This unprecedented reaction time indicates that the data is seriously skewed on their end, enough that they are confident about changes after just 2-3 days.
---
Because he probably doesn't play against shaman that much
---
Definitely. Stowaway is his stats plus summons 2 waxadreds and casts arcane intelligence. Value wise, it's stronger than ultimate infestation.
---
That‚Äôs fair. I had a good time playing an on curve Shaman with Neptulon as a weird finisher if I couldn‚Äôt get the win with Al‚ÄôAkir or just better value plays. Shaman wasn‚Äôt broken then though. Probably undervalued. But early on Shaman had a tough time beating out Warriors and Druids. Zoolock or face hunter could get you really quickly unless you teched right and played right.
---
ORANGE ARROW BAD
---
I get what you mean and sometimes i hate it but sometimes its just hilariously amazing.  I was vs dr rogue and he had a board of 14/14s and he had 12 hp.  It gave me eye for an eye and he attacked into it and died was hilarious.
---
&gt;Priest is only obnoxious because blizzard makes it that way. 
---
That's exactly what I'm trying to explain here. Of course priest has the right to contest tier 1 every once in a while like all the other classes, but when it does, it's a real pain in the ass to play against it.
---
Also I don't recall combo priest getting nerfed, it's just that reintroduction of evolve made shaman better than priest as the aggro option
---
I agree with most of the changes here, Shamans Invoked ability is waaay stronger than any other Galakronds.
---
The only reason Shaman is being played is because he can Invoke his Galakrond without losing tempo on the board. The rest of the Galakrond is kinda okay, probably have a value of around 2 mana (Rogue is getting random lackey, Priest is getting random card, Warrior getting +3 attack), but Shaman is the only one that not only play the card directly to the board and it has rush. The tempo swing is way too strong and hit way too early in the game.
---
And Shudderwock is busted as usual.
---
While druid isn't doing very well right now, I feel like it's a lot because it's held back by shaman. The tokens can't get on board against the rush spam and the big taunts while the slower versions just don't have the tools to deal with the big late game threats multiple turns in a row.
---
üëç
---
Oh no it's retarded.
---
Yes, because shaman and rogue are the unlikely underdog heroes.
---
/s
---
do you really believe that they didn't playtest this? There has to be another problem within blizzard
---
I'm playing mech Hunter at rank 11 I'm  winstreaking though so I'll be at rank 5 I'm 2.7 seconds
---
Da ba da.
---
Murozond is already played in Wild in a pretty potent deck.
---
Imo the most infuriating deck ever was Control Warrior. I legit lost interest when it was popular due to the millions of removal cards they had and just the fact that they throw Boom on 7 and it‚Äôs likely all over since they can just rush everything off the board. Could‚Äôve used that anti armor tech in that meta just to handle those times where the Warrior was 1 health left with 30 armor.
---
Lol make it a 0/1 and add deathrattle: lose the game
---
Poor Birbs :(
---
Most classes had minimal counterplay against psychic scream and that one card was what carried the deck like most priest archetypes last year. This very deck felt like "did he find his good cards? Im probably dead", it had highrolls from cloning gallery and in general wasnt too healthy because it ignored tempo and board presence. It had of course alot of difficult decisions to take but it definitely was really annoying to play against even if it wasnt the best deck in the meta.
---
What rank where you when a Shaman is wasting 2 slots on Spellbreakers? 
---
Most good decks can win if they high roll you, that's what high rolling is.
---
Nerfs themselves? No. Testing the decks to see if they work is time consuming. 
---
And getting patches through the quality control on mobile is a Herculean task, which is what the main delay is.
---
why would tentacle menace be nerfed (not complaining got less than 8 epics with this one in double)
---
What‚Äôs wrong with it?
---
Don't invent quotes.
---
I love it!
---
 Shudderwock, cause its a huge problem in future card design. Only one solution: the hall of fame.
---
Silence indeed but also pseudo silences like Sap, Freezing Trap or Polymorph. Ooze is really nice in preventing them from proccing their deathrattle through the weapon too. A lot of people play against it like they do against say a midrange Hunter. However that‚Äôs not how you should approach this MU. DR Rogue is a highroll combo deck that requires set-up turns. 
---
These is a window through which you should be aggressive and disrupt their game plan. Their first 4 turns are especially weak and should be used to whittle them down as much as you can or build a powerful board to finish them in the next two turns. If you silence their diest Apothecary, they get considerably slowed down. The Anka plan they fall back do requires yet another turn of set up. Ignore their early game 1/1s and SMOrc them. Don‚Äôt kill the 2/5. Face Hunter, Aggro Shaman and Pirate Warrior should be your best bet as the premier aggro decks. Tech-in silences as you see fit. 
---
Right now the deck is free to reign because the meta tyrant is GK Shaman and neither silences nor weapon removal help against it. The king of mass silences, Priest, is also in a terrible shape. However, once GK Shaman is removed from the equation, the meta will be a mix of the aggro decks mentioned earlier, control decks that deal with them and DR Rogue to deal with those control decks. However, the best decks will possibly be either Highlander Hunter or Mage as they are flexible enough to adapt to most MUs.
---
You've now got to make the transition  to "Rogue OP" posts for max karma now.
---
As usual Blizzard making useless announcement, they either don't say a word, or say "we will do something some time" but never any details
---
When will Blizzard learn to actually announce what they will do and WHEN?
---
This is starting to be ridiculous, i have the same feeling as when pirate warrior was ruling the ladder, how long does it take to fix this? I mean anyone with HALF a brain would be able to fix this fucking retarded shaman shit, how is Blizzard taking so much time ?
---
That's cool dude
---
"Not all who wander are lost" is what Velen says.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to this guy, he‚Äôs just jealous and not confident enough to play Paladin Paladin with the rest of us nobles.
---
Eh I‚Äôve beat mage most the time and sometimes it‚Äôs very close. 
---
DR is just beat by any deck that can just agro really. 
---
Face Hunter and DR seems to be a 50/50 especially if DR highrolls.
---
It‚Äôs not a phase, mom!
---
It's just a joke because I have it four times. If it would be nerfed I would get 3200 dust.
---
This is gonna be patches after I decide to play wild
---

Hear, hear is an expression used as a short, repeated form of hear him/her.  It represents a listener's agreement with the point being made by a speaker.

It was originally an imperative for directing attention to speakers, and has since been used, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, as "the regular form of cheering in the House of Commons", with many purposes, depending on the intonation of its user. Its use in Parliament is linked to the fact that applause is normally (though not always) forbidden in the chambers of the House of Commons and House of Lords.The phrase hear him, hear him!

we all need to start complaining about how strong it is
---
Just a joke, I have four of it so if it would be nerfed I'd get 3200 dust
---
Name one other cards that Shaman runs that has "been complained about for previous expansions" besides Mogu?
---
I imagine if you're on Team 5 implementing your pants on in the morning is difficult.
---
Did you use a card that made you immune? (Aegis of death, timeout, etc.) It seems to be coded to end when you become immune.
---
Face hunter always pops up when a combo deck dominates the ladder - it‚Äôs super consistent and arguably the easiest possible deck to pilot.  I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see a strong control deck rise from the pack. It‚Äôs only been a week so despite what people think the meta hasn‚Äôt settled.
---
That sub actually no longer has a reason to exist, because the quality is way higher here.
---
&gt; but when it does, it's a real pain in the ass to play against it.
---
Just like every other tier 1 deck. People just like to point this out about Priest in particular.
---
&gt; Deploying takes some time when Mobile's involved, although Blizzard do seem relatively streamlined on it.
---
From what I know Apple has a mandatory 24 hours delay for any update in AppStore. So, if you want to ship an update on multiple platforms, you have to submit it to AppStore, wait for ~24 hours, and submit to other platforms. An then it will be released simultaneously everywhere.
---
&gt; Doing it should be fast when it's just data.
---
Not always, at least with Blizzard. One of the mechanics for nerf/hof-ming is to create a copy of a card with new stats, and then just switch it in your collection, while hiding/deleting old. For that, they had to create a new card and update client data.
---
That's how Blizz creates brawls with the older versions of cards, etc. It's probably a mess and takes some time also.
---
They don't give them. But you can dust whatever you got. Same with adventures.
---
I got 1382 from rogue shenanigans. But it never gave me the card back.
---
Day 1 golden craft. It's even good enough for Wild.
---
Spikes are going to Spike. They play to win and derive their fun from the game specifically from winning. 
---
There's nothing you can do about it, and calling them "bad people" for wanting to get as much enjoyment out of the game as they possibly can at the moment isn't making you look any better.
---
I highly doubt it, but deciding what numbers to change, trying to balance the meta while people will still be able to play the decks they want, is the hard part. If you see the ridiculousness Reddit comes up with, it should be clear that it isn't something that should be done overnight.
---
I don‚Äôt even want IF HoFed; I want it nerfed into unplayability warsong style.
---
hadggar lmao
---
I know this is a meme post, but as a serious answer, it's because they have a very good basic/classic set of cards.  So no matter what the expansion, Hunter will still have access to \[\[tracking\]\] , \[\[scavenging hyena\]\] , \[\[eaglehorn bow\]\] , \[\[animal companion\]\] , \[\[kill command\]\] , \[\[unleash the hounds\]\] , \[\[houndmaster\]\] , \[\[tundra rhino\]\] , and even though it's been too slow to see much play in recent metas \[\[savannah highmane\]\] .  Essentially, Hunter always has the core of an aggressive midrange beast deck, which means that's the absolute worst Hunter can get.
---
Seems like your nephew Jason designed the cards from the last expansion too.
---
Yugioh rulings were (at least back when I played) notoriously convoluted and unintuitive, basically working on a card by card basis
---

Sure thing! Based on previous research the hypothesis is as follows: the more you spend on loot boxes, your gambling will tend to be more problematic. There are also some secondary hypotheses, but they aren't as important. This is the primary hypothesis.

4/4/3 | Battlecry: Give a friendly Beast +2/+2 and Taunt.  
---
This logic is not good.
---
How many games have releases that are ass in the first week? You are applauding them for getting better when this is just unaccepted in other games and communities, yet they have probably made more money and had more players than any comparable company I can think of.
---
Im a former legend player, haven‚Äôt played this game since the beginning of last expansion just to kind of check it out, I remember the release happened so I come to the sub to gauge if people are having fun to see whether I can have some interest to play again and it‚Äôs a broken mess.
---
Yeah if Quest shaman can switch to agro and burn real fast then you are fucked with shit luck lol.
---
You realize it's ladder and you can play whatever you want right?
---
Great spot! I missed it!
---
It actually wasn't meant to be. I don't use Reddit often to post. I mostly read. When I tried to post an image along with my text, my text disappeared.
---
I still don't get how galakron is a fucking battle cry no where on the card does it say battlecry since when have hero cards ever been considered battlecries?!
---
They don‚Äôt, you were just lucky, so good for you! But I and others opened wild packs and we didn‚Äôt get any.
---
Not everyone sees the first post. I'm not the one being a dick about it
---
Easy class to design. Just give them good midrange stuff, sprinkle in a little bit of reach, synergy with Beasts or Secrets, and voila.
---
I was super excited when I first saw him and then I read the card again and realized priest got another win more noob trap legendary.
---
Haha a bit longer but not as long as the die hards. The problem with holy pal as far as I‚Äôm concerned is it doesn‚Äôt promote interactivity in any way and encourages ‚Äúsolitaire‚Äù gameplay, utilizes time out which is my pick for worst designed card, and is generally not fun to play against. It exploits Shrivalla which is an interesting card, but not because of the card itself. Shrivallah could literally be a 25 mana vanilla 0/1 (with the mana reduction function) and the deck would still function as planned. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a 7/5 rushing divine shielded lifestealer which is even more infuriating to play against. The tiger is unplayable without the combo, which is evidenced by the fact that no other deck plays it. There‚Äôs almost no counter play unless you are hard Aggro, have a lot of armor, or have flik which is a new card. 
---
Remove time out and the deck is dead, because without it the paladin will probably lose. Their winning or losing has often come down to whether or not they have drawn both copies of time out or not.
---
Holy pal is a perfect shitstorm of a deck and the fact that it‚Äôs the only deck that‚Äôs got a decent win chance vs shaman right now is very telling as far as I‚Äôm concerned.
---
I could have drawn Anka, but I just gave up after he had full board of minions
---
*People are not allowed to play tier 1 decks in ladder. Let's rope them!*
---
r/woooosh
---
It‚Äôs still by far the best deck and just irritating to play against.
---
Speaking of holy wrath paladin, I‚Äôm hoping they kill that deck eventually because ever since sarvothar I have absolutely despised it.
---
Since they introduced the old packs, there has been precisely ONE person posting that he didn't get the legendaries, compared to dozens of people who did, far more than there should have been based on the 40-pack pity timer.
---
So yes, the one with the problem then got told by Support that he wasn't entitled to the cards, but the people who do that support have a habit of being wrong, especially when they're giving the lazy answer.
---
I'd recommend you try it with one set and decide for yourself.
---
And yes, they can be dusted.
---
In the past they've always printed powerful cards for hunters but no way in using them in the current meta, but later on after an expansion their power level rises through the roof like DK rexxar, its a super broken card on paper but in the current meta when it was released it was kinda pointless.
---
 But the more cards they printed that could synergy well with hunter cards thats when the problems started to rise.
---
I dont tell you what to do.
---
Commonunisium
---
Notably how lackeys turn into 1-mana 4/4s
---
Feels like just a massive oversight.
---
Like they forgot they printed Anubisath Warbringer, because no one ever played it, because it sucks.
---
I think my biggest problem might be the spells. For a class called "Hunter" they often seem over the top.
---
Because hunter wrecks shaman
---
I just want a spreadsheet with avg. placement per hero. Something that would actually be useful. But god beware some people might realise they're not BG gods.
---
I don‚Äôt have anka so I forget that‚Äôs in the normal deck list lol. 
---
I have heist baron Togwaggle and like 3 more cards that aren‚Äôt standard DR since I‚Äôm not crafting until now a week later lol.
---
Doing god's work here.
---
seriously, thank you for this because I was tearing my hair out trying find it myself
---
Same thing happened to me. Was on off days from work and stoked to try new decks out, but this has been the most infuriating release in memory.
---
Proof I actually won :D [https://i.imgur.com/RYYjxwC.png](https://i.imgur.com/RYYjxwC.png)
---
You get then banned. Because taunt is cheat.
---
Speaking of the 1/1 Albatrosses, they count as minions from other class (for rogue card purposes) for some reason, my opponent had like infinite Spectral Cutlass thanks to that.
---
Old but gold.
---
Don't forget translations, it's easy to forget but it's not trivial when we're talking these timeframes.
---
How much of a snowflake you have to be to state that. I hate that deck as much as the other person but come on, think a little bit before bitching about it on the internet.
---
Up jucnv b
---
Fireside gathering
---
I was under the impression only playable copies ( 2 for non legendary cards ) get refunded.
---
Won't you get refunded only for 2 normal and 2 golden cards of each type?
---
You should see sir pinnus mrrgglton then
---
I need the base of this meme, it's hilarious
---
It doesn‚Äôt summon a 5/4 Rush. It turns a minion into itself.
---
Oh well in that case we should all go to you to see if every post is alright before it gets posted. After all, it‚Äôs only alright if you think it is. Anyone who says otherwise is just wrong. Jeez, the entitlement from you, Reddit isn‚Äôt just for you you know.
---
I don't necessarily disagree, but I think it's the best deck because everyone is playing it. It can't handle aggression and pressure and it doesn't have a comeback after the 8/8s. If those get countered, it's over.
---
So much low effort posts it hurts.
---
I hate Gal Sham (and refuse to play it) as much as the next guy, but you can‚Äôt expect people to not abuse the most broken mechanics on ladder, since that‚Äôs being the most competitive you can. In casual play, I completely agree tho, they are trash tier humans.
---
Maybe.. maybe stats, numbers and the voices of pro players are all lies. Dumb

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
i hope they also nerf the super oppressive [[Chromatic Egg]] which keeps ruining games. this opinion definitely hasnt anything to do with me having all the eggs in the world.
---
Looks like a jojo character to me.
---
'Spells' are just abilities. It's striking, trapping and shooting. Don't feel like that's such a thematic issue, especially given that they mostly interact with or summon minions.
---
I don't think Hunter is often over the top. Flanking Strike and maybe pre-nerf Call of the Wild are the only spells that come to mind. The only time where Hunter was really oppressive (since BRM) is when Blizzard broke class identity and gave them a source of card generation, healing and AoE in one card.
---
I feel so stupid for not thinking about this... I always instantly disenchant lol.

5/0/3 | Battlecry: Secretly Discover a Dragon to hatch into. Deathrattle: Hatch!  
---
Me go face
---
True, if they're changing the text and not just the stats
---
lmao why, i get changing titles like archmage or things that arent really names like ol barkeye but why change names?!
---
Calling them bad people makes them feel like the "underdog" against the "big bad shaman player"
---
even though 90% of this sub is just calling Shaman and anyone who plays it cancer and if you disagree otherwise YOU'RE A BAD PERSON LET ME YELL AT PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY PLAYED A BETTER DECK THAN MINE
---
The same pro players that farm Shamans with Face Hunter of all things
---
Probably so, yeah. But Vial is the extra oomf to make sure you can KO on turn 7 or before. It's the difference between 7/7 charge and 13/13 charge. Probably only need two of the latter to KO. I like having the reach in hand to finish off quickly instead of giving opponent a chance to clear my board.
---
I generally like a buffed Anka on 5 better though. An 8/8 or 11/11 on 5 that lets you follow up with potentially buffed 9 drop deathrattles is the definition of broken.
---
Take all this for what it's worth though, I've only played the deck for the last couple of days.
---
Grow up
---
To be fair the 3 mana whirlwind is actually a 3 mana swipe that you have to facetank the one you do 4 to. So it's actually decent.
---
This thread is half filled with hypocrisy.

4/3/6 Dragon | Battlecry: If you've Invoked twice, reduce the Cost of cards in your hand by (1).  
---
Blizzard:*dosent nerf any of those cards
---
Also Blizzard:You just got nae-naed
---
OTK pal is not that easy to play, the ressource management is really important, and against some decks, especially aggro, it's sometimes really hard decision making. You got wrecked so you think it's braindead, but try playing it and you'll see it requires a lot a thinking.
---
On the other hand the best deck galakrond shaman is braindead and anyone can play it and win
---
I found him really useful for any decks I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be bursting down in time, him and Reno made it relatively easy to switch over to a more control game, and Zephrys could give you any board clear you‚Äôd need if things get too out of hand. In the end it made for a lot of easy wins against stuff too aggressive or too control for me to normally beat.
---
Can't see it = stealth. Stealth = taunt ignored.
---
I didnt say people who play otk pally are the worst I said people who spam emotes and BM because they pulled off their combo are the worst
---
Hey man gz! Could you post the decklist maybe? I also play face hunter but a bit different.
---
Because there's an 8/8 attached to it.
---
Thanks
---
Basically they thought it would be good to make another shadowreaper but they took away the mechanism that made shadowreaper good. I miss machine gun priest. Felt so good using 0 mana hero power to mow everything down.
---
Now I want to play it lol.
---
Like zoom in on its face, if any tree would rape you, it would be that one üòÇ
---
Intended. Works like the Priest spell that summons a 5/5 copy from your deck. The minion is modified, so silencing it turns it back into its regular state without modifiers.
---
Squetch exists if you want to prevent that.
---
I have played alot otk paladin in the past it's not that hard. Have you even read my original post. My problem is with the OTK pally deck it's with some of the people who use it
---
You can at the very least tech against this. Silencing the Apothecary and breaking the weapon (Ooze should definitely still be played in most decks because of all the strong weapons running around) can cripple their game plan. Of course, you need to draw them, but they also need to draw pretty well too.
---
That is not accurate. The best performing priest deck is at 47% and has not a single card from DoD. The last sentence by the way explains everything needed about the Usefulness of DoD for the priest class. 
---
The second best performing deck is at a whooping 38%. With DoD cards. 
---
Priest is at its lowest winrate also in wild. 
---
Everyone with more than 50% of the games played with priest should be eligible for a full refund for any pack bought in this expansion. Is absolute and utter crap.
---
They have taunt. Me go face.
---
Sweet old days where duying on turn 8-10 was considered fast and broken. Now you die turn 4-5 and its ok. Pretty much why i left hs. And also pack prices and dust value of cards.
---
Well have you noticed a chihuahua and a great dane are the same species?
---
I mean...it did catapult priest into being the currently most played control/combo deck in wild according to HSReplay.
---
Yeah I'm not sure what they thought this deck was going to look like. Invoke cards trade power level for the bonus of the Invoke, but right now Priest is desperately fighting for the board every turn, and they don't really have time to slam down some garbage Priest minion. 
---
Most of the suggestions I've seen have been a Discover effect, though I'm not sure that really changes much though, as far as Priest's playability.
---
Broad broad statement my friend. Really broad statement.
---
Years of academy training, NOT wasted.
---
I like most of your points but Problem 2,5,6 stick out to me more than the rest.
---
The most fun I‚Äôve had is playing Albatross Priest in casual. Would you mind sharing your list? If there‚Äôs something that can hold it‚Äôs weight in Standard, I‚Äôd try it.
---
Good luck with your thesis! I wrote about the same topic, but from a business model perspective.
---
There‚Äôs been some experimentation with this kind of deck in Wild (Faldorei Strider is a 4/4 for 4 that add/ 4/4s that play themselves into your deck which saw a lot of play in Standard during its time there), however I‚Äôm skeptical of its current viability in either format.  If you love this idea and really want to play with it regardless of how good it is on ladder then you almost assuredly want Stowaway in there, but if competitive viability matters to you I would wait a couple weeks for the post-nerf meta to settle before crafting anything and then only craft an established Tier 1 or 2 deck that speaks to me.
---
Yep, when I switched to a super wide ratio screen, the overlays are plenty out to the side. And there's an eerie amount of background at the edges of the main screen and the battlefield.
---
Once shaman gets nerfed if people start playing more rogue ooze and silence will help keep rogue in check. It's just annoying right now because running ooze and silences are pretty useless against shaman so it's not worth the deck space atm.
---
You can take a look on twitch on players using priest. They have tried everything. 
---
People is not as stupid as you may think. If there is a priest deck hidden it would have been already discovered. 
---
The fact is that shitty T5 decisions have left the priest class at its worst. Period.
---
Yes. But not considerably. They‚Äôve added less than 10 (I think) cards in HS total lifespan. They axed Vanish and have us garbage and told us it was comparable. 4 mana 3/3. 
---
Honestly fuck yourself, Blizzard. That was just insulting.
---
Right now, it's not a T2 deck
---
Well we don't really know what the hero power does. If it summons oger then it definitely would not lose to shaman
---
It is currently a tier 1 deck right now as it got some great support with the latest expansion.
---
It's also a really great budget deck as there are good lists that are only \~2k dust in total.
---
I laughed out loud.
---
Don't be obtuse.
---
I'm hoping they come out with a super op one at some point as a free gift like they did with sn1p sn4p.
---
Suwa is correct.
---
Cards moving to the HoF you instantly get the full dust value, plus u can then dust them for normal dust value (400,100,50,40) if you wish
---
Cards getting nerfed you have a window (typically 2 weeks) where by you will be able to, if you wish, dust any cards for full value. You will receive no dust if you don't don't manually (or use auto dust if your holding more than 2 copies) dust the cards... This will also apply to any cards that have been nerfed that you open during the window 
---
After the window cards will revert to normal dust values
---
I haven't even touched Shaman in the last 3 months and I still believe you're a moron.
---
So anytime in the future. Got it.
---
Its called a tech card for a reason?
---
Seriously, this isn't difficult folks.  This is the least worried about deck.  Just because you lose to it, doesn't mean you lose to *this* card.  Just an easy card to bitch about.
---
Khashayar#21834 - trading 80g quest - NA. I'll show the proof, but you go first
---
‚ÄúDo you people not have Twisting Nether?‚Äù
---
- Blizzard, probably
---
It's pretty much a Nomi deck without the Nomi. 
---
Nomi decks try to blast out multiple horrors. And if those can be dealt with, then Nomi  -&gt; Seance -&gt; Nomi is the fallback.
---
low rank battles be like:
---
oh wait im a low rank
---
oh no
---
One of the benefits of being a digital card game is that you really do not have to ever ban cards.
---
Additionally, banning cards from Wild might as well mean those cards no longer exist.
---

3/2/2 Murloc | Battlecry: Each player draws 2 cards.  
---
Oh so you‚Äôre basically playing pirate warrior and you‚Äôre not weirded out how you‚Äôre 6-0 in arena?
---
I try to play everyday. Everyday I log in, face 2 shamans, they summon 4 8/8‚Äôs and then I concede and log off. Relevant is one thing. An auto win class has made standard unplayable. 
---
I know you want to climb but using a broken deck to climb means nothing.
---
How you mean? I kinda did the Dr. Strange line, but I prob could‚Äôve found something better. What were you thinking?
---
It was originally a 2018 card back but it seems they're giving it out this year as well.
---
Any link to that?
---
This brawl is focused around destroying as many gifts as possible. I've heard that priest is pretty good for this because of cards such as topsy and forbidden words, and also because you can potentially use Divine Spirit/Inner Fire on your own gift to kill your opponent. (The gift is a 0/4 minion)
---
Personally however I like to use a rather simple sacrifice zoo list that lets you kill your own gifts off fast and gain board control quickly so you can kill your opponent's gifts as well.
---
Here's a code for my list for anyone interested:

I should probably run counterspell as well right? Especially if I'm not playing mage.
---
Don't forget the nerf coming to Silverback Patriarch
---
When you've been playing this for a few years it gets boring to get the same brawl for the 4th time, even if it's this season and all that.
---
Ooze and silence did wonders keeping cubelock in check.. oh wait...
---
OTK Shirvallah players exist because of Galakrond Shaman. 
---
If you're playing Galakrond Shaman, I would spam emote as well. Not because the combo is witty, but because I want to play a different deck and can't.... because your deck is cancer and I can't wait for that nerf.
---
Lmao nobody is going to read all that
---
You mentioned it. MULTIPLE TIMES.
---
Given the amount of times he said troll, I think he was trying to be one.
---
Though spamming emotes does often come off as being kind of an asshat.  Why the guy didn't squelch though I have no idea.
---
What I hate about it is that there's no point to craft the cards needed for it since we all know it's going to be nerfed.
---
The Hearthstone team really drop the ball when things get this out of whack.
---
How are you playing silence, hex, poly, sap, or mind control on their turn? 
---
Asking for a friend.
---
The invoke power needs to change. I've seen changing it to "Discover".
---
It could also grant the random minion a buff (+2/+2), or discount its cost. But if you are spending 4 mana to play a Dead Ringer, that's a completely dead play. Even getting a "good" draw doesn't seem that good.
---
Something needs to give.
---
Yeah, but you did the line wrong!  It'd be "Blizzard, I've come to bargain." not "I've come to bargain, Blizzard"
---
you probably got the card back then
---
Self made secret mage!
---
hUrR, iM gOnNa pOsT ThIs tO ReDdiT, SuRelY eVeRyOnE wiLL bE oN mY SiDe
---
that would be awful. if a card is that big an issue then it should be nerfed. but no cards right now are that much of a problem. secret mage could be tuned down but thats it
---
Yeah I'm lowkey scared that they're just going to gut shaman after only a few days...... I mean, yeah it's strong, but like there's going to be stronger..
---
Highlander comes from the TV series and Movies of the same name where the phrase, ‚ÄúThere can be only one!‚Äù Was often uttered. It just means you only have one copy of each card in your deck. There are legendaries that require that you only have one copy of a card in order for their ability to activate. I.e Zephrys and Dragonqueen Alex.
---
Jade druid vs galakrond warlock. He may have done better if he hadn't had himself sitting at 10 cards the whole game. But two 3 mana twisting nethers later I go for lethal and only had 2/2 golems lol
---
Got a pack
---
Everybody knows that a face is the place.
---
Why ban them when you can just make them slightly worse (like they did with Barnes)?
---
Are we there yet? 
---
Are we there yet?
---
This sub will make you believe everyone is playing face hunter.. I barely see any of them when I play quest reserruct priest to farm you for a free win.
---
Yes hi um... WHAT and how?
---
Face Hunter also destroys it, but I get your point.
---
What an absolute baby. He‚Äôs clearly going through some stuff. Or is twelve.
---
Oh Noudormu, never change. You are the source of my joy - also of many many bugs
---
Good call. It's one of those lessons I learned on day 1 when I tried to use it to trigger my deathrattle. Oops.
---
this is true; i've seen cards in other CCGs comparable to their new ramp tool and it's always been broken in those other games so I'm hard pressed to doubt its power in hearthstone
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to troll or anything, but perhaps I didn't get my point across the way I would have liked to. What I meant, was that maybe they should have waited another week or so before the nerf. At first the deck was considered nigh on unbeatable, which is why EVERYONE was playing it, but counters are starting to appear. I just don't want them to completely kill it, because it is a relatively cheap top-tier deck, great for F2P players like me. Again, I don't want them to leave it the way it is since there obviously is a problem, I just don't want to see any rash and radical reactions that would essentially kill it entirely. They sure as hell weren't that quick on the draw with Druid and Warrior last year though...
---
no kidding
---
Even older
---
https://youtu.be/71AVaQI-_d8
---
mama mia thats a spicy meme deck. Also, it should definitely run Elise since it's singleton.
---
I dont need approval or kind words, i just wanted to share a ridiculously funny situation that occurred to me today. Contrary to SalkyKid im not trying to win an argument or shame him, i would've censored his name but it would've been onestly too much work for what it's worth.
---
its the wrong situation to say "ok boomer" you fucking idiot gen z kid
---
&gt; Swap out Spirit Bomb for Leeroy &amp; **Bloodreaver**
---
Considering this deck is meant to be *zoo*, i don't think a 10 cost card that revives four 3/3s is very good for this...
---
Ding ding ding
---
Actiblizz doesn't make a single decision with three benefit of the players in mind, only the shareholders
---
Umm face hunter is the second best deck right now...  Gala shaman is 59% wr and fave hunter is 57% next deck is pirate warrior at 55%.  So no several decks arent better than face hunter.  Only shaman.

### Challenge 3 day to legend
---
lol, I hadn't seen this yet, thanks for sharing, had a good laugh
---
I invoked three times as rogue. I used the 3 damage income card with a zentimo I stole from the shaman who was kicking my ass.
---
I mean, he was so dead serious i cant tell you if he was trolling or not.
---
Confusiong and Hilarious.
---
Blade's been around with Anub, no? The problem is Apothecary.
---
ok
---
is it really Deathrattle if the deck relies on like 2 or 3 deathrattle minions though?
---
My own list, had spellzerker switched for Bloodmage Thalnos and a few other things, also ran kobold and leper, playing around with a new version while climbing EU.
---
Here's the code for the one I hit legend with:

oh yes, there are more degenerates like you who play it. I am facing 40% of facetards in legend, its even more then shamantards. Degenerates rejoice!
---
I hear Priest is nearing 40% winrate, they're probably concocting some preemptive nerfs.
---
i don‚Äôt like it to bring back someone‚Äôs old meme to farm upvotes
---
Damn bro, they must of been delayed or people twitter must of been trolling us.
---
How long can this go on?
---
Doesn't matter how regular the balance updates are if the game isn't fun.
---
That's why I went ahead and crafted the deck anyway since it's most likely gonna get nerfed as well
---
Very true I only have one atm so it was more a theory upto now but I think I may play around some more with this
---
Decklist?
---
People on twitter must of been trollin us or the nerfs got delayed :/
---
It‚Äôs a Deathrattle deck because it runs a lot of Deathrattle specific cards. Without that you‚Äôre just bashing into your opponent with small charge minions and playing a 9 drop Deathrattle minion. It‚Äôs the apothecary, blade, and Anka that really make the deck a lot faster, those are all specifically reliant on Deathrattles.
---
It's almost definitely "how about a new life?" Like eye makes zero sense to me
---
I know. I really need to get in on what the new cancerous deck will be earlier.
---
Heads up, they announced that nerfs had to be pushed back to tomorrow (sounds like they were indeed happening today originally).  Assuming no further delays, a fair assumption is by 2 PM EST.
---
Blizzard are amateurs
---
two degenerate facehunters found eachother, how cute
---
I'm just posting the optimised list. No need for tears.
---
Thanks for the deck! [I won on turn 3!](https://i.imgur.com/oBXyKOk.jpg)
---
What‚Äôs with the name calling dude? Are you upset because people who spend less time playing than you do are achieving the same success?
---
hired to Team5 for sure
---
Because they don't want feedback from 500,000 amateur 13 year old business managers.  What possible reasons could they give that would change your situation in any way?  It isn't passing some QC check, or they are worried and testing something, or whatever.  The fact that they didn't give us numbers yet behind which cards are nerfed makes me think they are still tuning not just checking final QC.
---
I'm more concerned about face hunter.  If that trash becomes the best deck in the game again, the state of the game will be worse than it is now.

---
Well there you go that's the max invoke you can have
---
Champs are bought individually. Sending out a broken champ so everyone buys it and then nerfing it later is just part of their business model.
---
Nerfs\* Damn mobile
---
Come to wild Galakrond shaman is there but isn‚Äôt that unbeatable.
---
YOU'LL TAKE YOUR HALF-BAKED NEW ARCHETYPE AND YOU'LL LIKE IT. Then after the cards rotate out they'll print 1 more actually good one to go with it. Paladin's class identity is getting half of an archetype.
---
That's so loooooong
---
They can't tell you what they don't know.
---
Machine Gun Priest was pretty dope and expensive
---
Info: ZelKnow was the person that posted the leaks yesterday about today's nerfs. 3 hours before the scheduled nerfs he posted this on a discord server.
---
man, it's been years since I heard that line in game
---
Except that's not true at all when you know that a good portion of the champs they release are underpowered not just overpowered.
---
Resurrect priest is cancer, I hope the class stays trash tier forever just so I don't have to deal with it very often.
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous, I think the best example is the invoke twice minion. That‚Äôs just lazy design that‚Äôs asking to be broken even looking at the set in a vacuum. Then you look at the other support shaman has for battlecries (Quest) and it‚Äôs even more crazy. The only way I feel when playing against a shaman is that the quest isn‚Äôt a build around, or a drawback. Like the rogue quest, warrior quest, and priest quest to name a few all require specific strategies that aren‚Äôt especially powerful on their own. Then the hunter and warlock quests while not hardcore build arounds have a high enough quest counter that it‚Äôs fair. 6 is far too few for the shaman quest.
---
northshire cleric 2 mana
---
I don't think you quite understand what he's saying. You keep all your cards as cards until the very moment you want to craft something. There is no disadvantage to doing so, but you may randomly benefit from a card randomly getting nerfed (or possibly some unexpected synergy.)
---
He's not advising you to generally be conservative with your dusting, but rather not do so preemptively.
---
Do people really think that bumping Apothecary by one mana takes whole day for Blizzard?
---
Probably just some random bugs in a new build.
---
I guarantee they were ready to ship some Shaman nerfs, then at the last minute realized that Rogue and Hunter were also busted.
---
Easiest change ever for hearthstone, a card should never give you a copy of itself.  Frightened flunky, this card, shadow visions, stonehill defender, etc.
---
I do the same but only against shaman
---
apothecary acts for the deck the way barnes did for big priest, and there are two of them in the deck
---
so there's your answer
---
I didnt mean you must play every day or you die xD! 
---
Well 5 legendaries and 15 epics are good...You have also the duplicates which you dust them...
---
The most important thing that I always making is crafting cards for decks at day 1
---
I think when you open the packs... return to the game after 1 week to decide which deck will you play to climb the ladder...also to see the meta...For example,i made many mistakes when a new expansion comes.. First crafting cards which will don't guarantee me a great win rate...2) dissenchant cards for dust...I can't patient... It's my problem...And i promise to myself to fix my problems to hit legend and organize my collection and deck list
---
Call Blizzard support. Must be a bug.
---
1/8th closer to a proper copy of the Golden God of HearthStone
---
just like last year (december 2018) they said wc3 would be out in 2019.
---
here we are with 2 weeks left of 2019 and they pushed it to January 2020, that company is all over the place
---
 *Assimilate or die!*
---
Thank you!
---
Does it really copy the 10/9?
---
Agreed, it just becomes way to swingy and hard to deal with
---
Well i've been doing it since the game is in beta and i start paying these few expansion because i have the money and i play that much. I just think that if u like the game, play it if u don't then don't. I don't know if u like how magic does it but i feel it's even worst then HS because i can't stand to play this game online.
---
I mean depends on many factors. Many would say to hold on to it I'm sure. However, if you're lacking dust and also lacking a ton of essential warrior Legendaries, maybe it could be worth your while to dust it.
---
I'd say hang on to it for now because nerfs are coming in so you may want to hold off on dusting it to craft your preferred lender. Plus the card might be in a deck you could play.
---
dust him for something fun, please no more pirate warriors :(
---
Gotcha, when I get more cards I might build one üòÇ
---
It's not when the changes will go live, I just want to know what the changes are.
---
It's tier 1 according to HSReplay
---
ITS SIMPLE
---
I PLAY BARNES, SUMMON BLOOD OF THE üÖ±Ô∏èAINCENT ONE, BRING HIM BACK, PLAY HIM AGAIN, SUMMON BLOOD OF THE üÖ±Ô∏èAINCENT ONE, AND AT THE END OF THE TURN I SUMMON THE üÖ±Ô∏èAINCENT ONE!
---
So..like night in katzethan and Naxxarams etc....Wtf ...paying gold per chapter...this isn't fair
---
Because it was a great game that has gotten worse over time? Hearthstone is basically a waiting room for Runeterra nowadays.
---
Think back on the past year. What has the team done that has not released in a painfully and obviously skewed meta? What makes it worse is that they then go and say stuff like "bad design is rarely obvious" which is just smug.
---
I get it. There will ALWAYS be a best deck. But when every expansion this year has included one deck that is tiers above the rest then something is clearly wrong in the back end.
---
Lmao, love that after photoshopping out the exposed rib cage they just decided to leave him with an insane hourglass figure
---
Shifter Zerus.
---
I disagree abyssal summoner is supposed to be great when you have a great hand but garbage when you have a small hand so it requires a deck to be built around it
---
Nerfing the small body is good because it makes the card more situational which is a good design philosophy.
---
What the upcoming?
---
Almost like the game has changed dramatically in the last 5 years or something.
---
That's not even accurate. There's no Rogue in there.
---
Ugh, another cardback reward. I didn't do last week's brawl because of that and I don't want to do this week's brawl either. The cardback is ugly and I already have cardbacks I like; I want classic packs. What a merry Christmas this is.
---
Lepper gnome had 2 attack at the time this meme was made
---
In standard not so strong, I mean at least make him replay the minion buffed as they are in hand, and not base stats.
---
You've got all the classic legendaries
---
Why not both
---
I don‚Äôt think it works like that.
---
Round TWO? Impossible. It's also impossible that you died on second round...
---
But the only way to get a high tier minion early is Shifter Zerus.
---
Gul'dan... versus... Gul'dan!
---
How do people get free dust if they are nerfing a card?
---
Eg: They nerf Yog, I craft h for 1600, I can disenchant him for 1600.
---
You only make dust profits when they retire to Hall of fame
---
Tyranny anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
---
Alex Storozynski
---
I feel happier not supporting Tyranny than playing a game that's overshadowed by it. 
---
Stay strong Hong Kong, Iran, Haitai, Chile, Ecuador, France and any other countries fighting for the world you want. Never lose hope.
---
It is better i won against 2 warlocks with it so must be better.
---
Yeah maybe not round two but it felt reeeeeally early, probably got it as early as possible, insane luck.
---
Kinda tough to be world champion when the world championship hasn't happened yet.
---
I doubt it was intentional, but I absolutely love it as a coincidence. Nice ear!
---
Would you rather they push it out before it's done?  We've seen what happens.
---
It's a free craft... I worded it poorly to imply they'd make dust but it's really just a break even craft
---
The power creep is real, but it feels like some cards were designed to be extra extra ridiculous even when compared to other DoD cards.  
---
"4 mana 8/8 battlecry: give the mage enough Mana to go through his entire deck on turn 5" versus the 9 Mana 6/6 battlecry: your opponent goes straight to Reddit complain about shamanstone.
---
Every day this becomes worse and worse. Just tell us something already
---
Even at the minimum wage, its better to pay for the packs than to ''farm'' golds from wins.
---
It‚Äôs op in arena
---
I'd guess it's somewhat temporary, they said they're rotating them so I wouldn't be surprised if they return in the future. In the meantime they are going to add some new ones soon
---
Yes, please tell me how op they're
---
That‚Äôs not incorrect but the difference between a 6 mana 3/3 and a 2/2 is pretty much negligible because they‚Äôre both so unplayably below-curve
---
Whenever they print strong aggro cards and synergy for hunter it becomes top tier, because the hero power is so aggressive.
---
Yes
---
Well, it was at least an okay-ish arena card.
---
it is not very popular so it flickers on and off the list but it is still on there if you filter by last day
---
 [https://hsreplay.net/meta/#rankRange=ONE&amp;timeFrame=LAST\_1\_DAY](https://hsreplay.net/meta/#rankRange=ONE&amp;timeFrame=LAST_1_DAY)
---
Wait for the nerfs
---
*DEPAAAART FOWL CREATURES!!!*
---
full circle
---
It isn't a free craft, it's just a craft. You only get full dust back if you disenchant it.
---
Amalgam removed fro the pool in battlegrounds. Whoa.
---
I think the intent of these changes are to slow shaman down enough to make other decks develop as a counter for it.
---
I'm glad they nerfed Sludge Slurper.  He was the true problem with the Shaman cards.
---
Faceless Corrupter still busted!
---
For those on mobile:
---
&gt; Hey everyone!
---
&gt; The 16.0.5 balance update for Hearthstone will be going live tomorrow. Below are the included changes, and as always, we‚Äôll be evaluating the results of these changes over the coming weeks and look forward to your feedback!
---
&gt; Corrupt Elementalist
---
&gt; Now costs 6 Mana (up from 5).
---
&gt; Sludge Slurper
---
&gt; Now has 1 Attack (down from 2).
---
&gt; Faceless Corruptor
---
&gt; Now has 4 Attack (down from 5).
---
&gt; Mogu Fleshshaper
---
&gt; Now costs 9 Mana (up from 7).
---
&gt; *Once these changes are live, players will be able to disenchant the adjusted cards for their full Arcane Dust value for two weeks.
---
&gt; Battlegrounds:
---
&gt; The Boogeymonster
---
&gt; Moved from Tavern Tier 5 to Tavern Tier 4 .
---
&gt; Mechano-egg
---
&gt; Moved from Tavern Tier 5 to Tavern Tier 4.
---
&gt; The Beast
---
&gt; Moved from Tavern Tier 4 to Tavern Tier 3 .
---
&gt; Coldlight Seer
---
&gt; Moved from Tavern Tier 2 to Tavern Tier 3 .
---
&gt; Primalfin Lookout (changed last week)
---
&gt; Moved from Tavern Tier 4 to Tavern Tier 5 .
---
&gt; Nightmare Amalgam
---
&gt; Has been removed from the pool of available minions.
---
&gt; Brann Bronzebeard
---
&gt; Has been removed from the pool of available heroes.
---
&gt; Bartendotron
---
&gt; Has been added to the pool of available heroes.
---
Both are really strong
---
the biggest news is no more Amalgam in Battlegrounds. Unfortunately those nerfs to shaman won't give enough dust to let me try another deck.
---
I might be behind but I was under the impression random 10 drops weren't significantly better than random 8 drops
---
Straight up removing Amalgam and Brann from battlegrounds is going to shake things up a lot. Doesn‚Äôt stop murlocs much probably.
---
nice Mogu buff
---
You stand by your mistakes. Have an upvote!
---
Amalgam just straight removed xD
---
I predict that it'll be like control warrior after the Dr boom nerf from 7 to 9. Good but not the best. Somewhere between tier 1 and tier 2. Im also surprised necrium apothecary wasn't touched. I can see deathrattle rogue and face Hunter dominating
---
&gt;Shaman and rogue will still rule the rest of DoD
---
35 new cards at January without counting other balance patches after the holidays.
---
Thanks for the changes! Battlegrounds looks like it will be changed big time with no amalgam.
---
The salty tears this announcement will generate are going to sustain me for thousands for years.
---
seriously though, if they weren't nerfing Rogue, what the fuck took so long?
---
That‚Äôd imply that there‚Äôs something that was changed beyond just a few numbers though, wouldn‚Äôt it? Don‚Äôt know if they were planning on releasing something else alongside the nerfs or not.
---
these nerfs are a joke. shaman still going to be broken. nothing about rogue or priest. going to stick which bgs
---
Mogu 9 mana. Let's fucking go boys!
---
Oh man, Apothecary went unchanged huh? Same for Phase Stalker. Face meta here we come.
---
Sad akalli noise\*
---
what do think of the Mogu buff?
---
That's basically 8 nerfed cards out of 30 for the current version of Galakrond Shaman. Should balance things out for a while (hopefully).
---
No significant nerf to 5 mana 10/12, Galagrond still is auto win. 
---
It'll make Shaman a bit weaker but probably not enough. And also, while the Fleshshaper change is a nerf, with Evolve  it's in some situations going to be much stronger than before.
---
Hah. I just played an Albatross Quest Priest in Wild while playing Renolock. He went all-in on the Albatrosses and shuffled 20+ of those fuckers into my deck.
---
I won.
---
[[Corrupt Elementalist]]  
---
[[Sludge Slurper]]  
---
[[Faceless Corruptor]]  
---
[[Mogu Fleshshaper]]    
---
Two of the nerfs that should've been here before the expansion dropped, sems like the problematic cards will still be there and other classes are scot free for now, good to see something happening, see you people on the Battlegrounds.
---
All Shamans to All Rogues. Whee.
---
Battlegrounds at least got a pass, albeit a half-assed one. Will have to see if Mechs can get enough momentum to put a dent in the all Murloc all the time meta.
---
BG changes feel way more meaninful and impactful.

---
7/3/4 | Rush. Costs (1) less for each minion on the battlefield.  
---
What a joke, so shaman will still be the dominating tier 1
---
After reading the comments, yeah I guess I am no legend yet. 
---
I just gotta stay positive and try again next expansion.
---
The only reasoning for not nerfing the 8/8s is because they might face backlash from not getting dust from the nerfed galakrond even though it was free.
---
Clarification: they are removing Hero Brann and replacing him with Bartendotron.  Minion Brann is still there.
---
Actually hitting face with minions early in the game is better, cause they can taunt later.
---
You save your hand burst for lethal
---
Oh!
---
i use whizzbang to do my quests.
---
i only have 1 deck, galakrond shaman pepega
---
Combined with Seer and Lookout moving up in tiers, it'll send Murlocs back down to hell. Of course Amalgam's removal is also gonna fuck with the other tribes , so there's that.
---
My only way to explain this set of balance changes is that they want to tune things very slightly and see if that makes a difference in the current meta and if not they‚Äôll bring out the sledgehammer.
---
Should probably add that I do like the nerfs overall though, especially Mogu.
---
Battlegrounds with bigger changes than standard, who woulda thought
---
Well, yes : P
---
But not only is that at least of month of more stagnant bs but these cards are already power creeping so the only way the 35 new cards will make any impact is if they keep worsening the pool.
---
Shaman now kind of dies to Aggro more so than before.  And the Mogu non-game high roll is gone.  It's a nerf, but by no means a nuke from orbit.  
---
Crazy that they left Deathrattle Barnes alone for Rogue though.  Design-wise, that has no business being in the game.
---
Wow you are playing such a similar deck as i play in wild :O
---
Holy Goddamn no more amalgam in battlegrounds!
---
Nightmare Amalgam leaving is really gonna shake up the meta, but only if the Murloc nerfs are enough to make it so any other strategy is viable without Amalgam.
---
Friendship ended with battlecry, now deathrattle is my best friend
---
Nothing to Necrium Apothecary. Looks like Rogue will be reigning supreme.
---
with what they've done for Shaman this year, those new cards will probably buff Shaman even more
---
No buffs for priest? Good to know, i will pass this exp, thank you!
---
Hall of Fame Shudderwock.
---
I wish you'd just put glacial shard for Invocation of Frost and given it rush.
---
I like the shaman nerfs because the deck deserves to be playable, this is heavy hits without maiming.
---
Would of likes some rogue nerfs though but maybe next patch.
---
[removed]
---
Removing Nightmare Amalgam from Battlegrounds kinda stinks. I understand why they're doing it (it's by far one of the best cards in the format), but it's also what makes Menagerie-style play really possible. Builds will be so much more paint-by-numbers without it, with limited ways to shift tribes effectively.
---
Can‚Äôt believe nothing to apothecary.
---
"Proactive" = testing cards before releasing them
---
"Reactive" = realizing you've released a set with no balance testing and have destroyed ladder, scrambling to avert disaster before the holidays
---
"Inactive" = Evolve will rotate out soon!
---
So they \*have\* improved, but this is not proactive.
---
Roguestone incoming
---
Note that it is the Brann hero, not the Brann minion, that got removed. Murlocs keeps double battlcry bagrgl &amp; primalfin.
---
Yeah, I guess I overlooked Seer moving up a tier. That will make them MUCH worse in the early game.
---
There is nothing intresting to find sadly
---
WE DEATHRATTLE ROGUE NOW BOYS
---
At least it will be delayed to T6 when you have Syphon Soul in my case. T7 Godfrey for warlock also. And T8 Twisting.
---
It wass the power house at T3-4 to punish aggro decks, now it will be delayed to 5-6.
---
Finish patching the game and quit trying to farm reddit karma
---
Mogu going from 7 to 9 is kind of a buff on paper. Now we get to have a turn 3-4 [Colossus of the moon] instead of turn 3 [deranged doctor].
---
Still a long time for me to not want to touch the game.
---
I'm sure someone could do the maths but I feel like the average 10 cost is slightly more powerful in terms of stats/deathrattle/end of turn effects. The nerf of 2 mana makes up for this of course but it still won't feel nice, the change that many are proposing of having the card cost whatever you okay it for would definitely help
---
Really dispointing. No Galakrond Shaman nerfs nor any buffs to priest etc. Why was I expecting team 5 to suddenly know what they were doing I have no idea.
---
some buff are needed in january if paladin and priest are far away from others (with new cards bc we can play shirv and inner fire at nauseam )
---
While people would love to see something that's been op get nerfed into the ground, it's definitely not the best approach.
---
These changes slow shaman down, still leaving them with competitive late game power, but giving other decks more of a chance to gain power against them.
---
Of course, only time will tell if they're effective or not, but props to Blizzard for coming through with some early nerfs and not over doing it too.
---
And here I thought they would have simply moved amalgam up a tier...
---
Nice, Mogu can be evolved to 10 drops now.
---
Lmao these nerfs are a joke. Pack and Galakrond weren't even touched, but Sludge Slurper at 2 attack was a menace? Even my 15 yo cousin playing the game had better nerfs in mind.
---
Similar to warsong commander, which doesn't see play. it needs a buff /s
---
Got it, also what about Veranus, make any sense crafting him, after Frizz?
---
Yeah i want to see it in a handbuff paladin
---
Well, it was (and probably still is) an extremely strong value-generator that gave you two battlecries for cheap. It's one of the reasons the quest is so easy to complete.
---
But now you can still complete the quest just as easy, you just have slightly worse board presence while you're doing it.
---
Only Corruptor and Slurper? I don't know if that is enough...
---
Hahahaha seriously
---
Elementalist still invoking twice? With rush invokes, not sure what this is fixing...
---
Looking forward to the 10 mana minions from mutated mogus.
---
Rank 15 player huh ?
---
I for one welcome our rogue overlords. Silence is back in the menu boys!
---
whats the original painting called?
---
It was one of the highest win rate cards in the game. It definitely played a big part in the deck even if it seems minimal. Same with mogu fleshshaper
---
You're right, but "how about a new eye?" Is way funnier.
---
I don't think it's enough to stop Shaman but it might take it from S Tier to A+ Tier. It doesn't stop the Electra + Dragon's Pact or Archmage + Dragon which is the big swin turns (its still 9 mana for 23/27 worth of stats and 4 taunts). 
---
Corruptor is still going to be good; two 4/4 rush minions on 5 is good. We've already proven two 5/5 rush minions is good with Oasis Surger and there's no 4 turns to get the quest up. 
---
Mogu is a welcome nerf. People can get 10 drops now but at that point you can just play Sea Giant for 1 more mana and you can't reliably do Mogu turn 3 or 4 with coin and evolve into turn 3 Tyrion or something insane.
---
Glad to see them continually updating Battlegrounds to keep it fresh because I don‚Äôt want to keep losing to Rouge on ladder for the next few months.
---
are you actually serious? the 8/8s are not the issue, the issue is how easy it is to invoke as shaman. go back to sleep mr. rank 15.
---
It's a lot bigger nerf than you think. At 2 attack it could trade with tons of 2 health minions giving the Shaman more tempo for his 1 mana. Now it's a weak token. Stats matter a lot in the first couple turns.
---
Let them cry, it's better than useless nerfs. These changes won't do anything, only thing it did was make deathrattle rouge a little bit better.
---
Don't worry, you will. It'll continue to be ubiquitous.
---
Wheres the camera? Because clearly this is a joke.
---
Pirate warrior?
---
Nice Priest buffs.  Now Priest will be able to get to that 40% winrate we've all been hoping for.
---
No Dragons pack nerf is upsetting. that card has no reasonable answer to it. its just so many stats on curve. shamans will still be eating you for breakfast all season long.
---
Sir I think you might've time travelled back to day one of the expansion. The quest variant has been proven to be worse for a long time.
---
face hunter time
---
Is that supposed to seem unlikely? Says you have 55 cards in your deck so only drawing one makes sense.
---
No dragons in any of them either!
---
Delay it again because those patch notes where fucking pathetic
---
i hope u're right
---
Lmao, such weak nerfs.
---
Worst part is not that Shaman will still be strong but that Face Hunter will continue to get more popular. Jesus Christ, way to ruin an expansion only one week into it.
---
I liked the way that amalgam gave a chance to weaker builds. Having 1-2 amalgams minions in your demon build helps a lot. Interesting to see how it will play out
---
Pretty sure it's still an auto include except for control
---
The funny thing is that with no minion on board to battlecry, it's still not really too terrible in a pinch.
---
&gt;No necrium nerfs
---
Buckle up bois, are you ready for the newest hottest cancer? Knew the hacks at team 5 wouldn't touch it
---
You're not missing out on much. It's basically just Grinch Warlock vs. People who are actually trying to have fun
---
3 if you count the indirect nerf
---
Funny because I am playing wild for free to play reasons. I only need a handful of cards every nee expansion and don't need to catch up too much after taking a break.
---
2 ? sludge slurper was a fine card. i litterally never heard anyone talking about it being op
---
But what if *they* get traded into by 1/1 tokens? Better give them rush to be safe.
---
Yea but make sure you have something to make the imp not worthless, like evil conscripter, or other minions that assault their fellow board mates
---
Warlock
---
AAEBAf0GApz4ApfTAg740AKEsQPchgOdqQPOBoniAooBiJ0DvdMC2O4Cl8sCxQmODujnAgA=
---
You gotta tech in electra to get 8 mana 23/27s
---
You should already be running 2 [[Vicious Scalehide]], and a lot of people have switched over to 2 copies of [[Magic Carpet]]. So I thought about including [[Swamp Leech]].
---
Add 2 vicious scale hide and a zilliax
---
Yeah I don't think it's a big secret that this isn't going to do a whole lot. Galak Shaman isn't going to lose so much of it's strength that it's going to be countered by any more decks (currently only Holy Wrath Pally). Virtually every single match up is still going to play the same way and hardly anyone's deck is going to swap out these cards
---
half the time it'll be  4 5/6 with taunts
---
"Sludge Slurper only has 1 attack?!  But how will trade him into a 1/2 minion now?!"

---
No Cobalt Guardian Change for Battlegrounds? Mechs are already the best tribe in battlegrounds, with the murloc nerf and amalgam removal they will be even stronger.
---
Cobalt Guardian needs to be moved to Tier 4/5
---
yeah but the goal in tavern brawl is to have fun not win
---
Sorry, are you suggesting moving Mogu Fleshshaper to 9 mana is a BUFF?!? 
---
Let‚Äôs say that the average cost for Mogu Fleshshaper to be good would be that it would have to cost 4 mana or less. A 4 mana 3/4 minion with rush is decent. Before these nerfs, this meant we had to reduce Mogu from 7 mana down to 4, meaning there has to be 3 minions on the board. Now we are reducing from 9 down to 4, there must be 5 minions already in play on average for Mogu to be worth playing or putting in the deck. That‚Äôs huge.
---
Think how much easier and more common it is that there are 3 minions on the board as opposed to 5. Getting 5 minions on the board is much harder than getting 3, especially if your opponent is a slower control deck and leaves their side of the board free.
---
It‚Äôs a hugely exponential nerf because it is *exponentially harder* to get more minions on the board. Mogu will now end up sitting in your hand more often than not.
---
Only if you disenchant them. It comes out to 0 dust gained; if you have to disenchant something now that isn't extra it could result in a loss of dust in the long run
---
When rotation hits with the next expansion you can do something similar with hall of fame cards to get free dust
---
Slower decks with strong board clears do not get dumpstered by Shaman's lategame. I've played a fair bit of Galakrond Handlock and find Shaman's midgame tempo to be the hardest part of the matchup. These nerfs hit that part of their game really hard.
---
I figured it went without saying that I was talking about metas where Face Hunter is relevant in the first place, since my post was specifically about why it makes sense that Face Hunter runs the sidequest. When you interpreted my post as being about the frequency of metas in which Face Hunter is good rather than the reasons why the sidequest is a good card for the deck, I explicitly told you that‚Äôs not what I meant and clarified my point extensively. If you wanna continue having an argument with yourself about something else, be my guest.
---

---
yeah but it's not the point. i don't care if every shaman deck plays it that means it represent the class well. it's like backstab in rogue it's fine as is.

---
Lol this has got to be a joke right?  This is their answer to the mechanic issues they've created?

I was quest hunter playing against face hunter and he won purely because he rolled misha instead of huffer or the other one.  My hounds play wasn't enough damage through his one fucking taunt and he won with leeroy the next turn.
