Yo dawg I heard you like Hearthstone so I put Hearthstone in your Hearthstone so you can Hearthstone while you Hearthstone
---
---
---
Most people who care enough about winning to grind all the way to legend probably still care about winning when they get there I guess
---
I have the stupid play 12 dragons quest but I don‚Äôt have any. Also I can‚Äôt reroll so I‚Äôm kinda sad.
---
&gt; averaging between 10k-20k during non-HS events.
---

---
It's 7-10k for me whenever I watch Twitch (GMT +8).
---
I can elaborate later when I‚Äôm home.
---
how was rogue your last class to get to 1k wins? one of the most fun ones to play imo
---
You did not anonymize The Curator. He mad now.
---
I wanna know what a Jubjub bird would be in Hearthstone.
---
When I winstreak 5 ranks in a session it's pure skill
---
When I lose 3 in a row Blizzard are rigging games against me
---
Please do
---
Looks amazing!
---
Lmao sorry I didn't know it was a crime to respond with my reasoning.
---
Is there a way to know how many wins you‚Äôre at?
---
I mean to me its either they have to pick a side.
---
A. Shorter shakeups
---
B. Actually being willing to rebalance during shake ups.
---
It‚Äôd be op at 1 Mana tho
---
Yet we're stuck with quests for over another year.
---
Because it's a vocal minority?  If it's so popular as being made out that means there are a lot of people playing it.  
---
Also it's keeping resurrect priest in check and fuck resurrection.

How did your poho hoppers get so big?
---
You are making no sense. I was a new player less than a year ago. I got to rank 20 quite quickly and had a lot of fun along the way. I didn‚Äôt buy any bundles until RoS came out. My experience exactly mimics that of another new player.
---
He said 2 times a week not days, and assuming its around an hour or so, maybe less, you can complete an arena run. Being good at arena is like, the easiest way to get a collection as a f2p player, but you need to be REALLY good

Staying on tier 2 and rolling only for Pogos and Mech buffers and using hero power is every pogo.

well, a month ago...

1. Build [Murloc Shaman](https://hsreplay.net/decks/IWVgKIK1aNKnwj00T4Az1c/)
---
   1. It's only twenty-four hundred dust and pretty simple to play
---
2. Play against everything
---
3. Figure out which deck(s) intrigues you the most
---
4. Begin building towards that
---
   1. It'll probably be best to wait to really start doing that until the release of Descent of Dragons, the next expansion releasing early next month, comes out.
---
I watched Savjz for the sole purpose of getting a battlegrounds invite, but it was also pretty fun to watch

---
About to get King Anduin and Cap‚Äôn Valeera myself, even before getting golden heroes on any of the other classes üòù
---
Don't forget zephyrs
---
Fundamentally, Secrets are annoying to play against because they disrupt your turn, something very few other cards (mainly deathrattles like Sylvanas/Obsidian Statue) do. You are constantly having to assess whether it's Duplicate, or Explosive Runes, or Counterspell, or Flame Ward, or just Ice Block. Against any other deck (besides Mysterious Challenger Paladin, I suppose), you have to deal with exactly what you see, but Secret Mage is awful to play against because the secrets put the onus on the opponent to play in a certain way that they can't always figure out. It feels so bad to lose because it was Runes and not Counterspell, or vice versa.
---
At least there are counters, like Eater of Secrets and Chief Inspector, but they don't quite match up to the raw power of cards like Cloud Prince and Aluneth. The high power level of the deck and the fact that the best play is always cloaked behind the pink question mark is very annoying in a way few decks have been.
---
Naga and Barnes both got nerfed though, albeit after a very long time
---
not double legend already, you filthy casual
---
As someone who plays a Heavy Metal dragon warrior with E.T.C, this set is *extremely* my shit.

[Amateur](https://imgur.com/a/DiLdXql)

And they have a lot of different formats to show for it, while Hearthstone has Standard/Arena, with Wild being the ugly child which they barely acknowledge.
---
Like me!
---
Would like a draft at some point that gives bottom to top picks to help get people back in the game that are missing a piece to get things rolling
---
I did try to push your buttons matter of fact I‚Äôll do some more since you take pride in your pre rebok days, I started watching during the Conor era and I didn‚Äôt even get to see GSP as champ the only WW champs I knew were Usman and Woodley.

Remember when they said that the sub closing down after the drama was just one rogue mod who has since been kicked and all remaining mods value freedom of speech? Hmmmmmm
---
Well the hare is a 1/1 and the card reads summon two desert hares referring to the card itself. I think a nerf on the card is really unnecessary, because in a month the hares will be no more, and I'm sure wild won't see the hares either.
---
Oh my is this what's been happening? Glad Ive been taking a break for a few months lol
---
If an MMR system doesn‚Äôt accurately measure a player‚Äôs skill then what‚Äôs the point of having it? Right now you‚Äôre not rewarded for gradually improving at the game, instead your ranking is heavily based on the first few games you play on your account. Which is a pretty stupid system IMO.
---
They should just make wins and losses count equally at all times and be done with it.
---
GL getting there if you don't know anything else lol
---
Yeah, good players can consistently rank first at your potato mmr, but it's all rng who can get the most pogos...
---
I agree. This game is now a boring cash grab with all the girls being covered up.
---
Good Points made all the way thru, hopefully they do make it the best, #NeverToki Pepega Clap
---
Yeh I noticed haha. Okay, thank you!
---
Reno decks are really good against agro these days. You can also try jade druid if you want to keep using jades. Sniplock also beats agro but needs a little getting used to. But don't be that sniplock guy on the ladder against me please.
---
Had this happen to me in the early phases against AF Kay. Out of 7 rounds, I faced her 5 times (all 8 people still in game). I got a free loss off the damage she managed to inflict because if her advantage.
---
*Laughs in poison*
---
Surprises me Hunter is so low. My experience playing Highlander is that it is favoured vs most Shaman decks. I basically have to dead draw to lose?
---
52% winrate, nice.
---
no control warrior &lt;3
---
But that makes Sense, because Kripp one account is att THE same skillevel as Kripp om anlther account. 
---
The K-factor is high in the beginning because thr system is unsure of your player-skill due to THE low sampler size.
---
No, no you didn't.
---
Nzoth Rogue can destroy control decks
---
You,  his deck is slow and easy to counter yours not at all
---
That's an interesting read, but Deryl's strat can work with beasts and mechs as well.
---
It's easiest with murlocs but it really doesn't matter what comp you make, so long as you are good at transitioning to the later game.  The biggest problem is the timer.  Lots of times you have to plan out your turns out in about 3\~5 seconds and it's hard to adjust (if you had a chance to watch my video you would see me make a few mistakes when juggling hats).
---
I think once it's out of beta and more people play it they will realize.  Then again, I would imagine they would have to make some serious adjustments before moving out of beta.
---
Dm'd you. Thanks for the post.
---
If you are tracking, it would be helpful to post a log of rating gain/loss. Otherwise it's hard to speculate on what might be going on, if it's wrong, or if it looks right.
---
What's your username. I'll add you. I'm no good at the game. But I'll gladly let you test decks on me.
---
Depends if you play on pc or mobile. On mobile you can add friends theough the icon in the left top corner. Making good deck.. imo try some budget decks.. about buying a packs, its always best to buy the newest expansion. You need to find play style that suits you.. now, aince you are nit experienced player, focus more on enemy cards, they may give you some idea of building a deck. Look through ytb for some good decka and try to make you own later. If you are not going to pay, prepare for a longer time until you finish a deck. Its nit inpossible, its just the way the game works. Dont be afraid to play rankeds. There are mamy inexperiwnced players as you are, plus zntil you are rank 20+ you cant loose any stars and like this you can get new card backs and end season rewards at least for that rank.
---
Just to confirm, could this be because when you're higher on the ladder, your MMR compared to the players it matches you with is much higher, so a win isn't worth as much because you're versing comparatively worse players? AFAIK it's either that or what you're describing in this post (an 'MMR confidence' factor that makes your MMR much swingier at the start). I suppose it could also be a bit of both?
---
Easy way to test would be to see how much LP you lose when you come 8th vs win when you come 1st. If you lose more than you win it'd be just because you're getting matched vs. bad players, and perhaps the proper fix for that is more strict matchmaking?
---
I think you're right in any case though, 40 wins to climb from 5th to 1st is a bit crazy.
---
Never forget when they translated the city names in WoW after years of having them be in English even in the French game. 
---
Stormwind to fucking Hurlevent. What a crime.
---
When I didn't open the post I thought it's a [[Recurring Villain]]. The colors used are very similar.
---
New feature.
---
Pretty sure we already have a starcraft themed cardback, as well as a diablo themed one.
---
You guys should have all the stats right?
---
What happened in this video ?
---
Just join wild
---
That's two months too much
---
not enough of a nerf.... needs to be a 1/2 ;]
---
I'm not sure that's really the case. The light casual person who may find it hard to get to 20 packs per expansion likely won't notice the difference because they just dabble. 
---
If they ONLY cared about Battlegrounds, maybe you're right but I would hope that there is some Battlegrounds way of getting that third pick before it launches proper.
---
For the more serious casual or 100% f2p standard Hearthstone player (in both senses of that word), I don't think it's that hard. 
---
I'm a pretty casual player only playing most tavern brawls and ladder mostly to clear out the quest queue (my dad legend days are long over) and I won't even feel the impact as I'll easily have 20 packs at launch.
---
I get that won't be the case for some people just starting out or returning players that skipped one or more expansion but I get the sense that the overall pool of people that'll be negatively effected by this will be pretty small.
---
Hold yer horses. That will just kill the card outright!
---
;-)
---
MMR isn't intended to be grindable. Only way to improve your MMR is increasing your skill. If you've played thousand games but have learned nothing it should be same as in the beginning.

The warrior decks you mentioned shit on aggro and lose to everything else. Usually in hearthstone control&gt;aggro&gt;midrange/combo&gt;control
---
thank you!
---
You have 5 bwonsamdi combo priest decks, but 2 of them are identical to two others, so there's only actually 3 different decks. 
---
It makes me wonder how many of those evolve shamans, tempo rogues and quest druids are identical.
---
Maybe your opponents were much higher ranked than you and you still got to 5th place.
---
Nick#14239 NA. I'll show but you go first.

---
I don't know. The problem with dragons is that their synergy is based on "while you are holding a dragon" interaction, which can be hard to achieve early or consistently in Battlegrounds. So I am doubtful that they'd try to add Dragons to the mix.
---
Same goes for Elementals. Again, their synergy requires a "if you played an elemental last turn" to work.

The issue is getting them, I've personally never been offered one outside of a triple upgrade. RNG is RNG though I guess.

He‚Äôs asking about playing Prep before Zephyrs, not holding Prep in your hand.
---
Some wild cards came back for a limited time - there should have been an announcement when you opened the game. Check the 'featured cards' tab in your collection, you should have been given them all.

Ends on next expansion launch, I believe.

Stack overflow?

AN OIL TANKER FOR YOU
---
This might be a stupid question but isn't MMR just already figured out? StarCraft for example has a great matchmaking system, can't they just copy paste that into this mode?
---
Hearthstone is a glorified game of rock paper scissors with a smidge of RNG. 
---
Whatever deck you play will have it's strengths and weaknesses.
---
Control is Rock
---
Combo is Paper
---
Aggro is Scissors
---
Faced a shudderwookt hat managed to get a 164 Pogohopper. Unlucky for him i went full murlocs and had divineshield on all of them and on 5 poisen. I wwent 1rst place that game.
---
Imo the benefit of rag is that th e hero power can pretty much autowin or atleast tie you most fights in the early-mid game without needing as many minions. So you enter late game with a lot more hp than most. While also ramping reasonably quick.
---
opponent drew all 5 cards of Exodia in the first turn
---
What's this? 2015?

If your phone doesn't work you can always use an android emulator like memu. You can even get free packs simulating other phones (like samsung or apple)!

When you have 5 specific cards in hand you just win the game, without even playing them ?

Hey iksar, can't you just run a simulation? Should be easy if you have the formula and rules for the mmr, which I assume you do.

I played 2x Sea Giants at 3 and 2 mana to complete the quest.

Yes am trying it out now
---
You know what pisses me off...I have golden sylvanas and ragnaros and they won't let me use them in standard...
---
For whatever reason
---
Best time to play rat is right before your opponent does the comco and at that point you have less minions in hand, so the chances are not too slim.
---
Squelch emotes are/were? broken.
---
Twitch drops perhaps?
---
Sucks, but tbh that was a high roll for the guy. To draw Kun, discover a Kun, draw a Nourish, draw a Floop, and Hidden Oasis? Obviously not impossible, but sounds high rolly enough. The unfortunate weakness of Hunter is board clears so you gotta just take that L. Good thing Kun rotates in a month.
---
Yeh but from Tuesday (when BG is available to all)  until expansion drops you can only play 2 heroes.
---
There's more skill than there isn't in this game mode. If it was as RNG heavy as many imply, it would be totally random on whether you came top 4 or bottom 4. However, with certain strategies and skill, you can almost always guarantee that you have way more top 4s than bottom 4s.
---
You can‚Äôt. That I was ruin the soul of the card.
---
I posted this a month ago and got downvoted for saying "Shamanstone"
---
I still can't squelch anyone

Yea no shit, but what does that have to do woth this guys comment of attempting to help him? Sure its easy but oh downvote because you helped???
---
I wonder what would have happened if you had played it.
---
Is there any dedicated sub to Battlegrounds?
---
Yo is this why I seem to be anchored to 4000?
---
My first two games I literally couldnt click fast enough so did badly, I had a broken touchpad, didnt realise it would be so speed intensive and wasnt even aware it was ranked. So i went and got a USB mouse and came 2nd, then 1st 3 times in a row, and that only took me to just above 4000.
---
Maybe if you wasting 20 min of your life learning how speaking english, you not sound so stupid?
---
My comment is not a parent one. I wanted to add that bit but decided not to. Guess I should have.
---
No. It's terrible. It basically makes anyone hardstuck after 20 games. I was a noob and landed around 4900 in my first 20 or so games. I watched a few streams and I'm getting 1st or 2nd in 90% of my games and I've only just climbed to 5100. I'm getting less than 30 gain for a win... how long until I can even hope to be ranked #1? I'm playing with noobs and I can't get out.
---
It‚Äôs a bug that will be patched this week
---
+1 for the ‚ÄúEarth, Wind, and Fire‚Äù shaman card.
---
That's like, what, 3 weeks?
---
I'm not saying that it sucks any less. It just seems like a small issue long term for most players, that's all.
---
I think they just need to make a Mama Bear type of minion for the mid-late game.
---
Well, looks like blizzard contacted them first. I am off this thread. Your daily quest for today is to push my original comment to -150 for 30 gold!
---
Not even 69/420? Pshh
---
It would be hilarious if it was actually a hidden joke on the part of devs.
---
Hopefully, but "keeping an eye on it" means very little in Hearthstone.
---
Same but Highlander Paladin. Not the degenerate secret deck. A custom build midrange one
---
This is the wrong argument for me. I guess it all works like in chess. So if you're playing against people with lower ELO than you, that's what you get: low LP for win, while if you lose you'll get very negative LP. It just how it's supposed to be. 
---
I don't think is correct to have it your way, just because it would mean that people who spend a lot more time than anyone else would get so much LP they'd become unreachable. 
---
 I'd like to see goals to reach, like in TFT: as you progress and pass a certain ELO you get a promotion and get against stronger guys, so Silver&gt;Gold&gt;Diamond (I don't even know the real ladder here). 
---
That, I think, would be just enough for people to play more.

That has significantly less MMR, so even you own easier opponents at some point your MMR going to by skyrocketed where you will only face against good players and if you beat them, then, of course, you get even higher points. It is like in League of Legends, the best players can go 28-1 and be let's say Diamond 1, but play with high challengers.
---
I don't know why this isn't getting more attention.  Ot makes perfect sense.  As you climb higher on the MMR "Ladder" it is going to be harder to climb because there are fewer people above you to win against, and winning against people above you is the primary way to climb an MMR "ladder"

---
But it *does* appear to be doing that well.  When a highly skilled player makes a new account, the MMR system is placing them where they belong very quickly.  That is exactly what an uncertainty system is designed to do, and it combats smurfing very effectively by forcing you to play against higher skilled opponents very quickly, rather than allowing you to "farm" lower skilled opponents.
---
Once i could not play a specific deck, and it took me a day to figure out that there were somehow 36 cards in the deck
---
I'm pretty sure you meant to change its cost to 3 mana but forgot. I forgive you.
---
They will need to rotate/add units at a faster pace then they currently do with HS. Like when Trolls where the premier strat in Dota Auto-chess. It can get repetitive quickly.
---
I wish that was all I played against as my reno mage. Favoured against them but all I get is the combo/big priest matchup at 5 and 4
---
Oh! That makes a lot of sense!
---
Just add can't be reduced below 1.  Problem solved.
---
Sorry to be a pain, but do you have a link to the standard version?
---
\^This.
---
I don't care if everyone is awarded 28 points for first. As long as its consistent.
---
I don't even mind there being minor MMR adjustment.
---
My problem is that its giving out 200+ points and its 100% based on how few games they've played.
---
They're getting 9 times the rank adjustment than people who have played a ton of games. This is completely regardless of rank. The only factor is how many games one has played vs the other.
---
There doesn't even need to be an adjustment. It's a new game. That gives out points based on place finishes. The people who win more and place in the top are going to get ahead naturally.
---
The other issue is that once the MMR kicks in, it never gets higher. It doesn't matter who you play. Or the Rank difference.
---
Basically, if two people have the same MMR, they shouldn't have different Ranks. But that's how Blizzard's system works (for all their games--and to some extent, it makes sense there, where you win/lose). It makes no sense to have the double number MMR system.
---
Rank and MMR should be the same thing in Hearthstone Battlegrounds.
---
You gain an advantage for playing early, which you couldn‚Äôt do unless you Preordered cards ?
---
Meaning it‚Äôs essentially Pay To Win?? 
---
In Hearthstone!???
---
Never! I couldn‚Äôt ever believe HS is PTW that‚Äôs crazy
---
Haha i can! A lot of my job is waiting for my computer to process operations so lots of downtime.
---
That‚Äôs almost like the entirety of Australia
---
go talk to a doctor. And check in at a mental clinic while you're at it
---
So we are seeing reports of people leap-frogging their "real" account on their smurf?  Are they able to consistently stay there or do they eventually fall back down to their "real" MMR?
---
From what I've been reading around, MMR sets you to play with people around your score. Also read that you can loose/win points by doing too well or too bad in a 4th or 5th place, again depending on the rank of other players.
---
So, I guess the points you earn depend on the other ranks.
---
(I got a print screen from the first 1st, where I got +189 and I was at 4060)
---
You get more rating for winning 1st place if you have low rating. I don‚Äôt have exact numbers, but I conceded a lot when I made a mistake in the first few moves and got my rating down to 3274. A win gave me 140-160 rating.
---
&gt; Today I logged in and realized I cannot ‚Äúre-roll‚Äù my quests

Thank god... I truly believed it was the beginning of the end....

&gt;Removing the names of the fucking players I‚Äôm sitting in a 35-minute match with?
---
If his profile is "appear offline" on battle.net, his nickname is replaced with Your Opponent. A feature old 2 years at least.

This really is the kind of thread which could use an official response.
---
For a moment I thought I was on r/wow and got fucked up with this chart. Then I look up and relaxed. Only in hearthstone shaman would be so high in the meta.
---
Same bro, i finally made a good and fun deck on my favorite class (Highlander Hunter too) and, even tho i got the golden portrait, i'm still far from legend, even far from rank 5, because holy shit, so many shamans :(
---
They should do the same thing to Sorcerer's Apprentice, Radiant Elemental, and every other card that reduces mana cost.
---
I have played 12-15 games since yesterday and not a single player had their name displayed mid-match.
---
Tell ya what, I‚Äôll quit if my ass itches, and that‚Äôs a good enough reason for me, kiddo. Hopefully you can find some solace in that?
---
Yeah, it's still in standard rotation so it's unlocked yet.
---
I don't think i've seen any wild cards rotate out just slight changes or they become archived which is slim to happen.
---
Why isn't this stickied anymore?
---
Or you could just see 100% fun
---
Do you have a source for all classes getting a legendary dragon?  I must've missed that, that's pretty exciting!
---
Hey mate. The quests and nametags are bugs supposedly to be corrected today/tomorrow. Don't get unnecessary angry by this bug...
---
When it comes to murloc decks in general I would focus on getting the core big power cards, especially the neutral ones. That way whenever murloc decks are good you will have some of the same shell.
---
Stuff like Warleader, Seer, Tidecaller. Those will be in every murloc deck until the end of time.
---
For shaman you NEED slurper and angler. Those cards make shaman murloc the powerhouse that it is. Soul of the murloc is also very important if you go the token route with bloodlust. 
---
Everyone else is mostly just filler to add onto a great package. You usually don't want to cut too many murlocs as they are important to make the entire thing work. It's just up to you how heavy you want to go. You can go more evolve, more overload, or just more murlocs.
---
You sound like a pompous ass.  It's a video game.  Go play something else.
---
How good is Phaoris? He looks really spicy and fun but I don‚Äôt want to waste dust.
---
Palette = colors
---
Pallet = shipping
---
It's a bug. I would check out the sticky on the front page for more info.
---
I play for fun games not to tryhard to legend lol
---
Too bad duel and prismatic lens are epics :(
---
I somehow don‚Äôt have either yet
---
This will happen and it will be annoying.
---
Magic the Gathering looks insanely fun to be honest! It is where Hearthstone gets all of their ideas after all!
---
Murloc really shine in very late game. Divineshield/windfury/toxic if only I was still alive ..
---

---
Wholeheartedly agree. I also know exactly how long it‚Äôll take me to do my dailies so I‚Äôm happier to log on for 3 games when I have time and not need to try over and over if I‚Äôm losing
---
Its the whole point of the card lol
---
If I'm not mistaken, it's 3/14, or about 21.4%. This assumes you go first and you have no additional card draw in those first 4 turns (unlikely I know). So it's not tiny, but not reliable either.
---
To work it out, it's easiest to work out the probability of NOT getting all 3 cards (ie getting at most 2), then do 1 - the answer.
---
So, not too crazy to work ;)
---
Absolutely. Doesn't help that I run into Desert Hare Evolve every game. I was playing some other games, came back to do my dailies - and oh boy the game feels like a chore.
---
If only...
---
Last update added 15 brand new bugs
---
Maybe, but it's a lot slower to knock out quests with friends. We did the 15dmg threshold and it didn't count.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes, absolutely. People have been asking for this for ages, glad they finally got implemented.
---
Agree! Having to grind away just to win that one game gets old fast. Just knowing you only have to play x games for a quest is much better.
---
Somehow im not suprised by this strange interaction.
---
Guess every card got a default battlecry before anything that looks into combining units. Only after that the normal battlecry triggers.
---
***Consistently inconsistent intensifies***
---
Account deleted and the post is gone. /r/mildlyinfuriating
---
I'm on rank 8 currently with my quest hunter and I don't think Phaoris Quest Druids would be too hard to deal with the 1-2 Phaoris boards. Still pushing for rank 5 currently.
---
closed-beta. Noun. (plural closed betas) (computing) A testing arrangement in which a beta test version of software is distributed to a small group of testers.
---
It's not a small group. If everyone buys the pre purchase they all get access. It is not a CLOSED beta.
---
Integer Overflow not stack overflow
---
People said the same thing about Artifact.
---
This is the lull that always happens at this point between expansions. The meta gets stale, but spoiler season isn't in full swing yet. People don't play as much and they have little new to talk about. Come back in a couple weeks and it'll be a different story, the same as it is every time.
---
It is different. For the majority of other games you need to get lucky and get a key as the ONLY way to enter that beta access. Or sign up early, etc.
---
Here, you have other options.
---
Cross-posted in r/WoW ,but I love Valeera and tried to get the flowers the same color as her armor. Let me know what you think!
---
Blizzard's actions regarding China haven't helped.
---
Found out last night that conceding doesn't count. You must win or lose
---
So, if everyone bought the pre purchase bundle it is still closed? 
---
Interesting.
---
ah... thanks much i got it!
---
What's a " **Savjz** " and what does it do that would make it interesting for me ? I'm not completely sold on this.
---
Thanks! I was just about to ask which decks people would recommend building outside of the suggestion above, but I will hold off and look through the solo adventure modes to get my feet wet again.
---
Really appreciate this advice! This community is awesome!
---
0-4K: How well you play the game
---
4K+: How well you play the MMR system
---
This is how MMR systems work though. The system is more certain of your skill level as you've played more games. You'll quickly gain or lose ranking when you start and the system is trying to gauge your true skill, but you'll have to work harder to fix your gains and losses to start climbing again after you've played for awhile.
---
This thread is why Blizzard hides your exact MMR in legend and only shows you your actual rank. You nailed it, but OP wants to argue with you that he thinks he should still be gaining a ton of points.
---
But shuderwock has the double battlecry
---
Lol
---
Not sure if you're genuinely asking or making a joke lol, but if you need a reason to watch him I really can't tell you anything else than to just go watch him and see for yourself.
---
Where is legend 1 image?
---
Why is Slywick in the Menagerie?
---
Menagerie is the deck that mixes different tribes, stuff like that 3/3 mech that buffs a murloc, beast and a dragon i think
---
Primalfin not Poisoned. Garbage.
---
There is a countdown timer on the sidebar: ---&gt;
---
Nadrog#1435  NA looking to trade 80g quests.  I show then you go first.
---
oh,im on mobile thanks for the info! will look for it on pc
---
Nzoth decks are so goddamn boring.
---
First time in my life i have a legit tier 1 deck (nzoth priest) but i cant make myself play it, because it's such a disaappointment every time
---
I really don't think that the first 10-20 games on the launch of a completely new game mode is enough to determine your skill level. And besides, this system encourages to smurfing with new accounts, when you can gain huge amounts of MMR in the first games. When I started, my rank went down to 3300 in like first 5 games. It took me about 10-15 games until I started finishing consistently in TOP-4. I have played total of like 60 games, and made it to TOP-4 in 37 games and won the whole thing 8 times, yet because of the horrible beginning I have only made it up to 4600, and it's painfully slow to make significant progress. If they want working MMR system, that's fair for everyone, they should boost MMR at least for wins and second places. Then maybe add "Legend" -system after certain MMR-limit.
---
Oh yeah good point, didn't think of that.
---
i had to pay taxes to the Hearthstone development team, but, the less I know about Battlegrounds, the better I feel.
---
mainman879#1566 NA trading 80g quest
---
Yeah, now I can just tap a bunch and still win
---
It's still *from* the past even if it was allowed into Standard temporarily.
---
People are probably gonna disagree with me but, I'd suggest spending it on a meme deck in wild. It sounds dumb but it's really fun, and for me it changed my HS experience. If you really dont want to try it just skip to my last paragraph.
---
Until I tried Quest Majordomo Priest and  V-07-TR-0N mage (you can try any meme deck) I basically played to win. And like many other was frustrated with the stale meta. Then I started watching Dane (makes amazing meme decks) and really got interested in his decks. Tried one, lost a lot of games but i had a lot of fun. I've reached legend once, but the first time I pulled of the V-07-TR-0N combo was just the most amazing moment of my entire hearthstone experience.
---
But if you want to spend ur dust wisely I'd suggest saving up towards decks which be formed from DoD, then choosing one which looks fun to u. If you want to be extra safe wait a few weeks for the meta to settle too. Until then try a budget deck. Such as evolve shaman or something, pretty sure it's only 2400 dust.
---
Saints memes? Yessss love it
---
\*Stifles Laughter\*
---
I've been getting updates at least once a week on my mobile for as long as I can remember. My memory might be spotty though.
---
...That was so careless of me
---
i agree, it just became too much too often for me maybe more for me because i've been away from HS for so long i lost touch w/ everyones personalities.
---
and then there's me with nothing but warlock decks, all standard.
---
Most fun with the ralock combo, it's also my highest winrate of them all.  
---
also only one being positive
---
How good is APM priest in wild now? It was one of my favorite while in standard.
---
I might get down voted for this but personally I don't like it, when I have a quest to win I actually have a reason to try, and a reason to care if I win or not, now there's much less excitement
---
Golden versions of the battlegrounds heroes is a really cool idea.  The advanced stats tab that is supposed to be coming should include some sort of tracking by hero, so it seems pretty reasonable to implement.
---
I really don't like the idea of gating access to certain heroes, though.  It's cool that everyone starts the game on a level playing field (other than the third hero option I guess, which will be easy to get once the set releases), I wouldn't want anything that provided any actual in-game benefit to be tied to progression in the mode.
---
May I ask where is it?
---
You made an account just for this comment lol /laugh
---
Can you do that if you're on mobile?
---
"Competing with anyone else for the murlocs" what do you mean? You cant have the same cards as the other players?
---
For real? Is this a change that applies to every quest?
---
If so I‚Äôm downloading the game again for sure.
---
Pretty sure he just meant you need Thaurissan to stick for 3628790 turns to play a 3628800 mana card.
---
Ah, didn‚Äôt consider that. I had sold one of my alley cats when I got the golden tabby thanks to khadgar. Thanks for clarifying!
---
I have current update.  My game still crashes every time I try to squelch AND all my golden cards are bugged, and disappear from decks randomly.
---
How powerful would it have to be for it to be better than having that spread across three bodies?
---
Battlegrounds is actually extremely fun
---
no.
---
Well if it is the case that they were previously banned for making rude antagonistic comments like that, then it would be a tad annoying to see them shamelessly back at it again. I'm sure anyone can agree a community is generally better when there are fewer assholes posting in it. 
---
But I'm just speculating here. There's no way real way to tell someone is an alt unless they're stupid about it. And even if they are, they could have made the new account for any other reason, like you suggested.
---
Competitively *and* flavor-wise.
---
You actually do get rewards though, 10 gold for every 3 (wins? top 4s? games played, can't remember just know I'm getting gold from it)
---
It already has wild cards.
---
&gt; you need to develop a wide board so you can contest the tokens and then MC wins them the game.
---
There are multiple ways of answering a wide board without having to put 4+ minions. Like starting to put something on the board to relieve pressure int her first turns so a wide murloc board never happens, to playing spells, to playing bigger taunt minions they have to trade their board to go trough.
---
Also, just because you dislike playing against murloc decks doesnt mean they should be removed from the game. They are healthy, they offer different playstyles (not only aggro) and they arent even that predominant at all in the history of the game. You claimed stuff in your post to backup your arguments as why murlocs should be removed, and all of them have been proven wrong.
---
You have an old version and a new version, nice
---
So everyone on the r/hearthstone subreddit?
---
&gt; Open beta for Hearthstone Battlegrounds is here and open to all players! 
---
except EU. feelsEUman
---
It's rng
---
It's still not that good in my eyes. Why would you get a cover up by the same person that fucked up the old tattoo?
---
Maybe I said it a little harshly but I just don't understand the lighting choices she made, it's good of you to support your friend but maybe she should work in another field? Idk, I get that tattoo isn't the ideal medium but it looks off to me. I doodled over it with my finger on my phone to kinda show what I mean, https://i.ibb.co/1q4GLYK/IMG-20191111-224154.jpg I think you shoulda just given her money if you wanted to help out and got it covered up by someone else.
---
titlegore
---
I just picked Toki and noticed the hero power cost two!
---
To explain Zapp going from "6 -&gt; 8", apparently he was considered a 6 cost minion for Effigy purposes.  He is still Tier 6.
---
i would call a 5/12 almost worth 9 mana, and then add those broken sheeps...he actually outplayed you
---
The old tattoo wasn't a fuck up, it was done when she was 16 and bought a $20 gun of Amazon lol the old tattoo was like 5 little shitty blown out lines
---
Oh it's a Joke...and that explain the idiot part, I suppose.
---
Suicide decks shine for these quests. Deal as much damage to yourself as possible warlock quests can be done on turn 3 I believe this way.
---
They are giving away like 50k keys or something to get into the closed beta.  
---
Or would you rather have the beta not be disclosed until it's open beta? They can do whatever they want with their game
---
compared to what he could of got it‚Äôs a bit lacking
---
&gt; You are 1 card short of a full deck.
---
Maybe not the best deck list I‚Äôve ever seen.  Still, no reason to insult the kid, Blizz.
---
You're also getting the rewards of the bundle, no?
---
Yes, its either find enough +2 health in between to survive until you go to 5 and 6 Stars or bust for me.
---
So it's their try to get people to not surrender anymore? Sounds stupid
---
Dunno, I like fucked up black line tattoos. But color will age badly if not done really good
---
They also gave away like 50k keys on twitch
---
Welp, that definitely kills my desire to play COD Mobile. It‚Äôs too late for me on Reddit :/
---
I think compared to the picture it could have been a lot cleaner. The green is really dark, and the flowers look like... not flowers. It's shaped funny and the dimensions are off. 
---
That said, it's not my tattoo or my body. If I didn't have the HS art right next to it, idk if I'd feel as strongly "against" as I do now. But at the same time, if OP is happy it doesn't matter.
---
Effigy? Still confused on that one
---
Great changes all around tho i was literally talking about all of these, also 2health instead of 3 for the lich, nefarian up to 2 cost, and brick by brick +3hp
---
It's also going to get touched up next week bc my skin didn't hold a lot of the green too well the first run. And a couple spots on the petals. You're not being harsh though it's all good everybody has an opinion
---
Tried to play it on my NA account and it's not available there yet either. Blizzard needs to get their sh*t together!
---
&gt; I'm sure anyone can agree a community is generally better when there are fewer assholes posting in it. 
---
Don't be so harsh on yourself.
---
I'm not getting my once daily free reroll on quests
---
Problem for both Demons and Murlocs is that they're pretty consistently shit post midgame unless you're getting the god rolls or you're playing their designated leader AND you're getting a bunch of free passes.
---
Effigy is one of the secrets Akazamzarak can get with his Hero Power.
---
&gt;&gt;Quest cards will now display the Quest Reward when selected in the Collection Manager.
---
Woah, and it only took 8 expansions!
---
The update just now, the S-Pen still doesn't work, I'm a bit disappointed :(
---
I think the patch notes are wrong here, or at least unclear. People are saying you still get a higher tier minion on the end. I don't know why they would change the text though, unless the last minion is now totally random?
---
The way the patch has it worded can't possibly be true, an extra mana for an extra minion? You'd always just push the button twice.
---
Yeah, they finally improved this after a long time. 
---
With fewer users there is definitely more of a need to entice us by making doing the daily quest more worth the time.
---
