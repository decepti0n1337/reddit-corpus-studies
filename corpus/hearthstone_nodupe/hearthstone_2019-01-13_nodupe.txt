It's a bug. If you immediatly click a rush minion right after you summon it it can't attack...

Honestly this game is going down hill. This is the 5th or 6th post I’ve seen of some weird glitch in the past few days. I’d sell my account if I thought the hundreds of dollars I’ve invested in this and OW were worth anything. 
---
Honestly, I'd be more of an advocate for just turning jarraxus into a new hero card. Now its a staple mechanic it should be in the classic set IMO.
---
People on this sub hate aggro. 
---
It's my thoughts, you can see the same bullshit-ery in both game modes.   Though, I have moved from standard to WILD in the last month when from alpha/beta I hated WILD.    
---
Boy has my attitude changed since going WILD.   
---
But I do like invoker0169's irony in his statements though.  
---
26 damage in two turns even though you’re going to be barely ahead on board? Those’re some serious shenanigans with only a normal spell stone 
---
Then what was the point of your comment?
---
RIP OP
---
I can confirm. As a new player who posts to thread occasionally, it's crazy how many people want to down vote or make snarky remarks to people who haven't played for two years or more. 
---
It would be too much for *odd* Wild too.
---
But which one?!
---
Maybe it was turn 8 but tag not ready.. you get the idea.. and yes hunter can snowball
---
He probably means why would you show us the decklist like this. There are tons of better ways. 
---
Wait, so what did we decide on?

Yeah I heard about a year back priest got the wand of disintegration from dungeon run but 7 mana.
---
The Chinese client does. It looks neat. I'll see if I can find it. 
---
It's seen play here and there and there's always the possibility it'll see play again in the future, but it's usually part of more expensive decks. And since yours is gold, I would definitely consider disenchanting it if you're in need of dust for something useful.

That isn't true.
---
Yes, interesting matchups that are back and forth, interacting with your opponents board, as well as ressource managent. Either player could win.
---
Much better than hand vomiting, point and click fave at all costs and have games decided by who goes first/who didnt draw a 1 drop. 
---
&gt; And they said somewhere the rule would not work retroactively but I went to buy packs of all old sets and always got a legendary in the first 10 packs
---
Same here, but I'm pretty sure they fixed that after a day or so and it stopped working for people.
---
Control warrior mirror is the true control match-up. 
---
I'd go for the golden legendary. Play that intimidation game. Of course I have a golden griftah and a regular Al'Akir, so I would have gone with lightforge's pick.
---
This, and when they're done ranting, I completely ignore what they said, and tell them "Wow, you're really bad at this game" then I remove them before they can reply.

Dj Chilman- suffering from success
---
What the fuck that was in 2016?
---
At least this game still has an official esports scene
---
I know how you feel. I had this brilliant idea to cube the stealth/deathrattle rogue totem then trigger the cube before killing it thinking i would get 4 totems the enemy would keep killing over and over while buffing the other totems. 
---
It ended with me having a board full of 0/2 stealthed minions. Lol.
---
I feel like the evergrowing's fault is that it will be likely to have stealth. Otherwise, a huge minion with can't be targeted and taunt(best case scenario?) would be good lategame, right?
---
Bozzzton's decks in this round vs. Viper were Odd Rogue, Even Warlock, and Hybrid Hunter.  It wasn't Control vs. Control at all.  The sarcastic comments stemmed from the fact that Bozzzton kept trading at every opportunity, even though he was the aggressor in every match-up
---
It is intended. Also, a pedantic side note, if you "summon" a minion it won't trigger the secret. You need to "play" a minion (from your hand).
---
When I commented this post had 4 comments, so half of all of the comments were those angry negative responses. Also the post was in negative karma, so clearly things turned around since I commented but I was not exaggerating. I’ve seen it happen on other posts too. 
---
the resources you spent on getting that to happen is more than Shadowform, which is already a bad card
---
Do you mean quaint?
---
Decks are fairly well balanced right now when compared to historically worse times. Emerald spell stone will soon rotate. Not trying to be a blizzdrone right now, but it seems they are finally starting to worry about balance lately (hall of fame, druid changes) and I just think we should see what new standard brings.

uka39#1764 NA
---
Welcome Bundle doesn't count.
---
Bad 
---
&gt; To me that seems like destroying the point of the game.
---
To me that sounds like accelerating the game. If you could spend 70 minutes playing X games or 20, which is better? I get that this is a game and games are meant to be enjoyed and fun, but .. don't you have a job? Family? Maybe kids, other hobbies, interests? I enjoy playing hearthstone but I want to be able to cram as much "enjoyment" per unit time as possible.
---
&gt; So what? The idea is that the 25/24 is actually fun to play while the game with the aimbot, however short, just isn't.
---
Fun is winning. For every 1000 losses, 1 or maybe 2 is interesting or genuinely fun to play. The rest are forgotten 10 seconds after they're over when I'm moving onto the next game. If I rubbed a magic lamp with 3 wishes and the genie told me he's already decided my first wish: all your Hearthstone losses occur 5 seconds after the mulligan, part of me would be disappointed I only *actually* get 2 real wishes but another part of me would be like .. well that isn't *that* bad, I only actually have to *play* the games I win. I wouldn't really be all that upset, honestly.
---
&gt; So...how many points do you think is the ideal amount to lose by?
---
Well, I should preface this remark that your example somewhat fell on deaf ears as I don't play FPS's. I tend to find them boring. I don't say that defensively in a "well I suck at this therefore they're boring." I have played them very sparsely in the past and although I didn't excel at them, I wasn't garbage. I tend to have fairly good eye-hand coordination which is the principal skill in an FPS. I don't enjoy them as there is extremely limited strategy, development, or skill (beyond that of fast reflexes) that go into FPS. Card games, skill games like chess, etc are much more up my alley. Again, not intended as a vain self-brag, it's just what my brain processes as enjoyable.
---
But, all that aside, the answer to your question is the best loss would be a landslide as it means I stood no chance. Luck is, for me, the ultimate deciding factor in aggravation. Coming back to HS for an example, if I'm playing a control deck and play perfectly, even baiting you into suboptimal plays which I exploit for advantage, leaving you with no cards, no board, and me with a Reno in hand .. a game I should always win .. but I'm on 6 life and you topdeck Leeroy, that is the absolute ultimate in frustration. I did everything I was supposed to. I outplayed you by every possible definition of the word, but because you got a 1 in 19, I lose. The other 18 times I win because I can Reno next turn, but not this game. That is what makes me want to throw my laptop through the nearest window and curse you and your loved ones to eternal damnation.
---
I play to win. If I do everything I can to win, and furthermore set up a game state such that the overwhelming majority of the time I *do* win, yet you pull the miracle and beat me, that is what infuriates me.
---
That's why I play combo. I don't *care* if you topdecked Leeroy. Go ahead and play him. I have Ice Block up and another in my hand. I'm going off in 2 turns. I have already won this game. Go ahead and play your cards, they don't matter. I'm alt tabbed and browsing reddit anyway. This game is mine, I won, you lost, can we hurry up and move on already? Why are we still playing?
---
&gt; With a human player you don't know what their level is. They might make a big mistake on one turn and then follow it up with some brilliant moves after that.
---
I mean, I basically only play rank 5-1 wild where there aren't any garbage players. There are garbage *decks* where people are goofing off which is fine with me because they're goofing off and I'm getting a win and we both profit, but no garbage players. I never see any garbage plays unless my opponent has grossly misread what my deck is which I chuckle at and mutter to myself "heh, okay man, you go ahead and play that. Thanks for the win friend."
---
&gt; Because you're supporting bad game design that is making other people's experiences miserable.
---
A) Blizzard made those cards, not me. It's kind of hard to blame me for using the very cards they made to the best of their respective potential to win.
---
B) Miserable? Really? If you're *miserable* after playing a combo deck then you're really taking this game far too seriously. And if that's the case, you should play a Warlock deck with 2 Gnomeferatu, Rin, 2 Demonic Project, 2 Rat, 2 Void Contract, and 2 Bloombloom to play the Contracts. Wait, you're *not* playing that deck? Could that possibly be because you'd rather win games? Funny that, me too! I want to win. I want to be in control of whether or not I win games. That's why I play combo. So either play the ultimate in anti-combo or stop bitching that you lose to combo. There isn't a third option short of incessant whining and complaining on reddit which is what you'd seem to prefer.

It is, but it's still valuable damage; Any deck that uses this card would care about face damage.
---
Odd rogue often deals 2 damage to face with SI:7 agent, and they don't feel too bad about it, given they're trying to kill you fast.

Hi, I'm KillswitchKSG! While I don't only stream Hearthstone, its a fairly large portion of what I do stream. I'm not the best player in the world, and admittedly a little behind the meta right now, but I care more about the memes and having a good time than I do about being the best.

We don’t know which odd/even decks will be relevant because we don’t know what’s in the next expansion(s). Odd Mage was barely a thing before Rastakhan.

Good bot.
---
It was alright. A lot like Magic: The Gathering, but not as good. The whole idea of having a hero sort of character to represent yourself and equipment cards to put on them was cool, sort of like the Commander play format of MTG but baked right into the base game rules. Also the raids were awesome, even though you needed a lot of people to play them if you wanted the player side to gave a chance.
---
The main problem I found, when getting friends and family to play, was that it had too steep a beginner learning curve and that made for a harsh barrier to entry. Where with MTG you can throw together a simple monocolor deck that has nothing complicated to worry about and can still perform well, the WoW TCG just had too much going on for people who weren't already well versed in card games to pick it up quickly. A lot of people just never got their heads around the resource system before they gave up because they got frustrated.
---
This exact thing just happened to Kripp lol.
---
14 upvotes on a statement that is plainly incorrect. How is that possible? Oh, I am on Reddit!
---
Chillwind Yetti is rated currently 119, which puts him in the "Good" category. Below that is the "Above Average" category, and only below that is the "Average" category.
---
So Chillwind Yeti is NOT average by the lightforge guys, it's not even above average, it's GOOD. Okay?
---
An average card often has poor stats balanced by some situational effect that's mostly useless in the Arena. That's why plain minions without text, but good stats are actually quite good picks in a given mana cost slot, thus their relative high rating. What is said about Yeti is that it gives "fair" return for the invested mana in stats, which is not enough in constructed that is highly synergistic. 
---
That said, the rating of all the three minions is actually very close, Yeti being 119, Al'Akir 115 and Hogger 116 or so, which is not surprising since we have the bucket system that groups cards of similar quality together. 
---
The correct decision would then have to take into account the type of the deck in question, and possible synergies with other cards.

Decklist? I have been looking for a quest druid deck to try.
---
The predecessor was 'Warcraft Legends' actually. Explained in this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31dX-01BUrI
---
If your deck quality is closer to that of your enemies skill gets rewarded more, therefore a good player is able to get more wins more frequent. Git gud i guess?
---
I don't understand either... I upvoted you downvote though &lt;3
---
Looks like you don't have any Standard-legal cards then.  Your question isn't very specific though.  "I want to buy something", well, buy whatever you want I guess.
---
Don't buy cards from last year's expansions unless you don't mind them all rotating out of Standard in a few months.  Last year's (Mammoth) expansions were Unogoro, Frozen Throne, Kobolds.  Don't buy those packs.
---
This year's (Raven) expansions were Witchwood, Boomsday, Rastakhan.
---
There's also the Starter Bundle which is the best value out of anything.  I don't recommend buying any packs when they're not on a special sale, the prices are kind of dumb and you get shit for your money.

Millhouse is fun, sure you may give a paladin a 30 damage minion on turn two now and again, or druid a use of ultimate infestation, but sometimes you get a 44 minion on turn two and have your opponent waste a bunch of spells!

“Sometimes choose eye to eye when it is the best card, like here where I had taunts enough to prevent his 2/3s 2/3s, and trash from hitting my face, and I could control his big minions each turn and prevent malygos from attacking my face or etc. Actually, Nevermind just ALWAYS pick it vs clone priest!”

Patches was definitely more op than N'zoth's (it even got nerfed!), so if you call that "super OP" (i would agree), then no way N'zoth's is also "super OP". The thing with Patches is that the winrate difference when you pull him from your deck and when you draw him was very big (probably still is). That's pretty much what i meant with "automatically win you the game", no single card actually wins you the game 100% of the time. Even coin barnes on turn 3 into 1/1 yshaarj with Big Priest in wild can be won sometimes. 
---
Done.

---
Didnt he end up getting reverse swept because of this?
---
Yes of Course fun to Play but realy unfun to Play against. This deck and any other otk druid deck is the reason i Play odd rogue on ladder. And than for me  " I foundthis deck the only fun and satisfying deck Right now to palyy, agaisnt you and all other druids ".
---
I would also say that certain class-specific keywords should be used in all classes. Choose One is the biggest one. It adds so much flexibility and uniqueness to cards and I have no earthly idea why Choose One is druid flavored. I also think all classes should have secrets, but that's probably a less popular opinion. 
---
It just seems highly limiting to design space to lock two huge card types to only a few classes.

It's true that druid has abused mana cheating to play big stuff or combos but would much rather this deck to any other hunter decks. Before nerfs I liked playing tog druid. I found this and Tog deck complicated and hard to play rather than playing odd pally or zoo and play almost everything in your hand by turn 4.

You probably still would’ve won, as the enemy only would have 5 cards remaining, it’s highly unlikely they could beat you down from 40 twice before dying to fatigue.

I don't like this. If a player with low resources uses all his dust to craft that one legendary he wants so bad, and it happens to be popular in the current meta, it's really unfair to prevent him from putting it in his deck. If he already has basically nothing to play with, it just sucks to give him even less.

Again, true, but the loss of powerful cards will disproportionately affect decks built around restrictions and the bonuses of the improved hero powers will have to carry much more of the weight of the deck than they do now.
---
Genn Graymane and Baku the Mooneater will still be popular choices, but most decks using them will find themselves struggling to find truly playable options where cards from the Year of the Mammoth once were more so than other decks. 
---
Other than largely evergreen archetypes like Zoo Warlock and Midrange Hunter, Odd and Even decks may really be the only popular decks now that could reasonably survive the rotation. However, with the decreased card pool, fewer of them at the very least should be playable.
---
And here I am wondering how you got Kingsbane.....
---
Dude, he is playing against a demon deck. Which makes this even more funny.
---
How do you check the server? 
---
Ide like to get out of this stupid BS meta that is currently going on. I hate it, I don't enjoy it, and i can't seem to grasp any of the decks. The previous expansions/seasons I have greatly enjoyed playing the game, made it close to rank 2 for myself, and right now im just hardstuck at rank 16. There isn't a deck that I really enjoy playing, and no matter what deck I seem to plat its always the cancerous hunters or paladins I get to face.
---
&gt;I'd like a way to get the exclusive heroes (Khadgar, Tyrande, Mecha-Jaraxxus, Rastakhan)
---
That's not what "exclusive" means. 
---
I forgot to assign a flair, I had to repost it.
---
Uh, you just, um. Screenshot the decklist, convert it to standard, then convert to wild, use screenshot to put the wild-exclusive cards back in? Easy as, uh, making a pie. From scratch.
---
More dust please, get on it Blizznerd
---
Toki is my favorite. Prioritize the double-cast treasure, then fill your deck with non-targeted spells, like unstable portal, primordial glyph, cinderstorm, etc.
---
Spell damage, +2 health, or -1 spell cost treasures are the next best in my opinion, and they all complement the double cast treasure.
---
In general, I do well as Toki with decks that generate lots of spells and/or minions.
---
Where are you from cause there is na for America an such an eu for others to my knowledge 
---
He's an aspiring instagram model and just wants to share what he ate
---
it's the same deck as tog azalina, but just hakkar not a new archetype really.
---
People only don't pick Griftah because they think they can gift their opponent the game, something that's very easy to play around. It's at the very least, a Yeti, and definitely the best pick here.
---
actually each naturalize doubles the bloods twice. So if you had one blood in deck, after first naturalize they become  4 and on second one 16. On their turn 32.
---
No because he would be giving his opponent an Amara and a lot of cards in their deck.

1/0/3 | Stealth for 1 turn. After a friendly minion dies, shuffle a 1-Cost copy of it into your deck.

---
I would love to play it but don't have the dust for those unfortunately.
---
Any idea?
---
SO WE DO HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY 
---
Has to do with druids transforming into different firms I think. Combo and rogue I’m not sure about. 
---
Wow that card is OP. Fierce Monkey and Squirming Tentacle aren't bad picks either though
---
I always thought that would be a good reward for a successful Dungeon Run after you've earned all your card back unlocks: a random non-golden card in your possession turns golden, just like the end-of-month upgrades you sometimes get. No reason they couldn't do this with other single-player modes as well, but it really fit the theme of dungeon run perfectly.
---
Haha I think I actually did and dusted that as well. I’ve been playing since beta so I’ve had pleeeenty of shitty legendary draws over the years
---
The problem definitely isn't mana cheating. It's a trillion stall cards that make it nearly impossible to win against it with a slower deck.
---
They later found out that Hooktusk works like Oakheart and not like Y’shaarj, so Recruit is actually the appropriate term in this case.
---
Okay cool will that dude
---
Gonna hitch this comment here just to say something.
---
Keeping subtle interactions the same isn't a reason to justify consistency changes. Remember when azalina got "buffed" when the enchantments got standardized? Although azalina didn't really need the buff, the changes made a lot of sense.
---
For example, making y'shaarj say "at the end of your turn, recruit a minion" would be such a minor interaction change and doesn't it affect any major decks right now, even though the card itself sees frequent play in wild.
---
Charged devilsaur is slightly different though. Even though making it say "rush" is almost the same thing as "charge, battlecry can't attack heroes", the charge is what makes it viable in certain decks, so standardizing this would destroy it's niche in their respective decks.
---
Tl;dr subtle interactions shouldn't be a reason to increase consistency. The only time it matters is if it destroys the affected card's niche.
---
100% agree on the change to quests and also a change to the golden cards. doesn't even have to be a rework of the dust price (although that would be welcome too) but an "upgrade-to-gold" feature that is at least a tiny bit less punishing than disenchanting a legendary for 400 and recrafting it for 3200 if you want it in gold. i think 2000-2400 instead of the 2800 we're paying right now would at least be a little more fair. (just picked out legendary to give an example, ofc similar options for common/rare/epic would be great too)
---
The legendary in the first 10 packs only applies to expansion packs you've never opened. So yes, only GvG.
---
What?
---
Its in another comment chain. Molten blade.
---
this, so much.
---
i wrote this somewhere here already:
---
"an "upgrade-to-gold" feature that is at least a tiny bit less punishing than disenchanting a legendary for 400 and recrafting it for 3200 if you want it in gold. i think 2000-2400 instead of the 2800 we're paying right now would at least be a little more fair.

---
What card was that?
---
Imo Firebat is monotone. I prefer Dog.
---
Thats Leroy!!
---
It doesn't ruin it. That's like saying drawing at all ruins fatique. It doesn't help but in some scenarios you need to do something or you lose. Physic screaming a cube is definitely worth it. Also, as you can see the priest is able to put things back into his deck.
---
I would like the ability to ban ONE class from queuing into on ladder.
---
     -You may ban one class to prevent playing against them on ladder. 
---
     -You may NOT ban the class you are playing as.
---
So there are certain matchups that are unwinnable, and this helps circumvent that. At the same time, it also helps to alleviate certain annoying ladder matchups that you CONSTANTLY face. Back in the day it was Pirate Warrior, today it would be Secret Hunter. So it helps adding a variety of classes you play against. 
---
Benedictus?
---
Demon
---
I assumed Kalimos was from elise pack... but here we are, no Elise.
---
Druid schtick should be „transforming“
---
I've also seen it in Odd Paladin a few times, but even less than in Odd Rogue.
---
People in reddit don't generally like
---
It is at least the miracle version which only started appearing after the nerfs, really.
---
Happens regularly. Its not an error. Sometimes I use Demonic Project to get a 50/50 chance to play Azari, but quite often I just get him as a free 10/10. 
---
The thing is, often I get to coin Skull on T4 to get a T5 Voidlord. This means any Rin played afterwards wont destroy the opponents deck, if my opponent doesnt destroy the Skull. But the tempo gained by free Voidlords and a free 10/10 later is in most cases enough to seal the win. Destroying the opponents deck is not the main win con.
---
Wow esports
---
Mostly poor leadership I think
---
But the cost we will have to pay to experience that freshness of standard will be enormous. The whole meta is gonna change, so we will need a lot of new epics and legendaries. 
---
Definitely would like an opportunity to at least get Tyrande again especially in countries where she was not available in the first place due to Twitch Prime restrictions.
---
Rotating old expansions into standard, possibly in cycles.   
---
Reworking and promoting wild sets to be more prevalent and played.
---
More card changes more frequently, I sincerely believe one of the biggest benefits of a digital only card game is being able to tweak cards so the game gets shaken up as time progresses, not just once every 3 months. 
---
Possibly the ability to unlock old monthly reward card backs, but I can understand some people might get annoyed over that. 
---
Whizbang to use my paid characters portraits. 
---
Oh what am I saying? None of this will happen. Almost none of what anyone is saying here will happen. ActivisionBlizzard have been an absolute mess this year, and its going to take a lot more than a handful of nice QoL changes to fix that. Honestly I see the future of this game and it boils down to three mediocre expansions a year with a push on buying up preorders. I sincerely doubt anything will change unless we pay for it upfront anymore. 
---
I was so happy when I took this screenshot, I play a control warrior so my plan is usually take it to fatigue. As I said in previous comments, that didn’t happen lol. He pretty much did exactly what you described. Those goddamned voidlords though. 
---
Hello! I use the deck from this website: https://disguisedtoast.com/articles/270-starter-basic-control-priest-0-dust
---
I agree with these
---
I would also like this tbh
---
Kneel
---
The title just speaks for some jojokes
---
After the train stops, I want to close the game and continue playing at the smartphone! :)
---
Probably full of Amaras, he does have 6 spirit of the deads, which will keep shuffling Amara into it again and again
---
I believe it is. But $40 is not a major deal for me to spend on a game I play all the time. 
---
Giving people incentives to do things they think aren't fun enough to do without the incentives makes them keep playing the game even though they don't like it 
---
This is bad for the player, but also, if people who didn't like the game would just stop playing it, we would have fewer posts here disparaging the game.
---
I guess so. But fewer ways to get gold is just a big "fuck you" to a big part of the player base.
---
Win condition is not dying, because you will fatigue your opponent
---
Which they could alleviate by simply giving out packs for free, or for minimal effort/engagement eg once a week logon bonus, packs in end of season chest, etc.
---
It was really funny watching Trump get mowed over by this version because he was running hard anti-aggro warrior to counter mech hunter (which he faced a grand total of zero times). 
---
rekuraab#2831 EU
---
Trading 80g quest, will show but you'll have to go first.
---
&gt; 3 Omega Assemblies and mine came from my 3rd Dragons Roar.  
---
Looks like those balance changes Blizzard made to Arena buckets are really working out well. 8-)
---
It's a godsend, especially if you can bring it back with Twighlight's Call. It plays heavily on RNG, but it helps with having a 4 attack minion, another deathrattle, and a random legendary minion. 
---
Hey, I play this mage quite a bit and I find acolyte causes overdraw issues quite often, what are your thoughts?
---
But you still have to poop once in that 5 day stretch right?
---
Not for constructed, no. But for Arena Kripp isn't a bad option. He doesn't exactly treat his streams as educational, but he does explain his thought processes fairly often, and is probably a top 5 arena player in the world. 
---
I play and stream pretty competitively myself, so I watch Kripp as more of a "break" rather than watching someone else who keeps up that intensity, but I've found myself incorporating more and ore of the thought processes he explains over time into my own games in arena.
---
i definitely finished that battle
---
Win condition is to not die
---
*Wherever it is.*
---
Did he not even think to start killing the 0/3s?
---
Well, a format like that should be optional.
---
I think it would work best as a third Ladder mode: Year of the Raven (Standard mode), Month of the Shredder (Challenge mode), 404 Name Not Found (Wild mode).
---
You're not forced to play a mode just because it exists.
---
Let me guess: OP didn't filter for Wild Cards? Just Standard? 
---
I have ysed that card before but i think i only got lucky as i had it at the best time possible cuz my enemy summoned that dog with echo card. But idk how to really get the most out of it as i usually relay on always clearing my enemy's battle field then summoning lightspawn and on the 5-6 turn i would buff him with any health card on my hand. That or just spawn most of my buffing cards and let them buff each other.
---
And this is why i play eater of secrets in wild. 
---
Wanted to point out the exact same thing.
---
This is my favorite play in the game currently 
---
It mighy be interestong to see them release a new card every week or every other week for whichever class is least played and has least winrate. Doesn't necessarily have to be viable either, but maybe just a fun addition to tinker around with.
---
Imagine Freeze Shaman got a new card that said "When this minion is frozen, Freeze an enemy minion" or something. Blizzard could get pretty creative with these "Sudden New Cards". Make them only playable in Casual, or maybe a separate game mode entirely to house these new cards.
---
Do not take me for some conjuror of cheap tricks!
---
The amazing part was Casie not playing around the secret just before that.
---
but the enemy doesn't die?
---
That's just wrong. Zoo does considerably worse on ladder and is barefly more popular. Evenlock would be the better example but still Cube is the highest winrate form of Warlock. I'd say it's a solid tier 2 deck and even if not Zoo certainly doesn't outperform it and they are pretty different decks anyway, it's not like one invalidates the other at all just because they're the same class.
---
&gt;barely bothering to communicate
---
Remember how they invented something called "first ever Hearthstone In The Works Update" just so that they could bury the tournament mode cancellation in the middle of a long article?
---
Yeah, that was totally a real feature, I've really enjoyed all the regularly scheduled In The Works updates we gotten since then.
---
&gt; 99+ deckslots. There's no excuse.
---
Playing wild &amp; standard in addition to building decks and not just netdecking is so annoyingw ithg the 18 slots.
---
I often come up with an interesting deck idea. Play it for 3-10 matches. Next day I need to delete one of my homebrews for a quest and often it's to tedious to save every deck in a wordfile, label it, retrieve it. I would just like to pick it again in the future and keep improving it. Currently I can barely have 1 standard and 1 wild deck per class. All kind of experimentation forces me to fréquently delete decks and often forget to recreate them.
---
Okay.
---
Almost like a win condition or something
---
That’s not gonna change my mind!
---
wohlfahrt#1778 NA 80g trade. Will show but you go first.
---
36 should be fine.
---
Nah 36 is not fine imho when you build your own decks and play wild and standard. Make it 9 per class and you wouldn't even need to change the ui. Just let us chose the class first and then give us the 3x3 rows aka 9 slots for each class.
---
Really?
---
Just wait till the next expansion and rotation, then all the decks will shuffle around.  That’s what I’m doing.
---
Have you ever heard of Nexus of fate my friend?
---
DING DONG!
---
Yeah right now only botters and streamers get to the cap.
---
Gonk has a decent chance if you don't get stomped before turn 6.
---
We still have some hidden achievements that award gold, like 100 wins and 1000 wins.
---
But no menu to view them or check progress.
---
Replays
---
&gt; I just think that there is some unseen factors that prevent that from happening right now.
---
Activision?
---
Play a deck that counters them because winning = fun doesn't it?  
---
Ah yes, the classic noob mistake of not playing around 5 mind blasts when your opponent is 1 health away from death!
---
I have. It’s been a solid week since I’ve logged on.
---
Well besides today, and nothing had changed.
---
Yep. I lost an arena game to this bug *four years ago*. I raised as much hell as I could at the time. It's not going anywhere. Learning the hard way that you need to play around this bug is just a part of the new player experience at this point.
---
It’s now a playoff for the Winter Championship, so instead of one winner they decided its more fair to have double elimination after Swiss.
---
Been this way the whole season.
---
Thank you for this ! 
---
Been playing it on ladder, if you have the cards the deck is an absolute blast to play
---
Every hunter out there deserves this
