How do you manage to clear your own board for the mecha'thun win? My thinking is that you really only use the mecha'thun win-con against control players who just see you as a taunt druid and clear the board for you and aggro players just die as you overwhelm them with taunts. How does it fair against other OTK type decks?
---
Look, you've got to understand, in a high-APM game like Hearthstone there's just too much data flowing at any one time to simply reconnect and resync with the state of play. 
---
You'll have missed countless "Well playeds" by your opponent by the time you reconnect, robbing them of precious BM opportunities so is it really fair for Blizzard to cater for the flaky users out there?

---
I think it was less about the actual throw and more straight BM to show off how bad he had him beat. I think krip actually played it really well and turned it around by playing his outs perfectly. He could‚Äôve ended it at any minute, and had he won it would‚Äôve been much greater level of BM which is what I think the purpose of krip sniping is
---
Do you get the "disconnect for no valid reason every 15 minutes" when on mobile data as well?
---
This analysis is welcome but also a bit pointless without knowing what the new set is. Hopefully Blizzard introduce some versatile Rogue cards, with Rogue flair, that are good on their own, instead of in gimmicky decks.

It isn't a discussion of RNG, period, but rather, the amount of RNG is required to win. I've been playing Magic: Arena a whole lot, and while it isn't perfect, and merfolk players are the scourge of the Earth, Magic, in general, works better simply by never having a "discover" effect, random attack effects, or really, anything that takes control from you.. Cards do what is on text. I don't run the risk of my opponent having 50 Ice Blocks (before it was HoF). My opponent can have counter spells, but I can see their mana pull, and plan for it. I can't plan plan for mage glyph. 
---
The thing that really chaps my gooch is when I'm playing a single player game and lose my internet connection during a battle and it counts as a loss. Try making it to the 8th boss with the worst shrine (you know the one) and losing because your bus went into a bad signal area, you'll wish the bus had just driven off a cliff instead.

No, it's fine.

'Copying text' is a completely new mechanic. It's the best nerf out of all the ideas I've heard but sadly I don't think blizzard will go the distance.
---

What about doing a system restore?
---
If Barnes summons a 1 mana 1/1 version with the text of something in your deck, it would still give them a 1/1 minion that summons Y‚Äôsharjj
---
You seem fun!
---
Don‚Äôt play priest much, I assumed by letting those radiant elementals live, I gave him a OTK, didn‚Äôt happen tho. 
---
you are wrong, druid is dead, blizzard make another mistake nerfing those cards.
---
It's not an easy card to explain because when you use it depends on what deck you are facing.  
---
For example against control decks (think of decks with lots of minion removal/board clears) you would ideally want to play it as soon as possible to start generating minions and try and get them to run out of removal resources.   
---
Against aggro decks (think of decks trying to play lots of small minions quickly) you would want to time it right to use his +2 damage to enemy minions as a board clear and go from there.  
---
As to what beasts ... same story really. Create what best suits the situations though generally it's going to be a rush/charge mixed with poison/lifesteal but tanking minions cna help lots or maybe a big stealth minion to push face damage the next turn.  
---
It really comes down to the situation you find yourself in.
---
Strange behavior but perhaps coded to mouse over cards in your hand to give it the effect of a "real" player, similar to how some will emote at times.  
---
Yeah but this is a thread about big priest, and that change would stop rezzing the 1/1 as a giant minion
---
I too have had the same bot experience about a year ago, I never had a resolution. My thought was that possibly blizz was trying out something in a live setting? In my experience the ai was particularly good; (doing some pretty thought out combos) though didnt overtly seem to be gaining anything from targetting cards in my hand. Interesting

No. Nat Pagle and 5 mana Sylvanas were the best cards in the game. Tink master overspark was auto include as it hard countered Sylvanas.

---
Cho is so old that when I play him in some decks that I made, people are actually reading the text to learn what he does.
---
My guess is that the tournament meta is less favorable. As it is even shaman isn‚Äôt really super favored against anything, it‚Äôs just a solid deck that has fair matchups against most other decks in the meta. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a good ladder deck. But in a tournament meta with bans and specific targeting strategies, it‚Äôs not that dominant.

Jaina doesn't really fit in the deck, your goal isn't to get to late game it is to beat your enemy before they get theirs. Jan'alai and Jaina will be bad draws, might want to replace with a secret package. Obviously it feels great when those cards save you but it goes against the rest of the deck.

Your opponent will have trouble making good use of Millhouse's battlecry effect, as every spell they cast will go to their opponent's hand because of Cho.  So you end up triggering Cho's downside every time you make use of the bonus Millhouse gave you.
---
How did he get the spirit?
---
No one expects the 3rd ‚Äúno one expects the 5th mind blast‚Äù post.
---
It plays itself. There's not much decision making made. You have two choices - clear the board if you can, or rez something if you can (which usually is the play anyway.) It's just watching a movie about some holy guy getting lucky as hell while his opponent struggles to deal with an army of 8~10 mana minions on turn 6.
---
It doesn't feel good to win with nor does it feel good to lose to. That's what makes a deck unhealthy imo, especially if it's strong as hell. I understand if people are trying to get Priest wins towards Golden, but when I play against Golden Priests using Big Priest in Wild, I just wonder...why? 
---
But opponent's spells are free and your's are not. Millhouse is bad here - I can not call Millhouse a counter by any means ;)

Used to play Odd Quest Priest (Pre RakaRumble), played the mirror once, it went on for close to 80 minutes when we hit turns, it was a great match, we both had Cubes, Zolas, Amara, Faceless, Yseras, copied each others decks, had Oracles and Screams and what else not. At one point opponent had 3 Yseras on board, I managed to clear that, resolve an Ysera, cube her, miracle summoner on cube and traded them all, leaving me with 4 Yseras on board which in return he cleared two turns later, resolved Amara into Zola. That match was truely epic and a picture of pure shenanigans. Spellstone was amazing as well, also I've got around ten or twelve Crystalline Oracle triggers some of them giving Twilight's Call for the super value. Stopped playing on rank 3 I believe, it also felt really good vs  aggressive decks. Folded to Shudderwock 24/7. I won like once in 30+ games.

This is exactly how I feel as a player who recently circled back to wild and am now playing regularly. After the last balance patch, almost all the other cancerous shit is out of the game, Big Priest is the last domino to fall. Nuke that retarded piece of shit Barnes from orbit, and fire whichever asshat OK'd that design.

---

---
Well shit. Thanks bro. Didn‚Äôt know that
---
You don't know jack shit about balancing cards 
---
Can u explain? 
---
It has one. Demonic project. The card that blows up half your deck is anti synergy with your hero power and will kill you in fatigue. Also, there should be a neutral tech card for combo hate. I'm sure they'll print one next expansion just like skulking geist was printed after jadestone.
---
You can skip the animation by clicking the card when it shows up on the left hand side and increase the amount of cards played. Also they're playing faster than the server can display so you sit there for minutes watching animations she they've already requeued 
---
That seems super specific even your opponent has armor because it only matters if they are on low health with armor. Something that does bonus damage When the opponent has armor. Or some something like if this attacked the enemy hero and do x. 
---
Also, I know dirty rat is also random, but so is demonic project, so even if you shoehorn yourself into warlock for a tech card you're not even guaranteed to counter a combo. If I have to play one of nine classes to counter combo decks, I don't want it to be a coin flip on top of that.
---
Would have been hilarious. But fortunately I had a Blizzard left. 
---
HoF Iceblock. 
---
Print a common spell that is effectively the same.
---
Small indie company logic.
---
And yeah, OTK‚Äôs are retarded, un-interactive and so bad for the health of this game.
---
And they surely don‚Äôt have that game plan right? I mean they don‚Äôt have board clears, they don‚Äôt have heals, they don‚Äôt have beefy taunt minions to protect themselves. All they have is the combo pieces right? 
---
They are both equally cancerous, and there‚Äôs a reason why IB got HoF‚Äôed. Turn immunities are not good cards to print, no matter how you slice it.
---
WoW has so much more that if you're playing Hearthstone having never played WoW it's basically the same as playing Magic in the sense that there will essentially be no discernable story for you. But to answer this specific question, yes, all of the old gods sound very very close to a Love Craftian entity. 
---
I see
---
next hero should be priest  or tyrande returning. only very few countries had chance to even get tyrande the  only skin priest has. priest needs to get it, then warrior.

I play thief rogue in wild, great fun, not the best deck, but if you don't get super-rushed by aggro it is almost always a really fun clown fiesta.
---
Most of the player base? Ramp was out of control and in a game where you have a resource that scales with each turn, that‚Äôs just bad news when only 1 class have access to cheating the system. Not to mention it limits design space for the class as a whole, since you always have to consider the absurd ramp potential they had prior to the nerfs.
---
Druids will make a comeback after rotation, I‚Äôm sure of it, in a more healthier and interactive way.

# Sally Whitemane will be the next priest hero. No I do not have a source
---
That's genius
---
Anything else?
---
This is correct. To clarify a bit more, the minion DOES die before the spell ends, but it's deathrattle only triggers AFTER the spell is finished, which is why it works

You obviously missed the point of this thread &amp; you clearly play the deck because you sound hurt, this is personal for you.

Not really the highroll to end all highrolls - it was a 1/75 chance (150 3-drops in standard, Dalaran Mage and Black Cat have spell damage).

Highroll yes, but not as insane as advertised.

This was the first yu-gi-oh I ever got as a kid, the first in my attempt to try and recreate Yugi's deck from the show. Yugi's deck was bad in real life.

---
If you're referring to specifically the Barnes-Y'Sharrj problem where those are the only two minions it's really not the biggest problem in the game. After you remove the 10/10 the threat is pretty much dealt with. It's very strong, sure. Getting a 4th turn 3/4, 1/1 and 10/10 is insane, but there are plenty of target removals in the game and assuming you can deal with it they've essentially got a chillwind yeti's worth of stats.
---
Man, I wish yugioh got propered faithfully like MTG arena for the digital platform. Duel Links suck major dick. I don‚Äôt want anime attached to it. I don‚Äôt want a simplified version of it. I want a game that focuses on mechanic and art (I consider yugioh art to be the creme de la creme among its peers). I saw such a huge potential, but they fucked it up with Duel Links. I hope they make another iteration of the experience just like what MTG went through.
---
Would play that over Hearthstone and MTG Arena 100% of the time. It was my shit back in the days. Hearthstone filled that void 99% of the way but it still ain‚Äôt yugioh.

Hearthstone lost the "Heroes of Warcraft" subtitle long ago. So basically it doesn't have anything to do with WoW anymore. It seems they wan't to give us additional lore via stories they publish on their site from time to time (usually around expansion release). That is pretty weak because you have to leave the game. There are so many different things they could do. It just makes me sad thinking about it.
---
They completely destroyed Odd and Even Paladin when they were too good. They're unplayable now.

I just happen to have an easier time playing the game during the day.

I think that's why people play it. It takes very little thought (obviously there are still decisions to make), and it's pretty effective.

It just gets less attention because it has less people.

---
The real reason for netdecks is not that they are stronger. They normally are, but what causes people to netdeck is that very few players have close to a full collection. They can't afford to craft shitty cards and experiment. If you can only have 3-4 decks, it's essential that they are playable.
---
Nothing more satisfying than beating your opponent with their own deck
---
I think the Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1 was the first card Yugi ever played in the anime, and it survived exactly 0 turns. After that it rarely was ever played again since it was a terrible card even for original Yugioh standards.
---
So while you could compare the artworks, Vicious Fledgling definitely is a lot more powerful and even competitively playable. The difference between these cards is huge. ( Not to say they don‚Äôt look kinda similar though )
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 100.0% sure that I don't know what am I talking about.
---
I‚Äôm mean lore walker cho would either die immediately from a minion and you could get a free removal spell
---
Starting at 8 wins the chance for a legendary exists. Finding this out made me no longer happy getting to 7 lol
---
For ladder you should craft entire decks instead of single Legendaries, IMO. 
---
lol well, I think I should just try to get even right? I'm not sure where to star though.
---
That is a very good point
---
Thanks ! Will do ! 
---
It's a hard decision but probably demonbolt
---
Just finding it funny that a bunch of retards thinks it's an accomplishment. Time + Facerushdeck = Guaranteed Legend. Been like that for the last 3 years or so. The more time you invest the higher you'll climb in legend then.

---
About 50/50, i would say /s
---
It is, but it's weighted random due to the bucket system. So certain cards are very likely to appear in decks.
---
for example, 52 % of priest decks have 1.2 copies of mass hysteria, so that means you're very likely to encounter at least 1-3 of them, especially as you climb in win rate

Probably just so that using the dice spell card doesn‚Äôt obliterate the opponent immediately. Imagine multiplying 1500 with 6 instead of 500.

Joeys deck is even more of a joke than Yugis.

I can't believe they still didn't remove The Darkness from the random random pool. It ruins games for one or both player if it gets summoned without getting played.
---
A tempo deck that runs out of card in hand is dead anyways. Myra is a hand refill that actually extends the amount of time you actually have to win.

I'd say best investment if you're low on dust would be Baku and then run any of the odd variants. Odd paladin is a really good cheap deck at the moment, it has a really good win rate, but isn't the most fun to play (I've been enjoying it though). Spell Hunter with Zul'Jin is popular, but DK Rexxar helps it with control decks. After next year rotates out I think Baku will still be used in a lot of T1 decks.
---
Wow, I thought I'd seen expensive decks this meta, but Peanut Shaman really takes the cake. It has to be the most expensive Standard deck I've seen, it actually costs as much as Renolock.
---
Yes pls. When???

Why can't the game tell me what to replaceable an irreplacable card with :Rage:

---
Can I say dibs to post this next year? I think it‚Äôs my turn now.
---
The rise of control priest hurts odd pally win rates obviously.  
---
Also 10K less matches recorded this week which is a big drop really and could also play into the stats of a couple of % point change.
---
Then we would almost have a pure cotrol/combo meta as odd pally would drop out and it would be boring as fuck.
---
So do you want to encourage players to not play the best decks and  or what? 
---
Oh thank you
---
Tell that to druid.

Still messing with the deck but this is my most recent one. The only other card I run from rr is crowd roaster and dragonmaw. I might try and put Benedictus in somewhere. Lmk if you have any edits to the deck ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Seriously. I never understood why, of all the cards, they made *that* one abbreviated.
---
Yeet
---
Edgy.
---
Hes 3rd rate duelist with a 4th rate deck.
---
How?
---
Their opinion. You can use HSReplay stats to evaluate the win rates of the differing decks (once you find them) and judge for yourself based on play rate etc.  - strangely they mostly all come under "secret" hunter still with the #1 deck being the dire frenzy based deck.  
---
There is also no flanking strike in there for better or worse (I always run it personally).
---
They do note: 
---
&gt;and proactive development of the board is better than reactive removal.  
---
Which I disagree with in a meta so heavy on control/combo decks that just can wipe out your board many times over.  The boosted minions can help this with Dire Frenzy as well as putting more in deck - they are harder to remove and help thin out removal options.  
---
Sure Dire Frenzy also puts more card in deck leading to less chance of a Rexxar or Zul'jin draw but if you are behind heavily against a control matchup like Priest and need a late play Rexxar it's often too late. 
---
Wild ...is ... Wild

I noticed it in this image and this revelation has changed my life..... somehow.
---
Turns out the hero power was the real strength the whole time 
---
Repeats are actually common in most random events, usually as frequent as any other specific result.  Most RNGs intentionally make their algorithms less random by forcing out the repeat results so it feels more properly random.  Look into the ipod shuffle if you want to see it action.
---
That was see so many repeats actually argues that the RNG isn't biased rather than it being so.

Paladin instead of two 1/1's one 2/2 would be that strong.

You are just agreeing with me in the barnes nerf lol, I dont know why you get angry.
---
Shit like this, Clone Priest, and the fact that Standard ladder is quite literally 75%+ Midrange Hunter really makes me question why I even fucking play this game any more honestly. 
---
That's typically how the triangle goes. Combo beats control in Hearthstone.
---
Even then, I'd qualify Combo paladins as leaning more towards the control combo side of things like Cube Warlock rather than pure combo like most Mecha'thun decks.
---
Upgrading Hero Powers isn't the problem nessecerily it's more about the fact that indeed it starts at the beginning of the game wich indeeds limits design space alot more than a Battlecry minion that would cost 6 mana [[Justicar Trueheart]]. On the other side I really hope that non-duplicate legendaries like [[Reno Jackson]],  [[Kazakus]] or [[Raza the Chained]] return they didn't really limit design space and weren't that strong wich I really liked.
---
TLDR - Start of game is what breaks Baku and Genn.

People really have to lose the idea that most if not nearly all netdeckers do so because they're forced to do so in some manner.  Be it cost, effectiveness, or any other reason.  Not everyone enjoys deck crafting, the answer is *not* to force them to play the way you want to play.
---
A friend and I were talking about overly long names and he mentioned Super Quantal Mech King Great Magnus, as a toku nerd when I learned about that card I bought a full Super Quantal deck even though I dont play as much anymore
---
Horrible idea to force people to use bad cards in their decks.
---
While they are as common as any other specific result, obviously there are more non-repeat results than repeat results.
---
Fun and interactive!
---
OTK decks are fine, we just need grindy control decks to have options to counter them. Hakkar and Void Contract are excellent steps in the right direction, in my opinion.

I mean sure but Dinosaurs are different things too right? Last time I read up on it, it seemed most people would at least split Therapods from the rest of the classification but a lot of Dinosaurs are grouped together solely on the basis that they're extinct and lived during a ridiculously long group of time periods. It's closer to associate "Dinosaur" to "Mammal" than it is to a distinct group.

r/okbuddyretard
---
See as a midrange/aggro palyer I tend to find SOME of the CURRENT control decks the same as OTK/Combo anyway.  
---
For example Control Priest feels far more like an otk/combo to me in that the whole goal is just to clear the boards/minions with no real interest in gaining a board presence in response (though they have a few nice card that give them some presence the main point of the cards is still removal). Just to setup the inevitable mind blast win.  
---
Some even run card draw like the otk/combo decks now just to speed up the whole process - I tend to think Control Priest is mislabelled.  
---
This is different to say control warlock decks that to me feel more like actual control decks since they are more about clearing to establish a board presence and you really feel like you are having a good game playing against them back and forward - until fucking Guldan come up anyway which is such an utterly horrendous card to have in play since it feels more like "wow we've had a great back and forward match but I win now".  
---
So there are good control decks out there but then some of the decks being labelled control feel far more like combo/otk to me.  
---
The funny thing is the people running said decks get annoyed at true otk decks and then complain about it as a result even though they more or less have the same goal in mind. :)
---
one of my favorite dragon cards, thanks for posting
---
Can still be dusted to make golden cards for when you draft in the future. This way you don't have to spend gold to do so.
---
I don't need dust to craft cards if I don't play constructed....
---
Secretkeeper text is outdated. Should say "whenever a player plays a secret..."
---
Grimtotem is definitely one of the most well known Tauren characters, and most well known shamans. 
---
I'm getting a lot of control decks and am finding the extra one just gets it out early when I need it.  
---
For example match just now against resurrect priest I had it in hand to buff my hyena and from there the match quickly snowballed.  Had I not had it in hand the zilliax play would have removed it and the match would have spiralled.  
---
It's just having 2 to have them to use by turn 3/4 is why I'm running 2 as I've found running 1 and pulling it late it's often too late.
---
Yes, draw 3 for 3 is just good.  Especially when the deck has synergies like Rhino + Hyena + Springpaw to draw towards.
---
If only there was a card game that implemented a system which made their game vastly popular.. oh wait...
---
&gt; Lord of D.
---
To leave it up to your imagination.
---
This card is highly flexible and rather hard to explain. You probably get a feeling for it if you play around with it OR you can just watch someone else, either friend or youtuber/streamer. I think kibler for example explains why he picks which beast on stream 
---
Shaman doesn‚Äôt have an Alliance character. Priest and Druid don‚Äôt have Horde characters.

---
Thank you a lot for your extensive answer.
---
&gt; Regarding Boss balance, we targeted the bosses that were the worse offenders.
---
I hope I didn't sound too negative. It does feel a lot better.. and I have even recently managed to beat even the Divine Shield one.
---
&gt; I want to quickly address some of your other points, and I'll try to be a bit more succinct about it. We did play around giving Shrine passive earlier but they tended to be too strong and made early games trivial. 
---
Ah, that makes sense. 
---
&gt;  Extra lives idea is cool and it's actually something we've been messing around since Dungeon Run prototypes. 
---
That's so cool to hear. It seems like it could remove a lot of frustration from the cases where one happens to draw badly against a fast boss. I could be wrong, but I think (if you'd go with the idea), it would be better to either always include the Extra Life card in the player's deck or add it after the 4th boss or so, since an extra chance is cool but having to choose it instead of the other powerful and exciting treasure cards would likely not feel very great. (Also why I never picked the double health one.) 
---
&gt; Other posts, like these, feel like it should be a back and forth conversation and that's harder to do on Reddit. Still, I'd like to try to engage more and offer my insights as much as I can. 
---
True. Dev time is limited and popular games like these get more comments than any human could ever respond to. Makes me appreciate it even more when you do. (As not-yet-professional game programmer / designer, I also really enjoy the Developer Insights.)
---
&gt;  That was long winded but hopefully you got something out of it. Thanks for playing the changes and talking to us about it.
---
Anytime.. and thank you for making these very cool game modes! :)
---
I believe it was post Grand Tournament meta which was mostly Control Warrior, Handlock and Freeze mage. It wasn't really that exciting really... 
---
Last two times I played combo it was Cubelock and Quest Rogue. I believe the skill testing factor of Quest Rogue was largely overhyped, as the game was over as soon as you could bounce your novice engineer. The deck surely suffered from aggro, but was easily carried by vicious scalehide.
---
Cubelock imo is the pinnacle of finesse. It's earlier versions were too forgiving (I got legend with an insane win rate with Cubelock right after Wirchwood was released), but that being said, the deck had a very even match-up spread and as you learned to play it properly, only then you were able to realize it's full potential. That deck, while overpowered to many, was far less simplistic than the OTK decks of today, and it was less polarizing than the current combo decks are.
---
What I want is more combo decks that adapt their game plan rather than chill behind an arsenal of removal tools while cycling to assemble their win condition. 
---
I'm sure I have at some point. I think I got a golden shadow cabal priest a month ago.
---
Break even for arena btw is 3 wins (150g worth of "stuff"). In other words if you average 3+ wins you are no worse off then just buying packs.

Deathrattle: summon two copies of my grandmother's dog, Bobik. I miss him so much. I must've been 11 when he passed away. He was this old york that always wanted to be rubbed on his belly. I just wish he'd come back. I only remember seeing him during last moments before his death. He had kidney problems and had to be taken to the vet. I remember this big scar on his belly. He didn't want to play anymore. He would just sniff the ball I threw him, and go back to his pillow. The only thing I could do, was to pet him on his belly, while looking into his eyes. Eyes, filled with sadness. Unable to speak. Unable to cry. Hollow husk of a dog I loved with all my heart. I could pet him for tens of minutes, and if my arm got tired, I would just switch to the other one. I still remember the sound that his claws made when he walked on the wooden floor. Click clack click clack. How he loved to hide under table. How I would play hide and seek with him. He is now buried in my uncle's backyard. A dog that brought me joy. A dog that was most happy to see me. He is now but a ordinary soil to grass above him. A man's best friend, no, my best friend, became dust. Click clack click clack.

Historically, this type of hunter deck struggles with card draw. Masters call in a beast deck is 3 mana draw 3. Its only a tempo loss when you play it before turn 9 (if the top of your curve is highmane) and even then, in the late game, 3 mana have a very high chance of drawing that 1 beast you really need to win next turn is crazy good.

Not sure why vs thinks dire frenzy is overrated. Most lists run one copy of it. The [lists that run it](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;includedCards=50212%2C48201%2C49447&amp;sortBy=winrate) and [those who dont](https://hsreplay.net/decks/#playerClasses=HUNTER&amp;includedCards=50212%2C49447&amp;sortBy=winrate&amp;excludedCards=48201) have similar performance. Dire frenzy has higher played winrate than animal companion, flanking strike, master's call in almost all lists but its drawn winrate is lower so that may mean it is more of a win more card.
---
Fun fact. Deathstalker rexxar is the card with the lowest "played winrate" on [midrange hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/9yY8wN03828HotSNfIHDD/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) , [Spell Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/XrZWvuuIDzDXOzADcdbSDf/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) as well as [Secret Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/46sk6X0f3K36xQ9FiOgw9e/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD)
---
Only in [Deathrattle Hunter](https://hsreplay.net/decks/uXI0G2gUSR0thbhQ9at0rd/#gameType=RANKED_STANDARD) its not at the bottom regarding this metric.
---
Of course these statistics have to be taken with a grain of salt since there are a lot of factors that are important and the winrate of a card is not the only metric that is important to look at.

If you've been playing for a month, you shouldn't. You can probably already throw together something half-decent. Really try to avoid spending money outside of welcome bundle when you're new. Pre-orders are okay if you're sticking with the game. Absolutely never buy packs regularly, as it's horribly inefficient,
---
I guess that's a way to discover new decks. 
---
Forreal tho, if you need to put down a game to progress your life. I think you're doing life completely wrong my man.

You put in your work and time.

In your free time, you play your games. (New concept?)
---
If you have a spouse that looks negatively on games and you like them, you're doing life wrong.

You need to just take some time and grow up. Appreciate the art behind games. Just because you get tired of a game, doesn't mean you can't be interested in another. 
---
I own a company, work a second job, make the gwop and play the games. For me it keeps me off of substance abuse.

But just rethink your steps mate, and don't pawn it off as progress your life...because that means the games were interfering with your life, which they never should and that shows irresponsibility.

&gt;Its skill cap is very high, born out of a very complex playstyle that requires often unintuitive decision making.  
---
At least you give a nice solid reply and I can understand what you are saying but I still feel what I quoted is hyperbole as you can only do what you can do based on RNG and your decisions knowing your opponents deck.  
---
Granted I was a bit over the top with my comment but it was tongue in cheek (this sub or perhaps even reddit sucks at trying to comprehend this)  but I'm trying to reconcile the "very complex" playstyle as though this deck is so much hard to pilot than any other deck that has decisions to make depending on the matchup they face.  
---
Aggro/midrange? Clear board, pop minions out as appropriate (many of which include an aspect to assist with the clear/control) and push face damage as you can or just wait for the inevitable mind blast and/or alex setup.  Won't always go to play due to RNG but it's RNG ... what can you do.  
---
Combo - as you say race them down, try to disrupt as best you can, getting on bard with minions is tougher but you still have your trump mind blast/alex combo if you've managed to restrict them.  
---
The likes of Warrior well you're probably fucked either way from the armor gain so it is what it is.  
---
I'm not saying it's a simple deck to play but I don't know if "very complex" is inherently correct since it's all still the correct decision at the correct time.

Never seen so maybe "non minions" on the broad before
