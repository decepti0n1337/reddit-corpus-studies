You won't find a deck you cannot identify, because the cardpool in hearthstone is small enough, and the playerbase is large enough, that almost every possible deck will have been created shortly after an expansion release.

---
&gt;As soon as they made the Copy/Paste deck link feature the game went downhill.
---
I seriously doubt that has much of anything to do with the number of meta decks on the ladder. Deck codes only made it easier, but it's not like there were people before who couldn't be bothered to copy decks one card at a time before.

This isn't really a deck builder's game, but that's not really a problem either.

I've always argued against any sort of OTK.  Stalling and cheating out cards is fine.  It only becomes a problem when you can stall and/or cheat your way to 30+ damage in a single turn.  Without that, the Druid stalls itself to defeat because it doesn't have enough threats, and cheating out a card is not a big deal if it's reasonably balanced.  Those stalling and cheating cards exist in arena but they are not high tier cards because they're not a problem without the OTK.
---
Or Sen'Jin. I never thought I'd miss Nax, but here I am.
---
Rock? Perfectly balanced. 
---
It's simply not possible to call a deck your "own" in a card game with a small cardpool and a playerbase of millions.
---
I tend to make my own decks, but I also don't play super competitively (you can find me anywhere from 20 to 10 at any given point.)
---
I feel ya though. Homebrew decks are hit and miss, in that the established meta decks are popular because the kinks have been worked out over thousands of players playing thousands of games, whereas a custom doesn't have that benefit. It can still perform wonderfully if you work at making a deck that you understand you have to pilot expertly to be competitive, and at the same time, sometimes you can be a little sloppy and ride the wave of the "unexpected" effect, where your opponent has no idea what to play against, where you do.
---
As to your original question, what percentage? I'd imagine it's a little higher than you'd think, in that while countless players use online resources, there are still a ton of players who don't. Two of my friends and my wife all play, and none of them care to dive into the meta or net deck, they just build and play, which makes me 1/4 of the people I know who play, who would even know how to netdeck. I can't say that number extends across everyone (it probably doesn't), but it's still a great question!

Casual has a hidden MMR that matches you with people of similar skill. I don't know how long you've played, but if you play and win long enough, your casual MMR will increase enough that you will get matched only with tryhards playing netdecks. For me there is barely any difference between casual and ranked.

You‚Äôre facing people who are trying to climb to the rank 5 floor, so it‚Äôs all meta decks.
---
Try Wild if you want to mix it up. The meta is significantly more diverse, especially at lower ranks where I feel like a lot of Standard refugees are hanging out. Although Wild has its own problems (Big Priest, Jade Druid).
---
If (or when) a tempo-based or aggressive warrior becomes meta, the card will probably appear in the decklist. The card is pretty good, but requires a different kind of deck (kind of like frothing berserker)
---
When dragon warrior was a strong tempo deck, I think some lists ran it (needs citation, I don't remember the deck at all) and the card still sees play in pirate warrior in wild

Something we debate here is whether we should track progress for things that don't have a reward at the end. The Rumble Run is a really great test case - defeating it with 27 shrines is a HERCULEAN task, that's a level of dedication far beyond defeating the Dungeon Run with nine classes. We didn't attach a reward to it. If we tracked which shrines you completed it with, would you expect a reward once you collected them all? How would it feel if you did it and nothing happened?
---
Based on feedback from Rumble Run it feels like it's better to track this kind of thing for the people who care. But I'd love to hear what everyone thinks!
---
I have hit legend with a homebrew deck in december last year ... It was the only time i did it and i was never even close before. why? Because meta isnt a joke. Those decks are tested like thousands of times what a single player just cant do alone. There is no way you just come up with the perfect deck out of nowhere. But thats not a bad thing.
---
The creativity and deckbuilding is all about techchoices. If you tech against Hunter "your" variant probably ia better than the default variant and you can increase your rank. You shouldnt try to build something new but adopt and improve given strong Decks. Its a lot of fun!:)
---
Try and be more like Kibler and be positive. He doesn't even get mad when he loses to an uninteractive combo deck :) 
---
I am positive?
---
Isn't this a contradiction? If you get watching streams to learn? Why don't you want to watch competitive gameplay? Where people are playing for real stakes and where casters can explain plays from both sides? If you want to learn match ups, I prefer tournament play. 
---
It is like watching poker with play money or real money. 
---
Furthermore, as get told by pro's often, RNG is something you work around. Card draw is also a kind of RNG. If your win condition is your 30th card, than you'll probably lose. So if you have the skill to navigate till that draw, than you showed (for most decks) better skill than other players.

---
&gt;Win-rate is not a measure of effectiveness.   
---
It, combined with the deck win rates, is a measure of whether a card could possibly be considered overpowered or not though.  
---
The implication is that when Rexxar IS played the player more often than not loses the match. Plain and simple.  
---
People can twist that how they like but if he's not considerably contributing to a large win rate (and hunter win rates aren't disproportionate) then he is not overpowered.  
---
Effective? Sure. A great card? Sure. Overpowered? No.  Not in the context of the current meta and all the other builds running around.  
---
I mean if people were really concerned about his power level and it was that massively contributing to hunter win rates you would assume (with a near 30% of matchups being hunter in recent times) we'd see more mind breaker but we don't because that would not be an ideal card to run (even though it has some decent flow on effect against odd baku/gen decks). Why wouldn't it be ideal though since it can effectively shut down Rexxar especially in control matchups? Because he's just not as powerful as people make out and the matchups aren't exactly polarizing even when he is played.  
---
&gt;If you actually think Rexxar's win-rate indicates his power, why are all the top Hunter decks still playing him?  
---
Utility for the tools he brings in long matches where he is useful.  Like any other tool in this game it's far from perfect.  People tend to forget the RNG aspect to him also.  
---
&gt; don't think Rexxar really needs a nerf though. For Hunter players, he provides an exciting comeback option that is a different experience every game. For everyone else? He's a card that only hits the field when your opponent is on the defensive, making the game closer (and more exciting).  
---
This I tend to agree with.  The "overpowered" concept comes from "feelsbadman" syndrome which is what I've been eluding to.
---
&gt;Simple, he went 11-10 at rank 20. You could do it with 30 random cards. 
---
Small correction, 55% would be 11-9. 11-10 would be 52%
---
This is why Trump got elected.

Fun suggestion: Replace one Shattered Sun Cleric(or another 3-mana minon) with \[\[Stormwind Knight\]\]. It lets you deal 28(36 if you have a coin) damage for 10 mana from an empty board(Stormwind Knight + Power Word: Shield + Divine Spirit + Divine Spirit + Inner Fire).

Serious suggestions: Once you get \[\[Radiant Elemental\]\], and \[\[Shadow Visions\]\], you should add those into your deck.

---
What could I drop the face collector for?

First of all, keep in mind that everyone on the internet is an actual person (with the exception of the Russian bots), and if you actually want them to dignify you with a response, consider treating them that way.
---
Pretty much the entire basis of your rant is that I have a huge bias toward control decks, which is absolutely untrue. I have a bias toward \*interactive and varied gameplay\*. I think games are more fun when players have agency over what happens in them and feel like their decisions matter, and when they play out meaningfully differently from one another. 
---
My most played deck this month is Book of Specters Mage. My next most played deck is midrange Elemental/Dragon/Evolve Shudderwock Shaman. After that, it's Master's Call hunter, and then finally Aggro-Rush warrior. Zero of these decks would be accurately described as "control".
---
I'm not going to go point by point through your rant - because that's what it is, a rant, and I have other things to do with my time. But the most important point you seem to be missing is that Wild Growth and Nourish are classic cards, and they were changed because otherwise they would be too fundamental to every Druid deck forever. You argue that once UI rotates, Druid ramp won't be good, but that's just not how Hearthstone works. Wild Growth has always been the most important card in every Druid deck that played it. Nourish may not have seen as much play in the Force of Nature/Savage Roar era, but that's because Druid decks had incentive to push midgame damage to combo finish opponents, and there weren't as many big powerful end game card like there are now. Mana ramp is fundamentally a design constraint, and both Wild Growth and Nourish were too good to leave in the game permanently moving forward. 
---
You ask "what will druids ramp out when UI is gone?!?!?!1111" Well, this may come as a shock, but there will be NEW CARDS coming out in the future. I'm sure there will be big flashy powerful new things Druids will want to play ahead of schedule. 
---
Also, 3 mana wild growth and 6 mana nourish are \*currently\* seeing play in decks high on Legend ladder. The idea that they're somehow nuked from orbit and won't ever be seen again is just wrong. 
---
 
---
As for Hunter decks being as similar as Druid - you honestly have to be joking if you think the similarities between the existing hunter decks is anything close to the ramp druid decks pre-nerf. You could literally get to like turn ten and still have NO IDEA what your opponent's deck was, because it was just Wild Growth, Nourish, Spellstone, Branching Paths, etc. Maybe Malfurion or Spreading Plague could clue you in that it wasn't Taunt Druid, but you'd have multiple powerful Druid decks within 5-6 cards of each other. The power came from the core of Ramp plus removal plus sustain, with the ramp being the part that's in the classic set and would distort the game forever if it weren't changed.
---
I hope that's enough to stop you from frothing at the mouth with misplaced seething hatred for me. 
---
I mess around and make one every now and then but never will i ever play ranked with a deck I create unless it‚Äôs got a high win condition in casual (ie. mecathun druid)
---
Nice winrate btw.
---
Luckily psychic scream rotates out soon so that should help somewhat but otherwise I tend to agree with a lot of what you're saying.  
---
Except "most" uninteractive over Warrior? Hard call.
---
&gt; Rogue seems to not get any good spells lately, 
---
Raiding Party disagrees.
---
a) It's only 1 deck since shudderwock nerf, sad divercity for mains b) It's weaker since priests decided to counter hunters and accidently counter even shamans too. Also hs replay without premium is biased towards low ranks, check [VS meta report](https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-117/). It's tier-2 now.

---
Paladin has been in a fairly aggressive position for the past 2 years, but I think they might shy away from supporting that archetype for them for a while. Both it and Rogue are well positioned to leverage Baku the Mooneater in Standard.
---
Wild is a good place to be if you like aggro. Warrior's brief stint as an aggressive class still lives strong in Pirate Warrior. Shaman works aggressively too (though Even Shaman is more popular well rounded). Rogue and Paladin are still doing very well in their Aggro roles and looks unlikely to change.

There are tons of ways this could be implemented. Ban lists would help a lot, or rotating formats much like the most recent tavern brawl. My favorite idea is a playlist that has no rewards or gold tied to it, which removes all the hardcore grinders who put in endless hours with meta decks in casual just to grind gold. That should give meme decks a bit more breathing room, as there would be no incentive to play meta stuff in a format where you can't do quests, get get gold, etc. 
---
Another thought is that if they ever revamp the shit client then they could make something allowing for private lobbies where people could restrict the card pool, etc.
---
None of these are perfect solutions but it is a problem that could certainly be solved. An attempt for any of these things would be awesome in and of itself, even if its not perfect. 
---
I personally like challenges, however frustrating they are (e.g. Lich king with all classes). It makes me go into forums more to read and discuss tactics, and/or watch streamers attempt it. I actually turn off Kripp's stream this week when he switched from Arena to the Rumble Run.

---
&gt;Ah, here we are. Do you have any stats on this utility? Because if not, I don't know why you bring up stats in the first place, nor why you disregarded the other person's argument for lack of stats. You clearly don't require stats for all your arguments, so why do you require it of your conversants'?  
---
Because I'm not trying to imply a sense of Rexxar being overpowered which the numbers clearly do not illustrate. They illustrate a card that overall has a poor ability to lift the decks overall win rate but there must be the a good reason to run it which is the utility it brings to control match ups.  
---
Any stats around the benefit of utility are locked behind premium membership (matchup rates of each individual deck) which you would start to see win rate trends against say control decks with a rexxar/rexxarless deck.  
---
My point is simply to show statistics in response to the "rexxar overpowered, hunter overpowered etc. etc." statement that are made in an unfounded manner that clearly show Hunter does not have an oppresively higher win rate and Rexxar does not contribute hugely to the winrate.  I don't then need to jsutify why it's in decks if it has such a low played win rate - my job is done. 
---
If you or anyone else want to present valid data to support the argument of "overpowered hunter / overpowered hunter" then by all means do so but arguing "that win rate is so low you shouldn't even run that card so that doesn't prove it's not over powered" doesn't prove the argument at all.  
---
It doesn't even disprove the argument for it being well balanced in the scheme of things.  
---
6 mana 6/19 Black Knight w/ divine shield and taunt. Value overload.
---
Just make a mode where you cannot win quest/earn gold/count toward win. Casual is in its current state because people are either playing to complete the "play X cards" game where they just spam certain cards with no intention to win or "win X game as Y class" where the most efficient way is just to play a meta deck. Even if they are not, there is still an incentive for them to play the most effective meta deck to win gold for wining 3 games. Strip the game of the reward in a separate mode and people who go there is looking for nothing but fun.
---
Every top deck lethal is better than this one

Already replied, but some additional information... First, like that other person mentioned, might be wise to wait til the rotation if you want to spend money on a deck. Lots of cards will leave (so money wasted), lots of deck will die because not enough support, and new ones will appear.
---
And also, given that you're making a new account, apparently the new player experience is much better now because they added 25 "newbie ranks" (rank 50 to 26) so even if you don't have a great deck you can still play, and not face T1 decks and stuff as you would if you were rank 20. Apparently there's lots of rewards for leveling in that mode too, but I haven't tried it so not sure how good it really is. 
---
I'd give it a shot!
---
People will feel forced to play the mode if there is a pack in the end. 
---
Heard loads of people complain about this stuff. 
---
People being frustrated with a mode they don't want to play is bad for blizzard. 
---
I get what you are saying, but this is the "other side" of rewards. It can motivate, but it can also cause frustration. 
---
He's played in a tier 1 deck. I'd say that's relevant.
---
At that rate, might as well just HoF the entire Priest class.
---
He just said a word "lethal"
---
&gt;"a single card that can beat an entire deck is enjoyable".   
---
Oh right so I'm sure the implication of a statement like that wasn't that Rexxar is overpowered at all right?    
---
&gt; It said that Rexxar is a 1-card win condition against control that feels bad to lose to.  
---
It's not even close to being a "1 card win condition". There is still plenty more work and RNG to go through to actually win with it and as mentioned if it were even close to being so you'd expect to seeing a higher played win rate.  
---
I'm simply offering some counter evidence to the point of Rexxar being over powered or a "1 card win condition" if you want to mix words.  
---
Where is there anything to the contrary? Anything at all?  
---
Tesekkurler :)
---
Wild even shaman
---
Thank you so much. It is really nice to see people from our region in this subreddit :)
---
I think getting rid of win quests would go a LONG way in making people play sillier stuff in casual
---
LOL, he/she was ranting about his specific experience about Mecha'Thun Priest, the lack of counters and how to deal with it. My response directly addressed his specific poor experience against Mecha'Thun Priest by proposing the addition of Zihi if he was indeed encountering that many Mecha'Thun decks. So instead of directing this wonderful knowledge about Zihi to me, perhaps consider redirecting it to the OP who would benefit the most out of that conservation. As for me, I'll continue to give the OP the benefit of the doubt and assume he/she has an adequate understanding of the game who will ask more questions if he/she deems it necessary.
---
Is that including the overload cost?
---
Here is the solution.  Get RID of the STATISTICS.  Get rid of all the ways people can see what is good and what isn't based solely on numbers, stats, win %, card win %, mulligan %, etc.  This has ruined the game in my opinion.  This gives new players much easier access to "what truly works right now"  
---
Back in the day before this crap was available, people had to play a hundred games or so, or watch someone stream a deck for awhile to see if that particular deck was good or not.  And it still might not have been correct as people might not have figured out the best decks yet.  The streamer could have been playing against what people thought were the true tier 1 or 2 decks but were really just alright.
---
Homebrewing is where it's at.  MTG Commander / EDH / Highlander format was amazing to play because everyone had their own way to make a deck of a hundred cards, there were very little cookie cutter builds (I haven't played that format in about a year now).
---
Hearthstone can be fun and sometimes is, but it feels like it's going in the wrong direction.
---
Uh, kinda
---
Simple you use an algorithm based on a % used. I.e if the algorithm detects a hunter without any minions it‚Äôs not allowed in the ‚Äújank format‚Äù
---
If it detects cloning gallery with X minions it‚Äôs not allowed, uther with bounce etc etc.
---
Just update the list every wednesday (cause I mean TBrawl only exist for starvation at this point, literally 0 reason to not run it for 7 days other than forcing players to have 2 days of playing the other formats)
---
Just make a seperate format / custom game style that a player can ban cards and set up rules themselves if you are too lazy to code shit blizz.
---
Right because low played win rate = overpowered card. 8-|  
---
If you actually had a stance on the issue maybe you'd have a point to argue but you don't so you can stick with your 1 liners and otherwise trying to further an argument you've failed to make one way or the other. 
---
can you give more specific minions? I don't have all of those cards, so I'll try to include whatever I can
---
Obviously, sorry for not thinking it was worth checking the autocomplete for a Reddit comment. Thanks for the correction :)
---
My GPU fans don't spin up at all, basically idle temps. Just wanna add my 2c here because a lot of people say it's hearthstone. Played hs on 3 different PC's, one of them being near a decade old and never had performance issues.
---
&gt;Right so you're saying that it is overpowered with such a low win rate then?
---
No.  I am not.
---
&gt;Nothing overpowered, no 1 card win condition.
---
These are not the same thing, they don't belong in the same sentence.
---
&gt;win condition
---
A win condition is a card that wins you the game.  It has nothing to do with power level or played winrate.
---
For example, in the matchup of Spell Hunter against Warrior, Warrior can easily deal with your Spellstone boards.  Spellstone isn't really your win condition in that matchup, because you don't expect to win with it.  The way you expect to win the matchup is one of two ways:  1) you play Zuljin when they don't have a board clear and quickly knock them out before they can recover from the tempo swing; 2) you play Deathstalker Rexxar and make large zombeasts every turn until they run out of removal and you overwhelm them with value.
---
Spell Hunter usually loses against Odd Warrior, but in the games that it does win, many of them come down to playing Deathstalker Rexxar and clicking the hero power.  Whether or not it is overpowered, Deathstalker Rexxar is a *win condition* in that matchup.
---
Ehh going to disagree.  D3 runs great, wow is literally a decade and a half old, sc2 ran great.   
---
You need to force the psychic screams before you kathrena/Cube
---
You need to try to get the hysterias out while you have a egg on the board too.
---
This is a lot because preist is good into you but if you can't make their boardwipes bad you can't win. 
---
It's the best deck because every game is different. If I'm not completing quests it's almost always wild burgle rogue
---
Discard warloc. Lots of stats, just ignore the effects!
---
Or a mirror to non burgle rogue. Every once in a while I get lucky but it's usually a loss because you can't maintain the Cutlass
---
How about odd control warrior with Leeroy https://youtu.be/8KK-j4MV9Os
---
Assuming you mean they're also battlecry effects instead of "start of game" AND baku still somehow works with odd decks (my god we're doing a lot of stretching her) i think a blindfolded monkey drafting an arena deck would probably be a better idea.
---
That moment when my opponent buffed my minion for it to be &gt;18 atk to blow my mind. I didn't know what to do. I gave up.
---
Hi there. You appear to have been shadowbanned for some reason. Being shadowbanned means other users can't read your comments unless manually approved by a moderator, which is a bit of a hassle for us, and a hassle for you if no moderator is online to approve it for you.
---
Please contact the reddit admins by modmailing /r/reddit.com ([click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com&amp;subject=&amp;message=)) to resolve this matter.
---
In the meantime, I have approved your comment.
---
You're thinking of batstone, organised by Firebat. I do think a kind of semi-permanent alternate ruleset would be great. Dunno if banlists are the way to go though
---
I always greet at the beginning of the game, and a well played at the inevitable end (wether I‚Äôm gonna win or loose). Simple manners.
---
How?
---
Rogue, Warlock and Paladin are the ones with aggro/midrange decks that can be very aggressive.
---
sit down kid ur dia4 and masters lmao
---
most of the time if you don't concede people start emoting and playing random shit at the same time before killing you. nobody wants to see that.
---
 mieszko#2498 EU 80g quest - I'll show, you go first. 
---
Working as intended.
---
Because after first shrine effect you don't take any damage so there's nothing to convert. 
---
No one cares that much about the cards themselves (the minion itself) but the start of game effect. A nerf to that effect would destroy odd/even decks and a lot of people have invested in them.
---
It‚Äôs not gonna happen.
---
Some think it is BM. They are wrong and soul-less, but they do exist.
---
Yup. Every stupid cutesy legendary they make is 1 less legendary you open towards a productive deck.
---
This is my first time on this sub, I just wanted some commiseration or to see if I was being more annoyed than I needed to be by this.
---
Uhhh why would I not mul either of those cards, it's not an exodia deck you don't want those cards in your hand to start, since you have better cards that you want out of your deck
---
I guess it bothers me as much as when people waste their time and don't just kill me when they can... Pick your battles, eh? Haha
---
Also, to be fair, I'm complaining about the players and not the game.
---
Concede ...And the world fastest win for opponent.
---
If it was a good match, and you deserve the win, I won‚Äôt concede and let you have your kill.
---
If you‚Äôre playing a cancerous and un-interactive OTK deck, I won‚Äôt ever give you the pleasure. (Yes, I hate those fucking decks with a passion) 
---
If I‚Äôm end of the month grinding, I‚Äôll concede as soon as I spot lethal. It does save time, the quicker you get to the next game, the better.
---
I mean, unless you get the quest to do x damage to enemy heros no reason to complain about getting to your next match earlier
---
If we clear it once we get the card back ?
---
Back in my day, that would have almost been enough damage to take down a druid.
---
Please actually read OP's question and the comments.
---
sperm whales are one of the big reasons I don‚Äôt subscribe to the ‚Äòdolphins are not whales‚Äô definition - it shows how arbitrary the grouping is. sperm whales are toothed whales that aren‚Äôt part of the dolphin clade, and are counted as whales while dolphins aren‚Äôt. There are a few other non-dolphin toothed whales, like beaked whales. Apparently, toothed whales evolved echolocation after the split, which is pretty cool.
---
For me Hunter isn't fun to play against. It's all about having to (barely) stay alive in the early turns of these games. Often pure luck determines who will win. Sometimes you draw the required taunts / board clears, sometimes you don't. That's fine, now and then, but once you've seen the fifth Hunter in a row it starts to grate on you.
---
The only current deck that I dislike even more are all of the Mecha'Thun decks. Please, play your solitaire elsewhere.
---
"I'm playing since late Un'Goro" ah that explains everything.. You are being smacked in the face for only 1.5 years now. I didn't have any problem with leeroy either durig TgT or LoE. We've been facing Leeroy for 5 years now, talk to me about your feelings toward the card in 2022 when you reach 5 years of fun Times with Leeroy
---
sounds like you dont have an ssd.  blizzard games run great because they load and cache a ton of assets when the game is  first opened and in menu screens, that way everything is  much smoother during the actual gameplay. this is true for HS, d3, overwatch, sc2 (i dont play wow or hots so i dont know about them).   if you dont have an ssd the game will take forever to load and lag like crazy initially, because it takes so much longer for a normal harddrive to load everything.  
---
my cpu, motherboard, ram is 9 years old.  and as soon as i got a ssd couple years ago, all blizzard games ran perfectly smooth.
---
No problem. $12.99
---
Thanks for the response, and I can see where you are coming from. For me completing it and visually being able to see it is a kind of reward but I can appreciate that won‚Äôt be it same for everyone.

7/5/3 | Deathrattle: Summon every minion killed by this weapon.

After how things have gone for shaman basically since koft, it‚Äôs hard to be upset with how things are now.
---
Why would you put this over jaraxxus? You get more health in late game and 2 mana 6/6s.
---
Rank?
---
Not always a good pick. Jaraxxus is a ‚Äòwin more‚Äô card. If you‚Äôre already winning it helps you secure that. But with Elise, if you‚Äôre winning the pack helps you and if you‚Äôre losing you might get godlike rng from the pack.

He did but turns end after a certain time, you know.

I hate this experience when I'm trying something new. On the other hand I'm also contributing to this state. I guess that people play T1-T2 meta deck in casual mode because of 3 reasons:
---
1. they want to learn how to pilot those decks before moving to ranked
---
2. they want to farm gold - 10 gold per 3 wins - with 6 wins per day its 600-620 gold per month, \~2400 gold per expansion.
---
3. they want to complete their quests fast (win X games with Y class)
---
To address first point Blizz would need to develop additional game mode, I guess. To address points 2-3 Blizz would need to re-design rewards system which would be probably best approach for overall HS experience. We should be playing for fun and don't feel missing out of gold revenue. 
---
Where does Kripp find these opponents?
---
What happened to your kingsbane weapon? 
---
Well according to Moores law the situation should have already improved by 400%
---
It kills combo decks. You can also use it as a Loatheb after developing a board. It shuts down cards like psychic scream and flamestrike. 
---
&gt; Congrats, this might be the dumbest, most prejudiced grandiose statement I've seen in this sub yet, and that's really saying something...
---
&gt; This sub is just /r/butthurtIlost, in a nutshell, but it's definitely not hating on anything that specific.
---
Hmm.. seems like you're agreeing with him more so than not.
---
&gt; It means my bias is largely irrelevant.
---
Just as irrelevant as your opinion.
---
So, point in case. Glad you understand.
---
You can go online to the blizzard store and still get them if you want. $25.00 per adventure though if i remember correctly. 
---
Because of him I crafted sneed's. Have never ever regretted it.
---
Wow, that same guy played vs Kripp this evening at 4-0. So I'm guessing you lost this one.
---
I edited it to reflect the correct deck code
---
You shuffle on one turn and OTK them on the second with two Holy Wraths for 50 dmg.
---
This guy only managed to play it 14 times. Each cast is giving questing 2/3 due to effect. 
---
Maybe he would've been able to cast more without the questing animation but i doubt hed cast it 29 times. 
---
The goal is to draw your entire deck so that you can play a discounted Shirvallah, the Tiger + Time Out! + Augmented Elekk + Baleful Banker x2, adding two copies of Shirvallah into your deck. On the next turn you Holy Wrath twice to do 50 damage. 
---
*plays snail*
---
So gambling simulator, essentially. Nice one, Blizz. 
---
Sorry but you can‚Äôt break my record m. My opponent insta-conceded.
---
Deadly shot, Hunter's mark and Ironbeak owl are all possible outs.
---
I don‚Äôt see what problem you are solving with that. In order to use dust, you need to go into the collection manager and the crafting option anyway.
---
Clone priest is probably not the best choice unless you already have most of the cards. I strongly recommend reading VS reports https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/vs-data-reaper-report-117/

That's why I play face only decks‚Äîto be able to understand my opponent's Health
---
$12.99 per each additional deckslot, up to 27
---
Yeah but most of the cards in the set are great, like flamewakers and dragons, plus major-domo gives you easy win against lich king as paladin
---
Thanks
---
Normally I‚Äôd agree with you, but it started with his card game ‚ÄúThe Bazaar‚Äù failing to meet it‚Äôs fundraising goal at IndieGoGo (and the official subreddit for it now only gets maybe one post every few days).
---
Combine that with professional Hearthstone declining (taking away a lot of TempoStorm‚Äôs revenue). 
---
And now, out of nowhere, Reynad is back to streaming Hearthstone and his Twitch viewership is way up accordingly? Yeah, I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs to generate revenue, but it‚Äôs only a hypothesis.

Pretty hard once you reach rank 15. You‚Äôll see big priest a lot and it‚Äôs cancerous. Even I play it.

Kanbu#2306 EU 80G Q.

What about Raiding Party to draw the Swashburglars and Cutlass? Could include Greenskin if you want another Pirate for consistency 
---
Heartharena is the one he's using I think, you get it through overwolf, just Google heartharena overwolf download or something like that and you'll find it

He hit concede instead of dropping his 3 pre-nerfed corridor creepers I just don't get it.
---
Added you. I'm Vivi#11889

Ah the PoE way
---
But if you have already beaten the thing and you want to try out certain ones it can be s nightmare finding it
---
its fun to play but quite annoying to play against, I seem to be ussualy unlucky against them,pulling crazy combos out of their ass
---
No it's tempo. It's in the name !
---
There is indeed 0 real aggro decks in standard right now (just remember what Pirate War and Aggro Shaman could do if you think Odd Rogue is aggro). Is it a problem ? I'd say yes, we could use 1 or 2 of them to crush those fucking Big Priest.
---
indiegogo isn't kickstarter, flexible funding is a thing and apparently you know reynad personally
---
Because when you play the combo, you kill your opponent in one turn. 
---
well I thought that you can have aggro tempo. What is the difference between the two?
---
You could always self motivate instead.
---
I usually play control decks, right now I am into playing odd quest warrior.
---
What do you think about putting Myra‚Äôs in odd rogue? I‚Äôm don‚Äôt play much odd rogue but I do play a lot of other rogue decks and Myra‚Äôs is really good.
---
I try to maintain a deck for each class. I play both Wild and Standard. Coupled with classes with more than one competitively viable deck (ex. Zoo and Evenlock) and I'm all out if deck slots.
---
I'll hit you at night, but it's a bad deck, be warned
---

---
I've been watching Kripp for a few years now. I feel like he's become a much happier person in general. Glad to see it.
---
Controlling, reactive decks tend to have a higher ceiling than aggressive decks. That's why they tend to be over represented at tournaments generally. It has little to do with the format on ladder being control oriented, which if it is anything, its midrange right now.
---
Even then, card games always have an uphill battle in being entertaining to watch as an esport.
---
I feel like a "Hello" is really the power play here. That's the real "Do you feel lucky, punk?"

It is pretty common for the bot owners to also make real posts on accounts. If the bot is very narrow in what subreddits it posts on, and the person also is on those subreddits and makes relevant comments, it makes it notably harder to detect a bot vs a real account.

"And on the 15th of January, in the year 2019, our prothet R__Man, told us the way of how we live today" - some teacher in 3588
---
I thought that midrange hunter typically had around a 50% win rate. I'm not entirely sure. I don't have the stats, so fi you could provide it that would be great to use as a reference. Just from personal experience I hated playing the ladder because of all the druids that I would come up against. It never felt like the game was progressing. It was either a giant wall, or they just keep cycling towards their win condition. Either case they always have so much armor that you just feel like giving up at turn 8. 
---
I'm not sure "brain cell" is an argument, as it is a different play style. I know when I play hunter it is about how to set up the next turn to get a good board, play around aoe for my spellstone, or even baiting with the secrets that I play, but that is the style of a midrange deck.
---
With control, or combo pieces, it is about just putting a stop to the game until you have your condition to win. 
---
So if you just don't like the amount of hunters in play, and you really want to counter it you can go with odd warrior, or maybe even odd rogue.
---
Just personally speaking, I'm not a fan of playing against druids pre-nerf because of all the control pieces that they had and how much it just felt like I wasn't making progress in the game.
---
the problem is that no matter how casual the mode is, some people really like to win. you cant do much about this. the only true casual is singleplayer and tavern brawl sometimes.

They changed the mod about a week or two ago, and made the buckets you are offered more relevant (before the change I had a couple of runs with the paladin buff shrine with 0 buffs offered for example), as well as nerfing some of the most OP bosses.
---
I think it's pretty enjoyable right now. In the end this mode shouldn't just be a lottery to see how many decent buckets you get, and more about the crazy interactions.

Pulled up that one too. Was even funnier with 3 double shrine. Still lost at the last boss tho

Really great guides!

I found odd gris quite boring, odd Jaune kept things nice n lively for me 
---
Obviously OP is a newer player.
---
But that would help to shatter the illusion of value in packs. Last thing Blizzard wants in a CCG. 
---
Same I think
---
The free legendary i got from my login bonus is so confusing. The paladin one?
---
Artifact as a pay-upfront game was always on borrowed time if you ask me, because they have to release a mobile version soon and that shit doesn't fly there.

He owns Tempo Storm. I doubt Twitch is his primary form of income.

Turn 5 manari into opponent ooze is my favorite.

Join me in rank 10. I play even hunter lol

He's hardly all in on the adventurer...
---
Hm, thats a side of orcas i didnt know about
---
Are there turns past 7? I seem to be dead to odd pally and odd rogue before then.
---
What futuristic utopia are you living in where you suppose it's so simple to add another deck slot?  Must be a heck of a place where people have spent the last 30 years growing up with technology all around them and small indie companies employ people who can write code...
---
Thanks for letting people know what's up! I love my greedy wild nzoth druid list!
---
100% recommend any new players start with Trump's Teachings as the other comment said. Don't be put off by the age. The basic tenants apply to any TCG and are far more important to your overall success than just learning cards and decks right now.
---
Interesting read, kinda makes me not wanna play wild lol, I could see how it would be annoying as the meta could likely get very stale and the amount of brokeness must be absurd.  I mean I am annoyed by some of the stuff in standard so just imaging wild...  Anyway sounds like you've had a great run so congrats.  See you on the flip side.
---
End of month rewards, bragging rights, and just generally trying to be fighting among the best? 
---
I came here hoping you were asking for more Quests, as in the legendary 1-mana spell cards from Journey to Un'Goro. With JtU cycling out soon, I do hope we get new quest cards, those spells made for very interesting decks, since they were always guaranteed to be in your starting hand.

If you're a new player I wouldn't spend any dust at all (or dust any cards beyond playable copies) until the next expansion. There are plenty of ways to have fun and get better in the meantime, and then you'll be in much better shape to craft at least 1 tier 1 deck next expansion, full of cards you'll be able to use for at least the next full year.
---
I tried for along time to play meme decks in casual. You would think that would be the place to go. 
---
The reality is that if you want to play roulette Mage, or Renounce Darkness Warlock, or Burgle Rouge, etc. you just acknowledge that \~ 80% of the games you play - even in casual - will be a Tier level deck that will probably stomp you, and you just hold out for that fun, interesting match up.
---
Idk what‚Äôs wrong with this thread baron wins games 
---
That's quite a false equivalency comparing an AI (a really bad one at that which doesn't update its decks to reflect the meta) to real human players when you could literally recreate exactly what you're asking for on your own.
---
It's already dead.
---
It wouldnt have taken much to push artifact much closer to hearthstone.
---
If it had just launched FTP, like any sensible company would have done, it would have 3x the players currently.
---
Guess it depends on the context. Anyone using emotes all game comes off as childish/taunting, but a "Greetings" at the beginning and a "Well Played" at the end is pretty common once you get to higher win games in Arena/higher on ladder I feel like.

I have no problem with the secrets. 
---
I have no problem with the spells. 
---
I have no problem with the deathrattles. 
---
What I do have a problem with is deathstalker rexxar being able to beat every single control deck out there. They need silence? Hoot hoot. Lifesteal? Bam. Board clear? Bam. Rush? Bam. Avoiding fatigue damage? Raptor. 
---
I used to love deathstalker rexxar back on release but now it's beast pool is huge. One of the most annoying zombeast to fight for me is a Hydra with lifesteal.
---
Aggressive beast based hunter decks can drop an early rexxar and transition from aggro to control smoothly. It's such an insanely strong card and I can't wait for it to go to wild. I wish it would get nerfed.

Could‚Äôve gotten the same outcome with 1 card
---
I have nostalgia for physically trading cards, but I just don't think it's possible to recreate that in a meaningful way in a digital game. You need kitchen table-like formats and local scarcity for that kind of stuff to work.
---
Yeah it's not my favorite deck but after facing so many I just looked for a deck that dominated hunter and here we are. 20-9 vs hunter, 9-5 vs rogue the 2 most played classes I played against. Overall record was 52-28 with paladin.
---
Hardly. Have you forgotten about Deathstalker Rexxar?

Zalae doesn't really rope on "autoplay turns" or turns with little available options. He just thinks through turns where he has multiple lines of play (and often ropes those). People like OP's opponent would rope on every turn, regardless of the situation.

I'd rather have auto squelch than tournament mode thanks

---
&gt;Instead of assuming that I don't know my own opinion, you should re-read my post and try to figure it out for yourself. As I said, not every discussion on this subreddit is about whether DK Rexxar is OP.  
---
I need not figure anything out.  If you're too lazy to simply state it then that is on you.  
---
&gt;Seems like the poster is talking about the "1 card win condition" thing, with no mention of the power level of the card.  
---
&gt;a single card that can beat an entire deck is enjoyable".  
---
Whilst that may be your interpretation that simple statement that I quoted to them (not you) and they never corrected my interpretation (remembering here you've taken it on yourself to fight this crusade on their behalf coming from an ill-informed position) implies they believe the card is overpowered.  
---
They aren't stating "1 card win condition" as many cards could be (which is why it's a pretty silly stance for you to take but you seem set on it) - they are stating 1 card that can beat an entire deck.  
---
&gt;their entire deck, that was designed to beat hunters, lost to a single card.  
---
This too implies they believe the card is overpowered (and it's hyperbole at it's finest of course) but I'm sure you'll believe it means something else.
---
As I said, I posed the overpowered argument to THEM and they did not correct this stating "no I did not mean that" - you decided to do that yourself and being that you are not they - to put this incredibly simply, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about when it comes to other people's thoughts and intentions if they have not clearly stated them as such. :)  
---
The whole "mind your own business" concept comes to mind.  
---
Now if you wanted to further your own argument and stance that's fine but please stop pretending to know what other people do or do not think.  
---
&gt;Your alternative definition of a "win condition", from what I can understand, is a card with a high Played Winrate on hsreplay.   
---
Feel free to quote where I stated this.  all I simply stated is that Rexxar is not overpowered as it does not have a massively disproportionate win rate that would be expected to see if it were an overpowered card used in the context and situations that it is used.  
---
I don't recall saying anything about "1 card win condition = played win rate" you're the person who decided to introduce that concept to other people's argument. :)  
---
&gt;It's hard to get more specific because it is an abstract concept, which is why I provided an example to go with the definition.  
---
It's not abstract - it's generalized. I have already clarified this for you.  
---
Each card contributes to setting up win in it's own manner and removing the generalization comes from being more detailed in what you want to say.  
---
I would more call Rexxar a card that balances the field, gives you a chance (which is what I eluded to wayyy back in my original post) against Warrior and no where near being a win condition as you are still quite likely to lose.  Without seeing the data I'm not going to guess at how much of a swing Rexxar plays in what is a very bad matchup for hunter either way at 39% against odd quest warrior.   
---
You could still call it a win condition if you like just as you could call holding an emerald spell stone up your sleeve to play late game after clearing more control a win condition etc. etc. - it's all situational.  
---
Further to this is for some reason spell hunter was singled out here and there are more decks that run this than just spell hunter and each deck has more conditions that boot it's win rate against warrior.  
---
For example Secret hunt lifts to around 50% win rate - so we certainly can't say that's down to Rexxar.

---
is an awful card. I'm all about overstatted cards with a drawback but you're getting +2 health over vanilla for a huge downside.
---
It looks like the filter that goes on when you queue stayed there for some reason.
---
cool, thanks
---
I definitely misread what you said! My bad! 
---
I completely agree with you, and it's refreshing to see someone who has the same opinion. I actually don't think UI is that overpowered (look how much play it sees now), but as you said the two cards go together very well. UI singlehandedly removes nourish's weakness, and has even made naturalize see play when it was previously considered trash.
---
I think honestly wild growth deserved a nerf for the same reason fiery war axe did, but nerfing nourish was overkill as will be shown in the rotation.
---
Excellent, thanks. Is it likely Leeroy will be HOF'd? I guess no harm in crafting him anyway

What has actually killed Hearthstone for me is MTG: Arena. It's sad to look back on all the years I've played Hearthstone and leaving it all behind, but when I tried MTG: Arena when it came into open beta in October, I had more fun in 1 month than I have ever had with my almost 5 years of playing Hearthstone.
---
Odd paladin probably
---
Midrange hunter also pretty good
---
Odd rogue not as good of a win rate but doing decent and fast games
---
Yeh my friend has a hybrid secret/spell hunter deck and I lose 3/4 games, what cards can I add to counter that deck?
---
Nope.
---
This is about the 80 gold Play with a friend quest.
---
A lot of people trade those to get double value (160 gold). 
---
odd pally is the best to climb.
---
I personally use a combo and just play the matchups of the day, if I see a lot of priests I'll roll odd secret mage if i see hunter I'll roll odd pally if I'm seeing warriors I'll roll otk pally and if i see a lot if odd pally I'll go odd quest war.
---
theres no safest deck to climb it all matters on what's being played that day
---
I just did it on mobile and I'm pretty sure you can do it even faster on PC

If anyone doesn't know, I've got 4 Shirvallah's in the deck now. (It died just before the screenshot) - and I'm gonna blast my opponent for 50 damage in the face :) 
---
You're right flamestrike is so damn RNG I just don't even put it in my deck anymore, so inconsistent.
---
Is it APM priest? If it has topsy turvy, Stonetusk Boar and test subject, it's a combo that allows you to have a charge minion with infinite attack. 
---
I feel like the replacement isn't for Loatheb, but for Dr. Boom or any other big drop currently in your deck. Sure, you don't want to play it on curve in aggro mirrors but against any other kind of deck it's as fast as Dr Boom. 
---
The issue I find with Odd Rogue in some games is that you simply run out of cards on turn 7 and your topdecks are nowhere as good as say Even Shaman. It's not a perfect card in the deck by any means but it is a great card to have.
---
random is good, but suboptimal decks are not
---
It's a nice little streak and I feel like I'm playing well lately, but nobody's that consistent in the long run. Maybe I'll go 3-3 next.
---
We have seen this a thousand times. Sorry. 
---
Do you have a better example? Something closer to Hearthstone? Something that has more than 18 customizable slots? Please I'm all ears.

&gt; Runescape Chronicles
---
I'm so sad that that game shit the bed, it was dope. I really think a LoL CCG with Runescape Chronicles gameplay style would be stellar. Fixed game times provide the need for your deck to do it's thing *fast* and stop some games from dragging on for an hour like MTG sometimes can.
---
Nah it's not APM. Its kinda like Hakkar Quest but without Hakkar and Mind Blast combo instead 
---
How do I cap my fps? 
---
Random minion spawns every turn. You get some 2/4s but have no control of which lane they go in (unless you play with a single, bad hero).
---
Does it run the Spellstone? Maybe the combo is having a Malygos and multiple Velens with Nightmare. 
---
There is a minion with battlecry: destroy all enemy secrets (there's an old one and one in standard, sorry forgot the name but you can find it if you search cards for "secret" and look at neutral minions).  Also tar creeper (for wolves) and crystallizer (for the deal 2 dmg secret).
---
Big thing is knowing how to play against secrets.  Sometimes you need to just clear them even if you are fairly sure it's gonna kill your minions, just so you can rebuild your board.  Other times it's better to not attack and pass your turn if you don't have a way to deal with the secret (if it's deal 2 dmg, then pass and once he plays a minion, attack his minions instead).  A nice trick is if you are pretty sure his secret is wandering monster, play deadly poison and attack his face to kill it.
---
Always kill the hyena.  
---
There's not a good answer to spellstone that is what odd rogue has the hardest time with.  So an early spellstone is just tough for you to deal with point blank.  Tar creeper helps here.  Basically if he's going nuts with spellstones you just gotta hope you can burst him down before you die.
---
Can you dust any legendary cards gotten from adventures? I've been playing since the first season and have done some of the adventures but not all. I dusted all the shitty naxx legendaries that went into wild but is it possible to get more legendaries that I can dust from doing adventures? 
---
Yeah I've tried that too and in most cases I cant get lethal because I'll use Velen + Vivid + Double Coin + mind blast and that's only 20. And there aren't enough good minions to get any face beforehand
---
Amen 
---
Priest have many odd cost tools. But in the end, why even have a odd deck for a 4 health hero power in this meta?
---
I believe it's unlikely, but people suggesting it could be HoFd worry me. No harm in crafting him anyway like you said. 
---
You're completely right - forgot that ending as a 5/1 was a possibility that would impact the odds of surviving the second Hysteria!
---
MTG has literally 25 years of experience under their belt, it's issue has always been getting such a complex system to work cleanly for quick play online. Arena seems to pull it off, with the minor problem of still needing to hit "next" a few too many times. All UI stuff that can and will be fixed...just extremely and annoyingly slowly.
---
You can squelch your opponent if you are tired of lyour opponents emotes.
---
Hodor !
---
In a deck that needs to reach the end as fast as possible that is not good. And also if it drawn during the cycling it can be useless, hence not a zero mana card
---
Click on your opponent's face and then click "squelch". Snowflake. 
---
I think they more specifically said some people like beating their opponents using worse cards. These people don't mind having a low winrate when they get to laugh at their meta deck opponent getting stomped by surrender priest every once in a while. It sounds like you aren't the type of player Blizzard meant.
---
agreed. the problem is really(IMO) that valve was a great indie developer and made great games. but they have become rusty. lost touch. They became another triple A company that pushes shoddy games loaded with microtransactions.
---
As it stands I think counterstrike source was fine, and CS Go was released solely to port the Tf2 cosmetic model to make millions
---
The *only* reason you don't play Hearthstone is because you have to click twice on a small fraction of your opponents?
---
U try to grind out the enemies health. Put him to 50 with Alex and kill him next or ship him down with just a Velen after clearing his board. Sometimes it stays a turn then vlvet into kill
---
Weird way to spell "MTG Arena".
---
I couldn't disagree more.
---
Most quests were either insta-win, or infinite value. Two things that shouldn't be in Hearthstone. 
---
Especially when the infinite value is insanely cheap, like the warrior's quest. 
---
I dont follow Artifact, how much has it fell from the expectation? is it a dead game?
---
If you take off your glasses, you should see it clearly cause two negatives make positive.
---
I played around with Thijs's list a little bit and it's kind of okay:

If time is money that must make you the time master. 
---
Apparently ima have to stray from public opinion lol.
---
I think this is great idea, although i don't see it happening unless things get dire.
---
Anything to do with the internet is a cesspool of disrespectful children and raging idiots. It's not just the Hearthstone community - it's every game.
---
Lyra without radiant doesn't seem worth it.
---
lol
---
I'm curious, did you play the game?
---
Honestly I‚Äôve been watching a lot of artifact streams and it‚Äôs shocking how much RNG there is for a game that was marketed as not being RNG heavy. Like, so many games are decided based upon where creeps spawn, which space your hero goes into (totally random), whether your attack arrows curve or not, there are all sorts of 50/50 chances for effects  to proc, etc etc. 
---
No card game is ever going to be RNG free (maybe bridge?) but artifact is basically no better than hearthstone. 
---
If you're OK with an aggressive, combo-y control deck, I recommend Control Priest. Extremely strong.
---
Just be aware it has a bit of a learning curve.
---
That‚Äôs a stupid opinion and I hate you. 
---
&gt;actually, yes it's.
---
FTFY
---
Why is Tacos capitalized though
---
Also came here to say such a thing. Truth on both counts. 
---
I think priest is just bad without shadow visions. Besides, half the decks OTK you or smash you in a 2-turn unrecoverable board state, idk if the hero power would be doing much.
---
   
---
Besides Amara is way better for stalling.
---
That's a very bad way to look at it
---
:'(
---
Gratz!
---
Yeah but if my opponent says ‚Äúwell played‚Äù I don‚Äôt see it as BM to say it back. Idk I guess it just me. Not for nothing but it was a mirror match so it 100% could have been the other way around
---
3 Mana spawn a 3/3 wolf for your opponent next turn.
---
It gets tricky around rank 20, whizbang is all memes and no good.
---
i played paper modern for years. I doubt you go backwards because the coding is a nightmare
---
oh wow. That actually appears to be the exact kodo model and running animation directly from WoW. Never realized that.
---
why would it?
---
But it fails because you can't tutor out inner fire or glitter moth currently. Also glittermoth is hot stinky garbage.
---
It is very easy to hit the 18 deck limit.   You have standard decks and wild decks.  For each deck, sometimes I have 2 or 3 variants of it with different tech cards.(\*\*)
---
Also, I keep decks around for specific daily challenges, e.g.  "Play 6 weapons",  "Play 20 Murlocs", etc.
---
\*\* Instead of having different variants of a deck with only 1 or 2 cards different, I'd like to have a single deck with some extra cards tagged as game-time decisions; When you start a game with the deck, Hearthstone should prompt you to choose X out of Y cards.  That way I might have 28 core cards and then another 2 cards I want to choose from a pool of 5 tech cards based on the local meta at my rank, etc.    Probably too hard for hearthstone devs implement...

"If you need cards from wild for a deck I would advise just crafting the few cards that are still viable over buying 40 packs and hope you get one of the legendary cards"
---
these things are the same in non wild packs outside of classic. 
---
Yup
---
Well yea, if you said well played in response to the loser's "well played" it can't be bm. I guess people just become unreasonable when they become frustrated lol.
---
I don't really think we need more.

 Wouldn't mind having Standard and Wild decks in different slots (counts of 18) though.

Glittermoth + innerfire is great, but it doesn't beat plain old divine spirit inner fire combos
