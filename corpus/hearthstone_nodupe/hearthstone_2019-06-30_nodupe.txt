This is painful to watch, literally non interactive, this game is getting sadder and sadder to watch and play
---
Yeah, that's pretty much it. Just forgot to say 'good Big Priests' in my comment. Since Big Priest is like the only Priest deck I ever see in wild I hadn't even bothered specifying it.
---
Snoops#0416, NA, trading 80g quest. Explain to me how to show the quest and I'll show, you go first. Thanks
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.  I know it has a few strong counters, but my point is that you tend to get absolutely stomped every time if you aren't playing a counter deck.  This means that the only really viable decks for serious climbing are mage and mage counters.  It pushes all decks that don't counter it out of the game, *even if those decks counter the t1 decks*.  
---
Mage either gets countered or it absolutely stomps. There is hardly any middle ground.  That's what it means to polarize the meta, and that's my main point.  That mage is creating a polarized field, because CC just destroys any deck that can't board clear.
---
I don't mind the restriction on streaming hearthstone, but a blanket restriction on any streaming sounds a bit much imo.
---
It depends on the meta. During Kobolds, Priest had a couple healthy variants. Raza was nerfed but still a completely viable deck, Dragon and Control decks were strong, and Shadow Visions allowed the Divine Spirit/Inner Fire combo to be viable but not top tier. Then Blizzard printed a fuck ton of Ressurect effects and nothing else even remotely playable and Priest has been pigeonholed into one type of deck.
---
By that definition every deck has mana cheating. I'm talking about 8/8s for 4 mana, or 2/7 taunts for 1. 
---
You're talking about regular ass hearthstone, like [this](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Faceless_Summoner)
---
Firebat’s losing face is the saddest thing in the known universe. It breaks my heart every time.
---
Yup, and I gotta scratch that itch every time by paging through the collection and tapping each and every one.
---
Would be a fun game mode to play in but locking such an RNG fiesta behind a paywall would be a terrible idea.
---
"so, at the expense of developing no tempo before that really isn't a huge issue."
---
This really depends on what deck you are facing, like if you face a murloc shaman,mech hunter,tempo mech rogue, you wouldn't be saying that.
---
Especially when you compete in big tournaments with money on the line.
---
He's slowly absorbing him.
---
It’s only during your regions games that you can’t stream.
---

---
Yes I read all the above posts. Picking IF/DS is a bad example for the reasons I described. Read the last line of their comment "Point is any class having a combo...is an example unhealthy loop" sounds like they have a specific problem with IF/DS afterall (which was the focus of the comment you replied to) but also dislikes other evergreen win conditions. 
---
General dislike of evergreen win conditions is also an issue since removing them all would make class playability completely dependent on Blizzard creating new viable win conditions and would be a huge problem on rotations. Blizzard's pushed archetypes fail often so removal of evergreen win conditions would almost certainly make some classes completely unplayable post rotation and perhaps even longer if subsequent expansion-introduced win conditions aren't viable.
---
Whatever Kharazan cost. 
---
Buying packs just removes all incentive for me to play. It's more fun to earn gold and try to build another new deck.
---
RegisKillBin. I can't say enough good things about this man. He interacts with his followers and maintains a positive attitude all the time. His stream is so fun to participate in, and I find myself looking forward to his YouTube videos.
---
Cards that destroy Secrets are fine because you can still play Secrets and win, although heavily disadvantaged. Having the minion you need to resummon to win not being able to be resummoned means that your deck automatically loses to one tech card no matter what.
---
I know what I'm doing, but if I've committed to characters A B and C as my front line, and the game offers me enough copies to make 2-star copies but not 3-stars, I'm kinda hosed unless or until I pay gold for rerolls.  and that shizz gets expensive pretty damn fast
---
What if card with 'cheated' mana costs actually kept the cost they were played at. You put down a sea giant for 5 mana, Conjurors makes to 5 mana minions instead.
---
To add to this. Its costs 1 after your opponent plays loatheb. Its hard coded to cost 1

I am a high legend player that streams from time to time , might be more frequent soon, planning to stream rank 25 to legend in wild next month. I answer most-all questions in chat so some hearthstone teachings can be applicable to both standard and wild and will be useful for you, do watch me if you are interested
---
It was too good but it’s just not worth it for 2 mana. There needs to be some sort of middle ground without killing the card. There’s a good reason why absolutely no one plays it now.

Not with that attitude it isn't.

Yeah play a legend deck on rank, it's crazy
---
To be fair, magic would not work on mobile at all. It barely works in mtga. If that game didn't have the history of magic behind it, it would be dead. There are just so many clunky things.
---
What mech hunter deck were you using?
---
I thought I covered that topic as well.
---
Why would it be weird if it's a legendary dragon from the classic set.
---
So you didn’t need the rest, just the Shudderwock part.
---
Looks pretty good but the Hero Power is probably fine without the inclusion of cost reduction. It would make the card less busy as well.
---
Are you sure you read my comment properly.
---
Honestly, this is the real issue with grandmasters. It's too damn long and there's just too much hearthstone every week.
---
Well, that and it's just a big middle finger to anyone who isn't in it competitively speaking. It's to the point where legend ladder kind of sucks dick because all the semi pros don't have a reason to try.
---
That’s Numberwang!

I still didn't get it after all this time, but it seems to make a reference to Indiana Jones ?

Last time I checked it was well over $1k I’m afraid. Been playing since beta and was stupid enough to wipe my collection TWICE when trying to quit a few years ago, only to have to build it from scratch when I came back.
---
No, you could’ve cut the bullshit. That not the same as the shit example you gave.
---
I thought this was cardstone sub
---
That's why you stay in rank 20 wild. Nearly everyone plays fun meme decks (aside from the occasional big priest, fuck big priests) and if you rank up just concede back to rank 20.
---

I don't want to play that fucking arsehole unless I have no minions and opponent has nothing but 6+/6+ minions (or alternatively the only minion on board is my 1/1), even when playing that shitty Toki (and I normally love RNG Mages, and she should be the best one there ever was). I just have no trust in the cunt anymore.

---
Baby Teferi reinforced Esper Control.
---
I guess that's true. It's my own experience but  it was like at first there were very few cards or sets that had many interesting effects and you basically just had an attack deck with staples a couple different techs. Then there were robust effects and a lot of different strategies evolved, some game breaking. I feel it's been downhill ever since, in terms of ridiculous effects and powercreep.
---
Maybe not the best card ever but certainly somewhere near...  
---
Or maybe it's because all the DK's were alongside him and I have no idea what he'd do in this meta without them..
---
My bet is Midrange Hunter would be miles better right now...
---
Fair enough.
---
Except you actually can't do that. It's literally programmed to place the mines down after the first click so you can't lose immediately.
---
Still too overpowered, remove battlecry

Plus, rager doesn't make sense if it's not a 5/1, 5/2 or 1/5, so maybe name it Icewreathed Faceless idk if you can think of something better but yeah.

Mech Priest O_o
---
That description definitely defines Artifact, Valve's recent card game. People were interested in it and kept calling it "the Hearthstone killer", but its economy was so bad the game was dead in the water almost instantly. It has like almost not even a triple digit number of people playing it, I heard.
---
MTGA is decent, but I find that people give it too much credit. Blue as a color is more rage inducing than anything I've ever played against in Hearthstone, barring maybe some priest decks here and there. I find that the matches spiral a lot more quickly and obviously as well. People don't really appreciate that Hearthstone can use its digitization to make awesome effects like Discover, Joust, card generation in general, etc.. MTGA is just a transcription of a paper card game, and does not innovate on this front at all.
---
As compared to what, the 60,000th thread about Control Warrior needing a nerf?
---
Anyone have tips on beating Kara Stamper when she has 0 mana. I keep losing to her :(
---
I'm at least getting a little enjoyment out of freeze mage, but most everything else is kind of a snoozefest.  Ive always been a mostly rogue player but I havent enjoyed a rogue deck since this xpac came out.   I miss the OLD myracle with striders and the deathrattle maly rogue from last year, but nothing will ever compete with the old miracle of a couple of years ago
---
Nice, skill based esports-Game.
---
So do I let's gooooo
---
Same I loved it
---
That's disingenuous and you damn well know it. No-one's saying Warrior isn't allowed to win with damage, just not damage by RNG shuffles into the deck.
---
Good one buddy
---
Thanks! Good Luck:-)
---
Divine Spirit + Inner Fire Decks. Such a dumb combo, dying to a minion that was a 3/8 at the start of turn sucks.
---
It was not fun since it’s all you saw. At least I’m tbis current meta I’m not seeing only warriors all of the time like with Patron. Patron would just wear me out.
---
The tipping point was definitely Synchros, from that point on it spiraled out of control. Before that the game just felt a lot more fair and controllable, Cyber Dragon was the high end of "cheating out" cards back then.
---
No, it's absolutely not. It's extremely rare that bomb "RNG" (it's just draw, present in every card game) actually matters. It's just a form of inevitability, which is a requirement for control to even exist.
---
Besides, it's not like you're proposing any alternative. You just complain about decks you lose to.
---
What the fuck. Why would they print that??? "3cmc: counter spells Don't exist for your opponent"
---
Try pirate warrior, that is fun to play ;)
---
Ofcourse, when you opponent rolled ShieldBlast 2 times in 3 turns, lol
---
Wait are you guys seriously still crying about warrior when mage can make a full board of 8/8s and 7/8s with taunt on turn 6?
---
I think Dr boom is just so good that it isn't worth trying to play any control deck that doesn't use him
---
Edit: Done with pistolpoet
---
It's a rank 7 game. I'm not surprised someone would make such a dumb misplay.
---
&gt;Before the set with small teferi came out, there was a deck that was just Teferi, Hero of Dominaria (has card draw, mana, removal, and a win condition all packed into one card) and then counterspells/removal. The stupidest thing was they could drop big T on 5, and then still have mana to counter your attempt to kill teferi. It completely dominated best of one before small teferi came and made most counterspells irrelevent.
---
Before war of the spark this was all I played on MTGA, spent over 100$ getting the cards for esper control focused on teferi.
---
You must be confusing it with Artifact.
---
You can’t attack on the first turn, though, like HS, so your opponent will have a chance to respond to your broken combo with their own broken combo. If you drop Alternative T1, it’s going to get destroyed. Drop it on turn *2* along with some disruption, though...
---
As for other archetypes, honestly I’m also out of date with the latest stuff - but decks like Nekroz, Kozmo, the new Sky Strikers, they’re all leagues ahead of Blue-Eyes. The archetype has been very powerful, but because of YGO’s constant set releases and powercreep no deck tends to stay on top for very long. But you are right - BEWD is iconic to the game, and Konami keeps printing new support for it to appeal to older fans, so it’ll doubtless have its moment in the sun again soon enough.
---
The way YGO is now, it’s just too fast for me. You go for broke straight away, and so does your opponent. There’s plenty of interaction still, because tons of negation and disruption effects had to be printed to combat the high speed and power of everything, but it’s hard to get your head around. 
---
For a broken combo... well, how’s this? There’s an archetype called Kozmo - it’s pretty cool flavour-wise, a fusion of the Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. They have ‘pilot’ monsters, which you can tribute during the Battle Phase to Summon bigger, stronger spaceships. From your deck. Like Dark Destroyer - a 3000 ATK bearer which, when summoned, destroys one of your opponent’s cards.
---
Basically what you did was use their field spell Kozmotown to shuffle cards into your deck and redraw a better hand, Summon any pilot, use a card like Emergency Teleport to Summon another - or two - more, attack with the pilots (likely for damage), Summon 2 or 3 Dark Destroyers, destroy your opponent’s traps or other defences with their effects, and then attack face for 6-9000 damage. 
---
This was pretty easy to do, because *every* pilot monster could tag out for a ship. From the deck. You didn’t even have to draw them. And with cards like Kozmotown you had a second chance to draw pilots, and with Emergency Teleport and Reasoning you could just pull *them* from the deck too. It was really, really consistent.
---
And this combo was powerful *back in 2015.* The game has had *4 years* of powercreep since then. Kozmo has fallen behind the curve.
---
I also though that was really out of place too.
---
But if you are getting this downvoted it probably means many people here do think the same... :/

What I want to know is why isn't their any non GM Hearthstone streamers just streaming whenever GM is on?
---
Seems like such a free market, whenever GM is on its like 90% of the viewers are on the PlayHearthstone stream and the rest are complete randoms with tiny fanbases.
---
Not saying Reynad should do it as he clearly has other priorities, but imagine if Reynad streamed hearthstone the entire time GM was on, I think he would pull so many more viewers than normal.
---
I wouldn't say control and fatigue are the same, fatigue is an annoying to play against type of control, no?
---
Jade, pogo to some extent, fatigue reno decks etc. Were all complained about the same way warrior is now.
---
I think playing a 100% proactive deck against infinity answers is unfun, but my preferred decks are usually midrange combos with some late game potential so i am biased.
---
Anyway my point is that you can want a slower meta while acknowledging it can get TOO slow.
---
Its not black and white. Imo.
---
Quest rogue pirate warrior jade druid freeze mage say hi...
---
While I do enjoy MTGA much more these days than HS, it has plenty of its own issues. Playing non-games where you're relegated to being a spectator because your opponent counters every card and removes cards from your hand is common and the exact opposite of fun. The game also has no single player content and its version of tavern brawls are awful. Lastly, the sub is often trash as it's constantly full of low effort MS Paint shitposts.
---
Yeah it's this new RTS based on Hearthstone
---
What is your deck list? I'd be really interested in playing
---
Probkem is not the board clear, a 2 card combo to clear board, others without board clears have similar ones, the problem is they keep the board clear until something can be done with it, and being a mech the problem grows every turn

I'm sorry. I didn't realise you were complaining because HS is a card game.

I haven't played in a few months - were any spells changed so that they can target planeswalkers?

OP, scroll that sucker down and "Clear All" or whatever.
---
I'm not offended.
---
I just don't care and most likely, the majority of other people won't as well. I'm not sure if you've noticed, but a common response to the dime-a-dozen "I'm quitting Hearthstone, and here's my thesis as to why" posts is, "Okay. We'll see you in a few days." Maybe, you'll be the one to actually stick to it.
---
After reading through most of your overly long post with an obnoxious use of bolding, it's not hard to say you want to play Magic. Granted, I'd give Team 5 the benifit of the doubt in that the class guidelines they've set for themselves aren't going to be absolute and are going to be broken pretty much every set by at least one card in the one-hundred-thirty-five.
---
However, I still play Hearthstone to play Hearthstone, not a watered down version of Magic.
---
When I play Magic, I play it to play Magic, not Hearthstone with extra steps.
---
Making one more similar to the other won't really help anything.
---
Okay, you were "fine" with the core design, meaning you disliked it. And you've found Hearthstone boring.
---
But it's the class identity stuff and, more specifically, how *you* interpreted it that broke the camel's back?
---
That's... still not actionable feedback, then. We haven't even seen the results of their greater "class identity" focus yet.
---
Nothing is as cancerous and uninteractive as Thought Erasure.
---
Yes he went there.
---
You're right that the synergies are forced but I'd argue that's not a bad thing by default. It makes the deck building aspect of the game practically non-existent but I think it increases the number of lines of play you can make at a given time. 
---
In MTG and Hearthstone you mostly just play what you draw into and what your mana allows. In Yugioh there's so much tutoring and pulling cards from basically every single one of your zones that I feel you have a lot more options and it can feel more rewarding when you figure out the right play. 
---
Also it's very satisfying when you manage to meet the right conditions to pull off one of your super powerful summons. Like [[Windshear Stormcaller.]] My favorite Yugioh archetype ever was [Vylons](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Vylon) which are basically these weird robot angels that are all about equip spells and my deck about getting out Vylon Omega and buffing him to hell.

#Stonks
---
people still post their packs outside the weekly pack thread
---
Man, the devs made a pretty specific and clear post about what they want the game to become.
---
Also, saying "your interpretation of" is such an cop out of a discussion, I can't even...
---
And of course it is actionable feedback: sorry if I am not spelling out for you, but what I think they should do is get out of that Class Identity obsession and just keep developing sets which makes the game more diverse
---
Woohoo! I just recently accomplished this myself.  Now we just have to do it with every single hero power and every deck for every hero every chapter
---
Is this OCG or imaginary YGOPRO format? Cos that didn't happen at all in tcg
---
Well, I guess I'm glad I got a little headstart. I was still getting my ass kicked in practice trying to unlock the other classes with Shaman (hadn't swapped out any of the cards though.) Ended up unlocking most classes using the hunter. Still have a few more to go though.
---
There is no meme that is used as inappropiately as "nobody:"
---
The stupidity here is from you. We're discussing the bomb placement order and you come along and say that it's not RNG.
---
You don't really have any self awareness at all do you?
---
Gruul is a safe disenchant, it never has and most probably never will be used in any competitive environment. 
---
Jarraxus used to be a good control card so it *might* be useful somehow someday, but chances are still really slim since the card has suffered from years of powerlevel and I really doubt we will see a slow enough meta where it would shine. Hell, even at 9 mana, I doubt it could even get combo potential at any point.
---
[removed]
---
Sure we complain about Boom, but it's not on the same level of hysterics that previous aggro metas incited in us.
---
I'll stick to it. Only going to leave it installed because I like the Adventures from time to time.
---
And again, the thing about the first comparison to MTG is that Hs is already too simple in its design, and yet the devs seem to push it even further. This is the issue at hand
---
Yeah, I've noticed the same too, but I thought this was kinda fitting
---
Rank 24 playing Big Priest..................................
---
No. Might still go 12 wins, but if you whiff your early draws against an aggro deck (aka hunter) you just lose.
---
I assumed someone didn't feel the need to point out that cards are drawn in a random order in a card game. Every sentence requires interpretation and in mine you were slightly less of a moron than you appear to be.
---
"My homebrew control(ish) deck can't win against the best control deck in the format, so I'm quitting."

What's wrong with posts like that? I think it brings a positive light to the community. Just scroll past them if you don't like them. There's nothing bad about sharing something and feeling proud of the hard work you put into that "something".
---
"I really wonder why people like you get offended by someone quitting the game you play" thats 100% an assumption, what you mean?
---
Very interesting read for some of the “only Hearthstone” ppl out there! 
---
I had played MTG in High school and Yu-Gi-Oh so when I discovered Hearthstone it was a bit of a shock adjusting to the level of un-interactivity in the game on your opponent’s turn. Shock as in “There’s no limits..” , and when there’s no limits, everything is possible. 
---
Aside from the games beautiful interface and elegant card design, the fact that I can essentially create amazing combos on my turn and my opponent cant do anything about it! Then it seems only fair that they would get to do the same on their turn. It’s sort of like a game of chess.
---
Anyway! Very thoughtful post, and again, interesting read for “only Hearthstone ppl” who may not know about these other online card games!

yogg 2.0 tho?
---
This needs to happen, they take away space from interesting posts that might be posted instead.
---
That's the secret nerf.
---
&gt; This was pretty easy to do, because every pilot monster could tag out for a ship. From the deck.
---
That's just plane wrong, all but 2 SHIPS can tag out for a smaller ship or pilot if destroyed but pilots can only tag out into larger ships or pilots from the HAND. There are two pilots who can get Ships from the deck. Tin Can searches 1 out of 3 randomly in the end-phase and Farm Girl gets one out of the deck after dealing damage (this is probably where your misinformation comes from)
---
I had an idea... Keep everything the same but add "can't attack" before the battlecry
---
Warrior or mage.
---
But really, the image sizes that I had didn't match.
---
Warlock imo is pretty good. They offer Rin very often so all you need is abit of mana cheat (emerald goggles, robs, spells are health) and their deck is gone. You just build the deck to be strong early and it’s an ez win.
---
Skill game, GG Blizzard.
---
Reno = Paladin hero card
---
Oh also in sewers rogue worked very well for me due to death rattle synergies and how insane recurring villain is in the sewer.  Also if you ever get bored anomalies really spice things up.
---
OMG thank you all so much for the support these past minutes, its not easy for us single dog fathers out there and this has helped me a lot with my depression and carpel tunnel syndrome! &lt;3 :)
---
I got it while it was current content using 0 dust cost decks *FLEX*
---
It took me 5 seconds to spot the difference
---
Like I said to the other guy I mostly just meant his alt hero powers
---
If I'm playing casual with a meta deck, it's because I'm new to the deck and trying to get experienced with it before going to ranked.
---
Eh, I'll take a flood redundant posts that are sincerely happy about the game over apathetic crap like this every time.
---
Also who cares if they are karma farming. It's not like all the reddit karma in all multiverse will actually get you anything. It's just a shallow way of gamifying posting on a message board.
---
All I see on /r/Artifact these days is people shitting on Artifact tbh.
---
There was a guy like a month ago that completed heroic with every character, deck and heropower.  
---
Props to you tho, I really should start doing the heroics.
---
I know I made an edit
---
I’ve quit playing hearthstone until I hear from this sub that control warrior is not played anymore.
---
Unless it's a dad of course. Given the thousands of karma that three-letter word generates, that's something this sub really likes to see.
---
Well I have 2 jobs and go to school. So nyah! &gt;:(
---
Kidding I'm sure the dude has a life too. This did take me ages though.
---
The game has fundamentally changed from the days of TGT in that sense and there's no longer the factor of card management since the introduction of functionally infinite value cards. Aggro decks can generate tokens or low cost minions for days, and control can afford to spam removal thanks to value minion generating cards.
---
I show you show and go?

As one who lived in minas gerais for a few years, I recommend the bread he talked about. It's so amazing! Sometimes you can find it in the frozen pizza section of places, called brazi bites.
---
Kibler is also in the MTG hall of fame. I think it's more fair to say he plays Hearthstone between Magic.
---
Still counts
---
Yea sure but if he gets out a ragnaros on turn 3 I'm still fucked and there's no way around it.
---
Tbh lots of press articles going this way.
---
I only got one legendary in my wild bundle. It was Rhonin.
---
Sadness

It will be an announcement of an announcement. Hype will be defeated.

Omega demoralizer

Neymar back to barca. 100m + Messi and coutinho for psg. You read it here guys
---
I cleared it first time and ever since it's like 95% failure
---
yeah I don't get the point of these. the best case scenario is you get randoms to give you brief praise, but since you're also a random you might as well just look up someone else's thread about your accomplishment and pretend they were congratulating you
---
I can't link the deck right now, but Stalladris Keeper is also pretty nice because of the 1 mana heal, because of him I'm also using Starfall over Swipe. That and I feel like you rarely see 1 mana minions, most seem to be 2+ health.
---
This is exactly why I love this mode. I am currently doing a whole completion on normal and then heroic and then with the extra buff stuff. It’s a lot of fun because I get to just go at my pace, the nice part is even if you close the game for x amount of time it usually still just connects you.

Man, I had forgot how bonkers YGO actually is.
---
Corrected. I had never heard of either.
---
You high right now buddy?
---
Not holding my breath, but I'd love to eventually see a dedicated Co-op mode, of the boss brawl variety(or whatever works).
---
This is a good meme
---
potion of madness :)
---
But I don't think it's worth it, because it only works against barnes summons.
---
Damn guess I got super lucky :(
---
Got a shudder deck list which counters big priest?
---
Short answer: no
---
Long answer: we're not going to make mega thread/flairs for everything, there would literally be nothing left on the sub. This subreddit isn't really going to be full of what everyone considers good/interesting, it's going to have stuff you dislike because it's the sub for the game, it's supposed to be inclusive.
---
If you don't like a post, just scroll down to the next one. There's always another post. I wouldn't recommend downvoting those posts, but I would say upvote posts you like and post things you want to talk about.

Juppy#2125 EU 80g quest trade :-)
---
this is still not fixed
---
I believe you just log in and you're just handed it
---
Thanks
---
So... what’s new exactly!
---
I haven't played it, but I think that it is probably the best strategy card game out there. The strategic tension in every card game comes from the interplay of projected power implied and actual power committed, and based on the rules, Doomtown Reloaded seems to facilitate that better than any other game.
---
I had no idea Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson plays hs, cool.

Hey jackass, how about not ruining OP's moment and shitting all over his accomplishment with "what he didn't do"?
---
For your information, [this guy already managed to beat all the bosses, with all decks, and with all hero powers.](heroic_dalaran_heist_completed_with_every_hero)
---
This was really useful. 
---
I've just returned after about a long time away, I think the last expansion I saw was the old gods.
---
Frowz#11497 on NA trading 80g quest
---
I can show, you go first
---
Man, oh, man, you are the reason I make posts like this. Your response was a truly delightful read. You have a very solid reasoning and some really healthy and great ideas for the game. If it goes in the direction you think it is, I will definitely return to Hearthstone!
---
If I could you would be the first in about two years of my reddit account that I would give those Gold or Platinum thingies. It is SO easy to just see my post and think I am blindly hating on the game, dismiss my points and just go with it, but you took your time (and mine haha) to counter my point of view, going in great detail about it, but without rambling or calling me names and such.
---
I truly hope you are right. And you are what I wanted Reddit to be: a place in which opossite opinions can clash and yet be explained and argumented to a satisfatory conclusion; not one where I validate my point of view or perspective, but one where I understand where the others are coming from. Thank you for that, honestly
---
Did you change the original?
---
Also in case you missed it, [this guy already managed to beat all the bosses, with all decks, and with all hero powers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/c1xntu/heroic_dalaran_heist_completed_with_every_hero/)
---
Oh, and I also think you have a great mind for developing/criticizing games. If you wanted to work with that, I think you should try it, it would ´probably be a success
---
It seems to not be a coincidence that the day these two are no longer freebies is also the day the next expansion is revealed. I wonder if future legendary giveaways will also coincide with the next expansion's announcement.
---
Im not sure if its cheaper, but it defintely feels better in Arena.
---
Only ever bought the 2 welcome bundles, been playing since Old Gods and I have about 4 decent wild decks for every class (obviously, not all of them are tier 1 or even tier 2).
---
Just a little correction there, **Confirm** means to establish the truth, so it cannot be 99%, most probably, most likely would fit better.
---
You’ve seen 48 posts that have an automatic sound the bells mouse bot?
---
Wow, it always amazes me how diffrently people take to those brawl
---
This was in my oppinion one of the worst if not the single worst brawl ever
---
Im actualy happy to see some people are enjoing it this much
---
Not entirely sure but I think there's roughly 172 give or take
---
Non Yu-Gi-Oh players always saying the same things. Pendulums and links are nothing like they are made out to be by people who don't play Yu-Gi-Oh.
---
I thinking more if that if they are still unbalanced after phasing out of Standard or being HoFed they may need to be looked at and tweaked till they are balance like many cards in this game have been.  I am not called for nerfs just preserving may kinds of deck builds and plays that are not viable with the presence of certain cards that slam the door on whole archetypes as soon as they are released since everything can be played in Wild but it seems that Wild is not considered in the card making process.
---
I'm playing aggro spell damage mage at rank 7 and doing quite well against anything that isn't hunter. No conjurer
---
100% agreed.  But if HoF doesn't balance them other steps need to be taken to balance them out.
---
Morlocs did most of the work since they have one of the best matchup spreads I mean warrior isn't great but you have a better chance and I've had no trouble against hunter with my murlocs
---
Free from that blasted tower ! ^(behold !)
---
The meta changes a lot every 1-3 months or so. Right now is surprisingly diverse. You probably played 2 years ago when original Ancient Gears came out and were basically an easy to get free to play deck, or a few months ago when new support came out as a low cost (~20$) structure deck. They released new structure decks, events, and packs so there are a ton of meta decks right now. A recent tournament had 11 unique deck types in top 16, and in top 8, 6 were  unique. 
---
The deck you will see most often on ladder is probably just whatever is decently consistent and easiest to make for f2p and budget players. (Not trying to get you back into it, just adding some context and perspective.)
---
Impressive! Thank God your not one of them LOL 
---
Good luck reaching legend pops &lt;3
---
So that's how I got Vargoth. I saw a fun wild deck for 15k dust (Deck of Wonders spam) and when I went to check I was surprised I only needed to craft 4 epics. Thought I lucked some great pulls and forgot. Super fun deck btw, like the good old days of Yogg.
---
Why is consistency a bad thing? (I play MTG and Yu-Gi-Oh) I want to be able to actually play a good deck that can do what it is meant to without limping and getting fucked by my opponents dumb luck.
---
Lmfao that's the best interpretation I've ever heard
---
Me too, on normal though~ 
---
Doesnt feel special after reading this. Congrats ;-)
---
How about you learn some manners ?   
---
I properly congratulated the man. And he didn't take offense at my suggestion as you can see by his answer above. Also I suggest taking basic courses in English for you obviously didn't understand my post.  
---
To clarify, this one - for instance - is a prime example of actually being a jackass. See the difference ? ;)
---
I play while working out! Or did you mean for beating them? For beating it's easy
---
See a robe of gaudiness, pick a robe. Its op

7/5/5 | Battlecry: Summon a Jade Golem. Give it Taunt.  
---
zOwO
---
Oh shit thank you
---
You don't just lose... at least not in my case. I played silence priest at rank 3 and had a decent win rate. Also if a Mage fills its board with giants you lose with most of the decks if you don't have direct answer for that.
---
it's true, there's plenty of posts, just look at more and stop being a whiny baby
---
My god if Hearthstone ever does an expansion as a jojo reference...
---
Watch it end up being like thousand needles or something.
---
Fang#12818 NA 80g trade, you go first
---
Too slow
---
They can still craft the card.
---
Still not enough.
---
There is no reason why a card with such a powerful late game ability should come with a 4 mana 4/5 body.
---
Hmm, ok. But it's only one more mana than Aya.
---
Oh, simmer down.
