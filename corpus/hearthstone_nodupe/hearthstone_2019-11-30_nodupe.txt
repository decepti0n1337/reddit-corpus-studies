I am completely lost on what game this is.
---
---
---
Of all the potential turn 1 triples, that feels especially weak.
---
how can an opponent ignore it unless you are a turn from being dead. From the translation, face damage also makes 6/6s which can defend you immediately when it gets to your turn, and put out good counter pressure.
---
Has blizzard said anything in the past about never reprinting. If love to see this reprinted in the set. I know that in an online card game reprints can be frustrating in many ways. But perhaps they could do it in such a way that it wouldn't be.
---
*And the curse goes on, and on, and on, at sea!*
---
Magic: the Gathering!
---
I have played a lot of Evolve Shaman in the past and the only thing that made it broken was the Desert Hares.  If they nerf the main hare to call 1 Mana hares instead of 3 Mana hares everything should be balanced again.
---
Is there a reddit like place without the low quality, zero thought out meme posts? Not only is this unoriginal, it doesn't even make sense. These cards are so different in purpose.
---
Trrrrrrremble bef-hore meh
---
hah wow im so glad i stopped playing years ago.
---
I'm pretty sure the spell is question is Arcane Blast
---
Due to the widely incompatible nature of some of the brawls; as well as over the top combos that reward the deck building excessively, this would create both massively unfun game swings and a constant flux in the meta. Although the last point seems nice, such a rate of flux is very expensive and will choke many players out of the highest ranks. A fun idea that should remain just that.
---

---
As an aside, any play animation for the inkeeper should simply be the crafting animation; whilst full heartedly screaming “[inkeeper shock noise], LEGENDARY” (or GOLDEN LEGENDARY if the inkeeper is as such).

&gt;  For an additional 800 dust (2400) a pretty decent budget deck can be built.
---
"a"
---
Meaning one.
---
Feels like we never got a real Uldum meta but just an event meta instead. A real shame for what I think is a good set that didn't get a fair time to shine before the next expansion.
---
I quit hearthstone 2 sets ago because of stuff like this. The entire set reveal has looked terrible and unfun. Free value just gets thrown into every card now and everything is overstatted. I understand it's hard to keep a game feeling fresh without power creep but this is just unfun disgusting and unrewarding gameplay for me. Wow I played 3 of my 4 cards in hand and now I still have 6 cards in my hand. You can't play aggro anymore, combo gets nerfed, control doesn't realistically exist because mid-range gets so much value anyways it's hard to stabilize. So the game is just a bunch of slightly more or less aggressive mid-range decks flinging value engines at each other until one player can't match it so they get drowned in the opponents card advantage. Sorry rant over. I'm just so upset how downhill this game has gone for me.
---
Gonna enjoy skipping this one, tbh.
---
Idiot. The downside is that you have to be *holding a dragon* for this to work. That can be incredibly difficult to do - sometimes even more difficult than making a highlander deck.
---
du du du du du du du du du du
---
&gt;most of us resigned to playing the game in largely the same way forever: Three expansions per year, pick your poison between ladder, Arena, and the single-player PvE stuff. 
---
if you consider ladder and arena "poison" why would you pick either? no one's making you play the game. and why no acknowledgement of tavern brawl which is a different game mode every week? doesn't fit your bullshit narrative?
---
lepper gnome
---
well I was going to play it against the innkeeper regardless for two reasons:
---
1. I can restart if I get a class I don't like
---
2. I can intentionally play slower knowing my opponent won't kill me or concede until I draw a card to see how it would interact.
---
fun deck
---
How exactly do you plan on comboing a shaman card with a mage card ?
---
Power creep is such a difficult thing to define in a card game as well, where there’s hundreds upon hundreds of cards, compared to a game like overwatch or r6, where power creep becomes much more of a factor
---
If they play this just use Zephyrs to get a silence effect.  That will show them!
---
You better bet I did
---
I don't think Reno Mage plays either of them.
---
Historically Solia is terrible because it's not worth playing a highlander deck just to cheat out "????".
---
Dragoncaster is much better since having a dragon in the hand isn't as restrictive of a requirement as having a highlander deck. But looking at wild, I don't see either being played.
---
Maybe in standard, people will use it to get out Puzzleboxes?
---
I don't know if this is a serious post
---
Could start seeing more miracle mage) similar to the one when medivh was in standard) lists with this card. The flexibility with this card is insane.
---
What wonderful formatting.
---
All card games from MtG to Poker have elements of both chance and skill, and saying one game is absolutely more skillful than the others is difficult to say the least.
---
&gt;the only luck part in mtg is draws which is reduced because you have 4 of each card and tournaments where they can put the matches in favor of a deck. 
---
Three in ten games of MtG are determined by either mana screw or flood. Magic is no better. It's just Hearthstone wears its random elements on its sleeve.
---
Cho... gall? Maybe Don han Cho?
---
It cant possibly be lorewalker cho, right? RIGHT?
---
Hireek, lend me your memes
---
Flamewalker is rotating with this set, so not as likely to happen thanks to the large card pool of wild.
---
i don't think dealing 6 damage to a dragon is enough to tip the scales when a bunch of them are 4/12
---
"Embrace the Power(creep) of the Kabal."
---
Lol loses to silence
---
You're saying I can't make a joke because people slightly related to the subject of the joke are getting murdered by people I have no control over. Of course I'm going to take offense at that.
---
How’d you steal the quest? Mage secrets?
---
&gt; thank Arceus history has a tendency of repeating itself. 
---
&gt;But are we predicting for future meta or past? There you have your answer, future. 
---
Make up your mind aye.
---
There really is no "underestimating" this card. The situation you just mentioned is a rather rare occurrence, and most other classes right now, besides a select few, have answers to Hirek, such as board wipes or silences. Hirek is an example of "5% of the time, it works 100% of the time."
---
I would make it cost 6 mana and in return be a rare card
---
Card games are inherently random. You put powerful things in your deck and hope to draw them at the right time in the right order. This is intentional - it prevents games from playing out the same way. Different games have different ways of injecting randomness into their play. Mtg has lands - the need to draw your mana introduces a lot of randomness and lets them print various interest effects that relate to temporarily generating or tutoring your mana out, Hearthstone has their random effects like "summon a random X" or "attack a random X"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In practice, yes, hearthstone's randomness is more aggressive than mtg, because for every source of randomness in mtg, there is a way to counteract it. However, that has never, and will never, mean that skill isn't important in hearthstone. Sometimes, you get good rng and you win a match you should have lost. Sometimes, you get bad rng and lose a match you should have won. On average, you have a winrate. This varies by skill level. People like hunterrace win a lot more than they lose. People who are just starting out, lose more than they win. 
---
You topdeck the "perfect card" when there are 15 left in your deck, because a 1/15 chance is not that unlikely. For the "uncountable" times that you drew the perfect times, there were likely 14x as many where you didn't draw that card. Or you ran 2 copies of it. Or there were 3 cards in your deck that were functionally equal.
---
BECAUSE TERRY CRUZ WAS IN CHARGE OF DESIGNING THIS SET
---
iT's NoT sN1P-LoCk ThOuGh! ;-)
---
Holding dragon effects haven't really been conditional in game. It's more about the deck building process for them, which keeps them from being played in other archetypes.
---
Lightning Breath isn't ever going to be played outside of a dedicated Dragon Shaman, so if that deck otherwise ends up being mediocre, it really isn't going to be that bad on the whole.
---
Hearthstone isn't exactly the game to go if you want a whole lot of counterplay either. Spellcasting and battlecries have never had any direct counterplay (at least outside of Mage for the former).
---
A lot of the time too, the best counterplay to a strategy is to not allow yourself to be in a situation where you're reacting to it. With Dragon decks looking so top-heavy in their curves, going under them with aggression will likely prove to be enough even when the dragon deck draws exceptionally well.
---
He must be joking
---
Rolling fives four times in a row on a d6 really isn't that uncommon when you're rolling it so often.
---
Why the fuck is this a card, wow
---
Yes, it didn't do anything on play and was a worse Deathwing afterwards. Compared to this which costs less and can be combo-ed. Also this is a stop for aggro to go face as it can flood your board with 6/6 easily. You can. Trigger with hero power any turn or let your enemy do so, even if Frozen or behind a taunt, the effect still summons dragons, while Tyrantrus didn't do shit ever. Not when played not after played. See the enormous difference?
---
Good bot.
---
Biggest lies of 2019
---
That'd Yu-Gi-Oh you're talking about, where a non effect or tuner card is worthless
---
This is hearthstone, 1/3 do nothing 1 Mana is good here.
---
Excellentplay bro
---
Casual? You mean the exact same amount of Quest Shaman as ranked but they BM more?
---
Mally#1909 trading, NA
---
Yes, it’s referencing how this card ruins an opponent’s Highlander deck by putting two of the same card in their deck.
---
A Highlander Deck is a deck that has no duplicates, and benefits from it with various battlecries (“if your deck as no duplicates, then ...”). A deck without duplicates is called a “Highlander Deck” because of the infamous quote from the movie “Highlander”, and that is “There can be only one”.
---
i thought this too
---
&gt;I’m tired of playing the same boring combo. 
---
So don’t? There is, as you said, also Resurrect Priest. Or if that doesn’t tickle your fancy, you could try Zetalots Highlander Priest. 
---
It is centered around the Quest, bouncing back Zephrys (or other battlecry minions if you must) to the hand, and utilizing Leeroy Jenkins + Hero Power + Vivid Nightmare in order to have a 19 damage burst finisher. I’ve personally used it, and can attest that it’s both fun &amp; effective. Reached Legend quite easily last month with it.
---
Or, you know, have a little gumption and try making decks of your own haha. I feel like people forget you can do that. There are three or four different general variations of “Zoo Priest” you can create, for example. Although they’re all a bit neutered if you don’t have a copy of *Zerek, Master Cloner*. I’ve had less success trying that, but it’s still very much a Rank 5 viable archetype.
---
Ever heaard of fibonacci the hs player?
---
You need more ram bro
---
bro 😎💪
---
But that might be too much. How about we balance it by removing the battlecry and adding overload 2?
---
Hhahahahaha fynny never before posted
---
Easy. Bandersnooch becomes a copy of it. 5 Mana fill your board with 5/5s
---
Could work in quest Shaman. Mostly waste four, possibly 8 of your opponents draws too even if you aren't facing a highlander. Great against spell Hunter if that ever becomes a thing again.
---
[removed]
---
Its been played in every aggro/token druid deck thats ever existed, it is in no way a bad card. Bad players? sure
---
why the Peter Griffin thing? 
---
But otherwise, thanks so much! Very helpful :)
---
Congratulations.  You deserve every one of them
---
you get more variety, it is worse in the sense that it's harder to know all your decks but it is more fun as you can play with many different cards (and it rotates after every expansion)
---
Please delete, this may end in the wrong hands
---
Wow, pirate warrior hasn't gotten any support in so long! Hope to see it turn out good!
---
I am not a G'noblin I am not a G'nelf
---
A 5 mana 5/5 warlock rare dragon 
---
Battlecry: if you are holding a dragon deal 3 dmd to all other characters
---
I've played hearthstone since closed beta, mained warrior from gvg on and have played exclusively (as in I disenchant most cards that aren't warrior relevant) warrior since knights of the frozen throne. 
---
I could go on and on about the highs and lows but I'll keep it short and sweet
---
The single best time to be a warrior was the last 3 weeks or witchwood when azalina was changed so you could finally beat shudderwock by gaining a thousand armor. Shud was the best deck at the time (the otk variant) and warrior simply couldn't beat it but the change made it so we could never lose to shud. Still have screenshots with upwards of 800 armor. 
---
Honorable mention goes to patron. It was so tough and rewarding to play
---
The worst was... All of the year of the Mammoth. It was very sad to play only warrior at times.
---
You only gain empty mana crystals, so u don’t get a complete mana refresh
---
I'm going to say this is real for sure, fits warlock's theme quite well, and with all the dragons rolling out, makes sense.
---
Correct again.
---
i mean you're defending that person and didn't even address that part of their argument. that's what i'm replying to. 
---
my bad then, i'll retract all my intersex statements if it bothered you that much. (though their [updated literature](https://interactadvocates.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LavLaw-Trans-and-Intersex-Fact-Sheet.pdf) outlines that the forms of discrimination do overlap at times, as i stated) regardless, that individual has a sad misunderstanding of the percentages of gnc individuals, who would be understandably tired of that joke.
---
Ohh, that makes more sense honestly.
---
hunter legendary 9 mana 8/8  dragon. If you have no duplicates, add 2 random dragons to you hand. They cost 0.
---
Thats me when I dropped in Isle of Conquest and horde was defending base.
---
I mean you can track that manually too if you're paying close attention
---
I'm going to say it's real. Seems balanced enough, and hunter has gotten no duplicates support in the past, and seems flavorful enough.
---
I used to care about having all the heroes but  when they started adding them to the highest tier preorder, I stopped caring.
---
Imagine this just cycling through Cho and Milhouse...
---
Wait, I don't have to, its gonna happen to me day 1.
---
Fake
---
A 6 mana 7/6 hunter legendary dragon 
---
Battlecry: change the health of all enemy minions to 1.
---
Pretty close. The card is real except...it's neutral.
---
Warlock legendary: sprint with a 4/4 that also increases your max hand size by 2
---
&gt;Seems interesting, and summoning all dragons in this kind of expansion seems flavorful
---
Yeah, i was expecting something like that, unfortunately they didn't implemented with those exact words. The real card is kind of similar  though since it &gt;!adds two random dragons to your hand if you have no duplicates in your deck. Dragons added costs 0 mana!&lt;
---
This is such a reassuring interview for BG mains.
---
You can tell the devs are super excited about this game mode and it’s definitely their passion now.
---
Costs 8 mana
---
8 mana druid legendary dragon 7/9, effect reads: if you have any unspent mana crystals at the end of your turn, summon a random dragon
---
Wrong
---
Insequent#11115 NA. 80g trade. I'll show, you go first.
---
Last expansion, it was turn one, play a one drop. Power creep indeed.
---
Now we need a new name maybe something along the lines of fire. I mean we are talking shaman here so"flamewreath" ?
---
Screenshotted with your name, I expect you will come through
---
Works great on my iPhone XR
---
why am I reading this as if you were screaming through a sandstorm?
---
I can see this being real. So I'm going to go with that it's real.
---
Yeah
---
Dang, rip
---
You've changed my view on these minions forever.
---
Blizzard realising they made the set to strong so having to counter it all now.
---
Sometimes you roll a one on a d6.
---
Absolutely. But the board being empty while you can play this means you have initiative at the end of the mid-game, so in most cases that means you are winning. So I think we agree on your point about its power in that situation.
---
My point was just that “super taunt” isn’t the best way to label the tokens since they don’t not protect you from losing when you are in a bad situation.
---
I'm going to say it's fake.
---
Haha it’s fake, but if such a card really exists it could be really powerful
---
Looks like u/Whizbang_HS was feeling generous :)
---
M
---
Came here for this card, did not disappoint
---
And since Cast When Drawn effects draw cards as well, this guy ends up drawing two real cards as well, actually insane.
---
u/Whizbang_HS is the culprit I believe
---
That's what nerfs halfway through the expansion have been traditionally used for, and those have generally done the trick. Blizzard probably believed that adding a bunch of powerful cards to Standard would be a more interesting way of achieving the same goal. But it seems they miscalculated how fast the meta would stagnate and didn't realize until it was too late.
---
u/Whizbang_HS is going ham, I got gifted too
---
Pick your poison is just shorthand for choose which you prefer.
---
Let me put it like this. You’re in a big fight. I make a rule and say no explosives and no machine guns. Yes that increases the success of a person with a bow and arrow by a bit. But the guy with the assault rifle and the guy with the pistol will probably be very happy about this rule.
---
Blizzard should bring her back or print card similar to this.
---
Lol I thought it was another Hong Kong hidden message or smth
---
Yeeeep.  Sort of, it's actually a rare though!  I'm actually really stoked for this one
---
Doesn't it reward the opposite?
---
The chance of giving your opponent a good 1 drop or your opponent playing something like miracle rogue or cyclone mage is pretty small, though.
---
Sure but then you’re dependent on 2 cards in the game, and you still need to trade to get your value and it only lasts for one turn.
---
I've never seen it up big and up close, so he always kindalooked like singed
---
Free legendary of your choice. Tbh i wouldn't feel bad pulling it.
---
krle92#2766 EU 80g trade
---
They were usually run in the same deck when they were in Standard together.
---
Reminds me of the conclusion of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBzMV98ACXY) by u/grosghiles
---
Thats not that good, way too balanced
---
Wait for the expansion. DoD is shaping up to be a crazy powerful expansion, and you're gonna need as many of the cards from there as you can get.
---
FBI: dont move
---
Another shuffle Rogue support, the Wax-Dragon Shuffle deck looks very promising. If I open the Dragon I ‘ll try it out and see how it goes (hopefully though we won’t see the card that other Rogue card in the meta so that the Dragons can proliferate freely)
---
you're thinking of the hunter card
---
They printed a counter to the goose, only for rogue.
---
one last set to figure out what she's capable of.
---
And you are facing a warrior with 30 hp and 30 armor
---
Yes, even recently it was run in [Tempo Rogue] (https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/decks/tempo-rogue-standard-meta-snapshot-july-23-2019) during Rise of Shadows and in [Aggro Rogue] (https://www.vicioussyndicate.com/decks/standard-aggro-rogue/) in Uldum (before they brought back the wild cards). It also had a bit of play in the early days of Bomb Warrior and in some Uldum aggro warrior lists.
---
Ok troomer.
---
Good for shaman quest
---
Prince Malchezaar for meme value?
---
Turn 4 Zephrys + Lap Recruiter, turn 5 this. Actually this card is a pretty good way to get duplicates off lap recruiter in a highlander deck.
---
Damn cool idea though. I feel like releasing a few bi-tribal minions, maybe less vanilla than what you made to promote using them, could cause some interesting decks to spawn.
---
Making a joke is no where even in the same universe as ordering the extermination of an entire race. 
---
Also you just godwin'd so you lose by default.
---
It's real! As I'm sure you've noticed, blizzard isn't exactly sticking with precedents in this set.
---
Bob got so tired of the people he roots for losing so he decided to root for himself
---
10/10/10 dragon
---
Stats are ok, Battlecry is probably kinda useful, just your generic 3 star dragon which could be played here and there, nothing special IMO
---
&gt;MD: Yeah, we are adjusting the Poison animation in, I think, January.
---
ffs, why is it so hard to tweak this
---
Dudu! Golden common!
---
In theory, you're stuck in a one-star bar for three rounds in exchange for a small profit.
---
Seems too complicated to be printed, I'm going to assume that this is fake.
---
I like it! Fits the theme, I want this to be a real card!
---
DOZENS!
---
Tri-class cards should really make a come-back, I feel like it could have some cards in it which are cool in a few classes but would be Op in others, so you can separate the OP from the strong and still have a card which isn’t specific to one class only. It had some missed potential I feel like
---
Zephrys is the stupidiest and the laziest card in the history of this game, might be worth removing from the game entirely.
---
As much as I would love another ragnaros, I'm going to say this is fake.
---
wrong actually! If all cards are powerful, the insanely unfun overpowered cards are powerful.
---
But he keeps on forgetting
---
Never, this would swing games too much.
---
I could see this in Kobolds and Catacombs, but it doesn't fit the theme, so I'm going to say fake.
---
Yes, sadly. I’d love if this card was real tbh
---
Real, dragon priest, aoe self healing, fits it perfecftly.
---
Darn lol
---
Iirc it's a 1/3 tho
---
Normal, casual card: Type: Dragon  Stats: 1/1/1 "whenever you summon a Dragon gain +1/+1"
---
It's real.
---
It's called Waxadred
---
Or Darkness Candles 😎
---
3k wins... Pathetic
---
My key is also upside down
---
Dont u have 4/4 mana, which is expected?
---
One for all and all for me
---
Rogue Epic 4 mana 4/4
---
Battlecry: If you're holding a Dragon, steal a card from your opponents hand.
---
Damn snowflake millennials /s
---
I don't believe this card is real.
---
why are you upvoted and him downvoted, your litterally saying the same thing.
---
Amazing for a control deck
---
Wow. Bonkers of a card
---
Quick, assign a flair before this gets removed
---
Bob, looking in a mirror, whispers: well... If it isn't my favourite commander.
---
Oger
---
No that's just confirmation bias
---
Customheartstone is only for unbalanced cards
---
Or  old arena runs
---
You're not a real HS player.
---
I forgot it
---
Miracle Rogue and Oil Rogue, I don't like Tempo Rogue at all but that's all you can play since they nerfed prep por no reason.
---
Bitch you ain't even got 1 joke
---
A such gamemode need some sort of balancing limitation, magic(atleast when i played it 4-8 edition) have the mana color issue when you try to buil a 5 color deck: you can put on your deck the best of each color(class) but you could have no matching mana color problems, and your ide!a need to have this sort of issue to balance things
---
Congrats have a pack
---
Priest was best at healing, now it is in fourth place in that department be hind paladin(1) shaman (2) warlock (3 with the identity of better life steal cards). Priest can not restore its own health like these classes.
---
&gt; There is always a post about Whizbang post a week
---
FTFY
---
5 mana 7/5 Rogue Legendary Dragon with a deathrattle that basically says
---
Shuffle a card into your deck which has "Casts when drawn, Summon this minion"
---
For the rest of the game : you murlocs also are dragons
---
I play the fake hearthstone, but I am a firm believer in whizbang for my quests.
---
I thought this was fake, but someone else commented it :D
---
How can it fuck it even more!?
---
You're correct.
---
honestly with how many comments there are,I dont doubt you've seen the whole expansion by now.  
---
Here's 3 for you:  
---
6 mana mage rare **Battlecry**:If you're holding a Dragon,your next spell this turn costs (0)(Tribeless)  
---
3 mana 2/5 mage legendary If you cast three spells in a turn,summon a 5/5 elemental  
---
and finally, 5/5/4 hunter epic:**Rush** **Deathrattle:**Add a 8 mana 8/8 with **Rush** to your hand
---
Real, real, fake?
---
yup.Yeah you definetly saw the whole expansion
---
At this point yeah lmaoo
---
30x Nozdormu
---
Once upon a time people played games because they were fun. 
---
There were no save functions, rewards for playing, win tracking, or achievements but the games were still played because the reward of playing a game was enough. (Some people were jealous that others could even play games)
---
Congrats!
---
Underrated
---
mini?? It's not mini though. The event takes half the latest expansion lifespan and was completely meta-defining.
---
Those Lucentbarks tho
---
I dont see anything wrong here?
---
Ahh sounds like it's a good thing that I'm trash and stay around rank 20!
---
It was the best strategy to get past his 3rd phase.
---
When you are outside the top four, there’s a higher chance of facing someone in it than out of it.
---
Class card doesn't really excuse +1/+3 and a better effect. But this is consistent with other cards from this set (which is an obvious cash grab, as you will be simply unable to compete without these cards).
---
Don’t forget faceless manipulator to copy it
---
Nano is another guy, he always shows his profile when he gilds. Also the awards are not coming from u/whizbang_hs 's account so unless theres any other evidence it's not him either. I'm pretty sure ik who it is but I'm confirming atm
---
Yes, it’s been posted here a million times, it’s just placeholder art and rank when you disconnect from the server.
---
This basically describes the entirety of the new set. Honestly, it should have just been this one card....lmfao
---
Wait wait wait....there's one serious flaw with this card though!
---
It's legendary - it should be Epic so that you can play 2 of it. xD
---
*taps forehead
---
Thank you
---
So after he nuked Japan he started nuking Azeroth?
---
Battlegrounds is chill and fun but games take a while. In a few weeks meta is gonna change again and the game will power creep itself so come back then to see what u think of the new meta
---
And here I am waiting for just a tournament mode
---
Mass dispel. Reno priest handles them pretty fine for the most part, due to mass dispel, and psychic scream only giving the base minions back to the deck.
---
Between those two, shadow visions to find them, and plague of death for the later zilliax combo... yep, reno priest is usually fine.
---
And I came to a ghost
---
Must be due to big gap in MMR between you and other players. Assuming matchmaking put you in a game with players of around 5.6k MMR(your friend's MMR)
---
Op is bad at battlegrounds
---
Ok, so you’re also saying that Wild should be broken AF, which is a totally separate discussion. I don’t prefer to dive down the rabbit hole of obviously broken stuff. Either way, I guess it works out for you since Blizzard is feeding your need to play broken shit. 
---
I won’t play yugioh - thanks for the heads up.
---
Except maybe even shaman
---
Now we need to Bandersmoshes so we can get one Octosari and one Valdris Felgorge. That's 12 card draws that all fit neatly in your new large hand.
---
Wild is wild, is that offensive to you?

---
Why would i buy cards i dont use or should use? Makes no sense...
---
The old trap room was bullshit but the ToT one really isn't that bad.
---
Even so, the sarcasm is so misplaced and so unfunny that it won't matter.
---
I knew about Hir’eek shenanigans, but Al’Akir seems almost as insane of a highroll with Shaman’s attack buffs.
---
Whizbang is the only reason I’ve played sone hearthstone in the last year. If it’s gone I’m gone. I’d like to keep playing a random game here and here. But I don’t have the time anymore to grind the gold/dust to make a good deck.
---
4 Mana 3/2 At the end of your turn, draw a Dragon from your deck
---
Those ranked wins are the total progress towards the alternate heroes...
---
I would imagine so based on how bloods and bombs interact with cards like farsight and wand (they steal the discount before detonating and drawing you another card).
---
Ummmmmmm, you're the big dumb. Demons struggle but getting this triple immediately is the big nuts
---
We say Australia, because that’s how you say Australia. Who knew!
---
This is beyond awful. How is blood mage thalnos better than Betrug ? How is Gruul S tier ? It's a 5 Mana 6/6 for your opponent, basically nothing
---
We're you high when you made this?
---
Death stalker rexxar's battlecry is also really uninteresting. I really like the evolve one OP made. All the hero powers don't make sense at all tho. The battlecry one is targeted, and the hero power can't be targeted since it triggers when you invoke. All the other ones are stupidly OP
---
But think about it, if you ignore all the bad parts, everything is a highroll
---
dude... Harrison Jones is from classic
---
Yeah, a full hand refill is pretty weak. Who needs cards anyway?
---
What is average then? 4500?
---
Oh you're approaching me?
---
Just looking at this list pisses me off
---
You don’t play this on 2 though, you play it on your power turns, which are 3-5. You need 6 for it to be consistent *enough*. With 9 it would always be active, but Cyclone mage can’t afford that.
---
The no dupe stuff is probably a bit optimistic (and you didn't even include the best one, Reno) as you're looking to be able play this relatively early. If you wait for a long time, you're gonna hit something good regardless.
---
I'd like to open Millhouse any number of times. Granted i'd never dust him, but still.
---
Imagine hating a person for playing the best deck in a card game
---
It would be nice to have a 1 mana 1/1 card that reads: If you overdraw a card, shuffle it back in your deck and burn this card instead.
---
Gruul is cool at first place. Everything else is sort of irrelevant
---
Priest was cool in classic with all the shadow cards with shadowform, mind blast etc. They’ve gotten no more since then :(
---
Don't use a normale template, you should use a different classification, something like "always good", "situationally good" (like Black Knight, all highlanders, Harrison etc), "soft taunts" (passive effects that forces your opponent to remove like Luna or Arugal) and "plain bad".
---
Also you need do rethink some of them, Hogger is not a bottom tier pick, Alaki is not better than Darius, Boomaster Flark is way higher in a class that has Vessina and Bloodlust, Electra doesn't deserve Tier F while Malygos is A and so on.
---
and then they don't nerf mechwarper...top 10 anime betrayals
---
We don't know, but the number should constantly be rising. Leaderboard is about +50 a day.
---
&gt; If you fully skipped combat in such an instance you would gain 60-100 seconds. 
---
 
---
Why the fuck would you fully skip a combat? The reason you are playing this game is to whatch the minions battle each other. Just don't play it if that doesn't interest you 
---
&gt;Except that's not what would happen... you would skip combat and the game would end... just like it would end if you had WATCHED COMBAT. 
---
you never know what is going to happen, the game is really unpredictable and may die while believing there is no chance for that to happen 
---
&gt;Because lengthy animations leave you with less time for your tavern turns. 
---
i believe the solution to that is to make the animations faster. like, we don't need to see the pack leader buffing every individual minion, it could all be instant. same thing with mama bear also the minions that summon other minions (rat pack) could do that instantly
---
That’s the one that gives your hand echo right? Since the cards in your hand have no cost to play, this just means infinite of whatever card you want+infinite coins selling them
---
Tfw in a month every thread is complaining about how your opponent Evocationed Chenvaala on 1 into Apprentice, 6 spells, Evoked Cyclone and then 3 more spells for 22/24 in stats.
---
Holy shit man... just holy shit. You are unreal. 80 IQ, for real. How many concussions have you had in your life?
---
No that's Glinda. Umbra triggers the deathrattle when a deathrattle minion is played, which would be pretty bonkers op.
---
Hunter card: 4 mana 7/7, battlecry: take 1 damage for each card in your hand.
---
?
---
Never played that game in my life but I’m thoroughly bothered that they use every. single. Icon. For classes that world of Warcraft uses.
---
3 mana Shaman spell, deal 4 damage, if you're holding a dragon, this hits adjacent minions as well.
---
Also, amazing post, this is a ton of fun!
---
1. Buy all three in a turn
---
2. Buy 1 or 2 and play them immediately. (1/1) yes. Then get the third one.
---
Is this what this sub has come to?
---
Who do you think you are? tryna say something logical and true in the hearthstone reddit? You think these people are capable of understanding logic?
---
My first truly competitive deck was midrange hunter, got up to rank 4 with it. Happy to say that it's still a thing, even if it's not a super high tier deck rn.
---
However, I used to love token druid, and got up to 12 with it, but when big druid became a thing I stopped being able to play the class as I was too f2p for all of those cards.
---
The problem is that, that i don't see how to make  a format  about multiclassing that balances arround biclass but allows more than two with some drawbacks, because all classes will be some sort of polarized thing arround a warrior 29 removes and boom, a deck with infinite flooders sorcers aprentice and evolve, and the flvour of the month breaking early turn combo
---
How long can this go on?
---
R5 to legend in the last 4.5 hours? Hate yourself much?
---
Expansion, not so much.

At 5 Mana is zephyrs not good?

I dont understand
---
Staple? Really? Is she showing up in all those sniplock decks then?
---
Healbots main strength was that it was neutral.
---
So rogue and Warlock and mage to lesser extent then those 2 later on could use it,others dint use to much if at all really.
---
&gt; staple
---
It’s a one-of in Renolock, a relatively unpopular deck nowadays, to be used in Control matchups where you know you’re going to fatigue. Gnomeferatu is for all intents and purposes just a River Crocolisk in every other matchup.
---
And no, it isn’t anti combo tech. It’s not anywhere near reliable enough for that. It’s usually actively bad because it’s way more likely to just bring your opponent closer to their win condition than it is to hit it. The only time you could have argued that was when Kingsbane was still destroying Control decks. But that deck is dead now and you were never just blindly dropping it hoping to get lucky anyways. 
---
Gnomeferatu is a decent card, but there are a lot of people who seem to seriously misunderstand what actually makes it one.
---
Hireek is actually amazing
---
Your politeness is heartwarming.  I hope our mysterious benefactor will gild your post.  &lt;3
---
This was an emotional ride.
---
Because some of the opponents played a combo deck.

Legendary priest dragon, 6 mana, 7/5, battlecry: discover a dragon from the past. If your deck has no duplicates, add all three into your hand

6/4/8 dragon for druid with taunt and battlecry: discover a dragon.

Girlfriend said the same thing not enough time I bet her I could do it and she could pick the type of deck I run kind of I will put a bunch of rules on it it basically ended up turning out you got the pics of the creature type guess what she picks you pick dragons..LOL instead of making the Smart Choice and Warrior I picture it druid
---
They should award a golden classic pack every time you get a class to lvl 60, 500 wins, or 1k wins, and an extra two once you’ve done it with all of them. Also, they should give a golden classic pack the first time you get 12 wins in Arena and when you complete the One of Everything achievement.
---

Bottom text

After 500 wins on ladder
---
This is very different:
---
1. Bomb warrior takes Almost always more than one turn to put 2 bombs in ur deck
---
2. Bombs are not playable cards so you continue to cycle when you draw them, 
---
3. Bomb warrior is just one class that has weaknesses against many other counter decks so it’s not always the best choice for the meta
---
This new card basically is a hard punish for highlander decks, that’s unquestionable. Its existence will almost certainly guarantee that highlander decks never become Tier 1 decks in ranked.
---
Wow, that’s amazing. Let’s concede every game!
---
It's a joke don't worry (Dragon Quest and Finsl Fantasy are both JRPG series)
---
Mate this was posted yesterday or the day before. Same name, same text, same art, same stats.
---
it must be his first day on the internet...
---
They're probably planning on bundling it with the next patch.
---
I play exclusively Priest and I'm bothered by how common the deck archetype is in Wild. I got tired of playing the archetype even though it won often. And once I got to a ranking I was satisfied would give me a challenge, I experimented with the less popular, but fun cards in the class. But Priest and Shaman decks force you to have the very same cards in order to counter their decks. I'd like Wild to be filled with experimental decks and wild--pun not intended--strategies.
---
yeah i know the meme. eh. whatever.
---
mech hunter is the only deck that i would be sorry for,mech pala has no business being a thing too
---
You don't have to print overpowered stuff to change the meta. One good way is to nerf currently oppressive cards and provide new archetypes to replace them. Or print counters to currently oppressive decks.
---
Because the deck that runs it wants to go to fatigue. Which is the only instance where burning cards matters.
---
If you don't plan to go to fatigue, then burning your win condition doesn't matter. It's the equivalent of it being at the bottom of your deck.
---
Although it does give knowledge to your opponent when it is burned.

2/-/- | Each player draws 2 cards.  
---
It's not pity, it's empathy.
---
Are you really surprised that most people don't give away wins at a competitive game? Has nothing to do with the internet. A chess player wouldn't just give up because why would he?
---
There is no point
---
Good
---
Nope, Windows
---
Seriously? You feel bad because you won a game of hs you maybe didn't deserve?
---
No I never emote, too busy thinking about what to play
---
Crikey!
---
Haha he was a shaman actually and stole my Frothing on turn 4 as well as playing a Mogu, but he must’ve not had any evolve cards.
---
I love running double Research Projects in combo mage.  Getting trashed by hunters and zoolocks is worth it for the games where I burn a Rogue’s N’Zoth
---
That's true. For a Highlander deck the deck slots are pretty competitive. For my dragons of decent theorycraft I had to take out all of the secrets and burn spells (fireball, pyro, ice barrier, flame ward) in order to add the dragons.
---
I also think your hot
---
Mmmm
---
Yeah, it does something different than the card this thread is about so saying octasari is bad off of sneed's doesnt mean octasari is bad.
---
I always figured it was people who deleted their animations, ala Snip-Snap.
---
Feels good!
---
Nope, bamboozled again :P
---
uh what, this is a shaman dragon card.......
---
Lemme guess, SNIP-Lock player who thought they were being smart and skipping animation times.
---
Salty as a mug.
---
Helpless baby dragon- 1 mana 1/1 dragon. Battlecry: Draw 2 dragons from your deck.

Bonus points if opponent survives but your shudderwock then makes 6 copies of its self

Way too strong, def fake
---
I want to be just like Medivh!
---
Ye
---
What does it means with Snip Lock and Animation skipping?
---
Highroll doesn't mean insane or game-winning though. It means getting the highest quality outcome out of a number of outcomes.
---
I would greet back but you need to be quick since I usually squelch after 15 seconds or so.
---
I often do this but in casual.  For me what makes this a true act of kindness is seeing it done in arena lol
---
Makes sense. I know that now my post will look like me showing off that I understood all battlegrounds first time I've tried them (I'll just delete the post) I just thought it is very intuitive. I've got most things right first time I've tried it ( a few games) I sure watched some pros do it afterwards and they were doing exact same thing I did. I'm not saying I'm some strategic genius, I suck at arena and overall at hearthstone but I thought that battleground were very obvious if even as bad player as me found them easy. I'm not saying you're worse than me at hearthstone, Im just saying that I find battlegrounds easy
---
By 100 package to get quicker animations!
---
99% of the times when someone greets you when they have lethal is to add a little salt to the wound(then they kill you), of course most people won't see as 'common courtesy' to greet back.
---
If it was a good fair match, it's worth greeting before losing. The rest depends if you are in a good or bad mood.
---
And then you get Mal'Ganis.
---
Buff cards didn’t come my way very often this run.
---
&gt;  You don't play this in super slow Shaman decks
---
normal quest shaman or anything that runs hagatha usually ends up with a pretty full hand.
---
&gt; "ANIMATIONS: OFF" option
