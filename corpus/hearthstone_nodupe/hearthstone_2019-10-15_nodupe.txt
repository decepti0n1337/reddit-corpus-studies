You’re acting a fool here, man.
---
---
---
I truly don't mean this snarky: do you think people should get to say whatever they want on a Blizzard-hosted stream?  Is it really that inconceivable that they don't want their business stream to be used as a political soapbox?
---
Any average person with a retirement portfolio likely has money in the stock market, my dude.
---
Spineless....so spineless.
---
Someone spending their money on shiny new cards doesnt make them a puppet. Blanket statements are made by idiots.
---
Weird amount of people suddenly declaring this dead and gone. Feels orchestrated. I wouldnt be surprised if blizzard hired a firm that is spamming threads like this with comments.
---
Seems I hit a nerve, that only really happens when deep down you know it's true.
---
You sound like a very inteligent person. This statement does indeed make you seem like a brave and noble person for quitting games for a "good cause"
---
Nah you’ll have to use the cards that was given to you,not cards opened from packs or crafted.(U can’t use golden cards)
---
&gt;I'm not sure why people think that standing up for HUMAN RIGHTS is political.
---

---
It is literally in the definition of politics, my dude.
---
&gt;
---
Hey man, I just did a good chunk of a Jurisprudence essay on the situation in HK. I really do appreciate the effort in your post and I'm actually a little hesitant to reply due to having drastically different views from you and not wanting to let my emotions bring down a high effort post. 
---
If you would like to see why a lot of us have an incredibly hard time crediting any pro PRC stance feel free to have a look at some of the sources below: 
---
&gt;Human Rights Watch, “China - Events of 2018” (Human Rights Watch, 2018)
---
&gt;Amnesty International, “The State of the World’s Human Rights: China 2018/2019” (Amnesty International, 2019)
---
I do have a bunch more but those are extremely detailed and high-quality reports. Another source I would like to include due to the good analysis contained within is: 
---
&gt;U.S Embassy &amp; Consulates in China, “China 2018 Human Right Report”, (2018, United States Department of State)
---
Of course, I understand that due to the publishing source you may have your own doubts on that last one. Just to calarify I am an Australian and pretty anti-American right now as I have family who fought with the Kurds in Syria, Im no uncle sam fan.  
---
If you would like to understand why this has provoked such an intense reaction from westerners it may help to be aware of a western idea called "the tolerance paradox", which on a basic level suggests that: 
---
&gt; The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Karl Popper described it as the seemingly paradoxical idea that, "In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance."
---
Many people see this as the beginning of China starting to flex its muscle on the world stage through media influence which is one of the recognised signs that a dictatorship is worsening (Source: Sohail Khalid, “Prophets of Violence - Prophets of Peace” (White Knight Publishing, 2005))
---
Here is a quick thing I personally find removes any defence you might be able to make of this being a debate where both sides shopuld be assumed to be acting in good faith. How can we trust the PRC to engage in any kind of compromise when they promote things like this" 
---
&gt;With particular concern being directed at the establishment of the National Supervisory Commission within the People’s Republic of China in 2018, an office “which is empowered to detain incommunicado anyone exercising public authority for up to six months without fair trial procedures in a system called ‘liuzhi’”.
---
A small annoyance. Dunno why he didn't see the two Deathrattles/Taunts and think "Mass Dispel"...
---
are you retarded
---
You'll need petition the Chinese government for this.  Only then will blizzard possibly consider making the game more enjoyable for us players.
---
Thanks for the correction. He was comprehensive on the subject here so I assumed it was the first.
---
As much as I was happy to see N'Zoth back initially, I'm already bored with every deck jamming the card in, with rogue being particularly annoying to play against.
---
It's not that I find it difficult to beat (paladin otk farms these deck types) they're just such an arduous grind all the time.
---
I feel like the game has taken a turn for the worst with do many decks having ridiculous amounts of value.
---
If you'd cite any sources on how videogames can't cause gambling addiction, I'd be willing to take you at least a little bit more seriously, but here, I'll give you a quick introduction on the subject if you actually care, rather than judge others for their concern.

I didn't say they gave the guy a gas mask.  Can you try reading?
---
They gave PERMISSION.  To a guy in a gas mask.
---
They gave something.  Who did they give it to?
---
Answer: a guy in a gas mask
---
What did they give?
---
Answer:  the explicit authorization...
---
Now put that all together and we have my original sentence:
---
they gave a guy in a gas mark **THE** explicit authorization...
---
I'll tell you this as someone still playing.  
---
You are not missing much.  The meta is incredibly 1 dimensional with utterly predictable match ups that are often decided by turn 4/5.  
---
I hope anyone who has quit has found a game that is more strategic in it's play and if you have perhaps post what the game is and how it is better than the monotony that HS is fast turning into?
---
Is that how they spell hypocrite in your authoritarian shithole? We spell it different in the land of freedom :)
---
Combo Priest and variations of aggressive Shaman decks are very strong and relatively cheap right now. There are cheap Merloc and Evolve Shamans. 
---
Flamewaker is back and enables cheap Mage cycle decks with spells; most of the stuff you'd craft for it are generically useful outside of that deck.
---
The rest of the classes are pretty expensive at the moment unfortunately.
---
Pretty bummed.
---
I grew up on WC3 and am still very attached to the franchise. I still have a 2004 installation on my pc, been moving it from hdd to hdd all this time.
---
Hopped on WoW Classic train because I couldn't play it during my teenage years and wanted to experience what I have missed. It was extremely fun 4 weeks, but now my sub expired and I don't want to renew it, even though I still want to play, and hit lvl40.
---
Luckily or not, some IRL stuff came up and I've been really busy since the weekend, probably won't be able to play this week even if I want to.
---
What sucks is that I became hooked on WoW because it was my childhood, just picking up another MMORPG probably won't cut it since I don't have any emotional attachment to other MMOs and I'm not even a big fan of the genre. Guess a private server is still an option.
---
I was also very excited for WC3 Reforged. Guess I'll skip it, too, even though it's kinda killing me, figuratively.
---
You really think he's spineless?  I thought it was a rational response to the reduced punishment.
---
Divine Spirit isn't the problem. Cleric is.
---
U rite tho
---
I think we could have a reasonable discussion about the length of punishment.  I agree that the initial punishment was batshit crazy.  The problem is that people have said *any* punishment is bootlicking &amp; censorship, which is fkin absurd.
---
This is something a lot of western fundamentally don’t understand especially among a lot of East Asian countries. Chinese people will not care if government monitor them as long as they are allowed to enjoy all the benefit of capitalism. China have some of the strongest safety net in the world. Despite massive privatization, they have retain some socialist tradition like universal health care and good education system and thriving economy. Is it hard to see why many Chinese would side with Beijing over Hong Kong? 
---
Not to mention tradition and sense of nationalism. I am from Vietnam and we share a lot of common traits to our neighbor China in the north. And Vietnam culture is that they value themselves as an independent  nation than a free nation. Vietnam willing join and side with Soviet Union just so we could be liberate from the French. We rather be slave to our own government than free in another foreign government.
---
Many western still to this day did not understand this sentiment. This is why Hong Kong situation have to look at from historical context and cultural of China not just one side point of view in the west.
---
I agree with this.
---
I think if Blizzard is going to draw a line in the sand, they need to include ALL politics, not just specific ones.
---
Did I hallucinate the entire last week? Or are you 10 second Todd from 50 First Dates?
---
Maybe let's better fight for old Jaina's cleavage? Wear "bring those boobs back" t-shirts at blizzcon to support boob rights.
---
You do get that there are people that aren't forgetful shills, right? No one is forcing you to be a part of this topic. Go spread your indifference somewhere else.
---
Sounds fun! Will be trying this
---
Work in the industry and anyone who thought the boycott was the cause of the dip when the market as an index dipped overall doesn’t understand the least bit basic info about it

Someone rezed 3 frogs while failing to mention Hong Kong’s need for liberation.

It's a game company that used to be very beloved and part of most gamer's childhoods with world of Warcraft and for my generation even older games like Blackthorne, lost vikings, and the original Warcraft 1&amp;2 and Starcraft.  But them oddly siding with a communist totalitarian regime which has committed numerous human rights violations.  The combination of these two things is quite frankly something we in the video game world have never seen before.    And rightly people are taking umbridge with it.
---
Well. Fuck.
---
It only died because China has censored what we can post on this subreddit and stick on Google images. They've just silenced the people that want to still raise their voice and I doubt they'd change their mind in a few days
---
not until you realise that entertainment can shape people's minds and the pentagon has specifically funded military movies as a form of sneaky advertising to get kids to join the army like top gun

Two alternatives obviously come to mind, MTGA and Gods Unchained.
---
Maybe try Shadowverse, if you're not put off by the anime visuals? It's available on both PC and mobile.
---
There's also new auto battler genre, with TFT, Underlords and standalone Autochess representing it. The latter two are mobile-available and don't require a parent game client.
---
Evolve Shaman and Combo Priest. Just kill them early.
---
Congrats!
---
go read up their 5 demands lmao
---
It's very simple, for every English speaking player, there are probably 5-10 Chinese players that Blizzard would happily ruin your life for. That's it really

I haven't found any dirt on Elder Scrolls online yet, but that's about it tbh.

I can't hear you over the sound of how fucking old I am.

My sights are set on helping people withdraw their support from an American company that supports an oppressive government. To do that I referenced a letter written by a person who had first had experience with violent oppression. There is value in the letter that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote, and I was happy to share that with others.
---
Not everyone is coming into this at your level of wisdom. You need to allow for people from different walks of life with different experiences to grow into supporting the cause of freedom. Thanks for the reply, though. You gave good advice.
---
&gt; the company that owns hearthstone bending their knee to an authoritarian regime has nothing to do with hearthstone and anyone who wants to talk about said authoritarian regime using their influence to censor western art is talking out of context and irrelevant to hearthstone
---
We never really had a strong buff paladin deck, so buff as a deck archetype isn't super strong, it should be fine.
---
What cause? Because of a communist regime censoring news FROM THE REST OF THE FUCKING WORLD? The CCP allow the harvesting of ORGANS from Uyghur muslims, mostly killing them and parting them out like used cars....
---
I'm sorry but how do you even have the balls to come in here and say this disgustingly ignorant shit?
---
Literally nobody is saying the criticism is invalid. If you're going to argue, argue against what people are actually saying.
---
In the case of GM, no, it’s impossible. Because there’s no any continent (I prefer calling them this way than mainland) Chinese competitors in GM.
---
I read some comments, it seems nobody noticed it.
---
Honestly, winning a fight would be easy: just stop using their services and use services provided by people who have standards. That's all, if corporation isn't profitable, it crumbles. 
---
You don't even have to go far to search for alternatives in case of Hearstone - there is Gods Unchained, a game with a very simillar to HS mechanics, and it's developers not only instantly step up for blitz and offered to pay for his lost prize and give him an expencive ticket to their tournament, but also were raising money to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which supports privacy and freedom of speech.
---
Also in that game you can sell your rewards for real money and trade cards for real money. They have free drafts. They have no limits how many packs you earn per day (and you basicly earn 1 per win, and 2 per won draft). The game is awesome.  
---
The only problem is that there is rarely a chance they will be bigger than HS. Why? Because mose of the customers do not care who sells them the game. Majority will play the game that's promouted the most, and i doubt that anyone can compare with megacorp's promotion budgets. I believe that majority of the players are not even aware of this situation and just playing a game. You can help by making them aware. Tell your friends. Tell everyone. 
---
And in case you want to join the GU beta (release is at the end of this month) - here is my invite - https://godsunchained.com?beta-key=opzTHVIeaG
---
Now that’s just funny.
---
Sorry, guess I misread your "make a stand" comment.
---
Still, my point stands. This is his livelihood we're talking about, and 10 grand is not an insignificant amount of money. I don't think it's really fair to criticize him without knowing his needs or what was actually going on behind the scenes, when you're just an outside observer.
---
The fallacy in that is that it's about having *all* of it. Good economy, good employment rates, good healthcare, good education, low crime rate, *and* freedom.
---
China frames the question as if freedom is incompatible with the other qualities. But it isn't. Japan and Taiwan is proof to that. Especially Taiwan, which has a very high similarity to China. And that is what many Chinese people can't fathom: it isn't a question of either-or.

If you want to beat greedy decks, you need to make sure they don't have time to be greedy. As such, play aggressively.
---
Well said. Fight on!!
---
Strict, yes, but even-handed. They don't allow any sort of political thing into their high level competitions (keeping in mind I haven't experienced anything but the big ticket Worlds and MSI type stuff so I can't speak for regional competitions.). They keep it very game-centric and the interviews are very guided, asking about the game, their tactics, choices etc, but very much dodging any outlet for statements of any kind. I'll accept that over anything that could be perceived as preferential treatment.
---
Blizzard is a company, the same way Walmart, Google or Disney is.  They \*don't\* care about you, they never did.   Maybe they did way back in the day before the Activision merge, but these days they're just a company.  You were not ever their friend, you were a source of revenue.  
---
That hasn't changed.  
---
Should they not have come down this hard on Blitzchung in the first place? Absolutely. Unfortunately, humans make fuck ups, and companies are run by humans, so they did. Very badly at that. And then after being singed by MASSIVE backlash, they walked the punishment back just like people wanted.  They cannot go back in time and stop it from happening, the expectation being set here is not reasonable.  
---
Additionally, what you've said does not address the latter half of my previous post. If you are absolutely unyielding, you have given them no incentive to stop dealing with China.  Why should they cut off a large portion and prospective larger future portion of their business, to "Redeem" themselves in the eyes of people who have stated they were never going to come back anyway, even if they do/did the right thing?  If there's no winning people back over then there's no incentive to stop doing it, because China is perfectly happy with what they did and perfectly happy giving them money.  It is actively pushing them EVEN FURTHER into China's influences, rather then driving it off.  
---
You can do that if you want to, it's a valid choice to make. But there's absolutely consequences to choosing that sort of hard line path. The purpose of a boycott is to effect a change, and when the change is made the boycott is broken. If there's no intent to ever go back, then there's no reason for them to ever capitulate to the boycotters demands. Because it was never money that would come back.
---
You must be one of “those” ppl who 1) don’t know how to structure an argument, 2) don’t understand the context/logic of another person’s statement
---
&gt; You can criticize China without supporting a piece of shit in the process.
---
Then show me the dozens of people saying the same thing? Who else took the statement apart? A lot of people bitch, but *none* of them provide even *one* link to any of that. None of you can't even be arsed to make your own writeup and say "take this instead". No, you just moan.
---
&gt; most notable for [..] supporting China's government
---
as in?
---
Listen, I'm not gonna defend the analogy, but digging into a thread on reddit, finding a lame comment, and using it to trash a movement is dirty pool. Every movment whether morally right or wrong, politically left or right, has people who make ridiculous statements. You don't use them to dismiss the whole.
---
Deck has the highest of highrolls and lowest of low rolls is probs why.
---
&gt; everytime blizz is in the news some shady ex-developer appears and seeks attention.
---
Is what he is saying wrong? No. Is it worthwile saying? Yes.
---
So, who else is saying it, why aren't you linking those instead, instead of calling it "giving attention to" someone who shouldn't get attention?. If all you saintly people can't be arsed to write what he wrote, then we'll quote him instead, and you can go pound sand. Just replacing it with *nothing*, which is what all you are in implicitly proposing with your useless bitching without providing an alternative, is not an option. I for one don't give fuck one about the guy, this is about the issue. I think the whole gaming industry is more fucked up than not, so I really, really cannot partake in this pearl clutching crap. He's at worst slightly scummier than other scum that gets celebrated by everybody and their dog, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Guess so
---
He already did stand up, then when it turns out he couldn't play HS anymore he capitulates.  
---
Other companies were willing to support him even.  Just seems weak to me it all to not really even be able to back up the stance he made in the first place.
---
To be fair they're both pretty vague, but yes, they're also not operating in a different region of the world.
---
The vaguity argument is pretty nonsensical though. While yes, they *could* theoretically be applied to all sorts of ridiculous things... they weren't, and it's unreasonable to expect they would be. Most institutions have some kind of general/catch-all/discretionary rule, to both deter participants from doing anything controversial, but also to avoid people finding loopholes in their more explicit rules.
---
Umm Blizzard still hasn't apologized for this shit. Instead we get a half assed apology from Blizzard that they didn't do this because of China. I'm sorry but it won't be over until Blizzard steps up.
---
That is correct, they are mad about an extradition treaty with China.
---
&gt;You can't just call massive amounts of people idiots and, when you get pointed out that's not ok, claim that "anyone offended is because they know it's true".  
---
Pretty sure idiot wasn't the word I used but maybe that's your self perception at play?  
---
And yes I can say what I said because I did say what I said.  Funny how that works.
---
Yes cause again, freedom of speech goes both ways. You failed to address that part in your reply, and just deflected the whole deal without a reply on it
---
&gt;I know most products I buy come from companies that do terrible stuff.  
---
That makes you a very bad person then.
---
I run it in some wild decks (specifically highlander decks).  Card is fine.

What I said was what happens in Taiwan is important to China, as they've had serious socio-political issues for the last 50 years (although it really stretched back even further than that). I was specifically referring to your statement *"The antithesis of PRC given that the official name of Taiwan is "Republic of China"."* There's a *lot* of contention there which should not be overlooked.

Most redditors do it because it gets upvotes.

Dunno, but your request came thru.  I'll be on again in 2 hours!

---
He's also fairly left leaning because he despises unfettered capitalism and is socially progressive.
---
So there's going to be a lot of bad faith disdain in the gamer community.
---
You have clearly never played against Pirate Warrior.
---
He is really good because he is almost free. You don't have to spend a card or mana to put it into play, only a card slot. As long as you run Pirates, you want to have him in your deck because you're almost guaranteed to benefit from him.
---
To put it into perspective before it was nerfed it had Charge and was in 30% of Standard decks.
---
I hate the situation because they had no legal rights to take away his winnings. They just decided to flex with their china love. 
---
The fact that they returned money later doesn't mean jack shit. They sent the message they wanted. Contrary to many people on this sub, I agree that had to be punished - politics should not be involved, no matter the side. But, they also fired casters, who were innocent - dick move, not very legal one again.
---
“It’s pretty simple” he says 😅
---
And so is anyone promoting any other social or political issue for blizzard but it is more socially acceptable to do so.
---
That's just how it is now days , but it only last a few days. The funny part is that the people that were dumb enough to delete their accounts or dust their cards will be calling blizzard in a month crying to get everything back.
---
It very easy for western country especially those of US to say forget the past let move on and focus on brighter future when they are not victims.
---
I am not trying to shit on america because as of right now I have been naturalized as an American and I am enjoying freedom america given me. However that does not mean I do not understand mentality of people in asia who where exploit by the west.
---
For example. 
---
I was not born during vietnam war. However my country right now have 4 millions people suffered from effect of agent orange that american use to kill tree and root out vietcong. They are now born deformed with missing limb and deformed face/body some even born without a nose. 
---
And American done nothing so far to help these people leaving for vietnamese government to deal with themselves which they set up orphanage and school to help these people but due to vietnam being third world, help is insufficient.
---
Are you going to tell these people to forget it and move on with their life?
---
It very easy again to live in a country that benefit from colonialism and act like everything is easy.
---
And saying that is still damaging to Blizzard.  Just look at some of the posts here about how selective Blizzard has been about supporting certain causes.
---
No doubt people would still criticize Blizzard for distancing themselves from this matter of human rights and international law because of their ties to China while championing other matters of human rights that aren't financially detrimental.
---
And dude.  They ducked their heads and hid behind the monitor as Blitzchung said what he did.
---
Mech hunter is cheap too, or secret mage
---
MegaMilked#11244, i show u go first
---
I think it's true though. It's very hard for a westerner to understand the concept of filial piety, taking care of your elders, even to the extent of elder worship. Most families in Singapore stay together until the children get married, and even then sometimes the newly weds stay with the parents still. This is very rare in western cultures.
---
Singaporean and the chinese diaspora culture is changing, though, I think primarily due to the influence of western culture and its "ownership" of almost all popular media.
---
Unironically spreading propaganda and misinformation to try to recruit people for a cause doesn't make it okay. Isn't this one of the problems we have with China? Be more neutral in your presentation. Helping Hong Kong is a good cause, but harassing people with misinformation in a place where the train has left the station is just going to turn people off.
---
People still visit subs of games they don't play?
---
That doesn’t matter. 
---
They set precedent with Blitzchung, and not following that precedent with AU, is bullshit. 
---
Either both get penalized or they dont.
---
They chose their path, but opted another route when dealing with the AU players. That sends a clear signal that the Blitzchung ruling was to please the Chinese overlords.
---
The only reason not to ban AU players here, is clearly the fear of getting fucked by every politician who want to be hard on China.
---
You get the same responses when you say you don’t like DrDisrespect because he’s an asshole, all the replies are “oh but he’s only playing a character!”, ok? Then I don’t like the character, nothing changes.
---
The CCP and denying attrocities.
---
It was already a strong tier one deck that was a regular at Grand Masters.  They added Evolve to it - specifically they added turn 4 Rabbits Evolve for 12 Mana worth of minions and sometimes an extra 8 drop.  Remeber when they nerfed Hunter spellstone?  The Shaman Evolve play is better.
---
1. I stated the last bit of my sentence to say if you replied, i'd be able to see what you were, not that you were immediately a troll. if you didn't reply, i could see that you were a troll.  
---
2. I'll be defending my argument right now.
---
People do not just bitch on reddit to bring attention to themselves. They bring attention to the topic at hand, which is Hong Kong protests. That's what's so shit to me, you thinking you have it so pinned down that every single person on here is just here for attention. The simple fact that you believe they want attention so they comment and bitch about it shows me that you hands down probably believe that about every single thing like this on the internet, which is probably the most stupidest thing I've ever seen in my damn life considering you are able to say all this shit in such an organized way.  From the way I see it, you assume everyone hasn't deleted their accounts, and if you can show me the slightest bit of proof, i'll give you that much.  I don't even fucking play WoW and yet I want to support the cause. Not every internet gathering is an attention-seeking hoard you dumb fuck.
---
These aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
Jesus that was a whole lot of absolutely nothing lmao
---
? you're an idiot if you think you have absolute democracy/freedom of speech in any country
---
Getting 3 4 drops and sometimes a 8 drop on turn 3-4 is the epitome of balanced gameplay and you can't tell me otherwise.
---
I think on a new run it caps at 20 but you can get more in that run, but don't quote me on that one.
---
Five demands, not one less. Especially when the police are still beating the shit out of citizens.
---
Rank 5 player. Considering playing Quest Evolve Shaman cuz it's just so strong right now, but i don't have Barista &amp; Shudderwalk. What can i replace them with? They are very unique battlecries so i don't know what to match them with. I was considering Siamat and Youthful Brewmaster.
---
I don't really agree with Kibler's take, which makes Blizzard choosing that as their apology angle even more hollow. The voice in China might be netease but it's still a porxy Blizzard is supporting - and that's why I no longer have an account.
---
Between Odd Warrior and Control Warrior it was literally over a year of having to deal with the exact same boring playstyle. Good riddance I say.

China has invaded as is still occupying Tibet.

I really like Blizzards games, but with their policies I really can't agree

I believe the whole Uyghur surveillance thing began after a giant revolt erupted in Xinjiang that costed thousands of lives of Non-musilims.

Oh get off it. You spineless fat fuck probably haven’t stood up let alone stood up for something for the betterment of others your entire life. If you’re so fucking naive to believe that you’re justified in telling people to get in line you’re a lost cause. Go play your shitty pay to win game and leave the boycott to the men and women who give a shit about others. Pathetic creep.

&gt;It's very hard for a westerner to understand the concept of filial piety, taking care of your elders, even to the extent of elder worship.
---
Sure that maybe true but there is a big difference between choosing to stay and forced to stay. 
---
Also isn't this really besides the point? I agree asian and western culture is different but it doesn't mean all chinese culture is exactly the same.
---
Hi, as a singaporean Chinese, I definitely can see both sides of the argument, and that it is very true how much more emphasis the Chinese place on overall unity and respecting the higher authority. Chinese culture is built on family structures, with the youths being taught to respect the elders and listen to them. It is no wonder how this kind of mindset will be transferred to their political views, with that kind of trust in your upper authorities/ seniors. Hence, even with how tightly the government controls freedom of speech and political freedom, most chinese will not see a problem with it as long as their daily livelihood is not directly affected by it. There is the believe that the government knows what is best for them. Singapore is similar, with our country being ruled by a single political party since our independence. Although we do have elections, the same party has been elected for more than 50 years consecutively, even though Singaporeans government could be argued as totalitarian as well. However, we as Singaporeans can understand the anger at culture cleansing as well, and why the West values freedom and individualism as well. Singapore at its core is a multi-racial and multi-cultured country, and from young, we are taught to treat everyone as equals. We value our friends from different cultures/races , and actively mesh together as Singapore. It is not a rare sight to see Muslims celebrating Chinese New year at one their Chinese friends homes. We value freedom of expression, because as a ex-British colony, we as a country have values deeply influenced by the west.
---
Hence, as a person with equal influence of both East and the west, even though I do stand with Hong Kong, I do not believe bashing China as a dictatorship/propaganda filled country is valid. It is just the difference in values that make the other side seem worst off then it is. I would suggest to try and be more open minded that different cultures value different things, and that being different does not necessarily mean that they are wrong.
---
Its because they clearly did it for money and no other reason.
---
it is even crazier when you have already completed quest on turn 6 and play hero power, rabbits, evolve
---
Don't worry, while many players have moved on and the subs for Blizzard and this one have already forgotten, there are others who won't let it go so easily! Check out /r/boycottblizzard to keep up with what's going on.
---
V- VALUE
---
I can't speak for others, but my reason for my discontent with Blizzard is how they've been treating the community, communication-wise.
---
It didn't start with HK, it started with the closing of HotS, the firing of people, the Diablo: Immortal fiasco. I'll preface it by saying that actually, some of these things made a lot of sense. I recently argued in an article that if a circuit is losing money (like HotS) you have to shut it down. And if you want to shift your corporate structure to hire a lot of devs, you have to make space by letting some people go (and now, it never does work like "Bobby Kotick should give some of his money to just hire new people and save other people's jobs". That's not how any corporation works, not just Blizzard and Kotick. I used to work for the Russian Google and still got fired, you think those guys don't have money?)
---
But it's just how they presented it all. They misled everyone to think there was going to be HGC 2019 for a long time, not letting them know they are going to cut it (and they knew, 100%, because you don't just take this decision overnight). If they had told people in advance, yet shit might've leaked (likely), but it would've given people time to find different career opportunities, especially for the players. And with the layoffs, they put it in the same doc in which they bragged about how rich they got. Yes, as I said, one doesn't have to do with the other necessarily, but you just DON'T DO THAT. That's a fucking DICK MOVE. 
---
And now Blitzchung. I won't pretend I understand the HK/CN policy. I live thousands of km's away, I don't speak the language and while I've heard many horror CN stories from close friends who experienced them first-hand, I don't have a dog in the race. Yes, I hope HK gets more democratic, but I certainly won't be losing sleep over it, let's be honest. 
---
No, my problem is they once again fucked up about how they communicated with us and treated us like we're idiots. Even if the ban had nothing to do with CN (which we know is bullshit, ofc), they didn't even make an attempt to show they are against ANY politics talk on their stream (although the hypocrisy of the pride OWL streams has been accurately pointed out). They misjudged the punishment, they lied to the public, sneaked an announcement on Friday night... It's not even "textbook" black PR, it must be from some new edition of the textbook, cuz that shit

s from 3019.

My 2 cents.

Just FYI - OP is a super fresh account so as always proceed with caution.

This was from the 8th, and blizzard just recently said they will be giving the winnings to him in their recent post.

---
Where are the Shimmerflies? I only see frogs...
---
I can respect your reasonable response to my extremely loaded comment. That in itself somewhat redeems what you said earlier in a way.
---
I agree with the violence being nasty and not helping either side but that's the nature of trying to change a system that won't change unless you make it. I deeply sympathize with China's police who are trying not to get killed themselves, while the protesters fear for their lives just the same.
---
As for the "mask" part: I'm not sure anyone in their right mind should stand up to a government that is perfectly capable of finding and purging you the second they get a good glimpse of your face. I come from a country that has a history of eradicating certain demographic groups and being damn good at it. This leaves me deeply worried, as technology has advanced so far that anonymity is near impossible. 
---
History has shown that there is very little a nonviolent protest can do about a government that is willing to punch back with lethal force, even less when the protesters have no access to outside resources. 
---
Fingers crossed that the death toll doesn't shoot up in the coming weeks.
---
Weird using Vietnam as an example to defend China since they have very poor relations with China.
---
If you want to look in the past how about the fact a political party that claims they are all about the worker's revolution and claims to fight for the workers. Yet, opposes them just like the Imperialists they claim to fight. Another communist party that as soon as they got power became the actual counter-revolutionaries.
---
What? When did gamers become right wing all of a sudden?
---
No democracy.
---
No freedom of spect.
---
Citizens are watched and a social point system is used.
---
No free media.
---
Sounds like a prime example of a totalitarian regime.
---
Statistically from a winrate perspective flamewaker is in the bottom 1/3 in win percentage of the cards they released at around just 47%.There is absolutely nothing wrong with it and it will not be changed. You are not being consistently killed on T4.
---
I would take all of this 'protesting' you guys do a lot more seriously if you at least knew what you were supporting, like, 99% of you mindlessly writes 'LIBERATEUH HUNKUN' but you have no fuckin clue what the HK'ers are even protesting against without having to google it first when you actually get asked about it.
---
THAT is what pisses me off the most.
---
Except it is perfectly possible to prove someone is straight. They have sex with women and enjoy it, and don't want to have sex with men.
---
There is no counter evidence that's says China is not forcefully harvesting organs of Uighur Muslims, and there is plenty of evidence they are.
---
To use your example: if there were men who were saying you had sex with them, and no woman would corroborate that you had sex with them, then I am right to assume you are gay.
---
You can hope to discover a silence minion (like spellbreaker) with your hero power until fatigue catch up with rag healings, then HS out and hope it doesn't happens again
---
Well, of course the protest would have laid down after some days from the facts related to Blitzchung. I believe this is normal and probably Blizzard is just waiting now for all this to just deflate oneself. What I see on Reddit is that r/hearthstone and r/Blizzard are the top growing communities, so people were interested in the situation and I am honestly happy that all of this brought on top of the news the Hong Kong situation and China again and captured the attention of people from all the world.
---
I can't speak for others, but to me the position Blizzard took to face the matter was "too much wrong" and therefore I've thrown away my account for good. I stood with Hong Kong before Blizzard's scandal and I keep staying with them no matter what.
---
Some of the accounts had no previous posts in r/hearthstone or in activity in it, no to mention the karma whoring that was going on from active members.
---
It is quite interesting though how the China stance of pushing that HK is trying to become independent is the one the west has hooked onto. Each post saying "Liberate HK" is basically pushing China's narrative.
---
What countries did China invade? Hmm. All of Asia and now the rest of the world through soft power and offers of easily available cheap commodities. Yup, that's about it. And we see the consequences of playing the long game and invading softly, not straight out guns blazing. China is smart. And they will win in the end. It's just a matter of time.
---
Nice. Pretty impressive you defeated normal difficulty AI on the first turn after 100 independent runs of this same run and countless combinations of unique rewards tested for maximum efficiency &amp; effectiveness.
---
Your going places kid. Don't you forget that.
---
Well for one Hearthstone became the number one subreddit overnight eclipsing the NBA and other very popular subreddits,  also many of the posts were repetitive in nature such as "I'm deleting my account" etc.  Unfortunately I'm sure some young naive kids actually deleted their accounts over an issue they heard about a few days ago.
---
&gt; Weird to see people reacting negatively to his persona
---
You can both not like his "persona" and support his views. I do. I'm just tired of angry-shouty-internet-personalities in general.
---
You can't force someone to be your brother, that's not family.  Maybe something in the word is lost in translation?
---
Are you upset with the strength of the deck, or the play experience?
---
The deck currently has a very low win-rate and not seen much on ladder (4-L).
---
I deleted my account. I stood with Hong Kong before Blizzard's scandal and I keep staying with them no matter what.  If someone here wants to keep staying updated, I suggest to join the r/HongKong community.
---
The play experience.
---
The Doom promotion cards are a different set from the originals, you'll lose the promotion version and keep the originals.

Havent played for a while so im outoftheloop, why isnt he craftable? I thought this was a wild Card

HOLY FUCK !!! hope this dude gets cancer

Jesus fuck. I went in just expecting one unpleasant comment like "I didn't really like that guy much anyway", which is a valid opinion but kind of shitty to say immediately in the wake of their death.
---
Instead I saw a transcript of a man digging his own grave with such fervor that he didn't even notice when he hit bedrock and just kept going until he was swallowed by the Earth's own molten innards.
---
Thanks for adding that!
---
There are too many for us to complaint to CCP and HK government and HK police that I always miss something when tell others what is happening in Hong Kong.
---
If hearthstone had a sideboard it would be a great card... but you know we cant have non rng rubbish.
---
There actually isn't. This cards will not stay in standard forever, that's why they are called "featured set". When they go back to wild you will probablly be able to disenchant them

Sorry for digging into your comment history. I have to, since I dont know who I can trust.

Bro, your account was created 2 months ago. Almost every single comment you have made since account creation was about HK's protests, most of them are biased against China. You also said you are Aussie, so I would like to know your source of information about HK's situation.
---
Not that any of these is wrong by itself but I have to take what you said with a grain of salt.
---
bro 😎💪
---
I don't think it's hypocrisy though I understand why you'd come to that conclusion, different situations warrant different consequences, and whether or not we agree that the Grandmasters should have had more stringent and robust rules, the fact remains that they *did* and they were agreed to before hand. It's not even unreasonable to assume those rules existed because they were broadcasting in a more politically unstable part of the world and I'm not arguing any of that. I'm only arguing that what they did was in accordance with their rules, and their leaving the collegiate tournament in the hands of its own staff is up to their discretion.
---
This "responding to China" stuff is nonsense, it literally does not follow a logical order of events.
---
* They punished Blitzchung in accordance with a rule that was written before the tournament began, so it's illogical to say they only handed out that punishment due to Chinese pressure when it was written before anything involving China came up.
---
* You *can* say that choosing not to levy similar punishments to the collegiate students is to avoid allegations of Chinese complicancy, and you might even be right, but you can't use Blitzchung's punishment as a precedent, because the collegiate student's rules allowed for more discretion.
---
&gt; Also Grandmaster's Rule didn't have 'clearly established mandatory consequences'. There is a rule that mentions reducing the prize to 0$, but it's not applicable in this case as they recognized by giving his money back.
---
It did, I even quoted it above.
---
&gt; 2019 HEARTHSTONE® GRANDMASTERS OFFICIAL COMPETITION RULES v1.4 p.12, Section 6.1 (o)
---
&gt; Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in **removal from Grandmasters** and **reduction of the player’s prize total to $0 USD**, in addition to **other remedies** which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard’s Website Terms.
---
They hit all three boxes - removed him from Grandmasters, reduced his prize total, and suspended him as per section 7.1 of said Handbook. Changing their ruling after the fact was almost certainly a matter of public appeasement, but they have every right to attempt that, it doesn't change the fact that *the immediate action* was in accordance with the established Grandmaster's rule - a rule that did not exist in the TESPA tournament.
---
&gt;  And there is absolutely no precedent to what happened with the casters.
---
What happened with the casters is a completely different conversation. They're not tournament participants, so they don't fall under those rules; rather they have their own separate contracts which (afaik) have not been released to the public (and probably won't be), and almost certainly have some robust conduct and representation clauses, as is the usual with any public facing contractor.
---
I don't understand your point. So you want the cams to be on so that the shit show can continue? People like you is why they wont allow cams, blizzard knows no matter what they do they cant please the angry mob. They made a statement with the punishment of blitzchung and casters that "tournaments are not to be used as political platforms".
---
welcome to shamanstone
---
Finally a post in which we can learn a bit of what's really going on in both perspectives
---
Kudos to you !
---
Eh, the first hand accounts are likely to be the only real evidence we could ever really hope for. It's extremely unlikely China would be careless enough to let footage of it happening out *if* it was happening. Nor are they ever going to admit to it, obviously. I'll leave whether you want too believe up to you, personally I wouldn't really put it past the CCP. 
---
I will say, though, that in the way you posted, you cam across as defending what the guys above were arguing, which was there was no wrong-doing by China, so sorry for mistaking that.

The even more fucked up thing is, actually current law already does allow extraditions to Taiwan on a case by case basis. Taiwan made 4 such request, with each request being ignored. [The current Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance specifics that case-by-case extraditions are possible to jurisdictions without an agreement that are outside of Hong Kong and "other than the Central People’s Government or the government of any other part of the People’s Republic of China"](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap525?SEARCH_WITHIN_CAP_TXT=arrangements%20for%20mutual%20legal%20assistance):

&gt;arrangements for mutual legal assistance (相互法律協助的安排) means arrangements—

---
&gt;(i)the Government and the government of a place outside Hong Kong (other than the Central People’s Government or the government of any other part of the People’s Republic of China); or

---
&gt;(b)for the purposes of the provision and obtaining of assistance in criminal matters between Hong Kong and that place;
---
Taiwan is not part of the PRC. This is a fact that any independent legal system operating in a jurisdiction with rule of law would conclude. It's just a tough pill to swallow for Beijing, which is why they have been putting so much pressure on HK.
---
As an outsider, I can emphatise with the reasons of protest especially with the extradition bill as well as the over-excessive use of violence by the police.
---
What are your opinions on the small group of protesters who have turned to violent means such a Molotov cocktails or even recently the IED? Does it derail the legitimacy of the protest? Or are there reasons to believe that they were agent provocateurs?
---
You're spamming this every 10 minutes lol. You really do think *your* voice matter. 
---
I mean c'mon closing a comment section is not against freedom of speech. It's well within blizzard's right to disable comments in their own site.

Empty loot boxes are actually quite common.

Love how people can just say scathing shit like this without any evidence at all, and other people take that as fact and parrot it everywhere. Nice.

The left-most card on the board "violet Illusionist" makes you immune on your turn
---
Absolutely top tier post, and very well informed, but I disagree with some of your points defending or toning down China's actions. People literally fear to speak against their government in any way, have to live in ignorance and censorship, some disappear off the face of the planet after being arrested. This is getting dangerously close to the nightmarish world George Orwell predicted in the book 1984(written in the 1940s, and just becomes more and more relevant with each decade), and if China's government wins, it will only get worse. You can't defend that. Fuck China.
---
So you want a variety of options but you also don't like options that suggest treating the immediate issues and then working towards long term solutions more fully over the long term?
---
If you want, go bother someone else. I'm not interested in talking with a walking personification of [the Argument Sketch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohDB5gbtaEQ)
---
I will feel badly when I read about HK because it's a sad situation over there. But as sane individual I also know that playing a video game has no relation to what is happening there.
---
If you do that, you'll have zero copies when the event ends.
---
The issue is OP can't dust THIS copy, which is means their arena award is less valuable
---
Blizzard changed their format to appease China. Finding this acceptable is absolutely appalling. If you don't understand why this is an issue I feel sorry for you.
---
People who dust golden Millhouses are spiritually dead inside.
---
10% of China is still 140 million people.

Use the dust to create a normal millhouse

Just kidding haha

Thing is... Will blizzard let him return?
---
WTF is this commentary?
---
Blizzard and banning people before a thorough investigation is complete.
---
Blizzard changed their format because they do not what the shit storm that comes with it! Dude do you not see the other comments on here. No one cares about this crap, it's just some feel good bs that SJWs follow like they always do for a week or two and then move on to the next trendy thing. Stay woke
---
*Oh how the turntables
---
How did denying forced organ harvesting in China become an alt-right issue?  I thought Trump hated China.
---
I thought being a little worried about China's human rights record was the one thing that united everyone.
---
Holy shit yeah I was watching a youtube video in the background, forgot to mute the sound xDDDD
---
Practically everything you buy &amp; use is from China.
---
Cancel everything Patrick, everything. In fact, you should probably get off the device you're using to post this. The parts most definitely came from China as well.
---
&gt;Just like America.
---
So?
---
Anything that happened in the past is 'history'. Also, history cannot be the cause of anything, as it is only describes the events from the past
---
Imagine still giving this company money. Fucking sheep BAAAAAAAAAAH
---
We don't know this is your last game. As far as we know, you recorded this as "proof" but cheated in other games. The way you are making such deliberately slow moves makes me think that.
---
The return of Nzoth.
---
They like to do anything to 'own the libs' so when 'the libs' turn against China, they turn against their perceived enemy.
---
According to many upvoted posts on this subreddit over the past week, any company doing business with china has taken an obvious pro-China position, and anyone doing business there is supporting the numerous human rights violations of their government
---
The game fucking sucks, just because you're a coward who won't upset the status quo doesnt mean everyone else is.
---
Isn't this what people "wanted" after the AU thing?
---
I mean if they have evidence of cheating they should always provide it. I think all of us think that claiming that "USER A violated RULE B so we ban him" is unacceptable. If You have evidence show it. Imagine police going in to your house and they take You to jail. No case, no judge, no verdict or even OPTION TO DEFEND, just jail for life. This is on the same mentality level.  
---
Lately we see more bans than ever. Going to support is as useful as going to desert for a cup of water. So people started to call to communities so that at least they could make the case loud enough to get a response from Blizzard. That is just treating customer like a insignificant insect.  
---
"We don't care. You are guilty by our evidence that might or not exist."
---
It is true that you can't be sure this is my last game. However, a maly druid deck with kun in standard can't be that old right? Also, the reason I was playing so slow was because it was the final boss to legend, and I just wanted to count everything 2,3,4 times to make sure I had lethal
---
One of my favorite decks in wild has Tog, archmage, and Valeera the Hollow. On an empty board with that treasure and Valeera active, you can go Archmage+crown+crown and then get a third crown proc for 10 mana and a full board.
---
The games matchmaking system as well as card draw system uses the same rules as zephrys to try to keep people at a 50% win rate.
---
"you guys" &amp; phones
---
Let me adjust tH Kost of that for you.
---
I stopped playing the game years ago, but almost all of these look amazing, imo, specially Gul'dan and Uther (coincidentally my 2 favorite classes). Pirate Valeera is cool but doesn't make much sense.
---
I don't like Rexxar (ugly af picture) and Malfurion (it's pretty much the same as the old one?)
---
&gt;hurting a company who directly squandered free speech because of their relations with China.
---
Are you aware that this isn't a free speech issue? 
---
Are you aware of why this isn't a free speech issue? 
---
Are you aware of what free speech actually is?
---
Oh, that, that's just stirring the pot of emotions everyone is feeling. Blizz didnt do x so that means y. I dont think anyone REALLY believes blizzard is in favor of communism, they are just equating their actions (pursing money) with being equivalent of favoring communism. Which is fair, imo. 
---
They arent literally in favor of communism, their actions are just equivalent to being in favor of it.
---
They were already streaming with delays... They let it happen willingly. Atleast the broadcast manager knew it was going to happen and gave casters and blizz the go. But they got scapegoated. And they do use delays already.
---
How is that even close to what I said? Of course I don't disagree with the message or one person trying to make a real difference, but changing a tiny subreddit doesn't achieve anything, it's just slacktivism
---
Hopefully you all know to make your voices heard. The Chinese government is sensitive to there public image. Protesting in America does effect them even second handedly through companies that work with them. Free Hong Kong. Boycott blizzard.
---
If a guy walked up to blizzard and offered them a billion dollars to murder a hundred babies, would you be happy for them to do that because it was just a “business decision”? Clearly not everything that’s finically best is objectively best, and the original move to ridiculously over punish blitz and the casters obviously comes under that.
---
Also why does everyone think we’re trying to save hk directly by this. Obviously boycotting some random company isn’t going to change the issues there, what’s going on here is about telling blizzard they can’t do what they want in the name of money. To say “this isn’t helping hk” is such a fucking stupid thing to say because of course it isn’t
---
Imagine being a rabid SJW
---
They did the job they could.  
---
Much like Blizzard, they were stuck in between a rock and a hard place. Once the issue blew up, they could either try to clamp down on the outrage and direct the furor at themselves or they could let it run rampant and completely derail the subreddit.  Neither choice is good, but they made one.
---
This right here is exactly why all this is so frustrating. The man in the live chat was super sure I was cheating, without explaining to me. If he was so sure he must have seen something on my account activity, and I realy want him to share this with me so I can defend myself.
---
I dunno, have you read some of these comments.
---
Exactly. PRC under Mao's leadership annexed Tibet in 1950, and caused the death of hundreds of thousands of Tibetans as well as destroyed most of Tibet's cultural heritage.
---
&gt; says the person that supports China taking away basic human rights from people in Hong Kong
---
You wanna point out where they said in their post where they said this? Because you're doing the stupid thing people like you normally do, which is assuming anyone that doesn't 100% agree with you is on the other extreme.
---
It doesn't feel bad now but thinking back, I can't remember a meta where warrior wasn't either annoying in their gameplay or power level or utterly useless. I don't think they've ever truly struck a satisfactory balance with warrior. Could be forgetting some time but it doesn't come to mind.
---
Dude ignore him, his account is a week old
---
Imagine being a mindless consumer
---
I would argue the decks you’re talking about are the ones that play themselves. Play your biggest minion every turn, take any value trades, go face if there aren’t any.  
---
The decks with big swing turns have to try and balance holding the appropriate cards to make that swing turn against not falling so far behind on board that the swing turn isn’t enough. See Quest Druid vs any aggro deck for an extreme example of this.
---
&gt; Poster didn't accuse you of supporting China
---
&gt;"says the person that supports China"
---
Can ya fuckin read?
---
Didn't say it was a good joke. The comma is just odd to see when you're not used to it.
---
I’ve watched it five times now and the moves look intentionally crafted to appear “non-cheating”
---
There’s no way to know you’re being genuine, OP. Because if someone on customer service at Blizzard is gonna be that callous, they have to have a good reason for it. Namely, if they screen gesture patterns.
---
More like insolent.
---
Yes, I have made some of those comments lol.
---
Hence my initial comment of needing a deck to burst them down, or to have spell burst instead, which is not common this meta. 
---
Spell hunter (slower version with emperor and no jepeto) is working out for me) with smaller burst potential but more board control.
---
Hit its weak point for MASSIVE DAMAGE
---
If you have video of this, you should send it to Trolden so he can finally play Crab Rave over something.
---
I... see...
---
&gt;Aggro decks also don't reliably beat the deck, otherwise it wouldn't have dominated professional play in such a manner.
---
Aggressive strategies since perhaps MSoG format hasn't been prevalent in professional play as the formats top level players play in encourage them to play the highest possible skill ceiling decks rather, which are almost always control and combo decks.
---
As just one recent example, despite all the ranking and raving over the strength Mech Hunter and Murloc Shaman during Shadows format, neither deck was brought often if at all to high level tournaments despite both consistently beating Conjurer's Mage variants.
---
I agree it was hard to navigate, specially with the amount of anger people had. It was good to let them vent and not create another free speech controversy
---
I was mildly disappointed but still like Jaina and Anduin. Only 200 wins on both to get them.
---
&gt; vs the entire government getting mad AND enacting foreign policy in retribution?
---
I'm confused, are you talking about China or Trump's tarriffs on China?
---
tl;dr I mean this is way too long
---
The differences is these European countries are heavily support by US to be able to say they can move on. Just like Japan was able to peacefully coexist with US and be their allied after they nuke them twice.
---
Look at world war 1 aftermath and how Germany resented Europe for treaty of Versailes which led to this conflict.
---
China is no different. It only been 42 years where they finally have stability in their country which was vital for them to become superpower. For 200 years straight they been shit on by the west and japan and suffered from instability (mostly from themselves but also because western nation weaken them through sphere of influence) so they do feel sense of legitimate anger
---
100% true. I'm not looking for people to post things like: F blizzard omg, or OP obvious cheater!! 
---
I am posting here for the people that have geniune tips or people that dealt with a similair situation. I just want my account back, since I love the game and I realy cant affort building another collection, and I can honestly tell I have never ever botted on this game.

Hey Szatan2000, unfortunately your submission has been removed because it contains little to no content. Posts must contain at least 50 characters. Please review the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/about/rules/), in particular our rules on [low effort content](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/wiki/rules).

Everytime I come into these threads I see more and more people defending blizzard and their actions, what the fuck is going on?
---
Oh ok. I didn't know that. Appreciate setting me straight.
---
Yeah, if you don't have 1 gorillion Karma on your reddit account you are a scammer and a fraud.
---
One correction- Taiwan/ROC does not have a "One China" policy, and they identify as completely independent from the PRC.
---
Every bot will have identifiable patterns.
---
The topic at hand is Blizzard censoring it's players at  tournaments, do you have an on topic thought to contribute? 
---
There is no knee jerk, I'm just trying to understand what your point is? Other companies suck more so stop talking about how shitty blizzard is?
---
I read this, but you cannot defend China.  You really just can't.  Governments that perform ethnic cleansing and build concentration camps or harvest people for organs are fucking evil.  End of story.
---
Like every counterargument is weighed against those actions.
---
I never played wow could anyone tell me why garrosh has old ones eye balls all over him?
---
"People are using their pesky freedom of speech to link our company to China's suppression of people's freedoms - what should we do?"
---
"Let's suppress more people's freedoms. There's no way that could backfire."
---
So which is it? Either you only need these simplistic combos, or you need a large collection.
---
I'm Taiwanese and i think the OP is spot on. As Taiwanese and having HK relatives, i know all too well how we have treated mainlanders. It's borderline racism, the way we try t constantly differentiate ourselves from them so we can get a pat on the head from mr white over in the west.
---
&gt; No man. It's a valid criticism.
---
It most definitely is not.
---
"Your efforts aren't enough to change anything" isn't valid criticism, it's what tyrants tell you when you're hurting them.
---
Naw, people love drama and anarchy. Even if they don't have a dog in the fight on an issue, they still want to see what all the commotion is about. 
---
I see less and less "new player looking for advice" posts on this subreddit than ever before.
---
10 wins for a straight 100 days on ladder is a cool challenge. You'd finish by January
---
Just because she isn't sexualized doesn't mean that is the reason.
---
Yep. EA and microtransactions are one thing, but no I'm not going to support a company that is literally pro-dictatorships.
---
Boycot littering! Spay and neuter your pets!
---
Take your whataboutism somewhere else.
---
What phone are you using? Other apps have been banning Hauwei devices recently.
---
I REALLY fucking hope Blizzcon is an absolute PR nightmare for them.
---
Do they know they are making it worse?
---
“You stopped supporting factory farming but since you’re not going full vegan you might as well just strangle a dog”
---
And the customers are free to not support companies who behave this way, they might not have actually violated free speech, but their action show where they stand when it comes to it.
---
Jermo#1153 on NA looking to trade 80g quests. Thanks!
---
I have too, but I'm not happy about it. I miss hearthstone :(
---
Who's the major of valuetown?
---
Except that organizing a boycott on this subreddit has already caused blizzard to partially reverse their decision so your point is pretty dumb
---
Believe it or not these posts are hitting the front page if you scroll down a bit. I’ve never played hearthstone, and yet here I am.
---
In the six shooter brawl, i used mill rogue and saw the never ending rope bug whenever i used coldlight oracle. I thought it had somethign to do with the deck refreshing, or at least a bug present only in tavern brawl. Apparently it exists in regular play as well.
---
Its really not as complex an issue as you're making it out to be, I see you have no problems commenting on the situation in the US, which is by and far more complex than some fat Chinese fuck banning Winnie the Pooh and some gamer/casters from their job.
---
Me too. Didn’t delete my account, but sent a ticket saying that I and others may reinstall if they completely reverse their decision.
---
I'd guess it's your cheating.
---
Target employs roughly half a million part time workers, your experience is probably a little more likely than you think.
---
Np, it’s all become very complicated since producers moved away from pay for the full game titles.
---
I swear I see more and more of these people defending them now, is it that hard to believe that a fat fucking idiot does fat fucking idiot things?
---

---
Free speech doesn't track location. It's a trait of society, so as long as you're free to say it in public and common spaces, then it's protected.
---
Weird that you would post it on Reddit then.
---
Why would you limit it to the executives?  Wouldn't that be a great power to give the whole team?
---

&gt;social justice warriors
---
I dont know what you mean by this why wouldnt you like social justice?
---
I have also been playing gods unchained, it is a pretty good game but if you want to spend money its much more expensive than hs. U do get a lot of packs for just playing the game
---
Quest Warrior throughout Year of the Raven was a good deck and I don't think anyone ever complained about it.
---
That's not a saying. Perhaps you are thinking of "the silent majority."
---
I haven't discouraged a single thing. It's just a fact. No one will do anything but stop playing a few games.
---
Sure, it's their events.  But they don't deserve to be beyond reproach for their actions.
---
I don’t have to. Glad this sub is back on track with some good old HS content!
---
ok cool its not a dictatorship its an authoritarian hellhole :)
---
Good luck with that, sport - are you new to gaming or something?  From your comment, I assume you literally never game, right?  Also, the word, ‘shill,’: I don’t think you actually know the meaning of this word and should cease its use immediately or risk further sullying of your perceived intelligence (already pretty low, admittedly).
---
They're more informed, which is good. However, all i see is people saying they've stopped playing, and in response people suggesting new games they can fucking play, as if that's the point.
---
Pretty weak argument my friend.
---
Maybe I'm biased from playing Yu-Gi-Oh as a kid, but I never thought the art was bad. This card is kind of meh though. I'll give you that lol.
---
I agree with a slap on the wrist ban for expressing a political issue.
---
I disagree with a severe ban for the expression of free speech.
---
I am disgusted by an American company self-censoring and called freedom of speech a divisive issue.
---
Blizzard could have clearly stated that they support freedom of speech but there are more appropriate channels other than Hearthstone, and Blitzchung's opinions do not represent the company's stance, but everyone can freely choose whether to disagree or agree with Blitzchung's. As long as Blizzard clearly stated that they support freedom of speech, they will be okay on my book.
---
I don't expect Blizzard to openly support Hong Kong, but as an American company, eagerly suppressing free speech and not showing any remorse is reprehensible for me. The key word here is eagerly. If it was an official request from China saying "ban the player or else" and Blizzard complied, I would have been sympathetic to Blizzard and not give them any flak as they were cohered to do so. Self-censoring just crosses the line.
---
U can play f2p and u get a lot of packs, also the packs u guy u can sell cards to buy other cards
---
This might come as a surprise to you, as it seems to be your default state, but I am not arguing. With you or anyone.
---
It was always there idiot, it's the protest not going away
---
hold up im about to end this mans whole career
---
***fallacy fallacy***
---
It’s like a Patches that merges with all Patches in your deck.
---
So you summon one 1/1, and the rest are pulled from your deck to make a massive minion equaling their total stats.
---
They remain in your deck forever. So for example, if you use Magic Mirror with Lazul, you now have 2 dogs in every run ever from now on.
---
You can keep adding dogs until you just have a massive deck of dogs, which you will draw one on turn 1, and then have a  1 mana 20/20+ charge.
---
It’s silly but so is every Tavern Brawl
---
Yea it seems to be pretty ignorant to claim China isn't as totalitarian as it seems then completely ignore how they are kidnapping ethnic minorities to harvest their organs or how they beat prisoners and brainwash them with comunistic propaganda.
---
What else are you boycotting then? And yeah companies can have some other company goals, but there's always a bottom line, and again, the company is not a living thing.
---
They need to name some kind of portrait or something for 500 or 1000 wins with a class in casual or something. I always play ranked until I hit Dad legend then call it quits. It doesn't have to look cool. It would just be nice to have something to show for it.
---
Oh ok. As long i don’t hear about it, it can continue of course.
---
You could sure, but with the chess timer for turns it would have to be really intuitive.  Especially because I don't know how it would work with blockers.
---
Right? This argument is so fucking ridiculous i kinda think they are trolling. Like people didnt care before because **blizzard didnt punish a player/casters this badly before**...but that doesnt matter for reasons i guess...?
---
First honest damn reply in this whole thread lol.
---
I agree but the last part idk if he ever tried lol but.... And overwatch is way worse than hearthstone imo so idk
---
Just admit that you aren't strong enough to cut the cord.
---
As far as I know, Blizz can ban anyone for any reason at any time (other than protected statuses). It is a part of the ToS you accept when you make a blizzard account. I remember numerous wow players being banned or suspended under this rule and have never heard of any kind of legal action against blizzard. It is a pretty typical part of a 'games as a service' model.
---
Does generate audience, though. People often chose what to play judging by the playerbase\what their peers are playing.
---
Not imploring you to stop unless you want to yourself, of course. Just giving another point of view.
---
Yeah because you can see it.  He's referring to the hidden oasis in the picture.
---
I don't really give a crap about your condescension. You wanna support Blizz, that's fine, but don't try to put down people who actually stand up for their principles.
---
it was a bug that gave you extra long turns. do we have to manual time our turns now?
---
That's some [big meaty claws](https://youtu.be/JzYMi5wSc7g)
---
You're leaving out the correct choice, which would be for Blizzard to publicly endorse the sovereignty of Hong Kong.
---
****Blizzard hurts itself in greed****
---
I'm guessing Blizzard cancelled it, both because the Nintendo store is a harter place to control the crowds at, and because a Japanese company like Nintendo is not going to be sympathetic to a Chinese cause.
---
&gt; Are you really trying to say that the boycott that was started after blizzard heavily punished a professional hearthstone player and several casters, is somehow not related to hearthstone? 
---
 
---
Yes.
---
&gt;red shirts and yellow/brownish pants to symbolize Winnie the Poo\[h\]
---
Fun Fact: There's something called "Disneybounding" that alot of adults do at the Disney theme parks. Your kid can show up at Disneyland dressed as a Disney princess, but you cannot. So what adults will do is wear clothes that matches the colors of the character they would want to cosplay as instead.
---
So basically, Disneybounding to troll the Chinese government.
---
You really do sound like a conspiracy nut. Just throwing it out there.
---
If it was minuscule to where nobody would notice then why are you talking about it?
---
Also, how do you explain all the times in the meta where one of the best decks was reasonably cheap to craft. You're talking a few % points, but that make or breaks Tier 1 decks. How did combo priest become the meta dominant deck for months? We have all the data on that too.
---
That was an interesting read but damn why am i not surprised its GW2... Arenanet is always a shitshow regarding their bans (more so than any other dev ive seen)
---
Again: Blizzard is political. See it how you want, but if the draw the line that is saying "Gender-Politics, LGBT-Community-Problems and celebrating a clearly controversial theme like Pride-Day is ok, fighting for Democracy is not!",  we go to dangerous times. It kind of makes me angry that so many people dont bother to research a thing - like Freedo from YourOverwatch. He didnt bother to look in to Blizzards political background. They. Are. Not. Neutral. Gender-Politics are a problematic issue one way or another for many people. But its ok for Blizzs pocket to sell rainbow armbands. Losing  money in china is not as it seems. But how is the fight for freedom in a political sense any different to the fight for free expression of your love?
---
So blizzards deserves every single bit of hate. And shouldnt be supported anymore. The lowering of the actions are no excuse.
---
&gt; reddit works by votes
---
There are still subreddit rules you have to follow, even if the majority decided to upvote something not related to the game it doesn't mean the mods should allow it, they have done a terrible job by not handling this situation.
---
Bum da dum da dum dum dum
---
Woww lucky you that you can get a wild card through arena. That's been always my dream!
---
Just play it. But don't purchase anything from them
---
But it makes no fucking sense. Warrior was never on the top since patron nerf. Hunter preveailed when Boom was unnerfed.
---
tbh I didnt even know it was a video lol or what deck of wonders was. Apologies! Reddit just displays it as a picture for me. Good on you
---
This is the same bullshit as people telling Colin kaepernick to protest “off the field”
---
No, this is where they have their biggest platform and will reach the most people. As a player they have the right to free speech and expression, blizzard is a fucking American company which should represent American values, not the values of an oppressive government
---
Oh bother
---
Checking everyday to see if he comes back, I loved the duos with Sottle. Still hoping ..
---
So if there is a good example of something wrong happening that ignites passions that weren't there before, suddenly that undermines those same ideas?
---
When did this weird edginess occur, like some virtue signaling poseur shit where you can't care about a problem unless you've always known about it? Stop being so fucking cynical and allow people to care about things, you fucking loser.
---
you know bots have made it to legend before right?
---
for him to have filled the board with hir'eek he had to have picked it up at some point. (barista or bog slosher)
---
If you watched him pick it up you had to expect that at some point he was going to replay it. 
---
If you hadn't seen him use both evolves yet, you had to assume he was going to replay it for evolve value because hi'reek is pretty bad otherwise.
---
there's not that many 9 drops in standard (15) - oondasta, krush, and mulchmuncher all let him beat your current hand and board as long as he got at least two of them. 
---
-&gt; you had a 49% chance to "lose" the game before this turn even started.
---
To be cancerous doesn't mean it literally causes cancer. You're being so pedantic.
---
To call something cancer as an adjective is to refer to it as a uncontrollable growth that is destructive in nature.
---
Blizzard - “Here I go digging again!”
---
Because the casters did nothing to keep the even focused on the game and that is litterally in their job discription... and they didnt get fired they recieved the same ban as blitzchung did.
---
Also the punishment that blitzhchung himself recieved is fine in my opinion. I agree however that the same 6 month ban for the casters is way too much. I think that should be like a week or 4-6.
---
Everyone keeps screaming that blizzard adjusted the punishment “only to save face” its human to make mistakes and at least they have the balls to own it and try to fix it.
---
To come back on the “no common sense” comment. That was ment for the people that just spout nonsense without even really following the whole story.
---
I hadn't actually heard of that video or theory before but the representations are incredibly accurate. I'm gonna have to search for it now. 
---
Not too sure how useful the staff would be at this point,  but it is curious how it all points in Nzoth in some way. Isn't he responsible for corrupting Deathwing?
---
I’m confused are you implying people from the EU don’t believe in free speech?  Is that really the stupid argument you are making?
---
BlizzCon is going to explosive this year.
---
all their games are engineered to be habit-forming. that's how the daily/weekly quest structure works. you get little rewards for being obedient and loyal to the routine.
---
Sure I thought blizzard's primary motivations were to make money. I would also consider an important motivation for most businesses would be public reputation, which is maintained by having a code of ethics, and values as a company. Blizzard is directly going against their own stated company values.
---
They danced around the issue of freedom of speech. They addressed the part of Hearthstone is not a political venue, but never said out loud the phrase "freedom of speech". They used the wording "every voice matters" and only portrayed it as their company value. "Every voice matters" as a company value can be easily received as simply listening to your customers, and not a sincere statement about supporting free speech as a human right.
---
There is no evidence that the randomness in this game is rigged.
---
It’s well known blizzard and other game companies pay people to give them positive PR on Reddit
---
I've always preferred that TB was mostly calm and persuasive, so when he went on a rant it was meaningful. I like Jim, but all he does is rant, whether it's a serious rant or hyperbole, so it lessens the impact.
---
Western media companies want to sell clicks.
---
They know that "LIBERATE HK FROM CHINA!!!1 RIOTS IN DA STREET" gets more clicks than "Mostly peaceful protests occuring over modest reforms and civil protections in HK". So that's the version they go with. Western media is incredibly dumb and one sided when it comes to covering issues outside the west.
---
Nothing, as soon as you allow him to roll with deathrattles it's usually over unless you have very powerful answers. Looking at the game state you got unlucky - he had both Feugen and Stalagg extremely fast, but looking at your hand you also drafted bad deck, lots of expensive low tempo cards.
---
I said they are becoming more capitalist in order to reach the communist ideal. I never said they were a dictatorship. Do you understand what the powers of the Chinese president include?
---
You are trying to hold three ideas in your post
---
1. Blizzard isn't the worst company to play in China
---
2. Companies should punish people for free speech
---
3. Playing video games makes everyone's ideas meaningless forever
---
One, it's not about who the worst is, the fact that people are opening their eyes to human rights crisis is important. 
---
Two, fuck Blizzard and fuck capitalism and fuck you for agreeing with censorship just because you like blizzard games.
---
Three, you're a giant hypocrite for bitching about what people get passionate over, you're in a hearthstone reddit defending your favorite video game company like a fanboy.
---
But why does blizzard have to say that? I haven’t heard any other companies say it? If that is the thing thats is so important to you, i’m sure you dont have a fun life...
---
Hate speech is hating someone because of something they cannot control such as Gender, Sexuality or Race. Jim is basing his opinion on the actions of the people he is criticising.
---
Explain the difference between Xi Jinping and an actual dictator. I'll wait.
---
That's total nonsense lol! There's no law on emotions. You don't get to control my mind. My thoughts. Or my voice. If I call you a cunt and you get upset that's your problem. You could just as easily call me one. Speech is free as in anyone can say what they want and noone can stop it. Like I just did. Unless YOU deny that with censorship.
---
Reddit comments are now the equivalent of analyzing texts in school? Ok man whatever.  
---
No one said it was a bad thing.
---
Imagine calling people protesting human rights abuses “outrage culture”. People like you are a real plague to our society
---
Well, what did you expected when you picked him? It is Dadghar after all!
---
Calling out reddit because they "missinterpreted" Blizzards actions is silly. It was obvious to pretty much *everyone* (including Blizzard employees) what Blizzards true intentions were: appeasing China
---
When you load up Hearthstone after shutting it down for awhile, does it load back into that match? If so, exit the game, wait 15+ minutes, load it up, hit cancel when it starts to load up the match (which will shut down the game). Wait another 15+ minutes and do it one more time. Wait a bit and start up the game and it should just load you into the main menu. Not sure if this will work on mobile, but it should work on desktop.
---
I’m getting 46.666667%.
---
Yeah I did that a few times! Not sure how to feel about it tbh...
---
Uh. I think people are upset because it wasn't "very clearly". But I do sympathize with not wanting to break up with something important in your life. I just wish you wouldn't downplay the significance of this issue to do so.
---
Fantastic comment. Thank you.
---

---
Highly doubt this too. You can't just have 99% censorship and 1% of people in your country free to think and see whatever they want. Information control is all or nothing. One leak and the entire system is useless.
---
So you can bet Hong Kongers will eventually be integrated into the CCP's authoritarian way of life. China is just taking it slow right now. Raise the temperature one degree at a time and the crab will never realize it is being cooked.
---
They used the old portrait? LOL
---
I know I am enjoying Hearthstone! Love the meta and got some nice leggo’s from the 2 bundles!
---
I didn't delete my account but still hate blizzard
---
A question for those people claiming most people who deleted their accounts are regretting it --- how do you know? Did you ask most of them? Did you take a poll? Ask around? Genuinely curious.
---
Imagine complaining about "slacktivists" but you can't even be bothered to check out the post to see it was a joke lmfao
---
Love it!
---
There are different sorts of elites though. Not necessarily financial - science, industry, art, sport - all of them have their elites - and that is not something you can easily inherit if you can at all. 
---
And to what lengths are you willing to go for such 'equal opportunity'. Say, look at NBA - how are you going to give short people equal opportunity at joining NBA?
---
Might take a look at yourself first. Riot is a perfectly acceptable term.
---
Lol I definitely responded to the wrong comment and do understand yours. Do not go out in brown face or yellow face folks!
---
Upvoted!
---
And yet Activision, EA, Konami, Gearbox, Nintendo, 2K Games, and BioWare are each still selling millions of new games, often sequels, every year despite the controversies surrounding them
---
Many of those game you list too also sold millions.
---
Queue all the guys claiming some exaggerated number of people will be like this.
---
Yes yes you're a wehraboo and you want to signal to other white supremacists who you are.
---
&gt;If that is the thing thats is so important to you, i’m sure you dont have a fun life
---
What is up with all the blizzard apologists constantly insulting others?
---
r/Politics is far left lol
---
I am going to feel really pissed when I buy packs next time.
---
What did they "get away with"? They took a major PR hit, probably lost hundreds of thousands of dollars future profits and will probably have one of their most important advertising event (Blizzcon) marred by this.
---
Yeah holy shit, -6K
---
Wise words from Tyrion. Don't let corporate brown-nosers silence your message.
---
Their job is to moderate this subreddit...to provide room for discussion without destroying the integrity of the forum.
---
They did not do that last week.  There were reposts everywhere, toxicity spewing left and right.  It was a disaster in here, and I'm not surprised to see some fallout.
---
Sorry, but a mod whose been part of this community since it's inception deciding to leave should be part of of this community.  Nor is mods deleting the posts within minutes in any way a representation of the community's will.
---
The /nintendo mods are actually fine with it. It's specifically the NintendoSwitch reddit that is acting wrong.
---
I couldn't agree less with censorship, thanks, i just think acting like Blizzard is a downright human rights adversary because it has rules for it's stream is a bit weird. If it was Twitter, or reddit, or on the street where he got banned for his speech, that's another issue, but on a broadcast for a gaming tournament? He can't, (and apparently personally doesn't), complain about what happened.
---
And the fanboy argument isn't really an argument now is it? I've barely defended them at all, bar saying i think it's more complicated than 'lul blizz hates free speech and bows to ChInA'.
---
Did you play shudderwock? I played it while Best Friends Forever was on the board and it ate them... They disappeared after that
---
Yeah, yeah that's great but is there actually a bot for mobile version?
---
The reason that those negative, regressive voices have been silenced is because culture has moved forward with the "SJW" crowd at the helm.
---
That the word was ever viewed as a pejorative was simply a result of a constant barrage of attacks by those same regressive people.
---
&gt;Everyone keeps screaming that blizzard adjusted the punishment “only to save face” its human to make mistakes and at least they have the balls to own it and try to fix it.
---
No, They are fixing it because too many people are upset and the bad PR may end up in lost revenue. This isn't about having balls this is purely about money. A company did something people dont agree with and they are upset.
---
&gt;To come back on the “no common sense” comment. That was ment for the people that just spout nonsense without even really following the whole story.
---
Yeah and your other messages insulting people for not agreeing with you is all memes too. Sure thing bud.
---
~Written from your iphone
---
I appreciate the post, but I think you are more brainwashed by the totalitarian government than you realize. The concentration camps are not a myth. The organ harvesting isn't a myth. Governments do not hide information about the rest of the world from its citizens to protect them, they do it to protect themselves. The violence the Hong Kong citizens are subjected to for not wanting to become part of that system is real. If millions of people are united in resisting a change that is being forced upon them, what right does the Chinese government have to physically impose its will?
---
The gaming community doesn't have a problem with Chinese people, but right now it has a big problem with the Chinese Government and the way it wields its power. For me, it is about more than just the fate of those in Hong Kong, even if China is right about that issue and that those in Hong Kong should belong to their system no matter what, the way that they are wielding their economic influence to silence the free speech of their opponents around the world is a problem.
---
You aren't blind to the sins of your government, but you don't have a full grasp on them either
---
I have been playing Shadowverse too, it seems to be somewhat good enough to fill the void at least for me. I'd even argue the class core mechanics are better designed as each has their core theme that they stick to
---
When your done white-knighting and verbally jerking yourself off, maybe go take a look at some of my other posts in this sub where I've condemned Blizzard for this myself. The issue is now, it's trendy now for clowns like yourself to shit on Blizzard and virtue signal about it any chance you get, when you wouldn't have given two-shits otherwise. Sounds like you should pop a couple of Midols and take a nap.
---
Really. A person like me, specifically, is slowing things down. Very interesting argument, or not. 
---
Then again, in a subreddit where if you don't tow the line on the ' Blizzard is a human rights abusing company and they need to be boycotted and die' argument, you're mass downvoted, i'm not surprised.
---
ironic post
---
Imagine thinking people aren't requesting their accounts back in droves because a post was a joke. Imagine assuming I didn't bother to check. Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try.
---
They switched to this policy immediately after American University appeared with Pro Hong Kong messaging. 
---
They’re continuing it this week.
---
Have they also lied to and insulted their fanbases?

There's more to this outrage than those standing with Hong Kong.

Still playing Hearthstone single player, but they won't get another cent from me so I'm technically a net negative for the company.
---
Ban waves do happen, you could easily get banned for stuff you did 6 months ago lmao.
---
Better to show the game you cheated in, methinx...
---
No, it's not. You know it's not. You know that when you change words, it changes the meaning of a sentence. You know what someone means when they put a word in sarcasm quotes.
---
You are acting very "intelligent" right now.
---
I guarantee you know what I meant. You can read past the surface level of a text just fine. You're just pretending that you cannot. I don't expect validation - just, ffs, hold yourself to a better standard of argument.
---
It is not pedantic. It is an important distinction. China is communist not a dictatorship.
---
That makes sense. Weapons do use Attack, which was set to 1, but not Health and instead Durability. Which remains 2.
---
If things are 100% subjective, perhaps the new paladin portrait should be wearing a clown wig and a big red nose, or maybe we could paint warrior up like a mime. After all, taste is subjective and so those portraits must be just as good as others. No one would be forced to use them so I guess everything would be fine.
---
They get prosecuted for being suspected of engaging in separatist movement, which is actually pretty big, conducted quite a few terrorist attack on han Chinese within and outside the region. Since Chinese government don't operate with assumption of innocence they just preemptively arrest anyone remotely suspicious (hence why Hong Kong people are so afraid of the extradition law). As for organ harvesting it's not really a punishment for disobedience or a threat to others (it is censored in all Chinese media which defeat that purpose) but rather how China satisfy it's demand for organs with low rate of organ donation due to local burial culture. They just harvest organs from any people the public don't care about ( usually death row prisoners or in this case, disobedient minority or cult members)  CCP isn't a some evil mastermind coming up with intricate ways to subjugate it's people, just a government that doesn't give a shit about human right
---
With Titan stuff?
---
Blizzard has a controversial software that runs in the background on PCs called “warden”. This software will report on what other software is running simultaneously to their games on your machine or what software if even installed. Had nothing to do whatsoever with the clicks and all that stuff.
---
And it's how they see it because of the massive propaganda machine. HK is not in rebellion. They're protesting.
---
So people ask for one thing, get it then ask for another.
---
We are all taking this too far and overthinking simple rules. And just a simple fyi bro China has been communist for as long as I remember.
---
 "AlL oF a SuDdEN" the issue isn't about hearthstone, free speech, but about China? Or what is it. The issue keeps changing. What do you kids fucking want.
---
I am not dismissing the topic, only to point out why posts like yours fall onto deaf ears of those who participate in that system. Unfortunately we living outside of china have very little power to affect what happens within that country. To really make a difference this message needs to be heard by those living in china. And to a lot of them, it sounds like hypocrisy.
---
Blizzard making their own choice is different than tournament players randomly deciding what cause to champion.
---
Kun -&gt; Kong -&gt; Hong Kong
---
You didn't pay them to *not* ban you -&gt; freeloader -&gt; free
---
Checks out. You brought this on your self for being so politically inflammatory, really
---
Man Khartut's return sure was exciting
---
/s
---
Probably because you're posting content not about Hearthstone on the Hearthstone subreddit. Hearthstone, the card game, you know? Hell you made an account dedicated to this thing
---
You are saying that in a game where Sir Annoy-o exists. 
---
There are some people who would want something like that.
---
Yeah very true , not sure why its summoned or equip though seen as it say summon a deathrattle minion
---
This is very biased and sort of condescending lol
---
Is every shaman a murloc shaman bro? What's up your ass
---
One more board of Kartut Defenders and I’m going to commit concede irl.
---
Why is it garbage though?
---
Great, so your message is saying 1.3 billion people are complicit in these vile deeds. Who are you trying to convince? I'm pretty sure everyone here either supports HK or very sympathetic to HK.
---
No problem
---
You're the one operating on the premise that criticizing Mark Kern is the same as siding with China.
---
Nice, yea i did it with best friends and hagatha. Ill try Lazul.
---
我知道他是美国国籍，我的话没有错. My mandarin is shitty so I'm just going to reply in english-you KNOW that's not the whole story, also stop misinterpreting what I said. I can't tell if you actually believe you're right or if you're just reiterating CCP propaganda; NO FUCKING DUH HE WAS NOT A CHINESE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. YES, I KNOW HE WAS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. THAT'S LITERALLY THE FUCKING REASON WHY HE WAS RECRUITED INTO THE [THOUSAND TALENTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Talents_Program) PROGRAM. THEIR WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO RECRUIT OVERSEAS CHINESE EXPERTS, WHETHER THEY WERE FOREIGN OR NOT. I'm not going to spend any more time replying to a CCP apologist/shill. Bye. 不是我,是你是妈个蛋
---
Tablet it would be fine.  But phone is what people mean.
---
Just play Highlander rogue. I've used zephrys 4 times in a game once. With a shadow step, discovered shadow step, waggle pick, and priest cloning device. I call it a miracle rogue and it's nuts. Has potential to beat every deck but isn't consistent enough
---
Maybe you should have a history check and look at the relationship with communism and dictatorship one more time.
---
I don't completely agree that only people inside China can make a difference. You have to look at what motivates those in power, it is money. If we boycott China and any company that helps them commit these atrocities or cover them up, then we are pressuring them to stop butchering people. Right now the money they make from organ harvesting is more than they lose from people not boycotting. If the economy is affected they people in power lose, so they may reconsider behaving less cravenly. The ones in power will still be evil, but every life that can be spared in the future is worth it. First save lives as much as possible.

**Thousand Talents Program**
---
The Thousand Talents Plan (Chinese: 千人计划; pinyin: Qiān rén jìhuà) or Thousand Talents Program (Chinese: 海外高层次人才引进计划; pinyin: Hǎiwài gāo céngcì réncái yǐnjìn jìhuà) was established in 2008 by the central government of China to recognize and recruit leading international experts in scientific research, innovation, and entrepreneurship. The program was further elevated in 2010 to become the top-level award given through China’s National Talent Development Plan, a plan that was conceived jointly by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council of the People's Republic of China in 2010 to strengthen innovation and international competitiveness within China.1000 Talent Plan professorship is the highest academic honor awarded by the State Council, analogous to the top-level award given by the Ministry of Education (People's Republic of China). The program includes two mechanisms: resources for permanent recruitment into Chinese academia, and resources for short-term appointments that typically target international experts who have full-time employment at a leading international university or research laboratory.The program has three categories:
---
Innovative 1000 Talents plan (Long term / Short term) - for Chinese scholars below 55 years of ageForeign 1000 Talents plan (Long term / Short term) - for foreigners only below 55 years of ageYoung scholar 1000 Talents plan or Overseas Young Talents Project of China- for those below 40 years of ageThe program has been praised for recruiting top international talent to China, but also criticized for being ineffective at retaining the talent.  An unclassified U.S. National Intelligence Council analysis highlights that the program threatens the U.S.'s economic base by enabling technology transfer to China.

just watch the HS replay and it'll tell you?

Or maybe we always thought the outrage was stupid trendy bullshit and have been waiting for people to untwist their panties over it.
---
&gt; I've got a hsreplay in case anyone is interested..
---
Aight I wanna take a look
---
Never heard of him.  What, did they ban him for supporting a tyrannical regime or something?
---
It means that you have a bot play the game for you. It is generally used to either progress yourself through the game or to gather items so that you can sell them for real money. In Hearthstone you could use a bot to get you to legend or to win 30 matches a day for 100 extra gold.
---

---
FYI, the Uighurs are also being used for organs.  
---
The Chinese government is KNOWN for lying, so I don't trust their version of "they were separatists". I doubt all the people being held in camps were even close to involved.
---
&gt;No one would be forced to use them so I guess everything would be fine.
---
I mean, yes. It would be fine lol.
---
Lol yea the astroturfers, that’s it, collecting those big bucks from someone somewhere to post in a Hearthstone subreddit.
---
Playing against bomb warrior is about as fun and interactive as playing against cw.
---
I see. Good for you for taking the extra step, I guess.
---
Lot of different ways this could happen. If you have a HS replay you should just link it
---
 I like it, but if people can figure out something better then go for it
---
For any and all of the reasons in the post
---
Fist off, I'm not sure where you're getting “I don’t support X (Blizz) because they had a PR move that was pro Y (China) so I’m going to boycott X (Blizz) and give my money directly to Y (China)" from what I was saying.
---
League of Legends, as you might know, is a Free to Play game, and while playing an F2P game is an important part of their income model (it needs a decent population to attract enough paying players), I'm definitely not actively forking over money. Secondly, I suggested non-HearthStone games in a similar vein, and admitted I was not pleased to learn of Tencent's involvement with League of Legends.
---
Because those reviews and comments were defamation. Statements like those with actual names and numbers of people saying them attached would lead to fines, jail time, and possibly prison. You cannot slander someone's name like that just because you do not like something, especially if you don't know jack shit about what's going on in the world.
---
Lol absolute bullshit, the only people brigading this sub and spewing lies are HK protesters and political people acting like they ever even played this game.
---
“Wahh everyone who disagrees with me must be a paid shill.”
---
Which is why that’s not the portrait for 1000 shaman wins. If this was just a random Valeera skin not tied to an achievement it would be different
---
Did I refute that claim in my comment? Read the whole thing please
---
You are the only one claiming that 1.3 billion people support the Chinese government. That is your wet dream, not reality. The reality is that a VERY VERY small minority support the government and these atrocities, the majority live in fear.  
---
If 1.3 billion people were on reddit, the site would crash.
---
There’s a group that wants a return to “normalcy”, they are very vocal
---
I agree, and imo in general it matters more for the 1000w skins to look epic than to look different. Even just to change the posture with some more epic-looking coloring will satisfy me.
---
I don’t care for that portrait either. I hate it, in fact, but it’s at least not tied to an achievement
---
It only takes one to decide to make a splash for big media attention.  It’s a pretty free way to get 15 minutes of fame.
---
That's awesome dude, see you at blizzcon
---
and your source on this is..... where exactly?
---
It is oddly put but your wording is different. Normally it's simply "Discover a minion." but if say Northshire Cleric died then you have 2  random options and then Northsire Cleric. If 3 or more died that turn then I would assume it no longer pulls from the random minion pool and only from the "minions that died this turn" pool.
---
With your wording it's completely useless unless something had died.
---
Probably because if you do research into the competition basically all of them are in the same boat. Epic and some small publishers are the only companies that have explicitly come out in support of political speech at tournaments. Epic has its own PR issues with their launcher and corporate burnout. The rest of them are either explicitly making rules to prevent that type of speech, or are coasting by with their fingers crossed that they don’t have to address it.
---
They reduced the penalties, which is what a good number of people originally complained about, so I’m guessing some people are satisfied enough.
---
It's been put on hold, but withdrawn would mean to reject any possibility of it being discussed or amended and enacted in the future. Some say the ambiguity provided by the phrasing in put on hold, let's the HK government save face for both sides, much like Blizzard tried to do. 
---
Philip de Franco on YouTube has been covering the stories well before NBA and Blizzard scandals, and explains the whole situation and background of it extremely well. Most videos where he updates the Hong Kong story will link back to the original coverage.
---
Literally none, it’s a fad to get attention and show off how hip and woke you are.
---
Protesters are bad for business regardless of what their protesting.
---
That's why Walmart caves to overzealous parents on the video game ordeals without so much as a fight.
---
While I cant be sure, I think the employees are getting the death threats, not the general concept of Blizzard.
---
In that case thank God the 1000 win rogue skin is a Cap'n not a pirate.
---
How did you manage to miss the odd pala/rogue decks that consumed the meta?
---
Do you want a trophy for that title?
---
Every movement accrues pushback over time. Some people legit just like to argue to be different. Makes em feel unique.
---
I really hope not :(
---
That's what security is for. If we cancelled every public event because something bad might happen it would be a very boring world.
---
Not edited btw, that was a glich.
---
Blizzard punished Blitz/casters for the content of the message though, not the act of making a generic political statement. 
---
Riot hasn't done that (yet, I think).
---
Riot, completely owned by China.  Yep let’s boycott Blizzard, an almost completely American owned company, to play more games by Riot.
---
Only good ones are priest, shaman, warlock and to some degree mage. The rest are pure atrocity that looks absolute shit compared to their 500 wins counterparts.
---
Blizzard has a weird hard-on for pairing Pirates with Rogues since WoW: Legion. I personally find it completely forced.
---
It's useful when you have a really well working deck and adding any more cards would dilute it.
---
some of those are arena wins where my winrate is around 73%. For ladder 60% is quite weak too. Also 10 min. average is too high for rogue. But you're right it's shit ton of a time, I was playing HS since the very 1st day mostly on rogue so you can imagine getting pirate skin is quite disappointing.
---
\^ This guy gets it  
---
I don't have an issue with Blizzard not liking its grandmaster players and shoutcasters going off on tangents during officially sanctioned events and streams. It's the actual reaction that I had a problem with.  
---
Think heavily on this - Blizzard spent SO long on trying to convince its fans, investors, and the public at large that it wants to have eSports seen and respected just as much as regular, traditional sports. Mike Morhaime wanted combines, contracts, tryouts, benefits, guaranteed salaries.   
---
But most regular sports - the MLB, NHL, NBA, NFL and more - they all have player associations and have unionized to protect their players. eSports has NO such thing and as such are privvy to the whims of their corporate sponsors. Think about Colin Kaepernick - he took a knee during the national anthem and shit went off the rails. That's quite an extreme example, but you can start to see parallels here. Both players used their freedom of expression to make a statement during an official event, and both were punished heavily for it. And oddly enough, in both instances the focus was misplaced (Colin on him "being against America or the flag" and with Blitz about "Freedom of speech" - it is about neither of these things in either scenario)  
---
6 month ban. Do you know what it takes for you to get a 6 month ban in traditional sports?  
---
[https://www.nhl.com/news/sharks-torres-apologizes-for-hit-on-ducks-silfverberg/c-782363](https://www.nhl.com/news/sharks-torres-apologizes-for-hit-on-ducks-silfverberg/c-782363)  
---
It takes repeated, targeted hits to the head resulting in serious injuries of players over a few years with multiple previous suspensions to earn a 6 month ban for a single event in Hockey.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Why does Blizzard \*say\* they want eSports to be treated like regular sports, but then doesn't act like it?
---
For your information: Valeera's 1K win portrait has nothing to do with Halloween. It's not a temporal/event skin; it's permanent.  Also, nobody here is talking about the China incident, and I personally have never done that either. So, please, don't reply to me regarding that subject.
---
Slap him into battlecry shaman and you have UNLIMITED perfect cards!
---
By accepting the research as it is, it shows that the research based off organ harvesting has value. By banning it or dismissing it, we make it clear that the outside world doesn't value contributions of that nature, preventing collaboration, and hopefully devaluing that kind of research. If it proves to no longer be profitable or beneficial, perhaps they will stop doing it (unlikely, I will admit).
---
But then further, there is a huge debate as to whether this kind of research is morally acceptable to build from. The phrase 'standing on the shoulders of giants' comes to mind, a reference to the constant development from a foundation of science. But if some of that science came from literal murder... can a person derive pleasure in improving from that point in the modern age?
---
A comparable moral quandary is the modern understanding of frostbite which (if I've been informed correctly over the years) comes from researchers within the Nazi regime, and had... similar moral issues, to put it lightly. The information found is important, but we would never want to encourage further discoveries found in a similar manner.  
---
p.s. I'm a total layman, and might be horrifically wrong.
---
Pretty much want to scream the Gladiator meme: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
---
Turns out, that's all people care about.
---
Interesting take. I try to avoid thinking like that because I don’t want to absolve myself from working for progress in my neck of the woods. The perspective this gave me was to see the depths unchecked power can sink to.
---
Thanks. This is not a decision I made lightly.
---
I love hearthstone and I miss playing it.
---
But do you know what's not important than my enjoyment of a video game? Human rights.
---
Can't wait for the brawl to end so I don't have to see this post anymore.
---
What part of 'empty' is so confusing to people?
---
What is the reward anyway? Unless it's really good, I wouldn't bother...
---
It seems after a few mods left, the remaining ones are now pro-censorship. Many reminder posts are getting removed
---
You can't prove your innocence, or defend there is nothing you could say that they would trust over what they already collected on you. As I said your only hope is that it was mistake and somebody from Blizzard actually find it out but spamming support will not help, you will get ignored.
---
Duck season! FIRE!
---
Ow well, you made it to legend, so you finished the game anyways.
---
Conservatism in gaming is extremely recent, and seems to have coincided with the uptick in extreme left-wing writers being hired by major game news sites, and frequent articles complaining about sexuality in primarily Japanese games.
---
Of course, historically, conservative activists like Jack Thompson have been a far bigger threat to games, though that tends to be focused more on violence rather than sexuality.
---
Conservatives in gaming seem to be borne out of the false impression that calls for censorship don’t come from all sides.
---
And Gen Z doesn’t look very conservative at all. https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/01/17/generation-z-looks-a-lot-like-millennials-on-key-social-and-political-issues/
---
I'd be very surprised to see a Mage cycling a Druid spell.
---
I haven't played Hearthstone actively in a few years, but damn if I don't miss Classic WoW. But fuck Blizzard.
---
I think they were published in Western science journals, and those journals dont want to be seen as tacitly endorsing organ harvesting by hosting those studies in their journal. It's more of an ethical rejection than a scientific one, but this would be true of *any* scientific paper that violated ethics--if you did a study on mice but did not follow ethical guidelines, your paper wouldnt be published either.
---
Made it to legend many times, still enjoyed the game
---
Which is why it's not in the pool of available cards.
---
Cool, but unlike Blizzard they have zero to lose in supporting Hong Kong protests.

Spam taunts until you get an RNG hero power? Ofc people complained.

Not only was the win condition bullshit, it was all just so *boring.* Even to play.
---
A trait of what society? Historically speaking, freedom of speech is pretty new (or at least *rare*) while societies stretch back a few thousand years.
---
&gt; If someone came up to me individually and said a bunch of harrasing remarks, then a fight wouldn't be restricting freedom of speech. They were always free to say it, as shown in the first example.
---
Actually it's not, which is exactly why we have harassment laws, conduct laws, defamation laws, slander/libel laws, hate speech laws, and so on. There are many parts of this which you're ignoring.
---
Now granted, not all of those things are always *enforced*, because in most cases it simply isn't a big enough deal to bother doing so, but saying that people are free to say whatever they want to you is **unequivocally false**.
---
Please who ever is going to blizzcon destroy it to the ground with protesting

---
Fake white knights still playing Hongkong game
---
I just want her to have a black outfit with a black bandanna around her mouth. I want a sneaky girl
---
And you seem to be missing the point that I never argued with the idea of freedom of speech, what I argued is that it gives you the right to say what you want without consequence, and it *does not*.
---
Article 19 of the ICCPR even clearly states that the exercise of the right of freedom of speech carries "special duties and responsibilities" and may "therefore be subject to certain restrictions" when necessary "[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others" or "[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals".
---
Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, **may not** be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that: "the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."
---
-
---
I don't know why you keep arguing this, because at this point you're just seem to be argumentative. Nobody said freedom of speech or expression doesn't exist; what was said was that A) without laws to back it up, it's meaningless (see: China), and B) it does not and has never give you free licence to say whatever you'd like without consequence, whether that consequence be social, political, physical, business, or otherwise. Your only legal protection is against the government infringing on that right (see: first amendment), which is why businesses can fire employees over their opinions or conduct (depending on circumstance), Reddit can ban you, Blizzard can ban you, and other people can tell you to fuck off.
---
For example: I'm seriously tired of this conversation going in circles, so if you don't have anything useful to say, please go exercise your freedom elsewhere, or else I'm going to block you and there's not a goddamn thing you can do about it. Good day.
---
That’s the point of the rule tho... it has to be broad so it can catch all of them not just ones say bother you or someone else. It’s a catch all so both part X and Y can be covered even though they’re on two different sides of the coin. 
---
It also keeps blizzard from being pulled into a side of an issue- wether you want to act as if punishing him makes them choose a side or not is on you- I know I don’t wanna be dragged into a conflict by any Joe Shmoe who attended my tournament.
---
Bye who cares

Is there any super concrete metric to point at or is it subjective to some degree?

Eh, her outfit is heavily inspired by Bloodfang, but not exactly it. Either way, there are a lot of iconic rogue sets that would suit her.

Its far worse than you can imagine.  A middle ranked captain was known to have committed suicide after witnessing the barbarity he helped to muster.

You could cycle it 4 times at 10 mana, which is a combo that is still weaker than Ultimate Infestation on its own.
---
You could cycle more if Auctioneer sticks, but you have to worry about full hand, and decks would start including 4 damage removal if Auctioneer became popular again.
---
It's strong, but it's okay to print strong cards and idk if it's more busted than many other cards which have been printed in the past.
---
I’m very curious to how many companies out there are just keeping quiet hoping no one calls them out or drags them into this having them have to choose a side so to speak.
---
This isn't about Hong Kong being freed as it was. We know the history. We are not apologetic towards the British Empire. We do not support colonialism. We condemn the opium wars. This is not what this is about.  
---
This is all about the people versus a dictatorship. We support Hong Kong and their cries to be free, not because we thought they were free to begin with, but because we wish them to be free now. If the people of Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chongqing or any other city or area would protest for their freedom we would stand with them as well. The same goes for Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Brunei, Egypt, Russia; you name it. In the face of oppression we will always support those who wish to be free.  
---
Human rights are not subject to cultural relativism. Human rights are not negotiable. Whenever and wherever someone is oppressed for their sexuality, their religion, for speaking out against their leader, for being born a certain color or of a certain cultural group, we will stand with them.  
---
There is no excuse. There is no history that can justify oppression. There is no cultural difference that will make us turn a blind eye to it.  
---
We don't stand with a country or a culture. We stand with the people. The people deserves to be free.
---
Who cares 🤷🏼‍♂️ bye fake white knight
---
Can't have ethnic problems if there are no ethnics
---
Because social justice warriors is usually used as a derogatory term. It's not bad per say, but involves people who are PC to the extreme while going around the internet thumping their chests on social issues with a sense of superiority and general unpleasantness. At least that is what it used to mean. I have a feeling we're moving past this though as more people are waking up to the very, very real social issues that are threatening our entire existence on this planet.

Why is Valeera, a rogue, becoming a pirate that much of a stretch to begin with?
---
Oof, did not know that. This is why I usually avoid Twitter.
