This seems pretty bad, this will almost always die instantly and a 7 mana 1/7 with Battlecry: Fill your board with 1/1s is horrible.

While not as powerful as Valanyr, the ability to chain this effect from Dragon to Dragon should be helpful.

Rank 5 floor is also a bunch of memes, since most entertaining players drop back to floor instead of going legend because of the ridiculous queue times.

played a lot of auto chess when it came out, honestly to me the HS version looks too simple. Well, I haven't tried it so I can't fully judge, but it doesn't get me excited in the least.

Hmm, Dragon pally has some nice tools. Worth carrying Nozudurmo the Timeless till turn 8,9,10 if he catches the deathrattle?

Spend some money on it then.

If you both don't want to play the game or spend any money on it then not many people are going to care that you get one less hero to choose from.
---
1 attack wtf is that?
---
Is there anything this combos with?  The only thing I can think of is Knife Juggler, but you'd have to have no other minions or any form of card draw to make this worth it.

Potentially decent as a finisher in token decks, combined with [[Soul of the Murloc]], [[Soul of the Forest]], or [[Call of the Wild]], but pretty damn clunky.
---
Seven mana for 7/13 worth of doesn't seem terrible on its own. 
---
The 1/7 body may be fairly easy to deal with, but the card looks like it can snowball if it isn't.

This won't instantly win games if the dragon it buffs is a high-cost one.

---
I hate the 30 second late game turns on mobile, which are more like 20, since clicking, doing stuff is also slower. Would love to get at least 50 seconds.
---
I'm sure the downvote was from a mod.
---
but token decks have cheaper or better swarm options than this card
---
The reason why that happened is because the most recent patch was server-side, which they can implement quickly.
---
The bigger client-side patches take a while to implement since they have to go through QA and stuff.
---
So you want a static game where once the meta is defined that‚Äôs it? People are playing WoW classic to replay things they‚Äôve already done or haven‚Äôt done. It‚Äôs nostalgia and also a less overwhelming world.  In WoW it‚Äôs really about completing things alone or with people you know than it is about competing with others.
---
Hearthstone is a card game, Magic is a card game. Card games are competitive and will always have a meta that becomes more defined the more it is played. Which means things that developers and play testers didn‚Äôt notice will become more apparent as time goes on.
---
Wizards of the Coast banned Oko and admitted that he was a mistake and was creating a bad meta. But they mentioned that they were still going to make powerful cards and release them. This is because a card game is more fun when you have impactful cards to play, which is why there‚Äôs always new strong cards being added to every card game (that hasn‚Äôt died).
---
In the case of Hearthstone RNG has always been a base mechanic. It‚Äôs what balances some cards like Deadly Shot. This was because Blizzard finds RNG to make more fun casual matches and more exciting high level games to watch. Yes it has its issues but it‚Äôs a core detail of the game.
---
While I agree the current state of Constructed Hearthstone needs work, I know that ‚ÄúVanilla HS‚Äù will not fix any issues. Although it can work fine as a brawl on the occasion.
---
End my suffering plz
---
[deleted]
---
It has a lot more control on the outcome than others. Thats why i say better. May be stretching it by calling it the best but the fact that it reduces some of the rng is key to me
---
Probably guud when you combo with some thing like when ever you summon a minion with 1 attack give it a buff.
---
It‚Äôs very nearly the same thing, it‚Äôs not innovative at all
---
It's a known bug that happens from clicking too fast on a newly spawned creature. You can also cause it to happen in a regular game of hearthstone.
---
It's one mana cheaper?  It's an epic so you can put two in your deck?
---
I feel like it would say "look at 3 cards that started in your opponent's deck" if it was only limited to that pool. My guess is that the pool is any valid card for your opponent (their class and neutral).
---
How can Shu‚ÄôMa possibly be good?!
---
A 2 mana 2/2 is much better than a 3 mana 3/2. Though on second thought Lazul might be better because as another comment pointed out, this could offer cards in the deck but not the hand.
---
There are plans to update Battlegrounds very regularly for at least a few months. There patches planned for december and jenuary already. They are looking to replace amalgam with different "amalgam" at a higher tier and buff demons and murlocs.
---

Can potentially snowball out of controll (if card draw was a thing for Paladin). First of, it has [[Anubisath Warbringer]] buff deathrattle but 6 mana cheaper and also give them that deathrattle.
---
2nd, This buff seem to stack. And if the stacked one dies, MORE STACKS.
---
Assuming the tokens live that long.
---
Wait its a 1/7? It would be played as a 7/7 maybe a 6/7, but any lower than that and it is gonna be p bad. But 1/7? Unplayable

3/2/1 Beast | Battlecry: Silence a minion.  
---
The best use of this is in Quest Hunter. Other than that, it is kind of bad, but there is a deck for it, so it is not useless
---
They just revealed it. It's a 2 mana 2/2 Priest card called Envoy of Lazul. The text is "Battlecry: Reveal 3 cards in your opponent's hand and guess which one is in the hand to gain a copy of it." That's slightly paraphrased but it was just revealed along with two other legendary cards.
---
That was actually the best part of the tournament that I enjoy. Like how they describe their board state to each other, rearranging to sacrifice all high tier cards to minimize damage. Especially in games where one player is about to lose, doing this is extremely important to save the dying player.
---
Waste of a legendary slot. Only for battlegrounds and arena.
---
Shu'ma technically could be in Battlegrounds and could be interesting for econ.
---
Yes, but that card was really fun and skill-testing. I don't mind them making similar cards if they were fun in the past.
---
Be a fun card to make a meme Shaman deck out of. Lots of ways to cheat it out and also can slap Ancestral Spirit on it.
---
2 mana 2/2 aren't great stats anyway. You would rather go with better and consistent value if you're getting unimpressive stats either way.
---
Probably meme? But there's lots of token decks where this could be an additional board reload. Could go in the probably new zoo deck with it's 2 imp hero power or token druid maybe. Will be fun to play regardless if this works.
---
I don't think it will see play. Looks like a worse glimmerroot.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs a persistent threat and initially it‚Äôs a 7/7/13 on an empty board. I want to say this could be good in token, but it might be too slow since you can‚Äôt buff it the turn you play it, and it‚Äôs a turn 7 play.
---
Yea, but speaking from experience trying to fit extra stuff into that deck: good luck being anything more than a meme.
---
Amazing that this is one of the first cards they kick off reveal season with.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to make Stream Snipe Priest with [[Madame Lazul]], [[Chameleos]], and this card!
---
That‚Äôs strange to me because of Zoobot and Menagerie Magician giving buffs to dragons. Right now it only buffs Amalgam.
---
This is an excellent analysis actually. I wish I had gold to give it.
---
It‚Äôs vastly simpler. I started with battlegrounds and moved on to Underlords after learning the basics, it‚Äôs not even remotely close. 
---
Battlegrounds will of course develop way more, but it‚Äôs always going to be just like Hearthstone vs Magic. Doesn‚Äôt make one inherently better than the other.
---
People don‚Äôt want to admit HS sucks now I guess. Too bad

1/1/1 Beast | Each turn this is in your hand, transform it into a card your opponent is holding.  
---
You got me there
---
The only reason the META is so f'ed right now is due to the wild-event with [Evolve] returned to standard, which will leave standard with the release of DoD. Hopefully the new expansion will bring a balanced meta. It's sad that the devs are so reluctant to remove Evolve tho where the meta we had before the current event was a pretty good and balanced one.
---
It's quite different, this is a recurring effect and can go in classes other than Warrior. Though it's still probably just bad.
---
Agree. Guessing correctly felt good. Once you know the meta especially.
---
Since the tokens spawn at the end of your turn your opponent gets to answer them before you apply those buffs.
---
dragonrider talritha is too slow, but might be fun to play around with if the explorer paladin card is good, but the problem is the lack of cheap rush or taunt dragon for the stats to be worth.
---
They could just introduce some generically good dragons. The game would be even better with more tribes in it.
---
It's better IF you guess correctly IMO, since it's a 2 mana 2/2 and not a 3 mana 3/2. Lazul gives you more info, but to be honest, knowing what's in your opponent's hand has been overvalued many times already, because good players can more or less tell what's in there anyway.
---
On the other hand, since this can miss and Lazul can't, I would say that Lazul is probably still better. And if it can show cards that are in your opponent's deck, but not in their hand (let's say that you face Control Warrior, but he hasn't drawn Brawl yet) then it can be much harder than Glimmerroot in some cases.
---
Underlords have much more depth, 1 game time almost hour and uderlord almost dead lol.
---
Bob is always so supportive. Really keeps me inspired to try hard every game. I want to make him proud.

---
Where's the oppressive priest board clear?
---
1 card put your opponent in bloodlust lethal range isnt the worst.
---
Gotta watch out for those poisonous taints
---
not every just yours
---
Hopefully this will come across as helpful instead of rude, but that would actually be a bad game plan. You pretty much always want to tavern up on turn 2. Also, buying all 3 would take 3 turns where you‚Äôll never do anything with your left over gold because you have to keep freezing the board to keep these, and then when you finally get the triple on turn 4, you have no demons to start buffing it. Better to buy one, tavern on 2, and then see what you get round 3 to decide whether you‚Äôll go demons, or if you should sell this to go down another game plan.
---
That's at least just part of an effect wasted, argent and boogey monster have outright now synergy and poor stats.

I‚Äôm not saying you evolve this, I‚Äôm saying you evolve a 5or 6 cost minion into this and then it can‚Äôt be dealt with and you bloodlust them. It won‚Äôt happen much. You don‚Äôt build a deck around it. It‚Äôll happen though! And we‚Äôll remark when it does.
---
I really likes the way you and Thijs played out, I was Ok just watching and supporying you but you getting the win was a really nice extra!
---
There‚Äôs definitely more requirements that can make the match count as well, I‚Äôve won with the opponent at 22 and had it count.
---
And mind vision
---
but the idea is that simply a board of 1/1s by itself sucks, so you will cast this along stuff like soul of the murloc/forest, ect... to make it stronger. And while onixia allowed you to do so before your opponent could clear the board, this doesnt.
---
Unless there is some card in the new expansion that comboes with this, then this card wont see play at all.

if the other options are from the deck it basicly just a 33.3% to get it but if its random card it really easy to guess

---
Are they? Where did they say about new battleground stuff?
---
Bloodlust is probably easier.
---
No from the example from what I wrote,  here he seemed to place one of the murlocs wrong in the start. If you look carefully at the clip, he keeps on playing though so the animations never gets to finish.
---
I feel like it's worth noting that every priest minion has to not just answer the question "Would I put this in a deck?" but also "Can I just play this if it were randomly generated?" because of Galakrond. 
---
So would I put this in a deck? Maybe I'd put it in some sort of highlander priest in wild but I'm not sure I'd really put it in my deck. However would I play it if it were randomly generated? Probably, it's 2/2 for 2 with effect is good enough to just play in a grinder deck. 
---
Another thing to note when comparing to Glimmerroot is that it's a lot easier to guess what is in your opponent's deck than their hand off a discover. When you shuffle cards in your deck everyone kind of knows what gets shuffled in most of the time, and those shuffle effects aren't very common (outside of rogue). Your hand however can get a lot of randomly generated crap a lot easier making it a lot harder to guess.
---
Getting a golden version of one of the least picked 2 star cards is way easier than getting a golden version of most other cards. You probably don‚Äôt even have to prioritize him just pick him up occasionally when you see him
---
No autobattlers wait for players to finish to my knowledge, they're all timed.
---
It‚Äôs worth noting that this guy is basically talking out of his ass here. Wild is way less diverse than he‚Äôs making it seem, and there certainly aren‚Äôt several dozen legend viable decks. More like 10, maybe.
---
I agree with this guy, we buy it T 1, level 2 and don‚Äôt freeze hoping for an amalgam and a demon/ murloc buffer t3 so we sell the 1/1 and buy them. 
---
60% of the time it works every time.
---
you play a 3/3 that does nothing on play, your opponent won't willingly kill it for 1-2 turns, then if you you get to  play a buffed dragon... that also doesn't get anything special the turn you play it since no cheap dragons have rush or taunt, so you don't really see benefits of extra stats for 4-5 turns. Buffing big dragons doesn't do much since they'll probably be target of hard removal anyway.
---
Quest Shaman can fill their board twice. Totally insane.
---
What synergy cards? You have to wait a turn for the tentacles, at which point your opponent could have destroyed them. And a 1/7 isn't going to survive another turn, especially when your only other major threat is a gang of 1/1's.
---
Skill is more akin to your ability to apply knowledge. Knowledge is a prerequisite, but skill is what you do with it.
---
Are you under the impression it‚Äôs a battlecry?
---
Thank you for the answer, also, good to know.  
---
I was starting to think that maybe i did something wrong during the process and wasn't gonna recieve anything.
---
I'd kind of missed out on it telling the board every turn. Card just went from a fun addition to a core card in a few of my theory decks.
---
Not in wild. Token Druid in wild needs more early game stuff but this is a fantastic addition to a Reno variant.
---
You literally just said what I said in more words.
---
Warrior is getting a Galakrond already, so no she wont.
---
By that logic, these are all broken. And that excites me!

Feels like a silly idea to dump Shu'ma into a highlander deck because of Zephyrs. He'll usually find you a lethal without needing too many minions unlike a deck that would be running those cards regardless. But I guess if you want to meme then phuket.
---
IDK you play this after having spent the last 6 turns giving them boards they have to answer at some point they run out of answers to wide boards. As far as it sticking is concerned maybe they were forced to use the tools they need to answer this by then
---
but boom cant go into a token deck
---
Good for you bud. I just made a random comment that I thought other lawyers would find funny. It wasn't aimed at hurting your feelings. 
---
If you get that hurt over words this is not the right profession.
---
this has the ability to snowball if left unanswered and comes down 2 turns earlier.
---
There's also a lackey for this.
---
As shown by dog yesterday, this is an iconic trio if you wnat to get the 2nd place.
---
Yep I‚Äôve been screaming it in my group that plays it fifty health is perfect to personify a chunky boy.  Sixty is absurd.  Just finished a game in first place as Patchwerk at 36 health after getting manhandled in the early game by murlocs while building Menagerie.  Wasn‚Äôt even remotely worried because of that sixty health start. Prime example of a hero power that‚Äôs not healthy for the game.
---
Its not the last one. It‚Äôs the last boss I think it‚Äôs the god of plague of wraith I can‚Äôt buy
---
Oh my god, I was thinking about how Talithra could be absurd if you could double up on the deathrattles or summon multiple copies, and I completely forgot about the quest :O
---
Then again, there aren't any reborn dragons (yet), so it'd be tricky to have enough on both ends of the synergy... I definitely hope it'll work, tbh
---
/s should help people understand your joking but yea made up internet points don‚Äôt mean much.
---
&gt;For 7 mana you get 20 stats, which are distributed very irritatingly.
---
-
---
&gt;Your other examples are horrible because they don't kill Shu'ma, who will just resummon the tentacles. 
---
????? you might want to take another look at Shu'ma
---
Why tier are these?
---
The 3 cost that turns into a random card
---
We are talking about collusion and match fixing, not necessarily this exact situation.
---
The context for basketball would be intentionally throwing a game in order to get a better matchup in a tournament, or draft picks, or something like that.    
---
2012 Olympics had a scandal in badminton with teams intentionally throwing in order to get better matchups later in the tournament.
---
But this exact situation can happen.
---
The priest card will get used in every single priest deck that‚Äôs not resurrect... a fair statted minion that generates a card? Ok.
---
Shuma is a unique and undoubtedly powerful effect.
---
The paladin card is basically going to give you huge value all game if you play dragons.
---
None of these cards are obviously egregious like guldan or nzoth or something but they are all powerful cards
---
That's not even remotely the same. In this case Kibler and Kolento are openly teammates. It's the format Blizzard implemented for this tournament. In your examples they're *supposed* to be competitors but secretly collude for some ulterior motive, which hurts the integrity of the competition.
---
Oh okay, I haven‚Äôt played the game in awhile and was only logging in to do my daily quests
---
Can we talk about how Kibler is suddenly very comfortable promoting Blizzard and getting payed by them, after his recent decision to step down from GM casting due to the Blitzchung controversy?
---
First like  5 turns or so you just get the best stuff and some mini synergies like 2-3 minion combos. More if you‚Äôre lucky. Put yourself in position to transition when you roll a carry like a junk bot or Mal Gannis. Don‚Äôt spread yourself across all the tribes focus mostly 2. Don‚Äôt force triples. If they happen they happen.
---
This pally legendary would best fit in a more midrange deck. I think she's just weak for control because her DR effect will take too long to have a good effect on your opponent. But with low cost dragons, this card can be insane as long as no Silence or Polymorph style effects.
---
It's nine mana deal 6 damage randomly. Not sure it will be great against a board with large minions but with minions of a low health, its potentially good.
---
'Alternative game modes' LOL I don't know if you're being serious there.
---

The client doesn't know that you're a phone only player with incompatible hardware so it offers you the same quests as everyone else.

Ist like playing poker. You hit 3 of the same? Or even a full house with 3 same and 2 same?
---
I was Super excited to get these cards on a 1 hp hero only to get killed by my wrath weaver
---
What is this? Battlegrounds will get another mode or something? Case this is shit in battlegrounds.

7/13*
---
I hope this one is fake because it's seems awful
---
Where was no reveal yet. Screenshot was made from the video of HS youtuber. So it can be a real card or  mb not.
---
I personally think it was just cause they really wanted toast to join the event. Another reason is probably cause Janet is a streamer and joined in the ‚Äúpro-noob‚Äù with Toast so she is already familiar with the team. 
---
Thijs‚Äô girlfriend or Kiblers wife arent streamers so its obvious they didnt get invited to join.
---
What you said about Janet and Toast having a chance for double the prizemoney doesnt really make sense though. Neither of them probably care about the money at all.
---
Fix what?
---
Get gud.
---
Nobody has really defined how Freezing would work in Battlegrounds, but it would have to last a limited amount of turns (like maybe you only skip 1 attack phase then unfreeze), because you have to prevent the possibility of a tie.
---
Plus ban Amalgam.
---
Next year give her the 6/6
---
He protested by giving up the casting gig for grandmasters. That means that he's already made a bigger statement then you ever are going by actually giving up cash. As such, I don't think you're in any position to talk about him.
---
Hi, it's me, your other "girlfriend".
---
Prince Keleseth was good because the decks he were in were already solid. Tenpo Rogue had other cards that made the deck broken, such as 0 Mana 5/5 and Bonemare. This Dragon deck looks pretty shit so far, with no busted cards unless you get this on 3 (which is uncommon, seeing as Keleseth was in your opener less than 30% of the time with a full mulligan). 
---
If a deck had to rely on a slow 3 drop to see play, then it won't see play.
---
I've won another since then and also lost spectacularly.
---
I read 1/1 testicals.
---
Now do it with Patchwerk.
---
damn that was good
---
I am a full fledged wild player (never stepped into standard since year of the mammoth rotated out) and I can say, I only see snip snap warlock occasionally. Most of the time you play against decks that are ‚Äúokay-ish‚Äù to deal with
---
Go into wild and have fun haha
---
The one time I got 1st place with Patchwerk I went full demons with Malganis and 2 golden Wrath Weavers.
---
Holy hell your brain is so much wrinklier than mine just for seeing that play
---
Mechac'thun
---
This game mode has a lot of limitations. It's limited to the regular Hearthstone game mechanics.
---
That's a big part of strategy in the game. It's all resource management.
---
I don't think Moroes would be terrible at all. The 1 star token generators are considered good cards.
---
That's pretty amazing. I doubt I can get an order in now but surely a great idea for Xmas for someone that likes the game.
---
Oh yes, it‚Äôs all coming together
---
Pooog :D Thats crazy dude
---
Congrats! It's not easy to win. Keep on playing and watch good streamers to learn.

Cheers!

I just thought that pyros would be a good addition to battlegrounds.
---
Wow this is.. something else huh
---
Wow. That's kinda sad. They turned a card where you need actual skill to know what your opponent might be playing, to just pure RNG guessing.
---
That's just bad design. There's no way to know what your opponent is holding. Especially in the late game. In the early game the opponent is most likely gonna have cheap cards in hand yeah, but in the late game it's just pure rng...
---
I think the power in it comes from needing to deal with two things at once.
---
Leave the tokens and you die to savage roar, leave the 1/7 and you‚Äôre back in the same spot next turn. 
---
Loads of aggro games are won by going wide and then dropping a sea giant since a wide board with one big dude is just really hard to deal with in one turn. The fact this does it in one card makes me think it‚Äôll be great.
---
Ragnaros is damn powerful at mid game, don't sleep on him.
---
TOO SOON! YOU HAVE AWAKENED ME TOO SOON, EXECUTUS! WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS INTRUSION?
---
This card is fine to throw down on curve. If a Twilight Drake gets +3/+3 it's pretty solid to throw down next turn. If you can make copies of it in any way (Quest Paladin for example) it could be even better.
---
I also think this has some potential with Da Undatakah, as it will inherit the Deathrattle AND pass it on when it dies. If you have this as your only Deathrattle and get it off a few times, Da Undatakah will give a Dragon +9/+9 and the Deathrattle.

That wouldn't work actually since Shu'ma needs to be on board for the End Of Turn effect to activate

So I downloaded your installation program, or rather, the Overwolf installation program... Which asked me about privacy settings. I checked them out, and...
---
... Everything was pre-set to "opt-in", and quite a lot of settings even required a manual opt-out on third-party websites.
---
That's not very fun to do. Also, passive opt-in and manual opt-out are not really GDPR-friendly.
---
So, I stopped the installation process. I'm willing to contribute with my data though, so please let me know when the installer is updated with new default privacy settings :)
---
Yes, and then he won by topdecking a silence for the only taunt that protected me from dying
---
As someone already replied, it's not that reborn synergizes with this effect, it's that you need reborn minions to complete the quest, as well as enough dragons to use this deathrattle
---
You know that you can only play Godfrey and Deathwing for battlecry in the tavern right... on your own board
---
Thanks for the feedback! I'll ping them about it :)
---
Praise Yogg
---
i think tier 5-6 should be fine,since it give the copies of all minions,your hand would be full in just 2 turn if you decided to kept the same board for that long,and you need to dump the useless card so u need an empty board
---
and if you can get tier 5-6 you probably already have the minion you want on board and dont have an empty spot on board unless you run brann,even then u need to give up 1 more to place moorabi
---
They probably got Zerus.

I realized that if I aim to be #1 in the world in whatever I do, things will be tough in a lot of aspects for me. So having a ranking system lets me satisfy my hunger for competition while allowing me to feel a sense of progress even if I'm not the best
---
Passive hero Powers are always going to be the stronger ones, as they dont need any Investment, thus allowing for more tech, or more and better minions.
---
Also Finley can use his hero power 3 times the most if you dont want to sell a lot more, which seems like a unviable strategy. If youre loosing you dont use finleys refresh effect, and if youre winning you dont need tournament medic
---
I wonder how shujima works with the caverns below after you have completed quest.

The other 2 are always in their deck, confirmed by the developers

i need a gruul version of this.

no the goog thing is that you safely get a buffed card that you WANTED! not a random one

Thanks! Good question.

The steps in the GIF don't correspond exactly to the process as I see it, which is roughly four stages; thumbnail, sketch, colour and render. I'd say those four stages get progresssively easier yet, ironically, take pogressively longer. So the thumbnail bit (the first two scribbles you see in the GIF) requires the most mental effort, trying to find a way to assemble all the elements which need to be in the image in a way that tells some kind of a story and doesn't suck. Then comes the sketch, where that rough composition gets worked out in detail and roughly lit. If I've completed this stage effectively, most of the problem solving should now be complete and things start to get easier. This is also the point at which Blizzard would first see the image for feedback. Then there's a basic colour pass and once that's settled, the final rendering stage can begin. Everything's pretty much decided by this point so it really is just colouring in. Honestly, this is the least enjoyable part of the process for me because nothing's really happening until right at the end when the finished image reveals itself.
---
Lightfang. There's potential to win this game or next, is a +4/+4 worth keeping only a 2/2 on board?
---
I would buy Megasaur, sell Lightfang, play Megasaur, sell Megasaur, buy Megasaur, play Megasaur, sell Megasaur, buy Megasaur, play Megasaur, sell Megasaur, (if not all Murlocs poisonous) Buy Toxfin, play Toxfin, sell Toxfin, buy Murkeye, play Murkeye.
---
Shawrma
---
Now order 29 other ones and try to shuffle them.
---
Deathwing is 100% correct play
---
Looks amazing. But why not the golden version?
---
It's not only Yogg's dream tbh
---
Shu'ma seems bad (far too slow for most token decks and a board of 1/1's is easily dealt with), Dragonrider Talritha looks like it can solo-win games if you get semi-lucky so will be autoinclude in any dragon-paly lists. Envoy is a solid 2 drop for priest and I think its strong in arena too as most decks in arena are built around curve so picking the 3 cost option will be correct most of the time.
---
It can be the best t3 minion you discover based on stats.
---
Doomsayer!
---
a little bit of both. We figure out the meta so fast, it's hard to keep a meta fresh for 3-4 months without introducing new cards or changes.
---
Just wasn't big enough. Zalae Solo'd opponents board with a 20/400 few days ago for the win.
---
Yes you have to dodge poisonous though.
---
Agree on the part about wild (i dont play standard so i can only rely on hearsay) but the new game mode isnt really good in my opinion.
---
Yes
---
They should have a 7 star tier that's only accessable with getting a triple six star minion that gives out ridiculous shit like Moorabi.
---
Honestly there probably should be 7 cost cards. Something to incentivize you to get a golden card at 6 stars. They‚Äôd be super rare, but that sounds good to me.
---
Hate to say it but, People r using extensions to keep track of  enemy‚Äôs decks  which they previously fought against or saw. At this rate there‚Äôs so skill required at all. I like the game mode but it will die faster then TFT or Underlords.
---
There is another alternative play which is hero power kills minion and play the paladin minion, but if hydra lives that's still only a 50/50 against enemy hero power excluding possible deathrattle impact.
---
Nice.
---
Yea... that seems super annoying. Fortunately you can't drop them same turn outside of coin on 10 mana.
---
I would agree, but this creates a huge potential for having alt accounts throw for you or grouping with friends online to throw. Maybe as a new friendly battle option where at least 4 of you fight each other a fireside gathering friendly battle though.
---
To op would be 7 star
---
If only there was a way to capture the image of a computer screen with more quality, and not having to rely on low quality mobile cameras..

No, just saw her yesterday. The last LoE patch removed  King Mukla, Giantfin, Millificent Manastorm, and Lich Baz'hial.
---
No it doesn't. You can see for yourself.
---
https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/battlegrounds/962-the-beast
---
Take it easy dude, he was merely asking a question.
---
I don't remember, but i think each Deathrattle checks if the other minion has died. So only one of them has to die "in person".
---
I could have sworn I saw it pop out a 6/6 the other day, but I honestly can't remember. You guys are probably right though.
---
If it‚Äôs a 6 star and you need to survive long enough with zero minion buys
---
No pls. There would be way to much high roll potential with Shifter Zerus, basically adding even more rng to an already rng heavy format.
---
Every season the same, Blizz can't give out cards in English translation
---
Right that‚Äôs why i said unless you already have strong early synergy. Cobalts and murlocs don‚Äôt need anything from tier 5 and 6  to power you through mid game, even junkbot. Beast kind of fall off in mid game(and i generally hate them).  Goldrinn is usually not enough get a triple at level 4 early, and actually getting to 5 to try to get a triple into mama bear is super risky.
---
they will need a way to monetize it, at some point
---
Is nowadays every logic decision called a 200 iq play?

---
No.
---
Going for Zerus currently is a high-risk lukewarm-reward play; I don‚Äôt know if making him have a chance at tier 7 minions will make people pick him that often over other minions at tier 3, as that still sacrifices your mid game for a chance at a fast tier 5 or 6 currently. And if this makes Zerus an actual problem, he could be moved into tier 4 to make him more of a decisive choice to go for the highroll.
---
I don't think it counts only people above you, but rather everyone. Average of every opponent vs yours rating.
---
And yes, that's definitely the reason - if you play against people with lower rating, you can end up losing rating for 4th. Happened a few times to me. On the other hand, I also ended up 5th and gained a few points once.
---
Blizzard have it easier than other autobattlers. Adding new cards is much more easy then making full 3d models.
---
Daryl is the biggest example of poor animation length. The two hats bouncing takes about .75 seconds on my phone, but when you're selling 5 units in a turn to buff up that magnetic minion, the animation time adds up really quickly. I can't tell you how upset I was when I didn't have time to freeze the 15/17 taunt divine shield annoyomodule because animations.
---
I think BG needs to do away with the HS animation of "higher attacks means a harder hit." As this is where most of the slowdowns come from.
---
\- Shaman will likely get the Storm Dragonflight seen in WoW: Legion.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- Warrior could possibly be Chromatic Dragonflight which was created by Nefarian and could make more sense as the 'bad guys' with them getting Lesser Dragonflights.
---
Yeap I‚Äôm curious about this too.. does anyone know?
---
Twitch nearly 75% Mixer 3.5% assume rest YouTube/various other sites.
---
Imagine wanting to reset collections over a "dated" UI and animations.
---
Sadly both
---
literally never understood why people liked this guy as a streamer, he made some ok youtube videos back in the day
---
thx
---
Only one of them has to die. For example, Stalagg dies at some point in the match and you play Play Dead on Feugen, you get a Thaddius to spawn.
---
Given the wording it‚Äôd actually be an auto win:  you could freeze the tavern, sell the things you get, refresh, and do it again.  So long as you sell at least one minion each time you can buy and sell minions as long as the turn timer lasts.
---
This is it! He has found his calling! He'll finally be worth a damn!
---
What does a gold threshadon do? evolve murlocs twice?
---
Actually, I think it makes a lot of sense financially. DT's streaming future is mostly guaranteed with his OfflineTV partnership. Even if his viewers drop in the short term, he will be able to regain a lot of them swiftly if he ever comes back to Twitch, through "team streams" where he'd play with Poki/Scarra/Lily, and all stream together.
---
Meanwhile, the contract gives them a big short-term influx of money that they can invest into the OfflineTV brand. So if this is a "team"/business decision, it really makes a lot of sense. 
---
If it's a personal decision, I'm genuinely curious what the reasoning is. The only way it would make sense is if he wanted a phased retirement, and going to Facebook will allow him to slowly reduce the commitment he makes to his stream without nearly as big of a backlash.
---
They would, but this conversation is specifically about the wording he CURRENTLY has.
---
Amalgam + Toxfin + annoy module is way more iconic.
---
Aioros#1344 NA, trading 80g, ill show u go first.
---
Yeah, nothing stays at it‚Äôs base stats anyway.  Giving an opponent a. 3-3 is a joke.
---
No, the meta is much healthier now that Lightfang rush is beatable. I agree that heroes play a larger role, but you can still win perfectly fine with any of them. It just takes some adapting. I tanked some rank at first as well.
---
Brann's strong, but there are several stronger ones. The only hero I'd consider broken is Deryl, but there aren't many that play him properly.
---
All these streamers moving away from Twitch do it to expand their brands. Mixer is a dead platform as it stands right now. Even after they acquired Ninja, [the platform saw a DECREASE in viewership](https://www.businessinsider.com/ninja-brought-more-streamers-to-mixer-not-more-viewers-2019-10).  But by signing these exclusive deals with lower tier streaming services, they're able to negotiate more opportunity outside of just streaming. 
---
Twitch by all accounts is very restrictive of their streamers and doesn't allow their major players to be able to do the stuff Ninja is able to do now. I bet Toast is looking to do a lot more than what he's currently able to do while on Twitch
---
14/14 (assuming vanilla Sneeds) vs 3/3. Still worth it in most cases.
---
klin#1368 EU, trading 80G. I show, you go first please
---
You get the golden version of it just like any other card...
---
*And the crowd goes mild.*
---
lol I did as well! I was like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on, but I better clip that real quick.‚Äù
---
Could go well with Hack the System where you use the Galakrond weapon to feed the quest, or save Galakrond for a post-Quest completion world where you need the extra push.
---
What do you mean finally? The quest came out last expansion?
---
They already have a way of doing that.
---
Players log in, some buy packs.
---
HS is obscenely profitable for a video game so keeping streamers playing it and bringing back whales for the new expansion is probably justifying their experiment right now.
---
Both, I play standard to complete quests only when I can‚Äôt do it in tavern brawl.
---
sathrovarr is gonna be sweet this expansion
---
Yeah, that can happen. It took me more than 40 games to get to play as A. F. Kay for the first time too. It's only around 0.5% for that to happen (specific hero not offered in 40 attempts), but with millions of players, it will almost inevitably happen to some players.
---
I got your request, I'm online now bro
---
I'll have to consider crafting him, I was debating if I needed to the other day. Chose Milhouse instead tho.
---
that is amazing, basically a "if you're not running huge pogos or poison you lose"
---
Source?
---
it‚Äôs the incentives to play standard. like why do it? chests are bullshit, you do not get back what you put in, and there‚Äôs no way to show how good you‚Äôve done to other players besides a legend card back that we‚Äôve all had for 4 years.
---
hunter already uses springpaw, desert spear, unleash the beast, zilliax, sometimes vicious scalehide. you dont really need much more than that
---
Quest hunter is definitely not a tight decklist. There are so many trash cards in that deck that you just have to play to fill card slots.
---
Dragon Quest Warrior. Could it be?!
---
Lol, good catch.
---
I don't want to brag here but my phone did cost me about 150‚Ç¨ used (Honor Play) and it runs hearthstone smooth as hell. I don't have problems with animations or timer but I understand that if you play on a low-end-device or an outdated device things like that are struggles players have to face. Yet I can't understand why everyone expects app devs or devs in general to make the game run able by those devices.
---
Ahh my bad I misinterpreted this ‚Äú100% no better card for battlegrounds than this one‚Äù to include hypothetical cards as well, not just the ones in the game
---
Based on what? The hero power or the effect? Imo the card is playable and not complete garbage.
---
Then you have 6 wisps to worry about against a deck that will most likely run board buffs like Savage Roar. 
---
Shuma is tricky - either you board clear if you think you‚Äôre about to die or you hard remove Shuma, but very rarely you are in a position to do both. 
---
Definitely a sleeper.
---
&gt;worth filling your deck with rush minions?
---
It's 3 fucking minions and it's "summon" not "play". Most Hunter decks already summon more Rush minions just as is. The only problem would be if you use those up before drawing this.
---
Your first post quite literally sounds like you complaining about the game fucking you.
---
The card that really just never made it into the meta /s
---
Now all we need is a giant mechanical Gonk.
---
Don‚Äôt forget with a pinch of Madame Lazul
---
Me too!! Card stealing is so much fun
---
Wow it‚Äôs almost exactly what every person who‚Äôs made a post about this same topic has to say.
---
Right now just worse than Gallywix. Would be better as a passive, "At the end of your turn, reduce the cost for an up by the amount of unspent coins". That would at least allow for some really fast upgrades maybe.
---
Gorehowl + Upgrade is quaking in its boots.
---
This + charge minions + Bloodsworn Mercenary is gonna be pretty fun and interactive
---
That is my first thought as well, since you‚Äôre already running Pounce.
---
There were a couple of Nomi Druid lists in RoS, so there‚Äôs a shell. Unfortunately, Quest Druid is now a thing, and it absolutely destroys any combo deck that isn‚Äôt stacked with good board clears.
---
As long as you can equip two at once I‚Äôm fine with it. We‚Äôll see...
---
Toast always struck me as an entertainer first. I can imagine he's thinking of a career after gaming and this is a lot of exposure.
---
+3 attack on your hero every turn, a free Arcanite reaper and the chance to get some unber-buffed Charge minions? An Aggro Warrior deck would kill for this.
---
Is the a real card
---
r/hearthstonecirclejerk is softly weeping in the corner.
---
you can get a decent amount of free gold by doing things like beating the AI. Google hearthstone free gold and get started!
---
I would wait until the next expansion comes out in a few weeks before buying packs.
---
I completely agree with you  but i think your complaint is too shaman centered. Shaman is an absolute abomination but for me literally every obnoxious  deck now exists only bcs of this rotation. Nzoth priest, nzoth rogue, quest druid, they all exist bcs of that stupid wild stuff.
---
No, but everyone was pretty confused by this decision at first, and when Frodan realized he literally called it a ‚Äú200 IQ play‚Äù as hyperbole. 
---
It wasn‚Äôt the *best* play **ever**, but it was pretty awesome to watch.
---
Hunter already play quite a few Rush minions though...
---
One of the smaller (esports-wise) games I watch- heroes 3 HotA with streamers pulling maybe 100-1000 viewers on twitch/YT moved to FB and they said it's paying multiple times over what they got on the other platforms, even with multi streams on both twitch and yt. Even if they got like 1/10th of viewers because of that just meeting monthly streamtime quotas they get paid. 
---
Like I know taking viewership hit is not optimal but streamers will and should go where the money is. People are sick of youtube and twitch is not much better. We need more diverse market.
---
This seems good. If the creatures you draw from Galakrond already also have Charge, like Kor'kron Elite or Leeroy Jenkins that's huge burst from hand potential. I don't know about Warrior Quest, that others have been mentioning but I do think burst from hand is a very real thing in Hearthstone. Even cards like Southsea Deckhand become real threats. It's basically a 1-man Leeroy at that point.
---
Gonk Warrior time
---
This came in an email from Blizzard, so.
---
The hero we need to save us from the toxic Shu‚Äôma meta.
---
Facebook also has a small army of talented programmers. Meanwhile, Twitch has a shit player app that bleeds memory and desyncs every five minutes.
---
2 copies of springpaw (each with rush) 2 copies of hench clan hogsteed
---
2 copies of Unleash the beast 
---
Not sure if Shaw works but it shouldn‚Äôt 
---
Not sure If Swarm of Locusts will work but it might 
---
Not sure if this card makes the 2/1 echo rush playable but if it does that would be a sweet synergy 
---
1 copy of Zilliax 
---
I think this card is very very strong and might bring back masters call hunter, it should even be good with Zuljin assuming the quest plays itself before the unleash the beasts go off.
---
This card has a powerful effect with a very easy requirement
---
I mean, this seems powerful in a vacuum. The issue I see is that unlike the other Galakrond cards, this has zero impact on board outside of if you get the weapon. The invoke HP is nice though, however if your using it to trade all the time, you might not be able to swing back the board one you play this 7 mana Arcanite Reaper. This card almost reminds me of Alkli the Rhino. The issue being that his upside is great, but you lose so much tempo when you play him that you can't recover even with his upside. 
---
Seems meh-bad.
---
This honestly looks fun as hell to say the least.
---
Unfortunately, your submission has been removed because it is a repost.
---
Please search the subreddit before making a post.
---
Yeah that was a classy move. The dude is already loaded, based on his how much do streamers make video. Super cool of him to just say fuck it, and give it to those in need.
---
Idec about the balance that card art is rad
---
Amazingly this has anti-synergy.
---
FooFighter#1652 (NA) looking to trade 80g quest
---
Suprising. It also means the EVIL classes probably don't get side quests
---
In my opinion it is too slow to be played competitively. The other Galakrond‚Äôs have an instant effect. This one you play on turn 7, and most likely have to wait until your next turn to benefit from the effect of drawing 4 minions and giving them 4+4. The only thing the warrior can instantly benefit from is the 5/2 claw and hero power giving you an 8 damage swing
---
I disagree. I look at the typical decklist for one and don't see a card I would cut in favor of this. The payoff just isn't good enough. Card draw is too important and cards like knife juggler, sea giant and revenge of the wild represent too much of a swing when played.
---

---
It has! I hope all these major streamers keep streaming it, at least until DoD is released. I also hope Blizzard keeps changing up the formula, adding new features, and maybe even hosting more tournaments; the Battlegrounds Brawl was really fun to watch.
---
daym thats clever
---
Have you seen his How Much Do Streamers Make video? Dude is fucking loaded. Even if this move completely flops, he still has more money at 27 than most of us will ever see in our entire lives. That's why he discourages people from subbing to him when there are lots of smaller streamers out there struggling to make it. He'll be fine.
---
I had only one Amalgam with poison and it died early
---
Lol yes. All of those ‚Äú?????‚Äùs interspersed with a couple of people figuring it out, then POGs galore.
---
But it do
---
Really can't say that without knowing how much money they are being paid to switch. 
---
These guys know their views are likely going to go down so I'd imagine they are being paid many multiples of whatever their current earnings are on twitch.
---
Kel'thuzad went up in rank
---
*laughs in Divine Shield + Poisonous*
---
After that they should make 8 cost cards for incentive to make our new 7 cost cards golden as well!
---
More like iPhone 5ASS.
---
Amalgam with Poison is arguably the best strat in the game
---
Yep, warrior galakrond looks like it will use the hero card as the top end of an aggro deck. The invoke cards double down as +3 dmg to the enemy face (if no taunt) and galakrond itself refills your hand, gives a weapon to keep swinging, and buffs potential charge minions.
---
This will see play in the tempo-warrior decks that were so good before the wild cards.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt even add the key words. Divine shield, poisonous, windfury, also attacks adjacent minions, hell Discover: add a pogo hopper to your hand.
---
I definitely feel like they need to add either weapons or spells to increase the depth of the game mode. I'd also like to see them add full expansions worth of cards and just kind of see how everything plays out, with tier adjustments every week, like they've been doing.
---
Most satisfying win in Battlegrounds
---
That‚Äôs because the +1/+1 triggers at end of turn. Freeze happens right when you hit the button, as the very obvious visual indicator makes clear.
---
Thanks!
---
Moorabi can be one of them. Good talk guys :)
---
22 + 5 + 3 = 30 OTK...
---
No, if you have to attach an /s to your comment, just don't say something sarcastic to begin with. It's insulting to everyone's intelligence, automatically unfunny, and signals being afraid of down votes.
---
literally started following him yesterday on twitch. Welp so much for that.
---
I wholeheartedly agree, but I want these minions that already exist in Hearthstone, perhaps with some tweaks to make sense like Spellbreaker triggering it's silence on attack, but I don't like the custom minions like Kangor's, Zapp, and Lightfang.
---
Not really. The guy specifically called it support for Quest Warrior, when it‚Äôs useless unless you play it before quest completion.
---
Except running a 7 mana card in your hand that has no immediate impact other than giving you a weapon in an aggro deck isnt good at all
---
M√• s√• bli, √•h du tillf√∂rlitliga kamrat. √Ñn en g√•ng har du med visa ord och lycklig st√§mma f√∂rsonat en hektisk samtid. Men f√∂rvilla dig ej, jag skall h√•lla dig vid ditt ord som vore det en klinga mot din hals. M√• N√§cktergalens ljuva s√•ng ljuda en ny eras f√∂delse!
---
That‚Äôs kind of the whole point of running a quest, though.
---
Yes!
---
I was just on a winning streak for the first time ever with 3 wins :O
---
How much was this
---
You're right, I was too eager to comment. Initially there seemed to be a lot of unenthusiastic response which confused me.
---
Who cares when their streaming platform is trash.
---
Yeah I can agree with that
---
Well done mate. I got gold pally a a while ago. My next closest is hunter at like 370 from back in the face hunter days lol
---
65% of all statistics are made up.
---
I returned to HS after over a year pause, when they announced this new mode, cause I played some Dota Underlords and it was pretty good. But BG turned out to be pretty underwhelming compared to his big brother, so it's kinda funny for me now to see that mad hype and all of the people from my friendlist constantly playing it. I'm not bashing the mode, its allright for a beta, but as for now Underlords is on another level compared to this.
---
4500 rating and still doesn't know how to take a screenshot
---
My next closest is mage. I hope I‚Äôll get it eventually, but priest is my all time favorite class (obviously) so I had extra drive to get that one done haha
---
What's the point of the discover then?
---
OH I GET IT! It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúSecure the deck because it‚Äôs trying to force Gonk.
---
Yeah toast is almost certainly worth a couple million already. Watch his video talking about how much money streamers make, it‚Äôs absurd
---
As if for some reason it's harder to press a single button rather than pulling out your phone, opening the camera app, taking the picture, opening the Reddit app then posting?
---
I'm saying not having this up on turn 1 is less awful than drawing this mid to late game
---
I once won by getting a 1 in 7 and than a 1 in 5 with rag in arena. He is a better sniper than rexxar.
---
**Nothing is rotating out of standard with the release of Descent of Dragons** 
---
What about Evolve?
---
Your confusion is understandable. Woodcutter's Axe would be more accurately written as "Give +2/+1 to a random friendly minion *with* **Rush**" considering the way it works. I guess the way it's currently written is a bit less wordy though.
---
Since this sidequest reads "**Summon** 3 Rush minions," the minions being summoned/played have to have Rush in their *original* card text (like the [Locusts from Desert Spear](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/9/96/Locust%2890776%29.png?version=ab5165b9fdb4b6d8c8dfeb690ea2aa72)). If it read "**Have** 3 Rush minions" instead, Houndmaster Shaw *would* help trigger it, but then you'd have to have three minions with rush *simultaneously* to fulfil it.
---
It's a weird distinction, but I think it's the text of Woodcutter's Axe that's ambiguous here, not the sidequest.
---
Thank you for the advice! I appreciate having some soft guidelines on when to upgrade, and I probably have been getting greedy on some of my early turns retooling if I'm not offered anything that I think is particularly good, so I'll try not to do that. On 5 coins, assuming that you've upgraded to T2 on 4 coins, should I re-roll if I don't see anything good, as long as I keep 3 coins to be able to recruit a minion? Or, if I got a token on 1, is it better to just go ahead and sell the token to grab 2 minions?
---
They are going to need to add more minions to the pool or it's going to get old.
---
Depends on what youre facing against. Priest tends to play slower so it would be wise to hold on to powerful cards like Zuljin. But if youre playing against Shaman who tend to have very aggressive early games plays it would be best to go with lower mana cards
---
so 1 in 16?
---
add in the hero power odds.  that's 1 in 64 games it will happen, assuming he is picked to play as.
---
Noobness ............... Again. Sorry.
---
But if Battlegrounds is too much fun for so many people then they would not play the other game modes. In fact, LoL ARAM is a prime example of this where the devs noticed that the people who played ARAM played less Normal/Ranked because they were having too much fun playing ARAM so they ended up disabling it. If they want to play the Hearthstone card game without disabling Battlegrounds then they would either have to make it free or considerably less expensive
---
Until a loud minority QQ's on Reddit and gets the deck deleted :D
---
That makes a lot of sense thank you!
---
Thanks for checking it out my dude! I would say all of the players picked are really good, and this is just one tournament worth of performance; in any other lobby, most of these players would wreck shop. Like Dog killed it, but Hafu and RDU performed very well like RB's like Kibler and Amaz. 
---
Thijs was the lowest point earner but the ten points he brought easily could have meant a loss to the MF's. The RB's team strategy for civil fights also likely made his overall placement lower, but did a lot of work helping his team.
---
You get 0 cards, try again
---
Is it just the current meta to run decks that someone a bunch of low health minions cheaply that can be upgraded? I feel like that's a lot of what I see
---
And now we know why Toxfin is ‚Äúsee a Toxfin take a Toxfin‚Äù if you have amalgam.
---
I wonder if it has anything to do with very little of the new expansion being announced...
---
It's not very interesting to YOU, seems everyone else is interested in it if that's all you're seeing.
---
Thanks for calling out my post.
---
Taking a pic, closing your softwsare, opening reddit and finally submitting a post. Yes, harder.
---
Either way, you guys get real hot and bothered real easy
---
Alright alright I'll roll a druid.
---
Infinite mana!
---
I dont understand why they make these legendarys that only work in very specific instances, but then dont give us adequate tools to make them work.
---
that‚Äôs not Mal‚ÄôGanis.
---
Fact
---
Am I the only one that doesn't really like that every hero gets the same galakrond guy to replace them?
---
Like 90% sure the guy who said he was going to stop taking donations isn't trying to grow a brand anymore but I could be wrong
---
I think it'll grow stale even if they balance regularly, unless they do something really game-changing. All games are way too similar to the same 3-4 set of things you can do.
---
He didn't. You see that he basically has no board before it even got to attack.
---
wot
---
Oof
---
Why only internally
---
Ah yes, because everyone in the world is a native English speaker and deeply familiar with sarcasm.
---
Haha yea, every Reno Mage is generally expensive as hell, at least The Curator and Emperor Thaurissan are free, and alot of people already have Zeph/Zilliax. Kalecgos/Alex/Reno are pretty good mage cards if you like playing the class and would all be safe crafts imo, Phaoris and Galaxy would probably be the easiest to cut if  you were on a budget, Sorry to disappoint, but you can always live out the joys of the deck through my walkthroughs? :p Let me know if your thinking of trying it out and i can help you come up with some substitutes for anything your missing
---
45, 126, 6312. Again, why?
---
The guy is talking about going for a certain comp because he always has bad luck.
---
Oh shit, i forgot sidequests dont start in hand. Ya this is useless if it takes up a draw.
---
Let me get my wallet!
---
I would try firestone if you guys implement the feature that shows the opposing board on previous turns. HS deck tracker has it but it's sometimes buggy and doesn't track the opposing board.
---
Yeah two weeks or even three would have been aight. This is just asinine.
---
Tell me about it. That + combined bad rng luck on refreah so you dont get amything going for you
---
no. token druid generally tries to get their minions to stick a turn before they buff them. 
---
[[the forest aid] saw play in token deck and this card is similar, not as good but still similar.
---
I love the last clip... "And you know what that means!"
---
He is a dreadlord in wow. Get your facts right
---
You should
---
I never played an auto chess game before, so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the way HS does it or just because I don‚Äôt like the genre but I think I‚Äôve played...4 games of Battlegrounds. Ehh. Honestly it just makes me want to play real HS, even despite the bullshit going on in Wild (I rarely touch Standard anymore). 
---
I like the idea of using battlecries and other keywords to affect your pieces but compared to what I‚Äôve seen from my friends playing TFT, it‚Äôs just boring to play. At least in that one the pieces are fighting and dynamically moving. Not that I‚Äôd have HS do their version totally different from how the rest of the game is designed but...not a win for me. Not a win at all.
---
If other people like it, great. We always want more players, but I foresee myself queuing into a battleground about once a month.
---
It's not is as different as you'd expect. Combo is better, but so are the disruptive tools. Aggro decks are faster, but midrange/control decks also do more powerful things on earlier turns.
---
You know we half like 2/3 of an expansion worth of cards to get more dragons?
---
I think I remeber that he said he paid his editor 100$ per video, given his output that's something between 2 and 3k per month, just from that he must earn more than I do in my job
---
Much appreciated, your art is fantastic.
---
Most of the invoke cards add +1 atk so it could have aggro potential with 2 2/1s every time a card is played.
---
Are you complaining while Shaman is still there?
---
