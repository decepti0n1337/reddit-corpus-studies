I would like to see your list :)
---
Cry me a river. If you give so much weight to the opinion of a streamer, maybe you should just stop watching. I agree that it is kind of an entitled opinion, but he is not wrong. If you wanna play against new cards, old decks just aren't as fun.
---
Sweet, now we don't have to do this ever again
---
funny story, i couldn't figure out how to do the multi-purchase on PC this morning because of the icons being in a new location
---
Yes, i have an image posted here:

Idk where else. But mandarins can only be bought around Christmas time in Canada. It's become a Christmas thing like eggnog.
---
I did open the pack and did receive those heroes so this much be a glitch. It‚Äôs nowhere to be found.
---
Well, it's the one Team 5 uses, so that's ultimately all that matters.
---
double tap on the 1 pack 100 gold icon on the top left
---
How do you even manage to make a website that slow in 2019
---
Because thats what he does
---
Maybe but from my experience cyclone mage game should either end quick and if you dont end it quick, not even that herobpower can save you
---
We found out we are getting attacked, it's not just "the normal traffic" we get from here, fixing this is actually not that easy. Messaged the mods tho to unsticky it till we fix the problem.
---
The argument Team 5 *used* before they shoved the term "Evasive" down our throat.
---
Fun fact: if you give a Charge minion Charge, it can no longer Charge.
---
I got one legendary the dragon that puts 7 portals that summon random dragons üêâ
---
I just think it‚Äôs silly how it counters my deck so hard that it‚Äôs basically impossible to win.
---
If you opened 58 packs of a new set, you would have at least two legendaries.
---
Also, why not open the rest before complaining about it? I had a streak of 38 packs with no legendary today but ended up opening the average number expected once I opened all of them.
---
The website getting currently attacked and we can't really do anything about it, we will get this post updated tho!
---
What a woot pack¬ø
---
The website getting currently attacked and we can't really do anything about it, msged the mods tho to unsticky this.
---
Thanks, your videos and streams have always been great.
---
Can you do another Treant Druid for #teamtrees, or play the Obelisk Priest combo with Grave Rune? Sorry for asking.
---
Same here.  Priest Galakrond crashed my game, had to disconnect because I was stuck forever.
---
maybe you can destroy all zombeasts including the ones in your opponents hand
---
The website getting currently attacked and we can't really do anything about it.
---
It's one card in their deck. And it's not like we're in some refined meta. You're making extreme assumptions off one bad game.
---
He‚Äôs pretty good tho
---
Na all good here. 200 packs opened and all legendaries pulled. Never been this lucky. Also gone from rank 8 to rank 5 so happy today
---
Opened 260 packs, 160 from preorder, 40 from gold, 60 from more money spent.
---
The list of legendaries I got is below: (in pull order)
---

---

---

---

---
waxadred
---
I'm guessing it doesn't have enough data for the new set.
---
It‚Äôs infinite waxadreds though. Isn‚Äôt infinite anything a bad sign?
---
You got DC‚Äôd. Playing Galakrond while you‚Äôre already Galakrond will DC your opponent. It‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs been known since the fireside gathering.
---
Just play arena instead of buying packs, You can get like 350 gold worth of rewards, thats 200 gold profit, it's easy to keep up if you keep playing, like every game
---
Yea, that hits pretty hard. But for me the best card(s) so far are the shaman invoke cards. You just clear everything until the dragon comes out and you win the game.
---
[r/doggohate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/doggohate/) on the other hand...
---
Not that broken just cause they attack first
---
Anyone know how to open decent of dragon pack on mobile?
---
you have to wait a few days
---
F
---
Yes, I saw the post.
---
I agree with the earlier poster, just because you got a run of bad luck (and while I can't prove it, there are no reports of the pity timers being bugged) doesn't mean that the rest of the packs that you already paid for won't be worth it.
---
*60% of the time, it works every time*
---
Just wanted to say thanks for including my decks!
---
how did you do that... I tried and couldn't get it to happen. had to buy 90 friggin packs one at a time.
---
That's just the cards effect.  It makes your Max health 8 and your hp deal 8, much like jarraxus makes your Max health 15.
---
What sucks is this update came out for me like an hour after I'd already manually done my 60 packs
---
Holy shit
---
The screenshots can't really prove anything. There's never been a documented case of someone not getting a legendary within the pity timer.
---
thanks!
---
What I like most is comments not up votes ,thank you guys!!
---
That's not really infinite.
---
You‚Äôre right. 
---
I‚Äôm now at 65 packs with only the Priest legend. 
---
I‚Äôm well over the Pity timer
---
Based on the other posts here I feel real lucky now. Opened 12 packs, 6 from quests before release and 6 gold. Got 2 legendaries. Ysera, unleashed for Druid which is perfect because it‚Äôs one of the classes I haven‚Äôt maxed. Malygos, aspect of magic for mage which is great for the same reason. And then a whole host of epics (one pack was all epic and one rare) and lots of rares. No golds sadly. 
---
Feeling very lucky as a mostly free to play player other than buying solo adventures, who has been playing for like... yeaaars. I also like a lot of the cards and feel inspired to make decks with them which is my favourite part of hearthstone. Good luck to everyone!
---
I‚Äôm at 65 packs now
---
would be great if someone could test it...
---
Battleground is getting the views and nobody is playing it today.
---
Mind going into a bit more detail, regarding what you tried to do?
---
Played twice. First I got 7 5/5s. Second I got the 8/8 hunter dragon. To me, it's really good. It will see play, but many pros dislike rng cards (and then they play puzzle...). Now 8-2 at rank 7.
---
Might want to black out the faces of the people in the dragon's pack.
---
And here I am sitting on that worthless 1/7 that spawns 1/1s for my pity timer.
---
120 packs and 4 legendaries. Hopefully you had better luck than me
---
Wow, four hours being not even 12 hours into the new meta sure tells a lot about how strong a card is or not.
---
Just rank 12 things
---
You crazy sonofabitch. You actually got it.
---
it happened more frequently for me when doubling the double invoke too, but happened a couple times with normal invokes as well
---
Our Website is getting attacked, we have no chance to do anything right now. We will update it tho as soon as possible!
---
75 packs. Only the priest legend
---
Wait for the meta to settle in a few weeks before crafting anything. Singleton huntard is still on top, but once someone might crack the code for the newest cancer next week.
---
Complaining that people who are good at the game are winning and complaining that it is not FUN to play against people who play old good aggro decks is only kinda equivalent if you think winning and having fun are the same thing. IMO at the start of the expansion this is not the case, since it is more about cool new interactions, no matter who wins.
---
The saddest part is the guy with the golden portrait farming rank 20s. Actibli$$'s awful match making in a nutshell.
---
Lackey
---
Are you confusing [[Smolderthorn Lancer]] with [[Scalerider]]?
---
Wild cards are now purchasable with gold
---
Really lucky this expansion. I opened 78 packs and got 7 normal legendaries and 1 golden legendary. 
---
\- Golden Ancharr (Warrior Weapon)
---
\- Deathwing
---
\- Ysera
---
\- Veranus (Hunter)
---
\- Nozdormu
---
\- Bandersmorsh (Shaman)
---
\- Valdris Felgorge (Warlock)
---
\- Frizz Kindleroost (Neutral Reduce cost of dragons)
---
Try playing magic the gathering!
---
It's an alternative card game that is a bit less RNG based and is almost entirely f2p
---
167 packs 12 legendary!  Did pretty solid this expac.  [Recorded the whole thing if anyone cares to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ1i5GLcWME)!

79 packs - I just opened the paladin legend 
---
79 packs - priest and pally
---
those small minions attack before the next "attacker"
---
What you opened in epics plus what you already own has more bearing then legdendaries  you opened on what deck you should play.
---
Do you think lock Galakrond is any good? I was a little shocked the hero power is summon two 1/1 imps. What‚Äôs two 1/1 imps gonna do against big late game minions? But maybe I‚Äôm missing something. I do suck at making decks
---
And even if it was just a straight copy of the minion, it wouldn't get shuffled in until after flik's battlecry resolves.
---
fucking lackey
---
Oh I agree its messed up. I'm just saying for the time being you can anticipate the entire game to be a win or lose purely based on those 8/8s 
---
I dont think the quest needs to be adjusted, personally I think making the invoke effects a battlecry were an oversight. They could have just left it as "invoke galakrond" and kept the same effect without the battlecry abuse
---
it's not the traffic, this is what we first though tho, we are getting attacked.
---
Canon-wise, Major Domo Executus summons Ragnaros too early from his sleep/restoring of power, so he emerges at a weakened state. Which explains why the player becomes a weak ass Rag.
---
I was about to beat a guy who was doing exactly what you're doing, but I conceded to him because it was so amazing to see him almost pull it off. Mad respect to you!

I have to say, it doesn't resemble Hearthstone art. I'd have no idea where this is from if I was shown this.
---
Where have you seen it?
---
I‚Äôm using a fairly new iPhone 7 and swiping down to text is what I normally do. When I return to the game, it gets progressively laggier and eventually crashes.
---
I‚Äôm rocking a Druid Treant deck and it‚Äôs a blast! I have always wanted a full Treant deck, not a Token hybrid, and I finally have it. Talk about Aggro. I‚Äôm finishing games on Turn 7 easily. This feels like it may be a contender against Murlocs. 
---
Yay for trees!
---
I think it would matter with Immortal Prelate as well
---
Geez that‚Äôs even worse. I wish y‚Äôall the best of luck
---
The dream.
---
Another sub here. I‚Äôm not a pro and I‚Äôm not afraid to have my hand held on new expansions.
---
I have a fairly new iPhone 7. My brother just got a brand new iPhone X and he experiences the same problems.
---
Mind sharing your list?
---
that is the idea yes... being as mech/murloc is the only 2 strong tribes atm it enables deathrattle, demons and beasts to be good earlier on, and not a -30 loss if ur "protect this minion" dies before anything else... while also still giving value to zapp as they ignore taunt.
---
Congrats... I got the druid legendary that makes your treeants bigger. Yay
---
Galakrond Warlock should most likely be built like a Zoo deck, so you want to close out the game before those late game minions come up. Galakrond himself is not really played for the Hero Power - HP is there to combo with Invoke minions, while Galakrond himself is mostly played for his Battlecry effect + 5/2 weapon.
---
Went from rank 7&gt;5 on a continuous win streak with Galakrond shaman 
---
I see all these quest shamans running Galakrond and I‚Äôm just gonna say I dont think its a good idea. I‚Äôve wiped the floor with every one of them so far
---
Ok makes sense, waxadred is no more broken then any other meme deck that rogue likes to play. You either got very unlucky or they got lucky  and that‚Äôs just how it be sometimes.
---
So far I've opened 90 Packs and I've got 3 legendaries. I opened one Pack 9, then 39, then 37. 
---
Can't believe it, so took a break from opening packs. 
---
Anyone as unlucky as me so far?
---
Every Galakrond deck is running Kronx, and the card is good so far. Imo, it's a safe craft.
---
yeah i really liked this expansion so i saved up extra early. Pretty lucky this time. How did you go?
---
So invoke is a mechanic that works if these 2 conditions are met: 1. You are playing a class that can use galakrond and 2. You have galakrond in your deck. The classes that can use him is warrior, shaman, warlock, rogue, and priest. Invoke then upgrades galakrond and uses his hero power.
---
Keep up the momentum, friend
---
You should get all 5 forms of him for free if you go to open cards since you logged in within the first 90 days of the expansion
---
I think its a Europe thing.
---
8 packs, got Frizz and 3 epics
---
When was Mally Druid oppressive? Odd Paladin got multiple cards nerfed and HoF deck is one of my all time favorite decks.
---
Yeah same

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
---
It‚Äôs by no means perfect, but if you can draw a decent curve, you‚Äôll have 3-5 minions up by turn 3, and then buff a couple times. Even if your board gets cleared, as long as you haven‚Äôt exhausted your hand, you should be able to refill the board with 3ish more and then buff. It‚Äôs hard for most decks to deal with that level of aggro it seems.
---
Waiting for rule 34 of her.
---
Warlock removal + never ending stream of minions. Small as they may be, an exhausted opponent will inevitably succumb.
---
Plus you get a board full of demons when you flip.
---
Ohhh, yeah I ignore my card packs... I'm dumb thanks!

You... reached rank 5?

I had a Samsung galaxy, broken screen, picked it up for 60 buck second hand worked a dream and that was all I used it for just Hearthstone .the s6 I think. My personal preference is anything apart from apple, that might be what the problem is "/
---
You can't open double legendaries unless you have them all..
---
That's your problem?
---
Not Shaman Galakrond?
---
Considering the board state his 8/8s will be cleared next turn without much trouble. So much for the power spike. I do not claim, that he should  have waited here though.
---
That's ridiculous

4 8/8 rushes is even better haha

Thanks for taking one for everyone.

One aspect of this people are missing is that now you can play Jenkins put Grave Rune on him, smash a taunt and then smash face with your new two 12 dmg jenkins.
---
Ah okay so essentially just pick up the strongest overall cards early and then transition into whatever build fits best? Around what tavern tier do you need to ‚Äúdecide‚Äù a tribe to commit to? I played a few games recently and I got some really good early mech pieces, but even after hitting tavern tier 4 some of the good cards like the Annoy-o-tron with magnetic never showed up. However, Toxfin and other murlocs kept coming up. In this scenario, should I have shifted to murlocs even though I had a majority mech synergy?
---
Complete guess but I bet it's less likely that this happens to somebody and they actually post it to reddit, than this highroll actually occuring.
---
what the fuck is a flair
---
25k!? Nice dude. I avg 4-5 wins in arena so I'm going to put my 3k gold there and hope i get more than 30 packs by the end.
---
My opponent had leather on board and my quest was on 5.
---
You probably want to find a slot for [Faceless Corruptor]. That card is insane, especially with all the tiny minions that Quest Shaman can generate. It's like Oasis Surger in Quest Druid except instead of playing off curve for 4 turns you just need to have a minion already on your side of the field. It's even better when you value trade then play your Faceless Corruptor on your damaged minion and then rush in with it again.
---
Shield of Galakrond is a good place to start cutting. Not only is it meh for its cost but Corrupt Elementalist already invokes twice, which means you don't need as many invoke cards that aren't great to supercharge Galakrond especially if you juice an Elementalist up with the Heart of Vir'naal.
---
I was on something similar, then 5 packs later I got double legendaries!
---
&gt; It's only because of the buffs that give them easier access to health buffs, and mechs being nerfed to not pressure them as hard; that they are now generally strong
---
Yes, we are in total agreement. They are generally strong right now without megasaur. And they also have megasaur.
---
It's really a chore though, yes I just pulled it off. Easier way to use this is to just go Leeroy, cast grave rune, attack a taunt, and then enjoy your fresh two new Leeroys that then go face.
---
Yeah, I got many legendaries, even two golden.
---
Average of 10 legendaries every 10 packs is awesome
---
Shrooms are part of nature! They must be preserved!
---
Nope , still missing some like between 10 legendaries i think, for epic ,i don't even have half i think.
---
Someone earlier commented they open like 300 + and only missing 3 epics.
---
Euh... idk. It always worked for me.
---
[removed]
---
Yea exactly quest rogue was abysmal. I was very disappointed with it and mainly played Highlander Hunter last expac. The limited AOE really limits rogues power and design. Can't assume certain archetypes bcz lack of control. I guess you win some and you lose some bcz rogue is the only class with roulette type of feel when you play.
---
Now with this expansion, at first I wasnt too pleased with it. But after playing a grip of ladder I've been smashing. Only 3 loses from 15 to 9. I'm actually surprised with what they did with rogue. Not only did they maintain it's identity but they gave them tools to match the power level of other classes. It never felt so good giving a warrior a good pounding. After all I suffered at their expense this last year.
---
But yea Hunter and shaman have definitely had their due share. It's time for the kids in the back to shine. I wanna see a tier 1 warlock or the Highlander paladin running it up on ladder.
---
Faceless corrupter is still incredibly strong on 6 with lackey + corrupter. Its delaying the inevitable. The card is strong, and you shouldn't ask people to make bad trades to play around a neutral card
---
Thanks for the concern, I went to the bank because I thought something was wrong with my card.
---
Card draw translates to tempo because you can play more cards in the same amount of time. The problem with Novice Engineer is the stats are too bad that the tempo is outweighed.
---
Big Ol' Whelp doesn't have the same stat problem. It is good tempo for cost *and* cycles itself.
---
As I stated in my response to your other comment, your definition of tempo is far too narrow.
---
C'thun warrior was one of my favs when the old gods set came out. Ancient shieldbearer dropping stacks of armor, twin emp vek holding the line against aggro, fun times.
---
One of the most rage inducingly busted cards since pre nerf corridor creeper.  Single handedly invalidates any non flood archetype
---
Crazy stuff! Thanks for the low down on last season, I should really play regular mode more and see this stuff unfold, from what I‚Äôve gathered so far this deck seems strong and so does the pirate warrior, I sure hope we don‚Äôt have another patches style super meta wrecking all when it‚Äôs refined. 
---
Bring back a strong control dragon priest am I right? Haha
---
I‚Äôve never cared about goldens before but i might have to craft it for the little arm waves
---
You need to got to blizz browser store and "buy" kft andventure for free. After that it should be in your single player menu.
---
And you can trivially add quest to galakrond shaman so on turn seven you can invoke four times with one card!
---
That‚Äôs an unfortunate roll, but obviously that‚Äôs a rare outcome. And the reality is that a free Deathwing is still fairly useful in most contexts.
---
I have, he‚Äôs so fun
---
Y'know, logically, seems like a good deck.
---
pulls off\*
---
I didn't get lucky enough to open her, but I still think that she's my most played new card of this expansion in Dragon warrior.
---

---
Ah yes my favorite deck: aggro priest
---
Fireball
---
A chonker, a real absolute unit.\*
---
I've noticed this as well. A lot of the times you don't see your opponent summon the 4th elemental and that's when you know to instantly back out and reconnect.
---
The minions just need to be lower. 2-4 8/8s with rush is just entirely too much,especially when you have one minion that invokes twice, but counting the quest. They just need to lower the minions to like 5/5s maybe. It's seriously busted in its current state.
---
Well I got one with 5 rares once lol
---
Rose#13801 have 80g looking for trade
---
Yeah by my math it's a 1/2116 chance to get two of the same dragon. The fact that it was Deathwing just made it that much crazier. (And as I noted above, Deathwing was a particularly bad fit in my Shudderwock deck.)
---
I did won with one, and yeah, feels a bit unfair. 
---
The Tier 5 Murloc really helped me build a board that have a decent stats. Without it, i honestly don't think i can survive until end-game where i got my megasaur.
---
They make money by people buying packs, it shouldn't take hundreds upon hundreds of dollars to get all or most of the epics in any given expansion. They make plenty of money. By your logic packs should cost double what they do now and they should roll back no duplicate legendaries because "tHeY HaVe tO MaKe MoNeY sOmeWhErE"
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'll never understand this bootlicker mentality. They already make money. Lots of it. They would still make plenty of it if they made their system slightly less predatory.
---
The hearthstone-decks website is actually fucking garbage.

I asked for help but for insults.

I'm sure this has happened to a lot of players before as well.  
---
If you have nothing productive to say then say nothing at all
---
I already did that on my phone. I‚Äôve even uninstalled and reinstalled. My friends aren‚Äôt having the same issue. It‚Äôs pretty annoying and am just hoping I‚Äôm  it the only one but it feels like I am sadly.
---
I have noticed that if I let the animation play out and don't try to attack right away, I don't always get DC'd
---
Yes, one has to think very critically to imagine a third category of players who aren't registered, and also aren't active, but are somehow players. Well done, smart guy. 
---
There are not three meaningful categories here. Saying meaningless words then invoking "critical thinking" doesn't make you clever. Quite the opposite, in fact.

Mhyr#21463

Love this card already. Had him turn into Jepetto on turn 7 and dropped it to get Shudderwock and Lynchen for 1 mana each. Opponent insta conceded the second Shudderwock bounced back. 
---
Got Ysera in another game and had a floop in hand. Tons of fun with this card.
---
You got more legendaries in 1 pack than I did in 105. Help me.
---
A little bit O old school Opeth action, nice üëä

Stop! He's already dead...

Unlicensed Apothecary into Diseased Vulture works as well.

Are we gonna ignore the fact that it's licking its own eyeball?
---
Someone else said gecko inspiration
---
76 packs. Alexstraza, Kronx, Ancharr, Deathwing, Ysera, Waxadredd.
---
I literally got almost ALL my favourite and wanted legendaries. RNG was super good to me this expac. :D
---
What a Big Ol' Whelp
---
This isn‚Äôt standard
---
Fair point.
---
Next time ask him nicely to play vs innkeeper, it counts (if he wins of course :)
---
Yiddle
---
I got lucky and got 5 off 66 packs as well. Usually I have terrible luck on here so I'm glad for once I didn't.

In sweden we have an idiom: "Den dagen, den sorgen", or *That day, that sorrow*. I feel like this applies here: if blizzard ever wants to make something that interacts with it they can make it a keyword but that day, that sorrow.
---
I absolutely 100% agree. You play several matches to get that 100 gold. You buy a pack. And you get the same crappy neutral epic cards. It truly sucks
---
ya that's totally what i want to happen.
---
i was here
---
No he's far better only changes into Legendaries which on average are very unserstatted/overcosted and rely on their effect. Here comes Bandersmosh and increases their stats and decreases their costs.
---
I should be allowed to enjoy mocking the stupid, or is that not wholesome 100!!
---
you're a half-empty kinda guy aren't ya.
---
Bander has no synergy with any deck. It's just a standalone powerhouse
---
Not found a problem with it tbh? Rank 5 atm.
---
Also, Treants. They're not a minion type and they don't need to be.
---
Haha me too, it's like the ONE decent epic I opened in the entirety of the expansion
---
That minion will attack all others. Dead rattles of opponents minions only trigger after that 12/12 has finished attacking or died. 
---
Which means my taunt 2/6 with deadrattle: kill opponent‚Äôs minion did didly squad to protect my other minions and that 12/12 IGNORES TAUNT and will just randomly attack.
---
The "approved by Blizzard" text will, as you suggested, be changed until we can find a direct quote that can justify the claim.

Thanks again for the suggestion :)

Ceeu#2321 EU 80g quest trade

I've been having a blast with Highlander Dragon pally. I've climbed from 13 to 9 so far. I beat most aggro decks I come across with it. Lemme guess, share?

I think you're right indeed. I'll talk internally with the people at Overwolf to see if something can be implemented, and how they themselves feel about it.

Yes please palidin is my favorite class and highlander is my favorite archetype you've tick all the right boxes

Back in GvG, who tf didn't? :P
---
 RAVEN#21301 EU trading 80g quest, you go 1st
---
Maybe Quest Hunter is for you then?
---
Maybe they will not nerf it, I feel its OP but maybe it's just that it was the easiest to figure out and not all decks are tuned correctly right now :/
---
Open all option would be nice
---
I got 5 out of 112 packs but got x8 Transmogrifier.
---
House mate opened 20 packs, 4 legendaries (one golden), 3 epics
---
They should swap out heros and minions every week.
---
yes, AI, my summer child
---
Update #1: 49 packs still no 2nd legend. Wait till 2morrow for da final blow.
---
Whenever I'm playing rogue I just use Skyshiv and Faceless corruptor for decent board clears. Both have worked out for me so far.
---
27 packs, 4 legendaries, 6 epics and 2 golden rares. Pretty good for an F2P player i guess :D
---
Please delete your rude comment. Guy works so hard every expansion to keep people up to date with popular decklists.
---
Head over to hsreplays to see what the top decks are. Also don't craft anything for about a week- new expac just dropped and the meta will take some time to settle.
---
Why make this specifically about Tempo Rogue is the emote is what's triggering you?
---
Only if my understanding of the card is correct, that it kills all current copies but not any future ones.
---
/r/woosh
---
Shame on you.
---
Luckiest bastard to ever walk the face of the Earth.
---
Class is totally broken since 2014, just like Druid.
---
Sometimes unplayable, sometimes need tons of nerfs, and still were dominating meta. I really wish after this 5 years they could rework them someway to be more polarised and fair
---
Without a card like Leeroy, aggro decks would be left without a consistent finisher. Without a way to close out games in Classic, aggressive decks are either going to be universally weak or a new version of Leeroy will be made every year or so.
---
^ this. It is so annoying.
---
it is better in 9 times out of 10. An x mana 5-5 is better than an x mana 4-4 spell damage +1, case in point if there was a 4 mana 5-5 everybody would play it, as opposed to ogre magi that sees no play.
---
yeah that's a lot easier, oops (can even get you a turn 3 large/large)
---
I guess my thing was more of a proof of concept
---
Cool, i still don't enjoy any standard rogue decks.

Hello
---
Guaranteed Rare ~~or~~ and better!
---
&gt;I tried all the suggested fix I could find but this did nothing.
---
I kinda did, I didn't know exactly to formulate it, my bad anyway
---
&gt; I said that being killed by Flik isn't an attribute of tribes, and that's what my example shows.
---
And I agree. Again, the point is not to say that they're exactly tribes, or behave in that exact manner. The point is to say that these groups of minions should not be treated the same as groups of random minion.
---
I'm not saying they're tribes. That was never the point. I'm saying that these are groups of minions which should be distinguished from just random-ass minions. Yes, being killed by Flik means they (Slimes or Treants) are considered the same minions by the game. But the point is to differentiate them from normal minions - if you make two copies of a Knife Juggler, I wouldn't call this group of Knife Jugglers the same as the group of Slimes in the picture above, or Silver Hand Recruits, or Treants. Because Slimes have different card art, and originate from different cards. Whereas copies of Knife Juggler are *the exact same card, in all aspects*. Unlike the Slimes.
---
If you don't want to use "tribe-like" because it offends you, fine. Use anything else. Use "Crowd" minions, for all I care. The point is to distinguish these groups of minions apart. I don't really know what I can add to this. It feels like you're being bogged down by the usage of the word "tribe", when that wasn't the point.
---
Oh I got destroyed by that deck the only one that‚Äôs really stomped my pirates.
---
WAS? WAAAAAAAS? BIN ICH DER GL√úCKLICHSTE MENSCH? 2019 Edition
---
I dont understand how you did it
---
A battlecry is something that another shaman minion can repeat :) 
---
making another card "if played from hand" instead of "battlecry" will change nothing for that card, ... but the other card will not be able to repeat it
---
Use hsreplay to find decks. However finding budget decks might be hard. Also check out YouTube channels. Deckster has some videos about making budget decks. Tbh I would buy descent of dragon packs, but the meta didnt  settle so maybe wait a few weeks before deciding. If your goal is too reach legend save your dust and wait for a good deck then craft the cards just for that deck. Eventually you will get more dust and can make other decks but that might take a while. Kronx might be good and might be bad. Depends if galarond is Good but I would hold off on it. I think the best galkornd deck rn is shaman but that's expensive iirc. Before this expansion number one safe craft is zilliax. Might still be but ultimately depends on the deck you choose.

What about Highlander? Feel like that would be better than tip the scales.
---
First 10 of every expansion, then 40.
---
Bought 80 with gold, others from all around (one of them from unfinished arena run, to have a new free ticket).
---
It‚Äôs an amazing card !!!
---
Consider [[Novice Engineer]], a 2 mana card with the same effect and no tribal tag. It's a 1/1. It sees regular play.
---
For 3 extra mana, Big Ol' Welp is a +4/+4 in stats with dragon synergy in a set that has massively pushed the dragon archetype. The question isn't "why is this card good?" and more "why shouldn't I include this card?".
---
Card draw is good. A 5 mana 5/5 is relatively "fair" stats. You may be running a dragon deck. There are plenty of reasons to include this card, just like Zilliax (even if this card doesn't hold a candle to it) and the only reason not to is if it doesn't suit your game plan. If you can't think of a more suitable card for the 5 mana slot, you include this card because its effects are ubiquitously good and its stats are fair.
---
Auto-include cards don't need to be game breaking to be "busted". Azure Drake was Hall of Famed for this reason;it was **the** choice of 5 drop for the majority of decks. Recently, Druid's core cards (Wild Growth and Nourish) were nerfed because of their play rates.
---
In summary, it's "busted" because it's a 5 mana card that you really have to ask "why not include it?", and the answer is there often isn't a very good reason.

2/1/1 | Battlecry: Draw a card.  
---
The space only opens/closes the flipping cards layout. But that layout is not closeable unless all cards have been flipped, which you still need to do with your mouse.
---
Opening one pack goes like this. 
---
`space (open new pack) - flip card (x5) - space (close pack)`.
---
But the problem with the ui on pc is that the 5 cards are displayed in a layout that resembles a pentagon or circle around the center of the screen. Extending that layout to display a variable number of cards is not that easy.
---
For example in MagicArena this issue is the same. They made it so you can either open 1 pack or 10 packs. Both have hardcoded layouts which are not scalable. So you cannot open 2 packs, or 7, or whatever amount other than 1 or 10.
---
This is why I said a change to carousel or slider would be needed on pc for this
---
I don't really do ranked bruh, I'm at 25. Never said me anything, it sucked ass back when I played, it probably still does (to me at least)
---
I'm not a super competitive player, I just like to have fun. That being said, losing every game isn't fun.
---
I didn't know this was a bug I just thought my internet connection was doing something weird. All people playing Galakrond Shaman should be banned for exploiting the game. I'm joking of course but I would not be mad if it actually happened.
---
Nice
---
Aww thanks &lt;3
---
After the paladin mess, I swapped over to hunter then rogue. Honestly the issues I had with all 3 were the battlecries doing damage and just destroying my minions.
---
That and I feel the 4 8/8s are too much value and take too much to remove
---
Same here, only problem is pirate warrior for me.
---
Fuck. I really shouldn't continue, but you're being so aggressively obtuse about all this that I feel obliged.
---
&gt; You were the one that introduced the term tribe like to describe what was actually meant, and now you're refusing to entertain that.
---
Yes. "That's why they put "tribe" in quotation marks, I believe. They weren't saying they were strictly speaking a tribe, they were saying they were a tribe-like ensemble of units, like Silver Hand recruits and Treants." Can you please read this sentence, or is it too much to understand? Here, the point is not the resemblance of Treants, Slimes or Silver Hands with the Tribes of Hearthstone (emphasis on this part: **They weren't saying they were strictly speaking a tribe**). Here, the point is to group these units together, similarly to how minions are grouped in Tribes. What you were supposed to take away from this, which you failed to do, was not the "tribe" part of tribe-like. It was the implied grouping of these minions, *like tribal minions*.
---
&gt; You talked about synergy
---
Specifically, I said "Treants have Treants synergy," I never talked about Slime synergy. The only reason I brought that up is to counter the idea that there was nothing tribe-like about Treants. But that wasn't the point of my comment. That's the part of my comment you chose to fixate upon. The fact that Treants have synergy, and Slimes don't, doesn't mean anything about them being "tribe-like" in the sense I was discussing originally or not. Because *we're not talking about tribes!*
---
&gt; You said that, but when I ask about effects for slimes, you just ignore it!
---
Because, get this through your brain, please, *I'm not talking about effects, or synergies, or even tribal characteristics.* I'm talking about the points of difference between groups of minions like Treants, Slimes, and Silver Hands, and the groups of minions like a bunch of random Knife Jugglers, or Wisps, or Shieldbearers.
---
&gt; Oh, and notice how you said "tribe-like" and implied that you said it before that (which you did).
---
This sentence doesn't make any sense from a grammatical standpoint, so I will just ignore this.
---
&gt; You did you use the term tribe like multiple times.
---
Again, the only reason I used "tribe-like" is because OP used "tribe". The only reason OP used "tribe" is to define these groups of minions. Not to actually say they're tribes. I didn't say they're tribes. I said they're tribe-like, in the sense that *certain aspects of how we can call these minions can define them as a group of minions that is appropriately covered by the term tribe*. Yes, it isn't "tribe" in the Hearthstone sense. Yes, the Treant synergy doesn't imply that the Slimes have synergy. Yes, it means that Slimes and Treants aren't exactly tribes, and not exactly the same. Yes, yes, yes. Despite all this, the original point still stands that they're similar in certain characteristics.
---
-Treants and Slimes both have several different cards representing them, with different card art.  
---
-Treants and Slimes can be produced by a variety of different cards. Living Mana Treants aren't the same as Force of Nature Treants.  
---
-The different variants of Treants and Slimes are all named "Treants" and "Slimes" despite having these obvious differences.  
---
What do you think I'm getting at here? That Treants and Slimes are like Murlocs and Beasts? Or that these are specific groups of minions *that aren't totally identical apart from the name* that should be distinguished from other groups of identical minions?
---
Did the invoke minions/ spell not invoke all Galakrond? Seems that the left-most Galakrond gets upgraded fully but not the right ones
---
:(
---
Literally nobody cares.
---
Honestly I think ‚ÄúWard‚Äù could work well.
---
This was my first pack btw
---
So if I opened on the second pack, my next pack should be legendary...
---
Yeah cause its powerful against a lot of decks, it's definitely very good. But it can be beaten. Cube lock is very good against it, odd warrior can beat it, reno decks can of course beat it. These decks can also beat a lot of the field. But of course if you are playing any kind of greedy deck, or slow, or otk you get smashed by secret mage.
---
Plus you can put anti secret tech in if you really face a lot and run weapon removal. It really shouldn't be such a high win rate deck, and people started to tech against it. Its different to the snip snap problem as it was unfair, secret mage is fair but strong.
---
The saddest part of the story is I had Flick Skyshiv in hand but was 1 mana short for an epic comeback.
---
Highlander Shaman does well against them.
---
Mate your English is great. And if it wasn't there's no need to apologize.
---
I'm also having surprisingly decent success with albatross priest but I still haven't figured out the best way to deal with the 1/1 that weakens the Galakrond battlecry, there are options but the list is tight. I'm not even play for fatigue, the fact that they draw birds while your hero power gives you value already brings games at home.
---
That‚Äôs reused from a 2009 WoW dungeon where you compete in a tournament, unlike the other themes which are mostly composed for hearthstone
---
Want to craft but I think it'll be nerfed.
---
Oh yeah? Well, not to brag, but I opened *FIVE* legendaries in my first pack. All of them were hero cards too. So, uh, get on my level *heh*
---
Unless you are Control Shaman. Hagatha OP.
---
Ah darn can't compete with that eh?
---
The last combo was fixed because of the million battlecry turns from throwing down a bunch of 1 mana Shudderwocks. Being able to drop 1 down a turn, even if it ends up being "infinite value" isn't anywhere near the problem that 20 minute battlecry animations were.
---
yeah I mean except for the fact that they've done nerfs every expac for the last year within a month or so of the release date but hey don't let my facts get in the way of a good old fashioned circlejerk
---
Idk where you're getting at, but you're getting downvoted...
---
There is no way the deck is good you need to  have effects that summon transform that and then pick it up. Hitting that in the correct order and without clogging your hand is not consistent. Also 9 mana shudder is a lot worse then 1mana shudder
---
Sorry man I was insulting reddit gold because I was hoping someone would gild me for it, since people often get gilded when they do that.
---
The game looks for a Galakrond and the first one it finds counts as "yours" for the rest of the game or until you play a different Galakrond, iirc.
---
Just play quest taunt with bolster. I got to legend with it 2 seasons ago and it‚Äôs only really hard matchup is secret mage that you can tech
---
I agree and hope you're right. Shaman is too versatile, too strong, and worst of all, too ubiquitous on the ladder right now. I was hoping DoD would give more and better tools to offset Shaman, but it seems like they went a different direction.
---
I would love if they took the same approach to Priest anytime ole Anduin got a busted deck, instead of nerfing it within a couple of weeks (like Raza, Extra Arms, etc.).
---
You WAY ahead.
---
He‚Äôs a Proto Drake too (him eating other Proto Drakes just caused him to get really big and mutated).
---
oh my f\*cking gosh I meant dude T-T
---
I lose to the bug that makes my game stop fucking working after I invoke Galakrond about 10% of the time
---
moved to trying wild otk galakrond rogue, happens there too. currently reinstalling in the desperate hope for a fix :/
---
I've found that the best way to beat them is just try and curve them out because with the latest expansion Highlander Mage got one of its biggest weaknesses (their early game) buffed extremely, it doesn't really matter what you use just as long as it either 1. Removes the board or 2. Develop minions, you can also do that with multiple strong tools such as new 6 mana 4/4 that grants free spell, zephrys, Reno, scalerider etc.
---
If you're still struggling I would advise to cut some of the mid/late game minions that aren't really necessary and add in any combination of: doomsayer, ray of frost, ice nova, secrets for anti aggro, snip snap, rolling fireball, dragon maw scorcher.
---
They know your true potential
---
nonetheless it is completely shamanstone for now. between rank 4-1 at least.
---
No combo priest isn't bad and hasn't changed that much. But Galakrond/Dragon priest seems to be underwhelming and I guess that might drag it down. The invoke effect for priest is high value but ultra slow, too slow for hearthstone.
---
Lmao Deathwing's art is similar too, it looks like he's posing for a yearbook photo in the original and he is rocking that just one beer away from blacking out but having too much fun to care look on Mad Aspect.
---
It's probably not optimal with the amount of good cards you can now put in your deck. Shaman already has a ton of value so focusing more on tempo cards seems like the better plan.
---
So guy buy packs and stop being broke
---
I was not excited to learn that shudderwock played after faceless corruptor will summon copies of shudderwock. Saronite chain gang 2.0 feelsbadman
---
Hahaha, I hope you and they are right!
---
Well, then let me tell you your feelings are wrong. Decks that were strong before are still strong now and perfect contenders.
---
It looks like you just wanna play with the new shiny toys but that means trowing away your old ones. No, the new cards arent broken op. And the main new card being played right now is galakrond and it was given for free. And we arent even sure right now if its that good and will remain in the meta, while old decks are still perfectly playable.
---
Just wait a week and see for yourself.
---
Zzerabu isn‚Äôt a safe craft. The 3/3 priest legendary has uses and the rogue dragon legendary doesn‚Äôt. Also, Ancharrr is definitely one of the strongest cards in the set.
---
So you‚Äôre denying what you did what just stupid?
---
True master
---
How does invoke work if you put an invoke card in your deck but no Galakrond? Does it still automatically use your classes Galakrond hero power?
---
I'm loving the new preist meta. Invoke for value, control the board, use your opponents deck against them.
---
That's fair. Also I didnt know that was Simpson joke.
---
Haha just kidding around, they definitely know you weren't calling them a dud :)
---
Well everything in HS works in steps and it's really clunky how it works.
---
You draw a card, card enters hand, it's a Dragon, the game then checks for a Dragon.
---
There are other scenarios where this stage DOESN'T work but that was in previous expansions so don't know if they straightened it out?
---
because of the thicc description :)
---
I feel like removal/control dragon priest might have enough value with Galakrond to slow it down and make it very annoying to go against. That and that new priest card that summons 2x of a minion after it dies. That card has come in clutch with my deathrattle and ziliax cards.
---
Also since it is almost guaranteed with all the dragons this cycle, they balance around being able to use it at its full power.
---
7 of those Hot Air Balloons and a golden one to top off :|
---
I also happened to randomly get bownsamdi from galakrond
---
Medivh doing his best
---
I agree with this list almost entirely. The two things I would change are 1: moving all the galakronds and kronx down a tier. I think eventually they may get phased out as they might get outpaced at some point in the future. 2: I would move murozond the infinite up 1 or 2 tiers. For the sake of being controversial I will say 2 tiers. This card is so good if your opponent... Plays cards. Even if they just play a 4/4 this cards pretty freaking good. Since in hearthstone opponents tend to play cards, this card will be pretty dang good in a few metas that could happen.
---
Maybe this is the drawback for the insane Shaman value. Working as intended.
---
Language mistakes can be brutal, i'm French haha
---
No wonder as shamans quest is completely bonkers.
---
i NEEeeeEEd yooooUUUUU
---
I don‚Äôt think he was the progenitor, just the biggest one at the time.
---
Reminds me of when squidward is alone in that white room.
---
I would say:  
---
  
---
Duh! It's the same way the warlock and druid spellstones worked but then I remember we are talking about Hearthstone and that you shouldn't expect things to work the same way they have in the past.
---
Maybe it's a codename for the dod solo adventure?
---
HS packs are definitely not more expensive than physical MTG packs. They even seem to be cheaper than MTG arena packs
---
&gt;The wording ~~kinda suggests~~ *literally says* that
---
It is kind of insane how much cards have powercreeped. People thought a 4 mana 7/7 with overload 2 was oppressive and now Rogue can put out a 7/7 and a 2/5 on turn 4 that also drew them a card and will spawn yet another 7/7.
---
my n'raji.
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
You‚Äôre so dumb pay attention
---
Why is specifically how the Shaman Galakrond hero power creating bodies what's breaking it instead of say the fact all of the really good Shaman support since the Witchwood has centered around duplicating already strong battlecries?
---
It's not even been a day, let's calm down and let the meta settle. People play shaman because it was an obvious choice with the new galakrond + quest, but i think there will be other decks to challenge that. Maybe some control type deck with a lot of clears, let's just wait for a week or two before demanding nerfs like some people in the comments do
---
Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll be able to defeat him if you smorc with your hero power 1,282 times
---
OMG i hate comments like this. even if they counter me i dont complain about that. that is supposed to happen.  I am complaining since the gameplay i experienced wasnt fun because it was
---
1.RNG heavy 
---
2.Used Bs cards like vendetta (free 4 damage)
---
3.Wasnt fun to watch
---
Hate to break this to you, but human hands *normally* have 5 fingers.
---
This is the same interaction as those spellstones being draw by a cycle card that also did the requirement to be upgraded, like kobold librarian drawing warlock spellstone. This is also the reason why Flash of light didnt upgraded a paladin spellstone when it draws one (because it first heals, then it draws).
---
This is consistent.
---
D‚Äôeathwing
---
I want it as a  gold card so baaaaad but im f2p so im fucked
---
To be fair he was just 1 mana away from winning with the unleash + leroy all gaining +2 attack
---
[[Ferocious Howl]] into [[Jade Spellstone]] interaction.
---
Ferocious Howl would draw a card, and then add the armor, so if you draw the Spellstone, it would upgrade.
---
The same with [[Kobold Librarian]] into [[Amethyst Spellstone]]
---
It draws a card, then deals damage.

Gobi#21337 eu, I'll go first
---
It was on PC
---
I didn‚Äôt even get chance to have a turn in a game before it crashed for me :(
---
Is the Priest Galakrond worse then the Warlock one? I didnt think that was possible
---
Strange thing to say to someone that isn‚Äôt a Pirate Warrior
---
You could kinda break this fight even when it came out. On turn 3 you acidic swamp ooze and mind vision and bam, now you have his weapon. You will definetely win because he doesnt have cards but you do. I have never seen anyone try this and I couldnt because I was poor so idk if it works
---
Do you have a decklist for it? I tried but my Homebrew isn't that great..
---
Dark bomb is 2 mana.
---
I am but that's mostly because my mobile WiFi is garbage.
---
Not disconnecting, but it takes like 5 minutes to load play menu and shop. Probably server issues
---
It bugs me because common only give 1/8 value when sharded
---
Another quality shitcomment
---
Hot.
---
He's not the progenitor, that's just what the aspects made up so that no dragons would do what he did and cannibalize other dragons.
---
You know how can start fixing the broken quest? Limit it to one battlecry just like shudder in battlegrounds and maybe increase it to 8 battlecries instead
---
what the win condition with this deck. how do close out games with this deck.
---
I can make the deck in its entirety, (saved some dust) but not sure if i should. Little bothered about the fact some of the cards will be rotated out in a few months into wild. But then again with the sweet new ability to buy wild cards packs ive got a feeling i should start getting more familiar with wild than just standard

You were thinking platinum?  Or diamond?
---
imagine playing shaman and complaining about a lack of interactive and fun gameplay
---
Somehow I expected it but it still made me laugh so take your upvote, damnit.
---
r/imsorryeveryone
---
Why not include it? Because a number of decks are playing for board early. You often don't get the luxury of spending your entire turn playing a 5/5 that draws you a card.
---
Sure, but when an unrefined deck hovers around the 70% win rate on Day 1, it looks really busted. In memory, best decks on Day 1 were around the 60% mark.
---
A shaman complaining about unfair T4, how ironic.
---
r/fuckshaman
---
bads are bad tho
---
nightmare fuel
---
im dumb, mixing up damage and mana i think. so it makes it bad even by that math, pair that with the fact that it's bad dark bomb (doesn't go face). yeah, they overcosted it by 1 mana, presumably because they were scared of giving hunters strong cards at the time? they didn't really think about class identity that far back.
---
Wild Growth didn't require half your deck to be Dragons. I'd rather have it than the draw tbh.
---
I have a Lewis Carroll Jabberwocky themed deck I'm using that runs Bandersmosh, Muckmorpher, and Shudderwock in the Overload Galakrond package, and it's working really well (so far). He's been really helpful to have in my deck. Is it the most streamlined option? Maybe not, but he's provided me a surprising amount of value on turns 5-8, once you get a Legendary that you need. Add Shudderwock/Sathrovarr for Infinite Shudders and you've got yourself some fun! Muckmorpher is there just for kicks and giggle at the moment. I haven't found an ideal way to use him yet, but he's not bad. I love my Jabberwocky trio!
---
Fuck it im only playing priest and rogue
---
We need a name for this. Like when everyone calls out a meme before the set drops, and that card memes hard.....
---
Sorry. I just realised, it invokes all galakronds, but it doesnt show it when you highligt the card you played.
---
Yeah'sire'rawr
---
*cries in inspire*
---
i dont get it
---
No, you're being childish.
---
Nice.
---
Bird Law Priest‚Ñ¢ is awesome! As you say, not a good deck by any means, but it is fun.
---
When I'm not playing it, I'm losing to it. Sigh, at least the first few hours of the expansion were new and different
---
It‚Äôs just mortal, not necessarily human, right?  Ysera and Alex are elves, chromie is a dwarf, etc.
---
This is disturbing
---
Yup thats correct. As far as im aware they can change into any living being.
---
That was a mistake
---
Guessing same reason Witch's Brew doesn't have echo. Or how in the new set, the word Inspire was forgotten. It's just laziness.
---
Same
---
A zero mana millhouse with a coin attached would be pretty insane in Rogue. I already run wisp as a combo activator.
---
Who is this Y‚Äôsera you speak of?
---
fUn aNd iNtErAcTiVe
---
Millhouse is 2 mana
---
Think about it this way: would an unnerfed doctor boom be able to tackle this deck effectively?
---
I think not.
---
Yeah this is too good to be available for Normal decks lol, it‚Äôs from an ancient solo adventure
---
Priest Gala cancels it, womp womp
---
Saddest story ever
---
&lt;3 it had to be done
---
Alright, good to know.
---
Someone just messaged me to let me know they followed this process and got their packs switched, so a GM should be able to sort it for you.
---
I really like the card and want him to work BUT to me the problem is you sorta have to build the deck around him, because there is not enough natural healing to just make him work in just any sort of druid deck.
---
I really wanted to put him in my druid treant deck (Sort of for flavor) but I realized i'd probably also need to toss in at least 3-4 healing spells to support resummoning him...and there is just no room sadly.
---
Am I retarded or does this make no fucking sense
---
That's not your profile pic
---
i dont know how is this even happening, it says LATEST EXPANSION in the shop, but blizzard should add a warning in the first 2 weeks of a new expansion that warns you if you accidentaly try to buy the wrong packs
---
i got 1 legendary in 30 packs. BUTTTT...that isn't what annoys me.
---
20% of the cards I got were duplicates (more than 2) for dusting. 20%!!!! I'm missing so much of the set.
---
Lol it ain't that serious guys
---
I love the idea of wild. Just don‚Äôt really have any cards for it and I barley have enough for standard
---
They'll sit back and let the meta form for a month and then by that time the new adventure expac will drop, shaking up the meta. And then once shaman dominates again they'll just wait it out until the next expac. 
---
It's crazy how they let this simple card game is so neglected when they can just issue out quick nerfs and buffs. They let control warrior ruin the first half of the year before they finally decided to nerf boom. Everyone knew it was powerful yet they sat on it for literal months. Shaman had a 60%+ play rate and instead of removing evolve they just sat and waited for the wild cards to rotate so the problem can "solve itself".
---
FYI used kobold stickyfingers to steal Frostmourne. After killing the souls he stayed immune and it gave me relentless winter Hero
---
power.
---
Oh no your Deck has a weakness.
---
Priest Gala is infinite value
---
I like em both
---
If ( cardName.indexOf("Ysera") &lt; 0 ) then damage()
---
Done by default maybe? Haha
---
I‚Äôve also thought of the deck as the library (same thing just named differently) from magic the gathering which also makes sense for priest.
---
I think you might be missing the joke
---
Priest Galakrond is the slow, grindy one. That makes all of its invoke cards much worse than the others in effect, really. 
---
Adding an extra priest minion to your hand is a powerful effect in a vacuum in the long game. But in the tempo play, getting 2 1/1s is much stronger, as are basically every other invoke hero powers in tempo. The priest one will thus depend on how good the rest of the deck is at handling that and lengthening the game to where the value generation dominates.
---
It's a tough spot, but basically all you can do as a F2P player in this position is stay on top of your quests and wait for the meta to settle so you can see what your best options are in terms of competitive budget decks. You might have to disenchant a few valuable but impractical cards to accomplish that, but it'll worthwhile in the long run.
---
In the mean time, complete quests with what you have and maybe play Battlegrounds if you get bored.
---
If you cast the Charge spell on a minion and make a copy of it (even if on a subsequent turn), the copy can't attack face on the turn summoned.
---
What‚Äôs that deck list?
---
My tier list on looks for gal

#1 Rogue

#2 Shaman

#3 Warrior

#4 Priest

#5 Warlock

Not with you. You're just here to shut up anyone that isn't happy go lucky about hearthstone. Quit your "entitled whining" about me whining in this sub already. I get it, you have a lot of cards and dust and gold and are very thankful for your netdecks. The state of the game is just peachy and I'm just bad at resource management because I don't netdeck. Powercreep isn't a real or concerning trend in TCGs. My cards that were strong two sets ago are obsolete now, as they should be. Praise our corporate overlords and their sworn defenders on Reddit. You're doing the Lord's work. Keep smashing that downvote button and you will be blessed with golden legendaries and 100 gold quests. You are the White Knight that blizzard needs in this dire hour.
---
Yes. I probably am, I have never played WOW or whatever it's called
---
Do you have a screenshot of what you‚Äôre talking about?  Never heard of a cooldown on a mode.
---
I did this as well but gave up after 100 which I‚Äôd figured was the threshold after nothing before it did the trick.
---
Ok, tavern brawl, wtf? First game I tried not hitting Dalaran as I realized health went up. I lost. 2nd game tried hitting instead. Had him up to 754 "health", I'd exhausted his deck and made mine nearly infinite with Jade idols and dragon dream portals, that windfury weapon that replenishes too. Full board, summon legendary deathrattle on deck + in hand. Poisonous rush snakes on deck and in hand, and he's drawing 10+ damage and counting every turn while I'm sitting at 30 health/25 armour leisurely debating what to sacrifice to make room and wondering how long I'll be stuck here, what I need to satisfy to win and üí•BOOMüí• we both implode. Defeat!? 754 "decorations placed", 85 defenders defeated, no win, no pack. (Did not play 7 murloc card, neither did he, he had no cards)
---
Ya I think the rush needs to go.
---
I think of priest steal as if they are missionaries converting the enemy to their side.
---
We have found reddit's favorite card of the expansion
---
The only solo adventures that reward packs are the dalaran heist and tombs of terror, but unfortunately they cost a lot of gold or real money to get. As far as grinding to get packs, it's really just do your dailies, win as many games as you can, and beat the tavern brawl every week for a free classic pack (most of the time, sometimes they have different rewards). One thing to note however is since the most recent change to daily quests, getting gold is easier than ever. 60g quests are much more common, as well as a lot easier, but if you hit the arrow to reroll them, they'll give you an even easier quest, but it'll always be 50g, so just take what they give you. With that and a few wins, it's not too hard to get 100 gold per day.
---
You get her from a bundle, not on her own
---
Paladin not even on the list. Seriously ho did they think the highlander and explorer cards would rival the Galakronds? It's been 2 and a half years since Tarim was printed. Just give us another powerful legendary.
---
It's a package hero, I don't know if it's splitting hairs or not so here it is.
---
Damn!!!! I had it too!
---
I didnt get shit in my packs
---
Only‚Ñ¢
---
The new expansion-adventures do grant you card packs that you can use. There are currently 5 of those that grant Standard packs: Monster Hunt, Puzzle Lab, Rumble Run, Dalaran Heist, and Tombs of Terror.
---
I've been doing the same. I really enjoy Battlegrounds, it's a fun change of pace and it's nice to pick a different strategy every game without having to remake a whole deck. I've done all my quests that can't be done in Battlegrounds in Tavern Brawls. I've always enjoyed the unique experience of each brawl.
---
I did find out the other day that for the 'win x-number of games' quest, you can get credit for getting 4th or higher in a Battleground game. That was a pleasant surprise.
---
Then I got to the turn limit and lost? How the hell do I beat this game mode?
---
It‚Äôs a really frustrating brawl for sure.
---
Okay, i'm curious.  Do you have a link to the VOD/clip?
---
I wonder if there was anything else weird going on.
---
What
---
Stuff you can't interact with is the parasite of any card game.
---
No Brawliseum this time? I hope it's not entirely ditched.
---
The new dragon for Shaman is straight up better than Flamewreathed Faceless for the same cost in most decks and it's still probably not good enough to see play.
---
Blizzards wants to stay consistent more op= more cooler art
---
bruh
---
What keywords and stuff did you do to try and find the source? I wanna find the source for Azure Explorer.
---
Small sample size but in 10 games I only played it once. It's a big swing, especially if you've already played your fully Invoked Galakrond, but the majority of games I played were more or less decided by turn 8. In a longer match, it is probably an essential refuel, but if you don't have it try running the deck with a substitution (I'm running a version with neither the 5 mana 5/4 make a copy of this, nor Cumulo Maximus, either of which would be welcome additions).
---
ryuk looking handsome
---
Yes.
---
I got like 7 epics in 90 packs lol..
---
You don‚Äôt need em anyway. Just play old quest shaman and sub in the free Gal package, doesn‚Äôt that sound fun? /s
---
Rogue has a ton of powerful interactions and cards right now. I expect that the rogue win rate will increase significantly as the expansion goes on. Eventually, someone will build the optimal tempo miracle rogue list and it will beat most decks.
---
This popped up when I looked up big ol whelp on Google. It was I think the 2nd or 3rd image
---
I'd change it so it's like Dr. Boom's hero power where it rotates each turn so even though it's random you know which totem you will get.
---

---
Mods want to pretend the crashes are not happening.
---
and this was said about many decks on day 1 that fizzled out or settled in to be a part of the meta
---
Does this mean we will have a Ysera tribal eventually?
---
It's very bizarre they got the best of the new cards by a long shot. Aside from the fact that they have the best quest and any deck can autocomplete it. How come no other class has a good double invoke card? You need great draw luck or have to run bad cards to max the others. I dont get it.
---
Not entirely, but yeah we're skipping it for this launch. Working to be sure the issues we had last time in 15.6 are fully resolved.

You can check it out here, https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Descent_of_Dragons_full_art
---
Not every full art is on this website but this is basically most of the expansion, maybe it‚Äôs just me idk
---
He asked which heroes gets added and that sure is a hero that gets added to the existing heroes
---
Shudderwock costs 9, even with double hero power in play you'd still only be able to summon 2 8/8s... that is unless you can make the hero power cost 1 or shudderwock cost 8, is that possible?
---
I personally didn't like to see the keyword go, but I understood their reasoning for the changes. Whenever you're working on a long term creative project with multiple people collaborating and providing input like this it's important to have a set of design standards to either adhere to or strive towards. That can cover things as simple as keywords. The goal being that way you maintain some control and avoid chancing part or all of the project turning into a mess.
---
[Hsreplay.net](https://Hsreplay.net) a few hours ago. It's 55.3% right now tho.
---
Nah it's usually pretty week. I beat like 5 in a row last night with my Paladin Paladin list. It tries to steamroll the beginning but if you can withstand it and keep warlock off the board it goes pretty well.
---
Pravwlum#1796 80g NA Quest trade. I‚Äôll show, you go first please.
---
what card is that?
---
In the highlander shaman deck I am playing on ladder, I do run the quest.  So much fun, huge turns.  If you draw the discount dragons by 2 before Alexstrasza, you can double her battlecry for 4 0 cost dragons which often have battlecries themselves.  It's awesome
---
I picked Rexxar mostly because I‚Äôve been only playing highlander hunter before this expansion. Also it‚Äôs usually seen as the ‚Äùcheapest‚Äù deck most of the time.
---
Krnox in today quest pack.
---
Thanks Blizzard. &lt;3
---
Of course, but he‚Äôd only cycled 7 cards by that point. So it wasn‚Äôt likely. 
---
I‚Äôd make that play every time as the Rogue. When you can make a huge Edwin, you do!
---
It literally has "for the rest of the game" in its text, I don't see the bait here?
---
what's so insane to me is how they had all these different galkarond effects and galkarond activators and they just so obviously gave the best of each to the class that was already the best class
---
And what's worse is that it pretty much isn't like there are cards from Year of the Raven that enable the deck. 
---
Lifedrinker/Shudderwock will rotate in 4 months, but that won't matter because the core of the (the quest and Galakrond) pretty much win the game before Shudderwock ever becomes relevent.
---
I feel disgusted when my opponent drops a 5 mana 7/5 with 4 power of that having rush no drawback no setup just overstated as fuck.
---
Or when they feel really spicey and just complete their entire galakrond with a single one with the quest.
---
Or perhaps when they just play a 5 mana 10/12 and I wonder why i even tried to play a class that has to tap the first few turns to get big plays.
---
How do you even win this? I don't know how to deal 30 damage to the face without being harassed by all their invocations and buffs
---
Omg it‚Äôs gorgeous
---
Idk what's the point of this brawl? I got 1100 DMG and died because of fatigue but still got my pack...
---
Hold my decorations\~ [https://imgur.com/a/OwhwrFT](https://imgur.com/a/OwhwrFT) I capped the number of turns possible QQ
---
It‚Äôs gorgeous
---
r/subsifellfor
---
Exactly. So I try to refrain from dismantling more cards from those classes even tho I barely have any cards from earlier expansions
---
Don't leave shirvallah on the board against rogue, specifically because of this.
---
I want to see a game where burgle rogue generates a random shirvallah so they can ~~kill~~ delete it even when the paladin plays around it.
---
That can't be true. Epics also have a pity timer - once per 10 packs. So, in the worst-case scenario, you had to get at least 9 epics.
---
It has to be an aura. Dalaran got two of the taunt dudes back into his hand from Duplicate, and when he played them they gained double the weapon attack in health. One for the aura, and another for the battle cry.
---
Why would she give you 1600 dust, the card wasn‚Äôt nerfed.
---
I think the problem is the community here and idk if there's any way to change it. Maybe reddit in general is too toxic or it's because gaming attracts a certain type of fan but all video-game subreddits seem to be completely full of people that hate the devs and the game they play. The only discussion you're going to get here is people moaning and complaining about the cost, the meta, blizzard, other players. They're pretty good at keeping most of it out of the competive sub but even there some of the hyperbole can be fairly silly. A pinned discussion thread probably wouldn't fix anything.
---
14 cards. He starts as a 2-2, and the combo/battlecry was doubled. Without the shark on board, he‚Äôd have been a 30-30.
---
Or, combined with spirit of shark, 10 face and 10 heal.
---
So basically, you're waiting to just net deck? Wow.
---
As of right now we don't know. But that would be a major change if it wasn't.
---
And, I imagine, the pitchforks would come out in droves.
---
I like how these quests were supposed to be lower investment and deck building from what I heard.
---
And they were but they also have just better rewards then the old heavy investment ones and are some get completed by turn 7 every game while being a death knight level of overpoweredness
---
Dang I actually got windfury that turn from the treasure chest so I hit just over 3000 too
---
I would recommend just buying the cheaper expansion option when they come out as opposed to buying packs every week, as well as the special bundles that occasionally are released. 20$ a week is around 1k annually, whereas even buying the more expensive bundle every expansion would be less than 300 a year.
---
Ah, sorry, didn‚Äôt see him. Thanks for the reply üôÇ
---
It was indirectly nerfed. Blizzard changed it so Echo cards couldn‚Äôt be reduced to 0 Cost. To compensate those who crafted Glinda for their decks (so basically just Snip-Snap Warlock) she was given the full dust refund that is offered for nerfed cards.
---
'new meta'  
---
Shaman meta has been meta for the last couple months.
---
100 packs... 331/500 duplicates. 5 Legendary
---
Yes i regret.
---
Keep reporting BLZBNTBGS80000011(2) now. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on here. Kicked out when the travern brawl game ended
---
Anyone has a deck so I can complete this pls? Thanks!
---
It was needed, they changed how echo works and said in a blogpost they will be giving full dust refunds for her
---
How exactly does that stowaway guy work? You draw 2 cards not in your deck... but the waxy cards count as actual cards that it can draw?
---
neq#2775 quest trade on EU 80g. I ll show, you go 1st.
---
i simply don't understand the design team: shaman going into the set was the best class. the invoker cards for shaman are undeniably the best when you look at some of the shitty ones for warlock or the other classes. the hero power is also the best, though some of the other ones have uses getting a 2/1 with rush for free is the most versatile. and then the battlecry, which is just batshit crazy.
---
who's man
---
Blizzard ruined her art and voice lines, she will not be missed
---
You must have hit the turn limit. After either 30 or 50 turns (I‚Äôm not entirely sure which) both players self-destruct and it counts as a loss for all.
---
No worries. Sounds like you need to go and have a play with Rogue. It‚Äôs a very fun class to experiment with silly or powerful strategies.
---
Screw the meta, find something you love
---
Is this the new silverback patriarch?
---
Dust is scarce for me atm so I don‚Äôt want to craft a deck which later pans out to be bad. That‚Äôs all. Also I always try to quickly reach rank 5, for which I need a good deck for.
---
Yeah, the exact posts that I'm talking about that get BURIED. We need a main sticky, so that people don't have to make a new thread like this every single time they want to have a discussion that doesn't warrant a new thread. You want 600 discussion posts or 1 discussion thread bud?
---
I thought the opponent would be overloaded to shit the next turn after they played their bs double invoke card.
---
That shit is just a straight up 7/5 in stats with 4 power being rush I have no idea how that is supposed to be even remotely fair.
---
That's a fair point of view.
---
Even without shudder and lifedrinkers. Shaman can get a very powerful galakrond deck with the quest. So I don‚Äôt see a problem when Witchwood etc rotate
---
I wonder what the default card is.  Probably a wisp or something.
---
same. and how do you win exactly?
---
Which barely sees play because Dragon Shaman isn't even played because Overload/Quest are just too good.
---
They changed how echo works and sais that both glinda, non golden snip snap and ring the bells would be disenchantable for full dust.
---
I dissenchanted my glinda for 1600 dust, but seems others dont have that option for some reason.
---
Lol i only played shaman and therefore didn‚Äôt even know that this is a thing. Really weird tbh..
---
That page is rarely accurate in my experience... Makes much more sense to look at the current popular decks' winrates. E.g. Rogue actually has a very solid, possibly tier 1, archetype right now, yet is shown 3rd to last there.
---
Just aggro them down with galakrond pirate warrior. Or I guess aggro shaman if you are a degenerate.
---
But can it summon 4 8/8‚Äôs with rush and equip a 5/2 weapon??
---
Also Kibler was playing it in his Token Druid deck.
---
you can silence them though
---
&gt; Play around with the cards you have
---
Rank 20 players have full net decks and this expansion's power level is enormous
---
I think I'm just going to take a break until the next rotation (again) and see if anything changes
---
Anduin has a voice line in HOTS I think about beating you with your own minions lmao
---
Deathrattle Rogue and Quest Hunter do well against them. That being said, I don't recommend Deathrattle Rogue, the current lists are painfully unrefined and I have no idea how anyone even got to rank 5 with them, let alone rank 1 legend lol. Still tryna figure it out.
---
So I used [[Azari, the Devourer]] destroying the cities deck and didn't trigger the last draw effect. Did like 3k damage, went to the turn limit, we both exploded and I did not get my free pack. I already have the card back from a long time ago.

---
Ok cool?
---
Not the most powerful deck nor will it probably end up being once the meta settles, no need to nerf.
---
No joke, my 2 biggest HS regrets ever are dusting a duplicate Yogg (before the nerf/full refund) and dusting Majordomo Executus. When Un'goro rolled around I ended up recrafting Domo and somehow I don't regret it

I feel like shaman is getting blown out of proportion. Yes it is strong but not that strong. I have played a couple games with it just to see if I would steamroll people and for the most part I am getting farmed but Reno mage and rogues.
---
I'm F2P too and my policy is always to craft 1 legendary at launch so I can play a new deck I want, then wait until week 2 before crafting anything else.
---
I had a really terrible experience with this brawl.
---
My first game went pretty well,I did way over 1000 damage and I could have almost gone infinite. Then I hit the turn limit and the game tied, not granting me a win.
---
At that point I had already wasted over 30 minutes on this brawl without getting the card pack. I just wanted to get a quick win after that, but after about 10 more minutes, when the AI stole my stupid murloc treasure card, it broke the game and tied again (note that I didn't even play the bugged card myself, the game just hates me).
---
I had to first come here to find out that you only have to do 30 damage and then pass for a few rounds. Well at least I got it now.
---
TL;DR: Game tied twice, wasting about 40 minutes of my time.
---
Not at all. They shifted a lot of the anchor cards to legendary (instead of legendary being the sort of meme tier). In particular, this expansion and last expansion (Uldum) are very very very expensive due to the sheer amount of legendaries needed across the board.
---
If you get Arena skills you will actually win more gold than you lose AND get a pack each time.
---
craft Gruul Golden !
---
I actually was so pumped because i tought we could at least get a tier 2 deck... and Zetalot deck was the best deck of priest I tried. I feel so sad for priest right now.
---
What Rogues? I have fought a lot of rogues and havent seen a single one with something that seems to out of the ordinary. The Shaman Quest though feels even worse to play against than it already was.
---
Same. The set up I ended up with couldn't lose.
---
The turn limit not counting as a win was annoying though.
---
I'm testing Stowaway/Pogo Rogue right now, with the final intention of combining with the small Deathrattle Package of Waxadred/Apothecary in a a tempo shell. Should be obvious whats it about. If the meta stays this slow (outside of Shaman and Pirate warrior), I'll be fine =)
---
ohhh yes its basically impossible due to divine shield - got it
---
1 mana 2/1 rush and freeze? Sems dumb dropping that, that's a strong card.
---
Nah. They have enough ways to do the same thing for less mana, what with lackeys and invoke
---
Hell yes brother. There's dozens of us!!
---
I feel you about the powerlevel, since a higher powerlevel means a bigger gap between what can work and what can't. Kobolds soured my enjoyment of the game and I think a lot of the cards in DoD have some obnoxious statlines considering their effects (that would never fly a few years ago). Still though, Whizbang or some Galakrond decks might be worth a shot.
---
Everytime a paladin has dropped that early ive been able to swing the game as well tho never this hard lmao.
---
But you can put both in your deck. And one doesn't rotate out. That's worth at least rush.
---
I've been playing since Beta, and I've made a point to keep and craft every RNG-based card available to Mage.
---
Counting things like Discover as RNG too; because the generated cards are random; you just choose from the pool.
---
I currently am playing a Singleton version of Casino Mage in wild. Every single card in the deck has a random element. With the new random Dragon-based cards I might make a Dragon-Random Mage for this Expansion. But I don't have the cards yet.
---
Current Version runs [All x1]:
---
Arcane Missiles; Babbling Book; Magic Trick; Flamecannon; Mana Cyclone; Primordial Glyph; Recombobulator; Shimmering Tempest; Unstable Portal; Cinderstorm; Drakkari Trickster; Dune Sculptor; Flamewaker; Messenger Raven; Spellslinger; Vulpera Scoundrel; Archmage Vargoth; Kazakus; Vex Crow; Etheral Conjurer [Probobly gonna replace him for the new neutral 5 drop dragon that gives random spells]; Nexus-Champion Saraad; Faceless Summoner; Reno the Relicologist; Toki Time Tinkerer; Firelands Portal; Power of Creation; Ragnaros the Firelord; Kalecgos; Puzzle Box of Yogg-Saron; Yogg-Saron Hope's End.
---
Hilarious thing is the deck generates *so many extra cards* it tends to  out-value many other decks at this point. There's a lot of other RNG cards I could have added, but I've loaded up with a lot of 'generates random cards' for sheer attrittion. Also makes it basically impossible for the other player to predict.
---
The fact that it's not a tcg and you can't trade your cards
---
how are you meant to play them?
---
Same here, I can't afford to craft stuff until I'm sure I'm getting a good deck out of it.  I have reasonable back collections for Paladin, Druid, Warlock, and Mage but not as much the other classes so I'm ideally looking for one of those.
---
I've got 6k dust saved up but it goes *fast*.
---
So... you're a better Priest Player than Zetalot?
---
Wow, cool interaction
---
I'm talking meta, and you're talking pure card value. Again, a lot of decks don't care about the stats which you are insisting on. Right now the meta is too aggro/too shaman heavy. Putting the game out of reach for your opponent by T6 is the norm. E.g. Vs a Brazen Zealot or Skyclaw on T4 or T5 (Using my deck as example and what works well against me), the 2/2 rush is way way more effective than a 4/5 taunt body, even on T5 itself. 
---
If you can't see how a 2/2 rush (or 4/3 rush for Shaman) disrupts Aggro-Tempo Paladin / Priest / Rogue / Warlock / Warrior, compared to a 4/5 taunt, then I'll leave it at that.
---
&gt;Except damage is always more flexible. No matter what 3 damage goes off. 
---
You can't hit things other than face with Lifedrinker. That's not very flexible at all.
---
What deck other than Quest Shaman is using Lifedrinker?
---
&gt;Shaman even if they don't bounce it does 12 damage and healing if they double both battle cries for a total of 10 mana and gets 2 3/3 bodies. 
---
1. Bounce effects are not played in Shaman.
---
2. I would hope a Quest deck of some sort could make a play like that by turn ten. Otherwise, why even use the Quest?
---
3. Face damage that isn't quickly leading to a win is a waste of cards and mana. Otherwise, Mind Blast and Sinister Strike would be two of the most played cards ever.
---
4. Shaman has always had pretty cheap and efficient Healing options.
---
   1. Healing Rain
---
   2. Healing Wave
---
   3. Jinyu Waterspeaker
---
   4. Witch's Brew
---
5. Slow control decks should have counters
---
From my experience i just find it as a desperate measure to try and get a game back from a losing position and this version of the deck can contest the board early and there just isn't a reason to include it in the deck (tested around 10 games but every single time i regretted including it)

Plus a stack of the interactions are broken or bugged to fuck.

[Very next game](https://imgur.com/139Lms9)
---
Cards that invoke twice are no good if the shaman Gala still only needs two to upgrade.
---
Even worse when it summons two 2/1 with rush. 
---
Even worse when that leads to TWO 8/8s with rush.
---
Even worse when quest is active.
---
Even worse when Shudderwock is used.
---
Even worse with two 5/6 wolf taunts with no overload. 
---
Genuinely how did this all get approved? Like there‚Äôs some cards that are nuts sure, but this isn‚Äôt even fun or interactive.
---
I liked Ball of Spiders.
---
I mean Webspinner itself wasn't a great card, but it was one of my first Goldens and it means something to me.
---
Still trash though.
---
Highlander decks are some of the most expensive decks in the game. That's why most people aren't playing them.
---
I respect the "It's just day 1" sentiment, but sometimes you just know. Experienced players can use the eye test. You can see the profound amount of broken stuff a deck can do, and know there's no real counter.
---
I'd genuinely be shocked if Shaman isn't ninja nerfed within 2 weeks. Blizzard can't let everyone get disillusioned that quickly at this point. The only question is if the nerf they choose will be enough.
---
Haha, I thought *my* lines were bad.
---
Sick. I got 350 or something on my first try and thought it was good, but this is insane. What deck did you use?
---
It's good, most legendaries are pretty good with it. I got Al'Akir from it(although, in a friendly) and it was extremely threatening. Better Al'Akir and I had 5 mana left to spend.
---
You can generally get a good legendary but the problem is the randomness+mana cost. If you get a trash legendary with this on 5, and a good one on 6, you've wasted a lot of mana just by saving it one turn(6 mana total). It's  weird to play on curve or with other cards and it's hard to plan ahead with it.
---
That being said, though, it's really good to get Zilliax, Hi'reek, Al'Akir, either Alexstrasza(in some situations), either Malygos(in the right deck), Murozond, the new 3 drop Priest legendary etc.
---
It's just a matter of luck....
---
You legitimately just have to hope they don't draw well. That is the only hope.
---
I made that joke when playing Bandersmosh yesterday. :(
---
The counter to quest-shaman has always been aggro/tempo decks, same as last expansion. 
---
Also, not sure what you mean by late game, but you can clear 4x 8/8s with rush as Hunter?
---
This has been a thing in hearthstone for years, why are you even here?
---
Gyrocopter is still not a good arena pick. A 100 on the Lightforge tierlist is the average of all the cards in the arena. An average card in your deck is around a 120. So sure, it's not a terrible pick for your deck, but I wouldn't call it good.
---
I hit 2807 with jade then hit turn limit. No pack. Rip.
---
You can add me if you want Tyche#21238
---
Every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes.
---
I opened 107 packs and got 6 legendaries, and 16 epics, two of which were golden. I also ended up with around 2200 dust. Legendaries were Ysera, Flik Skyshiv, Zzeraku, Ancharrr, Frizz Kindleroost, &amp; Alexstraza. 
---
Not sure how good any of those are, but I was happy to get at least one legendary for a class I actually play (Flik). Most of my class-specific legendaries usually end up being for Pally, Mage, and Warlock and I never play those classes. I've been tempted to dust some of those cards, especially my golden legendary copies of Raid the Sky Temple &amp; Malygos, but I hate dusting legendaries even if I don't play the class.
---
I dealt over 1,000 damage with my C'thun Druid but then the game ended in a tie due to turn limit and I didn't get any reward. Definitely worth the half hour.
---
what mode is this?
---
Deck auto complete uses historical data of the highest win rate decks that matches with already selected cards and what you have in your collection.
---
No surprise it's useless in the first day, as it doesn't have any data on the new cards yet.
---
*cries in warlock*
---
Why must he have such smoll arms :/
---
Exactly my point they wonder why their player base has been dwindling.
---
You clear the 4x 8/8 with the quest hero power + swarm of locusts/shu'ma, or Veranus/unleash, while also developing threats. Shaman doesn't seem to have a ton of removal.
---
Flik seems to be Rogue's only hope against Shaman slamming down 4  8/8s.
---
