A lot of the plague lords have multiple \[\[Plague of Death\]\] cards. It's super unfun...
---
Yeah, but why would you need other 2-mana minions? You have a bunch of low-mana spells instead.
---
Show me popular lists that ran more than Apprentices, Cyclone or Khadgar anyway?
---
So your argument is rather fallacious, because you DON'T need other two drops. It's not an either/or argument, you're not running Frog NO MATTER WHAT.

No one is running Frog. It doesn't make the cut.

Tempo decks are happy to get board shots in.  The real difference, obvious as it may be, is 2 shots vs 1.  
---
* Flamewaker hitting minions twice is  strictly better than Frog.
---
* Flamewaker hitting face once and minion once is also strictly better than Frog.
---
* Flamewaker hitting face twice is not necessarily better than Frog, but it is significant free damage to move towards lethal range with your burn spells.  It's usually better than Frog.
---
Yea I can see the fun in making mana addict huge. But I never liked how it fizzles at end of turn.
---
Your comment is very helpful, I am very grateful.
---
But it seems that you have not read my supplement carefully. I have always stressed that Netease's attitude and behavior are extremely bad. They ban players according to the wrong criteria, but reject the demands of these innocent players. I never asked Blizzard to unblock me immediately, nor did I ask everyone to believe me immediately. I hope that Blizzard knows about this and then comes forward to solve it.
---
And yet the one time I needed one of them to have one, they didn't (all 7 slots on my board were taken up by the 4/8 tree that goes dormant when it dies, through a series of unfortunate events.)
---
It was the anomaly that adds a copy of a minion to your deck upon death, and the crook and flail treasure kept grabbing them and hadronox. I could revive them fine but they're useless against the boss's 300/300 that keep healing with health swap.
---
Yeah Flamewaker will be back in Standard, including ranked.

I believe it starts on Tuesday Oct 8 and runs until the next expansion (mid-December).

It absolutely should come as a surprise when people are playing a card that blizzard put into the game, within the limits of what the game allows, while not using cheats. What kind of low bar are we setting for a multi billion dollar company to not even have to fix their games when they break them and then chastise the people who are wrongly banned over it? I hope you get your account back, OP.

In your last comment you said that you are used to not rank much. If you use a meta deck then you can easily get past rank 5 mark.

I didn't say currently. Prior to June, Mage had no tier 1 or tier 2 decks in the format. https://teamrankstar.com/hearthstone-wild-meta-snapshot-june-2019/

The fact that flamewalker can hit face, makes the card infinitely better then the frog. Without enemy minions on board, dart frog is useless. If flamewalker could only target minions, that card would be almost as useless as well. (You could argue that doing 2 damage makes the card way better then dart frog). If dart frog could hit face however, it would def see play in tempo and vomit mage decks.
---
But it's just 0-mana gain health (from eating food), doesn't impact the board, won't see play, 1 star card

The first time I got one of Bob‚Äôs deck I was excited, then I used the card that‚Äôs 2 mana and draws a card and 2 copies and makes them cost 0. This was my turn 2 play, into Crystal Core. I think they included that just to break hearts and ruin hand size.
---
Op thought zephyrus lamp was special or rare. They are mistaken it is sack of lamps that has a special trigger
---
Brightwing is still gonna be mediocre even when Rag and Sylva come back
---
Isn't bulking up a good thing for body?
---
Naga sea witch was more intuitive before hand I think.
---
And same with summoning portal not helping to lower something below 1.
---
That change made things less intuitive, not more. It did lower spaghetti code a bit though.
---
Is that the treasure that makes you draw extra each turn? That thing is OP with the treasure that reduces the cost of cards in your hand by 1 each time you play an odd cost card. Basically you play evertyhing for free and draw so much that bosses just can't keep up with you
---
Not actually, depends on the deck. Playing all your cards against the plague lords ASAP isn't always the best choice, and until you get there, it's gonna take some work.

Having a slow connection like I often do in my small American town (sometimes as low as 2.5 Mbs) can also give the impression that they're roping purposefully when in reality, they're waiting for the game to actually log their actions and let them perform the next one.

&gt; **their historical pattern of gutting every decent Mage archetype.** 
---
BRM Tempo Mage wasn't touched despite rivaling Patron Warrior.
---
MSoG Secret Mage wasn't touched.
---
Arcaneologist, the best Mage two drop ever, was never changed during its time in Standard.
---
Explosive Runes, perhaps the best Secret generally, was never changed during its time in Standard.
---
Un'Goro saw three separate and highly competitive Mage archetypes, none of which were targeted by card changes.
---
Big Spell Mage, despite being a consistently irritating match to play against when their cards line up right, was never touched while Frost Lich Jaina was Standard legal.
---
Odd Secret Mage went onto be one of the better decks of RR format by the end of it if I am remembering correctly.
---
The only "historical precedence" for gutting Mage decks is changing Mana Wyrm at an awkward time and the simultaneous changes to Conjurer's Calling and Luna's Pocket Galaxy, which on a macroscale were necessary.
---
Team 5's balance team does not have it out for Mage.

I've 300-0'd the plague lords with the pogo deck three times now (it's the ONLY deck I've gotten from Bob).  I don't normally get much card draw, but it isn't really needed to win... the enemy decks aren't really easily able to deal with you continually throwing down stuff like 21/21+ each turn.

That's a good point actually, I didn't think of that.

---
Oh that makes sense, thanks.:)
---
But another new card called **SI:7 Infiltrator** is often given when you are facing secrets, so I think the reason Gift of the Wild is not given is not that it's a new card and therefore not considered, but just that the designers consider it to be too weak. But I don't think it that weak.
---
There are over a thousand existing properties currently that can be applied to any given entity, including every card in game. [Here are some of the known ones](https://github.com/HearthSim/python-hearthstone/blob/master/hearthstone/enums.py#L8-L421), but there are many more. Every tag can be specified for every card, but most of them are left unset at a default value. And for this purpose, you'd only need to override the cardback for the two cards that get swapped, rather than specifying it for every one.
---
Is Blizzard actually just the Chinese government?  They call Taiwan "Chinese Taipei" in the Overwatch League.  They censor their art according to Chinese censorship rules.  They delete interviews with players that support democracy.
---
I am amazed that Chinese propagandists have convinced Americans that we should be censoring pro-democracy messages.  Hello!?  This is what we fucking _live for_.
---
There's also a slight randomness to it.  If you've ever played Wild, using Brann Bronzebeard with Zephyrs doesn't always give you the exact same outcome, despite zero change (other than +1 hand size) between discovers.
---
We know that a turn 2 Zephyrs vs an empty board always offers Wild Growth, Brightwing, and Animal Companion.  And if the opponent already has a 3/2, it will offer Backstab instead of Brightwing.
---
But once the game gets going, Zephyrs considers hand size, life totals, board states, etc.  It may offer you AoE, heal, card draw, weapon removal, VanCleef, etc.  The more complicated the game, the more varied it gets.
---

The word you're looking for is "yikes".
---
Blizzard isn't alone. Many large companies are censoring posts because they are in support of the Hong Kong protests. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets in the NBA might even get fired for tweeting in support of the protests. The players are normally open to discussion and argue about the social issues in the US, but when China enters the scene, everyone has to back down. China is such a massive economic hub in the world that they will succumb to their authoritarian system no matter the consequences, and their market share creates too large of a presence for anybody to ignore. Despite how they claim to be "progressive", they constantly abuse their power to shut down things they don't like. Blizzard, like all other corporations, is insignificant compared to all of China; they have no choice.
---
No reason to go all defensive! Not everyone can win too often :)
---
It would have cost you exactly 0 dollars not to create this monstrosity
---
The new south park episode covers this issue S23 E02, its pretty funny
---
Back on my first time seeing it in a match, I was confused
---

---
Arcane missiles? Okay I can sort of see the potential...
---
Coin too?
---

---
Holy crap my board got cleared by 6 Mana and he got a 2/4 which threatens to do it again"
---
A epic card, this is very rare
---
If you support something, surely you'd want to use your platform to talk about it.
---
Otherwise what's the point?
---
I had a wax rager card and deathrattles triggers twice passive I thought I would win easily but I died at the 4th boss
---
5
---
Yes, because China still has a lot of the aesthetic of old "communist" regimes (which already didn't follow the principles of communism but became authoritarian regimes).
---
They also don't know what socialism or liberalism are.
---
Sure, but defending gay rights in the USA is not exactly a road to martyrdom anymore.
---
Don't get me wrong, having companies stand for gay rights is nice and all, but you shouldn't be tricked into believing it means those companies are actually willing to make a stand for whats right. All those movies that are "'x movie' reboot, but this time the protagonist is gay/black/a woman" are only happening because Hollywood expects to make money out of them.
---
Defending human rights in Hong Kong doesn't lure in costumers and locks off a pretty huge market though, so that ain't happening.
---
Doesn't really qualify as BIG if it doesn't have Gruul.
---
Yao Ming brought a lot of attention to the NBA back when he was playing and with that the sport grew within the chinese community.
---
Golden dragon friends. FeelsGoodMan
---
meanwhile gay people and other minorities are put into essentially concentration camps in china so....
---
To prevent AOE is so intelligent that I don't think Zephrys is smart enough, but this is a good angle to consider this question. :D
---
Exactly this. 
---
I know I'm getting political, but this is also why Trump's beef with China is so relevant. If Trump can loosen China's grasp on the market, firms no longer have to be so scared of China, and this can potentially snowball into pressuring China down to a much more reasonable size. People sometimes forget that Blizzard is a company that wants to make money, and sometimes that comes with a cost. Now, whether this a rash decision or a wise precaution is not to my discretion, but at least it makes sense why this happened.
---
Blizzard included, of course.

---
What the hell is this comment?
---
We're not talking about what they have "The right" to do. Of course they have the right to take it down.
---
Just like you have the right to make stupid comments and defend abhorrent behaviour, doesn't mean you are doing the right thing, and doesn't mean it's not also political commentary.
---
What if Reddit started deleting your comments because you have a different view than I do? You'd start to think Reddit had a political agenda here. You'd probably think Reddit was a bit of a shitty company for doing that. They have the right though, so I guess it's all okay if they do?
---
You seem to be confusing "having the right" to do something with "doing the right thing", and that's just a poor baseline for any argument that is at it's core, an issue on morality.
---
Just stop. You're clearly here to solely be a contrarian, and as I said, no one respects that. You have no substance and you're actively against a good cause.
---
Ok... so you want to change the meaning of freedom of speech and linked an opinion article as your evidence? The article even says that it's definition is nebulous at best. 
---
The only freedom of speech that is protected by law is freedom from the government restricting protected speech. That's it. End of discussion. You can get sad when a company decides to remove the comment you posted on their forums that they pay to keep running, but there's nothing illegal about it, and there shouldn't be. 
---
Think of it this way. If you bought and put up a giant board in the middle of town and someone came up and started putting messages on that board you didn't like, you should have the ability to remove those messages from your board. You bought it, you paid for it, you can control what's seen on it. No one else has a right to control what content shows up on that board regardless of whether or not you allow other people to put stuff on it. Now what can't happen, is for the government to come up and tell you that there's something on that board they don't like and you have to remove it. That's what's protected by the constitution. 
---
If freedom of speech meant that corporations couldn't control their own message boards, message boards wouldn't exist. Why would they pay for and manage a forum that they can't control?
---
Is this type of censorship troubling? Yes. Should we try to do something about it as consumers? Yes. But let's not muddle our culture's understanding of freedom of speech any further than it already is.
---
Am i wrong to think this move was correct? There a time and place for everything. You re here to talk about hearthstone not about something unrelated. If you want to support whatever go to the right channels and do it.
---
Zeph analyses the current boardstate. He doesnt know matchups, overall gamestate (beside what is just there). So if you want to understand what he will give you, then you need to look at the current board situation. AND ONLY that. The problem is that player think more than that and then dont understand why they get certain cards.
---
In the first example your opponent can trade his minion against your 2/2, which is really bad for both tempo and value. Because your HP is low(er) he will prefer taunt over pure stats. Argus has good value and makes your overall board situation better and protects you from face damage. The Elemental protects both of your minions and your face, its a great counter. The game works with math and mathematical logic. From the cards that are avaible, these seem to best for this exact board, without a higher understanding of the game state.
---
The Gorehowl seems to give you the highest damage output with the mana you have. The devs said that they always try to give you cards with different 'goals', for example pure value or simply reach damage. 
---
Keep in mind: Your intellectual logic isnt the logic that Zeph is using. Try to think with his logic.
---
Absolutely. Ever since one of the Chinese players became very big in the NBA he basically became an idol for the Chinese youth. Basketball has been popular ever since. This was several years ago.
---
&gt; They censor their art according to Chinese censorship rules.
---
Don't take this as defense of Blizzard here, but this is just wrong. Unless I've missed something, China has had its own art for certain problem cards for a long time before the recent art changes, which has never been implemented in other regions - meaning the art on other regions doesn't matter to China - and the recent changes weren't even implemented on the China region, which makes it rather obvious the changes had nothing to do with China.
---
The changes were very clearly about making the game more kid-friendly (even if it was for appeasing their parents instead of the kids themselves). Blizzard and China are very clearly in the wrong here, so you shouldn't need to lie or spread misinformation to make them seem worse.
---
Nerfed.
---
Oh I'm about as lefty as it gets, but i also don't want the next player shouting out anti gay propaganda, that I happen to disagree with. There are plenty of battlegrounds for political discourse, the business decided this isn't one of them.

Hopefully after the revolution succeeds, we can get our old art for Headcrack and Deadly Shot back

At least Western consumers are becoming more aware of it happening.  I think it's been a pretty crazy few weeks with South Park parodying it with Disney, then China banning the Houston Rockets over a GM's tweet to support Hong Kong, and this too.
---
China's policies with Hong Kong and censorship have a "cost" like this and its only going to fuel anti-Chinese sentiment.

&gt;&gt;Make no mistake the US has a lot of fucked shit going on atm but to say people from the US are not allowed to point at the stinking pile of human rights violations that is China because their nation isn't perfect is fucking pathetic my dude.

uhhh what is the point of lying when we can all go back and read what you wrote?

"*no but seriously yanks, clean the mess on your front porch before you start yelling at others to do so*"

Only for you to say you aren't using US drama to defend china from criticism lol. what a joke. 
---
&gt; i just find it really funny that your current administration is putting trade sanctions on china or whatever whilst they operate what are just straight up concentration camps for immigrants lmfao
---
Like i said before you clearly ignored, what the Trump administration is doing at this border is disgusting but trying to use that to disregard the **MOUNTAINS** of human rights violations from china is pathetic as shit and doesn't mean a damn thing  here so i have no idea why you keep repeating it.

So that being the case do you have any actual arguments because this tired as 'FUCK USA" circle jerk is starting to get depressing.

No problem with making the character gay, there is a problem with making a character gay then supporting countries who literally throws gay people in reeducational camps

The right thing, is for a gaming company to keep it's nose out of politics, either way.
---
I would like there to be hard proof, but at this point allegations of atrocities is all critics of the Chinese regime have. Beijing is extremely protective of media coverage on critical events in their country, so it is likely we lack information.
---
The context here is that a player used his platform to denounce the Chinese government, during a Hearthstone tournament, and was censored for it (even the VODs have disappeared).
---
If something similar ever happens in a US context, I expect the same amount of backlash.
---
No? They're communist in nothing but name. They're a state capitalist society, and a totalitarian one at that.
---
"Not commenting at all" benefits the oppressor.

They didn't "remain neutral" though.  They actively censored an interview given by a player.  That is not a neutral action.

No idea what the deleted comment said, but the UN cannot do anything to either the US or China. And if a trade war with the US wasnt as destructive to china as it is the US, why wouldnt china keep escalating it like Trump was?

It‚Äôs not a free market economy it‚Äôs a command economy, the government has a hand in every company with having at least one party member on every company‚Äôs board of directors.

Yes, Reno Jackson makes most lategame control decks in wild seriously consider being Singleton. How viable they are depends a little bit on the surrounding meta but generally there is always at least one Singleton deck in tier 2.

Bloodreaver Gul'Dan is one of the best warlock control cards in the wild format, It is a core card alongside the rest of the demon taunt (voidlord) package in warlock control decks, even non-singleton.

More generally warlock has been a consistently good performer in wild and it almost always has multiple relevant decks in the meta.

Censorship is only bad when Trump does it
---
Yes, but I think mainly that's because it's how China still self-identifies. Really, neither China nor the USSR were *ever* Communist in the way Marx intended (Marx's ideas were flawed and naive, but that's a different subject). Very early on there were ideological purges and the Communist true believers were massacred along with all the academics, religious, philosophers, and other people who might have stood up against the corrupt authoritarian oligarchies those countries became.
---
Current China is a mix of authoritarian dictatorship and unregulated free market capitalism, with all the corruption that implies. The only thing that keeps it from completely going off the rails is that if anyone gets too ostentatious with their corruption, they get rounded up and sent to reeducation camps/disappeared. It's hard to discern from the outside though how much actual corruption busting is happening, and how much is just using the corruption label as the excuse to remove inconvenient people.
---
It's easy to see why the HK population is fighting so hard even though there's basically no conceivable outcome at the end of this that's good for them. If they back down, they are going to be doomed to living in the ugly authoritarian dystopia that the rest of China has to deal with.

That's obviously not what I said, but yes people who are both gay and straight do explore their sexuality sometimes. My brother and my former roommate both thought they were bi for awhile.

You are right, although I wouldn't call china's response an escalation, but a measured response. If they wanted to, they could actually escalate. America is the underdog, and will come out worse if china wanted to take them to the mat. My original point though was that the two biggest countries in the UN don't feel pressure from the UN. Both have their allies and nothing vote wise would ever move against either. The only thing they would ever feel is pressure from the other.

It makes some people happy to see someone like them. Especially those still in the closet or unable to express themselves due to circumstances or denial. And gives a perspective on a gay guy other than the Stereotypical flamboyant feminine type

The whole point is that it shouldn't be a big deal. The sentences "he and his girlfriend" vs "he and his boyfriend" should give about the same feeling of 'oh cool' if you really dont care. But if theyd said the former, you probably wouldnt have the same complaint, right?

Is it PR? Sure. Is it bandwagoning, maybe. But there are people who legitimately appreciate the inclusion, and I dont see that as anything but a good thing

But than both China and the USA quit as soon as UN criticize thwm. Maybe Russia too. Those countries with imperialistic tendencies won't bother with organisations which can sanction them.

Yes, but when deciding which characters to include (before any work has been done) it is easier to simply axe the character entirely rather than creating two different versions of the Witch Doctor depending on the game's region. There are black characters in other Blizzard products that made it over to the Chinese market untouched.

Capitalism - American capitalism in particular - needs to be taken down a peg. It's simultaneously egregiously powerful and almost entirely unprincipled. So naturally, it will side with fascists if it comes down to the profit bottom line.

I don't know why you're still equating "capitalism" and "free market." The two have never been synonyms. Capitalism is any system wherein capital is owned by individuals rather than collectives. China is capitalist despite having tight controls over certain aspects of the economy, as is Russia with its corrupt state-awarded monopolies. Virtually all of Northern/Western Europe, with their high taxes and generous social programs (as well as a host of environmental regulations), are still capitalist systems.

What is new? This would be the case at any point in time where capitalism meets authortarianism. They are two things that cannot live side by side without altering one or the other.

&gt; So is this just not okay because it's videogames or do you feel that way when a government has something to say about companies that sell drugs or oil?

My thoughts would be there is not a true capitalist relationship between Cuba/Venezuela and the US.  Again, there is a difference because we are talking about one countries trade deals with another, compared to a country blocking a specific company (no matter where it is/could be based).

95% of the people in the USA wouldn't be able to locate China on a map, let alone know the complexity of their local politics. countries like the USA have always made a priority of keeping their citizens brainwashed and as dumb as they can possibly be.

Yes, South Park was banned *in China*.  This is different, it was completely taken down everywhere from an interview that wasn't in China.  It's a video game, I don't want any political opinion in it, even if it matches my own.  It's just not the place.

The shape their propaganda.  It's harder to spin anybody's perception of them if they call themselves "Whinnie the Pooh's dictatorial state of China".  It's a tool of effectively every authoritarian rule in history.  Tell your people you are what is best for them.  Look like you are strong and harsh because you have to be or &lt;Insert villainized enemy or idea&gt; will make things worse.  That's how you convince part of your population that things could be worse and to go along with whatever you tell them.  If you tell them you are oppressing them for your own personal gain, you decrease compliance.

---
Nice
---
&gt; but does it apply to written speech posted on private property?
---
No, but it's not Blizzard choosing what is OK to say in their house, it's the Chinese government choosing, and they are making the same choice for any company whose house is sufficiently invested in the Chinese market to be leaned on.
---
A company like Blizzard setting limits, of their own volition, on what you can say on their private media isn't a serious concern for freedom of speech. The issue here is that the limits they've set were *not*  of their own volition, but forced on them by the Chinese government. The Chinese government says you can have freedom of speech, but then you can't do business in the Chinese market. They make the *exact* argument you made for corporations, but for the whole country, i.e. "our property, our rules". The problem in China's case is that its "property" is human beings, exactly like this Hong Kong player who's being censored, and their freedom of expression is being restricted, constantly, and increasingly.
---
Pretty much.  The world is saying "we see your bullshit, but as long as you keep your bullshit in your boarders, we won't act."  Honestly, if it wasn't for the Germans trying to invade everyone around them in ww2, the same situation would have played out in Germany most likely.  We would talk shit about them and...that is about it.  Tell the citizens "feel free to move, but probably not here" as they do now.

China has been a huge "upcoming market" for the NBA for like two decades or more at this point.  The NBA plays pre-season games over there every year now and a lot of the players do basketball camps (where they are treated like rockstars rather then *just* NBA players).  It is H U G E over there now.  The nba, unlike say the nfl, has done an amazing job spreading the sport and their league around the world.  I would imagine after the US, China is their next biggest consumer nowadays.

Only about 30% of them are Christian, but the ones that do are often really into it. It is when they move out of the country that they become more religious as that is where they community hangout and support eachother (language school, helping start a business, etc).

Funkmaster#11360 on america

I feel like this infographic could be a bit better. Some things have been mentioned already, but here's some other things to change that could make it better
---
* For classes that people didn't bring (just rogue in this case), it shows a 0% winrate. This is very misleading
---
* Classes that weren't brought often have very skewed stats. Mage in week 2, 3, and 4, and warlock in week 6 and 7 for example. Maybe have the line (or each section of an area chart, or pie graph if you'll switch formats) be more translucent if the class isn't popular, and more opaque if it is popular?
---
* I don't know if it's been accounted for, but the "banned" percentages should exclude classes that were protected  in that match.The biggest example is priest. Priest was probably banned less overall than warrior or druid, but if priest was left unprotected, it was probably banned more than the rest of the pack.
