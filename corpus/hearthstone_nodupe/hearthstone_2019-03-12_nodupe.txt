Imagine if it read "Start of Game: If your deck has no even or odd cost cards..."
---
---
---
In Magic, they sometimes design cards around "slush art," or artwork they commissioned and want to use, but the card got deleted from the set or something. The lead designer for that game is very open about that. Having said that, I don't think that's true of pivotal characters. It seems like a really bad idea to tie your marketing to a couple unused pieces.
---
Not that obvious that your own minion attacking can trigger it since that's not something that happens often. The snakes aren't affected by the hysteria either so they just pop up as useless hits for you or your opponent.

---

---
And then they make Ragnaros the Lightlord. Yeah, HS doesn't care about the lore
---
My main issue with the way Team 5 does their pre-expansion stuff is they tend to announce it then make it us wait 2-3 weeks before showing many of the cards. I'd rather they just wait an extra week or 2, then make it a steady stream of reveals until release day.
---
Emeriss at 9 mana= overpowered 
---
Emeriss at 10 mana= unplayable 
---
Oof
---
Then people won't be happy about the long wait before the announcement. Some less clever people will probably whine that they didn't know an expansion was coming and didn't save up.
---
The art is beautiful.
---
&gt; i almost feel that all these teases are for the single player
---
Pretty sure they are
---
In terms of hearthstone lore... yeah. Remember they are trying to be their own thing after dropping the hearthstone thing. I think this is just their idea. Besides, right now its the villains, but they have a whole year. They will bring the most notable later. This whole year could be an "all star" in celebration of 5 years.
---
It was always the most aggro deck even in vanilla with super cheap buzzard into hounds burst around turn 7 every game. But I would agree with that guy, the super aggro face hunter build he’s referring to that’s closest to modern aggro hunters came around BRM, I would classify undertaker hunter as a different hunter build from classic aggro hunter. Both oppressive tier 1 aggro hunter decks but dtill different in my opinion
---
i think the fifth one is the player, she will say something like "and the last one IS YOU" and then the adventure trailler rolls in
---
&gt;it just means it’s getting a lot of upvotes AND downvotes

Yes, I know that.

You ask me I think pre-release firesides should be a live event given to everyone who pre orders a expansion instead of the select few who are able to attend a fireside gatherings. It would be a lot better and would prevent me from using a vpn personally.
---
And the answer to your question you cannot get banned unless if someone gets your user name and reports you to blizzard. I had a friend attend a fireside and he told me they take down your battletag to make sure everyone’s that’s there is actually there and anyone that’s not there they report to blizz.  But that was just one fireside gathering from what he’s told me. So I say be careful about using a vpn you don’t want to risk your collection over it. (Ridiculous right) 
---
maybe that's why there are 5 villains cause if I remember right there is still a tarot card after Dr Boom 
---
Ummm how?
---
The one and only reason is because those two cards are two different species. King Mukla is a gorrila, pure an simple, whereas Banana Bufoon is a HOZEN, a monkey-like HUMANOID that exists in the Warcraft Universe. Therefore, one's a monkey, the other one isn't.
---
And if you play a midrange deck, tech in Mojomaster Zihi (one of THE best cards ever printed for aggro and midrange players.) 
---
Penguins of the frozen throne.
---
I got it with Bluestacks and it's honestly easier with it because you can skip the part of downloading a fake GPS app because Bluestacks already has one built-in.
---
Definitely agree on the hunter point. I really enjoy mid range/tempo decks and if I don't have the perfect answer to a hunter's first 2 turns I generally lose. Not always but most of the time. Opposite this I also really hate that Mechathun druid deck but the problem is hunter decks are designed to beat a deck like that. I think both need to go.

Nobody is playing a slow-ass card like Geist to counter Kingsbane. Especially not when the deck runs 7 other cards which also buff the weapon.

possibly the heros for the pve content?

Hey at least most of the RNG bullshit cards are meme levels of good and not actual viable decks.

&gt; Otherwise every combo deck becomes an OTK deck, because at some point it will win in one turn.
---
That's not true though. Many burst combos in HS have done less than 30 damage, e.g. old FoN + savage roar or Togwaggle druid. And some combo decks don't even deal direct damage at all, e.g. dead man's hand warrior.
---
Any deck that can do 30+ damage with nothing having to stick on the board at any point is an OTK deck IMO.

Ah I see. Unfortunately my Microsoft video app wasn’t trimming correctly and I was too lazy to find another software. Sorry to waste your time.

Maybe zol'jin. Dr boom was a hero card. Hagartha as well.

miracle rogue with questing package uses a copy of this usually, I wouldn't add two copies though as the card isn't very good on it's own. I gives you buffs for questing, firefly tokens, edwin, and more activators for vilespine
---
I understand the eagerness, but it's really just a day or two +/-. 
---
It'll be pretty interesting to study the different tease seasons and their effects. Shorter ones probably do great on some metrics, but terribly in others. The sweet spot seems to probably be 5-6 days, but Gadgetzan's was very well received even though it lasted 11. Part of it is really about how compelling/popular the tease material is, I guess.

Anyway, we'll get the announcement soon enough. Hang in there!

I can say with absolute confidence that i have zero interest in ever playing wild. All the "pros" to me are cons and as a long time MTG player i know which parts of the card game excite me. That 24000 dust i get from rotation + 3k from HoF i couldn't do without dusting to get, will provide me an INSANELY superior collection to play with in the new year. Even if i only get 1 year of use playing every single deck i want to rather then a limited supply, that will be a better alternative then having to re-craft 2 or 3 wild cards if i ever change my mind (won't happen).

What are the other "villians", what are the villians? how many are there going to be?

What?

Soon Bog Creeper will return to the arena and reunite with his long lost brother(s), Furious Ettin. Together they will taunt their foes in all their 7-costed, well-statted glory.

Miracle rogue can be super oppressive etc.

This is the least I have cared about Hearthstone in these 5 years. I started during Beta and was hooked from the start, but I barely played last expansion, can’t bother to keep up with the daily quests, I even forgot to finish my brawliseum run last weekend.
---
The model is so outdated, barely any incentive to keep playing after 5 years. Innovation is at an all-time low.... Same old ladder, no (cosmetic) rewards (1 chest per season is not cutting it), no achievements, no new game modes (2 headed giant? Tournament?). I used to be one of those players who would buy every adventure and pre-order every expansion. But no more! 
---
Get your shit together, or you gonna lose playerbase rapidly. I honestly have more fun playing Brawl Stars than Hearthstone nowadays.

Still playing a bit casually, so I have some backup gold for future expansions where shit actually will change.

Seriously? They stepped up the production a huge amount. The voice actor for this one is way better, and the visual style is much smoother, with more motion.

Mate, the earth is not like a circular ball. It's like an egg, that has been pressed into a circular shape.

Oh, don't get me wrong, I'll take any pack I can get my hands on, my collection is far from competitive at the moment.

It's just, I feel like we've got too used to focusing on the reward rather than the occasion and in this case there is neither.

Hey man, it's down to personal preference really. You're guaranteed a pack from the latest expansion from arena, even if you go 0-3... Arena does take a while to learn, it's a completely different type of gameplay to anything else currently available and is relatively challenging if you don't know what you're doing. I'd personally suggest to keep going with it because if you manage a 12 win run then the rewards can be very good. Just keep trying man, you'll get there.

No way. They won't speed things up.

I was always thinking they should start earlier to reveal cards, but make it much slower towards the big final reveal stream.

Like 2 cards every 2nd day. This would be better to talk and think about mediocre cards , and also be beneficial for YouTubers due more consistent card release.

hey. I've been playing Hearthstone for 3 days, and since rank ~45 I've started meeting players with several legendary cards and other stuff that is not accessible to new players (unless they donate). Are those all braindead donators who have bought a lot of packs but are unable to climb the ladder, or the matchmaking is just fucked up? Genuine question, I really want to know.
---
If you are going for the most efficient way to get packs then buying packs is the best way, but if you enjoy arena and are willing to put in the time and effort to watch streamers and play yourself, then arena will be better long term. It won't do much good if you aren't averaging about 5 - 6 wins per run. But it isn't as daunting as it seems. Definitely get the hearth arena add on from overwolf it will help with choosing the right cards. But what makes a great player and a 12 wins run is understanding WHY you are choosing certain cards over others and knowing when it is appropriate to choose something less optimal under some circumstances. (Such as evening or your curve). You might get 30 legendaries in a row but that doesn't mean it will get 12 wins.
---
so you say that standard right now has a balanced meta?
---
who the fuck doesn't want to have a diverse meta? I thought you're a MTG player, with MTG having one of the most diverse metas.
---
Hi new player here. I'm looking for advice and strategies and particularly resources for deck building. I've been on mobile playing for about a month now and I'm starting to figure it all out and I'd really like to take my strategies to the next level. Figuring out all the solid combinations and getting an idea for the best cards for each class is a big hurdle and alot of the information online is really outdated so a point in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.

---
If it would work that way, one could sneak quests in even decks.
---
I love Hearthstone but i think it says a lot about the state of the game when most of the conversation on the sub lately is about the reveal. It's obviously big news, but it's clear the player base is so tired of the meta right now that we're hanging on every clue of a hint, of a speculation. 
---
Being disappointed about Magatha is a joke to me. It was just echo chamber speculation with literally 0 foundation. But the fact that this is where players emotions are right now (not focused on exciting gameplay itself) says a lot. 
---
I'm really confident about the Year of the Dragon given the recent team lead interviews and videos, but the stakes are high and they have to deliver with this expansion, big time.
---
They could have done Kel'Thuzad instead of Boom. And they should have.
---
Yeah but everybody knows the real antagonists from 2015 were Patches and Barnes...

All those days will be the some day. We do not know yet have a confirmed date. It's like 99% April. If it's gonna be before the WC (25th-28th) it should probably be at least about 2 weeks before the start. If not then choosing that date for the WC would be weird. It could be after the WC (which would make April 30th most likely), but that's quite late. If it's before that then going by previous releases we should get an announcement today/this week.
---
Here is my opinion for the most likely dates (in rough order):  
---
1. Apr 2nd
---
2. Apr 9th
---
3. Apr 11th
---
4. Apr 30th
---
5. Apr 4th
---
Yeah, pulling off something like this is super easy to do on a day's notice. 
---
Oh, and here I thought we were talking about power levels between a legendary and a common.
---
I get the idea that they're only including "villains" who are original to Hearthstone, with the exception of Dr. Boom because it wasn't until TGT that true originals started getting rolled out (Skycap'n Kragg, Bolf Ramshield), and LoE when Hearthstone truly began employing its own lore.
---
Might as well be Dr. Boom's mechs rattling and clacking.
---
You're so fixated on Violet hold, you refuse to ~~see~~ hear anything else.
---
So why post a completely irrelevant picture then? 
---
You don't need 15 each, 10 each is enough to guarantee a legendary (assuming you haven't opened any).
---
Sir Finley confirmed as 5th Villain.
---
I wish they would go back and rework old cards, even a little, to make them more interesting. What if Alien Mukla gave you 5 bananas instead? [](/concernedstarlight)
---
Wall priest for sure. As a player who uses a mech paladin, it’s horrible to watch my carefully magnetized minions do nothing to a 2/14, then have it come back and topsy turvy. Fuck that deck and priest in general

Even Hearthstone originals are getting put into WoW now anyway. KT is still super iconic to Hearthstone. He was our very first boss fight!

Let's be rational. I doubt they'd print a character named ≈1.4142857
---
 I thought it is a fake. 
---
Rastakhan's Rumble is probably one of the expansions with more OG Warcraft/WoW character representation. Only Hooktusk, Da Undatakah and Mojomaster Zihi are original! That's even less originals than TGT.
---
Its not bad in midrange hunter due to timber wolf and hyena synergy.
---
Omg, it was Whizbang the whole time.
---
What if this whole expansion is his coming to Classic Set Announcement. 
---
&gt; but there's actually one thing that would make cards a lot cheaper
---
Yeah, this is why I commented that the system you mentioned becomes better after about 12 packs. In 12 worst-case packs, you get 48 commons, which is about half the commons available. So your odds of getting duplicate commons starts going up. Since commons are so... well, common... and you currently only get 5 dust refund from them, packs end up being "better" (as you mentioned) but only for the first dozen or so. After that, you quickly reach a break even point where your system is equally cheap, and from then on your system is always more consumer friendly. Instead of spending 100 gold for 1 random rare and 20 dust, you're spending 100 gold for 1 rare of your choice. Whether or not you're trying to complete the entire set, this ends up being better for the consumer.
---
I play wild and I don't think all decks are stupidly overpowered. There are some weak but really fun decks to play there that I see. Saying stuff like that just gives wild a bad name
---
maiev shadowsong as a card, Akama!! FRKIN' AKAMA, Garona, Lor'themar theron, Nobundo, Maraad, Thargas Anvilmar and the Thaurissan family, XAVIUS!!!
---
Well, there are a lot of characters we are still missing.
---
I don't have enough golden cards to make a viable deck, and golden whizbang also comes with the benefit of making your hero golden which is cool cuz I only have 1 golden hero by default 
---
I have played since September 2015. I have never paid real money for anything. I only do the daily quests every 2-3 days. My best rank is 5 but usually I stop at 15.
---
I have never dusted a card unless it was nerfed or hall of famed.
---
Right now I have 7000 gold and 42000 dust. We're I to dust my gold cards I'd probably be over 65000 dust. 
---
Opening 65 packs per expansion usually gives me 2x of all commons and rares. I get 4-6 legendaries per expansion in those packs as well. 
---
What I miss out on the most is epic cards. However once the meta settles and there's obviously really good epics I just craft them. I usually avoid crafting legendaries unless they're really good.
---
I have 100% completed the classic set.
---
So yeah, as far as I'm concerned f2p is easily achievable if you put in the years to do the daily quests. I'd still manage fine with a new account though, just dust your two free legendaries and make a face hunter.
---
Did you manually type in the deck? FYI you can just post the deck code. There is a bot that will turn just the code into a formatted display. Also you can post the whole text.

---
I have nothing against Orcs *BUT...*
---
Hunter I did a deck with mostly dupes so it brought my health down to fairly low, then restarted until I got a molten giant. 
---
Shaman I did a murloc deck, getting tidecaller down T1 and hoping it doesn’t get obliterated
---
Paladin was the hardest for me for sure, but I did it using the young dragon hawk method of playing that and buffing the shit out of it until it eventually kills him. Restart if it dies basically.
---
They call rank 5 “dad legend” 
---
Golden epic is enough for me. Hit legend once, now i do not need to anymore. To much of a grind indeed.
---
Every expansion has some of those. Floop's the one I fell for the hardest. It's a good card but not nearly as good as I thought for Malygos specifically.
---
People hyping up Discard is the one that always kills me. "This is the card that makes Control Discard Warlock viable!"
---
for me, i dont care those teaser, i want reveal cards... is a card game, and the teaser is just "villains" who i dont care.
---
&gt; Let that be a lesson, Team5!
---
They are hard learners, remeber patches into jades into keleseth into caverns below into baku. 
---
Safurel#1821 NA Trading 80g quest. You first. If you can read this it's still available.
---
This could be a legit Card if the boom bots could hit either players side.
---
The lack of titles are disturbing ^^Settra ^^does ^^not ^^serve!
---
Is rafaam a female? Because the text means "the witch" 
---
The troll lady explicitly said Dr Boom was the last member of the team and since she was the one assembling all the bois I assumed she was the leader
---
Nice
---
Murloc Paladin or Uther OTK work pretty well. Murloc is even not very dust expensive, but a lot of the cards aren’t in standard any longer so you have to decide if it’s worth crafting. 
---
Ethereals can fit Rogue characters as well, but Rafaam is definitely a sorcerer.
---
sorry, typo :D
---
That's very true, but part of the reason I like digital is that control. I often tend to adjust colors sometimes after shading because sometimes it looks better even after the fact. (Hue slider, etc)
---
I use SAI so I'll have to find a way to merge without messing up the multiply layers.
---
I think it's cool, but it's the artist's curse to always want more than they can do. Or to envy what they don't do. Hahaha. No one way is right, but I feel like we always find ourselves thinking "why the fuck can't *I* do that" when it comes to style or whatever. Art is infuriating but fun.
---
GORGE YOUR HATRED,EMBRACE YOUR RAGE
---
Spoiler alert: They're wrong.
---
And lots of people were totally serious about the Magatha thing, hence the disappointment in this sub.
---
What if it makes Whiz\bang ignore Cold Blood in the deck? The possibilities are endless.
---
Cell M12.  Column M, Row 12.
---
The disclaimer was aggravating, not the typo.
---
What is with the tail? I thought she was orc.
---
Thank you, this comment made me laugh.
---
new HS leaders assemble!
---
It seems like someone who loves card flavor would also be excited about learning the setting / context for the cards that are soon-to-be-revealed.
---
But I dunno, I've never heard the term before today,
---
Wasn't the violet hold domain registerd by some random dude with a "pussyslayer_x69"-esque name and not by blizzard?
---
Ugh Shudderwock , I'm trying to haunt gilneas but I'm dummy thicc and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting Genn
---
A lot of Vs
---
I disagree that every meta has had a viable Midrange Hunter but next year should be fine for Hunter because they have what past metas (where Hunter's failed), card draw and early game.  
---
Yes you lose Candleshot but Springpaw is amazing for controlling the early game and efficient trades.  You also have Master's Call which gets you your key beasts early and a premium minion in your Classic Set (Savannah Highmane).  And while Hunter *should* be fine post rotation, no one can accurately predict for sure right now or when we see the ~135 new cards.  It's just really difficult to do and streamers/pros are historically wrong about a lot.
---
*
---
(There is even a small surge of Midrange Hunter in  Wild because the Standard version is so good so you might be able to play there a bit without crafting much (or anything).)*
---
Yes it does
---
ah so we give you money to buy us stuff and then we give you money and you dont buy us stuff

You made an error in your calculations, the average gold with 2 rerolls is 66,92. The occurrence of 50g quests after 2 rerolls is ~23% (~.61 ^3). looks like you just substracted the 0.23 again?

well clearly they have been working with Team 5 orrr...maybe they are a part of team 5 0\_0
---
ohhh I forgot about this, good call
---
It's a neat idea, but falls apart kinda fast when you realize how many options exist that take you on a different path.  Even using a hero power early instead of playing a card could have a big impact on the game, so it's not really ever the "same" game.  Some of the RNG rolls would be less predictable, but what happens if Hagatha is played a turn later than originally played?  Should it create the same spells or different ones?  Either option takes you on a different path, so the game is never really winning the same game that someone else lost - it becomes a new game in itself.  
---
maybe they do want to tease cards this time?

If he played the Mecha'thun before the Voidlords he woud have been fine, but nobody is going to do that.

Though if he doesn’t currently have all the rotating cards, he’s better off using that dust to craft golden versions of the epic cards.

If the villains are all strong Neutral legendaries ill be so happy. One of the worst things about them switching more legendaries to class rather than neutral is the low deck creation possiblities because every neutral legendary they release besides maybe one has been complete trash
---
That is the much more safer version but you can't get anywhere with it in the dumpster ranks. Probably only better after rank 10 or so where you can guess/predict your matchups
---
Or they just want to make their stuff canon in Warcraft extended universes  by not having two different set of lore.   Those side story in Hearthstone could very well be used in WoW, while something like KotFT, CoN, or ONiK make little sense in any timeline. 
---
At this point, I'm generally happier with Hearthstone being side story that take place in Warcraft universe, rather than something loosely based on events we've done already.  Heck, I would be more excited to see the three faction in Gadgetzan than I would to fight Kaelthas in Heartstone.
---
Russians got the best hearthstone memes. Gotta love that shit

SPOILER:
---
~~They actually did revisit Whizbang, the card Zayle, shadow cloak is the “new whizbang”, and is the reward for clearing the expansion, as Trump said.~~

Oh, me too. But it adds a new level of complexity. This turn 6 lethal seems a bit more complicated than the standard version on turn 10.

---

---
Ppirates tend not to ppractice their sppelling.
---
Hunter keeps a lot of great cards so it will probably be fine, just more vulnerable to control decks without deathstalker rexxar. Springpaw, hyena, timber wolf, masters call, tundra rhino, savannah highmane, hatchet, animal companion, kill command, etc all stay in standard. It just needs a few replacements which could be filled by halazzi, lifedrinker, nightmare amalgam, stranglethorn tiger, etc.
---

Most important question tho...how much dust to craft a mage’s Flamewanker?

Dr. Boom's character was developed for Hearthstone by the Hearthstone team. He's a throwaway with little to no lore in WoW, in Hearthstone he's a scientific genius. I imagine that Dr. Boom goes to the tavern to escape his bomb throwing life and be the bomb throwing genius in the world of Hearthstone.
---
I’m apppalled
---
False: It's Ultra Sheen *from* Jimmy Neutron.
---
Wait, even *Griftah*?
---
I would not. Shaw is a very good card that will likely find a home in some good decks this year. Just save and craft masters call when you can.

Of all of the suggestions for additions to the Classic set, this might be the most ridiculous.
---
I mean, I would hope it is why they dropped "Heroes of Warcraft" from the title.
---

---
The title means "The Witch", guys from blizzard just placed another thumbnail with Rafaam my accident. The video should still be about Hagatha.
---
Heal paladins seemed very fun to me but sadly i don’t have any legendaries for paladin from rastakhans rumble. I just can’t wait for the odd paladin to rotate out of my games, it gives me a lot of trouble also
---
Unite the Murlocs... really?
---
Depends on if you're more into WoW-lore or HS-lore. It's the same lore, but I'm guessing folks who never played WoW aren't gonna have much nostalgia for Cataclysm-era Horde villains.
---
Pretty much everything here is notable with the exception for cases where the full cycle of cards was included (spellstones, weapons, quests, death knights).  Oh, and level up is listed here, but at 6 mana I don’t think anyone will notice if it rotates or not.  I guess the argument is that people remember the 5 mana version?
---
Of these...I’m not too bothered by listing all the quests.  If you rotate out all the death knights and all other quests, but kept the “bad” quests, maybe the bad quests become good because now THEY are the ultimate endgame.  If Blizzard turned around and said that the “bad” quests were staying in standard I would start brewing with those quests immediately.  So...I think it’s fair to mention them.
---
Every single death knight has been meta, so all of those are fine to mention.
---
Legendary weapons...Woecleaver has been briefly relevant in recruit warrior.  Dragon Soul actually showed up in the top 100 legend report *this week*.  So...Runespear is the only one that really doesn’t have any argument to be here.
---
Spellstones...yeah, I can’t really defend these.  Rogue, Paladin, Warrior, and arguably Shaman (there’s a fringe overload shaman with spellstones and snowfury giants, but it’s...so fringe) do not belong here.
---
So like...five cards that definitely shouldn’t be here.  And another seven where...they were not meta but I can see why they might be mentioned even if they are fringe or see almost no play right now.
---
Considering the Lich King kind of has to die to beat him im pretty sure he's not in the violet hold

---
Ancient Watcher. Equality. Cutpurse. Voodoo Doll. Leeroy Jenkins. They all are flavorful for self-evident reasons.

Then there is the spellstone cycle, which has this cool lord of the rings theme of artifacts with immense but corrupting power.

I wish mana cheating and draw cheating were trimmed out in the future. Pulling a 9 mana minion for free, or drawing half your deck in one turn breaks fundamental pillars of how the game works. It's as if you were playing Monopoly, but instead of having to roll the dice, you could just pick where you wanted to go each turn.

But he said Radiant Elemental changed how Priests played, not that it was the strongest card.
---
The game has been translated into multiple languages, the name of the card will likely be in a dictionary somewhere.
---
I play a lot of wild.  You almost never see quests get played.  I think so far in 2019 I’ve seen maybe a half dozen Priest and  Warrior quest decks, and one or two people trying to make Wild Quest Rogue a thing.
---
Problem is that those decks are just overshadowed by better decks within those classes.  I’m pretty sure you could hit 5 with most quest decks if you put your mind to it, but they aren’t great. 
---
That said, ranks 20-10 are filled with people trying to make the jankiest decks imaginable work (myself included... someday Jade Deathrattle CubeRogue will work).  I’m sure you could have fun with any quest on Wild ladder.  
---
Oh my bad lol forget wat I said

# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone

This is the build I’ve used (Brian Kibler runs a very similar build) and I’ve seen Sonya, mimic pod and such used in some builds at well. I use it on ladder and hover just over 52% 
---
/r/notwoosh
---
But I did not say that shadow visions was the stronger, if not much stronger card. I said shadow visions had a bigger, if not much bigger role.

Deathstalker Rexxar and tears from Warrior players

Can we stop rehashing the same characters, again, and explore more of the Warcraft lore please? We already did the throwback thing with WOTOG and with KOTFT... 
---
This rings back nice memories:). I would watch my dad play solitaire on his computer when I was a kid and would be amazed at how good he was, and think it was awesome when he would win and the cards flow across the screen. Oh and of course I always made him use the robot:). Thanks for reminding me of this OP&lt;3
---
Don't forget that "At the start of your turn" work the same way too.
---
Running [[Gurubashi Offering]] and [[Doomsayer]] in Quest Mage means "order LUL" matters.
---
really cool ... fits the hearthstone style.

I quit during WoTLK and still wished it was Magatha simply because of 1k Needle quests from Vanilla. It's shocking to me how much they avoid wow nostalgia and that we got a set about Kobolds before 50+ more interesting races.
---
Ok, makes sense. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Does anyone else wish the the rotation cycle was 1 in 1 out with each expansion?
---
YO THATS NIIICEEE DUDE
---
Runespear? Why would you put this in your deck? - Rafaam, probably 
---
Just a few issues with the spellstones and the weapons. Anyone remeber dragon soul priest the tier 1 deck.
---
Tbh jugg is such a fun finisher in dead man's hand warrior
---
Oppressed as in one deck "beats" all others has to be Undertaker Hunter or Jade Druid. Pirate Warrior at least had a Reno counter. But this last year has been awful due to too many polarized decks. Basically a game of rock paper scissors which can be super frustrating.
---
“Not to be racist, but Orcish people SUUUU-“
---
The Tempo Storm lists are pretty regularly derided. Beyond their tier lists being determined by “feel” instead of data, they also pick lists they feel are interesting rather than representative of the highest win rate versions of a deck archetype. 
---
Bye bye, the entire meta.
---
Okay..but who is the villain, exactly?
---
Also got Shallow Gravedigger, Ravencaller, Elise, Violet Haze, Witches Cauldron, and Arfus
---
I choose blubbering!
---
This (along with Shudderwock) received a fair bit of hype when they were announced, hence the high scores on the likes of HS Top Decks.
---
Buttt... do you know any fun decks it would fit into?
---
Add Lyra, and name a more iconic trio.
---
Un'Goro Priest was really really fun.
---
Excellent, ty
---
Yeah. I suppose I am assuming the best case scenario.
---
Great - will try this too
---
You have my thanks
---
Yeah that’s pretty similar to what I was running but maybe I’ll try the DK
---
Thank you!
---
I would say Shadow Visions has an even more powerful impact that Radiant (which also is very good). 
---
Well... guess I'm not playing warlock anymore.
---
That’s why we all love Trolden
---
Agreed. You underestimate how boring and unoriginal everyone is until you play ranked HS ladder.
---
Doh!
---
I feel like there should be a sad trombone played at the end of each clip.
---
DK is a win-more card, the armor and hero power lets you pour on much more pressure in the late game.
---
The best Expansions are the ones rotating out in April (Un'Goro, KFT, and KnC).  I'd be saving up your dust for the [Hall of Fame.](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/avt3ro/hall_of_fame_craftdust_guide/)  You'll be able to get about a 12-50% return on your dust that way.
---
If you must buy packs, you can also sync your collection (through HSReplay or Hearthpwn) [on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tYuukT1O3qdvbSfpUAbJMJLYkusXclc-Rivd-uMy6g0/copy).  On the "Best Pack" tab, check off the 2017 Expansions (Un'Goro, KFT, and KnC) and it will tell you the best pack for meta cards.  But again, this all changes in a month.  Cards that work with decks now might not in a month when they lose synergy cards.
---
Yeah I know. I was hoping for a game mode where the top 100 cards can’t be used for example, or at least getting the meta decks out of unranked play
---
Damn she thicc af
---
I don't think they will make a 3rd iteration of Dr. Boom. They did say that he goes "boom" so I'm going to speculate it will be Boommaster Flark.
---
Can i use this to make a card for r/customhearthstone
---
Can I hear it for Patron Warrior?
---
Can i get the usual copy pasta pls
---
Was just about to type this... guess I'll have a lot of dust to go around for this next set.
---
Yeah, but I still don't think it's anywhere near the worst card on the list. The author obviously picked all DKs, Spellstones, Quests and Legendary Weapons, but e.g. some of the quests have to be further from playable (Shaman, Paladin, Warlock) than Runespear. The same is true for about half of the Spellstones. 
---
Im fine with that. They will have their day again come december when they have too many broken cards again.
---
Yeah they actually ate each other 
---
Wow location is gilneas
---
Literally analogy/theme would be closest to gothic horror
---
Or better yet, coin Thekal and play the giants instead of just holding onto both coin and giants
---
thx for trade
---
wait.. did galvadon actually make your list? :'D
---
This is even better when you read it i  their voices lol
---
It's really good! Keep up this awesome work!
---
 Do you have a site where you show some of your other artwork?
---
&gt; The card will always give you a Hero card from the class you're playing as
---
Yeah but why though? I thought random cards were not restricted to classes like [[Dragon Roar]] and [[Kabal Chemist]] unless it states a class card such as [[witch's cauldron]] or [[cabalist's tome]] 
---
If it were discover it would fall under your breakdown but that then it would be op with such a small pool and being able to choose. 
---
That looks awesome!
---
You should attempt to make Raza the chained next!

5/-/- | Add 3 random Mage spells to your hand.  
---
ALL OF THEM
---
I think in this case the artwork and size came first and then they thought what they could name it
---
I mean, Naxx is obviously a loose retelling of the events from the game, but they can't really build on that. They can't bring back Kel'Thuzad for side stories (who is until further notice dead).
---
&gt;Technically, they could even pull canon from noncanonical timelines by using the Infinite Dragonfight for lore
---
I bet you Toki will come back for an expansion involving time traveling and infinite dragonfight.  It's just too easy to write to not do it.
---
Eh I never had any interest in wild. I've disenchanted all but ragnaros and silvana because those are my two favorite cards in the wild set and i couldn't watch them go.
---
woosh
---
I also agree.  Wild is more fun and more competitive... so many more decks in its meta
---
The only thing I want to see is King Yoggwaggle.
---
K&amp;C + WotOG
---
Me not that kind of orc!
---
 Today's trash is tomorrow's cancer.

God I love this way too much. It is just really cool looking. Can't wait to see more keep it up!

Lets just leave this here

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbgPkIz\_JA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbgPkIz_JA)
---
Dude thats almost 30 wins per day every day holy shit
---
Do we even know there will be heroes in second expansion? Let's not jump too far ahead.
---
Defile is the only card I am genuinely going to miss. 
---
**Druid:** Cheat to get extra mana and larger green men, then play your combo.
---
**Hunter:** Play lots of spells, then play your combo.
---
**Mage:** Cheat to get extra turns, then play your combo.
---
**Paladin:** Cheat to get extra hero powers, then play your combo.
---
**Priest:** Cheat to get big minions on the board, then play your combo.
---
**Rogue:** Put your opponent's minions back in their hand, then play your combo.
---
**Shaman:** Play lots of battlecry minions, then play your combo.
---
**Warlock:** Cheat to get extra demons on the board, then play your combo.
---
**Warrior:** Draw dead man's hand, then play your combo.
---
Nope, he specifically mentioned the name of the year as the reason it would see play, so your thinking is wrong.
---
actually, a version of randuin priest ran big boi mukla. i believe sjow rocked it, back when he creatively threw curator in literally every deck. i miss sjow :(
---
This is sad because I like a lot of these cards.  
---
But at the same time I'm happy to see most of these go :D  
---
Goodbye cube (how did this never get nerfed?), voidlord, quests, rexxar (thank the Lord).  
---
Hated primordial glyph and shadow visions and all the rez cards that priest had.  
---
I will miss a few like Kathrena, rok'dolar, tarim, steed but man the RNG of these cards rotating is not going to be missed.
---
I really wish they would ever green TunnelTrogg and Malchezaar's Imp...
---
/s
---
There will always be net decks. That's not an inherently bad thing, nor is it "mindless" for someone to play them.
---
You make a distinction at the end where you say you wanted to see how many people were playing "non tier 1 or 2 decks" as if tier 3 or 4 decks aren't also net decks. If the distinction is win rate, is it really so bad that people enjoy playing the decks that win more often? Just seems weird to diminish people for playing certain decks.
---
Man i started on mean streets of gadgetzan and i was like 100% sure radiant elemental is classic
---
I can only give 1 upvote but this Sir or Madam is absolutely Fanfreakingtastic. Reinvigorates my desire to get a KT tattoo on my Shin
---
We don't have a specific date yet, but it's typically in April.
---
This is Amazing man
---
If you wanted people to figure out the reference for themselves, why would you explain it in the title yourself?   
---
  
---
I like the artwork and your style, but this makes little sense. 
---
Hopefully I can give you some encouragement. I've been a player that typically gets to rank 15 every season and then play only casual due to ladder anxiety.
---
This month I went for it and was able to go from 15 to 5 in a few days of fairly casual play. Ironically my win rate was the worst around rank 11-10. The best was winning 6 games in a row from rank 7 to get to rank 5.
---
General Kenobi!
---
Well done, minion.
---
All these 5s And they still couldn’t do anything special for there 5th year of development 
---
As a big Diablo fan (and someone who's never played WoW), I'd be very in to this. Not sure how the WoW fans would feel though.
---
How about a whole new game with the same mechanics based on Diablo or Starcraft? New classic set - start from scratch. Sure it would mean more collecting (and money spending) and would split some of the player base but I'd totally get in to either of those games.
---
I highly doubt that they would create a whole brand new game and split up the player based that much when they could just add it to hearthstone. Especially if it's the same mechanics and same style.
---
&gt;  I really hope we have real aggro decks viable next expansion
---
What game are you playing?
---
Every spell in rogue is overpriced because Prep exists
---
On that note - can we get the expansion icons to be a little bit darker on the cards? Or am the only one that can never make them out behind the text? I have no idea what anything's from unless it has little/no text over the icon
---
Could've posted this with a custom card and passed it off as an expansion leak :^)
---
Now time to wait 5 days for doctor booms teaser and another 5 days for raffam’s teaser.. amazing marketing move blizz kill the hype before there’s anything to be hyped about 
---
So fucking cool! 
---
just make a dummy alt account and use it to do the quests if u really need to be efficient and dont have time to do quests in real games
---
It *should* be classic. Instead there’s fucking Lightwell for a 2 drop. 
---
This would be such an overpowered expansion! 
---
Legend requires a significant time investment beyond playing the games for quests assuming your win rate is not above 60 percent
---
Dat Humongous ~~ass~~ errr... Razorleaf
---
My ocd won’t let me do that. I’d have to bow develop two accounts.
---
I probably could have worded that better :)
---
Meh, if I somehow want wild cards back somewhere down the road I’ll just fork out $100 to craft some stuff. I’ve been playing for years and haven’t paid a penny anyways. 
---
Go back and look at the beginnings of expansion trailers when it’s flipping through all the cards. For some reason they just give all of them the warlock border.
---
My end of season rewards was a golden surrender to madness.  Time to see if Mojo and Surrender are worthwhile come April.
---
hdub #11725 
---
NA 80g trade, i can show but you go first
---
If given the chance, a player will min max the fun out of any game.
---
Yeah, you're probably right. The idea of from-scratch collection would be cool but really I'd love it either way. But like I said, I also don't play WoW and I know fans of that might feel very differently.
---
Oh ok Ill look through em
---
Honestly, not going to miss them. Hopefully they learned the lesson and from now on the card power level will be reasonable.
---
I would disagree with some cards on this lost for example, quests that arent priest, warrior and rogue. Spell stones that arent druid, priest and warlock, the legendary weapons that arent rogue, paladin, mage and warlock. There just seems to be a lot of clutter 
---
It's most likely an archetype called Mind Blast Priest or Clone Priest. The full deck list isn't there, so I can't tell you which in particular.
---
