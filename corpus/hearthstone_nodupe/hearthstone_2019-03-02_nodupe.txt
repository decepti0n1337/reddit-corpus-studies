Apparently, I just got [Tad's Pole](https://i.imgur.com/20V87Jb.jpg). It must have played some part in my win on the first try because that deck looks like relative crap with little synergy otherwise. Maybe I had big legendaries to go with the scepter of summoning.
---

---
I've never seen Tad before or after this run. For any other advice, I'd probably suggest going with the biggest minions possible + scepter + recruit cards or something.

In the beta, Leeroy cost four mana. The Blizzard announcement of his nerf is also the source of the "fun and interactive" meme/copypasta, as it was justified by saying:
---
&gt; Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive
---
Many players find that Shudderwock/Mecha'thun/Druid/whatever reddit is upset about violates the spirit of what Blizzard said there, leading to the "fun and interactive" posts you often see in discussions about combos.
---
Ugly as F though.
---

---
Yeah that was way worse it all started with patches 
---
You will find the only anawer on Oprah
---
It was always true until recently. At one time, they built an archetype around Hunter having an empty hand.
---
And the same has been said about Druid, Shaman, Mage, Warrior, Warlock, Hunter, Rogue, and Paladin. 
---
Fact is, oppressive and super strong decks make hearthstone much less fun, it doesn't matter what class it is. 
---
So let me get this straight... based on what you said, I will get 1600 dust for Baku and then I can DE him for an additional 400 dust? So when rotation hits, I can get 2000 dust for Baku? Is this real life?
---
Lol you've played a whole one year longer, old fart!
---
The thing with Deathknights is that they are far more interesting when they arent just straight upgrades or if there's a cost associated with playing them. Dr Boom is fine because it does nothing on your turn (other than 7 armor) and the effect is powerful but suddenly constrains your life total somewhat. Nevermind that that life total is typically ridiculous because Baku, but that's a Baku problem. 
---
There's just never a bad time to slam down BRG. Gain a super good hero power. Summon a smorgasbord of big demons with taunt. Its just so good. Or theres no late game mage deck that doesnt run FLJ because its just that good. The warrior DK is my favorite from a design standpoint. Balanced, niche, but not OP.
---
Theres also the issue of recurring value. Scourelord Garrosh is fine because "I can deal 1 damage to everything once per turn" is significantly more balanced than "I deal 3 damage and heal for 3 every turn. Or god forbid FLJ's endless elementals.
---
TLDR: the big issues with deathknights is their ubiquity and recurring value.

this is very simple man. firstly, i never decent win rate, it will auto complete to the deck with the highest winrate with the cards you included in the list so far and excluding the cards you dont have. which could be 20% or something.       if you are still having a hard time understanding. go to hsreplay's deck section, put in 10 cards you want to see in a deck, in addition, select limit to my collection. sort by winrate, that is what the autocompleted list will be.

Sure. Im pretty active on hs.

I didn't mind them at all. 
---
In fact there's only 1 deck I hated to play against: Odd warrior with the quest. Anything else (odd mage, odd pal, even pal, even shaman, odd rogue, even lock) I enjoyed all these matchups. 
---
What I'll miss most though, is that if we don't get great aggro/pressure things, combo will be back at full strength... and THIS, I hate to play against.
---
Agreed.
---
Although you could probably get away with a pretty basic Mid-Range Hunter deck for pretty cheap.  It won't be S-Tier but it'd definitely good it's own.
---
That way you can save your dust.
---
Would look fantasic irl as a wooden sculpture
---
This.
---
On ladder it gets decimated by how fast so much if the meta is.
---
If I'm in a tournament and can almost guarantee that it matches against a slow control deck, things change.
---
Roger and his team stream snipe the early game of a tournament match. They learned their opponent didn't have MCT because it had been discarded by Tracking. They were disqualified for that. 
---
Had it happened to me today as well.
---
Just one of those "Enough Hearthstone for the day" moments.
---
Applebaum probably. It's good enough to see play in Wild Renolock over Sludge Belcher so it will most likely see play in a ton of standard control decks. 
---
I was thinking of making something similar for myself. Thanks!
---
(small correction to your formula: multiple copies of any HoF should not yield additional dust profit beyond the max number of playable copies)
---
They really didn't push Weapon Rogue though. They just gave Rogue one insanely OP weapon in a vacuum (Kingsbane).
---
Deathrattle Hunter was definitely pushed more incrementally into viability with Devilsaur Egg and Stalker in Un'Goro and Play Dead and Stitched Tracker in KoFT. But then Blizzard printed OP cards in Cube and Kathrena that carry the archetype. Once again, KnC broken the game.
---
I think Tarim is powerful, but not too powerful. It depends a lot on your and your opponent's board state; in the latest meta I often had to hold on to him because the opponent had a large board of small minions and I didn't...
---
I love this idea, great theory
---
And furthermore, the number of people who have hit 500 wins has only gone up since that time...
---
Fuck Fungalmancer in his fat fucking ass
---
The statline of Cube isn't the problem: getting 2 clones back is the issue. If Cube only resummoned 1 copy, it would've been balanced, effectively being a neutral friendly-only Reincarnate.
---
It was just really solid
---
I actually really liked witchwood too, until Rastakhan turned out to be the most underwhelming expansion ever and those two dummies hogged all of tier 1
---
Also odd hunter in the early witchwood days was a massive bitch
---
Spreading plague into savage roar + branching paths gg
---
Thanks for all the replies! Decided to craft the hall of fame cards and save my dust. 
---
I honestly can't think of a Legendary class minion released during the Year of the Mammoth that's stronger than Tarim (only Kathrena comes close).
---
The meta's at least as limited as Standard, possibly even more so, but the difference is that not everyone plays meta decks.
---
This is based on personal experience, so it may be specific to certain times of day and server, but:
---
- Wild Casual is a lot closer to what people seem to want from Casual. Yes, you see the bots and the netdecks, but you also see a lot of really weird fun stuff, most of which doesn't have ridiculously high winrates.
---
- On Ladder, R25 to R20 (approx), a lot of Standard or near-Standard decks, or netdecked and not necessarily good Wild decks. I guess it's going to full of newly-rotated decks immediately after rotation for a while.
---
- R20 to R8. The biggest variation. You're still going to see the netdecks, but this also seems to be where the "fun" players hang out, playing the meme decks, the crazy decks. Especially at the rank floors.
---
- R7 to legend*. The serious guys. T1 decks and Big Priest, except at the R5 floor where there's fun again.
---
(*I'm guessing about some of this. I top out at around R5 or 4 and start playing Mimiron's Head decks or something.)
---
So long penguin + dire frenzy into witchwood piper. You were always the highlight of my even hunter deck. 
---
Only if you don't have them already or they are common.
---
Oh look.  It’s the seventh rogue in a row.  Oh wow, it played cutlass and espionage and automatically wins.
---
This game is fun.

---
Haha, is this the only minion in your supposedly spell hunter deck?
---
Ungoro, Knights of the Frozen Throne and Kobolds and Catacombs are the sets that are moving to wild this April.
---
Frozen throne, ungoro, kobolds &amp; catacombs 
---
I didn't say he should wait, did I? I am referring to satisfaction of getting the exodia.
---
Journey to ungoro, knights of the frozen throne, and kobolds and catacombs. It’s all ways what ever expansions are two years old or near enough. So last years expansions including witchwood will be going wild this time next year
---
If people are playing netdecks on casual, it's probably so that they can test out the deck and get a feel for it before taking it to competitive. So their not necessarily doing anything wrong
---
Oh shit haha, he got one somehow! I'm not sure now though. 
---
&gt; I’m not missing the point,
---
You are completely missing the point. Read the image, read what I've said.  You keep coming up with the same nonsense about it being a set deck but that makes absolutely no sense if you don't have the cards for a deck and it also doesn't fit the part where it mentions partially completed deck.s
---
What decklist are you running?
---
Oh I am absolutely missing Kingsbane. It was an amazing card but the Leeching Poison nerf ruined it completely.
---
Not even talking about Wild, where it was a real problem, but rather Standard, where the deck has always had a sub-par winrate.
---
Heck, even with the best possible cards in Wild, you could've still lose often, especially to aggro decks and just lack of luck with draws on your side.
---
What did the nerf do? It turned a really cool anti-control deck into a fucking mindless aggro variation, ruining the whole point of the card and the archetype.
---
&gt;*I. Just. Need. Something. To. Play. For.*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*Am I asking for too much?*
---
Of course you are. They don't give a fuck.
---
Duskfallen Aviana, makes each players first card each turn cost 0.
---
Idk if it’s butthurt, it might be that Tarim is also rotating?
---
Bet he isn't even playing anymore.
---
This picture clearly proves how long Fail 5 takes from an idea to realization, and that's still not the longest they took.
---
You get it by playing other people that are using the card back. That's how it "spreads corruption"
---
Rush and overkill are a great combination. Magnetic looked nice but did not impact as much.
---
I love how you've made Death not even say anything in the very last panel. That is exactly what this card amounts to - a dead-ass cold as fewck straight "no"; no more words needed.
---
I'm just interested to see what "If you have a partially completed deck it will choose cards with high win rates with your already chosen cards".
---
That to me implies looking at card win rate, not deck win rates.  
---
Time will tell I guess.
---
Wdym "free"
---
I'm not trying to insinuate it's wrong. I'm just saying that the current state of casual is that you'll play almost nothing but netdecks. Why not use some of that behinds the scenes info to implement a mode where people can get away from the netdecks if they want?
---
i just want the game to run well. considering it has extremely basic graphics, it has no right to run as badly as it does

I have no idea. I’m pretty sure I only know it means tree because I learned German in school. I wondered if he was German because if you only read the name in German you would naturally translate it to English as rotten apple tree. I don’t know where I’m going with this.
---
Is an applebaum a thing in English anybody? Why u do this Blizzard? While we’re at it. Is it the same in other languages? Does the Spanish one say Baum? We need answers. What’s Google never heard of it.

Whoops I accidentally wrote this in the wrong place yesterday. I agree with your last paragraph yes I think it should have been this way from the start. But actually I’d say less people having it makes it more valuable, so I disagree that it doesn't hurt anyone, or matter if they are reimbursed. My whole point is it does matter. I would be bummed if suddenly a lot more people had gold portraits. 100%. I think most would agree. Also now we have something to work towards again, which is fun! We can play arena and enjoy it even more now.

i wouldn't advise crafting anything until after rotation next month though

It's insane how bad the value is. That said, I think the business model itself sucks: Paying for a chance to get what you want.
---
Thanks :) 
---
Wait, Witchwood is rotating or something?
---
If that's what you're into...
---
I don't know if you know, but CrescentBull was referring to an Easter egg from the Lich king battle in adventure mode. If you play the pinguin, Lich king will say I... I love him.
---
Year of the Kraken symbol?
---
It will be the same as Medivh and other cards from Karazhan (or any other campaign) - uncraftable, can't get it from packs.
---
I have a feeling odd and even decks are gonna get smashed in wild, and I’m okay with that.
---
Other than some odd and even decks being strong decks throughout most of the year, many blame them for the recent wave of nerfs.
---
Personally the hate seems a tad overblown. No one seems to remember how Odd Rogue was tier 2 for most of the Witchwood before the rise of zoolock and subsequent meta shifts made it tier 1, and both odd rogue and even shaman basically evaporated after the nerfs.
---
Dedicate to Odd or Tess and learn how to play it effectively. Refine the deck around your playstyle. Either one can work reasonably well if you commit to playing it effectively.
---
Wait why wtf i loved himmmmm i mean what's the reasoning?
---
Freedom, laziness and the quest to post on the internutz .. 
---
I see no one saying that but sun keeper Tarim and stone hill defender where fucking cancer
---
Goodbye.
---
What I'm more interested in is what class counters there are canonically? Like Warlock &gt; Paladin, Hunter &gt; Warlock, that sort of thing.
---
I don't think it's unfair. I mean, it wasn't like that for almost 6 years now. It's a great change they implement it at all, so I don't think anyone gets to seriously whine and complain about his previous arena wins not counting. 
---
Maybe people like you should get your head around the simple fact that anyone is free to play the game however you want. And it doesn't need any changes just because you feel a little upset about that.

I, unfortunately, didn't think about it and instantly crafted baku to get the free copy. Didn't even think to craft gold and then DE for free 1600. Oh well!
---
I think I heard recently from a hs folk that battlecry is more prominent in Shaman.
---
About 2 weeks after the tournament is over.  They'll pop up as a notification when you login to Hearthstone automatically.
---
The only reasonable suggestion i saw was to make them start in your hand, so they weren't only a rebuilding restriction and blanking a card in your deck but making you play with 1 less card in hand basically
---
Oh shit, I just realised I have a golden Genn. Sweet sweet dust. Nice.
---
I don’t think it’s “correcting a mistake” 
---
They’re adapting to a changing and aging game. They’re obviously pushing to make arena a more worthwhile game mode since standard is becoming harder and harder to keep fresh. 
---
I'm confused. Should he insect die or live?!
---
Nobody knows if it is uncraftable or disenchantable.  Or the 5 decks it gives access to.  We only know it is a 2 mana, 3/2, that is awarded at the end of the 5th Wing.  They might ask/resolve this on the Reddit AMA on Friday.
---
Back in the year of the Raven teaser, the [Witchwood teaser](https://i.imgur.com/pvcZn5W.jpg) had a part of the [pre-order](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/a/ae/Card_back-In_a_Dark_Wood.png?version=8a1dd47a53e7a10d336ff3110483a442) cardback. The other two didn't, but the second teaser does look suspiciously "good" enough to be a card back, and so does the third. Good find!
---
You're getting 3200 dust for your golden Baku while also getting to keep the card!
---
If you decide that you won't play wild (decide carefully though, I thought I wouldn't play wild 3 years ago and ended up recrafting a lot of the adventure cards and now I play wild almost exclusively) you can then dust that card for "regular" 1600 dust.
---
So, if you have the dust, craft as many HoF cards as possible in golden. You'll get it back and basically receive free golden cards.
---
I think they thought velen was ok because they never planned on giving priest cheap burn because it's not part of the class identity. They didn't limit their design space because it was already limited by their own choice.
---
Blizzard just shoveling shit onto wild fucking gut Baku don't send him to wild to be degenerate for the next ever. 
---
Which expansion? Didn't you know? Everyone on reddit started in the alpha.
---
That’s the joke... 
---
Would a 0 mana 1/1 weapon be OP?
---
Are you new to HS? It was this way from the beginning...
---
I totally see what you mean. I started just before Kobolds, made a face Hunter because what else is a new player supposed to play (after your homebrew Druid, which unironically features your only 2 legendaries Cenarius and Nat Pangle, systematically gets destroyed). Face Hunter sucked though, especially after Alley Cat rotated. Baku Rogue was a much better accessible deck.
---
I'll go to the optometrist then :-)
---
Is it me or is this week's brawl extremely polarized and draw dependent (coin flippy)? Nearly every single class is broken, especially if they get a good hand. 
---
Rogue often just steals your win conditions. Warlock removes your Health faster than you can look without nearly any option for counterplay if you don't get early removal. Malacrass beats nearly all other classes, though seems very weak against Warlock and if they get lucky Rogue. Shaman can summon 12/12 of stats for 4 Mana and possibly activate Keleseth battlecry three times. 
---
The whole brawl is incredibly dependent on getting lucky in terms of matchup and draws.
---
Gotcha. That makes sense. Thanks! :)
---
Not Baku's fault. We should move the design and test team to wild.
---
Not sure if there's enough people to call them team tbh.
---
Yes you did, but realy i almost did 100 dmg that game and still lost
---
I don't think they're intended to be counters to one another, but I like to order them similar to the colors in Magic based on shared philosophy. The two classes beside a class would allies in that they see eye to eye more than any other class, while the two farthest away classes would be enemies who have diametrically opposed philosophies. The order I use is:
---
&gt; Druid &gt; Paladin &gt; Priest &gt; Mage &gt; Rogue &gt; Warlock &gt; Hunter &gt; Shaman &gt; Warrior &gt; Druid
---
Except for, you know, creatureless combo.
---

I would prefer to play low tier gimmicky decks at wild just for fun. :) You can also add me just for friends if you want but I'm mostly casual!
---
Wich triggers first when they were summoned at the same time?
---
I think wild should just be wild and instead there should be a 3rd play mode that changes inbetween expansions. 
---
Standard/Wild/Alternative.
---
Alternative rotates existing cards in and out. It's more dynamic to the point that it can contain only a few cards from each expansion instead of all of them. One season the strongest deck will be thief rogue and the next season it will be grimy goons warrior. Each meta will see decks clash that have no business versing each other.
---
Wild will remain as is. A place for the most insane and OP decks to exist. It's never designed to be balanced. 
---
Alternative is where you get to try fresh new metas.
---
Have you thought that getting something for your efforts can be considered fun ?
---
Depends if it's friend or foe
---
I don't think they'd put in a neutral weapon, but, no,it'd be unplayable.
---
Its the nature of aggro. If you haven't won by turn 7 then you have lost. Just what happens when you play RNG decks.
---
Oh really? I may just need to start playing again then.  :D
---
I actually really liked how Hunter had an actual removal package with Candleshot and Hunter's Mark. If the class didn't have DK Rexxar, I don't think Mark would've been nerfed.
---
No... normally if you have a Baku you would get 1600. Instead you only get 400 because you have the golden. Crafting the Golden is free because you get it back so that is a wash. Net loss of 1200.
---
Hi,If you have 7 Doomguards you'll get (200 (2 copies) start of the year + 100 for disenchanting (5 copies)=300 dust , if you keep two copies), but if you keep none  ,you ll get 200 (start of the year) + 140 for disenchanting 7 copies = 340 dust, and thats the result of the formula or maybe i dont understand you
---
Not really. In a lot of matchups the best card is straight up hyena, sometimes it's tundra rhino, vs odd pally it's unleash... it's a very powerful card but hardly the best in every matchup.
---
Yeah, this might have been a better idea.
---
Still, I wonder what kind of decks would have happened if they didn't rotate them out. I mean, sure it would've been similar to what we know (hence why they were rotated) but probably lots of unplayed classical cards would've made a return, due to the smaller card pool.
---
Also your post remind me of something I wish they did, something that I think would be better than the current system: Expansions rotating by themselves. So instead of 3 rotations happening in april, we'd have 1 expansion rotating in april, 1 in august, 1 in december. The meta would change a lot more that way.
---
What?
---
In BOTH formats too!
---
And without the overload.  Plus you have beast synergy.
---
Eh. The skull you can account for. That wave of demons that is coming somewhere after turn 10 you can’t stop easily.
---
I find odd warrior to be even worse without the quest. The win condition is litterally to bore you to death.
---
You’re right. I crafted them both golden the day they announced rotation.
---
I'm with you here. So many people giving Baku and Genn the finger, but I thought they added a neat twist to the game. In exchange for super powers, you can't use half the cards available to you. But I also understand why they killed them off. It must have been a pain to design around them. "This card is crazy strong with Baku, but if we raise it's cost by one it kind of sucks, and if we lower it by one, it's too powerful."
---
That Alternate format will have a very rough time attracting any sizable playerbase if the format is determined completely by whoever curates the cards.
---
Depends on the rank you tend to play on, but when you start to climb you'll face decks so in a much higher power level. It's no fun to get played Barnes into Y'shaarj in turn 4
---
No none at all if anything everything is better. The only thing I can think of that can get annoying is Barnes 
---
What if he recycles another Rusty Recycler, so that he can be recycled afterwards?
---
If you craft a golden copy You'll get only 400 dust (but with golden copy) instead of 1600 If you keep the non-golden, so basically You'll be losing 1200 for upgrade yo a golden one
---
Ah, I knew some were rotating out but I thought some were staying (and would risk reigning supreme).
---
Good to know! 
---
Still, worried about what new OTK Blizzard will print. They're printing new ones almost every expansion now (sometimes they work, sometimes they don't). If they print a new one when the card pool is much smaller (thus, less things to pressure them) the requirements for it to work will be lower, as it'll be easier for them to survive long enough.
---
I bet you’re fun at parties
---
So it's worth it to craft those now, right?

If you're disenchanting them anyway, it's better to leave them alone and not craft them golden. It's only profitable to craft golden cards when you don't have them. 3200 on the normal versions, plus 800 for disenchanting for 4k dust. If you craft golden, you only get 3200 dust. Better to craft the other odd/even cards you don't have golden if you wanna make some free dust.

the game is better when priest is bad.
---
So is the 0 mana dragon. Would have been neat with Menagerie Magician and Zoobot

Confirmed, Cyanigosa is a new legendary.

It'll depend on the person.

People who want Wild to be the place where their old tier one or two Standard decks are still competitive will find themselves more disappointed as time goes on.
---
People who want Wild to be the place where the most absurd card combinations, combos, and decks can exist from the entirety of Hearthstone's card pool will only get more out of the format as time goes on.
---
I mean you can absolutely try it. You might beat every other deck you go up against. But you’ll know what I mean when you go against Barnes and Mill.
---
Mage.
---
friending you now
---
Is it a bad thing?
---
I mean they did nerf patchs and raza before they went to wild....FOR wild players seeing as the 2 were very dominate. We also had the naga sea witch and aviana nerf's. So they have done stuff for wild. It's just not support ANYWHERE NEAR as much as standard. 
---
Why is this not allowed but this two are allowed :O https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/aw67dz/ill_never_forget_you_tar_creeper/
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/awf0up/none_shall_survive_in_wild/
---
Both are at the frontpage too as of this time.
---
Still would be an issue in wild
---
Can I just buy golden Baku now, get the free dust, then disenchant it after hall of fame? Or does it only apply to cards you got before they announced the nerf 
---
They’re all the same shitty basic deck. They don’t win enough games to raise their MMR but when they’re connected online 24/7 it’s probably pretty easy to make 100 gold a day just from disconnects and terrible players because of the sheer volume of games played. 
---
I do understand that, however all examples given had the same “golden/non golden” format. For example on Metabomb:
---
-If you own one Golden copy of a card and any number of non-Golden versions of it, you will receive dust equal to the value of the Golden version as well as one non-Golden edition.
---
-If you own two Golden copies and any number of non-Golden versions, you will receive dust equal to the value of two Golden copies.
---
But no mention of just having non gold.
---
As a Reno deck, you should have far more tech slots to disrupt those decks if you want.
---
I agree that no one can be omniscient and be able to see how every card will be played and what their role will be. However, I refuse to believe that the dev team did everything in their power in order to make it to where Baku and Genn were balanced enough to be played. Since the year of the mammoth was so strong, they either needed to create cards that were on par with them, they didn't as then we would be creating the problem all over again, or nerf the existing "trouble maker" cards and just turn them back once the rotation hits and they are sent to wild. Waiting an entire year for the eventual rotation was unbelievable lazy for Blizzard as they did nothing for an entire year and when it comes time for the next expansion they sigh and say "Genn and Baku are still going to be a problem, I guess we have to hall of fame them". They get praise from the community whilst also not doing anything until the last minute.
---
I'm still a little pissed that one of my all time favorite bosses is just a gimmick card.
---
&gt; Just like last year, you will be able to keep your copies of these card once they move to the Hall of Fame, and you’ll also be granted the full Arcane Dust value for each card ( *up to the maximum number that can be used in a deck*).
---
So you'll only get your dust for your highest value legendary (gold or non-gold) and your 2 highest value common/rare/epic (gold or non-gold). Doesn't matter what else you have or in what quantity 
---
I mean, exactly what i just said was that its horrible. Also what i meant was that you can equip it to use later, just like you used to do with FWAxe in the old times to utilize later. Can, not have to
---
Ya just even new portraits. 
---
how is Mill Rogue that bad?
---
Gotcha. Thanks! That’s how I understood it initially, but the phrasing on all the news sites had me second guessing myself. I appreciate the clarification!
---
I thnik he should have said no big minions. Or no sticky minions. 
---
Uhh I think they were a little more than friends...
---
As a player since BRM i totally agree. I have almost 1500 wins with pally and warlock and around 800 with all the other classes. I’m always stuck in dad legend because i’m a full full time student but I totally agree
---
### You already have a regular one and want to upgrade
---
1. You have a regular version and 3200 dust.
---
2. You do nothing.
---
3. Next season, you have a regular version and 4800 dust.
---
2. You disenchant it. You have no card and 3600 dust.
---
3. You craft a golden copy. You have a golden copy and 0 dust.
---
4. Next season, you have a golden version and 3200 dust.
---
The cost for the upgrade is 1600 dust. Outside of HoF refunds, an upgrade costs 3200 - 400 = 2800 dust, which means you save 1200 dust by doing it *before* the HoF refund.
---
### You don't have any copy
---
1. You have 3200 dust.
---
2. You craft a regular copy. You have 1600 dust.
---
3. Next season, you have a regular copy and 3200 dust.
---
2. You craft a golden copy. You have 0 dust.
---
3. Next season, you have a golden copy and 3200 dust.
---
The card was free and you should always craft the golden one.
---
Yesterday I got blood of the ancient one and then discovered molten reflection form primordial glyph and summoned the 🅱️ANCIENT ONE
---
They have the capability to have infinite value by shuffling their cards back into their decks. They also force their opponent to overdraw and go into fatigue really quickly.
---
Thank you for not dropping the 10 phase maximize every single dust possible text. This suffices for almost everyone
---
That’s the trade off of aggro. Sure you did 100 damage that game but you also had the potential to do 30 within the first 7 turns before he had any taunt besides witch wood grizzly (moshogg enforcer, 2/14 Devine shield costs 8 so it wouldn’t be played). Also realize that what is meta (wall not aggro) is going to be better. When aggro is good you win on turn 5.  Just saying that you did 100 damage isn’t representative of what happened, or what should have happened had both decks been optimal. I’m not saying wall priest (or Druid when it was good) feel fair to play against, but similar to having to wait out aggro while they hit themselves out, you gotta kill slower decks before they get online. Aggro shouldn’t kill control (combo, whatever you want to call wall priest) in the late game. If you were able to, aggro would never lose cause it wins early, normally falls off in mid and is useless late. Remove losing late from that equation and aggro would be the only archetype.
---
Even just the top card per class and the top neutral might be interesting
---
&gt; Kabbum, Maddest Bomber is an example of a really cool card that Blizzard would never print because of its complicatedness
---
Pretty doable if they make it a bit less wordy ("lose 1 durabilty" vs "reduce its durability by 1")
---
Could even make it "has a chance to explode"
---
Nice rock!
---
I feel 4hp would've made much more sense, especially when you compare it to the Paladin's self dmg shrine (when you take damage deal 5 to enemy hero).
---
Worked as intended!
---
Normally it would, but they're being Hall of Famed which is different.
---
Technically costs 1200 to upgrade but its still a heavy discount
---
That would explain it. I thought it was the same as if a card was nerfed.
---
Waiting for bots to time out turns is horrendous user experience and offputting for players. Blizzard would not do that.
---
Man I really wish I didn’t use all of my dust to get them if they were only going to be out for a year.
---
That always summons the same minion, not random dragons.
---
I really love this disco ball on One Night's, but I started in KFT so I missed all of those :( I really wish there was some way to go back and get them, or just pay for them.
---
Paladin’s is stronger because it can activate on your opponent’s turn and 5 damage per hit is generally stronger than what Warlock can pull off to themselves.
---
It's a shrine that can only affect the game during the Warlock's turn much like Warrior's reduce the cost of dragons in your hand shrine. In Rumble Run, its reasonable.
---
It's more that the Warlock deck for this Tavernbrawl is way overtuned to work with its shrine where as others such as the Priest deck have cards with anti-synergy with their shrine like Dancing Swords.
---
Cards like "gem thief" make me think that it would be really cool for hearthstone to have a "fun" expansion that exists outside of standard/wild (presumably additionally to the normal expansion, perhaps instead of single player content). There's a lot of interesting design space that's too wonky for normal expansions.
---
Kray-ken as Kripp would say
---
Thank you! 
---
About one in nine...
---
Lol
---
Jaina on the rag
---
I‘m kinda new to hearthstone and i played a little bit. Today the game told me to win 5 games to open my chest. I did it over the day and now it says i can open my story at the end of the season. How does this work exactly?
---
It opens automatically at the start of a new season (First day of the month)
---
Who won in Group A? 
---
I missed it. 
---
I believe that the first expac Violet Hold, where some evil Bronze dragon flight guy escapes. The protagonists follow him to Pandaria (or wherever the 2nd expansion is) and they do whatever, then it concludes with the bronze dragonflight in expac 3.
---
What would the overall theme of the year be?
---
He was, briefly, one of the stronger cards in the game. 
---
You’d run him as a finisher in spell based decks in the hope the lord of madness would cast a bunch of spells that killed your opponent or saved your life. He would cast after he died back then, and the average HS spell was beneficial for the caster, so you normally ended up with a few secrets and a board of some kind. 
---
Eventually it was determined that casting after his death/transformation was too strong, so they got rid of that part. 
---
damn, 6 years on reddit and you still managed to miss the joke
---
bad bot
---
0 mana 1/1 pirate would improve standard pirate rogue a lot
---
Yeah, as a Magic player, we've had cards like this and they're white powerful--and not in a good way.
---
But why?
---
Fresh from wizard 101 I see.
---
Your ideas are garbage. Cloning device to 4 Mana?
---
You don't understand it at all. 
---
This game, for me, is good enough for a free game to be played on the toilet. That's it. That's all HS is to me. 
---
Now it has the *potential* to be a game that I would play a lot, even spend money on it. But it's not there. So it will remain this casual mobile game that I have no reason to spend money on/play more seriously. It doesn't mean I don't enjoy the quick shit. 
---
Just because I critique the game doesn't mean I'm playing it 24/7 and hating on it. 
---
I mean it was obvious vorgebetetes going to be useful crafts because of the high power level and versatility, not sure why you wouldn’t have crafted them asap if you actually wanted to play with them.
---
Good point actually. 
---
I also hope these are just some hundred random trolls who wanna farm gold but... World of Tanks for example has a Testserver before they implemented Bots officially in the Matchmaker. Maybe this is Blizzards testphase before they make it official, but i am just guessing here of course. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also i agree with you that its never a great experience (also in WoT) if you are confronted with bots, but its still better than having horendes waitingtimes , or finding no opponent at all.
---
Sindragosa and Elise? Man I want to play what meta you've been playing.
---
Also, Fire Fly leaving is insane for so many decks
---
Yeah rough deck that mate, so good it's considered the bottom of tier 4.
---
You might see it 1 in 100 games.
---
Upvote for  **∴** 
---
The problem of Maddest Bomber is that playing the card means the bomb would explode on your own side if the opponent plays perfectly, unless you buff the durability of the weapon. This is because the opponent can always end the turn with the bomb's durability at 7, 4 and 1, and then the bomb would pass over to the original player and lose the last durability.
---
Poor Yogg, turned into a Frogg
---
But Yogg can do you far dirtier than that. The best one I ever had immediately played Psychic Scream, saving me from death the next turn. When my opponent drew and played my Yogg two turns later, the loyal boy cast Myra’s Unstable Element, then Dinomancy then Cataclysm, leaving my opponent with no cards and a hero power that needs creatures to work.
---
"Escape from Violet Hold" Sounds SUPER Hearthstone-like. 
---
Fingers crossed thats it, it would make me super happy. Also we already know the devs try to tell a coherent Story over 3 Expansions. Prisoners escpaping (1st expansion), fleeing to place X (2nd expansion) and getting captured/help dealing with an overwhelming problem by working together (3rd expansion) would be possible!
---
I see it about every 10 games.
---
Actually they have been more responsive than ever, including with this hall of fame action. Personally it makes me very happy because the increased readiness to valence combined with the weaker average power level of the last couple expansions makes me a lot more confident in their overall design, and I think the game will end up in a much healthier state. Sad that it’s only happening now because who knows what’s going on with Blizzard. Hearthstone might be next on the chopping block, although I doubt it since it’s probably the game with the by far highest profit margins. 
---
weird, it showed the reply in my inbox
---
And? How else is it supposed remember your deck lists, log the matches in hsreplay and display the overlay in hearthstone? 
---
You wouldn’t like doomguard if handbuff warlock gets some good cards this year.
---
Live and die, insect!
---
That's a fair point, but I don't recall handbuffing ever being too crazy in ladder.
---
Well you know blizzard finished already the next 3 expansions and maybe there are cards involved which are once again way too good with doomguards 
---
Maybe thats how they react?
---
Thanks a lot, bud.
---
Could be the case. Just wanted to see if the subreddit had my reasoning or was there something I was missing.
---
You can't be serious.

---
Every successful Zoo Warlock deck has played two copies of Doomguard since the inception of the game, and Zoo Warlock has been a viable option of ladder for every format in the game's history except for maybe three.
---
It is generally tired and played out, and Zoo Warlock really should start trying to play a different curve topper.
---
What i was saying was very simple - you are making a mountain out of a molehill.
---
I own 2 of every upcoming HoF card in either normal or gold, but i have like 15k spare dust. Am i right to assume that i gain literally nothing from upgrading my normal odd/even cards to gold?
---
That's because I linked your username. :)
---
The deck for the tavern brawl is overtuned to work with it. That is the issue.
---
In Rumble Run, the shrine is alright but hardly something that's going to result in an auto-win.
---
u/j8sadm632b your just a bit admit it
---
Except that's not what he's considering. Don't be dense.
---
Yup! 30 legendaries deck. Not really competitive but a lot of fun.
---
If you turn 1600 dust into 400 dust, you're not profiting. 
---
This in theory seems like a good idea, but the reality is that it could easily be abused. Take freeze mage, it was always kept from overrunning things by control warrior. If it could ban that matchup away, then it just walks to victory. 
---
Conversely, the meta also just cycles. Deck a, banning b is best, so then deck c emerges that bans deck a, deck d that bans c, and so on until you’re just chasing the meta. 
---
my bad!
---
Also, blizzard is trying to forget Charge ever happened.  It doesn't feel like a Warlock ability as well.
---
Yeah it's certainly draw dependent and I'm sure could be improved. I stole the deck from one of Dane's streams and modified it based off some cards I didnt have myself. Call Pet would probably be better in a pure Big deck, rather than this midrange version. 0 mana Bearshark isn't bad, but I much prefer 2 mana Highmanes and 5 mana King Krush haha.
---
wouldn't Mecha'thun still work with Jade spellstones, and Biology project? You play 'Thun, then innervate, then biology project, then both stones. I hate that this is such a large combo though, it really takes apart the decks anti aggro tools
---
Okay that last one is where I draw the line. Damn you, Arcane Tracker!
---
Gave me flash backs to my childhood, playing different RPG's and needing to keep track of important information.
---
My theory is that Doomguard will over preform with the next set.   When after completing the next set, they saw powerful interactions and decided to get it fixed before April release date.
---
Because it’s not good yet since I think they’re afraid of a handbuff deck having too many good charge minions. Do you really wanna play against a deck where they can play a 9/5 Leeroy into a 9/11 doomguard all with charge? 
---
It will be again. Too powerful of a card, just not the right meta at the moment. Same as [[Harrison Jones]] and [[The Black Knight]]. [[Ysera]], [[Baron Geddon]], and [[Alexstrasza]] fit the same mold, but are currently played.

I know nothing about the subject at hand, but I truly despise it when people conveniently sidetrack the discussion to grammar.
---
If its experimental at all, I would love to see them toy around with buffing old nerfed cards, or just messing around and buffing groups of the least played 5 cards at a time
---
Thank you for the wonderful advice. I didn't realize there would be a rotation right when I would return. Good thing I did not craft anything, not that I could even if I wanted to though (f2p hehe). Having done a bit of research, it seems the core of my deck will be rotating out to wilds sometime next month...
---
They didn't even try to nerf it kinda lame
---
Whatever the hunter deck with 2 hyena and lynx and whatnot Everyone plays these days. mid-range hunter, control hunter doesn't matter with a ton of big rush taunts with leech :p
---
You almost insulted him, but you ended up looking dense. 
---
I don't think you do, if you're running low on memory then the Hearthstone app can restart during sleep. You're almost guaranteed to lose a turn or two that way.
---
Yes! Nerf the top played cards buff the least played cards
---
I thought the screen capture was only required to  record your rank for HSreplay , and everything else would function if you withheld that permission...
---
Modern problems require... Timeless solutions 😁
---
Thats funny because i always considered odd pally an auto lose for my odd rogue. Im pretty sure i beat them once ever, i think, and it was because of a turn 1 dire mole coin dire mole. I just kept clearing his recruits. The other times i just couldnt keep up aggrowise.
---
I panicked for a moment because I thought I missed 2 damage but forgot that the violet worm's death also gave me 2 points of damage :D
---
That has nothing to do with why there isn’t a deck tracker on iOS
---
Odd pally was total aids before the level up nerf i think i beat that deck one time ever.
---
Everyone ignore this guy. He's a Verizon/Apple shill lol
---
Permission limitations don't? Care to elaborate and how you can have a deck tracker without being able to read data from the hearthstone app?
---
No, I didn’t play it for about 8 turns after this.
---

Straight up thought this was a video...

---
Read it again, you are the one who doesn’t know how to math. Golden crafting gives the user more options while not restricting anything (unless you have 0 dust now or you have ZERO interest in Golden’s)
---
&gt;	Setting app data as world accessible is a poor security practice as access is granted to everyone and there is no way to limit access to only the intended recipient(s). This practice has led to information disclosure leaks, confused deputy vulnerabilities, and is a favorite target for malware that targets apps with sensitive data (such as email clients). In Android 9 and higher, sharing files this way is explicitly disallowed for apps with targetSdkVersion&gt;=28.
---
Android 9 is on &lt;0.1% of devices LOL
---
So the gist is get as much dust as u can, craft the cards the spreadsheet tells you to craft, then when the cards rotate out, disenchant them and you gain dust?
---
Just to clarify for me cause im a bit confused, is the dust returns different for cards getting HoF'ed compared to nerfed? for nerfs, if you enchant a card, costs you full dust, then you can disenchant the card for full dust, netting you nothing. How is this different
---
Wait, what? How?
---
Dean Ayala answeared in an interview on Value Town that they really liked dirty rat and we should expect more cards like that in the "short term future" - so probably this expansion.
---
okay well before shadow visions was a card, divine spirit inner fire decks were never competitive, and now since shadow visions they have been consistently powerful.
---
Without a way to duplicate and tutor copies of inner fire/divine spirit, the entire shell will cease to exist.
---
FWIW, there are Egyptian-type heiroglyphics on the second image's border. Uldum would be the WoW equivalent of Egypt.
---
How would you nerf Genn and Baku? 
---
Yes, that's your own app's data. If a developer decides to set app data as world accessible, their data can be accessed by other apps. Not the other way round. Great job shifting the goalposts though.
---
No, seriously. If you're that worried about Spectral Cutlass's increasing durability, put two Oozes in your deck. A lot of the value in that rogue deck is actually in the weapon, so if you can sandbag it, they'll be a lot worse off.
---
I mean lets compare voidlord to another 9 mana neutral taunt minion. Giant Mastadon has 6/10 Points worth of stats. Voidlord 6/19 worth of stats that can get resummoned a turn after + 3/9 worth of stats. Not Talking About how you can cheat it out on turn 6 or 7. Yes realy Balanced Card realy fair Card hope they will print a Fair Card like this next Expansion again :)
---
Ah yes Glenn Gleymane!
---
I loved Handbuff Pally, might just play this when the expansion rolls over! Thanks for sharing
---
I hope so would means there's a much more viable way to deal with OTK and combo decks 
---
Thank you for your insight :)
---
Win-condition is big hp boy + glitter moth + void ripper
---
But I'll check it, thanks
---
I actually really like that "sacrifice" part a lot. That would have been an elegant solution 
---
Can we please have resurrect priest nerfed in wild?
---
I couldn’t agree more. Every time the location of a HS expansion is known we never really seem to get it 100% correct, since we don’t take HS’s wackiness into account.
---
Think about when we were teased with the “Greetings from Gadgetzan” postcard before MSoG was announced. Everyone automatically assumed that “tiny little Gadgetzan” wouldn’t be anything exciting, and the expansion would take place someplace nearby like the Caverns of Time or a pirate ship. Or how about when Boomsday Project was teased with a Netherstrom Portal, and we all assumed we were getting an Ethereal-themed expansion because we couldn’t predict Boom Labs.
---
When we got Stranglethorn, it was given a colosseum flair. When we got Gilneas, it was given an extra haunted-forest flavor that fit perfectly. When we got Un’Goro, we were given a whole new assortment of wacky types of dinosaurs and explorers we’ve never seen before in other Warcraft content.
---
Personally, while I love Dalaran there feels to be something missing when I hear it, and that is the zany HS vibes. If we go there I’m sure some crazy shit’s gonna go down somehow, and a prison break from Violet Hold could be the perfect thing to shake things up HS style.
---
Not likely. If you've ever played any of the automatic Yugioh simulators or MTG Arena, you'll know just how much slower those games move along relative to Hearthstone because you or your opponent is holding onto a card that can be played in response to something.
---
Plus, Hearthstone does not split turns up into phases like either MTG or Yugioh, which would make it difficult to active effects similar to Yugioh's Threatening Roar effectively.
---
&gt;1/1 welp...
---

---
Nah, he was teased as “definitely NOT a Dragon!!!” So clearly he is just a regular purple troll. /s
---
My pleasure.

Will do!
---
I do see where you are coming from and would certainly pose an issue but its fun to think about atleast
---
many thanks :D
---
I think they will keep it to being secrets. 
---
1 is a winning position because the weapon switches control before it loses durability.

I still think the best legend reward would be that the legend cardback upgrades every time you hit legend. Getting more badass over time

Amara, the Warden: "You are safe now."
---
[Shirvallah, the Tiger:](https://media.giphy.com/media/3osBLA53AVzn746dXi/giphy.gif)
---
Same, but from my opponents experience.
---
If you get the weapon with 3 durability and you give it to your opponent with 1 durability they can just not attack and you take the damage. It always hits you if they know what to do.
---
I think the people who care enough to want movable deck slots already know this and just, you know, want movable deck slots.
---
Woah, who’d have thunk it?

It says exactly what i said, ranks 5-legend all get the same reward of 1 golden epic and 3 golden commons. The part about 5 dust per star, equal to 25 extra dust by hitting legend is false. The 3rd box you open is just random sometimes with no link between what star you hit. For the others commenting it seems really hard to understand for them idk why.
---
Exactly. The card very often feels useless late game, and that is not when draw cards should feel useless. 
---
Furthermore, you can’t evaluate card power in a vacuum. The prominent synergetic cards have to be considered too.
---
This seems to be a screenshot from the alpha build. If you look at the background, more cards are different from what they are now.
---
0% winrate against French HS players.

Bruh I would have CRIED! 
---
Voidlord, Doomguard, Skull, Pact, Defile, Cube, Spellstone, Gul’dan, Lackey, Librarian, Taldaram, and Umbra are all rotating out. 
---
Cubelock, and any possible variations of it, are 100% dead in standard. 
---
So, everything this year will be about "Dalaran". And also this year Dalaran will move into 3 locations and that´s the crossover among expansions?
---
Some number of people were seeded with it when it was released. 
---
Now that you've mentioned it, rouge hero looks like it's a Vulpera.
---
Or you know, you could have attacked with the 1/1s before the wurm, to deal 4 damage, or before the defile for 2. 
---
Yes, and also it basically prevents any weapons from being played at all. If you’re a rogue, you can’t even hero power without taking 10 to the face...
---
I have an S7 and it runs perfectly. It's extremely minimal overhead. Shouldn't affect performance on any phone really.
---
Yes.
---
They should print Johnny Awesome and Dumass in the same set.
---
Yup
---
Elise is value if you’ve got decent card draw. Otherwise Lich king might be better. 
---
Tar creeper
---
God making players think... What a travesty that would be.
---
I've been out of arena for a while but zilliax has got to be really good. Lich King is very strong too, neither is a bad pick.
---
I get you. I named my Baku rogue “I Sold My Soul”
---
Lich King &gt; Zilliax &gt; Elise
---
Battlecry: Destroy both players mana crystals, deal 2 damage to each player for each crystal lost. 
---
What is that overlay?
---
I use it with a s9 myself its fantastic
---
Streak stars let you advance in ranks while losing more games than you are winning, it should definitely not be possible to achieve legend that way.
---
I get that you want the card back, but giving it away like that is not going to make people happier.
---
If they made legend easy to get, In a few months time you'll make a new tread about wanting to get to high legend and not just dumpster legend.
