i agree, although i think the turn limit should be increased to something like 120 turns. currently, it‚Äôs possible to draw an otherwise winnable game in long drawn out control games. the 90 turn limit was made with only classic in mind, and not modern cards that can extend a game for a long or near infinite amount of time.

Lifecoach left for Gwent and is kinda their figurehead proplayer now. Amaz plays Autochess, Hauf and Trump still play. Reynad RL stuff (and busy with Tempostorm management I guess), Forsen variety stream.
---
Free tip.  The decks/players are comparatively worse then their Standard counterparts.  Probably easier to hit Rank 10 in Wild with that list then Standard (imo).
---
Plus, you can just play for fun in Wild.  What do you have to lose?  Not your Standard Ranks.

---
Yea making the game seem less pay to play doesn't make any sense.

It was an arena game. At first the rogue got t9 Jaina from Hallucination. Then they got Hir'eek from one Weaponized Pinata. I couldn't clear all the copies so he used Splintergraft from another Pinata on one of the 1/1 Hir'eeks. Then the attached pic happened.
---
oh i see, well thats not actually a new interaction or anything, if a minion has a debuff and you copy it its still gonna have that debuff.
---
2048 dust, 1.7 legendaries and 4.6 epics are easily worth more than the $30(?) difference between the 50 and 80 pack pre-order. You are effectively getting 6.6k worth of dust for $30, which is pretty unbeatable (and this is at the tail end of marginal returns - the first $50 ARE better value, but $30 gets you a pretty good deal).

My only issue is that they should make a change on how people are getting cards though. Took me a year to make a semi functioning deck with the limited cards that I had and 2 months to actually enjoy the game.

I've heard rumors that they are adding in a suprise patch for next week that we undo the jaina nerfs.

&gt; No a class card can creep over a previous class card, but typically class cards are about 1 mana cheaper than neutrals with the same stats/effect.

Class cards that are 1 mana cheaper than neutrals also tend to be 1 mana cheaper than other class cards.

You don't need to run anymore "copy generators" just enough to go for 90 turns and then the rest of the deck can ether be formatted like a control deck while you draw pieces or just filled to the brim with draw

You make a valid point, but Kripp is a horrible example. He's not toxic at all.

Leeroy Jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board. Fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of Hearthstone more fun and compelling, but taking 20+ damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive.

[Hey I got one too.](https://i.imgur.com/Os85RCy.jpg) Blizzard used to sell them on their online merch page. They light up and play a jaunty tune, however they're surprisingly big, heavy, fragile, the inside velvet never really adhered to the resin, and they cost a couple hundred bucks. It still makes me stupid happy to have it on my desk, and the only real problem I have with it is I only had it for about a week and a half before the little gryphon from the  Stormwind gameboard flew off and bolted out the window before I could catch it (I think the neighbors cat got it).
---
I play on mobile (android)
---
Joining this game as a free to play player doesn't make any sense at all. You're so far behind it's just not worth your time to play this game. It seems like everytime one of these threads is made and goes unanswered Hearthstone losses some players. 
---
This game isn't losing players at a slow pace either. It's happening at a moderate pace. I've spent about $300 on this game and i barely play it. I think i'm right at the cutoff point where the game won't be worth my time. I almost spent $400 on Amazon coins to get $500 worth of hearthstone cards but then i realized how absurd that was. I think i'll buy the $80 expansion but not to sure what i'll do beyond that. 
---
Something needs to change. Hopefully Blizz will listen this time.
---
* If I need a Death Knight, I will always bottom deck it.
---
* I should never run big minions against Mage. They always have Polymorph in hand. (Yes, even after casting it twice)
---
* My Mage opponent's "random" effects will always benefit them and always negatively impact me.
---
* I either win by turn 8 against Mage, or I lose to Frost Lich Jaina.
---
* As you can see by the other complaints, if this game doesn't want me to have fun, it will make me play against Mages.
---
* Tesspionage Rogue? I think you mean Rogue Rogue.

I get that a class card makes a difference but if it's a Combo or Battlecry makes no difference. The rager doesn't have either

---
I had a similar case playing an academic espionage deck in wild. The guy played odd rogue, and he spammed "Well played" the last turn to show that he has lethal and that I should concede... Yep but RNG is strong in this deck. I won the game by doing a fair amount of damage and added the guy after the game. He accepted. I said "Never BM kiddo..." He replied : "Ha ha, well played" and I removed him.

i'm impatient i guess.

Found the mage
---
Before big priest got super popular I used to play a version with mirage callers and blood of the ancient ones. About 60% percent of matches I would be able to get the ancient one out and it was glorious. When it was dealt with, summoning 4 mana 30/30 was the greatest thing ever. I really love the concept of special summons like it and the darkness and would love to see them.
---
No,please, stop it... D:
---
Pretty much t1 during the early days
---
Just realized you have to use shaman hero power 4 times to make a guy summon Windlord and use odd mage hero power also 4 times to make Jana summon Firelord. Hmm.. Coincidence?? I don't think so...
---
They probably have to clean all the spilled beer off the schedules (that they scribbled onto napkins) first.
---
just make odd shaman hero power summon two totems pls

I'm playing HS for more than 4 years now and i never really understood how brawl works. It seems like brawl almost always favors Warrior. Very rarely i won the brawl and when i did  my worst minion was the one that survived on the board. Does anyone know how brawl works? It's a 50% chance to survive a minion on your board or the opponent's board no matter how many minions you control? Or this chance changes accordingly on how many minions are on the board?
---
Yea but he gets it from a neutral pinata
---
Best. Brawl. EVER!!!!!!!!
---
https://i.imgur.com/tL8EHK5.jpg
---
That‚Äôs how you decide which play to make and compare your options. "Do I wanna clear or develop my own threat?" "Which one if preferable?" "What's the best play my opponent has the next turn vs my next turn?" "In the long run, who has the better chance of winning?" "What is my opponent's weakness and how do I use it my advantage?" and so on, when you ask the right question you have a good foundation to make better plays
---
What? Isn't it usable? I'm pretty sure it just rolls a random one when all four are on the board
---
Oh, yes. Restricting sets per "season". I'm not an arena player, nor really much of a player at this point. Too much rng for me to take the game seriously. I just do quest and log off. I hope you find the fun in it again :)
---
Lol, this is funny, would be better if a video would be made for this ouo
---
good bot
---
More effective would be just to control 4 random totems rather than all 4 basic totems and increase mana cost of stormcaller to 6 or 7 to prevent absurd combos with alakir.

Ever heard of weekends?
---
Deathstalker Rexxar, Hagatha, Frost Lich Jaina and Bloodreaver Gul'dan are cards that opponents will always play on curve.
---
Yeah, I love Brode, but the whole "there needs to be bad cards" thing he said back in the days of Purify (regardless of that card itself) was complete horseshit.
---
The only way that justification makes sense is specifically for cards in the Classic set, like Magma Rager, because there *is* an argument that new players can use them to learn about good and bad cards. Although honestly even then, I'd say Magma Rager could use a buff without it breaking the game. Making it a 5/2 instead of printing Ice Rager, for instance, wouldn't have made any sort of difference (though the Rager cards are admittedlyflavorful, so I suppose it's okay).
---
Are you serious? I consider myself experienced with and knowledgeable of hearthstone (I was a bit embarrassed you had to remind me that totems always roll one you don‚Äôt already have - I haven‚Äôt played in a while and am getting rusty) but I‚Äôve never seen this come up in any of my time playing or in any of the countless hours of hearthstone content I‚Äôve watched.

Are you okay,

Are you okay Priesty...

Yep. I don't do brawls where the intent is to win by turn 5 or earlier. I dislike the sorts of decks that do that. Not fun.

They mistook him for chicken and ate his flesh. Now they have charge + battlecry: summon two 1/1 whelps

He was refrrring to the special summoning for the ancient one, where you have to have two blood of the ancient ones on the board.
---
Tusk irk priest? 
---
He said for FUN not for money. 
---
Just about any coherent deck can hit Legend if you're willing to put in the time. And nothing in this game is truly infinite.

---
Maly rogue and big deathrattle rogue are 2 different decks and use illusionist differently. Maly rogue uses illusionist as part of its combo to drop maly for its finish. In big rogue it uses illusionist to cheat out other deathrattle minions early game so that you're not waiting until turn 7 to get a 7/7 mech dragon or turn 8 for lich king. You can drop illusionist as soon as turn 4 if you have the right hand for it.

I had a lot of fun, but there were also a lot of people playing anti-fun type decks. Overall, I liked it. 
---
I think it lools great! If your goal was to create an artwork that could be printed on a cart I think the colours are too dark and dont pop out enough. Even warlock or rouge (the classes with the darkest colour palette) pop out way more. As you are basicaly always seeing a miniature version of the cards you play in hand, it is very important that you can see what's going on with the cards

---
Welcome to wild, my friend!
---
I think April 9th, as it‚Äôll be first day of ROS expansion. Not quite sure how other seasons have transitioned on the first day, but there will probably be more news in the coming weeks on specifics.
---
Just read up on the Reno/Dragon theory! How did I miss this?!
---
I have hearthstone installed via the Amazon appstore, and I've been checking the cost in coins via the blizzard store in-app.  When I checked earlier this morning, it showed me the option of paying with money or coins.  Now when I check it says that a payment is being authorized, even though I haven't paid anything, so it sounds like that's similar to what you had happen to you.
---
I would attribute it to the live maintenance that's going on right now; it should be resolved shortly.
---
I am probably not far off you since I am f2p. I only had Malygos because of RNG in the classic pack
---
And I got Antonidas instead. :P
---
a room that you are supposed to just walk carefully around so as not to spawn any of the whelps
---
Yeah, I expect the same. I know on iOS the app is still in maintenance stage so there‚Äôs still ongoing work
---
Is there any way to keep an eye on your artworks? I really like them and having like a notification whenever you upload a new one would be awesome.
---
Well, PoE in general doesn't seem to be extremly popular on twitch. Currently between Overwatch and WoW. 
---
Nice. Always keep him, you dont know when fireballs will start flying in standard again...
---
Depends on my opening draw. If I got Malygos, there was a high chance to cancel the Mage secrets because I could draw the same using the rouge cards. 
---
Also gave a lot of options depending on draws. I could wait for Malygos and till then try upping Questing Adventurer. 
---
Had a lot of options. I would say it was 60-40 against this certain mage deck depending on luck. 
---
Hey! I'm everywhere on social media! You can just google "ramzykamen" as I post everywhere nearly 
---
Especially since he is my first and only golden legendary.
---
Or like a Wild mode that doesn‚Äôt allow legendary cards. I know starting out it was impossible to be competitive in either format without any powerful legendaries
---
Mine too!
---
Warlock represent!

This\^
---
It always happens on a Tuesday maintenance.  When they go into maintenance, the year ends.  When the servers come up, it's the next year with all HoF and stuff moved to Wild.
---
Not OP but it looks like a golden whizbang into trent druid 
---
Yep cant get in at all on mobile 
---
Your first login to Year of the Dragon is when the changes go live so you have until the servers go down to update on April 9th.   Usually, but not guaranteed, around 9-10 AM EST.
---
Ancestral Knowledge, Hero Power for +1 spell damage, Elemental Destruction x2.  
---
Did you win by fatigue?
---
It seems to upgrade at the start of your turn from the footage blizzard released 
---
I don't think it's viable, hand size is problematic
---
Is there more of your art anywhere? 
---
What is the theory?
---
It's the tech to beat combo for mid range decks. Buying yourself 4 turns only matters if your deck can kill a player in 4 turns. Some warrior decks can (quest warrior aggressively completing quest) and some cant
---
Slizzle466 since his time slot works for my schedule and he's super chill and amiable.
---
Why is that annoying? If you are playing any decent Wild deck you are heavily favored.
---
Shadowreaker is the main wincon right now, you bring the game to a crawl in the lqte game with the weasels and burn your opponent down with shadowreaker
---
If you dont have it then the alice benedictus pack is a must
---
There‚Äôs maintenance right now
---
I was about to ask this question, I‚Äôm having the same problem on my phone too. I‚Äôve already tried uninstalling and that didn‚Äôt fix anything.
---
1 drop, 3/15, cant attack, freeze any minions damaged by this minion.
---
Such a format would inherent some of the worst aspects of both Standard and Wild, and it would face an uphill battle trying to keep an active player base after the initial excitement around the format dies down.
---
Maintenance
---
I want to see variance, I take a break from standard to see some new shit in wild
---
Thanks !
---
Hadn‚Äôt logged on in a couple days.

Gul'dan hero power hurts a bit but it's still a plan
---
You just gave me an [idea](https://hearthcards.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/a6/95/38/ee/a69538ee.png).

You can discuss it on [r/customhearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/customhearthstone/comments/b2kk70/whats_going_to_happen_to_the_goat/)
---
Firebat and Zalae because they are good players and really chill to watch.

RegisKillbin and Warshack

A rotation and and new expansion always toss the game up I the air, sure, but what do you think is special about this rotation? Most standard meta decks will become wild if left untouched. We haven't seen enough of new cards to know if it'll be crazy or not. Plus the rotation will being in a new batch of players, further increasing the padding between worrying about top meta wild decks.
---
Stop posting this. Read the sub before resposting. This thing is posted literally every 10 minutes.
---
Clearly they have multiple departments at work. Doesn‚Äôt make me any less impatient. Especially while I‚Äôm at work refreshing every hour 
---
This is technically better than many actual in-game artworks.

Great job!

I'm talking about the majority of people in the thread my dude
---
Mana warm was being killed quickly by the opponent after I just put it down.
---
/r/oopsdidntmeanto
---
And odd mage is one of the weakest upgraded hero powers. Rogue one is like having a pre-nerf fiery war axe on 2 every game and paladin and warrior can pretty much solo entire decks just clicking the hero power button. These upgraded hero power are one of the main reasons why almost no 2 drops except Keleseth are played nowadays
---
Blumplunk, exilesrythm and solemhs. 
---
Sometimes also rudeclouds and azraelasltgets.
---
At least before posting
---
well, we had a tier 1 paladin deck that don¬¥t agree with the chart hehe. guess you need a new branch to the 10 mana otk murloc attack.
---
It does make the statement that ‚Äúthey can perform maintenance but not release reveal dates‚Äù a very bizarre one.
---
ok so apparently its under maintenance and i think that it'd be a lot more helpful if the login screen just outright said so
---
Agree, also the ; Master of Rituals, looks very strong. A 4 mana 4/4 by itself is already not too bad. But clearing a 4 hp minion and summon another 4 mana minion for free seems very strong. 
---
the cauldron from the witchwood still confuses me. Why let players mix and stir ingredients if the cauldron doesn‚Äôt actually do anything?
---
Yes. Let's make a format with an even higher barrier to entry relative to Wild where not even the cards given to players as they start playing are legal.
---
Grash seems like a lot of fun for the druid.
---
Is it still on?
---
He eventually noticed. Kripp told him to emote ‚Äúhello‚Äù three times before he killed him and the asshole did. 
---
Yeah, It¬¥s a little bit sad... It could do something like release some kinda ghost from there... :/
---
Yup happens with me. Apparently it‚Äôs maintenance 
---
Seems like a reasonable adaptation of maly rogue for standard since illusionist is rotating. It's not as strong as the illusionist one, but the power level of standard should drop dramatically with the rotation, so I could definitely see this being a tier 3, maybe even tier 2 deck.
---
Anyone else think this was just a cute frog from the thumbnail? 
---
I mean there is no way that future standard decks will hold up to the likes of the death knights such as Bloodreaver Gul'Dan, Jaina and or Rexxar (not to mention Genn and Baku).
---
Im not saying that the format will change a lot from what it is now, just that the complaint of "standard decks in wild" will probably vanish unless they print extreme powercreep on everything. (and devs stated they want to use this rotation to reduce the overall powerlevel of the game)
---
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre bringing back any of the old gods. They‚Äôve been done.
---
It does 
---
Based on his quality of play in the previous match, he was obliterated. Didn't even know what cards were in his hand. How much longer did the stream last from here? 
---
I definitely prefer Wild Constructed, but the diversity of decks does narrow significantly as you go up the ladder. 
---
What was his strategy in waiting so long to play the quest?
---
It's too much self face damage against aggro and not needed vs control 
---
From that list I would have to say, maybe, bonemare and spiteful summoner; everything else I think should stay in the nerfed state it‚Äôs in now
---

4/3/5 | Battlecry: Shuffle the 'Map to the Golden Monkey' into your deck.  
---
I encourage you to look up the word redundant.
---
One soul for crazy Liam and cauldron value is pretttttty good
---
I'm pretty sure that's paladin gear. I mean it's basically what Leeroy was lookin for in Blackrock spire.
---
They've hinted in the past (maybe around Boomsday) they were open to bringing back old Mechanics like Reno or C'thun.  However, I don't expect any Old Gods back this set and if there were one, C'Thun.
---
I too, ignore the upcoming maintenance alerts.
---
Yes, you are referring to Tinkertown Tech which was a really good card. And yes, it depends on the current lackey, but the one shown seems pretty good for rogue with combo initiators. 
---
Could be something, there's time yet
---
Creeper would be absolutely nuts in Odd Pally unnerfed. 5/5 for free super easily is OP.
---
but that means you basically only have two cards in your opening hand, which is a significant downside.
---
probably its because card power levels are low and nothing to get excited about?
---
Messed up the combo trying to go to fast. Kept it up for a long time 
---
What if you don‚Äôt own an Android device? Is buying coins a waste of money then?
---
I mean, a level 60 hunter must have won thousands of games lol
---
Yeah, that's why the median is farore representative of what you get on average, rather than the mean. Golden legendaries are the hugest outliers, but other golden rarities, epics, legendaries, they all skew the mean dust value so that it does not represent the average value of a pack. It only becomes representative in larger amounts.
---
None of the spare parts do anything the lackeys do soooo no they are not anything alike , nice try tho
---
After 70 packs the diminishing returns really kicks in, which is why preordering doesn't make sense for the most people. When I was farming gold, I stopped preordering in Ungoro and didn't feel 
---
any meaningful difference until I stopped playing on early Rakhastan Rumble.
---
any clip of that reaction?
---
That Reno is a dragon
---
Are you certain it's that old?
---
There had been secret removal earlier as well.
---
Interesting, thanks. 
---
Nope, only 288.
---
When I buy an arena ticket I am so afraid that something like this will happen
---
You could use an Android emulator then like Nox (bignox.com).  But you have to use *some* Android platform or it is a waste.
---
Agreed.¬†
---
The only time I spent actual money on expansion packs is when I bought whatever the 70 packs for $50 expansion with built up Amazon credits and Amazon coins from a few expansions ago, and was disappointed in the value it provided, as I still couldn‚Äôt play almost all of the more entertaining decks.¬†
---
I just don‚Äôt see how people can defend that monetary practice‚Ä¶ packs are essentially loot boxes, but I guess they think it‚Äôs OK because they‚Äôre cards?¬†
---
I‚Äôll just spend my money elsewhere from now on and play Hearthstone once in a while from the toilet.¬†
---
1 mana do something. Of course the game would suck if the effects overlapped. The lackeys effects are almost universally better than the spare parts.
---
Fledgling isn‚Äôt an OP arena card. Gastropod,  dragonmaw scorcher and the 4/8 dragon with taunt battlecry deal 2 dmg to all minions are much better. 
---
Mask of Mimicry: choose a minion. Minions in your hand become copies of it
---
Definitely do not unnerf leeching poison kingsbane is already tier 1 in wild (which is the problem with unnerfing most of these cards, they would mess up wild)
---
You often draw throw your deck much fastter then your opponent, and with the scream and weaseles you can reach fatigue and your opponent whould just not play weasels and you will lose
---
After you went throw your deck you will have the golden monkey and benedictus then monkey and roll the game with legendaries while your opponent draws weasles
---
This is a common way to lose with this deck, so i feel like its justified
---
This is pretty dank, I hope someone tries it
---
I mean we should forgive. That being said, the whole Kripp thing wasn‚Äôt a surprise to me, remember he slept in late and was DQd from a tournament IIRC.. so there you go for his maturity level.
---
I stopped watching Toast when he took off the mask to be honest, he was more like able back then, he was a character, which was different
---
Saronite Chain Gang did nothing wrong! It was the abomination that Shudderwock created in standard, but Chain dudes should be free in wild where Doppelgangster exists anyway, whatever handbuff synergy it had was wiped.
---
my deck doesnt run liam, i used the storm bringer to get the legendaries
---
Sounds really fun, will try
---
I was not trying to be rude or anything just my attempt at humor; anyway why not just share what spell did you in .. ?
---
Madame Lazul is already there to represent the Old Gods...
---
Cthun has Mechathun
---
Yogg is Zuljin
---
Ysharj is Captain Hooktusk 
---
Nzoth is Undatakah
---
 I think old gods will be skipped 
---
I think that 26% of the sub is responsible for about half of the 'nerf x' posts, those where every deck that beats their preferred deck is broken and Blizzard are incompetents for letting it be viable.
---
I would like Saronite Chain Gang getting unnerfed for some buff synergies but aside from that everything can stay the way it is.
---
If your  combo requires emptying your deck, you are better off just doing Mechathun.
---
You just need a 1 mana pre-emptive bump (either coin, galvanizer, or wanted)
---
Mechathun-&gt;Prep-&gt;Walk the Plank
---
Spells vs minions
---
I still play, but mostly to keep up with gold. Except for Genn and Baku, this entire hearthstone year has just felt like an extension of the year of the mammoth because of how much the cards and decks from those spaces dominate the meta. Hopefully with it and Genn and Baku gone the game will feel a lot fresher.
---
Zoo warlock is generally the go to for a cheap starting deck. I'd recommend looking for good aggressive or midrange decks online that aren't too pricey first, and then if you prefer control, saving dust and slowly building up for that. If you plan on being full free to play, I also recommend getting good at arena, as it is a good way to get packs and gold.
---
Yes - please make Caverns Below 4 minions and 5/5 like God intended it. What could go wrong?
---
Who knows, you can hace low level cards that are interesting/creative! 
---
I'm crazy about max efficiency in games. You would be surprised with how much people keep playing even without a chance (not to mention people that rope you for farming wins against them).
---
Bro, it was months ago and no one cares. Onward and upward.
---
He's asking for the schedule that Blizzard releases showing what date/time each card is going to be revealed
---
I see :) I'll be patient then. I'm don't really know when I should expect blizzard to do announcements... Anyhow, thank you lots! 
---
4 7/7? meet 7 10/10
---
I think I can give a reason for the difference between undead beasts not being beasts while undead pirates are pirates. Beasts are mortal, non-sapient organisms, while "pirate" is more of a lifestyle (ok, bad choice of word with some of them being dead) or profession, or a mindset, if you will. You might also call it a stigma, if you're coming more from a socio-psychological point of view. Anyway, to be called a pirate, there's no condition for you to be alive, mortal, or any particular sapient race.
---
Right, more often a 1/1 body is better than nothing. Only very occasionally would you rather have the spell.
---
Wasn't it Holy Smite instead of arcane shot?
---
They already confirmed there won't be a hero card (unless they're trolling us with a 'villain' card)
---
The rogue 100% deserved it if it worked, they have to deliberately not use the coin to test for counter  for that to work.
---
I thought they said no hero cards this expansion.
---
Everyone in here arguing and I‚Äôm just over here thinking - *that‚Äôs the whole point*.  They‚Äôre meant as a callback to spare parts.  Just like Rafaam is a call back to the golden monkey
---
I believe they said no new hero card
---
They typically don't reveal cards on weekends
---
Nice! Every time I play it makes me want to draw
---
Hunter ain't a deck archetype tho
---
I'm skeptical. You have to invest 12 Mana playing one understated minion and one okay statted minion and, as we have seen with the other Hagatha, the Shaman spell pool has a lot of duds in it. Sure, the dream of something like Bloodlust/Lava burst for 5 Mana is cool, but I just don't see the combinations being consistent enough to justify the cost. Playing a 7-mana 5/5 can be really difficult depending on the meta, so you really have to hit on the spells to recover from it. We'll have to see what new spells are introduced that might make it more valuable. 
---
I wonder how much the new new-player experience power creeps over the old one. Nowadays new players receive 22 packs just for reaching rank 25 and they get a guaranteed Legendary within the first 10 packs of each set.
---
So who had it easier? New players of today or new players of a few years ago?
---
Because they are not affilliated 
---
They are yeah. Surprised that one made it in as it'd do nothing. 
---
This looks really fun!
---
But like frog and zentimo from the last expac that got a lot of hype... will it be competitive?
---
I would say so in the right midrange build with shudder (which is my all time absolute favorite deck!!!). Ton of value when shudder recasts this. Definitely getting excited about this.  Just gotta make sure you have enough board or control options to survive the mass tempo lost on turn 7 to make this work.
---
quality ship post
---
I didn't. You did. 
---
Even if this might not be that good, props for coming up with it. Very creative
---
Completed with FinalPam#1502
---
Wait what? The target doesn't chosen randomly? Is it really a shaman legendary?
---
Because we have 30 health and gain 1 mana per turn, which doesn't change as power creep increases.  
---
"that's enough out of you"
---
you his mom? 
---
Oh ur right
---
Mill rogue was super fun this brawl, but was till 50/50 in matchups like this.  
---
jeez you're dense. I'm not quoting you, I'm quoting me because I already clearly said that it was a bad joke 10 minutes ago.
---
Do you really need me to spell out the joke and kill the tiny bit of humor that's left? Leeroy was looking for priest gear, therefore priest gear is paladin gear, therefore the avatar set is clearly a paladin set, and so of course the pictured character is a paladin. Hence the joke that you're intent on picking apart the issues of, while assuming that I don't know the leeroy video was faked.
---
kazakus with brann gives you two different spells and you build them both, I expect this works the same way.
---
Yeah the tempo loss may keep this card from being viable.  With shudder it clearly offers a TON of value though.  You would need either a deck that scrambles for board early to allow you to play a 5/5 do nothing that turn on T7, or the control tools to recooperate after getting wrecked on your opponent's T7/8.
---
I really like brawls that include deckbuilding, especially if it includes wild
---
Swamp Queen is a different position and job than Swampqueen, not sure what's confusing about it. There's also a difference a Fire Man, and a Fireman. One is a person made of fire, the other is an Italian hunk who will carry you with his beefy arms. Got it?
---
It could be that it would have 2 targeted spells but must cast them both on the same target.

9/7/9 Demon | Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, summon all Demons from your hand.

But we have one Hagatha card that is not rotated yet! Doesn't feel right. 
---
Don‚Äôt you dare talk down about my PoE )‚Äô: 
---
Swampqueen is her first name. 
---
Reminds me of Kazakus In a lot of ways.  I don't expect it to be as consistently good, because kazakus could find lethal on his 1 mana spells (or 5 on a later turn), had the option to be an insane 10 mana card, and had come out faster in general, but this also doesn't require your deck to be highlander and the 5 mana horrorboi has the chance to be much stronger than any of the 5Ana kazakus options if rng goes your way.  
---
This card isn't meta defining, but it will probably be in every shaman deck that isn't even or aggro, which is standard will be most of them most likely after all the recent nerfs...baring shaman getting some really good aggro tool (s).  
---
Regardless, I loved kazakus's design and this should be fun to play with too.  
---
We all get it - you want Blizzard to hire you. But I have to say, your art definitely qualifies!
---
Ya. I saw myself pull nice turn 4 hellfire clears and still lose so i dropped one. A turn one mortal coil can save you 5+ damage or it can help you pull off a big defile. 
---
Grumble was kobolds if I recall
---
I made a post related to this actually few months back. https://reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/a1xvu2/made_a_small_graph_to_compare_lifespan_of_each/
---
Full meme deck - Prince Liam, Divine favors, solemn vigils, and 25 1-cost cards. Won maybe 50%. Threw some games just to keep them going in order to play stupid legendary combos. No ragerts
---
as is, they have to reveal 5.95 cards a day starting now to make it on time for the day before release. 
---
Back in Secret Pally's peak (TGT and LoE) the only secret tech was Kezan Mystic, which didn't do much against Challenger. Eater of Secrets is better vs Secret Pally but much worse overall than Inspector
---
great another trash legendary is what shaman needed 
---
Ice Fishing rotating = Hagatha hero card buff.
---
Someone needs a nap I think. Or a xanax. Chill out dude. 
---
No worries!!  Sounds like hammer of wrath.
---
That feels very much like a custom Hearthstone card. Nothing against the subreddit, their ideas are great, but the cards feel a bit unpolished and this one is the same. I understand what the card does, but it's not the usual Hearthston simplicity. Not sure, if that is a good or bad thing. I like that the minion Hagatha does something with spells again, it keeps her in a similar theme.
---
So, the card's effect looks really cool. Shaman spells are kinda wonky and discovering them has very varying results, see Runespear. Getting two discovers should alleviate the wonkiness to some degree. Getting them as battlecries has some synergies in Shaman, like Shudderwock (which would also give you another Horror) or that one elemental that doubles the battlecry. The issue I see here, is that this card is really slow. It's a 7 mana 5/5 that creates a card, that created card can have board impact on it's own, but only in the following turn. That might make the card too weak against tempo and aggro strategies, but it could be interesting with some spell combinations including board clears or Bloodlust+buff and such. I would also like to know, if targeted spell will be randomly targeted or manually as part of the battlecry. I'm not quite sure which kind of deck would want this card, other than Shudderwock style decks, perhaps. Maybe mid range, maybe control, but I'm not certaint that the Swampqueen is that great, yet.
---
Shudderwock Shaman me, boy 
---
FTFY
---
Its just a game after all, lots of people have done it to me and the developers put emotes in the game for the exact reason 
---
Priest in General is a hard class, miracle rogue too, but tbh learning now a hard deck isn't worth i think since we only have 3 weeks for the new exp.
---
Not even released yet and already getting nerfed. 
---
That likely means the first discover will be from a pool of all shaman spells, and the second discover will be from a restricted pool that has no targeted spells. Could be important information.
---
She‚Äôs missing the braids and shoulder mounted canon
---
I loved the brawl.
---
I played Mecha'thun warlock without both mechs and bloodbloom as you get the discount for free, so it was basically a deck with 2 win condition cards with 28 control warlock cards (clear, card draw, life steal).  
---
Against control it was basically a free win. I rushed the card draw, won by turn 9 or 10.
---
Against aggro I played a more controlly game plan, with all the clears and the life steal to stall the game and win the game with the Reno full heal at the end. The matchups were ok.
---
If you use Hearthstone Deck Tracker and HSReplay.net, you can sort decks by dust cost to finish.
---
Not all targeted spells are allowed to target the same things, much as I'd love to Hex the enemy hero.
---
That's the thing, it doesn't see play. No one is going to play it cause it is bad so creating a better 3 drop taunt minion is ok say a 1/5 w Magnetic and a Mech Tag because it may see play filling in the spot that card would have, without breaking the game.
---
Bad power creep would be making that card too powerful (why Zylax needs to cost 5 and be Legendary) because instead of replacing a card that doesnt see play; it alienates other cards that did see play and now won't.
---
Thing is LOE was expected to drop in december, hence everyone was surprised when it was announced and released as early. 
---
That Boom's Scheme is likely spot on, 7 board spaces be damned. Great looking card.
---
Sunrise phoenix is way overpowered.
---
Master of rituals looks really fun and well-designed, I can see that being a real card.
---
Yeah, I much prefer to play against classes that gg me on turn 5. 
---
Alright boys, back on the keyword hype train! I'll admit I was feeling pretty underwhelmed by twinspell, it's basically just a draw card effect without the originality or randomness of other-pseudo draw like **Discover**. However, **Teach** could be a great keyword to open up designs, since it's basically a compression of "Discover a spell and cast it with random targets" stuck onto a minion's battlecry.
---
How do you call it when, you are providing something, in this case entertainment, in exchange for money? Because that is what most streamers do for a living. And by most people‚Äôs definition it is called work.
---
Being a camgirl is also a job, so I don‚Äôt really understand your logic there.
---
Since Shudderwock resolves discovers randomly, the new Horror should have a pair of random spells attached to it.  Should still be really strong on average.
---
u lose tempo with the kazakus 4 mana 3/3, but u get it back with the spell.

this minion is better than the kazakus 5 mana potion.
---
Still not a strong enough 10 mana play by wild standards
---
good bot.
---
I see your point
---
But in my defense this took 4 turns of pretty obvious set up as opposed to 1 turn of zero cost fireballs or mind blasts. I just wanted a really big king krush. 
---
Tetris review to this day still remains as one of my favorites
---
Man, now I understand why Swamp King Dredd seemed so stressed out
---
Putting an auction house in the game while also have new accounts be given a right high number of next to free legendary cards wouldn't make anyone money.
---
A Legendary card right now is viewed as valuable because it takes so long to get one. However, it won't be viewed that way when there's forty new accounts selling Lich Kings for seven cents each.
---
Also, I would really rather not have Hearthstone basically turn into LoL with thousands of for purchase cosmetic options often selling for upwards of ten dollars, and in game ads would negatively affect most people's engagement with the game.
---
No, it happens regardless of how fast you play. 
---
I played a mill rogue that only lost when a mag mage or shaman pulled the right cards at the start of the game.  
---
There's a big difference of tempo loss between a 7 mana understatted minion and a 4 mana understatted minion. A big one. Additionally, it was very likely to regain a lot of tempo with the the potion while the minion might not be that great for that job. Depends on the pool for the spells, but if it's really random Shaman spells, it's not a likely event to find a tempo regaining 5/5.
---
I. hate. this. card.
---
Speaking of the two cards, if you choose hagatha‚Äôs scheme as one of the spells from the horror token, I wonder if it get upgraded every turn as if the spell was in your hand. Or if you choose the spellstone in wild if that can be upgraded.
---
Bit too dark to be ungoro imo. Rastakhan is prolly where it belongs.
---
Damn, I thought this was custom hearthstone for a second.  Was going to say how it was too powerful and would never be printed. 
---
That's it? That's... What makes a good card, if it's fun to play with or not. You don't win anything by only playing the most competitively viable cards, only an extreme minority of people have a real incentive to attempt to do so. 
---
 80g quest trade, lanested#21212, EU
---
The Horror wouldn't work with Krag'wa since it's a minion not a spell.
---
I mean even the effect is pretty underwhelming. Okay you got out an AlAkir. Meanwhile Taunt Druid has cheated out 2 Sleepy Dragons, Zoolock and Odd Pally have already killed you turn 5, And every other class just instantly clears it. AlAkir just isn‚Äôt a win condition and is just not worth having to pull for 4 useless totems by turn 5-9. It‚Äôd be playable if it summoned 2 AlAkirs, but it‚Äôs just so shit even if you can get it out every game.
---
Not as infuriating as degenerate druid mechathun decks that draw the entire deck in the first 7 turns and you can't do dick about it.
---
7 mana 5/5 do nothing, with a chancen that your discover spells are useless (Shaman spells not very good in general).
---
Overhyped card, Trolden material though.
---
i definitely lost to a few hunters. in general i struggled against minion based decks but they were so few and far between that i didn‚Äôt mind much. 
---
Bit odd to have two Hagatha cards in the same rotation though...
---
This is a good visual, thanks for posting it
---
Exactly. I've been playing a lot of Shaman in Wild lately, and T7 is often where I'm being forced to Volcano, or play Healing Rain/Antique Healbot, or trying to coin out OG Hagatha, basically cards that keep me alive. Oftentimes dropping a Jade Chieftain for a bigass taunt isn't enough, so playing down Hagatha on the same turn for no board impact doesn't sound appealing.
---
Then again, that *is* in Wild, and you can always just hold it for later, so Standard might be more manageable. But the point is that this card is *slow*, and might not be playable in current shaman lists for that reason. Still, I'm definitely going to try hard as hell, this card is cool as shit.
---
And there used to be [even](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/6/6d/Auto-Pecker_4000.png?version=51a56308335e1d9d2bac761d44ac2b1c) [more crazy](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/c/c2/Devouring_Ooze.png?version=25d50c9809e1bd4957d95a2c8074cf13) [concepts](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/hearthstone_gamepedia/8/8b/Worldflipper_X-50.png?version=96fd033de9861e0b49c0711a2086841b) in early alpha.
---
Energhized#2701 EU trading 80G, you go first! 
---
I'm guessing picking volcano would make it kill itself
---
Two Hagathas at the same time :O
---
But odd druid is my favourite
---
Disgusting, If I were your opponent I‚Äôd probably be tilted off the face of the planet.
---
I get to the tenth level in ranked almost every season when it restarts, and I've never beaten the computer in a ladder. If you can't beat the computer, you can still excel in ranked.
---
"Well, chat wants \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, so I have to do it"
---
True, thank you
---
I mention elsewhere, but 7 for a 5/5 discover 2 + add a 5/5 to your hand (so a quasi-draw three effect) is faster than, say, Sprint, which does nothing to the board at all, but which has seen play. As have many similar high-cost draw effects (e.g., Nourish). 
---
That it adds a 5/5 to your hand also means this card has unusually high value. Control decks area all about this. 
---
* Dragons
---
 if you go 7 consectutive in constructed, you get 20 gold and two ranks up.. If you go 7 consecutive wins in arena, you get a free arena ticket which at minimum is a pack
---
I agree.  It's very expensive and aimed at people willing to spend $300 to $500 a year.  
---
The only reason to play is if you like it and are OK with not having very many good cards (if you're not spending at least $50 in the US 3 times a year). And even spending $200+ a year you will not have close to all the cards.   
---
Blizzard cares only about profit for this game. Everything else is second priority.
---
I suppose it's possible to get a complete collection for free *eventually*, but not in any practical way considering the amount of time it would take.
---
But owning all the cards shouldn't be a concern. The *vast* majority of players don't own anywhere close to all the cards. The majority of each set never sees any significant competitive play. That's just the nature of card games. You *can*, however, own multiple competitive decks every expansion for free if you stick with the game and manage your resources properly.
---
I wouldn't count the potions as a mechanic as they don't really have a common effect, and the only generation cards generate them randomly. 
---
Technically, [[Forlorn Stalker]] was the first Handbuff card, as it came out in Whispers of the Old Gods!

3/4/2 | Battlecry: Give all Deathrattle minions in your hand +1/+1.  
---
You don't have to spend anywhere near that (or anything at all) to keep up with the meta.
---
Kibler was great
---
Nope.
---
You already have 2 constructed formats, arena, tavern brawl and fireside gathering.
---
In arena you have now implemented specific expansions cards, sometimes it happens in tavern.
---
What can be possibly done is intoducing your idea to fireside. That's it.      
---
We cant just slap taunt on any big cost legendary with no immediate impact lol.
---
It's almost as if hearthstone is a spin off of WOW and should use ideas from it
---
The vast, vast majority of the time, token minions have no effects unless stated. It's just their stat-line and name. There is rarely a minion token generator that doesn't mention the token it creates has an effect if it does.

You go first. Ignore the name, refers to the old school zoo decks!

Capitalism.

Was?

Finally a minion that can **Taunt. Taunt. Taunt. Taunt. Taunt.**

But it's out in like 3 weeks...

Ios been crashin on phones for a year now welcome!

It'd make more sense if screenshotted after he used his HP and had no cards in hand or on the board,  otherwise:

Nothing

So that's at least 45, which I would consider "many".
---
That‚Äôs exactly my point, complaining about net decking in card games is like complaining that the roads get wet when it rains: it‚Äôs an inevitability that is part of the game so why complain about it 
---
I'd really like there to be some kind of Forced Diversity mode.
---
Just don't pick Scheme.
---
What are everyone's thoughts on leaving candleshot in death rattle hunter? Without hunters mark it's value has certainly decreased and wouldn't you be better off replacing them with some tech or tar creepers or something if you're facing lots of aggro? 
---
Thanks! 
---
exactly right? i feel arena got completely ruined when they introduced the "buckets" change. before (atleast in my humble opinion) it was two players piloting extra shit decks and seeing who can make the best out of it. then after that change it turned into semi constructed where u can get rolled game 2 without having a chance.

Bring back multiclass please.

do it.

toussaint#1148

I have concluded with this in a reply to a reply to this reply about that. Also, you don't usually have to hold it(a combo piece) for 4 turns.
---
With preps this can be done in standard with up to 3 1 mana spells and a spell that can cost 3 if I remember correctly so you could go Evis+ss+ss+petal which does the job with 1 maly if your opponent is below or at 30 (technically 31). 
---
I resent that. I sit on casual ~20 with whale decks and frequently knock into others with elite/meta decks.
---
The only reason I would want to advance rank is if it made the game more competitive and the decklists broader. 20 casual feels like the sweet spot to me. Also, hail Satan. 
---
Holy crap! It is $109.99 in Canada.
---
I said "You're fucking crazy Blizzard" when they wanted me to spend $80. I could get a new AAA game for that price.
---
$109.99 is a new release AAA game + a 1/4 Ounce of premium weed here in Canada!!!
---
blizzard prefers keeping the hearthstone team small. so there are almost no extra content like cosmetics and stuff that they can get money from. so only income is packs. and their price is high since they are the only way of making money.
---
First, Blizzard needs to address the bug that gives player an extra quest. NOW THIS IS PRIORITY, THEY ARE LOSING MONEY!!
---
Why did they never make another Inspire card? There were only a few that were any good and maybe that's why the were not very popular but I would have thought they'd pick up the mechanic again. 
---
There were more Hero Power related cards in Rastakhan - which is interresting since both sets were tournaments. Maybe one of the reason why they were reluctant recently was the presence of the KFT hero cards and Gen/Baku. 
---
Cant wait to get this off of academic espionage, and have a permanent vanish
---
"Kibler was great" chain starts here.
---
Not as bad as Valeera the Hollow's "add a Shadow Reflection to your hand" though. Here you can at least figure out that it creates a minion that casts 2 spells.
---
Indeed is hehe
