Sul'Thraze serves multiple purposes. It becomes a really big over time damage dealer (+2 durability goes a long way in case you haven't drawn your upgrades), it's not a dead draw in the mid or late game like Fiery is, and more importantly, it's one of the only non-minion based board clears this deck has. There's no brawl,  or whirlwind effects in this deck.
---

---
So while Fiery maybe a better early game weapon, Sul pulls triple duty. It deals a lot of over time damage to the face (4x4 to fiery's 3x2), board clears, and it closes out games with it's combo activations(upgrade makes it a 5x5, it lets you activate your deck hands, and it stops wide boards from racing you, since it clears wide boards naturally)

How's Duel pally working out for you? Looks fun tbh
---
I bet he has some mad RGB too!
---
Still pretty early in the season and this was at Rank 1, so I presume that there aren’t too many people that high ranked atm which causes people to have a ton of rematches.
---
Incoming Warsong Pick: 4 mana 2/3 Epic Rogue weapon with Deathrattle: Give your Charge minions +1 attack.
---
Not too bad, I'm a newer player so I don't have a lot of key cards for the deck but I made rank 12 with it.

---
Match ups. From good to bad. 
---
Secret paladin: You win because this deck is just not great. 
---
Zoolock: It always has a board but it has no burst besides leeroy. Fairly easy match up.
---
Hunters: Hunters go face, except when you play nothing but taunt. 
---
Lackey Rogue: They need a big early edwin or consecutive saps to beat you. It happens but is far from a bad match up. 
---
Token Druid: Control the board with spot removal and don't just delete it each turn. Make it awkward for them to use power of the wild/blessing of the ancients. But double savage roar still happens and there isn't much to do about it. 
---
Control Shaman: You both have the same gameplan. Lots of healing and value and kill the other guy slowly. So its closer to a mirror match up than a real one. Don't drop Vargoth early in case they have hex. Make sure you seance/replicate him. 
---
Big/dragon mage: Depends if they can high roll, and if mass hysteria can clear their giants/grave horrors. Also watch out for Kalegos Pyroblasts to the face. 
---
Control warrior: You have a chance but this is gonna be a long game, play smart, try to force a brawl without mass resurrect. I kinda wish I had DS/IF here but it would ruin all my other match ups
---
Mech warrior: Fuck, Fuck, IS THAT ANOTHER OMEGAA DEVESTATOR. Yea fuck mech warrior. 
---
Murlock Shaman: Only fought 3 of these but lost all of them. Mass hysteria doesn't clear their board. And Murloc war leader gives them the burst zoolock lacks.
---
Legit an awful card in arena imo. Assuming an even-ish board state and you pull an equal or better statted miion you basically lose the game if the opponent can play ANY cards that turn, you fall so far behind. If you pull a 6 cost upwards you might as well just tap out and save time for yuorself
---
Mr. Stark I don’t feel so good...
---
Nah opponent played, and attacked with, a golden Soldier of Fortune
---
Mediocre clip to post your channel. 3/10
---
They did it when nerfed Secret Hunter instead of Mid Hunter, because Secret Hunter have somehow more games and winrate rank 15-5.
---
Pretty sure it is, I've gotten Tree of Life from the hero power.
---
Yeah, I've done this before - not particularly hard to pull off. Definitely not photoshopped.
---
Man that's pretty good, I only just squeezed to 10 before the month rolled over, and I've played loads in the past. Helps that Zoo never changes I guess haha
---
"and my axe!" -some manlet with an axe
---
Wdym calls back?
---
If I know I got no chance of coming back, (no cards in hand) or really big dumb swingy play they do I concede
---
Oh, now I know what gaming chairs are capable of. I thought they were just money grabs with useless padding that does nothing for you.
---
It depends how I'm feeling.
---
Usually (when not tilted) I let the opponent go in for lethal.  But if they start dicking around, then I concede.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As to whether one should concede; it's entirely up to you.  If you feel there's no hope of a win and want to save yourself some time, go for a quick concede.  Who cares if some random person you'll never meet feels offended by that?  On the flipside, if you want to stick it out when the opponent has lethal, that's totally fine too.  If they start masturbating their cards, that's on them; they can't be mad at you for their choice not to end the game.
---
Exactly this. I'm debating buying packs from old sets but I'm not sure when the last legendary I opened was.

Fel Lord Bertrug, Blastmaster Boom, and Nine Lives all in one pack.   
---
Feels good.
---
Each of the villains has cars themed around expansions in the past. Toggwaggle(rogue) has cards based around kobolds and catacombs. Warrior has boomsday type cards, hagatha has witchwood type cards.
---
Ah and those are stronger? I think that’s the purpose right?
---
oh man, that has to feel good. I got a pack with no commons once myself, but mine was 2 epics and 3 rares.
---
Was it only $399?
---
"unless they know the niche differences between a good token meta netdeck and the deck recipe."

An since they're the kind of person to blame their opponent, for their loss, I would assume that's well beyond them.

Anyone have any thoughts on Maly Rogue? I've played 72 games with it the last two weeks and I've got a 51.4% winrate (37-35). It's not amazing, but it's probably a low T3 deck.

They kinda dug themselves into a hole by saying those cards are evergreen in standard. Imagine ditching the set after selling thousands of packs to thousands of people who were told those cards would always be in standard. There are exceptions with hall of faming, but that comes with a full dust refund. I don't see blizzard ever giving away.
---
The only workaround would be make a new format that doesn't include the classic set, while also keeping standard as is. But lol at the thought of blizzard ever adding anything meaningful to this game besides more packs.
---
They make some strange choices in a lot of their deck builds.  The best way to find out what cards you want in your deck is to just play it a lot.
---
How long are the queue times? Are you playing arena during the early hours of your server?
---
Based on my understanding, matchmaking attempts to find equivalent arena win/loss opponents and relaxes the allowable discrepancy if the queue times get too long.
---
I don't know what is valued more in terms of matchmaking, losses count or wins count, since I've been matched against the same players back to back a few times, usually at high win counts. I'm guessing that wins count for more than losses based on the matchmaking algorithm, but I have no data to support it.
---
For explanation:  
---
He played 4 spells followed by \[Mana Cyclone\] which adds four random spells to his hand. So turn 1 he had 2/8 in stats and a hand refill.
---
So turns out I was a nimrod and didnt realize my game had switched to wild.  Turns out that challenging a friend to a wild game changes the setting of the default ladder you are in.  Thanks for the help tho.
---
My enjoyment of it might also be the nostalgia of when I used to play when I was younger. I’m not the best at mtga and also don’t play too much so I’m not in much of a position to say if it’s amazing but I enjoy the game. If you get a chance, trying it out might be worth it.
---
It was 5 mins old when you left your comment
---
Hahaha a puzzle.
---
Hmmm do I use my 2 mana 1 damage echo card.
---
Or my 2 mana kill something card.
---
Or my 5 mana kill everything but 1 thing card.
---
Or my 1 mana removal shield slam
---
My 5 mana 3/4 that does 5 damage to the enemy minions
---
Ohhh and once I hit 10 mana which is super hard btw I gain a 4 mana 4/5 that does 10. And a 1 mana draw 3 minions card.
---
Oh and then theres also boom who gives me rush on all of my units so I can draw the game out even more.
---
I get control warrior but this current iteration reminds me of justicar warrior that was almost just as unfun to play against.
---
Hey at least rogue beats it. Because turn 3 prep into raiding into lackey bro isnt broken at all.
---
But if you whiff and re-summon Vargoth, he summons something else anyway.
---
It's a known issue - https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-bugs/issues/1138
---
OOOOF
---
Geddon is definitely not a good fit for token druid. Maybe that happened because you had a lot of value/removal cards, it got labelled as control and you needed some aoe. Btw I have forest's aid as a value card.
---
Etiquette: Doesn't really matter to be honest. It's a game. You're playing the game.
---
Goals:
---
- While climbing on ladder, if you're 100% sure you lost (kinda hard on wizard poker RNG), playing is a waste of time that adds up, meaning fewer matches and, more often than not, less efficiency (getting tired for no good reason, consuming more free time, etc). In that setting, stalling just for stalling isn't as bad as roping, but if the guy winning is grinding for a couple of hours already, it kinda gets old and feels like the same. But no, you're not doing anything wrong...
---
- In tournaments with no open decklists and multiple rounds with the same deck, you should concede if you lost 100% to avoid revealing too much information about tech cards. On the other hand, you might want to play to be  sure of what you're opponent is doing (in that setting, winning more would be a mistake from the winner you can capitalize on in future games - i.e. the guy has lethal on the board, but goes for an unnecessary Leroy finish on a deck that uses Leroy on 50% of the lists);
---
- In a multiple round tournament with a timer (i.e. 50m BO3), if your deck is slow, you pretty much need to concede if it would be 1-1 game after game 2 because saving time on game 3 can be better than forcing a draw due to the timer.
---
Tl,dr: "You should fight to the end all the time even if the battle is lost" is usually crappy advice. Then again, HS with its balance mess leading to predictable meta decks, RNG clown fiesta, and weird tournament settings/rules... Not playing to the end is the exception on tournaments.
---
Ladder is weird - i.e., if you are playing lackey rogue, conceding on sight against warrior (the only bad match), is usually the right choice because you have a high win rate against everything else and the warrior match is a lost one more often than not. It's about consistency/effectiveness/progress per hour, not about individual matches/fun. You can actually get 2 wins with rogue on the same time it takes to play out a single warrior match.
---
For tournament play, it depends on your strategy, time, information, endurance, etc.
---
Hey, did you know that there are other classes than rogue and warrior? Hunter is fun.
---
Also how else do you win if the enemies health doesnt hit 0, thats right mechathun shenanigans. Plot twist warlock with hakkar for memes. Pogo rogue, mech and holy wrath paladin. Freeze mage
---
Are you upset just because he’s a legendary and you have no dust to craft him or what? 
---
He’s the most balanced legendary they have printed in ages. Not oppressive, not completely swingy -but with the potential for a swingy turn-, perfect stats. Doesn’t feel bad when they play him against you, feels great to play him.
---
Seriously, what are you smoking complaining about Zilliax?
---
It was not only Baku, this is an exaggeration. As is the original post.
---
In YotR i played mostly Control Warlock and other Control decks i could afford. And none of them used baku, and ALL of them were viable.
---
In YotD i play mostly big Shaman and bomb Hunter and i am loving it. Token druid and Control Warriors are not even close to the amount of lackey rogues, people Just bitch about those two because they irritate them more. There are way more decks out there.
---
Loatheb and Dr. Boom weren't in 50% of ALL decks though, they were just over 30% which is \[\[Firefly\]\] levels.  
---
This is almost double that.
---
Im sorry but control beats aggro 7 to 8 times out of 10

You got disconnected and wasted 30 minutes of your life. If you cancelled after the first minute and requeued you would have got a game

Probably about the same reason his opponent has a Boulderfist.

You can share this on r/wildhearthstone too.

I keep hoping they keep refining Miracle Mage and it becomes a ladder worthy deck. The latest list by VS seems pretty close.
---
Such a fun deck. Mana Cyclone is without a doubt my favorite card this set.
---
HOW LONG CAN THIS GO ON!! ⛏⛏
---
I wish Elder Scrolls Legends had chat.
---
Sometimes the "Nice play" preset isn't good enough for the mindblowingly awesome move the guy just made that pretty much fucks me up for the remainder of the match.
---
And the "oops" and "sorry" isn't enough to tell the other guy "I'm quitting the match with you cos i grabbed a deck that can't help with my daily quest, really sorry about this"
---
I closed the app because it disconnected and won’t reconnect?
---
&gt; Imagine ditching the set after selling thousands of packs to thousands  of people who were told those cards would always be in standard. There  are exceptions with hall of faming, but that comes with a full dust  refund. 
---
The solution would be to give every player a free copy of every card that they rotate into the classic set whenever it happens.
---
&gt; But lol at the thought of blizzard ever adding anything meaningful to this game besides more packs. 
---
They did split the game into two different formats in 2016, 2 years after release.  I don't think implementing some sort of rotating evergreen set would be any more extreme than that was.
---
I’ve been meaning to play more pally. I’m a Druid main so it kills me to play mechathun. I just don’t think there isn’t too much strategy involved with token just refreshing the board after you’ve answered it 4 times already. 
---
I’m certainly open to fun standard deck ideas as I may need to rediscover how to have fun with it.
---
Burgle Rogue might not have the highest winrate, but its super fun to play.
---
&gt;And what exactly do you think this will do for people who leave the game and come back a year or something later?
---
Maybe there's more people not playing because there's a core of game-play interactions that just never change.
---
There's a case for removing it for being a repost, since it shows the exact same game scenario, in the same way that the 800 Whisperer/small rocks posts are deemed to be reposts.
---
Everyone netdecks but they don't learn how to play the deck. It is hilarious how bad players are even at rank 5. It's as if they just copy a deck code and start a game without even looking what the deck does.
---
But how 😅
---
Unlike hearthstone
---
By, puzzle, I mean that you have to decide what tool is best for what situation, and whether or not to use it this turn at all or save it for later. It's got a lot of answers because other decks have a lot of threats. Also, hitting turn 10 for a control warrior is not hard at all. It is very rare that I don't hit turn 10
---
CW beats rogue though, or atleast I do. I don't know the exact matchup win rate, but I win the majority of my rogue matches. Minions aren't sticky, can remove the weapon with weapons project or harisson. A rogue needs to get quiet lucky to win against full CW.
---
What way am i feeling? lol anyways i dont play aggro or mid range so im not some butt hurt player who loses to control warrior. i just dont understand how you think you are playing these super mind games. the game plan for control warrior is literally this. opponent plays a minion? i remove the minion until he runs out of minons. whats the most challenging thought provoking play you ever had to make as a control warrior at your "higher level" of play im genuinely curious.

ZeroStreak#1621 NA 80g quest trade. I'll show you my quest as proof and you go first
---
Its winrate can be amongst the highest when piloted correctly so it matters at higher levels of play
---
Even Shaman with corpsetaker and Walking Fountain.
---
Even Shaman had decent winrates against some of these to begin with using the default list, and the lifegain from corpsetakers and walking fountains makes aggro matchups fairly farmable.  If you're not dead on turn 8, Walking fountain tends to put the game completely out of reach for an aggro opponent.  And devolve, corpsetaker, and 0 mana 5/5 taunts help you cling onto life until turn 8.
---
Got it off of a meta report (rank 5 legend from a Japanese player).
---
Doesn't have great answers to combo decks though (darkest hour, resurect priest).  You can sometimes just kill em, but if they have the nuts you're probably dead.
---
I play pretty casually, so control warrior lasting a while and being a super interactive game is just super engaging and fun to me. Plus you get some auto-concedes from salty aggro decks after you warpath again which is pretty funny.
---
I feel this, so I actually hard run \[\[Barron Geddon\]\] in my current version. If the druid can't deal with it, they just lose to that card alone. Sometimes they do have the swipe but even then, it's at least another board clear
---
EDIT: Also have \[\[Dyn-o-matic\]\] and \[\[Super Collider\]\] for even more clearing
---
Same, but fuck big priest though.

Yeah I guess, but at least there's quite a few decks currently in the meta that are very good against it, so there's that.

what are these suit classifications for players? What's a spade?

Yeah, bomb warrior is a tough matchup. You end up drawing all the bombs and could just die to that.
---
if you're not having fun what's the point? the cardback will always be there waiting for you.
---
Yeah, Midrange Hunter is hard. I managed to hit rank 1 two weeks ago but couldn't break past because of rogues. What shaman reckts you? Big, control? Go for value game with Dire Frenzy. Two deadly shots also help.
---
Yes, but standard became the de-facto game mode for all intents and purposes.  The vast majority of the playerbase "lost" the cards that went to wild, since it became the much less played game mode.

Mecha'thun will trigger first and you will win with an Echo copy in hand. Similar case is when Undatakah copied Mecha'thun's Deathrattle first and then copied let's say Haunted Creeper. Undatakah will win you the game and will even leave two Spectral Spiders behind.
---
I love the sound this card makes. I've been trying to find it for months to make into a notification sound but I'm having zero luck. I even spent a few hours unpacking the game files, I found so many sound files but none of the card-play sounds...
---
So you either play for the board or you play to a non board wincondition (attrition, combo...).
---
Just like in every meta since the beginning.
---
The are different ways to make a strong board and to use it. There are different weaknesses in each board that slower decks try to look for in order to clear it. There are different weacknesses in the removal of each slow deck that faster decks try to go trough to push lethal damage.
---
It looks like you just burned out of the game or dont find a deck that fits your playstyle, but nothing more. The meta is fine and varied with plenty of different ways to win.
---
Mech pally its very strong and underplayed.
---
Most Khadgar mage decks aren't even playing the card in standard right now.
---
Just assume everybody you meet on the internet is a jerk. Personaly i don't mind though.
---
I respect you and the response you gave. I am in complete agreement with you that there needs to be a variety of decks. I disliked hunter a lot last expansion because I played control and it hard countered me, but that's the idea. To me, I don't think fatigue should be a play style. Control Shaman, which has basically the same win condition as Warrior, seems to me a more respectable representation of a control deck because it has a win condition outside of fatigue, but also loses to aggressive and some mid range lists. Control SHOULD be strong into mid range but not to the extent Control Warrior is right now, and it should have a win condition after dealing with the threats the opponent has produced.
---
Right now we have les than half the tier 1/2/3 decks that we had in previous expansions.
---
So yes, we have less variety. But we do have a lot of variety still (arround 10 decks in the tiers 1/2)
---
That guy probably thought about some worst case scenarios before playing Millhouse with 2 cards in opponent hand but the lil fucker still managed to lose him the game somehow. FUCK YOU MILLHOUSE I STILL REMEMBER THAT GAME FROM LAST YEAR!
---
Voodoo Ritual - take control of your opponents unused mana, overload for that much. 0 mana spell
---
Here's the full list of situations where it is a good idea to play Millhouse:
---
I feel your pain my friend.
---
Blink fox
---
It is good and all, but where are his nipples?
---
thank you
---
Shenanigans like this look actually cringey to me. I just can't watch pictures like this =/
---
Then you're playing it at the wrong time: if you have reasonable suspicion that he has a warpath, and you'd get cleared by it, you should consider other options. If all his clears have been decent, and he hasn't used a warpath yet, chances are he's holding one. Your best shot is to pressure them out early: if you summon 4 minions with 2 cards, buffs become scary enough to use a turn 4 warpath. If he leaves 3 alive (uses something like militia commander), you know he doesn't have warpath, etc.
---
Tl;dr hand reading matters
---
Awoooo\~
---
Fair enough. But to me this post just looks like obvious information.
---
It's quite expensive, but I don't get it either. I'm lucky enough to have opened a golden Kangor Endless army, and Paladin has always been my favourite class, so I already had tirion. I'm a returning player, so I'm playing a suboptimal list right now, and even then I'm able to climb to rank 10 easily, and probably rank 5 quite soon at this rate. My guess is that it's a warrior counter, but struggles against other archetypes, but I don't really see it.
---
PS : I put two truesilvers instead of the 2-2 weapons, and an ooze and an equality instead of Bellringer sentries. I kinda like it like that and don't really want to switch to a "refined" list, what do you think?
---
Can you post your list? It will be helpful to know what list you are used to playing.
---
Congratz!
---
Everyone is someones bossfight.
---
Seems like a reallly shity deck
---
One thing. While the game might feel a bit 'pay to win' since there are a LOT of cards to unlock, it isn't really. It's a pretty slow grind, but if you play consistently you will have access to most cards in standard after a year, and after two years you can craft pretty much anything you want (if you disenchant Wild cards, not neccesarily a good idea to do that).
---
Jesus, go play a rogue game!
---
Shitty deck for a shitty player my friend
---
You can't say "no h8 m8" (which, hopefully you're a teenager; if not that's pretty embarrassing) when clearly displaying hate. Before you go claiming no hate again consider a few choice words: "who really cares", "spam", and "ego boosting".
---
Historically, the community at large has appreciated these topics because it's nice to see that real people actually win these things. What "ego boosting" could really be gleaned from something like this anyways?
---
Your only complaint I can really understand is the spam piece. But, people obviously care and there is certainly no "ego boosting".
---
You sound really cynical, hateful or both. 
---
Me? I'm not a huge fan of these topics. But it's more refreshing than people posting the same 4-5 bugs/visual glitches or memes over and over.
---
So a-peeling!
---
So we have a tournament mode... It's just usually called "Play"
---
I wouldn't be so sure. First, ppl reaction to this crappy meta has been weridly positive, is known that blizzard only reacts when ppl are agry and bitchin'. Additionally, they are really proud, this is the Jade/patches shitshow again. They know they fucked up with RP and pike, but they just won't accept it. In the latest interviews they justified Rogues early game with the excuse that Rogues has no taunts so they are supposed to be opressive in the early game, on the other hand they also said that the only standard card on their radar was Archivist Elysiana, so if any nerfs are done (I don't think they will), it will be Warrior who will be hit, and maybe some random unused shaman card.
---
Very helpful thank you!
---
People hate any deck they lose to. Aggro, control, OTK, whatever. 
---
Sometimes there are actually terrible decks that dominate the meta, like Baku. But most of the time people are just complaining that theyre losing
---
Please... no more. This has to be over 50 posts on this same visual glitch.
---
The card asks a lot of questions of the player and can do many things (removal, healing, taunt, etc.) without being so powerful there are a constant stream of complaints about it unlike cards that were about as prolific such as Patches the Pirate and Corridor Creeper.
---
It is impressive to see such a ubiquitous card that is so rarely game-swinging.
---
I guess I'm underestimating how much of the field is playing rogue. I can definitely see how RoT carries against them.  Thanks!
---
 thank you!
---
It would be so cool to have a card that had semi with controllable rng that was based on flavor. 
---
Attacking face gets you Emerald Drake
---
Attacking a minion gets Laughing Sister
---
Doing nothing gets Nightmare
---
Attacking after doing nothing gets Ysera Awakens
---
could also have a special card that only appears with windfury 
---
Obviously with version its OP AF but could be really fun to play and play around if balanced properly.
---
&gt; That’s a 2-for-1 and some great survivability in the race.
---
Considering it's a 5 drop that trades into either a 3/3 SI, which got it's combo value or a dread corsair which cost 0 mana, calling it a 2 for 1 is a bit misleading since you're not using things of equal value. As I mentioned before, the 2 damage sources are a bit awkward in the mirror since you don't play any 2 health minions, making it more likely you've kept some on hand.
---
I am actually running zilliax in my own list, but it feels like this is more for every matchup beside the mirror.

---
As a f2p player without most legendarys I highly prefer Zilliax over things like Lich King and Ragnaros, which you could find in nearly every deck in privious seasons.
---
Be careful what you wish for. If they nerf Rogue and Warrior we might end with a Control Shaman meta. That is waaay less fun to lose to. 15 minute games with double Hex, double Earth Shock (at least, they can generate more) stopping you from doing anything fun or interesting.

People crafted this deck on day1 for wins so now they stick to it. I'm a control player too but playing the same Warrior deck over and over would bore me shitless and I would dust my full collection and uninstall the game because I got cancer.
---
Warrior games are fun! Except past Dr. Boom which is when they have the highground and no matter what you do you seem to be fighting uphill. Makes it a chore unless you have a winning condition in hand.

&gt; without printing oppressively powerful cards.
---
Vargoth and Muerte feel ridiculous in big priest though.
---
&gt; just mostly "been there done that"
---
That is true, but to be honest, there's really not much else you can do within Hearthstone's simplistic design so some repetition in the future is inevitable. But they managed to create really interesting and more importantly, playable stuff despite. If you compare legendaries from this expansion to stuff from previous year you can REALLY see the difference! Couple (and *just* a couple) mechanics from older sets was a nice touch too. Also, as I said in another comment, I'm mainly a Wild player and I LOVE how the expansion not only introduced much more new stuff to the format compared to previous year, but also created/revived several archetypes without printing oppressively powerful cards, which is remarkable!
---
On a thematical side, having a connected story throughout the entire year this year is a huge step forvard, it just makes much more sense. And bringing back these characters, villains from all Hearthstone's history was IMO one of the best decisions!
---
Could go amazing
---
I got disconnected on my first game in which I got a turn 4 ogre rip
---
This is epic unironically
---
A few new mechanics:  
---
Lifesteal - Heal your hero for an amount equal to the damage dealt (doesn't work when used to pop a divine shield).  
---
Recruit - Pull a minion from your deck. Think Y'shaarj. Most, if not all, recruit cards are in wild already.  
---
Echo - Repeatable this turn. After playing the card, another copy will appear in your hand, and will disappear at the end of the turn.  
---
Rush - Charge, but can't attack heroes.  
---
Magnetic - Some mechs have this mechanic. Playing a magnetic mech to the LEFT of any  mech on the board will basically buff that one with the attack, health, and any card text of the magnetic one.  
---
New tribal tag: elemental. Just like with mechs, many old-school cards were given this tag.  
---
Each class also had a legendary Hero card. Similar to Jaraxxus, it would replace your hero power and would also come with armor and a powerful battlecry. Most of these have since rotated to wild, but Warrior, Shaman, and Hunter each got an additional one which are still in standard.  
---
Each class also got a legendary weapon, quest, and spell. Spells are still in standard, but the other two have rotated. Quests were 1-mana spells (sort of) which would always be the first card drawn each game. When played, it would appear on your hero portrait like a secret, although the opponent could see what it is, and would require you to fulfill certain requirements in order to receive a powerful card as a reward.
---
Did get it from Omnistone. Can you give me thr debunking link?
---
Leeroy's face is so perfect for this scene.
---
Yes and it’s solely because of raiding party. Wanna weaken the deck? Tell Blizz to get rid of Raiding Party
---
that's pretty dumb. This expansion's going to be an exception rather than a rule for the growth of this year. It was guranteed to be the most fresh meta in a very long time
---
also 2 cards vs 4 but let's not mention that
---
We was just a gamer that loves chicken before he killed every hero
---
Well done, you crafted troggzor.
---
the problem is from my untrained perspective, is that they'll have to explain why it drops the next expansion?
---
Even if they did he would win. Mecha'thun has rush because of hero, hit millhouse, play exactly 6 warpath, GGEZ
---
I don't think it's rigged, but you can't rank up without winning two games in a row, and while that isn't uncommon, it shouldn't be expected either.
---
As far as I am aware, Bolster should be able to hit minions that were granted taunt seeing as its affecting the card on the board rather the card in the deck, hand, or graveyard, but in that respect, I could be wrong.
---
But for one less card, five less mana and no required setup that could be oozed.
---
I have a golden Millhouse Mana storm and I refuse to dust him till this day
---
Happened to me a few days ago. I had 12 health and 4 Corrupted Bloods in my deck and nothing else. All he had to do was end his turn.
---
I run a similar list, I find funny how different the matchs feels to me:
---
Secret paladin: You win because this deck is just not great. (well this one is the same xD)
---
Zoolock: I don't have much problems with this one as well, unless he drops the gigant before t5 and I don't draw swd.
---
Hunters: Hmm. In my experience they can do damage (a lot actually) with taunts in the board. They do plenty face damage in the early game and they can ignore your first 4-5 taunts by killing them from hand. They can and will burn you from hand in the later turns, this is actually one of my worst matchups if not the worst.
---
Lackey Rogue: They need a big early edwin or consecutive saps to beat you. This is what regularly happens, but yes is not that bad of a matchup, is more like a dull and boring one. On a side note you are underlaying the power of RP here. 
---
Token Druid: This is my best matchup actually, it is really easy to beat them, just keep their board as clean as possible, then trow taunts, wait till they concede.
---
Control Shaman: This is another easy one. try to get a copy of their scheme, force their 2 schemes and pray that they don't generate infinite hexes and youll be fine. The only times I have lost to this was 'cause of multiple rng generated hexes.
---
Big/dragon mage: This is another easy one, save either swd or infiltrator to deal with their gigant, if they do their combo, mass hysteria or mass resurrection should haldle it, that deck does nothing relevant besides that.
---
Control warrior: This is a long matchup indeed, but is an easy one. Their gameplan is to fatigue you. Just play mass resurrection as soon as possible to force their brawls and then onvextend and win. The only way they win is if they produce omega devastator from dr boom (similarly of hexxes from Hagata). 
---
Mech warrior: This is technically the same control warrior (at least the control variant), with more burst. save a swd for dr boom and a mass res for tanking the bombs, shadow word pain showld go on the elephants as soon as they trow it. That means that you are playing with one mass res less for most of the match but is ok 'cause they lack control and they'll tend to burn their brawls faster.
---
Murlock Shaman: It's funny that you can handle hunters but are losing to this. I consider them the weakest of the aggro decks right now (ergo the low representation). Holy nova actually clears their board, mass hysteria should do the work as well if you trow it at the right time. save pains and forbidden words for their war leader and the guy that generates more murlocs. Their only big treat is the poisonous murloc guy, but it can't be helped if they have him they do, is like sap (It's literally like sap.)
---
That Leeroy art is so unique in this game and so perfect.

Boils down to Hearthstone making about 400 million in 2016 according to a study. Total digital card games making 1.4 billion in 2017. Kibler thought Blizzard made 1.4 billion (as in the [screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/b5x1cx/important_context_to_hearthstones_52_revenue/))
---
Pre rotation taunt druid clears 90% of the heroic adventures without deck adaptations. 
---
His screenshot looks like Jade Druid
---
I think the discount on the bounced card from waggle pick, shouldn't exist then it would be more balanced.
---
turn 5 is no longer early game. Witchwood Grizzly is not even good on t5
---
Play wild where games are faster
---
I think no, because "Twinspell" keyword adds additional mana-cost on cards, like "Chose One".
---
you're welcome :D
---
and same, after playing it last night, 2 storm chasers felt bad. Ended up swapping it back with electra for that bloodlust combo.
---
Draws 2nd syphon, game on
---
But that would do nothing to curb the power of playing it on a Mountain Giant, or are you saying Twinspell should be removed in addition to the change you're already recommending?
---
Both are taunt minions in that case. I'm not sure I understand your comment. If you give cthun taunt it will be affected by bolster. If you give the upgradable framebot taunt (say by magnetizing a magnetic minion with taunt onto it) it will also be affected by bolster. Bolster affects taunt minions on the battlefield and as long as those minions have taunt when you cast the spell theyll be affected.
---
There're always going to be counters to popular decks. Odd warrior was good against both of these decks, same as jade druid and reno mage. Not to mention the other aggresive options that would most likely overtake oil rogue: odd rogue, aggro shaman, token druid (which would be able to run undertaker). Honestly they said the same thing about wild, that it would just be people smorking until boom on 7, but that prediction wasn't accurate at all. I think it's silly to dismiss a new mode for the game because of what you would think would happen, when there's virtually no consequence to having it in the game
---
Pay to win players smh
---
so it works with shaman reincarnation?
---
If you are going for swarming with minions take a look at zoo warlock and more specifically some budget zoo warlock lists.
---
Baleful Banker I don't see the point here.
---
I'd probably take out some of the top end you have and add some more little guys like Evil Genius and Dire Wolf Alpha. Things that synergize with having minions on board. There are also better cheap options than Goldshire, Frostwolf Grunt, Felguard
---
Felguard specifically is pretty bad. Sub that out.
---
Many of the minions you are running have stronger cards you could swap in that are common or basic. 
---
Now I am not great at deck building so feel free to ignore and I'm not trying to crap on you here.
---
Ok thats hilarious.
---
First off, I genuinely 'lol'd' at your headline. Kudos.
---
To answer your question though, I love controlly style decks and I'd rather win a slow game I enjoy than win a fast game with a deck I don't.
---
Eviscerate: Deal 2 damage. Combo: Deal 4 damage instead.

ReMarkable#2879 80 g EU
---
Thanks for letting us know which cards were golden.
---
Would love to see a reworking / nerf of this card. Just have it's a "current" cost thats it! No more 12 cost Giants if you put that s*** on the field costing 2 it's going to summon two, two cost monsters.
---
Lol u think blizz would make its biggest boom days pack seller free your funny
---
Yeah, the 7 theme got way out of hand with that card.
---
I accidentally did this in my Thundatakah Warrior deck...used hero power to find the mech that summons 3 microbots and it died before mechathun.  Ooops. lesson learned.
---
depends. i play more during first week of expansion than the rest of the later 3 months combined so i actually get more dust value out of spending immediately.
---
9 out of 12 decks are rogue... 3 out of 12 classes represented...  what a time to play or watch hearthstone.
---
Undatakah copies Deathrattles in a random order so you should definitely avoid picking up such Mechs.
---
Please tell me how to program a game that is constantly rigged against everyone XD.
---
decks shouldn't be trying to do everything at once. Your decks seems akin to zoo warlock decks, where to try to control the board with a ton of minions.
---
I know. It just sucks, I wouldn't have clerics in the deck if priest had ONE card draw spell.
---
I'll always keep my favourite card
---
I do not own one, but based on the specs, I think it'll run just fine. For a good experience, you will depend way more on your connection with a phone like this one.
---
&gt;Do you answer all phone calls and talk to whoever called you even if you don't know him? 
---
Yeah, I do answer the phone and say hello and see what the caller wants even if I don't know who it is in advance. Am I weird?
---
Also, all the times I've answered the phone it's never been a racist troll on the other end giving me death threats.
---
but please. give me the heist blizzard.  my gold is aching to be spent
---
Stop running cleric then
---
I knew this comment would come :D
---
It's because mobile has the widest market out of all of the platforms. Pretty much everybody has a phone these days and they have them with them everywhere. The amount of time people spend on their phones every day has to be absurdly big. If you'e confused why mobile games haven't evolved so fast it's probably because hardware is a limiting factor which means the devs can't do as much and they have to spend more time making their game compatible for many different phones. Not only that, but they're designed for a different purpose, to preoccupy people for very short periods of time throughout the day.
---
The problem is that they have so many cards that give them enough armor to survive an early attack until they pull something to clear it
---
I just thought the mill house was on board and you were screwed until I looked at actions
---
Sometimes they also get angry when their netdeck gets stomped by my shitty homebrew deck because how dare I win against them with such a bad deck.
---
Is it still possible to buy the old adventures? Oldest one I have is kharazim which I haven’t even attempted on heroic since I got it XD
---
Thank you !
---
I think i might have to give up on Khadgar decks , all of them are too expensive
---
You don't need to play this game 5 hours a day to complete your daily quest and get a tavern brawl pack once a week. Considering this game is over 5 years old now, you can imagine how many, many F2P players have no problem crafting multiple meta decks. There's dozens of us, dozens! Saying you'll never craft a meta deck is like saying you'll never play this game for a year.
---
My Jaws that My Jaws my Jaw my my..m..m..my jaws that bite, my claws that catch
---
Exactly what I did. He had another war leader in hand tho.
---
Dr. Boom Mechathun is seeing some play. Mechathun is an alternate win condition to archivist and it beats mirror matches.
---
Best bet is mulligan for early curve + PotW, win the board and buff it and then use Swipe + 3 Starfire + Feral Rage for reach.
---
I would say this is only relevant if you want to see the meta for rank 20-5. As the bulk of the results seem to be from that range.  
---
Also: [https://hsreplay.net/meta/#timeFrame=LAST\_7\_DAYS](https://hsreplay.net/meta/#timeFrame=LAST_7_DAYS) is more up to date.

&gt; Every time I try an Arena run, my first queue after draft is inevitably matched up against an all-golden, three-legendary player. 
---
I am sure this doesnt happen. Maybe you just did one arnea run in total and it happened? But I still doubt it.
---
Oh they are? That's good to know, thanks! Is ther any place I could follow the progress or any updates on that?
---
I think you responded to the wrong comment
---
But only decks/players with almost no win/loses too, so the chances of seeing a really strong deck is a bit lower since once those get 1 or 2 victories you cant get matched against them untill the 7-8 wins range.
---
Elysiana feels like the worst designed card this expansion. It creates a dynamic where you have to run it as control only to have the game decided on whether or not your RNG cards beat theirs.
---
At least Dr Boom seems like he’d be easy enough to tweak and take down the power level. Discover a mech becomes add a random mech to your hand, and/OR remove the perma rush effect.
---
Sure let me just play my Cabal Shadow Priest
---
Great video
---
hello i am HydreNoire, i sent you my invite
---
What game are you guys playing?? I've never experienced someone conceding for no reason like that and I pretty much only play in rank 20-15.
---
Beat me this time ;)
---
I agree that control shaman is all over the place but despite this a consistent build of it has yet to emerge.  Trust me I like shaman and have most the good shaman cards so I am hoping a good control (or midrange) shaman comes through.
---
However just because it did well in a tournament doesn't equate to it doing well on the ladder.  I have actually played hunterace's exact build on the ladder and while fun it is not as strong as control hunter for the ladder meta (YMMV).
---
Anyway here's hoping a good build comes out this rotation or next.  I got jepetto and barista in different packs so I would love to see someone come out with a cool battle cry deck!
---
Aggro also does better without spirit lash.
---
The real problem is big priest in wild.
---
Well I suppose I meant that for a player that doesn’t often see 8-12 wins, often times the best decks caaaan be the first one you run into, compared to what you see on average at like 4-2.
---
Never sorry
---
Everytime i win a game with Jaraxxus, before lethal i can't help but first let go the "YOU FACE JARAXXUS, EREDAR LORD OF THE BURNING LEGION" then hit lethal while letting go "OBLIVION!"

---
i did oh well

It would appear that Arya has made her way into Hearthstone.
---
Prepare to face the might of Millhouse Manastorm!

So basically the hero power because that's still 2 Mana for 1 silver hand lol
---
You're basically getting a free hero power when you play Dr. Boom. Even still, the seeing potential of giving all mechs when things like Dyn-o-matic and Devastator exist is way to insane. It basically makes it impossible for many decks to keep anything on board.

And I can't say what % of games do that, but almost all MMO/FPS I played have a team chat AND an "all" chat... Talking to people -both  allies and opponent - is part of the social aspect of games.
